[37:54] Lord, sure you surely you are our
[37:56] anchor. Lord, you are our strength.
[38:00] Lord, you are our high tower. You are
[38:02] our shelter.
[38:04] Lord, you're all that we have need of.
[38:05] Lord, you're what holds us. You're what
[38:07] settles us, Lord. It's your thoughts and
[38:09] your words that have anchored us to you,
[38:12] Lord, from before our time began, Lord
[38:14] Jesus. Lord, we're thankful this
[38:16] evening, Lord, to come in, Lord, and be
[38:18] reminded of our position in Christ,
[38:20] Lord. To be reminded that we're sons and
[38:22] daughters of God. To be reminded, Lord,
[38:24] that we're the virtuous, spotless, Lord,
[38:27] wrinkle-free bride, Lord, that you
[38:28] promised in this age, heavenly father.
[38:31] Lord, as we take your word again
[38:32] tonight, Lord, I pray you'd show us the
[38:34] shity of it, Lord. The confidence that
[38:36] we can have, Lord. Lord, that you can
[38:38] show us why we believe what we believe.
[38:40] Lord, that what we're holding on to is
[38:42] built on a firm foundation of your word,
[38:44] Lord God. Lord, bless your people.
[38:46] Settle us tonight, Lord. We pray, Lord.
[38:48] Each prayer request that's gone forth,
[38:50] Lord, you see, each heart, Lord, that's
[38:51] seeking, searching, Lord, I pray you
[38:53] would just minister to them, Lord, in
[38:55] your presence tonight. In Jesus Christ's
[38:57] name we ask and pray it. Amen. Amen. God
[39:00] bless you. Turn if you would to Amos
[39:02] chapter 3. Amos chapter 3. Just a little
[39:06] tiny book there between Joel and Oadiah.
[39:10] And then welcome each one that can make
[39:11] it out tonight. Certainly want to
[39:13] appreciate God's grace for brother Jason
[39:15] Watkins that they couldn't find anything
[39:17] wrong. He's back and no doubt knowing
[39:20] brother Jason as little as I do, but
[39:21] what I've heard, he'll be back in the
[39:23] saddle very, very quickly. So we trust
[39:25] that the Lord will make him a blessing
[39:26] and continue to guard his life. Amen. No
[39:29] one can take them until God says it's
[39:31] time to go. That's for sure. And we
[39:32] rest. We rest in that day by day. Amen.
[39:35] Amos chapter 3, very familiar scripture
[39:37] to someone that believes this message.
[39:40] He says, "Surely the Lord God will do
[39:42] nothing, but he revealth his secret unto
[39:44] his servants, the prophets. The lion
[39:47] hath roared, who will not fear. The Lord
[39:50] God hath spoken, who can but prophesy."
[39:53] Amen. God bless you. can have your seats
[39:56] and I want to take a brief detour here
[39:58] and you know this is the the the series
[40:00] that never ends. I think it's very
[40:02] difficult to end a series, but we've
[40:03] been preaching on this idea of the
[40:05] mystery finished. And we were coming up
[40:07] to Revelation 10:7. And really, when I
[40:09] came up to it, the more I studied it,
[40:11] the more I prayed about it, I couldn't
[40:13] have peace to press forward. Because to
[40:15] believe Revelation 10:7, you've got to
[40:17] understand why you believe Revelation
[40:18] 10:7 in the first place. And so, u, what
[40:21] I'm going to do tonight here is is
[40:23] certainly some teaching. I'm going to
[40:24] project my inner brother Mark for this
[40:26] service and for the next three or four
[40:28] as the Lord would lead. Amen. But I I
[40:30] want to take something that we've we all
[40:32] believe. I I I trust we all believe, but
[40:34] certainly maybe we've not all heard it
[40:36] to the full depth of what we're going to
[40:38] talk about tonight. And so I want to
[40:40] take this thought on the restoration
[40:42] message. Amen. Before we come back to
[40:44] our series on the mystery finished,
[40:45] we've got to talk about this restoration
[40:48] message. And like I said, we'll we'll
[40:50] take a couple services on this. And full
[40:51] disclosure, I preached this many many
[40:53] years ago. It was the first series I
[40:54] ever preached in my life when I came
[40:56] into the ministry. And I did it with
[40:58] purpose because what happened is we have
[40:59] people out witnessing and and they were
[41:02] talking with people. And the thing is
[41:04] people will ask what's different about
[41:06] you. And we have a lot of things that we
[41:08] believe are different. For starters,
[41:10] Godhead would be a major one for us.
[41:12] Water baptism would be one that would
[41:13] separate us in a lot of things.
[41:14] Predestination would separate us in a
[41:16] lot of things. But it eventually comes
[41:18] out, well, why do you believe that? And
[41:19] we end we have to say eventually is we
[41:22] believe that God sent a prophet. And
[41:25] listen, we can't be ashamed of that.
[41:27] It's a hard thing to say these days
[41:28] because so many people don't understand
[41:30] it. But what happened was this person,
[41:32] this young person was witnessing and and
[41:34] they said, "Well, why do you believe in
[41:36] a prophet? Where is that in scripture?"
[41:39] And so they said, "Well, it's, you know,
[41:40] it's Malachi 4 and 6." And well,
[41:43] somebody says, "No, that was John the
[41:44] Baptist." Well, now what are you going
[41:46] to do? Well, what about Revelation 10:7?
[41:48] Well, that's just an angel. We don't
[41:49] know who that is. And so if you don't
[41:51] have a a foundation in the scriptures,
[41:54] then you can't explain why you believe
[41:56] what you believe. And let me say this,
[41:57] church, we have to believe by faith in
[42:00] something. Amen. We don't just believe
[42:02] because we've been taught that God sent
[42:04] a prophet. We believe because it's based
[42:06] on the word. Our faith has to be based
[42:08] in the word of God, not based in signs
[42:11] and wonders, not based in what our mom
[42:12] and our dad tell us, but it has to be
[42:14] based on something. And so if I was
[42:16] asked tonight, why do you believe God
[42:18] sent a prophet? Well, most people would
[42:19] say Malachi 4:5 and 6. Some would say
[42:21] Luke 17:30. Some would bring us back to
[42:24] Amos 3:7 here. Some would take us
[42:26] forward to Revelation 10:7 or Revelation
[42:29] 3 in the latestian church age in these
[42:30] things. But how many of us could explain
[42:32] why Revelation 10:7 refers to a prophet
[42:34] in this age? How many of us could break
[42:37] down what Jesus said in Luke about John
[42:39] fulfilling one part and Elijah to come
[42:42] fulfill another? How many of us could do
[42:43] it? And the reason why I do this is
[42:45] because at some point we're going to
[42:46] have to testify why we believe what we
[42:48] believe. And I be I think it'd be
[42:50] wonderful that you would have at least a
[42:51] basis for knowing why it is that we
[42:54] believe that God sent a prophet in this
[42:56] age. Amen. And like I said, it matters
[42:58] because we have to be able to testify
[43:00] from the Bible. Amen. I'm not going to
[43:03] read a quote tonight. I'm going to read
[43:05] scripture after scripture after
[43:06] scripture after scripture because the
[43:08] word of God is what we're trusting in.
[43:10] Amen. That's what we're believing
[43:11] tonight. Otherwise, if we don't take it
[43:14] back to the word, let me say this. You
[43:16] take everything Brother Brandham said
[43:17] and you just preach from there, you'll
[43:18] be led, you'll be led astray by every
[43:20] wind of doctrine. We've seen it. We've
[43:22] seen it. Especially the older folks
[43:23] here, we've seen that what happens is
[43:25] people take quotes and they start quote
[43:27] wars instead of tying it back to the
[43:29] scripture, which is what the prophet
[43:30] himself did. And that would balance us
[43:32] out every time. Amen. And otherwise,
[43:34] what happens is we'll take that prophet,
[43:36] people will take that prophet, they'll
[43:37] put him in a position of influence he
[43:38] was never meant to be in. They'll
[43:40] replace a five-fold ministry with them.
[43:42] They'll even correct the word itself
[43:45] with what the prophet said, which makes
[43:46] no sense because he's a word prophet.
[43:48] He's got to agree with it. Amen. We look
[43:50] at the Christian world, they can preach
[43:52] on the three works of grace,
[43:53] justification, sanctification, baptism
[43:55] of the Holy Spirit. But for the
[43:57] majority, Christ is just somebody that
[43:58] died 2,000 years ago. And once they
[44:01] preach, however far they go, whether
[44:02] it's justification, the the Lutherans,
[44:04] whether it's sanctification, the the
[44:06] Methodists, whether it's baptism of the
[44:07] Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals, once
[44:09] you've done what they want you to do,
[44:11] then they don't know what else to do
[44:12] with you. You're kind of just stuck
[44:14] there. Once you've spoken in tongues in
[44:15] a Pentecostal church, there's nothing
[44:17] left for you to do but to keep speaking
[44:18] in tonesues. So, they kind of walk
[44:21] around in a spiritual and a scriptural
[44:23] stuper because once you've done the sign
[44:25] or the wonder or the work or the put
[44:28] your name on the book, they say, "That's
[44:29] it. you're done. And they don't know
[44:31] what else to do with you. Amen. And so
[44:33] we end up with Bible teachers and
[44:35] scholars that have no idea of what this
[44:37] Bible even talks about. I heard John
[44:39] MacArthur say the other day, not in live
[44:41] because he's not alive anymore. But he
[44:42] said, you know, uh he believed in the
[44:44] cessation doctrinism that the that the
[44:46] the signs and wonders ended with the
[44:48] apostles because that was only for the
[44:50] apostles. Church, you just have to go
[44:52] read about Philip to know it wasn't even
[44:54] just for the apostles. but his eyes are
[44:57] blinded because he's been caught up in
[44:59] something that hasn't been revealed.
[45:01] They put a period behind what they
[45:03] believe and because they don't have what
[45:05] the rest of the word says, they say it
[45:06] has stopped. Well, it has stopped in
[45:08] them, in their life, in their
[45:10] denomination, in their ministry. Amen.
[45:12] But they don't understand the things
[45:13] that God's doing. And so when we go and
[45:16] we're talking to people and we witness
[45:18] and we testify, they can we can lead
[45:20] them to salvation. and we can lead them
[45:22] to an experience with Christ, but then
[45:23] they've got to lead themsel they've got
[45:25] to be led into a place where they can do
[45:27] what the word says they're supposed to
[45:28] do. Amen. Being filled with the Holy
[45:31] Ghost is just the start.
[45:33] And in so many churches, being filled
[45:34] with the Holy Ghost is the end if they
[45:36] even get you there. If they even believe
[45:38] in that sort of thing. And so for us as
[45:40] as message believers, as we would call
[45:42] ourselves today, there's so much more to
[45:44] this than just being baptized in the
[45:47] name of Jesus Christ and receiving the
[45:48] Holy Spirit. There's so much more to it
[45:50] than that. That's the start of the great
[45:51] journey for the the bride that's going
[45:54] to be raptured and that's that's going
[45:55] to be resurrected in this age. Amen. So,
[45:59] we have to be willing to admit at some
[46:00] point that we believe that God sent a
[46:02] prophet whose message would forrun the
[46:05] second coming of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[46:08] That he himself was a forerunner. And
[46:10] that's tough to do because there are so
[46:11] many uh prophets that have come this
[46:14] way. We look at Joseph Smith for the
[46:16] Mormons. How did that work out? We were
[46:18] talking about it at at at lunch today.
[46:20] Married a little girl.
[46:23] You look at at Ellen G. White for the
[46:25] Adventist and what did she do? False
[46:26] prophecy in terms of when the Lord would
[46:28] come and these different things. And and
[46:30] then you have all the ones that are out
[46:31] there in what we would call cults. Sad
[46:34] to say it. Guess what? People believe
[46:35] we're in a cult because we believe in a
[46:37] prophet. That's a hard thing. That can
[46:39] be a shame to us. But that's a shame
[46:41] we've got to bear. We've got to bear
[46:43] because there is a burden to to believe
[46:45] the gospel, to believe the true word of
[46:47] God. Amen. And so you have cults out
[46:49] there with with prophets and what do
[46:51] they do? They lead them out to somewhere
[46:52] and inevitably they turn to to to abuse
[46:55] of the women of the children or money or
[46:58] their assets or they they kill
[46:59] everybody. That's the way it tends to
[47:01] work out in those things. And so the the
[47:02] title of a prophet is these days
[47:04] associated with cults, with infamy, with
[47:07] abuse and all these different things. So
[47:08] you're going to face an uphill battle
[47:10] with people when it comes to talking
[47:11] about what you believe if you're really
[47:13] going to get down into it. Amen. We've
[47:15] all been there. but it's not really a
[47:17] part of history or culture in the in in
[47:19] the Gentile churches, in the white
[47:21] churches, maybe. And so, you're going to
[47:23] have to know your Bible to be able to
[47:25] talk about this. And here's the thing. I
[47:27] and I've had to answer questions for
[47:29] people. They come in, they say, "Who is
[47:30] it that you're quoting?" I was
[47:32] witnessing to a a coworker there and he
[47:35] said he said very quickly, he says, "I
[47:37] notice you quote Mr. Brandom a lot."
[47:39] Yes, I do. Why is that? Well, you have
[47:41] to tell them. You have to tell them. And
[47:43] so they either accept or reject usually
[47:45] right there. But if we're going to
[47:46] accept what brother Brandham says, we
[47:48] have to believe he's a true prophet by
[47:50] the word. Not just because we believe
[47:52] he's a prophet. We ought to believe he's
[47:54] a prophet by the word. If we're going to
[47:56] accept his message for its fullness,
[47:58] then we've got to believe that he was
[47:59] sent here for a purpose with that
[48:01] message and not of himself, but of the
[48:03] Holy Spirit. Otherwise, you get people
[48:05] that are just like the rich young ruler.
[48:07] They'll come in and they'll only go so
[48:09] far with it because it's not settled in
[48:11] their heart. it's not settled within
[48:13] their heart. And so he walked away and
[48:15] he called Jesus and he called him he
[48:16] called him uh uh uh master, good master.
[48:22] And Jesus said, "There's none good but
[48:24] God." He was testing his revelation. He
[48:26] had no revelation of who he was. And so
[48:28] when Jesus asked him to do a hard thing,
[48:31] has he asked you to do hard things? He's
[48:34] asked us to do hard things, hasn't he?
[48:35] When he asked him to do a hard thing
[48:37] that no other ministry had asked him to
[48:39] do, he turned him down. and he walked
[48:42] away and he was sad because he was very
[48:44] wealthy and Jesus had asked him to give
[48:46] up his wealth, take up his cross and
[48:48] follow him. Amen. So it's of it's for
[48:51] our benefit and for the benefit of those
[48:53] we'll ever talk to to establish
[48:55] scripturally why we believe what we
[48:57] believe and accept the message that we
[48:59] accept today. And like I said, we're
[49:01] only going to use the Bible. No message
[49:02] quotes, no commentaries because that's
[49:05] the foundation of our belief is it takes
[49:06] us back to the scripture. Now the the
[49:09] the word prophet in Hebrew means
[49:11] spokesman or speaker. And the first
[49:13] purpose, the main purpose of a prophet
[49:16] is to speak the word of the Lord. God
[49:18] comes to the prophet. He can come to him
[49:21] in a dream. He can come to him in a
[49:22] vision. He can come to him in a voice.
[49:24] He can come to him in any way that he
[49:25] wants, but he gives him a message and
[49:28] then that prophet is supposed to repeat
[49:30] that message. And so we see in the Old
[49:32] Testament in particular, it would talk
[49:34] about the word of the Lord. It appears
[49:36] 274 times in the Bible and it's almost
[49:39] always associated with God coming to a
[49:41] prophet and then you'll see the Bible
[49:43] say something like and the word of the
[49:45] Lord came to the prophet Isaiah or the
[49:47] word of the Lord came to soand so and
[49:50] then it'll say that that person went and
[49:52] they would say thus saith the Lord and
[49:55] they would give the message that God
[49:56] gave them. So the word the voice was the
[49:59] prophets but the words were God's.
[50:02] That's first thing to establish with a
[50:03] prophet. He does not speak from himself.
[50:06] He speaks what God tells him to speak.
[50:08] So therefore, a prophet is a tool in the
[50:12] hands of God. He has no message of his
[50:15] own. He has no doctrine. He has no
[50:17] ideas, no opinions,
[50:20] nothing. What he hears from God, he
[50:22] speaks back. Amen. He's not to interject
[50:24] his own thoughts or his own ideas into
[50:27] the message. And so what he is is he is
[50:29] a microphone. A prophet is a pure
[50:32] microphone. Amen. That God can use
[50:35] without any filters or opinions being
[50:37] added in. Can you imagine if I'm
[50:38] preaching tonight and the microphone was
[50:40] adding in what it thought I meant?
[50:43] Well, it'd be chaos for sure. I'd be
[50:45] fighting the microphone and you'd be
[50:47] trying to say, "What's what's John?"
[50:49] Brother John and what's the microphone?
[50:51] The microphone can't add anything. It is
[50:53] purely a transmission device. Amen. And
[50:55] that's what preserves the purity of the
[50:57] word. Now, the word of the Lord comes in
[50:59] different ways and for different
[51:01] purposes. So what is God using a prophet
[51:03] for? Well, the first thing he does is he
[51:06] comes and brings judgment. What he
[51:08] brings is a warning. Amen. He warns of
[51:10] impending judgment. He provides a way of
[51:12] escape. And then he shows you what
[51:15] refusal to take that way of escape is
[51:17] going to look like. And how does he do
[51:19] it? He points the people back to what
[51:21] God has said. Amen. He always points to
[51:24] what God has said. The second purpose of
[51:26] a prophet is to show things that are to
[51:28] come. God doesn't want us to be caught
[51:30] by surprise.
[51:31] When it comes to God's family, remember
[51:33] what Jesus said to the disciples. He
[51:35] says, "You're my friends. I want you to
[51:37] know what's out there. I want you to
[51:39] know what's coming." And so, he he sends
[51:41] his prophets a message to show them
[51:43] what's coming down the road so they can
[51:46] relay it to the church, to the
[51:47] believers, and then the faithful
[51:49] believers will catch what's happening,
[51:51] and they'll be ready for it before it
[51:53] ever happens. They make themselves
[51:54] ready. Amen. They prepare themselves for
[51:56] it. The third thing is for a junction in
[51:59] time. Now remember the scripture says
[52:01] God will do nothing except he shows it
[52:04] to the prophets first. So that means
[52:05] whenever we have a junction in time,
[52:07] whenever we have a major event, whenever
[52:09] we have a crossroad, whenever we're
[52:11] turning a corner, God always sends a
[52:14] prophet to show the way. And that's to
[52:17] give us confidence to take us through
[52:20] the changing of the situation.
[52:23] Amen. I've had to go through many
[52:24] changes in my life. And the thing that
[52:26] holds me solid is that God leads me
[52:28] through it. Amen. that God is there to
[52:30] work through it. So even when you it
[52:32] seems like so many things are going on,
[52:35] you have faith because you can see
[52:36] what's coming. And in so many things in
[52:38] our life, we can take it back to the
[52:40] word and we can see what God was trying
[52:41] to do in our life. And then the last
[52:43] thing is really it's kind of
[52:44] all-encompassing and that's to show us
[52:47] the divine thoughts and nature of God.
[52:50] Amen. God's purpose is to restore us to
[52:53] relationship, his original relationship
[52:55] with us. And he wants us to know who he
[52:57] is. He wants us to know what he is. He
[52:59] wants us to know what he likes. He wants
[53:00] us to know how he thinks. And so, he
[53:02] uses the prophets to show us these
[53:05] things. Now, let me say it this way. A
[53:07] Catholic doesn't need a prophet because
[53:08] they've already got a pope. They've got
[53:11] a pope that tells them what God thinks,
[53:13] what God wants constantly. And so,
[53:15] you'll find there's a reason why people
[53:17] reject a prophet is because they've
[53:19] already got something that takes the
[53:20] place of the prophet in their church.
[53:22] Amen. But you have to remember something
[53:26] because we are blessed today that we can
[53:28] pick this up and we can read all that
[53:30] God gave his people. But in its original
[53:32] form, there was no Bible. There was just
[53:35] a prophet. And the prophet would come
[53:37] and he would speak the words to the
[53:39] people and then they would have to
[53:41] decide if they were going to take it or
[53:42] not. Moses would come and as he he would
[53:45] he would backwards write the the the
[53:48] things that God had told him and he
[53:50] wrote the books that we call the books
[53:52] of Moses. But first he he he spoke them
[53:54] to the people and then he wrote them
[53:57] down for them to remember them by. And
[53:59] after that all the prophets copied what
[54:01] Moses did. And so we have this beautiful
[54:03] Bible that we have today. But originally
[54:06] the people didn't have a book to judge
[54:08] anything by. All they had was thus
[54:10] sayeth the Lord. The prophet came. He
[54:13] gave them God's word. He gave them God's
[54:15] message. And then they had a simple
[54:16] choice. Accept it or reject it. And
[54:19] that's what it was every time. And how
[54:21] did they know if that man was a prophet?
[54:24] What he said came to pass. And if it
[54:26] didn't, he wasn't a prophet. He wasn't
[54:30] anointed. He wasn't of God. And that's a
[54:32] very stiff um uh requirement because if
[54:35] you're wrong once,
[54:38] that's it. That's it. You're done. One
[54:41] wrong move, one wrong prediction, one
[54:43] wrong prophecy, and that's it. He said,
[54:45] "You don't have to fear him. You don't
[54:46] have to listen to him. He's not my
[54:48] prophet." God is 100% accurate. When God
[54:52] writes prophetic tests, it's 100%. It
[54:54] always comes true. Okay? But let's start
[54:57] from the beginning. And I want to show
[54:58] this progression of prophets and how God
[55:00] uses them because I want to anchor these
[55:03] principles on on why we picked these
[55:05] four reasons here tonight for why God
[55:08] did uh uses prophets. So we look in in
[55:10] the first one in the Old Testament and
[55:11] we see Noah and that was God's first
[55:13] judgment in uh Genesis 6 and 7. And so
[55:17] we see God warning of something coming.
[55:19] He says there's a way to get out. Get in
[55:22] the boat. And they said no. And
[55:25] eventually what happened? God shut the
[55:26] door. The prophet didn't shut the door.
[55:29] God shut the door. And who was in was
[55:30] in. And who was out was out. That he
[55:32] that's holy be holy still. Let him
[55:33] that's filthy be filthy still. Then we
[55:35] look at Abraham. And Abraham comes along
[55:37] and he warns of the Egyptian slavery
[55:40] that's coming to the children of Israel.
[55:42] He says, "You're going to be in a in a
[55:43] in a foreign land for 400 years. It's in
[55:46] Genesis 15:3. So, he's showing them that
[55:48] there's a a judgment or a time of
[55:50] hardship coming, but he's also showing
[55:52] them there's a junction. There's a time
[55:54] of hardship and then there's going to be
[55:56] a time of deliverance as well. So, get
[55:58] ready when that 400 years starts to roll
[56:00] around because your redemption draws
[56:01] nigh. Then we look at Joseph and he
[56:04] comes and he he gives a warning of uh of
[56:07] famine and a way of escape as well in
[56:09] Genesis 41. So, he shows them, hey,
[56:11] there's going to be good times, there's
[56:12] going to be bad times, and the bad times
[56:14] are going to carry on. So, here's the
[56:16] way you get out of it. And then we look
[56:18] at Moses and Moses now comes and he he
[56:21] tells them, listen, what Abraham
[56:23] promised, it's here now. He's showing
[56:25] them this is the junction in time. This
[56:27] is the time of your deliverance. It's
[56:29] the time for you to be set free. And
[56:31] then he also came and he brought the law
[56:33] of God to the people. So, he was a word
[56:35] prophet. He brought the the mind of God.
[56:37] He brought the requirements of God as
[56:40] well. And we see what happened in Moses
[56:42] in particular. You see, God was always
[56:44] using prophets to point to the future,
[56:46] but they were just believers. You look
[56:49] at Abraham. Abraham was just a believer,
[56:51] but he was a prophet. But there came a
[56:53] point where God said, "I'm only going to
[56:55] work through prophets." And we see what
[56:57] happened in Exodus 20 is what happened
[56:59] is God came down. And it says, and he
[57:01] was talking to all the people. He said
[57:03] to Moses, "I'm going to reveal myself.
[57:04] I'm going to speak to the people." And
[57:06] it says, "Now all the people witnessed
[57:08] the thunderings, the lightning flashes,
[57:10] the sound of the trumpet, and the
[57:11] mountain smoking. And when the people
[57:13] saw it, they trembled and stood a far
[57:15] off. Then they said to Moses, "You speak
[57:18] with us and we will hear, but let not
[57:20] God speak with us, lest we die." They
[57:23] said, "Listen, we can't handle God
[57:25] speaking to us. You go do it."
[57:28] And from that moment on, God changed how
[57:30] he interacted with humanity. And since
[57:32] that time, he's always worked through
[57:34] prophets to bring a message to the
[57:36] people. He'll still deal with people as
[57:37] a group. And then he but he uses one man
[57:40] to speak the word of the Lord. and he
[57:41] spoke exclusively through the prophets
[57:44] from that point onwards.
[57:46] So, we see as we're moving forward in
[57:48] the Old Testament, we see Jeremiah and
[57:50] he's warning now of the 70-year
[57:52] Babylonian captivity. So, he's warning
[57:54] them of judgment. You've walked away
[57:56] from God. You've forsaken his laws. Now,
[57:58] you're going to go and there's going to
[57:59] be 70 years in in Babylon. But watch how
[58:02] this is spoken now. He says, "Now the
[58:04] Lord God or the Lord has sent unto you
[58:07] all his servants the prophets rising
[58:09] early and sending them, but ye have not
[58:11] hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear.
[58:14] They said, "Turn ye again now, everyone
[58:16] from his evil way, and from the evil of
[58:18] your doings, and dwell in the land that
[58:20] the Lord hath given unto you, and to
[58:21] your fathers forever and ever. And go
[58:24] not after other gods to serve them, and
[58:26] to worship them, and provoke me not to
[58:28] anger with the works of your hands, and
[58:30] I will do you no hurt."
[58:33] Now listen to what God says here. He
[58:35] says, "Yet ye have not hearkened unto
[58:39] me, sayeth the Lord." Now, in the last
[58:43] in the opening verse, it sounded like
[58:44] they weren't listening to the prophets.
[58:46] God says, "No, no, no, no, no. You
[58:48] aren't turning down men. You are turning
[58:50] down me. You weren't turning down their
[58:52] ministry. You weren't turning down their
[58:54] message. You are turning down my message
[58:56] to you. They spoke in my name because I
[58:59] told them what to say. Therefore, you
[59:01] did not reject them, you rejected me.
[59:03] Remember what Jesus says. He who you he
[59:06] who I send in my name, if you accept
[59:08] him, you accept me. If you refuse him,
[59:11] you refuse me. Okay? So, we see this
[59:13] here. It's God speaking to the people.
[59:16] The voice is a man's, but the message is
[59:18] God's. And so, you turn it down at your
[59:20] own peril. He says, "You have not
[59:22] hearkened unto me, sayeth the Lord, that
[59:24] you might provoke me to anger with the
[59:26] works of your hands to your own hurt.
[59:29] Therefore sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[59:30] because you have not heard my words.
[59:34] Amen. It's so easy so many times to
[59:36] think that it's just a minister
[59:38] speaking. It's just a prophet speaking.
[59:39] It's just a man speaking. But church, if
[59:42] the Holy Spirit has anointed that man to
[59:44] speak it, you turn it down at your
[59:47] peril. There's a price to be paid for
[59:50] rejecting what God brings to his people.
[59:52] Because once he tells you, he holds you
[59:54] accountable for it. If you're his child.
[59:57] If you're his child.
[59:59] And then watch what he says. He says, '
[1:00:00] Listen, I sent him. You didn't listen. I
[1:00:02] sent him. You didn't listen. And now
[1:00:03] here's the judgment. And this whole land
[1:00:05] shall be a desolation and an
[1:00:07] astonishment. And these nations shall
[1:00:09] serve the king of Babylon 70 years. He
[1:00:12] says, they're going to look at you and
[1:00:13] they're going to say, "What in the world
[1:00:14] happened to them? They were the chosen.
[1:00:17] They were the elect. They were the the
[1:00:19] best of the best. They had everything.
[1:00:20] God protected them. God kept them. And
[1:00:22] now look at them. There's nothing left."
[1:00:24] Why? They didn't hear his prophets.
[1:00:27] Then we have Elijah coming along here,
[1:00:30] remember? And he's warning of the
[1:00:31] drought as judgment for idolatry. First
[1:00:33] Kings 17, he's a judgment prophet. Then
[1:00:36] we have Isaiah come and now he brings
[1:00:38] the word of the Lord. He gives a
[1:00:39] prophecy of a savior coming by a virgin
[1:00:42] birth in Isaiah 7. And what's he doing?
[1:00:44] He's pointing to a junction in time.
[1:00:46] He's pointing to when there'll be a
[1:00:48] change in the dispensation.
[1:00:50] And he says these crazy words, "A virgin
[1:00:53] shall conceive."
[1:00:55] Church, I don't know if you could ever
[1:00:57] get me to say a virgin shall conceive.
[1:01:00] Why? Because it makes no sense. But
[1:01:02] remember, the prophet is not speaking
[1:01:04] his own ideas. He'll say things he
[1:01:07] doesn't want to say. He doesn't even
[1:01:09] understand, but he has to repeat the
[1:01:11] message that's given to him. Then we
[1:01:13] have Malachi would come forward and he
[1:01:15] would pre give a prophecy of an Elijah
[1:01:18] to forerun the the first coming of
[1:01:20] Christ and then the second coming of
[1:01:22] Christ. And then we have John would come
[1:01:24] prophesying and forrunning the first
[1:01:27] coming of Christ as well. So a junction
[1:01:29] in time as well. And so people will look
[1:01:32] at this and they'll say, "Well, duh. The
[1:01:34] Old Testament's full of prophets. That's
[1:01:36] an Old Testament thing. Since Christ
[1:01:38] came, we don't need prophets.
[1:01:41] He came, he preached the gospel, that's
[1:01:42] all we need." Well, we know that's
[1:01:44] untrue just by examining the scriptures
[1:01:46] themselves because the scripture points
[1:01:48] to New Testament prophets and we see
[1:01:50] that God never you never stops using
[1:01:52] them. But remember, Christ himself came
[1:01:54] as a prophet. Remember, God said, "I
[1:01:57] will raise up a prophet like unto your
[1:01:59] servant Moses." God in flesh came as a
[1:02:02] prophet to show that's the only way God
[1:02:04] works. He works through a prophet. Amen.
[1:02:08] But why do people say that? Why do
[1:02:09] people say, "Well, that was an Old
[1:02:11] Testament thing, not a New Testament
[1:02:13] thing." Well, I think it's because one,
[1:02:15] there's too many fakers out there.
[1:02:17] People with supposed gifts or people
[1:02:19] with this or people with that, and they
[1:02:20] go around and what do they do? They show
[1:02:22] off what they have, but they never lead
[1:02:24] the people anywhere. And eventually,
[1:02:27] what is it? It It's revealed that that
[1:02:29] man is in it, or that woman, as the case
[1:02:30] may be, they're in it for themselves.
[1:02:32] They want the Rolls-Royce. They want the
[1:02:34] big house. They want the big money. They
[1:02:35] want the private jet. They want the TV
[1:02:37] show. They want the the beautiful madeup
[1:02:40] Jezebel wife and all these different
[1:02:42] things. And almost always, or pretty
[1:02:44] much always, they fall into ruin because
[1:02:47] it comes out. They were in it for
[1:02:49] themselves.
[1:02:50] But the other thing is that there's the
[1:02:51] fanaticism that follows around it as
[1:02:53] well. You see it in charismatic circles
[1:02:55] and it becomes a farce and it becomes a
[1:02:57] show and somebody's up there showing off
[1:02:59] a gift that he has, but church he has no
[1:03:01] message. He's got a gift but he has no
[1:03:04] message. I remember brother Kingsley
[1:03:06] talking to me about this in the past
[1:03:08] where he said, "I I have friends and I
[1:03:09] know people that have these gifts, but
[1:03:11] he says,"I always noticed that in their
[1:03:13] churches the people never grew because
[1:03:15] all they were doing was resting on that
[1:03:16] man's gift rather than being led
[1:03:18] somewhere themselves." He wasn't feeding
[1:03:20] them what they had need to do. Amen. But
[1:03:23] the the simple truth is that most of
[1:03:24] these people are not true prophets.
[1:03:26] They're people with gifts. Amen. Feeding
[1:03:28] on the gullible and the needy. But so
[1:03:30] often what happens is you don't need a
[1:03:32] prophet when you're set in your ways. If
[1:03:34] you're not going to change your mind no
[1:03:36] matter what, you don't need a prophet
[1:03:37] because prophets are there to get people
[1:03:39] to change their behavior. That's why God
[1:03:41] sends them is because people aren't
[1:03:43] doing usually what they need. And so,
[1:03:44] usually they're coming with a warning
[1:03:46] with judgment to follow. Like I said,
[1:03:48] the pope is the prophet to the Catholics
[1:03:50] and they don't need a prophet because
[1:03:51] they've already picked them. Doesn't
[1:03:53] matter that he says things different
[1:03:54] than the last one and the last one and
[1:03:56] the last one, the last one. It doesn't
[1:03:57] matter. They have them for their moment
[1:03:58] and that's it. And then in other
[1:04:00] churches, what happens is your doctrine
[1:04:01] becomes your prophet. I'll never make a
[1:04:03] change because this is our church
[1:04:04] doctrine and you never get to see the
[1:04:06] revealing of the word as it comes forth.
[1:04:08] But we look in the New Testament and I
[1:04:10] said this is a this is where this this
[1:04:12] idea that the the we don't need prophets
[1:04:14] in the New Testament just fails by
[1:04:16] examination of the scripture because we
[1:04:17] have the prophet Paul.
[1:04:20] He's a prophet. Amen. He he he gives us
[1:04:22] a prophecy of an end time rapture among
[1:04:24] other things. The resurrection of the
[1:04:26] saints. He's a word prophet. And in
[1:04:28] first Corinthians it says, "Behold, I
[1:04:30] show you a mystery. We shall not all
[1:04:32] sleep, but we shall all be changed in a
[1:04:34] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[1:04:35] the last trump. For the trumpet shall
[1:04:37] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[1:04:39] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[1:04:41] That's a prophecy. That's forwardlooking
[1:04:43] for Paul. So Paul is a prophet. Amen. We
[1:04:47] see John the Revelator. He's talking
[1:04:49] about the seven church ages, the
[1:04:50] mysteries of God. The whole book of
[1:04:52] Revelation is forwardlooking for John.
[1:04:55] He's a prophet. Amen. and he he gives a
[1:04:58] prophecy of of the the seven church
[1:05:00] ages, the mysteries of God, the prophecy
[1:05:02] of the seven messengers to the seven
[1:05:04] churches. So, he's giving us a junction
[1:05:06] in time, and he's giving us a warning of
[1:05:08] judgment. But I want us to catch
[1:05:09] something because we go all the way
[1:05:11] through the book of Revelation. We get
[1:05:12] into Revelation 19, and we see this
[1:05:15] beautiful marriage supper of the lamb,
[1:05:16] and this person that's talking to John,
[1:05:19] that's showing him all of these things.
[1:05:21] And then John, watch John's reaction
[1:05:23] because John's a prophet. and watch
[1:05:25] who's doing the talking to the prophet.
[1:05:27] And it says, "And I fell at his feet."
[1:05:29] So this this man that's been talking to
[1:05:30] him and showing him all these things,
[1:05:32] John falls at his feet to worship him.
[1:05:34] And he said unto me, "See thou do it
[1:05:37] not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:05:40] brethren that have the testimony of
[1:05:42] Christ."
[1:05:44] He says, "Worship God, for the testimony
[1:05:46] of Jesus is a spirit of prophecy." Then
[1:05:48] we go to the end of Revelation and it
[1:05:51] says, "And I, John, saw these things and
[1:05:54] heard them. And when I heard and saw and
[1:05:56] seen, I fell down to worship before the
[1:05:58] feet of the angel that show me these
[1:06:02] things." And then saith unto me, "See
[1:06:04] thou do it not, for I am thy fellow
[1:06:07] servant, and of thy brethren the
[1:06:10] prophets,
[1:06:12] and of them which keep the sayings of
[1:06:14] this book worship God." So even in the
[1:06:17] eternities where God is showing John
[1:06:20] this whole panorama in God's domain, God
[1:06:23] is still using a prophet to give the
[1:06:26] word.
[1:06:28] Even beyond time into eternity, there's
[1:06:31] still a prophet doing a prophet's work
[1:06:33] to give that word to show things that
[1:06:36] are to come. Amen. God's still working
[1:06:38] with a through a prophet to reveal these
[1:06:40] things to John and then John will go and
[1:06:42] reveal them to the rest of us. So, we
[1:06:44] can't say God doesn't use them in the
[1:06:45] New Testament because he literally
[1:06:47] finishes the Bible with a prophet
[1:06:49] talking to a prophet. So, we need
[1:06:52] prophets. Amen. We can see God has
[1:06:54] specifically used them from from from
[1:06:56] the Old Testament all the way through
[1:06:58] the New Testament, junctions in time,
[1:07:00] showing us where we're at. And we have a
[1:07:02] few dozen Old Testament prophets, that's
[1:07:04] for sure, primarily to the Jews. But
[1:07:06] then we have two New Testament prophets
[1:07:08] after Jesus that are primarily to the
[1:07:11] Gentiles. We have Paul and we have John
[1:07:13] the Revelator. And Paul says, "Hey, I
[1:07:15] got this gospel from the Holy Spirit."
[1:07:17] In other words, God spoke to him lip to
[1:07:20] ear to give him what we believe today.
[1:07:24] That's not a prophet. I don't know what
[1:07:26] he is. That he would come with the mind
[1:07:29] of God, the gospel. Amen. And so Paul
[1:07:31] would say, "This is thus sayeth the
[1:07:33] Lord, and the whole world is going to be
[1:07:34] judged by my gospel." Amen. That has to
[1:07:37] be a prophet to say that sort of thing.
[1:07:39] And then we know John's a prophet
[1:07:40] because he's showing the future and he's
[1:07:42] referred to as a fellow servant by a
[1:07:44] prophet from out of eternity. Amen. But
[1:07:47] now the thing is that people will say,
[1:07:49] well, we don't need prophets for a
[1:07:50] couple of scriptural reasons. And so we
[1:07:53] see that they talk about two things.
[1:07:54] They say the prophets were only needed
[1:07:56] until Jesus came and fulfilled the law.
[1:07:59] And then the second is that the prophets
[1:08:00] are to the Jews only or were only for
[1:08:03] Bible times. Now that second one's a lot
[1:08:06] trickier. The first one, eh, not so hard
[1:08:08] to disprove. But the second one, it's
[1:08:09] only for Bible times. But watch this
[1:08:13] because they'll use this one major
[1:08:14] scripture to say, well, it was only till
[1:08:16] Christ came. And they'll say, the law
[1:08:18] and the prophets were until John. And
[1:08:20] since that time, the kingdom of God is
[1:08:22] preached and every man pressth unto it.
[1:08:25] So in other words, the Old Testament was
[1:08:27] where God used prophets. But since then,
[1:08:29] we just preached the gospel. We have no
[1:08:31] need for prophets.
[1:08:33] So the argument is that as though after
[1:08:35] the law was brought and Christ fulfilled
[1:08:37] it, we don't need prophets anymore
[1:08:39] because Christ gave us the perfect
[1:08:40] gospel and that's all we have need of.
[1:08:42] And so if that is true, we shouldn't see
[1:08:45] a single prophet after Christ came. But
[1:08:47] when we look at the Bible, we see
[1:08:49] clearly there are prophets there. Amen.
[1:08:51] You've got Paul, you've got John, you've
[1:08:52] got Agabus, you've got these different
[1:08:54] ones. And and so um they we can see that
[1:08:59] it didn't stop just when Christ came.
[1:09:01] But the next one they'll say is this.
[1:09:03] They'll say, "God who at sunundry times
[1:09:04] and in diverse manner spake in times
[1:09:07] past unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:09:10] had in these last days spoken to us by
[1:09:13] his son whom he hath appointed heir of
[1:09:15] all things by whom he also made the
[1:09:18] word." So it's the scriptures used to
[1:09:20] suggest that God only used prophets till
[1:09:22] Christ came and since then he's spoken
[1:09:24] to us by Christ directly.
[1:09:26] Now again, if that's a true
[1:09:28] interpretation, we shouldn't see a
[1:09:29] single prophet after Jesus coming. Amen.
[1:09:32] But that's not the main evidence that
[1:09:34] God used people was just that Jesus came
[1:09:37] as a prophet. And we have Paul and these
[1:09:39] different ones there. We know that God
[1:09:41] used prophets by observation of the
[1:09:43] actual writers of the Bible. But we have
[1:09:45] to remember one key thing here. And we
[1:09:47] see this in Malachi 3. It says, "For I
[1:09:50] am the Lord, I change not."
[1:09:53] So in other words, when God puts it in,
[1:09:56] we don't take it out. Only he can take
[1:09:58] it out. There are things in the
[1:10:01] scripture that were to a point and then
[1:10:02] God says, "That's it. That's fulfilled.
[1:10:04] That's over with. And now we're moving
[1:10:05] into a new dispensation. We're moving
[1:10:07] into a grace covenant." Those different
[1:10:09] things. If God says it's over, then it's
[1:10:11] over. But if God starts it and never
[1:10:13] says, "I'm taking it out," then we don't
[1:10:15] get to take it out. That's a principle
[1:10:17] in the scriptures. Amen. So when God
[1:10:20] said in Amos 3:7, our opening scripture,
[1:10:22] that he wouldn't do anything unless he
[1:10:23] showed it to his prophets first, that
[1:10:25] stands tall until God says, "I'm done
[1:10:27] with prophets." But we will go all the
[1:10:29] way to the last chapter of the book of
[1:10:31] Revelation, and God's still using
[1:10:32] prophets. So we can't see he took them
[1:10:34] out in between. God's been using them
[1:10:37] all along. Amen. And so let's see what
[1:10:39] happens here. Let's look at the
[1:10:41] scriptures after Christ came to see what
[1:10:43] they say about prophets. So Paul would
[1:10:45] say this, "Whereby ye, when you read,
[1:10:48] you may understand my knowledge in the
[1:10:50] mystery of Christ, which in other ages
[1:10:52] was not made known unto the sons of man,
[1:10:54] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[1:10:57] apostles and prophets by the spirit." He
[1:11:01] says it's revealed now. See, people will
[1:11:04] say, "No, that was pointing to what the
[1:11:05] prophets foretold before." No, he says
[1:11:07] it's revealed now to his apostles and to
[1:11:10] his prophets. How? By the spirit.
[1:11:12] Remember it says, "Well, these things
[1:11:14] have been spoken to us by his son."
[1:11:15] Christ said, "I'm coming back." He's
[1:11:18] still speaking to us. It's by the
[1:11:19] spirit. So, these men know what they
[1:11:21] know. They're given what they're given
[1:11:23] by the spirit. It's still Christ
[1:11:24] speaking, but he's speaking it through
[1:11:26] men. But people will say, "Well, I don't
[1:11:29] need those men. I've got the Holy
[1:11:30] Spirit." Well, according to the
[1:11:31] scriptures, you need the apostles and
[1:11:32] the prophets because that's who's
[1:11:34] getting catching what the spirit is
[1:11:36] saying. Okay? He says that the Gentiles
[1:11:38] should be fellow heirs and of the same
[1:11:39] body and partakers of his promise in
[1:11:42] Christ by the gospel. Notice what he's
[1:11:43] saying. He's saying we've got a junction
[1:11:45] in time here. And what has been revealed
[1:11:48] is that this is not for the Jews, but it
[1:11:50] is for the Gentiles also. And really in
[1:11:52] the end, we'll see shortly it's mostly
[1:11:54] to the Gentiles. And the only way they
[1:11:57] could turn that corner was the Holy
[1:11:58] Spirit came and showed that to them.
[1:12:00] They'd have never made the corner.
[1:12:02] They'd have never made the corner
[1:12:03] because they were so steeped in
[1:12:04] tradition. But what happened is the
[1:12:06] spirit comes to them and so they
[1:12:08] realize, hey, this is for everyone. And
[1:12:09] remember what Peter shared. He went to
[1:12:11] the house of Cornelius. The spirit of
[1:12:13] God came, filled them, and they had the
[1:12:14] same experience as the Pentecostals did.
[1:12:17] And then they go to Samaria and they get
[1:12:18] the same thing. And they're like, "Wow,
[1:12:20] this is great. Everybody's got it. We
[1:12:21] accept it. Why? By the spirit. The
[1:12:24] spirit revealed those things." So Paul's
[1:12:26] writing this long after Christ has left
[1:12:28] the word. And he's saying, listen, God
[1:12:30] is still using apostles and prophets by
[1:12:33] the Holy Spirit to speak to his people.
[1:12:36] So Paul himself a prophet is proof that
[1:12:38] God used prophets after Jesus left. But
[1:12:41] then that prophet speaks of prophets as
[1:12:43] well after the Holy Ghost fell at
[1:12:45] Pentecost. In Ephesians 2,
[1:12:47] this is what we call
[1:12:50] the five-fold ministry. Amen. We'll see
[1:12:52] this in in here and in in uh 1
[1:12:54] Corinthians. He says, "Now ye are
[1:12:56] therefore no more strangers and
[1:12:57] foreigners, but fellow citizens with the
[1:12:59] saints and of the household of God, and
[1:13:02] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:13:04] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[1:13:06] himself being the chief cornerstone."
[1:13:09] He says, "In whom all the building fitly
[1:13:11] framed together groweth unto an holy
[1:13:13] temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are
[1:13:15] builded together for inhabitation of God
[1:13:17] through the spirit." So God is still
[1:13:20] speaking to us by his son, but it's
[1:13:21] through the spirit. Remember, he came
[1:13:24] back It it was so amazing. We were, you
[1:13:26] know, I was talking earlier about how
[1:13:27] how denominations have blinded
[1:13:29] themselves and and where John MacArthur
[1:13:31] was talking about cessationism and he
[1:13:33] was saying, you know, the 12 apostles
[1:13:35] and he put Mattheus as the 12th apostle.
[1:13:37] How can you do that? God said, "I've
[1:13:40] chosen one. You chose one. It wasn't my
[1:13:42] choosing. I've got my apostle." Paul was
[1:13:45] an apostle. He was the 12th apostle. But
[1:13:47] he couldn't see these things. Why?
[1:13:48] Because he's not led by the spirit.
[1:13:51] That's a sad thing to say. I respect
[1:13:53] John MacArthur for everything he's
[1:13:54] taught and for his stand for the gospel,
[1:13:56] but the limitations there because he's
[1:13:58] bound in a denomination and it's a
[1:14:00] sadness. He understands so many things,
[1:14:03] but there are things that are so basic
[1:14:04] and yet he can't see it. Why? Because
[1:14:06] he's got his mind capped because he's
[1:14:08] believed what a do denomination has
[1:14:10] said. It's people speaking by the
[1:14:13] spirit. Paul ordained a five-fold
[1:14:16] ministry. We see it in 1 Corinthians. It
[1:14:18] says, "And God has set some in the
[1:14:20] church, first apostles, secondarily
[1:14:22] prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
[1:14:24] miracles and gifts of healing, helps,
[1:14:27] governments, diversities of tongues."
[1:14:30] Look at this again. Ephesians 4. And he
[1:14:32] gave some apostles and some prophets and
[1:14:36] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:14:39] teachers. What's the purpose? Why did he
[1:14:41] give this? What are they trying to
[1:14:44] achieve? He says, "For the perfecting of
[1:14:46] the saints, for the work of the
[1:14:48] ministry, for the edifying of the body
[1:14:50] of Christ." Okay. Well, that was only
[1:14:52] for the days of the apostles, brother
[1:14:54] John. No, no, no. He says they're going
[1:14:56] to do this until we all come in the
[1:14:59] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:15:01] of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
[1:15:04] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:15:06] fullness of Christ until the the the
[1:15:09] reality of Christ is revealed in a body.
[1:15:13] You see why I can't preach Revelation
[1:15:15] 10:7 until we establish this? Because
[1:15:17] you got to realize there's a five-fold
[1:15:19] ministry that's taking us to that place.
[1:15:22] And it's ordained by the spirit. This is
[1:15:25] not Paul. This is the Holy Spirit
[1:15:27] speaking to the church. Amen. So we see
[1:15:31] prophets are a critical part of the
[1:15:33] perfecting of the church, the edifying
[1:15:35] of the body all the way until we come to
[1:15:37] the unity of the the faith where we are
[1:15:39] and we have exactly what he promised.
[1:15:42] So, we would establish these things. God
[1:15:44] only uses a prophet to reveal the word
[1:15:46] of the Lord. God uses them in the Old
[1:15:48] New Testament. God definitely didn't
[1:15:50] stop using prophets after Jesus first
[1:15:52] coming. And he ordained them in the New
[1:15:54] Testament as part of the five-fold
[1:15:56] ministry to the true church of God. But
[1:15:58] you go talk to somebody, they say,
[1:15:59] "Well, sure, we believe in prophets, but
[1:16:01] they're for the Jews. They're not for
[1:16:04] the Gentiles." We see God using Jew
[1:16:06] prophets with the Jews constantly in the
[1:16:08] Old Testament, but the but the Gentiles
[1:16:10] are different. But again, we look into
[1:16:12] the scriptures and we see that there is
[1:16:14] actually a prophet to the Gentiles. And
[1:16:17] then Paul was clearly sent to the
[1:16:19] Gentiles. He was a Jew, but he was sent
[1:16:20] to the Gentiles. And in Acts 13, he's
[1:16:23] preached and he's tried and the Jews
[1:16:24] have rejected him. And then Paul and
[1:16:26] Barnabas, it says, wax bold and said,
[1:16:28] "It was necessary that the word of God
[1:16:29] should first have been spoken to you, to
[1:16:31] the Jews. But seeing you put it from you
[1:16:34] and judge yourselves unworthy of
[1:16:35] everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
[1:16:38] Gentiles." And Paul goes and he turns
[1:16:40] and he goes and he preaches to the
[1:16:41] Gentiles the rest of his life. Why?
[1:16:43] Because the Jews turned it down. So he
[1:16:45] sent specifically and God said, "I've
[1:16:47] called you to be a messenger to the
[1:16:49] Gentiles." Amen. Then we look at John
[1:16:52] the Revelator. Amen. Wrote the book of
[1:16:55] Revelation and wrote a message to the
[1:16:57] Gentile churches through seven church
[1:16:59] ages. Literally the first third of the
[1:17:02] book of Revelation is meant primarily
[1:17:04] for Gentiles. Has nothing to do with
[1:17:06] Jews. Nothing at all to do with the
[1:17:08] Jews. Amen. There are end time Jews
[1:17:10] included, of course, in the in the book
[1:17:12] of Revelation, but the primary purpose
[1:17:14] there is to reveal what God's doing for
[1:17:16] our bride. And the bride is gentile. The
[1:17:19] bride is gentile. Amen. And so, we have
[1:17:21] two very big, very important prophets
[1:17:24] specifically to the Gentiles in the New
[1:17:27] Testament. But then we read of other
[1:17:29] prophets and other messengers coming to
[1:17:30] the Gentile churches. The biggest is the
[1:17:32] one we find in Revelation chapter 1, and
[1:17:35] it's the seven stars. And it says, "And
[1:17:37] I turned to see the voice that spoke to
[1:17:39] me. And being turned, I saw seven golden
[1:17:41] candlesticks. And in the midst of these,
[1:17:43] the seven candlesticks, one like under
[1:17:45] the Son of Man, clothed with a garment
[1:17:47] down to the foot, gird about the paps
[1:17:49] with a golden girdle. His head and his
[1:17:51] hairs were white like wool, as white as
[1:17:53] snow, and his eyes were as a flame of
[1:17:55] fire. And his feet like undefined
[1:17:57] breast, as if they burned in a furnace,
[1:17:59] and his voice was as the sound of many
[1:18:02] waters.
[1:18:03] And he had in his right hand. Okay,
[1:18:05] right hand is always power and
[1:18:07] authority. And he had in his right hand
[1:18:09] seven stars. And out of his mouth went a
[1:18:12] sharp two-edged sword. The word is
[1:18:14] always a two-edged sword in scriptures.
[1:18:16] So what's coming out of his mouth is the
[1:18:18] word. But what's his power and authority
[1:18:20] is what's in his hand. Seven stars. And
[1:18:22] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[1:18:25] in his strength. So there's this mystery
[1:18:27] here in verse 16. And then we jump to
[1:18:29] verse 20. And he shows us exactly what
[1:18:31] those seven stars represent. He says,
[1:18:33] "The mystery of the seven stars which
[1:18:35] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[1:18:38] seven candlesticks." He says, "The seven
[1:18:40] stars are the angels of the seven
[1:18:43] churches. And the seven candlesticks
[1:18:45] which thou sawest are the seven
[1:18:47] churches." So there are seven angels in
[1:18:50] seven churches. Seven church ages. We'll
[1:18:54] see. Amen. And so when we look at that,
[1:18:56] we see that we have these seven church
[1:18:58] ages. Amen. And so these are not angel
[1:19:01] messengers that have wings that come
[1:19:02] down from heaven. That's what we have to
[1:19:04] get out of our mind. Amen. These are
[1:19:06] earthly messengers to seven churches to
[1:19:09] seven gentile churches that span from
[1:19:11] Christ's death all the way to the
[1:19:13] rapture of the bride of Christ. Now
[1:19:16] people would look at that and say,
[1:19:17] "Well, how do you know they're
[1:19:18] Gentiles?" Well, there's a couple things
[1:19:19] that stand out. First of all, all of the
[1:19:22] churches are Gentile cities. There's not
[1:19:25] a single Israel or Jewish city in there.
[1:19:28] We've got Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos,
[1:19:30] Thotyra, Sardis, Philadelphia, and
[1:19:32] Leosa. And they are all gentile cities,
[1:19:34] not a Jew city among them. But we also
[1:19:37] know that God never deals directly with
[1:19:39] two groups at the same time. God doesn't
[1:19:42] deal with the Jews and the Gentiles
[1:19:43] simultaneously. Paul and his message
[1:19:45] were to the world, but specifically to
[1:19:47] the Gentiles since the Jews turned it
[1:19:49] down. And God doesn't turn back to the
[1:19:51] Jews until he's taken his Gentile bride.
[1:19:54] Okay. the 144,000 are saved in the
[1:19:58] tribulation after God has taken his
[1:20:00] bride away. That's when God turns to
[1:20:02] them and he sends them prophets. So,
[1:20:05] he's got a prophet for us and he's got
[1:20:07] prophets for them. He'll send back the
[1:20:09] spirit of Moses and Elijah. And we'll
[1:20:11] get into that maybe at a different time.
[1:20:13] Amen. But we see this typed in the past.
[1:20:15] Remember when Joseph went and he took a
[1:20:18] gentile bride and produced life in her.
[1:20:22] But when he was restored to relationship
[1:20:24] to his brothers, he put her safely in
[1:20:26] the palace. So before he went and was
[1:20:29] restored to relationship uh with his
[1:20:31] brethren, he put his wife in the palace
[1:20:33] behind him safely. And then he dealt
[1:20:36] with them. Amen. God has prophets coming
[1:20:38] for the Jews later, but he's got a
[1:20:40] prophet. He's got messengers to the
[1:20:41] Gentiles in this time. So if we want
[1:20:44] further proof that these men are earthly
[1:20:46] messengers, we can look forward to
[1:20:48] Revelation 4. And it says this, "And out
[1:20:51] of the throne proceeded lightnings and
[1:20:53] thunderings and voices, and there were
[1:20:55] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[1:20:58] throne, which are the seven spirits of
[1:21:00] God." So we've got seven stars, seven
[1:21:03] shining objects. Amen. We see here seven
[1:21:06] spirits that are said as being seven
[1:21:08] lamps. And if we jump forward to
[1:21:10] Revelation 5, we can get a further clue.
[1:21:12] It says, "And I behold, and lo, in the
[1:21:14] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:21:16] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[1:21:18] stood a lamb as it had been slain,
[1:21:20] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[1:21:22] are the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[1:21:25] where?" into all the earth. So these are
[1:21:29] earthly messengers. They are not
[1:21:31] heavenly messengers. These seven things,
[1:21:33] their lamps, their eyes, their spirits.
[1:21:35] And that last verse kind of helps us a
[1:21:37] bit because it shows us that these
[1:21:39] spirits are not stationary around God's
[1:21:41] throne, but rather they are sent from
[1:21:43] the presence of God to the earth. But we
[1:21:46] still don't know what they are according
[1:21:47] to the scripture. But remember, John the
[1:21:50] Revelator when it came to what he was uh
[1:21:52] writing here, he always used the Old
[1:21:54] Testament imagery and symbols. Same
[1:21:57] things that Daniel did. Remember he he
[1:21:59] Daniel would talk about beasts and he
[1:22:01] would talk about horns and he would talk
[1:22:02] about heads. And John's coming and he's
[1:22:04] showing the same thing. He's using the
[1:22:06] same imagery. So if we go back to the
[1:22:08] Old Testament, we can see what these
[1:22:10] things are. And so we see in Proverbs
[1:22:12] 20, it says, "The spirit of man is the
[1:22:15] candle of the Lord searching all the
[1:22:17] inward parts of the belly." That word
[1:22:19] candle is actually lamp. So he says,
[1:22:21] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the
[1:22:23] Lord." Then we jump forward to Zechariah
[1:22:27] 4 and it says, "For who had despised the
[1:22:29] day of small things? For they shall
[1:22:31] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[1:22:33] hands of Zerubbable with those seven.
[1:22:36] They are the eyes of the Lord which run
[1:22:38] to and fro through the whole earth. So
[1:22:41] these are spirits that are moving back
[1:22:43] and forth across the world. And then we
[1:22:45] look in the book of John and Jesus
[1:22:47] speaking of John the Baptist, he would
[1:22:49] say, "He was a burning and a shining
[1:22:51] light and ye were willing for a season
[1:22:53] to rejoice in his light." And isn't that
[1:22:55] the truth?
[1:22:57] When these messengers came, and I know
[1:23:00] I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit
[1:23:01] here, but when these messengers came,
[1:23:03] people rejoiced in the moment for it,
[1:23:06] but then it became a burden. Then it
[1:23:07] denominated. Then the the the the
[1:23:10] struggle became too hard or things got
[1:23:12] in their way. And all of a sudden, they
[1:23:13] weren't so happy for it. As the light
[1:23:15] grew, more and more people go away
[1:23:19] because it reveals something about them
[1:23:20] they don't want to see.
[1:23:23] Amen.
[1:23:24] So what we see here is that in the Old
[1:23:26] Testament and in the New Testament,
[1:23:28] these seven spirits, these seven lamps,
[1:23:30] these seven eyes are all one and the
[1:23:31] same thing. There's seven men, there's
[1:23:33] seven messengers that God uses to speak
[1:23:36] to his people. And so we see that
[1:23:39] they're sent now to the seven church
[1:23:40] ages. We'll see it as we get into the
[1:23:42] next service in Revelation 2 and
[1:23:44] Revelation 3. Then all we have left to
[1:23:46] do tonight is we have to say, well,
[1:23:48] what's what church age are we in then?
[1:23:51] If we know that they're gentile
[1:23:52] messengers, if we know that they're
[1:23:53] earthly messengers, if we know they're
[1:23:55] sent to the gentile churches, then all
[1:23:57] we got to figure out is which church are
[1:23:58] we? And then once we know what church
[1:24:01] age we are, then we just have to say,
[1:24:03] well, what does this person look like?
[1:24:04] What's he supposed to do? And we can
[1:24:06] find our messenger and that will take us
[1:24:07] into overcoming because that's what you
[1:24:10] have to do. You have to hear what the
[1:24:11] spirit's say saying so you can overcome
[1:24:13] for your age. So we got to look and
[1:24:15] we've got to figure out who this person
[1:24:17] is. What's his anointed purpose? And so
[1:24:19] we look at the seven church ages and for
[1:24:22] the sake of time I'll just do it briefly
[1:24:24] before we close this evening. This will
[1:24:26] no doubt set a record for shortest
[1:24:27] church service by brother John. I'm on
[1:24:30] my last page of notes but we look in
[1:24:32] Revelation 3 and it says and unto the
[1:24:33] angel of the church of the leadyans
[1:24:36] write. So the leadyian church is the
[1:24:38] last one. It's the seventh one. These
[1:24:40] things sayeth the amen the faithful and
[1:24:42] true witness the beginning of the
[1:24:44] creation of God. I know thy works that
[1:24:46] thou art neither cold nor hot. I would,
[1:24:49] thou art cold or hot. So then, because
[1:24:51] thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor
[1:24:53] hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[1:24:55] Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[1:24:57] increase with goods, and have need of
[1:24:59] nothing, and knowest not that thou art
[1:25:01] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and
[1:25:04] naked. In other words, this is a church
[1:25:07] that says they have everything. And yet,
[1:25:09] when you compare them to what the word
[1:25:10] says a church should be, they have
[1:25:12] nothing. Church, if that isn't the day
[1:25:14] we're living in, I don't know what day
[1:25:15] it is. It's it's absolutely sick what
[1:25:19] the church has become. And I speak of
[1:25:21] the nominal church. What they profess to
[1:25:23] be the gospel, what they profess to be
[1:25:25] the love of God, what they profess to be
[1:25:26] the truth has nothing that reflects the
[1:25:29] true word of God. You can't go into an
[1:25:32] actual church these days in most places
[1:25:34] and preach out of this Bible because
[1:25:37] they don't believe it the way it's
[1:25:38] written. They've turned it into
[1:25:40] something else. Amen. So, there can be
[1:25:43] no doubt, I believe, in our mind that
[1:25:44] we're in the last church age. It's been
[1:25:46] 2,000 years since Christ left and all
[1:25:48] we've seen is a church that went down,
[1:25:50] down, down, down. Lost everything that
[1:25:53] the original church. We look around, we
[1:25:55] say, where is a powerful anointed church
[1:25:57] today in the world? There is none. There
[1:26:00] is none. It doesn't exist. Amen. And so,
[1:26:03] what's happened is that church went
[1:26:05] down, down, down, and God started a
[1:26:06] restoration work. And we're at the end
[1:26:08] of restoration. But by the time God is
[1:26:11] restoring everything, the church nominal
[1:26:13] has gone completely into darkness. They
[1:26:15] have nothing of him. We look in
[1:26:17] Revelations 3:20 and it says, "Behold, I
[1:26:19] stand at the door and knock. He's
[1:26:22] knocking to get into what he was in all
[1:26:24] the time. He's left. They put him out."
[1:26:28] He's a gentleman. He won't stay where
[1:26:29] he's not he's not he's not wanted. And
[1:26:33] so, what was it listening to brother
[1:26:35] Brandham speaking on the rapture and he
[1:26:37] says the life went through it, but the
[1:26:38] life carried on and they stayed behind.
[1:26:41] It wasn't that God didn't use it. God
[1:26:43] used it, but God kept revealing himself.
[1:26:45] God kept growing. God kept restoring
[1:26:48] back. But people put a period behind
[1:26:50] everything they they they believe and
[1:26:51] they they put a period behind their
[1:26:53] experience. And God says, "Sorry, you
[1:26:54] got to walk with me. You can't stand
[1:26:57] still. You got to walk with me. You got
[1:26:58] to move on." That's a that's something
[1:27:00] we need to remember for our day-to-day
[1:27:01] lives. We don't live by yesterday's
[1:27:03] experience. We live by his life today.
[1:27:05] Every day, we live by our relationship
[1:27:07] with him, by what he's doing inside of
[1:27:09] our lives. And so we see here, God,
[1:27:10] Christ is no longer in a church body in
[1:27:13] terms of a nominal church. Amen. He's
[1:27:15] outside any particular group or
[1:27:17] congregation and now he's individually
[1:27:19] knocking on people's lives and they're
[1:27:21] the ones that have to let him in. And
[1:27:23] you'll notice the only ones that can let
[1:27:24] him in are the ones that have left the
[1:27:26] system as well. It's the only way that
[1:27:28] they can do it. We look at that word
[1:27:30] leadya and it means people's rights. And
[1:27:32] that's absolutely the defining feature
[1:27:33] of the world today. We've got rights for
[1:27:36] everything except things we should have
[1:27:38] rights for. Amen. It's it's the
[1:27:41] characteristic of people in society
[1:27:42] today. Everyone has rights that are
[1:27:44] protected no matter how silly, how
[1:27:46] nonsensical, how made up they are. And
[1:27:48] common sense is completely out the door
[1:27:49] today. Nothing left. Amen. When men can
[1:27:52] call themselves women and women can call
[1:27:54] themselves men regardless of what they
[1:27:56] were born. Church, we come to ludicrous
[1:28:00] ludicrous positions in the church
[1:28:02] because it's churches that are preaching
[1:28:03] it now. Amen. what's normal and what's
[1:28:07] acceptable now is what the scripture
[1:28:09] calls evil and unacceptable.
[1:28:11] Amen. We've come to a place where the
[1:28:13] rights of the people to be what they are
[1:28:15] has superseded what the word has offered
[1:28:16] them. And so Christ is left outside the
[1:28:19] church with nothing to do. Amen. So if
[1:28:21] we're living in the seventh church age
[1:28:23] in the latest church age, then we must
[1:28:25] be looking for a messenger for that
[1:28:27] church age because he's prophesied in
[1:28:30] Revelation 1. There's got to be a
[1:28:32] messenger to that seventh church age.
[1:28:34] Amen. It was prophesied in Revelations
[1:28:36] 1, the seven stars in the hand.
[1:28:38] Revelation 4 and 5, one of the seven
[1:28:40] spirits of God. And so the question we
[1:28:42] have to answer is what is he supposed to
[1:28:44] do? What is he supposed to look like?
[1:28:46] What's his ministry supposed to be like?
[1:28:48] How do we identify him? And are there
[1:28:50] signs or IDs that would tell us whether
[1:28:52] that man is the one that we're looking
[1:28:54] for? And when we find him, we stick with
[1:28:57] his message. That's the overcoming that
[1:29:00] we're looking for. Amen. God bless you.
[1:29:03] That's it. You say 53 minutes. That
[1:29:06] beats it by one minute. One minute
[1:29:08] record. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[1:29:09] this morning.
[1:29:11] Amen. I trust this was mostly familiar,
[1:29:15] but not everyone has heard this to the
[1:29:16] depth maybe that we're going. And I
[1:29:18] want, like I said, to establish this in
[1:29:20] the scriptures. I won't read any quotes.
[1:29:22] This is so that you can take it or leave
[1:29:24] it. Frankly, that's what we're doing
[1:29:26] here tonight is so that you can say,
[1:29:28] "Hey, I believe that God sent a
[1:29:30] prophet." Or you say, "I don't believe
[1:29:32] God sent a prophet." And if you don't
[1:29:33] believe God sent a prophet, church,
[1:29:35] there's not much point in staying here
[1:29:37] because I preach a prophet. I preach a
[1:29:39] prophet's message by the word. I take it
[1:29:42] back to the word. I mean, you've seen me
[1:29:44] here. You've seen me stand. You see how
[1:29:45] many scriptures I present, but I'm
[1:29:47] running it through a prophetic filter of
[1:29:49] a message that God sent us to restore us
[1:29:51] back to what had been lost through all
[1:29:53] those years. That's why what we preach
[1:29:55] is so different. That's why we look so
[1:29:57] different. It's why we act so different
[1:29:58] is because we're being restored back to
[1:30:00] what was lost. We're not here to stand
[1:30:02] up for our rights. We're not here to
[1:30:04] make things the way we want them to be.
[1:30:06] But we're here to surrender ourselves so
[1:30:07] that God can produce what he produced in
[1:30:10] that first church age. Amen. Amen. God
[1:30:12] bless you. Let's bow our heads. Lord
[1:30:15] Jesus, Lord, we are thankful this
[1:30:18] evening, Lord, for your clarity in your
[1:30:20] word, Lord, that we're not just blindly
[1:30:23] believing, Heavenly Father, but we have
[1:30:24] a foundation for what we believe, Lord
[1:30:27] God. Lord, and I pray that what's been
[1:30:29] said tonight, Lord, that it would help
[1:30:30] anyone that's got a question, that's
[1:30:32] wondering, Lord, that's struggling to
[1:30:34] whether or not to believe fully what we
[1:30:36] preach in this church. Lord, we're not
[1:30:39] ashamed. Lord, we're not ashamed. We
[1:30:41] proudly identify ourselves, Lord, with
[1:30:44] an end time message that brought us back
[1:30:45] to the full truth of what Paul preached.
[1:30:48] Lord, we're not preaching a new message.
[1:30:50] We're preaching the original message.
[1:30:52] Lord, we're preaching the gospel as it
[1:30:53] was brought in its unadulterated form.
[1:30:55] And Lord, we don't want to lose any of
[1:30:57] its power. We don't want to lose any of
[1:30:59] its effect. Lord, we want everything
[1:31:01] that you would have for us by your word,
[1:31:03] Lord. And so we preach the whole thing.
[1:31:04] And where we fall short, Lord, we say,
[1:31:06] raise us up, Lord. Help us to surrender.
[1:31:09] Help us to lay ourselves down. Help us
[1:31:11] to lay aside every little thing that
[1:31:13] easily besets us, Lord, so we can
[1:31:15] receive what you have for us, Lord. I
[1:31:17] want overcoming power. I want overcoming
[1:31:19] faith, Lord. And I believe it's through
[1:31:21] a prophet message that we receive it.
[1:31:23] Lord, that comes and points us back to a
[1:31:25] rapturing faith word, Lord, that will
[1:31:28] take us off this earth without seeing
[1:31:29] death. Lord, I pray you help us to stand
[1:31:32] on what we know. Lord, to look for what
[1:31:34] you're opening, Lord. What I preached
[1:31:36] today is not what I preached yesterday
[1:31:38] or last month or last year. Lord, it's
[1:31:40] always opening. And I'm so thankful for
[1:31:42] that. But Lord, help us not to be so
[1:31:44] stuck, Lord, that we can't see what
[1:31:46] you're doing and what you're trying to
[1:31:47] do in this day and in this age. Lord,
[1:31:50] bless your people, Lord, for their
[1:31:51] faithfulness. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:31:53] name we ask it. Amen.
[1:32:00] You know that song, The Greatest Love
[1:32:01] Story, 1065,
[1:32:04] uh, So I'm Casting All My Cares on You.
[1:32:07] I think we've sung it before. If we
[1:32:09] don't know it. Yeah. Yeah. Just the
[1:32:11] chorus is fine.
[1:32:27] So I'm casting all my cares on you.
[1:32:33] I know you love me.
[1:32:40] Redemption by blood.
[1:32:45] Oh, that's the greatest love story
[1:32:53] for restoration,
[1:32:56] full redemption. That's what seven
[1:32:59] angels in a cloud,
[1:33:02] they testify.
[1:33:04] My redeemer is no longer dead. He's
[1:33:09] risen
[1:33:10] and he's coming back for you and me.
[1:33:16] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[1:33:23] I know
[1:33:25] you love me.
[1:33:30] Redemption by blood.
[1:33:35] That's the greatest love story.
[1:33:42] And full restoration,
[1:33:45] full redemption. That's what seven
[1:33:49] angels in a cloud. They testify.
[1:33:54] My redeemer is no longer dead. He's
[1:33:57] risen
[1:34:00] and he's coming back for you and me. One
[1:34:03] more time.
[1:34:05] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[1:34:12] I know you love me.
[1:34:19] Redemption by blood.
[1:34:24] That's the greatest love story.
[1:34:31] And for restoration,
[1:34:35] for redemption, that's what seven angels
[1:34:39] in a cloud
[1:34:41] testify
[1:34:42] that my redeemer is no longer dead. He's
[1:34:47] risen
[1:34:49] and he's coming back for you and me.
[1:34:55] He's got it all in control. 11:16.
[1:35:01] He's got it all
[1:35:04] in control.
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:10] He's got it all
[1:35:13] in control.
[1:35:18] for he's put that reassur
[1:35:23] way down in my soul.
[1:35:29] He's got it all in control.
[1:35:35] [Music]

[1:35:46] My father knows what I need.
[1:35:54] Everything I go through,
[1:35:58] he knows what's best for me.
[1:36:05] My father knows what I need.
[1:36:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:13] I put my life in his hands.
[1:36:19] Yes. Amen.
[1:36:21] I put my life in his hands.
[1:36:29] So every road I walk down,
[1:36:33] I'm sure it's in his plan.
[1:36:39] Amen. I put my life in his hands
[1:36:48] and he's got it all in control.
[1:36:53] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:56] He's got it all in control.
[1:37:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] way down in my soul.
[1:37:15] He's got it all in control. Bless the
[1:37:21] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:37:24] My father knows what I need.
[1:37:30] Amen.
[1:37:32] And my father knows. Praise the Lord.

[1:37:56] life Amen.

[1:38:28] life in his hand.
[1:38:33] Amen. Praise the Lord. 12:32
[1:38:38] giving my life away.
[1:38:42] Amen.
[1:38:45] I've seen a vision
[1:38:49] harsh and sweet
[1:38:53] of one who gave all he had for me.
[1:39:00] I've seen the passion
[1:39:03] of his death
[1:39:07] and the forgiveness
[1:39:10] of his final bre.
[1:39:22] My heart has been forever
[1:39:27] changed.
[1:39:29] I want to live
[1:39:32] my life
[1:39:34] and give the away
[1:39:38] he gave.
[1:39:43] And now I'm giving my life
[1:39:48] away.
[1:39:53] laying it down on the altar.
[1:39:58] Now I'm giving my life

[1:40:53] the cost. Amen.
[1:40:56] Next to the blood
[1:40:58] of Calary's
[1:41:00] cross.
[1:41:03] And if I live, I live for him. Amen. Or
[1:41:10] if I die, I count
[1:41:15] again.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:44:56] we go. 10:27
[1:44:59] Your land.
[1:45:01] I'm kind of homesick for a country.
[1:45:05] It's not hard to feel homesick for that
[1:45:07] country when we see the condition of the
[1:45:09] world. Brother John described it
[1:45:11] tonight.
[1:45:12] That's just the tip of the iceberg, I
[1:45:14] believe.
[1:45:16] Amen. So, let's just sing this.
[1:45:19] Just going to ask brother Kingsley to
[1:45:21] come and close in prayer tonight. Amen.
[1:45:23] Just remember to pray for that mentioned
[1:45:26] earlier. May God be with each and
[1:45:28] everyone and remember uh Fabian Walsh
[1:45:31] tonight as well. and uh may God be uh be
[1:45:35] with him and open his heart to see the
[1:45:38] the truth that's been lived before him.
[1:45:41] So let's uh remember that those not with
[1:45:44] us tonight, Brother Joe was sick. I
[1:45:46] don't know if I mentioned that earlier,
[1:45:47] but he wasn't feeling well. So let's
[1:45:49] remember him. And of course, Brother
[1:45:52] Chad and Sister Leah and all the others.
[1:45:54] So grace to each one. Let's just sing
[1:45:56] this and brother Kings will close.
[1:46:00] I'm kind of
[1:46:07] sick for
[1:46:09] a country
[1:46:14] to which I've never
[1:46:22] been
[1:46:23] before.
[1:46:28] No sad goodbye
[1:46:34] or will there be spoken?
[1:46:40] Amen.
[1:46:42] for time or raal.
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:47:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:02] my longing
[1:47:04] for
[1:47:06] you.
[1:47:10] And someday
[1:47:16] on day I'll stand
[1:47:23] there. My home
[1:47:29] shall be
[1:47:32] eternal.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:43] Sweet
[1:47:45] love.
[1:47:50] I love you now.
[1:47:57] across

[1:50:39] Let us pray. Our
[1:50:42] heavenly father, we thank you for this
[1:50:45] day.
[1:50:47] We thank you for your grace that is upon
[1:50:49] us,
[1:50:50] for the love that you have poured upon
[1:50:52] us. Thank you, Lord, for you have been
[1:50:55] guiding us this time of creation,
[1:50:59] sending us messages,
[1:51:02] sending us prophets.
[1:51:05] You have always shown your love even in
[1:51:09] times when we are facing the wrong right
[1:51:12] wrong direction. You've always been
[1:51:14] there for us to correct us and to bring
[1:51:17] us back to you. It's all your work and
[1:51:21] it is all you involved.
[1:51:23] There is no love better or greater than
[1:51:27] the love you've shown us.
[1:51:29] And in even in our confusion, you have
[1:51:32] given us clarity. You've given us a word
[1:51:34] that is a road map to our salvation.
[1:51:39] You've given us prophets to clarify
[1:51:44] your words and your works.
[1:51:48] And daily you have shown in our
[1:51:50] individual lives that you reign. We
[1:51:52] thank you for the word that you have
[1:51:54] spoken through our pastor this evening,
[1:51:57] giving us more clarity and reminding us
[1:52:00] of who we are in you, oh Lord.
[1:52:04] We thank you Lord for the word. We pray
[1:52:07] for all the needs that are mentioned
[1:52:09] here today
[1:52:11] for healing that is needed. We know we
[1:52:13] have it already. We thank you Lord for
[1:52:14] healing. We pray for those that are not
[1:52:16] here. Be with them. Show them mercy and
[1:52:20] show them love. And as we leave the
[1:52:23] church today to our various homes we ask
[1:52:25] for journeyes and we ask for joy that
[1:52:29] will lighten our days.
[1:52:32] forever more in Jesus name we pray.
[1:52:35] Amen.
