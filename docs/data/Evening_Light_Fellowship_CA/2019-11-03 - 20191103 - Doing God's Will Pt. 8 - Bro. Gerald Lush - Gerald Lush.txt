this now a man in the present tense [Music] because the present tense God is here we have the present a man believeth now this hallelu praise the name of the Lord Amen hallelujah god bless return with me to first Peter chapter 3 verse Peter chapter 3 I was advised I don't know who advised me of that but there's certain of the Brethren when they're having a community for washing the pack apparently the pastor doesn't preach he just comes out and just ministers concerning communion foot washing and they just go in and do it that's it oh well I I don't think I'm that pastor I said so I said we'll see what what the Lord will do a man because even if we go through those the tapes of the prophet of the books of the Prophet the the recorded messages he he came out and he ministered and then they went into the communion a mat and so and far as I know it was all the way mainly all the way down through his ministry he didn't come out and lay the sermon aside no he came out and preached first and then went into the communion a mat so brothers sister why because we need that we need the challenge of the word amen and it's not just a challenge of first Corinthians 11 but the setting up of the communion no no no no God there's other things that God wants wants to challenge us with his word not only that there might be a brother here that got a need there might be a sister with a need maybe here or online are you on YouTube whatever but praying the grace of God will meet that need amen maybe it'll be a certain scripture that you're looking for maybe it'll be a certain thought that God through the ministry will explain and whatever it is again you know you know there's there's a reason for the fifl ministry and it's this and this and this and this a man and and and yet there are those that don't believe in the fivefold ministry that is that's the truth and they they just don't I just go to and hear their pastor and that's it and there's some wood even near the pastor and that is the truth you know just well I just gonna listen to the prophet may amazing brother and we think old gods from the Prophet for the opening the seven seals well they better go back to those seals again a man and go back to the questions and answers on the seals a Myatt because there's the in the questions and answers on the seals they asked a prophet of God does the bride have a ministry and he said yes he says been with her since the day of Pentecost and he said is the faithful ministry and he said it's right there he said she's got apostles and prophets and teachers and pastors and so on and so on it is for the perfecting of the saints and yet you've got so-called believers now they profess to believe but they really don't amen that's the truth they don't believe their brother because if you're gonna believe the the opening of the seven seals you got to believe the questions and answers on the seals a man so brother they believe the Prophet because to believe this the prophets are that they believe that the prophets are that but what about what he said about the fivefold ministry a man brother B and knowing that he said now he said you young ministers here he said he said he should be on your on your toes or whatever he said because you're going to have to you're gonna have to take this message on to the coming of the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord and that's just not that's just not the only the seven seals brother we're gonna take it on to there through the literal physical coming of the Lord the change of our body the resurrection the rapture a man so brother I pray grace God give us the revelation that we need a mayor guy and a God that was to recognize our need of the ministry and God help us to recognize who our pastor is a man by the grace of God well it's the Holy Ghost but he's going to come down and minister to a pastor I was like oh yeah praise the Lord bear with me and he said again somebody said oh brother Brown III don't need a teacher because the Holy Ghost is my teacher well brother brother had the brother he said he said the Holy Ghost uses the teacher he said he's got a teacher out there as part of the fivefold ministry and he uses the teacher to teach you a man he's not going to bypass the teacher he's he's gonna use the teacher a man and again he was dealing with those fears - you and I are dealing with people that don't believe in a fivefold ministry so the grace of God brother to help us amen to recognize and and respect the ministry that God got there God got over there a guy got somewhere else a man so god help us is my prayer so being prayer and I'll try not to be too long but again there's a number of things that I want to share with you and again you can go on and on and on until we blend into eternity a man by the grace of God and and that's why we're gonna oh yeah yeah we're gonna go on and on and the prophet of God said it's good they ours company so when it wouldn't meet wouldn't hurt us to meet every night yeah yeah so that that had all your God's gonna create that hunger and that thirst amen God's gonna create what it's gonna be it's gonna be there anything you're gonna want it amen now we're caught up we're busy with this with this with this but but there's hours coming when God's going to create that hunger that thirst and we're online come on we got to get together we got to get together why because you're gonna see so much happening out there and so much going on you know what we need you our faith to increase we need to get that faith Lord for the resurrection we need to get that faith for the rapture more and more and more by grace don't let us miss the rapture amen because somebody is going to miss it I pray it's not you and me amen somebody's going to miss the resurrection that's the way they're gonna be the ones to ask where's the rapture yeah yeah I mean it'll strike them it's already happened you didn't know it let's let's see what God is doing if they didn't know it then it's like God was doing something and they didn't know amen let's recognize what God's doing in you and in me amen in 1st Peter chapter 3 and verse 18 and this was Parvez text when he ministered on a very serious sermon in November 1963 and it's even more serious now and it was entitled souls that are imprisoned now a man not so that we're in prison souls that are in prison and we are ministering to souls in prison your your testimony is two souls in prison a man you're witnessing two souls in prison so brother that's as straight as it is and it's going to get worse and worse and worse till there's absolutely no seat of God out there to hear the word of God but there's going to be souls in prison so the grace of God brother that we're going to be the seed of God the right of Christ going into the resurrection of rapture not souls in prison for Christ also and once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit and by the Spirit and by the Holy Ghost it is to bring us back to God and by which also he went and he preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient souls in prison Jesus went and preached to them a man and when we know he went in to testify listen the Prophet said I was coming and Here I am you didn't believe it in the days of Noah he didn't believe it in the days of Abraham you didn't believe it in the days of the prophets or Elijah but here I am a man see Justin just know this and I know there's a lot a lot of people think when a person dies say that's it they're gone and they're just wait for the resurrection no there's like the rich man there lifted up his eyes and helped being in torment a man and Jesus went down and preached to those souls in prison a man and when he was finished there and he gave them the witness I I am the resurrection and rapture a man he took the keys of death and of hell from the devil and he went over to he went over to the two who were referred to his paradise any empty paradise a man and and what for but with the seed that believed God with the seed to believe the prophets with the seed that believed Abraham and so on right on right on from from the Garden of Eden right on up to that time a man there Jesus laid down his life any many and he took the mirtha and they went up they ascended with a one songs 121 that it that is the Messiah going up and and and the seed of God with him going up a man that he they a man then he took out of the prison the devil he put him in a man man now they weren't they weren't in torment and it says by which also he went and preached on to the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient but he went down to redeem those that weren't there were obedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water a man by the grace of God because they believed Noah's message and the light figure were on - even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ a man who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto Him god bless his words you may be seated a man turn with me to again the familiar scripture that we have read a number of times in reference many times and that is Matthew chapter 24 and brother Branham himself as referenced it many times and that he highlighted the fact that Matthew 24 he said is the same as the seven seals and he said the salmon seals he said are revealed in Matthew 24 and the Prado God did highlight and he went he preached the seals but he also went back to Matthew 24 and the highlight of the mystery of the seven seals in Matthew 24 and let's begin to read at verse four and this is the first seal a man Matthew 24 and verse in verse 4 and in Jesus and to be cut know verse 3 and as he set up on the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things mean concerning his coming and concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple he said when shall these things me and he said what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so he gave them a revelation the mystery he denied lighted there but is highlighted in Revelation 10 and that is the mystery of the seven seals there this was going to happen that was going to happen and now he had the seven seals he said he said come right on down through the seven church ages and then this sister this is the first seal and and the baby said the second seal and in there there's third and then there's the fourth seal and but he said the salmon seal breaks under the four didn't intend to come here ministry on the seals but he said the salmon sealed will break under the fourth Church H and that was in Luther's time because God said I will restore a man so under the under the fourth seal to fit under the four days - 15 - 6 and so on that there there is or rather the fourth story the the seals for the Jews Easter there they're also under under these Church ages because God is during God is working on the Gentiles but at the same time he said God is also working on the Jews a man and when God has finished with it with the Gentiles in the the other seven seals and the mystery of God then he said he said the bride is shaken out and he said the mystery good and the Spirit of God goes back to the Jews a man praise the name of the Lord because the bride has been calling on God Amanda for the coming of the Lord and the mystery of his coming the revelation of his coming a man because even Pentecost the Pentecostal revival they really thought and believed that there they were going to see the coming of the Lord but that generation has gone on that's a that's a hundred years ago or over a hundred years ago that God started the Pentecostal revival and those that witnessed it are gone on by there was another generation coming whereby that God was going to climax the climax the Pentecostal revival a man by the grace of God and that he was going to reveal the mystery of God even on to the coming of the Lord the resurrection the rapture and when he was finished there than it was going back to the Jews praise the name of the Lord and if you and I are are seen anything we are seeing the gospel going back to the Jews we are seeing God bringing it to a conclusion when it comes to what he prophesied in what he said he was going to do for the Gentiles Brotherhood that is the resurrection and the rapture and brother what was God going to do it was the opening of the mystery of God it was the finish of the mystery of God in the days of the voice of the seventh angel revelation 10 that he was going to send that messenger and then the opening of the mystery of God whatwhat was that for it was to give the bride the revelation that she needed for the resurrection and the rapture a man we didn't get there at the faith for the resurrection of faith for the rapture from the Pentecostal revival no no it is too bright revival a Maya in the old me of the seven seals God has given us the revelation of the word the mystery of God to give the bride the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture a man so I pray grace might be better all mine that and as we're going to keep going into the word that we're getting more and more and more into the faith of the resurrection we're getting more and more into the faith of the rapture brother sister to know what is God doing brother what's God doing the prophet of God said what brother it's been going on for a number of years and what is that he said the resurrection he said the resurrection is not going to happen the resurrection is already going on and he has been going on and going on and going on till finally it's going to climax with the change of our body and then will we refer to as the rapture but brother let's get into the revelation of the resurrection now a man you a they quicken Jesus or Paul said in Ephesians you had they quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses and we have been caught up into heavenly places in Christ and again the prophet of God say what's going on in heavily places in Christ and he said the words mean reveal any man and any way any generation in any age knows that now it is it is the bride age Amen that we have been resurrected we have been quickened we have been made a light spiritually and we've been caught up spiritually amai and God and we have been brought in to the end where God is revealing his word revealing the mystery of God and he's given us what he's given us resurrection and rapturing faint by the grace of God caught up into a heavenly priests in Christ and brother were cut up we are raptured smoothly then God wants us to get the revelation of the rapture physically god help us brother in the name of Jesus that were not putting the emphasis just on this mystery of that mystery of that mystery but it is the climax of all the mysteries and it is the resurrection and it is the rapture a man so this is the revelation that I'll be coming more and more and more real to us a man than the other mysteries this mystery that mystery the guardian serpent see and other mysteries that God revealed through the opening of the seven seals but the climax is the change of our bodies the climax is going at a time in into eternity because if God did anything for the Ministry of Malachi for it is to bring us in contact with eternity amen it is in history it is to make us more and more subject more and more conscious of eternity and less and less conscious of time amen because there's anything that we want a man oh brother sister if you're if you got the sheet of God in you you got the life of God in you the agreements Christ in you brother they said you're you're sick and you're tired you're fit up and you want to go you want to go because they got to the place where Jesus he wanted to go and then and I have highlighted the scriptures where Jesus mentioned it out he was in mark 17 or Matthew 17 I have much longer shall I be with you how long shall I be with you he said and then he said I am no more in the world but then the Lord led me to another scripture here and I said all that I said Lord that's tremendous I got to share that with the Saints clue and it was it was in mark chapter 9 and it's in verse 19 and he answered him and saith unto Him well it was a question that he was asked and says when he when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him yeah but they didn't recognize the full revelation of what God was doing through him a man and he asked the scribes what question ye with them and one of the multitude answered him and said master I have brought unto thee my son which has a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him atera them and he fullness and he gnashes with his teeth and pint of the way and I Speights with I disciples that they should cast him out and they could not why because they never had the faith that Jesus said than ever the faith that Jesus was giving the example of a man a man and Jesus was setting the example not only in his actions but in his words and in any in his deeds hey man he so I took him to the earlier just what's your thing that Jesus had already given the disables power over the devil you know they gave him power to do this and they went out and did this they did this they did that but when this man brought his son to them they couldn't do it amen why not because they never had the perfect thing a man and he said and he answered him and said and they could not cast him out and they could and he said they couldn't do it anybody jesus answered him and said o faithless generation a man he was dealing with a faithless generation you and I are living in a faithless generation we're living in a generation of living by their census amen not thing you're living by what they can see where they can feel what they can touch a man but what we were living by what they could what they believe in the Word of God who is living according to what God has revealed Cory what God is saying ain't may absolutely we're just believing the Word of God amen we're not going by our feelings when I green by our senses we're not going by our sight we're going by our faith amen because without it it's impossible to please God I don't care how much we say that we believe this we believe that I believe God I got sin a prophet I believe this mystery I believe that mystery no no God looking for faith don't know don't tell me show me a man so there do you have the faith not not adjusted the knowledge in your head do you have the faith for you in your life and you're going out and you're living there faint a man you're living my faith amen this is what Jesus is looking at this is what Jesus is looking for in the end of the circles and in us you're looking for those that are living by faith now those are say they got faith now those that talk faith those that they live it hey man and the answer has said o faithless generation and we are living in that generation as Jesus lived in it we are living in it and listen to what he said and he said how long should I be with you amen yeah I wonder how many of us aren't questioning how long Lord will I be in this generation how long will I have to put up with this spirit of unbelief in this old world hello well I had to deal with the devil much more amen the spirit of unbelief he said how long should I be with you and how long shall I suffer you how many of her suffering because of the unbelief and Marist feel that pressure of unbelief and Jesus felt it oh yeah how many of us are feeling it then I met you yeah we do we just can't walk we just can't bear to go out there and mix with the world no because there's too much unbelief there's no faith they're not denied and I get confessing their faith in God then I confessing their faith in Jesus it's like when I went went to a barbershop just just this week and I went in and then and I noticed you know there was maybe five or six there and then I noticed that there's one gentleman there and he had a t-shirt on anyway when oh I said I wonder is he a Christian I was looking for a spirit of a Christian but I didn't find it I looking listening to the see if I can hear the words of a Christian the conversation of a Christian I didn't see it I didn't hear it why because on his shirt in large letters all need Jesus and they were at large letters there's no way that you could miss it why because his jacket was open or whatever it was and here it was on display all need Jesus I said well praise the Lord that's just true Lord I said does he have Jesus he meant but the conversation that went on for about a half an hour there and it was just foolishness I swear it where squares Jesus in the conversation where's Jesus in their soul where's Jesus in their bag he's just in there shirt yeah brother you can you can do those things and go to hell oh yeah so brother I and I pray grace in the name of Jesus brother we're not we're not gonna just have it here we're gonna have it in our hearts amen and then brother there's no way that the enemy could stop you from living it no way the amigo Serbia work for from manifesting it or even expressing it hey man if you got the Holy Ghost brother Brown did say he told us what to do and how to do it he said you're gonna talk to this person and he said it might be a farmer and he said well issue you a when when the door opens either you talk to him about the Lord yeah how do we learn now he said if you feel a little spirit against it then you go back to farming and he so reviews a car salesman talk about selling cars and he said but he said if the door opens you talked to that person he said about the Lord amen and he said but if you feel this a resentment Eastern you go back to talking about cars but to keep your spirit right and your attitude right but you're in the spirit of God amen and why because you're looking for the opportunity for a door to open to tell them though Jesus amen you want to reflect Jesus amen you want to be able to say something in a in a song in a deed in a word they may or in your life they'll know that you're a Christian amen so God ever said that we'll go out here and you'll go out there you live this way they lay there like and they'll know that you're a Christian even if it's you're among your family if it's among your job no matter where it is your family friends or neighbors they'll know well you're a Christian yeah because I've had that by the grace of God to God be the glory I'm a that said to me when I was just a young personal teenager and I work here work there and they call it old he said excuse me you're a Christian at you I said yeah boys that I knew that I just felt Betty thing oh yeah just rub somebody I do as a soldier that told me that one time when I was working with the armed military and then again I was doing something in in the in the kitchen there and I was doing this and doing that and this elderly gentleman that was also working there he came over he said excuse me said just wanted to confirm he says you're a Christian act you I said yes how'd you know that I didn't say anything no he said I know but he said it's just that I just knew by your attitude in your spirit he said you had a Christian attitude in a Christian spirit so he said I appreciate that he said so he said he said god bless you I don't believe as a Christian or not know and again another time we were just got together for a break and and we were talking about this table that and I know and I knew there were individuals there that they were belong to a certain church evangelical church this one's a blonde an evangelical church and but they were getting off with the things of the Fugees of the world and I said listen I said you're you but you're this and you're that I said you go to go live like it I suggest you just don't say that I'm belong to this church I belong that church going I said your life reflected I said you're supposed to do that and somebody spoke up said oh yeah we know that mr. Luss we know that you're a Christian so and you're what you're saying them is right amen to God be the glory so brother are you are you there instantly in season out of season ready to give an answer for what you believe ready to give an answer for what you're doing or not doing oh there's a lot of so-called Christians along so God believers all over we don't have to do that we don't have to do you got to be instant in season out of season ready to give an answer ready to be a witness by the grace of Almighty God amen but the disables they were not instant in season out of season amen others knew that but they knew Jesus was different a man and it got any and and Jesus got to that place why because he was more and more experiencing a faithless generation and brother you and I are experiencing a faithless generation amen where is the faith out there there sir they're religious people there there are church people but where is faith those that are out there and they love Jesus they love the Lord they love the body of believers amen they love what God has said they love what God has done they love what God is very and they love what God is going to do Mandor living for that amen but we're at this fewer and fewer and fewer is getting less and less and less and whether the way that Jesus felt that's the way the bride fields brother why it's a faithless generation because one time there they had faint weather weather with Luther in his generation was faint and in Wesley's faith in the better early Pentecostal thing amen because again I can remember when I was in Pentecost as a teenager hey oh my and we have prayer services hello yes praise the Lord and do with other young people there and we get together and weary praising the Lord and and we have our hands up amen we'd be walking up and down the aisle yeah the younger generation walking up and down to y'all Pentecostals praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah to God be the glory amen praying praying praying for brother but now you know you hardly find that among believers little longer there in denominations a man and sometimes denominations are going to rise in judgment against relievers that's right brother god help us to live in the spirit god help us to walk in the spirit God ever said god help us for that we're we're surrendered to the Holy Ghost and it's not me that lives us crazy I live within me amen I feel like Christ feels Oh Lord this generation is getting more and more faithless nor they don't believe you they don't believe your word they don't believe your your sons and daughters your children oh god help us Lord amen so brother we're going to experience rent and Express what Jesus experienced and what Jesus expressed old faithless generation how long shall I be with you and how long shall I suffer you amen so it's something that you're enduring it's something that you are suffering amen because whether what you're looking for what you want is a spirit that believes God you you we're looking for that atmosphere of the power then the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen for life for the resurrection for the rapture hey man brother sister I tell you this Jesus had to get into that anointing he had to get into into their into that revelation of the word for what he was going to do a man before he got off the earth a man and brother any and he was pushing into it not my real father thine be done amen god help us to pray the same prayer amen Lord we're in the end is finish Lord is a faithless generation and Lord we know that we gotta lay down our lives for him for you and for the word late in our lives sure one another not my will father died be done amen what a sacrifice that God is looking for in you what a sacrifice God is looking for in me what for he knows that we got to lay down to get up we got to lay down our lives to look up and see the resurrection in the rapture amen look up when you see this when you see that look up Jesus looked up why he I'm coming home I'm up there so I'm going back where I where I am why he had a ietter he had a theophany was there but he would go back into a glorified condition I don't know yeah so that when we get there he's gonna be like us more girly like him by grace so brother how many of us feel like Jesus felt concerning the generation that we are living in concerning what we are dealing with in this absolutely do you recognize it as a faithless generation I do because if you and I said you go to a mall and go to a store it is it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse and is anything you're seeing you're seeing the devil the god of this world amen and the devil is made flesh in the god of this world in this world yes oh yeah what you're seeing is Satan Satan Satan or there Satan in that person is Satan in that person there's very few and we know there's going to it's going to be the foolish virgins are gonna be out there and they'll lay down their lives a man and they're gonna be separating sometimes we'll see foolish virgins out there but for the most part we're seeing we're seeing the seed of the devil amen brother sister and his Satan what Jesus is may pleasure in his bride and the devil is made flesh in his yeah brother I pray grace that we feel the same way Jesus fell amen and we see what Jesus saw and we're experiencing what Jesus experienced he he knew when he saw that it was time to get out it was a faithless generation and has anything that seed of God can't stand it's faithlessness oh yeah why because what you want is people you want to be around people that are experiencing faith talking faith living faith amen praise the name of the Lord brother that when you come to church Yorick's your Alleluia in your songs in your testimonies in your in whatever it is brother you're expressing your faith and your brother make sure that it's not your emotions make sure it's the Holy Ghost in your soul amen it's a and brother it's not just in church you had it in you before you came to church hey man and when you go out you don't leave it oh no you tell you with it a man it goes with you and it's in you amen because why he was the Word made flesh you are the Word made flesh amen this is tremendous amen now the church made flesh in you it is Christ made flesh in you there's too many there's just a church there just this religion there's that religion they're gonna outlive that religion they do to do what this bit of that religion wants them to do amen but we're going out with the Spirit of Christ a man by the grace of Almighty God hey man so again in Matthew chapter 24 see it's amazing and he said jesus answered and said and again this was the first seal and he said unto them take that take heed that no man deceive you how many are taking heed that no man deceive them than to do that you had to stay with the Word of God but they were div I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee a man and for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many that's the first seal the prophecy and then the second seal and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars and see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet and that is the second seal for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows that is the third seal the third the fourth seal then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another what a world yea and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many a man the spirit the deeds of the Nicolaitans in the first age is coming and in the first seal it's coming again in the fifth seal they made many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cool but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and the gospel this gospel he said of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a witness unto all nations and then shall be in come the fifth seal amen then shall be in come and in the sixth seal verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven amen he's coming back to the Jews and then shall have certain the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other the six seal and the Provost said the seventh seal that day an hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father also and as it was in the days of Noah saw in the coming of the Son of Man as in the days that were before the flood they were eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and so on and knew not to the flood came and took them all the way amen and he said there be this and this and this but know this if the good man of the house had known what time the thief would come he would have watched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh a man grace to us to get into the revelation of what God has done and what God is doing brother when we see it and we recognize brother the hour that we're living Jesus I believe that brother Branham felt as Jesus did yeah he mentions in this book on souls in prison now bear with me I wonder if we feel like this oh yeah well I'll tell you if maybe the problem is as this brother said right here in his email and it's from the brother I would say this morning is it with the Branham tabernacle because I met this brother who three years ago we have fellowship he was the one that showed us around Jeffersonville and so on him and his wife that was with myself and sister Betty and again this is an email that I got yesterday but again he's been a he's been attending that I guess to bet him to have an icon for almost 50 years yeah but as a young boy he was there and even now as a senior brother there and so on and so they've been listening to tapes for 50 years 50 years and brother he knew knows now that after all those years it wasn't striking the people right and that's what the problem God said he said it's not striking you right and he says not striking me right why because it wasn't the hour but now it is the hour he may go I share that with you shortly but the part of God said in this book right here on souls in prison now and he said he said why he said I have scratched my head listen he said I have wallowed on my pillow and he said I have walked the floor and he's asked himself the question what's the matter with you a few days ago I asked to man I was writing with he said I asked Jack Moore one time he said I asked I asked my wife I want to ask you a question don't pull no parts that Ruth and I said have I studied so much he said listen he said I am I'm a make up funny odd and he said what what kind of a person and he said well he said you can't make yourself you are what you are by the grace of God and I said in East and he asked his wife he asked whether Jack Moore and he said EV I lost my mind how many are getting into the word sure that God takes away our minds and he gives us his mind amen he should have I lost my mind he said just a little bit he said you know he's a kind of gone he said why am i condemning those women constantly when I love them he said I ain't going to pat you on the back he's a seen he says you are wrong but he said he felt like he was losing his mind why because of what he was seeing was less less and less word and more and more world people were getting more and more caught up with the world and less and less with the world yeah he was feeling this even in his own tabernacle a man that they weren't catching the word that it wasn't striking them the way that it should a man and of court but again I believe it was striking brother around the way it should right here in that he was losing his mind amen it was it was the evidence said brother Brown was really in turning to the revelation of what God was doing and what God God had done and what the devil was doing and what the devil had done a man and brother I believe that the bride and especially the ministry they also feel like they're losing their mind they feel that oh they're gone crazy and so on and you're wondering well lord what's the matter with me is it because of the word did I feel like this you should understand the ministry oh yeah don't just think well they eat just a pastor he's just an evangelist he's just they see just that no no no no brother we can go back to the scriptures and we can highlight it yeah and then look at and look at Elijah and how Elijah felt oh yeah he thought he was losing his mind oh no no oh lord this Lord that and and God had to deal with the light yet and God had to deal with Elijah there was other prophets that really that were sincere in what they were doing what God was doing through them amen and they recognized that Israel didn't believe Israel wasn't responding to the word the way they should a man sir brother they thought they were losing their mind yeah the prophet of God thought he was losing his mind and there's time when brother Joel fella he's losing his mind yeah why because jondor a different anointing than that then in the congregation oh yeah the grace of God brother brother what he losing your mind for because of what I'm seeing in the world because of what I've seen him even among many believers you know it's getting less and less and less spiritual oh yeah so he said he says you see what you are what you are by the grace of God and have I lost my mind a little bit easier you know and he said the kind is kind of gone why am i can condemning this condemning that and he said but I'm he saying I'm not going to pat you on the back he say if you're wrong and there's a lot of preachers want to pat you on the back and there's a lot of believers want the preacher to pat him on the back no brother why the father of God again went on further into the in later on in this message and he highlighted what was going on he said he said this is smiling time but hinders believers that go around joking and carrying on as if everything is just don't change oh thank you Jesus yeah Jesus looking for you to your tears not you're not you're laughing and your joke I hope people think well we're gonna be happy because we're going into resurrect we're going yeah but what are you thinking about concerning what's going on it there what's your feelings concerning your children your son your daughters what's your feelings concerning your family what's your feelings concerning your friends where's your heart oh I'm going in the rapture I'm going in to resurrection I pray I'm praying the Lord who can do this lord do that yeah but you you got you got to reach out hey man you got to reflect that see each and we know that Christ is here may you maybe you don't see him with your eyes maybe you don't but true vision I tell you he is here maybe don't I trust you're not looking for the Lord to come oh he's here yeah that's within Branham just Christ the pillar fire yeah and again this was Christ revealed in the in the cloud of angels he descending from heaven in a cloud and strong that's Christ there and air he is not on the Provost shoulder and he and I'm not sure it might have been Jack Moore's assembly there that he had a prayer he had a prayer line and and then he left and he went out and he went out the back door you know and there was a there was a photographer there and I was in contact with that photographer a few years ago and he went out the back door and he got brother branham to stand at the back door and took a picture and when he took the pitcher and he went home oh what's that so he sent the picture to brother Billy Paul to tell him he said I took this picture your father at the back door he said he said notice was on his shoulder hey May and it's the pillar fire again it's Christ with us amen his Christ revealed in the pillar fire brother seen Jesus that he has come for his bride the powder God said there's three comings and he said he comes to redeem his bride he comes to get his bride and then he comes with his bride a main source the street comings so he took that picture and then a few years ago I received an email from him and he said excuse me brother he said but he said he said I took the picture a brother branham at the back door when the pillar fire was on his shoulder and he said I gave it to his son Billy Paul and he said I don't have a copy he said could you be able to would you be able to give me a copy he said I would love to have a copy of the picture and I said yes my brother I said you can have one and I got his address and I contacted Billy Paul and I said brother as I send this brother a picture and I said I'll pay for it and they sent it and and and and I paid for a may now three the name of the law or SEOs is Jesus but people are looking for looking for this right there that's what they're looking for when Jesus comes they wanna they think they're gonna look up and see and see this man coming down know that when we do see him he level wait Rome for sure he won't he won't be dressed in that no and so we're gonna have white robes by the grace of God but brother we're not going to see him until we get from time to eternity yeah for the dead in Christ got to rise first then we which are alive and remain are gonna be changed and caught up together with them then we're gonna see it meet the Lord in the air amen boy that pillar fire will go back into the body amen praise the Lord we're going up and he's coming down praise the name of the Lord but brother he's here now in this form it's Jesus its Christ it is the fullness of the Godhead bodily amen and no wonder the prophecy the fullness of the Godhead body is in the bright and he said maybe you don't see him with your eyes maybe you don't but through vision I tell you easier and he said we feel it we know there is something here that our census doesn't declare and he said it's the spirit declares it that Christ is here and he said what if it's over and he said what if the third pole coming on now is to preach to the loss what if they said that all the types are going to show forth now we're and we're in wouldn't that be wonderful what a fellowship he said now and he called the people to the altar for repentance and humility and he said now he said blessed be the that binds our hearts in Christian love the fellowship of kindred mine is like to that above and he said not when now he said not one smile and he said this is not smiling time and he said with a deepness of sincerity well that song is being played he said let's shake hands with somebody and say God bless you he said with sincerity Amen he said I don't know that this thing is true but he says got to be that way and he said it's got to come to that and he said it could be now in every way the world will carry on people will still come to the altar and they'll still cry out but it won't do no good God have mercy they'll be gone and it'll be over there won't be no mercy remember that and the sanctuary becomes smoky and he that's filthy is filthy still and he that is righteous his righteous still and he that is holy is holy still and there is no more mercy when the lamb takes the book that's it and he said and it looks a whole lot like it could be now amen amen brother that's how serious it is so no wonder the Prophet felt like he had lost his mind amen my brother he didn't realize that we'd be here over 50 years later amen and this brother in the random tavern akka live in in the ministry of their word that i preached were you the last few well two or three months I guess and I've earring and see right motive right objective doing God a service without his will and so on and I've said he preached this in Brenham town tract he preached that in Brenham tabernac and so on and now there's other time when he preached in brown chairman Akal and he felt that the people weren't into it they weren't with it as I said when he preached church order and a number of people left his church they thought he was a prophet believed he was a prophet and here they are because he said this because he said that they got up and left and they went to another brothers Church why would they leave a promise Church no faith well I contacted this brother because there's been a while since we've been in contact and he came back to me yesterday and he said brother it is glorious he said I have been hearing the tapes of brother Branham 50 years and he said I fine and he's right he say fine brother that we have been missing a lot that's right you can hear it physically naturally but not spiritually and there's many that are hearing the word physically unnatural but they're not getting the revelation of what the prophet is saying and knowing that they're reading the books and they're reading this and reading that and they got the letter of it but not the don't not to make dynamics of it the prophet of God did say in why Christ speak and he said the trouble is you could point to more chances on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics amen this is going to take the dynamics to get us off the air amen you've got its got it God got to anoint that word by the grace of God you got to have the faith calling for that anointing amen you've got to recognize your need for the anointing Lord and without you Lord without the anointing Lord this is just a dead letter I want you to make it a living reality amen and he said brother we I've been airing the tapes for brother Branham 50 years now and I find we have been missing a lot and what's the problem well thank God he does have somebody there but I'm fabric to highlight it and his brother Joseph and well the Joseph will get up and he'll exhort and then he'll put on the tape and then he'll exhort again concerning what the Prophet said and I said brother I've been ministry on a number of sermons preached by the Prophet in 1965 and exhorting you on on whether what he's going to say and what he says after and so on and apparently this is what brother Joseph has been doing and he said but he said after fifty years we missed this and with this and missed this but now he said when he said it seems like it's the season now to hear and to see it now yeah he's right they didn't hear it and see it before your ear has seen it now now it's striking now I tell you there's certain things that the Prophet is said and God well God has said to the Prophet it's not not william branham it's Christ that that was revealed and said that he didn't strike probably God said 50 over 50 years ago and they were 55 years ago he said I know it's not striking you the way it should he said it's not striking me the way it should yeah why guess it strike us the way it should it's gotta put us in the resurrection and rapture praise the Lord it's going to get us out of this dimension and into that eternal I pray God that it says real to us as it was to Jesus amen now we're not looking for emotion we're not looking for this and looking for that we're looking for you and we're looking for a new resurrection and we're looking for a glorified body yeah the young are going to be older and the older gonna be young by the grace of God and as seeing now he says season to hear it and to see it now and he said when brother Joseph was ministry and he simply takes what the Provost said and was what I'm doing yeah he simply changed what the Provost said and then our eyes come open yeah he's reminding them highlighting the brother Ram said this or they might have heard it but never struck him but now he's going back and he's and he's highlighting him the head of this message I lydian added the other message amen so that we're gonna see the day in the hour of 11:00 and know what God has done but know what God is doing and he said takes what the Provost said and then our eyes come open and he says I am just assembly reading and I say yes brother we sembly read for 50 years and we never seen it before and the message under God showed it and where it was and how it applies for today he said truly the message is the spoken word the original seat Amen it is and now it's bringing for what it's worth ordained to bring forth to give a bride resurrection and rock shrimp a previous it was just the letter of the word it was just the mechanics of the word but now we're getting into the dynamics Amen God is quickening what the Provost said to make it real to us now so that it'll strike is the way God wants it to strike us hey man so he's her brother it's it didn't strike us then it's striking us now amen and the problem said in 1965 and he said we see him he said meeting after meeting and sometimes we just sit as cold and and indifferent yes I know the scripture says it oh I've seen it done we have no enthusiasm it don't seem to strike us right and there's a lot of believers dear believers in word only but they're not in the not in the Holy Ghost it's not striking them right because the anointing is not there the anointing is on the word but not on the person that's right you got to have the anointing you got the whole Holy Ghost for it to strike you right yeah if you got the Holy Ghost in your soul and it goes into your belly you don't know the matter cause days it's a rolando we are chillin yeah you go into your soul and brother it's gonna strike you you go into your soul and you move from the natural dimension to a spiritual you're not a net you're not the summon or the daughter of this this parents no no now you're gonna manifest your sonship you're the sons and daughters of God any man who are you I'm the son of God you're a daughter of God your sons of God yeah Oh too many going living like their natural mother and father brother the baptism of the Holy Ghost changes your nature that's right why or dad all nature still there in your flesh but if you're going to live in the spirit and walk in the spirit you're gonna do the nature of God you're going to manifest the nature of Christ oh yeah or the devil is there to try to get try to get you to follow the the nature of your mom and dad no but the Holy Ghost is there to give you power over that yeah a million sure the nature of Christ has got control a man old brother there's too many still out there without the Holy Ghost and there just mom and dad where's Jesus oh he's in their head but he's not in their heart if he's in your heart you're ordained for the rapture the resurrection I am that's why the probably God knew it wasn't striking them right he said yes I know says that I've seen it done we have no enthusiasm and it don't seem to strike us right if it struck your right you'd be a boost you'll be enthused over the resurrection enthuse concerning the rapture you'll be put and listen as parents you'll be putting your children to it point your grandchildren to it Amen why you want to get them out of time and into eternity to grace of God he said they don't seem to be something like if you had enthusiasm taking a match he said and striking it if the match hasn't got the sulfur right on the head of the match it cannot strike that's right and you can rake and rake and rake but if some chemical has killed the sulfur it will not strike that's right again you know what it is to take a match we were used to that as new foes that older no peace because we were used to their on the box of matches and we take it out and and their lights to match amen but the probably God said if the sulfur is gone from the side of the box you can scratch it and scratch and scratch it and it won't like that's right and you can scratch it and scratch and scratch it and I don't lady in your heart and so make sure the sulfur is there don't let the word I'll take it out amen so he said taking a mattress striking it and if the match hasn't got the sulfur rate on the edge of the match he cannot strike and you can rake and rake and rake and if some chemical has killed the sulfur it will not strike there'll be no light brother pray the grace of God that the sulfur is on the match in your life and when God scrapes it down on the word oh you late you become a light praise the Lord hallelujah you're going to reflect the light so you shouldn't the true genuine vindication of the Scriptures of this last day message and he said you see the presence of Jesus Christ and that you had heard what he done in his life and hearing the scripture say east the same yesterday today and forever and just before the Sodom condition is fired over with the wrath of God you see Jesus return amongst his people formed in human flesh and do the same thing he'd done my it ought to strike our souls to glory and it ought to do something to us it's dropping on that so is it striking you is the word striking you the way that it should you know sometimes preachers stir the people up because of the way they preach my brother if you have the Holy goes it's not the way the preacher preaches is what he preaches yeah it's what he preaches and it'll it'll light you up a man it'll strike amen and you and you like praise the Lord a man a man the ladies coming for Amen because because you got this offer you got the Holy Ghost amen brother grace please in the name of Jesus in your relationship with Christ D amen to you and Christ become one amen dig deep enough so that it's not you the lives it's Christ living in you dig deeper truth not mom and dad's nature in you controlling you is the nature of Jesus and that's the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost that's the nature of God the nature of Christ in you amen it's not just always eternal life and so on yeah of his eternal life you've got the nature of eternal life amen bear with me my again probably God said he said what did they do they didn't know it today men walk ignorant li and they don't know that it that's the truth they think it's some kind of a his 'm they don't dig down deep enough easier to get into the spirit of Revelation not knowledge a lot of people are just receiving knowledge it's the left the literal word coming into their heads but no you're beyond that hey hallelujah praise the Lord this is not controlling you you're not listening to me with this you're listening to me with this it is the ear of the soul not the not the ears I preached how that okay it's not your ears it's your ear a man but too many are just hearing with this I salt it is becomes intellectual but there's a few that will hear by the soul praise the Lord what yeah only God God knows God knows who's hearing him in your hearts Amen oh yeah that's like going to preacher the word and you gloat somebody said I heard this you what I didn't know that well maybe that other person was hearing by the soul and the other person was there you by the head you don't get you don't get the great revelation as you need it this is serious this serious no wonder the Bible tells us to make your calling and election sure oh yeah you believe you're called you believe you're elected you better make it sure hey man and it says they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation and they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough they just lately take it oh well I believe there's a god sure the devil believes the same thing and the devil believes it more than some people claim to believe it the devil believes that in Trimble's people believe it and go on and that's the truth there's a lot a lot of believers say they don't have that fear of God no no no they'd like to be settied they believe in one you know I believe I believe I believe he was a prophet I believe God did this I believe God did that yeah the devil believes it too and he come down with great wrath knowing his time is short look at the faith they give the devil and while faith isn't giving the believers it changed the devil's life it changed the devil attitude oh it just justice increased him and build them up build them up build up my is anger and his fear and everything got got got got greater and greater and greater what are it to do to you and me hey man if the devil knows this time is short well praise the Lord we know our time is not short our time is getting long we're going from time to eternity hey man the devil knows he's reaching the hour of judgment but the bride ought to recognize grace and look up he said the devil believes the same thing and he believes him more than what some people claim to believe it he said the devil believes and trembles people believe it and just go on and that's true lot of Ebers are just going on but he said the devil trembles oh my amazing there's so many believers you know they feel or I mean the message I believe the message and that's fear that that's all that's all but the prophet of God said but he said then he said the message is got to be in you he said there's a lot believe in the message but their message is not in them that's the truth and I have over the years I've met a lot of believers oh I'm in the message I'm in the message yeah but I new message is not in there and I see by their actions I see by their reactions and their spirit and their attitude message is not in know because if the messages and the crises in and if crisis then they're going to have a the spirit and attitude of Christ amen Eastern the devil knowing his judgement is coming but with the bride knowing the resurrections here and the rapture and people believe it and don't pay no attention that judgment is coming but it's here now in other places that he does say it's here now we're in the object he said guilty of crucifying him sure I indict this generation finding them guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning and Jesus said who can condemn me he was the Word made flesh and today the same word is made flesh and it is he said just keep praying keep digging he said yeah he said don't stop just like when Elijah told them dig ditches out there and when you get down he said you can hit an old tin can and say I am too tired throw it out of the way and keep digging and he said just keep digging because we've got to dig and he said we've got to dig and he said because they said if you expect to miss the Tribulation you better start digging amen and for myself I'm preaching to myself there I'm going to start digging deeper than I ever dug and then remember he said in Hebrews it says faith is the substance of things hoped for and here's where many people fail to receive their healing and he said what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not but faith is not that you will be healed you are healed faith is all past tense amen and he said because they take faith to be something that it is not they don't believe it and it's amidst it's not imagination it is actual substance amen now he said this close this is not what you imagine it's just this realist you as any sense of your body would declare anything else and he says just as real as my eyes say this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that that is a light it's just as real to say I feel my coat so is her faith that real what you're believing for your healing you're believing for this believe that it was that is the realistic coat you got on there the sweater you got on is it as real as the seeker said he need you're afraid to see it it's gonna disappear you'll end up on the floor yeah well that that's the same way faith is it's just as real yeah as the garment you're wearing just as real as the seat you're sitting on the floor you're standing on oh yeah just as real but how many believe in that kind of a thing god help us he said you have it alone it's yours faith is the substance not a myth now he said these are real D blessings and I'll catch the top of it and then you deep down amen opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days are you caught up if you're caught up in the revelation you're you're caught up in the power and the anointing of the rapture oh yeah in the resurrection so you said are you the last member will be caught up one of these days it might come and you wouldn't know about it it's a secret secret catching away and you'll come an hour that you think not and you won't know nothing about it she'll be gone and it'd be too late then I trust brother's not too late for us you're at the end now and he said I know everything is fulfilled ready for the rapture the church has called out and it'll be a secret going just vanished that'll be all he said the world will go right on just the same people preaching people thinking that they are getting saved but they're not that's right he said think of it there'll be eternally lost but think they're saved God have mercy on us grace I'll have to leave it there amen and brother it is as the prophet has already said we're living in a scary time and it is but it produces the revelation producing us the fear of God and the fear of God is there to get us to look up brother - what for it is to trim our lamps by the grace of God let's get the word that's there that's ordained to give us the resurrection in the rapturing faith amen brother how much more would God have to do to reveal the resurrection to us how much would God have to do or preach or reveal what for to give us the revelation of the resurrection that revelation at the rapture is ah oh yeah he said the rapture is already on the brightest being raptured we're being caught up amen till one day we're going to experience the climax which will be a glorified body how many are believing what God has done believe what God is doing amen oh I believe he'll do this you'll do that no you got to believe what he's doing amen by the grace of God so brother God help us to make our calling and election sure and to trim our lamps by the grace of God oh yes it's not I got a lot a lot of quotes here yeah concerning the messenger the message and then the conclusion of domestic amen the conclusion is resurrection and rapturing faith brother listen all I want getting to this mystery get into that mystery get into that mystery brother we thank God for all the mysteries but now we got to get into the mystery of the Resurrection and the rapture that's what God is working on right now in your heart in your soul in in your faith the rhetorics resurrection and

feel like you do in this faithless world god help us oh my that we want to get out of here like Jesus did by grace but he he gave us a communion to remind us of the price that he paid to get out of

took bread a man this is tremendous after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily or casually shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord yes yes amen for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body gracious yes the prophet of God said many sleep gone on to a premature grave for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged wherefore my brethren when he come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at all that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order

shed his blood for us amen by the grace of God to ask God to bless the wine so it worked we're going to take it with revelation amen revelation now this bread represents a body that was broken for me and this wine represents blood that was my God have mercy that was shed for me it was shed for the remission of our sins that were shed should we be accepted in the presence of God Amen God without this God wouldn't recognize this without gifts God wouldn't accept us without this there's no way home but he opened the door amen Alleluia and thank God well this is tremendous this represents what this represents us a perfect sacrifice that the Bible says that our sins are in the sea of forgetfulness forgetfulness oh no man can lay a charge against you nobody can lay a charge against you this

[Music] praise the Lord thank offers grace amen to God be the glory just give him the praise and the honor for what he's done and what he's continuing to continue to do to prove that he did it for you amen so it's what we can see it's not me that leaves us Christ that liveth in me amen that's that's a that's a tremendous thing to see and again he lives in us because of what he did because of the price that he paid to remember first of all take away your sin amen put it in the sea of forgetfulness amen so he comes into you into your heart into your soul not your flesh don't don't don't focus on the flesh the prophet of God speaks here concerning false anointed ones he said their anointed but he said their anointed in their flesh but not in their souls and he said because they have anointing in their flesh they'll deceive meant David they say many and they even to the even to the very elective if it were possible so brother list let's go by the anointing in our souls and if it's in your soul it'll come back to the word amen it'll always focus on the word and always focus on what God has done is doing and will do amen but you'll certainly recognize what he's doing and the thing of it is today the false anointed ones they have a ninety in their flesh and as the prophet of God said you could have the anointing in your flesh and going to hell you know because it's not in your soul if you got it in your soul it'd take you back to the word if it's in your flesh you take you back to what God has done and maybe what God will do but he's ignoring what God is doing that's right so we pray the grace of God and again well the ground brings that out in the message I have heard but now I see what are you hearing and what do you see no is it is this problem the soul or is it from just just just in the flesh and there's many there was there's not so much after now there was the nineteen one time in a lot of preachers evangelism they had anointing outwardly but never edited in their hearts because they denied their prophets message they denied the proc they did they loved his sign in his hand and the discernment and all that but and they wanted more of it more of it more of it but eventually the angel tour of the grounds of stop because there they were leaning on the signpost and the people were just focusing on this preacher that preacher that preacher just what they had that anointing to do this to do that and and God allowed it God permitted it to help the people to do this to do that that's the love of God but again you can be healed and go to hell but you could always gotta check check it check it with the word check it with the word check it with the word see like the prophet of God like I said I was this tremendous for me when I read that quote about people brother Browns question he why do you want to be healed well I said why because they're sick and and I say the best majority of the of those that were part of the healing revival back years ago that's why they wanted to be healed because they were see and well Jesus will heal and he already healed me so I'm gonna go to I'll go to or brother Roberts I'll go to brother to Osborne Dyke or this just preacher brother branham and they'll pray for me and I'll be healed and well I long yeah but the public God says why do you want to be you you gotta have a right motive and a right objective he said even for healing I was surprised he said you got it wanted for the glory of God if you wanna for the glory of God you'll be healed and you leave it with the Lord and you give God the glory and and you go closer to him not go on and be religious but you'll get closer to the Lord and be spiritual amen so you give God the glory no matter what it is give God the glory too often the people experience the anointing is this this but was only in their flesh and they didn't come back to the word the word the word no just signs and wonders and the prophet of God brings it out here he said that he said remember he said false Christ we think there we think already got it Falls of 92 no he said they got a true anointing place of false teaching he said they want to come back to the word he said they want the anointing of God but not the Word of God now see they don't think that's necessary they think God is love so God don't want mind if I do this go on my I do that thought amen but they're going to stay rejected the message that told him no repent you know no what they felt they didn't have to repent yeah but the problem God was there to expound to them repent repent repent amen come back to the word come back to the word amen so he said they're false Christ's false anointed ones but again it's not a false in 19 he's bringing that out some do have false or 90s but there's others that don't have a false night they should deceive the very elect if possible a very elect it had to be a spiritual anointing to de-seed the very elect if possible well why is it they want to see the real it cuz they like come back to the word amen they want the word not just religion but they want the word so thank God for for understanding thank God for revelation amen thank God that he's there amen to keep us on our guard it's there to keep what to make our calling that election sure amen chose to make sure you got a lot of ever you got to come back to the word it's the word it's the word we made in our hearts by the grace of God that we might not sin against him so and that's why God's looking for in your life is the word is that's not he's anointing no no he took him for his word so that he can not just use you to do this use you to do that he wants you to use you to witness for the word amen they are that we're living what God is doing now what he's done what he will do would doing a man grace are gone amen this turned to number 229 and return to our brother Bob sing them over again to me wonderful words of life and let me more of their beauty see
