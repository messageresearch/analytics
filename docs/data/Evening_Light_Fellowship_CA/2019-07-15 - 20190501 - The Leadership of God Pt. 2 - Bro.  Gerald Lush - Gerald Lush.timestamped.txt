[35:22] amen and we're looking forward to that
[35:25] day off times the day seems long trials

[41:33] me
[41:37] Oh
[41:44] so bravely run the race till we drink
[41:53] rye
[41:57] a man praise the Lord
[41:59] he's not just run the race but bravely
[42:02] run it a man because there are issues
[42:06] that we have to deal with in the race
[42:09] there was an enemy there to hinder us in
[42:13] the race the slowest down in the race
[42:15] maybe the district is not our attention
[42:17] but to put us on the wrong path amen so
[42:21] let's make sure that we're under again
[42:23] as we've been ministering on the right
[42:25] leadership amen so you're going to stay
[42:27] on the correct path by the grace of God
[42:30] so grace to be with us as we go further
[42:33] into that thought on the leadership of
[42:36] God and want to thank the number of the
[42:40] Saints that that appreciated the
[42:43] Ministry of the word on Sunday morning a
[42:45] man and for what it did for them and
[42:48] what they learned from the message on
[42:51] the leadership of God we're going to
[42:53] continue with it a million because of
[42:56] anything that we need to be sure of in
[42:58] this day and in this hour is that where
[43:01] they were under the right leadership
[43:03] because this is the hour this is the
[43:05] time that we've been warned of and all
[43:08] generations have been warned of it
[43:10] concerning the deceit false prophets
[43:13] false apostles false ministries amen to
[43:17] the play they got to the place as I said
[43:19] they got to the place where Jesus was
[43:21] put out of the church a man is there in
[43:24] Revelation three he's outside knocking
[43:26] on the door of the church you think he'd
[43:29] be inside no he was outside a man
[43:32] because they refused him they refused
[43:34] the full revelation of the Lord Jesus
[43:36] Christ is not what he wanted to do is
[43:39] what they wanted to do a man again it's
[43:42] man doing what's right in his own eyes
[43:44] not in the eyes of God and brother what
[43:47] does he come under he came under the
[43:49] leadership of the devil
[43:50] a man so again remember the Bible warned
[43:53] us that even Satan's angels are
[43:55] preaching the gospel amen
[43:57] oh yeah that's that's right there in the
[43:59] scriptures so brother we we ought to
[44:01] make our calling and election sure by
[44:04] constantly learning up with the word
[44:06] making sure we're in line with if in
[44:08] line with
[44:09] making sure that we have the leadership
[44:11] of God not the leadership of the devil
[44:13] amen making sure we're going to stay in
[44:15] the truth the whole truth nothing but
[44:17] the truth
[44:18] not 99% of it but honor to present amen
[44:22] because it's in this brilliance reserver
[44:24] in our ever an age that God is testing
[44:26] that faith if this are a man whether or
[44:31] not we're going to stay with one under
[44:33] percent of the revealed word amen or at
[44:36] least have that desire in our hearts and
[44:39] in our souls we're going to stay with
[44:41] the word by the grace of God I want to
[44:44] make sure that what I do and what I
[44:45] think and how I act and how I react it's
[44:48] going to be according to the will of God
[44:50] it's going to be according to God Christ
[44:53] in me the home of Laurie because there's
[44:56] a tremendous statement that it will Paul
[44:58] cities that has not me that lives this
[45:00] Christ that live within me a man so
[45:03] brother sister in the in what you're
[45:05] thinking and in what you're doing and
[45:07] how you're doing is that Christ a man is
[45:10] that the way Jesus were thinking is that
[45:13] the way Jesus which we would say it is
[45:15] this the way Jesus would do it a million
[45:17] not the devil
[45:19] well there's as well as I said an ounce
[45:21] on Sunday this is only deceived Eve in
[45:24] the Garden of Eden a man he gave it all
[45:27] he did was had one word he was
[45:30] acknowledging the rest of it but he had
[45:32] in one word yeah and God said Eve said
[45:35] mentioned and we should not eat of the
[45:36] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[45:38] he's a work we wit will die if we did
[45:40] and sayings that you shall not surely
[45:43] die
[45:44] a man so mother God says they would
[45:47] surely die but Satan just had in one
[45:50] word thou shall not surely die
[45:51] and again he took them a little higher
[45:54] said I'll give you if you do and you're
[45:56] going to living to be as gods
[45:58] he said knowing good and evil well we
[46:01] don't need to know it and they didn't
[46:03] need to know it a man but God allowed it
[46:06] and God permitted it because he had a
[46:08] reason and in a man God had a plan so
[46:11] both sister let's be on our guard in
[46:14] this day in this hour in this age amen
[46:16] because brother God is bringing his plan
[46:19] doing in a man what God started
[46:22] ending amen the Alpha now is the Omega
[46:25] the brother ET bravery by the side of
[46:28] eternity allowed us to drop down into
[46:30] time but now he's taking us some time
[46:32] back to eternity
[46:33] amen and whether the devil has come down
[46:36] knowing this time is short as I said
[46:39] brother of all that god that's going on
[46:40] in this day in this hour it look look at
[46:43] the good who got faith the devil got
[46:46] faith he got the revelation that his
[46:49] time is short and I really know that he
[46:51] knows that according to what's going on
[46:53] and na knows that it's prophesied right
[46:56] here in the word a man oh brother the
[46:59] devil knows the word the devil knows
[47:02] where God said it's going to happen in
[47:04] the last days this is going to happen
[47:06] that's going to happen a man is going to
[47:08] get so bad then are they and so
[47:11] deceiving and all these things well I am
[47:14] brought over into what were in that
[47:15] world now where would you see the very
[47:18] like everywhere possible and I and I
[47:21] highlighted some of the things I wonder
[47:22] one do it again tonight but I
[47:24] highlighted to what's going on in the
[47:26] world and who and when and even even
[47:29] science even technology and even not
[47:33] your politics and even their were their
[47:35] concern their concern about what's going
[47:38] on because it is serious it is serious
[47:42] this is not as I said there's another
[47:44] world but I used to say this is not the
[47:46] world I lived in when I was born these
[47:48] are not the world that I lived in when I
[47:50] was when I was maybe 20 years old when I
[47:52] was thirty years old when I was hoarding
[47:54] when I'm 70 now and answer this is not
[47:56] the world that I lived in when I was 60
[47:58] 69
[48:00] a man this is not the way I lived in
[48:02] when I started my 70th year no siree
[48:05] because everything is changing so much
[48:08] and so quickly
[48:10] and that's why the bejeezus said he's
[48:12] gonna he's going to cut it short and a
[48:14] quick short work he was going to do a
[48:16] man now a quick in the eyes of God not
[48:19] quick in your eyes because when it comes
[48:21] to being quick and our eyes we think is
[48:23] going to be oh it's going to be just so
[48:25] long but no I
[48:27] remember one day with the Lord as a
[48:29] thousand years and a thousand years as
[48:31] one day so as God's time is not our time
[48:34] a man we think it's a long time since
[48:37] the Prophet has gone and with our time
[48:40] with the calendar that we're using and
[48:42] in today it does seem that a man because
[48:45] we assume we've gone over six thousand
[48:48] years but we're not a men that that's
[48:50] the Roman calendar a man and that that's
[48:53] took us to the sea but brother we're
[48:57] going to go according to the Jewish
[48:58] calendar there's about another 225 years
[49:02] to the to 6,000 a Maya
[49:05] because people think where's the
[49:06] millennial reign because this is now
[49:10] 2019 and with before before Christ came
[49:14] it was 4000 years now well over 6,000 no
[49:17] no no no they lived let's go according
[49:20] to the Jewish calendar not the Roman
[49:22] calendar
[49:23] amen and it still 225 years left but God
[49:27] is going to shorten time for the bride a
[49:30] man so brother and we can see because
[49:32] everything is changing so quickly and so
[49:35] seriously amen so you young people be on
[49:38] your guard this is not the way that you
[49:43] lived in when you were born
[49:44] amen and it's definitely not the world
[49:47] that you lived in just a few months ago
[49:49] because everything is changing you know
[49:51] day after day after day after day
[49:53] whether we have we know that everything
[49:56] that they used to happen occasionally
[49:58] years ago is happening almost every day
[50:01] amen
[50:02] when it comes to fate even when it comes
[50:04] to basic things like a fire or an
[50:07] accident or a plane crash or or this is
[50:10] going on murder it all used to happen
[50:14] you know once in a while but now is
[50:17] happening constantly amen why because
[50:20] the devil has come down why knowing is
[50:24] time is short a man so please in the
[50:27] name of the Lord listen on does not
[50:29] think think like the world thinks
[50:31] there's not I play the world lacks
[50:32] there's no that's not that's not more
[50:34] real
[50:35] what we're looking like in the eyes of
[50:36] the world what it look like in the eyes
[50:38] of God amen
[50:40] what does God think about you not about
[50:42] what the devil thinks about you what
[50:44] your neighbor thinks about you what does
[50:46] God think about you a man who is leading
[50:51] me I trust where the grace of God -

[52:05] is more real deal then the eternal life
[52:08] but all right so so you've got such an
[52:10] experience of Jesus and that you've been
[52:13] truly honestly absolutely born-again and

[52:22] strangers in this world

[52:28] to this world a man but being born
[52:31] together customized to eternity but yet
[52:34] whether there are too many believers
[52:35] that are too satisfied with this world

[53:34] to a place now where our spiritual life

[1:09:45] the book of Matthew chapter 6 Matthew
[1:09:52] chapter 6 I didn't have the correct
[1:10:02] sheets of paper to print this on but
[1:10:04] I've just printed a few copies to those
[1:10:06] that maybe don't have it I printed it
[1:10:09] some years ago and it is a word to the
[1:10:12] church and it is a quote of brother
[1:10:15] Branham from the fund of from the the
[1:10:19] message Christ the mystery of God
[1:10:21] revealed and it is counsel for the
[1:10:25] believers amen it's a word I would say
[1:10:29] to brendham Tabernacle a word to any
[1:10:31] message Church amen and also this other
[1:10:35] one that I did some years ago and it is
[1:10:38] with a quote character is a victory not
[1:10:41] a gift and you and on the other version
[1:10:46] that I printed this was more clear but
[1:10:48] it's a it's a an Israeli soldier and
[1:10:52] apparently he's walking through a
[1:10:54] military cemetery and you see a number
[1:10:57] of headstones there of soldiers that
[1:10:59] laid down their lives for Israel and
[1:11:03] character is a victory not a gift a man
[1:11:07] praise the Lord the grace of God that
[1:11:10] will lay down our lives for the gospel
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:15] in Matthew chapter 6 and also to inform
[1:11:21] you that I did share it with somebody
[1:11:27] else and they were sort of shocked with
[1:11:29] it but after a ministry on Sunday I
[1:11:34] couldn't get away from the revelation of
[1:11:37] what I was what I administered on
[1:11:39] and what God had revealed to us and I
[1:11:42] the Lord sort of woke me around 6:30
[1:11:47] Monday morning and I was it seemed like
[1:11:50] I would sleep but I was preaching and
[1:11:53] God was preaching to me God was dealing
[1:11:58] with me God was revealing things to me
[1:12:00] and I just couldn't couldn't get it get
[1:12:02] away from it and so he went on for about
[1:12:05] two hours or more as I was laying there
[1:12:08] in the bed and thinking I was asleep but
[1:12:12] I was somewhere else and and the Lord
[1:12:18] was taking me more and more into this
[1:12:20] revelation of the leadership of God it
[1:12:23] was tremendous
[1:12:25] so even when I woke up and even when I
[1:12:28] got up I still couldn't get away from it
[1:12:30] it was still with me so I feel that it's
[1:12:34] the Lord the Lord's will to continue the
[1:12:39] minister on this maybe for tonight and
[1:12:41] maybe again another service but we'll
[1:12:44] see as the Lord leads so it's like I
[1:12:48] said a lot of people don't understand
[1:12:49] the the the pressure and stress that the
[1:12:54] ministry is under that's if you're
[1:12:56] really in the spirit and you're really
[1:12:58] following God's leadership amen
[1:13:00] and that's why they're probably God said
[1:13:03] one time to regarding the the preachers
[1:13:05] he said he said they said why he said
[1:13:09] their wives he said our sisters he said
[1:13:11] I had to let their husbands if there are
[1:13:14] preachers he's to let him sleep at I'll
[1:13:15] sleep it off he stood on Monday he said
[1:13:18] because of the others distressed and the
[1:13:21] pressure that the Ministry of the word
[1:13:23] puts them under because we're now is not
[1:13:26] intellectual is spiritual a man because
[1:13:29] he's not coming out of the head it's
[1:13:30] coming out of the heart a man and God is
[1:13:33] taking control of the heart the soul God
[1:13:35] takes control of the human spirit God
[1:13:37] takes control of the mind a man and
[1:13:39] you're out of course when you get to the
[1:13:40] mind you're fighting the devil there and
[1:13:42] and so God takes control and moves the
[1:13:45] devil away amen so what for so the
[1:13:48] ministry continues on with the word thus
[1:13:50] saith the Lord so
[1:13:52] be in prayer as we go further into the
[1:13:55] words a night and I want to share with
[1:13:56] you the scriptures that I that I never
[1:14:00] got to on Sunday but in Matthew chapter
[1:14:04] 6 the Lord's Prayer and beginning to
[1:14:11] read at verse 9 jesus said after this
[1:14:19] manner therefore pray our Father which
[1:14:26] art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:14:31] his emphasis on the name not the titles
[1:14:36] but the name thy kingdom come Thy will
[1:14:41] be done in earth that's in you
[1:14:46] now just see the earth oh there but in
[1:14:50] you because we were made of dust we come
[1:14:55] from it so he said again thy kingdom
[1:15:00] come thy will be done in earth well he's
[1:15:07] got to have someone to do it in a man
[1:15:10] that's right sister Justine praise the
[1:15:12] Lord and it says as it is in heaven that
[1:15:18] the will of God be done here as it is in
[1:15:21] heaven the will of God be done in your
[1:15:23] life as it is in heaven and it says give
[1:15:27] us this day our daily bread and it's the
[1:15:32] revealed word for this hour for the day
[1:15:35] in which you're living that's our daily
[1:15:37] bread and forgive us our debts as we
[1:15:43] forgive our debtors
[1:15:45] amen now Justin financially natural
[1:15:52] money but spiritually amen
[1:15:56] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:16:00] debtors we owe something to others but
[1:16:05] we can
[1:16:06] they're rolling were they order us we
[1:16:10] need to do this for them but we want
[1:16:12] them to do that for us a man so this is
[1:16:17] what God is seen not just money and
[1:16:21] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:16:24] debtors and lead us not into temptation
[1:16:31] but deliver us from evil again that
[1:16:37] brother of another church asked me God
[1:16:40] leading us into evil no I said that's
[1:16:44] the devil does that I said lead us not
[1:16:47] into temptation and how is God going to
[1:16:49] do that deliver us from evil
[1:16:52] I said from what from the influence of
[1:16:54] the devil a man so I citizen gotten is
[1:16:58] not God leading us into evil I said
[1:17:00] buddy we're praying God deliver us from
[1:17:02] Satan's influence the leaders and evil
[1:17:04] well he said brother praise the Lord
[1:17:08] Alleluia he said you have given me peace
[1:17:11] he said I saw God was leading us into
[1:17:14] evil God was leading us into sin
[1:17:17] Noah says God permits that sometime but
[1:17:20] it's the devil so we're praying God
[1:17:22] don't let the devil Advan influence over
[1:17:24] me don't let the devil have an influence
[1:17:27] over us so as the delivery of some
[1:17:30] Satan's influence deliver us from
[1:17:31] Satan's leadership amen
[1:17:34] praise the name of the Lord so lead us
[1:17:37] not into temptation but the guys
[1:17:41] leadership and it says that deliver us
[1:17:44] from evil from the evil one from the
[1:17:47] devil for thine is the kingdom and the
[1:17:51] power and the glory forever amen
[1:17:56] and it says for if ye forgive men their
[1:18:01] trespasses your heavenly Father will
[1:18:04] also forgive the you a man we're praying
[1:18:09] for God's grace but you've got to show
[1:18:12] grace to others amen

[1:19:05] anointing and what spirit amen and we

[1:20:06] pray God to help us
[1:20:08] there's too much as I received an email
[1:20:11] today from somebody I might have been if
[1:20:12] they're in Florida I think and it's been
[1:20:15] some years and say I have that telescope
[1:20:17] with him and he said batteries that just
[1:20:20] let you know he said I'm still he's it
[1:20:22] in the word he says still staying with
[1:20:25] the message he said it's unfortunately
[1:20:28] but he said I guess you know as well
[1:20:29] that he said many
[1:20:31] that are walking away from it many said
[1:20:34] are not stained with the truth the whole
[1:20:37] truth and nothing but the truth but he
[1:20:39] said by the grace of God myself and my
[1:20:42] family he said are staying with it and I
[1:20:44] and he said we know and we're aware that
[1:20:46] it's going to get worse a man that is
[1:20:49] the brother even even in the in Florida
[1:20:51] that realizes what is going on I trust
[1:20:54] we realize what's going on what is it it
[1:20:57] is Satan deceiving the people in the
[1:21:00] follow he is leadership a man we might
[1:21:03] have said that under the leadership of
[1:21:04] God but end up under the leadership of
[1:21:07] the devil the church standard under
[1:21:09] under God's leadership we already went
[1:21:11] through that in the church ages and by
[1:21:13] the ended up under Satan's leadership
[1:21:15] Amen God said your year this year this
[1:21:18] year this from the birth date but then
[1:21:20] when he got into the last days he said
[1:21:23] oh you say you are rich and increased
[1:21:25] with Goods and have need of nothing but
[1:21:27] he said I say unto you that your
[1:21:28] wretched your miserable your poor your
[1:21:30] blind you're naked in all the other ages
[1:21:33] there was something maybe positive but
[1:21:36] in the last days there was nothing
[1:21:38] positive everything was negative and and
[1:21:41] the worst part was that he was on the
[1:21:43] outside a man trying to get their
[1:21:46] attention by the revelation of his word
[1:21:50] just just as just think about that
[1:21:52] consider that again in Revelation
[1:21:54] chapter 3 and verse 14 Amen and then it
[1:21:57] says thus saith a the angel and the
[1:22:00] angel he named himself as the the a man
[1:22:02] of God meaning that it was to finish it
[1:22:05] was the end of all things a man and it
[1:22:08] was the end of the church ages so he was
[1:22:10] calling that he was calling the the
[1:22:12] elect there and he was calling the very
[1:22:14] elect out of the churches into out of
[1:22:17] the church age into the brain age by the
[1:22:19] grace of God so brother sister I trust
[1:22:22] that we are here tonight not because
[1:22:24] that then we oh that we're religious
[1:22:26] well because that we are the bride amen
[1:22:29] and that we have come out of the loudest
[1:22:31] see in church age and that we have
[1:22:33] coming to the bride age and in the right
[1:22:35] age the word revealed in the right age
[1:22:37] is giving us resurrection and rapture in
[1:22:40] faith and the word in the bride age is
[1:22:43] giving us the
[1:22:43] revelation that Christ has come for the
[1:22:47] bride
[1:22:47] the Lord has descended from heaven with
[1:22:49] a shout the voice of the Archangel and
[1:22:52] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:22:55] Christ shall rise first then we which
[1:22:58] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:22:59] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:23:02] the lord in the air so brother that
[1:23:04] that's what's going on in the writings
[1:23:07] that is what you and I are entering into
[1:23:09] by the revelation of the word that's
[1:23:11] what you and I are believing and that's
[1:23:13] what we're believing for that's well you
[1:23:16] and I are hungry for and as well as you
[1:23:18] and I are searching for is the
[1:23:20] resurrection and the rapture amai and
[1:23:23] whether we have come to that place where
[1:23:25] morning noon and night
[1:23:26] we just can't forget it we can't get it
[1:23:29] out of our minds we can't get it out of
[1:23:31] our hearts out of our souls we can't get
[1:23:33] away from the hunger than the thirst a
[1:23:35] man that God through the revealed word
[1:23:38] as created in the right a my brother
[1:23:42] Martin Luther he had a hunger and a
[1:23:44] thirst morning noon and night for the
[1:23:47] revelation more and more of the
[1:23:49] revelation that you are justified by
[1:23:52] faith
[1:23:52] Wesley sanctified by faith because the
[1:23:55] Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:58] Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit any
[1:24:00] man you talk about a hunger and thirst
[1:24:02] morning noon and night they walked in
[1:24:04] this fear they lived in the spirit and
[1:24:06] like Luther the grocery the Pentecostals
[1:24:09] the old-fashioned Salvation Army old
[1:24:12] fashion or the churches ain't man they
[1:24:15] they they they weren't religious and and
[1:24:17] just going to church on his Wednesday or
[1:24:19] on a Sunday no no they they were in the
[1:24:22] spirit as seven days a week they're in
[1:24:25] the spirit 24 hours a day seven days a
[1:24:28] week
[1:24:28] amen they are and again they were new
[1:24:33] creatures they were absolutely
[1:24:35] born-again and the old worth it just a
[1:24:38] whatever was in the back but the new
[1:24:41] birth at preeminence amen and I trust by
[1:24:44] the grace of God that the old birth is
[1:24:46] behind us and the new birth has got the
[1:24:49] preeminence amen
[1:24:50] and if we reflect it and it is reflected
[1:24:54] in the lives that we live
[1:24:56] noon and night it is oh my god Elvis but
[1:25:00] I know that it'll upset the religious
[1:25:02] people because they're they they feel
[1:25:04] that you're hard to get hard to get your
[1:25:08] attention
[1:25:08] Amen that's that's the truth they feel
[1:25:11] oh you're you're well you're you're
[1:25:12] always on thinking about this you're
[1:25:14] always thinking about this and you want
[1:25:16] to do this and you want to do that Amen
[1:25:18] brother if you're in the spirit and
[1:25:20] you've been truly born again you want to
[1:25:22] love God you want to serve God and you
[1:25:25] want you want to worship God amen by the
[1:25:28] grace of Almighty God that's the truth
[1:25:30] that's the truth
[1:25:32] morning noon and night as I said he may
[1:25:34] even Wesley he would preach sometimes
[1:25:36] five times a day and whether we think oh
[1:25:41] well we worship on Wednesday night and
[1:25:44] we worship on a Sunday morning
[1:25:46] maybe we'll had to start Sunday evening
[1:25:48] service Amen by their sister and they
[1:25:51] were in the spirit listen let's get back
[1:25:53] to a Sunday evening service and why Amen
[1:25:56] because that's the Bible that scripture
[1:25:58] that's the instruction of the Bible
[1:26:00] concerning the last days and it says
[1:26:02] there says forsake not the assembling of
[1:26:05] yourselves together and much more as you
[1:26:08] see the Day approaching and brother and
[1:26:10] we're not seeing much more we're seeing
[1:26:12] less that's right bill even we were
[1:26:15] getting together less believers were
[1:26:17] fellowship unless a man named Bo right
[1:26:20] here it is if their fellows have been
[1:26:21] left with one another their fellows I
[1:26:23] mean less were gone and that is the
[1:26:25] absolute truth well there's another
[1:26:28] anointing leading them in but is not
[1:26:29] God's anointing brother and I remember a
[1:26:32] brother some years ago that he that he
[1:26:35] preached on that dead text
[1:26:38] I believe the name in the book of
[1:26:40] Hebrews there but he started just a few
[1:26:42] verses before that and he said listen
[1:26:45] and he said I want to preach on he said
[1:26:48] a lettuce salad and and then they all
[1:26:52] laughed and they sent a letter salad yes
[1:26:54] he said I want to preach on a lettuce
[1:26:55] salad and it's let's see a way let's see
[1:26:58] today we're going to have a lettuce
[1:27:00] salad
[1:27:00] any-any ready in the book of Hebrews
[1:27:02] there there where the scripture was and
[1:27:05] it says led and concerning those that
[1:27:07] were living in this world
[1:27:08] walking in the spirit and it says let us
[1:27:10] let us let us one verse after another it
[1:27:14] was encouraging the believers to let us
[1:27:16] do this let us do this let us do that
[1:27:19] and adding any and he crowded with those
[1:27:22] two verses there and he said forsake not
[1:27:25] the assembling of yourselves together
[1:27:26] and he said much more as you see the Day
[1:27:30] approaching amen so he said he said you
[1:27:33] take the lettuce salad and you're going
[1:27:35] to put this on the letter selling amen
[1:27:37] you want to pour this you want to mix
[1:27:39] this with it you want to mix that with
[1:27:41] it but he said this this is all we're
[1:27:42] going to mix these for this lettuce
[1:27:44] salad
[1:27:44] it's and let us through this let us
[1:27:46] through that little through that now he
[1:27:48] said much more as you see the Day
[1:27:50] approaching amen
[1:27:52] but we see the hour approaching where is
[1:27:54] becoming less and less and less amen why
[1:27:59] because they're not under God's leaders
[1:28:01] have any more than under the devil's
[1:28:02] leadership amen and the diligence wants
[1:28:06] you to be religious and/or you think
[1:28:08] about it sometimes once in a while
[1:28:10] you're thinking about it here and maybe
[1:28:11] you'll have a devotion and maybe you'll
[1:28:13] do your say a prayer or say grace you
[1:28:17] might as well talk to the devil because
[1:28:18] there is more and more and more than a
[1:28:21] they're there they're shameless Satan
[1:28:23] less and less and less with faith amen
[1:28:26] it's just religion it's just a form of
[1:28:28] godliness and they're denying the power
[1:28:30] they they say oh god I want you to bless
[1:28:32] and sanctify the food for the
[1:28:34] nourishment of the body and feed the
[1:28:36] soul with the bread of life
[1:28:37] yeah they don't trust God not by 80
[1:28:40] means not about to bless food no sir
[1:28:44] they're going to do they're going to
[1:28:46] listen to the devil the devil say both
[1:28:48] say this about this food say that about
[1:28:50] that food say that about something else
[1:28:52] a man and Jesus had taken over thought
[1:28:54] while you shall eat or drink hey man I
[1:28:56] thought myself though that generation
[1:28:59] didn't believe it but generations are
[1:29:01] not going to believe it either
[1:29:02] amen Oh we'll always say that generation
[1:29:05] they didn't believe in eating this there
[1:29:07] was a contrary to their faith kind of a
[1:29:09] religion that's right Jesus trains at
[1:29:12] all my brothers same they in this day
[1:29:14] and this hour a man the devil is telling
[1:29:17] else it is something else says tell him
[1:29:18] that a man and if I get all these
[1:29:21] Booton free food and all that stuff
[1:29:23] that's a bunch of nonsense amen as I
[1:29:27] told you before a certain magazine did
[1:29:29] did did an article on it
[1:29:30] hey man and they said you know what
[1:29:33] we've studied it and studied and years
[1:29:35] ago those that ate the most lutein lived
[1:29:37] the longest and they said what yeah they
[1:29:42] said those that ate the most gluten you
[1:29:43] know some years ago if they live longer
[1:29:45] than anyone else that refused to eat it
[1:29:47] hey man say what is it it is the devil
[1:29:50] and the prophet of God talked about a
[1:29:52] germ warfare coming and it's the enemy
[1:29:55] that's bringing that germ warfare a made
[1:29:58] by bringing the people into that law
[1:30:00] under that spirit of welfare and they're
[1:30:02] afraid of this and afraid of that and
[1:30:04] afraid of that where he is faith in God
[1:30:07] anyway where is faith trusting Jesus no
[1:30:10] matter what it is or we want God to
[1:30:13] bless us we want God to prosperous we
[1:30:15] want God to give us this and give us
[1:30:17] that but we're trusting God where were
[1:30:19] these simple things in life for everyday
[1:30:21] living a night in all thy ways
[1:30:23] acknowledge him and he will direct your
[1:30:25] steps amen the fifth step of the
[1:30:28] righteous are holder of the Lord amen
[1:30:31] so anything that good alternatives a new

[1:36:53] scars in his hand but my fingers in his
[1:36:56] sorry and so on
[1:36:58] search when he wouldn't tell when Thomas
[1:37:00] was there Jesus came and says oh he said
[1:37:02] Airtel's look amen
[1:37:05] I tell you tom is gonna trying to he did
[1:37:09] it to bring out his full faith amen
[1:37:13] and he touched his fingers touched his
[1:37:16] hand rather then he touched touched his
[1:37:17] side and he believed but John believed
[1:37:21] he knew it was Jesus any man and just
[1:37:25] say you didn't opinion father's one bed
[1:37:27] but when Jesus came down to the reveal
[1:37:30] to John the book of Revelation the
[1:37:32] beginning and the Alpha and the Omega of
[1:37:34] the ministry to refer to the Jew journey
[1:37:37] to the Gentiles and to the Adventures of
[1:37:39] the Jews Rayong into the myth of
[1:37:42] millennial reign later on into a to
[1:37:44] eternity amen

[1:38:37] the time but he did habitat and when he
[1:38:39] was near the end amen
[1:38:42] and finally Peter acknowledged and
[1:38:45] manifested his humility that's right
[1:38:48] when he kept when he came to walk when
[1:38:50] he came to the end of his day and they
[1:38:53] were going to do to cheat Peter what
[1:38:55] they did to Jesus they're going to

[1:45:08] God's will Amy if Jesus was looking at
[1:45:14] looking at the minute what was going to
[1:45:16] happen it was all it'd be all negative
[1:45:19] all negative because he was gone he was
[1:45:22] going to be oh my lord
[1:45:24] grace God in control any man even just
[1:45:30] before gets M&E what what did Jesus told
[1:45:33] I said why did Jesus tell the disciples
[1:45:35] to go get a sword why would they want a
[1:45:42] sword and they came and they had all
[1:45:46] they had was two shorts and Jesus said
[1:45:49] that's enough yeah I was surprised and I
[1:45:55] said oh oh now I know the the use of one
[1:46:02] of those swords would vindicate that he
[1:46:05] was the Alpha and the Omega the end of
[1:46:08] the many was the word and the Word was
[1:46:10] with God the Word was God
[1:46:12] he was the spoken word made flesh hey
[1:46:17] man
[1:46:17] well why the sword well when they came
[1:46:20] and they arrested Jesus that's when
[1:46:22] Peter came with the sword and chopped
[1:46:24] off this the servants hair ear yeah
[1:46:29] chopped his ear off what did Jesus do oh
[1:46:32] here they are didn't want to take Jesus
[1:46:35] and and they're gonna whip him they're
[1:46:38] gonna punish him and everything else and
[1:46:40] eventually crucify you and Jesus just he
[1:46:42] said put up your sword he that either
[1:46:46] the own lives by the sword will die by
[1:46:48] the sword and he reached down just think
[1:46:50] Jesus reached it oh my praise the Lord
[1:46:53] and after all he went reading that's
[1:46:54] heavy he was there to heal
[1:47:01] and he reached down and got the servants
[1:47:04] here and he put it back on again
[1:47:07] as if he's as if Peter never cut it off
[1:47:11] I said Oh Lord that's why he told the
[1:47:16] disciples to get a sword I said I don't
[1:47:19] think the disciples knew that but jesus

[1:49:48] the shelf now he said we know that
[1:49:52] Pentecost went went beyond the the
[1:49:54] baptism and they put too much emphasis

[1:53:16] word amen
[1:53:18] because we are the sons and daughters of
[1:53:20] God we are led by the Spirit of God and
[1:53:23] not why why we live by the Spirit of God
[1:53:26] now remember not outside but you live
[1:53:29] from the inside God's Holy Ghost
[1:53:32] leadership is out of your heart not your
[1:53:35] head no no
[1:53:39] it's on the inside of the insight by the
[1:53:42] grace of God so brother let's make sure
[1:53:47] we have his leadership in our lives
[1:53:50] amen right let me get back to the
[1:53:54] scriptures in Exodus 13 and verse 20 and
[1:54:04] they took their journey from Sukkoth and
[1:54:08] encamped and eat them in the edge of the
[1:54:11] wilderness and the Lord went before them
[1:54:16] by day and a pillar of a cloud to need
[1:54:20] them the way amen Israel needed
[1:54:25] leadership oh yeah there they had a
[1:54:31] prophet they had Moses there Joshua dad
[1:54:34] Caleb but they needed God amen and it
[1:54:41] says the Lord went before them by day in
[1:54:43] the pillar of a cloud and to lead them
[1:54:45] the way and by night in a pillar of fire
[1:54:48] to give them light to go by day and
[1:54:52] night he took not away the pillar of the
[1:54:57] cloud by day nor the pillar of the fire
[1:54:59] by night from before the people amen God
[1:55:04] leads by the pillar of fire and the
[1:55:07] cloud and brother what's under the
[1:55:11] pillar fire in the cloud it's the
[1:55:13] revealed word a man it's the will of God
[1:55:17] brother what was Moses doing when he
[1:55:21] went down to bring Israel out of Egypt
[1:55:23] it was God fulfilling his word it was he
[1:55:28] had already prophesied four hundred
[1:55:30] years before this is amazing
[1:55:33] 400 years before God told Abram your
[1:55:36] seed is going to be in a strange land
[1:55:38] for four hundred years
[1:55:40] but he said I'm going to bring them out
[1:55:42] amazing and God sent the prophet Moses
[1:55:47] down to bring them out
[1:55:51] turn with me to numbers 27 numbers 27
[1:56:08] and verse 15 and Moses spake unto the
[1:56:16] Lord saying let the Lord the God of the
[1:56:21] spirits of all flesh said a man over the
[1:56:25] congregation
[1:56:27] yea said a man over the congregation
[1:56:32] which may go out before them which may
[1:56:35] go in before them and which may lead
[1:56:38] them out and which may bring them in
[1:56:42] that the congregation of the Lord be not
[1:56:45] as sheep which have no shepherd brother
[1:56:50] as believers we are not to be sheep
[1:56:54] without a shepherd
[1:56:55] no no ever since ever since the the
[1:57:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost God has had
[1:57:03] shepherds to lead the Sheep amen the
[1:57:07] fivefold ministry oh and the world can
[1:57:10] you do away with the vital ministry you
[1:57:14] know and like like those believers that
[1:57:16] are just listening to tapes of brother
[1:57:20] Branham and I know that there's a
[1:57:24] certain group of believers that are
[1:57:26] presently listening to the the
[1:57:28] revelation of the seven seals and
[1:57:30] they're listening to the tapes well I
[1:57:33] said Lord what are they going to do and
[1:57:35] what it's going to be their actions and
[1:57:37] reaction when they get to the questions
[1:57:39] and answers on the seven seals are they
[1:57:43] going to skip the questions and answers
[1:57:45] and just jump from the sixth seal to the
[1:57:48] seventh or will they listen to their
[1:57:51] questions and answers I said their faith
[1:57:54] is going to be challenged why because
[1:57:57] during the questions than answers there
[1:58:00] is a question brother Branham does the
[1:58:02] bride have a ministry and he said yes
[1:58:07] and he says she's at it he said since
[1:58:10] the day of Pentecost he says since the
[1:58:13] beginning of the churches and he said
[1:58:15] it's the five full ministry he said it's
[1:58:18] right there in the Bible and he listed
[1:58:20] them
[1:58:22] and yet we have a generation that is
[1:58:24] denying the fight for ministry the
[1:58:27] listen Saints the problem of God also
[1:58:29] are highlighted the fact that if we're
[1:58:31] going to be leaders here should you'll
[1:58:33] be a leader there in glory yes like I
[1:58:37] said Evan is not a dream world Evan is
[1:58:40] going to be a it's going to be a real
[1:58:41] heaven and a real earth yeah
[1:58:44] and we're and where there's gonna be a
[1:58:46] real city there's gonna be real things
[1:58:48] to do outside the city now I know
[1:58:51] there's not gonna be any any oceans but
[1:58:54] they're known without a doubt there's
[1:58:55] gonna be rivers yeah so brother sister
[1:59:00] okay how can we deny the leadership of
[1:59:06] the ministry that God has ordained and
[1:59:08] you go there any again and and and you
[1:59:12] notice why God has ordained these that
[1:59:15] lay that fivefold ministry and brother
[1:59:19] if without the five or ministry then
[1:59:21] it's not going to be accomplished it is
[1:59:23] for the perfecting of the Saints so
[1:59:28] brother if God was going to do that then
[1:59:30] brother and he started back there and
[1:59:32] he's going to continue that right on
[1:59:33] through to the end and when we get into
[1:59:35] glory the ministry is still going to
[1:59:38] have a position probably God said he
[1:59:42] said now he said I could be called to
[1:59:45] preach and he said Henery and not do it
[1:59:48] if I could sit in the congregation like
[1:59:50] you now he said if I'm elected and
[1:59:54] predestinated according to the Word of
[1:59:56] God he said I won't lose my salvation
[1:59:58] but he said I will lose my reward that's
[2:00:04] right
[2:00:05] brother sister this being the will of
[2:00:09] God under the leadership of God so
[2:00:10] you're not going to lose your reward and
[2:00:12] some are going to lose their salvation
[2:00:15] some are going to lose the reward of
[2:00:17] eternal life some are going to lose
[2:00:19] their that reward of going from here to
[2:00:21] eternity yeah but he said as a minister
[2:00:26] he said I won't lose to the reward I
[2:00:27] want no I won't lose my salvation he
[2:00:29] said but I will lose my my reward what
[2:00:33] will happen he'd end up outside the city
[2:00:35] not in the city grace brother god help
[2:00:41] us
[2:00:43] let the Lord the God of the spirits of
[2:00:46] all flesh said a man over the
[2:00:48] congregation which may go out before
[2:00:51] them and which may go in before them and
[2:00:54] which may lead them out and which may
[2:00:57] bring them in that the congregation of
[2:01:00] the Lord be not as sheep which have no
[2:01:04] shepherd a man again a confirmation of
[2:01:09] leader of God's leadership is not just
[2:01:14] the man it's God in the man God
[2:01:17] revealing his will to the man and the
[2:01:19] man is going to lead lead them according
[2:01:23] to the will of God in Deuteronomy
[2:01:25] chapter 8 I'll have to bring him to
[2:01:30] conclusion with these scriptures because
[2:01:35] there's three or four other scriptures
[2:01:43] after these but we will leave them until
[2:01:46] Sunday amen in Deuteronomy chapter 8 in
[2:01:53] verse one all the commandments which I
[2:01:56] command thee this day shall he observe
[2:01:59] to do that he may live amen live and
[2:02:06] multiply and go in and possess the land
[2:02:10] which the Lord swear unto your father's
[2:02:12] for them it was the natural land for us
[2:02:15] it's the spiritual his eternity is the
[2:02:19] kingdom of God and it says verse 2 and
[2:02:24] thou shall remember all the way which
[2:02:26] the LORD thy God led thee these forty
[2:02:29] years in the wilderness a man why he
[2:02:35] said to Humble thee and God is allowing
[2:02:38] things to happen in our lives to Humble
[2:02:40] us yeah
[2:02:44] god help us and again as ice
[2:02:47] you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:51] you have the evidence of divine love
[2:02:56] you'll have humility absolute humidity
[2:02:59] and to prove thee God did it to Humble
[2:03:05] them and to prove them and to know what
[2:03:07] was in thine heart whether thy words
[2:03:11] keep his Commandments or know a man God
[2:03:15] proved them that's right and God proves
[2:03:20] you God is proving me God allows this to
[2:03:24] happen that to happen what for to see if
[2:03:27] you love him to the extent you you're
[2:03:29] going to keep his word not not legally a
[2:03:33] legalist but spiritually based on love
[2:03:38] there are many that are legalists eating
[2:03:41] around the message although just urges
[2:03:44] go no but they dote air-quote their or a
[2:03:48] verse here verse there but it's not
[2:03:50] coming out of their hearts it's coming
[2:03:52] out of their heads no god help us that
[2:03:58] it's going to be spiritual revelation
[2:03:59] out of the heart so verse three said he
[2:04:03] humbly and suffer thee to hunger and fed
[2:04:06] them with manna which thou knewest not
[2:04:08] and neither did thy fathers know that he
[2:04:11] might make thee know that man does not
[2:04:14] live by bread only but by every word
[2:04:18] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[2:04:21] Lord does men live a man thy raiment wax
[2:04:28] not all upon thee nearly they foots well
[2:04:31] these 40 years thou shall also consider
[2:04:34] in thine heart that as a man chase it
[2:04:39] chasin rather and corrects his son so
[2:04:43] the LORD thy God
[2:04:44] chase nathie and he does therefore thou
[2:04:48] shalt keep the commandments of the LORD
[2:04:50] thy God to walk in his ways and to fear
[2:04:54] him and a theorem is to respect him have
[2:04:59] absolute respect for
[2:05:00] brother sister because God allows things
[2:05:05] to happen to bring it what's in your
[2:05:08] heart a man that those who are going to
[2:05:12] go all the way or those who are going to
[2:05:14] refuse to go all the way with God
[2:05:18] according to look to go the with what
[2:05:20] God wants you to do by all I want God to
[2:05:25] do it God want you to do it listen all
[2:05:29] the signs and the wonders that God did
[2:05:31] to bring Israel out of Egypt now
[2:05:34] consider what he did in Egypt consider
[2:05:37] what he did bringing them out of Egypt
[2:05:38] and brother then they refused to have
[2:05:41] the faith to go in and possess the
[2:05:43] promised land surely if God did what he
[2:05:48] did in the age of and God did what he
[2:05:49] did in the Warner's surely God was able
[2:05:51] to do what he they needed to be done in
[2:05:57] the promised land Joshua and Caleb
[2:06:00] they didn't doubt they said if God be
[2:06:04] for us who can be against us and and
[2:06:08] Caleb was an old man that's right he was
[2:06:11] an old man but about you young people
[2:06:19] you've got before us who can be against
[2:06:21] us you believe that God is able to take
[2:06:24] us him oh well God's through William
[2:06:28] Branham brought us out with all the
[2:06:30] signs and the wonders that were done
[2:06:33] there many many an old person today
[2:06:36] don't even understand the Ministry of
[2:06:38] Woodham BAM they can't think they can't
[2:06:40] reconcile it that was on the internet
[2:06:42] they said how can we reconcile the signs
[2:06:45] and the wonders that wouldn't random did
[2:06:49] with the message that he preached you
[2:06:54] know they recognized what was it they're
[2:06:56] in well he the ministry that he had was
[2:07:00] like the ministry Jesus had and that
[2:07:03] word that was Jesus it wasn't with a man
[2:07:06] who was Christ using William Branham
[2:07:08] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[2:07:10] the heart and he was discerning the past
[2:07:12] the present the future
[2:07:14] of that person that's right praise the
[2:07:18] Lord
[2:07:18] amazing absolutely amazing brother
[2:07:23] caught Elvis to be sincere by others to
[2:07:30] believe God help us to have faith Isaiah
[2:07:35] chapter 3 a man
[2:07:51] I
[2:07:52] in Chapter three and oh there was one
[2:07:55] verse there well with five verse 10 it
[2:08:03] says say each of the righteous that it
[2:08:06] will be well with that with him for they
[2:08:10] shall eat the fruit of their doings and
[2:08:13] so will we
[2:08:16] what'd you do you're gonna have to eat
[2:08:19] it you're going to have to bear with it
[2:08:25] it says they shall eat the fruit of
[2:08:27] their doings but we said woe unto the
[2:08:30] wicked it should be held with them for
[2:08:34] the reward of his hands shall be given
[2:08:36] him as for my people children are their
[2:08:40] oppressors and women will over them the
[2:08:44] prophecy this is a woman's world and he
[2:08:47] said and women rule over them they said
[2:08:50] all my people they which lead thee cause
[2:08:53] thee to err and destroy the way of thy
[2:08:57] paths
[2:08:58] so there are true leaders honor the
[2:09:01] anointing of the Holy Ghost and there
[2:09:04] are false leaders under the anointing of
[2:09:06] the devil
[2:09:07] that's right when you hear a ministry
[2:09:12] make sure he's on that he's under the
[2:09:15] anointing of God not the devil oh yeah
[2:09:21] such as such was the deception in the
[2:09:23] first church age such was the deception
[2:09:25] down through the ages and in the last
[2:09:27] age in fact in the last age a Satan took
[2:09:32] the church over and Satan got total
[2:09:34] control of the churches and
[2:09:37] unfortunately Satan got controls some
[2:09:39] message churches yeah and that's why
[2:09:43] that the Antichrist is going to rule
[2:09:46] over the earth and it's going to be
[2:09:48] religious you know and like I said you
[2:09:52] wanted to go and join them and be called
[2:09:54] this and they call that nobody couldn't
[2:09:56] you can go along with them and say yeah
[2:09:59] I go along I agree with you I agree with
[2:10:01] you and many many are going to agree
[2:10:03] with with the Pope
[2:10:05] are going to agree with Rome then you're
[2:10:07] going to agree with with denomination
[2:10:09] business so oh yeah they'll agree with
[2:10:10] it you know yeah I agree we need that we
[2:10:14] need this we need that now and they'll
[2:10:18] sell their souls now brother it's gonna
[2:10:23] be so deceiving and he's gonna eat going
[2:10:26] to control everything god help us sure
[2:10:31] brother that says my people they which
[2:10:34] lead thee cause thee to err to go in the
[2:10:41] wrong path just another couple of
[2:10:44] scriptures let's go to Matthew chapter
[2:10:48] 15 so this makes sure we're under the
[2:10:53] correct leadership controlled by God not
[2:10:58] the devil in Matthew chapter 15 and
[2:11:08] beginning to read at verse 10 and it
[2:11:14] says he
[2:11:15] all the multitude have said unto them
[2:11:16] hear and understand a lot people who are
[2:11:22] hearing it but they're not understanding
[2:11:23] it
[2:11:24] the Bible says get wisdom but get
[2:11:27] understanding a lot of people come you
[2:11:31] have wisdom and they know the word and
[2:11:32] they can quote the word and they can say
[2:11:34] this and say that but they're lacking
[2:11:36] understanding of the will of God for
[2:11:41] these circumstances or that issue or
[2:11:45] their another issue oh yeah you gotta
[2:11:48] have understanding that's right so you
[2:11:53] what you what you do you're doing the
[2:11:55] spirit led by the spirit so you're not
[2:11:57] going to do it in the flesh and led by
[2:11:59] your flesh god help us oh yeah there are
[2:12:04] people that just read the word the
[2:12:05] letter of the word and can handle
[2:12:07] condemn everybody except themselves by
[2:12:12] God will condemn them that's right
[2:12:15] brother
[2:12:16] I'll tend to this if you if you
[2:12:20] experienced the grace of God you'll
[2:12:24] reflect it by showing grace to others
[2:12:28] most definitely oh yeah brother again if
[2:12:35] we love God
[2:12:36] we'll love others by the grace of God
[2:12:39] oh my but it's so little of that today
[2:12:45] Peter were there to condemn and
[2:12:47] criticize yeah but what about what about
[2:12:51] lying yourself up with the word judge
[2:12:54] yourself first
[2:12:56] there's too many looking into it again
[2:12:58] like I said such a Sunday too many are
[2:13:00] looking into the to them well we say the
[2:13:02] mirror the Bible says the glass of the
[2:13:05] Word of God and then they see themselves
[2:13:08] but then they walk away and forget what
[2:13:10] they saw a lot of he was sitting under
[2:13:13] the hearing of the word and they see
[2:13:15] themselves but then they'll walk out to
[2:13:17] forget what they saw forget what they
[2:13:19] heard yeah
[2:13:24] how many in the hearing of my voice are
[2:13:27] playing of the word to themselves yeah I
[2:13:35] tell you if anything the word will do
[2:13:38] the revelation in our hearts it humbly
[2:13:43] Lord please your grace and if you no
[2:13:49] matter what you saw you say there goes
[2:13:53] me but for the grace of God the prophet
[2:13:56] of God said if you see if you see a
[2:13:58] brother or sister he said at fault or in
[2:14:01] a mistake or something he said pray
[2:14:04] graced pray for them the grace of God
[2:14:07] for them god help us brother remember
[2:14:16] the same job in wherewith you judge
[2:14:18] others God judge you that's the truth
[2:14:26] oh yeah god be with us
[2:14:35] in verse 10 he said he called the
[2:14:39] multitude and said unto them hear and
[2:14:40] understand now that was good into the
[2:14:43] mouth their part of the man but that was
[2:14:45] cometh out of the mouth
[2:14:46] this default of the man and then came
[2:14:49] his disciples and said unto Him knowest
[2:14:52] though that the Pharisees were offended
[2:14:54] after they heard this same but he
[2:14:59] answered and said every plant which my
[2:15:01] Evony father had not planted shall be
[2:15:04] rooted up I trust were the plants that
[2:15:08] he planted let them alone
[2:15:12] he said they be blind the leaders of the
[2:15:15] blind and if the blind lead the blind
[2:15:18] both shall fall into the ditch
[2:15:23] amen make sure you're under the ministry
[2:15:30] that has clear eyes to see the reveal
[2:15:32] word to understand the revealed word not
[2:15:38] just to know it intellectually or the
[2:15:41] mechanics of it but to have the
[2:15:43] mechanics and the dynamics of it exactly
[2:15:47] the one thing to have the mechanics but
[2:15:50] you need the dynamics to know what to do
[2:15:51] when to do and how to do it don't go by
[2:15:55] the letter of the word you got to go by
[2:15:57] the spirit of the word a man praise the
[2:16:01] Lord all right let's go to one more
[2:16:03] scripture here and that's in Romans book
[2:16:06] of Romans chapter eight Romans chapter
[2:16:13] eight
[2:16:22] I haven't got to the notes that I wrote
[2:16:24] for tonight and we'll get to him Sunday
[2:16:28] nor Willy in Romans chapter 8 in verse
[2:16:31] 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not
[2:16:35] to the flesh to live after the flesh for
[2:16:39] if ye live after the flesh you shall die
[2:16:41] a man many are living after the flesh
[2:16:44] what the flesh wants and what's
[2:16:46] important to the flesh but there's got
[2:16:49] to be the soul what's important to the
[2:16:51] soul and you lead the rest with God just
[2:16:55] do what you got to do and leave it all
[2:16:57] with God if you live after the flesh you
[2:17:00] shall die but it eats through the spirit
[2:17:03] to mortify the deeds of the body you
[2:17:06] shall live kill the deeds of the body
[2:17:09] amen
[2:17:10] so that you're not governed by the
[2:17:13] senses of your body you're governed by
[2:17:14] faith for as many as are led by the
[2:17:18] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[2:17:21] so are you led by the Spirit of God are
[2:17:25] you led by the Holy Ghost in what do you
[2:17:28] think say do act react are you led by
[2:17:33] the Spirit the proof the evidence that
[2:17:38] is not me that lives is Christ that
[2:17:40] liveth in me not many but there's there
[2:17:47] are a few who are led by the spirit and
[2:17:51] they walk by the spirit they talk by the
[2:17:54] spirit they keep their minds and
[2:17:56] attitudes and spirits right for as many
[2:18:00] as are led by the Spirit of God they are
[2:18:02] the sons of God for he had not received
[2:18:05] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[2:18:07] you have received the spirit of adoption
[2:18:09] whereby we cry Abba Father the Spirit
[2:18:14] itself bears witness with our spirit
[2:18:16] that we are the children of God amen god
[2:18:23] bless his word praying that we are led
[2:18:25] by the spirit the evidence the token
[2:18:29] that we are the sons of God that we are
[2:18:33] the and that you are the daughters of
[2:18:35] God
[2:18:37] and brother to remind to leave these
[2:18:40] thoughts with you again I did quote it
[2:18:43] on Sunday considering the hour in which
[2:18:48] we lived this is a serious subject
[2:18:50] concerning the last days the believers
[2:18:52] are warned that false leaders and false
[2:18:55] leadership would prevail to the extent
[2:18:59] it would deceive the very elect if
[2:19:01] possible now brother that otic put us on
[2:19:04] our guard deceive the very elect if
[2:19:07] possible if possible thank God is not
[2:19:12] possible I know there was a preacher
[2:19:16] that did that preached Oh y'all you can
[2:19:20] be a you're going to you could be the
[2:19:22] very like men be deceived Noah says if
[2:19:24] possible amen so we deceive the very
[2:19:29] elect if possible such deceit causes man
[2:19:33] to serve God contrary to the correct
[2:19:35] will of God what is the correct will of
[2:19:39] God let's make sure we're in the in the
[2:19:42] will of God doing the will of God think
[2:19:45] the will of God act the will of God
[2:19:46] living out the will of God not what you
[2:19:50] think what God thinks Amen most
[2:19:56] we have to make sure that the leader you
[2:19:58] are following is under the true
[2:20:00] anointing of the holy girls keeping us
[2:20:03] in line with the truth the whole truth
[2:20:05] and nothing but the truth to give us the
[2:20:07] faith that is pleasing to God
[2:20:09] for it is by faith that God leads us the
[2:20:13] revelation of his will and his word for
[2:20:15] the hour in which we live
[2:20:18] amen I gave you the scripture said the
[2:20:22] Lord was the laid on my heart to share
[2:20:25] with you concerning God's leadership and
[2:20:30] how God leads and why God leads us they
[2:20:34] meant we need leadership amen without it
[2:20:41] will not make it we need the leadership
[2:20:44] of God the weight the way that God has
[2:20:46] ordained it and predestinated it that
[2:20:50] God has set in the church a fivefold
[2:20:52] ministry to lead the people but let's
[2:20:55] make sure we're that the ministry that
[2:20:57] were under is under the right anointing
[2:20:59] and and also as the pastor the prophet
[2:21:03] rather is already ministered on choosing
[2:21:08] a bride and he compared it to choosing a
[2:21:10] church they were choosing a bride to the
[2:21:15] church and he said so you don't want
[2:21:18] that person to person you choose they
[2:21:20] want their spirit to get on you a man
[2:21:23] and he says like it's like going to a
[2:21:25] church he said go to certain churches he
[2:21:27] said and to spirit the pastor he is all
[2:21:30] over the congregation no no we don't
[2:21:34] want to spare the pastor to have control
[2:21:35] and that's the truth
[2:21:37] there's a lot of churches and the spirit
[2:21:39] of the ministry controls the people they
[2:21:41] do their worshiping the ministry becomes
[2:21:44] a God
[2:21:45] yeah but knowing you got it it's the
[2:21:49] Holy Ghost got to control you amen and
[2:21:51] it's God's with the Holy Ghost through
[2:21:53] the ministry preaching and ministering
[2:21:55] to the people amen - up with the word
[2:21:59] amen by the grace of God amen
[2:22:02] so that we're going to get the faith
[2:22:04] that pleases God
[2:22:10] just a quote err this is leadership but
[2:22:14] it is not the same message that he
[2:22:17] preached in California this was this
[2:22:21] message with December the 765 and this
[2:22:25] message right here was October the 31st
[2:22:29] 65 and not only just a message on
[2:22:33] leadership but he was preaching it to
[2:22:35] young young brothers and sisters it was
[2:22:41] a youth meeting and he preached
[2:22:44] leadership and he was encouraging the
[2:22:47] young people to make sure that they come
[2:22:49] under God's leadership he says you're
[2:22:52] going to be under my mom's leadership
[2:22:54] for a while you'll be under dad's
[2:22:56] leadership you'll be under the
[2:22:58] ministry's leadership you'll be under
[2:23:00] this leadership but he said make sure he
[2:23:02] said that God's in control amen
[2:23:06] you're going to answer to God it's not
[2:23:08] answering to mom not answering the day
[2:23:10] and not answering to to the past or the
[2:23:13] shepherd it's answering to God amen
[2:23:16] it is the word your good answer to the
[2:23:18] Lord and so he preached this in October
[2:23:21] the 31st and in Arizona let me just give
[2:23:30] you one quote he said now sometimes
[2:23:33] other leadership's get so much influence
[2:23:37] on us till we don't know what to do
[2:23:41] when the time comes to accept Christ as
[2:23:47] our Savior amen now
[2:23:51] so what a fatal thing it is to reject
[2:23:55] the leadership to eternal life because
[2:23:58] that's life that can never end so we got
[2:24:03] to make sure that we have the correct
[2:24:04] leadership aim and our young people need
[2:24:07] to make sure they got the correct
[2:24:08] leadership that's gonna lead them to
[2:24:10] eternal life amen
[2:24:12] lead him to heaven not to hell Amen
[2:24:16] that's the truth because unfortunately
[2:24:17] many are going to end up in Hell
[2:24:20] thinking they're going to heaven the
[2:24:24] grace of God to us brother it's like I
[2:24:28] said before concerning those that those
[2:24:31] that cry for the rocks and the mountains
[2:24:32] to fall on them and hide them from the
[2:24:34] face of him that sits on the throne
[2:24:38] why because it finally dawned on them
[2:24:41] they were right and they were wrong and
[2:24:44] he was right and his bride was remember
[2:24:46] remember the bride sits with him in this
[2:24:48] role he man and so their direct Knology
[2:24:52] he was right but they're not repentant
[2:24:56] if they didn't repent when they were
[2:24:58] here they're not gonna repaint they're
[2:25:00] so their spirit and her attitude is
[2:25:02] gonna be wrong there as it was there a
[2:25:05] man they says hide us from the from him
[2:25:09] that sits on the throne the face of him
[2:25:11] god help us brother that we're going to
[2:25:13] humble ourselves to him and be and come
[2:25:16] under his control and beyond her his
[2:25:19] leadership morning noon and night the
[2:25:21] brother whatever we do we didn't make
[2:25:23] the decision God made the decision
[2:25:25] that's why I've tried to encourage it
[2:25:28] and I'm not doing it to boast brother
[2:25:30] journals anything like that not not by
[2:25:33] any means I'm standing by the grace of
[2:25:36] God that's right but no matter what I
[2:25:42] did as I said told you before I accepted
[2:25:45] it as the will of God I didn't look for
[2:25:48] this kind of a job that kind of a job
[2:25:49] that kind of a job no ice lord what's
[2:25:51] your will I said what did you want me to
[2:25:55] do
[2:25:55] where's you want me to go didn't matter
[2:25:57] to me absolutely that's why I like I
[2:26:02] said ended up working in Gander ended up
[2:26:04] working here in st. John's
[2:26:05] working in Labrador in Goose Bay for the
[2:26:09] American military and the Canadian
[2:26:11] military and our yeah forces and so on
[2:26:15] and then working for pharmacies and so
[2:26:21] on and I said Lord US or whatever you
[2:26:24] want me to do and he would bring me in
[2:26:27] contact with the right individuals Oh a
[2:26:29] lot of things have happened why because
[2:26:32] I was letting God lead not me Lord but
[2:26:37] yet thank God a sinner saved by grace
[2:26:41] amen but still the Lord was using me
[2:26:46] same with you you think God's going to
[2:26:49] use you because me you might be a good
[2:26:51] person no no no God goes out and you'll
[2:26:58] find maybe the worst out there before
[2:27:01] because they're gonna be humble to
[2:27:03] realize what it means to be a sinner
[2:27:05] saved by grace
[2:27:07] amen see again like the prophet of God
[2:27:11] departed brothers where the brook nor
[2:27:13] told not to condemn this one not to
[2:27:15] condemn that one
[2:27:16] he said because there was you but for
[2:27:18] the grace of God and just you remember
[2:27:21] that time he had the vision in that
[2:27:24] restaurant I believe it was and that
[2:27:26] woman was there and with him it with
[2:27:30] another man and I think she had her hair
[2:27:32] dyed and she had this she had that and
[2:27:35] and he was condemning her in his mind in
[2:27:41] his mind and the angel said he said go
[2:27:46] over there stand by the door and he went
[2:27:49] over stood by the door and he looked up
[2:27:51] and he saw Jesus and he saw himself and
[2:27:57] he saw himself do something that he'd
[2:28:01] never written who have never remembered
[2:28:03] he never thought about it and it went
[2:28:06] off and Jesus caught it and he said see
[2:28:11] he said that's used and he said would
[2:28:14] condemn you see if it went up to God now
[2:28:17] he said
[2:28:18] he's now he's you want to give him her
[2:28:23] and he said the same grace for you is
[2:28:25] the same brace for her so he repented
[2:28:30] what yeah the Prophet repented and he
[2:28:35] went and he sat down talked with her but
[2:28:38] his spirit was different and his
[2:28:40] attitude was different
[2:28:41] oh yeah he was humbled God humbled him
[2:28:46] and brother/sister the hour is coming oh
[2:28:50] yeah don't it the only ones going into
[2:28:53] rapture are those that are humble the
[2:28:56] humble those that humble themselves will
[2:28:59] be exalted by the grace of God a humble
[2:29:03] spirit a humble attitude amen
[2:29:06] you pray for this one you pray for that
[2:29:08] one you pray for somebody else a man
[2:29:10] that's right so the prophet of God would
[2:29:12] condemn sometimes sin and what this
[2:29:15] woman did or what this person did it
[2:29:16] that person was doing but he prayed for
[2:29:19] them he said yeah cuz there was one of
[2:29:24] Brennan but for the grace of God amen so
[2:29:28] god help us is my prayer to be more
[2:29:30] sincere more humble and more loving amen
[2:29:35] and that we love one another
[2:29:37] I'll put it this way as we love God just
[2:29:41] say do you love one another as much as
[2:29:44] you love God as tremendous if you do you
[2:29:48] will lay your life down for that person
