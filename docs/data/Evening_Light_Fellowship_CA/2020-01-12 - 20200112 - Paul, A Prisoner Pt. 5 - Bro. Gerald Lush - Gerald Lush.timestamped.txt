[55:06] before we really get the message
[55:08] a man brother we need to know what God
[55:11] has done what God is doing and a man and
[55:14] not just to have their what he's doing
[55:16] here he's doing he knew they met the
[55:19] grace of God turn with me to the book of
[55:22] numbers chapter 14 a man and remind that
[55:28] you can get a copy of this calendar as
[55:31] you wish it and the voice of God has
[55:35] sent I think was neon copies of this
[55:37] calendar and just to show you the
[55:41] January month see this is January so you
[55:49] can get a copy calendar on your on your
[55:51] way out
[55:52] amen and again it saw it on advertised
[55:56] on the on the voice of God cortines
[55:58] homepage amen
[56:00] I was thinking about ordering some
[56:03] copies but I didn't realize that brother
[56:05] Joseph already 20 copies in the mail a
[56:08] man I think is around 20 H or and so
[56:12] there be there's there's a lot there for
[56:13] all of us man God blesses and in numbers
[56:18] for Dean pay attention to the word
[56:22] because it comes by hearing the word
[56:24] amen but have the faith that God wants
[56:28] us to have understanding that God wants
[56:30] us to have a man and again that will
[56:33] bring out shortly because earnings
[56:35] people say I believe the message but
[56:38] again as the father of God you believe
[56:39] it in your head because you don't
[56:40] believe it in your heart
[56:41] amen so again this list I press whether
[56:45] it's of God that we're not going to
[56:47] believe it intellectually we're going to
[56:49] believe it
[56:49] spiritually God has revealed it to us in
[56:53] our source amen
[56:55] there are many of their believing it
[56:56] intellectually but again they're not
[56:58] bitter spiritually they say I believe
[57:00] the message and they go to what they
[57:02] want to do and oh yeah they try to
[57:04] justify themselves
[57:06] they're gonna do what they whatever is
[57:08] right in their own eyes they'll do this
[57:09] do that
[57:10] oh yeah but I be the message amen but
[57:12] that's that's as far as it goes
[57:14] we're brother when it comes to what
[57:16] others require he's looking for the word
[57:18] manifested in your flesh amen and now
[57:21] that I believe it in my head but brother
[57:23] let go go forth and show show them all
[57:26] go forth and reflected to the world as
[57:28] Jesus did a man and brother that was
[57:31] again remember again that was the that
[57:33] was the bridegroom and now he's in the
[57:35] bride a man and again he's gonna he's
[57:38] gonna live Dame life take the same stand
[57:40] and same testimony a man gonna stay with
[57:43] the word amen he stayed with the word
[57:46] for that day 2,000 years ago now in you
[57:50] he's going to stay with the word of this
[57:51] day
[57:52] amen so the grace of God with us and
[57:55] here's a lesson here in numbers chapter
[57:57] 14 and all the congregation lifted up
[58:00] their voice and cried and the people
[58:04] wept that night they had come but
[58:09] imitated to go into the promise they
[58:12] were rejoicing with with God God Gabriel
[58:15] with what God did to bring them out but
[58:18] they weren't they weren't really into
[58:19] what God wanted them to do to go in and
[58:21] possess the land amen
[58:24] so god help us and as says they lifted
[58:27] up their voice right and the people went
[58:30] that night but they were seeking the
[58:32] will of God and it said all the children

[1:06:55] mayor that really want to win that we
[1:06:58] really want to get out of here and into
[1:07:00] eternity maybe we didn't want to go into
[1:07:02] glory

[1:07:27] us to look for and we got to do it the
[1:07:29] way that God wants us to do it amen we
[1:07:32] got experienced it the way that God was
[1:07:34] just to experience it a man is like the
[1:07:37] quote leader in the message Christ in

[1:08:07] what we're experiencing a mayor and God
[1:08:10] is going to a lot of us to come to pass
[1:08:12] a man it's going to excel in our faith
[1:08:14] he's challenging us do you really
[1:08:16] believe what I have done a man and do
[1:08:19] you really believe I am doing a man is
[1:08:22] until you rejoice in coming out of
[1:08:24] domination or Bunch but are you are your
[1:08:27] rejoicing going into the Promised Land
[1:08:29] in May of the glorified bought praise
[1:08:32] the name of the Lord and brother let's
[1:08:36] see if I can find that yes a saying in
[1:08:42] this message it is on page 40 and he
[1:08:45] should have fame minister he said said a
[1:08:48] while ago and he said brother Branham if
[1:08:52] I could just have the joy of the Lord in
[1:08:55] my heart because amen he fell he was be
[1:09:02] vinod he was following God following our
[1:09:05] leadership but wasn't experiencing the
[1:09:07] anointing that he used to experience it
[1:09:10] wasn't he wasn't in the land it wasn't
[1:09:13] in the ending the church anyway no
[1:09:15] matter where he went he couldn't he
[1:09:17] couldn't find that joy of the Lord and
[1:09:19] the partners on what the part of God
[1:09:21] said all brothers either getting to the
[1:09:24] message and you get the joy of the Lord
[1:09:26] now Oh see it's more serious and yeah
[1:09:32] and he give it gives us a challenge to
[1:09:34] me it is a chance to go in and possess
[1:09:36] the land a man and his shirts and the
[1:09:40] public guard said this to the brother
[1:09:42] and he said son he was asking where's
[1:09:46] the joy and he says son he said the
[1:09:50] revival is over amen and this was August
[1:09:55] 1965 and he says see now he said the
[1:09:58] stabilisers has been put on the ship
[1:10:01] amen it's not like a use of an end it's
[1:10:04] going with the leaves in it and
[1:10:06] everything and all we have Berets Lord

[1:10:09] may know we're faced with a with a
[1:10:11] greater challenge amen
[1:10:13] and he says see the stabilisers is put
[1:10:16] on the ship and he said great fearful
[1:10:19] waves are earlier before us that's why
[1:10:23] we're feeling the when he filled a man
[1:10:26] considering what is what prophecies were
[1:10:28] going to fulfill in this hour and in
[1:10:31] this age you and I are witness what they
[1:10:33] never witnessed a man because God had
[1:10:36] already known this through the Ministry
[1:10:38] of a prophet he's sure but it was
[1:10:41] ejected a man he was turned down and
[1:10:44] listened see the prophet of God was
[1:10:47] given these two signs and what for he's
[1:10:49] to get a people to believe God is
[1:10:53] looking for looking for in you and in me
[1:10:54] it is our faith that we believe what God
[1:10:58] is doing a man is not just good to be
[1:11:00] able to believe what God has done
[1:11:02] can you believe we believe what God was
[1:11:04] doing in their day now us to believe
[1:11:06] what God is doing in her day a may
[1:11:08] because this all 50 years since the goal
[1:11:11] of the Prophet a man and so he said the
[1:11:15] son he said you do when it comes to this
[1:11:17] joy you delivered it in your heart you
[1:11:19] know feel it and to son the revival is
[1:11:21] over and the stabilisers has been put on
[1:11:24] the ship and the graves are out here
[1:11:27] before us but we know just beyond the
[1:11:30] way under we're nearing the show amen
[1:11:33] but we're seeing the surgeon of the
[1:11:35] ailment but at the same time we have the
[1:11:39] revelation of what God is doing in

[1:16:54] better way to do what we do better than
[1:16:56] that if Moses had to do and what was
[1:16:57] that get the people to believe a man and
[1:17:02] they believed to come out but they
[1:17:03] didn't believe they William a man so as
[1:17:06] the same thing in this hour of this age
[1:17:08] we believe that come out of denomination
[1:17:10] but how many are believing to go into
[1:17:12] the Promised Land and they are believing
[1:17:14] to go into the resurrection and the
[1:17:16] rapture amen
[1:17:18] oh yeah they believe the message but
[1:17:20] let's let let's act on the message let's
[1:17:22] go to live demand let the message be
[1:17:24] flesh in you amen by the grace of God
[1:17:28] let the message control you they've
[1:17:30] become a prisoner to the message become
[1:17:33] a prisoner to the word ain't no Joshua
[1:17:37] and Caleb I became prisoners in Egypt
[1:17:39] they were prisoners in the wilderness
[1:17:40] they were prisoners to go in and possess
[1:17:42] the Promised Land anybody they weren't
[1:17:45] going to they weren't going to be
[1:17:46] influenced way by anything else but the
[1:17:49] word there were go the influenced way to
[1:17:50] the else but the servant of God Moses
[1:17:53] amen
[1:17:53] they stayed with the word they stayed
[1:17:56] with the message they stayed with the
[1:17:57] messenger a man and the God took the
[1:18:00] messenger off the scene ain't mayor
[1:18:02] that's right
[1:18:03] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a
[1:18:07] man again the evidence of what God did
[1:18:10] God is doing a name that God took the
[1:18:13] messenger of the sea took Moses into the
[1:18:15] mountain a mannington and called him
[1:18:17] into glory amen
[1:18:19] and he said Joshua and Caleb on do with
[1:18:22] the leadership into the Promised Land
[1:18:24] ah there was another generation that
[1:18:27] rose up to go in and possess the
[1:18:29] promised land by the grace of God but
[1:18:31] just saying as he did so he has done
[1:18:34] today
[1:18:34] he took the messenger off the scene but
[1:18:36] he leaves us with the message and the
[1:18:38] responsibility what for to possess the
[1:18:41] promise for this hour and whether you
[1:18:44] faced gone Belarus a had gone way beyond
[1:18:47] what why were they possess in other ages
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:51] they did what God wanted to do now are
[1:18:53] we doing what God wants us to do amen
[1:18:55] and it's not just say I believed
[1:18:58] No and stay in the wilderness no no God
[1:19:02] with the message with the revelation
[1:19:03] comes the responsibility to act on it
[1:19:06] and get out I think I act are they
[1:19:09] possessed well what are we looking for
[1:19:11] we're looking for a new glory play body
[1:19:12] and we're looking for a resurrection
[1:19:14] we're looking for a rapture
[1:19:16] amen amen so the grace of God be with us
[1:19:19] in this era door brother we're seeing it
[1:19:21] we really look listen there's not that
[1:19:23] surely we see and especially brother God
[1:19:25] is going to let us stay the public God
[1:19:27] say what for because we're going to be
[1:19:30] tried amen as Jesus right we're going to
[1:19:33] try a man and brother oh my I pray Lord
[1:19:37] that we're not taking these things for
[1:19:39] granted and we're not thinking these
[1:19:40] things lately
[1:19:41] concerning what's going on in Australia
[1:19:43] concern either that plane crashed and
[1:19:46] concerning the other things are going on
[1:19:48] in the world and the crown around the
[1:19:49] world ain't bad no brother don't take it
[1:19:52] lightly
[1:19:52] it is the sign of the end of all things
[1:19:55] it is the saying that of the treatment
[1:19:58] of God coming down on the earth it's a
[1:20:00] sign of the fire of God falling on the
[1:20:03] earth amen brother
[1:20:05] it shows what it shows it truly it been
[1:20:08] the case that Satan is the god of this
[1:20:10] world and brother we want to get out of
[1:20:13] here
[1:20:14] amen wait because we got a revelation of
[1:20:16] the promise where gossiped is going to
[1:20:18] create a new heaven and a new earth for
[1:20:20] we don't want to stay in this one we
[1:20:22] want to get out of here what in the
[1:20:24] world would you want to stay here for
[1:20:26] what do you want to stay here another
[1:20:27] day for it but I'll tell you this there
[1:20:30] are many many many believers that are so
[1:20:32] caught up with everyday living and so
[1:20:34] cut out where there were the natural
[1:20:36] things of late that it did that the
[1:20:38] spiritual doesn't have preeminence there
[1:20:41] are more prisoners to the natural things
[1:20:43] of life than they are to the spiritual
[1:20:45] and that is the absolute truth and oh my
[1:20:48] my mind let go let God have his wings
[1:20:51] not what you want to do what does God
[1:20:53] want you to do because he is getting us
[1:20:55] ready to get out of here he's getting
[1:20:57] all my the resurrections right there the
[1:20:58] rapture is right here hey man what do
[1:21:01] you mean what is it it's right here in
[1:21:02] the revealed Word
[1:21:03] it's right here in the message of the
[1:21:05] hour Amen so we are we are entering into
[1:21:08] the reality direction the reality of the
[1:21:11] rapture I tell you this if Luther had
[1:21:13] anything and he had a rap salute
[1:21:15] tremendous reality of justification you
[1:21:18] couldn't convince Luther that he wasn't
[1:21:20] justified no know whence God quicken it
[1:21:22] and to him and reveal it to him in his
[1:21:24] heart there's no way no way he was
[1:21:28] justified and he went and he praised the
[1:21:30] Lord hallelujah hey man
[1:21:32] amen he wasn't justified by his works
[1:21:34] he's justified by his faith amen same
[1:21:37] way Wesley
[1:21:38] no wonder Wesley went out and preached
[1:21:39] five times a day oh yeah he'd get up in
[1:21:42] the morning go pray and pray for a
[1:21:44] couple of hours that he go and he gotta
[1:21:45] go preach they go a priest and they go
[1:21:47] preach and I gotta say they would go to
[1:21:49] the mines and your preach to those that
[1:21:52] came out they preach to those that were
[1:21:53] going in amen and then he went in
[1:21:56] priests again my brother what an
[1:21:58] anointing what a revival and brother day
[1:22:01] if the anointing and the revival do that
[1:22:03] to him and did did what it did to the
[1:22:05] Pentecostals because I was part of that
[1:22:08] over fifty years ago eight million and I
[1:22:11] knew what it was right it's certainly
[1:22:12] not like it now a man because after they
[1:22:16] this last week when we come in contact
[1:22:19] with with a couple of Pentecostal
[1:22:21] brethren and it's amazing and they're
[1:22:26] not just you know nobody there they're
[1:22:29] in there in tremendous positions you
[1:22:31] mean what they're doing and so on and
[1:22:33] like I say we went into the into Costco
[1:22:35] and and all of a sudden I went over and
[1:22:38] found sister Baden she was talking to
[1:22:40] this brother and at first I thought I
[1:22:43] thought he might have been this he might
[1:22:44] have been bad but I discovered oh he's
[1:22:48] the Pentecostal brother and our
[1:22:50] conversation went to the word a man but
[1:22:54] again you get the you get the
[1:22:56] justification or even from here that
[1:22:58] Pentecost is not what it was no no
[1:23:02] everything is changing he recognized
[1:23:04] that that we're living in a changing
[1:23:06] world and everything else was changing a
[1:23:08] man and again is just later on we met
[1:23:11] another individual a man not not in what
[1:23:14] I wasn't it was in paradise we met him
[1:23:16] and
[1:23:17] yeah anyway and we discovered Oh your
[1:23:19] Pentecost oh yes
[1:23:21] penny Kahn was surprised but again all
[1:23:24] of our conversations ended up on the
[1:23:26] word a man and not the word of yesterday
[1:23:29] but the word of today anybody
[1:23:32] well recognizing that it's not like it
[1:23:34] used to be and brother have there seen
[1:23:37] that I must have all right way to say it
[1:23:38] by the grace of Almighty God hey man sir
[1:23:42] brother God is requiring the both of us
[1:23:44] amen so it's a Pentecost I cannot be in
[1:23:48] the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:23:51] gifts of the Spirit and they were
[1:23:53] prophesy and they were speaking in times
[1:23:54] they were doing this and doing that amen
[1:23:56] but of course it's all gone now that
[1:23:59] anointing is not there like it used to
[1:24:00] be and again when we come to the word
[1:24:02] and the message of the hour there was
[1:24:04] praise there was worship hallelujah
[1:24:06] thank you lord
[1:24:06] thank you thank you thank you for the
[1:24:08] message thank you for bringing us out of
[1:24:10] denominationalism a million and above
[1:24:13] the public God referred to it as
[1:24:15] Egyptian denominationalism amen there
[1:24:19] was any in Egypt so we were also in a
[1:24:22] spiritual Egypt in nomination ilysm amen
[1:24:25] so he brought us out so we are not
[1:24:26] controlled by a church were controlled
[1:24:28] by God we're controlled by Jesus amen
[1:24:32] brother Han but now what about going in
[1:24:36] for brother thank God for all of that
[1:24:38] what he's done down here but I'll tell
[1:24:40] you what are this is all tremendous
[1:24:43] thank God for the revelation but now
[1:24:46] brother you know what that points us to
[1:24:48] point us to what God is looking for in
[1:24:49] you and me our responsibility any man
[1:24:55] and brother is not looking back and see
[1:24:58] what God did here there there are some
[1:25:00] routes down through the ages we believe
[1:25:02] it we say God for but Lord let me go let
[1:25:05] me go let go and let God have his way to
[1:25:08] do what you want to do now
[1:25:09] amen so I get caught up with that
[1:25:12] revelation okay and I just caught up
[1:25:14] with uncaught into it and he said me
[1:25:17] amen I mean it and as the probably Gaza
[1:25:21] you can be in the message with the
[1:25:22] message not in you and he was brother
[1:25:24] brown was seeing that as he come near
[1:25:26] the end of his ministry there's a lot in
[1:25:28] this message but I tell you there's not
[1:25:30] many got the
[1:25:30] jinda know if the measures in there the
[1:25:35] message controls them if the messages in
[1:25:37] there they are prisoners to the word hey
[1:25:40] man if the message in there they are
[1:25:42] prisoners to the word prisoners are the
[1:25:44] message of the error their lives are
[1:25:46] going to be governed by the word the
[1:25:48] lives are controlled by the message amen
[1:25:51] you're going to go there and live as
[1:25:52] believers you're going to live as sons
[1:25:54] and daughters of God they're going to go
[1:25:56] there and live as Jesus a man and you're
[1:25:59] not caught up with this old war you
[1:26:00] caught up with the spiritual under
[1:26:03] fighting brother Jesus or mine there are
[1:26:05] many things they said they didn't
[1:26:06] understand many things that he did they
[1:26:08] didn't understand why is he acting like
[1:26:10] this why is he doing this ain't man he
[1:26:12] was moving on to the fulfillment of the
[1:26:14] word for his day how do you a man
[1:26:18] brother and another moved on Wednesday
[1:26:21] and the Pentecost has moved on for their
[1:26:23] day amen but but then all of a sudden
[1:26:26] the Spirit begins to leave he wasn't
[1:26:29] doing that no more why because all all
[1:26:32] the all that he had prophesied and and
[1:26:34] to do in that hour it was done that's
[1:26:37] right Pentecostal revival they say was
[1:26:40] the most tremendous revival because it
[1:26:42] went around the world because this
[1:26:45] revival just went here that Ray Bobby
[1:26:47] just went there and so on but then God
[1:26:49] brought down to Pentecost revived that
[1:26:51] went around the world a man the power
[1:26:54] the anointing of the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[1:26:58] of the Spirit and brother what about
[1:27:00] then the crowning of the Pentecostal
[1:27:02] message as I said the probably garden in
[1:27:07] 1965 did say my ministry is the crowning
[1:27:09] of the vet acosta amen because why
[1:27:13] because there were those they're going
[1:27:15] on now men are going on there were those
[1:27:18] that were that believe that the
[1:27:20] Pentecostal message was going to go on
[1:27:21] to the resurrection of rapture and it
[1:27:23] did but they didn't believe it when God
[1:27:26] said the messenger to give them the
[1:27:28] message that would give them the
[1:27:29] revelation they needed for the
[1:27:31] resurrection and rapture David turned it
[1:27:33] down
[1:27:34] amen because amen to enter any become
[1:27:37] one with it they would had to line up
[1:27:39] with the word loyola the will of God
[1:27:41] brother they would come to that place
[1:27:44] that Jesus came to not my will time be
[1:27:47] done amen
[1:27:49] so have we come to that place after 40
[1:27:52] years were for the Saints fair and of
[1:27:55] course less for the younger ones area
[1:27:56] trying to serve God in the revealed Word
[1:27:59] old brothers sister are we prisoners to
[1:28:03] the message hey man
[1:28:05] and we come to that place that Jesus
[1:28:07] came to and is it just absolute truth
[1:28:09] can you really say that I've come to
[1:28:12] that place brother where Jesus came to
[1:28:14] not my will anymore your will be done
[1:28:19] anybody what do you mean not my wheels I
[1:28:22] wheel well well Lord for what purpose am
[1:28:25] I here for what purpose
[1:28:27] had you brought me to this word to this
[1:28:29] message Lord whatever the purpose of my
[1:28:32] life let it be done
[1:28:33] and the purpose of his life was to die
[1:28:37] the prayers of his life was to lay it
[1:28:39] down and pick it up again
[1:28:41] amen but been pick it up he had to
[1:28:44] suffer he was going to suffer this he
[1:28:47] knew more than what we knew really what
[1:28:48] he was going to suffer either he saw
[1:28:50] what lay ahead he knew more than what
[1:28:52] the disciples knew oh yeah then cuz even
[1:28:55] Peter wanted to stop it and again let's
[1:28:59] say thank the Lord you know that God to
[1:29:02] chose Peter amazing we wouldn't do it
[1:29:05] I'll tell you this I I got I got no ton
[1:29:08] of sermon back there somewhere and I
[1:29:10] said who would you choose to be your
[1:29:12] pastor and I said oh no they wouldn't
[1:29:17] choose that one or he preached too long
[1:29:18] he had too much to say or they wouldn't
[1:29:21] choose Peter no not by any means cuz he
[1:29:24] was this said he had this had this so on
[1:29:26] oh yeah oh there was a diet I had a
[1:29:29] whole big list of all those in the Bible
[1:29:31] of why they wouldn't have that one to be
[1:29:33] a pastor as they certainly wouldn't have
[1:29:35] Jeremiah
[1:29:36] no way no not by any means brother God
[1:29:41] have mercy on us amen
[1:29:44] so brother we want the Holy Ghost to be
[1:29:47] our pastor amen because as God is
[1:29:50] working in the church for the perfecting
[1:29:52] of the Saints brother oh my lord come on
[1:29:57] judge yourself by
[1:29:58] word of God is God making it flesh in
[1:30:01] you really Pentecost Milton lived it and
[1:30:05] they lived their message they lived the
[1:30:06] revelation they talked he did they spoke
[1:30:08] in tongues he they spoke about the gifts
[1:30:10] of the Spirit and when they did this
[1:30:12] they did that oh praise God hallelujah
[1:30:14] amen amen
[1:30:16] yeah yeah that reflected in their lives
[1:30:19] every day oh yeah we knew who saw
[1:30:22] someone going up the street maybe older
[1:30:24] Pentecostal oh yeah and we met so many
[1:30:28] to talk to or your petty cost oh yeah it
[1:30:30] was in them it weighs just controlled
[1:30:33] their thoughts their motives their
[1:30:34] objectives everything so are you under
[1:30:36] his control
[1:30:37] are you as prisoner now so you're going
[1:30:39] to not mind will Lord I'm going to do
[1:30:41] your will amen and I tell you the will
[1:30:44] of God now I tell you is going to be
[1:30:45] contrary to that to your own will
[1:30:48] well it's good I want you to do hey
[1:30:52] where does God want you to do it how
[1:30:54] does God want you to do it amen
[1:30:56] well he got a challenging every one of
[1:30:59] us now
[1:30:59] as believers the true believers what for
[1:31:03] he wants to hear what Jesus said not my
[1:31:05] will time be done amen
[1:31:09] because it's going from your natural
[1:31:10] life to a spiritual revelation Amen so
[1:31:14] that God controls you amen the
[1:31:17] revelation concerning the resurrection
[1:31:18] rapture controls us we are prisoners to
[1:31:21] the revelation of the resurrection
[1:31:23] we are closer to the revelation of the
[1:31:25] rapture yeah as I said blue there was a
[1:31:28] prisoner to that justification the
[1:31:30] Pentecostals were prisoners to what God
[1:31:32] was doing in there and through their not
[1:31:35] now but they were now the bride is a
[1:31:37] prisoner to the revelation of what God
[1:31:40] is doing always is what God is doing not
[1:31:43] what he will do and there's too many
[1:31:45] so-called believers are thinking the
[1:31:48] rapture is what God is going to do no
[1:31:50] he's doing it he's bailing
[1:31:53] oh no God God's gonna you know one of
[1:31:55] Jeff or we get to the resurrection for
[1:31:57] we getting the rapture you know we're
[1:31:58] going to have a wonderful time we
[1:32:00] already had it it's coming out now the
[1:32:05] challenge is going in amen amen
[1:32:09] oh we came out it was wonderful yes back
[1:32:12] there
[1:32:12] her mother or fifty years ago we came
[1:32:14] out of denominationalism and into the
[1:32:16] word into the measure they are aloha
[1:32:18] praise the Lord hallelujah hey man you
[1:32:20] know as I said Oh way everybody was in
[1:32:22] the church shouting and praising the
[1:32:24] Lord and then I remember brother bill
[1:32:26] like it's like I said brother Billy it's
[1:32:27] father and gone on many years now
[1:32:30] because even brother bill has gone on
[1:32:32] but I remember sitting in the church in
[1:32:34] Mishra Falls and we're having communion
[1:32:36] watching and our brother be like his
[1:32:39] father was there with his with his socks
[1:32:41] in his aim and he was shaking his socks
[1:32:43] and he was going around the altar and he
[1:32:46] was praising the Lord amen
[1:32:48] because God had brought us out but
[1:32:51] brother now we're here for God to take
[1:32:53] us him but there's a generation that
[1:32:57] came out there's a generation that goes
[1:32:59] in a man and I said the prophet of God
[1:33:02] again in one of these measures he said
[1:33:04] he said I know it's not striking the way
[1:33:06] it should because it wasn't the time and
[1:33:10] he says Easter's not striking me the way
[1:33:12] it should
[1:33:12] he said not seen it the way I should a
[1:33:14] man well what is the way we should see
[1:33:16] it to give us resurrection in rapture in
[1:33:19] pay hey man there's a coming out but
[1:33:23] there's a going in brother grace of God
[1:33:26] we were prisoners to the word there
[1:33:28] brought us out now let us be prisoners
[1:33:30] to the words of taken as he a man will
[1:33:33] continue under his leadership and under
[1:33:35] his control by the grace of God and he
[1:33:38] said really me to say it again
[1:33:46] he said the son of man was actually
[1:33:49] revealed potentially just for a few
[1:33:52] moments there and just before Sodom was

[1:35:11] for a few moments there just before
[1:35:13] Sodom was burned the Son of man was
[1:35:15] there revealed himself to move to Moses
[1:35:18] yeah god help us now he said that man
[1:35:24] was Elohim that was God and Jesus is God

[1:38:48] caught up together with them to meet the
[1:38:49] Lord in the air just think that's what
[1:38:53] we are looking for the reality of in
[1:38:56] flesh glorified flesh glorified bodies
[1:38:59] he may praise the Lord remember as one
[1:39:05] brother was challenging me one time but
[1:39:06] starting the kind of bodies were going
[1:39:08] into he was at you as a pastor and he
[1:39:12] believed were going in two bodies you
[1:39:13] know like this body right here but to be
[1:39:15] young young no I said not exactly I said
[1:39:19] here this body is the life of this
[1:39:22] bodies in the blood of it but ice when
[1:39:24] we get the glory I said the life of that
[1:39:25] body is is the word amen oh no we said
[1:39:29] we're going to go into with a flesh and
[1:39:31] blood no I said brother I said when
[1:39:33] Jesus rose from the dead he went to the
[1:39:34] disciples he didn't say don't look at me
[1:39:37] he said for flesh and blood as no don't
[1:39:39] don't have this no he's a flesh and bone
[1:39:41] I see never said blood I said he shed
[1:39:45] the blood for you and me and I said he
[1:39:48] sent the life of the blood back to you
[1:39:50] and me hey man
[1:39:51] so our brother I said were going into a
[1:39:53] body like his glorious body
[1:39:55] flesh and bone but not blood no but by
[1:40:00] any means any man because his life the
[1:40:03] life the Spirit of God will be the life
[1:40:05] of that body amen
[1:40:07] listen we come from eternity we're going
[1:40:08] back to eternity how many really believe
[1:40:11] that he's not here to save the devil's
[1:40:14] children he's here to say this and he
[1:40:16] knows who they are that's why Jesus said
[1:40:18] all the father's giving me will come to
[1:40:19] me and I will lose none yeah thank God
[1:40:24] for that part for that promise amen
[1:40:26] brother we believe that God gave us to
[1:40:29] Jesus that's why we're here that's why
[1:40:31] we're believing what we're baby that's
[1:40:33] why we're standing the way we stand and
[1:40:34] taking our stand for what we take amen
[1:40:37] well cause look we're reflecting jesus
[1:40:39] essa' jesus acted that's how Jesus
[1:40:42] reacted so Jesus talked yeah
[1:40:45] and so Jesus responded and you're doing
[1:40:47] the same thing that was Jesus 2,000
[1:40:50] years ago now is Jesus in the bright God
[1:40:55] Elvis
[1:40:56] amen he said that I he said they're even
[1:41:00] spiritually valuable and so on and he
[1:41:03] should have Minister said to me a while
[1:41:04] ago brother Benham if I could just have
[1:41:07] the joy of the Lord in my heart and I
[1:41:08] said son the revival is over now he said
[1:41:12] the stabilisers had been put on the ship
[1:41:13] great fearful waves out here he said
[1:41:16] before us but we know just beyond that
[1:41:18] way be under we are nearing the shore
[1:41:21] and he said just stay stable Amen
[1:41:27] because I tell you the anointing is not
[1:41:29] in the world like it used to be and
[1:41:32] that's what that brother was sensing the
[1:41:35] Spirit of God was was pulling away and
[1:41:37] why it's because there there was fewer
[1:41:40] and fewer and fewer that wanted him
[1:41:42] fewer fewer they had the anointing yeah
[1:41:47] and that's why you you felt that
[1:41:50] loneliness and if the believer is
[1:41:54] anything is lonely for God not only for
[1:41:57] Jesus lonely for the for the blessing
[1:41:59] lonely for more of the anointing not
[1:42:02] just kidding say well I believe the
[1:42:03] masses praise the Lord look what he did
[1:42:04] look what he did yeah what I'm going to
[1:42:06] say praise the Lord look what he done
[1:42:08] look what he's doing
[1:42:11] you got to get into the present tense
[1:42:13] revelation but too many are I meant too
[1:42:18] many messy churches they're just caught
[1:42:20] up with past tense
[1:42:21] revelation past tense what God has done
[1:42:24] how many are caught up with what God is
[1:42:27] doing how many got the anointing of the
[1:42:32] rapture in their hearts do you not need
[1:42:34] the resurrection in their souls
[1:42:37] that's Christ in you and you go forth
[1:42:41] again how many believers do you meet
[1:42:43] that that are more like Jesus put more
[1:42:47] emphasis on the word more instance on
[1:42:49] the spiritual part of your life how many
[1:42:52] is it you can I say that your Jesus oh
[1:42:58] yeah can I say oh yes Christ in that
[1:43:01] brother Christ in that sister my look at
[1:43:03] their lives look at their spirits look
[1:43:05] at their I had a seat you know
[1:43:08] does not their mom and dad or their
[1:43:10] grandma or grandpa that's Jesus
[1:43:13] hey man sister that's Jesus in that
[1:43:16] brother who's Jesus in that sister Oh
[1:43:18] Mon they're certainly not like mom and
[1:43:20] dad they were one time but when they're
[1:43:23] born again oh you're like you're you're
[1:43:26] like your heavenly mother and father a
[1:43:28] man praise the name of the Lord I don't
[1:43:32] know you it's just like God you know
[1:43:33] anyone that when Jesus was with the
[1:43:35] disciples and so on and and they come to
[1:43:38] him and said oh Jesus your mother and
[1:43:41] bring your brothers want to see you you
[1:43:42] see what your mother and your brothers
[1:43:44] he said who is my mother you learned my
[1:43:46] brother and he turned to those that were
[1:43:48] hearing the word he said this is my
[1:43:50] mother and my brothers hey man who is
[1:43:55] your issue really or your mother and
[1:43:57] your father and your brothers and
[1:43:58] sisters oh there's someone throw stones
[1:44:03] no no natural no no no if you're born
[1:44:07] again your emphasis is not under natural
[1:44:10] your emphasis is more and more on the
[1:44:12] spiritual a man and you're so caught up
[1:44:15] with your spiritual family and that that
[1:44:18] it will bring your it will cause your
[1:44:20] your natural family to be jealous oh
[1:44:22] yeah I think you're insane yeah they're
[1:44:25] jealous because why well you just say
[1:44:29] hello to us anybody you're just doing
[1:44:31] this you do that and then you gone on
[1:44:32] down there you're going on down there
[1:44:34] too to stay with them why because
[1:44:38] they're my brothers and sisters in
[1:44:39] Christ and we are bound eternally we
[1:44:44] have a greater and a greater and a
[1:44:45] greater union than the natural by the
[1:44:49] grace of Almighty God amen
[1:44:52] what brother that proves that you're a
[1:44:54] prisoner you're not a prisoner to the
[1:44:57] natural things you're a prisoner to the
[1:44:58] spiritual as Paul was a prisoner to the
[1:45:02] spiritual revelation of Jesus not the
[1:45:05] natural revelation of Jesus spiritual
[1:45:07] revelation of Jesus a man a world I pray
[1:45:10] God make us more and more prisoners to
[1:45:12] this message to the revealed word more
[1:45:15] more pleasures to what God is doing not
[1:45:18] what he's done there are those who are
[1:45:21] prisoners to what
[1:45:22] then but there's a few this prisoner to
[1:45:24] what he's doing and the father God
[1:45:26] warned us there's gonna be very very few
[1:45:29] living Saints go in the rapture if
[1:45:33] they're not being caught up now with the
[1:45:35] revealed word cut up morning noon and
[1:45:37] night a man controlled by it there
[1:45:40] you're just living different than
[1:45:41] anybody else if you're not caught up
[1:45:43] that way then you're not going to get
[1:45:45] caught up in the change of the body but
[1:45:49] if you're caught up spiritually and all
[1:45:51] your thoughts are spiritual your motives
[1:45:53] are spiritual your actions and reactions
[1:45:55] are spiritual oh my all I want to do is
[1:45:58] Lord I want you to be in it
[1:45:59] I want your leadership a man I want your
[1:46:02] blessings Lord a man like I said even

[1:46:08] the world and worked at this work that I
[1:46:10] did it with the Lord so yes like I said
[1:46:15] there were times when when I worked

[1:46:19] and I would say Lord I need your help
[1:46:21] please Lord I need your leadership I
[1:46:24] need your strength and I need your
[1:46:25] wisdom amen

[1:46:45] amen that's giving me that wisdom it's
[1:46:48] the Lord that's helping me a man and
[1:46:50] like I said one time when they were when
[1:46:52] they were looking for certain things
[1:46:54] before before they would open the store
[1:46:58] at the time there was a large department
[1:47:00] store and and they wanted they couldn't
[1:47:04] find it and they thought I wasn't

[1:47:18] they went on and so I found it yeah the
[1:47:22] Lord led me to it after I witnessed give
[1:47:25] the glory to Jesus brother is exactly
[1:47:28] again as our brother Joseph did in his
[1:47:30] interview some years ago concerning his
[1:47:32] work amen
[1:47:34] that he wouldn't do taking this
[1:47:35] advertisement that every time this and
[1:47:37] something else no because of his
[1:47:39] Christian faith I want to testimony to
[1:47:42] the world hey man that's right I got a
[1:47:45] raise that up and he's gonna judge many
[1:47:48] by it oh he will so brothers sister I
[1:47:51] pray God's grace that brother that got
[1:47:54] to be able to take your life and judge
[1:47:56] the world by it take your attitude and
[1:47:59] your spirit your anointing judge the
[1:48:00] world by him and say listen this was it
[1:48:02] right here I was in fleshing this but
[1:48:04] this gentleman I was in fleshing that
[1:48:06] brother this sister right there that's
[1:48:08] my son and daughter Grace so are you a
[1:48:14] prisoner to the revealed word stay
[1:48:19] humble stay in the word stay with God
[1:48:27] and no matter how you feel what anything
[1:48:31] else stay rutted the word he said let it
[1:48:35] be let it stay stable you keep your
[1:48:40] balance in the word it is God in you yes
[1:48:43] if it's God in you is God hidden and
[1:48:46] revealed in simplicity but it's gonna be
[1:48:51] the simple gospel life the several Holy
[1:48:54] Ghost life as it was in Jesus so it seen
[1:48:57] you along with the power in the
[1:49:00] anointing that he had he could have had
[1:49:02] a greater and greater and a greater
[1:49:03] ministry in the eyes of man all he had
[1:49:06] to do was go do this go do that go to
[1:49:08] this and just not not not to take the
[1:49:11] stand for this not to say this not to
[1:49:13] say that but Jesus took his stand for
[1:49:18] the word anybody oh he did this he did
[1:49:21] that he knew how to do this he knew how
[1:49:22] to do that he could do practically
[1:49:24] anything he is this there's a song I
[1:49:28] have constantly playing over my computer
[1:49:30] there he says he could have called
[1:49:32] 10,000 angels to destroy the world and
[1:49:36] set him free but he died for you and and
[1:49:41] that's the truth oh well they crucify
[1:49:44] him yeah but he that was according to
[1:49:46] the predestinated plan
[1:49:47] God that was the predestinated will of
[1:49:49] God what for because the yet to redeem
[1:49:53] us back or for by sinless blood we were
[1:49:56] born in sin he was born without seen and
[1:49:59] so he laid down he's gonna lay down his
[1:50:01] life to redeem us back the letter yes
[1:50:04] said the man not in the other
[1:50:06] the thundered over the balusters the
[1:50:08] sons and daughters of God a man you're
[1:50:12] redeemed which was a blood of Christ a
[1:50:13] session how many how many have taken it
[1:50:18] really serious concerning what Jesus has
[1:50:20] done brother as I said a lot of those
[1:50:24] paintings are not right because even
[1:50:27] though even in Gethsemane he said as it
[1:50:29] were great drops of blood yeah when I
[1:50:32] come when it comes to his sweat sweat
[1:50:34] that's a great word great drops of blood

[1:50:38] the pressure for the whole world
[1:50:40] including you and me look what he's
[1:50:42] suffered for you and me Oh what he just
[1:50:46] did that because of sin in the beginning
[1:50:47] no he did it to redeem us back probably
[1:50:50] God said he could have waked the whole
[1:50:51] thing off and started again but he
[1:50:54] wanted to reveal himself to his sons and
[1:50:56] daughters and further I trust that we're
[1:50:59] seeing the revelation of God loved him
[1:51:03] with all your heart why because of what
[1:51:07] he did and even some of the pictures of
[1:51:09] him on the cross some that's not
[1:51:13] right I say he said I said he he was
[1:51:17] covered with blood but on the cross
[1:51:20] there's only a little bit of blood here
[1:51:21] a little bit of blood there yeah no in
[1:51:25] reality he lit out all of his blood went

[1:53:33] get worse I can tell you right now be on
[1:53:37] your guard the world is going to get
[1:53:38] worse and worse and worse but but the
[1:53:41] public God did say you're staying and
[1:53:43] you're experiencing these things because
[1:53:45] God wants to manifest your faith wants
[1:53:48] to try you and it'll it'll bring out
[1:53:50] your nature or if there's anything
[1:53:53] that's being manifested now it's the
[1:53:54] nature of believers why are they
[1:53:57] focusing on natural spiritual and too
[1:54:01] many are caught up with the natural and
[1:54:02] not with the spiritual and again let me
[1:54:08] says read read it again you see all
[1:54:10] these great big clouds around us storms
[1:54:13] are coming atomic bombs and everything
[1:54:16] else talking about but our stabilizer is
[1:54:19] right straight in the word God said it
[1:54:22] would be here and will crest every one
[1:54:24] of them and we'll go straight over the
[1:54:27] top of them waves and he said they can't
[1:54:29] sink us
[1:54:30] they can't drown us he said you put us
[1:54:32] in the grave and we'll come out again it
[1:54:37] is the grace of God amen
[1:54:41] why because we're in the evening light
[1:54:42] of the revealed Word by the grace of God
[1:54:46] amen so brother
[1:54:56] are we just agreeing intellectually with
[1:54:58] the word or are we applying it to our
[1:55:01] lives confirming the revelation is the
[1:55:04] word made flesh in us amen
[1:55:09] the message not this it's you yeah
[1:55:16] hey man okay God takes it out of this oh
[1:55:19] yeah it goes from this well just brings
[1:55:22] us here and when you come here it it
[1:55:26] comes in us Christ in us the hope of
[1:55:28] glory amen by the grace of Almighty God
[1:55:31] so lord help us to be any brother if
[1:55:35] we're really prisoner
[1:55:36] yeah we're brought we're brought from
[1:55:39] this into this and this into into our
[1:55:41] hearts and souls not intellectually not
[1:55:43] the letter of the word but the spirit of
[1:55:45] the word by the grace of God amen
[1:55:49] brother
[1:55:50] the revival Oh certain things I can't
[1:55:57] say but I trust were a confirmation of
[1:56:01] the bright revival what what part of
[1:56:07] that revival are you reflecting to your
[1:56:09] family friends and neighbors or just
[1:56:13] this doctrine that doctrine and all we
[1:56:15] believe William Branham in our heads no
[1:56:20] more to it than that it goes beyond that
[1:56:24] brother when it comes to the they were
[1:56:27] first of all reflecting modes but they
[1:56:30] certainly wouldn't have nothing to do
[1:56:32] with a reflect just one Caleb and their
[1:56:34] faith so God took Moses off the scene so
[1:56:38] now Moses was gone now they were faced
[1:56:40] and challenged to believe what Joshua
[1:56:43] and Caleb were saying but what were you
[1:56:46] going to do pick up stones and stone
[1:56:48] them that's right and in any true
[1:56:53] servant of God today the ldls try to
[1:56:55] stone
[1:56:56] oh yeah stoner with this don't so with
[1:56:59] that stone rather stay with the word
[1:57:03] thank God for the word thank God for a
[1:57:06] ministry there or here or somewhere else
[1:57:08] over there thank God for that brother
[1:57:10] that's going to stay with the word and
[1:57:12] encourage the people to stay with the
[1:57:14] word God let me I'll have to finish with
[1:57:19] this there's another scripture but we
[1:57:23] will leave it to Wednesday the Lord
[1:57:25] willing I've shared it with you before
[1:57:32] share with you again Oh God make us
[1:57:36] prisoners you want to be a prisoner
[1:57:40] uh-huh oh I was I was a prisoner in
[1:57:44] denomination feel like God set me free
[1:57:46] no he took you out of that and brought
[1:57:48] you into the word and you become a
[1:57:50] prisoner to the word
[1:57:51] oh yeah probably God highlights that in
[1:57:54] in the message Paul a prisoner why he
[1:57:57] said Paul he see was beginning to see
[1:57:59] himself not just as a prisoner in that
[1:58:01] natural prison but a prisoner to the
[1:58:03] word spiritually God have mercy God make
[1:58:09] us prisoners you want to become a
[1:58:11] prisoner well I'm already prisoner good
[1:58:16] amen
[1:58:17] if you're a prisoner you're gonna follow
[1:58:18] the the leadership of the one to whom
[1:58:20] you're a prisoner and he said from our
[1:58:24] own selfish ambitions
[1:58:26] yeah dude most of the world and most of
[1:58:30] believers are caught up with selfish
[1:58:31] ambitions they want to do this they want
[1:58:33] to do that not what you want to do was
[1:58:36] God want you to do as I said people are
[1:58:39] not living for God like they used to
[1:58:41] they're really not living for the
[1:58:42] message like they used to intellectually
[1:58:47] but not spiritually
[1:58:52] he said Lord prisoners from our own
[1:58:57] selfish ambitions from our own judgments
[1:59:00] and our better way of thinking to be a
[1:59:04] prisoner of Jesus Christ and I think
[1:59:08] that was a great statement that Paul
[1:59:10] made that I I'm a prisoner to Jesus
[1:59:14] Christ amen
[1:59:16] I pray God's grace that we are prisoners
[1:59:21] to Christ amen considering what we're
[1:59:25] seeing in the world today and were and
[1:59:27] we know the world's getting worse and
[1:59:29] worse and worse and knowing that the
[1:59:32] public god said many many years ago
[1:59:34] grace he said a certain country
[1:59:39] concerning America he said that country
[1:59:43] he said they got a they got a bomb or
[1:59:46] something like that
[1:59:47] he said with our name on it we're gonna
[1:59:50] get ready to shoot it to America and
[1:59:52] destroy America brother we're not going
[1:59:58] to escape it
[2:00:00] no definitely not we're right there
[2:00:03] north of America so we're part of
[2:00:05] America too so it's going to destroy an
[2:00:08] umbrella I tell you this
[2:00:09] o the world that influenced that plane
[2:00:12] crashed the world that's influencing
[2:00:14] that that's influenced by the the fire
[2:00:16] in Australia and other things going on
[2:00:18] in the world brother get ready because
[2:00:23] as I said I told you before that all of
[2:00:25] this going on this going on I said one
[2:00:27] day yes it's gonna be on our doorstep
[2:00:29] and it is it's getting closer and closer
[2:00:34] to our doorstep we better be a prisoner
[2:00:38] Jesus so when all these things pass and
[2:00:41] come to pass again and again and again
[2:00:44] there were gonna be set free into
[2:00:46] eternity by the grace of God again there
[2:00:53] are very few believers that are
[2:00:55] prisoners to the word prisoners to the
[2:00:57] message
[2:00:58] prisoners to the revelation of
[2:01:00] sanctification and the
[2:01:04] if you're a prisoner to that revelation
[2:01:06] you're living for a day in day out
[2:01:09] morning noon and night you're looking
[2:01:11] for the resurrection in the rapture how
[2:01:13] many times have I look Gon's and looked
[2:01:16] out the window and what the Lord what's
[2:01:21] it going to be like Lord the new heaven
[2:01:26] new earth there be none of this said
[2:01:28] Lord all this would be gone thank you
[2:01:31] Lord it's gonna be wonderful thank you
[2:01:33] Jesus know what I'm looking for it I'm
[2:01:35] calling for it Lord then new heaven and
[2:01:38] new earth brother the resurrection of
[2:01:40] rapture is going to take us into glory
[2:01:42] for a season for a time before God makes
[2:01:45] the new heaven a new earth
[2:01:47] grace as talking to those breath
[2:01:51] brethren a couple of those brothers one
[2:01:56] of those said they said do you believe
[2:02:00] in heaven yes I said I believe in him
[2:02:04] that's right it's a place that God's
[2:02:07] gonna take us well he's well he's
[2:02:10] destroyed the earth while he's bringing
[2:02:13] this to pass and that to pass he's gonna
[2:02:15] take us off but then he'll bring us back
[2:02:18] when it's all redone and it's a new
[2:02:21] heaven a new earth as a part of Gaza do
[2:02:23] throw into the Sun so that it's burned
[2:02:25] and yesterday won't be one thing left
[2:02:28] representing seen No thank God we're
[2:02:32] going into a new avenue where where we
[2:02:34] won't have nothing in our bodies
[2:02:37] representing sin we hope there be no
[2:02:39] thoughts we want when I have no thoughts
[2:02:41] have seen will be back home by the grace
[2:02:46] of God hallelujah
[2:02:48] but again I says I said and you're gonna
[2:02:51] have something to do and if God can
[2:02:53] trust you here your trust you there amen
[2:02:56] God has given you a responsibility here
[2:02:58] to see if you you can you can handle
[2:03:01] that responsibility as a son and
[2:03:03] daughter of God he's bringing out the
[2:03:05] nature of his of his sons and daughters
[2:03:07] his nature in you amen oh you're
[2:03:11] faithful here in your distance oh I can
[2:03:13] I can make you a ruler there you
[2:03:16] me and my throne praise the Lord
[2:03:24] listen just to ask you to continue to
[2:03:28] remember those associated or affected by
[2:03:32] the Australia fires they're believers in
[2:03:34] Australia grace of God - and again those
[2:03:42] affected by the plane crash and other
[2:03:45] things that are going on in the earth
[2:03:46] there's a lot more going on than what we
[2:03:48] realized so the grace of God helped us
[2:03:52] and also to ask you to remember our
[2:03:59] brother George Smith in prayer he's in
[2:04:01] Brazil I was in contact with him by
[2:04:06] email I think that either last night or
[2:04:08] night before and he was on his way on a
[2:04:11] nine-hour trip he saw him on a nine hour
[2:04:13] trip brothers head to Brazil and I told
[2:04:16] what was like here wasted thank you glad
[2:04:18] I'm not there and I knew that's why he
[2:04:22] wouldn't want to come here during the
[2:04:24] winter amen especially this winter so
[2:04:28] I'll be in contact with him to set a
[2:04:30] time for his visit with us and also I'm
[2:04:33] waiting to hear from our brother Andre
[2:04:34] ahead and there's also another brother
[2:04:37] at being central in late May and
[2:04:40] hopefully be here in early June and
[2:04:42] that's a Andrew Glover we called it
[2:04:46] Glover but they call it Glover a man so
[2:04:49] god bless them so as we as we press on
[2:04:52] but brother let's make our calling and
[2:04:55] election sure how do we do that make
[2:04:58] sure you're a prisoner to the word make
[2:05:00] sure you're a prisoner to Jesus amen
[2:05:03] you're not a prisoner to a denomination
[2:05:05] or to a church you're a prisoner to the
[2:05:07] Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord
[2:05:10] so maybe we'll get back to those
[2:05:12] scriptures again concerning Joshua and
[2:05:14] Caleb and the children of Israel a man
[2:05:17] your brother
[2:05:18] I pray you want to go read it again
[2:05:21] Ezekiel our numbers chapter 14 read it
[2:05:24] unless I play it to the hour that we're
[2:05:26] leaving
[2:05:27] they may so god bless you amen
[2:05:31] and again remember that initially the
[2:05:34] revival is over and brother what God is
[2:05:38] doing now is bringing to pass
[2:05:40] what are your deign to do through the
[2:05:43] revival and that is the resurrection and
[2:05:46] the rapture brother we're getting closer
[2:05:49] to it and if you are you're gonna be
[2:05:52] more and more conscious of it that's
[2:05:54] right
[2:05:55] Josh monkeys just sing good Josh from
[2:05:57] Caleb oh come on Joshua come on hey look
[2:05:59] let's let's be here and the wilderness
[2:06:01] is wonderful this is wonderful that's
[2:06:03] wonderful come on
[2:06:04] nobody said God brought us out to take a
[2:06:06] seat so let's go on God brought us out
[2:06:10] of denominationalism to take us into
[2:06:13] glory by His grace
[2:06:14] so leather I trust by the grace of God
[2:06:17] God could looks down any seeds the
[2:06:18] resurrection and the rapture you and he
[2:06:21] knows and he'd not anymore but now we're
[2:06:23] gonna walk we're gonna walk off the
[2:06:25] earth the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:06:27] first Lord then we which are alive
[2:06:30] remain when we caught up with them to
[2:06:33] meet the Lord in the air it's not just
[2:06:36] fairytale it's a reality brother
[2:06:39] whatever God said he was going to do he
[2:06:41] did so now concerning the resurrection
[2:06:43] rapture he's going to do it look what he
[2:06:46] did in Christ look what he's doing now
[2:06:48] grace that will believe in the finished
[2:06:51] work of Calvary and that was brother he
[2:06:54] laid down his life he picked it up again
[2:06:56] and raptured it amen
[2:06:58] so that's what he wants to do for the
[2:07:00] bride god bless us Dan
[2:07:12] they're saying I am thine O Lord I have
[2:07:16] heard thy voice and it told I love to me
