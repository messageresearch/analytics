he went from the east back to the West and now the Lord is brought him back to the east again a man for the rising of the Sun Amen brother because the Sun that we are worshipping and the Sun that has

we want to turn to our brother Jonathan and again as I said I said brother I never dreamed 38 years ago you'd be here again you know as I said but he was here before short not long ago a few months ago that when I was ministering that he would sit there on the chair he was 2 years old yeah not going to reveal his age now but he was 2 years old and I said mine this is amazing but like I said no I said I got to sit on the chair and look at him and he had to sit on here look at me a man man and and there was no he did there was no disturbance whatsoever you know he just a just looked and stayed no no no did nothing to just disrupt him a man so I trust that God gave us the same anointing then he gave him 38 years ago that he looked for it in us tonight amen then we're going to as he was a pay attention to the word paying attention to the word paying attention to the word that we're going to pay attention to the word why this is Saints faith comes by hearing and not just hearing anything is hearing the word amen so I pretend not only that but pray God that is the faith that pleases him and it's the faith again not in your head it's the faith it's in your heart a man I trust are going to hear the word in your heart they're going to receive the word in your heart amen elleny Alleluia praise the name of the Lord again don't use your ears use your ear the inner of the soul amen and as I said God got us a year the year he wants he wants your ear not your ears amen to God be the glory so what we welcome our brother we're going to turn to service to him a man so the Lord blessed us amen understand and we're gonna sing only believe all things are possible only believe amen only believe what we believe amen that's that's that's why we just think that we defeat the enemy which is written thus saith the Lord it's Lord amen you want to know all over a company the Satan's temptations are Satan's trouble quote the word give him the word Amen that's that's what God give us overcome the enemy thy word have I hid in my dark I'm not sin against thee a man it was power over all the power of the let's take it as I've really come to me a prayer [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is here [Music] [Applause] Jesus [Applause] [Music] a minute that's our confession let's just bow our heads and talk to him this evening Heavenly Father Lord we've gathered in your name Lord we've sung your praises though we've lifted up our voices and made a sacrifice and the Lord your presence is here we all know it with all we pray now that you have moved forward in the the ministering of the word Heavenly Father Lord not just in word Lord but in spirit and in power Lord Jesus that you would touch the lives and hearts of each one that's gathered in Lord some from far some from near Lord Jesus but or we believe that it will not be in vain tonight but that you can touch each heart and soul that's here Lord that you can heal the sick Lord that you can lure redeem those that are lost Lord that you can deliver those that are afflicted or just have your way with your people tonight we surrender ourselves to you and Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen if you'll open your your Bibles this morning to or this evening to first Peter it's tough coming out here because you are all warmed up and I'm not they almost need to need to put a treadmill in there so that the preacher can almost get up to speed you know what you'd almost be fooled I think you guys came for church tonight or something you know so praise the Lord for that it's nice to come out and just feel relaxed and and not under stress and just able to sit back and just let the Lord have his wonderful way men I bring greetings from my wife I know she streaming now watching but she wished she could be here but with the kids in school and birthdays and all that not really gonna happen this time but I know she's watching and really wishes she could be here so she's here as best she can be and that's online so you know it's hard to come back we had a wonderful time last time and it's hard to come back because everybody's kind of got an expectation and Aaron McGarry had a similar experience here a while back at the Cloverdale Church and they just had tremendous services and he came back and he said I don't know how we're going to this again and he was worried because the expectation is we're gonna have the exact same thing but better right and that should be our expectation but it's how the Lord will move that's what we want but he said in the end he says what are you gonna do he says keep doing what you're doing what you did last time worked so just keep doing it now right and then the Lord will move and he'll have his way and whatever is supposed to happen will happen and whether it's the shouting and the dancing and the and the praising or whether it's the quietness and and the tears and the repentance whatever it may be right he's gonna have his way this evening so turn into first Peter and we'll start at chapter 1 verse 5 first Peter 1 verse 5 it says who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time this is the last time we're in you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be we are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth don't be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen you can have your seats this evening I want to sort of set a bit of a foundation and teach a little bit before we move into the rest of the service but as I was just praying on this the thought came to me and kind of what kept coming over and over was this idea of pure gold and so for a topic tonight for a title I want to call it more precious than gold amen and gold was everything back when the scripture was written if you had gold then your life was set gold was money gold was your access to to wealth and fame and all the pleasures of life and food and the necessities of life as well and when Peter starts talking about something that's more precious than gold he's saying this is more precious than anything you can get in this world this is more precious than anything that can be used to get anything in this world he's saying this is the lottery if you will for the believer these these trials of your faith are more precious than any of those things and I actually looked into how much gold they bring in and Solomon would get about 1.6 billion dollars in gold 25 tons a year was what Solomon had and it was so yet so much he had an ivory throne and he overlaid it completely with gold he had golden cups he had golden plates everything he had was covered in gold you know and Solomon was a you know he was a type of the of the millennium and these different things and whatnot and it was defined by his wealth but then Peter comes along and he says this is worth more than everything that Solomon had this is more valuable than all the gold that you can have and all the Ferraris and big houses and all these different things you could get he says this is worth more than all of those things put together you take everything in the world he says this what you have is more precious than anything else that you could ever get in this world amen so let's start again but let's start at verse 3 this time I like to keep the opening scripture short and we'll start to dig into it a little bit but again just trying to set a foundation here so if you'll bear with me for 15 or 20 minutes well this won't be new to you but then we'll maybe move into some things that are a little different so first Peter 1 verse 3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us on to a lively hope that's a Living Hope and at the amplify says it's a hope that doesn't fade away or in he says by what by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and what is this hope he says it's an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you so this is not something that could be bought with gold because gold perish it than anything that is bought with gold can perish but he says this hope that you have is incorruptible and undefiled and he says what who are kept what the ones that are called now to this inheritance he says they are kept by what the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time so again we're in the last times now so this is specifically an endtime message if you will an endtime scripture for us is that there's a particular purity of this gold that's going to be at the end time amen he says now in here wherein ye greatly rejoice so you rejoice in the incorruptible and her inheritance though now for a season so he says your rejoicing and what's coming you rejoice and what's given to you but he says though if now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations so he says for now you're gonna have to go through tough times but your your join in this year your rejoicing in this because you know coming because of what's happening to you amen so he's saying you're looking to what's there but you're gonna not have a great time in the meantime you know so he says what you're in heaviness to manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth don't be tried with fires so the purest gold is the gold that's tried in the fire it's the gold that's beaten over and over and over again and we're very familiar where it talks about they what they beat the gold until they can see their reflection in it so the gold that has passed through fire that is tried with fire is the purest gold and it is the only gold that will show a pure reflection of the one that's beating it amen so he says what the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perishes might be found to three - these three things the praise the honor and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so he says this is all going to be for the praise and honor of glory when Christ is revealed now people look at that scripture oft times and they think well that's going to be when we go in a rapture right when Christ is revealed but we know that in a bride there is a revealing of Christ that happens right here and that's what he's talking about this is a compound scripture where he says yes it's going to be a wonderful thing when you see him when you go up in the air but it's an even more wonderful thing when you see him down here because you don't need to be beaten when you're going up there it's down here that things have to be refined amen so he's saying there's gonna be praise and honor and glory in these trials right here right now you don't have to wait till then to rejoice over what's happening amen there's something that's going on here that's worthy of lifting up and glorifying God amen so when we hear that phrase more precious than gold most of us would pick up our our ears a little bit you know and then we hear it's the trial of our faith and then we kind of just deflate a little bit because we're all lifted up oh yeah more precious than gold give me that and then trial of your faith uh-huh you know and then and then a visiting minister comes and says let's preach on the trial of your faith and everyone kind of drops a little bit as well right right there's lots of blood in the seats already why is he doing this right brother Gerald anyways what my hope is to lift us up above the idea of just the struggles and the trials and get down into what's happening when that happens and really see not we and the purpose in our head we all understand the purpose in her head but I guarantee nobody is in here saying Lord give me more trials nobody say nah I understand how value but they are Lord can you give me a trial today anybody asks for a trial lately not directly but what do we do we say Lord give me more peace give me more patience give me more love give me more grace and what does he do he sends you a trial to show you that either you have it or he gives you a trial so that you'll live up to what you need and he'll build it up in you and he'll keep putting that one in front of you until you pass it right so we don't ask for the trials but we ask for God we ask for more of him in our lives and what does he do he gives us a trial and he gives us a temptation so that what we can we can actually manifest it or else we can go and we fall down and we trip up and then we say Lord I don't have what I need can you fill me up with that and then he says well I need room I need room to put it in you're all full up so what are you gonna let me take away right and then it's a cycle that goes over and over and over again so like I said I'm hoping we'll approach trials a little bit more differently and when you're in them you'll approach them differently and you'll be looking for a different thing rather than just to get out of them because as humans were we're all about pain relief right we don't want to go through something that's uncomfortable for any longer than we have to so off times when we're going through trials we're just about can we just get to the end here and really it's what's in the middle that's most valuable to us we're looking for the victory but it's what's happening between the promise and the result and you know when the fulfilling of that promise or the battle and the victory this is where all of our growth happens is in the middle amen so we we know there's a very familiar scripture in revelation 3 that says you know that he's talking about the Laodicean Church age and he says you need gold tried in the fire now we're not in the Laodicean Church age the bride can't be in the Laodicean Church age if you look in there it says he's what he's standing outside the church knocking and whosoever opens with him he'll come in and sup so we know that that cannot be the bride the bride is not in that Laodicean Church age because she's the one that opens the door amen so when he's saying this gold tried in the fire that is what happens to those that hear the angel messenger right you have to listen to the Holy Spirit that speaks to that angel messenger and says this is how you overcome in this age and the first thing he jumps on is he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may us be rich so the one that has the most gold tried in the fire is rich but if we heard that the trial of your faith is more precious than gold then it stands too stands to reason that the one that has the most trials is the richest amongst us right because God's trying to do more now maybe you have more because you're not listening and you're not growing so maybe you're not the risk yours always but brother Branham jumps right on this and he says there is a gold of God and he takes us back to first Peter that we just read he says the gold of God is a christ-like character and the whole church blows up and says amen praise the Lord and then he says produced in the fiery furnace of affliction and everybody lowers their hand right he says this is not something that happens easily we think we can kind of just pray about it and then God gives it to us but he says no no it is through trials and temptations afflictions difficulties it's not only to give it to you but it's to prove that it's there and so that you'll grab an experience with God in the manifestation of God in your life that can never be challenged by somebody because there's always going to be somebody that's smarter than you there's always going to be somebody that can tie you in circles with the scripture and with the message and all these different things but when you have an experience with God that has stood the test of time over and over and over again somebody who come to tell you this isn't real and you're saying it's too late it's already real in me right and so now they're they're trying to fight your testimony as opposed to your intellectual knowledge amen you man you can't have one without the other he says the gold of God is a christ-like character he says but it has to be produced in the fiery furnace of affliction the brand said this in the in the the Smyrna and church age he says why does he stand by speaking of when you know things are going bad he says why does he stand by he said their reason is in Romans 8 he says and if we are children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we also may be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us then he says unless we suffer with we cannot reign with him you have to suffer terrain the reason for that is that character simply is never made without suffering right and you'll find that it if you you ever meet a child from a wealthy home that's been given everything that they they want they never have character because they have everything but they didn't go through anything they didn't earn it there they don't have any blood sweat and tears they have no investment in it they just have it so he says you can't have this without suffering because why character is a victory not a gift and then a very familiar familiar quote he says a man without character count rain because power apart from character is satanic but power with characters fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him he says that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir he says and we all have trials so this this we don't suffer for no reason right God doesn't sometimes we sit think that God's up there just letting things happen for for any reason the the for a believer the suffering and the trials that we face are always for a purpose now if you're sinning then you reap what you sow when you're you're really going through trials and temptations and these things unnecessarily right because the word has to happen so what a man souls that's what he reaps so if you're out there doing things you shouldn't be doing you're not suffering righteously you're suffering because of your decisions but if you are doing righteously if you are seeking God if your heart is committed to God if you have the Holy Spirit then your sufferings are always therefore from God and he has a purpose and a reason behind it so if things are going difficult it's because God is trying to do something in your life for the true believer and only the true believer can say that right because that's the only one that he said he says if you're if you're not going through corrections in these different things he says then you're bastards right now you have no lineage to me there's no relationship there you're just somebody that's out out there you have no no connection to me right but what is it it's - it's to bring us to spiritual maturity right so often we're looking at these and we think well it's about how good I act but it's never been about how you act and we'll get into that maybe a little more tomorrow Lord willing but it's about what bringing you to a place where you have the character of Christ it's not about a spotless sinless walk that's why we have the atonement right that's all we have the the cross of Calvary in the shed blood is to cover that you'll never have a sinless spotless life in and of your life here on earth and the actions that you do you're not going to have it and if you're looking for it you're gonna be doomed to failure and disappointment the rest of your life amen brother brother Brown continues this in the church age book he says as job said he put strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered he says Hebrews 5:8 2:9 he says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto them that obey Him he says in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him will come to a place of perfection he says why did he want this James 1:2 2:4 says my brother encounted all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her partial work in complete work he says her perfect work patience have her perfect work what patience as you're going through the trials that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so the trial of your faith is what brings you to be a part of the bride that is perfect and entire wanting nothing this is a complete bride this is a bride that is final she's done she's complete he says this is only through the trial of your faith they meant so he's talking about what the character of Christ and so often when we start talking about character we think of good morals and standing up for what you believe in these different things but you can look around the world and see a ton of people even people that aren't Christians that live a life of good moral character that have good values right that stand up their charitable they aren't mean to people these different things and brother Brahim even said some of them will put true believers to shame right so that is not just the character that that has to be there and we'll cover that a little bit here speaking of Jesus Christ brother Bram said this he says let's watch the type of person he was let's look at his character and watch his ministry as he worked then he works now and as he was then he is now and will be forever so he says look at how it worked with him it'll work the same thing in you and the effects that it had in him will be the same effects it has in you he says just what he did in them days he'll do it today he'll be just the same forever he's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever the same type of character a man that professes to be a Christian must have a christ-like nature if it isn't there's another nature there he says an it isn't christ-like gay men so character for a Christian means to have a christ-like nature not just good morals and good beliefs and standing up for things and having integrity and whatnot it means that we have to be more than just people with good attitudes and nice character it's to have a christ-like character which is a whole different you know kettle of fish than just being a good person Amen brother branham takes us to a way higher level than that when he talks about this christ-like nature and listen to this quote as he kind of sets a the thing of this because he starts to take it beyond just your actions now he starts to take it back to your nature he takes it back to how you think and how you approach situations and your attitude because sometimes we're so stuck on did I do the right thing and he's looking beyond it to say did you think the right thing what was your first inclination had a couple situations in the last few weeks where I didn't like my inclination my actions were perfect if I could put it that way I did the right thing but in the back of my mind things were gonna hurt right let's be honest right sometimes we pat ourselves on the back because we did the right thing and we're sitting there stewing inside and we really crucified the person even though we treated him right in our head we beat him up didn't we and brother branham takes us back to this and he says this is what we're looking for now is in the nature it's a nature change that happens when you get the Holy Ghost and with that now Dan the rest of it comes out the christ-like character him he says we've got to take the entire full gospel we must and now being that we have identified ourselves as full gospel people let's mold our character he says were invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect what his presence reflect his presence so you've got to have what his presence there - what reflecting you and bring out what Christ would do in that situation right you've got you're looking for the baptism of the Holy Spirit in your life not just a one-time event to say you're sealed to the day of your Redemption but this is a day by day by day what reflection of him right there as you think so you will act and he's wanting to bring that whole mindset of Christ there right so he says in the works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you he says were invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his he says what a thing my and then when we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of Christ so we've gone from the trial of your faith be more precious than gold to having character to having a christ-like nature which is character and now he's taking that all the way down and saying well that's the mind of Christ he says by having the mind of Christ he says mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind Paul said of Christ that mind that was in Christ being you let that mind of Christ be in you it molds the character of a son of God so now we're going from you look good on the outside to going all the way down to the deepest depths of your soul to where the very intentions and purpose of God are now flowing back out through you and that's what's driving your life so if that's what our trial is them what is the trial the trial is - what have the mind of Christ and submit yourself to it so that the whole chain from there is Christ from the inside out amen not just the right actions because so often like I said we pat ourselves on the back because we did the right thing but our attitude internally was completely wrong amen how does that look well if he said that what Christ did is what we should do then we should be able to go and find that example with Christ and I won't have you turn to it just for the same of time this evening but it's when he's in the garden of gethsemane Matthew 26 verse 38 it says then saith he unto them to his disciples my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death Terry you here and watch this so Jesus has already been through all of these things he's now there he knows his time is coming up and he's already worn out he's already tired he's you know his Bloods pumping and all this he knows something bad is coming his way and he knows it's gonna be tough he knows I mean this is this is God in flesh he knows what's coming right he says and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou will so he's saying I don't want to do this my Christ is saying I don't want to do this I don't want to go to the whipping post I don't want to be punched they don't want to be spit on I don't want to have the thorns driven into me I definitely don't want to be crucified and I'd really not die if it's okay with you right this is not a fun three days he's gonna have in front of him and he's saying can you take it away there's nothing wrong with asking God to take things away but watch what Jesus does he says any when a game away again the second time verse 42 and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away for me except I drink it thy will be done so he goes from saying can I please not go through this - what he says I'll drink it you haven't told me I can't get it you know I can't get away with this so I've got to do it so he says okay I'll drink it so he goes now from asking do I not have to go through it to say I'm willing there's no grudging this here right he knows it's gonna be tough but he says what if that's your will then I'll do it and he's not fighting it anymore it says and he left them verse 44 and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same word so he goes back and he says father I'm willing to drink the cup I'll drink the cup right so he goes in there and then he comes to his disciples and says unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hours at hand the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners so he goes all the way from saying I don't want to do it - willful and ungrudgingly insan' he steps right into the perfect will of God right that's the mind of Christ when you see it in front of you you're allowed to say can we do this a different way but there's gonna be some time where he says sorry because why it's his chosen way to bring out his character in you it's his chosen way to manifest Christ in you so if you keep asking to not go through it then what are you gonna have you're gonna have a stunted growth you're gonna be a weak Christian because you've got nothing of him in you he doesn't just drop it in like this it's the way he channels things is through the molding of temptation and trials amen so therefore what is the character of mind of Christ if that's what ours is supposed to be if we're supposed to have the mind of Christ it's to do what is to seek the will and purpose of God in every situation no matter how hard it is no matter how difficult it is no matter what we have to give up no matter who we're going to offend what is it Lord what is your will and if that's your will I'll drink the cup each and every time amen the Bram says this and the message identification he says we want to make this Bible our looking-glass and let ourselves be molded by his character having his character his mind letting the mind that was in Christ being us what was his mind to do the mind that was in Christ he says always to stay with the father's word I meant so we've been given a word and you're not gonna cross this you can never cross this and say you're in the will of God you can't do it there's no exceptions there's no you know it's not like the Catholic Church where they give you an indulgence God doesn't give indulgences right there was a time to wink at ignorance this is not that time amen so if it's in here then that's the will of God and you can't go around it but not all of us have to go through certain things not all of us have to go through maybe a particular marriage problem or a health problem or an employment problem or all these things we look around and you have friends that are and families in the churches and ones going through this and the other ones going through that it's up to God to choose those things and bring you into those those areas of your life that he feels need refining but we don't all go through it but if it's here you don't get to go around it if he calls you to walk through it right you don't get to go against this to excuse yourself from the will and plan of God amen amen so it brings us now to what the character of the character that we're supposed to have is the mind of Christ which is always to see the will and purpose of God and it's going to happen through trials okay so we've set that foundation but then we've got to step in to the other side of it which is again two very familiar scriptures Psalms 37 23 says the steps of a good man now that doesn't mean man that means person so the sisters are included in this the steps of a good sister a woman are allowed as well steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way now doesn't say the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he understands everything that's going on or that he knows that it's the will of God and that he's got a revelation that it's the will of God no no it just says they're ordered of the Lord doesn't say you're going to understand it every time sometimes we think that God owes us an explanation so it's got joven the trouble wasn't it job thought that he was owed an explanation and he didn't get it until what he humbled himself before God amen and then again Romans 8:28 we can quote this by by rote it says and we know that all things work together for good all things for who to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose so the footsteps of a righteous person or order of the Lord and all things are for our good if you are a child of God then what are we worried about right why are we sitting here saying why is this happening to me why am I having to go through this and why are we fighting this for so long and why am I going through this trial and why are things so difficult in this area in that area who cares but that's something that's easy to say up here right that's easy for the preacher to say it in a service and it's easy for us to say Amen in the service but when Monday hits and you're having to go through it again it's not so easy to say who cares right because you're in the thick of it you're in the thick of it and you're fighting and your flesh is fighting in these different things right so you've got to go through these things and the mindset now has to be in you the mind of Christ where you're seeking Lord not just get me out of this but what are you trying to get me to learn here what are you trying to put into me and we start seeking the purpose of God in the trial as opposed to the relief of God in the trial and then there's a song that says sometimes he calms a storm and other time he caught other times he calms his child so often we're looking for him to calm the storm but what's a greater miracle that he comes a storm or that he lets you go through the storm without fear in your heart right where that you can go through the storm and have rest and be completely satisfied that God does all things well amen like I said sometimes the trials are to show you what you don't have and sometimes the trials are to show you what you do have I remember when I first moved to Edmonton I've been in a bad car wreck and oh-6 and I hadn't worked out for quite some time so we paid a bunch of money to a trainer to kind of get me built back up again and make sure I didn't hurt myself and trainers push you hard that's what they're paid to do their trade to put there they're paid to push you harder than you would ever push yourself and he put weights down sometimes and I would think there's no way I can do that and sometimes I couldn't do it but I found as I trained more and more and more the trainer knew more than I did how much I was capable of pushing or pressing and he put weight down and I'd say I couldn't do it I didn't think I could do it once and I'd do it seven times why because he had seen the growth of me he had seen the strength going up in me but because I'm looking in the mirror every day I don't see it the way that he does right but he knows he should be at this level if he's been working out with me for three months he should be up 30% 40% so let's put 40% more on the bar and see what he does and all of a sudden the bar moves that's what God is doing sometimes is you don't realize what he's been doing all this time and then all of a sudden he puts a big weight in front of you and you kind of just go and it moves out of your way why because he's put you through something you've got the strength you've got the faith you have the character now and you cruise right through that trial as if it was nothing and that just means you're ready for the next one right yeah all right this is not going to be an encouraging sermon tonight but that's what it is is sometimes you need the trainer there to put a pad something in your path and you couldn't beat before and then you go right through it because God's been doing a work in your life sometimes I think that's one of the greatest values of having good friends and good fellowship is that people will let you know when they see a change in you because they'll see it because they're not looking at you every day they'll see it over weeks or you go see somebody after your year they say my how you've changed right what is it they can give you that feedback they can say you're growing you don't realize it but look at where you wet look at the way you talk look at the way you act remember you used to talk to me about this all the time and now you don't what happen I don't know sometimes we're looking for this and it's gone and God will take it away over six months and you don't even realize you've lost it until it comes across your path and you're like I don't even want to do that anymore I don't even like that anymore somebody comes across that used to just drive you nuts and you've all of a sudden got grace for them where'd that come from most times it's not a moment right it's over time he's building you up right he's shaping you he's molding you you always talk about the the sculptors and these different things they don't just you know but it done it's slow and easy right sometimes there's big chunks and then as they get down there's more refining and whatnot amen we've set the foundation we're gonna take two different two different people or groups here to kind of build this into us a little bit so turn the first Samuel Chapter one if you would for Samuel Chapter one we're gonna talk about Hannah for a little bit because when we look at at these trials of our faith so often again we're looking at the end result the character of Christ and these different things but we actually end up missing what's going on in the middle there and Hannah's a great example of kind of the the impact that it has on your relationship with God as you're going through these things so First Samuel Chapter one let me know when you're there okay we're good First Samuel Chapter one says now there was a certain man of a place I can't pronounce mount ephraim and his name was al cana the son of jerome the son of allah who the son of Tohu the son is if an F recite and he had two wives in the name of one was Hanna in the name of the other was pnina and pnina had children but hannah had no children and this man went out of his City yearly to worship so they went to special services every year you could say two and two sacrificed unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were there and when the time was that al cana offered he gave to pnina his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion he gave a greater portion to her for he loved hannah but listen to this but the lord had shut up her womb so hannah is the favored wife so for the sake of the children here a favorite wife is going to see her husband more gonna spend more time with her husband the chances of a pregnancy are much higher with a favored wife and yet she's not producing any children and then we see that the Lord had shut up her womb what had Hannah done why is her womb shut up had Hannah sinned was there something in her background that was keeping her from this was the Lord withholding a promise because it was a promise to Abram seed right he said he'd make a great nation and he said what the proof of that was in the the ones the wombs of the women producing so many children that was a huge blessing and it was a sign of spiritual favor in those days of God's blessing was to have children if you didn't have children there was a reproach and Hannah has done nothing and yet she's under reproach she doesn't deserve this right there's nothing here that would suggest that Hannah was in any way wrong and yet the Lord it says the Lord had shut up her womb amen and then we see the next scripture there in verse 6 it says and her adversary her wife or her the other wife also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb amen isn't that just like Satan to make you fret when you're not exhibiting what somebody else in the congregation has all whether it's a gift right whether it's a certain personality trait whether it's a character trait what is it you look at them and say why don't I have that we do it right we get jealous and then you get one that's maybe needs a little growth in that area maybe they they rub it in your face a little bit siblings are great at this right siblings you ever have a sibling that just rubs your face into something that they have all right amen Paul it's true though isn't it sometimes the ones closest to you are the ones that cause you to fret the most amen well what is it that is not the Holy Ghost doing that I can tell you that for sure it's the oppressor says her adversary is the one that caused her to Fredi men there was work that had to happen on both their sides but what's she trying to do she's trying to get her off the idea that there is a promise for what children to a seed of Abraham and so year after year as she went up to the house of the Lord you provoked her so every time there's special meetings the other wife is poking at her so every time the visiting minister comes in they're poking at her ah you still don't have the promise you still don't have the promise you still don't have the promise you still don't have children yeah he loves you but I'm the one that's blessed God favors me every time she goes to church special services the devil's poking her amen it says and therefore she wept and did not eat so it's physically taking a toll on Hanna and this is year after year after year in a time when she should have been the most spiritually blessed there should have been joy we're going to the house of the Lord we're sacrificing everything's gonna be under the blood this is when they should be rejoicing and all hannah has his reproach there's a stigma over her life and she doesn't understand Church is a time of bitterness for Hannah can you imagine every year special services and you don't look forward to it because that's the worst time of the year rather than the best time of the year that's how bad it was and then Elkanah her husband typical man says Hannah why weepest thou and why eat us now not and why is thy heart grieved am I not better to thee than 10 sons right I'm a good husband why are you looking for other boys I'm the man you know I should be enough for you right and that's not enough cuz Hannah's looking at what she says no the fruit of our relationship is a child we need to have a child this is a proof of our relationship and it's a proof of God's blessing in her side of things amen so verse 9 Hannah rose up after they'd eaten and Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli the priest set upon a seat by the post of the temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept wept sore Hannah's not in a good place here and it's of no it's it's of no fault of hers but she's in bitterness why because she's looking at this she's saying I want I want I want what God has offered what God has promised that's for me and I'm sick and tired of him not giving me what he promised he would give me right again she'd done nothing to deserve this but watch what happens it says and she vowed a vow and said O Lord of Hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and forget not thine handmaid but we'll give unto thine handmaid a man-child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head so hand is in this trial and all of a sudden what does she do she's praying more and more and more and more and what happens is she taps into God's purpose for this whole thing and this may have been decades we don't know how old Hannah was brother Graham says she was maybe 40 50 60 okay but guessing she married maybe around 20 ish or so that's at least 20 years of barrenness 30 years of barrenness 40 years of bareness and all of the sudden she says the right thing because what God needs a prophet on the scene the ministry has been tainted right Eli's not keeping his sons in there they're sleeping with women in the in the in the tabernacle they're taking more than they were promised right they don't want the the flesh has dipped in the water they wanted it baked and all these things they were completely transgressing the law of God and that the ministry was filthy and he needed to clean it out he had to do a clean sweep and he said I'm gonna bring in a prophet but he wanted a willing vessel to do it because nobody's just going to give their child away because Samuel now has to go through a process to see what that ministry is like and then God's gonna call him and move him forward amen but he's looking for someone that will give him a child and so after 20 30 40 years Hannah finally says the right thing but it's taken her years and years and years of prayer and she's developed a prayer life and in that bitterness now she says the right thing and says look just take away my reproach and I'll give it back to you the blessing that takes away my reproach will be given right back to God completely right moving on to the next scripture but the bram says this before we do that Hannah does what she says God I'm gonna give it back to you I'm gonna give the blessing back to you I'm gonna give the glory back to you I'm gonna lose my reproach but everything else that you give me I'm just gonna give it right back to you right so she's surrendering now insane I need something out of this but everything else it's yours right brother Bram said this and victory day said and each one of us is born for something we weren't just put here for nothing everything is for his purpose it's got to serve and we are here for a purpose in Hannah what she found her that was to bring forth a profit that was all that Hanna was put on the earth to do was to bring forth a profit and as soon as she found that everything starts to move into into its place verse 12 it says and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart you know the scripture talks about the Spirit is within us giving it with groanings that cannot be uttered I believe that's the place that Hannah came to well she was so burdened in her spirit she couldn't even talk about it out loud anymore but it was just coming out of her and it says her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken right this is so affected her now she can't even talk about it but she's just sitting there and it's just it's just inside of her she can't even express it and he'll I said to her how long wilt thou be drunken drunken put away thy wine from thee and Hannah answered and said no my lord but I'm a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord so Hannah's come to a place where she is so dedicated to this this purpose to this need she says I'm not doing anything except coming to the Lord I'm fully committed to getting him to answer my prayer a many and she says so count out that handmaid for a daughter Belial she says don't think I'm one of those loose women that your sons are sleeping with it was a rebuke to Eli almost you know I know what's going on in here but don't think I'm one of them I'm not one of them she says for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto daniil I answered and said go in peace and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou has asked of him Eli doesn't know what she asked but he says God give it to you right he's rebuked and he says no God God give it to you she said and so she said let thine hand meant by grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad amen she's found the mind of God let's read verse 19 before we continue and they rose up in the early morning and worship before the Lord and returned and came to their house to Rama and elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her but look at Hannah's change in verse 18 it says she went her way she ate and she was no more sad what is it she'd gotten the promise that she was going to be blessed she took that minister that priest at his word when he said the Lord looked kindly upon thee and she says that's it I'm taking what he said that's for me amen for the RAM said this in the resurrection of Lazarus nineteen fifty said she went up with something in her heart she wanted to talk to God and she prayed in such deep sincerity till the priest misunderstood her like today sometimes were called finatus because we pray and cry out to God people don't understand what it is when we're in a service and our hands are up and we're shouting or our heads down and we're crying out to God they don't understand what that is but what is the Holy Spirit in us trying to draw out something that God has planned for us amen he says we're not fanatics were misunderstood that's all he thought she was drunk listen to what he says they did the same thing on Pentecost they do the same today when the Holy Spirit is moving when the Spirit of God is moving on the people people think you're crazy right you don't act normal under the influence of the Spirit he says he takes it back to Pentecost he ties what she did there to the new birth he says she said she was not drunk but she was praying God to take away her reproach he blessed her and as soon as she received the blessing from the priest he said notice she didn't wait now God could have put the baby in her arms right then but she went home happy knowing that in due season God would bring it to pass amen so she's there and she takes that promise and she says it's as good as mine it's like brother Brown talked about you know when you could buy bread for a quarter whatever he says if I've got court the quarter I can praise God for the bread because I know I've got what's required to get the bread so as long as there's bread in the store I'm gonna have bread tonight amen he says that's the kind of people we need today taking God at His Word all she did was say man she took what the minister said and said that's for me I've got the blessing I'm gonna have a baby and she praised God before she ever had the blessing and then but what he says she understood that in due season God would bring it to pass so there's a time and there's a season for every single thing that's going to happen in our life and you can say all day long the promises in the word the promises in the word the promises in the word but it's up to God to decide when that promise is going to be fulfilled in your life and everything in your life whether it's in your marriage in your job in your church ministries all of these things it is in God's time in God's time alone and you've got to be able to rest and say he does all things well they men and then talks about embracing it that's what Sarah Abraham answered it says they embraced the promise they held on to it that was their comfort was that promise even after 24 years before the he came and visited them individually amen Hannah's brother Branham says faith cometh by hearing you said Hammond said looky here if Sarah be nearly a hundred could receive seed he says Hannah was probably around oh maybe 40 50 60 somewhere along in there she said so can I so if you can look in the scripture and find the same situation for somebody else there's no reason you can't go in there and say that's for me as well that's what he's saying here don't just look at it about having children we don't seem to have a problem with children in this church but maybe there's something else that's that were we feel is missing or lacking and we're saying but the promise is there for this he says don't worry about that if somebody else got it you'll get it too and maybe it takes 25 years and maybe it takes 25 seconds but it's up to God to determine those two things right he says so faith cometh by hearing then he or she goes to the temple she's going up there to worship God she didn't pay any attention to what anyone else said some of them was going along talking about this that or the other she said she went for one alternative that was to get her prayer answered if that's the way you're here tonight you're going right back with the same kind of blessing that Hannah's had with thus saith the Lord Eli didn't say thus saith the Lord the minister spoke and she took it and said that's good enough for me that was thus saith the Lord was she felt that that minister was anointed that he had spoken from the Lord she said that's mine that's it's that simple that's mine and she went home and she was happy and joyful without having received the blessing yet but she praised as if she had already done it but we see what happens in Hannah's life the next chapter Samuel 1st Samuel chapter 2 it says because remember she gives him away she gives away her blessing now most of us would be heartbroken at that and she'd only get to see him once a year and she brings him a new coat every time right so after a few years she has no blessed but look at Hannah's response now so look at the change that this trial is brought through her for maybe twenty thirty forty years of bitterness look what it's brought in Hanna and first time into verse 2 it says and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoices in the Lord mine horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies she's speaking of that adversarial other wife she says I she can't shut me down now I can talk about the blessings of Lord and she can't shut me down because I have what he promised now they can't drown me out anymore I can testify of what he's done Amen why she says because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the Lord there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our God amen she's had an experience in this trial and she doesn't nothing matters anymore she's just sitting there and she's just praising God over and over after twenty thirty forty years of bitterness Hannah is praising she's lost her son she's giving him back to the Lord and she's sitting there and she can't stop praising she says talk no more and exceedingly proudly let not Erickson see come out of your mouth she's not just talking to that lady heard that other wife right she's saying don't tell god what to do you hold on to the promise and let him bring it to pass and his time in his way see sometimes our arrogance is not that we're claiming the promise poorly it's that we're saying Lord here's the promise and here's how you have to do it right I want this in my life I want this in the church I want this in my marriage and we're sitting there we're telling him what to do and how to do it that's not up to us to do we say here's the promise I believe and then how he brings it is up to him that's what she's saying let not arrogance II come out of your mouth I'm not gonna tell him and you can't tell him either right and you can put me down because he hasn't given it that's what she's saying right trust him to meet your need and I don't care what you say about me now cuz he's already met it he says for the Lord she said for the Lord is a God of knowledge and by him all actions are weighed the boughs of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength all of a sudden those that were you know the other the other wife was talking so much in that and she says hey you've got nothing now you got nothing on me I'm the favored wife and I have the child what are you gonna come against me with and we'll see that she gets blessed even more beyond the and they that stumbled are girded with strength I didn't have anything and now I have more I have more than enough to meet the need a men and they that were full have hired themselves out for bread the ones that had all the money now they could have to work just to eat and they that were hungry ceased so that the Baron had borne seven and she that had many children as wax feeble the Lord killeth and maketh alive he bring it down to the grave and he bringeth up the Lord and he raiseth up the poor or Lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bring it low and lifteth up she says up and down in or out east or west doesn't matter it's all the Lord no matter the situation no matter what's going on in my life it's all the Lord he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for The Pillars of the Earth are the lords and he has set the world upon them he will keep the feet of his Saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail now let me look at that two ways you have this you will not prevail by your strength you are not going to have the the character of Christ by your strength but no other person is going to succeed against you with their strength either amen when the Lord is on your side no one can touch you Amen except the Lord allow it Amen for by strength shall no man prevail Amen God's gonna bring the change in the victory the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the Horn of the anointed of his anointed look at the difference between I can't stand going to church I can't stand special services I can't stand the family I mean I can't stand the circumstances I'm in - everything is in the Lord's hands whatever he does is good he lifts up he raises down he blesses he doesn't bless it's all him and if you lift yourself up because you have everything he's going to bring you down and if you have nothing he's more than capable of bringing you up and having more than anybody else does amen what is it God has it in control she's completely overwhelmed by the by the answer to her prayer and that's all she wanted and hannah's now set for life you see this revelation here that's something that the gates of hell can never prevail against she's worshiping and she's praising God even though she's lost that blessing and had to give it away but now we look at verse 19 speaking of Samuel says moreover his mother made him a little code and brought it to him from year to year when she came up up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice an Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said the Lord give the seed of this woman for the loan which is set Lent to the Lord and they went into their own home and the Lord visited Hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters so god holds back all this time and then he drops five on her when she's an old woman not sure if that's a blessing or not but things were different back then that's for sure right so she gives the blessing back to God her approach is taken away and then he gives her five more children on top of that I've always wondered because she said earlier if you know she said they were so that the barren had born seven she bore six sometimes wonder if handed it Hannah didn't look at herself and say that was the other birth you know that was the change was her that the Lord had renewed and brought life to something else you know that it brought something that was barren that was lifeless and brought it back to its full its full health you know so what do we get out of this with Hannah for look at this remember we're talking about the mind of Christ the character of Christ what do we see in this with Hannah one it changed her approach to God after this Hannah doesn't look at that and say I don't have this and I don't have that and I'm Way away when I went the bitterness is gone now because she hasn't understanding that God does all things well so her approach now is no longer why don't I have it it's Lord what is your will in your way and then whatever you would do I'm happy with it I'm satisfied with it right so she's now looking not only for her own benefit but she's looking for the kingdom purpose in her life amen gave her a revelation of what the sovereignty of God like she said he raises up some he brings others down he blesses one this way he blesses the other one that way it's all in God's hands and she gets a revelation that hey if he decides that this is the way it's supposed to be for my life then I'm okay with that amen the third thing is it taught her to praise God Anna had a bitter hurt right she gotten sick and tired of being sick and tired and she was bitter and bitter and bitter but it drove her to her knees and in that she learned how to praise God even before the promise came and then once it came and things changed and maybe weren't quite as as the way she might have envisioned it yet she continued to praise and God blesses her and she gets five children after that amen sometimes we're waiting for the promise to manifest to start to praise and if you're sitting here and you're looking for something and you don't have it yet you can praise because the promise has been given if you can take it back to the word and say I have a promise for this then you can start praising him today because it's only a matter of time we look at it you know we're creatures of time but God's not a creature of time he's a creature of attorney so when he says it in his eyes it's done but we're sitting in that little that little pimple on the circle of time and we've got to wait and that's our struggle is that waiting time but in God's eyes it's done so you might as well if it's a finished work if it's in his word and he said he's gonna do it praise him now right that's the quarter that's the quarter and you just have to wait for the bread to come to the door right and you're gonna have money to pay for it when it comes a man it's that time in between the promise given and the promise received right he was just waiting for Hannah to say or do the right thing sometimes he's he's conditional that way he's got something he's waiting on us to say or do and then he'll give us the blessing and sometimes it's Lord I'll give it back to you sometimes you know so often brother Branham talked about different things whether it's singing or ministry and but also making money in these things he says what if God makes a man wealthy and he's got the Holy Ghost it's not so that the man can go out and have a well you know a fabulous life it's for a kingdom purpose right so if God's giving you a gift to sing and it's a wonderful thing in this church we've got people that will come up and sing constantly why because it's a sacrifice back to God right and then the different things whether it's a song writing the ministry all these different things you have all these gifts and God's just looking for you to what find the kingdom purpose for it and then all of a sudden you find that the carnal reflection of that starts to grow as well it can't it can't help with that right because God's blessing your life you're giving him that tithe you're giving him that commitment from you and he says I'll bless the whole thing now but when we hold it tight and we're trying to just right in the way we want he says no that's not gonna work and then he just pulls it away off times you know and then we all talk about these mountaintop experiences and we all want to be on the mountaintop but you can't survive on the mountain if you haven't walked up if you try going up they can apparently they can get to the top of of Everest now but if you get dropped off up there you can't survive you have to work your way up bit by bit to that mountain there are some that can go up there even without an oxygen tank you know the Sherpas and whatnot but if you don't do that three or four-month acclimation process you'll die on top of that you can't even sit up that's how weak you are from oxygen deprivation your body has to be developed as it's going up there and gods the same way he's building you up through these trials so that you get up there you can survive up there and then he takes you down or he just continues on to the next peak you know but we don't the growth is always happening in that climb you start in the valley and you're going up that's where the growth is and then he'll let you rest for a bit and then he says let's go a little bit higher right line upon line precept upon precept amen you don't find a single person in the scripture that is anointed by God that doesn't have to go through this process there's not a single one and the more he's called you for the more he's gonna put you through and guess what we're all going in a rapture so get used to it get used to it because you are the elite of the elite you are the best of the best not because of what you do but because he has said you are the best of the best you are my elect bride you are the spotless bride right you are the called according to his purpose so this is the best of the best but he says we're gonna be doing some building here you know it talks about it except it'd be a quick short work and I think sometimes that's the way it's going to happen as things are gonna start tumbling very very quickly and if you look at what's going on in the world around its crumbling very very quickly right the protections that we've enjoyed as believers they're falling away fast the laws are on the books we were talking about it today the laws are on the books that could shut this down this church down today they'd have no problem doing it under under current laws right what there's going to be that pressure and as that pressures applied that character starts coming out more and more and more and I don't believe it'll be a surprise when that day happens and we just walk out of here amen Psalms 34 verse 19 says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all amen David was twenty two years in the making twenty two years from the time he was anointed to the time that he was king of Israel and Judah right Abraham was 25 years from the day God gave the promise to the day it came right Paul spent three years on the backside of the desert after being filled with the Holy Ghost to be what the prophet of the age you're not gonna get away by just walking waltzing around this earth and God just dropping things in he's gonna do a testing work amen amen we okay all right Daniel chapter three so be our second story and our last one very familiar Scripture Daniel chapter three is the three Hebrew children Daniel chapter 3 and verse 1 says Nebuchadnezzar the King made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he said it in the plain of Dura and the provinces of Babylon the Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up now I want you to notice something here I'm for the sake of time I haven't I'm not going to go too deep into this but remember that they chose the best of the best out of Israel and brought them as captives to Nebuchadnezzar so when he's talking about all these important people I want you to recognize that that group is sprinkled with Hebrews right supposedly true believers that whole group there's going to be a bunch of them in there because he brought the best of the best to mingle them in with the Babylonian traditions and knowledge to try and come up with even more than Babylon hat right so he wanted to blend them in then on verse 3 says then all the important people were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up and they stood before the image that he'd set up then an Herald cried and said to you it is commanded o people nations and languages at what time you hear the sound of all these different instruments fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up and whoso falleth not down in worship it shall the same hour be cast in the the midst of a burning fiery furnace so for if you're a Hebrew there he's telling you to do what break the first and second commandments how he's telling you to serve it it you know there's another God before you and you're bowing to an idol so he's saying any Hebrews here you've got to break the commandments if you want to live that's what you have to do you have to go against the word amen lose your life or you can you can go against God very simple right but this isn't in church now right this is in real life this is at their jobs this is when they're walking around with friends and whatnot so often we're in the church and everything's rah rah rah we've got our hands raised and we're full of faith but now they're called out and they who knows what they thought when they're being called out and the invitations given and you've got to be here for this then they walk out and see this I don't think maybe them we're thinking we're gonna be told to bow down today right maybe they thought they're gonna see a ceremony or something you know or you know just whatever you know ribbon-cutting ceremony for the the new god of of Babylon but they get there and they're immediately confronted with their beliefs and they're saying either it's you take what you believe and you live by it or you're gonna die by it at our hand right simple choice choose now right there's no let's have a vote you know what do you guys think about this do you think we should all work no it's here's what you're gonna do and if you don't do it you die right very simple and in your face amen we know what they decide to do they stood their ground and it says verse 8 wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews and said in verse 12 that there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men O king have not regarded thee they serve not thy God's nor worship the golden image which thou has set up they only mentioned three Hebrew children there were others there I believe they were there but you know when they fell they fell in the first and second chapter of Daniel when what they gave him food that was prepared for idols they ate of the king's table amen I I spoke on this somewhat to the young people back home and I said if you know you hear about these miracle diets all right I said take the Daniel 10 day diet eat only that which is good for ten days and see what see how you compare to those around you right because what happened is the the the other Hebrews set up we're not gonna stand against the king it's the Kings commandment we're gonna eat whatever he sends our way and it was offered before idols and it was unclean flesh and all these different things I remember brother Mark preaching on their teaching on this in Sunday school and he talked about dried pulse you know and YUM I remember you physically doing that brother mark as one of my favorite memories of Sunday school and dried pulses is legumes and beans and stuff dried ones right horrible horrible right that's why I wasn't born in that age I couldn't survive on it but that's what they lived on and and they drank water they said no wine no juices no anything like that they Dre they a dried pulse and they drank water and after ten days they were obviously the scripture says obviously better than all of the ones around them and then after three years they were ten times better than anybody else in the kingdom not just the ones that were brought in but ten times better than all of the wise men of Babylon that's what a good diet will do for you amen we're not talking about our bodies we're talking about our spiritual food now so the the other Hebrew children they'd fallen long ago and we see the effect of that that's slowly just letting the guard down letting things in have what it brought them to the place where when now the devil comes up and he punches them in the face they're not ready for it they just pulled over right they're not a believer they're make believer and I'm sure they went home and patted each other on the back and said you know we're here where slaves we're not supposed to stand up for ourselves and everything but there were some that did and we see the effect of that later as we go on amen and then we know the true believer stands for God no matter where she is we're in kingdoms right we walk around in our jobs us men especially you're gonna be faced with situations where you have to say yeah I don't do that I'm sorry or I won't do that I remember mom talking about when she worked for the the accountant here and he asked her to tell the client that she'd sent out paperwork and she knew she had said it they hadn't sent it and she had to go to him and say I'm sorry she said I'll tell him we're sending it out now and then I'll go send it but I can't tell him we've sent it because they'd missed a deadline and the guy was trying to pass it off she said I can't do it right there's no time to sit and get prayed up when that happens you've got to be instant in season ready to go this is what I believe and I'm standing for it even if it cost me my job because now it made him look bad right her boss is saying so I told you what to do and you won't do it and you're basically calling me a liar yeah yep right and she stayed with mr. pitcher for years and was blessed in it you know but you've got to be ready for that and it's only by the only way you're gonna do that is if you're eating right that's what we see with the three Hebrew children and Daniel was they were eating right the whole time they kept their standard all along amen verse 13 says then Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the king Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true or Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do not you serve my God's nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if ye be ready at what time you hear the sound of all these different instruments fall down and worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a fire burning fiery furnace now listen to what he says here and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands so he's not just challenging their beliefs he says your God can't do anything about it right nobody can stop me I'm the king this is going to happen I've told you it's gonna happen you're gonna die and there's no God can stop me he's never run up against a God that could stop him right what God can deliver you out of my hands does anybody had that happen recently a situation that says who can deliver you from this we've had it in our family Atlanta gets cancer right what is it that's Satan standing up and saying can your job deliver you from this what God can do this everybody else dies you're weak you're light weight you're never gonna make it through this what God can save you right then we look at ones with chronic conditions and these different things and they say there's no cure right Blanka when she got pregnant with Selena she had the gall bladder trouble right and that plagued her for months and months and months there's no cure for that we know that you can basically mitigate it with diet or you can cut your your-your-your gall bladder out right you can't do anything about there's no healing for gallbladder disease those issues and yet in one moment in a service dog came down boom and healed her completely she was eating almost nothing there was oh so little that she could eat and because of that condition and Selena was completely colicky if you remember and in one service God came down they pray for her and boom completely healed and we went out for ice cream after that which was the worst thing possible for her to be eating and Selena was never colicky again after that in one moment Satan went from who can deliver you from this to out the door and enjoy an ice-cream it at the same time right right Satan comes down he says all these things nobody can be healed of this this is a chronic condition nobody's ever beat this there are certain things that people in the message are scared of sorry it's true it's true and what is it saying saying who can deliver you from this take courage from these and say what did they say they said an answer to the king verse 16 okay old Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter we don't have to sit around and take a vote what are we going to do we don't have to guard our words if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O king so he says God's keep our God is capable of anything he can deliver us out of this but verse 18 if not be it known unto thee O king we will not serve thy God's nor worship the golden image which I was set up he says our God can you want to know a god that can I serve a God that can a man where is the God of Elijah that's the God that we serve in this age is the God of Elijah that has proven himself in signs and wonders and he has not changed since brother Branham left the scene Amen there's nothing different the presence of the Holy Spirit is what heals I mean it's not a prophet that heals it's that angel standing there that touches the person they meant what God can deliver you out of our hand they say ours can but if he doesn't we're not changing we're not going to change anything amen if he doesn't deliver us doesn't matter we're not going to bow now we see things get hurt get bad in a hurry verse 19 says then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visit was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego so he was kind of like I'll give you a check I think he knew about them you know if they were so good at things he probably heard about them it was kinda like I'll give you another chance I know about you guys I know that you're a benefit to the kingdom you're smarter than all the rest in these things I'll give you a second chance okay just don't make me look bad just go bow but it says that changes now and he just he's so furious and what to do he says therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated engineers would say he exceeded the operational limits of the furnace cranked it up right he's mad seven times hotter than it was supposed to be in because it says then it was want to be hit as he did so what then it was supposed to be heated and how it was normally heated seven times more and listen to this verse 20 it says and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast him into the burning fiery furnace in order of the wimps he brought the champions out he brought the big hairy mean dudes right he brought the goliaths in his army and said you're the ones that are gonna take them over there because he knew what he knew that it was going to be tough just to get them there it's so hot he knew you're gonna need the biggest the best the strongest the meanest the baddest amen verse 21 says then these men were bound in their coats their hosing and their hats and their other garments if you know anything about babylonian garments that's a bad thing in a fire all right lots of frilly things and everything you're gonna go up like a like a roman candle right and they were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace but listen to this it says therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego so they're going and walking into the flames and their captors died the most mighty thing that Satan could bring against them dies before they can even be consumed so the weakest Christian if you want to say that walking into that trial can survive where the mightiest of Satan's army cannot amen that ought to give us some courage this evening when we think about this as when you're walking into the fire and everyone around you is falling down you ought to recognize there's something special going on amen but look at that these mighty men were so committed to that King that they gave their lives to throw somebody else into the fire this isn't you know mortal combat this is not a fair fight this is willingly walking your way until you die of heat Satan has no logic right if you're looking at what's happening against you if you're facing persecutions troubles trials sickness there's no logic to it right it's all about destroying you and they will destroy themselves The Situation's I faced at work with my previous employer they were cutting their own throats by the things they were doing to me and they didn't care they were just focused on getting me out of there it was amazing it was amazing what was happening there was no logic to it but what it was Satan coming against me I firmly believe that because it made no sense otherwise you know listen to what brother branham says in victory day talking about this he says God has counted you worthy when you have a test so test shows worthiness of the believer he says now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you you have found favor with God and God believes you'll stand the test I'm gonna read that again it says it shows the grace of God how many of us are looking at those trials and saying thank you Lord this is your grace that you believe that I can make it through you have found favor with God we think of Mary that's finding favor right be done to me according to thy word but that's what he's doing he's saying what's going to happen is what the word said is gonna happen so get ready for this is my grace to you and God believes that you'll stand the test amen hallelujah verse 23 it says in these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men into the midst of the fire the answered and said unto the king true O king he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God now that's a really quick sequence so I want to break this down because you got a recognize that those three Hebrew children knew something was happening okay let's make that the fire so they're there and they're bound right they can't run and they've got the mighty men and they're walking them slowly towards the fire and I'm sure it was a ways away right this wasn't a 30-second walk because otherwise it would have you know the heat would have been destroyed ever so they're probably walking for five or ten minutes to get over there you know and so they've got this slow walk towards sudden death and the heat should be building and building and building and what they notice is the things the people that are holding them that are pushing them forward aren't pushing as hard as they used to right so they're going forward and they're kind of looking back and they're noticing the sweat rolling off of the guys that are behind them the big muscular burly warriors are struggling to just push them into the fire and they're getting closer and closer and abednego he's looking at me shocked he's saying Meshach how are you doing he says I'm good how are you doing look good so far let's keep walking and meanwhile the guys behind them are going slower and slower and they're slumping to the ground and the last thing they can do before they die is push them in there but by the time they get to here and they're close to the fire what's happening to Abednego and Meshach and and Shadrach they're saying I don't feel anything I'm walking into the fire and I'm okay right they know that something is happening and so they keep walking and they get pushed in but I believe they would have just walked in anyways because what's killing everyone around them has no effect on them right as they're sitting there and this cooling breeze blows over what is is the mighty presence of God coming down and he's Fanning the flames to kill everybody around them to burn off their bindings the things that held them and then they fall into the flames and they're happy to stay there right right they're looking for marshmallows all right we're in the fire and we're okay they're in the trial and there is nothing that is asking them to get out there's nothing in them that says I need to get out of this trial right now or something bad is going to happen they're standing in the flames and happy to walk around and talk to God in the trial you can't tell me that something wasn't happening as I started to walk closer and closer to that fire and they say he's here he's here he's here our God is able amen they start to recognize the very presence of the God that they believed and they walk into that fire and all of a sudden they have an experience with God that they could never have imagined and it took a slow walk into a seven times hotter fire that killed everybody else around them for them to experience God in a way that nobody else has ever experienced of what spiritual muscles they must have had after that right to where they're walking around and they don't come out until the King says come out they're happy to stay in the trial and experience the presence of God until the King commands them to come out experience let me say again experience the presence of God in the fire until somebody tells them to come out there's a they had an absolute experience there that is unmatched in scripture unmatched in scripture who ever heard of walking around in a fire in comfort and the only thing that's burned off is the very things that were holding them and killed all the enemies that have pushed them in there in the first place and converted that King to a degree right amazing where the brown said this in the message Shalom he says oh yes he permits crosses and crossroads and junctions he always does that in order to perfect us for a service he permits those things to happen can you understand that he says he does that so that he can perfect you for the calling he has called you for that's you're growing pains he did Daniel that way you know he says he did the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace what did the fiery furnace do the fiery first only broke the bands that had them bound that's all the furnace did just burnt loose the band's sometimes that trial is to burn off those things it's to bring them out so that they can be burned off amen amen standing for God and so comfortable in the trial that they wouldn't leave it The effect of it was better the effect of God was better than anything else they'd rather stay there amen now gone through that but I want you to recognize I'm gonna read what brother Bram says and it's a page and a half so bear with me but he does it in such a wonderful way because so often we think we're alone in the trial and we think God's holding off and why is he holding off in these different things but watch her brother branham says about this he's talking about the soldiers he says those fellows pushing them holding their heads back they get right up just one more step now and away they go down into the fiery furnace to be consumed why the men that was standing plumb behind them died of the intense heat he said goes to show that God was right with them on the march right the fear starts to drop away as they're getting closer he says he'll be right with you from this night on when you just take him just stand on his word and believe he's in his word and in his son he says here they go marching right on right up to the edge watch one more step and in there they go and that's the toughest isn't it when you're you're like this is it we're going in he says our picture looks pretty bright pretty dark right now for believers doesn't it he says let's just turn our camera or binoculars and look up you know all the time there's something going on in earth there's something going on in heaven I can see them let's look at him a moment I can see him sitting on his throne his priestly robes all around him I can see coming to his right a noise what is it let's call it Gabriel the great Archangel Rob to the side of him pulled a sword and said master have you looked down in Babylon three true believers are meeting their end he says have you beheld them he says I've obeyed you since you created me let me go down I'll change the scene just in a few moments I believe he could don't you brother Bram says I believe he could Gabriel he says that big sore pulled and David seen him with the Joshua seen him when he crossed the river then when he said I'm the captain of the hosts of the Lord I've seen that horrid sword drawn and he said Lord let me go down I can hear him say Gabriel you've been a good angel since the day I created you you have obeyed me but I just can't let you go I can see Gabriel put his sword back into the sheath stand attention at his side he says oh my everything in heaven obeyed him that's right all but the heart of men they don't want to obey Him they don't want to believe him says look coming to the left here comes another angel look at him he says God has ministering spirits angel that's often what we're looking for isn't it a ministering spirit to come he said I believe that this one right here now not fire and he stood what was his name wormwood bitter waters I hear him say Oh master have you looked down into Babylon let me go down there this morning you gave me the keys to the antediluvian destruction I poured the waters over the earth he said worm word has it controls of all the waters of the earth the Bible says and there he says I'll go down and wash Babylon off the face of the earth I believe he could have done it don't you yes sir he said old master looked down there he says and I can hear him say what worm you've been a good angel you obeyed me and brought up the springs of the deep and so forth and destroyed the world in the days of Noah but I just can't let you go I can see wormwood taking his place again and stand at attention have you considered another angel said he said yes I've been watching them all along he says old brother if he considered three he's considering about three thousand here tonight - he's in a big service you know he says his eyes on the sparrow he knows right now what do you have need of he knows why you've come to this meeting tonight but I can hear him say I can't let you go you fellows because I'm going myself he says oh my I can see him rise he says you think I'm crazy don't you you're gonna call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well do it he says he noticed I love him I hold my life wrapped in him I see nothing but him and I can see him rise from his throne his garments drop around him gets out there and way back over in the North Country I see a big Thunder head I can hear him say come here oh my I can hear him say east wind west north and south come here everything mines him that's right I can hear him say go over there and get under that Thunder head and roll it over here here comes the north east south and west winds going to this big Thunder head and here it comes turning up to the side of the throne I can see him step on that and say winds I'm gonna drive you like horses this morning I'm going down to Babylon he says I can see him reach up and get ahold of his zigzag lightning with his hands past by the tree of life and pick off a branch and they made their last step trusting God's Word and about that time they stepped in there was one like the son of man standing by their side he says hallelujah yes sir with a palm from the life Fanning away even with the hot breezes down there talking with them there's some things God says no I don't send an angel for this one says I'm gonna come down and do it myself and then there's a reason why there's silence for a space of about half an hour under that seventh seal amen he's down here he says I'm not going to just send somebody else to do with this this is something that I'm gonna do in this bride a man there's this deity this gold character of God says I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna be there with them to bring them through it in person amen what they experienced there was a difference between knowing about it and knowing it that's really what this was about for them was that this didn't just come now from a God that gave Daniel dreams right this wasn't one that gave Daniel visions this was now a personal experience with God that proved a beyond a shadow of a doubt his reality and his care and consideration for them wasn't just that he was real but that he had accepted their belief that he accepted their sacrifice that he had stood by them and that he would stand by them forever amen amen they were not rescued until they were literally in the fire and sometimes that's what we're waiting for we're saying I believe I believe I believe and he'll let you walk right into it before he takes you up amen listen over brother Branham said the message how I can how can I overcome though he's talking about the confidence that comes with these trials he says Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had so much victory until the fire couldn't burn them so much victory until the fire can burn them you know victory is a hard thing to burn out or eat up or anything he said see so they had it because what character is a victory and character is all that's left when the burning is done and then that's all that's left that's the only thing that can stand the fire is that godly character amen but what did it what cost was it to them what cost was it to the three Hebrew children it was all or nothing there was no halfway right there is no let's go until it starts to get uncomfortable until the heat gets bad right until the clothes start to kind of crinkle and you know and our hats catch on fire no it was all the way or nothing and that was what the cost of them was they had to say I'm in it the long haul I'm in it until we die or until he rescues us and that's it there is no other way about it right so we look at those two stories hand in those Hebrew children right seeking the will and purpose of God that's always surrender the key to that is always surrender you can't have your plans your thoughts your ideas your intellect your training your experience it has got to be him and him alone amen waiting on the Lord and trusting his timing you'll see it in the scripture time and time again trusting him to do it in his way amen how many times did they bring victory through different means in the in the in the Old Testament especially right sometimes he's got Gideon out there he turns the enemy on themselves and then Gideon goes in with some pitchers with fire inside of it and destroys 120,000 people right other times he takes the priests and leads them in worship sometimes our victory is through worship right sometimes it's with what a prophet a minister of the Lord comes in right and sometimes it's that they turn their face to the wall and they pray until God answers right there's so many different ways that God can move in our lives and it's just to sit back and say Lord I'll trust you and your timing in whichever way you want to do it amen amen stand on what you believe no matter the opposition that's what the Hebrew children did and when you do that when you stand we're so insured these days have you noticed that I think sometimes God has to hammer us so hard because we've got so many protections built in financially with our health with our jobs with our pensions and everything and we're so insured to the hilt that he almost has to kill us to get our attention sometimes because we can shrug off almost anything right the doctors are so good the technology is so good blah-blah-blah-blah-blah that he's almost got to murder us to get our attention sometimes you know but when you're all or nothing you're saying lord it's your word and I'm not gonna put an insurance plan in the backup that's what well oftentimes our issue is is that we say we believe the word but we've got a back-up plan just in case right if we're honest that's the way it is a lot of times especially I think the older folks maybe not so much but us younger folks and and you know the the 40 and under group it's true isn't it we say if it doesn't happen then we'll just do this right or we can do this or we can mitigate with this or we can kind of just smooth it over with that No all or nothing right if there's gonna be victory let it be real victory let it not be a half victory right and let it not be a half commitment let it not be a half purpose and let it not be a half ministry but let it be all the way a men and then what like Hannah prays God through it all alright those three Hebrew children I guarantee you they were having a jubilee time in that fire when God Himself comes down and stands next to you and I'm pretty sure he was saying guys you're amazing you are amazing like whoa wasn't sure you know not many people could do that you are amazing east I imagine he was there encouraging them and just expressing his pride that they had stood the test that's a test that's a test when you say my life is in your hands he says you stood the time and I'm so proud of you for that you know but as we look at these trials there's one thing and as we start to close that we've got to recognize and it goes back to the principle at the beginning and that's that if God brings a trial your way it has a purpose and when the purpose has been a tree achieved the trial has to cease right they sing that song it didn't come to stay it came to pass and sometimes we get into this place where we think this is just a never-ending trial that is my lot in life but when the purpose has been served remember God doesn't put suffering on us without a reason so when the reason has been met this suffering has to go away the trial has to cease amen so sometimes it's you know marital issues sometimes it's financial issues sometimes it's health issues I mean how many times do you hear somebody that says something like well maybe I'm meant to have this sickness on my life right they've got a chronic condition and they're saying well this is just my lot in life there isn't a single scripture in the New Testament and I say the New Testament because that's when Jesus gave us the New Covenant and that's when he said in my hand you know if they what follows the believers is what they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover right after that there is no place in scripture where you will find somebody that is made sick to stay sick I'm going to read you four scriptures Luke thirteen thirteen listen to this it's always for the glory and praise of God Luke thirteen thirteen says and he laid his hands on her immediately she was made straight and glorified God Luke 1715 says and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God Luke 23 47 says and when the Centurion saw what was done he glorified God saying certainly this was a righteous man John 11 forces when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified there by John 9 verse 2 and his disciples said asked him say master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind chronic condition jesus answered and said neither had this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him amen listen to what brother Branham says beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation he says now before you can have a victory there has to be a battle and if there's no battles there's no victories so we ought to be thankful for the battles and the trains and it's God giving us the opportunity to have victories so there's got to come a victory at the end of the trial right there's got to be a reason for the battle and the battle has to be is only over when the victories won amen he says all my doesn't that make you a little bit better now see the battle come along somebody say something bad about you sickness come on to you maybe God give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show his favor to you let you see what he means by it and he says he loves you amen every trial was made to overcome for the Bram says this and the message experienced he says yes I believe the Word of God teaches healing for the body and the soul but not only that but God confirms the words with signed him signs and wonders following he says I will admit that God permits Satan sometimes to chastise us that's true but when that chastisement is through you come back to God God your father will heal you he says that's right there's nothing given to us that is meant to hold us for this life now I know somebody's saying what about Paul write that scripture it says Paul prayed and they asked God to take it away and he prayed three times and God said my grace is sufficient for you I'm glad you asked us brother branham answered it in the very next paragraph but let's read the scripture first and I'll read it again for the of time second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7 it says this is Paul speaking says unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations so Paul remembers gone out in the desert he's come back after three years and he says nobody can match me for what I know like nobody can teach me anything what God has given me is greater than as good or greater than anything out there he says he says the reason I have this issue is so that I don't get exalted Paul had an issue with humility you could say raid says and he says because of this I was get there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan debuff at me lest I should be exalted above measure so God is allowed Satan to buff it Paul to keep him humble listen to this it says for this thing I besought the Lord thrice three times st. that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me that Paul says therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am i strong so people look at that and say well Paul was perpetually sick already had a none curable disease of some sort brother branham said this he said I will admit there's a sickness unto death he said and that's why prophetic gifts are in the church to know these things so what he's saying is if you're gonna die from it God will let you know that this is your time to go right and if he doesn't tell you it's your time to go then it's not yours to hold on to that's the bottom line he says but to say that our Father that a man that had rheumatism or arthritis say yes Lord I'm just glad to have it glad you gave it to me I embrace it I love it my glory and tribulation he said Paul's thorn in the flesh that was no more disease than nothing else he says if it wasn't healing he got well and he said the messenger of the devil will buff at me he said what does that word buff it mean blow after blow like a boxer just hitting him over and over and over again he says see then he healed him he got will well then he healed him again he got sick he healed him he got sick blow after blow he says he was healed got sick healed got sick heal got sick it was his back and forth thing and it was drove Paul nuts because he's like where's the healing he says I'll heal you then you're gonna be sick again and it's just gonna be back and forth back and forth you look at brother branham with his stomach trouble right so brother branham when he took the Lord at his word it took a year for his disease to go away and to where he could eat anything but he still had a weakness in his stomach if you remember all the way until he had that that time I believe it was in Sabino Canyon and then he saw the squirrel remember and if it had been killed and it said thy enemy is dead all right and he's and that was it that was his stomach trouble was done forever he talks about how his stomach lining had been all chewed up and everything and and so many issues but he said that was it and that was his healing right then and there so he the Lord had healed him of the initial issue but he had a weakness in his body much like Paul did for the rest of his life and there was just grace to cover that but then he said boom it was done and this is Jenna I was nineteen sixty five or sixty I think was 65 so it's right at the end but God still said you're not you're not going you're not going to the grave with this all right I'm gonna heal you of it right brother Brian continues this he's speaking of a minister not an you know a nominal minister said he says he's twisted it to say sickness was of God that we should welcome them he says if God gives it to us just testify and spit dust in the devil's face and say I can stand it and bear it for God put it upon us for his glory brother Graham says who I can't see that he says that's not the gospel of my Lord Jesus Christ he said God is not the author of sickness you can't pin that on my father he came to heal us the devil is the one who makes us sick he says absolutely if we're going through these trials for victory the character of Christ then when you've got it whatever else is left has to flee and then it has to go before the word of God nothing can stand before him when you're where you need to be amen there has to be an end to that situation each and every time LeBron said this the musicians can come he says you told us how it's done speaking of Christ he says you didn't only tell us but you showed us how it was done you led us you showed us how to do it receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold to that word it is written in every temptation he says but be humble walk humbly then we have conquered through you through your power which has already conquered our enemy and the only thing we have to do is just walk humble with faith believing that and our badge of identification of the Holy Ghost he says and Satan has to move and then when Christ is revealed in you the trial is over remember what we talked about at the revealing of Jesus Christ when that's revealed that trials over and you get to move on to the next one in the next one I'm gonna read what brother Branham quoted there earlier in first Peter 4 it says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing had happened to you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed where in you when his glory shall be revealed that ye may be glad also with exceeding joy amen let's just stand together I can honestly say in the past three years I've probably grown more in the previous 15 with what God's been putting me through in different situations and and whatnot but I'll tell you when you go through it and you start to step out in faith and you start to recognize what he's doing it gives you a faith to move on to the next challenge because you start to see that he's moving and he's working and he's got a plan and he has a purpose and all of a sudden you almost get worried when things aren't going badly you know it's kind of messed up in a way but in he's not pushing you you're almost like we got a rapture to make we need to get back to the battle you know I'm thankful for the trip for that for the downtime don't get me wrong but it's almost like things are cranking up more and more and more and it's just one thing after another after another but I take heart in that because if your heart is clean if your heart is clear your conscience is clear then you know that it's all working out for your good and so you have to look in - he's got a plan he's got a purpose he's got something he's trying to work out in this situation and so you just pull your hands off and you say Lord it's in your hands show me what you want me to learn show me what your purpose is show me what your plan is and I'll rejoice in the meantime and then that's where we want to be is where we can say Lord whatever you're doing you're doing it well and I'm gonna trust you and then and then more precious than gold is when we can say Lord I value what you have for me more than what I think it should be amen when we put him his way of doing things his thinking above our own and we see that mind of Christ and we just say I have no thought coming there's a quote that I meant to read in our service the other night at home but where the Brad talked about the church he said and he said you know it's a latest see an age of rights he says you have no rights you have nothing says you have to surrender it to Christ and let him do the work and that's where we want to be tonight amen in this trial of our faith it's precious when we say and we can surrender and say Lord this one's all up to you you're not going to get to heaven on your own merits you're not gonna figure out your way into a rapture I mean that's gonna be a move of grace exactly brother Joel it's gonna be grace from start to finish amen it says grace so his brother Ram said it shows that he favors us when he gives us these things amen let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we are thankful for your presence tonight we're thankful for a people Lord that will pull on the word that will Lord listen or not just listen but apply it to their lives Lord Jesus Lord we pray now that your spirit would just have control lord over each heart and soul Lord that you would just move on the different ones that are here Lord that you administer to their lives Lord as they've heard and listen Lord Lord as our hearts have been pricked or maybe their faith has been challenged maybe it's been lifted up Lord may you just move in each heart and soul and confirm yourself to them individually Lord God Lord just bless your people now as we worship you for a while but may your spirit just be so sweet and wonderful or maybe we just so thankful to be here and to know that you are a real God Lord in to have an experience that confirms it in our hearts and our lives no god bless your people now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask any men we know that some through it all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus

about the three Hebrew children I think so I think it's just a great story but what came out one of the things that came out to me tonight was it was this that while those soldiers brother John was describing we're trying to bring two Hebrew children into the litter fire they were falling they were they were they were dying and all approach to me is that Satan is a defeated enemy all right he's already defeated that's what it means right so a lot of times we just don't we don't think about that a lot of ministries say the same we preach the same thing that I've heard over the years Satan is a defeated enemy praise the Lord that's why it's going around as a roaring life but greater is He that's it right greater is he right pray some of we're a privileged people we just forget that
