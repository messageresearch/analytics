[40:18] I believe
[40:26] [Music]
[40:30] the
[40:33] all things are possible
[40:38] now I aim at praise the Lord
[40:46] Lord bless and again determine with me
[40:49] to the Book of Psalms chapter 57 I've
[40:53] read done the last service I read Psalms
[40:56] 91 and a number of the believers
[40:59] concerning a number of believers that
[41:01] had that had highlighted it and I was I
[41:03] was surprised not just the regular
[41:06] believers but there was a number of
[41:08] pastors message ministries online and
[41:13] that I had heard just just touched in to
[41:17] hear what they were ministering on and
[41:18] they mentioned Psalms 91 oh yeah I
[41:22] believe those brother might have been
[41:24] brother Chad lamb Psalm 91 brother Tim
[41:26] Pruett Psalms 91 brother Tony brother
[41:29] Donnie Reagan rather sobs that he won
[41:31] and I said Lord and also I've received
[41:34] an email from her brother a million and
[41:37] an elderly brother and again not a not
[41:40] necessarily a message believer but a
[41:42] gentleman that I have known for many
[41:44] many years and just to say that he had
[41:49] emailed me and exec sortation concerning
[41:54] the word concerning the Lord and when I
[41:56] went down through it I said well praise
[41:59] the Lord
[41:59] he mentioned Psalms 91 a man and also I
[42:03] mentioned brother Karsan mentioned
[42:05] Psalms 91 and brother Carson's the
[42:07] emphasis was that the emergency number
[42:10] is 911 well he said we'll go to 91 1 he
[42:14] said Psalms and he said that's the
[42:17] emergency call of the Lord trust the
[42:19] Lord a man and the Lord would be there
[42:21] to deliver us a man and so and after of
[42:26] course when I got almond on after that
[42:28] service I received an email from our
[42:30] sister Maureen and she had referenced
[42:33] Psalms 57 a man and again the promise of
[42:38] Psalms 91 is similar to Psalm 57 a man
[42:42] so the faith that David had we pray that
[42:44] we got
[42:45] a man that our faith is in God praise
[42:48] the Lord so let's read Psalms 57 and me
[42:52] just before just to bring greetings to
[42:54] the Saints here and those online from
[42:59] our brother makandal he called last
[43:02] evening and I spoke to him for a while
[43:04] on the phone and he was requesting a
[43:08] quote that I have already shared with
[43:10] the Saints here and I guess he must have
[43:12] known about it and it was had to do with
[43:16] germ warfare and he said buzzy said I
[43:21] want I want to copy that quote and so I
[43:23] sent him that one from 1954 and 1960 so
[43:28] just bear bear in mind that the baba
[43:30] didn't just say it in 54 and but he also
[43:34] mentioned again referenced it again in
[43:36] 1960 concerning the germ warfare and
[43:40] that's what you and i are witnessing in
[43:42] the world today and that's why that we
[43:43] are we are in this situation of just
[43:47] four of a series of four or five of us
[43:49] here in the church and the others online
[43:52] home amen and not only here but it's the
[43:57] same thing in I believe in our brother
[43:58] Tim Pruitt's and our brother Donnie
[44:00] Reagan's and other churches in the
[44:02] United States
[44:03] amen now I don't know if you know about
[44:07] one Church there that is not not a
[44:09] message Church not by any means but the
[44:13] pastor at five hundred in the
[44:14] congregation but he didn't he didn't
[44:17] take the advice of the of the government
[44:19] in the United States and he just kept
[44:22] this congregation of 500 he still
[44:24] gathered them and he got arrested and
[44:27] and I'm not he was in jail I don't know
[44:31] if he's still in jail or not but they
[44:32] and so on so we pray the grace of God to
[44:36] him to give him maybe the wisdom that he
[44:38] needs
[44:38] Amen because this has nothing to do with
[44:41] what we're teaching and what we believe
[44:44] no not by any means you know but but
[44:48] it's just just for the safety and the
[44:50] health and welfare of those that go to
[44:54] the church or others that they would
[44:56] meet you know and so on so we pray the
[44:58] grace of
[44:59] to that brother and to the assembly a
[45:02] man then they'll have the wisdom of God
[45:04] a man I'm sure that that Jesus would
[45:07] follow the same why live render to
[45:10] Caesar the things that are Caesar's and
[45:11] it's not contrary to the will of God or
[45:14] the Word of God not by any means
[45:16] especially if we got online streaming a
[45:19] man no the back years ago we have read
[45:23] that you know and many didn't have it
[45:26] but again brother Brown said he said God
[45:30] God ordained the invention of the of the
[45:34] recorder the tape recorder
[45:36] and what was it it was the big one the
[45:38] reel-to-reel you know because that was
[45:40] the first record riot and and a brother
[45:43] in in in no Brunswick bought my first
[45:47] recorder for me name and we had the reel
[45:50] to reels that's what we used in will be
[45:52] add cottage means in gamble and some in
[45:55] Buren was the reel-to-reel some years
[45:57] ago and the Provost said God he said
[46:01] predestinated and for Dane that the
[46:03] invention of that tape recorder he said
[46:06] for the message of the hour
[46:08] yeah he said that way back in the in
[46:11] 1940 or the early 1950s he referenced it
[46:15] you can check that online and so God
[46:18] ordained the invention of the tape
[46:20] recorder happenin God also wanted the
[46:22] invention of the online streaming they
[46:25] meant because he knew it was going to
[46:26] come to this place a man he knew that we
[46:29] would have to deal with these situations
[46:30] and these circumstances amen but where
[46:34] would that excuse Amen to say well I
[46:36] can't hear the word and I can't do this
[46:38] and I can't do that oh yes you can
[46:39] because God it got it got will point to
[46:42] point you to that
[46:43] online streaming he meant by the grace
[46:45] of God so we pray we thank God for that
[46:48] amen praise the Lord we know that the
[46:50] recordings have gone beyond just just
[46:52] the old fashioned tapes and so on can't
[46:55] beyond that for sure and I witnessed it
[46:57] and in me even in my life so god help us
[47:01] and God be with us as we go to the word
[47:03] and as the brothers and sisters online
[47:06] are hearing the word a man not only here
[47:09] but even even around the world by grace
[47:13] the Lord bless you in Psalms chapter 57
[47:16] and again god bless our brother at
[47:18] Macondo amen and verse 1 be merciful
[47:25] unto me O God be merciful unto me praise
[47:28] the Lord for my soul trusts it in thee
[47:33] yay in the shadow of thy wings well I
[47:37] make my refuge until these calamities be
[47:42] over past well brother trust it's going
[47:46] to get worse does something if this
[47:48] passes something else that's going to
[47:49] come a man
[47:51] what's the for it's for destinated is
[47:53] for ordained what for to get us to look
[47:56] up
[47:57] he said when this happens when that
[47:59] happens and means arts are fading for
[48:01] fear but not the bright and all you're
[48:04] encouraged look up because the day of
[48:06] your Redemption draws nigh a man so
[48:10] brother sister let's not let's not God
[48:12] let's not have the wrong reaction to
[48:14] what's going on this adds a scriptural
[48:16] what biblical word reaction to what's
[48:20] going on oh the world is reacting this
[48:22] way reacting that way and and I don't
[48:25] know if you noticed it but we have words
[48:28] so little about God we were so little
[48:31] about the Lord you know when it comes to

[52:40] amen praise the name of the Lord turn
[52:44] with me to the book of Galatians the
[52:48] Galatians chapter 1
[52:59] we started this series with one of these
[53:02] from scriptures and the Lord willing I'm
[53:05] hoping to be able to conclude the
[53:09] thoughts on the god of this evil age
[53:12] that is the message itself there is
[53:15] another message that I want to highlight
[53:17] and that I want to share with you
[53:19] concerning as this is the one that he
[53:22] preached after this and it is Satan's
[53:24] Eden he's talking to me giving us the
[53:27] revelation of the god of this evil age
[53:29] and then giving us a further revelation
[53:32] that as God had put Adam and Eve in in
[53:35] in the Garden of Eden so the devil now
[53:38] is putting his that of an is Eve in a
[53:40] Garden of Eden a man but it is Satan see
[53:44] not God's Eden so god help us that were
[53:48] not going to be blind to the revelation
[53:51] of the god of this evil age and we're
[53:53] not going to be blind to the revelation
[53:55] that the world is experiencing Satan's
[53:58] Eden a man so God have mercy on us and
[54:01] brother God is allowing all of these
[54:03] things to come to pass he's allowing all
[54:06] these things to happen because why
[54:08] because the world has to come under the
[54:11] power the anointing and the control of
[54:14] Antichrist
[54:15] amen always well this is not business
[54:18] this is not going to bring the
[54:20] Antichrist it will bring the Antichrist
[54:22] on the scene it will cause all the
[54:24] nations eventually to turn everything
[54:26] over to the Antichrist a man because I
[54:30] totally if this is doing anything is
[54:31] putting all nations on the same level
[54:33] that's exactly so it's not this nation
[54:36] above that one that one above that one
[54:38] down one down there that God is bringing
[54:40] them all down a man this is why he's
[54:43] allowing that the enemy to do this he's
[54:45] allowing the enemy to do that it's to
[54:47] put them all on the same level and he'll
[54:49] bring them all under the control of the
[54:51] Antichrist and that is the absolute
[54:53] truth
[54:54] amen because I have prayed and I have
[54:56] been asking the Lord or why are you
[54:58] allowing this what's going on Lord
[55:00] what's this going to lead to and
[55:02] basically this is what it's going to
[55:04] lead to a man to the control of the
[55:07] Antichrist
[55:08] amen because they're not dirt again
[55:10] they're not giving the glory to God then
[55:12] I
[55:13] the glories of Christ then I did not
[55:15] call me on the Lord they're not calling
[55:16] you on our Lord Jesus Christ and not by
[55:19] any means but brother it's going to it's
[55:21] going to come to pass that they are
[55:23] they're going to be deceived by the god
[55:24] of this evil age a man then they're
[55:27] going to be deceived by the Antichrist
[55:29] and that will be the basically it will
[55:32] be the god of this evil age in flesh a
[55:35] man in the beginning was the word the
[55:38] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[55:39] well brother sister now it's coming to
[55:41] the place where the Antichrist is made
[55:43] flesh
[55:43] oh yeah correct Christ was made flesh
[55:46] now the Antichrist is made place and
[55:48] that's why that now he is the god of
[55:50] this evil age because he wanted to be
[55:53] like God a man I'm gonna be this I'm
[55:56] gonna be that I will do this I will do
[55:58] that I will ascend above the most sigh
[56:01] amen I will be like the Most High amen
[56:05] and then and then goddess well oh yeah
[56:08] but he did this no God permitted it a
[56:11] man God permitted it for a reason
[56:13] brother what God does God is God is
[56:16] allowing these guys allowing that on the
[56:19] one hand it's against akechi select on
[56:21] the other end it's it's tiket see that
[56:25] is there this serpents eat a million so
[56:29] I trust were the seat of God and brother
[56:31] I tell you that God got this and God
[56:34] allows that this is going to get the
[56:36] attention of his seat and the other is
[56:38] going to get to change the Serpent's eat
[56:39] a man oh my brother one is going to
[56:43] worship Almighty God and the other was
[56:45] going to worship the impersonation of
[56:48] God a man and Satan is there to
[56:51] impersonate God
[56:52] that's right brother and brother he's
[56:54] doing it and not only that but I tell
[56:57] you this he has become an object of
[56:59] worship they think they're worshiping
[57:02] Almighty God
[57:03] they think they're worshiping Elohim
[57:05] they think they're worshiping Jesus but
[57:07] they're worshiping the devil amen that's
[57:10] exactly the truth and brother is not God
[57:13] Almighty God that's influencing them it
[57:15] is the god of this evil age that is
[57:17] influencing their thoughts their words
[57:19] and their deeds a man the life they live
[57:22] the thoughts are thinking and what
[57:24] they're talking it's
[57:26] the influence of the god of this evil
[57:28] age and and oh yeah it's but it's
[57:30] deceiving it's not it's not going to be
[57:32] thinking or talking about devilish words
[57:36] we call it no no it's gonna be it's
[57:38] going to be impersonation personating
[57:40] God impersonating the word a man so
[57:44] brother sister god help us that we're
[57:45] not going to get caught up and caught
[57:48] away with the false revelation of the
[57:50] word a man there is a truth and there's
[57:53] a false revelation of the truth brother
[57:56] and have brother prove it in the word go
[57:58] right on back to Genesis and right on
[58:00] back to the Garden of Eden a man and
[58:03] there was the word and there was an
[58:05] impersonation of the word a man because
[58:08] God gave Adam the word and the devil
[58:10] came and interpreted to Eve and brother
[58:14] he didn't take away the word he added to
[58:17] the word a man hallelujah
[58:19] mother thank God for that revelation to
[58:22] put us on our guard that the enemy is
[58:24] not taking away the word taking a ray
[58:26] the message taking away these
[58:28] revelations what he's going to do is
[58:30] yeah yeah yes God said yes God said this
[58:34] is this is the truth concerning this
[58:36] doctrine and that doctor that doctrine
[58:38] but I say unto you and he'll just maybe
[58:41] add a word or take away a word here
[58:44] they're a man and brother we've got the
[58:47] witness of that down through the ages
[58:49] not only Old Testament but New Testament
[58:52] as we went through any when we were in
[58:55] the last service and in the last message
[58:57] we went through revelation to show you
[58:59] the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man
[59:01] it was the influence of the Antichrist
[59:03] spirit coming into the church a man that
[59:06] Christ had come into the church and
[59:08] after Christ came into the church
[59:09] Antichrist came into the church a man
[59:12] God Christ was there and then the devil
[59:15] came there to impersonate him the devil
[59:17] came there to say yeah as God said yes
[59:20] God said but I say unto you a man and
[59:23] they believed what the devil was saying
[59:25] that is the truth and brother my because
[59:28] they sounded to me right it's oh yeah
[59:30] it's the word it's the word yeah it was
[59:32] the word but Satan added to the word a
[59:36] man as same was bringing the people what
[59:39] was he doing
[59:39] he was bringing the people out from
[59:42] under the influence of God's leadership
[59:45] to the influence of Antichrist
[59:47] leadership that is the truth brother you
[59:49] go back to the first stage you can go
[59:51] back to Revelation chapter 2 you can go
[59:54] back 2,000 years to the first church age
[59:56] and we'll see that's exactly what the
[59:58] enemy did that's what he was doing
[1:00:00] that's what he did a man because God had
[1:00:03] given the word a man stay with the word
[1:00:06] thus saith the Lord a man and but then
[1:00:09] enemy came in and he began to
[1:00:11] impersonate the truth even to
[1:00:14] impersonate a man what the disciples the
[1:00:18] Apostles the prophets amen
[1:00:21] yes God said but oh yeah they did
[1:00:25] they'll tell you this but they won't
[1:00:27] tell you this but the devil's lot is
[1:00:30] lying to them amen because they're going
[1:00:33] to receive the truth the whole truth
[1:00:34] nothing but the truth but the enemy
[1:00:36] comes into a head to that truth a man
[1:00:39] and remember oh well oh brother but
[1:00:42] they're false they're false
[1:00:43] wait a wait a minute the truth is the
[1:00:45] truth but see the thing of it is as the
[1:00:48] enemy has added this and added that a
[1:00:50] man something that it to make it more
[1:00:52] fault more take the power away from it
[1:00:55] to take the anointing away from amen so
[1:00:58] they're control brother they were no
[1:01:00] longer under God's control
[1:01:01] they came more and more under Satan's
[1:01:03] control amen and under the control of
[1:01:06] main sissie
[1:01:09] it's and well the devil did don't use
[1:01:13] man yes he did
[1:01:14] it wasn't the devil just coming down to
[1:01:16] Eve no no mother sister what are you he
[1:01:20] went he used the serpent and the serpent
[1:01:23] was was that was the brook was the link
[1:01:25] between between the man and
[1:01:28] and the beast that's right this way why
[1:01:31] scientists don't understand about
[1:01:33] creation why because they can't they
[1:01:36] don't they don't recognize the missing
[1:01:37] link well they think oh well you know
[1:01:40] man started here and he went on and on
[1:01:42] and on but they don't have the missing
[1:01:43] link between man and beast it's not as
[1:01:46] now it wasn't Adam no it was the serpent
[1:01:49] and he and the prophet of God has
[1:01:52] highlighted the fact he says the serpent
[1:01:54] was an upright creature like a man hey
[1:01:56] man that's right and that's that's who
[1:01:58] the serpent as who the devil was using
[1:02:00] to deceive Eve a man and again as where
[1:02:05] we have been a lie we have been given
[1:02:08] the understanding that it was so close
[1:02:10] to man that his seed would mingle with
[1:02:14] the woman hey man that's right so
[1:02:17] brother sister what the enemy was doing
[1:02:18] there now the enemy is doing here then
[1:02:22] what the enemy was doing there the enemy
[1:02:23] was doing down in this hour and this H
[1:02:25] in the a in the last day a man he was
[1:02:28] endeavoring to deceive man then and he's
[1:02:31] endeavoring to deceive man no a man and
[1:02:34] brother not coming with oh well no it's
[1:02:37] all false all false no it'll be 99%
[1:02:41] truth or sometimes it'll be a hundred
[1:02:45] percent truth plus a little false 101
[1:02:49] percent amen because they'll add to it
[1:02:52] or take away brother no wonder that God
[1:02:55] said in in the beginning in the end in
[1:02:57] the last oh yeah in in the in Revelation
[1:03:00] chapter 22 and concerning I testify unto
[1:03:03] every man that heareth the words of the
[1:03:05] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[1:03:07] add unto these things God shall add unto
[1:03:11] Him the plagues that are written in this
[1:03:13] book
[1:03:13] a man they've added to the word and
[1:03:16] brother this is why we're seeing what
[1:03:18] we're seeing happening in the earth yeah
[1:03:20] and he said if any man shall take away
[1:03:23] from the words of the book of this
[1:03:25] prophecy God shall take away his part
[1:03:27] out of the book of life and out of the

[1:07:41] generation that age amen

[1:07:52] friends of the bride by the grace of God
[1:07:55] but brother this come under let's meet
[1:07:58] come under stay under God's influence
[1:08:00] elohim's influence but not the influence
[1:08:03] of the god of the
[1:08:04] evil age a man but yet he's influencing
[1:08:08] a lot of so-called believers a man to
[1:08:12] compromise here compromise there with
[1:08:15] the truth with the message a man oh yeah
[1:08:18] see listen God God God brought this is
[1:08:21] why God did what he did down through the
[1:08:22] church ages
[1:08:23] he brought us out of this and what what
[1:08:26] brought them out it was a greater
[1:08:28] revelation amen brother
[1:08:32] because the enemy came in and they and
[1:08:35] made a mini denomination out of it but
[1:08:37] then God came down with a greater
[1:08:39] revelation and the anointing of the Holy
[1:08:40] Ghost
[1:08:41] hello they came out oh yeah and they
[1:08:44] went on with God they made a
[1:08:46] denomination of it and and then yeah and
[1:08:49] the anointing was God so oh so God came
[1:08:52] back again in another revival in another
[1:08:54] age a man with a greater revelation and
[1:08:57] they came out again the elect a mout a
[1:08:59] man the elect the others were still
[1:09:02] religious and they stayed there oh yeah
[1:09:05] they condemned they can end the ones
[1:09:07] that that separated they can name the
[1:09:09] ones that walked out and felt though
[1:09:11] they did they had a greater revelation
[1:09:13] and God they were following God's
[1:09:15] leadership a million so brother comes
[1:09:17] right on down through the last age until
[1:09:20] finally we Christ is put out you know
[1:09:23] that in the last church age he was put
[1:09:26] out and then he was calling for his
[1:09:28] elect always said you think you're this
[1:09:31] you think you're that the church he said
[1:09:34] but you're rich and increased with Goods
[1:09:35] and have need of nothing and he said and
[1:09:37] you're miserable Richard blowing poor
[1:09:39] naked oh yeah they thought this he said
[1:09:42] but this is the truth
[1:09:43] and so he begin to begin the knock and
[1:09:46] call for the right a man he said to come
[1:09:50] unto me praise the name of the Lord to
[1:09:53] call us out but brother
[1:09:55] we're not going on like God called about
[1:09:58] in one age they went on to another age
[1:10:00] went on to another age but he's called
[1:10:02] the bride out and she's going on to
[1:10:04] Eternity amen we're going on to the
[1:10:07] resurrection we're going on to the
[1:10:08] rapture by the grace of Almighty God

[1:10:19] deceived by the god of this evil age and
[1:10:21] there were not under the influence of
[1:10:23] the god of the sea village yeah what
[1:10:26] what is the interval as the results of
[1:10:28] that influence compromise yeah
[1:10:32] compromise he's not gonna cut sake oh

[1:10:44] they'd gonna cut they're gonna eat gonna
[1:10:47] influence them to compromise on the
[1:10:49] world hey man he's gonna get him away
[1:10:52] from the from the anointing of the word
[1:10:54] just to just to the intellectual
[1:10:57] knowledge of the word and I brought that
[1:10:58] out the Prophet brought it out even in
[1:11:00] this message he said we are get your
[1:11:02] moving to your going he said with the
[1:11:04] you with the knowledge of the message
[1:11:06] the message he said you're in the
[1:11:07] message but the message is not in you
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:11] what brought you to the message it was
[1:11:12] intellectual knowledge like you got the
[1:11:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:11:17] Ghost revelation of the word the message
[1:11:19] is in you amen and the life you live is
[1:11:22] the word the life you live is Jesus oh

[1:11:27] challenge to our faith mine am i living
[1:11:30] the life of Jesus amen
[1:11:33] I'm I'm I'm reflecting Jesus not talking
[1:11:37] about him but living him a man living
[1:11:41] his life so that he's living his life in
[1:11:43] you he's living his life in me and
[1:11:45] brothers your attitude in your spirit is
[1:11:47] Jesus attitude it is this is tremendous
[1:11:50] it is a challenge to the faith of the
[1:11:53] bride in the end time listen if God is
[1:11:55] looking for any faith in this hour and
[1:11:58] this age he's looking for a perfect
[1:11:59] faith amen
[1:12:02] well brother Luther had faith and the
[1:12:04] measure that he had that was perfect
[1:12:06] yeah but yet there was there was a
[1:12:08] greater revelation that would take us on
[1:12:10] to the resurrection and rapture but
[1:12:12] Luther brother it took him on to believe
[1:12:15] Alleluia
[1:12:17] that if he died he'd rise again but not
[1:12:20] the rapture and so on all down through
[1:12:22] the ages all down through the ages what
[1:12:24] God gave them gave the faith to lay down
[1:12:26] their lives knowing that they're gonna
[1:12:28] pick it up again
[1:12:31] because what they're gonna lay down
[1:12:32] their lives in Christ a man and really
[1:12:35] they're not they're not dead but it
[1:12:37] comes to say that they don't know
[1:12:39] anything if you dip they lay down their
[1:12:41] the dead in Christ rather I'll tell you
[1:12:44] this said god help us to have
[1:12:47] understanding the dead in Christ whether
[1:12:50] they're very conscious of another
[1:12:51] dimension oh yeah they are when it comes
[1:12:54] to dead or dead and what are physically
[1:12:56] as to the people of the world and those
[1:12:59] that they live with
[1:12:59] oh they're dead yeah they died in Christ
[1:13:02] yeah and and ER and they're gone on into
[1:13:04] a theophany body by the grace of God
[1:13:07] their physical bodies are gone their
[1:13:09] physical bodies are dead but I tell you
[1:13:11] that the spiritual is still much life
[1:13:14] yeah it's like I said where did Moses in
[1:13:17] there and a and a and Elijah come from
[1:13:20] those that Jesus saw and though and the
[1:13:23] Old Testament Saints they arose they
[1:13:25] come back because the power of God said
[1:13:27] they were down there in the place called
[1:13:28] Paradise and and he said Jesus wouldn't
[1:13:31] went down there and he just rebuked the
[1:13:34] others that didn't believe but then he
[1:13:36] went over he said open the door ISA for
[1:13:38] the old Saints to come out come on
[1:13:40] yeah well oh yeah I'm the one that Moses
[1:13:44] talked about I'm the one that the no one
[1:13:46] was preaching about I know I'm that that
[1:13:48] it does a not believed a man and brother
[1:13:51] they came they came up with Jesus and
[1:13:53] they went into the city it appeared on
[1:13:55] too many by the grace of Almighty God
[1:13:57] God Elba's that were under God's
[1:14:00] influence amai and the god of the word
[1:14:02] the god of glory not the god of this
[1:14:05] evil age yeah

[1:14:20] again another quote where he said if
[1:14:22] there there might be 800 there might be
[1:14:24] 500 what living Saints that'll be
[1:14:27] changed and going to rapture another
[1:14:29] time he said it might be a dozen why
[1:14:32] because he was seeing less and less and
[1:14:34] less who were staying his
[1:14:37] less and less that had become one with
[1:14:40] the word they were just religious and
[1:14:43] lucky like I said he preached into his
[1:14:45] own church even they say yes even this
[1:14:49] dis message under God of this evil age

[1:14:59] oh yeah he just he was pretty gist but
[1:15:01] filling filling this fill in that but
[1:15:05] there's there's some things he wouldn't
[1:15:07] preach but when he got him on believers

[1:19:27] chapter 1 Galatians chapter 1 and
[1:19:33] reading verse 1 Paul an apostle not of
[1:19:39] men neither by man but by Jesus Christ
[1:19:44] and there are believers who are of man
[1:19:48] that's right and they're by man but by
[1:19:54] the grace of God we are to be believers
[1:19:56] by jesus christ and god the father who
[1:20:00] raised him from the dead
[1:20:02] a man so we're here not because of this
[1:20:05] the influence of man but it's the
[1:20:08] influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] a man I'd not follow a man by following
[1:20:13] Jesus yes that's right sister oh it's a
[1:20:17] trace of challenge to our faith are we

[1:20:46] what we's what is it you saw God in that
[1:20:50] brother you saw God in in this one or
[1:20:52] that one
[1:20:53] amen and you were following not the
[1:20:55] person
[1:20:56] no you're following the word that they
[1:21:00] were testifying up by the grace of God
[1:21:02] hallelujah and he said in all the
[1:21:07] brethren which are with me on to the
[1:21:09] churches of Galatia grace be to you and
[1:21:13] peace from God the Father and from
[1:21:15] our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself
[1:21:18] for our sins a man that he might deliver
[1:21:23] us from this present evil world praise
[1:21:27] the Lord
[1:21:28] according to the will of God and our
[1:21:31] Father a man to whom be glory for ever
[1:21:36] and ever amen
[1:21:38] and he said I marble a man he would say
[1:21:42] the same today and he said I marvel that
[1:21:45] ye are so soon removed from him that
[1:21:50] called you into the grace of Christ unto
[1:21:53] another gospel just think I marvel that
[1:21:58] ye are so soon removed from him that
[1:22:01] called you into the grace of Christ unto
[1:22:04] another gospel which is not another but
[1:22:07] there's be some that trouble you and
[1:22:10] would pervert the gospel of Christ and
[1:22:13] there are many that are perverting the
[1:22:16] message of the hour that's right now I
[1:22:19] tell you what they came out of they've
[1:22:22] gone back into a denominational spirit
[1:22:25] oh yeah and again it was many years ago
[1:22:29] that I heard our brother Bisco when I
[1:22:34] was in Alberta and the Convention and
[1:22:36] our brother Bisco preached the the last
[1:22:38] message of the convention and he said
[1:22:41] it's amazing but he said we have to
[1:22:43] acknowledge the truth he said what we
[1:22:45] came out of he said now we're dealing
[1:22:47] with the same spirits again even Easter
[1:22:50] denominational spirits he said among the
[1:22:53] people denominational spirits among
[1:22:55] believers a man brother what we came out
[1:22:58] of he said we are dealing with him and
[1:23:01] those spirits again and this the enemy
[1:23:03] is the god of this evil age it's his
[1:23:07] influence please if we see the brother
[1:23:11] do this or sister do that
[1:23:13] all mine are they believers well no they
[1:23:16] profess to be but they're under Satan's
[1:23:18] influence and that's why they're not
[1:23:21] living the life of a believer but the
[1:23:23] life of an unbeliever that is the truth
[1:23:26] what do around the message like that
[1:23:28] around
[1:23:29] they'd be on our guard
[1:23:32] hey Miriam grace and he said buddies he
[1:23:39] see they were dealing with it then
[1:23:41] and that's why before Paul left the
[1:23:43] scene he warned us over and over and
[1:23:45] over again about false apostles false
[1:23:48] prophets
[1:23:49] Paul says Paul said that would come to
[1:23:52] deceive the people and that would be
[1:23:55] Satan's influence amen brother as he
[1:23:57] came in the Garden of Eden a man for the
[1:24:00] six thousand years ago so at the
[1:24:03] beginning of the church ages Satan was
[1:24:06] on the scene a man to deceive and the
[1:24:09] brother there was to reduce to spirits
[1:24:12] back back here in the beginning even in
[1:24:16] the Ephesian age and brother doors were
[1:24:19] dealing with those same spirits that's
[1:24:20] why it's getting smaller and smaller and
[1:24:22] smaller
[1:24:22] a man for years believers believers put
[1:24:27] their less unless unless unless a man
[1:24:30] why because Satan is getting more and
[1:24:33] more influence down through the ages god
[1:24:36] help us a man that we come out this day
[1:24:40] out with brother what we follow come out
[1:24:44] for the word Christ in the word the
[1:24:49] truth it was giving us faith a man for
[1:24:52] the resurrection faith for the rapture
[1:24:54] brother the fate brought us out but God
[1:24:57] continues to add to that faith a man so
[1:25:00] he can do what he wants to do through
[1:25:02] you see God gave God gave them faith so
[1:25:06] that it's a lot so that he could do what
[1:25:08] he wanted to do in that age and in this
[1:25:09] age that are not true and we know that
[1:25:11] there was a dark ages and God said I
[1:25:14] will restore saith the Lord and he got
[1:25:16] he came in gave them the faith that
[1:25:18] Luther hit and it took him on to Wesley
[1:25:20] and and the puppet of God said after
[1:25:22] Wesley it's like I did I saw that before
[1:25:25] I asked an elderly brother concerning
[1:25:28] William Booth in the Salvation Army and
[1:25:30] what part that they played in the church
[1:25:32] ages and he didn't have a clue
[1:25:35] he said I have no idea I had no idea I
[1:25:38] said haven't you heard the message yeah
[1:25:41] message I've never heard nothing but
[1:25:42] that but it did it's there because the
[1:25:45] Potter God said that he said in Luther's
[1:25:47] age and brought them a little brother
[1:25:50] Luther's age into the Westeros age and
[1:25:52] he's within weather with the revelation
[1:25:54] that God had ordained for Wesley of
[1:25:57] sanctification and he said but he said
[1:26:00] the Methodist Issa door deigned and be
[1:26:02] denominated so quickly
[1:26:04] he said that God had to raise up William
[1:26:07] Booth he said with red-hot salvation he
[1:26:11] said what for and he should be said to
[1:26:13] take it on to the Pentecostal revival a
[1:26:16] man and brother as I said I got I got
[1:26:19] the messages and sermons in writing a
[1:26:22] William Booth and even his wife I think
[1:26:25] her name was Catherine and brother I
[1:26:27] turned it is nearing the end of her
[1:26:29] their ministry they were pointing the
[1:26:32] people to Calvary took it to Pentecost
[1:26:34] near the end of their ministry they were
[1:26:37] pointing the people to the day of
[1:26:39] Pentecost and oh yeah they were
[1:26:41] preaching they said listen they said
[1:26:43] what they add on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:45] that's what we need today they were
[1:26:47] preaching that in the army they were
[1:26:49] breaching it oh yeah and what fourth is
[1:26:52] exactly if the prophecy God raised him
[1:26:54] up to take it on to the Pentecostal
[1:26:57] revival a man and brother where are we
[1:27:00] going now where are we going now
[1:27:04] Brooklyn not it's Betty Goss is over
[1:27:07] with that's done the gifts are here the
[1:27:10] prodigal sir there's just on the Shelf

[1:27:41] faith this faith this faith anybody the
[1:27:44] Pentecostal faith of the Pentecostal
[1:27:45] revival and now he's given us the faith
[1:27:48] of the bride revival and it's perfect
[1:27:51] date
[1:27:53] because the prophet of God preached
[1:27:55] perfect faith yeah it might have been
[1:28:00] just before you preached this or right
[1:28:02] after he preached this perfect faith
[1:28:05] amen and he also emphasized that the
[1:28:08] opening of the mystery of God the seven
[1:28:10] seals is giving us perfect faith rats
[1:28:13] repay ya oh it gave Luther the faith of
[1:28:18] justification and Wesley the faith of
[1:28:20] sanctification and again the Pentecost
[1:28:22] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:24] the gifts of the Spirit but we got
[1:28:26] beyond it now why I witnessed that I was
[1:28:32] part of that the end of it the
[1:28:35] Pentecostal revival the baptism of the
[1:28:37] Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen

[1:28:48] me to the bride revival yeah oh yeah I
[1:28:53] was praising God for the Pentecostal
[1:28:54] revival I was praising God for the gifts
[1:28:57] of the Spirit I was praising God for the
[1:28:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and as I
[1:29:02] said I can tell you right now because I
[1:29:03] can see it right now when I I felt that
[1:29:06] God filled me with the Holy Ghost he
[1:29:08] baptized him with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:29:10] it was in that house that we were living
[1:29:11] in on amyl Street a man and I and I
[1:29:15] could go if that houses would not change
[1:29:16] the inside I could go right to the room

[1:30:32] man as I said I was rebaptised in the
[1:30:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in July of
[1:30:37] level was of 1966 thank God

[1:30:55] hills and neither do i hey man
[1:30:59] thank the Lord so brother let's stay
[1:31:01] with the word God in and God revealed
[1:31:04] it's in simplicity amen so the Lord
[1:31:08] Alba's rather that were not to be too
[1:31:10] saved by the god of this evil age
[1:31:13] because he's going to be so deceiving as
[1:31:16] the Bible says so it's gonna be so bad
[1:31:19] it would deceive the very elect
[1:31:20] impossible that is that serious deceive
[1:31:25] the elect that are still even the word
[1:31:29] believe in this believe in that
[1:31:31] yeah but he's gonna come and preach this
[1:31:33] and preach this and all y'all is it's
[1:31:36] gonna be 99% truth or a hundred percent
[1:31:38] and 101 so on percent true amen and yea
[1:31:42] and many a believers going to follow
[1:31:43] this preacher that preacher this apostle
[1:31:46] that a pasta oh yeah this evangelist
[1:31:48] that avenges well you have to be careful
[1:31:50] as I said when you go online and you
[1:31:52] listen to preachers be careful oh no
[1:31:57] he's a good preacher
[1:31:58] is he the devil is a good preacher oh
[1:32:03] yeah we mean he's good well he's so good
[1:32:07] a preacher he's influenced a lot over
[1:32:09] the ages oh yeah you go right on back to
[1:32:13] the beginning why he preaches the word
[1:32:15] and he have taken from it or he'll add
[1:32:18] to it
[1:32:19] you leave this out and put that in what
[1:32:22] yeah oh yeah we could take it we could
[1:32:26] take an hour another hour and go in and
[1:32:29] ensure you in the scriptures where he's
[1:32:31] done it down through the ages the Old
[1:32:32] Testament the New Testament oh yeah New
[1:32:35] Testament yeah as I said break from the
[1:32:38] first search age they were dealing with
[1:32:40] the devil the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:32:44] and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans
[1:32:47] until it become the Church of the
[1:32:49] Nicolaitans and once Nickelodeon
[1:32:51] conquered the laity conquered the laity
[1:32:56] so the Holy Ghost is not in control he's
[1:32:59] got a spirit yeah a spirit on the odd on
[1:33:05] the minister a spirit of the clergy
[1:33:09] spirit on the serpent that he'd used in
[1:33:11] the Garden of Eden oh yeah
[1:33:13] just somebody for Satan to use and it
[1:33:16] could be a clergy and beyond your guard
[1:33:20] because it could be a deacon oh yeah or
[1:33:23] it could be a brother could be a sister
[1:33:24] so be on your guard make sure you got
[1:33:27] the right anointing by the grace of God
[1:33:30] because Satan is on the move brother to
[1:33:33] deceive the end time and he's gonna he's
[1:33:36] going to have such success that as Jesus
[1:33:39] said that he would deceive the very
[1:33:41] elect if possible as serious deceived
[1:33:46] the elect
[1:33:46] that's how it's so close it's going to
[1:33:48] be to the real so let's be on our guard
[1:33:52] and I'd say I brother turn to this
[1:33:53] sisters if there's anything what is it
[1:33:56] it's humility be humble but now the
[1:34:00] prophet of God also I lighted that - he
[1:34:03] said no so you could be too humble but I
[1:34:07] was amazed I said what yes he said you
[1:34:12] could be too humble so as you've got to
[1:34:15] have a Holy Ghost humility a man not
[1:34:19] religious humility Holy Ghost humility
[1:34:21] because religious humility thinks you
[1:34:23] could you your omble yourself so you
[1:34:25] compromise with this humble yourself
[1:34:27] compromise of that no indeed but it is a
[1:34:31] Holy Ghost ability you
[1:34:32] got a compromise a man your humble
[1:34:35] yourself you're there to help you're
[1:34:38] there to be a blessing
[1:34:39] you're there to encourage a man you're
[1:34:41] there to strengthen but you're not there
[1:34:43] to compromised by the grace of God amen
[1:34:49] so brother as Paul is warning again here
[1:34:52] to Galatians concerning deception and he
[1:34:58] said they're going to remove I marvel
[1:35:00] that ye are so soon removed from him
[1:35:02] that called you into the grace of Christ
[1:35:05] unto another gospel a man Satan the
[1:35:10] deeds of the Nicolaitans influencing the
[1:35:13] Galatians he said which is not another
[1:35:16] but there be some that trouble you which
[1:35:19] would pervert the gospel of Christ
[1:35:21] that's right amen but he said though
[1:35:26] though we or an angel from heaven preach
[1:35:29] any other gospel unto you than that
[1:35:31] which we have preached is it unto you
[1:35:33] let him be accursed
[1:35:40] keep your attitude right keep your
[1:35:42] spirit right
[1:35:43] if you rebuke them and rebuke what their
[1:35:47] preaching and teaching you want to do it
[1:35:49] with the right attitude and a right
[1:35:50] spirit yeah as we said before so say I
[1:35:56] now again if any man preach any other
[1:35:59] gospel unto you than that way every
[1:36:01] received let him be accursed again the
[1:36:06] second time let him be accursed
[1:36:09] god help us amen
[1:36:13] sorry I've taken so long turn with me I
[1:36:20] may have to finish with this we wouldn't
[1:36:22] have time to go into it there's three
[1:36:24] scriptures that I want to read and we
[1:36:27] wouldn't get into all of them or the or
[1:36:29] the quotes of the Prophet but we will
[1:36:31] try to get a couple of quotes but turn
[1:36:35] with me to Revelation 13
[1:36:44] revelation 13 and beginning to read at
[1:36:56] verse 1 it's serious if the god of this
[1:37:07] evil age comes down to this place of
[1:37:09] judgment I stood upon the sand of the
[1:37:15] sea and saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:37:19] sea having seven heads and ten horns and
[1:37:22] upon his horns ten crowns and upon his
[1:37:26] horse
[1:37:27] yea upon his heads the name of blasphemy
[1:37:30] oh my they would think that it was
[1:37:34] Christ seven seven heads ten horns ten
[1:37:40] crowns but upon his heads the name of
[1:37:45] blasphemy amen
[1:37:48] and the Beast which I saw was like unto
[1:37:51] a leopard and his feet were as the feet
[1:37:54] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of
[1:37:58] the lion you know and the dragon gave
[1:38:02] him his power yeah and his seat and
[1:38:07] great Authority and I saw one of his
[1:38:10] heads as it were wounded to death and
[1:38:13] his deadly wound was healed and all the
[1:38:16] world wondered after the Beast and they
[1:38:21] worshipped the Dragon which gave power
[1:38:24] unto the Beast oh yeah it's the devil as
[1:38:31] the prophet of God said he's being
[1:38:32] worshipped by millions and billions yeah
[1:38:35] they're worshipping the devil and don't
[1:38:36] know it
[1:38:37] they think they're worshiping Jehovah
[1:38:39] but they're not and they worship the
[1:38:43] Dragon which gave power unto the Beast
[1:38:46] and they worshipped the Beast saying who
[1:38:50] is like unto the Beast who is a
[1:38:53] to make war with him and there was given
[1:38:55] unto him a mouth speaking great things
[1:38:57] and blasphemies yeah but they never
[1:39:01] recognized it as blessed for me and
[1:39:04] power was given unto him to continue
[1:39:07] forty and two months or three and a half
[1:39:10] years through the Great Tribulation yeah
[1:39:13] as I said the world's coming to a place
[1:39:16] where they're gonna turn everything over
[1:39:17] to the Antichrist
[1:39:18] it was under the control of the dragon
[1:39:22] they meant the beasts powers and he
[1:39:26] opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[1:39:29] God to blaspheme his name amen
[1:39:35] we're putting the emphasis on the name
[1:39:38] but brother he was during 300 AD
[1:39:42] when the days when the Nicolaitans
[1:39:44] became organized as the denomination oh
[1:39:48] yeah
[1:39:49] controlling the laity absolutely they
[1:39:52] changed water baptism from the Lord
[1:39:55] Jesus Christ to Father Son and Holy
[1:39:57] Ghost that's when they start bap started
[1:40:00] baptizing in the name of the Father and
[1:40:03] of the Son and of the Holy Ghost they
[1:40:05] didn't use the name that's when they
[1:40:08] started title baptism amen
[1:40:12] they thank God he brought a wreck a
[1:40:15] restoration of the revelation of the
[1:40:18] name amen praise the Lord
[1:40:23] verse 6 again he opened his mouth and
[1:40:26] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[1:40:28] name and his tabernacle and then that
[1:40:32] dwell in heaven praise the Lord and it
[1:40:36] was given unto him to make war with the
[1:40:38] Saints yeah the Dark Ages yeah
[1:40:43] 68 million laid down their lives they
[1:40:49] took their stand against the Beast yeah
[1:40:55] and dad and they were sacrifices one
[1:40:58] after the other laid down their lives
[1:41:00] they took their stand against that
[1:41:02] organized religion that first
[1:41:04] denomination
[1:41:05] oh yeah many find that hard to believe
[1:41:10] what sixty-eight million 68 million
[1:41:15] Christians and again to remind you of
[1:41:21] the it was a sister that they were going
[1:41:24] to they were going to kill her to her
[1:41:25] daughter and they said if you don't
[1:41:30] repent if you don't you know say I'm not

[1:46:36] grace brother sister that our thoughts
[1:46:39] our words and our deeds are under the
[1:46:41] influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:43] not the hon Holy Ghost remembering again
[1:46:47] let me remind you that the prophet of
[1:46:50] God has warned us that Christ and
[1:46:53] Antichrist are twins in the same church
[1:46:57] and when I say the same church I'm not
[1:47:00] referring to the same assembly I'm
[1:47:02] afraid to the whole church around the
[1:47:05] world
[1:47:06] a man so they are twins in the same
[1:47:09] church Christ is in his church and the
[1:47:11] devil is there well you know why would
[1:47:15] Christ allow this allow that oh it's all
[1:47:17] for a reason he knows that his seed
[1:47:19] won't be deceived I won't be to see if
[1:47:23] you want me to see if you're the seed of
[1:47:25] God yeah God allows it to bring the
[1:47:29] separation by the grace of God
[1:47:33] the Bible says the god of this world and
[1:47:38] this is second Corinthians chapter four
[1:47:42] I believe and it says for the god of
[1:47:45] this world has blinded the unbelievers
[1:47:48] minds this is the amplified bible that
[1:47:52] they should not discern the truth
[1:47:55] preventing them from seeing the
[1:47:57] illuminating light of the gospel of the
[1:47:59] glory of Christ amen the Messiah who is
[1:48:03] the image and likeness of God a man but
[1:48:08] the god of this world is blinding them
[1:48:10] to the true revelation of God amen so
[1:48:14] that they worship the devil
[1:48:16] thinking they're worshiping God grace to
[1:48:19] us brother that the God of Abraham Isaac
[1:48:23] and Jacob is the God we serve is the God
[1:48:27] we worship not the devil the god of this
[1:48:31] evil age taking control of the world
[1:48:34] taking control of the church grace to
[1:48:37] his brother grace oh well well brother I
[1:48:42] don't have to worry I'm not going to be
[1:48:44] to see wait a minute and I remind you
[1:48:46] again so closer to seed the very linked
[1:48:50] that's the influence the power of the
[1:48:53] influence of the Antichrist it's
[1:48:55] powerful so brother we stand by the
[1:48:59] grace of God or the grace of God that
[1:49:02] prevents us from being deceived
[1:49:04] let's stay humble a man in the presence
[1:49:09] of God probably God said in the message
[1:49:14] he said jesus said as it was in the days
[1:49:18] of Noah wherein eight souls were saved
[1:49:21] so shall it be at the coming of the Son
[1:49:24] of man in the days of lot where three
[1:49:27] were brought out of Sodom and now he
[1:49:29] said there's already a group already out
[1:49:33] remember but as it was then when the Son
[1:49:37] of Man will be manifested now Luke he
[1:49:39] said hard look where we are living now
[1:49:43] as it was so shall it be
[1:49:47] as it was then that's the spirit
[1:49:51] atmosphere that we're living in now it's
[1:49:54] that's what we're dealing with that
[1:49:57] deception let's be on our guard that
[1:50:00] will not be deceived amen
[1:50:04] I'll let believe the risk he said Satan
[1:50:09] the god of this age by his knowledge is
[1:50:13] giving the people to eat from his mixed
[1:50:16] tree of good and evil amen he is Satan
[1:50:22] by his knowledge causing the people of
[1:50:25] this evil age to eat from his tree of
[1:50:28] good and evil and he says that he is
[1:50:30] building a greater Christian
[1:50:32] civilization by his knowledge a greater
[1:50:36] Christian civilization but Christ little
[1:50:39] virgin word bride don't care for his
[1:50:43] knowledge
[1:50:44] she keeps free of him a man she's not
[1:50:48] going under the devil's knowledge she's
[1:50:51] going under the word the revealed Word
[1:50:55] of God amen of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:58] he said knowledge and civilization and
[1:51:01] true Christianity he says nothing in
[1:51:05] common people go with the intellectual
[1:51:08] knowledge of the message but with the
[1:51:10] spiritual revelation he said
[1:51:16] civilization is by knowledge a man so
[1:51:21] the grace of God be with us brother that
[1:51:24] were were in the revelation of the word
[1:51:27] by the Holy Ghost brother not just the
[1:51:29] knowledge of it by the devil see he's
[1:51:34] intellectual many got intellectual
[1:51:38] revelation of the mess and electrolyte
[1:51:39] thoughts of the message and with actual
[1:51:41] knowledge of the message but the bride
[1:51:43] got spiritual revelation amen
[1:51:46] by the grace of God so don't depend on
[1:51:48] it intellectually in your head let it be
[1:51:51] in your heart
[1:51:52] amen by the grace of God revealing
[1:51:55] Christ in you by Grace will either leave
[1:51:58] that and the there's a couple other
[1:52:00] scriptures
