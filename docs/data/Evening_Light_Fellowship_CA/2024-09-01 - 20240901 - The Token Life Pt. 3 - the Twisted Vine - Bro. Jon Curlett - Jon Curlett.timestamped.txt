[41:39] Father Lord that's certainly our prayer
[41:42] this
[41:44] morning Lord that as in the beginning
[41:46] Lord your spirit hovered over the Earth
[41:48] Lord and it created an atmosphere for
[41:51] Life Lord so it would do the very same
[41:54] same thing over us Heavenly Father Lord
[41:57] not that your spirit would just hover
[41:59] over us Lord but that it would be inside
[42:00] of us Lord that it would fill us and
[42:02] refill us day by day Lord even to an
[42:05] overflowing Lord that it would produce
[42:07] the very life that you placed inside of
[42:09] us Lord and that life would take
[42:11] dominion over everything else that comes
[42:13] against us Lord that which is within us
[42:15] that which is without us Heavenly Father
[42:17] Lord that your spirit would raise up a
[42:19] standard Lord that's anchored in the
[42:21] word Lord that it would produce a Faith
[42:23] Lord that helps us to believe and accept
[42:25] Lord and in those things to receive Lord
[42:27] what you promised us Lord I pray you
[42:30] Quicken our faith Lord help us to look
[42:32] to you and only to you Lord you are our
[42:35] savior you're Our Redeemer Lord You're
[42:37] our healer our provider Lord our guide
[42:40] Our Shepherd Lord may we recognize every
[42:43] day Lord where our help comes from Lord
[42:46] speak to your people now we ask in Jesus
[42:48] Christ's name we ask it amen amen God
[42:52] bless you turn if you would to Genesis
[42:53] chapter
[42:55] 5 I'm sorry if I look angry this morning
[42:58] I've got another eye infection and seems
[43:00] like it's about to kind of move towards
[43:03] lessening rather than worsening but uh I
[43:06] I look a little mean this morning I know
[43:08] I startled myself when I looked in the
[43:10] mirror so anyways I I'm not preaching an
[43:13] angry service this morning so hopefully
[43:14] we'll be okay with it but just I do
[43:16] crave your prayers I've got to travel
[43:18] next week I'll be leaving on Sunday
[43:20] after noon after I preach in the morning
[43:22] for Montreal for work and then from
[43:24] there I'm flying to Edmonton I'll preach
[43:26] two services for brother Ed
[43:27] hammermeister while I'm there so I'm
[43:29] prepping for that this week prepping for
[43:31] work and then I'll spend some time with
[43:33] my dad and mom and some of the other
[43:35] believers there and whatnot so just pray
[43:37] that God will be with me in the meantime
[43:40] brother Mark will take the Wednesday
[43:41] service after I leave brother Carmen
[43:43] Mills from New Brunswick will take the
[43:44] Sunday brother Paul will take the
[43:46] Wednesday after that and then brother
[43:48] Max Bang from Edmonton will take the
[43:50] Sunday after that so we have speakers
[43:52] for all four Services amen and we thank
[43:54] the Lord for that amen trusting you'll
[43:57] you'll enjoy them we also want to
[43:58] remember the kids as they head back to
[44:00] school this week now many of us are
[44:02] still work schooling from home some are
[44:03] going back to schools and we just want
[44:05] the Lord to be with them amen that he
[44:07] would make them a witness that like
[44:09] Daniel they would stand tall that they
[44:11] would push back and in the areas where
[44:12] Satan would try and get in and that they
[44:14] be a witness and testimony not just to
[44:16] the children but to the teachers as well
[44:18] amen God bless you each one amen let's
[44:22] uh let's read from Genesis 5 and verse 1
[44:25] says this is the book of the gener
[44:27] generations of Adam in the day that God
[44:29] created man in the likeness of God made
[44:32] he him male and female created he them
[44:35] and blessed them and called their name
[44:37] Adam in the day when they were created
[44:41] amen God bless you you can have your
[44:42] seats and we're continuing our series on
[44:44] the Holy Ghost again the token life I
[44:46] want to take a title this morning of the
[44:48] Twisted Vine and we started this series
[44:51] uh and I spoke to services on the
[44:53] original sin and I trust we've got that
[44:55] clearly settled in scripture you know
[44:56] talking with some people yesterday I
[44:58] said that's a generational set of
[45:00] services you don't preach it all the
[45:01] time we don't need to do it but when
[45:03] we're talking about the Holy Ghost I
[45:06] know it seems an odd way to start a
[45:07] service on the Holy Ghost and we start
[45:08] talking about the original sin but if we
[45:10] don't understand why we need the holy
[45:12] ghost in the first place then we often
[45:13] won't understand what the Holy Ghost has
[45:15] given for and on that basis we don't
[45:17] understand what the Holy Ghost is
[45:18] supposed to do and so people come up
[45:20] with all these ideas of what the Holy
[45:21] Ghost is and what the proof of it is but
[45:24] if we see where we lost our nature where
[45:26] we see where we lost our original uh you
[45:29] know uh inheritance and these things
[45:31] then we'll see the Holy Ghost is
[45:32] supposed to bring us back to that and I
[45:34] started with this scripture in Genesis 5
[45:36] and this is after Adam and Eve have been
[45:38] driven out of the garden after Cain has
[45:40] killed Abel and and now the world is
[45:42] moving forward and even though they're
[45:44] not able to approach God anymore yet
[45:45] they're pressing forward God is looking
[45:48] God's nowhere in their midst amen they
[45:50] can't go to the tree of life anymore and
[45:52] if you look at we we started in Genesis
[45:53] 51 but if you go to Genesis 4 and the
[45:56] last scripture it says in the very last
[45:58] verse of Genesis 4 it says that men
[46:01] began to call on the name of the Lord in
[46:04] other words men began to seek God
[46:06] because something in them was
[46:07] unfulfilled something in them was
[46:09] longing something in them was yearning
[46:11] Adam and Eve would have had the reality
[46:12] of what that felt like they knew what it
[46:14] meant to be in the presence of God but
[46:16] now as they have children and those
[46:18] children have children and whatnot
[46:19] there's a longing inside of these of
[46:21] these these men and these women these
[46:23] young people whatever it might be and
[46:25] there's something unfulfilled and so
[46:27] they're starting to cry out to God
[46:28] because they realize there's something
[46:30] missing in their life they don't have it
[46:32] they don't know what it looks like
[46:33] except Adam and Eve but they know that
[46:35] there's something there and they're
[46:36] crying out for it amen and the problem
[46:38] is and the prophet covers this
[46:39] extensively if we don't find what we're
[46:41] looking for then what does Satan do he
[46:43] tries to fill that hole with something
[46:45] else amen and there's a holy thirst
[46:48] there's an eternal thirst for the child
[46:49] of God and if we don't satisfy it
[46:51] properly it shifts to the Natural it
[46:53] shifts shifts to the Earthly it shifts
[46:55] to the intellectual it shifts to
[46:57] religion rather than Christ it'll shift
[46:59] to the pleasures and the the enjoyments
[47:01] of the world it'll shift to drugs and
[47:03] alcohol sometimes it's sensuality and
[47:06] physical lust whatever it might be but
[47:08] if we can't satisfy that thirst in the
[47:10] way it's meant to be then Satan will
[47:11] take it and he'll manipulate it to make
[47:13] us try and satisfi it another way and
[47:15] that's the way Satan does remember he
[47:17] can't do it himself so he tries and
[47:19] twists and manipulate and make God's
[47:21] things into something that's impure the
[47:23] prophet of God says it this way he says
[47:25] but you'll never be s Saied until you
[47:28] know him but watch how he says this now
[47:30] as the Forgiveness of your sins where
[47:33] the sin question is settled and you have
[47:35] that lovely peaceful quiet Eternal
[47:40] Everlasting fellowship with him see the
[47:44] world will stop right there and say your
[47:45] sins are forgiven you're good to go he
[47:48] says no no no that's not the satisfying
[47:50] of your soul that's the satisfying of
[47:52] the debt but your soul is not satisfied
[47:54] with the debt because it's longing for
[47:56] relationship it's it's it's longing for
[47:58] fellowship and so he says you won't stop
[48:00] until you have Fellowship now with him
[48:02] not just forgiveness of sins he says
[48:04] when the peace of God that passes all
[48:07] understanding has Sanctified your soul
[48:09] and has made you a new creature in
[48:11] Christ Jesus he says joining Church
[48:14] won't do it no sir that's only
[48:16] perverting the real cause now how do you
[48:18] preach that today that joining church is
[48:21] perverting the real cause it's not
[48:22] joining church that perverts it's it's
[48:24] if you are satisfied with joining Church
[48:26] that it perverts the real cause the real
[48:28] thirst there the real hunger he says if
[48:31] the devil can't get you out on those
[48:33] things he'll take you to this other what
[48:35] if he can't get you with the things of
[48:37] the world then he'll take you to a
[48:38] church experience take you to a
[48:40] religious experience and see if you'll
[48:42] be satisfied with that he says but don't
[48:45] settle for nothing less than an
[48:48] oldfashioned experience of the new birth
[48:51] to be go Born Again of the spirit of the
[48:53] Eternal God when your soul and God you
[48:56] unite together and you become one amen
[49:00] that's what we're looking for this
[49:02] morning we're not satisfied with the
[49:03] church experience let me say this way
[49:05] we're not satisfied with a message
[49:06] experience amen it has to be a personal
[49:09] revealing of Christ not only to you but
[49:11] in your life where he changes you from
[49:13] what you used to be to what you were
[49:15] supposed to be and that's a work of the
[49:17] Holy Spirit by the washing of the water
[49:19] of the word amen so if we come back to
[49:22] Genesis 5 and God is doing a recap of
[49:24] kind of what's happened so far and it
[49:26] says this this is the book of the
[49:27] generations of Adam and in the day that
[49:30] God created man in the likeness of God
[49:33] God made he him singular now let me stop
[49:38] and say this okay if Adam is created in
[49:41] the likeness of God how many people did
[49:44] God create on that day Adam is in the
[49:47] perfect image of God and how many people
[49:49] did he create
[49:50] one right there is one Spirit Adam was
[49:54] Spirit first and then God creates a body
[49:57] and puts the spirit into that body and
[49:59] it's an exact and perfect image of God
[50:03] when you see Adam you see God in terms
[50:06] of the likeness okay it amazes me that
[50:09] somebody can preach a trinity and when
[50:11] we look at the first image of God it is
[50:14] a
[50:15] singularity it's only one but we'll see
[50:18] now that it's not one in the way that
[50:20] they preach Oneness either and we'll see
[50:22] it in the very next scripture amen but
[50:24] if you want to preach the Trinity you
[50:26] have to preach from Adam because Adam is
[50:27] in the image of God if God is a trinity
[50:30] then Adam has to be a trinity in the way
[50:32] that God is but we watch what happens
[50:34] now in verse two he says male and female
[50:36] created he them so now there's a
[50:39] separation that's happening there's one
[50:41] body there's one Spirit but out of that
[50:43] one body and spirit he pulls bone of his
[50:46] bone he pulls flesh of his flesh he
[50:48] pulls Spirit of his spirit and what does
[50:51] he produce he produces another portion
[50:54] of what was in Adam already and he
[50:56] manifest ested in a second body so now
[50:58] you have
[50:59] two same flesh Same Spirit same DNA same
[51:04] origin but now it's in two he says he
[51:06] created them male and female and blessed
[51:09] them and called their name Adam in the
[51:14] day when they were created notice called
[51:16] their name Adam we've spoken on this
[51:17] before that Eve had no name until after
[51:20] the fall before that he is man and she
[51:23] is woman and their name is Adam we would
[51:26] say today Mr and Mrs Adam that's what we
[51:28] would say they're exactly the one thing
[51:30] Adam is a Son of God and and and the
[51:33] woman is a daughter of God but they are
[51:35] bone of bone and flesh of his flesh
[51:37] there is no difference between their
[51:39] origin in that sense and what is it
[51:41] showing it's showing God and his family
[51:43] Adam's in the perfect likeness of God so
[51:46] what God is taking out of Adam is no
[51:48] different than what God is going to take
[51:50] out of himself God is showing the family
[51:53] that was in him from before the
[51:54] foundation of the world that there was
[51:56] something in his body there was
[51:57] something in his Spirit there was
[51:59] something that was in him before
[52:01] anything was ever manifested and then
[52:03] what does he do is he pulls out of his
[52:06] own body a bride for
[52:09] himself that's why we can look in the
[52:11] scriptures and we can see that there is
[52:14] more to God than just
[52:16] Oneness because there's not just one
[52:18] Spirit but there's people that are born
[52:20] of that spirit that are inside that that
[52:21] are coming out if you want to look at it
[52:23] today find how many people have the Holy
[52:25] Ghost and that's how many gods you have
[52:27] because that's all a portion of God so
[52:29] it's not a trinity either but neither is
[52:31] it a Oneness like your finger there's
[52:33] something inside of it and out of that
[52:35] Oneness comes manifestations comes
[52:37] bodies comes portions of God that are
[52:39] his thoughts that are his attributes and
[52:42] that's you and I amen so that's the
[52:45] that's just a foreshadow of why we're
[52:47] going to have why we get the Holy Ghost
[52:49] and where it comes from and these
[52:50] different things but the simple fact is
[52:52] if we weren't in him then we can't be in
[52:54] him now amen break what is what is put
[52:58] back into his body is what was brought
[52:59] out of his body in the first place and
[53:01] it's a bride that's bone of his bone and
[53:03] flesh of his flesh you can't be a part
[53:04] of him in the future if you aren't a
[53:06] part of him in the past in the very
[53:08] beginning now Genesis 5 continues the
[53:10] genealogy of Adam for the sake of time
[53:12] this morning we won't read it uh but
[53:14] there is no mention of Cain in the
[53:16] genealogy of Adam it mentions Abel it
[53:18] mentions Seth and it goes on down the
[53:20] line but but uh we see in Genesis 4
[53:24] Cain's genealogy is clearly given and
[53:27] his father is never listed as Adam amen
[53:30] but we see in Kane's genealogy it starts
[53:32] to go through there and we see what kind
[53:33] of people came from his line and we see
[53:36] that the fifth generation is lamech and
[53:38] he is a and he's a
[53:41] murderer you don't see murderers in
[53:43] Adam's side you only see them in Cain's
[53:45] side we see that lamech is a murderer
[53:47] but we see that all of the great skill
[53:49] and all of the great intelligence is
[53:52] found in Cain's line it's not
[53:53] necessarily found in Adam's line they
[53:55] have an elevated understanding of how to
[53:57] take materials and manipulate them and
[53:59] turn them into things that would help
[54:01] them on this Earth and then we come to
[54:02] Genesis 6 and I want to see something as
[54:04] we're speaking this morning on the
[54:06] Twisted Vine because we're talking about
[54:08] the impact of the original sin and how
[54:10] we're why we're so broken and messed up
[54:12] today in these fleshly bodies it says
[54:15] now in Genesis 6 it says it came to pass
[54:17] when man began to multiply on the face
[54:20] of the Earth and daughters were born
[54:21] unto them that the sons of God saw the
[54:25] daughters of men that they were fair and
[54:28] they took them wives of all which they
[54:32] chose so we see here two completely
[54:34] different lineages two completely
[54:35] different Family Lines we have the sons
[54:38] of God and we know who they are we
[54:39] better know who they are because sons of
[54:41] God produce sons of God if you go all
[54:43] the way up to Luke 3:38 it says who was
[54:46] the son of Enoch who was the son of Seth
[54:48] who was the son of Adam which was the
[54:51] son of God so the sons of God in Genesis
[54:54] is the physical line of Adam
[54:57] sons of God produce sons of God Amen
[54:59] because they came from a father who was
[55:01] a Son of God and even in a fallen
[55:04] condition Hallelujah even in a fallen
[55:07] condition they are sons of God I say
[55:09] praise the Lord this morning even in our
[55:11] fallen condition it doesn't change our
[55:14] inheritance it doesn't change who our
[55:16] father is amen but then there's another
[55:18] family line and it's the sons of men and
[55:21] the daughters of men and there's a
[55:23] distinction made in scripture now
[55:24] between these two groups they are not
[55:27] the same family line amen they're
[55:29] different Family Lines Adam and Eve
[55:31] produced Abel who Cain killed and then
[55:33] they produced Seth who Eve said was a
[55:35] replacement for Abel from God and Adam
[55:38] and Eve's family grew from there and
[55:40] they would have sons and daughters alike
[55:43] now the scripture doesn't tell us the
[55:44] daughters that's not the way the
[55:45] scripture traditionally Works they quote
[55:47] Sons most of the time but they would
[55:49] have had daughters but we notice now
[55:51] that Cain was not their child Cain was
[55:54] Eve's child by the serpent we know that
[55:57] we spent two Services going over that
[55:59] Cain is never mentioned as Adam's son
[56:01] he's in no genealogies he that are
[56:04] connected to Adam he has nothing to do
[56:05] with Adam he only has to do with Eve and
[56:08] though we covered this last service the
[56:10] last few Services I want to this is
[56:11] really to me the clinching s uh uh
[56:14] statement of what where he of where Cain
[56:16] came from and it says for this is the
[56:18] message that you heard from the
[56:19] beginning that we should love one
[56:21] another not as Cain who was of that
[56:25] Wicked one
[56:26] amen his father was the Wicked one Adam
[56:29] was not the wicked one Adam was the son
[56:31] of God says who was of that Wicked one
[56:33] and slew his brother and wherefore slew
[56:36] he him why did he kill him because his
[56:38] own Works were evil and his brothers
[56:41] righteous so we see that the works of
[56:43] Cain's line are evil and the works of
[56:45] Adam's line are righteous sons of God
[56:48] Sons of men sons of men are serpent seed
[56:51] and sons of God are God's original plan
[56:53] and and line through Adam and Eve so
[56:56] Cain's line is called the son of man and
[56:58] they produce daughters but I want you to
[57:00] consider something now how does Cain get
[57:03] a
[57:05] wife well there's only one family that
[57:07] can produce and that's Adam and Eve so
[57:10] Adam and Eve produce Sons but they also
[57:12] produce daughters and so in order for
[57:15] Cain to get a wife now we have to look
[57:17] at this a little bit differently okay in
[57:19] the scriptures in the early days it was
[57:21] not a problem to marry your sister or
[57:23] your half sister Abraham married his
[57:25] half sister Isaac married a distant
[57:26] relative it wasn't an issue early on but
[57:29] what we see here is that Cain had to get
[57:32] a wife from Eve and
[57:35] Adam but you have to realize that Cain
[57:38] has been separated he's got a mark put
[57:40] on him he's been shut out from that from
[57:42] that family line and so how does Cain
[57:44] have to get a wife he has to do what his
[57:46] daddy did and he has to go and seduce
[57:49] and he has to go and beguile a a a a
[57:52] Believer into thinking that he's not
[57:55] that bad he didn't all those things or
[57:57] he had good reasons for it and he's not
[57:59] cursed of God and he has to go and he
[58:01] has to seduce this woman away from the
[58:03] truth of the word of God and bring her
[58:06] to his way of thinking so that he can
[58:07] make her his wife what's he doing he's
[58:10] doing exactly what his daddy did he's
[58:12] doing exactly what his daddy did the
[58:14] works of your father you shall do and
[58:16] he's doing the works of the serpent
[58:17] Satan through the serpent
[58:19] amen and so Cain would have to be just
[58:22] like his father and his father would
[58:23] have been handsome he would have been a
[58:25] good talk ER big strong attractive and
[58:27] we'll see that by the scriptures as we
[58:29] go through and so what does Cain produce
[58:31] now he produces people just like his
[58:34] daddy that's what he does he produces
[58:37] big beautiful strong smart wise in the
[58:39] things of the world a group of people
[58:41] and what happens is these these sons of
[58:44] God now start to see the beauty of the
[58:47] Serpent's line it's a hybrid but it's a
[58:51] beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing
[58:53] and they see these beautiful women and
[58:55] they get snared by one thing the
[58:58] appearance what got Eve first the
[59:01] appearance and then she tasted and saw
[59:03] that what she thought was good actually
[59:05] was good and these are the same things
[59:07] that happens to the sons of God they
[59:09] stopped staying they stopped looking
[59:11] where God told them to stay and they
[59:12] start looking over the fence to see
[59:14] what's out there and pretty soon some
[59:16] beautiful woman walks by they say hey I
[59:18] like that and they took it says as many
[59:21] of them as they
[59:23] wanted Genesis 62 says the sons of God
[59:26] saw the daughters of men that they were
[59:28] fair that they were beautiful and they
[59:30] took them wives of all which they chose
[59:33] so now the sons of God supposed to be
[59:35] separate sons of men were separated now
[59:38] they're coming together and now we have
[59:39] a mixed race amen we have Cain's line
[59:42] Half Son of God half son of the serpent
[59:44] then we have Adam's line which is fully
[59:46] sons of God and as soon as they mix it
[59:48] causes a blending of not only their
[59:50] physical traits but their
[59:52] Natures amen and so now two family
[59:55] characteristics SS two natures and it
[59:57] puts Humanity into a hybrid Fallen
[1:00:00] condition there's two clear families but
[1:00:02] now they start to blend and God has a
[1:00:04] problem with that and we'll see that he
[1:00:05] jumps in to reduce the impact but when
[1:00:07] we look at the works of the sons of men
[1:00:09] versus the sons of God we see that the
[1:00:12] sons of God were trying to get back and
[1:00:16] we see the sons of of men are trying to
[1:00:18] move forward sons of God are saying we
[1:00:21] need to get back to the tree of life we
[1:00:23] need to get back to relationship with
[1:00:24] God we need to get back back to our
[1:00:26] original condition and the sons of men
[1:00:28] of of kees line are saying no we need to
[1:00:31] make life as comfortable as possible we
[1:00:33] need to make it work here we've got to
[1:00:34] find a way to manipulate the situation
[1:00:37] so our lives are more comfortable and
[1:00:38] the sons of God are calling on the name
[1:00:40] of the Lord and the sons of men are
[1:00:42] trying to make the earth work in their
[1:00:44] favor but it's all cursed amen and don't
[1:00:46] we see that today everyone in this world
[1:00:48] is fighting and scrabbling and working
[1:00:50] as hard as they can and we've got the
[1:00:52] sons and the daughters of God saying
[1:00:54] this world is not my home we are
[1:00:56] pilgrims and strangers I'm headed out of
[1:00:57] here you can take it you can fight for
[1:00:59] it I don't want it I'm seeking a kingdom
[1:01:02] and a city whose Builder and maker is
[1:01:04] God Amen even in their fallen condition
[1:01:07] the nature of a Son of God is to come
[1:01:10] back to God he wants to get back to
[1:01:12] where he came from he wants to get back
[1:01:13] to his inheritance he wants to get back
[1:01:15] to his father he wants to get back to
[1:01:17] his fellowship and so they're crying out
[1:01:19] to God God bring us back God make a way
[1:01:22] and the sons of men are there and
[1:01:23] they're building great kingdoms and
[1:01:25] great tools and great instruments and
[1:01:27] all these different things machines and
[1:01:28] mechanics and whatnot that's what
[1:01:30] they're trying to do remember that
[1:01:32] because the nature of a Son of God is
[1:01:35] always to go back to God you want to
[1:01:38] know if you got the Holy Spirit what's
[1:01:39] it calling you to what's drawing you day
[1:01:42] by day we'll find that amen Cain's line
[1:01:44] was interested in moving on and Adam's
[1:01:47] line was interested in going back to
[1:01:48] where they came
[1:01:50] from we have the same spirit and Paul
[1:01:52] talks about in Galatians he says but
[1:01:54] when the fullness of time was come God
[1:01:56] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[1:01:59] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:02:01] under the law that we might receive the
[1:02:03] adoption of sons and listen to this he
[1:02:05] says because ye are
[1:02:09] Sons there is no chest there is no trial
[1:02:12] you have to pass he says because ye are
[1:02:15] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:02:17] his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:02:20] Father The Cry of the holy spirit is to
[1:02:23] draw us back to God and when we get it
[1:02:26] then our hands go up and we say God
[1:02:29] bring me back to you God bring me back
[1:02:31] to your image God bring me back to your
[1:02:33] presence God bring me back to your
[1:02:36] word and it does the work he gives us
[1:02:39] the spirit to produce what we are in the
[1:02:42] first place amen but as soon as you mix
[1:02:44] those two lines what
[1:02:46] happens the sons of God blend with the
[1:02:48] sons of man and what takes
[1:02:50] over not the nature of the sons of God
[1:02:53] let me tell you that you can't mix
[1:02:56] anything with God and come out with God
[1:02:58] and that's what they did and so what
[1:03:00] happens is it makes them stop calling on
[1:03:02] the name of the Lord because they're
[1:03:04] more interested now in the things that
[1:03:06] have been influenced in their lives by
[1:03:08] the sons of men it makes them start
[1:03:09] living and acting like Cain's family
[1:03:11] line rather than the direction that they
[1:03:13] were going in the first place and so God
[1:03:15] comes down and says enough is enough and
[1:03:17] so in Genesis 6 he says the Lord God and
[1:03:19] the Lord said my spirit shall not always
[1:03:21] strive with man for that he also is
[1:03:23] flesh yet his days shall be 120 years
[1:03:27] God sets a timeline here he says mankind
[1:03:29] has 120 years left he's not setting a
[1:03:32] limit on their lifespan can't be because
[1:03:34] Abraham lived 175 Noah goes all the way
[1:03:37] to 950 he's almost the oldest man in the
[1:03:39] Bible this is not a limit on the on
[1:03:41] their lifespan this is a limit on
[1:03:44] mankind that's why we believe Noah
[1:03:46] preached 120 years because God always
[1:03:47] sends a message before judgment so he
[1:03:50] would have preached from this point on
[1:03:52] until the floods came 120
[1:03:54] years it says now there were giants in
[1:03:57] the earth in those days and also after
[1:04:00] that so in pref flood you have Giants
[1:04:03] and after the flood you have Giants as
[1:04:05] well when the sons of God came in unto
[1:04:08] the daughters of men and they bear
[1:04:09] children to them the same became Mighty
[1:04:12] Men which were of old men of renown so
[1:04:15] this hybrid line now produces Giants
[1:04:18] this is the nature of this is not the
[1:04:20] nature of God coming out now there's no
[1:04:22] mention of giants when the sons of God
[1:04:24] stayed within their family line but as
[1:04:26] soon as they blame with c's line it
[1:04:27] produces Giants says men of re Renown
[1:04:30] men of great intellect men of great uh
[1:04:33] uh
[1:04:35] reputation these are the biggest and the
[1:04:37] best and the greatest and the mightiest
[1:04:39] amen and they are not the sons of God
[1:04:41] they are the sons of men they're the
[1:04:43] children of Cain first and foremost
[1:04:45] which is why I said Cain was big and
[1:04:47] strong and intelligent and handsome and
[1:04:49] all of these different things the Mighty
[1:04:51] Men of this world reflect Cain's line
[1:04:54] not God's line amen we see this all as
[1:04:57] we go through the many generations and
[1:04:58] brother Brian would say this he saysthe
[1:05:00] seed of the serpent comes along and what
[1:05:02] does it produce the seed of the serpent
[1:05:04] produced Cain Cain went to the Land of
[1:05:06] Nod and produced Giants and then they
[1:05:08] came to the land of Noah they were smart
[1:05:11] educated intelligent people they were
[1:05:13] Builders inventors scientists not
[1:05:16] through the seed of the righteous but
[1:05:17] through the seed of Satan the serpent
[1:05:19] they were such men as scientists
[1:05:21] Builders Great Men Educators the
[1:05:23] scripture says so they worked brass they
[1:05:25] worked and they worked metals they
[1:05:27] invented things they tempered different
[1:05:28] metals and built houses and so forth
[1:05:31] scripture says so and they were scoffers
[1:05:33] at the seed of the woman Noah the
[1:05:35] righteous is that right that that to
[1:05:38] make us stop and consider something
[1:05:39] because when we realize this the nature
[1:05:42] that makes us great in the eyes of the
[1:05:44] world today is the Serpent's
[1:05:47] nature okay I'm an engineer I'm a
[1:05:50] scientist I'm a man of logic and region
[1:05:53] reason I can design things I can make
[1:05:55] things I can come up with things brother
[1:05:57] Matt is the same thing brother Matt what
[1:05:58] makes us great today in the eyes of the
[1:06:00] world not God it's this it's the
[1:06:03] Serpent's line that does it it's not
[1:06:05] that God doesn't have people that are
[1:06:07] smart or anything but the the the traits
[1:06:09] that follow the serpent are intellect
[1:06:11] and reason and the ability to manipulate
[1:06:13] what we have
[1:06:15] amen where does intellect lead us Church
[1:06:19] destruction death that's where that's
[1:06:22] where it led it led Eve and it's been
[1:06:24] doing it ever since amen not intellect
[1:06:27] never leads us to God let me put it that
[1:06:29] way it never leads us to God and so that
[1:06:31] tells us where it comes from even today
[1:06:33] we don't need knowledge we need
[1:06:35] wisdom right we need Godly knowledge but
[1:06:38] we need wisdom in how to apply it that's
[1:06:39] what we're really looking for if we look
[1:06:42] in first Corinthians it says for you see
[1:06:44] your calling Brethren how that not many
[1:06:46] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[1:06:50] not many noble are called remember what
[1:06:53] did God give God gave his word word
[1:06:56] Satan gave intellect and reason God gave
[1:06:58] power and authority by the word Satan
[1:07:00] gave Power by using your
[1:07:02] body Satan said I'll put Power into you
[1:07:05] so you don't need God God says if I give
[1:07:07] you my power you have all the power
[1:07:08] you'll ever need but Satan comes and he
[1:07:11] he takes it it's two completely
[1:07:12] different Natures at work with
[1:07:14] completely different results one of them
[1:07:15] was life and the other one was death and
[1:07:17] destruction and we can see these results
[1:07:19] as we look at what happens in in Genesis
[1:07:22] and it says and God saw that the
[1:07:23] wickedness of man was great in the Earth
[1:07:26] and that every imagination of the
[1:07:30] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:07:34] continually Church you blend god with
[1:07:36] something you don't get more of God you
[1:07:39] never do you get more of what you
[1:07:42] Blended in remember we talked I think it
[1:07:43] was in the the last service how God is
[1:07:45] light he's pure he's holy he's righteous
[1:07:48] and when you blend anything in with God
[1:07:50] you taint it and it's no longer him it's
[1:07:53] no longer him you can't do that and why
[1:07:55] does that matter church because we'll
[1:07:57] see as we go along Cain's line that they
[1:07:59] tried to blend their ideas their
[1:08:01] religion into what God was and all it
[1:08:04] produced was Babel and then it produced
[1:08:07] idolatry It produced perversion It
[1:08:08] produced child sacrifice it produce all
[1:08:11] of these Unholy things amen you can't
[1:08:14] plan your life with God's ideas you
[1:08:17] can't do it you have to take one or the
[1:08:20] other because they're completely
[1:08:21] contrary one to another and we'll see
[1:08:23] that as we get later in the service this
[1:08:24] morning
[1:08:25] Bram says this he says it's always been
[1:08:28] the cursed of the Lord hybrid stay away
[1:08:31] from it hybrid religion don't mix it
[1:08:33] Jesus said if you have the faith of a
[1:08:35] mustard seed why did he say like a
[1:08:37] mustard seed he says mustard won't mix
[1:08:41] with nothing mustard genuine mustard you
[1:08:45] aren't Hy breing it it's mustard
[1:08:47] actually look this up I looked this up
[1:08:50] because what they might have known in
[1:08:51] the 50s or something you know you want
[1:08:53] to see have they ever done it and nobody
[1:08:55] has been been able to blend mustard seed
[1:08:57] with something else they can do GMO they
[1:08:59] can genetically modify it to make it
[1:09:01] more hearty but they can't blend mustard
[1:09:03] with something else to produce anything
[1:09:05] they can keep it producing mustard but
[1:09:07] they can't blend it you can blend all
[1:09:09] sorts of other things to produce new new
[1:09:11] species you can't blend mustard they've
[1:09:13] got over 3,000 mustard seeds but none of
[1:09:17] them have been
[1:09:18] Blended you can't do it and that's what
[1:09:21] he's saying here he says men that are
[1:09:23] born of the spirit of God are God's sons
[1:09:25] of and daughters they're not hybrid they
[1:09:27] stay with God they stay with his program
[1:09:30] they stay with his Spirit they don't
[1:09:32] want any of the hybrid stuff doesn't
[1:09:34] matter how big and Polished the other
[1:09:36] churches look how big and Polished the
[1:09:38] congregation looks how glamorous and
[1:09:40] what Great Gatherings they have that
[1:09:42] don't phase them a bit amen we're
[1:09:45] walking by faith we're not walking by
[1:09:47] sight we're not trying to please
[1:09:48] somebody we're not trying to use numbers
[1:09:50] to get ourselves in that's never a
[1:09:52] reflection I remember talking with
[1:09:53] brother Kingsley this week Paul's chur
[1:09:55] Church in Ephesus had 12 people come
[1:09:58] back a year later Paul how many people
[1:09:59] do you have 12 come back a year later
[1:10:01] how many people you have Paul 12 Paul
[1:10:03] what are you doing Paul where's the
[1:10:06] fruit of your ministry I've got 12 I
[1:10:08] started with 12 and I still have 12 they
[1:10:10] haven't fallen away they've got the
[1:10:12] spirit of God and it's giving them
[1:10:13] overcoming power you might have a
[1:10:15] thousand but how many have overcoming
[1:10:18] power right God's in it for quality not
[1:10:21] quantity amen Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:23] they won't be phased by these things he
[1:10:25] says and up to this point God was okay
[1:10:28] with the way things were going the sons
[1:10:29] of God had stayed separate they were
[1:10:31] seeking after God God was responding to
[1:10:33] them Church listen to this Enoch walked
[1:10:36] with God and took a Rapture under these
[1:10:38] conditions that ought to give us hope
[1:10:40] this even this morning as we look at
[1:10:41] that that Enoch was able to stay
[1:10:43] separate from all of the things that
[1:10:45] were going on and he walked so cleanly
[1:10:47] and so closely to God that God took him
[1:10:50] in a res in a
[1:10:52] Rapture the conditions are not what
[1:10:54] Define who's going and who stain it's
[1:10:56] what's in the heart that's going to do
[1:10:57] it amen he walked with God and he
[1:11:00] pleased God and he overcame the things
[1:11:01] of the world and he kept himself
[1:11:03] separate what a testimony for us to lay
[1:11:05] hold to when we're in the darkest of
[1:11:07] times God is here and he's about to say
[1:11:09] I'm going to destroy it
[1:11:11] all and in that time where God's about
[1:11:13] to destroy it all what does he do he
[1:11:15] takes up somebody in a Rapture without
[1:11:17] seeing death now if things had stayed
[1:11:20] separate if the sons of man had stayed
[1:11:22] in their place and sons of God stayed in
[1:11:24] their place then CHR could have come and
[1:11:26] he would have come to redeem the sons of
[1:11:28] God and it would have been an easy peasy
[1:11:30] plan because they'd have all been living
[1:11:32] over here and he could have just come
[1:11:34] there and he could have died for them
[1:11:36] and we'd have said we know who the sons
[1:11:38] of God are we know who the daughters of
[1:11:39] God are because they've been kept in a
[1:11:41] Pure
[1:11:42] Line that's the way it would have
[1:11:45] went because there was a clear physical
[1:11:47] separation there it'd be very obvious
[1:11:50] but now things are Blended and there is
[1:11:51] no clear separation things are going
[1:11:53] downhill and God doesn't like it a
[1:11:54] single bit it says it repented the Lord
[1:11:57] that he had made men on the earth and it
[1:11:58] grieved him at his heart and the Lord
[1:12:00] said I will destroy man whom I have
[1:12:03] created from the face of the Earth both
[1:12:06] man and Beast and the creeping thing and
[1:12:08] the fowls of the air for it repenteth me
[1:12:10] that I have made
[1:12:12] them God says it's gone too
[1:12:14] far that's how powerful was the nature
[1:12:18] of Satan in men that in just a short
[1:12:22] span I think it was, 1600 years from
[1:12:24] Adam to the flood in600 years God said
[1:12:26] I've got to destroy this whole
[1:12:29] thing
[1:12:31] wow got to wipe the whole thing off but
[1:12:34] now if we go forward to Jesus and and
[1:12:36] he's talking about this very situation
[1:12:39] and we'll see these two natures and
[1:12:40] we're talking about this because we're
[1:12:41] going to be looking at the spirits that
[1:12:43] come through this brother B would talk
[1:12:45] about when you see the two Spirits
[1:12:46] working within the very framework of the
[1:12:49] church not the world in the church but
[1:12:52] within the frame of the church he says
[1:12:54] then we'll go when we realize what's
[1:12:56] going on when we realize who we are and
[1:12:57] who they are he says there'll be a
[1:12:58] separation and we're going to get out of
[1:12:59] here and they'll stay for for judgment
[1:13:02] but we want to see here what this looks
[1:13:03] like and Jesus is giving us his own
[1:13:05] Insight here it says another Parable put
[1:13:07] he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of
[1:13:09] Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
[1:13:12] good seed in his field good seed only
[1:13:15] right God's perfect plan in God's
[1:13:17] perfect plan only good seed were on this
[1:13:19] Earth Sons and Daughters of God in God's
[1:13:21] image it says but while men slept his
[1:13:25] enemy came and sowed tears among the
[1:13:27] wheat and went his way tears are a wild
[1:13:30] plant we think it's a weed that would
[1:13:32] look like thistles or briers or
[1:13:34] something no a tear is a plant a wild
[1:13:36] plant that looks just like a wheat until
[1:13:39] the very
[1:13:40] end in every aspect except what it
[1:13:43] produces it looks just like a wheat amen
[1:13:47] it looks like wheat for a
[1:13:49] while says but when the blade was sprung
[1:13:51] up and brought forth fruit then appear
[1:13:55] here the tears also now notice now it's
[1:13:57] only when the real wheat starts to show
[1:13:59] some grain that the differences appear
[1:14:02] because they're looking they're saying
[1:14:03] some is producing wheat and some ain't
[1:14:06] they both look like wheat they look like
[1:14:08] wheat but now something's producing
[1:14:10] grain and something's not they say we
[1:14:12] got a problem here right why you can't
[1:14:15] tell it apart otherwise until the fruit
[1:14:19] starts to show we don't know who's who
[1:14:20] or what's what amen religion can I put
[1:14:24] it this way religion looks a lot like
[1:14:25] Christ for a
[1:14:27] while they come to church they do what
[1:14:29] the scripture says they listen to what
[1:14:31] the preacher says they do all these
[1:14:32] things but if there isn't an inward
[1:14:34] change then it's not going to hold them
[1:14:35] forever and they'll fall away and we
[1:14:37] covered that in the last service when we
[1:14:38] spoke on good ground amen the two lines
[1:14:41] the two Natures look very close for a
[1:14:43] long time
[1:14:45] sometimes he says so the Servants of the
[1:14:47] householder came and said unto him s did
[1:14:50] thou did not thou sow good seed in thy
[1:14:52] field from whence have the tears he said
[1:14:54] you put in the good stuff where's the
[1:14:55] bad stuff coming from and he said unto
[1:14:58] them an enemy had done this the servant
[1:15:00] said unto him wilt thou then that we go
[1:15:02] and gather them up they said do you want
[1:15:03] us to go in and clean up the field take
[1:15:06] out all the tears leave the wheat and he
[1:15:08] said nay no lest while you gather up the
[1:15:11] tears you root up also the wheat with
[1:15:13] them he says if you go out and you use
[1:15:15] what you think you know and take them
[1:15:18] apart you're going to take up some of
[1:15:19] the wheat thinking that it's a tear amen
[1:15:22] that's a real good warning to us as
[1:15:24] believers
[1:15:26] just cuz you don't see it now doesn't
[1:15:27] mean you won't see it then amen and we
[1:15:30] see here that there might have been
[1:15:32] wheat there that hadn't produced grain
[1:15:35] Yet brother Brandon remember he goes on
[1:15:38] the he has a he goes across the beyond
[1:15:40] the curtain in a time and he sees this
[1:15:42] beautiful one woman come up to him and
[1:15:45] and she's just glowing and he says she
[1:15:47] says don't you know who I am and he says
[1:15:50] no who are you she says you led me to
[1:15:52] the Lord and I think she was 92 90 or 92
[1:15:56] years old can you imagine all the hope
[1:15:58] that was lost over that
[1:16:00] woman saved in her
[1:16:03] 90s but if she's a wheat she's going to
[1:16:06] produce wheat it'll come forth you can't
[1:16:08] keep it back you can't hold back the
[1:16:10] life of God Amen just because it hasn't
[1:16:13] started producing the fruit doesn't mean
[1:16:15] it's not a wheat so then he has wisdom
[1:16:17] he says let both grow together when
[1:16:20] until the Harvest see some wheat starts
[1:16:22] showing grain later than others but
[1:16:24] there's a a time of harvest where all
[1:16:26] the wheat is in its maturity now some
[1:16:29] might only have 30 some might have 60
[1:16:31] some might have 100 but all of the wheat
[1:16:34] will show its true nature and he says
[1:16:37] when you can see that then you can do it
[1:16:39] but until then you got to wait he says
[1:16:41] let them grow together until the Harvest
[1:16:43] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[1:16:45] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[1:16:48] tears and bind them in bundles to burn
[1:16:51] them but gather the wheat into my birn
[1:16:54] so there's Reapers for the tears
[1:16:56] first and then what's left is taken up
[1:16:59] and we see brother Brown's very clear on
[1:17:01] this he says The ecumenical move today
[1:17:03] is binding the tears together for
[1:17:05] judgment amen they're all different all
[1:17:08] the denominations are different and they
[1:17:10] stand on their differences but they all
[1:17:12] come from one
[1:17:14] source and it's the mother of harlots
[1:17:16] you go into Revelation 175 it says she's
[1:17:19] the mother of
[1:17:21] harlots everything that came out of her
[1:17:23] they think they're different they think
[1:17:25] they're separated but all they did was
[1:17:26] went into their own line of religion and
[1:17:29] it's the same thing that Nimrod did in
[1:17:31] Babel he created his own religion and
[1:17:33] it's come through all the way ever since
[1:17:34] and it's just men with their ideas
[1:17:36] trying to produce God it doesn't work
[1:17:38] they're Bound for judgment they all get
[1:17:41] the same same reward in his judgment
[1:17:43] then Jesus now comes down verse 36 and
[1:17:45] he sent the multitudes away and went
[1:17:47] into the house and his disciples came
[1:17:49] into him saying declare unto us the
[1:17:50] parable of the tears of the field what
[1:17:53] do this mean Jesus
[1:17:55] and he answered and said unto them he
[1:17:57] that sth the good seed is the son of man
[1:18:00] now pay attention to this phrase there
[1:18:02] not Son of God he says son of man Christ
[1:18:05] comes three ways he comes as Son of God
[1:18:07] through the church ages he comes as son
[1:18:09] of man in a prophetic office and it's
[1:18:11] specific to certain Ministries and time
[1:18:13] periods and then he comes as son of
[1:18:15] David in the millennial Reign Son of God
[1:18:17] Son of Man son of David okay we're not
[1:18:19] going to cover that so much today but
[1:18:20] just to lay it in there he says it's the
[1:18:22] son of man this is It's a prophetic work
[1:18:25] that's sewing these seeds and we saw it
[1:18:27] All Through the Ages we saw it all
[1:18:28] through Moses he sent a prophet and the
[1:18:31] prophet swed the word didn't he then
[1:18:32] after that he sends Samuel and he sends
[1:18:34] this one and that one and they're sowing
[1:18:36] the word and they're sowing the word and
[1:18:37] they're sowing the word Christ comes and
[1:18:38] he comes as son of man he is the Son of
[1:18:41] God but he comes as son of man he comes
[1:18:44] as a prophet a prophet like unto Moses
[1:18:47] will I raise up amongst you he comes as
[1:18:49] a prophet amen and so we see here that
[1:18:52] they're sowing the word and they're
[1:18:54] using that to reap when they preach the
[1:18:57] word that's what gathers the tears
[1:18:58] together because they reject it so
[1:19:01] that's a gathering there and then the
[1:19:03] the true sons of God and Daughters of
[1:19:04] God they receive the word and it
[1:19:06] produces wheat it produces life amen he
[1:19:09] says the field is the world the good
[1:19:11] seed are the children of the kingdom and
[1:19:13] the tears are the children of the wicked
[1:19:15] one there we see the children of the
[1:19:18] wicked one who was Cain of the wicked
[1:19:20] one these are Satan's seed this is the
[1:19:23] seed of the serpent not physical not
[1:19:26] physical and we'll see that this is
[1:19:29] spiritual now remember there's two seeds
[1:19:31] you have the seed of the woman which is
[1:19:33] the seed of God and the seed of the
[1:19:34] serpent which is the seed of the devil
[1:19:36] and in the beginning where we've been
[1:19:37] reading they were physical lines to
[1:19:39] start but now when they mix now we've
[1:19:41] got to come to what's in the soul that's
[1:19:43] the only thing that's pure now is the
[1:19:45] soul right that's the only thing that is
[1:19:47] eternal that's the only thing that comes
[1:19:48] from God is the soul everything else in
[1:19:50] this is not from God in our Natural Born
[1:19:53] Condition it's a soul issue now it's not
[1:19:55] a physical issue he says the enemy that
[1:19:57] sold them is the devil so if you're
[1:20:00] Children of the wicked one then who sold
[1:20:01] the seed the devil Children of the devil
[1:20:03] it was physical in the beginning now
[1:20:05] it's
[1:20:06] spiritual he says and the Harvest is the
[1:20:08] end of the world and the reapers are the
[1:20:10] Angels who are the Angels they're The
[1:20:12] Messengers they're the ministry combined
[1:20:14] it's the seven angels of the seven
[1:20:15] Church ages from Revelation 120 and then
[1:20:18] you have the five full ministry of
[1:20:19] Ephesians 4 they're all laborers in the
[1:20:21] Harvest and remember what Jesus said in
[1:20:23] Matthew 10 he says he that receiveth you
[1:20:26] receiveth me you turn them down at your
[1:20:29] peril there's only judgment if you turn
[1:20:31] down the ones that God sends your way
[1:20:33] right because Christ is not coming back
[1:20:35] today in the way he did 2,000 years ago
[1:20:37] he's coming down in a five-fold Ministry
[1:20:40] to produce a bride amen it's it's
[1:20:43] bringing us into the unity of our faith
[1:20:45] into Perfection as Ephesians talked
[1:20:47] about it's the ministry of a five-fold
[1:20:48] Ministry that does that that produces
[1:20:50] the bride it's Christ working in these
[1:20:52] men he says as therefore the tears are
[1:20:55] gathered and burned in the fire so shall
[1:20:57] it be at the end of this world the son
[1:20:59] of man shall send forth his angels and
[1:21:02] they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all
[1:21:04] those that offend and them which do
[1:21:05] iniquity so catch this this is now the
[1:21:08] The Messengers those labors for Christ
[1:21:10] the ministry they're picking and
[1:21:11] choosing people and it's based on their
[1:21:13] message not on their
[1:21:16] discernment I don't say who's in or out
[1:21:19] and you don't say who's in and out but
[1:21:21] what you do with the word will tell us
[1:21:23] who's in and who's out
[1:21:25] and the thing is it ain't over till it's
[1:21:27] over that's why he says You' got to wait
[1:21:28] till the Harvest amen when I look at how
[1:21:31] I acted until I gave my heart to the
[1:21:32] Lord I was out by outward appearance but
[1:21:36] by a soul by the soul inside of me I was
[1:21:38] always in and I just needed to come to a
[1:21:40] place where I'd surrender and let him do
[1:21:41] the work inside of my
[1:21:43] life it says and shall cast them into a
[1:21:45] furnace of fire there shall be wailing
[1:21:47] and nashing of teeth then shall the
[1:21:49] righteous shine forth as the son in the
[1:21:51] Kingdom of their father who have ears to
[1:21:54] hear
[1:21:55] let him hear so there's a separation
[1:21:58] coming and it's not based on on on what
[1:22:00] we can say about our family lines but
[1:22:02] it's coming based on how we receive the
[1:22:04] message that God sends our way so then
[1:22:07] we go back to Genesis now and we have
[1:22:09] those two separate lines and now they
[1:22:11] started mixing but there was a family
[1:22:13] there was a line that stayed separate
[1:22:15] there was one that stayed pure for a
[1:22:17] while and the scripture says this but
[1:22:19] Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[1:22:23] amen Noah had kept his his skirts clean
[1:22:25] he had kept himself separate it says now
[1:22:28] these are the generations of Noah Noah
[1:22:30] was a just man and perfect in his
[1:22:32] generations and Noah walked with God
[1:22:34] Noah was a sincere believer he was
[1:22:37] separate from the world but notice the
[1:22:39] difference between Enoch and Noah Noah
[1:22:41] found Grace but Enoch pleased
[1:22:44] God Enoch walked with God and Enoch
[1:22:47] pleased God it does not say Noah did the
[1:22:49] same thing it said he was just and he
[1:22:51] was perfect in his generation compared
[1:22:53] to those around him he was in a really
[1:22:54] good place and he was of the Pure Line
[1:22:57] of God and he was sincere but that was
[1:22:59] not enough to take Noah in a
[1:23:01] Rapture amen God always has a witness
[1:23:05] and he has a witness while the bride's
[1:23:06] here and then he has a witness when the
[1:23:07] bride's not here because there's people
[1:23:09] going to give their life in sincerity
[1:23:11] based on what they believed all along
[1:23:13] but as things get tangled up in a hurry
[1:23:15] and we know that in Noah we look at the
[1:23:17] ark and we think well that was pure and
[1:23:19] it was only the sons of God that were
[1:23:20] there but we know it wasn't because
[1:23:22] Noah's sons produced some pretty awful
[1:23:24] people
[1:23:24] people and we look at these things and I
[1:23:28] didn't put it here for the sake of time
[1:23:29] but when you say how does that happen if
[1:23:31] Noah's from the Pure Line then how did
[1:23:32] it get messed up and all we can say is
[1:23:34] somebody's wife they brought in somebody
[1:23:37] that they shouldn't have brought with
[1:23:38] them and if we look at what happened
[1:23:40] because Noah is not a type of the Bride
[1:23:42] Noah has never been a type of the
[1:23:44] Bride right Enoch was the type of the
[1:23:47] Bride Enoch stayed separate he walked
[1:23:49] with God and God took him before the
[1:23:51] tribulation came God took him before
[1:23:53] judgment Noah is is a type of the
[1:23:55] sincere believer that went through the
[1:23:57] tribulation and comes out on the other
[1:23:59] side and what's he doing he's rebuilding
[1:24:01] but he still is in his sinful nature the
[1:24:04] Millennium is not Perfection the
[1:24:06] Millennium is just the promised land
[1:24:07] that God offered to Israel they'll get
[1:24:09] it for A Thousand Years it'll be the
[1:24:10] Fulfillment of what God said he would do
[1:24:13] but it's the new Heaven and the new
[1:24:14] Earth and the New Jerusalem that's when
[1:24:16] Perfection comes and that's when he says
[1:24:18] I'll wipe away all tears there'll be no
[1:24:20] more death there'll be no more this
[1:24:21] there'll be no more that that's New
[1:24:22] Jerusalem time that's not Millennium
[1:24:24] time
[1:24:25] that's not Millennium time he's ruling
[1:24:27] with a rod of iron in the Millennium
[1:24:29] somebody's going to cry sometime rods of
[1:24:31] iron don't tickle somebody needs the rod
[1:24:33] of iron so the Millennium is not
[1:24:35] Perfection it's God having total control
[1:24:37] over the kingdoms of this Earth at that
[1:24:39] time but we know that Noah's son Ham is
[1:24:42] if there's anyone that was that was off
[1:24:44] the word it would be him because his son
[1:24:47] Canaan and his family members were the
[1:24:49] ones that became Giants and they went
[1:24:51] into the worst forms of idol worship
[1:24:52] they went into uh SAC child sacrifice
[1:24:55] they went into sensual worship before
[1:24:57] God God and this is the line that was
[1:25:00] cursed After the flood and and we won't
[1:25:02] get into what they did certainly not
[1:25:04] with young ears around but it says and
[1:25:06] he said cursed be Canaan a servant of
[1:25:08] servants shall he be to his Brethren and
[1:25:10] he said blessed be the Lord God of Shem
[1:25:12] and Canan shall be his servant God shall
[1:25:15] enlarge jaffi and he shall dwell in the
[1:25:17] tents of Shem and Canaan shall be a
[1:25:18] servant so Canaan is the son of ham and
[1:25:21] then when we look at what comes out of
[1:25:23] ham I'm not going to read all of this
[1:25:25] this morning but his sons were Kush and
[1:25:28] this is out of the Amplified Egypt I
[1:25:30] believe it was uh uh mam put and Canaan
[1:25:33] and you look at Canaan and Egypt those
[1:25:35] are the two one is the one that Israel
[1:25:38] had to destroy and the other one was the
[1:25:39] one that enslaved
[1:25:41] Israel but he says canaan's going to be
[1:25:43] your servant and all of his seed is
[1:25:45] going to be your servant but we see what
[1:25:47] happened is they went in and they
[1:25:48] produce good good not good but we see
[1:25:50] big kingdoms Kush begat Nimrod he became
[1:25:52] a mighty one in the Earth and he
[1:25:54] produced Babel and he United all the
[1:25:57] people a great Kingdom until God came
[1:25:59] down and scrambled their
[1:26:01] languages and then if we look at the the
[1:26:03] next section it says that they built
[1:26:06] Nineveh a great City that God God was
[1:26:10] going to destroy and yet they received
[1:26:12] Jonah's message and he spared them but
[1:26:14] this was a wicked City we look down
[1:26:16] verse 13 misam Egypt 14 the Philistines
[1:26:21] 15 those of sidon we go into 16 and it's
[1:26:23] the J ites and the amorites and the
[1:26:25] gites and the hivites all these
[1:26:28] different ones verse 19 from sidon
[1:26:31] gar Gaza and Sodom and Gomorrah these
[1:26:34] are the generations these are the cities
[1:26:37] this is the inheritance of Satan's seed
[1:26:40] of Cain's lineage that came down through
[1:26:42] all the way through these people and
[1:26:44] when you look at the scriptures after
[1:26:45] all of this you see that Ham's line was
[1:26:48] one that had the worst outcome they were
[1:26:50] Far and Away the worst Canan was the son
[1:26:52] of kush and Kush is the father of nimrod
[1:26:55] and Nimrod was the first one to start a
[1:26:57] new religion that was anti- the original
[1:27:00] word and that is literally the source of
[1:27:03] where Catholicism comes from today where
[1:27:06] they worship women they worship men they
[1:27:08] worship the son they worship all these
[1:27:10] different things and Nimrod is the
[1:27:12] source of that and we may get into that
[1:27:14] at a different time but it was an anti-
[1:27:16] ideology that came from Satan in the
[1:27:17] very beginning what is it it's the
[1:27:19] nature following through right his other
[1:27:23] son egyp Enslaved the Israelites the
[1:27:25] amorites got so bad that God said the
[1:27:27] cup of the iniquity of the amorites is
[1:27:29] full go in and Destroy them and that's
[1:27:31] why God said when you go in Kill Them
[1:27:34] All leave nothing behind because the
[1:27:37] only thing that they have is Iniquity
[1:27:39] the only thing that they can think as
[1:27:40] evil they are anti- word anti- God anti-
[1:27:43] everything that God stands for destroy
[1:27:46] them completely no mercy no mercy Sodom
[1:27:50] and Gomorrah God literally sends two
[1:27:53] angels specific Al to destroy them
[1:27:55] that's how bad they got and you know
[1:27:58] what scripture says we're the same thing
[1:28:00] today the world exactly as it was in the
[1:28:03] days of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in
[1:28:05] the days of lot that's exactly what we
[1:28:07] have here today their the the thoughts
[1:28:09] of their mind are evil continually
[1:28:13] that's what we see we see the the the
[1:28:15] total Beast nature its perversion the
[1:28:17] amorites and the moabites in particular
[1:28:19] brought in child sacrifice can you
[1:28:23] imagine that that you believe that
[1:28:24] killing your children would draw you
[1:28:26] closer to
[1:28:27] God that's how sick they got that's how
[1:28:30] twisted they got and God couldn't stand
[1:28:32] it and he said go in and Destroy them
[1:28:34] all and so we see that after the flood
[1:28:37] everything mixed together Noah was clean
[1:28:39] Noah was pure there was no and we even
[1:28:41] look at the nature animals weren't
[1:28:43] scared before the
[1:28:44] flood men weren't eating animals they
[1:28:46] weren't killing them for sport and and
[1:28:48] everything was still in a in a sort of
[1:28:51] perfect way the men were Fallen but
[1:28:53] creation was still doing okay the
[1:28:55] animals weren't there but as soon as the
[1:28:57] the ark opens up after the flood God
[1:28:59] says now the animals are going to be
[1:29:01] scared for you I'm giving them to you
[1:29:02] for food and for clothing and all these
[1:29:04] different things and we see that Noah's
[1:29:06] sons they let everything start to slide
[1:29:09] and everything gets so Blended and mixed
[1:29:11] and it broke the lineage of the sons of
[1:29:13] God to where nobody could say now I am a
[1:29:15] Son of God nobody could say that it it
[1:29:18] was so Blended that everyone was now
[1:29:20] sons of men and we had a hybrid mix we
[1:29:23] had a hybrid Humanity
[1:29:24] that was reflecting the original sin in
[1:29:26] the Garden of Eden and that's all they
[1:29:27] had for a Heritage now sons of men a
[1:29:29] fallen nature nobody could say I am a
[1:29:33] child of
[1:29:34] God by their physical lineage you know
[1:29:37] there was no one can say I can trace my
[1:29:39] family Roots purely back through Adam
[1:29:42] now you look at the genealogies that
[1:29:43] they show in Matthew and different
[1:29:45] places they go back to Adam but when you
[1:29:47] look at what was blended into those
[1:29:49] lines even if they could somehow claim
[1:29:51] that most of it was you have Rahab in
[1:29:53] there Rahab definitely ain't a daughter
[1:29:56] of God you know if we were looking at
[1:29:58] the physical line she comes from Cain's
[1:30:00] side look at Ruth a moabitas comes from
[1:30:02] Cain's side right there is no Purity in
[1:30:05] the physical line amen and so it is not
[1:30:08] a Pure Line and that we have people in
[1:30:10] Jesus day and they were saying we are of
[1:30:12] Abraham's seed they were laying claim to
[1:30:14] righteousness to being accepted of God
[1:30:17] based on who their daddy was who their
[1:30:19] grand great great great great great
[1:30:20] great grandfather was they said we come
[1:30:22] from a Pure Line and Jesus said you are
[1:30:23] all of your father the devil and you are
[1:30:25] children of hell what was he saying your
[1:30:28] physical family does not matter listen
[1:30:31] some of us have better families than
[1:30:33] others If we're honest you you know
[1:30:35] people and they've got a a pure a pure
[1:30:37] line and they can trace it all the way
[1:30:39] back to the lutherans day and they came
[1:30:40] out from from the Lutheran and they went
[1:30:42] into Wesley and they went from Wesley
[1:30:43] into Pentecost they came out of
[1:30:44] Pentecost and came into this end time
[1:30:46] message and they got a a family line of
[1:30:48] preachers and and people that sanctify
[1:30:50] their lives and guess what you can take
[1:30:52] somebody that's sitting there and they
[1:30:54] in right out from under their mushroom
[1:30:56] knowing nothing and sit them next to
[1:30:57] that person they're exactly the same in
[1:30:59] God's eyes no difference nothing to do
[1:31:02] with it amen what was Jesus showing he
[1:31:04] was showing this flesh is condemned it's
[1:31:07] hybrid it's mixed there's nothing good
[1:31:09] in it there's nothing good in this flesh
[1:31:11] Paul said there's nothing good in my
[1:31:13] flesh amen remember the scripture says
[1:31:16] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:31:17] glory of God none of us is made in God's
[1:31:20] image anymore and so we have nothing to
[1:31:22] come before him and say I'm righteous
[1:31:24] I'm good I'm Godly we can't do that
[1:31:26] there's no physically Pure Line we're
[1:31:27] all messed up we're all mixed up we're
[1:31:30] all broken we're all a failure and I
[1:31:33] think what confuses people so much today
[1:31:35] is that we can see elements of
[1:31:38] good there are people today that say
[1:31:40] people are basically good why because
[1:31:43] they see those moments where somebody is
[1:31:45] unselfish or somebody is caring or
[1:31:47] somebody is sacrificial or somebody is
[1:31:49] humble and they say see they're good
[1:31:51] they're good they're good but then
[1:31:52] somebody comes right up behind them and
[1:31:54] does something that's bad and that's all
[1:31:55] they do are bad things and they don't
[1:31:57] see that why because it's two Natures
[1:32:00] that have been Blended and God can't
[1:32:02] come through that you'll see elements of
[1:32:05] it but you'll never see the fullness of
[1:32:06] it
[1:32:08] amen If we're honest all of us can look
[1:32:11] at our own natures and see what we're
[1:32:12] born with and we can see family traits
[1:32:15] good and bad from our parents from our
[1:32:17] grandparents some people are born and
[1:32:20] they seem mostly good we know them we
[1:32:25] know people that just seem to come out
[1:32:26] and they came out caring and humble and
[1:32:29] kind and they'll talk to anybody and
[1:32:30] there's doesn't seem to be any
[1:32:31] selfishness in their life and we think
[1:32:34] they're good then we see somebody that
[1:32:36] comes out and they're stubborn and
[1:32:37] egotistical and they're unfriendly and
[1:32:40] and all these different things but
[1:32:42] that's not what makes us good or bad it
[1:32:44] has nothing to do with it those two
[1:32:46] people both have mixed natures and just
[1:32:49] CU one nature seems to be stronger than
[1:32:51] the other does not make them any more or
[1:32:52] less righteous amen if we took those two
[1:32:55] people and stood them in the presence of
[1:32:56] God they would be judged as equals no
[1:32:59] difference no difference
[1:33:02] Amen in fact when we look in the
[1:33:04] scriptures we see many times that the
[1:33:05] children of God look far
[1:33:08] worse than the children of men amen
[1:33:12] Jacob was a Shyer he was a liar he was a
[1:33:15] cheat he was a
[1:33:17] manipulator right until he met God look
[1:33:21] at Rahab she was a prostitute an Idol
[1:33:24] worshipper Ruth the same Abraham was a
[1:33:26] liar worried about self preservation
[1:33:29] time and time again the Apostle Paul
[1:33:31] persecuted the True Church of
[1:33:33] God Matthew and zakus as we heard were
[1:33:36] Tax Collectors praying on their own
[1:33:40] people Mary had seven demons in
[1:33:44] her what are we going to do with
[1:33:47] that it's not based on what we can
[1:33:51] see from birth we're all broken we're
[1:33:53] sinful we're hybrid we're destined to
[1:33:55] die from birth we cannot please God in
[1:33:58] this flesh we can't do it we can't do it
[1:34:01] what a downer of a service we're getting
[1:34:03] this morning but I won't leave you
[1:34:06] without hope we were talking last night
[1:34:07] I said I will not close on a negative
[1:34:09] note and we're
[1:34:10] closing we're going to go to Romans 8
[1:34:13] Romans 8 is one of my favorite chapters
[1:34:15] in the scripture I got an amen out a
[1:34:16] brother a silent amen from brother Mark
[1:34:18] because Romans 7 tells us everything
[1:34:21] that I preached in this service I
[1:34:22] probably should have just read Romans 7
[1:34:24] this body of death that which I would do
[1:34:27] I don't do that which I should do I
[1:34:29] don't do and I find a law when I would
[1:34:30] do good then Evil's present when I would
[1:34:32] do yeah Paul says this whole thing this
[1:34:34] is so frustrating who will deliver me
[1:34:37] from it and then he comes into Romans 8
[1:34:38] and he says there's there for now no
[1:34:40] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[1:34:42] and he goes down and we're going to
[1:34:43] we're going to just dwell on that a
[1:34:44] little bit this morning so we go out
[1:34:45] with some with some not just some hope
[1:34:48] with some reality amen some reality it
[1:34:51] says this for they that are after the
[1:34:54] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[1:34:56] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:34:58] things of the spirit so what makes the
[1:35:00] difference Church the spirit that's what
[1:35:03] we need that's why we're doing this
[1:35:04] series on the token on the token life on
[1:35:06] the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the
[1:35:09] only thing that will change your life
[1:35:11] the word alone won't do it because it
[1:35:13] has to be quickened and that takes the
[1:35:15] Holy
[1:35:16] Spirit he says for to be carnally minded
[1:35:20] is death now notice he says carnally
[1:35:21] minded he doesn't say carnally badm
[1:35:24] minded he says carnally minded the good
[1:35:27] that we come up with this carnal mind is
[1:35:29] never going to be acceptable to God our
[1:35:31] ideas our ways our thoughts our
[1:35:33] preferences our inferences our
[1:35:34] intelligence our reason our logic none
[1:35:36] of it is going to bring us to life every
[1:35:40] bit of it amen it's all bad the carnal
[1:35:43] mind is out of not of God so everything
[1:35:45] it produces is not of God period he says
[1:35:48] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:35:51] peace why because the caral mind is
[1:35:54] enmity against God this is the Serpent's
[1:35:58] Trace that we have even today we're in a
[1:35:59] beast nature without the Holy Spirit
[1:36:02] that's why you see the world focused on
[1:36:04] on on on the the the Flesh and the lust
[1:36:07] of the flesh that that's total serpent
[1:36:10] nature right without the Holy Spirit
[1:36:13] we've been hybrid and there's no
[1:36:14] cleaning it up it's sinful because it's
[1:36:16] not pure not because it doesn't have
[1:36:18] potentially some good it's because it's
[1:36:20] not all good so he says the carnal mind
[1:36:22] is enmity against God for it is not
[1:36:24] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:36:27] can be he says then so they that are in
[1:36:30] the flesh cannot please God so don't
[1:36:34] try don't try don't rest in that stop
[1:36:38] trying that'll give you rest when you
[1:36:40] say this flesh is not what he's coming
[1:36:42] for anyways this has to be glorified
[1:36:45] this has to be quickened it has to die
[1:36:46] first and then it has to be raised in
[1:36:48] newness of life for me to please him but
[1:36:50] this flesh does not please God
[1:36:54] church if we stop right here we say
[1:36:55] we're hopeless we're lost we're forsaken
[1:36:58] we're unworthy there's nothing can
[1:37:00] happen and then he says in verse 9
[1:37:02] Hallelujah but ye are not in the flesh
[1:37:06] but in the spirit hallelujah amen he
[1:37:09] says now if any man have not the spirit
[1:37:12] of Christ he is none of his people say I
[1:37:15] accepted Christ but the Bible says
[1:37:16] unless you've got the Holy Spirit he
[1:37:18] hasn't accepted you you accepting Christ
[1:37:20] does not get you into heaven you do not
[1:37:22] find that anywhere in the scriptures
[1:37:24] because he'll say if you're my disciples
[1:37:26] then you'll do what I say just sitting
[1:37:28] there and saying I've accepted Christ
[1:37:29] what does that do that's nothing it's a
[1:37:33] confession that's it there's no
[1:37:36] repentance associated with it there's no
[1:37:39] baptism on the day of Pentecost Peter
[1:37:41] did not come down and say if you accept
[1:37:43] Christ then you'll go into heaven he
[1:37:45] said repent be baptized and received of
[1:37:47] the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:37:49] you need to do to be saved there's only
[1:37:50] one Ark today and it's the body of
[1:37:52] Christ and Corinthians says by by one
[1:37:54] Spirit were baptized into that body the
[1:37:57] only Safe Haven we have today is the
[1:37:59] body of Christ and you only get there by
[1:38:01] the spirit you have to have the Holy
[1:38:03] Spirit if you don't have it Christ has
[1:38:05] not accepted you because remember
[1:38:07] they're going to come to them that day
[1:38:08] and say didn't we do this and didn't we
[1:38:10] do this and didn't we do this and do
[1:38:11] didn't we do this he says I never knew
[1:38:12] you who are
[1:38:14] you they accepted Christ but they didn't
[1:38:18] do what he said they only took what they
[1:38:20] wanted and he says I never knew you
[1:38:21] there's no intimacy he says but if
[1:38:24] Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:38:28] because of
[1:38:29] sin don't try and resurrect it Church
[1:38:32] don't try and make
[1:38:34] it he says but the spirit is life
[1:38:38] because of righteousness but if the
[1:38:41] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:38:43] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:38:46] Christ from the dead shall Quicken your
[1:38:49] mortal
[1:38:51] bodies that word Quicken means make
[1:38:53] alive and Mortal bodies he's literally
[1:38:56] talking about this flesh now there's a
[1:38:58] forward work that he's pointing to which
[1:39:00] is the glorification but he says in the
[1:39:02] meantime he's going to make this flesh
[1:39:05] live the way that God wants you to live
[1:39:07] he says it'll Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:39:10] it'll live the way it was meant to from
[1:39:11] the beginning by his spirit that
[1:39:15] dwelleth in you Hallelujah let's stand
[1:39:19] this
[1:39:21] morning amen
[1:39:24] we can look at so many things and say
[1:39:26] there's no way out and then we read that
[1:39:29] and we say he's made a way amen God came
[1:39:32] down and he made a way for us to return
[1:39:33] back and we see this whole Bible is a
[1:39:35] book of
[1:39:36] redemption I've been talking with some
[1:39:38] people lately and I said we've got to
[1:39:40] look at it from the beginning to the end
[1:39:42] because it all ties together and it's
[1:39:43] one big story it's like saying could you
[1:39:46] open a book I think I don't know who it
[1:39:48] was that said to me this week said could
[1:39:49] you open a book and read one chapter and
[1:39:51] figure out what the whole book's about
[1:39:53] no you need to read the whole thing and
[1:39:55] this is a complete and total story of
[1:39:58] redemption of God coming back and God
[1:40:00] saying I will not leave my children in
[1:40:02] their fallen condition and what does he
[1:40:04] do he comes down to
[1:40:06] Abraham just literally takes Abraham
[1:40:09] there I don't know how many people were
[1:40:10] in the world then hundreds of thousands
[1:40:12] maybe millions and he comes down and he
[1:40:15] just comes in and he takes one
[1:40:19] person here we go and God says I'm going
[1:40:22] to start a work with one
[1:40:23] and I'm going to redeem my entire family
[1:40:27] through the faith that's exhibited in
[1:40:29] this man I'll pick you I'll separate you
[1:40:32] I'll place you I'll put a word promise
[1:40:35] in your life and I'll fulfill it and I'm
[1:40:37] not just going to do it for you Abraham
[1:40:38] but you've got a royal seed that's
[1:40:40] coming down and I'll do it for every
[1:40:41] single one of them the scripture says he
[1:40:43] swore by himself he didn't say I'll do
[1:40:46] it if Jonathan kette overcomes he says
[1:40:48] Jonathan carlette's going to overcome
[1:40:50] because I said he's going to overcome
[1:40:52] man that Dale Walger going to go into a
[1:40:53] Rapture because I said Dale wer is going
[1:40:56] to go into a Rapture he swore by himself
[1:40:58] it's his work not ours and all he's
[1:41:00] looking for is a bride that'll say yes
[1:41:02] Lord Abba Father Lord bring me back to
[1:41:06] you God do in my life what you said you
[1:41:08] were going to do Lord let me surrender
[1:41:10] to the word so that the word can be
[1:41:12] quickened by the spirit and bring this
[1:41:13] flesh into subjection and take me off
[1:41:16] this Earth keep me separate from this
[1:41:18] world that it'll heal my body that it'll
[1:41:20] change my life that it'll produce a word
[1:41:22] bride all over again amen he told
[1:41:25] Abraham he says your seed will possess
[1:41:26] the gates of their enemies you'll go
[1:41:29] right back to your original inheritance
[1:41:30] and they won't be able to hold you back
[1:41:31] from it I say praise the Lord this
[1:41:33] morning amen God bless you let's bow our
[1:41:37] head Heavenly
[1:41:41] Father Lord so often we tend to look at
[1:41:44] circumstances we look at our
[1:41:47] failures Lord we look at our
[1:41:50] trying Lord and we can get caught up in
[1:41:52] that
[1:41:54] but Lord your word says that if your
[1:41:55] spirit dwells in US it brings
[1:41:58] life Lord and your word says that you
[1:42:00] came to bring life and that
[1:42:02] abundantly Lord and if we can only
[1:42:04] surrender to that Spirit Lord if we can
[1:42:07] get it and then surrender to it Lord
[1:42:10] it'll produce your life day in day out
[1:42:13] until you take us so Lord I pray that
[1:42:16] this would be a holy spirit filled
[1:42:17] church not a church Lord but a people
[1:42:20] that comes to this church Lord that each
[1:42:22] and every one of us
[1:42:29] here Lord that there would be a
[1:42:33] cry

[1:42:40] you day by day and say don't leave me
[1:42:43] here don't leave me in this condition
[1:42:47] don't leave me in this
[1:42:48] body don't leave me in this defeat but
[1:42:51] bring me into perfect Victory heaven
[1:42:53] father I
[1:42:54] pray Lord let us cry out to you I pray
[1:42:58] Lord let us look to you let us call on
[1:43:00] you let us wait on you let us have faith
[1:43:02] in you Lord and let us take your word
[1:43:04] and put it in our hearts and on our lips
[1:43:07] Lord day by day that we could walk in
[1:43:09] the promise of victory that comes with
[1:43:11] it I pray Lord Quicken Us by your spirit
