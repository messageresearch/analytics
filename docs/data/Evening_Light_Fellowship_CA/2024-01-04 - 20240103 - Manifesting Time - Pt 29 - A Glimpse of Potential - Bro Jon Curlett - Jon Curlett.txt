this evening we pray Lord for the many not here Lord we pray your grace to them also Lord may you speak to hearts and souls now we pray Lord with this message you've given me Lord I pray that it would just Lord hit the mark this evening Lord may you just touch us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to the Book of Daniel CH 11 and then also Ephesians chapter 3 Daniel 11 and then Ephesians chapter 3 amen good to be here again this evening I have quite a few announcements to make here so just bear with me so uh as it being the new year you end up having lots of contact with different people from around the country and around the globe and so I have greetings to bring from Brother Steve Fulkerson brother John Andes brother Dwayne Fair brother Ed hammermeister brother Steve clar Brother David Nash so they all send special greetings and most of you don't know brother Vitali but Joe he said to say hello to you and God bless you he he remembered you and I said he's my best friend I think and and he goes to goes to this church now so he said oh I never knew where he was from so he I talked to him for for about 45 minutes earlier this week so he said to say that to you and greet the church as well he like me he uh he uh he's just a relatively young Pastor he's got a church of about 50 people over there in Lithuania I believe so he asked me to to pass on greetings there as well so God bless you from each of them and then I had a complete stranger reach out to me that brother Dwayne far had given me giving my contact information to him and this is Brother Edmund um Hagman from Pei so he's a missionary and uh focuses on India mostly but they moved him and uh his his son and a few other families moved to Pi to do grain farming and sheep farming so he's got a thousand acres there and he's got a little church there of looked like maybe 15 people and the Lord brought some East Indian people over to Pei to to talk or to to to stay there and so he's got just a little Church of mature people he said we just baptized two new converts uh last week and whatnot so he wants to have some fellowship so we may bring him over here he invited me to come over and speak for them at some point if we could work it out so I just say praise the Lord we've got another another Minister here in the local area and uh well spoken of and has a heart for the Lord just a simple brother seems like very sincere so you never know what we might have coming our way so praise the Lord for that amen and then I spoke with brother Andrew Dodd who's uh one of the associate ministers with brother Ed hammermeister there in Edmonton and he's confirmed meetings with us on February 23rd through the 25th so it'll be typical Friday night Saturday night Sunday morning but he's uh he's booking his ticket shortly for that and the deacons will send out the announcement for that so we want to certainly remember um remember that in prayer and trust the Lord to lead him in those things I also want to thank the officers of the church we'll have a vot obviously on Sunday and uh for those of you that don't make it thank you for for for helping all this while and for those that do get voted in then God bless you and we'll continue to serve I'm sure we'll all get in but I do sincerely appreciate the work that each one of you has done and and your sincerity and your your commitment and um you know I think it was brother Dale said he didn't know how much work went into managing and helping out a church until he became a trustee and you don't understand until you do it whether it's in the music whether it's in the trustees the finances the deacons whatever it is until you do it you don't understand the the stress that can come with it and the time commitment and the energy that it can drain from you and it's a blessing it's a blessing to do it but it's work I think anything that's a blessing is is work as well so thank you each one and brother Dale is not going to be serving us officially he'll still be working just as hard I think just in a little bit different capacity but God bless you brother Dale for that especially and uh and each one amen and then a prayer request so Blanca's mother has been diagnosed with lupus and so we just want to put that as a prayer request before the church she's just had a few small symptoms so far and and uh we're trusting God Amen we're trusting God to just touch her and and uh he can heal it he can make it go away he can make it something she can live with he can do all these things amen but we believe that he's a Healer there's no scripture that says that uh it'll stay the same there's no scripture that says that you know you just have to live with things amen but we've got an overcoming God we've got a healing God we've got a great physici and so we we want to remember her in prayer as well amen God bless you this is uh this is my New Year's service or my New Year's sermon if we wanted to put it that way it it fits in line with what we've been studying but just to give you a fair warning that you know we're we're going to be talking about potential and the thing about potential is you can't talk about potential unless you you get the people to recognize that there's room for growth and there's growth to be had amen you don't want to dwell on the what you don't have but you don't want to dwell also on only on what's coming up you got to put the two together so that's a bit of what we're going to do a bit this evening but I want to start in Daniel 11:32 and this is a wonderful scripture for the believer it says and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter 3 as well Ephesians 3 and verse 16 and it says that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with with might by his spirit in the Inner Man amen it'll be expressed outwardly but it won't be visible what happens is an internal work not an external work it says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith and they that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend now we think of that word comprehend as understand when you comprehend something you understand it but that word comprehend means to lay hold of to attain to obtain to make one own so that you may be able to lay hold of that you may be able to attain that you may be able to make your own with all the saints it's not just for you and it's not just for me but it's for all of us what is the breadth what is the length what is the depth and what is the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God Amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and as I mentioned we're this is my New Year service if we want to put it that way but it is in the channel of this this uh this S Series we've been doing on manifesting time and I want to speak tonight on a glimpse of potential and there's a lot in here that I've kind of just had sitting in the background for a while and and just wanting to to kind of bring it into one one simple message here like we have this evening and you know it's it's the new year and before uh the New Year's kind of came up I spent a lot of time thinking about what's happened in this past year and certainly a lot has happened for me personally and and spiritually and also what's been happening in the local body here and you know as I was writing out the Christmas cards for each of you it it was a wonderful time because I really got to sit and think about what each of you brings to the church you know it's a funny thing when we speak about the body you'll never see Christ talking about what you don't have but you he'll talk about what you do have because every one of us has a place in the local body and we bring something to the local body so what brother Mark has that I don't have that's not a that's not something that's wrong about me but that's why brother Mark is needed is because he has something I don't have and sister Amber might have something that sister Blanca doesn't have and vice versa but we don't focus on the fact that Blanca doesn't have this or sister Amber doesn't have that but we focus on what each one brings because that's the need for the body as we bring together what each one has and we compensate for what the other one doesn't have so as I was dwelling on those things you know it was a wonderful thing and it really you know just reinforced to me how much I appreciate this congregation and the the people we have and the gifts that we have and it's it's not just enough to have people in the seat it's not just have enough to have gifts but it takes people that are willing to put those gifts to work and to put their energy and their their shoulder to the wheel in these different things you know and and I was thinking on that the world twists up so many good things and I think diversity is one of the things they've twisted up most in recent times because I look around the church and I see so much diversity and it's not just the color of our skin and it's not just you know where we come from or the difference in families or jobs or education or these things but the world focuses on diversity for the sake of just bringing those things in and not recognizing why the need is actually there and so they force something that ought to be happening naturally because you understand the strengths of what are there rather than anything else you know but I look around this church and we're not supposed to be carbon copies of one another and as a pastor I'll never force you to be the way I am amen there's supposed to be a Unity of the spirit under the word and we'll get into that in a little bit amen but we have different ways of worshiping we have different ways of responding to the word of God we have different ways of of dealing with each other and expressing ourselves and some of us are great talkers and some of us are great listeners and some of us have a balance there and you know some of us bring constant enthusiasm and energy and as I say these things names are going to and faces are going to come to your mind because we know who those people are and we got people that are that are great at talking and we know that when we have newcomers come in that's the person that's going to go make them feel welcome and then we got ones that'll sit there quietly but in a in in a time when there's a need that not a person often times that'll come in and they'll empathize with you and they know the right words to say and they don't talk much but when they talk it's really worth listening to and neither one is better than the other but they're needed at different times and for different situations and these things you know some say a lot and some some don't some are very very responsive in the service and some aren't that doesn't matter amen what matters is that you're here with purpose and intention you know and we've got musicians and we've got singers and song leaders and teachers and cleaners helps and it's a wonderful thing because this is the holy spirit adding to the church such as are needed and we've only got a small church here you know but we've got every need supplied anden we may not have every want supplied but we have every need supplied we have a Ministry we have song leaders two of them we have we have a musician that plays a piano we've got two guitar players we've got multiple deacons we've got multiple trustees we've got people that have a heart to serve and our bases are covered and I praise the Lord for that I think it's a wonderful thing that after all these years after 43 years we've still got people here and we're not just fading away but we're growing and and the spirit of the Lord is there to to bring forward a Next Generation to help fill these gaps in in these different things so I don't worry about the small size you know we're less than 50 maybe 55 that support this ministry around the island but it's only going to be a small group that goes anyways and I'm not talking about church size I'm talking about the bride globally brother B talked about one in a million and if you do one in a million then 8,000 of us are going to go and that's it if we look at the world population today amen but I said it before and I don't know if you remember I was here for special meetings one time and I said there's more power in this little group than we realize and I'm going to talk to you a bit about that this evening because the potential for a group of any believers of any size in the unity of the spirit is greater than anything we've ever understood and you get glimpses of it and we're going to talk a bit about a glimpse into the potential of a a body of Believers amen but it's not just Unity of people because they had that at the Tower of Babel amen it's not just Unity of people but it's Unity of people under the unction of the Holy Spirit under the word of God that makes us a powerful group Amen brother we put it this way he says but we get so sour down on theology till we don't know nothing about the spirit that's a cold formal church amen we need solid teaching we need foundational understanding but that's not all there is to the Christian walk and that's not all there is to church services he says now I hope you love me after this we're talking about potential and that means you got to understand there's room to grow he says but that's what it is I mean Pentecost too that's right just shouting and dancing around doesn't mean you know anything about the spirit he says it's personal contact face to face that's what you need that's the kind of church that God's fixing to raise up that's right when they come together and in unity and Power in the spirit amen so he's not just talking about us coming together to church amen but we need that and I know I've said it many times and maybe you're getting sick of it now because you're sitting here and it doesn't apply to you but the scripture warns us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together all the more as you see the day approaching you know why it said that because people will stop because people aren't going to think it's important amen and there's no substitute for being in a church service I don't care if you've got you know I think the best live stream we've got in the message is brother Chad lambs and they've got the lighting right they've got the audio right and they've got the cameras right but there is nothing to replace being in a church service and me there's nothing to replace the face-to-face contact that he's talking about you know and I was talking to some brothers after service on Sunday and I didn't tell anybody about this but I hadn't been feeling well before the service and I was stuck in the bathroom from quite some time that's why I got to the pulpit late and by the end I just said Lord I'm here to preach I'm here at my post of Duty and I'm not feeling like it but I'm here to preach so I said Lord help me to preach and I walked out of there and I came up on this pulpit and it didn't bother me at all and it hasn't bothered me since now the way I started and the way I finished were two very different things but in the midst of that was me committing to my post of Duty they're depending on me and I'm depending on the Lord so he's got to move amen there's something that's supposed to happen in these things amen but you've got a post of Duty too and your post of Duty in some of you it's to to lead songs and some of you of you it's to play but it's no less a post of Duty to come here and hear the preaching of the word to pull on the word of God to worship God to be in service to show whose side you're on Amen I was listening to to the I've been listening to the message why are people so tossed about and I I want to say this and and I hope you'll understand this in the way that I mean it because if you look around so often we're having less and less people make it to service in this own building we've had more people miss church in the last year I think than we've had since Co now that hasn't been a lot of time but I I notice it because I'm up here and so I want to read you a quote here but before I do that have you ever noticed how brother Bob is always here sister Morin is always here brother Matt is always here brother Vel is always here why is it because they know they've got a post of Duty they know they have to be here because people are depending on them but see what happens is as a congregation we can forget that we have a post of Duty that is no less important than those people that are here amen you think that sister Morin doesn't feel sick occasionally brother Bob that your voice isn't the greatest you wake up and maybe it's a bit HSE but he still comes and he leads songs amen listen to what brother Branham said this is him why are people so tossed about now so this is is going to help us not be tossed about he says and it's not just me out there in the service the prophet of the hour the seventh Church age messenger the star for the leoan church he says and it's not just me out there he said I have such a little part to do with it well who plays the big part he says it's you back there the congregation he says plays the biggest part to what happens in a service amen so I'm not here to to break you down this evening but you know one of the brothers said he said when we were talking after service on Sunday he said I've come to the church sick many times and as soon as my hand touches that door to go into the sanctuary or I go into the sanctuary I don't feel sick anymore I feel good enough to get up and do what I came here to do and so I'm not saying that I'm not trying to beat you down I'm saying we're talking about potential and the potential is that this is not just a house of hearing the word of God but this is a house of healing this is a House of Deliverance this is a house where you can get a testimony that isn't God took care of the sickness after 3 days but God took care of the sickness when I went and I went to my post of Duty amen I'm saying that Satan's maybe been bluffing us out of a blessing and there's potential now for us to come back to that amen the scripture says if any is sick let him all the elders and let them anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick that's available here that's available at your home that's available wherever amen but don't let being sick always keep us out sometimes we are so sick we ought not to go I get it but sometimes it can be the smallest thing and we say I'm just not feeling it and we stay home amen I'm reminded in of sister Justine you know a few weeks ago and she came back with her father and she was prayed for because she had a migraine before service and she was in so much pain that tears were streaming down her face with her eyes fully shut she was in so much pain she couldn't even look at anything and she sat there for almost 2 hours with her eyes screwed shot tears streaming down her face she didn't need to be here in that condition anybody would have said sister Justine you can go home it's too much but you know what sister Justine did she drew a line in the sand and she said I'm here to tell Satan whose side I'm on I'm here to say I'm reading my name out of the scripture that says by his stripes I am healed I'm here to take my benefit from the time that he took at that whipping post and after 2 hours she was completely delivered from migraines that she'd been suffering for for 11 years sometimes we let him walk all over our Terr territory and all we need to do isay draw a line in the sand and say no more you have to leave amen if God's A Healer let him be a Healer if God is greater than Satan let him be let him be that amen if we want a testimony we've got to go through the test amen if we just want to be like everyone else then we'll be like everyone else but if we want God to do something greater we've got to give him the opportunity to do something greater in our lives now I looked up that word potential it means what is possible or achievable having or showing the capacity to become or to develop into something in the future now brother brandham at the end of his ministry it's on December 5th in in 1965 and at the end of it he preached a message called things that are to be and after all the signs and wonders after all the theology after all of the preaching he would say this simple phrase he would say these things that are now are only potential calling for things that are to be everything that he'd seen and what would happen is he would talk about what is preparing us to go over because what we have here is only a taste it's only a portion it's only a little bit of what we're going to have but he says everything here is to prepare you for what's coming and that means that we can't stay where we are today there's supposed to be gradual growth there's supposed to be maturing they're supposed to be changing he's saying there's more to be had than what we've had doesn't matter how long we've been serving the lord doesn't matter how long we believe this message doesn't matter how great the Ministries we've been under it doesn't matter there's always more that's supposed to be out there amen and it's to prepare us for eternity because we're going to be very naturally inclined towards eternity when we get there this world is not our home we're pilgrims and strangers and everything that God's doing is preparing us to get out of here not to stay here and so often we focus on the blessings of God that make life comfortable here rather than the ones that make us ready to go over there amen you know there's a multi-billion dollar industry that's focused on bringing people to their potential and you know you think about these things and we have educational institutions we have government programs we've got commercial products we've got trainers and teachers and mentors and all of these things and they're all focused on telling us how to get to our potential they're trying to make us the best that that we can be and Everywhere You Go someone's trying to sell you a product or a service to make you skinnier to make you stronger to get make you smarter to make you more employable to make you look better to make you feel better whatever now they're not in it for you they're in it for themselves they're in it to make money they're in it to gain for themselves but the lie that every one of them will tell is that you can have what they have or you can be what they are you know I like to work out and so you see this you'll see this Ultra lean ripped guy and he'll say buy my program and you can be just like me but that's a lot because that man lives and breathes what he does and it's his only job he spends hours and hours all day every day in the gym he takes all the perfect supplements he eats all the food that is perfect for what he's doing everything he's doing is focused on that and then he'll tell me if you do what I tell you to do for 30 minutes a day you can look like me no you can't for one thing his genetics are probably the best of anybody in the world and there's only a couple in the world that could match him you can't put in what left out but he'll tell me I can make you just like me knowing full well that he can't do it knowing full well that I can't do it amen you know it doesn't matter how many lessons I take and how much I pay and how much time I put into it I will never sing like brother Joshua Columbo ever I can get better than I am but I'll Never sing like him because he's starting at a higher level because he's got something I don't have in the first place but I could go to a music teacher or a voice coach and they'd sayure I can make you do it but they can't because I don't have what he has and I never will I can't change my physical voice like that he has what I don't have but here's the thing as Believers we've all got the same potential if we're true children of God because our potential is to make it in a resurrection and a Rapture our potential is eternal life amen our potential is to manifest the word of God in this age and every single one of us has has been given the same potential to make it amen to go over there we're going to show it in different ways and we're going to have different roles and different things to do in this world but each and every one of us is going to make it if we're children of God Amen and it's not a lie and it's not a it's not something that God's in it for himself but he's in it for us to bring us to an expected end amen and we we're here to produce the word of God we're here to do what he has called us to do by the word of God and we're built and we're ordained to do it and there's something inside of us that is there to be drawn out and it's drawn out by the Holy Spirit now brother bran would say this in the unveiling of God he says the word is God and the word made manifest is God himself taking his own word and manifesting it among Believers he says nothing can make it live but Believers just Believers and we've seen a lot of waves go through message ranks over the last 10 or 15 years and we realize that not everyone that says Lord Lord not everyone that says William brandom William Bram not everyone that says message message is a Believer amen but those there are those that can't help it because they're ordained to believe and there's something inside of them and brother Braham says only Believers can manifest the word because it was in them from the beginning amen we have it because God placed it in us we're not grafted into God we're not transformed from pigs into sheep we always were what we are but it takes a an experience it takes a relationship it takes a a face-to-face contact with God God that causes us to Humble ourselves to the word to yield ourselves to the word to bring out that life that's within us amen that's why we can humble ourselves is because there's something in us that responds to the word when it comes forth amen but it takes that personal experience with God and we see it with Moses we see it with David we see it with Samuel we see it with Jacob and they were always a Believer they were always a son or daughter of God but it took a personal face-to-face experience for them to realize who and what they were and who and what God was as well amen and that's what each one of us is looking for brother B would say this in the Easter seal he says it's the earnest or the potential we're talking about a glimpse of potential this evening he says the quickening power of your Resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it this is the potential we're talking about we're talking about Resurrection potential we're talking about Rapture potential but that's the end of the whole thing and there's a whole process that we're going through to get us to that point anden I believe that last step will be quick and it'll be Qui it'll be short and it'll be easy it's all of this going through time and the waiting that's difficult but in the end when that call happens when that knock comes on the door and you realize that a resurrected Saint is standing there and it's going to be soon time to go everything's going to fall away real fast and easy at that point amen but getting there is what takes us that's the hard part that's the journey that's the battle amen but brother I I'm saying here this is not of your doing the potential you have is not because you you sat down and you went to church and you read your Bible or these things but it's because God put something inside of you and then he quickens it by the Holy Spirit and that's what makes the potential come to life and as soon as you get that Holy Spirit that's really when the clock starts ticking that's really when you start living for the first time because now you are in a you're a new creature in Christ you've been born again you're a child of God and you recognize it and that's when things really start to happen amen and we've talked about this before in a full series on restoration but God gives us his spirit for one purpose and one purpose alone to restore us back because it's the earnest of our Redemption it's the earnest of our Salvation it's the down payment of what's going to happen at the very end that's why he gives it to us is to take us all the way through to the end into full Fellowship into full relationship and to be the way that he intended us to be to rule and reign with him now brother Brown would say this in the invisible Union and we're doing a lot out 1965 tonight he says if you're a born again Christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's word coming on word on word on word and word and come into the full statue of Christ that's right so he can come get his bride word on top of word on top of word on top of word brother John I've been serving the lord for 40 years 40 years plus more word plus more word plus more word church we're growing till we get out of here there there is no rest there is no end to the battle we're going to be fighting all the way through and we're going to be growing all the way to the end amen he says we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord now we've still got to work we still got to make a living we still got to raise families and we got to go on vacation and buy houses and fix things and make things and do all of these things amen but in it all we have to understand one thing it's there to help us get through God will use our jobs God will use our families our marriages our life situations to help us come into resurrecting and rapturing Faith so that means it's not always going to be easy but he's going to use it and I've seen it in my own life where you start out with a great job and it ends up with a horrible job but through it you learn something and you learn to die out and you learn to give up things and you learn to trust and you learn to lay down you learn to walk away you learn to be quiet you learn to speak up sometimes and he uses all of these things to develop us amen and it's not just me but it's you and I can't get you to heaven and you can't get me to heaven but as a body he'll work things in our midst Amen to draw us into that character that's required for a bride that's going into resurrection and a Rapture but the big question is how do we do it how do we come to our potential how do we come to what Paul was talking about in Ephesians 3 there where we come to know the breadth and the depth and the height and the length and all the blessings that God has to be revealed in US Paul said this in Philippians 3 he says but what things were going were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dong that I may win Christ our potential is Christ it's full restoration it's full relationship it's face-to-face contact but he says to get there I had to suffer the loss of all things and he didn't say that they were not valuable but he says I count them as not valuable I count them as worthless he says and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him one and the power of his resurrection we want that don't we and the fellowship of his sufferings no no I don't want that Lord no no no this is part of the scripture now he says being made conformable unto his death he says if by any means Church what are we willing to give up what aren't we willing to give up Paul said by any means I could attain unto the resurrection of the Dead Paul says I'll do anything to be raised at the end he says not as though I'd already attained it either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I am also apprehended of Christ Jesus he said that I could be what he says I am the way he looks at me the way he sees me the way he knows me I want to be that what he said about me what he's declared about me in the word I want to be that in the end that's where I want to rest is that I would come on the other side and he would say Well done thou good and faithful servant you became the image that I had for you amen he say because of that he says Brethren I count not myself to is apprehended but this one thing I do how do I get to my potential brother John this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I press I press well I pressed yesterday Press today I'm tired you got to keep pressing I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we tend to think of press as big moments but the greatest press is the day byday pressure One Step a day is better than 10 steps every year in one moment the everyday step see we look for the big moments and I've talked about this before we look for the big moments but the greatest thing you can do is just do one step every day one step every day and you know what before long you've gone a mile and if you try to do the mile in that hard Terrain in one day you get worn out maybe CU it's it's tough and there's no path and there's lots of things in your way but if you can do one step a day you'll get there it's the people that leave it till the last minute that don't make it you can't do that you got to press every single day amen don't wait for special meetings don't wait for special speakers every day say I'm going to take one foot more into my property I'm going to kick Satan out one more bit today just push a little bit every single day we'll talk about that what it looks like even victory in the believer's Life as we go a little further and but he says this is Paul's thing he says I press but then he says in verse 15 let us therefore as many as be perfect as many as be mature be thus minded so in other words don't let just that just be Paul's way of life but let that be our way of life don't say well that was good for Paul he's the prophet of the age he's got the greatest anoint no no no you're Anointed with the same thing if you got the same mind he said and if anything ye be otherwise minded God shall shall reveal even this to you that's the grace of God he's saying if you don't have this attitude if you're not inclined towards this then God's going to come out and he's going to grab a hold of you and he's going to bring you to this place because that's what's needful to overcome to press the mark amen he said forgetting those things which are behind that word forgetting means neglecting no longer caring for so in other words Paul said I'm letting go of everything I'm not going to rest on what's behind me I'm not going to hold on to what's behind me but I'm going to press forward to what's ahead and that's a resurrection and that's a Rapture that's eternal life that's awaiting for me at the very end of it he says I'm not going to let any of it hold value we can't rest on yesterday's Miracles we can't rest on yesterday's testimony it's good don't forget it use it to cheer yourself up Moses talked about a book of remembrance I was going through my my devotions book and I have a a a list of prayer requests and then I have a list of answered prayers I had 60 1 major prayer requests answered last year in this church some you knew I was praying about and some you didn't know I was praying about 61 in this little congregation major things that we've been praying for that happened that's a wonderful testimony we're not talking little things we're talking some very big very serious things people on death door people where the doctors don't know what's wrong with them people changing jobs people with relationship issues people unsure of where they're at in Christ people with addictions and deliverance and provision and Leadership and all these different things it's a wonderful thing but don't rest on that rest that he's calling you forward rest that there's more to be had amen Paul said I'm just laying that aside praise the Lord for it but I'm moving on because he's got more for me but listen to this we're talking about forgetting those things which are behind brother Abraham says this you see we want to hold on to everything that we can and then follow Jesus he says but sometimes Jesus wants us to turn loose of everything so we can get both hands on him isn't that just like us as humans I'll take as much as I can plus Christ that's our human nature that's our human nature but he says no no no you got to like go of everything and only to his cross cling hold to him trust in him don't have backup plans say Lord I'm trusting you Lord I'm trusting you completely he says sometimes we think that just because we've got a hold he says we want him to have all of us so therefore in all to do it we just have to walk out there by faith and believe him that's all and just trust we can't explain it there's no way to explain it we just believe it and take it like that you know what that means Church we're going to face decisions and we're going to face choices where we can say I'm going to take Jesus I'm going to take Jesus plus he says the way you're going to get ahead is choose him and him alone that's the greatest testimony when you give him full trust and he proves it right by his word that's the testimony of a Believer is I laid my life I laid my decision I laid my faith family I laid my finances I laid my job I laid my education in his hands I gave him priority and he backed it up every single time amen we're talking about a glimpse of potential a glimpse of potential is when we say Lord I'm Letting Go and I'm going to trust you and I'm going to trust you and every day we make a choice do I trust or do I try and do it myself and that choice is either going to lift us higher or it's going to drag us down because the more we hold on to the more or we get dragged down cuz we can't do it in the end anyways it's not going to be us that does any of these things Paul said I'm leaving it all behind the consequences of not pressing are worse than if I compromise or slack off I've got to keep pressing I've got to keep pushing Paul said this you know we we've got to accept that our present condition is far worse than what awaits Us in other words it can only get better the further we go Paul said this in Romans he said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in Us in other words it's not even able to be spoken of in the same breath shouldn't even cross your lips what you're going to be what you're going to have versus what you're going through now you know when I spoke at sister Edna's funeral you know a couple weeks ago I said I don't think she's over there in a Celestial body saying I wish I'd done something different but you know who is people that didn't make it to heaven we don't want to go over there and say I wish I'd done something different we want to go over saying I'm so glad I didn't do anything different amen trusting holy to him in these things you know we talked last service about how our attitude would change if we truly understood that we cannot be defeated defeated ultimately we may lose battles it seems and you know it's not that we lose battles it's that we think lose battles cuz remember God's got a plan and a purpose for everything right remember when Moses when the children of Israel were fighting and and Moses as long as his hands were up they won and when they dropped down then they lost what was it showing it showing we need each other cuz as soon as he had a couple people to hold his hands up then they won the victory completely God was just showing them a a type in the shadow in the scripture for our admonition but God will allow things to e and Flow you don't see every scripture showing that the victory comes immediately or that there aren't es and tides to the to the battle there's highs and lows there's valleys and mountains there's time where it looks like he's not even there and there's time where we're so sure of it we don't even it's it's not a worry it's a Flawless Victory but through it all he's still there through it all he's still there amen you know when you look at professional athletes the biggest game that they're playing is mind games and they say the greatest athletes are those that believe they cannot lose they cannot lose they believe in every situation no matter how bad it is how far down they are that they can always come back and win and they have people and they spend hundreds and thousands and millions of dollars working with the mindset of these professional athletes to try and get them to a place where they have confidence in themselves all Christ is trying to do is get us to have confidence in him and when we have confidence in him he puts that confidence back towards us that we can trust because he's our Warrior he's the he's the the great Champion that we're looking for we're not trusting in flesh we're not trusting in ourselves we're not trusting in our testimony to make us through amen but we're trusting in the Holy Ghost quickening the word inside of us to get us through all of these things but what if we start thinking as Paul said about what lies before us CU he didn't just say it's a glory that'll be revealed to us he said it'll be a glory revealed in us that means there's something that's going to come through Us in this time not just in the future not just at the end that's going to be glorified amen and it's through us and it's God wanting to express himself through the children that he's put on this Earth brother B puts it this way he says the head of every one of the attributes of Sin is Sin he says and when Jesus come dealing with sin at Calvary he killed sin and he killed every attribute that goes with it and completely redeemed us back back to God the Redemption Part is perfect and complete but there's a process that's happening now in these fleshly bodies he says and today today we are Sons and Daughters of God perfectly Redeemed by A Perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ amen he says oh that makes me glad to think about that but he says now we have not got it in full that's true but we have the earnest of our Salvation so listen up now because he's going to tell us the consequences of not having the fullness he says we've got the earnest we've got the down payment but we're in a body that's not redeemed and so he says there's consequences to that our Soul's converted but our flesh is not so listen to this we're talking about a glimpse into potential he says now we are not past Temptation neither are we above sin one of the biggest Hang-Ups I see especially in in young young believers is that they're tempted and they think that means they're not a Believer or they don't have the Holy Ghost the scripture says Jesus was tempted without sin but he was tempted because you got to understand that temptation is not a desire temptation is a choice something is placed before you and you decide yay or nay you decide speak or be quiet you decide stay or go you decide stand and be counted or sit and not it's just a choice temptation is just a choice it's not wrong brother Bram says you can't stop birds from flying over your head but you can stop them from making a nest and he says Satan's going to be there on one shoulder and the holy ghost's going to be on the other and they're both going to be chirping at you and you've got to make a decision and temptation is a decision and that's all it is it's not wrong to have Temptation he says but Jesus will help us in every Temptation so he says the consequence of only having a portion is that we can be tempted he says say and he says neither are we above sin but Jesus will help us in every temptation but then he says and now when I do wrong I'm ready to repent if the prophet knows he's going to do wrong what about you and I failure is going to happen at some point we're human we're living in flawed flesh don't let that beat you down he says anyone he says as now when I do wrong I'm ready to repent anyone else is that wants to live right with God you don't desire to do wrong but when Satan upsets you somewhere he says because there's an atonement waiting for me that's why he's quick to repent he says if I confess my wrong God's just to forgive it and the same thing is when you've got sick he says it's no sign that you're immune from sickness Believers are not immune from getting sick clearly clearly he says but in every time God is willing you to deliver to deliver you from that sickness see your sin is no different from sickness cuz sickness is an attribute of sin and he said Christ defeated all of those and the atonement is there for everything see we look at atonement as I did wrong and the blood covers it no no no every attribute of sin is given to you under that atonement of the blood Deliverance healing provision whatever it is whatever you have need of that's found under the atonement of Christ he says every time you go to you get sick you go to God and ask him and then he's willing to Del deliver you because there is an atonement he says it's based upon your faith in that atonement which is your Redemption and if we know that this joy that we have just being the earnest money on what lays ahead what will it be when we draw the full benefit of the policy he says what will it be he says my some people say how people scream and shout and act when the Holy Spirit gets on them I wonder really what it will be when we get to Glory no wonder they said they sang the song with Palms in their hands hosan glory to him that sits upon the throne hosana singing waving Palms he says that'll be a marvelous time and if just the attributes makes me feel like I do sometime what will it be just having a Taste Of Glory makes us feel like we do sometimes what will it be when we get the whole thing amen what will it be like when we experience the full Victory where we say death where is iy Sting grave where is thy Tre is we're soaring through the air what's that going to be like I don't even know how to express what I think that's going to be like can you imagine brother Mark we're going through the air Nan is next to us sister golding's on the other side brother Manuel brother Nelson guy whoever it might be and we're going through the air and we know it's done it's finished completely and the fullness is there what is that going to be worth what is that going to be worth to see this disappear like a thought just boom one minute we're there and the next we're not I don't think we'll shut up for a long time he says I'll have a different body to stand he says it's a one sure thing when I know a Temptation comes up and I'd flee to him my refuge and then God delivers me from that Temptation and sets me free my heart rejoices and the glory bells ring I look back and think oh God how did you do it not how did I do it how did you do it he says how happy I am he says you know when you're really badly tempted on something if you'll just make Jesus your Refuge shut your eyes and pass right by it it'll be the sweetest experience you ever went through we're talking about a glimpse into potential what is the potential here to face every Temptation and turn it into the sweetest experience you've ever had to take your trials to take your Temptations your hard times your difficult decisions and turn them into a place where you get closer to God rather than get frustrated or depressed or angry with God where you look at as an opportunity to be closer to him to get a victory you've never had before rather than down in the mouth in the Y me this time the greatest the sweetest experience you'll ever have there's potential to have it he's saying but you've got to decide are you going to close your eyes and walk on past that Temptation and experience something you've never had before or are you going to give in and get that thing that just hinders you every time and doesn't really feed you like you want to anyways I've been there church I know what it's like to give into temptation and you never walk away satisfied you always walk away feeling worse than when you started he says skip it and go into Christ your refuge and you'll have the sweetest experience you've ever had cuz what happens is you make that decision once he knows you're serious you keep making it and that desire just goes away it just leaves I can testify of it I can testify of it where it ain't there anymore you don't deal with it why because sometimes you literally close your eyes and walk away but you say not again not here that's not who I am and you walk away and you go back to his presence amen don't worry about whether or not you're tempted you're going to be tempted we're tempted every single day Satan's very good at that but worry about what you do when you're tempted and say I want to be in his presence more than I want to do this thing or have this thing amen think about it you've got an opportunity to slam the door in Satan's face and they'll go have a nice little chat with Jesus to sit down cuddle up and Satan can be outside and he can be raging and screaming and pounding on the door and you don't care you don't hear because you're safe in a place where you know that you can have everything you have need of and you're satisfied to be there that's what the whole world is looking for is satisfaction and we can find it without having anything that they have amen don't feed your Temptations for Pete's sake don't feed your weaknesses don't feed those things that tend to hold you back and distract you you know just in thinking on the service is not so much the good and bad that we're dealing with anymore it's distractions that's where we're at we live Sanctified life Satan has to come to us in a in a subtle way see we're looking for the big frontal attack and he doesn't he comes in subtly subtly and you don't realize how much he's gotten in until you start realizing where your time's going and all of a sudden you're like oh how did he get in you know what they call call today day when you get on your phone and you go go go they call it Doom scrolling cuz you'll go from app to app from screen to screen from thought to thought from video to video for hours on end and you won't realize how long you've gone till you look at it and it's 1:30 a.m. and you realize I did it again it's distractions you know it was funny today I was I was at Costco with Jensen and there were some things going on and I was texting people then I got a call from Joe and I couldn't pick it up I was in the middle of something and I was all stressed out cuz I couldn't answer his call right away you know how silly that is it's a distraction I'll be down having my devotions and people are texting and what do I think well I should answer them no don't we don't need to if they really need it they'll call my wife or they'll call me and they'll come through and say I've got a need but otherwise we can put the distractions aside there's potential to be in his presence but the problem is is we have these things on our wrists and these things in our hands that are constantly interrupting us amen Satan's got us so wrapped up you know I was I I really messed up my back and I had to go in for massage therapy today and everybody's on their phones you're in Costco and everybody's on their phones they might have their spouse or their boyfriend or their girlfriend or whatever their kid there and everybody's on their phones they have to be entertained he's got them so wrapped up around that idea of never having a quiet moment that people can't just be quiet you know when I went moose hunting I I I don't get a chance to listen to other ministers very often but as I was driving out brother John Andy service was firing up so I decided I was going to listen to him and I picked up a hitchhiker and I said now it's my vehicle so I'm just letting you know I'm going to be listening to a service that a friend of mine's preaching in Washington so you know you can choose to stay or go he said no that's fine I need it more than you and then he promptly fell asleep but he preached a service called Stand still and it was rubber meets the road down home preaching about how Satan has got us so busy so busy that we can't take time to actually sit down and talk to God I highly recommend it if You' got time go back I put it in the in the in the group chat on WhatsApp but if you're looking for it just look up the service John Andy stand still and you'll find it it was it was just such a nice message for us to be able to sit back and get quiet sometimes that's we need just sit back and get quiet start dwelling on the things of God Amen so don't feed your Temptations don't feed your weaknesses don't feed your discontentment feed your faith feed your faith read and hear what God says about you that's what's going to bring you to your potential you know they they have those Veggie Tales and they've got that little worm that's listening to those motivational tapes and he's listening to the motivational tape and the motiv the guy the motivational speaker says you are a skilled metal worker and he says I did not know that about myself well sometimes God's telling us things and we didn't know that about ourselves that's why we need to read it remember scripture says stir up your pure Minds by way of rembrance keep reminding yourself because I'll tell you what Satan's doing a great job at reminding us of a lot of other things we've got to keep pushing back and feeding ourselves with the thing that pushes back his thoughts so we can take on the mind of Christ brother Braham says this he says this is where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics back he says all Dynamics and no mechanics so he's talking about isza Street Pentecost he says back there was all Dynamics and no mechanics now we've got all mechanics and no Dynamics he says see we've got to put it together we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on Creed it won't burn it jokes up chokes up the flu and it will not burn it it was made for the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so we're supposed to live by the word of God and he's saying it's not by the letter or not just by the letter amen because it's got to be by the life it's got to be by the word the spirit of the word of God because that's what's got life in it it's got Direction and discernment and provision and all sorts of things baked into it to keep us operating the way we ought to be he says this machine needs to be fed the word of God to make it give it to make it do its thing amen it gives us strength it give us gives us purpose it gives us Faith to say God you said that's what faith says God you said and when something else comes up God you said the word says it is written it is written you know as I was dwelling on these things I was reminded of a a crushing machine now I'm sure many of you haven't seen a crushing machine but you see they've got those uh on the outer edges they've got just kind of H teeth there but in the middle you have these rotating drums that have teeth on them and what they do is they'll take anything and they'll put it inside these and they got them of different sizes and ranges and power and these different things and small ones are used for just doing basic recycling where you're doing cardboard or or aluminum cans or these different things and then they've got them big enough to where you can take a car and put it in and it'll just turn over and it'll just completely destroy the car just turn it into into tiny little bits you know and you can put just about anything into them you can put anything of any shape or size or material and it doesn't matter what it is in time those crushing machines will rip it apart you know you can you can put something in there that's a weaker material you put a cardboard box like that and it's easy you can put something in there like a propane cylinder now propane cylinder is made out of metal it's very structurally rigid and it's smooth so it's not easy to grab onto and you put them in there and you'll see what happens now watch these two cuz this guy puts them in this way and it sucks them in right away boom crushes them flattens them out doesn't even slow down but you look at that one on the right there and it sits up there and what happens is those wheels keep turning and they're trying to grab and that thing just bumps up and just and so it keeps going it keeps going look at those other ones they're flattened there completely and that one's just riding on top sometimes we're going through things in life and you see something happen immediately and you're like praise the Lord then sometimes you have something that just seems to not you can't get a hold of it look at this that's what it's like but do we give up do we give up this thing floated for a while and then it grabbed and it was made the same as the rest of them flat as a pancake and you'd never know what it was by the time it was done amen you can't beat a crushing machine because it's got power all the time and it'll rip R anything apart look at this this is a motorcycle a complete motorcycle an old motorcycle granted but this is a complete motorcycle and they're feeding it in front tire first okay this took less than 15 seconds that's the tire and the rear brake going through 15 seconds it reduced that thing to little chunky pieces you can't beat a crushing machine that's the way Believers are supposed to be when it comes to Faith in the word of God is you just keep feeding it and you keep feeding it and you just keep turning and turning and turning I watch one where they put a full car through you know what even the biggest machines will choke up one of those with a car but you know what they do back it off a bit and then they go at it again back it off a bit it gets chugged up clogged up a bit they just back it off a bit and then they rotate it in they'll put a complete car through there no problem and just little pieces coming out the end we're talking about potential but it takes faith brother Bram says you got to feed the machine you got to feed this machine with the word of God you got to keep it strong you got to keep it powered up you got to keep fueling it can't wait just for church services and then it's got to be a day by day it's got a step by step just a constant constant churning they say about the Roman Legions that's what made them so difficult was they would stand there the charge would hit them and they'd get pushed back a little bit and then they'd get anchored and then they just start stabbing and walking and it was just one step at a time they'd step hold stab kill everyone there one step step and that's all they did one step at a time and they destroy armies that were 2 three four five 10 times their size just because they were an inevitable crushing machine you couldn't get them couldn't get through their ranks you couldn't get them off their position couldn't get them away from each other they just stayed there and time and time again just simple steps stay in information do the same thing do the same thing do the same thing and nothing could beat them that's the way we're supposed to be feed every day defeat every day have Victory every day amen we're supposed to destroy anything that comes in our path that's the way it's supposed to be amen remember Daniel saw a stone that once it started rolling nothing could stand before it that's Stone was Christ and we're a part of him we're a part of an inevitable stone that destroys everything in its past in its in its path Amen brother Bram says so here we stand a church commissioned on the last commission the last thing that Jesus said to his church the last commission given go ye into all the world and Make Disciples of all Nations he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned he says and and is a conjunction to tie your sentence together and these sign shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it will not harm them and if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover he says so why should we have to stand in the presence of some Heathen God and take a defeat brother Ram made no exceptions the word makes no exceptions Jesus never said there are some devils you will not defeat there are some diseases that will will not be healed there are some situations that cannot be Revol resolved he said everyone all no exceptions some go through easy some aren't so easy some take a lot of faith some take a little faith but the inevitableness of the word of God is what we're trusting in Amen brother man puts it this way he says now we must remember it's God but when God has said anything it's the truth hold right on to it it's got to happen he says if you weaken then unbelief will take over he says but you stay with the word what you got to feed your faith faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God faith comes by understanding and understanding by the word of God what causes us to weaken when we stop feeding on the full word of God Amen when we stop fellowshipping with the saints Saints when we stop prioritizing God in our life when we give other things access when we put God in second place what's he going to do then we placed something else ahead of him how can we defeat something that we've elevated above God we can't cuz we put it there we've got to put it back and let him have the preeminence amen what causes us to weaken is when we stop looking at the word and start looking at symptoms and circumstances and that's the thing that's so easy to see because we've got five senses that are really good with circumstances and symptoms amen that's why we need that super sense that brother Braham talked about amen but the hardest time to feed and it's ironic the hardest time to feed is when things are good because you say well what do I need God for I'm talking humanly speaking now carnally speaking we don't feel the urge to have devotions we don't have the the urge to pray so much often when things are going good when money's in the bank when when our health is great when the family is doing well when the jobs are going great there's no problems in the church everything's hunky dory that's when we need to be feeding because that's the rest that's the time when we we have the opportunity to get strong because when the battle hits we're going to be scrambling we're going to be fighting someone's going to be in the hospital and we're not going to have all that time we're going to be dealing with family situations and stress is going to be there and we're going to have to be battling the symptoms and the way to do that is to get yourself healthy before those hit and man you want to be healthy before the battle hits you want to be fit before the battle hits you don't want to be using the battle to get fit cuz that doesn't tend to work out very well amen the calm times are when we need to be feeding you know brother Braham said David was prayed up before Goliath came so that when Goliath came he didn't have to go make things right he didn't have to go straighten things out he didn't have to go down and find out what God wanted him to do amen he knew what he was supposed to do brother says he never prayed a prayer he never offered nothing he knew he was anointed amen he was anointed and that slingshot had proved the right kind of thing he had faith in his anointing he had faith that God could direct that rock straight in the middle of that helmet there where the only place could be hit he was standing there he knew he was a good shot he knew God had made him that catch that he knew God had made him capable of defeating Goliath God had given him confidence in his calling confidence in his anointing confidence in his position it says amen he knew he had killed a lion he knew he had killed a bear but that was his father's Earthly father's possession here is his Heavenly father's possession amen he didn't get down what must I do now Lord he spoke and said you'll be like The Lion and the bear and here I come amen glory to God yes sir he spoke and went forward to meet this Goliath when God gives you a testimony that's to prepare you for the next battle that will give you your next testimony and you're supposed to say as he defeated you last time he'll defeat you this time as I won the victory last time I'll defeat I'll defeat you this time I'll win the victory this time God's victory in the last circumstance is to prepare you to believe for victory in the next circumstance God's Building us up in our faith and in our experience but it's always potential it's always taking us a little bit higher a little bit deeper a little bit closer so that we can trust him completely amen now catch this he spoke and went forward to meet this Goliath regardless of his size who am I we need a preacher to handle that we need a a super Ministry to handle that we need a prophet on the scene to handle that no if you're there then God has said you're there to handle it regardless of his size he says he says he was a little Ruddy looking fellow you know he wasn't very big we're talking about a glimpse of our potential it is not by what we see in the mirror that's not it he says he wasn't very big now regardless of his size and his so-called ability to do so we have natural gifts but that's not going to cut it he says you know the bishop told him said now look here son that man's a theologian he's a fighter he was born a fighter he's been a fighter from his Youth and you're no match for him and his brother said oh you naughty thing come out here and do such a thing as that get on back home you got people telling you you can't do it cuz you're not special enough and then you got people saying you're doing it for your own good and for your own influence and and your own agenda and all these different things David didn't listen to any of it he says that didn't bother him why he knew he was anointed Why by experience he knew he was anointed because he had the effects of that anointing and the victories in his life you say brother John I don't know if I'm anointed what has he done for you if you got a victory if you got a testimony guess what you're anointed cuz there ain't anybody else doing it that's not anointed you're anointed to overcome you're anointed to have the Victory and whatever he places in front of you regardless of your size regardless of your so-called skill gift or experience you are ordained to deal with it by the Holy Ghost by the spirit of God according to the word of God he knew he was anointed the god that delivered me see it's not about him the god that delivered me from that lion the god that delivered me from the paws of that bear heill more than that deliver me from that Philistine here I come I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel amen he didn't pray through he was already prayed through now catch this there's a dual meaning here David's done his part but catch this he says he was already prayed through why cuz God prayed him through before the foundation of the world and what's the proof the proof is that he was anointed the proof that God had prayed for him the proof that God had ordained him was in the anointing on him that was calling him to go forward and meet that challenge it wasn't just words it wasn't just a thought it wasn't just a feeling there was something in him that was pulling him to the battle amen it says his he was anointed for the job he had to speak and go forward that's all there is to do about it just speak and go forward oh that's all there was to it God had prepared David God had anointed David God had given David experiences to prepare him to have faith for this great moment he was anointed with a king and he did a king's job here amen David's confidence was not in himself his confidence was that God always always delivered him we think of third pole and we think of adopted Sons me me me no it is Christ in me the hope of glory it is the Mighty Warrior inside of us the all-conquering Christ in me that gives me the victory it's not about me I trust him and he does the work I have faith he does the performance amen David believed he was facing Goliath because God wanted him to chop Goliath's head off that's why he move forward amen that's a that's a change of attitude I believe we need is that we're facing something because God wants us to cut its head off not to bow before it not to back away listen a woman is supposed to be meek and surrendered to her husband to her husband not to other men we had a situation way back when where a man tried to tell my a brother tried to tell my wife what to do and he said I'm a brother you have to listen to me she said no I listen to my husband amen women don't have to be pushed around by other men they run to their refuge and my wife speaks in my name just as the wives of the men here speak in their name and they have the full authority of their husbands behind them to protect to provide to care for all these different things amen don't face the trial with a Grimace and a frown face it with the idea of this is going to be really awesome when I have a testimony now that's something you got to feed that's something you got to feed attitude you've got to feed oh my do I say it you ever run into somebody who's got a great attitude about themselves overinflated you know why they feed it but you need to feed it as the word would feed you not hype faith based on solid evidence of the word of God Amen brother Braham says the angel love that song only believe remember what the angel told him at the beginning he says if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer the goal is to get us to believe that takes faith and Faith only comes one way and that is by the hearing and reading of the word of God that's the only way it comes it's the only way it comes it won't come through podcast it won't come through YouTube it comes by the word of God and it's a person to person contact between you and him amen David was so anticipating this victory that he ran towards Goliath I don't know about you I'd walk real carefully to a trained warrior in thick armor with only one little spot where I can kill him I'd walk real close he's got a spear that's massive he's got a sword that I can barely lift he's got armor he's got a shield Bearer he's got all these things I would walk very carefully expecting him to make a move David ran to Goliath that's how confident he was in the outcome he ran cuz he wanted to get it done this wasn't going to be long he knew the end before it happened and his actions proved it amen he knew he was in the will of God why because God had prepared him to move forward in this situation he knew he was there for it and so he didn't hesitate he walked into it brother says this now on Easter morning there was another light that struck the Earth he says when the Holy Spirit was given this is the power of our potential that's what brings the word to life in us the word's there but it's the holy ghost that brings it to life he says and it's given to bring light to those seeds that God by his forn knowledge knew would be here on the earth and he knew the first natural seed he knows where the spiritual seed is your body was laying right here on the earth when God brought forth the earth into existence we're part of the earth we were laying there and by his forn knowledge he knew exactly who would love him and who would serve him and who would not his forn knowledge tells us that he says so you see people making their blunders they stumble at it they run at it and they think this and that we're talking about knowing your place here he says but it doesn't work right we see that have you ever seen somebody try and be something in a church when they weren't called what did they do they stumble at it they run at it they push and they pull and they influence and they do this and that and it never works out why they weren't meant to be there but he says but there is a working right he says and yet that's to find God's perfect will and stand in it what God called you for you say brother John how do I know that one do you have the Holy Ghost if you do sons of God are led by the spirit of God and if you are following his will and his word then you are where he wants you to be you're in his will that's your adoption position and we'll get into that in many services in the future where brother BR would say you might be a farmer you might be a wife you might be a mechanic it doesn't matter you're there as an adopted child of God and whatever crosses your path you have the authority to defeat it doesn't have to be a dad praise for the child mama has got just as much Authority amen doesn't not be a preacher that comes and lay hands it can be a husband any brother any sister has Authority in the Kingdom of Heaven to push Satan back if thou can't believe you just can't fool around with it that's all you know we've got an identity crisis that needs to be resolved brother Brown says when the bride recognizes who she is the rapture will go that means we've got a ways to go that means there's more to be revealed that means there's more to be understood there's there there's more to experience scripture says we're Kings and Priests we're intercessors that means that we can go on behalf of somebody else and it has an effect not everyone gets to do that only sons and daughters get to do those things we're lights in the world Jesus said we're here to help those that can't help themselves but we've got to resolve our identity first before we can help somebody find theirs we've got to know who we are we've got to understand where we're positioned we've got to understand what God's trying to do in our lives amen and the only way we can get it is by the reading and hearing of the word of God it's simple it's simple and people that read the word and listen to the word regularly you'll find they've got faith when the moment comes CU that's the way it works it's so simple it's so simple it's not super Ministries I was talking to a brother the other day he says I think we've entered the age where the super min Ministries are going away because it distracts Too Much from the Simplicity of the gospel and we rest too much on gifts instead of coming into that personal face-to-face contact with Christ where we know that our prayers as good as any other ministers and any other man or any other woman that a child can have the same Authority on their knees Before the Throne of God that the greatest Minister on this Earth could have at the same time there's no difference you're both children of God you both have access amen the more I read it the more I realize who I am who he is you know whenever you start with a new company they give you a benefits booklet don't they and you know what you do you read through that because you want to know what's available because you don't want to leave any stone unturned any dollar unspent when I the last company I worked for in BC every year they give me $2,000 for what they call the health spending account and I could spend that on sports equipment I could spend that on gym equipment I could do that on on on all sorts of things it was wasn't just going to practitioners and doctors and that and I use that to the max we bought salmon fishing rods for that why cuz I went in and I found out the little details of what I was allowed and not allowed to do and I used it to my best advantage that's what reading the word does now it's not about using it to your best Advantage you got to find God's will but this will tell you what you're supposed to be doing and that what you're allowed to be doing and it'll give you your Authority it'll give you your marching orders and it'll give you Faith to do what he asks you to do amen it's a funny thing how the more you read it the more you'll get out of it the more it'll Quicken to you and I've said that before you know we we tend to say well well I'm not having devotion so I'm going to do an hour a day no do 10 minutes get used to it build it up you'll get used to it and guess what it'll it'll it'll Quicken that thirst it'll Quicken that hunger inside of you and you'll start to want it more and more and that'll keep you going rather than trying to cram it down your throat at the beginning man give them time to work brother Bram says but if there is a hunger in your heart to see God there isn't enough devils in all torment to keep you from seeing him he will make a way where there's no way if you really want to see him and you're honest in your heart she he's talking about the Queen of Sheba the Queen of Sheba had to think of those things but when Faith takes the to satisfy your hunger amen blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen if you got a hunger then he's got something to satisfy it we're in the season of knowing who God is and who we are that's really what the final Revelation is remember brother BR would preach uh on Christ as the mystery of God revealed and it was God above us God With Us and God in us the last bit is God in us amen that's Revelation 108 that's God coming down and unveiling himself in flesh and that's what's supposed to be going on Amen and we're in the same season of knowing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever as brother brandham did just listening to that message why are people so tossed about and he's talking about the third poll remember and he talks about that little room and the angel said I'll meet you there but it wasn't only brother brandham going into that little room there was only room for one and it was individuals going into that little room meeting with God oneon-one and they come out and they were completely healed and they said what happened we don't know all we know is what happened we don't know how it happened we don't know what made it possible but we walked in one way and we came out another and what was it it was in the personal presence of Christ revealing himself to them doing the work and brother brandham had his own experience with his stomach being healed and these different things but it's a one-on-one brother brandham was a sign and he talked about my message is to declare him that he's here Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 but that wasn't just in his ministry that's for your life that's for my life that's what we're looking at is Christ alive in our situations where we don't have to go to a prophet but where we know that he's alive and well in me that he cares about me he's filled me with the spirit he's leading me he's guiding me amen like Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able why cuz he's with us the captain of the host is with us amen and he's the one that's leading us amen he's saying if there's a hunger you say Lord I want more I need more I see more that means there's more to be had there's potential amen but that takes submission that takes surrender that takes yielding that takes humbling ourselves to the word of God brother Bram says the Way Up Is Down Paul said let go let go release and let him take hold and start moving amen what is it yield to the word by the Holy Spirit and what that does is that puts the control in his hands instead of mine there's that song that says Jesus Take the Wheel that's literally what we're doing is we're saying I'm going to just back off and I'm going to let you lead lead and guide doesn't mean I'm never going to do anything we're not just sitting like a lump but we're to be moved by him and then it's him that's doing it not us that's doing it cuz we're walking with him as he leads us along amen then we don't have to try we just have to yield and then it's him that's doing the work brother R's talking here of Georgie Carter you remember her she was one of the the great miracles of his of of his ministry and she had tuberculosis for 9 years and 6 months in a bed I think he said she was down to 47 lbs which I don't even know how that's possible because that's basically bones and skin and organs I don't know how somebody was alive but he said she could barely even move her head and go oh she couldn't even spit that's how sick she was he said some of them said how did she she walked brother brandham I said the power of the Living God held her up remember she got up out of that bed and walked she didn't have any muscles there's nothing there to move her he said the power of the Living God held her up she just became submitted to the power of God that's what's the trouble friends at night when you see me your brother under Vision there's nothing else in the world that's nothing else in the world but submitting myself to the Holy Spirit he said you that sick can submit yourself to the holy spirit so completely that you'll forget your sickness we're talking about potential you say brother Jonathan how's that possible all I know is he said it and I believe it that you can be what so submitted to the Holy Spirit you can forget your sickness you can completely submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and no Affliction can hold you you walk by the power of the Holy Ghost you are well you give your testimony and everything else he says you're healed by the power power of the Holy Ghost you that's sinful maybe drink and smoke and gamble put your poison in here whatever your if there's a besetting sin or a habit and do things like that you say I can't give them up brother Bram yes you can you just submit yourself to God one time remember I was talking about Temptation you close your eyes and walk by one time and watch what God does to honor that he says and just yield your whole self to God and watch what takes place that's the whole thing there's no secret in it it's not a hocus Pocus the only thing is to submit yourself to God Amen there it is and then it's not you any longer see see that takes the pressure off that takes the pressure off when you say Lord I've tried and I can't do it so stop trying and just say Lord I'm here for victory Lord I'm here for deliverance I'm surrendering myself to what your word says now you do it if you're sick of the results you've been getting how about you give it to him that's what he's saying here he says then it there it is it's not you any longer it's the Lord the Lord does it after that he said God will move you just sit still and let God do it see that's right have faith in him he'll work it out all right he said the power of God is here to transform you from sickness to health now watch this he says God moving on in The Exodus of his church this is why I say things like I don't believe there'll be any sick people going to Resurrection and Rapture obviously not a resurrection but a Rapture because if God's moving on if he's bringing you to a place where every aspect of Satan's influence is being removed from your life then how can you be sick how can you be sick there's no exception given in scripture for sickness that can't be healed so he says what is it it's God moving on in The Exodus of his church he's preparing us to go he said she's coming into the blossom where God will gather after a while his grain he says it's wonderful coming out of the darkness Into The Marvelous Light how we love that it's not about Comfort or riches or ease amen it's about moving on that's what this potential is about potential is about moving on it's about stepping up we don't go to people so that they'll make us worse and we don't go to people we ought not to go to people so they can tell us we're doing great where we're at but we go to people for help to bring us to a higher level that's what potential is doesn't matter how good or how bad you are there's always a higher level there's always a higher plane of Faith amen there's a higher level of Fellowship there's a higher level of believing there's a higher level of surrender there's a greater humbling that we can have amen and I want to finish on this one quote and the musicians can come if they want I found it so inspiring when I read it and I've held it and I've held it and I've held it and I just want to share it with us tonight as we finish on this thought of a glimpse into potential cuz I want you to see what God sees in you that's how you know your potential is what he tells you about yourself cuz his is the only truth his is the right whether you see it or not whether you agree with it or not what he says is right now he says this he says there are devils but Jesus cast them out and he gave his church authority to do so to cast out devils in my name he cast Seven Devils out of a pretty woman one day and he said when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man walks in dry places returning back then bringing seven other Devils with him he says now that goes to show that if the man was cleaned of devils there was something in him had gone out a devil had gone out now when the devil moved out that gives God an opportunity to move in so when he goes out let the Holy Spirit come in don't just leave it there if you do just repent of your sins and go on then you're going to be worse off than ever but get that place where Satan want once lived and occupied and get it filled with the holy spirit of God and then you'll have the strength of God's word in you manifested to cast out Devils he said the contest is on the evening lights are shining God's holy spirit is present let's stand together if we would he says then as we leave this building to go to our different places and our homes to meet outside and to meet the world let's not go as we have in former times this is our New Year's message don't go out the way we came in not that what you came in as was bad but don't stay there he says let's not go as we have in former times let's go in the power of his resurrection let's go in the name of Jesus Christ with a banner lifted high and have faith in his word to handle the two-edged sword with the shield and the full armor of God on to meet the enemy why because he's getting stronger and more powerful every day if you stay the same he'll defeat you you've got to grow you've got to strengthen you've got to mature he said as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against him if we have come to the end of these things that the mysteries of God have been completed with us have we are we at the end mysteries of God should be finished Revelation 10:7 says if they're finishing he says then we are looking for more strength a rapturing strength to meet a worse Force don't look for things to get better but look for a greater strength a rapturing strength that'll Rapture the church and take it into Glory he says we must have it butat this he says let's meet this coming year with a challenge we are the Servants of the Living God that's not potential that's position we are not just servants we are children we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God he says let's go act like it let's go out knowing who we are he says and like Shadrach mhach and Abednego of old will not bow to the Devils of this world and take back this thing that we've talked about he said but let's press the battle amen that's my heart's cry it's a new year and I'm not one for for New Year's resolutions you know like somebody said that's the things that people make so they can break them and that's all it is is resolutions and resolutions won't get us anywhere but a sincere heart a humble heart a Hungry Heart that's what God responds to a broken and a contrite spirit somebody that says Lord I want to come up higher Lord I want to make less of myself and More Of You Lord I want a testimony that I've never been able to have before Lord I want a witness for you Lord I want to see a greater reality in my life Lord I want healing Lord I want Deliverance Lord I want peace and contentment Lord I want a different attitude we've covered all of these things tonight attitude matters how you spend your time matters who you spend your time with matters how you look at things what you dwell on all of these things matter but what matters most is there's a cry in your heart there's a cry in your heart cuz that's what he's looking at is the cry in your heart and that's the response that we'll get is when we have the right cry in our heart amen amen let's bow our heads if we would Lord God lord I've held your people long tonight Lord are not all easy things to say but Lord through it all there's a light there's an encouragement Lord there's a Promises of your word that we've read Lord that there's a glory that's going to be revealed in us and even now is coming forth Lord Lord that there's an overcomer Lord there's a richness in your presence Lord there's a shelter in a time of storm Lord there's a position and an authority that comes as children of God and Lord this year we want to walk forward Lord in newness Lord we want to come up higher Lord we want to step away from this world Lord we want to set aside those things that easily beset us Lord we want to Humble ourselves more to your word we want to surrender ourselves to your will Lord to the leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord we want souls to come to your kingdom Lord we've got lost loved ones we've got people in this community that need you Lord Lord would you help us to be a bright and Shining Light Lord may we get up every day Lord with the intention to take one more step towards Lord the kingdom Lord that we would push Satan out one bit at a time every day Lord that we would look for victory that we believe for victory Lord that we'd feed ourselves with your word Lord that it would fill us up and push out everything that comes against us Lord give us Faith Lord give us patience in the time of struggle and trial and battle Lord and give us an attitude Lord that just rests in your unfailing goodness and Grace we pray Lord would you bless your people this night we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen Higher Ground 355 I'm pressing on the upward way I'm pressing on the upward Way New Heights I'm G in every day still praying as I'm onward bound Lord
