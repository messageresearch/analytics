we ask just another touch lord this evening lord as we go into your word lord that it would lift us up to a higher height lord in a deeper depth lord in your word and your love and the reality of god in our lives lord jesus lord may you just bless us with your personal presence here tonight lord remembering the many needs lord those that aren't here or remembering the many services lord starting up lord we pray that you would just minister through each one and to each one we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it this evening amen and amen amen god bless you thank you musicians and then turn the scriptures to philippians chapter 2 if you would philippians chapter 2. amen certainly good to be home be back in church i missed each and every one of you yes even you brother paul amen he always wants me to mention him from the pulpit so i don't think he meant that way though amen but it is good to be home certainly we had the lord's traveling mercies i can say that anybody that's traveling be ready for delays delays and then more delays amen but he gives more grace and we left here we were an hour and a half late leaving which meant that we missed our connection in toronto if all things went as planned but he delight that flight by an hour and a half so we got in just fine and made all of our connections and coming back and all these different things so we certainly appreciate that amen it's good to have sister lily back from her holidays and brother mark and sister maureen from their trip amen and then we know brother bob and we'll be coming back on sunday and brother chad in the family on monday so we want to remember them as well i was sorry to miss the the the baptisms of sister elsa and sister mary beth but certainly we uh we give god the glory and the praise for that amen amen it's a it's a wonderful thing to see them give their hearts to the lord and even sitting in there and hearing samuel give his joyful noise there tonight amen the world teaches teaches the children there's so much that's normal and then there's so much that's acceptable and they can take them to the football games and the hockey games and they can yell and scream and paint their faces and do all these crazy dances and everything and that's perfectly fine and we want to teach them that it's fine to worship god amen that it's it's fine to believe in a in something that you can't see but that you know was real and these different things and then we want them to come to a reality of god in their lives so we're so thankful for that of course and for brother levi's baptism as well amen just trusting god we'll bless them each one and fill them with his holy spirit and draw them into a relationship with him amen and then certainly good to have brother josh up here tonight again it's uh i i had sent a message to the the group chat there while i was away i i checked in on the first service and joe was up here late and i said what went wrong and he said he didn't say anything he just said long story but i checked the next one and sure enough brother josh was up here so it's good to have him up here and putting his shoulder to the wheel amen i think brother mark certainly appreciates it more than any of us so amen it's good to good to have him up here and sister elise it's good to see you as well amen god bless you and then turn to the scriptures tonight philippians 2 verse 3 says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men amen god bless you you can have your seats this evening amen i've been dwelling on some things while i've been away and by god's grace i didn't study a lick while i was away i took a i took a real vacation i didn't make any plans for preaching or anything but while i was sitting there in the airport trying to leave newfoundland and i just had so many things going on my mind so i popped open my laptop and typed out six pages of notes real quick while we were waiting and then came back yesterday and sat down and just worked all day to to prepare for tonight so it's good to be back in the saddle this is where my my happiness my joy is is certainly in serving this way and tonight i want to take a a title of in his form and with his mind sorry brother there we go in his form and with his mind amen and i i believe we're at a time where there's a full representation of jesus christ on this earth if i could start that way and say that we had a representation when he when jesus christ walked this earth and then we saw the fullness of god walking amongst us and we saw paul there and we saw the disciples and we saw a representation that came there but we have a promise of this age of a full representation amen and the prophet said that all that god was he poured into christ and then he said all that christ was he poured into the church so there is a full representation that's here but it's not going to be in one man or one woman anymore but it's going to be in a body amen a multi-membered body and we're in a season of the fullness of times and then when as gentiles as as non-jews then this is the fullness of times this is the climax of the gentile age of the gentile dispensation amen and there's a lot's been done and there's a lot's been said but now is the time for the fulfillment of everything that's been written in the scriptures about us amen we're living in the worst of times carnally speaking there was never a time that was as bad as this maybe you could say when he wiped everything off the face of the earth then that may have been close to it but at this time he's not just going to wipe everything off because he left some light but this time he's going to destroy everything with fire and then he's going to start completely anew that tells me we're in the worst of times but at the same time we're in the best of times and then spiritually we're talking about a time where we're going to have more than one person walk off this earth without seeing death we're going to see a representation of god in a multi-member body instead of maybe just one here at a time or one there at a time but we're going to see a multitude of people that are the expression of christ in this age amen amen the best of times was not when the prophet of god was here you know we've got people that really believe that because that's what they go back to time and time again is they're always looking backwards at a profit and the great signs and the great wonders and those were wonderful things and then if they have a revelation they'll say well it was the opening of the word and that was a tremendous time but it was the opening of the word by letting us know what had gone on and it was letting us know what was going to go on but now we're in the times of where what was going to go on is going on amen and that's more wonderful than it being opened is when it's happening to us amen when we're a part of what's been happening of what's supposed to happen and when you're a part of that prophecy being fulfilled when you can step into the word not just look into it and say i believe it but look into it and say i'm a part of it that's the most wonderful time to be alive and i believe that the best of times is that we're in now not just the opening of the word in terms of the intellect or the mind or by revelation but by experiencing men we're in the opening of the word by experience that's where we want to be amen but when the prophet was here was just him really he was starting a whole new movement he was this he was starting a whole new revelation there was a a breaking open of the seals and these different things and it was just him and brother branham would say afterwards he said i don't think there were maybe five or ten people understood what i was talking about in that pulpit right he talked to billy paul billy paul did you understand what daddy said yes sir he said now billy paulie said did you understand he said no sir why because it wasn't the time for him to understand but there's a time now for us to grasp these things and take it and not just understand it with our minds but take it and let it live in our lives amen brother branham pointed to a time where there was greater things coming and the greater things coming was not the revelation of the word in terms of understanding what's written but it was the experience of the word it was the manifestation of the word in a people that would take it and live it and become a part of it amen amen now i want to go back to just kind of dig into this thought as we set the tone for the next couple of services lord willing and just hold your scriptures in philippians 2 and it says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind that each esteem each other better than themselves so he says let nothing be done there is no time or no place for you to do anything through strife or vainglory because paul's setting us up for the mind of christ he's setting us up for the mindset or the approach of christ and paul gives us a warning up front and he says don't start with what i've written here don't start with strife and don't start with vainglory and it's interesting because strife we would maybe think that's you know people butting heads and friction and these different things but when you look into the root word that word strife means electioneering or positioning for office politicking or a desire to put oneself over uh forward so paul's saying you don't go around trying to step into things and putting yourself forward them and telling people why you ought to be there when we have elections every year we don't have the deacons or the trustees or the sunday school and superintendent or any of these people they don't go around telling everybody why they should be in that position do they i could think quite frankly we wouldn't vote for them if that's what they were doing was going around and telling us because we're supposed to be able to look at their lives and see why they should be in that position we should be able to see the gifts evident we should be able to see the life that's there we should be able to see the sanctification that's there and we better be able to see the holy ghost in their life if we're going to put them into those positions so by their life we're supposed to know them by their fruit we're supposed to know them and yes they can volunteer for but they shouldn't be going around trying to get people to vote for them that's what paul says anything you're going to do for the kingdom you don't politic your way into it right you just let your life speak for itself you can volunteer by all means amen we want to offer ourselves i remember a pastor saying that he wanted volunteers for anything that was happening in the church why because somebody that volunteers has something inside of them that says i'll i'm willing to do it and that's all god's looking for many times is that willing heart he's looking for somebody that'll say hey i'll try i'll do it if somebody wants to use me then i'll do it and sometimes you're doing it because you have a gift and sometimes you're doing it just because you're willing to put it put yourself out there sometimes all we need is a warm body you know they say some jobs to get it all you have to do is fog a mirror you know how you do you know how you fog a mirror you just have to be breathing right and there's jobs we have in the church sometimes all you need to be able to do is fog a mirror we just need warm bodies we just need some some strong back some capable muscles these sorts of things you know but what our life is supposed to be our testimony that we're suited for whatever it is we're looking for and then after that we're looking for a willing heart and then it's up to god to place us into any position or support role that we would put into brother braham said this way he says they found out that peter and john were ignorant and unlearned men they weren't educated neither were they smart but they had to take notice that they had been with jesus why because the spirit that was in jesus was in them doing the same things that jesus did taking the same kind of motive so often we focus on the signs of wonders but brother brahm takes it a step further he says they had the same spirit and it was reflected in what that they took the same kind of motive in the actions that they were doing because you can do the right thing for the wrong reason and that makes it wrong right now you can do the wrong thing for the right reason and that's still wrong but if you do the right thing for the wrong reason you're in the wrong as well you've got to have the right motive and the right objective and brother branham points us to the apostles he said they did the right things with the right motive and objective he says in everything that jesus had that's what they had you don't have to be smart you don't have to have an education you just have to have a willing heart then he says god sends his faith down and his power faith is power and we're to earnestly contend for it but we talked about strife but walk with brother branham or walk watch what paul says here because he says don't do anything through strife or politicking he says or vainglory and i believe if we get down to the root of so many things when you see people pushing for a role when you see p people pushing for a position then they get upset when they don't get it this is often the root of it and that word vainglory means soundless self-esteem empty pride or vain opinion of oneself in error so in other words we think more of ourselves than we actually are we think we have something that we don't have or we think we have more of measure of what we than what we really have and i can speak for myself certainly especially in the last 10 years of my life and the changes that have happened and the calling into the ministry and these different things i'll let you in on a secret you're rarely as ready as you think you are because when i thought i was ready guess what nothing happened almost every time whenever i thought i was ready nothing happened you know how i know i wasn't ready because god didn't move me forward god didn't move me into a different position god didn't move me into a different place god didn't progress me forward but he left me where i was because i wasn't as ready as i thought i was gonna i needed to be amen god didn't move me on even when i thought i was good enough and then maybe i waited longer and said well surely that was enough no that wasn't enough he left me there until he was satisfied and then he moved me on and that's when i was truly ready but i guarantee you so often what it is is we're more sick of the battle and we're more sick of the backside of the desert experience and that's what makes us think we're ready rather than the fact that we're actually ready god knows how to train men and women to serve him amen god knows how to break us down and get us ready for use in the kingdom of god and he knows how to grind us down so that he can have the preeminence in our life and get our own stinking thinking out of it amen and his timing is almost always different than ours is certainly the timing that we would choose because we don't like the trials we don't like the testing we don't like the proving we don't like the isolation we don't like the hard work that goes into these things amen but paul says there's an antidote to this and he says it in verse 4 he says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others in the amplified it says let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not merely with his own interests but also for the interests of others so it's not wrong to look to your own self you have to look after yourself amen can you imagine if if a preacher is all run ragged and he's his health is poor and he he's so out of sleep and he's so out of energy that he can't get up here and preach that doesn't do us any good he's got to look after himself doesn't he but he's also got to sacrifice himself for the needs of the believers i'm pretty tired here you can see my left eye is smaller than my right it's red i had a bad allergic reaction when i went to mow the jungle i call my yard after two and a half weeks and then we're still on california time so i don't have a lot of sleep i don't have a lot of energy here if i continued like this i wouldn't be of much use to this church would i i've got to take care of myself but i've also got to give myself and that's why i'm here preaching tonight is because this is my place of duty so i've got to get up there regardless of how i feel but i've got to take care of myself as well but paul says don't just look to yourself because that's going to lead to strife and vainglory but he says when you look on the needs of the other people when you look at to care for the others that are around you that's going to be the antidote to strife from vainglory because you're going to be so busy doing things for other people and taking care of what needs to be taken care of you won't have time to get lifted up you won't have time to get worried about who's doing what and and what you're not able to do amen but we see here that the mindset if we look in verse 4 the mindset of christ the mind of christ is first and foremost to serve right he came to serve you never saw christ building himself up into some big thing he never elevated himself he never turned himself into anything he did what the father told him to do and whether that raised him up or whether it dropped him down in people's estimation it meant nothing to christ and then he did what he came to do and that was to serve the needs of those he was sent to amen it's interesting because many people if you talk to them will put a minister if you talk to christians they'll put ministers at the top of the food chain if we had a a pyramid of hierarchy we'd say the ministers are up here many of us but you know what the word minister means the word minister as a verb means to serve and the word minister is a noun means servant so ministers by definition are servants you know we have we have prophets and apostles and evangelists and pastors and teachers then we have a prime minister we have a minister of education we have a minister of defense we have all these different things and what happens so often is that they forget that by definition they are there to serve and what they start doing is leaning to their own desires and their own interests and doing what's best for them and you get countries that turn into what canada is turning into why because they're doing what's best for them rather than what's best for the people when we put somebody in as a minister they're there to serve the people they're there to serve the people's interest to do what's best for them and they're to give of themselves for the best for what's best for the people amen so the ministers are here to serve the people i'm here to serve you brother gerald's here to serve you all these different ones that come in they're here to serve you but i want to say this that just because we serve you doesn't mean you're over us nor does it mean you're our masters but just because we're ministers does not make us masters either amen the ministry served the five full ministry we serve the people but we don't answer to you we answer to god amen amen we answer to god we get our orders directly from him and you can tell that because we preach sermons that none of you may want to hear at times and then we say things that are very uncomfortable for us to say we get into uncomfortable positions not because we want to but because we're compelled to because we're compelled to serve in whatever way that he calls us to serve amen but in psalms 103 21 i just want to anchor that he says bless ye the lord all hit all ye his hosts he says ye ministers of his that do his pleasure so the minister is confined to doing what what is god's pleasure amen so we're here to do what he asks us to do we're here to preach what he asks us to preach we're here inspired by what he has told us to do amen and that's the only way that's going to going to work because men get into trouble when they start to do what they want or they start to preach what the people want to hear and then the scripture talks about people heaping to themselves teachers heavy itching ears right they want them to preach what they want to hear and that never leads to anything good what it leads you to is a denomination because god's put out and you have men running the show in second corinthians 3 it says in such trust we have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also had made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the spirit killeth but this for the letter killeth rather but the spirit giveth life anytime you see a man come into the pope and start demanding other people what is that that's the letter right it's not anointed when he gives the letter the letter of the letter but there's no spirit you've got to have spirit behind it and that's the holy spirit to make those words live and to let them find the kind of ground that god has meant them to to land in him and we're not masters pastors are not masters they're shepherds and they answer to the great shepherd amen and they give their lives and they lay down with the sheep and they guard the doors and these different things they give their lives they give their comfort they give their health they give all of these things to the benefit of the sheep that god has entrusted to their care amen amen so i want to say above all this if god calls you to do anything he'll give you the heart of a servant when it comes to that thing amen you may get benefits from it listen there's benefits to being a minister guess what you get to eat first most places you go if you're a minister that's a benefit but i didn't become a minister so i could eat first right i didn't i didn't become a minister so i could maybe sit at a certain table or in a certain chair or get first pick of who i ride with or who i fellowship with i mean there are benefits to serving god i'm not going to say there aren't amen but the purpose that we always have is to serve if we're going to be called to do anything amen and and paul says you do that by esteeming others needs you lift them up you elevate their needs to a level that makes them important in your life and they supersede often the needs of ourselves amen now paul starts to get down to where we live and he starts out with his warning and this admonition but it's because he's setting us up for a new mind and he's saying this is the mindset that you have as a human in your carnal nature it's going to be a towards strife and vainglory it's going to be towards lifting yourself up it's going to be for doing things that make you look good but he says i'm setting you up to take on the mind of christ so you can't have this and the way to get past that is to what put others above yourself but now in philippians 2 verse 5 he says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus so paul's showing us a shift in our thinking because he's not just talking about the new birth but he's talking about the experience or the effect of the new birth now because if you have the new birth then something's going to change in your thinking and then there's going to be a new approach there's going to be a new way of looking at things and paul says it is through the mind of christ and paul says in order to have the he says the new birth experience will give you the mind of christ that's what he's talking about here right you've got to have the same spirit that was in christ and if you have the same spirit that was in him then you're going to have the same mind because that's going to come under what the rulership of that holy spirit paul says you've got to have what the mind that was in christ jesus and that's a big thing to say when we're living in a body that's two-thirds corruption and then a body that that can't be redeemed in and of itself he takes our soul but he gives us a new and glorified body because this body can't be redeemed it's doomed it is too full of sin he can't do anything with it so we've got a theophany waiting for us amen but he's talking to people that are stuck in this doom flesh that still have struggles that still have battles that still make mistakes and he's saying you have to have the mind of christ that's quite a thing to say if i asked you today do you have the mind of christ maybe satan would throw up all the things that you've done in the last week or month that maybe didn't look like the mind of christ was working you and say well how could you have the mind of christ but paul says you need to have the mind of christ you've got to take on the same mindset that he had there amen and the thing this is that so often many times what the key to to what we need to overcoming is to have the mind of christ is because this points to who you are it points to what you are and it points to the purpose that you have in this life and he says the mind of christ has this it says who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god so he says you've got to have the main mindset the same mindset that christ did and that's that he was in the form of god and didn't think of robbery to be equal with god so i just said what would happen if i asked you if you have the mind of christ now i've got to ask you do you have it in your mind that you are equal with god because christ had that he thought it not robbery he didn't think that he was taking on himself something that he shouldn't have by saying he was equal with god paul says you've got to have the same mindset that christ did now that word form means the external appearance that which is seen representing the unseen right i want to take some time to dig into this because this idea of the form of god because i want about talk about christ and then i want to talk about us because there's a parallel there if we can see it and i want to take us back if you hold in philippians because we'll be there for a bit but in john 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god so he's pointing us back to the mindset of christ he's pointing us back to how this all works and i haven't preached on godhead here and maybe i'll do it sometime but john is taking us back with a prophetic eye to what happened way back in the beginning he has an approach different than matthew mark or luke if you notice he goes all the way back to the beginning and he paints a picture that goes all the way up to the end amen john was a tremendous visionary god gave him such a gift amen and john takes us back and he says in the beginning before anything else was was the word amen he says that was the beginning of it all was the word and the word is the full expression of god to us as humans as believers that is the full expression of god to us it's the defining attributes of god to us god is in his word and god is his word that's what we see brother brown would say it this and he's talking about in the beginning he says so first he was god jehovah that jehovah means self-existing one he says now let's just picture now a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic light like a halo and that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning that was the son of god that come out of the bosom of the father and that was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he says in the beginning was god and out of god come a logos a part of god that went out of god now again i'm not going to get into godhead too deeply here i just want to kind of cover this quickly to anchor it in and then brother brown says god sent the great holy spirit forth the logos that went out of god the theophany of god so what is a theophany a finney is what it's a glorified heavenly body it's a dwelling place for our souls i mean it's the perfect body that we're going to be restored to when we leave this earth amen it's the true dwelling place of every soul this body that we have is not jonathan corlett amen the body of jonathan collette is the theophany that's waiting for me over in glory that's the real jonathan we have the real soul here but we have the real body over there and that's what this one's longing for amen but you see here that we have god he he says god's out there and it's just this this dark blackness because god's a spirit you can't see a spirit right you can't see his spirit but he says out of that god that you can't see comes what a visible representation of god so god makes something that you can see now something that you can sort of interact with something that you can identify with your senses and say there's god now that doesn't mean all of god is there but it means there is the representation of god there is the visible portion of god that he made us able to see and interact with right so that's what brother braham says was was what was meant in genesis when he says let there be light he says when he said let there be life that was the logos coming out of god and it was a visible light that god could dwell in amen the light wasn't god but then god stepped into that and when you saw the light you saw god that was the only god you were ever going to see was that light because otherwise god's invisible right but he made something that we could see and interact with amen it was god dwelling in a body and and the scripture teaches us and the prophet teaches us that body is jesus christ right that's the son of god is the dwelling place of god it's the visible portion it's the manifestation of god now colossians 2 9 says this it says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily it's speaking of jesus christ all the fullness of god all the fullness you think the fullness would be enough he says all of the fullness so everything that could be put in a body that was god was put into the body of jesus christ amen so in jesus christ dwells or lives the fullness or the entirety of god in a body so jesus christ is the dwelling place of god and whether it's an angelic form whether it's in the pillar fire form whether it's in the corporal body of christ on earth that's where god has put his name and his presence so when you see that body that's where god is amen so that's the only god we're going to know that's the only god we're going to know when you see these things brother braham said jesus christ is the only god you'll ever see because that's what god created him for was to dwell in him so we could see him and interact with him it says here in john 1 verse 3 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men so christ made everything he says through that body through that light through that dwelling place that's how he created everything it was made through christ amen and in him was life and that life was the light of men let me put it this way it's not good enough to recognize the light lots of people see the light listen when saul was walking down that road and the light knocked him off lots of people saw the light lots of people heard the voice but how many recognized that was god you've got to have the light amen you can't just recognize the light you've got to have the light inside of you and it has to be life to you it has to be the only life inside of you if i could put it that way it says and the light shineth in darkness and the darkest comprehended it not that word comprehends means it didn't overcome it darkness cannot be spread and darkness cannot be created amen we can have flashlights that spread light right you can go to canadian tire and you can go buy a flashlight but guess what you can't buy a flash dark you can't buy something that gives you darkness darkness is only the absence of light darkness is defined as the absence of light so without light you automatically have darkness but you can't take darkness and spread it over light the light will overcome it every single time amen light always defeats darkness and and what he's saying here is if you have that life if you have that light inside of you then it will defeat any darkness that's inside of you amen what does it take to drive back darkness let the light in amen what is the light for us it's the gospel it's the word let the word in and that will drive out the darkness in our life see man open up that room open up that door let the light in and it will show you what needs to be taken out and it'll drive the darkness back every time you know why we have besetting sins so often because we don't let the light in what we do is we sit there and and i can say this from experiences often we don't admit that it's a besetting sin that we have what we do is we do it and we repent and we do it and we repent and we do it and we repent and we neglect to realize that we are under the dominion of a spirit that's got a hold of us and that's why it's called the besetting sin is we haven't defeated it it's something that's continually working on us over and over again and we repent do it again repent do it again and what we need to do is let the word come in and say this is not just a sin this is a besetting sin this is a spirit that's on you and you've got to let this be taken care of you need a deliverance from this you can't just keep repenting all of your life but you need to let the light in and shed the darkness out push the darkness out so that you don't have to deal with this anymore amen we are people that ought to have deliverance not just repentance in our life we don't need to be coming to the altar every time we don't want to be going to the bed every night and saying oh lord i did it again i did it again i did it again but we ought to be looking to let the word have a deliverance aspect in our life to let the light shine in and take us out of it amen what is it we're believing a lie we're believing that this is just something that i have in my life rather than there's a spirit on me that's what it is is we don't stop and say i have a problem and i need to get rid of what's causing this problem we think we're dealing all we do is we deal with the symptom rather than realize there's something in there that's causing that symptom and we got to get to the root of the issue it's funny because alcoholics anonymous has this figured out don't they now i'm not an alcoholic i've never been an alcoholic but what's the first step to alcoholics anonymous you stand up and you say hi my name is john and i'm an alcoholic you have to admit you have a problem right because if you don't admit you have a problem they can't help you in any way and it's the same for a believer if all you're doing is going for repentance and never deliverance what you're refusing to say is i have a problem right it's amazing alcoholics anonymous anonymous can get it but believers sometimes don't get it we've got to admit if something keeps coming back into our lives we need deliverance remember repentance is there to cover it the blood is always there to cover it but it's no way to live your life is going back and back again over and over again to the same old pig trough amen amen it says there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness to that light we've got the same problem with brother branham don't we people keep pointing to him as the light and they forget that he pointed to christ every single time he says it's not me it's not me i couldn't do it i can't heal you i can't discern i can't do anything it's him it's him and he kept pointing to christ and they had the same thing with john are you him are you him john are you him he says i'm not even worthy to undo his shoes brother brown said the same thing i'm nothing i'm nothing but when he's here he can use me in a special way amen he says he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world and then let there be light he was a light in the beginning and now he's a light for men that come into this world brother brown puts it this way he says now there is jesus as a big light if you remember in the beginning jesus was a light jesus was the logos that went out of god and he was the angel of the covenant that led the children of israel through the wilderness he was the pillar of fire when they looked at that they looked at and when he was here on earth he says i came from god and i go back to god so if he came from a pillar of fire into a man then if he went back to where he was he went back to a light again and there he was when paul saw him he was a light continuing in the scriptures he says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god amen you're born of god when we sit here in this church and we accept this message and we let it have a preeminence in our life it says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now listen to this it says in verse 18 we skipped a few verses it says no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him amen and then christ came out of the bosom of the father he was created out of god and he's the visible expression of god he is the form of god now that's a really long way for me to prove to you that jesus christ is the form of god he's the visible representation of god amen but i want to anchor that in the scriptures because we want to take that to our place and we want to see how we follow in that parallel amen it's god dwelling in a body a visible into a visible manifestation that we can interact with so whether it was melchizedek right melchizedek was it then you had the lord that talked to abraham while sarah was in the tent right then you had jesus christ you had the fourth man in the fire then you had the pillar of fire that knocked down saul this was all god in the representation of christ it was christ that walked down and and and broke bread and drank wine with abraham as melchizedek that was christ and he steps down you'll see him in many different things you have the angel of the lord as christ you have all these different things god can step into any form but whenever he steps into that form it's recognized as christ because what it's the anointed one it is the anointed one not unanointed one like we are but as the anointed one it is the preeminent anointing of god and so christ now is the external visible form of god and that's the only god we're ever going to see when jesus was on earth he said i come from god and i go to god and we know that he was the i am and the i am was that logos that pillar of fire and then when he went back to god and ascended up on high saul of tarsus was on his road down to damascus one day and that same light fell on him fell in before him and blinded him and there he was back in the form of a pillar of fire again he said i am jesus whom thou persecute us and it's hard for you to kick against the pricks he went from corporal body to a fiery body just like that nothing changed except that the external manifestation but it was the same god and it was the same representation was there like i said brother graham said in another place and i'm paraphrasing paraphrasing jesus christ is the only god you'll ever see we just read it sir it said it's the the son that it that that is the one that expresses him it's the only one that declares him as the son it's the only declaration you're going to see but john himself says it later in john 14 he says that philip sayeth unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us so you would say the father is god jehovah the original the og they would say today right he's the he's the first of all of this and philip says to jesus he says jesus show us the father and that'll be enough all we want to do is see the father and jesus said unto him have i personal pronoun been so long time with you and yet thou has not known me philip he that hath seen me has seen the father and how sayeth thou then show us us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake yes right we read earlier where it said he thought of not robbery to be equal with god he wasn't making himself equal as in i'm on the same plane but he was making himself equal as in when you see me you see god it was the equation that you can see me and that's how you see god that's all he was saying because he came out of it he was a part of it he was a created he was a the external was a created thing but inside of that was the almighty god amen it's like if we could take all of the ocean and pour it into a pitcher and that pitcher if i was holding that you could say that's the ocean if all of it was in there you could say that's the ocean now what i'm holding is a pitcher but the oceans inside of and that's all it was with christ was you have a body that had all of christ inside of it and when you look at that you say that's god because all of god is in there that's all he's doing he's giving us a representation he's giving us something that we can see and touch and feel in these different things amen what's jesus saying here he's saying when i talk god's talking when i heal god's healing when i'm walking god's walking when i'm reacting god's reacting there's no difference between me and him he's in this body and he's got such a control over and there's such a unity really not control but there's such a unity here there's such a surrender of this body to what's inside that what he says i do when he speaks i speak the way he says do it is the way i do it there's a perfect unity here so when you see me you're seeing the father you're seeing all of god that you'll ever need to see amen he says it's not me working these things it's the father that's working in me what was it the word became flesh in the beginning was the word and the word dwelt among us and we beheld his glory amen what was it jesus was saying look he speaks as the father he says philip listen have i been here so long that you don't recognize it's me when we go back to isaiah what was it i mean even in the body of jesus the body of jesus we see that it receive worship listen you can't worship god something other than god and god allow it but yet we look at jesus and the leper worshiped him and the woman the man with the sick daughter worshiped him the seraphim woman worshiped him his disciples worshipped him and he never forbade their worship why because they were worshiping the what emmanuel god with us god in flesh they recognized what was what that body really represented was it was the personal presence of god walking amongst them every one look at isaiah 9 it says what unto us a child is born that body had to be born it was a sinless body but it had to be born but said unto us a son is given why because what inhabited that was something that had already existed before that body was ever born amen it called they said that he would be called what wonderful counselor the mighty god everlasting father jesus wasn't taking something on here that the word didn't say but he took what the word said about him and that's why it's not robbery because the word said he was the everlasting father he was the mighty god that's why he could say it and not be robbery because the word said it about him that's why you can say things about you and that are in the word as well and it's not robbery it's not putting yourself up on a high plane it's not putting on heirs but it's taking what the word says about you and confessing it and when your life matches a confession then there's no doubt in your mind that you are what you say you are amen all that god was he poured into christ and then we see that all the christ was he poured into the church and we'll get into that maybe in the next few services amen but we all understand now hopefully what what this means about god dwelling in a body or in a representation called christ and that's who we interact with amen but we don't want to stop there because the story doesn't end with christ the story doesn't end with that body of jesus christ it doesn't end with the pillar of fire it doesn't end with with with the different bodies that he put himself into him and but he was the first fruit he was the firstborn among many brethren he was the wave offering he was a chief offering that went before us and we see paul in romans 8 he says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn what among many brethren so what he was there's more coming amen he wasn't he was the first one but he wasn't the only one and it wasn't just going to be brethren in terms of men but it was going to be men and women it was going to be sons and daughters of god following behind that were in the form of god with the anointing and the spirit of god to do the very things that god did through christ but each in their individual way amen it says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what then shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us what he's saying is nothing can stop this nothing's going to hold this back you look at yourself you look in the mirror you look at your condition you look at at your habits maybe sometimes and you say how can this be like mary of old how can this be but he says look nothing can stop this there's nothing there's no weapon that can be formed against you that can stand that's going to prosper and hold you back from becoming what the next line of what the many brethren that he was talking about amen he's called a people to follow in the footsteps of christ him and he's called out of people that are just like that one that we are so blessed to call a redeemer and savior now i cannot redeem you cannot redeem anyone that preaches that we can redeem is off the word you can't do it amen but you can point them to the redeemer you can live a life that shows that you've been redeemed that makes them want the same kind of redemption amen it's only under one man he died and the price was paid and that's the only redemption we'll ever need but what the redeemed then go out and say we're looking for more of the redeemed that don't know that they've been redeemed amen what is he's calling people that are called to act like him to walk like him to talk like him to live like him to be like him to be him to a dying world amen let's go back to the very beginning in genesis 1. because we want to see these parallels here and it says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his image in the image of god created he him so notice this is singular it's the original creative event and it says it's in his image not in his form it says in his image and then it says male and female created he them and this is the later event eve was part of adam originally in spirit form but when bodies were created they were separated out eventually so inside that spirit there was a a male form and a female form inside of it but it was a singular item in the beginning and then after that he creates the male and female and then he separates them out into the body but god says here i'm going to create man in my image and he does but what does he create god is a spirit scripture says god is a spirit right so he created here man as a mankind as a single spirit as well the first adam was the spirit and the prophet god says now watch we're seeing god unfold himself then he said in genesis let us make man in our own image what kind of a man was he he had to be a spirit man amen he says and then he put him in his five senses to contact his earthly home now i want you to catch something here the way brother brown's talking his language he's talking about god unfolding himself okay now pay attention as we go into this next quote because i want to show you something that's happening here he says but now god making adam and eve at the same time the only thing he made was the supernatural the spirit adam and the spirit eve the man and the woman and then when he put adam in here it wasn't good for he was going to say for him to dwell alone and they said see it's god's picture unfolding all the time so we have a spirit form of adam and he says now he's going to put it into body and this is what god's picture unfolding the picture of god not a not a resume of the ages he's talking about the unveiling of god now and he says it's god's picture unfolding all the time not just there but it's unfolding all the time everything like this it's just coming right down just unfolding right out coming out through the millennium over yonder and right on into eternity so he says this unfolding of god is going to go way past time and all the way into eternity so there's something else that's got to happen here he says it's just god's picture just unfolding god unfolding himself listen he's saying god's picture unfolding all the time he says coming through the millennium right on into eternity eternity right that's what we're going to talk about for the next few services lord willing amen i'm not just trying to show you what happened but i've got to show you what's happening and what's going to happen so that you can be a part of it amen he says here god manifested himself in christ jesus to show what he was what was jesus a man of sorrow acquainted with grief loving to the prostitute he said where are thy accusers i have none lord neither do i accuse you go and sin no more tired and weary from walking about 30 miles that day through the desert sands and things there was a woman of nane coming out and her only boy dead laying there he stopped the funeral procession laid his hand upon him and said rise and the boy who was dead rose up again that's our lord jesus he was never too tired and never too weary to do anything good amen now i may be getting a bit ahead of myself and the message that i'm bringing this evening but i want to ask you are you too weary or tired to do the right thing because you look at christ and every time he goes over and he says i have needs to go here and i have need to go there and i've got to do this and i've got to do that and what was at the end of every one of those journeys was what a battle a struggle a trial he'd do something and somebody would disbelieve somebody will reject somebody would make up stories somebody would try and kill him it was everything he tried to do right everything he did right there was always a price that he paid for that time and time and time again but he gave and he gave and he gave until at the very end he gave his very own life he gave the last thing that he had to give but he was never too tired to do the right thing he was never too tired to help somebody else he was never too tired to serve the purpose that he was put on this earth to serve amen and that's the mindset of christ that we're talking about is that if you're going to put your energy if you're going to put if you're going to tire yourself out put it into something that's worth talking about from a kingdom perspective from a word perspective when we left california every time we leave my my father-in-law he's a he's he used to be a pastor he doesn't pastor anymore but every time we we leave he he he has to pray for us and this time he said he said will you pray for us and then when you're done i'll pray for you and so i was praying for him as a before we left there and even when i came home that night and i was praying before i went to bed and i was just just thinking about what he's given for his life he's 80 years old now and he's given his health he can barely walk his knees are shot he has no real money to speak of he doesn't have a big home he doesn't have he has a house that has electricity only half the day and he has his chickens and his little plants and that's about it after 80 years and half of that preaching the message preaching the gospel faithfully pastoring he's given everything he has to the lord and now he's taken care of it's funny because my father's made millions and he has less to show for it than a man that gave everything to god but god has taken care of him but he doesn't live a life of luxury or ease he doesn't have a big 401k or an rrsp as we call it up here but he's taken care of and he has no needs by god's grace but he's given everything if he's broken he's broken because he's given everything to god but i sat there and i just i was thinking he's 80 years old and he offers no excuse he still every day studies the word so that he can give an answer for the hope that lies within him he just sent me a link while i was there he sent me another one today of him and there's a there's a man there he's not a message believer but he sees something there and he asks him to come and preach online for him to to an online group there and so he goes at 80 years of old 80 years old and he sits there and he studies and he preaches for an hour at 80 years old he's still not holding back he's still giving whatever he can give and he's always ready to give that answer he's always ready to give that testimony amen and i thought there what excuse could i offer that would stand up to that testimony i don't even have to compare to brother branham or jesus i can just look at my father-in-law a broken man that only speaks half english and yet look at what he's doing for the lord and i said to myself what am i holding back you know what excuse am i giving as to why i won't do more and then when i lay my head down tonight am i have i given my all to do something for the lord or am i laying down in my ease in comfort because sometimes i think we have it too easy amen and we're so we're so busy calling it a blessing that we're not using the blessing to do what further the kingdom of god amen i so appreciate what brother mark does with with going in and he listens to eight million sermons a a week and and goes through and he translates them and shares them with us and and he listens to the word of god and he sends those things over that will help us or encourage us or he sees i'm preaching something he sends me over something that'll maybe add to it in these different things what is it he's not sitting back he's not sitting back sister maureen still plays amen we still have people that'll still put their shoulders to the wheel we got a 70 74 year old pastor still got his shoulder to the wheel amen still showing up for church every service listen if there's people that could take time off we got some here that have earned it but guess what when the life and the light of god is in you you never get to stop because it's in you it's in you to share it amen do we know what we have do we know what we have and do we know how they need it i want you to notice adam here because remember he's made in the image of god and if you're made in the image of god you've got to follow the path of god the same path that god takes guess what if he makes a man his image he's got to take the same path and adam's up there and he's a spirit and i don't really know what that means to be a spirit i don't know you know can a spirit talk to another spirit i guess you can but they can't see they can't interact perhaps in the same way but adam's in the image of god but god had a path that took him to a form and that form was called jesus christ and adam had to be brought to a form as well why because that form had a purpose god didn't make a a form god didn't make the sun god god didn't make the the the pillar of fire for no reason but he used it to interact with nature he used it to create nature we could say and so adam has to he has a purpose he has a a reason for being there but he was without a natural form and if he's in the image of god he's got he would have been invisible to the natural world but he was made to be a part it says that he had to take dominion over it how can you take dominion over something that can't see you that can't interact with you so he had to be put into a form that would that would interact with and allow him to step into the purpose of god now if we look in genesis 2 and we're starting to close here my voice is going it says in verse 5 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground so i want you to look here because all of the conditions for growth are here the seeds are in the ground the ground is fertile the ground has all the nutrients needed right everything that you need for the plants to grow is here but yet the plants aren't growing if i could put it this way there's a drought on the earth the the creation is there but there's a drought nothing's coming forth why because the scripture says what there was no water and there wasn't a man so in order for it to come forth what was needed water and a man if water comes and a man comes then everything's going to step into place but until those come then nothing's going to happen the scripture says it infers here that without the water and without the man god wasn't going to hit the button to go right we've got a world that's ready to roll here but god hasn't put the batteries into it yet he's just letting it sit there amen but it says in verse six so the everything's set every the conditions are there for growth but nothing's happening but it says in verse six there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground so there was no rain there was no water in verse five and we know that water is required to bring the plants out of the ground but then all of a sudden god hits the button and there starts to be water so if you need water for it to grow and you need a man then guess what when god sends the rain what does that mean there's a man coming down the road isn't there if the man is needed and the rain is coming that means that there's an answer coming for someone to till the ground as well if god required both those things to be there and he sent one that means the other one's on the way amen and you can see that in life that where growth is needed god will water god will prepare the ground and then he sends a man or he sends a woman there to a prepared ground that's ready for life to what bring it to where it needs to be because we're the hands and feet of god we're the hands and feet of christ in these different things amen what was it it wasn't time till god said it was time and if i can say that to our own lives it ain't time till god says it's time listen we can have all of the things there for growth we can have all of the things there for moving forward we can have all the things there for for for for stepping forward into life but unless god says it's time you're better off waiting because when he says go nothing stops it but when you say go nothing happens all you do is you waste your time you waste your energy and you get frustrated right you don't go anywhere but when god says go get on board and start moving with it because things happen fast when god says go and when we read here what was the catalyst for the rain what was it that caused the rain to start the man was coming and he needed to have something to work with so god sent the rain so that when that thing came up the man was going to be there to take care of it verse 7 says in the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul what is it adam followed the form of god follow the path of god and he came into form now spirit stepped into a body spirit stepped into a form now you could see him feel at him right remember we remember brother brown says god gave adam what his five senses so he could what interact with his world now and that's what's happening here is the rain's there there's something for him to interact with so god puts the man there to interact with it amen god gave adam a form that matched his purpose do you know that he may he built him exactly the way it was needed to make the earth prosper and grow he gave him exactly the shape he needed and there's nothing like it on the on the planet you can talk about monkeys and everything but when you start looking at the ratios of arms and legs and all these different things i was at the san diego wild safari park there and guess what they had a monster silverback gorilla but he doesn't look like any man i know thank god that's a man that would never get married but what do you see you saw massive torso big chest big shoulders but the arms that go almost to the ground right because it's not built for plowing and for moving and tilling in these different things it's built for being in the trees it's built for something completely different but a man's built to work a man's built to work he's built to till the ground he's built to do what the purpose that god brought him here to do amen look at this in verse 8 it says and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed listen he had a whole earth that was breaking out into vegetation and all the plants and trees were coming forth but look at what he did here he said i've got a place just for you adam i've got a place that i prepared just for you to go and take care of he didn't say adam he didn't say adam roam the earth take care of everything adam he said adam i've got a place i've got a garden i've built just for you go and take care of that garden he had a place he had a time and he had a purpose for adam and he had prepared all of it specifically for adam the way he was built and the body that he made amen the world couldn't work the way it needed to until adam came on the scene the world needed a man to till it that garden needed that man in there to keep things in order because it'll what even though it's made by perfect god it will do what it'll take over itself it'll start to fight amongst itself vegetation will start to go and then one thing's going to die out because it doesn't have enough shade and something will get too big and it'll take over and we see it if you go down in louisiana for any of you that have been there if you drive on the highways you see these ivy this ivy on the on the sides of the highways and it grows right up into the trees and it completely takes them over that's what would happen if what you didn't have a man there to protect it right certain things will take over they'll dominate but when you have what a godsend man when you have a a person that's been built for the job and they come in what do they do they create order out of that chaos and they keep things in line amen it says what look at this and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food for the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and eagle good and evil rather and then god had prepared a place just for adam for adam's talents for adam's body for the way he was built for the way he thought everything was prepared so that when adam stepped in he knew just what to do and how to do it and he could get his shoulders right in and put it against the wheel amen what did it take it took water listen only god can bring the water i can stand up here brother joe can stand up here and he we can preach till we're blue in the face we can sing until we can't breathe and we can dance until we fall over but unless god sends the holy ghost reign it's not going to make a lick of difference does it it starts with god each and every single time but what when the rain comes there's a people that can what latch into the mind of god and they can take what that rain brings and they can turn it into what the purpose of god they can turn it into things that god has called them to do and be in their lives amen and then after that what did god do after the rain came he brought a man then after that he brought a woman guess what it wasn't good for the man to be alone so he brought his sister along didn't he so there's a place for a man and there's a place for a sister and we spent 18 or 19 sermons covering it but there's a purpose and there's a meaning for each and every one of us amen we are built and we're set up a particular way to do what to tend our own gardens each of us has a garden and some of it's just going to be a family garden and guess what it's not just a family garden if you've got a family garden god has given you a tremendous responsibility brothers and sisters alike but then some are called to what they're called to ministries they're called the deacon ships they're called to evangelism they're called for workplace gardening and then they're called to bring people in that don't know the lord and these different things but god never puts a man or woman here that is his child without a purpose and he always builds them for what to take the load of whatever he's asking them to do amen and then psalms 139 as we start to close it says for thou has possessed my reigns that means he's guided you even when you don't realize it even when you don't think it he was the one that was what turning you i was having a conversation with one of blanca's brothers when we were down in california of course all of her brothers have uh have left the message and and whatnot but she's got one brother that's very respectful and you talk about things he says you know you've got to believe in free will right and i said no i said not really i said because what i'm predestinated i said that means that i'm going to go there whether i think i want to or not i said you get into permissive will and you get into perfect will and i said i have a choice to go easy or have a choice to go hard but one way or another he's going to get me there so i said there's some free will there but i said it ain't all free will because he's already told me where i'm going i said and there's people that aren't told where they're going there's people that's going to be outside the gates and guess what there was no guarantee that they'd make it i said those are the only ones that truly have free will are the ones that are not predestinated because the rest of us he's predestinated where we're going to be he's producing what we're going to do and we may come in with a reward and we may come in without a reward but we're going to be there regardless because we're his children but it's the ones that don't have a predestination inside them that have a true true free will because they get to choose and brother brahm says you choose which way you go you choose to go to hell everyone in the world they choose to go to health they want they can choose to go to heaven there's a path made for them amen for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made that's not just david talk and that's each and every one of us are fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them so before your strengths were known he saw them and before you were ever completed he knew what you'd be why because he wrote it in his book amen amen he's written your name he's written your life he's written your purpose he's written your end all before you ever come to it and all you're doing is walking along in that and you don't even realize it half the time how precious are they thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them brother brown puts it this way give me a hand brother brother weishau he says he makes men different he gives us each one a different place and a palm tree can never be a hickory a hickory tree can never be a palm nobody can take your place and you shouldn't try to take anybody else's place why because you are an individual to god and god has a purpose for you he made you thus you say why did he do it we always say why does why am i like this and when you say why am i like this what you're saying is why did he do this and what do we do we don't say that when we have strengths do we we say it when we have weaknesses why do i have this weakness listen if i look back at the men in my family i would never have taken up a a preaching mantle because to a man they're philanderous uh yeah flandering men they have problem real problems with women every single one of them that as far back as i know they have problems with women that's the last thing you want to have as a preacher but guess what i've been born again and that's one thing that they didn't have was they didn't have a new birth experience amen but what i could look at that and say i don't have much of a pedigree and we can look at our lives and say maybe i don't have much of a pedigree why do i deal with these issues why do i have this weakness why do i have to fight like this listen to overcome we've got to fight there's got to be a battle somewhere but sometimes we say why this sometimes it's sickness sometimes it's a mental weakness i was talking with a brother that was talking to a guy that said you know what i'm not very smart i don't have a big iq he says i can't do the things that you guys do he recognized that but you know what he wasn't sitting there beating himself up about it he was just doing whatever he could do and he thanked god for it but he recognized that as well he recognized that but so often what we say is what why did he do it because we're facing a weakness we're facing a trial we're facing a difficulty in our flesh or in our mind he says why did he do it he is sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way he says but we find out that we're all guarded by the word what is it because he wrote in his book he wrote your name he wrote your life he wrote your attributes he wrote your failures he wrote your mistakes but what do you also write at the end of your name he wrote overcomer that's the only reason we overcome we don't overcome because we have this and we have that and we do this and we do that the reason the second eve can't fall is because he said she wouldn't fall that's the only thing that holds us up it's his grace that's holding us up it's not because we have some superpower in and of ourselves we have this discipline we have this great strength it's because his grace is the thing that holds us up and covers everything we do until we can get over to that other side amen there's two things to take away from tonight one you are part of a great unfolding of the picture of god it isn't over yet mighty god unveiled has not been completely unveiled yet because why you're not fully unveiled you don't see yourself as he is and guess what the scripture says before where that's exactly what we're going to see we're going to see him as he is why because we'll be like him amen amen you're not external to it that's the beauty of this we're not looking on to the unfolding of god we are a part of the unfolding and the unveiling of god amen the second thing is that you have a part to play and you have a purpose for being here you have a purpose for being right here today the way you are fallen great wonderful whatever you might think whatever condition you're in you have a purpose and a part to play and it doesn't matter what it looks like right now god has you here specifically for a reason and then god bless you if we would stand together i mean i'll invite the musicians to come i just wanted to set a foundation there's so much in here there is so much in here and uh thank you sometimes it's hard to to just hold back and go for an hour hour and five minutes but uh by god's grace we'll continue this on sunday and maybe on the rest of the month as the lord would lead but just trying to set us up to have some expectation that listen god has been unveiled god has been unfolded in our lives and we haven't seen the we haven't seen the last of it and then we didn't see only in a prophet there's things that he's going to be unveiling in each and every one of us and i think in hindsight so often that's when we're going to realize what he was doing and how he was opening himself up i think we're going to get to that other side and there's going to be many things we'll be like i didn't realize what he was doing i didn't realize the effect that he was having on my life then you look back and you realize what a change he's made amen and what he's done in our lives let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord you said to your disciples lord you said don't be so happy because demons obey you and sicknesses are healed but you said rejoice because your names are on the lamb's book of life amen and lord we're here to rejoice in that tonight lord we're here to rejoice that you called us lord that you've you've made us a part of your unveiling lord that you've made us a part of the form of god that people can look at us lord that they can see us lord in that maybe they won't recognize it but yet lord there's a testimony that you are alive and well today and lord we pray that you would just help us to to lift ourselves up into your word lord not by pride lord or anything lord but that as we look into your word lord we would say be it unto me according to your word lord that we would look past this fallen nature lord this carnal flesh the mistakes lord that we would look to that shed blood lord and that we would look to that holy spirit that lives within us heavenly father and say that greater is he that is in us than he that is in
