praise the lord the lord bless you turn with me to john chapter 11 and i have another two or three other scriptures after this one john chapter 11 amen and beginning to read at verse 17 amen so be in prayer for the going forth of the word and it is some thoughts that i have ministered on a man about four years ago four or five years ago so praying the grace of god to bring it back to our remembrance amen brother we're going to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it because god's requiring it amen brother god wanted us to believe it then he wants us to believe it now by the grace of god and not only that but he wants it to be more real to us now than it was then amen and it's and again the the thoughts we're going to speak on is the way we believe amen it's one thing to say i believe but how are you believing and that's what that's what god's looking at that's why god god wants the right way to believe amen he wants you to believe really truly not enjoy not in your head but in your heart oh yeah many many they just their their faith goes no further than their heads they go no further than their human spirit that's right but like the problem god said you can have the holy ghost he said in your flesh he said 24 hours a day and he said and go to hell that's right so we'd let's make our calling an election sure make sure that it's in our hearts by the grace of god make sure that the faith you have is in your heart make sure the faith you have is in control amen it controls your thoughts your words your deeds amen it controls your motives and your objectives amen in life truly absolutely brother if we have the faith that pleases god it's not you that's living amen is christ living in you amen it was christ in the in the flesh 2000 years ago amen living out the word and now is christ in you and me amen put mother sister in control as it was in the flesh two thousand years ago it's in your flesh my flesh today by the grace of god amen praise the lord believe in the word and lord living the word and flesh amen because what god promised he made flesh amen and brother what god has promised for this hour he's making flesh in you and me amen i trust by grace that it's a reflection of what's on the inside of the inside that's why we're here that's why we're believing listening to the word that's why we're hearing the word and i trust by grace that when you go outside and you live that the light you live morning noon and night 24 hours a day amen that is it's the word in you hallelujah praise the lord this is absolutely amazing hallelujah oh brother that was jesus he was the word made flesh in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen and he was the word praise the lord and now that words the prophet of god said that word is made flesh in the bride praise the lord he was the word in flesh we are the word and flesh that was that was our bridegroom this is the bride praise the lord that was our lord jesus christ this is mrs jesus christ oh i pray grace brother amen that as he was the word so we are the word in flesh oh my brother god have mercy on us and god help us amen make our calling and election sure make sure you are the word amen in flesh that you are dead to yourself and you're alive to the word praise the lord in john chapter 11 and verse 17 then when jesus came he found that he had laying in the grave lazarus had laid in the grave four days already now he said bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother and then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him grace brother that we have the faith to meet him amen but mary sat still in the house and then said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee amen he was god amen praise the lord and jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day she was looking to the future and unfortunately too many believers are still looking to the future for the resurrection looking to the future for the rapture but brother it is in the present tense praise the lord amen she said martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection hallelujah and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live brother let's not look to the resurrection in the future but believe hallelujah the resurrection in the present tense because the ministry of the hour the ministry of malachi 4. the ministry of that was made flesh in this hour and the revealing of the mystery of god is to give us the revelation of the resurrection amen brother as he had come down amen to redeem us spiritually he has come down and the word is made fresh to redeem us physically hallelujah brother he came and yes he laid his life down he picked it up again praise the lord but he went up into glory and he and he came back in the form of the holy ghost to give us the resurrection in our souls amen and the baptism of the holy ghost we're not dead but we're alive praise the lord amen but now he has come in these last days amen to redeem us physically praise the lord hallelujah brother i pray the grace of god we have the faith that i am redeemed in my soul i have christ in me the hope of glory praise the lord i trust and believe that we are believing that we now have the word in flesh as it was in jesus name amen what for to resurrect us spiritually and physically we've been raised as again as i said when i preached that some years ago in a certain church and i said i'm resurrected i'm raptured and they all oh they were shocked the the whole congregation and and they they didn't didn't really believe it because they didn't understand it and as i said even even the pastor looked back toward the congregation and he shook his head back and forth that he didn't maybe believe it that he did he didn't understand and see it that way until finally i had to go in and as i said before let me say it again that i went in and gave him i said i want to give you the word to prove that i've been resurrected and i've been raptured oh you have yes i said because you with thee quickened and you had he made a lie you as he resurrected i said who were dead in sins and trespasses and i said go on down i said we've been cut up into heavenly places in christ i said we've been raptured and the proud of god said what's going on up there he said oh he said the word's being revealed amen in heavenly places in christ the word is being revealed amen to give us the faith that god wants us to have brother he did it in luther's day and wesley's day and he gave each one of them the faith amen amen that he was looking for in there in that age justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost gifts of the spirit amen brother i pray god help us to believe it help us to see it help us to understand it yes god did that amen history proves it the word of god proves it god has proven it brother but now what's he doing now brother god god requires judge lutheran wesley and and yeah when it comes to the pentecostals and the baptism of the holy ghost gifts of the spirit help us to believe god but brother he wants us to look up amen when you see this and you see this praise the lord oh yeah thank you we look down to luther down to wesley but brother now we're looking up when it comes to the ministry of elijah amen oh he gave us this faith this faith to keep on going keep on going keep on walking keep on moving but brother then there comes a ministry and there comes a message by the grace of god look up amen amen because it says when you see this you see that amen in that hour and he said look up because your redemption draweth not amen this is the redemption of our bodies amen brother we redeemed god has redeemed us spiritually all down right since since the baptism of the holy ghost since the resurrection of jesus amen he has resurrected us spiritually amen redemption us but brother what's he working on he's working on the full redemption soul body and spirit amen to get us out of time and into eternity amen to get us out of these bodies and into glorified bodies oh praise the name of the lord but brother we're we're not no thank god i we i won't be looking and seeing our brothers and sisters here with gray hair and white hair no no not oh yeah and these glasses no not by any means thank god we're moving into a realm where all this is passing away amen we're getting into a realm oh yes by the grace of god oh yeah god help us to have that faith that pleases him brother because why not only please god because we need it i need that faith you need that faith in this in this hour whether the brother is going to take more than luther's faith it helped them in that hour and wesley and his age and the pentecostals and age please god yes amen praise the lord but now brother god's looking for something that plus amen oh so brother do you have that faith of luther do you have the faith of wesley do you have the faith of the of the pentecostals amen oh yes well brother good praise the lord the prophet of god says that's good he says right there on the shelf and he said for us whenever we need it amen to look what i'll tell you put it all together what's what what what influence is it going to have on you amen what influence is going to have on me i'm going to oh we're going to look up oh yeah they did this in their day they did that they did that look at what the pentecostals did and going around the world with the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit praying for the sick and brother now we're going now we're going beyond that when it comes to praying for the sick now we're getting into the resurrection alleluia of the dead amen the dead in christ shall rise first praise the lord amen oh brother oh you have justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost gifts of the spirit the anointing of god amen in my soul putting me in contact with god amen moving on moving on praise the lord hallelujah good but now you gotta get to the place where whoa praise the lord now is look up oh yeah we're getting right into the revelation of a new body by the grace of god oh brother god help us to have the faith god help us to believe amen who there believed in justification after all the years he would excuse me for keeping you understanding but after all the years brother that he went trying to justify he felt he had to do this he had to do this he had to go here do this and so on that he would be justified in in in the presence of god amen oh yeah he did so much until like i said he got he got so frustrated until he went into the into the church and he and he opened the bible that was in the in the vestibule of the church amen you know oh he read one scripture that was it amen brother he realized oh my all he had done meant nothing and he knew it but i tell you this he was still burdened but when he read the word oh he was lifted up hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord brother he o glory god god then the burden was lifted the burden was gone and brother then why he got the revelation that jesus justified him jesus sanctified him jesus did this jesus did that amen brother we believe it we believe it but now what are we believing oh my my my mind they did that and they stood for it and they believed that amen and god blessed them and god honored them so brother but what's god looking for in you and me amen brother amen brother he's looking for he's looking for in you and me he's looking for what he was looking for in martha oh yeah amen when he was there in flesh the word and flesh amen and he was looking for that faith of the resurrection amen not in the future but in the present tense amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah brother sweets and martha says soon as she heard that jesus was coming when he met him and mary sat still in the house and then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hast been ear my brother had not died but i know that even now whosoever thou will ask of god whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee he was god amen and jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day amen brother don't let anybody point you before point you on to to another day we're in the last day amen amen we're in the last day and she said i know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen god help us to have that faith we need it in this hour amen when death is going around the world god help us and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this amen god bless his word you may be seated amen brother god's requiring that we believe it amen brother and in what way is god asking like luther to believe that what god gave them wesley and and the pentecostals but now in the in this bright age amen how does god want us to believe what he has done and what he is doing amen brother luther got to the place where he believed that by faith amen what was he doing he was accepting what jesus did amen because for years he was doing this he was doing that amen and and believing that god was going to honor that faith oh he was doing this for the lord he was doing this to please god and so on but brother god already did it and what he wanted he want he wanted he wanted to please luther amen and to please let her he had to get he had to give luther the revelation but brother just think god let luther go on and on and on for a number of years amen that luther was trying to do this luther was trying to do that amen and brother what was it he was coming to the end to the place where amen he wasn't getting anywhere and luther knew it amen martin luther knew it john wesley and so on amen they were they're all trying to be justified all trying to be sanctified amen but not not entering into the faith they didn't have that faith amen that it was already done didn't that that faith in the absolute complete finished work of calvary amen of what our lord jesus did brother because he came and he justified us and he sanctified us amen and he forgave us he laid down his life for us praise the lord oh yeah because because according to according to all of us being born in sin we were we were sentenced to die amen sentence today amen separated from god but jesus came and laid down his life picked it up again perfect amen what for to bring us back into fellowship with god bring us back into contact with god to amen to give us the faith of where we come from why we're here and where we're going and how we're going to get there praise the name of the lord amen brother it's a revelation that they needed luther needed wesley needed the pentecost as needed and brother alleluia what for just being justified being sanctified amen be coming into a oneness with god through the baptism of the holy ghost amen and now brother it's a revelation that we need to get out of time into eternity the resurrection and the rapture brother they they recognize it with jesus did it jesus did it jesus did it amen thank you jesus thank you jesus amen brother now we we realize oh jesus you are the resurrection amen you are the rapture you are the change amen you're you're you're the one that i need amen i need to be in you and have your anointing in me pray oh yeah to you i'd be united with him to have a oneness with him oh brother i pray that it'll strike us the way that revelation struck the luther the way that revelation struck wesley the way that revelation struck the pentecostals and again let me repeat how that wesley got it because he was in a cottage meeting amen and again it was it was a meeting of the uh of lutherans and oh yeah luther was going on but they had a college meeting and they were preaching what luther was preaching and preaching what god revealed through luther amen oh yeah that is that he he was justified amen by the grace of god amen brother and and oh my and and wesley was in one of those meetings and they were stood up and they were worshiping and and then the brother was still preaching and laying in the word laying in the word amen and wesley was there and he and he raised his hands and he all of a sudden this the revelation struck with me amen oh it's trump wesley oh he that he he was sanctified amen as it was justified by faith luther the wesley was sanctified by faith jesus did it oh and he realized that it was in jesus and he had to accept it and and then the anointing the anointing would come into him and he would live it out by the grace of god not go and work it out live it amen you're just going out and living that's not what you did it's what he did amen amen it's not your life it's his life by the grace of god amen it's not your resurrection as the words is amen he said he said i am the resurrection amen and the life praise the name of the lord and brother as he shared that with luther david wesley that with the pentecostals he's there to share the resurrection and rapture with us praise the lord he's there for that anointing in your life and in mind amen if there's ever a faith brother that god's looking for in us is the resurrection and rapture amen oh well oh yeah luther wesley yes yes we got that we believe that amen and god knows it brother god has responded to that but now god's looking for the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture to get us out of time and into eternity amen because oh brother praise the lord brother do what it is to absolutely bring to a conclusion as it were what jesus did it's it is fetished amen he justified us sanctified us filled with the holy ghost amen now resurrect and rapture us from time to eternity it is finished amen brother sin put us back in time amen but jesus came to redeem us back to eternity praise the lord amen amen amen hallelujah praise the lord i trust by grace that we have the faith oh yeah lutheran the faith for for justification and the pentecostals the gifts the baptism of the holy ghost a greater anointing and a greater relationship with jesus a greater relationship with god amen you know but it was in living the life here but now we're into a greater revelation of getting out of this one and into glory at a time and into eternity oh i pray god in the name of jesus lord as as our brothers and sisters in the years gone by believe what you were doing then the lord help us to believe what you're doing now amen lord that was to confess what you're doing now obviously going to live what you're doing now by the grace of god amen come on oh my i pray god give us that faith oh i pray god anoint that faith amen for mother he anointed luther's faith so luther stopped due to the feeling that he had to do this he had to do that well he just went out and lived it and and he did this and did that but it wasn't him it was christ in him and wesley the same thing with jesus in him and the pentecostals the same thing with the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost oh it wasn't them they didn't do it jesus did it praise the name of the lord as i like i said i i experienced the pentecostal anointing i experienced a part of the pentecostal revival amen just as as a young man as a teenager amen it's hard to believe that it's that many years ago you think that i'm the oldest here as somebody mentioned the other night brother gerald's the oldest here and uh i said oh my lord i said uh you know where's brother burns and where's brother man you and so on they're the oldest you know but they're gone on amen now i'm the oldest amen but brother and what they were believing for they went on and they left left me to believe for it they left me the claimant the resurrection the rapture the change into a glorified body amen amen amen to go from time to eternity brother how many of us are more conscious of of the spiritual than we are of the natural how many of us really really really are we living in the spirit are we walking in the spirit are are we just morning noon and night thinking lord we're looking for the resurrection we're looking to rapture lord amen oh jesus lived it home morning noon and night that's all it's always in his heart in his mind he said and how long shall i be with this generation and so on and he can say oh he said i come down from there i'm going back there amen how many of us are really conscious of eternity how many are living for eternity how many have you thought about it much today or are we thinking more about what's going on in the world are we thinking more about what we got to do oh we got to do this we're going to do this and so on brother i'll tell you this if we are the seed of god morning noon and night we can't get away from the revelation no amen morning noon and night we're going to we're thinking about the resurrection the rapture oh my how in the world can can you dr even drive by a cemetery and not think about the resurrection amen and not think about the rapture amen how can we consider what is going on in the world today amen and and and knowing that it's the scripture fulfilled amen coming to pass god god promised this god said this god said that brother there's no way if we are spiritual if we are the seed of god we are the sons and daughters of god brother you're going to go out there and live like a just normal human being or you can go there and live as the seed of god amen oh yes he put it this way maybe brother advisor can understand but it's just like going from one country to another dead brother coming from me from india here just recently our brother brother ally and brother joshua know that is getting used to newfoundland you're getting used to america and so on oh yeah but there was a time when brother vicer rose up in the morning in india and it was the indians here the indians there and this nature and this nature they did this they did this they did that occasionally you would see just uh you you see somebody you know uh just foreigners that are that are in india and so on well you see them do this you see them do that but there was there was a difference so do we are we conscious of the difference are we more conscious of eternity than we are of time are we more conscious of heaven than we are of the world we're living in brother that if you can walk and and do this and do this and brother and it's just you're in a foreign country absolutely in a foreign country we are amen brother god and brother in this hour in these last days brother god has given us more and more and more the revelation that we are not belonging here amen brother it's like israel and egypt they got to the place guys i've heard the cries of my people and i've come down to bring them out amen because they don't want they didn't want to do money in egypt amen oh well they said they were slaves so they didn't want it well brother we're living in an hour that uh we're slaves to this world oh yeah we're slaves oh yes indeed slaves to do this slaves to do that do this do this we want to do this we want it we got to do this got to do that oh thank god we're getting out of here amen like i've said i've been thinking about it and i said lord oh my lord i said i'm longing for it i'm learning i said for a country i'm longing for another place i said lord where there's no negative thoughts and i said there's no old age and there's none of this none of that oh my lord i should get us out of here please lord we want to get into that glory with you absolutely perfect thoughts perfect words perfect deeds nothing negative nothing amen no darkness it's eternal light god help us brother brother i pray brother and i pray but i know by the grace of god and by the word of god that the closer we get to the resurrection rapture oh yeah the more and more we're going to be more and more conscious of it more and more sensitive to it that anointing the resurrection anointing the rapture anointing in us we know all something going on lord i i just i just want to get get out of this place more and more and more and more lord i'm becoming more and more of a stranger in this world yeah god help us amen brother it would take a like i said our advisor time and experience you know just to adjust to the change amen oh yeah makes no difference now that after a while it makes no difference whether he's in newfoundland or india no yeah as a christian makes no difference where you are why because whether you're here or whether you're some other part of the country or some other part of the world amen you're still got eternity in you in control amen you still got that revelation oh that that that you can't get away from the revelation that you're a seed of god and that you come from eternity we're going back to eternity amen we're going back to a new heaven and a new earth god help us amen brother let's believe the way god wants us to believe let's believe the way that pleases god amen are we going to believe like like like abel or believe like cain oh yeah well well cain that faith yo cain out of faith but not perfect faith oh yeah can't cain none of that as i preached years and years and years ago down there on empire avenue and i said which church would you would you go to cain's or abel's most would go to cain's church oh that's a nice church oh yes it was beautiful you know all that he had on the altar and everything but abel's church wasn't so good why just a why what abel never had no beautiful altar uh he just had that altar there and a lamb killed and blood all over the altar and blood overcame over abel yeah it didn't please cain but yet god said if you do what if you do what's right he said would you also be accepted but he wouldn't do it why they feel oh well this should be this should be pleasing to god look what i've done you know and so on and all that he gave all he all able give is this but look what i got there on the altar but it didn't please god he had an excellent sacrifice was that excellent yes because the bible says abel had the more excellent and if abel was more excellent keynes must have been excellent amen amen so brother you can do this and you can do that and you think oh this is good this is excellent yeah but god's looking for the more excellent amen amen were you going to completely lay down your life i'll tell you this it caught it cost able his life he laid down his oh yeah the lamb laid down his life for abel and abel had to lay down his life because cain didn't wouldn't please and brother we got to lay down our lives in the eyes of the world sometimes it's not not all the time but to a certain extent with family friends and neighbors you you die you gotta lay down your life die to their influence yeah so the oh yeah it's definitely we all got to do that die to the influence of family friends and neighbors oh my lord so that we're alive to jesus we're sensitive to his leadership it's not me that lives as christ lives in me amen the lights you live what you think what you say oh my what you're doing thought word deed amen your motives and your objectives in life brother it's god in you he's controlling you now family sometimes family don't understand it it's like i said when when our family was getting together for a certain thing and a certain gathering and and so they called us called me and wanted to know wanted to know because they wanted us to be there but at the same time want to know oh gerald is is it all okay for us to do this is it okay for us to do that we just want to know before you come because we we won't do it if it's if it's contrary to anything you believe or your faith and of course at the time i said no no and it wasn't what they were they're planning on doing it it didn't didn't matter to me it wouldn't it wouldn't affect our faith for sure but again they had they were they knew because of our stand for the word that maybe they wouldn't do this maybe they wouldn't do that oh yeah because there's a stand that we were taking for the truth so brother are you leaving that impression with your family your friends and your neighbors that you're going to put them on the under under guard oh yeah even though i know that even when we lived here saint john's years ago and i was just a teenager yeah even our neighbors were sensitive to what what i believe that i was christian that i was different oh yeah they knew the difference when i would i would say i said when you would walk walk down the steps out of the house oh he's a christian he's different he's this needs that and so on oh so i pray grace brother that we have that anointing in our lives now i tell you it's going to get more and more real the closer we get to the resurrection it's going to get more and more real the closer we get to the rapture because the world's going to get so caught up with with the foolishness of the world yeah and christians are not christians like they used to be no no no not even even at one time pentecostals they knew they knew pentecostals were different but not now no no they're getting like just the rest of the rest of religion they know they're religious but when it comes to living a different life living a whole holiness and so on no not there not there like it used to be that's right grace to us amen and i tell you this even a lot of believers are not living the separated life that they used to god have mercy on us amen brother are we believing it the way god wants us to believe it giving preeminence to jesus giving preeminence to the resurrection preeminence to the rapture preeminence to what god is doing amen we're not going to get scott caught up with what he did but what is he doing amen brother what he did is in the past what he's doing in the present by the grace of god what's he doing he's making us more and more one with the word and to give us more and more the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture amen brother he's bringing us more and more into in into his nature so that oh yeah so that we're going to get more and more uncomfortable in the world we're living in there's certain i'll tell you this there's certain worlds that maybe you could you could go to certain places and you wouldn't want to live there oh yeah there's certain things maybe that that you might be getting you might have to get to get involved in and meet out there in in the world the way people are living today and you wouldn't you wouldn't want to get involved with it no because today it doesn't matter there's very little today the sin one time this was sin that was sin this was sin they wouldn't do this they wouldn't do that or they were christians they went to church so they they then through the week they just they just lived live the christian life basic christian life but no such thing today very little and but the unfortunate thing is influencing even believers whereas one time we were spiritual we love the lord the lord loved us we lived for the lord we wanted to testify about the lord testify about what god did or we just we just loved it and it was in us that that nature was in us to to bear witness by the life we live or to family and friends and neighbors oh yeah the opportunity was there we'd say oh well thank the lord give god the glory amen god did this god did that but now no matter what what comes or goes just people are really ashamed they're almost afraid to to be spiritual or they might laugh at you or they might think you're foolish so what they want to hurt amen you don't mind burying that response very that that that rebuke and so on no you do anything for jesus considering what jesus did for you what are you going to do for him as i said it struck me here a few weeks ago i was thinking about the grace of god what what grace was i said lord i said god bless the brother that wrote it but i said he was absolutely right it was amazing grace amen i said lord not just grace it was amazing and it is amazing when i consider me and my life and this brother this sister in their lives i said oh it is grace thank you jesus thank you jesus oh brother no not just considering oh god love me so he come to redeem me yeah but it was grace it was amazing grace it was absolutely unmerited favor because why because your nature was contrary to it all your hunger and thirst was contrary to it amen amen all that god wanted it there wasn't anything in you that's why oh yeah you just had to go down into your soul to see if there's any seed there amen and brother get down in your soul bring a change into your spirit and into your flesh so he'll bring forth his life amen praise the lord i pray grace in the name of jesus oh yes oh it's getting late amen should be an hour so i'll let's see let's read get to another couple of scriptures here deuteronomy 29 deuteronomy 29 let's believe with a complete belief amen god in control amen it's not you in control it's not william branham in control it's jesus not this ministry that ministry it is jesus not my will father thine be done amen grace of god deuteronomy 29 and verse 1 these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with them in oreb and moses called on to all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and onto all his land and we have seen in this hour what god has done amen through a prophetic ministry yes sir praise the lord and it says the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles yet the lord hath not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see ears to hear unto this day amen and verse 9 keep there for the words of this covenant and do them amen that ye may prosper in all that ye do praise the lord brother is god as it were to bring israel out of egypt but brother and god to take us out of yeah brother brown also referred that we're in egypt and he said we want god to deliver us to get us out of egypt amen but my god have mercy please lord help us because are we spiritual to the extent that it's that god is wiping out the world the things of the world amen amen are we spiritual to the extent that god is bringing into us as it were a hate and we just don't like what what the world we're living in i don't like the world i'm living in do we have that anointing do we have that that experience with god our minds do we truly truly truly have that real true experience amen of being born again amen so that the nature that we were born with physically is down but the new nature is up because the nature we were born with physically oh makes us more conscious of the world we're living in and we like this we like that and we're angry and thirsting for this we want this there's natural things of the world but i tell you this if you're born again brother you're a tender or cottage why should i care they're building a mansion for me over there by the grace of god but yet people do care and they're they're trying to go out there and get more and more and more and more of the world the things of the world more money more this more that brother let god control that lord whatever you want you want to make me a beggar i'll beg for for for this album and i'll do this and i'll do that i'm believing that you'll provide oh yeah but no people are are they they're figuring it out all in the natural they're living for the for the flesh oh yeah we want to want to live in the world make the flesh bit for better for the flesh better for this better for that oh yeah there's too many focusing on that how many are just going to leave it with the lord amen again like i said our tent or a cottage they do care oh yeah god help us i'm not saying the lord would would have put you in a tent all the time but you if if you got that right attitude you'll give you a cottage but you've got to have right attitude do you have it because god gave it to you do you have it because god blessed you with it or do you have it because you were hungry and thirsting thirsting part god helped us oh yes there are those out there that's been blessed and they're satisfied if they don't have it again it's like that brother and sister years ago some years ago and and god came they had they had a big home and they had this and it was wonderful and god spoke to the brother in a dream and said you got to take this home and give it to the pastor what yeah you got to give it to the pastor and oh my he got up and he told his wife she said yes you're right she felt the same leadership and so that's what they did they said okay we'll do that lord oh boy and so they give it to the pastor and uh they ended up outside and then well where are we going to go now so they went and went looking for this and doing this and doing that and finally they came met this this lady and that she she had a whole big home and she had a big garage there so she said oh you can live in the garage so they moved into that that lady's garage and the and god wanted them to do this and they they were working for her and doing this and doing that and at this at that point too she was a millionaire she was a very rich woman so somewhere there god because of because of they did what god wanted to do that eventually something happened and god blessed that couple and they became millionaires and as i understand they they were back there in the early days of brother brown's ministry and that they helped support brother batman's ministry yeah god made them a millionaire but but they were there to help this one they were there to help that one another one with their money yeah we're living in a generation that wants to get more and more money you know oh how much do i have in the bank i need this i need this i need this god help us let's trust the lord amen let's leave it with the lord oh yeah but again i'm not saying because if your attitude is right and you're not you're not hungry and thirsting for this and you oh my reaching out for this reason i want this i want no if you're if you got the right added to my spirit god bless you oh yeah got them sometimes they're they're those that god god has made millionaires and then there are others that god make them beggars why because of their attitude and their spirit [Music] there's and again there was a we had a brother here preaching to us years ago no doubt he's gone on now and he talks about someone that was in that in his church in the united states and that brother he was a billionaire he was a rich man but he said you'd never know it because he didn't act like one he didn't he wasn't there to dress like one and and he said he when he wasn't there just a fellowship with rich people he said when it comes to after the service and he said we're fellowshipping with one another he said he go he go to the poorest in the church and sit down and fellowship with him and oh yeah she said he was very very common amen so brother sister i pray god to humble us amen god help us to believe the way you want us to believe amen that brother was believing the way god wanted them to believe in humility not to go out there and act like oh get everybody to oh to humble themselves to him because he was a millionaire no way he would he would help this person help that person but he would do it privately oh yeah he didn't want to show off he did it for god amen god help us again keep verse 9 of deuteronomy 29 keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that you do prosper praise the lord bear with me and it come to pass when he heareth verse 19 the words of this curse that he blessed himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to head drunkenness to thirst the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against this man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven amen amen brother let's keep our attitude right in our spirit right this verse 29 the secret things belong unto the lord our god amen but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever hallelujah rather that's the word that was revealed in this hours for us and for our children amen for us in this hour it is pointing us to the resurrection and rapture that we may do all the words of this law amen let's go to another scripture in second corinthians chapter four amen more willing maybe we'll have to try on sunday to to bring it to a conclusion concerning believing as god wants us to believe believe what he wants us to believe but also believe it the way he wants us to believe it and let it let it control you not you control it in second corinthians chapter four amen let's start with verse 1 therefore seeing we have this ministry we as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god amen but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them grace oh thank god brother truly for us it is absolutely amazing grace for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake amen for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ amen praise the lord brother god help us to believe with a complete belief but god help us to believe as god wants us to believe giving him absolute control praise the lord is not us controlling the word or the message it's the word the message controlling us amen if we believe it the way god wants us to believe it it will control us thoughts words deeds yes our motives and our objectives amen because lord our saints our brothers and sisters by the grace of god if we're believing it the way god wants us to believe it god is in control if we're believing it the way god wants us to believe it brother sister we have god's motives and god's objectives god grace brother it's ordained to produce faith but we have to believe it if we have that faith then we believe it with the right motive and the right objective we're going to give god the glory give god the preeminence amen so lord we'll get into some thoughts here concerning believe in it the way god wants us to believe it amen we're the right motive and a right objective and i also want to share with you some quotes of the prophet concerning the way god wants you to do it and the way god wants you to believe the word amen god help us god hidden and god revealed simplicity by the grace of god god bless you let's stand amen let's sing four hundred and three number four zero three when we all get to heaven sing the wondrous love of jesus sing his mercy and his grace amen in the mansion's bright and blessed he'll prepare for us a place so be in prayer amen the grace of god be with us lord terry's on sunday and brother again praying grace lord [Music] that maybe the rapture the resurrection will take place before sunday how many wine if you want it let's let's pray for it if you really want it let's be calling for it let's be hungry and thirsting for it by the grace of god amen so lord help us see and again we know there's going to be a resurrection we know there's going to be a rapture but i'll have to be honest that most believers to me are not looking for it did they just think oh it's up the road or it's going to happen when god wants it to happen no it's going to happen when you want it happening because the problem of god said that god's waiting on you and he said he said the dead in christ are waiting on us what why are they waiting on us they're waiting on us to come to that faith that'll bring them forth into glorified bodies amen praise the lord so lord help us lord please lord it's not just saying i believe the message this is the message you did this lord you did that lord yeah god said yes that's right that's right but do you have the faith that i ordained for it to give you so what do you want to do amen i tell you a lot a lot of people are just message believers and they go get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ oh we believe this we believe that the power of god said oh yeah you can believe that he said and and go to hell you get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he said go to hell it was not by not by a real faith out of your heart amen that you're convicted by the holy ghost by the word of god and you love the lord and you want to do this you want to do that not just because oh well i believe that doctrine i believe this doctrine brother it's got to be based on love whether all that god did was based on his love for you now and brother why did he do this why did he do that so you would love him for it the problem of god said oh he allowed all this to happen in the garden of eden yeah all this allowed this to happen down through time amen and he came to redeem us what do you want to do he said he wanted us to love him for himself praise the lord god help us amen so let's sing of the wondrous love of jesus and sing his mercy and his grace amen sing the one dress love of jesus is [Music] that will be [Applause] when we hallelujah [Music] victory [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] victory [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
