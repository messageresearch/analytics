[44:54] you to see the finished uh test
[44:57] testimony of Peter here and he says
[44:58] Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of

[45:18] thought on a true conversion this
[45:21] morning Amen in last service we covered
[45:24] Peter's calling we covered his ministry
[45:26] we covered his position ition we covered
[45:28] his foundational Revelation and we saw
[45:30] that even with those signs and wonders
[45:32] and walking with Jesus every day Peter
[45:34] was still a man that couldn't seem to
[45:36] get it right consistently he had these
[45:38] moments of great faith Peter and Jesus
[45:40] are the only two people to walk on water
[45:42] and yes Peter fell afterwards but he
[45:44] walked on water he had these moments of
[45:46] tremendous Faith he was a man of bulldog
[45:49] faith maybe we'd say today but then he
[45:50] had those moments where he was just so
[45:52] caught up in himself and his Humanity
[45:54] came out and his intellect or lack
[45:56] thereof baby came out and he just
[45:58] couldn't seem to get things right he
[46:00] just couldn't stay consistent and last
[46:02] service we finished with a few episodes
[46:04] where we saw Peter was resisting Jesus
[46:06] or even rebuking or correcting Jesus and
[46:09] it's a strange thing to think of
[46:10] somebody correcting our Lord and savior
[46:13] you know but I don't like to leave Peter
[46:15] out here on a limb by himself because so
[46:17] many times we may not go to God like
[46:19] Peter did or go to Jesus and take him by
[46:21] the lapels and say now Jesus forbid that
[46:24] these things happen but yet by our own
[46:26] attit itude and by our response to
[46:28] things that are going long we can sit
[46:30] there and we can correct
[46:32] God you know so often what we can do is
[46:34] we can we can look at situations in our
[46:36] life and we can say God forbid that I
[46:38] have to go through this why is this
[46:41] happening to me why hasn't this changed
[46:42] and our attitude and our response to God
[46:45] is one of correcting God for how he's
[46:47] using things in our life to get us to a
[46:49] certain end and we can sit there and we
[46:52] can get an attitude and we can get a a
[46:53] certain way of responding and we can get
[46:55] tucked up in ourselves and we can get
[46:57] bitter we can get angry we can get into
[46:59] Despair and our response to those things
[47:02] is actually us trying to correct God
[47:05] because we're not accepting him for what
[47:07] he's doing in our life we're not
[47:08] trusting him for what he has as a plan
[47:10] for us amen and so in our Humanity we
[47:12] can start to question God and we are
[47:15] doing it no differently than Peter did
[47:16] it's just we don't have the physical
[47:17] body to lay hold of to talk about these
[47:20] things listen to this what brother B he
[47:22] says see how people are even getting
[47:24] bitter he says they're getting against
[47:27] God he says because they pray and pray
[47:31] and pray and nothing
[47:33] happened what is it they want the
[47:36] situation to change it may be a life
[47:38] situation it may be a situation for
[47:40] healing it might be a situation for
[47:42] deliverance per for provision they pray
[47:44] and pray and pray and nothing happens he
[47:46] says and they turn against God that's
[47:49] what Peter did he turned against Christ
[47:51] he literally tried to turn him away from
[47:53] the word he became a stumbling block he
[47:55] he was a stumbling block to Jesus it
[47:57] wasn't effective but Peter got
[47:59] completely out of kilter because he
[48:01] didn't agree with what was going on in
[48:03] the situation and we can do the exact
[48:04] same thing our response to God shows
[48:07] where we're at in that moment
[48:08] spiritually listen we can all get dried
[48:10] out we can all get frustrated the grind
[48:13] of Life the the struggles that we go
[48:15] through it seems like sometimes certain
[48:18] things never end and our attitude starts
[48:20] to build up in a way that it starts to
[48:22] correct God and it's not supposed to do
[48:25] that what is it we're supposed to be at
[48:28] rest in the time of a storm amen he's a
[48:31] shelter in a weary land he's a rock
[48:33] where we can go for support and and for
[48:35] shelter and these things and so we go we
[48:38] end up going away from that idea that
[48:40] God does all things well and all things
[48:42] work together for our good and we forget
[48:44] our position in him and therefore we try
[48:47] and move him to where we want him to be
[48:50] it's not supposed to be that way and
[48:52] with Peter we see these flashes of
[48:54] absolute Faith followed by absolute Carn
[48:57] it and it's the push and pull of Peter's
[48:59] Soul's Desire combating with his human
[49:03] nature and because he's unconverted he's
[49:06] more prone to the human nature than he
[49:08] is to the spirit of God and so he keeps
[49:10] falling flat on his face amen and so we
[49:13] see that Peter's been baptized by Jesus
[49:15] he's been ordained to minister by Jesus
[49:17] he's been uh Justified he's been
[49:20] Sanctified and yet Peter still doesn't
[49:22] have that anchor that he needs so that
[49:25] when storms rise up he can can sit still
[49:28] or when he doesn't understand something
[49:30] he can be quiet and just let things roll
[49:32] out and let God do what he wants to do
[49:35] and he just couldn't learn to be to be
[49:37] still in trust he just wanted to always
[49:40] be doing something you know Jesus said
[49:42] you know we're going to need some swords
[49:43] tonight here's a sword that's good Peter
[49:46] and then Peter uses a sword Jesus didn't
[49:47] want him using a
[49:49] sword but Peter in the moment because
[49:52] they Jesus said bring swords well that
[49:54] must mean he wants me to use the sword
[49:55] see he wouldn't sit still and let God
[49:57] show him what was supposed to go on and
[50:00] this we're going to look at one more
[50:01] little thing because we've got to see
[50:03] the negative before we can see the
[50:05] positive because if there's one thing
[50:06] the new birth is it ought to show a
[50:08] contrast there ought to be a difference
[50:10] between what we were before and what we
[50:12] were after and so I I'm not trying to
[50:14] beat Peter up but it's here for our
[50:16] admonition so we can learn and we can
[50:17] grow and we can even see ourselves in
[50:19] these things and we see in Matthew 17
[50:23] remember Peter was part of that select
[50:24] group he's he's he's the trifecta uh of
[50:27] Jesus disciples him and John and Peter
[50:30] James and John were the three of them
[50:31] and it says and after six days Jesus
[50:33] taketh Peter James and John his brother
[50:35] and bringeth them up unto an high
[50:37] mountain apart and was transfigured
[50:40] before them and his face did shine as
[50:41] the sun and his reignment was white as
[50:43] the light and behold there appeared unto
[50:45] them Moses and Elisha talking with him
[50:48] and answered and then answered Peter so
[50:50] this Supernatural event is going on and
[50:53] Peter says unto Jesus Lord it is good
[50:56] for us to be here listen there's nothing
[50:59] wrong with saying I'm happy to be in the
[51:01] presence and seeing the supernatural but
[51:03] his response is now if thou Wilt let us
[51:06] make here three Tabernacles one for thee
[51:09] one for Moses and one for Elias now
[51:11] Peter has no revelation of what's
[51:13] happened here he's in the moment and he
[51:16] comes up with some good intention and he
[51:17] shares them with Jesus and it's a
[51:19] perfect example of what happens when an
[51:21] unconverted person has a supernatural
[51:24] experience and how they respond to it it
[51:27] Peter's seen the glorification of Jesus
[51:29] it's a prefigure of what's coming down
[51:31] he's had a a Heavenly experience in an
[51:33] Earthly unconverted condition and Peter
[51:36] gets all worked up about this he has no
[51:38] revelation of what happens he just knows
[51:40] it was tremendously important and so
[51:42] what he's saying here is he's saying
[51:43] let's commemorate this let's do
[51:46] something to to remind ourselves of
[51:48] what's happened on this mountain
[51:51] today Peter has the best of intentions
[51:53] here but we know good intentions aren't
[51:56] always right intentions he's got good
[51:58] intentions but none of them is
[52:00] acceptable to God and if Peter got his
[52:02] own way with his own choice and his own
[52:04] ideas his own ideas would have destroyed
[52:07] him right here it's a scary thing to
[52:09] look at listen to this he says now Peter
[52:12] got all inspired
[52:15] again remember remember the scripture
[52:17] says after 6 days Peter has just said
[52:19] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[52:21] Living God Peter had inspiration that
[52:23] was right after that he says to Jesus
[52:25] Lord forbid it that these come and Jesus
[52:27] said you are inspired by Satan now he
[52:30] comes along he says Peter got all
[52:32] inspired again question is who inspired
[52:36] him I don't doubt people are inspired
[52:39] church but the question is where's the
[52:41] inspiration coming from he says Peter
[52:44] got all inspired again and wanted to
[52:47] have a real Fellowship it's inspiration
[52:50] it's just not God's inspiration and he
[52:52] said let us build here three Tabernacles
[52:55] he was going to really have some Den
[52:56] minations he said now we're going to
[52:57] build one for Moses one for Elijah one
[53:00] for you we'll just have a segregation
[53:02] here we'll have three different churches
[53:03] and now we'll have three different
[53:04] denominations all represented here and
[53:07] Peter thought he was just doing fine
[53:08] when he did
[53:10] that we'd say what's the big deal
[53:12] brother John listen to what the big deal
[53:14] is okay this is a long series of quotes
[53:16] but I want you to catch this because
[53:18] remember our human nature is contrary to
[53:21] the spirit of God and so what ideas it
[53:24] comes with what intentions it comes up
[53:26] with might seem good but that doesn't
[53:28] make it right and he says now Peter said
[53:32] it's good for us to be here let us build
[53:34] three Tabernacles we'll build a seminary
[53:36] here for Moses we'll build a seminary
[53:38] for Elijah and all that want to worship
[53:40] under the law and so forth let them
[53:43] worship they look Peter and them
[53:45] watching Moses Moses represent the law
[53:48] God gave the children of Israel the law
[53:50] because they wanted the law God didn't
[53:54] want them to have it that's man's choice
[53:56] chice he says in Exodus 19 they said you
[53:58] give us something to do to Merit our
[54:00] Salvation we'll keep a law if you'll
[54:03] give it to us in other words he says but
[54:05] it never was God's plan and he says it's
[54:08] better just to quit planning yourself
[54:10] and just use his plan I find that much
[54:13] easier to take his plan they've had
[54:16] 14600 years of the law and what has It
[54:18] produced nothing nothing good
[54:23] religion bondage from Men
[54:26] hasn't done anything
[54:28] good and now Peter's saying let's build
[54:30] a tabernacle to commemorate that he says
[54:33] there stood Moses the law Peter said
[54:35] well some of us keep the law now there's
[54:37] no flesh justified by the law so next
[54:39] after God's law stood there the next
[54:41] that stood Was Elijah and Elijah
[54:43] represented God's justice the prophets
[54:46] he says in so much that Elijah pulled
[54:48] fire out of heaven and killed the 50 so
[54:51] Peter wanted God's law and God's justice
[54:55] so then while Peter was speaking wanting
[54:57] to build his Tabernacle and asked God if
[54:59] he could do it then they looked back and
[55:01] saw Jesus only so Peter's build trying
[55:05] to build up now a commemoration to the
[55:08] things that could do nothing for them
[55:10] except condemn them to
[55:12] death if Peter had his way he'd have
[55:14] divided the people into death and
[55:16] Justice Law And Justice he says there
[55:19] stood Jesus representing God's love not
[55:23] law not justice but in him was met the
[55:25] Fulfillment of of both Law And Justice
[55:28] this is my beloved Son he says no more
[55:30] self-made stuff he says listen to your
[55:32] tutor he says that's the reason Peter
[55:35] could say thou art the Christ the son of
[55:36] the Living God Law And Justice were met
[55:39] in Christ and it's God's love to the
[55:41] human race for God so loved the world
[55:44] and then he prays he says merciful god
[55:46] this morning as I plead for this
[55:48] audience we don't plead for law we don't
[55:51] ask for any law we do not want to be
[55:54] judged by our own Merit I do do not want
[55:56] your Justice Lord no not for your
[55:59] judgment to come upon me never Lord but
[56:02] I plead for your
[56:04] mercy he said hear ye him why should I
[56:08] hear him hear him he says he is the only
[56:10] one that has salvation Mary Joseph all
[56:14] the other saints were great people but
[56:16] only him hear ye him he's the only
[56:19] intercessor he's the only mediator
[56:21] between God and man is Christ Jesus that
[56:24] he says why do I hear him the law could
[56:27] not give me peace he can Justice could
[56:31] bring me nothing only condemnation he
[56:34] gives me peace and
[56:36] Reconciliation he said the law could
[56:38] condemn me because I get sick and the
[56:40] law requires that I have both both Law
[56:43] And Justice he says the laws of nature
[56:45] and the justice of God are executed upon
[56:48] me so I must pay the penalty but I turn
[56:51] my affections and my eyes this morning
[56:54] from both law and justice and look at
[56:57] the love of God who reconciled me back
[56:59] to him through Grace and not through law
[57:02] and through
[57:04] justice but through
[57:06] reconciliation he paid the price to
[57:08] bring man and God together to make them
[57:11] one now that's a long set of quotes but
[57:13] I wanted us to understand this this
[57:16] morning that when we take our own
[57:18] thoughts and apply them to spiritual
[57:20] events and the word itself we're going
[57:22] to produce something that separates us
[57:25] from God not that draws us back to God
[57:28] Peter would have bound the people for
[57:30] another thousand years why by splitting
[57:33] them into camps splitting them into
[57:35] groups and they'd have missed that
[57:36] there's only one way back and it's
[57:38] through Christ Jesus and they'd have
[57:40] been serving law they'd have been
[57:41] serving Justice self-justifying
[57:43] themselves by those things and getting
[57:46] nowhere he just set the church back
[57:48] another thousand years it's so easy to
[57:51] get caught up in the event in the moment
[57:54] in the anointing
[57:56] even but what comes immediately to our
[57:59] mind or to our hearts or to our lips in
[58:01] that moment may not be true inspiration
[58:04] from God just because it comes quickly
[58:07] does not mean it's God Amen we have to
[58:10] check it and we do that by waiting on
[58:12] him and checking against the word God's
[58:15] not in a rush Church God's not in a rush
[58:18] he'll make all things plain in his own
[58:20] time amen we must be yielded to the
[58:22] spirit not driving the spirit we're not
[58:26] here to use the spirit the spirit's here
[58:28] to use us and that's what Peter had
[58:31] forgotten see Peter's trying to make
[58:33] something happen instead of letting it
[58:35] happen God's way church we got to let
[58:37] God be God he is Sovereign he knows all
[58:39] things he's got the plan he's got the
[58:41] purpose he's got the power he's got all
[58:43] these things listen God doesn't do
[58:45] Supernatural events just to do them he
[58:47] does them with purpose and our purpose
[58:50] is to find his purpose in those things
[58:53] listen when we come to church and have a
[58:55] wonderful church service it's not about
[58:57] having a wonderful church service it's
[58:59] about finding what God wants for me and
[59:01] you in that moment so that his word can
[59:03] take hold of our lives and change us
[59:06] listen I think it's great that we can
[59:08] come in and be uplifted emotionally
[59:11] listen if we're if we go out sad I think
[59:14] something's wrong because even
[59:16] correction ought to encourage
[59:18] us you look at remember what brother Aon
[59:22] Oglesby preached a little bit about a
[59:23] camp he said thy rod David said thy rod
[59:26] and thy staff they comfort me now you
[59:28] look at a shepherd's Crook and a
[59:30] shepherd's staff the crook is for the
[59:32] Sheep the rod is for the animals that
[59:34] come after the Sheep so one is for their
[59:36] defense and one is for their training
[59:39] and
[59:40] teaching there's a little bit of both
[59:42] going on so when we go out of church and
[59:44] we've receiv received correction we
[59:45] ought to say praise the Lord because he
[59:47] only corrects his children but he
[59:50] encourages his children too and he shows
[59:52] his love and and his appreciation and
[59:55] his encouragement in these things so we
[59:56] ought not to walk outside every time
[59:59] these emotions are built into us for a
[1:00:00] purpose but not to control us not to
[1:00:03] determine these things
[1:00:05] amen so Peter thought that the best
[1:00:08] purpose out of this this this huge uh
[1:00:11] event on on this mountain would be to
[1:00:13] commemorate it with three Tabernacles
[1:00:15] amen and it wasn't God giving him those
[1:00:18] thoughts it was Satan trying to bind the
[1:00:20] church again that's a scary thought this
[1:00:23] is a man with signs wonders or day
[1:00:26] Ministry Justified Sanctified walking
[1:00:29] daily with Jesus and he's under a
[1:00:31] satanic inspiration and interpretation
[1:00:33] of the Transfiguration of Jesus
[1:00:36] Christ we have to be so careful church
[1:00:39] because in ourselves we can get caught
[1:00:41] up and Peter got caught up a little bit
[1:00:43] here
[1:00:45] amen emotion is just a
[1:00:48] response to something else amen it's not
[1:00:51] inspiration emotion is not inspiration
[1:00:53] and emotion will not hold us
[1:00:56] I'm not super emotional I've gotten more
[1:00:57] emotional as life goes on for some
[1:00:59] reason I trust it's the softening of the
[1:01:02] spirit that's what I'd like to think
[1:01:04] maybe not but I get more emotional as
[1:01:07] time goes on Amen but that won't hold us
[1:01:10] Supernatural events won't hold us
[1:01:12] what'll Hold Us is when the Holy Spirit
[1:01:14] anchors the word in our soul for
[1:01:16] eternity that's what's going to hold us
[1:01:18] and that's what Peter didn't have here
[1:01:21] ra says it this way he says I'm so sick
[1:01:24] and tired of seeing little petty
[1:01:27] Hollywood revivals so-called where
[1:01:29] people come in and get emotionally
[1:01:31] stirred up for a couple hours or a day
[1:01:33] or two or a week or two and go out and
[1:01:36] that's all of it we call it Camp
[1:01:40] syndrome right Revival syndrome where
[1:01:43] all you only have the victory for as
[1:01:45] long as the emotions and the feelings of
[1:01:47] that Revival are in you and then when
[1:01:49] it's gone guess what you're right back
[1:01:51] to where you were
[1:01:52] before that's not Revival
[1:01:56] that's emotional stirring it's a
[1:01:58] Hollywood Revival it's a pretend Revival
[1:02:02] it doesn't mean the spirit of God wasn't
[1:02:03] there it doesn't mean the true word
[1:02:05] wasn't preached but it means that you
[1:02:06] received a motion not an implanting of
[1:02:09] the word of God that anchored
[1:02:12] amen that's the
[1:02:14] difference he says brother you can be
[1:02:16] worked up by a Revival you can have
[1:02:18] emotion you can have good intentions all
[1:02:21] those things are fine but we don't need
[1:02:23] that today he says we need a baptism of
[1:02:26] the Holy Spirit to change the emotion
[1:02:29] and the intellect and the view the
[1:02:31] habits the life of the people and put
[1:02:34] them back on the right road again he
[1:02:36] says outside of a blood transfusion from
[1:02:39] Calvary all our reformations won't do
[1:02:42] any good at all and we see it with Peter
[1:02:45] Peter is the epitome of emotional
[1:02:48] religion he's so passionate he's so
[1:02:51] caught up he's so committed he has all
[1:02:54] the right words he's got the Zeal there
[1:02:56] and nothing seems to Anchor him down
[1:02:59] amen he's got tons of opinions tons of
[1:03:02] ideas tons of inspiration and it's
[1:03:04] rarely correct because he's so wrapped
[1:03:07] up in these things he means nothing but
[1:03:10] good but left to his own devices left to
[1:03:13] that inspiration Peter would lead
[1:03:14] himself to destruction and he'd led a
[1:03:16] bunch of other people with it as well
[1:03:18] church we are sheep we are sheep that's
[1:03:21] why we need a shepherd and sheep are the
[1:03:25] dumbest animals there are they can't
[1:03:28] defend themselves they can't lead
[1:03:30] themselves they can't feed themselves
[1:03:32] they need somebody watching over them
[1:03:36] 247 and from the pulpit all the way back
[1:03:40] we're all sheep we need a Shepherd we
[1:03:42] need a guide we need a
[1:03:44] guard we need somebody that can take us
[1:03:47] through amen this human nature this
[1:03:49] sheep nature it's destructive it's
[1:03:51] deceptive it's delusional all these
[1:03:54] things come on that's what we are in
[1:03:56] this human nature amen listen Peter's
[1:03:59] not an atheist Peter's not an Infidel
[1:04:01] Peter has been raised uh under the word
[1:04:04] of God serving the one true God and he's
[1:04:07] still getting it
[1:04:09] wrong it goes to show our parents
[1:04:12] raising us right is not going to settle
[1:04:14] us it's not going to Anchor us it's not
[1:04:16] going to give us the new birth we need a
[1:04:19] personal experience with Jesus Christ to
[1:04:22] settle our soul amen it takes that
[1:04:24] personal experience
[1:04:26] he says now many of them teach that just
[1:04:28] to come up and be recognized before the
[1:04:30] congregation and so forth as a sinner
[1:04:32] that you want to accept Christ as a
[1:04:34] personal savior that that is the new
[1:04:36] birth he says many believe that water
[1:04:37] baptism is the new birth and some of
[1:04:39] them believe that you're born of the
[1:04:41] water when you're baptized in the water
[1:04:42] and there's so many different versions
[1:04:44] of it lots of them many believe that to
[1:04:46] recite a Creed and Believe on a doctrine
[1:04:48] of a church just accept and say I
[1:04:50] believe in the holy church of Soo I
[1:04:52] believe God to be the savior of man and
[1:04:54] so forth and from this day on become a
[1:04:56] member of this church and fellowship
[1:04:57] with the Christians they believe that's
[1:04:59] born again he says he says and although
[1:05:02] the Creed that they reite I do not
[1:05:04] believe that they that we could
[1:05:05] criticize it some of them are pure and
[1:05:08] holy some of them are real scriptural he
[1:05:10] says but the scripture is not applied in
[1:05:13] the right
[1:05:14] place listen Satan preaches out of the
[1:05:19] Bible he just misapplies the scripture
[1:05:22] you say brother JN how do you know that
[1:05:23] because that's what he did with Jesus
[1:05:26] it is
[1:05:27] written and Jesus would say it is also
[1:05:31] written Peter's pre or Satan preaches
[1:05:34] straight out of the Bible Church but he
[1:05:35] twists it he misapplies it he says and
[1:05:39] even applying the scripture I believe
[1:05:41] that the new birth is something beyond
[1:05:42] that even though how well you might mean
[1:05:45] it I believe that the new birth is far
[1:05:48] beyond your good intentions and your
[1:05:50] thoughts and Minds he says it's beyond
[1:05:52] that you want a great example of that
[1:05:53] look at the Apostle Paul before he was
[1:05:56] converted Paul was a man that was taught
[1:05:58] by gel in the scriptures the greatest
[1:06:01] teacher one of the greatest teachers of
[1:06:02] that time Paul sat at his feet Paul
[1:06:05] learned the scriptures Paul applied the
[1:06:07] scriptures and in applying those
[1:06:09] scriptures with Zeal he persecuted
[1:06:11] Christ in the true
[1:06:13] church why under a natural influence not
[1:06:17] that of the Holy Spirit and that means
[1:06:19] it's satanic if it's not the holy spirit
[1:06:20] it's got to be satanic amen so Peter's
[1:06:23] been taught Peter's been trained Peter's
[1:06:24] been around the super Supernatural
[1:06:26] events of Jesus ministry he's had it
[1:06:28] operating through him and yet he is
[1:06:30] still not where he needs to
[1:06:32] be is Peter a child of God yes but Peter
[1:06:37] is not yet converted and that's what
[1:06:39] need needs to happen inside of his life
[1:06:41] and we see at the at the even the very
[1:06:43] end of Jesus Ministry in the Last Supper
[1:06:45] we see that Jesus pointing to the
[1:06:47] hardship and the difficulties coming
[1:06:48] ahead and we we see how how Peter just
[1:06:51] can't seem to get things right we read
[1:06:53] this last time and it said the Lord said
[1:06:55] Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to
[1:06:59] have you that he may sift you his wheat
[1:07:01] remember in the old days when they
[1:07:02] brought in wheat they bring it in and it
[1:07:04] was attached to stocks you know you your
[1:07:06] wheat you know it stands about this tall
[1:07:08] when it's when it's healthy and and
[1:07:09] ready for Harvest and so they just go in
[1:07:11] and they they bind it in sheeps and they
[1:07:13] bring it in and they beat it with a
[1:07:15] stick to get all of the wheat kernels
[1:07:17] off but when they do that they get
[1:07:18] lighter portions that aren't good to eat
[1:07:20] it's called chaff and so what they do
[1:07:22] then after they've beaten it with a
[1:07:24] stick is they throw it up in in the air
[1:07:25] and they let the wind take away the
[1:07:27] lightweight stuff which is the junk and
[1:07:29] the kernels fall back down and that's
[1:07:30] the good stuff and Jesus is saying Peter
[1:07:33] Satan wants to take you and he wants to
[1:07:35] beat The Living Daylights out of you and
[1:07:37] then he wants you to throw you up into
[1:07:38] the storms of life and let him just
[1:07:40] scatter you that's what God that's what
[1:07:42] Satan wants to do remember what Jesus
[1:07:44] said the thief cometh not but to kill
[1:07:46] and destroy Satan has no good intentions
[1:07:49] for any of us if you're a child of God
[1:07:51] he definitely doesn't but even for his
[1:07:54] own children he has nothing good
[1:07:55] intended for you because he's contrary
[1:07:57] to
[1:07:58] God he says Satan this or Peter Satan
[1:08:02] wants to destroy
[1:08:05] you beat you up and then just leave you
[1:08:07] on the side of the
[1:08:09] road but I have prayed for thee
[1:08:14] Hallelujah that what thy faith fail
[1:08:19] not and when thou art converted
[1:08:23] strengthen thy Brethren notice here what
[1:08:24] he says Peter
[1:08:26] does he say Peter that your courage fail
[1:08:28] not that your morals fail
[1:08:31] not no he says Peter that your faith
[1:08:34] fail not why is that church because
[1:08:37] Peter faith comes by hearing and hearing
[1:08:41] comes by the word and Peter has attached
[1:08:43] himself to the word of God long before
[1:08:45] this he said to whom else can we go thou
[1:08:49] Hast the words of life and his faith was
[1:08:52] there even if his courage wasn't there
[1:08:54] even if his strength wasn't there even
[1:08:55] if his discipline wasn't there Peter's
[1:08:57] Faith was there and so it's not Peter's
[1:08:59] Faith that's going to hold him it's the
[1:09:01] faith of God in Peter in his word that's
[1:09:03] going to hold Peter through this and
[1:09:06] he's he's he's prophesying to Peter he
[1:09:07] says Peter here's what I've done and
[1:09:10] here's the effect of that you're going
[1:09:12] to be converted and when you do Peter go
[1:09:14] strengthen your
[1:09:15] brethren and he said unto
[1:09:18] him Lord I am ready to go with thee both
[1:09:23] into prison and to death
[1:09:26] now did Peter mean this
[1:09:29] church I think Peter thought he meant
[1:09:32] it but Peter stirred up with
[1:09:37] emotion but when push comes to shove
[1:09:40] Peter's not going to do this Peter's not
[1:09:42] even willing to identify with him much
[1:09:44] less go to prison or
[1:09:47] death we've got to be careful how we say
[1:09:51] things we see here words are cheap words
[1:09:54] are cheap
[1:09:57] but it takes something in us to make it
[1:09:59] live and Peter's got all the
[1:10:02] bravado of a lion here and yet when the
[1:10:05] moment comes he's going to skull away
[1:10:07] like a little
[1:10:11] alleycat and he said I tell thee Peter
[1:10:14] the shall not Crow this day before
[1:10:16] thou Hast shalt Thrice deny that thou
[1:10:19] knowest me I want to take us over to
[1:10:21] Matthew 26 because Matthew uh opens up
[1:10:24] this a little bit
[1:10:26] it says and Jesus saith unto them all ye
[1:10:29] shall be offended because of me this
[1:10:31] night for it is written I will Smite the
[1:10:33] shepher and the sheep of the flock shall
[1:10:34] be scattered abroad Jesus is prophesying
[1:10:38] using the scripture that's already
[1:10:40] written and he says all of
[1:10:42] you is Jesus a prophet yes it's the word
[1:10:47] he's the word speaking the word what he
[1:10:49] says is true he cannot tell a lie now we
[1:10:51] see Peter flare up here sorry and then
[1:10:53] he says but after I'm risen again again
[1:10:56] I will go before you into Galilee so
[1:10:58] their failure is not going to stop him
[1:10:59] from coming back to them what a
[1:11:01] wonderful thing to hear you're going to
[1:11:03] fail but I'm going to still come to you
[1:11:05] he says but then je Peter answered and
[1:11:07] said unto him though all men shall be
[1:11:09] offended because of thee yet will I
[1:11:13] never be
[1:11:15] offended brother Mark Here I
[1:11:18] Come Peter says
[1:11:22] Jesus this guy he's going to fail you
[1:11:25] sister Moren you're going to fail him
[1:11:28] brother Bob brother Bob sister Brenda
[1:11:31] they're definitely going to fail him
[1:11:32] sister Justine we already know you
[1:11:33] failed Him Sister Lydia it's
[1:11:36] coming brother Levi yeah right but
[1:11:40] me me I'll never do
[1:11:44] that can you imagine Church stabbing
[1:11:48] your fellow brothers and sisters in the
[1:11:51] back though they do it
[1:11:55] I won't do it I would never do
[1:11:59] that come
[1:12:02] on that's what Peter's
[1:12:06] saying Jesus said unto him verily I say
[1:12:08] unto thee that this night before the
[1:12:10] Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and
[1:12:15] Peter said unto him though I should die
[1:12:18] with thee yet will I not deny thee
[1:12:22] likewise also said all the disciples Les
[1:12:26] my favorite phrase delusions of
[1:12:28] Competency this is not about competency
[1:12:30] this is about commitment Peter is so
[1:12:32] delusional in his own
[1:12:36] strength I'll never deny you I'll die
[1:12:39] with you tonight before I deny
[1:12:41] you everyone says yeah me
[1:12:44] too
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:48] right I love how Jesus comes
[1:12:51] back Jesus says nevertheless what I say
[1:12:55] is
[1:12:57] true he says but I'm going to take you
[1:12:59] through Peter I've already prayed you
[1:13:02] through Peter I'm not going to look at
[1:13:04] your
[1:13:05] failure I'm going to take you through
[1:13:07] and the work that I do because you turn
[1:13:09] me down it'll perfect you and it'll
[1:13:12] bring you to a place where you can
[1:13:14] actually live the word you're talking
[1:13:16] about Jesus held him to his words you'll
[1:13:19] notice it was just a little further down
[1:13:21] the road than Peter
[1:13:23] anticipated Jesus says Peter I God made
[1:13:25] a preparation for you I love that
[1:13:28] knowing our failures knowing the
[1:13:32] certainty of our
[1:13:34] failures he has a way prepared for every
[1:13:36] single one of us to make it
[1:13:39] through he said before the has
[1:13:42] throw three crowed three times you'll
[1:13:45] have denied me Thrice three times he
[1:13:48] said but Peter I pray for you he says
[1:13:50] listen that's not all of it see Satan
[1:13:54] will remind us of the failures he'll
[1:13:57] remind us of the things we don't do
[1:13:59] he'll remind us of the things we won't
[1:14:01] do he'll remind us of the things we
[1:14:03] can't do and Jesus says Peter it's true
[1:14:07] you're going to fail but that's not all
[1:14:09] of it let's hear the full counsel of God
[1:14:12] he says I have prayed for you and after
[1:14:15] you are converted then strengthen your
[1:14:17] brethren after you are converted he had
[1:14:19] shouted he had probably danced in the
[1:14:21] spirit he had done all kinds of things
[1:14:23] but he hadn't received the Holy Ghost
[1:14:24] yet and he said after you are converted
[1:14:27] then strengthen your brethren he says
[1:14:29] that's true carry out his plan I love
[1:14:32] how God can tell the truth about us even
[1:14:34] when it's not so great but he never
[1:14:36] leaves us in that condition and he says
[1:14:39] to Peter he says Peter when I'm done
[1:14:41] with you you'll be converted and when
[1:14:44] you're converted you go help people that
[1:14:46] are in the same condition you are right
[1:14:48] now Peter you go have patience for
[1:14:51] people that can't seem to get it right
[1:14:53] Peter you go have Grace for people that
[1:14:55] talk more way above where they live
[1:14:58] Peter you go have some
[1:15:00] longsuffering for people that can't seem
[1:15:02] to get it right he says because freely
[1:15:05] you've receed freely
[1:15:07] give Peter you go be me to
[1:15:12] them after you've been
[1:15:16] converted we all know the story that
[1:15:18] follows Peter is in the garden he can't
[1:15:22] even pray with Jesus he's the he's one
[1:15:24] of the three that Jesus pulls forward
[1:15:25] with them and he says hey come pray for
[1:15:26] me pray with me help me out here and
[1:15:29] they all keep falling asleep then when
[1:15:31] everybody comes and they arrest Jesus
[1:15:33] Peter draws out his sword and he cuts
[1:15:35] off the ear of the servant of the high
[1:15:36] priest Jesus heals it says Peter put it
[1:15:38] away whoever lives by the sword dies by
[1:15:40] the sword again completely in wrongly
[1:15:42] interpreting the situation and then they
[1:15:44] take Jesus to the high priest's home and
[1:15:46] Peter follows after Jesus and he's out
[1:15:49] there and he's by the fire trying to
[1:15:51] stay warm and three times people come up
[1:15:54] to him and they say hey you're a
[1:15:56] disciple of Jesus aren't you and he
[1:15:58] denies and he denies and he denies and
[1:16:01] in fact the third time the scripture
[1:16:02] says he curses and
[1:16:04] swears now that's not foul language like
[1:16:06] we would say today but in those days
[1:16:08] they would invoke a judgment from God to
[1:16:12] to to to make it uh abundantly clear
[1:16:15] that they were telling the truth so he
[1:16:16] might have said may God strike me dead
[1:16:19] if I'm a disciple of
[1:16:21] Jesus that doesn't sound like the Peter
[1:16:23] that said I'll go to prison end to Death
[1:16:25] will it he completely fails in the
[1:16:29] moment and the scripture says that as
[1:16:31] soon as he says that on the third time
[1:16:34] Jesus looks at him Jesus could see this
[1:16:37] and hear this going on the whole
[1:16:39] time and then Jesus looks at him and
[1:16:41] then the rooster cowls three times and
[1:16:43] what does Peter do he runs away and he
[1:16:45] weeps bitterly the scripture says
[1:16:48] completely
[1:16:51] demoralized all his Revelation all his
[1:16:53] passion all his excitement and all his
[1:16:55] signs and wonders and when push comes to
[1:16:57] shove and his life is on the line maybe
[1:16:59] he denies Christ
[1:17:00] completely Peter lost everything he
[1:17:03] thought he had at that
[1:17:05] moment this is a horrible horrible day
[1:17:09] for
[1:17:10] Peter he thought he was so great he
[1:17:13] thought he had it all he you know he
[1:17:15] he's going to have the keys to the
[1:17:16] kingdom he's got the Cornerstone the the
[1:17:19] foundational Revelation he's got signs
[1:17:20] and wonders and in one moment everything
[1:17:23] disappears and he's got nothing and he's
[1:17:26] out and he's hiding himself away from
[1:17:28] everybody scared to death total complete
[1:17:31] failure in his own eyes we see after
[1:17:33] this that Peter is scared he goes and he
[1:17:35] HS up in a room with the other disciples
[1:17:38] hiding from the Jews and the authorities
[1:17:39] because he doesn't want to be jailed or
[1:17:41] or killed and then the women come and
[1:17:42] tell him that Jesus is written risen and
[1:17:45] he doesn't believe
[1:17:47] that all faith is gone Church it would
[1:17:50] seem all Revelation gone but I want you
[1:17:53] to catch something
[1:17:56] because when the women are there and the
[1:17:58] angel speaks to them the angel gives
[1:18:00] them a message and remember an angel
[1:18:02] speaks as the Oracle of God angels don't
[1:18:05] speak of their own they come with a
[1:18:07] message so this is a Heavenly message
[1:18:09] that the Angels give the women and look
[1:18:11] at this amen I want you to catch this
[1:18:14] this is so beautiful and the angel said
[1:18:16] but go your way tell his
[1:18:20] disciples and
[1:18:22] Peter you know why Church because Peter
[1:18:25] didn't think he was his disciple anymore
[1:18:27] Peter thought he'd failed one too many
[1:18:30] times go and tell my his disciples and
[1:18:33] Peter that he goeth before you into
[1:18:35] Galilee and there shall you see him as
[1:18:38] he said unto you I literally cried
[1:18:40] yesterday when I read that when I was
[1:18:42] studying because Peter has failed and
[1:18:44] failed and failed he's no doubt in the
[1:18:46] depths of Despair he's despondent he's
[1:18:49] wore out he's scared he's fearful he's
[1:18:52] helpless he's hopeless he's worthless
[1:18:54] he's lost and God sends him a personal
[1:18:57] message go tell
[1:19:00] Peter go tell Peter that his failures
[1:19:03] and his his absolute rejection of Christ
[1:19:07] has not stopped him he goes before you
[1:19:10] into Galilee Peter and he'll meet you
[1:19:13] there Peter what you have done will not
[1:19:16] stop him from coming to you
[1:19:19] again Peter made have thought he crossed
[1:19:21] the line he says make sure you let Peter
[1:19:24] know I personally called him out go
[1:19:27] there Peter I'm going to meet you it's
[1:19:29] going to be
[1:19:32] okay and yet even after that message
[1:19:34] Church Peter doesn't believe yet Peter
[1:19:38] gets a message from an angel and he
[1:19:40] disbelieves it he goes to the tomb and
[1:19:42] the scripture says he wonders about it
[1:19:45] he doesn't believe he's risen just goes
[1:19:47] to show Church even a message from
[1:19:49] almighty God won't do the dirt do the
[1:19:51] work it takes the holy spirit in our
[1:19:54] lives to Anchor us it's the only thing
[1:19:57] that'll do it finally after that we see
[1:20:00] that Jesus meets with him and the other
[1:20:02] disciples he spends 30 to 40 days with
[1:20:04] them and yet we see in all of that that
[1:20:06] Peter is reverted to his old way of life
[1:20:09] we would say Peter's backsliding he's
[1:20:11] forsaken his ministry he's forsaken the
[1:20:15] everything that had to do with Jesus
[1:20:16] ministry he's back
[1:20:18] fishing that's all he's
[1:20:20] doing he's fishing
[1:20:24] nothing to do with moving the gospel or
[1:20:26] the kingdom of God forward gave up on
[1:20:29] his ministry gave up on his his walk
[1:20:31] with Christ really I think Peter gave up
[1:20:32] on
[1:20:34] himself I keep failing I'm just not
[1:20:37] going to try anymore and so he went back
[1:20:40] to doing what he could only do
[1:20:42] fish you can see Peter's just beating
[1:20:45] himself on these things but yet in the
[1:20:47] end Peter is one of the 12 that's
[1:20:50] commissioned by Jesus to go forth and
[1:20:53] preach it's an interesting in thought to
[1:20:55] consider how much they' done in their
[1:20:56] Ministries and yet Jesus said but until
[1:20:59] you go and preach you've got to go and
[1:21:02] T they had done signs and wonders they
[1:21:04] had preached the gospel they' healed the
[1:21:06] sick they'd raised the dead they cast
[1:21:07] out demons and Jesus says you're not yet
[1:21:09] fit to preach this gospel listen they
[1:21:12] were fit to preach the past gospel but
[1:21:15] that was not the true gospel it was
[1:21:16] pointing to the message coming it was
[1:21:18] pointing to the true one their first one
[1:21:20] they preached by experience and it was
[1:21:22] of God God was in it God ano to them for
[1:21:25] it but Jesus says for this one you need
[1:21:27] a personal experience as well before you
[1:21:29] can preach this you got to know what
[1:21:31] you're preaching not up here you got to
[1:21:34] have it in
[1:21:36] here this is what he said in Luke he
[1:21:38] said and he said unto them thus it is
[1:21:40] written and thus it beho Christ to
[1:21:42] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[1:21:43] third day and that repentance and
[1:21:45] remission of sin should be preached in
[1:21:47] his name among all nations beginning at
[1:21:49] Jerusalem it's that message of
[1:21:51] reconciliation we spoke about he says
[1:21:53] and ye are Witness of these things you
[1:21:55] have been you are and you're going to be
[1:21:57] Witnesses of these things they're going
[1:21:59] to have a personal witness not a hearsay
[1:22:01] witness it's God to be personal to them
[1:22:03] they have to experience it themselves he
[1:22:06] says and behold I send the promise of my
[1:22:09] father upon you but te ye in the city of
[1:22:11] Jerusalem until ye be endued with power
[1:22:15] from on high there is no commentary here
[1:22:17] on Peter's mistakes Jesus is holding
[1:22:20] nothing against Peter Church why there's
[1:22:23] no expectation of conduct to an
[1:22:25] unconverted
[1:22:27] believer you're on your own it it's a
[1:22:30] personal choice day by day but you don't
[1:22:32] have power so he's not holding against
[1:22:34] them that they acted in a way consistent
[1:22:37] with not having power but he says you
[1:22:39] need power to move home from here you
[1:22:41] can't move on unless you have power amen
[1:22:44] he's saying Peter I still want to spend
[1:22:45] time with you Peter I still want to be
[1:22:47] with you Peter I forgive you and I paid
[1:22:50] your mistakes but Peter you need more
[1:22:52] than you've had before Peter you need to
[1:22:53] go get some power before we can move
[1:22:57] forward Jesus wasn't harboring a grudge
[1:22:59] against Peter so the only thing that
[1:23:01] could hurt Peter was Peter's issues with
[1:23:04] himself Peter needed that conscience
[1:23:06] Purge as brother Grant talked about
[1:23:08] Peter needed a cleansing of his soul so
[1:23:11] that he could move forward but I love
[1:23:13] how Jesus said to Peter Peter I prayed
[1:23:15] that your faith won't fail and we see
[1:23:18] here that Peter only has enough Faith to
[1:23:20] obey the word to take him to the upper
[1:23:23] room
[1:23:24] doesn't have faith to do anything
[1:23:26] else he only has Faith to take him to
[1:23:29] the upper room
[1:23:30] church that's all God has to give us is
[1:23:33] Faith for the step we're
[1:23:35] taking too often we're sitting here and
[1:23:37] we're looking forward to everything
[1:23:39] that's coming All the Troubles all the
[1:23:42] trials all the problems all the
[1:23:44] questions all the concerns and we're
[1:23:46] saying Lord I don't have faith for that
[1:23:48] but all he needs to give us is Faith for
[1:23:50] today to take the next step when we take
[1:23:53] that step he'll give us faith and life
[1:23:55] for the next step he has revealed the
[1:23:57] whole Plan of
[1:24:00] Redemption but he's only given them
[1:24:02] faith for the first part don't get ahead
[1:24:05] of ourselves church that's when we get
[1:24:07] ahead of God and we lose Faith because
[1:24:09] we're trying to do tomorrow to today
[1:24:12] what is going to be done tomorrow go and
[1:24:14] do what he's given you faith for today
[1:24:16] Peter just needed Faith to obey and then
[1:24:19] stay until God does the work and until
[1:24:23] then just stay awaited out amen your
[1:24:26] faith is just meant for this step this
[1:24:28] trial this question this concern this
[1:24:32] hardship Jesus just said obey my word
[1:24:35] and
[1:24:36] T have faith to T Peter and I'll do the
[1:24:40] rest of the
[1:24:43] work we know that Peter was with the 120
[1:24:45] or the 119 others in the upper room that
[1:24:48] receed the spirit and we see this
[1:24:49] dramatic shift in Peter as soon as he
[1:24:51] comes down from that room cuz before
[1:24:53] this Peter was hiding out Peter was back
[1:24:56] to his old way of living he wanted
[1:24:57] nothing to do with Ministry he wasn't
[1:24:59] associated with Christ but we see that
[1:25:02] after Peter receives the baptism of the
[1:25:04] holy spirit in his soul not an anointing
[1:25:06] on him but an anointing in him we see
[1:25:09] this completely uh dramatic shift in his
[1:25:11] life amen and it's not that Peter
[1:25:13] doesn't have emotion or passion anymore
[1:25:16] like I said before Peter's got that
[1:25:17] Bulldog
[1:25:19] faith God made us passionate for a
[1:25:23] reason it's okay to be
[1:25:26] passionate but that isn't the driver
[1:25:29] that's not the lead it's not the guide
[1:25:30] amen I believe that God used Peter just
[1:25:33] as he was amen but Peter's not a loose
[1:25:35] cannon anymore anybody know what a loose
[1:25:38] cannon is it's a nautical term see in
[1:25:41] the old days they had these huge Wooden
[1:25:43] Ships these great battleships and they
[1:25:46] would have cannon on them but you have
[1:25:48] to realize that on a ship everything has
[1:25:50] to be tied down and so these these
[1:25:52] cannons they would ride in rails and
[1:25:54] they'd have ropes that would limited
[1:25:55] them so that when they fired the cannon
[1:25:57] it would rock back the ropes would catch
[1:26:00] it and it would stay in the grooves and
[1:26:02] then they winch it forward and then they
[1:26:03] reload it and they fire again but the
[1:26:06] thing is with a loose cannon when it
[1:26:08] fired the first time you might hit the
[1:26:09] enemy but the problem with the Loose
[1:26:11] Cannon is that one or two of the ropes
[1:26:13] had let go and it got out of the grooves
[1:26:15] and so now the cannon is rolling around
[1:26:18] in a ship that's doing this constantly
[1:26:20] so the first thing out of a loose cannon
[1:26:22] was you maybe hurt the enemy but after
[1:26:23] that it's rolling around the the the the
[1:26:26] the the ship and it's running over
[1:26:28] equipment and people and it was
[1:26:30] supremely
[1:26:31] dangerous you didn't want loose cannons
[1:26:34] on ships they could literally sink a
[1:26:36] ship one Loose Cannon and that's what
[1:26:39] Peter was before this sometimes he hit
[1:26:41] the mark but most of the time he
[1:26:44] didn't but Peter comes down from on the
[1:26:46] day of Pentecost church and Peter never
[1:26:49] misses the mark he hits it perfect every
[1:26:53] single time
[1:26:55] remember but we see even up in the upper
[1:26:57] room he was still a loose cannon
[1:26:59] remember what he did he drove the
[1:27:01] choosing of ma of Matias as the
[1:27:04] replacement Apostle for Judas and he
[1:27:07] completely forgot that God chooses the
[1:27:09] apostles not men Peter's still under
[1:27:12] that denominational influence that we
[1:27:14] see all throughout this he's still a
[1:27:15] loose cannon out there and poor Matias
[1:27:18] got put into a situation where he never
[1:27:19] thrived because he wasn't meant to be
[1:27:21] there he got tied in based on that
[1:27:24] Apostles
[1:27:25] decisions but then Peter comes down
[1:27:28] after he receives the Holy Spirit and he
[1:27:30] comes down from the upper room and he
[1:27:32] hits the mark perfectly because now
[1:27:34] Peter's under a new
[1:27:36] inspiration there's a difference now in
[1:27:39] Peter it says in Acts 2 it says and
[1:27:41] Peter standing with the 11 lifted up his
[1:27:44] voice see before this Peter wouldn't
[1:27:46] stand and be counted and recognized now
[1:27:48] he stands up with all of them and he
[1:27:50] said unto them ye men of Judea and all
[1:27:52] ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[1:27:54] unto you and hearken to my words for
[1:27:57] these are not drunken as ye suppose seen
[1:27:59] it is but the third hour of the day but
[1:28:01] this is that which is spoken by the
[1:28:04] prophet Joel Church Peter's gotten over
[1:28:06] his past Peter's not preaching about
[1:28:09] himself anymore Peter's not worried
[1:28:11] about himself he's saying we've received
[1:28:13] the promise and he takes them back into
[1:28:15] the word Peter's gotten over his fear of
[1:28:17] being identified with Christ Peter's
[1:28:20] gotten over his fear of being seen in
[1:28:22] public and identified with the message
[1:28:24] of the hour Peter's gotten over his
[1:28:26] worries about saving his
[1:28:28] life he's gotten over his concerns of
[1:28:30] what people will think about him too why
[1:28:33] Church why is Peter different because
[1:28:35] Peter went up into that room but Christ
[1:28:38] came down out of it it's not Peter
[1:28:41] anymore it's the spirit of Christ Living
[1:28:43] in Peter that is speaking now oh it's
[1:28:46] still in a body of flesh called Peter
[1:28:48] but there's a different voice there's a
[1:28:50] different inspiration there's a life
[1:28:52] inside of Peter that has to come out
[1:28:55] it's not Peter speaking now it's Christ
[1:28:57] speaking through him it's the spirit of
[1:29:00] truth that was promised to him coming
[1:29:02] down and Peter yielding to the spirit of
[1:29:05] Truth hits the mark every single time
[1:29:08] it's not Peter opening the word it's the
[1:29:10] spirit opening the word it's not Peter
[1:29:13] speaking it's the spirit speaking
[1:29:15] through Peter he's a yielded vessel
[1:29:18] rather than trying to do it on his own
[1:29:21] Amen brother Brown would say this he
[1:29:23] says but if you just try to do it you're
[1:29:26] going to fail and you have to fail
[1:29:30] that's the reason you have your ups and
[1:29:31] downs and ins and outs and all the
[1:29:33] things you're doing it's because you try
[1:29:35] to do it you you say oh I believe I'm
[1:29:38] all right now that isn't it he says no
[1:29:41] it's the holy spirit that comes in he
[1:29:44] takes the place he takes out all the old
[1:29:46] roots of bitterness the old anger the
[1:29:48] temper and jealousy and the love of the
[1:29:50] world of things takes it all out of you
[1:29:52] and then you're a new creature
[1:29:55] brother Grant had preached that that
[1:29:56] wonderful portion of that service on the
[1:29:58] purging of the conscience being required
[1:30:00] for Perfection amen I want you to
[1:30:03] consider this morning how far Peter had
[1:30:05] fallen from Grace if we could say it
[1:30:06] that way three times denied Christ swore
[1:30:10] and orth he wasn't part of his disciples
[1:30:12] went back to his old way of living
[1:30:14] disbelieved Christ have raised from the
[1:30:16] dead denominational thinking from start
[1:30:18] to finish
[1:30:20] almost and yet Peter comes down and he
[1:30:22] has had his conscience completely
[1:30:26] purged Church Peter wasn't hung up on
[1:30:28] himself
[1:30:29] anymore good or bad see that's the thing
[1:30:33] so often we want to be set free from the
[1:30:35] bad we've got to be set free from the
[1:30:37] good as well cuz Peter's good ideas and
[1:30:39] intentions were all contrary to the word
[1:30:41] of God Peter comes down and he doesn't
[1:30:44] have a thought in his mind of what he's
[1:30:46] going to do it is the spirit of God now
[1:30:49] flowing through him see Peter's been
[1:30:52] purged from his sin from his conscience
[1:30:56] but he's been purged from his dead works
[1:30:58] of trying to do it his way see you can
[1:31:00] be forgiven but you got to come into the
[1:31:02] yielding part as well that's part of the
[1:31:05] purging that's part of the Perfection
[1:31:07] amen and now Peter comes down and he's
[1:31:09] not just unburdened by sin but he's
[1:31:11] unburdened by his own stinking
[1:31:14] thinking that's what Peter needed power
[1:31:16] over was his own nature his own ideas
[1:31:19] his own thoughts his own appear his own
[1:31:22] opinions and now he's yielded to the
[1:31:24] spirit and Peter's been
[1:31:26] purged and in that purging he has
[1:31:29] stepped into
[1:31:30] Perfection not sinless Perfection
[1:31:33] yielded
[1:31:35] Perfection yielded
[1:31:37] Perfection he says what do you care what
[1:31:40] the world thinks what do you care what
[1:31:42] your neighbor thinks he says our
[1:31:44] conscience has died and we're
[1:31:47] regenerated and Born Again by the spirit
[1:31:49] of God to serve the true and living God
[1:31:54] we ought to be able to stand up and say
[1:31:56] I am a child of God I believe in Jesus
[1:32:00] Christ I believe he's the way the truth
[1:32:03] and the life and there is none other
[1:32:04] than him we need to be able to stand up
[1:32:07] and be identified Church we're going to
[1:32:09] be tested on that if you haven't you
[1:32:11] will be if you're a child of God Amen
[1:32:13] but we see here now Peter ain't a loose
[1:32:15] cannon Peter is a weapon in the hand of
[1:32:18] God it's not Peter Swinging The Sword
[1:32:20] it's God swinging Peter amen that's what
[1:32:23] we're talking about here and what is he
[1:32:25] doing he's got the it's it's the
[1:32:27] discernment of the word and it goes in
[1:32:28] and it sees where the people are at it
[1:32:30] sees the need and it brings a solution
[1:32:32] with them amen because Peter has not
[1:32:34] only caught the inspiration of the
[1:32:37] message he has manifested the very
[1:32:39] message that he's talking about see it's
[1:32:41] not about getting up here and preaching
[1:32:43] it's about getting up here and
[1:32:45] demonstrating that we have what we're
[1:32:46] talking
[1:32:47] about amen we are not to be talkers
[1:32:50] we're to be
[1:32:51] Walkers let our talk match our walk and
[1:32:54] Peter comes down Peter is not preaching
[1:32:56] Peter is the preaching Peter's had his
[1:33:00] conscience purged that's why he's
[1:33:01] preaching a reconciling message CU he
[1:33:04] knows the message of reconciliation
[1:33:05] Works cuz his conscience has been purged
[1:33:08] he knows that the power of the spirit is
[1:33:10] available not because it's coming but
[1:33:12] because it's here he has it he's a
[1:33:14] personal witness of these things amen
[1:33:17] he's pointing them back to Joel 2:28 and
[1:33:19] Ezekiel 36 and just like Jesus in his
[1:33:22] first sermon said this day this
[1:33:24] scripture is fulfilled Peter under the
[1:33:26] same anointing says this day is this
[1:33:29] scripture fulfilled we're in the word
[1:33:32] brothers and sisters we're in a time
[1:33:34] we're in a season where God is coming
[1:33:36] down to fulfill exactly what he said and
[1:33:38] he said listen you've been looking for
[1:33:40] this and you're looking for the Messiah
[1:33:42] and you missed him but you didn't stop
[1:33:44] him even when you killed him but he's
[1:33:46] come back in the form of the spirit to
[1:33:48] produce the word that he promised to us
[1:33:50] a thousand years
[1:33:52] ago this this day the scriptures
[1:33:54] fulfilled Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:57] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[1:34:01] he's saying he's wien today and he's
[1:34:02] here to live inside of you you killed
[1:34:05] him but he rose again and he's he will
[1:34:07] forgive you if you ask and he'll come in
[1:34:09] and he'll do exactly what he promised so
[1:34:10] many years
[1:34:12] ago Peter preaches the word under the
[1:34:15] true and perfect anointing of the spirit
[1:34:17] of Truth and he got a perfect result why
[1:34:21] he's yielded to perfection that's it
[1:34:25] we're going to get into this a little
[1:34:26] later Peter ain't perfect Peter ain't
[1:34:30] sinless in terms of his
[1:34:32] actions but he's yielded and that's the
[1:34:35] works of
[1:34:36] God Amen remember Jesus said the works
[1:34:39] that I do you shall do also and we
[1:34:41] showed that work was to fulfill the word
[1:34:44] for your day yes it involves preaching
[1:34:47] it involves teaching it involves healing
[1:34:49] it involves signs and wonders it
[1:34:51] involves gifts of the Spirit all these
[1:34:52] different things that that's part and
[1:34:54] parcel of a healthy church amen but to
[1:34:58] to f to do the works of Christ is to do
[1:35:00] what the word says you're supposed to do
[1:35:03] and every age has a certain thing
[1:35:04] they're supposed to do we see in
[1:35:06] Revelation 2 and 3 amen so wherever we
[1:35:09] are whatever our role is whatever our
[1:35:11] responsibility whatever our position
[1:35:13] each one of us has something we're
[1:35:14] supposed to be doomed for the kingdom of
[1:35:16] God and in doing that we are doing the
[1:35:18] very works of Christ not everybody's
[1:35:20] going to lay hands on people and they'll
[1:35:22] be healed but some will
[1:35:25] some will encourage some will raise
[1:35:27] children some will help others raise
[1:35:29] children some will preach some will
[1:35:31] teach some will handle Sunday school
[1:35:32] they'll have offices in the church some
[1:35:34] will be evangelists out in the community
[1:35:36] but every single one of us will do the
[1:35:38] works of Christ because we'll do what
[1:35:39] the word says we're supposed to do in
[1:35:41] our role amen doesn't mean we don't
[1:35:44] battle doesn't mean we don't fight but
[1:35:45] it means we have victory in those things
[1:35:47] and I want you to see the victory in
[1:35:48] Peter because we're talking about a true
[1:35:50] conversion here this morning and I want
[1:35:52] you to see the difference because before
[1:35:54] Peter was Brave with Jesus but as soon
[1:35:56] as he's gone he becomes a coward Peter
[1:35:58] would stand on water but then the
[1:36:00] situation would overcome him Peter would
[1:36:02] declare his intentions to stay close to
[1:36:04] God but then as soon as times get tough
[1:36:06] then Peter just Falls like a limp noodle
[1:36:09] he has no consistency he has no strength
[1:36:11] Peter couldn't hold himself to what he
[1:36:13] said he believed and I believe he
[1:36:15] believed
[1:36:16] it but he needed power to make it work
[1:36:19] that's all that's all but now he comes
[1:36:22] out of a new birth experience in the
[1:36:24] upper room filled with the spirit and
[1:36:26] watch Peter's attitude and actions now
[1:36:28] so Acts 2 he's gone through acts Acts 2
[1:36:31] and preach to them 3,000 Souls saved now
[1:36:33] in Acts three it says now Peter and John
[1:36:35] went up together into the temple at The
[1:36:37] Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and
[1:36:40] a certain man laying from his mother
[1:36:42] womb mother's womb was carried whom they
[1:36:45] laid daily at the Gate of the temple
[1:36:46] which is called Beautiful to ask alms of
[1:36:49] them that entered into the temple who
[1:36:51] seen Peter and John about to go into the
[1:36:52] temple asked in alms and Peter fastening
[1:36:56] his eyes upon him with John said look on
[1:36:59] us and he gave heed unto them expecting
[1:37:01] to receive something of them then Peter
[1:37:04] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:37:07] such as I have give I Thee in the name
[1:37:11] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[1:37:14] walk he says and he took him by the
[1:37:16] right hand and lifted him up and
[1:37:18] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:37:21] Reed strength now a lot of the people
[1:37:23] people in the in in Christendom wrestle
[1:37:25] with this scripture today because they
[1:37:26] say that is a power that was only given
[1:37:29] to the
[1:37:31] apostles they say it's not here
[1:37:33] today well they say that because they
[1:37:35] don't have that experience in their
[1:37:38] church but I want you to consider that
[1:37:41] the power of healing is not what we're
[1:37:44] talking about because Judas had this
[1:37:48] power Judas had power to
[1:37:51] heal so if they're saying that power is
[1:37:53] only for the apostles they've got a
[1:37:55] problem because Judas was the son of
[1:37:57] predition a false pretended brother and
[1:38:01] he had power to
[1:38:02] heal but what is it it's power to yield
[1:38:06] Jesus said you'll do the same works I do
[1:38:08] and Jesus said I do nothing except the
[1:38:10] father shows me first Peter is not going
[1:38:13] around after the day of Pentecost Peter
[1:38:16] see Peter before would have went on a
[1:38:18] Revival high and he would have went and
[1:38:19] he would have healed everyone in
[1:38:21] Jerusalem today Peter goes the day after
[1:38:24] the greatest Revival in Jerusalem Peter
[1:38:27] goes out and how many people does he
[1:38:28] heal
[1:38:30] one why he's yielded he's yielded there
[1:38:34] is a time where they heal everybody but
[1:38:38] this is showing the yielding of Peter
[1:38:41] not the personal wielding of power that
[1:38:43] everybody thinks it
[1:38:45] was this is showing the how specific God
[1:38:48] works and we'll see here that the reason
[1:38:51] is is because they're going to look for
[1:38:52] something to to go after these disciples
[1:38:54] for and this is it it's a public Miracle
[1:38:59] at the temple everybody knows this guy
[1:39:01] he's been there 40 years and what is it
[1:39:04] it's God bringing attention to these
[1:39:06] disciples to the ministry of
[1:39:09] reconciliation amen it's not Peter
[1:39:11] healing now it's the Holy Spirit working
[1:39:14] through Peter telling him what to do
[1:39:16] when and what and how and Peter obeys
[1:39:18] because it's the same thing that Jesus
[1:39:20] did because it's the same spirit it's
[1:39:21] got to work the same way and just as
[1:39:24] they criticized Jesus for healing and
[1:39:26] for what he did they did the same to
[1:39:27] Peter and John in Acts 4 and they pull
[1:39:30] him in front of the Jewish religious
[1:39:31] Council and watch this change now we're
[1:39:33] talking about a true conversion it says
[1:39:35] and they laid hands on them and put them
[1:39:37] in the hold until the next day for it
[1:39:39] was now even tied so they put him in
[1:39:40] their own
[1:39:42] prison but watch Peter's response now in
[1:39:44] the face of criticism I jump to verse
[1:39:46] eight here it says so they they they
[1:39:48] went after him and and these things it
[1:39:50] says then Peter filled with the Holy
[1:39:52] Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the
[1:39:54] people and Elders of the E of Israel if
[1:39:57] you let us go we'll never do this again
[1:39:59] please don't kill
[1:40:01] me
[1:40:03] no that's what Peter would have said
[1:40:06] before he says if we do this day be
[1:40:09] examined of the good deed done to the
[1:40:10] impotent Man by what means he is made
[1:40:13] whole he's saying if we're if if this is
[1:40:15] all about us healing this guy and you're
[1:40:17] wondering how it's done here's your
[1:40:20] answer be it known unto you all and to
[1:40:23] all the people of Israel that by the
[1:40:26] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye
[1:40:28] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[1:40:31] even by him does this man stand before
[1:40:34] you hope Peter ashamed of Jesus Christ
[1:40:38] now he says if you have any question
[1:40:41] about what's gone on it's all down to
[1:40:44] Jesus Christ who you crucified by the
[1:40:46] way Peter's got his boldness
[1:40:50] now he
[1:40:51] said this is the stone which was said at
[1:40:54] not of the builders which has become the
[1:40:56] head of the corner see before Peter had
[1:40:58] this Revelation
[1:41:00] remember the Cornerstone the
[1:41:02] foundational
[1:41:03] Revelation now he's preaching it because
[1:41:06] he knows what it really means
[1:41:08] now he says neither is there salvation
[1:41:11] in any other for there is none other
[1:41:14] name under Heaven given among men
[1:41:15] whereby we must be saved now when they
[1:41:18] saw the
[1:41:20] boldness the same Peter that we used to
[1:41:24] know the boldness of Peter and John and
[1:41:28] perceived that they were wow in
[1:41:32] unlearned and ignorant men they marveled
[1:41:35] why because they were not unlearned and
[1:41:37] they were not ignorant and they had
[1:41:38] nothing that Peter had and they're
[1:41:41] sitting there saying how in the world
[1:41:42] does he have what I can't get after all
[1:41:44] my decades and Decades of
[1:41:47] study says and they took knowledge of
[1:41:50] them that they had been with Jesus
[1:41:53] Peter had denied Jesus now Peter
[1:41:56] identifies himself with Jesus church did
[1:41:58] you ever notice Peter hasn't done
[1:42:00] anything here he doesn't hasn't done
[1:42:02] before but now they finally take notice
[1:42:04] of him why it's a different Peter it's a
[1:42:08] different Peter now
[1:42:09] amen it says but when they had commanded
[1:42:12] them to go outside of the council they
[1:42:13] conferred among themselves saying what
[1:42:16] shall we do to these men for that indeed
[1:42:18] a notable Miracle have been done by them
[1:42:20] is Manifest to all them that dwell in
[1:42:21] Jerusalem and we can't deny it they said
[1:42:23] listen and everybody knows this is a
[1:42:24] miracle but that it spread no further
[1:42:27] upon the people let us straightly
[1:42:29] threaten them that they speak henceforth
[1:42:30] to no man in this name and they called
[1:42:33] them and commanded them not to speak at
[1:42:35] all nor teach in the name of Jesus so
[1:42:37] here's the challenge now Peter is backed
[1:42:40] down three times before this refused to
[1:42:42] be identified and now they say listen if
[1:42:45] you do this we're going to kill
[1:42:46] you what's Peter going to
[1:42:50] do but
[1:42:53] this is a wonderful butt because it's
[1:42:55] showing a difference between the past
[1:42:58] and the
[1:43:00] present it says but Peter and John
[1:43:04] answered and said unto them whether it
[1:43:06] be right in the sight of God to hearken
[1:43:07] to you more than to God judge ye he's
[1:43:10] putting them right in their place and
[1:43:12] he's saying listen we answer to a higher
[1:43:13] power than
[1:43:14] you he says for we
[1:43:18] cannot notice it's not will not we
[1:43:23] cannot it is
[1:43:27] impossible for those that have received
[1:43:30] the spirit to recant their
[1:43:33] faith we cannot but speak the things
[1:43:38] which we have seen and heard Jesus said
[1:43:42] ye are witnesses they'd seen it they'd
[1:43:44] heard it they'd experienced it they got
[1:43:47] it they weren't going to give it up
[1:43:48] because somebody said you can't do it
[1:43:50] anymore he says so when they have
[1:43:52] further threatened them they let them go
[1:43:54] finding nothing how they might punish
[1:43:56] them because of the people for all men
[1:43:58] glorify Peter for that which was
[1:44:01] done
[1:44:03] no no no no no for all men glorify God
[1:44:08] for that which was done what do you see
[1:44:10] these Trends today with all these
[1:44:11] prophets me me me me me where's the
[1:44:15] giving the glory to God people are LED
[1:44:18] down the path blind leading the
[1:44:20] blind but the the glory the honor and
[1:44:22] the praise went to the right person
[1:44:25] here it said and being let go they went
[1:44:28] to their own company and reported all
[1:44:30] that the chief priests and Elders had
[1:44:31] said unto them and when they heard that
[1:44:33] they lifted up their voice to God with
[1:44:35] one
[1:44:36] Accord see they didn't sit down and say
[1:44:38] Brothers what shall we
[1:44:40] do church when you realize you have
[1:44:43] access to the throne of Heaven you'll
[1:44:45] start using
[1:44:46] it we have a place to go for answers
[1:44:49] this morning I'm not saying God doesn't
[1:44:51] use brothers and sisters but as a group
[1:44:54] they came together they said here's
[1:44:56] where we're at and in one Accord they
[1:44:59] went to the throne of grace it said they
[1:45:01] lifted their voice to God with one
[1:45:03] Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which
[1:45:06] has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea
[1:45:07] and all that in them is he said and now
[1:45:10] Lord behold their
[1:45:12] threatenings and Grant unto thy
[1:45:15] servants that with all boldness they may
[1:45:18] speak Thy word what is their request
[1:45:20] church God save us God changed the
[1:45:24] circumstances God don't have them kill
[1:45:26] us no their prayer is God give us
[1:45:31] boldness to do what you've told us to
[1:45:33] do they're not pleading for themselves
[1:45:36] they're saying Lord don't let my courage
[1:45:38] fail don't let this body fail in doing
[1:45:41] what you told us to do before they were
[1:45:44] running away trying to preserve
[1:45:46] themselves now they're saying Lord
[1:45:48] preserve us to your purpose rather than
[1:45:52] to our comfort
[1:45:54] they had lost all fear of death they
[1:45:57] lost all fear of rejection they said
[1:45:59] just give us boldness to keep doing what
[1:46:00] we're
[1:46:01] doing by stretching forth thine hand to
[1:46:04] heal and that signs and wonders may be
[1:46:06] done by thy name of thy holy Child Jesus
[1:46:09] they're saying Lord ratchet it
[1:46:11] up let us do more for
[1:46:14] you if this causes problems let's keep
[1:46:17] causing the problems according to your
[1:46:19] kingdom will he says and when they had
[1:46:21] prayed the place was sh Shake him where
[1:46:23] they were assembled together that's what
[1:46:25] happened the first time church this is
[1:46:28] just a couple days
[1:46:30] later a couple days later and they're
[1:46:33] having the same experience they had on
[1:46:34] the day of Pentecost and they were all
[1:46:37] filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:46:39] spake the word of God with
[1:46:42] boldness they got exactly what they
[1:46:44] asked for because what they asked for
[1:46:46] was the will of God that's it they
[1:46:49] weren't asking for God to make life easy
[1:46:52] they were asking God to take him through
[1:46:54] let us keep doing what you've asked us
[1:46:56] to do and so we see Peter after this and
[1:46:58] Peter speaks with boldness remember they
[1:47:00] take him into the eventually they they
[1:47:02] they chain him up in the inner hold and
[1:47:04] he's got multiple doors to go through
[1:47:06] multiple sets of guards he himself is is
[1:47:08] Chained down and the angel of the Lord
[1:47:10] comes down blinds the guards opens the
[1:47:12] door sets him free from his chains and
[1:47:14] he walks out why God's got a purpose
[1:47:17] God's got a plan and circumstances
[1:47:20] change at his at just a touch of his can
[1:47:23] church and Peter's learned to trust but
[1:47:26] we see Peter as he starts to step into
[1:47:28] his ministry and remember what Jesus
[1:47:30] said he said Peter I'm going to give to
[1:47:31] you the Keys of the Kingdom what are the
[1:47:33] Keys of the Kingdom Church acts 238 it's
[1:47:37] the path of Salvation repent and be
[1:47:39] baptized for the REM repent uh and be
[1:47:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:47:44] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:47:46] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:47:47] that's the keys to the kingdom and we
[1:47:50] see Peter opens up that door to eternal
[1:47:52] life with the Jews on the day of
[1:47:53] Pentecost and then he goes down to the
[1:47:55] Gentiles and he opens it in the key the
[1:47:58] key to the kingdom to Cornelius and then
[1:48:00] he goes down to Samaria eventually and
[1:48:01] he opens that to the to the mixed
[1:48:03] Believers to the ones that are half Jew
[1:48:05] and half Gentile and so he's opened up
[1:48:06] the doors to the entire world at that
[1:48:08] point but before that nobody could go
[1:48:11] preach somewhere and somebody get the
[1:48:12] Holy Ghost unless Peter came first until
[1:48:14] he went to those three separate groups
[1:48:16] and after that anyone could preach the
[1:48:18] word and as long as it was the true word
[1:48:19] and accepted by faith people could get
[1:48:21] the Holy Ghost but nobody got the Holy
[1:48:23] Spirit until Peter went and unlocked
[1:48:25] that key that door with that
[1:48:27] key but I want to read a quote here and
[1:48:29] I've read this before when we are St
[1:48:32] talking about um um you know going God's
[1:48:35] way I forget um I forget the what I had
[1:48:37] as had as the title but I want to hammer
[1:48:40] this down as we're nearly done today
[1:48:42] remember Peter was praying on his roof
[1:48:43] and the Holy Spirit said hey there's
[1:48:45] some men coming go with them and so
[1:48:47] Peter did exactly that and and he's
[1:48:49] going with the Gentiles and we have to
[1:48:51] realize something that Peter has
[1:48:53] had a lifelong aversion to Gentiles they
[1:48:56] are his
[1:48:57] persecutors they they are the ones that
[1:48:59] put them in bondage remember it was
[1:49:02] ceremonially unclean for Peter to go
[1:49:04] into a gentile's house and so these
[1:49:06] Gentiles come to his door and the Holy
[1:49:09] Spirit says Peter go with them and Peter
[1:49:12] goes to them and he says to Cornelius he
[1:49:13] goes into the house doesn't want to go
[1:49:15] in the house he's unclean as soon as he
[1:49:17] steps in by all of his religious
[1:49:18] training and he says to Cornelius what
[1:49:20] am I supposed to do what do you brought
[1:49:22] me here for said well I had a vision it
[1:49:24] said go get you and that you would lead
[1:49:25] us to Salvation And so Peter preaches
[1:49:28] the word Peter does exactly what he's
[1:49:30] been doing with everyone else and he
[1:49:32] says and while he was yet speaking the
[1:49:34] Holy Ghost fell on those Gentiles then
[1:49:36] he said can a man forbid water that the
[1:49:38] should not be baptized he said see it's
[1:49:41] still the guide speaking not Peter it
[1:49:44] was the Holy Spirit the guide on the day
[1:49:46] of Pentecost and it's still the Holy
[1:49:48] Spirit speaking to these Gentiles it's
[1:49:49] not Peter he says because that was a
[1:49:52] bunch of gentiles they were unclean and
[1:49:53] dirty to him it says and he didn't even
[1:49:57] want to
[1:49:59] go we're talking about a true
[1:50:02] conversion a true conversion church is
[1:50:04] going to make us uncomfortable in this
[1:50:07] flesh against everything we've been
[1:50:09] raised up in everything we want to do
[1:50:12] everything we like to
[1:50:13] do we're going to go to people we don't
[1:50:15] like we're going to do things we don't
[1:50:17] really want to
[1:50:19] do he says but the guide said I'm
[1:50:21] sending year you he says you do things
[1:50:24] you don't think you would do when the
[1:50:26] guide gets complete control and when you
[1:50:28] let him guide you see sometimes we want
[1:50:31] to do
[1:50:32] something see it's not just that he
[1:50:34] makes us uncomfortable in doing things
[1:50:35] we don't want to do in this flesh but
[1:50:38] sometimes we want to do things and he
[1:50:40] says no and we've got to be
[1:50:42] uncomfortable and say okay even with our
[1:50:46] good intentions even with our good
[1:50:48] thoughts he says oh how wonderful it is
[1:50:50] to be led by the Holy Spirit he's the
[1:50:52] god guide he said he spoke through Peter
[1:50:54] and told him what he must do then when
[1:50:57] they all received the Holy Ghost he said
[1:50:58] we can't forbid water seeing that these
[1:51:00] have received the Holy Ghost like we did
[1:51:01] at the beginning and they baptized them
[1:51:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus he says
[1:51:06] now who led him to do
[1:51:09] that wasn't Peter's will wasn't Peter's
[1:51:12] desire wasn't Peter's Direction he said
[1:51:15] it was that gu that was in him he says
[1:51:18] didn't Jesus tell them take no thought
[1:51:20] what you're going to say because it's
[1:51:21] not you that speak
[1:51:23] it's the father that dwelleth in you he
[1:51:25] doeth the
[1:51:26] speaking I want to close on a high note
[1:51:29] this morning and I thank you for your
[1:51:31] patience but I want you to see how great
[1:51:33] this change was in Peter because church
[1:51:36] when God wants to use you he's going to
[1:51:38] use you and he's not going to just use
[1:51:40] you as a little wimpy thing he's going
[1:51:42] to give you a backbone he's going to let
[1:51:44] you stand on the two your two feet on
[1:51:46] the word of God and he'll do something
[1:51:48] through you and he'll let you do things
[1:51:51] and he'll have you do things you never
[1:51:52] thought you could do you may not even
[1:51:54] want to do but he'll do a wonderful work
[1:51:58] amen God's going to take us through the
[1:51:59] trials of this age and the trials of
[1:52:01] this life and he does it by setting us
[1:52:03] on Wings of Faith we're under an eagle
[1:52:05] anointing now that lifts us up above
[1:52:07] those things that carries us through
[1:52:09] those things and so just like Peter
[1:52:10] wasn't held back by religious Traditions
[1:52:12] or family traditions or cultural
[1:52:14] Traditions God's not going to let those
[1:52:16] things stop us either God's not here to
[1:52:18] let these little things these little
[1:52:20] isms these little ideas that we have
[1:52:22] hold us back he'll break him the holy
[1:52:25] spirit will break him cuz he's molding
[1:52:27] us into His Image but I want you to see
[1:52:29] Peter's final condition Peter the coward
[1:52:34] Peter the denier Peter the backslider
[1:52:38] Peter the
[1:52:40] failure Peter the satanic stumbling
[1:52:44] block okay do we have a good picture of
[1:52:47] what Peter started out as Church
[1:52:49] religious and all of those things
[1:52:54] okay acts 5 it says and by the hands of
[1:52:58] the Apostles remember they prayed at the
[1:52:59] ends of Acts four end of Acts 4 and they
[1:53:01] said Lord just magnify your work here's
[1:53:04] what
[1:53:04] happens and by the hands of the apostles
[1:53:07] were many signs and wonders wrought
[1:53:09] among the people and they were all with
[1:53:11] one Accord in Solomon's porch and the
[1:53:13] rest D no man join in and of the rest D
[1:53:16] no man joined himself to them but the
[1:53:18] people magnified them and Believers were
[1:53:20] the more added to the Lord multitudes
[1:53:23] both of men and women what a wonderful
[1:53:26] thing but I want you to catch this okay
[1:53:29] this is the end result of Peter the
[1:53:33] horrible Peter the failure listen to
[1:53:36] this in so much that they brought forth
[1:53:39] the sick into the streets and laid them
[1:53:41] on beds and couches that at the least
[1:53:45] the shadow of Peter passing by might
[1:53:48] overshadow some of them there came also
[1:53:51] a multitude out of the city cities round
[1:53:52] about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks
[1:53:56] and them that were vexed with unclean
[1:53:57] spirits and they were healed every
[1:54:03] one is God held back by our failures
[1:54:09] Church Peter is so full of the spirit of
[1:54:13] God that the sun shining on him and
[1:54:16] casting a shadow on a person will heal
[1:54:20] them that's what God think of our
[1:54:23] failures he can take an
[1:54:25] imperfect flawed and cracked vessel and
[1:54:29] turn it into a Powerhouse of the Holy
[1:54:33] Spirit one quote one scripture he says I
[1:54:36] can see that old
[1:54:38] fisherman Church we've got no excuses
[1:54:40] this morning for how little we are
[1:54:43] without a grammar school education
[1:54:45] couldn't even sign his own name an
[1:54:48] ignorant and unlearned man with so much
[1:54:51] God in him till the people passing
[1:54:55] through the streets wanted his shadow to
[1:54:57] pass over them everyone was healed he
[1:55:00] says why God in his people
[1:55:06] hallelujah God in his
[1:55:09] people where are Peter's failures in
[1:55:12] that where's Peter's Denial in that
[1:55:16] where's Peter's rejection in that
[1:55:17] where's Peter's backsliding Church
[1:55:20] purged it's in the see of God's
[1:55:23] forgetfulness never more to be
[1:55:27] remembered amen look at
[1:55:30] this Paul said to Timothy if we believe
[1:55:33] not yet he abideth faithful he cannot
[1:55:38] deny himself amen God bless you let's
[1:55:42] stand this
[1:55:44] morning why did Peter make it through
[1:55:47] church remember what Jesus said Rejoice
[1:55:49] not because the demons and devils are
[1:55:52] subject to you but Rejoice because your
[1:55:54] names are in the book of Heaven Peter's
[1:55:56] name was written down in the book of
[1:55:58] Heaven Before Time Ever
[1:56:00] began and so when Peter failed God
[1:56:03] wasn't looking at Peter God was looking
[1:56:04] at that name and that name was a part of
[1:56:07] his word and Peter was ordained from
[1:56:10] that moment to eternal life and so when
[1:56:13] Peter denies God what's God looking at
[1:56:16] Peter no he's looking at the word he
[1:56:18] says I've still got to get him to
[1:56:19] eternal
[1:56:20] life when Peter turns down when Peter
[1:56:23] backslide when Peter seems to have
[1:56:24] failed in every way God's not looking at
[1:56:26] Peter God's looking at the word and he
[1:56:28] says even though he denies me I can't
[1:56:30] deny him because I've tied him to me
[1:56:32] through my word his name's in the Lamb's
[1:56:34] Book of Life Peter's ignorant and
[1:56:37] unlearned church and he writes two books
[1:56:39] of the New
[1:56:41] Testament he's so full of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:43] that his shadow passing over a person
[1:56:46] can heal
[1:56:48] them you talk about a difference you
[1:56:51] talk about a contrast this is a man that
[1:56:53] used to hide in the shadows and now he's
[1:56:56] standing out there for all to see and
[1:56:57] declaring a living Christ amen that's
[1:57:01] what a true conversion is to declare
[1:57:03] Jesus Christ is alive and well today not
[1:57:06] dead Creeds not I'm a member of a
[1:57:09] church I'm a member of him I'm a part of
[1:57:13] his body I'm a part of his
[1:57:15] bride and I'm an example of what he does
[1:57:18] when he takes a vessel and he fills it
[1:57:21] with himself amen
[1:57:23] I think it's so beautiful that we can
[1:57:24] look at a man like that so completely
[1:57:27] flawed so completely diluted in his own
[1:57:30] capabilities and God could turn him into
[1:57:32] one of the greatest men of the
[1:57:33] scriptures
[1:57:35] amen what can he do with you this
[1:57:39] morning I'm just a little this or
[1:57:42] that doesn't
[1:57:44] matter he's attached himself to you and
[1:57:48] he's got a work for you to do he's got a
[1:57:50] promise attached to your name this
[1:57:52] morning and he's going to do it and all
[1:57:56] he's doing is saying will you just
[1:57:57] believe me just take that next step just
[1:58:01] do that next thing I'm telling you to do
[1:58:04] say what I've told you to say be where
[1:58:06] I've told you to be sit still like I've
[1:58:09] told you to sit still and just rest and
[1:58:12] trust that my word will produce what it
[1:58:14] says in your life amen God bless you
[1:58:17] this morning let's bow our
[1:58:19] heads Lord

[1:58:32] working of your word by your spirit can
[1:58:35] take these flawed and hopeless and
[1:58:37] worthless vessels Lord and turn them
