we're going by faith not feelings well that's most definitely brother there are others that are not they don't have that faith so they're just they're just religious and they're just just a little bit here a little bit there and just moving away but then if you if you really got that faith amen in your heart praise the lord you're going to give him preeminence oh yeah you're going to live for him amen you're going to live for the word live for the promise hallelujah where they started that's where we're going to finish there's an alpha and there's an omega praise the name of the lord let's believe that the anointing that was with our brother abel oh four thousand years ago or six thousand years ago is with us praise the lord the anointing that was with the saints 2 000 years ago on the day of pentecost is with us praise the lord what what brought them on move them on after the death burial resurrection of jesus amen is going to take us on amen listen it's got to be the same faith that they had that we got to have amen but we're maturing in that faith by the grace of god oh brother sister not religion or just because i go to this church because we believe this we believe this no no although we we come we go to this church why with jesus amen it's with jesus giving jesus to preeminence is giving god the preeminence amen we're not living for ourselves we're not living for religion we're living for jesus amen we're witnesses not for just for religion and it's the truth we're not just going out there to be a witness from william branham he wouldn't he wouldn't want that no no he wants us to be a witness for jesus amen all that god has done all that god is doing is to bring us into a greater and greater and greater relationship with jesus amen and to make jesus more real to us praise the lord and to bring us into a greater reality of a greater experience and relationship with jesus oh brother i trust by grace that we have the relationship they had on the day of pentecost amen praise the lord that the anointing that came down amen to anoint him to go forth that rather that anointing has come down to anoint us to go to go on in the glory to go back to eternity by the grace of god we come from eternity we're going back to eternity and brother i'll tell you this if if the if the holy ghost has got any token or rather there's any evidence or why why the holy ghost amen praise the name of the lord what what what proof what does it do for me what is it what proof is it giving amen it is proof of where i come from amen i got the holy ghost amen i mean i come from the same place the holy ghost is and that is eternity praise said oh praise god for the word praise god for the message that has give us the revelation of who we are amen and give us the revelation of our relationship with jesus oh brother that grace is not just religion and i heard the gospel preached and i and i come and i want to accept jesus as my savior thank you lord for what

gospel see saint john's gospel chapter 15 amen praise the lord and let's begin to read at verse 1. saint john's gospel 15 and verse 1. i am the true vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit is taketh away amen every branch that beareth not fruit is taken away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit praise the lord grace but it says now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you amen as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except that abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me oh brother we've got to enter in and stay with that oneness he said i am the vine ye are the branches and he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing amen without him we can do nothing to please god amen so if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned god help us if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you arien is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit amen and it is the fruit of the revealed word amen aaron is he glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father has loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love amen grace lord is not brothers not just coming in at the beginning and then oh that love gets cold and it just fades away no no brother it's going to it's going to move on and mature and get more richer and richer and richer amen because the more we get into him the closer we get to him amen the more in the oneness we get with the lord amen the greater and the greater we love the love that we have for one another oh yeah oh well you love god yes but you love god you love him you love one another amen oh yes most definitely as the father has loved me so have i loved you amen continue ye in my love praise the lord god help us to show the love of god to one another and if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love all god's grace to us amen these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you but lord brought grace brothers sisters to have divine love amen not filial but a copy for a greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends god help us ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you god bless this word you may be seated brother love one another he said as i have loved you that's tremendous we thank god for the love where with he loved us but now through their experience we've had with him he's looking for us to have that same love for one another amen he's looking for us what to lay down our lives so brother sister it's not me living is jesus living in me it's not me doing this and doing that it's true oh my lord help us amen that is jesus doing it amen it's jesus loving loving one another through you amen loving this brother loving this sister helping this one helping that one and again oh brother sister you're not doing it as as humans would do it for one another we're doing it as god would do it for us amen oh brother i pray grace that we have laid down our lives to that extent and that jesus has got control of our lives to that extent so that the life we live amen and the attitudes and and all that we have and all we're manifesting by the grace of god that it it's not our nature it's his nature amen it's not my life it's his life praise oh this is tremendous brother if i if i'm going to love you with his love this is going to be tremendous hallelujah because rather the devil is not going to be able to challenge that love and and to weaken that love not by any means no brother sister because if we got the love of god amen and we've got the love of god for one another brother i'll tell you this it's going to get greater and greater and greater it's going to get stronger and stronger and stronger amen and brother that love do we have that love for one another to the extent that jesus had it for us amen in that in the bible according to the love of god the bible says that he laid down his life for us amen it was divine love in action amen that's what caused him to do what he did for us amen that's what causes him to do what he's doing for us amen it is divine love it is the love of god amen brother that brought him down to redeem us it is the love of god with us and in us amen with one another to take us back praise god oh brother i pray amen if there's ever anything that we need it is divine love brother is not not oh well i i like this brother like this sister i appreciate this brother and sister brother let's don't don't talk it knock it amen don't talk and walk it don't talk don't tell it to show it amen you can express love and not have love and that is the truth oh yeah there's down through the years now through the ages brother there's been many rise up and and and go forth confessing you know thinking that they have the love of god and they love this one they love that one but they don't because brother sister if it's the true love of god if the same love that that god showed us in jesus we're going to have the same attitude that jesus had we're going to have the same nature that jesus said amen and jesus nature was what his willingness to lay down his life for us amen and brother we got that love we got that willingness to lean in our lives to one another amen we got that willingness to make sacrifices for one another we got that within us brother sister to help this brother to help this sister amen amen by the grace of almighty god oh god i pray god help us lord to have that revelation that conviction of the love of god the conviction of what it means to be filled with the love of god to have the experience of the love of god you have the anointing of the love of god brother if you've got it it's not just well i love the lord i love my brother if you love the lord god god is going to want you to show it to your brothers and sisters amen if you really love him you will show it to your brothers and sisters amen and you're going to show it not only to your believers you're going to show it to others out there that you have met amen oh they're going to know that you got love amen oh brother sister i've heard that i've heard that witness down through the years the brother that that so-called unbelievers are there uh they they have looked at believers and they said oh my if there's any anything about those they're different you know and and they they got love and so on oh yeah brother i i've heard that testimony about this brother or this sister this this church or that church amen brother what what should they recognize they recognize love oh yeah brother it's not just this doctrine or that doctrine no brother it is uh it is the spirit that we have that motivates us that it controls us amen concerning oh yeah i want to i want to tell them this teach them this teach them that brother brother you've got to be motivated by love amen as jesus and god was motivated by love to do what he did to redeem us back brother so we're going to be motivated by the same thing why amen because as he redeemed us and he and he loved us amen hallelujah he's taking us back we want that one to go back we want that we don't know who they are amen so hallelujah but so we're going to surrender to the lord so god can use us to be a witness to this and a witness to that one because we don't know who's who is the seed of god or and the sons and daughters of god amen but god knows amen and you know and i'm part of the bride of christ if you're a part of the bride you're going to love the bright you love the members of the bride most definitely oh my brother oh i love the lord and oh yeah and i go to church every service and i and i do this and i do that and i read my bible and i pray yeah but what are you doing for the body are you showing that love to the body are you expressing that love in the body do they does the other members of the body no well that brother that's your old mind oh they're wonderful that brother is wonderful that sister is one of them they got a wonderful spirit oh yes they're right there to help you they're they're right there to encourage you they're right there for you amen by the grace of god amen so brother again it's not just religion say you know why this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine brother the devil believes all that and he knows what is the truth brother sometimes he got he got greater revelation than some believers oh yeah he knows this and he knows that sure he does amen because he's able to come and he's able to give you the word well what he'll do is he'll change a word here change the word there he'll just leave this impression leave that impression but brother i tell you this he's using the word amen brother went in when he came as as as we have highlighted that when he when he came then to deceive man in the garden of eden there amen how did he deceive her did he deceive her with by by bringing in his own his own idea of the gospel it's it's his own doctrine no he took what god gave them and he added to it oh yeah yeah and he can't do it in just one word just one word amen brother that's what he'll do to us sometimes with the with with the message of the hour he'll add a word or take away a word he'll add a thought or take away a thought amen because he said to eve yea as god said oh yeah he knew what god said and he already knows what god has said in this hour he knows what god has revealed in this hour he knows what god requires of us in this hour amen and he's there brother to what for to hinder us he's there to change oh yeah yeah god said but we don't want no butts as our brother again refer to our brother dear brother fulcher the butts belonged to the goats amen not to the sheep amen so brother sister don't don't don't take the devil's butts as he said to eve in the in the garden yeah god said but oh he but he give he quote the word but he added to it but i say unto you amen oh and he give the word he said oh yeah that's the truth god's right there you know but i say unto you he gave he gave his interpretation before to deceive eve amen and brother all down through the ages when god has revealed his word all down's true the enemy has been there brother he's come in he's come in and he's come in amen and yeah he said yeah as god said yes god said amen but and he'll add add this to it add to it tell that to it amen oh yeah if you if you read the the church ages there in the book of revelation and brother in this church age he did this in this church age he did that amen and i believe i highlighted it some years ago that there was one church age that he didn't do anything he couldn't and and they they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to him for that amen but he would say yea as god said but yea as god said but amen in all the church ages yeah you just go go into the book of revelation there chapter two chapter three and the different church ages and you'll see what what the enemy did in each age oh yeah and in another age there he he did certain thing and that's and that was basically that was around the third age right here and that's that's when he started to bring in organized religion denomination and so on oh yeah he tried to to change their doctrines and and a little here little there in the previous ages but he got a little further there amen and he was taking everything out from under the control of god and put it under the control of man yeah that was denominationalism amen they're coming under man's authority not god's authority amen oh yes maybe we and maybe we should go to go through that again sometime and show you what god did in the first stage what god did in the second age and the third lay on down and show you where the enemy came in brother as he came into adam and eve in the garden of eden there amen so he is coming to the to the church amen father down through the church ages and and he injected this and he injected that amen so and god there was there was an age there that god never never asked them to repent because they never listened to the devil amen but in all the other ages god said repent amen repent amen radar down truth to the church the last church age amen he said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten they zealous therefore and repent amen god called for repentance to this age this age there was two or three ages he didn't amen he didn't call for repentance because because they didn't they didn't go off like all the other ages did into a false teaching the way the way that they did and he said remember therefore from whence the first age is to remember from whence thou art fallen and repent amen and show your repentance show your faith oh brother just don't talk it walk it your faith oh exactly amen brother the prophet of god preached on wisdom versus faith you can have the wisdom of the word amen because the enemy is there the devil he got the wisdom of the word he knows the word you know what the bible says he knows what god said amen but he'll say but yeah i say unto thee but amen he'll get you to add he'll get you to to take away amen oh and he'll get you to put the answers on this but not on that oh yeah what is he doing he's using the word brother all down through he's used the word right from the beginning to the end satan is there to use the word god help us brother bro and he and there's the true prophet and then there's the false prophet amen and the false prophet he's going to teach the word but he's going to add to it or take from it don't add to the word don't let the devil add to it in your life don't let the devil take away from it in your life leave it the way god put it amen and let god control your life by the word amen it's not you controlling the word god control the word controlling you amen but there's too many right brother it's too many it's controlling the word oh yeah all done true as did the enemy come in in all the ages there and and did this did this what for to get man into control not god trust man not god amen yes god said but i say unto you amen and he anointed them oh yeah he anointed them to do this you anointed to preach this teach this amen and that's why it all down through the ages that's why we see what happened when it comes to denominations organized religion and he said there in in that first church age he said nevertheless he said i have somewhat against me he acknowledged the good that they did he acknowledged oh yeah this is good that's good i appreciate this appreciate that but he said but i said nevertheless i have somewhat against thee or you did this you did that wonderful that's good but there's something you shouldn't have done amen he said because thou has left thy first love or they're still religious they're still professing to be the church oh yeah they're still believing that jesus was their savior but he wasn't in control they were not expressing his love so he said remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent amen repent and brother and there's several churches there ages rather that that had to repent repent repent amen but there was one church age that didn't have to repent two maybe two yeah maybe two two that didn't have to repent i've gotten into that before so he said remember therefore from whence thou have fallen and repent and do the first works brother there's a generation of believers that are there to condemn denominationals oh you need to repent because your denomination you're this you're that well there's believers that need to repent amen brother because they've come they come out of that they come into the word the message of the hour and that they acknowledge this they acknowledge that amen but brother as as man did it back here under satan's influence change this added to this took away from that that's what many about so-called believer many even a preacher amended this adding to the message taken away from the message amen putting the emphasis on that and and and and taking away taking away the emphasis on something else god help us our faith is being challenged to believe the word our traitor has been challenged to believe the message of the hour amen because brother what god has done what god has ordained in this age when it comes to the revelation of the word amen the restoration of the word brother it is ordained to give us the faith that we need amen but if we're going to let the devil add judah take away from it brother it won't give us the faith we need amen brother oh brother don't you add to it don't let the enemy add to it don't let this one add to it or did a preacher or or you're this brother or that sister no no or we believe this we believe that let's believe the word amen and to believe it the way that god has preached it god has ordained it amen and let's make sure that he's giving us the faith that god has ordained for it to give us amen brother as god came came down through the ages and brother and and what god did and the revelation of the word that god give that give that generation is there is the it would give them the faith they needed for the age they lived in as the lutherans oh yeah god give them the faith of justification amen sanctification the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but brother concerning what god has done and what god has given us now what what faith is that ordained to give us brother justification thank god for that for that thank god for all that he did amen and we believe it and we've experienced it amen but what about what god is doing now oh brother god what god god did that's good the lutherans they just went on to another dimension the the methodists and so on and the pentecostals and all the others amen they got used they just jesus died and physically and they just went from time to eternity by the grace of god amen but why because they they went forth in the faith that god had that the word the message of that hour the message of that age had given them the message gave them this faith that faith and so on and they went on to be with the lord but brother what faith is god's the message of the hour ordering to give us not to make it not to make more churches oh no it's not to go there oh i want you to go there and be a witness with this and witness with that amen amen brother is ordained to give us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen brother what do you what do you give to the others no oh yeah it'll give them the faith to do to come forth in the resurrection amen but the oh they're going to appear to the living saints for the rapture hallelujah amen that's what the power of god said they are waiting on us they're waiting on that generation to come forth they got faith for the rapture amen there's oh yeah praise god for a faith for the resurrection too to bring them forth amen in resurrection power and glory but brother besides the resurrection we need the we need the revelation and the faith of the rapture oh it's one thing to come forth now we're getting caught up to sit with him in his throne hallelujah amen so brother sister is more than just the only thing i i'm just good i'm a good believer because i believe the message uh do you really believe the message are you is is the holy ghost in you bringing forth bringing forth the faith that the message is ordained to give us oh the faith well i believe god's been a prophet and i believe that the mysteries are revealed i believe the shields are open but that's good but why did he do it amen is he accomplishing in us what he what he's doing what he wants to do praise the lord he justified the the the lutherans he's he sanctified the methodists amen the pentecostals he filled with the holy ghost and then and then the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but then there rises a generation did he get oh praise the lord that he gives the revelation of the mystery of god he gives the revelation of the of of the seven seals amen the revelation of the ages amen what's the ordained to do it's ordained to give that generation faith for the resurrection and the rapture oh praise the lord the lures went forth justified the methodist went forth sanctified amen brother they had an experience they had an experience brother even and praise the lord i know that i that our brother john wesley brother when god was moving on john wesley with the with the revelation of sanctification brother where did he get that revelation amen brother he was into a cottage meeting he was yes amen and it was believers that were ministering concerning with concerning martin luther that cottage meeting yes the the believers of what god had did in luther amen they believed in justification god did this god did that amen it's in jesus amen that we don't have to do this to be justified that to be justified we got to accept it in christ because jesus justified us amen and wesley was in in that cottage meeting and he and he was worshiping and praising the lord and and the brother was this brother was preaching concerning what god had god had revealed through martin luther amen and john wesley was worshipping and all of a sudden the anointing struck him and the anointing he says he felt it brother he sensed the anointing that come from the crown of his head he said it went right down to the soles of his feet what yeah he was in a cottage meeting and only that it was a martin luther message amen and he and this brother was preaching concerning what god god has justified us amen through our lord jesus christ and and it struck luther it struck wesley oh thank you lord you've shake to fight me and he went forth with the revelation of sanctification amen amen brother it's not that i had to do this and i had to do that jesus already did it he said oh praise the lord i am sanctified brother i i'm justified but he got the revelation now he said i'm sanctified amen and and the lord began to open to him the scriptures concerning what jesus did and what jesus was doing amen and he went forth to preach sanctification by faith praise the name of the lord hallelujah and brother unto it again we know the gifts concerning the pentecostal h amen and we know that that straight away back down there and it was it was the colored brother that god was using amen and he got up there and he preached oh yeah and he when he was preaching that night that god said the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost amen and what did he do he had he had he had a cardboard box and he put it on his head amen and he just oh yeah he was believing god and he wanted the anointing amen and as as he had the cardboard box over him he wanted god to send the holy ghost amen and the anointing of the holy ghost into his life amen and brother when he was there ministering and he was there preaching amen that all of a sudden the holy ghost fell amen and and god began to anoint the all the sons and daughters praise the lord and they began to worship god baptized with the holy ghost amen that was the pentecostal message praise the lord and they went on and went around the world oh yeah they went around the world they were shocked concerning that pentecostal revival now brother what about the bride revival amen oh lord help us to have faith brother as as we have said to the the methodist they are the the lutherans rather they went forth which with the revelation of of justification the other sanctification and the pentecostals the gifts of the spirit amen the baptism of the holy ghost amen brother oh yeah they believe justification they believe sanctification but god moved in a greater anointing of the holy ghost amen they give them that revelation that they needed in the pentecostal revival praise the lord but brother now god is taking us on beyond the pentecostal revival i pray grace that we're going to let go and let god have his way amen let go brother and let god bring into us the faith that he wants us to have now what's god requiring of us now brother i'll keep repeating he wants he's requiring the resurrection and the rapture amen yup why because he's done all the rest now the only thing left is the resurrection rapture amen and then the gospel goes back to the jews grace of god to us please that we're not going to get caught up with the foolishness of this world and i can cut out with natural things of this world or even natural family and all that we just leave it with leave the natural family with the lord amen let's get caught up with the spiritual amen let's move on to god we'll move on with the lord let's get out of time and into eternity god help us brother sister but i know the enemy is there he's the brother he was he was the in the lutherans he was with the methodists amen to try to do what try to discourage them and and you know just to don't get too involved with this revelation don't get too involved with that yeah god is justified but god is sanctified but god gives us the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit but and they wanted to add to it and do this and do that amen man getting involved amen under under the under the under the anointing of the devil yeah it was satan as he came into the garden of eden to deceive eve so whether he's come down satan was in every church age amen or you say he wasn't going to deny what god had done he wasn't going to deny the the the message and the revelation that god had given them but he was going to add to it or take from it that's what he done and he ended up with all these denominations and brother now the same thing going on around don't don't think oh the message of the hour and and god did this and god did that we we don't have to worry about this don't ever he delivered us from denominations he brought us out of those denominations but i tell you brother when we come out of that the devil off to come out he already had him trapped but he was after us oh yeah and brother as i've said over the years i've had to deal with all those spirits even denominational spirits oh my yes as i've said that years and years and years ago and it oh it was a long time ago that that i i was into into a meeting in in in a believing church and and oh yeah and we're having a altar call there and a lot of the believers are coming up and around the altar and praising the lord and and praying and so on and then in fact it was i just i moved to my left ear and because there was a two believers came up they were adults and then as and they were they were there they're worshiping praising the lord and so on and i said lord i said they don't have your spirit i said that's another spirit on them you had you felt that i that the discernment the lord gave me and i felt it i didn't say anything to anybody i just left it and i just said lord i'll leave it with you and i move on and just a couple of years later they were they left the message and they were gone back into the world what yeah they read those they were adults i would say maybe when it comes to their age they might have been in their 30s you know brother god brought us out but brother we've got to go from time to eternity to get away from the devil amen and his influence amen and brother again that's not the only thing that i've that i've witnessed over the years father brother among the enemy's influence among the message and individuals in churches oh yeah god have mercy on us stay sincere stay with the word amen by the grace of god press on with the faith that god has given us what faith has god given you brother i tell you if you really got the faith that god has ordained for us to have through the revealed word of this hour if you really got that faith i'll tell you morning noon and night you're looking for the rapture you're looking for the resurrection you're looking to get out of time and into eternity amen because brother we're at the end of the ages now we're going from time to eternity praise the lord hallelujah but i tell you most believers are just into doctrine into this theology into that theology yeah but how many are really into the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture how many that we just can't get away from it brother morning noon and night luther just he couldn't get away from it justification oh i'm justified what jesus justified me praise the lord hallelujah oh the revelation struck him from the inside out sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen brother now the bride we've gone beyond it so i was just striking you the revelation oh glory of the resurrection are we just still looking for the grave yeah are we still looking for the grave oh well i'm gonna die well if the lord tarries death will strike you strike me but brother i tell you this god has ordained to give us the faith for the rapture to faith for the resurrection that's why he did what he did through william branham and the opening of the word amen it is to give us that faith brother you go i pray grace that you you'll go and and and listen to or read the message that the prophet of god ministered concerning the rapture and it was it was it was just shortly before the lord called him called the prophet off the scene he ministered on the rapture and rapturing faith so brother grace of god if this is what if we're part of what god's doing brother i tell you morning noon and night we got that revelation lord we're we're still moving on for the rapture we're still moving on lord for the resurrection we're looking up lord amen we pray for that anointing lord to come amen and again that's the oh as i said will you will you be in this weird enough to recognize the dead in christ when they appear to you the power of god so the dead in christ is going to appear to the living saints that are ordained for the rapture and i will you recognize if if somebody came back if sister coffee came back or sister dunford we pray that they're part of the bride of christ amen and the others that have gone on and when they come back and they're but remember this journey gonna be young sister coffee won't be like we when we saw her she's gonna be a young woman will you recognize her she'll recognize you and the part the prophet of gospel the dead in christ will appear to the living saints and then we're going to be changed and cut with them into that dimension and he said we'll have fellowship somewhere the prophet mentioned it he says somewhere we'll have fellowship for a certain period yeah and then he said we're going to look up oh there's jesus yeah he said why because praise the lord he said he's jesus by the spirit the anointing he said he's going to he's going to go he's sitting into the into the into glory and he said he's going to go is it to the body he said that he used to redeem us and he said that anointing and that spirit he said of moved to that body and get into that body he said why where is it oh he said that body is just up there he said somewhere and he said it's next to the throne yeah and he said but there's no life in it he said the life came back on the day of pentecost oh glory praise the lord amen praise the lord and on the on the hour of the resurrection rapture he said that life goes back to that body called jesus hallelujah we're going to be changed god god gathered into that dimension and with the other saints amen and then we look up and he said there's there's jesus in the body and we're gonna be caught up with him to sit with him in israel how many really believe it or is jesus still for for many he's just an historical figure or is jesus real as i did when i was at a cottage meeting in gambo and brother of sister barnes's it was dark the hour time when i was going to the cottage me and and i drove my vehicle there and i got out of the vehicle and i looked oh up there in the sky oh my i said look what's that i said and i looked up and i and i saw all my like angels and i like it like like the lord in the great light there i said oh my lord i said grace yeah and i just i just got out of my vehicle and i turned around and looked it was right there in the sky it was getting dark of course but that was that was light it was bright and then and after just after just a couple of minutes i was looking and looking and looking and then it faded it wasn't my imagination no no it was something that god did for a reason i was just a young man it wasn't in my thoughts no no i was just looking forward to going into the cottage meeting with brother sister burns and because we used to go in at that time and uh i wasn't ministering we were in and we just put out play a tape and i went in and i just explained to them what i saw oh my they thought they knew they felt it was the lord i said yeah i believe it's a god i said showing me something god help us i've had a number of those experiences done through the years for one of the days where there's it's not going to be just a vision no no we're going to go right on to you amen there won't be a vision no who are you oh come on in phone brother come on sister yeah oh god help us that's how real it's going to be amen god give us the faith that really really that's that's taking the taking the reality this whole world away from us and giving that the reality of heaven the reality of the new heaven and new earth it will get more and more real brother god help us just think i don't have the time to go and go into these thoughts on on faith concerning faith and i was just thinking about it and i said oh my by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice faith yeah what did he do oh where did he get that well somewhere what what what where did where did abel get the attitude that he had and where did cain get the attitude that he had abel must have been thinking different he must have been under a different conviction it had to be a conviction to do what he did to offer the sacrifice he offered and it was the more excellent sacrifice as i said consider you know what cain offered but no let's see what abel offered where did he get that what was he thinking about what was his conviction but it was by faith so let it be a conviction in his heart in his soul amen that no doubt he mine where'd he get the revelation of the garden of eden where'd he get the revelation of what happened to adam and eve in the garden and brother what happened to adam and eve well the lord that must have took him and and and abel was out there and he was going around maybe outside the garden and no doubt he had because he was the seed of god amen because he was a son of god he had that conviction no doubt in his heart and in his soul oh yeah and but now cain was different king just went went and did this and he planted this and planted that oh this is wonderful this is wonderful yeah thank you lord yeah but but abel was different he must he had lambs and lambs and sheep and whatever so he just if the burden was there that he would that he would take one of the lambs and slay them now where did he where did he get that conviction cain never read it cain condemned abel for doing it cain felt that abel shouldn't have done what he did in killing that lamb cain felt that he was he did the best you know he didn't kill anything he just took he took what he had grown and and just laid that on the altar he gave this to the lord that to the lord but abel's faith was different abel's revelation was different luther's revelation was different wesley's pentecostal others down through the ages that god did god used oh yeah so different that it brought total separation from the rest of the world and brother what god has done for us is bringing a greater and greater separation god help us amen not to compromise stay with the word and brother oh they consider us fanatics because we left denominations to believe the word yeah to believe the message and we get together and we believe this doctrine this doctrine you know but now brother sister there ought to be a greater and greater separation because what for for the resurrection and the rapture god separated them all down through the ages and what for to bring forth the message for luther to bring forth the message in wesley the pentecostals and yes even the salvation army as i said that the prophet of god said that god raised up william booth where he had read out salvation because the why he said because pentecost it organized so quickly after the pentecostal revival he said he had to raise up william booth red-hot salvation god help us and where are we now where are we now after the what it's been what 60 years since the prophet of god has been gone i'm close to it where's our faith what faith do we have what are we living for what's controlling us now in our thoughts and our words indeed what's what's governing us are motivating us when it comes to church going to church and doing this and doing that what's our testimony what's our witness oh lutheran then they went and testified of justification other sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost they give to the spirit but even even has gone from them now they certainly lost lost the influence of it gone but brother what about the bride of christ concerning what god has done in the last days concerning the amen the ministry of a prophet concerning the opening of the word god help us brother he said as again as the first church age remember from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works amen and concerning the last stage oh my what an hour what the the in the first days they did this the second the next one the next one they did that they did that but but the last church age the one you and i are in oh my they they were they were more mixed up than the rest oh yeah they're more confusing than the rest of the ages more deceiving than the rest he said you're you're you're you're you think you're spiritual and he said oh i'm rich and increased with goods and i have need of nothing amen what knoweth not he said that thou art richard you're miserable you're poor you're blind and you're naked what what would you feel if if that's a diagnosis that somebody gave you oh i got this problem oh no this is your problem what no that's not my yes you're wretched you're poor you're blind you're naked and you don't know that you're doomed you think you're good you think you're this you think you're that he said you don't know you're wretched miserable poor blind god help us god help us brother again god said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten if god loves you he's going to rebuke you if you need it if you need correction he's going to correct you amen if you need chastisement he's going to chasten you he said he said because he said be zealous and repent that's your response to what god does amen that's the response that god is looking for in the last stage and brothers response god's looking for in the bride brothers as a result of the of what he's done through the message of the hour through the messenger of the hour amen brother is to humble us to repentance i tell you if when it comes to going in the resurrection rapture oh praise the lord we're going home yeah but i tell you he's going to put you down and then you'll go up he'll put you down through your repentance and your faith is going to take you up by the grace of god praise the lord praise the lord god help us to have a right spirit and a right attitude toward the word amen i write spirit and right attitude toward what god has done and is doing and there's a reason to get us to look up he puts us down praise the lord and he said oh god elvis oh brother that's the lava to see an age don't worry about that well but it's a spirit that goes right on through religion and there's many have come out but they've still got that spirit that they came out of from denominations even message believers yeah even messy believers brother branham was dealing with that from his own pulpit i can i just go so far with that concerning certain things that providers said certain things that he has preached from his own pulpit and why in the world would so-called believers leave brother branham's church and go to another brother's church oh yeah many believers did professing believers because the probably god preached this he preached that for the most part he was always traveling but there's a few times eventually that he had to stay he had to make sure that he went into his own church and he would minister this and minister that he would you would correct them with the word and they couldn't take correction that's why many of them left the church still professing to be believers but they moved out moved on what this was the prophet you believed them to be a prophet they believed him to be a prophet and wouldn't stay under his ministry they went into another brothers ministry that's the other brother that they went to he believed brother brown was a prophet and he preached it that way god help us this is how sincere it is and this is how confusing the age that we're living in is don't be diseased be not deceived don't let the devil deceive you into thinking well you're a believer you believe this you believe that don't worry about it let's make your calling and your election sure amen settle all the questions amen again let me read it concerning this age and we're dealing with those we're not in denomination but we're still dealing with those spirits yep and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot are you cold are you hot or lukewarm if you're not cold you're not hot you're lukewarm he said i would that thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold or hot i will spew thee out of my mouth let's get into a relationship with jesus that's hot amen not lukewarm amen not cold but hot and he said because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and wait raymond that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and a night thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see amen god help us as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent for behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sub with him and e with me amen he's knocking through the preaching of the word through the ministry of the word he's knocking open the door let him in amen let him in amen and be there to read it ready to receive what he's what he's trying to teach you about yourself amen see apply the word to yourself in the ministry of the word apply it to your own life don't think oh praise the lord that's wonderful brother keep preaching amen but it's all intellectual knowledge it's like doctrine and so on no no it's got to be a personal relationship between you and god god is ministering to you as an individual god is working on you god is god is what for working on your faith what for he wants to take out the unbelief and bring more and more faith and give you more and more faith so that we become not religious but we become spiritual but as too many believers are religious but not spiritual are you religious or are you spiritual god help us so he said i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and e with me oh do we have that real fellowship with jesus he supps with me i with him day in day out morning noon and night you know no matter what you're doing where you're going you're you fellas you don't forget jesus he's always there he'll matter like i said i've walked through malls i've been driving in vehicles doing this doing that going here going there and but i i can't forget jesus i'm thinking about him oh lord oh praise the lord this thought will come and i'll say praise the lord or i see this always the lord amen thank you lord that's good there oh lord bless this one lord bless that one lord hell help this brother help this sister lord in the name of jesus well yeah if you're in the spirit you're going through the day you can't get you can't get away from that the holy ghost is there to eat to use you well he's there to use you what for to enter to intervene or intercede for for this brother this sister for this ministry that ministry for the body of christ for the bride of christ around the world by praying for the bride of christ every day lord grace to those across the island here i said under this ministry those across the island those around the world i said wherever they are i pray grace to every sincere heart and we are praying for the believers in ukraine and there are believers there well there are believers there they they do and they do have a church there our churches are there believers churches yeah so i pray the grace of god to them not knowing if there were believers there when all this started and i was just saying lord i said you know so i saw i got to commit that to you and and pray your grace to every sincere heart i said in ukraine that's what i was praying for but in uh approaching brother barry coffey's internet site and he had some articles there concerning it and concerning the believers in the ukraine and he's been of course he's been there even recently to poland and maybe the ukraine to visit believers there to encourage believers keep them in prayer because i tell you the hour's coming when it's going to get worse and worse and worse around the world look up our redemption is drawing near the rapture by the grace of god the bible warns us when you see this see this see this this going on that's going on don't look down look out don't get discouraged encourage with the word the promise of the resurrection the promise of the rapture is getting closer it's right there god help us amen to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as also i also overcame and am set down with my father in israel he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches led i pray god that you'll hear what the spirit is saying to the bride of christ amen get ready look up because the our redemption has come by the grace of god it's one thing to have wisdom another thing to have faith you can have the wisdom of even to know the the knowledge of the bible to know the knowledge of the message and all that but what about the faith that it's ordained to give us there's a lot of people know the message oh they know this message they know that message they know the bible and someone comes in but they don't have the faith that that it that it's ordained to give why because they got it in their head but not in their heart the bible says thy word have i hid in mine heart not your head your heart he says lord that i might not sin against you disbelieve you lord or doubt you put it in the heart so the word is in control by the grace of god and that we are controlled by the word of god amen by the grace of god there are thoughts here i want to express but we'll leave that for another service concerning wisdom versus faith amen it's one thing to have wisdom another thing that faith the grace of god the faith that believes god yes but the faith that trusts god yes and faith that obeys god amen it's one thing to believe in god and to believe in god another thing they well i trust god do you you can say you trust him but do you obey him amen because your your obedience is going to be a testimony of your trust by the grace of god so god help us brother is my prayer to believe god trust god and obey god amen especially concerning the hour that we're living in for the resurrection and the rapture god help us we thank the lord for the word but lord help us to move on to the faith that the words ordained to give not just to have the wisdom of this of the doctrines the wisdom of this teaching and that teaching but brother let's have the faith that god is looking for in this age thank god for the faith in all the other ages but now brother god's looking for the faith in this age and oh my if he's looking for anything else it is the baptism of divine love and he he's allowing this to go on and on and on he's allowing this to happen that to having what he's going to bring out the love that the bride's got for one another one thing the love that they got for him but if you've got love for him like i said you would have love for one another and he wants to bring that out lovest thou me more than these god help us not that you don't love the other but jesus said love us thou mean more than these are you going to give your life for me as he would lay down his life for us he loved us amen see understand that again loveth thou me more than these he wasn't he wasn't saying you shouldn't love the other but love him more he's your lord he's your savior god help us thank god for what he's done and thank god for what he's doing thank god for what he's going to do but he's got he's got to get us to line up with what he's doing so that we're going to identify with what he will do the resurrection the rapture god help us that we're going to experience the resurrection constantly amen to in our souls we're resurrected in our souls and we are raptured in our souls we've been caught up to heavenly places raptured as i said i preached it one time in another church in up in canada and they were wondering what what does he mean we're resurrected the resurrection is on the rapture's on no he's leaving the impression he's been resurrected and he's been raptured and i remember even the pat they were wondering i knew i could feel that spirit all the whole congregation was that there was maybe three or four hundred people there and you were wondering and i remember now the pastor he was sitting there sitting on the right side there and he just turned around looked at his audience and he he's shaking his head i said lord you don't agree with it so i i went into a greater revelation of it to explain what i meant by i am
