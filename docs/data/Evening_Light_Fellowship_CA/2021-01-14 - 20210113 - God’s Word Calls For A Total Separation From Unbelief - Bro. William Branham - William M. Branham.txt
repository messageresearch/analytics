few requests here tonight um remember brother a joural of course he brings the word of God and the Saints around the island also brother anic uh sent a an email today just let us know that they made it through uh Labrador City and uh he's uh he had a bit of an eventful trip got stuck a couple of times in the snow where there was nobody and no Communications but uh God sent somebody allowed to pull him out of uh out of the drift or wherever he was so anyway he he got there and uh he just wanted me to greet the church on his behalf they're praying for us and I told them we'd be praying for them as well so he's you're not used to it up there he said you're driving on ice so he's he's not used to that so just be in prayer for him also of course brother Chad working want to remember him brother PA Baker request for sister Violet regular uh that came from Sister ien Gail out in the corner raran and uh that's her sister we knew sister Violet from years ago uh she's having uh digestion problems and uh she's been having uh trips back and forth to emergency so she's been quite sick and prayer was requested for her also for brother George Heath uh brother George uh is out in Deer Lake in uh the home out there he's 65 and he has Alzheimer's and also has heart problems as well and he's been having a lot of pain lately so just want to remember brother George uh and also uh remember Sister Kimberly home with brother Michael tonight sister Beverly Gail's been having problems with the lightheadedness and dizziness and ask for prayer for uh for that and uh I mentioned about apal Baker right I did right um and the the other thing was the note from uh brother John sent me this note tonight um it's it's basically concerning uh the not only the Believers in Africa that to me is the Believers everywhere uh but this came from Brother Steven Francis and uh it it had to do with the basically the uh the covid-19 virus um they were having a really tough time in Africa and he said you know ministers have been dying uh with with the disease and uh there's a couple of message ministers and also he said that the um just over the past couple of weeks been 40 doctors that died from this disease and uh he said you know basically the system over there just can't handle it and to me when I read it uh you know and well he he he requested uh prayer of course and uh did has been in touch with the ministers over this way as well in North America and in other parts of the world and um you know U and all of agreed to go to prayer and I think that's passed isn't it that was last probably last week I think do it on a weekly basis on a weekly basis okay so a lot of a lot of Believers have been asked to or all believers been asked to to get together in prayer or or to make it a uh make it a matter of Prayer uh at home as well or wherever so I just want to remember that but to me when I was reading it I mean it's a real reality check if you look at if you look at you know we got it pretty good here and that's by the grace of God you know but like brother Steven said there is a tribulation coming and brother random did say that you know we would probably see the the ushering in of that tribulation which I believe is I believe is happening I believe it's start so uh you know we we ought to thank God every day for the grace that he's given us to be able to do this just to gather together like this you know so uh and for me uh this is this the most important thing is to be able to have uh a time together with the Lord so let's just uh remember that in prayer uh

With Us not past tense or the future present tense amen is Emanuel today it's Emmanuel tonight it's Emanuel tomorrow amen God With Us amen the oh yes praise the name of the Lord like he said I I'm going to send you a comforter he said I won't leave you comfortless he said I'll come to you praise praise the Lord and yet yet there are still those out there in religion and still think oh yeah they're waiting on the on the third per person of the of the Trinity no I said brother that's not it when the brother was trying to show me that's the Trinity right there I Jesus said I'll pray the Father the second that he'll send you another confid or the third I said that's good but go on down for another three or four verses and he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I said so I said what happened to the other two I said because it's all him by the grace of God so thank God for the revelation of his word Allelujah praise the name of the Lord I pray that we have a relationship with him amen we'll we'll keep that relationship we'll stay with that relationship as we've been dealing with God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen not the preacher amen but the word it's there right in the word Genesis the revelation God separating from unbelief is elect his seed his sons and daughters but to God be the glory amen brother I tell you if if it's Emmanuel in your life in in my life amen well brother your say he say he's keeping to to separate you from unbelief Amen brother go oh God help us what is unbelief it's the false teaching of the word amen you don't believe that amen you stay with the truth but believe Jesus said this he now he said believest thou this amen but the enemy is challenging us with doctrines of the church doctrines of man this this no stay with what the Lord said Amen brother the word is eternal he haven't he haven't added to it he don't take away from it he but he he still works according to his word am but he's given us the warning don't add to it don't take from it if you do he said your part will be taken out of the book of life amen what a challenge amen so surely under under that command we we have no desire to add to or take away from the word amen we want to please the Lord by Grace amen so the Lord oh I guess he means we want to go as soon as we can and uh our brother always he brought it up here thank you brother amen I thought it was up here because the Lord willing that we'll go in and uh hear not all of this message on God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief and again it's not man it's it's God's word god through in his word god through his word brother Matthew reminded me that we heard it WR three weeks ago well we'll hear it again amen so that that one that one H us let's see let's see if we remember it I didn't I I didn't remember it brother Matthew remembered it I said I I don't remember it amen because I want to go back to it again and again and again amen and brother if we remember it let's not remember it in our heads let's remember it in our hearts amen there's too many got the remembrance in their head and they think oh this is good I I know the word I know the word you the devil does too amen because he know what God Said in his word god going to do this God's going to do that and brother he's there to challenge what God Said Amen but again let's believe it not in our heads but in in our hearts amen Brothers in the in the heart is where God works amen again to know this that that the Watchtower the devil's Watch Tower is up here yeah and he he'll focus on that he get you to focus on it just your thoughts your intellectual thoughts I remember this I remember that yeah what about the heart amen that's where God's working in the heart praise the Lord so the Lord willing we're going to hear a portion it might be it may be an hour uh now all of the of the of this message right here because uh we've already gotten into the first few pages so we're going to start maybe on page 10 no I'm sorry we'll be starting on page seven I believe around there and uh we just go on to page maybe 27 and or not there and we'll stop it because brother bandam finishes this message and he goes into a prayer line and so there's several Pages there for the prayer line but when he finishes the message we'll we'll we'll we'll finish it there I've given the information to brother Matthew and brother Vel amen so the Lord bless us as we go into what the prophet has explained concerning God's word it calls for a total separation from unbelief amen not a partial separation a total separation amen and God is expressing that that command and that desire that he wants in US he expressing it in his word because it's the word that calls for separation amen so the Lord blesses so if you would you going to turn to me turn with me rather to the Book of Romans chapter 8 amen and also to ask you to keep our brother Ellsworth and sister Ellsworth in prayer uh they will be journeying to St John's tomorrow and they will be uh fellowshipping with us and we have to take them to a the hospital St Clair's Hospital uh on Friday he has a an appointment there because he's got a problem with his voice and of course it's I I know that problem that he has with his voice and he can barely talk and you know and it's very very very low and uh the last two times that he talked with me that his voice has changed from that previous time to the last time that he spoke with me and uh but he he's always there on the phone and to to explain what his problem is and it's very very low so I understand that uh he's coming in here and the doctors will be going down into his throat and the someone said they they're going to remove whatever is in his in his throat the voice box and remove remove what's in the voice box so we pray the grace of God to be with brother Ellsworth of course he's a brother and he's in his 80s and sister ellworth of course also in her 80s and we know that a few months ago that sister ellworth was here and had surgery and uh she they really appreciated the the Believers from the assembly here going to visit with her amen oh yeah there was always somebody there with her and at the time of course brother Monda was here and he did go in too and pray with her at the at the place that she was staying at the time so pray God's grace to brother hellsworth as he come with his voice problem and that the Lord amen will Undertake and give him the victory amen so the grace of God be with us in Romans chapter 8 and we'll read beginning at verse one there is therefore now no condemnation Amen to them which are in Christ Jesus amen so the grace of God if you got condemn condemnation you're not in Christ but if you're in Christ it takes it away why because Christ gives us the faith that all is all is done in him amen no man can lay a charge against God's elect who are in who are with with Christ and Christ with them you are in him and he's in you there's a Oneness there amen so I pray Grace that we believe so he said amen I pray Grace that we can say Amen to that there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Oh Praise the Lord if you're experiencing it you better make your calling and election sure amen you better make your relationship with Jesus sure amen by the grace of God so he said and is those in Christ they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen so you're going to experience a total separation from from unbelief praise the Lord Lord because you are in Christ and Christ is in you and we're not walking after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus as made me free from the law of sin and death praise the Lord Allelujah Hallelujah for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sent in his own own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh amen that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US Allelujah who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit praise the Lord so we're not judged by the flesh we're judged by the spirit that's in control amen we're not walking after the flesh and the and many will condemn us and say you're you're a sinner you do this you do that but we walk after the spirit amen and we have that anointing and that spirit with us in us and around us amen it is the spirit of Christ in US amen the hope of glory but and what does it do it gives us a faith that we're going to get a new body yes amen we're in that there will be no nothing that the enemy should be able to condemn us anyhow amen cuz that new body is a glorified body praise the Lord amen in this body we're dealing with the with the senses of the Flesh in this body oh yeah the devil is there and he he's there to tempt us this this and this but we keep coming back to the word to get the victory amen as our lord Jesus did praise the Lord amen and we got the promise and we keep reminding the devil amen we're going to receive a glorified body like onto his glorious body Amen brother we're longing for it look looking for it hungering for it thirsting for it amen every and hour that we need it is now oh my yes sir considering what's going on in the world and around the world yes just I I I believe it's it's a sign of the end again but I don't know if you did maybe some of us did receive the email and uh I think it's from some African Brethren and uh asking the question concerning covid-19 is this do does this have anything to do with the end does this anything to do with God's judgment upon the Earth and it is as I have said before I look out and I said I can look around I can I see the fire of God falling that's what that's what I feel oh yeah I see this and I see that I have this this experience and I said oh Lord what's going on I said this must be the fire of God and judgment falling so the grace of God be with us amen that we're going to be in in the spirit not in the flesh not governed by the flesh but governed by the Holy Ghost in US amen why because if it's in the spirit that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit and that's the word amen but to be carnally minded and just too many too many Believers that are kindly minded they are they're more caught up with the world than with the word oh yeah more caught up with the things of the world than they are with the word and the promise of God Amen they're looking forward for this do this do this do this it's it's it's loving the world and the things of the world Amen but if you're the elect if you're the bride of Christ you're not concerned with the world you're you're concerned with the promise I want to get out of here Lord amen as God eats it you eat it amen so he said to be kindly minded he said is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen God grant us that eternal life and that peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be amen so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God Amen if you're going to live after the flesh the desires of the Flesh and and your intellectual mind and intellectual Faith you don't please God oh no you he's not interested in that he's interested in absolute Holy Ghost Faith you believe the word period amen you're not going to reason with God Amen the devil want you to reason with the word no no you take you it is written thus sayith the Lord amen oh what what what about this forget it Satan it is written oh what about this no Satan get behind me it's thus sayeth the Lord amen we're not going to reason with him oh well I'll explain this I'll explain that no way amen we don't need it explained it needs to be believed amen if anything that God has been endeavoring to get his seed to do down Through the Ages is believe his word period amen just but so I believe God I believe it's written I believe thus say the Lord I believe that God wants us to do this is right here in the word right here the enemy is right there to reason with it amen or to add a word to it or take a word from it amen again that's why Jesus warned us in Revelation don't add to don't take from it amen praise the Lord and that's why he prayed the grace of God be with us amen why because we need that Grace to to to give us the strength and the and the and the fullness by oh yes the courage to move on stay with the word all oh yeah the enemy is there to give you fear Amen to cause you to doubt this doubt that but Lord if it's the holy if it's the Holy Ghost you got no fear that's right he takes away fear amen God help us so again he said to be Carly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace praise the Lord because the carnal mind is enemity make sure you don't have a carnal mind tonight yes to receive the word amen because that's imity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in this flesh cannot please God if you're governed by your fleshly desires and feelings you cannot please God no because why because faith without faith it's impossible to please him amen because by faith you don't you don't reason you don't it's not not intellectual it's spiritual I believe you going on Amen you don't have to understand it but do you believe it not that they would understand the resurrection but he said to Martha believest thou this when he said I am the resurrection amen that's amazing that he would challenge them with that Revelation before he had he did it amen God do we believe it for every and hour that that Believers should believe it it's us amen because as the prophet said the dead in Christ is going to appear to the living Saints first and then he said the living Saints going to be step into that Dimension and going to be changed in into a glorified body and he said that's when when we're going to look up and we're we'll all look up there he is amen coming down to receive us God help us that is more real to us than what's going on in the in in the world that it's more to real to us than what's going on in Canada or England or what's going on in the United States amen cuz if there's over a time that the United States experienced Insanity it's now amen and brother the prophet warned us that the world's going to go insane amen I trust it'll not influence you that you're you're going to be brother what is our sanity it's the word of God Amen our sanity is the word it's not what we think or what we we feel about the word but it's what God has given us concerning his word what God has revealed to us concerning his word amen that's our sanity but to the world it is it is insane no no we're staying with the word they considered Isaiah or not Isaiah Noah to be insane what preaching about a flood a flood building a big Ark oh yeah and no doubt as the prophet has said no doubt there's many of them were building their own little B but that wasn't going to save them only the ark would save them amen if they believe Noah amen just think God asked him to do something that God had not done before amen did he believe it yes he believed it amen and we know that even the serpent seed came through the came came through the the flood on the ark we won't get into that but the Bible does identify one of Noah's sons that had that serpent seat spirit amen and God cast him away from from Noah that was after the flood and so on God help us brother and sister let's believe brother if anything that pleases God and God loves it is Faith yes amen it is that Sons and Daughters out there with faith amen not just out of your mouth but out of your heart amen not only that God looks at you and he sees you living faith yes you're Living Faith you're walking Faith your talk Faith amen God help us oh yeah God looks at the heart not saying oh I believe this I believe that well the Devil Makes that confession that he believes it because of God's word he know what God has done amen and what God is doing Do We Believe brother we need the change yes let's make sure you're dead to Satan's influence in your mind amen grace of God again verse n verse 80 said then they that are in the flesh cannot please God God help us my Lord I want to please you so help me keep convicting me if I get out of the spirit convict me to get back in amen but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his Grace Grace Grace and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness and again it's the righteousness of Christ imputed to you praise the Lord and if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you God help us to believe amen therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live and it's eternal life by the grace of God Amen if ye through the spirit the Holy Spirit do mortify and to mortify is to kill the Deeds of the body we shall live amen by grace for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen thank God God bless his word to our hearts and the Lord willing will go into the into the message that the prophet preached January 21st 1964 amen God's

name of our Lord Jesus Christ Grace in the hearing of your servant the prophet in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen God bless you may be seated and again this was January 21st 1964 and the title is God's word God's word calls for a total separation amen it it's not just the me not just the preacher not just another brother or sister but it's God in his word amen God bless you is it right for us to obey man or God when they questioned them about the experience of Pentecost now the first man separated himself the first Adam from the word to go with his wife that question whether God kept his word or not what a perfect type of the lukewarm carnal minded believer today that's still wants to cling with what the tradition says instead of taking what the word says that's it a very real type he was separated to his wife the carnal believer is separated from the word to the church amen but when the second Adam was created in the womb of a woman and came to the world he was a Nazarite to the word of God he was separated from the world to the world Amen now Hebrews the 7th chapter 26th verse tells us that that them priest continually died but this Jesus is Holy and separated from Sinners sin is unbelief there was no unbelief found in nowhere when he was here on Earth he said who can condemn me of sin amen sin is unbelief if I haven't done just what was prophesied for this age if I haven't met the requirements of what Messiah is supposed to do then don't believe me said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me tell you who he is because it had been prophesied since Eden that there would come a savior yes the prophet said he'd be born of a virgin and how that he'd be called Emmanuel and also he was a counselor the Prince of Peace Mighty God and that's what they accused him of making himself God he was God Amen he was the Prince of Peace the Mighty God and the Everlasting father there's no other father but him spiritually speaking he's the only father the father of us all and we find all believers he's the father of all who will believe his word for he was completely separated from the church from his Traditions from his mother from the world and only did that which pleased the father now he was a different person from Adam no matter what anybody questioned to him the word it was the word always first and he proved that the word was right when Satan tried to whitewash it for him and said it's written he said yes and it's also written amen he withstood Satan upon the word because that's what he was the word the Bible First John St John the first chapter said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he's the same yesterday today and forever it's always a connection with the spoken word of God God's promise for the day and when it comes it's so unusual the people can hardly grasp it because we're so SED into to farms and ideas of our own yes that it's hard for us to grasp what's truth amen I think much of that would apply to to Joseph in the days of of the the Mary in her maternity she she was to be mother and Joseph loved her and he he wanted to believe he was a righteous man a good man and he wanted to believe that story that Mary was telling him but still there was a question that now she's a good woman no doubt Mary Had explained to him the visit of Gabriel to her and he was a just man in the lineage of David and yet her it looked like that she was trying to use him for a shield to take off her reproach because if she was engaged to him and to be found in this condition was the same as adultery Deuteronomy tells us so and would be stoned for the ACT and it looked like that she was using him for a shield and the man a good man a just man the Bible said he was a just man but her case was so unusual that he could not grasp it he' look in her lovely face and the sincerity and honesty that she would tell her story in and no doubt but he'd go to his home or his Cartner shop say I I just can't see how she would tell me wrong but the case is so unusual if he would have only searched the scriptures that a virgin is to conceive amen see it was so unusual to him because it was out of the line of his thinking but she is exactly in the scripture and so is it today Brethren that the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promised word of this hour is so unusual good man St over it it's too unusual they say that the dead was raised up the blind see the death here the Holy Spirit discerns the thoughts foretells things that's coming to pass never fail at one time or they they can't can't grasp it it's so unusual so they they uh say well it's a telepathy or it's a evil spirit just like they did in that day the unusualness of the word of God but when when a man is born in the world for a a Believer he becomes a Nazarite when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word amen a total separation Jesus said I come to separate a man from his wife tear up a family and he that won't uh take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be called mine a separation from everything anything from church from from a community from a belief or from family or anything that would stand between you and believing the entire word of God if your soul will not punctuate every promise for this hour with an amen there's something wrong somewhere you need a separation so Jesus was the word made flesh and he was completely separated from Sinners unbelievers that the word itself flowed completely and and thoroughly flew through him that he said I do nothing until I see the father do it first they asked him question him about things he said verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing watch everything that he said was perfect amen just he had not to asked about it think about it it was perfect and his perfect truth always separated the truth from ARA even as I quote back again again his mother said thy father and I before those priests that should already testify it was a virgent barnon but in the moments of her grief How could a 12-year-old boy we have no record of him even being in school how could his intelligence be so great as to debate with the priest Sage learned man and why when she called that this Joseph was his father quickly the word of God he was separated he was the word and the word corrected the error know ye not that I must be about my father's Goods that was not just that little 12y old boy that was the word of God speaking through his little childish mouth to correct error separating like he did in the beginning Darkness from Life aive from the truth death from life it's a separation always the word requires total and complete separation amen regardless Jesus said let every man's word be a lie let mine be true right all down Through the Ages the same thing has happened it's a separating always he separates his people from the unbelief he did it at the beginning he does it same today each one of the prophets was separated from unbelief the reason they did that is because the word of the Lord came to them now believe a night somewhere perhaps this here Sunday or last night that I was speaking what the word sear in the Old Testament meant it meant a man a diviner a man that would tell the future events that were coming to pass and then when they come to pass exactly without failure come to pass exactly what he said then God said listen to this man or hearing fear Him for I'm with him then he had the Divine interpretation of the written word for that was his credentials of identification that he was God's prophet and the word come to him amen right now separation it's separ at Isaiah from the church World it separated Moses from the church World it separated the uh all the the great prophets to the ages from the church world because they had it separated Jesus from his Brethren it separated the apostles from the church it was at that day the Pharisees Sadducees great man holy man good man fine man humble man man that had fruit of the spirit more so than what Jesus exercised but what was his credentials that the word was with him the word promised of that day was living through him he said which one of you can condemn me of sin which one of you can say that what I have claimed hasn't happened that for he showed that he was a separated Nazarite of the Lord he was the Lord himself in flesh Abraham also he was a separated person from the world Amen when God called Abraham at 75 years old separate yourself from your Kindred and from all you the unbelief and come out into a world that you've never walked in before and amongst a people that you've never known before come out and separate yourself from anybody that would be contrary to what you're believing that You' be a Nazarite unto the Lord because he was holding a promise of a son amen he had to separate from his father from his mother from his Kindred and what separated him not because he was a good man but because he believed that God was able to keep the promise he had given and when he was 25 years later and the baby had never come Sarah being 90 he 100 and when the angel of the Lord visit him at Jesus referred to that would come again in the last days God in a human form sat down before him and Tau and Sarah being almost 100 years old in the tent behind him laughed because the angel said I will visit you according to the time of the promise and she said me being old and would have pleasure again with my Lord seeing he's old and this man which was God in flesh said why did Sarah laugh in the tent now she run out and tried to deny but he said yes but you did laugh because it she didn't believe it could be right now notice Jesus said that would come again amen as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man amen again the spirit of God will come upon martal human flesh that man eat the meat of a calf drinking the milk from the cow eat butter and bread in human flesh and Abraham said he was Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus promised that God before his coming would be manifested in human flesh again that's the Holy Spirit he's only one God manifesting itself separating again lot from Abraham lot wanted the world God SE tore up his world and separated Abraham and lot lot being a type again of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true he just went on down in Sodom and he didn't have the real spunk to stand out as we' call it and call what was right right and wrong wrong so he went down all these believers says we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket in God's hands you pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half a dollars dollar all in coins now that's what the world is in God's hand there's some people that's just can have a Penny's worth of it yes and God can only use them in a penny way amen that's all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses pennies sometimes amen lot was just a penny Abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make an Abraham so it take a hundred carnal Believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that separate at it from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can blow through him he can only take a Penny's worth that's all he's got so you see people say I don't believe in healing I don't believe in these things just know it's a penny but just let him alone just a Penny's worth and so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone remember that's just all farther he can go amen Joseph he was separated from his brethren yeah I didn't mean that hard in that way that I said it see I mean if he just well I belong to this and that's what we believe it's just a penny go ahead see just aend he say well the Lord bless you my brother see he's copper he can never be silver so just let it go ahead God can use him oh he's using it I'd rather see him down there in a church and see a barroom stand there on the corner would you sure so just let it alone God can use it anyhow maybe not very much but he'll use what he can use as much as he'll let him use that's right so that's kind of a rude way to express it anything but I well I hope you get the truth that I mean what what is meant see he can't believe in discernment and the powers of God is Promised for this days those Pharisees couldn't do it either they couldn't see Jesus being God oh no you make yourself God a man one day he was standing there at you multiplied loaves of bread and so forth for them and he said um unless you eat the the bread uh the son of man's body and drink his blood uh there's no life in you oh imagine this coner conation they walked away from him this man expects us to be a cannibal eat somebody's flesh oh that's crazy Doctors medical doctors and so forth said the man's insane that's all there is the priest is right that man is crazy give us his body to eat that's all he said see but the spiritual mind maybe they could not understand it those disciples they didn't know just exactly what it meant but they believed it anyhow because where did it come from it come from the one they know to be the Son of God I'm not be able to understand all in year but I believe it it's God's word I want to separate myself from anything it's contrary to it Tri to stand like that notice another group the 70 he' called one day he standing talking to them and he said the son of man shall Ascend up into heaven from whence he come from they said this man he's taking us to the place he was born we know his mother Mary while we know his brothers we know all and then this man's going to take a the son of man is coming going up into heaven from when he come from he come from Bethlehem how did he do that see he said it in that way see and they walked with him no more they walked away they said ah this man we know there's something wrong with him them disciples sat right there see they believed they had seen the promised word for that day Vindicated and manifested by who could create but God God himself could take bread and they know he was a Son of God whether it was in riddles or not that whether they understood it or not they walked right on anyhow because a word was Vindicated and they were separated from anything contrary to it God help us to have faith like that we believe this Bible to be the truth I may not have faith enough to make all the promises come to pass but I believe it anyhow amen I believe the hour that we're living Joseph separated from his brethren Without a Cause now what was the matter with him he was not willing to be separated it wasn't his will to separate but they separated themselves from him see from his bright shiny dollar their pennies worth couldn't stand it they know they were Patriarchs they know that Isaac was their U pardon me Jacob was their father and they know that to be true but Joseph was born he couldn't help it he was spiritual he saw Visions could interpret dreams and they were perfectly right whatever he said was the truth and his patriarch Brothers moved with envy and sold him to the Egyptians see they they separated themselves from him because they were pennies he was of a different quality so is a real believer today he's of a different quality they'll separate themselves they don't understand it Copper from Silver now we find out they move with Envy insulting why they do the same thing today amen what it really was they said they were it was for jealousy they didn't want to break down because if the quality in them were not the quality was in him and because of it they were jealous because they were pennies and he was a dollar see now if the penny say blessed be the name of the Lord my brother dollar here see I can't make the change that he does but I'll make what I can that's that we go along man God to get his program over as I preached to you Sunday the great Symphony of God's word being beat out the changes and Junctions is only God Changing Times like the the director in the symphony when we see these Chang es of Ages and changes of times look down on the sheet here and you'll find out we're supposed to be here they've got to do this there's no way for him to keep from it amen and the music to a man that doesn't understand the sympathy what is it it's a bunch of rattling no he doesn't understand it he's not even interested he's wishing I wish it shut up so I could go home he's not interested cuz he doesn't know the sympathy he doesn't know it but the composure knows the end from from the beginning see and if the director isn't In The Same Spirit of the composure he cannot act it out because it's all done by signs and if a sign don't vindicate it how's the musicians going to play it amen that's it if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can can who know how to prepare for war or Retreat or what doing look at the word and see where we're living then you can see Penny it's what they do but you can see those who are glistening watching and knows the word watching for these signs to happen there it is like the little woman at the well when he said go get your husband she said I have none said that's right you got five she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet we haven't had him for hundreds of years but we know the messiah's coming and he's going to be a prophet that's what he'll do he said I'm he all the sympathy beat went just exactly right from the Lord fromp to the high she ran into the City and said come see a man who's told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah that we look forward to certainly see she understood what the Sheep music was in the sympathy that separates belief from unbelief faith can only not come by a church Faith comes by hearing the word of God knowing what it is now we find the same thing today many people look at gifts and closing now five more minutes people look at gifts and they think oh what a great thing and they try to impersonate gifts you can't do that that's right you just you can't make a a a penny be a dollar you can't make it be a dime see you can't make it be a nickel it's Penny amen but if you just recognize yourself as a penny go with the rest to change see God can use you we might not be able to do all there wasn't everybody when God called Israel out of Egypt every one of them didn't have to do the same thing Moses did but they believed it right they believe Moses because they know that it was a sign of the hour and had God had proved that he had his word amen they said Pharaoh's got Spears he said but Moses has his word hallelujah that's it Pharaoh's might have an army but Moses had the word because he was God's prophet and the word come to him and been Vindicated that it was the truth it was a living God who could take dust and throw it up and make fleas come man can't do that as a man that stood there and said tomorrow about this time it be such and such and it was see they know Moses had God's word no matter how many Spears and dungeons Pharaoh had and how many bricks to make Moses had the word so they started Into the Wilderness there was a man day and said Moses takes too much upon himself we're all holy people people so we all are to be able to do what Moses did and Moses said God what about this he said separate yourself get away from him and he opened up the Earth and swallowed up Dayan in his group he separated light from Darkness amen by vindicating his word he's the same God today Jesus closing I was telling you last night when I first come to here this is not personal if you think that then please just pull down the curtains to your heart I'm saying this to people who believe it was spoken told exactly what things would take place down through the age and you're all witnesses that is your witness last night from the discernment on down and how to be imperson impersonating and everything take place but the last thing was to be a great thing would take place yes we've been watching for it for years we all know when it happened first when a creation come into existence the third time and then the fourth time last night I told told you the fifth time it happened and it's waiting for this Council of churches when it unites in the Protestants if I speak Sunday morning that's what I I mean Saturday morning that's what I want to speak on see now and then when this gets together then the spirit of God always raises a standard against them there's man sitting here tonight who's a witness of this I was in Colorado not long ago this last fall I go up there on hunting trips and it's usually I'm up there on my wedding annivers when my wife and I got married I I'd saved all my nickels and things and for my work and had them in a baking powder can and i' didn't have enough take a honeymoon and go hunting so I just blend them together and I took her on a hunting trip for a honeymoon so since then I to my shame I have never been home with her on her anniversary I was in Colorado last night I seen two or three ministers was here that was with me up there in a camp where I had to come down from Alaska and meet him hunting is a Martin boy they was here last night here right back there and then that other little fell I forget his name said were you there too sunny that's right and um maybe a uh brother Palmer here right and we were up in the mountains and I'm a guide in Colorado hunted in there for years and every time our anniversary 23rd of October comes along there's a little place where I taken the wife on our honeymoon up in the ader mountains and this place looks just like it only that was this is quake and ass up here the Little Thicket and up there it was Birch and I walk out there on the 23rd sometime through the day take off my hat and thank the Lord for a good loyal wife it's been loyal and been kind to me through these years it's helped me as I'll go to preach the gospel and it's been awful dry in Colorado this year as it has been across the country and all at once there was I suppose there was 200 men ahead of us or 100 man pardon me about 100 man ahead of us up above the camps and they've been shooting up there for four or five days and I'd shout a de wanted i' been hunting for years and I but I come a fog down and I didn't get to see him I couldn't find him and I'd been hunting for him that day and the next day the phone or the coming on the radio a blizzard coming could dump 20 foot of snow in these mountains overnight and so I said to the brother I called him in the Martin boys was there also I said breth you hear what the news say now if you want to get out you better go right now because it's going to be too late you might stay here for a week and I'm should go because next Monday I've got a meeting Christian businessman Full Gospel businessman at the chapter at Tucson however you make your choice if you want to stay I'm your guide I'll stay here with you every one of them voted we'll stay we'll stay the Martin boys having a low speeed truck or highspeed truck rather they all we had a couple of extra deer there we give them to the Martin boys and that and they went out because they wouldn't get out of there that's all so they they're sitting here as a witness tonight and then the next day I thought well it didn't snow that day the day they went out I said I'm going to call the wife and tell her I'm thankful for her being a nice wife and all it's her anniversary and then tomorrow I'll go up to the place if we get up there for the snow and so I I went in I couldn't call her I come back and everybody in town getting ready the big blizzard is coming the paper says could dump 20 foot of snow and call her out of that night brother Tom Simpson is setting present here somewhere tonight or should be he was in Canada and was on rode down and they bypass said bypass Colorado Great Blizzard are you here brother Simpson where are you yes sitting back in a vacuum and they told him bypass Colorado a great blizzard coming on so I I told sister and and another man's wife brother Evans I don't think brother Evans is here tonight they said just come in are you here brother Evans and um I don't think he's gotten here'll be here at the conventional so uh I called his wife and I said I couldn't get my wife she's gone out to the store and I said tell her to tell brother ton stry which was the president of the chapter if I'm not in there Sunday get another speaker ready because I may not be able to get out of here at all I'm with these men then what taking place the that night it didn't snow the next morning the clouds was real low and angry I said now Brethren I've HED cattle in here for years and guided the first little drop of rain take back for the camp as quick as you can call within 15 minutes I see the time you couldn't see your hand before you for two or three days at a time twisting blizzard that's 9,000 F feet right there and I said you you'll just be in a blizzard and you'll be lost and you'll die here in the mountains now we'll go out I placed each man now went up over the top I said now if I don't if don't wait for me to come in hurry just as quick as it starts the first little speck of rain Rush quickly to the campus because you won't be able to find your way back they said they would do it I climbed High coyotes hollering everywhere I knew the weather was going to change then all at once a big blast of wind come and the Sleep begin to fall and I said but I guess everybody's headed back well I stood and looked around I thought I wish I could find that deer before I go back because snow will cover him up they won't be found Immortal spring so I thought I HED so hard for that deer and the first deer I ever let get by like that since I've own this little rifle of 55 head a game with it and I thought well I I I just hate to see it get away like that and just a moment great big snow drops look like quarters just the falling everywhere and the wind started blowing and I could hardly see how to get off the top of this peak and I know to stay on this Ridge and if I went down and hit the creek I'd go down the creek to I hit a little foot bridge then I could feel my way up till I got to where the tent was that's the only way you can get out and so I thought if I ever make a move one way or the other that's all you'll never be found so you die right in there so I started back down the mountain and I got down about oh I guess 300 yards or 400 from where I was now this sounds strange but I got a Bible in here before me a Heavenly Father bearing me a record amen uh almost in a run trying to get off the wind is blowing so hard up there and U I could see about 20 ft in front of me in the thickets I was in the timber and the wind blowing and twisting and the boy said stop go back where you come from I stopped I thought maybe that's just the sound of that wind I wasn't thinking about nothing like that I waited just a moment and one of the boys had fixed me a sandwich and I pulled it out and it was really a sandwich me raining sweetness it's a big lump of of bread with some meat in somewhere but I I was kind of hungry so I eat it anyhow and I stand there and I Beed the little piece of paper so animals see those things and anything in Civilization they run get away so uh stood there a little bit and I thought well I'll go on I started on and just as plain as you hear my voice something said turn and go back where you come from how could that be God telling me to walk into that death trap I stood there a minute and I thought that's the same one that said about them squirrels the same one I told you about last night about my wife just the voice just the human boys the same one told me when I was a little boy I never drink or smoke and these things would be in the last days God and me telling us the Bible over my heart what good would do me to tell you something wrong and know that I'm sending my soul to hell it's true it's unusual but it's true well I thought I know enough to obey that voice why would I he's got some reason for me to go up there maybe it's my time to go so I turned and making my way through the Wilderness until I got up to that saddle again way up maybe uh 300 yard 400 above right straight up the mountain like that again it was so thick up there then I couldn't see nothing the wind trees just laying over and twisting and I took my rifle I had on a red shirt in a red cap and I put the rifle keeping smoking up the the scope in it because bear and stuff moving them kind of time so does line and I I run into one the scope all smoked up and I just held it up like this uh not against me smoke but keep the fog out of it and the wet from the snow and I sat down under a tree I sat there I thought well why would he want me to come up here I I doubt very much I can find my way down now the getting so terrific I can see about 10 or 15 ft maybe hardly that far sometimes not over 5T and getting rougher all the time well um oh well he said come back all I know do sit here and the snow then about an inch or inch and a half maybe 2 Ines on the ground it' been about 20 30 minutes and and it's blowing so hard is blowing it away too and I sat there just a moment I Heard a Voice he said I'm the god of Heaven who created the heavens and earth I jerked off my hand C and I just sit still now listen again I thought that wasn't the wind oh blowing making noise I heard it again that I'm the one who steal the winds upon the Mighty Sea I'm the one the Creator I created squirrels in your presence I did these things I said yes Lord I believe you said stand on your feet I stood up to my feet he said I speak to the storm it'll do what you tell it to do now that is true I when I meet you at the Judgment I'll have all this to answer for amen I thought he I said St go to your place stop the sun you shine normally for 4 days and no more than I said that the sleep and hail which is about to blow me down just stopped and within a moment or two the Sun was shining right down through upon me and I looked down across the mountains I see a a East Wind come the wind was coming from the West East Wind come and was coming this way I see the clouds this mysteriously where they went I don't know and I stood there a few moments tears running down through my beard them gray oh God H I don't know what to do I thought well I was I guess the brother all back in the tent and sun shining everywhere I started walking down the mountain snow all drying up that hot sun steam coming out of my shirt just a moment or two difference and I started walking down the mountain when I did I said Heard a Voice say why don't you walk with me amen I said Lord the greatest privilege I ever had I turned and started back down through the big deer Trails down through that virgent Forest I thought well I'll walk on down that way to where I always pay my salute to me my wife I was going along there some about half half hour 3/4 later snow was all dried up and gone I begin to think I wonder why she has never said anything to me about going I said I remember when I first H her up there and lift her over them logs when we were married I said no she's great I went uh Gray beard over my face black and gray mixed together I thought bill you ain't got much longer you're getting old and I started moving along and I looked up looked like I could see standing before me they at their arms out still blackheaded I help my head down I swor up a little place where some quaking ass and there's a little Crook and I lean my head against the lamb like this I stand there crying now I could hear something going Pat Pat Pat and I looked down it was a water coming from my eyes through my beard hitting on them dry leaves or about 30 minutes before there was an inch of snow and it blizzarding when I come down off the mountain 4 days later not one cloud in the sky for 4 days later I come in I said to The Filling Station man did u b pretty dry yes said you know the strangest thing was predicted a storm the other day and you know it stopped all at once and then I come on down to New Mexico line coming back to Arizona and I said to Billy my son I said let's go in here and just see if it's down this way I stopped in there on a Sunday morning got some uh and got some gasoline and the man said well I've been hunting I said yes sir any luck I said yes sir we had a fine time I said looks pretty dry he said yes it's been awful dry through here he said we was promised a big snow the other day and said you know the blizzard actually started and somehow another it quit oh my my heart I was standing out side of this tree and Clos God standing inside this tree the tears dropping from my eye I thought God just think the same God that said peace be still to the waves yes Lord and the winds obey he still the same Jesus Is Right In The W with us he's still the word the word all Nature has to obey his word for he's a creator of nature I stood there and the tears dropping off of my cheeks and for about 5 years now I've been off the field just going to churches and whatever I could you all know that and my heart's been burdened I'd go out here come to Arizona he would tell me things do it i' go do it but look like the Revival's over and I couldn't wonder what was taking place in my heart I'd repent I say Lord if I've done anything tell me I'll make it right it's burdened all time just a horrible feeling I couldn't have the victory that I wanted many great things he had done and showed what you all are witnesses coming here and telling you about it seen the papers packet and magazines and so forth about the great Supernatural things that's been seen and done but my heart was still heavy I was leaning against the bush just like this I thought the Great great God Of Heaven that warm sun shining on me not a cloud nowhere and a few moments ago you just you just contradicted the man's word nature did it how could it be done Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it was his word that you just had me to speak yes Father how grateful I am I heard something going and I look standing right before me was two three deer and they were looking at me now them deer been shot at much in the last week and there was hunters in there and here I was dressed in red anyone knows they're gone that quick but they were looking at me and for eating de it could been no better was a big dough two big full grown fonds I thought that's just right we need three deer something said you know uh the Lord's put them in your hands but when I was with the Full Gospel business man brother Clayton about a year before he went with us when I caught that big record fish that year for a man I killed 19 head of elk and I the sometime businessman excuse this my brother some of them are doctors and you know they can't walk and fat you know and Men s to a desk and said Billy get me one two-y old get me a Blue Cow I want a buck get me a a full rack well I just had a jubilee out there shooting getting the El and thing but the Lord told me not to do that and I promised him in that blizzard over there in Colorado not years before that I said Lord I'll lead man to the game but no more kill game for man no not this it's emergency we have to have it and if you remember boys the night before we left poor little old brother down there hadn't got a deer what's his name polymer come around and put a $10 ties in my hand he said brother Brandon this is my ties put in the church he said will you get me a deer oh I said uh brother Palmer I I'll do what I can and then up there a deer and right there in front of me stood those three deer I had this rifle of mine on my shoulder i s my shoulder like that I thought they can't get away from me they're right here I too fast at the rifle I get all three of them before you can turn around see and I had the r I thought there they are right I just slipped the rifle then I Happ to think of that promise I said I can't do it I can't do it amen I said I remember one time that a man told another God has put joab in your hand or sa joab told David David said God forbid that I touch his anointed that was my promise I wouldn't do it I thought they're right top of this hill I can roll them right down there we can pick them up easy three fine deer standing there I said no I can't do it and here this coming up like that a FS two full grown male female and a mother deer and they come walking looking around great big fat fellas I stood there a little bit and I thought that's unusual for deer and me this red all night like that I thought I'll scare them I said you're in my hands you couldn't get away if you wanted to but I'm not going to hurt you gu they just looked at one another and they kept coming and they got real close to me looking at me well I set the rifle down on the ground I said mother take your babies and go on out in the woods I'm here enjoying myself in the presence of God I promised that I wouldn't kill game for other people amen I said now you take your of babies and go on in the woods I love that Woods Too go on out she looked at me both of them looked around all three of them then they turned and walked away and they come back again I said I'm not going to hurt you I said go on in the woods you're in my hands you couldn't get away but I said I've been in God's hands and yet I couldn't get away either he spared me I made him a promise I'm sparing you Hallelujah go on have a good time enjoy this Woods I like it you go on they stood there a little while walk up course to eat out of my hands almost turn around look all at me like that walked on all P looked back again walked right out in the woods I thought that's unusual for deer wonder if it's because of the Lord Jesus is here his presence and just then a voice spoke to me said you remembered your promise didn't you I knew it was him I said yes Lord he said so do I remember mine I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you that burden lifted Christian friends it hasn't been back since that was last October I've been a different person keep your promise to God whatever you say to God you believe it separate yourself from anything contrary to his word God will hear an answer prayer let us bow our heads just a moment amen are you willing to separate yourself tonight from all unbelief to hear the word of the Lord if you'll do it and believe that he is the same yesterday and forever these things what he has promised to do we see him doing it would you raise your hands and say God I make you promise tonight I believe everything that you promised I believe every word I never doubt the our heavenly father thou knowest this story to be true that was the fourth time and then the fifth time was with my own precious wife when you last week when that doctor writing that statement that big tumor left before his hand touched her just according to what it said now father I pray that you help these people I realize that I'm getting old I know that I must go soon and I pray Lord that let me be honest and sincere with my brethren let be honest and sincere with your people if I can't be with them then I don't think I would be with you Lord because I want to Bear a record of you and I pray that you'll let the word so live in US tonight that you'll give all of us faith and by this little gift that people think sometime that a gift is something that you put in your hands and go out and cut your way through a gift is not that bothered may they understand that a gift is get yourself out of the way so that the Holy Spirit can do what it wants to do Lord let us get ourselves out of the way amen and let the great Holy Spirit come and work through us and may we see tonight the promises of Jesus Christ and the one that I referred to especially tonight Lord that that one where God came down before Abraham manifested in flesh and know the secret of the heart it was God and when he was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he knew the secret of the heart and the Bible says that the word of God is the discerner of the thoughts that's in the heart amen that's how the disciples know that he was God now father when you come tonight and let our poor humble Tabernacles be dedicated to you that you'll cause us to believe that that your spirit might make itself known among us tonight that you're still the word then we'll separate oursel from all unbelief and follow you in Jesus name may you speak to us amen oh th Mighty Man of our the spirit of the Lord and the might of the Lord is upon me even so shall L people here fire word it shall bring life and power and help unto them as the angel of the Lord has spoken of the even now does the spirit of the Lord speak by this voice unto thee be thou encouraged thy Vision shall be renewed thou shall be stren in thy High St thou shall run in th very thy you shall be as the eagle that renews it s the C of people is underne th bring it life as the dry and the [Applause] barers waiting for the rain Lord the people longing those that bound the cries of those that CH waited for [Music] me this voice came not because of the only but because of those that He great God Of Heaven be merciful unto us Jesus help us oh Lord hallelujah to obey your Commandments use us to thy honor and we thank thee for these encouraging words now let the Holy Spirit move through us and confirm these words in Jesus Christ's name [Music] amen have faith in God don't doubt be of a good courage amen praise the Lord You Lord so many years ago the Lord moved on that brother interceding for the prophet but interceding for all who would hear the word interceding for all who would hear the message amen the grace of God I've experienced those things over the years not late years but early years around this message oh yeah God moved during our Cottage meetings or during a meeting maybe in Bishop Falls the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost was in the going forth of the word and there are times when when the anointing of the Holy Ghost fell upon a brother or sister and the Lord spoke through prophecy amen it was absolutely tremendous amen as I've expressed to you and uh after I finished my first sermon as a young man that uh and again there was there might been 200 people there in the church and the Lord moved upon two brothers to bring forth a message yeah by the grace of God to confirm what I said amen and the Lord reminded them in as he the brother spoke under the anointing reminded them that it wasn't me it wasn't my word it was his it was the word of God it was the word of the Lord because many would think that it was just brother Gerald expressing his thoughts or his feelings but no and of course again knowing the the Brethren that God used I felt the confidence that it was God it wasn't just emotion no no it was the Lord it was the moving of the Holy Ghost among us as I said it was brother Burns that spoke in tongues and oh that was many many years ago and uh brother Bill agot yeah he was the one that interpreted that God used to interpret you know so it was absolutely amazing as I said I was to at the time I was standing at the back seat after I finished in the bullpit and uh I said my tears stained the floor because I just cried and cried and cried and I might have been I don't know maybe 20 years old and might have been only 19 I don't know know but as I said I was asked to uh get up and Minister uh until it got dark and brother brother car CER could show the films of the Prophet that was a long ways back because to show the films he had put on a large role like this and to go through it the oldfashioned things that they would show the films and so on of course then it went down to something smaller and even now to DVDs and so on but not it wasn't like that then but I tell you oh my you talk about the changing the atmosphere oh the entire church was filled with with a with in a sense it struck everybody so hard they almost all fell down yeah so I thank the Lord for that and I thank the Lord for this that after the prophet ministered the word that God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen it wasn't the prophet it was the word amen and then he went in to give testimony of what God had done for him and I have read that testimony and I've heard that testimony and other other messages and so on Amen and again it wasn't William brandom it was God yeah God was separating William brandom from all unbelief amen because they were taking advantage of brother brandham in his hunting and they wanted brother Bram to do this do this do that and uh but the Lord told him it wasn't right why because he was going out and he was going to kill animals for somebody else but they would give him money they would give him offerings they would give him their tithes and cash and say uh when you go out I want you to get me a deer I want you to get me this shoot me one and the Lord corrected him and said don't you do that no more no more amen so brother and he did say again right that he felt that he was going he was going to have to go soon that he was and it was yeah I don't know where that quote was but he he knew that he would be going off off the off the scene amen he was God's prophet and that God I tell he had the first pole second pole and God told him to stop using it and he was approaching the third pole the revelation of the word and after after God was finished with the opening of the word the mystery of God brother Brown knew that he was about to be taken off the scene because he no doubt he felt that the presence of God the anointing of God he wasn't experiencing like he used to under the first second and even the third pole but he knew he knew then oh yeah because it's it's in another message somewhere where he he said he felt as if everything was gone everything was you know it was just a dead thump there was no no Revival no no emotion no no feeling nothing and he felt it's it's over with now so he he said he would be going off the scene soon and of course this was just in jul January 64 and it was in uh December 65 that the Lord took him home and he knew he had to go I pray that we'll have that Assurance of the resurrection and Rapture as he did of him going as I said if he stayed maybe he would have just started to Rapture and went on oh yeah because of the faith that he had and so on so God took him off the scene amen amen so I pray the grace of God to help us brother and believe that not just brother Gerald because of his age but I pray that the rest of us here the Believers here across the island that Lord Brother that there were we're going to go off the scene Amen in Resurrection and rapturing glory for the glory of God well brother something got to happen something's going to happen but I pray Grace that we're not going to miss it and again remember remember again a warning that the prophet gave us concerning the Rapture and he said there will be a generation and there will be those that will rise up and say I thought there was to be a Rapture because they'll see certain things being fulfilled prophecies coming to pass this is happening thus sayeth the Lord is the Bible said this the Bible said that and it happened and there's going to be some here that'll that'll realize that yes I know that's the word and this is absolutely amazing that there's so much has come to pass and that God has fulfilled so many prophecies but where is the rapture and the prophet of God said it's going to strike them in their thoughts and say it's already happened and you didn't know it Grace brother sister that we're not going to miss it Grace that we're not going to miss the Revelation and the reality of the Rapture God help us brother yeah that's God that's God God is allowing this God's allowing that because it's the end it's the end and he's going to make an End of All Things where's the Rapture Lord I pray Grace that we're not here to hear that it's already happened and you didn't know it if there's anybody knows it it's the bride of Christ oh Grace Grace Grace see listen the bridegroom when he came and he was near he was nearing the the Final Phase of his ministry in the flesh he had three poles too right and so when he was nearing the final end of his ministry in the flesh he knew this is going to happen this going to happen and Peter stood up and pet no no no we don't want you to go down to Jerusalem they're not going to let this happen to you and he said get the behind me Satan it was Satan using Peter amen so brother let's listen to God not The Devil he's there to say yth God said oh yeah he's going to quote the word yeath God said yeath the prophet said but I say unto you oh no in a sense he it'll be like oh he's making the Revelation greater H he did to Eve because he said You shall be as Gods knowing good and evil if you do this if you'll do this if you'll do this brother sister let not the devil deceive you don't let the devil change this word or the Revelation let's let it let God keep it in our hearts God in Simplicity amen praise the Lord oh this this no no God sent the prophet preached the word and again you know I know I've mentioned a number of times lately that why did God do this why did God do that and so on and the power of God let us know why he see God did this this and this he said to give us rapturing Faith yeah so brother I pray Grace help us to realize that we're at the end it's finished and the next thing that God's going to do there be no prophit only to the Jews I pray we're not going to get mixed up and it's going to the Jews because he's why the prophet has come to the Gentiles it's done it's finished I tell you there's not going to be another Prophet come on the scene to Gentiles not by any means no no because I'll tell you the Judgment the only thing I sense in in the atmosphere all around everywhere is Judgment that's all I feel whereas I know for many years around the message that I sense the power of God the anointing of God oh my the love of God you you're going to a brother or sister's home and oh the atmosphere was so different and it's different now but instead of life it's death oh yeah it's Happ it's everywhere because as I said sometimes out there on the street was the power of God the anointing of God As I said one time a certain clergy was walking down a street and he met somebody that that I don't know if they went to his church or not but they wanted prayer oh I got to come and get get you to pray for me oh and he because he had a need so what did what happened there was others there that looked out their windows in their houses and looked oh what's he doing oh he went over to the brother and he and he laid his hands on him right on the street in public and he started to pray and pray and pray for yeah because that anointing was was everywhere it was in the church out of the the church it was in in your home out of your home no matter where you went the anointing was there yeah and and praise the Lord oh yeah but now no matter where you going now you got to make the Assurance of the anointing in you because it's not going any further it's going to come down in you amen and to give you the faith that that God wants you to have in these last days CU I tell you the at atmosphere is gone it's not like it used to be so that's why again the prophet of God said that he doubt if there be be a dozen Come Out of Africa even so oh he said there's going to be so few so few he started with you know maybe 1,000 1100 whatever down to a few hundred a few hundred 500 300 and then finally he said he might find a dozen God help us to love the Lord and I tell you if you love God you'll manifest it to to to your brothers and sisters in Christ oh yeah you you you'll be the love of God they want the love of God they see it in you oh yeah you got that anointing you got that life on the in your heart in your soul amen praise the Lord I pray Grace Lord help us it's not out there it's not in it's not in the in the atmosphere in the church or in the atmosphere of the world there no but it's in the bride yes and that's going to Rapture the bride she's gone God help us amen bear with me uh brother Brandon mentioned those Brothers there the Martin Brothers Well I met the Martin brothers and uh brother Earl Martin I witnessed his ministry in Bishop Falls he he was he came to Bishop Falls to fellowship with us him and another brother and think might have been brother Lonnie Jenkins I'm not sure but was brother I remember Lonnie Jenkins ministered in Bishop Falls he ministered in bun and a number of other places around newf land and of course he's gone on now to be with the Lord he's waiting on us amen so and I think brother Lonnie Jin might have been the other brother that came with our brother Earl Martin yeah and our brother Earl ministered to us so we we thank the Lord for our brother's Ministry amen but brother I just want to highlight too that what the prophet preached was God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief you it wasn't William brandham it's not me it's not the preacher it's not brother Jonathan no it's God's word we're reminding you of what the word said it is written thus sayeth the Lord amen so it wasn't William bandam calling for separation no it was God God God brought William branon to a total separation from unbelief now he's going to bring you and me to that total separation from unbelief he's got to bring us to that for the Rapture amen for the resurrection because as the Resurrection the power and the anointing and the spirit of the Resurrection was in the bridegroom he said I am the resurrection but it's also in the bride and the dead in that's why the dead in Christ are waiting on us to really have faith faith faith not just coold formal you know denominational Spirit Believers no no no we're Holy Ghost Believers amen and we have amen what God is doing we have that anointing in our hearts and our souls amen or there just very little of it out there in the world but it's it's here in in in a little church here a little church somewhere else and so on and again and many preachers they felt offended sometimes because brother brandom would he would forsake going out and preaching to 3,000 and he would he would go to a a cottage meeting and he said and preach maybe to a couple of dozen people yes he said because that's where God can deal with us he said in a cottage meeting God can deal with us in a small building it's just a few people here and a few people there amen but yeah but they think oh well if it's God God will bless us and God will add to the church god'll add to the church well I tell you this when Jesus spoke the truth the the disciples many disciples walked away from him and at one time he made a statement there and they never got the revelation of it and 70 disciples said who can believe this and they walked away and they went with him no more Amen brother the closer we get to the end and the and the seriousness of the message amen I I know there's going to be fewer and fewer True Believers they're going to be denominational Believers believe this message because they have a denominational Spirit yeah but there's going to be a few that'll be bride and they'll have no denominational Spirit they'll have the resurrection Spirit and the rapturing spirit God help us stay with what God is doing amen and what's he doing he's going to he's going to make bring to pass what this word is ordained to do the resurrection and the Rapture oh we want God this God that he's already done all of that now if you look into the word what he wants to do now is is to is to resurrect those that are dead in Christ amen and those that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air God help us to believe Amen in the me in the message itself again to remind you of something he said he said in the Bible First John or St John Rather the first chapter chapter he said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word is made flesh in the bride are you the word in flesh amen if you are you're going to have the spirit that Jesus had you'll have the anointing that Jesus had amen and it says he is the same yesterday today and forever are you like Jesus Jesus is your attitude like Jesus attitude is your spirit like Jesus Spirit the life you live is that the life that Jesus lived is it Christ in you like the Bible says it's not me that lives it's Christ that liveth in me amen so are you living that life like Jesus would live it I tell you the closer you get to the change the more and more you're going to be like Jesus amen this but it's a challenge because there's a lot not because why they haven't surrendered and they haven't experienced the total separation that God wants oh yeah because why because you're going to be more subject to their flesh and that old nature and less and less subject to the spirit of God God help us he said sin is unbelief there was no unbelief found in him nowhere when he was here on Earth he said who can condemn me of sin sin is unbelief he couldn't condemn Jesus of unbelief and brother there's going to be a bride that you can't condemn them of unbelief because they believe God Amen that's right praise the Lord oh yeah anybody that believes God is going to be the bride amen you're going to have that Faith to take us out of time and into eternity amen so they can't condemn you of unbelief you might be guilty of this guilty of that physically you know but no they say you did this you did that oh yeah but I believe God and he's taking me on to Perfection absolute complete deliverance amen amen amen if I haven't done just what was prophesied for this age if I haven't met the requirements of what Messiah is supposed to do then don't believe me and he said this is what Jesus was saying and Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me does the scripture testify of you the life you live your spirit your attitude your motives and objectives amen he said Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and it's always a connection with the spoken word of God God's Pro promise for the day and when it comes it's so unusual till people can hardly grasp it and that's true that the bride is being made ready for the Rapture separating from the world the things of the world more and more and more but the world doesn't recognize what God is doing in you they don't know they you're just odd you're just different yeah but we're getting out of time into eternity and he says it's so unusual till people can hardly grasp it because we're so sowed to forms and ideas of our own and he said that it's hard for us to grasp what is the truth God help us that we believe the truth the word amen he said so is it today brothers or Brethren that the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promise word of this hour is so unusual good man stumble over it it's too unusual amen but when a man is born in the world he said for a Believer he becomes a Nazarite unto the Lord when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word amen God help us so are you in that anointing that you're separating yourself any experiences that you have in your daily life does anything strike you so that you got to stop it and lay it aside I'm not going to do that no more forgive me Lord just help me to go on oh yeah because I tell you the closer we're getting to the Rapture and the resurrection that that we're going to recognize more and more and more that is in the eyes of God is sin and we'll be praying Lord take it away from me amen see God look looks at your heart amen amen praise the Lord so he said he said so it is today Brethren the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promised word of this hour it's so unusual good man stumble over it's too unusual he said but when a man is born and he becomes a Nazarite and he he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word see again again total separation from unbelief a total separation and Jesus said I came and come to separate a man from his wife tear up a family and he that won't take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me and not worthy to be called mine are we would he consider you worthy yeah and he's he's highlighting here I think it's Luke 14 brother if there's anything oh I tell you maybe it's not the people out there in the world that he that the enemy will use you to weaken your faith but rather sometimes his family and friends and neighbors the enemy will use you in your relationship with them to weaken your faith amen God's grace he said a separation from anything everything from church from a community from a belief from family or anything that would stand between you and believing the entire word of God if your soul will not punctuate every promise for this hour with an amen there is something wrong somewhere you need a separation amen amen amen and he said it's a it's a separation and he said it's always the word requires total and complete separation ation and it does so are we totally separated unto the Lord we have to be totally separated to the Lord for the Rapture that's right amen he says separation has separated Isaac or Isaiah rather it separated Isaiah from the church World it separated Moses from the church World it separated Jesus from his Brethren and they did when Jesus went back to capernum they said those that were is Step Brothers we call it all said why don't you do some Miracles here why don't you do you do signs and wonders there there there why don't you do it here he said because of your unbelief yeah they didn't they didn't believe him amazing so Jesus separated from his Brethren and it separated the apostles from the church that was at that day and the Pharisees Sadducees great man holy man good man fine man humble man he said man that had the fruit of the spirit more so than what Jesus exercised in the eyes of God they they didn't consider Jesus to have all the fruit of the spirit because some of the things Jesus preached they felt was too hard and he was condemning this condemning that no he was speaking the truth amen Grace that we'll stand and stay with the word and he said I might not be able to understand all that's in here but I believe it it's God's word I want to separate myself from anything that's contrary to the word amen I have tried to stand like that God help us to have faith like that we believe this Bible to be the truth I may not have faith enough to make all the promises come to pass but I believe it I believe the hour that we are living amen so I pray Grace that we believe the hour We're living grace amen I leave it there God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen so I pray Grace that we are praying amen constantly Lord bring us to that total separation so that there's nothing out there influencing influencing us Lord to bring down our relationship with you oh yeah that will make that make our relationship with Jesus less and less and less and less so Jesus got less and less influence in our lives Grace that we're going to separate from all the unbelief that the devil is trying to get to control us unbelief yeah oh well I believe the word I believe the but yeah but the devil you know God wants you to believe it this way the devil's going to try to get you to believe it that way as he did Eve in the garden oh yeah so God help me God help you God help us all to be more and more sincere Amen to give more and more of Our Lives to the control of the word the Holy Ghost again it's a challenge it's not me that lives not it's it's Jesus it's Christ that liveth in me oh that's amazing I pray Grace that you'll have that testimony tomorrow you'll have that testimony on Friday you'll have that testimony yes on Saturday Sunday every day 24 hours a day amen it's not me that lives it's Christ that liveth in Me by the grace of God Lord bless you let's stand reminder again to get the voice of God cared outside and and uh also remind you that the Lord willing on Sunday are and maybe on Wednesday our brother Jonathan klette will be ministering the word okay Sunday and Wednesday so the Lord bless you amen praise the name of the Lord let's sing uh 513 5133 come and dine Jesus has a table spread amen where

Bob God bless us so keep one another in prayer and keep looking up not looking out looking up Amen in your heart in your soul amen and keep living every day every hour what more you're looking for the Rapture you're looking for the resurrection Lord Lord I pray Grace Lord don't let me miss it amen Grace that I'm going to live in expectation of the revelation of the word for this hour all that God has done he did it to get us into rapturing Faith Amen to get us into what God is doing to get us off the Earth by the grace of God Amen praise the name of the Lord so God bless you and again remember
