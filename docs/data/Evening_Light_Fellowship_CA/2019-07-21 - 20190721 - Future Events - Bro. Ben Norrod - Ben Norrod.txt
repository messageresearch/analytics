lord thank you lord thank you lord how great you are how great you are Lord Jesus amen amen what a privilege it is to be in the house of the Lord today hey man we certainly appreciate the Lord appreciate God's mercy to us hey man you can be seated for a little bit if you'd like just want to say what a privilege it is to be gathered together in the house of the Lord certainly appreciate the way that the Holy Spirit is blessed in the meetings this weekend and we're certainly looking forward to what the Lord will have for us today what about my wife to come in for she will for just a moment and we're gonna sing just a little bit before we get into the preach and the word of the Lord and as you can tell I'm loaded for bear up here again I have not enough room to preach amen but I'm gonna try to make room I'll be out there with you in just a little bit hey man is a menace I like that III enjoy preachers that know how to stay still I don't mind them but sometimes I wonder how they do it they man just to me I just says somehow the Spirit of the Lord just gets so good I can't hold still and I'm thankful for the Lord Jesus this morning I'm thankful for His mercy to us and amen just extend our greetings saw the body this morning and trust you had a good night's sleep and and and thank you for your prayers I usually you know it's about a two and a half hour time difference for us and then coming from the field coming in and then usually takes a couple days to kind of get adjusted and all of that and so we're today's the first day I kind of felt normal a little bit as far as that goes now it's time to go home maybe that's not the way it goes so I appreciate your prayers and we appreciate the Lord allowing us to be able to come this way as always we'll say thank you to brother Gerald and amen the church body for allowing us to come by and for all of your kindness to us and your hospitality it means the world to Samantha and I and this is our last meeting before you go back to school and she gets a little bit of a break in August yeah tear that's for sure and she's my buddy we travel all over the place together and I like her being here to do this singing part you'd be surprised sometimes we go into a church and you know just me coming up and preaching it might be a blessing to some people some people you not so sure what it is you know whether you did good or not but you know I've found that a lot of times with the singing a lot of times you know if we take a couple songs sing a few songs something like that the Holy Spirit seems to kind of break up all that ground and then we've been able to dig right in there and do some preaching so I want to say this you know with us doing our singing part it's not that we don't enjoy everything that y'all do here we Sam and I we love to hear you folks saying I love to get in that back room and just it's like one big choir you know just this I just love to hear it and I love the music I love all the plan and everything like that and so we we we do this part as a blessing to you not to break up ground not to get you ready you're already ready hey man I I know that you were ready when we come in and so we we just like to do this for the glory of God and to be a blessing to people and sir trust that you'll continue praying for us in the ministry got a couple of things coming overseas not exactly sure how it's all going to work out the Lord spoke to me about all the turn of the year that there be about three places that I need to try to get to this year and I've been to one it was in Africa February that's where I met brother Isaac I was telling about last night and and as he sent his greetings to the church and met him I go to brother Sam sent a when I get to Ghana there if you know brother Sampson oh he's a fine brother and he's a wonderful host and we go into that place and he takes us all over the country a lot of times you'll preach many many services in a row this year we went and just in the convention and there were pastors that come in and I like that when they come in like that in one spot you can just preach it to them and then they take it out to those countries like that and it's a whole lot easier trying to make the travel you know so there's a couple places land before us where they are at right this point right now I couldn't tell you what it's going to be but I feel like somehow the Lord has got a couple spots for us coming in the mission field so I want you to be praying about that if you will for our behalf and for the saints of God that you know whatever it is the Lord have for us we want to be ready when the time comes to be able to go I kind of got an idea about where they may be but I'm just kind of waiting for things to fall in place because one thing's for sure when it comes to supporting missionary work or doing missionary work or being involved in missionary work one thing is you can't just jump into it you got to know who it is you're dealing with you know who it is you're talking to because you can have somebody invite you to come over and preach and they got one little Hut in the middle of nowhere then got Internet or running water and then like at but they got Facebook I'll never understand that how that works you know everybody got a cell phone they don't have electricity but they got a cell phone and so they make connections sometimes and you really got to know who it is that you're dealing with for you go into them places and so I like to make sure that my contacts are solid and the people that I'm working with and I'm dealing with have got Solid Works and have been established and what they're doing you know is something for the kingdom of God and not just to bring somebody over they kindly attach themself to your name and it might make them look like they're credible when they're really not so there's a lot involved and then on top of that you get to bugs and the waters and all those other kind of things and the foods that you got to deal with so you be in prayer force if you will as we ask you every year always keep us in prayer and of course our ministry as we go around the country and North America and I somebody said to me the other day they said you're Canadian aren't you I said I spend enough time in Canada I probably ought to be here hey man I preached a lot in Canada so we got a meeting coming in Ottawa here just a little while then back into Toronto and the different places in the provinces and so we just covet your prayers because you know I go 365 days a year 16 years full time like this on the road nearly 300 days out of the year as I told you the other night you know we've gone almost 2,000 miles in just the last couple weeks traveling and preaching different places and all of that and so this is not only our livelihood but this is our life this is what we do for the kingdom of God and somebody asked me how in the world do you do it I said because there's people everywhere I ask them pray pray pray pray pray and I know that's the reason we're able to make it through it and then one little tiny favor I'd like to ask of you we all help me pray I can get through this doctorate stuff this doctoral thing I've been in a battle with it and I just got over a major major major hurdle but the fight ain't over yet will you just pray the Lord help me get through this hey man I appreciate it I as I told you the Lord led me to do it when I first finished my first degree back in 2010 I said to the Lord well you wanted me to do this now what amen and he come to me again and he said keep going so I did I finished my master's degree in 2012 and then I said okay you want me to do this now what he said keep going so here we are seven years after that and you know I just don't know what all it means somebody asked me what am I gonna do with it I said I have absolutely no idea all I know is the Lord said do it so that's what I'm doing I'm just being obedient amen and I don't know maybe it's just because I needed to be smarter I don't know you know I ain't got no idea but anyhow we're just gonna trust the Lord in them things and so I just want you to know how much I love you how much I appreciate you how much we were looking forward to getting back here and by the way Paul hey good for you boy I hear there's a baby on the way that ride oh I'm so proud well god bless you for that I know I know I've been noticing you you've been in the back side you you're in that that struggle you know expect to be back slid for about the first three years that's just the way that goes a mana I laugh and Samantha and I first had Elizabeth you know and and and it was always in and out with the baby and they're crying and they're this thing and that thing you know and she said I didn't get nothing out of church I said I remember all those nights I just wish we had a baby I said well here it is you can't have it you can't have your cake and eat it too amen so but anyhow we'd be praying for you that the Lord give you a nice delivery and amen bring the child to birth and hey man we want to see all of our kids come up receive the Holy Ghost one day don't Lee that's what we want and so we love you god bless you just want to take a few moments just to get some of those things in and we're gonna sing a little bit and then get right

patience last night allow me to hold you long I I told my wife last night I said well I said I hope that you know wasn't too lengthy and I said well you know you you went you went quite a long time as far as time goes she said but it didn't hurt nothin we enjoyed it a madhouse I said well I appreciate that you know I I was a little concerned I I don't like to hold too terribly long when I preach but you know sometimes in these meetings like this it's kind of a special occasion and I I hate to rush it and try to cut it off and chop it out and I thought after everything you folks did get us here right I hate to just cut it short yeah I certainly appreciate the Lord let's start this morning in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 I want to speak to you this morning on future events future events amen and by the help of the Lord I want to try to cover everything that is laying for us in the future is the body of Christ a man I believe we got a great future ahead of us don't you a man I got several places I want to look at in the Bible so make sure you keep your Bible real close to you and you that take notes and I've noticed you've been marking things down which i think is lovely I like to see that amen and I'm gonna give you a lot of scriptures to write down this morning won't be able to read everything of course because if I did that we would be here a half the day and and I know we got chicken at mark so every what's coming on in a little bit and I don't want people to be too tired where they can't fellowship either that's part of the weekend and we're gonna get down there and do some eatin and playing and pickin and grinnin as we say down south and and we enjoy that part as well and and sure look forward to the fellowship this afternoon haven't had too much fellowship with you folks this weekend as you know I just been trying to go back and forth but I look forward to getting a chance to talk with you a little while all right 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 now trust you're not no hurry this morning that you're just ready to settle into the Word of God a man for sessile ins 4:15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now notice the order the resurrection then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you notice in verse 17 that the clouds is the same reference as it was in the book of Acts when Jesus is ascending in acts 1 a cloud grabs him and receives the amount of his side so you notice when the Bible said we will be caught together with them notice it was being caught in the clouds or in the cloud is where we'll be caught together so there'll be a spiritual parallel of that that will take place with the coming of the white wig 1 the great authority Jesus Christ in the form of the cloud we will be caught up in that revelation and then that revelation will catch all of us Paul and everybody up into the clouds eventually down the road now that is the rapture as brother brems says here in things that are to be he said now we know there's going to be a rapture that is in the future to be lets pray over the Word of God Lord Jesus we thank you this morning for the opportunity Lord to come into your house father we feel sobered by the things that you've done for us and our hearts are just mellowed over Lord knowing that you are God and you are in control of everything we love you this morning and we commit the service now both speaker listener to the hands of the Lord Jesus and we pray that your spirit will come down this morning that you we'll take your word and you will break it down for us this morning and I trust Lord that you'll give us revelation and understanding and that you'll allow me to get out of the way Lord that I can be used of you bless the people now open their hearts that they might receive and give us strength and the ability Lord to dive into this this morning that you can just come now and take your word and minister to us the things you'd want us to hear and to know and we love you and we thank you for this weekend of services we thank you for the little revival that's going on here in st. John's Lord may you ever prosper this group Lord and just may they just continue to burgeon on and grow on and my I just come up into greater things and we just pray you'll bless the pastor and all the leaders and everyone around father plumb down to the little children may the Holy Spirit amen just bless each one of them amen brother Gerald and sister Betty and the Deacons trustees everybody God may the Holy Spirit now just bless us all as we thank you love you and appreciate you for all things in Jesus Christ's name a man and a man you all know your part you done missed it a man eyes all right now you may be seated that was that was that was all right too little shaky I'll let you make up for a little bit later a man a man I'm glad y'all like to laugh I'd be in trouble up here if you didn't hey man hey man now I want to just take for just a little while and I want to try to give you an outline of what the future is going to look like for us as the children of God one thing that we have to realize is that with the restoration of the message of the hour and with the restoration work at brother Branham did there is a belief among the Bride of Christ that all things would be restored to get us ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus but yet we know at the same time it is not only the coming of the Lord that we are under expectation for there are many future events that are laying ahead of us as the children of God that if we could kind of tap into the understanding of it I believe that it would maybe excite our hope and excite our expectation of what lays beyond this life today because if you're anything like me I don't like to look at things just as they are today but when I'd like to do something a project everyone I'm trying to tackle I like to see everything that lays out ahead of me that's what excites me when I see the goals and I see how it's going to help somebody or how it's gonna benefit down the road that's the motivation that I have to keep going with whether we'll thing I try to put my mind to and I believe spiritually it's the same way I believe it's a child of God I believe that when we look into the Word of God and we see what is laying ahead of us that it kindly gets our mind as it were this morning off of today and off of the events around us and life as we know it and it helps us to kind of shut away and get ourself in a position where that we can have a hope and an expectancy for what lays ahead of us because one thing is evidently clear to every Bible reader if you believe the Bible and you believe what's to happen in this last day and what's been spoken in this last day one thing is abundantly clear and transparent to every child of God and that is that life as we know it today this is not the end of what we had Noah's Christian is is Christian people Christianity and the life we live today this is not the end of it there is so much more laying ahead of us as the children of God that if we could just kind of sink our teeth into that revelation we would understand that this is only a blip on the radar as they say this is only a little spot in time that a little parenthesis if you will in time that we were just going to experience here for maybe 30 or 40 or 90 years or ever how long the Lord lets us live and then after all of this is wrapped up there's going to be tens of millions of millions of years beyond us of this part of this little parenthesis of life us and that 10 millions of millions of years is going to be so much more vast and so much greater than what we're living here today I mean when you think about it what is a 40 year old lifetime or an 80 year old lifetime compared to the first 10,000 years it will spin what is a 90 year old lifetime compared to the thousand-year millennium that lays ahead of us so what I believe it does brother Marcus I believe it gives us an expectancy and a hope for the things that lays out ahead of us now I want to just lay out for you the future events in the order of how they're supposed to occur now you that are writing things down this is a good time to ride so that you can study this later first of all we know that there's got to be a couple things happen in the lady of sin Church age and we know that in the late eocene church age that first of all God has to send elijah the prophet that's Malachi for then when God sends Elijah he has two missions that is to restore all of the truths that was hid down through the Bible or the lost down through the Bible down through the church ages and I'll restore all of those mysteries and things that Paul talked about and then take those mysteries that have been hidden and revealed them to the elect of the last day now when it comes to salvation I'll just put this in real quickly a lot of people seem to think that in order to be saved you got to come to the message that ain't true to be saved you have to know Jesus Christ and him crucified anybody could be saved but when you're talking about rapturing faith that's an entirely different ballgame as the expression goes then rapturing and then then then salvation alone rapturing grace rapturing faith can only occur in this message the message wasn't sent to save us necessarily Jesus done that over 2,000 years ago on Calvary and us accepting that atonement brings us into salvation and brings us into the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ but the message was sent to positionally place us and get our garments washed and get us clean so that we can get ready for the met for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for the wrapped string of the church so Malachi 4's got to come first in order to restore what was lost down to the church ages to reveal those hidden things in the Book of Revelations that's what the sounding of the seven thunders was that's what the opening of the seventh seal was that's what the blue sing of the seals inclusive was all of those things was to reveal the hidden parts in the book of Revelation those things that nobody knew not ascribed not a scholar and on a prophet not nobody the lamb alone held the secret that was in that book of Revelation so then after the message comes then there's a people that's going to be made ready by that message for the rapture and the resurrection you remember last year when I preached to you here about the purpose of the mighty angel a member hai told you that without us without us Paul and the rest of would lay in the ground because Paul's message could not produce rapturing faith Paul had everything that God wanted him to have in that first church age he laid the foundation for everything that we would ever believe as Christians but without the loosing of the seven seals without the revealing of the book of Revelation there was no rapturing faith for the church to take a body change everybody understand that say hey man all right without that message they could not complete it just like in the capstone when the capstone was established at faith Paul said that no other foundation can be laid then that which was laid which was Christ Jesus now when you look at the photo one brother brand puts in there's a little spot right underneath faith there that's the foundation of Jesus Christ then Paul said in Corinthians he said I as a wise masterbuilder I have built upon that foundation he said with Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone all of these ages as they come up down through 2,000 years all of these ages are completely incomplete absolutely incomplete altogether without this capstone right here so the capstone not only completes this whole thing but brings it in to come into perfection and brings it into maturity where everything that Paul and Wesley and Luther and all the rest of them preached a man would come to its fullness in other words Martin Luther preached justification the just shall live by faith but when the capstone come it revealed to us that justification was not only being forgiven for your past sins Amen hang on they hand the horses out to gate you're almost left in the saddle but hang on a man and you realize that justification was not only just being forgiven of your past sins but to be justified men in this hour that you were forgiven as though it never took place in the beginning Amen somebody say man and then all of this comes into its perfection way the capstone was a perfect pyramid within itself Jesus Christ lived a perfect life for thirty three and a half years they took him to Pilate Hall as it was the sacrifice they examined the sacrifice for four days after four days that there was no blemish then they would sacrifice it for the sins of Israel Jesus for four Corday's was in pilots Hall they found no fault in the Lamb of God hallelujah I still find no fault in him amen he's still the sentence perfect son of God amen to get to atone for our sins to intercede for our sins so he is the perfect capstone if that capstone cannot sit on the rest of this body Paul and the rest of them would lay in the ground there's no rapturing faith in their message it puts them in the body of Christ but it cannot put them in the rapture the resurrection will be called after the message has been completed and has been finished remember that was the mystery at the ministry rather of the mystery of the seven things remember revelation 10 7 when he shall begin to sound the mystery shall be what finished or completed as he's builded all the way up through these ages the Ministry of William Branham wants to finish everything that Paul and the rest of them at left loose ends on oh it's a plane of your child you could see it if you want to see it amen now we've made this so mysterious that people just don't understand what's laying ahead of us quite simply the message has prepared us for what Jesus Christ expects out of our life how do I know how to worship how do I know how to live how do I know what kind of a Godhead he is or what kind of power Authority all I got to do is press play and obey I'll agree with them there hey hey hey man all I got to do is read the message of the hour and out of that message the Holy Spirit will interpret his word to my heart to let me know what things are pleasing what things aren't pleasing as the ministry preaches the gospel the ministry will dig into that truth and they'll tell me things like for example you may not have known if you're riding down the road and somebody's got their brights on and you flash them flashing flashing brother branham called that Pentecostal cousin amen aren't you glad you come to church this morning amen stay with me a little bit amen so the Future event that lays before the body of Christ as we read Paul in first essence for here he said we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto that doesn't mean it's here but we're moving unto that onto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder them which are asleep for the Lord shall do three things and prevent Ellison here in the rapture do a shout a voice and a trumpet and he does all three as he's descending now we realized that the the the dissension of the mighty angel in revelation 10:1 when the mighty angel comes down he's got a book open in his hand look at it in Revelation chapter 5 whenever the lamb is going to take this book the book is still closed but when it comes to the ministry of revelation 10 notice the book is open it's open and now it's time to reveal whatever was hidden in the contents of that book and where does he come to he's a mighty angel come since his foot on the earth foot on the sea takes that book hands it to the seventh angel the seventh angel breaks the mystery and then there's another ministry that follows that what was it the Prophet will now change his attraction to the prophecy which is you that was your cue to say amen and hallelujah glory to God a man and now revelation 10 8 is okay John now the mystery is broke you come now you take this book you eat this book you to be sweeten your mouth it'll be bitter in your belly but you'll prophesy again hallelujah amen and that's what's going on now the ministry of the bride a member of the Branham with the bride have a ministry said that's what's going on now apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors not everybody stand up read pushing a tape-recorder but preaching the gospel amen so the rapture is a combination of the message it is it is a gathering together of what the message has brought is that don't you understand brother sister whenever the devil uses individuals to try to discredit this message the devil knows what he's doing he knows that if he can rob you from the benefit of receiving the message in the right way he knows he is robbing from you rapturing faith and my Bible tells me the devil came to steal to kill and destroy amen any true godly servant of God even brother Branham knowing what kind of man that a ally might have been knowing what kind of men these other guys were but you never heard brother Branham destroying another ministry you never heard him running down another individual he would call him brother he would call them Christians when identifying the servants of God and I don't care who they are any website any preacher any individual that tears another one down he don't even have this first base of holy ghost teaching in his heart a man who don't even know what he's talking about because any true servant of God will never do another servant of God that way Amen there's a difference in calling out the devil and then trying to destroy somebody's influence to me it goes to show that the spirit behind a lot of this stuff when people start tearing things down like turn preachers down and tear and brother branham down and all the thing about the bridge and the thing about the cloud and all these other things like that to me it goes to show that there's an evil spirit somewhere amen because if you could follow around some of the lives of these critics and you could tape-record 1,100 times they had set out and down and how to talk with somebody I imagine you could nitpick them about things to a man but I'll say it like a friend of mine said it locked me in a room with some devil possessed person locked them in a room let's see who comes out at the end of the day Amen that's exactly right hey man you got to know where you're standing in the last day so the message gave us position on authority did you hear that the message gave us positional Authority what we need to understand is that salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is only the first baby steps in being what you're supposed to be in Christ we've got to grow up into all things we've got to come up into greater things greater revelations greater than ik how does it come it comes by suffering it comes by hardships it comes by trials it comes by death to self delft to this death to that amen until that's something that Christ be formed inside of you and then all of these characteristics all of these qualities have got to be in the elect of God before we go out of here because this is adoption time Paul spoke of that he said this is the hour the manifestation of the sons of God so after the message comes the book of Revelation is revealed it's opened up to us we can look at this revelation in this book here we can open up any chapter there and we can say I get it I understand it no other age could say what we can say about the book of Revelation I mean if you took Paul himself inside him down and talked to him about it he couldn't have understood it because it wasn't revealed to Baal but you and I have the revelation of what lays in the book of Revelation we do you say well I don't understand it all but daddy because you can't then ain't because it ain't laying in there for you to understand all you got to do is start reading the message it's already been interpreted for us so we don't even have to do the hard part we just got to read a man just read the book as he said it and then let the Holy Spirit interpret it to us from what the prophets had a meant so here we have a lion show now the message comes open now we have the sons of God daughters of God taking the word becoming the book sweeten your mouth bidding your belly bit bitter in your belly and now they're manifesting in adoption placing positional Authority somebody asked me the other day he said well he said you know the message he anybody can get saved you said a Baptist can have the Holy Ghost I said you're wrong I said you're talking about being born again as Peter said by incorruptible seed I said tell me how a Baptist can have incorruptible seed doctrine tell me how any organization can produce incorruptible seed whenever they mix the Word of God with their own ideas they change the Godhead to suit them they change membership to suit them they interpret baptism in any way they want and so tell me how that can produce the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't say that God can't move on them and God can't deal with them but it's just like when the angel would stir the waters at Bethesda as long as the angel was in those waters there was virtue in those waters Amen Luther got in the water and stirred it up and there was virtue in his message but when the angel left Luther's message there was no virtue in Luther's message when the life is he told to seed not err at the show moved on to Wesley's day moved on to Pentecost as long as the angel of the age was standing in the water stirring the water there was life in those waters but when the mighty angel comes out he pronounces by raising his hand to heaven and swearing by him that lived ever and ever that these denominational ages has run out you can no longer be a part of an organization and make the rapture the resurrection that can't happen amen and I don't care if that denominations in a message denomination I'm a man you've got to be in the revelation for the hour you say well what is a revelation I'm glad you asked me I'm gonna tell you Christ is a mystery of God revealed but the bride is the mystery of Jesus Christ revealed it's you it's you you are that revelation the whole purpose of all of this aridity last night was for God to share eternal life with you you are the mystery of every bit of this I mean interpreted how you ever want to interpret it call it a white horse call it a seven sealed call it a thunder at the end of the day it all spells out 1 subtitle y-o-u every bit of it comes back down to God did every bit of this for you amen that's what the rapture the message is all about God is not coming to rapture a book or a tape library or an mp3 player he's coming come on he's coming to rapture individuals the rapture is not an event the rapture is a body hey man don't don't let this shake you down but I'm already in it how can you say that would that bald spot on the back of your head I'm not talking about my body my body will catch up after a while but my soul has already entered into heavenly places I have already been ended up in the New Jerusalem I'm already moving in heavenly things the revelation has caught me up just like with Elijah and Elijah if Elijah would have never saw Elijah caught up he would have never got the mantle you've got to see the same thing you've got to see brother Branham caught up into the third pool or the revelation of the hour or when these denominational things have run out you've got to see that caught up to get another the second anointing that comes with this message if you want to be Messiah 'it's you got to leave first and second pool is a holiday man out a nanny well the first and second pool was good for its time as long as the angel was stirring the water it was good for its time but you can't be a first and second pool Christian to make the rapture you've got to be in the revelation for this day and that was all revealed in them seven seals you cannot have positional Authority as long as what you are has to depend on a prophet telling you what you ate for breakfast hey man I'm just gonna say two now hey man you can't have positional Authority if it takes a man to lay his hand on you to discern from his hand what's going on with your life you've got to leave first in second pool you got to leave all of that charismatic and all that neo-pentecostal and all of that worldly updated type stuff and you've got to enter away from all of that system and you've got to come to the message of the hour which is the third pole of this day amen a lot of these people that was around brother Branham they all call him a prophet I'm sure he was a prophet then all of a sudden he the seals come open and they say well that's where he got off to us that's where he was getting on hey man that was the best part of the message for us look at that brother BAM changed as his language he starts saying Jean C to God again and again and again and again and again start something out all these different things you know why he was no longer preaching to the Full Gospel businessman in the Pentecostal Methodist and to badness and having healing revivals he was now preaching the Shekinah glory food oh how they lujah to God he was revealing to us the things that had been hidden in God's mind since the foundation the world you remember we say Christ is the mystery he said God had a secret in the back part of his mind and he was something he wanted to reveal well now the back part has become the forward part hey man we're not no longer reading in the back part of it we're not reading in the back side of the book where the seal was that it's been broke now we're seeing the revelation clearly so here's your order future events Elijah's got to come that's first thing a lot just got to restore life just got to reveal the mystery has got to come open the sons of God have got to receive the word they've got to receive the revelation which gets them ready for the rapture gets them ready for the resurrection as we come to maturity as the sons of God come into their adoption once the capstone sets down on your life once you are a mature manifested Son of God daughter of God and the capstone sets on you your life your influence will be like a great magnet to them in the resurrection and your life here will dovetail with Jesus Christ up there and when the shout or the message or the all of that is completed here on earth then the voice of the resurrection will speak right out of the electorate of God right out of Jesus Christ and your life will call for the resurrection you won't even have to speak it you won't even have to say time for the resurrection your own life will testify to God she's ready everybody's waiting on that moment where God hollers down okay you're ready now hey listen when you show up you ain't nobody got to say a word about it it's just like when you become a Christian you don't have to tell nobody you're a Christian they automatically notice something's different about you come on somebody and then when this bride is ready to go out of here God don't have to call out of heaven hear ye hear ye all ye people of Earth the bride is now ready her life will testify but she's ready to call ready to get out of here and like a magnet her power of influence will draw the rest of him right out of the ground and pull him right up for the resurrection amen notice the order of the Resurrection God comes first he takes those out of that sixth dimension those theophany bodies will then come down to earth to pick up glorified bodies the other they said there they'll appear on the earth it might be just be for a few moments of time but like my brother Carol used to say this a lot but as mom was long red hairy just a redheaded girl and he said I might be going out to the mailbox he said there mama would be standing here and he said I'll know right then it's time to go as brother and said your loved ones will appear to you first you might be standing in the mirror all of a sudden you know you're looking at that head you don't come out Chad we two fellas in the same boy anyway hallelujah and and all of a sudden you blink your eyes like that remembers a moment in the twinkling of an eye and you're looking at right you blink your eye like that next thing you got a full head of hair and you're about 18 to 21 years old glory Oh hallelujah amen you'll know the change is on you'll know it's time to get out of here now remember the order of future events is that when the bride goes up now Satan must come down all right I want you to catch this if you want to write this down we're gonna look at the Tribulation Period which is the next part of this and I want you to notice there are two witnesses Revelation chapter 11 3 4 and 5 there's three verses in that revelation I want you to understand that's a three and a half year time period I'm assumed brother Jared believes that here other brothers they believe seven years but I read him in the turn the question is if a guy wrote me the other day and he said I was privileged he said to you know to understand that it's seven years left he said after wait brother Branham tated I thought they ain't never read question answers on the seals because when they asked him they said on Daniel tape did you mean to say seven years he said no no no no no no no that's what I've been saying for the last ten years trying to explain to people when I preach this it's not seven years can they say oh yes it is I said no no no no no no no I'm just saying what he said a man a man that's three and a half years because remember Daniels 70th week is the last week of prophecy each day represents a year so that week would be seven years and that seven years remember the sacrifice or Messiah was cut off exactly right in the middle of the week it's like God had a great stopwatch like this and it was running time and he come to the 69th week he got right down through the half of that and he hit his stopwatch like that and the time of the Jews had stopped all of that prophecy to Israel as a nation had stopped remember a Jew can get saved today if they're considered a Gentile body you can be Jewish they can be absolutely Jew born but that doesn't mean we're not talking about the 144,000 because remember Israel is saved as a nation a man that's just scripture amen they're not saved as individual they're saved as a nation don't forget the first Gentile body that was saved and received the Holy Ghost was a hundred and twenty Jews in the upper room but they were not saved as a nation a man they were saved as individuals amen are you with me Amen him from a hundred and twenty Jews came three thousand more and now whether they're Arimathea whether they're Greek whether I don't care what they are Amen what a nationality is there saved as an individual but when the bride goes up that ends now God is going to turn his attention over to 144,000 Jews Oh God let me look over the banister time on that revival strikes can you imagine 144,000 I'm shouting and praising the Lord and getting the Holy Ghost in one hour in one day and one time but y'all think you're loud noisy you they got noise they wait til you see that revival break wide open Amen when they're standing there than two prophets Moses and Elijah look at their ministries Elijah shut the heavens up that's what one of these witnesses does Moses you know and so forth like that brother Branham said that the sixth seal is the tribulation seal and he said Moses and Elijah will be the ones in that tribulation time you said there's three phases in that sixth seal now and all of this tribulation time when Moses and a lie just standing there they will have the power of the spoken word you say how is that possible because remember everything that laid in the grave all the way up to this time was waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God when the manifestation of the sons of God occur and the capstone sets down every one of us become to our maturity in Jesus Christ we'll be able to speak creation we'll be able to move trees around move mountains around walk on the water change dimensions travel like a thought nothing will be impossible to use a child of God amen and when Moses and Elijah are sent back to this earth ever how they come amen that same anointing that same revelation that same Authority that same power of God will transfer to us and it will move right over on the I mean they'll have the same power that we've got here on the earth amen them homosexuals that are living on the earth at the time they'll speak hail balls out of the heavens don't kid yourself when God said stone on the head until dead that was his belief in gay rights you have a right to be stoned to death that's the way God looks at gay rights hey man that's Bible a man who said a man that lays with a man as he would with a woman and vice versa he said they ought to be stoned without mercy under two or three witnesses Amen God will hold that word true you ain't changed his word I'm not preaching hate speech I know them the cameras on I'm not trying to bash against homosexuals I'm trying to say you better get saved before God's judgment has something to say about it amen that's exactly right they'll call hail balls that are a hundred pounds of peace and they'll stone him like they did Sodom and Gomorrah like they did in the Old Testament and if they try to hurt one of them prophets Holy Ghost fire remember fire proceeds out of their mouth that's Holy Ghost fire will precede spoken word will proceed out of their mouth and anyone that tries to did to to molest them during that three and a half years amen they'll speak the word and they'll turn the thing around it'll be such a horrible time that the people will cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them the caves and things they'll hide in caves trying to escape the judgment of God some I said well I'll just I'll stock up on water and rations and all these kind of things and I'll go hide in a cave somewhere another I said yeah you could do all of that physically you might be alright for a few days I said but what are you going to do whenever the grace of God releases off of humanity and your imagination and your mind is released and loose any old devil that wants to torment you any old thing that wants to plague you the blood ring around this earth to keep it away brother the Bloods didn't demand taking officer she's called the bride a man at that hour that three and a half year tribulation Satan will sit out there in that Vatican City he'll thrown himself in the heart of that Pope and they'll worship this man like he's God sitting in the temple of God showing himself that He is God at that time he will control the world's commerce he'll control politics he'll control everything else and guess who he is he's an American you say how do you believe that acts of the Holy Spirit 1954 brother BAM said remember according to prophecy this revelation 13:11 remember revelation 13:1 the first Pope came out of the waters which was the multitude and thickness of people and nations and so forth but when revelation 13:11 when the Beast raises up he comes out of the earth which brother branham identified as the United States I can't help it it's just what he said friends a man and you imagine how is that going to work we'll usually understand that it's not Canada it's not Mexico it's not Trinidad it's not Australia not a - nations were prophesied to be an image unto the Beast but the Bible said brother Branham said that the United States would becoming the image under the beast and speak with all the same power where do you think she gets her power her Pope is sitting over there and wrongness got all the power to back her all he has to do is holler from Vatican City and tell us Americans what we're supposed to do and how we're supposed to do it and shut down churches and shut down this and open up that and pull this thing and that thing and you think we're going to defy the Pope he's got all of the money we're broke anyhow amen come on somebody a man and a stupid Americans God forgive me but a stupid Americans will sell out our mother if it meant getting out all you got to do is just look at the way they vote elections forget politics you want to see how presidents elected the United States you know what I'm talking about you Americans sitting in here they vote these guys based on whether or not they're gonna make them any money or not at the end of the day don't matter about their politics amen all they might carry on about abortion a few things like yet oh I've never voted a Democrat blah blah blah and all that kind of stuff like that at the end of the day the majority I mean the moral majority call the moral majority to me I call it the immoral majority amen but the majority of people the United States you know what they look for they look for the guy that's going to make their gas prices low and put money in their pockets at the end of the day that's what politics amounts to so when Mama comes over here to buy us out of our debt you think we're going to say no to that what are we gonna do all right a mess now or trillions and trillions of dollars and we want to live like kings instead I'll make it mommy looked down said I'll make you I got the pocketbook I'll pay you out of debt son and she'll sell her birthright out and when the moment she does she'll take the mark of the beast and you can't buy nor sell unless you got your name associated with that system out there and here's the sad part about it many of the little local churches little independent nondenominational type independent churches and so for like that to keep their doors open they'll just go along with the framework brother Bentham said they'll agree with the framework of it and said well well you know we don't have to agree with one another we'll leave you alone and you just leave us alone we'll go on serving God and brother BAM said when they do that they are selling out their birthright amen and even the foolish virgin he said in questions and answers will recognize that they've been trapped up into that system and when they get trapped up into it being the bride type hallelujah he said they'll come find out of there with everything they caught that's when they give their life and the Catholics will hunt him down and take their head from their shoulders kill him in the streets like dogs amen but God will give him white robes amen gotta wash them they men wash their robes because of the persecution because of the purging of it by this time the bride is already gone okay during this three and a half year time we're at the wedding supper hey man hallelujah we're enjoying heaven now members the type was in Genesis member 1 Joseph when Joseph is in the palace revealing himself to Benjamin remember his wife this is Joseph this is a Joseph yes Genesis 45 12 through 14 12 13 14 chapter 45 Genesis 45 12 to 14 when Joseph is revealing himself to his brethren remember his wife is in the palace when he's down at the other side there might have been the palace or in some kind of a room everywhere he was his wife is in the palace when he slips himself down and he makes himself known to Benjamin remember up to this time he had spoken to them through an interpreter he had spoken to him in another language Oh hallelujah but now it was time to reveal the unknown tongue amen didn't you say in mark chapter 16 you'll speak with new tongues amen and Benjamin or Israel 144,000 will receive the same revelation that you and I are enjoying this morning they will understand water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they will understand the oneness of the Godhead they will not look at Jesus Christ as being a second person of the Godhead they sure won't say what this guy said the other day that Jesus will never be God they'll look at him and say my Lord and my Savior amen my Lord and my god they'll understand that Jesus was on the second person but he was the person hey man he was car wrapped and skinned God wrapped in flesh they'll receive it they'll understand the whole revelation of where we are today and what positional Authority God has given them now remember while we're at the wedding supper now they're all making themself ready for the Battle of Armageddon alright there's two major battles and you can write this down the Battle of Armageddon and Gog and Magog it's real simple to remember the Battle of Armageddon takes place before the millennium Gog and Magog takes place after the millennium it's real simple it's real easy now when you take the Battle of Armageddon during that time remember the plagues out of Revelation will begin to fall okay got your pencils ready I'm gonna give you some Scripture these plagues all right Revelation chapter 9 and verse 20 now when these plagues begin to fall remember the reason the plagues are falling is because the mystery has already been broke all right remember he said every time a mystery would broke break rather he said that a thunder would sound he said a beast would ride out and start a war and so but he said when that mystery broke you said a plague would fall so down through each Church age there's been a plague fall upon each of these ages in the last day our plague is spiritual death that's why people can sit right in the church house and die no other age couldn't have been just like what it is today they can sit right here in the house of God and hear the word of God and hear everything's being preached all the way around and met and fall on deaf ears that we preach Friday night and die sitting right there in the church and brother if the blood of Jesus Christ is not applied to your soul you'll sit right in a message church and die because death don't discriminate so a plague falls at the opening of the mystery but remember when the plagues fall in the tribulation period it is because the cup of the iniquity of the amorite cement wood said about that he said that the cup had to be full before it could be poured out some people wonders I said it to you before when I was preaching here last year about Timothy there we said some men's sins go before and some to the judgment remember the message last year well that's the way this is all of these plagues God is waiting some I said to me the other day why does so-and-so get away with what they get away with I said because the cups got to be full so God allows things to keep filling until the cup of iniquity gets full well now as these church ages come to a close as the bride goes up and Satan comes down then the plague I'm not going to pour it out but I'm just going to simulate it aim at then the plagues all of the cup of everything is poured out in that tribulation period brethren I want to say to you sister I want to say to you don't be caught when this cup gets emptied out in that tribulation period because you think it's bad in this day and age imagine when an entire cup of years and generations of sins and iniquity and things that's gone on before God amen has poured out upon this lady you see in time imagine when an angry God looks at all of the homosexuality and all the adultery and all the murder and all the molesting and all the killing and the thieving and everything and all of that's been filled up with six billion people just in our generation upon the billions that God's had to contend with over 2,000 years over all of the history of these church ages imagine what that Tribulation is gonna look like when an angry god pours out the cup of his wrath on it Oh God hide me in the rock Lord don't let me be there amen hide me in that place that is higher than I Amen hide me in the cleft of the rock a man and then rock just hide on me Amen keep me safe from all of these plagues amen to Revelation chapter 9 verse 20 the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold silver and brass stone of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders of their sorceries or fornication nor of their thefts then God pours out all of these things upon these unbelievers do you realize a person's worshipping the devil many times they need a devil worshiper like we think a lot of times when we think of a devil worshiper we think of some guy with horns and a pitchfork you know I'm gonna say something to you and I hope this don't spook you a little bit but as a minister I study all kinds of things and I read the book of Satan I've read Satanism doctrine Satanism Church I'm gonna tell you what it is they simply believe in no devil they don't believe in no God you know what the theory and the real basis of Satanism is you are your own destiny you are your own creator you are your own maker you are the one that determines everything yes well brother if they don't sound like what we hear in the message of the hour in the last days what is it we hear and if it don't sound like you like Catholicism and Catholicism excuse me and all of that out there what's this satellite amen you're the one we worship you you've got the power you're the one that does it the prophets the only one that can it ain't nothing but just the devil in another form amen any time anybody puts any emphasis upon flesh in any way whatsoever they're just as much a devil worshippers these guys out there have been black goatees a man we don't emphasize flesh we emphasize Christ right because all flesh has come short of the glory of God all of us as none of us can stand up here and say oh you know and you that spooky little feeling oh you the Church of Satan the Church of Satan that don't scare me you know what scares me some of these guys walk around brother Browns books under their arms and brother brems said brother Brendan said brother Brent that's more spooky to me than somebody with a bald head and a goatee amen because the devil don't hide in the dark things like we think he does the devil hides in religion a man as for Satan dwells eiders and religious things remember Satan is the worship person of today and he is worshipped through religion amen look at him in God to this evil age what he's talking about that he said he is the worship Percy's that worshiped by millions and billions of people on this earth today he not talking about a bunch of people out there cutting the CAF's from throat or or taking a goat horns and taking a little mouse tail and putting it in a cauldron boil bull trouble in trouble everything he talking about a priest walking to the platform and saying that open up the book we're gonna talk to you about such and such thing we're gonna talk to you about the the Trinity the Blessed Holy Trinity amen that's more scary to me that Anton LaVey that's the head of the Church of Satan if you didn't know that Amen anyhow a man that's exactly right so these plagues will befall upon all that would worship anything except for Jesus Christ remember not even a prophet would except worship you want to get tetanus in Revelations warning when he fell down before the feet of him he said see that do it not for am i I am of thy brethren the fellow servants the prophets hey man he said he said don't don't fall down to me he said don't fall down to me he said worship God he's the one now notice after the Tribulation Period now comes the Battle of Armageddon in Revelation chapter 18 1 through 11 and also verse 21 he talks about the merchants of the earth will get rich because the Antichrist will cause craft to prosper upon this earth everybody will be getting rich everybody will be a bit make it be making money everybody will be will we call it walking on high street hi cottons they say down south they'll have all this money laying before I man they'll think boy we've never had better times peace peace and all of a sudden here comes sudden destruction amen but the bride will be in the palace while Joseph is revealing himself to the hundred and forty four thousand I remember they kill these two prophets in the street CNN Fox News MSNBC and all these guys have their cameras out there and they have so tormented this bunch let me get this I can't leave this they so tormented this group of people that when the Romans will win a victory they take a little white stone and pass it to one others like a sign of victories and they give gifts to one of the things of that nature that had this little stone that have a name of the victory and so when these two prophets are killed in the street they start celebrating oh my let me tell you something Mardi Gras ain't got nothing on what they're getting ready to throw when they kill them two prophets I said if two men can torment billions of people on this earth I said what would come one child of God full of the Holy Ghost due to the devil every day of his life hey man let me tell you when we leave this earth the devil or throw a party he'll be so happy we get out of his face because remember the only thing that is stopping him from taking his throne I'm looking at part of him right now you're the only reason why Satan cannot move on they'll be so happy they'll throw a party about that time within three days the spirit of life will catch these two prophets and they'll be caught up if you want to read that in revelation 11 they're caught up into a cloud amen because that's where the revelation was revealed that in a cloud no wonder the devil tries to throw it off like his rocket ship smoke they don't want to admit the fact that everywhere you look in the Bible there's a cloud as the cloud as the cloud as the cloud as the cloud as the cloud not a forward missile but good cloud Amen that's right now the merchants of the earth they'll get rich but now watch in Zechariah chapter 14 verse 2 he said I will gather all the nations together against Jerusalem to battle the four winds that have brought in Armageddon came World War one and so forth like that but remember though four winds had the ability to destroy the earth world war one remember that brother been taught it like this he said that the Armageddon would have taken place in World War one but the angel of God in the eleventh month the 11th hour of the 11th day reached out and stopped the four winds and said stop right there don't you go no further hey man you Canadians remember Flanders field I meant the Holy Spirit Armageddon would have felt or on this nation on this world right at that moment but God couldn't do it you know why there was some sons that needed to be sealed there was some daughters that needed to receive the Holy Ghost hey man there was some redheads and brown heads and whatever more heads that needed to get the Holy Ghost so God held back the winds of war and he said don't you touch him until the servants of God are sealed in their forehead and then has been held off waiting for you to get your baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man you think God don't love you brother you need to take another look at it amen now all of that power that's been held back by this angel in World War 3 it will be released upon the entire earth remember there's three woes for war one world war two World War three the third world war will be a nuclear battle but remember the sixth seal opens with an earthquake anybody know where the earthquakes supposed to take place do you know oh oh that's like I've said many times I said like when they slap Micah the Prophet and it walked himself wide the Spirit of God he said you wait and go up to battle you'll see where the Spirit of God was at I say to the critics if they hear me on YouTube or they hear me anywhere in the world I don't care where they're at I say to the critics you think that we don't have the message of the hour you wait till Los Angeles's underneath the sea amen and you'll find out where the Spirit of God went when this message was the truth or not hey man we won't have to say a word a minute a file in the ocean amen now after combination of the Battle of Armageddon all nations will gather against Israel this is where in the Bible that the blood in the valley of Megiddo run to the horse's bridle they'll fight and they'll kill one another remember the prophecy questions answers his Catholics and his Protestants will gather in that valley to fight it's a religious war they're trying to squash out and stomp out anything that's against Jesus Christ and the only thing that's left representing him is that little nation of Israel sitting over there a man who said Israel I can't forget you he said you're engraved on the palms of my hands amen out of billions of people a hundred and forty-four thousand is what God remembers to some of us we think I'll just forget about it and ain't worth the time but brother to God 144,000 is more precious to him than 144 billion a man and a Nathan ninety-nine he said he leaves out ninety-nine he goes after that one mile sheep there's that lost sheep at Israel sitting up there waiting on the message of the hour to come her away amen and that prophet of God will reach out there and he'll start speaking these mysteries of God and Moses will be taking care of nature Elisha oh shut - heavens up my they'll carry on hey man we gotta get rid of these guys and they'll try to put everything there is to put on these two prophets maybe on nuclear warhead but come over their head and Moses flick it off like he'd be flicking off a fly off his shoulder he's got the power of the spoken word nothing can hurt him Amen until God releases their lives to be killed on the street but the show that it is the resurrection because remember we're in the third showdown by this time by the time the bride leaves here it is the showdown between Jesus and denominations these two men though that you're showing great powers of God remember as it was with Jesus it wasn't the blinded eyes coming open it wasn't the speaking to the squirrels it wasn't all these other things that would brother branham but the real proof of the message of the hour lay in the resurrection Amen Jesus done many great works but if he'd been dead in the tomb today he was just a man with an anointing on him amen but because he's alive forevermore and sits at the right hand of the Father resurrection proves amen that he is our message of the hour and light these two prophets they'll do great and mighty works the devil can do great and mighty works but when the resurrection speaks in their body and they step up there and receive in the cloud resurrection will testify of who they really are just like you and I we which are alive and remain rapture resurrection will speak of who the Apostle Paul was a man it'll speak of who Wesley was let the critics raise up then say well he hated the Jews well I guarantee when the revelation opens up to Luther he ain't gonna hate him amen he'll understand what the message was all about why did he do what he did because there was no seals open there was no truth revealed how could he understand that but he couldn't you don't know what you don't know amen that's right now once you look at this now coming in to the valley of megiddo they'll be trapped the Catholics and the Communists will all be trapped down in this valley of megiddo remember the Battle of Armageddon will be fought right at the gates of Jerusalem well you say communism yeah who knows who the big bear of the north is as Russia Russia is a tool in the hand of God they've got a specific purpose you know what their purpose is God is going to use them to reap judgment against the Catholic Church they will drop a bomb on Vatican City and destroy it in one hour that's thus saith the Lord I just quoted to you a man you'll find that in mark of the beast' 1956 he also said that they're called of God as Nebuchadnezzar was is a tool in the hand of God to destroy the United States there'll be only a small population left on this earth after California hits the ocean amen and all those waves that tsunami will flood right back up into Kentucky up through there and then finally they'll get Ohio cleaned up forgive me amen that wash all the way back up amen the deserts will be weeping and so forth that water will sweep right up in there and then a nuclear bomb will attack the United States all of them pressure points there'll be just a small population of them left W people may be living scattered here and there amen and what's left they'll gather together to go into that valley of megiddo and they'll surround themselves and that time Russia will be bottleneck down inside of there he said remember when they go down to get that oil he said watch out and be careful is it any wonder that today's battle over all of these political listen what they're talking about more than anything else oil oil oil oil oil oil oil why that's a prophetic timepiece it's a mile marker for us it's a marker on the side of the road to let us know that when that hour remember Jesus also said that the generation that saw Israel become a nation will not pass away before the coming of the Lord glory to God nations are breaking Israel is awakening amen the signs that the prophets foretold hallelujah Gentile days are numbered with Horus encumbered return disperse to your own Amen come back little bride come back to the word come back to the truth father fall in step for the hour is almost here amen he said I saw her marching as a masterpiece bride walking in step there was a few young ones at the very end that got out of step it's when that voice cried out get back in step Amen I kind of believe that's what's taking place now amen as always see everything scattered every which the direction the people being shook every which direction I believe the voice of God in the ministry that voice of many waters is after a call and the people of God say and stay in line stay in step keep sincere don't bow down to these titles and things around the message stay with the word amen so when he comes to the valley of magetta remember the nations that stand for Israel will be receiving eternal life at the Day of Judgment all of those those are the ones in the new city that he said took their swords and plowed him in the period to beat him into plowshares hey man these are the ones that stood remember the souls under the altar was those Jews killed down through World War two but this group they're the ones that will stand with his when all nations will surround against him hey man let me tell you something brother whoever blesses Israel will be blessed whoever curses Israel be cursed that holds all the way through to the Battle of Armageddon now we come into the set that - there's three comings of the Lord all right the first one to redeem his bride the second to receive his bride that's the second coming of Jesus Christ then the third he comes back with his bride now the hour that Israel is going to be challenged revelation 19 the bride will come out on white horses somebody said to her the Brenin one time about seeing his horse in heaven hey I made no horses and things in heaven and then he said Billy Paul wrote him a letter back and said then it's plain Revelation 19 he said where did they get to him horses riding out of Heaven's and I want to explain something to you brother I don't know brother Branham will be on prints or who would be riding but brother amen the bride will come out on revelation 19 should be on white horses that's vindicated word she'll be riding in Jesus Christ leading the battle and just as them nations surrounded or the prophet of God said that God will fight for Israel like he did in the Old Testament hallelujah everything will go down in the tribulation and all right ad 144,000 and that reelect a group they'll enter into the Millennium amen down through that thousand-year reign but everything goes down at Armageddon everything is killed this is Malachi 4 remember it when he said that the righteous shall walk out on the ashes of the wicked that takes place right there and that's whenever we step out on the ashes of the wicked entering into the Millennium and the bride will rule with a rod of iron there'll be nations in the Millenium or toward the end of the millennium that have never had a chance to hear the gospel they were blinded or they were you know just every how it was and brother branham's son of a his questions answers 59 he said that they will preach to those nations somewhere toward the end of the millennium time will preach to those people Amen that that have never had a chance and they'll have their chance in the Millennium to be able to receive it or turn it down you say where do you get that Adam and Eve did the same thing in God's Millennium they had an opportunity to accept or reject the gospel amen and Eve turned down the gospel for Satan's lie in God's Millennium time remember a day with the Lord is a thousand years thousand years a day so there we are in that millennia time amen and there as the bride goes into the millennium time there'll be a thousand year millennial reign now remember there's a chain that set around Satan The Binding not a long chain now like you take your chain up your your gear on the back of your truck but it's a chain of circumstances Satan has nobody he can work through remember last night when I thought about self deception unless you allow it the devil can't harm you will have ain't nobody there for the devil to influence he's chained I say we put a few chains on him today amen not allow him to have the ride away Amen that's right then the Holy Spirit will allow us to rule with a rod of iron as we go through the millennium time now at the end of the millennium we'll take another resurrection Jesus spoke about this and Saint John when he said all will come to all that are in the graves will hear the voice of the Son of God and they'll be raised son to life and some do damnation on the church age book brother BAM goes back to Matthew chapter 25 and he speaks about it as a shepherd that would divide sheep from goats and he said it wasn't that they were sheep and he said it wasn't that they were goats necessarily and that he was a shepherd but he said the parable the type is that these are the righteous ones that never you know done things that would cause him to lose life he said well how is it he said well when I was in prison you visited me when I was hungry you fed me when I was sick you come and saw about my needs all right I want you listen to me if that is the bride of Jesus Christ show me one place in the scripture anywhere I challenge you to come bring it to me showed me one place in the Bible the bride has ever saved based on her works is there anywhere that Paul ever taught your works is what gives you salvation you're saved by grace of God you're saved as a gift of God but when revelation 20 opens up and the books are opened up and another book is opened up and the white throne judgment opens up remember he said the dead are judged according to the works of what they did that's all they've got left so friends don't don't turn down people being good to you it might be their only opportunity I don't know who they are I don't know where they come from or what they're all about and I can't judge whether what they do to me good or ever what it might be I can't say well that's gonna give him eternal life brother Bama said they wasn't even conscious of it themself read him on that day on Calvary when he was talking about eternal life living for others he said these people didn't even realize they were doing that to Jesus they just did it out of the goodness of their hearts amen and now they're receiving laughs all right so at the end of the thousand year millennial reign now there's a resurrection that takes place this is the second resurrection the Dead which go down in that tribulation time will be raised in the same body they went down in every way they looked whatever their situations was every what it is they come out in the same body they go down in anybody know why cuz they ain't got no word body to go to there of the earth and they're raised of the earth they don't have no glorified body amen but here's the bride now remember when this resurrection takes place at that time the white throne judgment begins to set in and the Bible said the earth and the heavens fled from the face of him that sat on that throne he sets that white throne down on this earth remember judgment takes place here he said how do you know that because where did it take place the first time God did it when Adam and Eve sinned where God come to come right to the earth that was the first judgement seat of Christ when he brought Eve and Adam in the serpent before mmm before him and said what would you do this for what I the serpent gave and I ate and I gave to my husband he ate also and he looked at the serpent and cast him to the ground all these things that was the first judgment seat of Christ took place on the earth remember any time God does one thing any time it all he does anything he always keeps it the same way all the way to the end and listen they didn't do the Senate in the solar system they did the sending on the earth so where are they judged at in the very place they'd done the sinning why are they embodies they went down in because that's the bodies had done the sinning in their gonna be judged in it now let's look up in the attorneys box the heaven and the earth are scared to death of him it sits on the throne but there's one group and at whole bunch that ain't flee and she ain't scared she ain't worried she ain't fearful you know why because she's his sweetheart sitting up there in that attorney's box glory amen she's not afraid of judgment cuz she's already took it [Applause] amen she's already passed judgment she's already went to her purgatory she don't need to wash her robes it's already been washed for her remember revelation 19 when it said the wife hath made herself ready remember she couldn't make herself the wife but she could make herself ready God's the one made her what she is Amen if you got a touch of that in your heart right now you ought to be the happiest person ever walks she 11 so the judgment will be set God will stand there on the throne the bride will stand there and judge all because you imagine say sets his television screen in the sky a man he said he says got a tape recorder brother Joseph Brenham talked about this other day talking about God plays tapes you know and and I appreciated his thought but I got to laughing a little bit and I thought well well Joseph that's probably true God does have a tape recorder but the redness said he records all this stuff I thought but who are them preachers standing in that attorney box rather when that tapes being played what do they do a man they're not just up there push and play but brother Branham said they're standing there judging the nations or judging angels they're judging things rememeber he said will Paul's group be judged remember that will Paul he said then my group will be judged the same way and they'll make it like Paul's group will because I preach not played the tape I preach what Paul preached amen not being offensive brother branham I'm just served brother Joseph Brenner but I'm just saying it's more than playing tapes when we're standing there that attorneys box every girl that's ever laugh you've met every boy somebody's ever made fun of you girls with your long hair you'll be standing up there in that attorney's box and you'll be able to show judgment I am a Christian I am a daughter of God I've got to Holy Ghost you not stand there bragging you're just telling the truth what I always like to you know we've always been friends he said all right roll the tape and then right there their very thoughts are very actions of your life and everything they ever thought or spoke about she's right here before they can't deny it because it's them on the tape and listen God don't have altering equipment up there in heaven amen to alter somebody's face or imager and then like at what you see is what you get now at that hour remember it'll be during the time of that white throne judgment there'll be a combination of people start gathering together and Satan will start gathering together a group to rise up against Jesus Christ and the new city which is the bride at that time there'll be a lake of fire remember the lake of fire is on this earth it is a natural lake that burneth with fire and brimstone Jesus spoke about it when he said fear not him that have power to kill body remember that all right well if the body is going to be destroyed remember Hades or hell is what we saved the grave so when death and hail are cast in the lake of fire this habit of the REM said Hans future home the fire of God comes out of heaven it descends down into this earth mingling with this earth down here so then death and Hell or what we would say the grave or all of these principles of of death that we know of there'll be a great ball of fire burning around this earth and then all of the wicked will be cast into that lake of fire to burn for billions of years maybe you know brother Han said one time he said they could burn for a hundred billion years so how mean of God it wasn't God that put him in that situation the Lord Jesus through every roadblock in front of him he could possibly do to keep him and forbid him from that horrible place they're the ones that spit in the face of God and said I don't want nothing to do with him Amen these many of these people friends that are claiming you know I thought that snot with the mat and I on the way back to the room and you know we was talking about people being self deceived and I like the comment he made he said you know people try to do something wrong they won't repent because they've justified their own self and the self justification why they won't repent they won't I'm okay you know everybody sins everybody does oh they'll understand they justify themselves and the truth of the matter is a person knows when he's crossing the line between mercy and judgment they know their own conscience tells them that they're disobeying the word and yet they're standing right there in front of God Oh God Lord I prophesied I preached you that's a last-ditch effort to try to make one little last cover up before God has to tell him the thing they already know depart from me because I never knew you but they're still even if the white throne judgment memory said the greatest disappointments will take place at the white throne he said they'll be standing there he said looking at Oh God I was this I was that I was the other and got to say none of that matters because of this white throne and then how good you've lived and how wonderful and while these type of things it's what did you do with your opportunity that I gave you I was here in this life a man and they squandered it they traded it all for a fleet of Cadillacs like Elvis or some other thing like that amen they they they're standing there at this white throne judgment and and and hear the Spirit of God will begin to descend as Satan will beginning to rise up that's the Battle of Gog and Magog and as he begins to rise up holy fire will come out of heaven whoosh write down this whole earth and it'll burn and it will burn and it'll burn you say well that scares me where am I gonna be at sea that's the beautiful thing there's Jupiter and Saturn and Mars and all these other places and we can travel like a thought we can go anywhere we want to Lydia we just go sit on Mars for a little while hey man hey man we'll just go hang out and and relax and rejoice and just praise the Lord for a hundred billion billion billion years somebody said well I could never enjoy heaven knowing that my mama's burning the hell don't forget what he said he said when he comes out across that table he said he'll take his little maybe take his garment as he'd wipe the tears out of your eye you know dim tears represent that amendment they represents your memory Amen God will wipe your memory I've ever haven't been associated with people in time like that amen how could you enjoy it knowing that your loved ones never made it knowing that people you love never made it but he said I'll wipe the remembrance of it out of your eyes hallelujah amen and while you're there enjoying heaven you won't think about the former things because the Bible said the former things will not be remembered [Applause] [Music] now at this time the lake with fire and brimstone it burns it kills body but it breaks up the spirit and it also breaks up the soul until they're completely annihilated as though they never began in the first place God suggests God what they're paying for is not his fault he's tried to help and try to make him see what's right they're paying for it because they chose to be this way amen I know people don't believe that some people say well no God has every right right in the world he can force him he could make him but prin that's not just if God has to make him do anything then that's not justice how could he judge him at a white throne if he had to force him to live right and force them to read their Bible and force you to come to church and force you to pray that's what I said when we start falling under sicknesses and and trials and tribulations and people coming against us don't be so quick oh this is God making me God don't make us do nothing brother everything we fall in is for the perfecting of our character that's the only reason he's done it amen at the end of this thousand-year millennium comes the resurrection second resurrection the white throne judgment gog and magog and now after all of this has been purified and remember Hebrews 11 tells us that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so the earth is an attribute of God hey man I ain't got time to get to it but I'm gonna get him on catch a high spot amen but when he's when he comes back to this burning of the earth remember all of the medals and everything that's in there it'll all be burned back to its original parts the earth will be completely renovated all together it will not be destroyed the earth is an attribute of God at its core there is a core in the earth that has spoken Word of God just like God can't burn you away because that's your core his spoken word of God hallelujah amen how could God get rid of his attributes he can't get rid of the earth he can't get rid of you amen the reason all of these planets and all this stuff will exist for the eons of time amen is because there's spoken Word of God you are a spoken word of God so here you'll burn the earth all the way back down all of the meadows all the chemicals everything that man is disrupted and caused all these problems on that it'll be just burnt right back down to its original condition and then Almighty I've got to reach I can get a hold of her and start forming her again and then he'll do a renovation job don't be afraid to live in a renovated house we're getting ready to live in one hey hey man that's right and you renovate the entire earth and then he said I saw a new city new heavens and a new earth I love this I gotta get this for we get out of here brother Brennan said not only is the earth being purified but it said the air is full of disease germs and everything else you understand one reason why I was you know the weather starts changing and it cut something you got off the earth necessarily we call it it's floating in the air that's why they say sneeze rock kiss or call fried cat you know cuz you get on your hand you touch somebody or whatever and they said cover your mouth you ever heard mommy said cover your mouth when you sneeze girl I tell mine all the time was your raise to the barn [Laughter] and so you you sneeze out and it it puffs out into the air well they ain't no telling in this air this atmosphere how many disease germs are laying up in here all of the smog and all the chemicals all the nuclear testing and all the bombs and every thought all the mustard gas and everything's been floating around ain't no telling what kind of perversion is up in there but when that holy fire of God comes out of heaven it'll burn up this first heavens and purify everything around us Amen all that cigarette smoke all of that marijuana all of that stuff floating around in the air hey man you won't have to walk into God's new Walmart and smell marijuana and cigarettes when you walk in a man when you walk into that new city glory to God hey man the air is gonna be cleaner than you've ever breathed it in your entire life hey man won't be one diseased term there won't be no hey cover your mouth if you coughing that new city it'll only be for the pure joy of just making a call for that having to worry about why we Amen but in that new city everything will be purified everything will be cleansed back to its original condition we won't have to worry about nothing hey man and in this new city anybody know what the new city what shape it is anybody pyramid shape there's 60 degree angle and who is sitting at the top of that pyramid our Lord Jesus Christ so at the angle of 60 degree angle you rise everywhere you walk you'll be able to see him everywhere you go and that city will have all kinds of different stones it'll have all these different rubies and onyx and gems and sapphires and all of these different colors and when the light of that Shekinah glory that's emitting out of the body of Jesus when it strikes that new city it'll send a rainbow hue all the way around that city you know rainbow speaks up don't you Redemption God's promise hallelujah and everywhere you look you'll see the theme of redemption you'll have a tree that produces 12 manner of fruit amen you'll have all of these things and guess what's at the gate of the city not tape recorders judges there'll be judges in that new city they'll open up the gates of the city and those that are on the outside of the city a saved population of people people that received eternal life amen not because they were bribed but because of some category God placed him in that they could make it excuse us that this sounds wild but God promised me my inheritance my children can be there and I'm believing if they're not bribed that God will put a man I'm believing that a man if they're not bribed they don't ever want to serve the Lord I'm believing somehow that God can give me my children I'm believing it somehow brother John I don't know how you do it but I'm believing what the Bible said amen and then if they live outside that seat said then they'll come in they'll pluck the leaf off the tree of life and say this is for the healing of the nations in the future home brother mem said those men will standards they just think we used to shoot one another and kill one another and slaughter one another all that he said but now there's no death in this city Amen that ain't bride talking brother that's some of them nations that were standing for Israel standing out there realizing that God's grace was more merciful to them than what they could ever describe Amen because I'm going to tell you something if you think this is a noisy place down here on earth rather I guarantee some of the ones that never halt or never amen praise the Lord when they see them big city gates open up and they're walking on them transparent streets of gold I guarantee you think Chad is something you think brother Ben is something you ain't never heard of hallelujah in all of your life you'll hear it plumber on the other side of the gates of glory I made it I made it I made it I made it I made it I made it to this holy place I made it by the grace of God I'm here I made it I'm gonna tell you something brother that's the goal that's the objective that's the vision and all this time God bringing all these future events together for one purpose you do you want to know who the celebrities of heaven will be you know in this life we have celebrities American idols and all these type of people you wonder who the celebrities will be Paul was just here that song he wrote about our you see you know and then he takes that from that quote where brother brems said they'll walk up and say what age are you from let you see it later see ya my goodness let me shake your hand you're from video C oh my goodness how'd you ever make it out of let you see up there marvel that we ever made it out of such a wicked age and the fella you talking to was eight by a lion or he was burned at a stake we marvel at them but let me tell you something brother five minutes of having to suffer torments of the body ain't nothing compared to having to deal with what we deal with on an everyday basis this is the greatest battle ever fought we are assaulted in a way that they could never understand never experienced but let me tell you the overcoming power is in this bride amen to not just save her but the entire world in future events all depend upon us making our capstone adoption we are the link if there was a missing link we are it oh we are the missing link of everything that lays out there we are the link between the generations past and for the generations future it all rides upon what we do no wonder they ask for the Brennan or he made it you know almost like a is a query you know brother ham what age would you have chosen said of I to chose to live any day he should have been this day oh and I Got News for you I'm not a brand ambassador like some people are I'm proud of brother branham cuz I gots I Got News for him will tell you something brother branham said that whenever Jesus comes to this earth he said he'd go to brother Brennan first he said and then brother Brennan would come back with all them Saints and we would meet every single one I'm because see God will come to the messenger of the age the leader of the age first he said it's time to go down go get your people Paul Luther it's time to go get down on them all the ones that you let I'd run that Protestant Reformation Wesley you got a whole group down there boy they're waiting in the ground for you let's go get them hallelujah I don't believe it's going to be a prophet setting up load tear amen shooting a brown bear hanging in the corner and getting on an airplane and flying around amen all about your man-made doctrine we are the reason that Jesus would even send him back to this earth in the first place because once the bride comes to her place once she comes to her position then like all Eagles do we gather with our leader on the other side these future events now I don't mind telling you the majority of the people in this message they're only looking through a keyhole of what is truth they only see a small little spot of what they think this age is all about but I'm gonna tell you something there won't be no rheumatoid over there there won't be no diabetes over there there won't be anxiety there won't be fear there won't be nervousness you won't have to be embarrassed about your hair other people making fun of your dresses you won't have to worry about none of that because they won't be one Bob here woman on them streets ago there won't be one cigarette sucking gangbanger over there but there Chad there won't be none of them Hindus over there brother Faisal Amen there won't be none of these message people that claim true but ain't got an ounce of the Holy Ghost that are always trying to debate and shift and fighting there won't be none of these critics over there brother jail Amen when we walked in the streets of gold let me tell you something I am a court jesus is a cordially inviting you and I invite you amen to an eternal youth camp for about at least 10 million years Amen because there won't be one old person there won't be no 90 year old no gray heads there won't be no stooped shoulders how they loo Utica it'll be in a tire cap on that new city won't be nothing but young people there hey man I might even get to keep my beard hallelujah hey hey oh thank you Jesus nah listen to this 2nd Thessalonians 2:9 the Bible said that he would consume him with the spirit of his mouth revelation 19:15 out of his mouth when a two-edged sword is that any wonder that he says in the last day he said she the bride under her messenger will be the final voice to the final age everything depends on how you talk to get your talking straight you got to get your thinking straight to get your thinking straight you got to get your heart straight it takes preachers to get that it takes you reading your Bible praying and lame before the presence of God takes you coming to church and having prayer meetings and listen to your pastor and obeying the teachers and digging in the revelation takes you obeying God submitting yourself surrendering yourself cuz once your heart gets right then your thinking can get right amen as I told you Friday night you just don't realize who you are yet Church a me because if you realize who you are you'll come to a spot to where that you won't take no prisoners and you won't take no for an answer amen and you will not let the devil stop you because brother Branham said when we come to adoption he said the sons of God will stop had a drink I'm back that the devil's taken from them they'll take this world back in their hand because the Bible said the meek shall inherit this earth amen the spirit of their mouth what they speak is gonna be backed up by Almighty God that's why one of these days I'm gonna raise up and I'm gonna be looking in the mirror I'm gonna feel a little something from heaven and I say okay buddy you you tormented me enough you've aggravated me enough time for you to get down to business change amen brother Branham said we would speak our own resurrections that's what he said he said we would speak to our bodies you say well ain't possible innit whenever you're sick and you got a sickness in your body brother brems said you dismiss that sickness in about like a general would dismiss his troops I dismiss you from my body a man you say well what if you don't go the orders still given a man it's just a matter of time for the Holy Spirit to do what he's got to do amen the body will have to obey the spoken word of the bride of Jesus Christ remember you're hunting you want game yes Monica lips but I've always said it's your word he said but whatever you say he said Lord is that what that meant all these years could this be that third Pole he said glory to God hallelujah amen what is it all about brother it's about you coming to your position of authority it's about you recognizing the vision that this whole thing is not about you understanding what a white horse looks like or what our plague looks like the whole thing as we say on home the whole enchilada hallelujah amen it's all about yeah that's what it's all about it's about you the reason Christ came the reason Christ condescended the reason Christ died the reason Christ was buried the reason Christ resurrected the reason the message was sent the reason we're going to a new city you you you you praise God future events amen well I can't say I'll have to close because I've got nothing else to preach I've got hours here amen but let you get to jest to the message Amen I believe it with all my heart one last thing I'm gonna tell you for we quit one last thing first Thessalonians 5 verse 2 he tells us that he'll come to us as a thief in the night remember the rapture itself will not be a public show twist about the third pool so it won't be an open show won't be a published show the rapture he said will be like Romeo and Juliet he said one day he said Romeo put his ladder up at her window amen Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo and see the bride speaks out Here I am Here I am and it'll be the way he'll come as a secret catching away it'll be such a secret that the whole world will miss it when it happens and it'll be done in such a manner that the only ones that receive it are the ones that are looking for it well how do you know what to look for if there's no message to show you how to see it that's why we've got a message today so that we can see what God's gonna do it's a lens if you will it's binoculars into the future we can see everything every move that God's gonna make we know I removed the devil's gonna make you realize the Satan is Satan the devil himself Satan cannot Bluff us when the whole world rumor revelation 12 the whole world wonders after the Beast the whole world is deceived remember that he deceives the whole world there not a one of them that don't fall under his devices but there's a little group but don't you know why she's done read the back of the book she knows how it ends so well the Pope we worried about no Pope World Council of Churches hey no problem me Oh aren't you afraid about took about people tell me all the time aren't you afraid about the economy collapsing then shutting our doors and that's having to live on the streets and that's how I said I don't believe the bride will see a bit of that I believe about the time that squeeze goods are coming on have you ever been in the shower please tell me you have been at some time in your life have you ever been in a shower and you got a bar of soap in your hand you know Tom mountain and your hands all wet and the soaps all lathery and we're so good you try to give her a good squeeze like that you pop you ever had that happen to you Paul come on yeah he showers don't he please tell me he does all right Laurie that's why I believe it'll be with the bride now we may see pressure come that's true but remember the bride is not purified by shutting doors and bombs dropping and all this other stuff I believe this squeeze will get like that it'll squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze and before the devil can really clench this grip will put right out of here in a moment and the twinkle and I I've been waiting all in my life to say this to the devil now you see me now you don't so we'll come to the spot where our Romeo will call us out of here we got to be ready we got to be ready our garments have to be washed we have to be ready it's like you know we've told the story a million times as preachers and people we've talked about that story of the rancher and how she couldn't wrinkle her dress and she was standing waiting on him I always love this part whenever he shows up he comes with his wagon and you know have you ever seen a wagon in the Old West I do a little work seasonally every now and then for some of the third graders third fourth and fifth graders in California and they do their state testing and it's just for a few weeks out of the year and I grade their testing we do a holistic type grading where you just say you don't say like an ABCD F but you you kind of give them a grade where okay this was pretty good this is you know and then have ten other people look at it and that's how they do their testing and so to be able to get an idea about how you're supposed to grade them they give you about all I could give you about five or six pieces information and they give you all these little prompts that you got to follow and a couple years ago they started in on stage coaches and I've never even thought about this until I started reading that little prompt and said that the stage coaches they had to perform in a certain manner when they was approaching to see you're getting ready to make a stop because there was a dust cloud that followed that stagecoach whenever it showed up and I thought oh god I thought one day our ranchers going to come amen and when he shows up he's going to have a cloud around him hallelujah brother brems said that ain't then ain't it said what you talk rises in the Sun I'll say it like this it wasn't rocket ship smoke it wasn't that he said that was our Lord up there memorized the Sun he turns the picture to the ride he said can you see him air look at his eyes his beard and all that you hear them people - congregation hey he said there he is he said that's our Lord up there amen he come with the cloud he's here he's already here his presence is here in the form of the revelation of the word he's here but he's come in at the same time amen i'm rapture but i'm gonna be raptured i'm resurrected but i'm going in the resurrection hey man it all has to come together like a hand in a glove oh god just help me be ready more anything else brother joe i want to be ready i want to be ready to meet his great presence in the air how they stand with me thank you Jesus that was an hour and a half of preaching if you're watching the clock hey don't laugh I did pretty good to get that

all right sweetheart I know I know my little girl probably couldn't known it either some of them things they go over top your hair but I like to test people every now and then just see if they're you
