wonderful testimony right throughout that song he was the first to rescue us amen and were never to be lost again a minute what wonderful amen so let's sing out here somewhere 3:57 breaked out of read of life amen it's it's why we've come we've come to worship Him and to bring him on the scene but we've come to hear the word and I have him break the bread of life to us hey man you know we're just just thinking us weak listen to it listen to a message and I began to realize in a greater way that when we when we gather together like this you know we know that whoever two or more gathered in his name there he is an amiss but it's even to me it's even greater than that because that's the same God that split the Red Sea for the children of Israel to walk across the same God that stopped the earth rotation so that Joshua could fight his battle and finish it it's the same God that's here so it really doesn't matter how we feel physically or anything like that or whatever might be bothering us that same God that stopped the earth brother branham say he he would do it for one of his children so if you need healing this morning if they needed to touch from him you just need to get closer to him that same girl I was walking the aisles today just remember that and I could after after getting that that understanding I can't be the same coming into this church anymore just can't so he's here to touch us all we got to do is just reach out let's sing break down a brand of life to us [Music] do [Music] they [Music] my [Music] [Music] blessed be a name [Music] there yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you Lord Jesus [Music] praise the Lord holy [Applause] [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] to [Music] thank you Lord Jesus [Music] Oh [Music] now [Music] yes [Music] they made [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you Lord Jesus [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus praise the Lord [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] first verse [Music] [Music] [Music] amen they come back to here just the mechanics of the word but the living works the dynamics a man it's true often that most are focusing on the on the mechanics on the letter of the word but very few are focusing on the on the mechanic the dynamics the power of the word a man so I pray grace that we're going to put the emphasis on the power the annoying so that the word is not just new thoughts in our heads but it's a new influence in our lives by the grace of Almighty God if you do what you do is because of the work and it's not just the letter but the Living Word because it's not you that lives it's the word living in you amen we say always Jesus living in me and and the greater the greatest revelation most God of Jesus is no more than what this this brother did in painting a man so brother we gotta have the spiritual revelation of Jesus the personal revelation of Jesus a man that I know him and he knows me Amen hi fellow sir within me fellows who with me is alive he's an attending yeah he gave the promises I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you he said to the end of the age if he's in you then he's in control he's in control of your thoughts your spirits your motors your objectives and let's be careful make sure go under his anointing under his control a man because again let's remember it be reminded concerning Jesus and His disciples I might not chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil a man well of course he knew a man he knew which one and so we pray the grace of God concerning God and those that God has chosen to believe this message around the world we know that some of them are devils and some of them are demons so we better be on our guard make sure we got the right anointing amen and that it's the spirit of Jesus influencing us not the spirit of the devil amen so the grace of it grace of God and if there's Jesus brother you talk about a right attitude at right spirit amen it's going to be Jesus amen so the grace of God be with us so be in prayer for us today because today I have to be back at the condo because there is a board meeting and we are required to be there and not not everyone in the condo but the owners of candles and that's what it's mainly for so we have to be there I have to be there at least two o'clock and so being prayer as we go through the word a man so it's gonna shorten my time but again it's that's art on the preacher because I'll tell you I'll be honest there's so much that I feit that's a blessing to me as a servant of God as a pastor I read and I'd see the pastor any ministry is going to see things that you're not going to see amen but God's going to show it to them reveal it to them so they can convey it to you a man out there today I got scripture after scripture after scripture quote after quote after quote and there's message after message after message that I feel that we need to know when they need to be brought to our attention a man by the grace of God so it's it's difficult when you're when you're put under the pressure to do this part of the pressure to do that a man but again when the ministry submits to it not my will father don't be done because as Jesus endured it as the bravas endure it it so that any ministry will endure it for the Gospels sake by the grace of God so be in prayer because I wanted to finish some of the quotes on the message on the rapture and to finish that series concerning the rapture a man we could go on and somebody said your there's no way you can told me some years ago there's no way I could compare to brotherly veil and because they said brotherly Bailey he take a message a sermon and he set off the prophet and he would preach seventy messages on it and you know because he would go through and he would start at the beginning goes through sentence by sentence by sentence and commenting on what the Providence said highlighting what it what it was all about and I remember preaching a certain sermon and sister coffee did say was the best she ever heard and and I preached 69 messages on that sermon and and I said well does that qualify me I said to beyond the same level as brotherly Bale a man so there is there's a lot because the power of God says the more you go into it the more it's gonna be revealed and that is the truth the mother see it's like the Bible talking to our brother Alec last night at the fellowship met brother Chad's sister Leah's two most oh this is this is just the Bible and this is about God and and so on and what he did and what he and what he's going to do he's saving us we were lost and we're being saved but I said there's not many that really got the revelation of the plain purpose and pattern I'll tell you I thought it is there's very very few in the world today that even stopped and consider the plan of God the purpose of God or the pattern of God and that's why the the enemy gets gets them and confuses them and leaves them astray and they're religious but they are not spiritual a man so it was the same thing with Cain God said have you do well and it's got to be according to the word you'll be accepted amen but he wouldn't do it and there's a lot of believers that believe the message but they're not going to go all the way and get into the message and let the message get into them amen to go and live the message a man and grow to be controlled by the message a master that you're not living you're not living for yourself you're living for what God has revealed you're living because you you see this book amen wonderful so many Christians they just read it as a devotional and that's it but for us is life amen it's the revelation of what's going on in the world from time down toward eternity down through time going back to going back to eternity by the grace of Almighty God a man so good we thank the Lord for the song and our brother John and Kalambo trio saying concerning from time to eternity praise the name of the Lord say brother then this is the plan going from time to eternity this is the plan a man that shows us the climax of it all is the rapture a man it is not just us just going on and one day we're gonna there's gonna be a resurrection and one day you know Jesus is gonna come and work we're gonna see him and so on no no he comes down and takes us up as he came down and took up the Old Testament Saints he's gonna come down and take up the New Testament Saints brothers see they don't recognize it and for years and years and years - it was just a good book you know the Bible that's all but to us it's the it's the it's the plan purpose and pattern of God but it's also the plan and purpose and pattern of God of our lives a man you identify with it personally you got to know where you where it started you got to know what God was doing doing down through the ages - well for he was aiming to get you a man so it's not not by accident so we got to see ourselves in the Word of God by the grace of God so God Elvis is my prayer and the Lord willing as I said I'll try to get in and just give you the thoughts of the profit on the rapture but and I appreciated the song Jesus on the inside and you know what he's doing he's changing your life from the inside out and what he's doing it's not just just just so that you move dear and be a witness no he's taking us back to eternity God is working in us by the grace of God a man not just to be a witness that's part of it but our do we realize the end result of all of it all is going from time to eternity it's going back home to be with the Lord by the grace of God a man and the move is on to change the body we're moving into a greater and a more glorified condition we thank God for what he's done but brother what God has done you know why he did this you know why he did that he's to get us to put our emphasis on it they get us to live for it man together see just as just Dave morning morning new tonight that were focusing on what God has done and what God is doing what God has revealed and what God is revealing well you know what we're doing we're walking in the light brother is not just coming in the light and sitting down it's walking in the light a man by the grace of Almighty God well there's too many back that have come in and they sit down under religious and that's it a man oh I'm a believer they're not both the other believers all right but they're believe in the devil more than they believe in Jesus amen because if you're walking in the light it controls you here in the church it controls you out there in your job it controls you in your home no matter what it is it's the light Amen by the grace of God again like that gentleman that you've married to a wife and there's the Christian and he and he told people he were talking about it one time in a pub and he said I he said my wife's a Christian he succumbed me said yeah with me and I'll show you and he said I'll prove it and he was going to bring out her Christian testimony and of course they went in and then they they were drinking in his house and then and they made a mess around the table in the kitchen and so finally they moved into the living room and the wife came out with a broom and she said she began to sweep up must Jesus bear the cross alone and that's why she was singing and all the world will go free no there's a cross through everyone there's a cross from me and she was thanking the Lord and praising the Lord and he and he whispered to the others he says see I told you she was a Christian a man whereas others would maybe get real mad and real upset a man but she was she was walking in the light as she was controlled by the light amen she didn't do what was right in her own eyes naturally but spiritually a man she was looking through the eyes of God a man and she was not just as I said identifying with him in the power of his resurrection but in the Fellowship of his suffering amen so god help us brothers sister I pray that you're going you're going to be willing to reflect Jesus amen Jeff before we sing only believe we received the card from our sister Alana and brother David butts in in Louisiana and it's a thank you card and a picture of course of the family and so we'll put it outside after the service and after I finished a preaching and myself and brother David will be leaving because I got to get to that meeting but sister Alana said we want to thank you all for your love and support over the past year and she said surely the effectual fervent prayer avails much less the effectual yea fervent prayer avails much I know it saw me through dark hours and ultimately brought about a great evening amen thank the Lord it's the grace of God yes indeed grace oh my and there's some thoughts that's down my heart too concerning grace and we'll share that with you amen see there's no end of the word amen okay and now that what we think grace is Grace and that's it and all I just want to show you the the greatness of grace a man the depth of grace the height of grace a man the extent of grace well we think we're in the Grace Covenant whether it was always grace a man definitely most definitely so sister Lanice said I pray that he will bring it back upon your own individual lives and meet your desires and needs as fully as he did mine I know he will in Christian love and it's from brother David sister Alana butts and the children a man so they have four five children so we administered to our sister for a number of years and so on and then of course of course they were married years when when brother Pruett was there at the same time we got him the minister at just preached a little bit at the at the wedding we at the time we were renting the seventh-day Adventist Church or just borrowed it and and it's tremendous and I'm sure that would he or another wedding there they had a number of the people from that congregation came to mind that's the most spiritual wedding I ever we were ever witnessed a man because when the bride came in we saying only believe all things are possible only really a man that's unusual but they were the visitors they were absolutely amazed and very pleased and blessed by it they were because they came and told me about it Amen so god bless again our sister Alana and brother David and I believe sister Sara was married there yeah as well amen so god bless them this stand is saying only believe all things are possible only believe amen holy oh all things are possible only be all the way Oh [Music] all favor

it's a challenge to pray it's a challenge to trust you it's a challenge to believe father that which the enemy Lord is causing us to disbelieve that was the enemy is causing us to doubt what Albus Lord and as we plead the life of your blood against the influence of the world and the flesh and the devil in our lives Lord in our thoughts we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you have control we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord that you control our thoughts you controlled our motives and our objectives to control Lord our decisions father is not me that lives it's you that

that will receive and will accept and walk in the light Lord that you have revealed father and I just come into the light but walk in it father Alleluia that we'll keep walking in the light we'll try

controlling us thought word and deed lor we go forth as Christians we go forth as those who are christ-like father in our thoughts in our words and our deeds in the life that we live so help us nor do we have the desires that you had hallelujah we the desires that you have and you're reflecting it lured in and through us hallelujah is not my will but the but the Father's will Lord that's what your desire that is our desire it is the will of God in these last days father we know it's serious because you told us if you did a shortened time there'd be no flesh saying father that's so serious it is getting so elbows in the name of Jesus Lord in this very confusing and very serious our Lord that we're going to be serious with you hallelujah that we're going to stay with you we're gonna believe you we're going to love you hallelujah in love your word we're gonna love Lord your sons and daughters hallelujah and the fellow members of the bride of our Lord Jesus Christ so the grace of God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the grace of God be with us constantly the grace of God be with us continually the grace of God be with us in the going forth of the word and the grace of God be with us in the receiving of the word in the believing of the word Alleluia praise the Lord father we're going to believe the whole truth and nothing but the truth a man we're gonna believe the whole truth

that's living is the Living Word of the Living God in us by the grace of God and Lourdes separates us from the word of the things of the world and the foolishness of the world we're separated onto the

things are possible [Music] be baby [Music] [Applause] [Music] multi-ball [Music] Amen god bless just turn with me to the book of Judges chapter 17 the book of Judges chapter 17 a man and as returning to judges 17 again to remind you of what I read I believe in the last service here and it is the message on perfect faith that was preached just shortly before the Lord called brother Branham home well this was known in this was August 63 and of course the rapture message was in in December 65 that was before the Lord called him all a man and his last emphasis was really the rapture a man and the communion so the grace of God but in 1963 after the opening of the seven seals he said this come to perfect faith he said this is coming into that third Pole a man which we believe was the opening of the word the breaking that of the seven seals the revealing of the mystery of God and the question is are we coming and had we come in to the third Pole are we still under the first and second Pole and just believing this was the third pole we got to move as the Prophet had to move we've got to move he had to move on beyond the first and beyond the second Pole not putting emphasis on it but he has just begin to put emphasis on the third Pole and that was the opening of the word and even after the opening of the seven seals the prophet of God preached this message and that message he said this and in one was marriage and divorce and he said this is another revelation on the sea and the seven seals the mystery of God so God began to reveal and open to us the revelation of his will a man on to perfect faith and even unto the rapture he made what he's looking for his pearly faith a man and because it's going to take perfect faith to get us in the right a man so he said this is coming into that third pole what perfect faith the open word giving perfect faith brother what God gave Luther was perfect what God Wesley was perfect and the Pentecostals and others but brother he wasn't going to produce the perfect faith that God was looking for for the rapture and for the resurrection it gave him the faith they needed for that and for that and for that but brother there was a generation that was rising that needed a faith for the rapture a faith for the resurrection a man so we pray the grace of God that we are now in the third pole we are experiencing the third pole it is Christ working in us on the rapture so this is coming in to that third pole and he said I am working out something and he said is taking this charge of faith understand it hear it believe it and he said and going right back he sir where you have never noticed it that way before he said not a faith because it was faith faith faith but now he said the emphasis is on perfect faith a man praise the name of the Lord and he said not a faith but a perfect faith and he said build up in here and I believe us build up in the in your heart and in your soul and he said and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart he said keep a perfect promise a man praise the Lord he said by is perfect word a man and that's your perfection and my perfection by the grace of God amen this is Grace it is by grace through faith we are saved it is by grace through faith through faith that God is God doing revealing the word see when it was it was that Grace and that faith that God got God gave Luther a guy gave Wesley God gave the Pentecostals but brothers sister now it God's requiring a greater faith it is by grace through faith aim that was that was salvation there in his justification in his Saint a vacation in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but brother the salvation that God looking for now is the redemption of our bodies amen and God and it requires perfect faith absolute perfect faith you can't add to it now you can't take from it a man so the grace of God and he said choice of any cities to keep a perfect promised by His perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a deserter of the thoughts of the heart and he's still discerning the thoughts and intents of yard amen oh yes that never stopped with the profit that keeps on going God is discerning the thoughts and intents of your heart God he wants to see what you're aiming for what you're believing with you know what was your purpose for living and so on Amen God got to just understand that no matter where you are whether it's in church withers out there in your home in your job God's discerning the thoughts and intents of your heart a man and sometimes garlic God will allow this to to bring it out to highlight it to you and you'll wonder and maybe you call it because you to wonder a man but it'll be God striking you and bring you conviction a man if there's something there concerning the thoughts of your heart brother they get that doesn't please God so God is working on us to keep us in that perfect faith come on in the name of the Lord and let's look to him listen listen this trust Jesus let's say I let our fellow should be with him a man and the revelation of his word Lourdes you're working in me what does did you want to tell me what you want to reveal to me what does you want me to do when to do it how to do it a man now because Lord I want your leadership a man now many one among God's leadership know no man and and what they'll do is they'll compromise no compromise said to get you know to please themselves oh and at the same time the devil of persuade them that they're pleasing God God won't mind this guy won't mind that but in the judgment you'll realize it was too late amen that he did offend God a man in God through the ministry tried to explain expand those things but they're not accepting those things today they just want the preacher to get up preach preacher revelation preach this revelation crease that revelation but don't get personal amen my god gets personal amen so brother sister this is the perfect faith that God is looking for and God is getting real real personal with you because he what he wants to do he wants to do in his elect in his sons and daughters amen and then in this hour and in this age they got to be completely surrendered to him they got to be completely given over to his leadership a man as Jesus ahead lay down and yield completely the flesh to the will of God for that hour for that time amen in the in the in the crucifixion of the word brother so now so we got to do the same thing in this hour amen we got to lay ourselves down and come give ourselves completely over to the revealed word amen and I'll tell you it's the the the word is crucified again the second crucifixion of Christ is in the bright a man that's the truth they don't think it was over there in the denominations the first pole the second ball no no no and then they come to the third pole and they rejected it and so on but we believe it no he has Satan is there to crucify Christ in the bride amen he knows the right crisis made flesh in the bride so brother I pray God help us to be spiritually minded and spiritually and were thought word and deed a man and he said we are coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture and that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith a man I just believe in scenario I believe where there's coming a rapture no where we got to have that faith in us now amen and looking for and expecting the rapture in the moment now anybody and know that we're living in that hour right now by the grace of Almighty God ki consider the world and the foolishness is going on over there brother and like I say it's worse than what your that is true there's more going on than what you realize that's right there's more being killed than what you want to know over there brother Santana and we know that it's laughing over in the end of the Great Tribulation brother the world is insane completely insane and the devil is in control as the proverb brought out in the rapture message and he said it he said the devil he said is the god of this world any years and if he's the god of this world what power does he have over this world well power is the exercising what's he doing hey man there's a lot of things he's doing brother they did that I trust my grace we believe and we realize it even though we're not seen it naturally yet but I pray God we're not here to see it in the Great Tribulation amen but we're gonna see and what we're going to see and be concentrating more on what God's doing and what God has done then what the devil is doing pray God that the Satan is not our God say they though he's the god of this world I trust that we're not of the world you guys are you love the world the things of the world he says the love of God is not in you and and when it come to the things of the world brother it's not necessarily when a country thing oh that's the simple stuff going on out there now they are they're known it's just it's just a just a sinful thing just whether the prophet of God brings that right here in the rapture message concerning what science invents and all of these things and people are caught up with the inventions of scientific inventions and brother I tell you get caught up with that brother yeah and you're gonna do what's right in your own eyes oh this is good but we're not we're not gonna get caught up in the rapture when it caught up in what science is doing amen brother god help us because the Bible says God brought Israel how did God did this God did this and they sought of many inventions and he said the prophet of God said and God came in sinner and destroyed them and destroyed their inventions amen brother Aeterna that's the scare that's not guy that God seen that's guess as the devil seat because Cain and his lying sort of these invention SSI Cain and initiate is scientific amen it's they're the ones that doing this they're the one who's doing that that's why they went over there after they were put out of the garden and then the seed of Cain they invented this he invented that the invented yeah even musical instruments they emitted all of they safe but there was it wasn't a seed of Abel there wasn't a wasn't God seat he it wasn't it wasn't an atom seat it was serpent seat brother every better honor God don't love the world and only I don't love the world but whatever the things of the world and people are getting caught up with the things of the world because it appeals to the flesh a man God Elvis so he said we got to come to this with this faith in order perfect faith in order for the rapture and that's what's only in a way right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect rapture faith so brother be are we focusing on it I'll be thinking about it meditating on it pray more and more Lord let me help me let go and let God have his way help me to get more and more into the revelation of the rapture now I'm in a sea Lord not what you have done but what you are doing a man he said I am looking for it and it's seen it means a lot of shaking down for me the Prophet yeah a lot of shaking down for the Prophet it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God amen well God's grace brother I trust we're going to make it work because we're not going to get caught up with the world or the things of the world any man this as much says what the gains line is gays caught up with that's where the service seat is caught up with it is the things of the world they're impressed by the inventions of man and so on and God brother and Israel came to this and bringing confusion among the children of Israel and I preached on this back in in Empire Avenue or are in the in that church center an empire avenue that we were using concerning doing what's right in their own eyes the Jews after God brought him out of Egypt doing what's right in their own eyes brought confusion leading to Civet or rather to bring the unbelief that led to civil and religious confusion in Israel a mayor God brought him into the promised land and God left this nation there that nation there in the other nation there a man man and just he was testing Israel and he even begged the tribe of Benjamin it was in complete victory any man and brother in complete obedience leads to civil and religious confusion and it is and that's what we're finding today even among message believers and it is in complete obedience and is leading to civil and religious confusion even among believers Amen God Elvis brother that we're going to we're not going to be guilty of in complete obedience but we're going to completely obey what God has revealed any man we're gonna stay with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth any man even though in the world in the wall you're gonna be foolish in the eyes of the world are gonna be a fanatic the Prophet said a man but God's grace we're not fanatics in his eyes amen in judges chapter 17 and there was a man of Mount Ephraim whose name was Micah and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursus and speakers of also in mine ears bill the silver is with me I took it and his mother said blessed be thou of the Lord my son and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said I had only dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore I will restore it unto thee yet he restored the money on to his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made their other graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of Micah and the man Micah a Dan house of God's just think God bringing Israel out of Egypt and here they are going into idolatry God bringing us out of out of denominational Egyptian bondage and many believers going into a dolla tree being caught up with a world and the things of the world they love this and they love that and just watch I preached on selling your birthright for a shekel and a suit and a shirt for money and you know for a good clothing and and this and that and something else that's what I pray something back years ago a shekel and a shirt don't know this is what a this is whether they're going to sell out for you watch this this is this is what the priests of God sold out for a man to go into a house that a idolatry or they there would this one believed in God and and they they had they had gods there and other gods their brother and then there's believers say oh they believe in God but you go into their homes and they got gods this is their God that is their God a man and it says the man Micah had a house of God's and made an effort and a tear of him and consecrated one of his sons who became is priest idolatry in those days there was no king in Israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes this too was right in the eyes of God and there was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah of the family of Judah who was a Levite and he sojourn there and the man departed out of the city from Bethlehem Judah to sojourn where he could find the place and he came to Mount Ephraim the house of Micah as he journeyed and Micah said unto Him whence cometh now and he said unto him i am a levite of Bethlehem Judah and I go to sojourn where I may find a place where he were fighting favor with man not willing to stay separated under the Lord grace of God elbis and Micah said unto Him dwell with me and beyond to me a father and a priest and I will give the 10 shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the Levi went in a man he was deceit and the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons and Micah consecrated the Levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah and then said Micah now know high that the Lord will do me good scene I have a Levite to my priest but he would have to he would air to sanctify his home to get the rest of the others out the guards out the idols out a man a man before God wasn't going to bless him the priest went in God went out a man he's in complete obedience brother ledger civil and religious confusion amen and the same thing is going on today even among many believers god bless you may be seated so brother sister in the rapture God has called calling for a total separation from unbelief either actually God is calling for a perfect faith in the rapture God is calling for an absolute complete and total separation a greater separation of what hear it any what he required and what expected in any other age a man God expects it in God is required in this hour and in this age a male because why because the world is a lot worse than in this hour and in this age and it was in Luther's age the world is worse in this age than it was in Wesley or the Pentecostal age a mayor and his gang and the world is getting to that place it's worse yes and it's getting to that place as I've already said concerning the scriptures that he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saying but that means everything is getting pretty bad amen as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah brother ie raptured lot irreverent Enoch rather in rapture and Enoch a man but he say sent a mess of the deliverance messenger down to an Abraham and Sarah he sent messengers dentist into Sodom and Gomorrah a man for therefore the elect that where they were there a man now they they were they weren't ordained like Enoch for the rapture they didn't they didn't what with God a man and the one with God brother what it what is it - what with God it is so they God have control of your life so that so that it's not you their lives as God living in you a man the walk with God is is God good making this decision and you're carrying it out it's God making that decision in your kinda doubt and brother in conversation with with this person or that person it's not you that they're talking to they're talking to God a main because and what God would say that's what you're going to say and the thoughts and the ideas that you express is the thoughts and the ideas that God would express a man brother this is this is absolutely tremendous when it comes to being a part of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen remember as Jesus was the Word made flesh of the bride is the word made flesh and the fullness of the Godhead body was in the flesh of Jesus and the prophets say the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the flesh of the bride brother this is serious care are we part of the body you know we're in the fullness of the Godhead is living we're in the fullness of the Godhead is made flesh we're in the fullness of the God it is is living of the word of God for this hour and for this age a man we're in the fullness of the Godhead any in the body of the bride is what it is bringing for the redemption of our bodies and the resurrection as Jesus did back there listen say she had to come to a total separation back there in the elephant ministry so it comes to a total separation in the Omega ministry a man because brother and he was separated led even concern his disciples he wanted their fellowship with anyone is a man because because it got to the place or there they had taken taken his ministry and his life for granted they then assumed too much and so on that's the true because the faith that he gave them was go school was decreasing a man man I'll do why do you know that because he gave them the power to go ahead and heal the sick and raise the dead and do this and do this and do that we don't have a record of all that they did but we do have a record that it was a time when they when they did they took her they took their faith for granted a man and when this man brought about his son and he asked the disciples to pray pray for his son and then they prayed but nothing happened and his son wasn't a gly brother they had already come back with a testimony that already said oh we we went out we did this we did this we did this but now they couldn't do this they couldn't pray they couldn't get bring deliverance for this man son so when it's true those were while he was there Jesus came down out of the mountain a man where he was praying where he was separated completely under under the word for his day and for his hour a man and he came down from the mountain praise the Lord he wasn't under the influence of the world and the things of the world and the main wind in eastern listener and I turned to your disciples but they couldn't do anything and he and he said and Dennis I and Jesus just spoke the word a man and his son was delivered and the disciples coming although an alcoholic on we couldn't do it he said the cars of the Billy penny sure this can come and not for by by prayer and fasting amen it's a closer walk with God is giving God more and more and more preeminence in your life brother I tell you this is not saying I believe the message is going to put us in the rapture and in the resurrection no no it's giving it's giving the word more and more control in our lives amen so it's not you the living it is God in your living it is God in your making his word flesh it is God in your bringing his word to pass and it just it will just automatically automatically bring separation it'll bring images automatically bring a total separation onto the Lord amen because you're you can't think about anything else only what God has done what God is doing amen it's the Holy Ghost in you is the fullness of the Godhead bodily in you and brother if if it is Christ in you like that how in the world can you can you love the world or the things of the world amen because God God hates it amen ISA Bev I love that Esau have I hated that brother want to come in a connoisseur in a cultures fleshly righteousness may-maybe Esau he was far better than Jacob they look and look at what he did to get beget the blessing of his father and he pretended that he was Esau yeah cuz because the Isaac was blowing it and he couldn't see and so he you know they put skin on his arms because because Esau his brother he atari arms and so on and so they went in and he tried to talk like Esau act like Esau and when Isaac felt his arms he felt the the fur and figured it was he saw some hairy arms and so on and he gave him the blessing a man now he saw I didn't do anything like that but everybody what would they the thing of the war say Saul sold his birthright amen because they loved the world the world a man because what did he do he wanted to go on dating and then he went out on he know he came back he was hungry he wanted some food and it's we could go back hunting again and only that he wanted to get this for his father a man but somewhere there was a wrong spirit and a wrong attitude in him a man he didn't give God the preeminence again he gave his earthly father the preeminence a man he gave his earthly family the preeminence and not is heavenly family old my brother's sister Grace understand that when it comes to our earthly and natural family that that's that's all they were what made us like that serpent seed that is the result of servants II but we come from eternity and we have eternity and us we're going back to eternity and so therefore the family that was that with that we were a part of before the foundation of the world that's the family that we're in love with a married brothers sister but here is Esau he was cut off with it with Isaac as a natural father well I'll go and do this and I'll go into July but good works it's not works brother and that we do is to work the righteous of the Christ did and it's our faith it is our faith in the finished work of Calvary by the grace of Almighty God amen recognizing what Christ did Amen I'm saying because what Christ being brother I turn to this visitor this is this is what struck the Martin Luther this is what struck John Wesley a man it wasn't what they could do amen they thought if I do this and I do that I'll be sanctified I'll be justified and so on but then there was a conviction in their heart no you are not sanctified you are not just a fight a man you do not have that faith of sanctification to do not have the faith of justification amen so in trouble Luther and it troubled Wesley and so on today under the stage struck him and brother when they're faced trunk of a man they they were new creatures in Christ they were born again because the brother wasn't the the the word it was the spirit of the word when when when Martin Luther just as I said he when he went into that to the church and he opened the Bible amen because it back then the only Bibles was there was in the porch from the Catholic Church and he went into the church and he over the Bible and he opened it to when he opened it it came to man here Romans chapter five and he read the first verse oh man it's revelation the Spirit of God led him right to the word a man and a and he read the verse therefore being justified by faith it says we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ hey man that's the piece that it was a knew that were hunkering for that's the piece that Luther was searching for and he was he was doing works and yeah if I do this if I do this they it'll justify me if I do that it'll justify this but he never found everybody he did it and did it a day and still he didn't have peace with God any man under and I don't know how many years maybe it's a number of years that he was looking for it praying for it calling for it under that day that hour that moment that meant at that second that he went in and over the Bible and read that verse oh and a hallelujah praise the Lord how to Luther and brother when he read it and the Holy Ghost struck him and it became a revelation in his heart and he was born again hallelujah and he picked up I guess I said we would call it a pin but everybody know that I might have been a feather or something and Annie wrote right next to that verse he wrote alone we are justified by faith alone amen and we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen prese and brother hey what was the piece that he was seeking that he was justified before God Luther signify before God Amen so there God gave it to them and he was born again it was a revelation not not knowledge it was a revelation his heart note maybe he had read it before but this time a buddy was hungry and there's think you gotta want it you got you got to know it you gotta want it hey man sir God God let him this way and he went this way went that way I think maybe in in any in his natural life that Luther might have been a lawyer or trained as a lawyer senator I'm not sure but he was a very intellectual man and so on so brother the the the the letter of the word didn't help him the letter of the word didn't didn't strike him on the line I thought oh they gotta God let it go on and on and on - Otto the hunger and the thirst for justification increase and God is going to let it go on and on and on - the hunger the curse for the rapture increases in the bright Amen to the bride wants the rapture the bride wants the resurrection the bride wants to go home the bride wants to get out of here and get needy with the Lord Jesus Christ anybody because why because you're sick of all this scene you're sick of all this unbelief you're sick of this folder did this foolishness you're sick of the inventions of man anybody because it's getting closer and closer are getting you further further away from God and closer to the devil the probably cause that if time goes on and he says science these who is God let it go on it's a science for break into eternity that's right but God's not gonna let him go that far anyway because the god of this world brother the devil he's an eternity that's right well brother just think this is real God is real the devil is real God's angels are real you're to sleep even when Daniel who was praying for the revelation of the word for it for his hour the revelation what God has showed him and he I prayed I prayed and prayed and prayed for three weeks later he was and he was waiting on the answer under funny the angel came down anyway and now I always said I believe been praying for a long time yes he said and the angels were sent down but the devil was there in his angels to try and prevent them from getting to Daniel Amen and brother is at the dead angels are there to prevent God's angels forgetting down to Daniel they're there to prevent God's angels from getting to you a man sure they sure is Satan is their brother so we're praying the grace of God the Bible says the angels of God in camps around about those that fear the Lord hey man so pray the grace of God that the angels of God recant been around about you and me amen the Kiva's separated unto the Lord for the greater revelation the greater revelation don't we come to that perfect pain any man the others here for the resurrection of the rapture anything Jesus went on and on and on and on and on on to finally a man he got quiet on the finally he stopped the signs and wonders they stopped the preaching a man and then and he just a just went in any ayah praise the Lord who and he was on his way to Jerusalem and he went to this did this city and he went to this well where he was he was only focusing on the predestinated seat he was only focusing on the elect of God he wasn't going to go out there and preach to the world no more no no no he was going to focus on anybody focus on those are they appear to be decimated see and he may met that woman at the well and the disciples wouldn't go there because they're because of what she was guilty off and so on baby but she was a seed of God anyway the prophet of God said we're not going to reach everyone with this message he's a just the bride just the elect predestinated with the rapture in the resurrection but garthe's got somebody out there is going to witness to the world concerning the Lord Jesus Christ amen but they're not bride we got to understand that we believe that we are married that God called the Prophet to call of the brine God sent the problem with a message to separate the bride a man for the resurrection rapture as eventually back there 2,000 years ago the bridegroom was separated for what he was ordained to do amen so the bridegroom the bride is now separated for what she's ordained to do and that's the resurrection and the rapture the prophet of God said the Raider the God's waiting on us he said the residence of the dead in Christ are waiting on us he said for the resurrection amen godly is for the rapture and the change of our body he has come down a man in the Ministry of Malachi for in the OB of the seven seals in the third Pole it was the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds amen oh it's not just a cloud of angels they were with Jesus a man there were there were there was an angel come down to reveal to Daniel Daniel there what did the revelation he was seeking the understanding that he that he wanted a man hey there are other angels that came with him and why do dare to fight the devil off just think if the Angels had to fight the devil what are you and I got to do a man brother let's realize God is real yeah even a God is really did this he did this but it's understand true that the devil is real a man Shane this real just say your seeds Jesus Jesus saw him and Jesus talked to him face-to-face he died to Jesus face-to-face any man on the Mount of temptation if you are the son of God do this if you are the son of God do that if you're the son of God do that and so on old brothers sister Grace of God to us to see to see it as God wants us to see it a man not as religion wants us to see it not as this one wants us to see it or wants to see it as God wants us to see it and let it have the little add the effect in your life that God wants it to have a man a man that it had the control of your life that God wants it to have but we're not going to sell out for shekels and a shirt just straight that Levite that priest went into that house that was given over to idolatry but still still believing in God and gods oh brother what deception what deception and the same thing in this day in this hour brother god help us what an hour we're living it I thank God the window and when the by the grace of God when I visited my family and so on that they you know and they know what I believe they know what I've said before and if they got TVs and you got a television on he goes off oh yeah and we just sit down and chat and conversation is kept in order and and so on and then now it's getting to the place where they're saying please pray for us mm-hmm yeah pray for us so we commit them into the hands of the lord lord the grace of god in their lives any man i see if their bride do deal with a big with the message yeah well if not we'll just leave them and god and say god we got to look after god knows their spirit god knows their attitude yeah again was like one of my brothers one time in the in older one and and years and years ago i gave him a promise and that i do because i get might have been i don't yeah I guess we add it and got one here somewhere I promise you know what I'm talking about total sometimes those little little promises you have you get probably packs of them think abut on your table and maybe just read it one here read it one there and so on and I gave him a promise years ago years and and I also put it in a card that I sent I know what the card was might have been a birthday card and I man and I had a stamp and I stamped on the on the envelope don't wait for the hearse to take you to church and I stand that on the envelopes in the done and maybe standing on the card but I included this promise and some years later we met at a gathering Tories is in law's 50th wedding anniversary and and that was in Springdale and one point there this this dis brother particular brother came over to me he opened his wallet and he took out the promise and he said girl he said look he said this is what you gave me he said but I need another one he said he said I I've kept it in my wallet and he said it's starting to wear out and the words were starting to be rubbed off and so on but he kept it in his wallet and he said he said he said I want another one he said he said I appreciate if you could give me when I said I will a man so and right right to this day in this hour he has that respect a man but I leave him with the Lord I'm not gonna force this on them or that I don't I just leave my god a man a man is guided by the Holy Ghost that creates the hunger and thirst in his seat hey man it's a hunger search for the bride and God is going to satisfy it by giving you the bride what sure what would the faith that please was here and there's others out there hungry and thirsty for this and that's John God just give them that that's gonna take them through this life any man there were they're not bright so that's why the promise that we won't reach everyone with this message any minute but the bride is going to get the message because this message is ordained to give the bride resurrection wraps repaint anybody but that's why it's why when when when the angels came down a man he said he said that angel to Abraham and Sarah they were going to have a child that's the one that got to give her a promise to Abraham was there was a seed of God Abraham and Sarah but he sent two messages down to Sodom and Gomorrah anyway because they were seed down there - amen so you leave with that with the Lord brother III all god help us brother anybody I preached on it you're again a little while ago I a concerning remember Lot's wife Amen because there's many come out and look back eternally if you got the revelation in your heart hunger the thirsty knock you won't look back anyway because you got the revelation of perfect faith and you're looking ahead you're looking at him you're looking ahead stay on the straight and hey man the Strait is the gate narrow is the way to there be that find it hey man so there it is right there keep on going keep on going the devil is there to distract you and the devil is there to distract you the demons are so on though stay with stay on staying in line with the Word of God as Jesus stay in line a man he wouldn't be distracted he manages only though he got his attention eventually where cert was was this predestinated seat anyway this pretense later see that be destined a to see but he kept on going to Jerusalem a man for the third pole hey man so the only thing attracts us is is is the predestinated seed of God the brighter Christ we're going right on to the ranch the atmosphere where we're living in brother every minute I've seen a man is is bringing us comfort and encouragement I can't sir right the the atmosphere of this whole world I tear this a crazy world it there it's an insane way over there god help us it's getting to the place brother where as the Bible said the love of many shall wax cold deceiving and being deceived and look there's no respect for life no respect for life and not only that the one time respect and love that was between family members natural family members even that's going away it's not there not not there like it used to be no not by any means no I've met so many people and saying this saying this man and then they are at knowledge in it yeah the family is not like it used to be yeah I said that's the truth ice test scripts and the scripture fulfilled and I think when somebody I'm not sure if somebody when we were in the supermarket there the week our brother David was with us and we met we met three people no I didn't know him but they knew me you know one and this one knew me and I said I don't remember you and I was only around 12 years old when when they they were identified with one of my brothers it was it was his one time if she was his girlfriend but she came and talked to us and she said she knew me and after all those years way back in 1961 and so on and and she had told me who she was and and she said I wish I was your brother's girlfriend and she told me what her brother wallets and so on and all she said but your mother broke us up he said I got a Russia she respected my mother she says she was in control and he said did she and she said and the family listened to her she said all I know that she said all the family listen to her I said yes I know and but she said she had respect and she was she had a right attitude and right spirit she said she was good well she said she broke us up and I said well I said the will of God be done and and now that she herself is is sick and and she got cancer so which they brought god bless yes and there was another lady there too and then we went on around the store the other side of the store and another lady Oh Gerald and Betty who you oh she says you don't know me no well she said mine she said we met years ago she said when you lived in Bureau it's a long time ago you know the bureau said yeah and then she said you did this you did that she said and I did this and I did that oh yes she was a nurse at the time and now hear that she's still a nurse is she in her seventies and she's still nursing oh well I said god bless you all they appreciate it they respected us they knew our faith and so on any man but I pray God all this brother sister we commit him to the Lord and move on by the grace of God amen so which I do a couple of times we mentioned just just get bit with a witness to them oh well then Lord did this or Lord did that and so on you know concerning our faith and so on yeah where they respect it yeah yeah yeah yep yeah they weren't only nothing against us so brother-sister but the message apparently the message is not for them she listens if your little elected seed if your predestinated seed we don't have to gluten fight you we don't have to fight you to get you to believe the message we don't go to argue with it it gets you believe the message if you're a Prius a seat you're gonna oh oh praise the Lord that's good uh yeah I believe that that's right that's the word yeah but now the others out there God - gonna deal with them as he had the deal with lot and his family gonna deal with them in a little different way - yet did they had that battle but brother when that angel they are God Almighty God in flesh talking to Abraham no problem anybody's word abraham believed his word anybody and intercede for a lot doing it or see for those that were done in Sodom and Gomorrah oh there's going to be this many there will you destroy it no he said I want if there's this many buddy destroy it no I want on down to ten five if there's this many no I won't destroy it but he's the messengers for there and do what and and there was less than what Abraham had set sail and the angels brought them out amen and brother as I say oh thank god oh thank God for the word brother as he said if there's if he says a certain time to be no flesh state maybe it didn't shorten time in Sodom and Gomorrah then we know Sublette no flesh saved that's right and just thinking even in the days of Noah there's only there's only no on his family and not all them were predestinated not all them were elected no no no one of them God cooked after he come out of the guy had it out of the the ark God and he went on into sin God cut him off he must have a surface heat that's right the pilot of God said he said the seat of God can give birth to a serpent seed and he says sir fancy couple can give birth to a seat of God praise the Lord hallelujah Amen thank God for the revelation of the word any man that is God that's working in us it's God that's working with us by grace hey man I said what was the scripture was it Exodus amen he invited me members of Scripture where judges oh yes judges I got a right area yeah I was reading judges amen by the grace of God so brothers sister time is getting near where I have to bring it to a conclusion but listen Saints I believe God's already spoken most definitely III wasn't thinking those things that's that what the Lord gave me as I've been ministering amen amen brother again as I said I can't die I don't do it and I can't do it and that's go by notes that's right others I know there's no authors they got to stay with notes and so on but I can't do it I never been able to do that this is I got to follow his leadership amen I read judge of seventeen the other scripture turn with me to the st. Luke's Gospel chapter 4 st. lous Gospel chapter 4 amen praise the name of the Lord and still not getting into the rapture message because there are very very very significant quotes in the rapture oh yeah so brother listen let's be on our guard let's be on our toes this experience reminded us so we're not going to miss the revelation of the rapture amen many are going to miss it like you're like it's like you said it's in the scriptures where's the rapture it already happened you didn't know it just what it having you didn't know it why what do you mean I didn't know what I knew what God and then maybe they would say I knew God sent Malachi for I knew the seven seals are open I knew this I knew that yeah but you didn't go on to the perfect faith of the rapture you had to go on to perfect faith for the rapture god help us brother we need he preached it August I believe 63 preached it that we need perfect thing for the rapture and he said it means a lot of breaking shaking down a lot of shaking down for you and me but people don't want that kind of preaching people just just focus on this just focus on that you know impersonal that's all doctrinal no brother God's doing something so God's going to focus on us hey man it's the resurrection rapture not religion no he wants to something he wants to do so we got to focus on us by grace brother he focused on Noah Noah oh thank god no I walk with God he not walk with God was raptured and that's what God's looking looking for and you and me walk with God me man and why because God is in full control what makes what makes that person live like that why did he do this what did he do that well it's God that's walking in them and they're headed for the rapture hey man now Noah God walk with Him but I tell you brother he believed God because God asked him to do something that was crazy in the eyes of the world he did it amen he prophesied things that they'd never seen before this was going to happen this is going to happen and he would have built the ark them him and his family and so on well praise the Lord I remember a film one time they filmed it about Noah building the ark and all that and they were having a supper they went inside and Noah's wife had supper and she said - oh she said I'm wondering - and Noah and so what are you worried about she said well she said what are we gonna put over over all she said when the rain comes because back then they never had the how was it like we have today and so on because they never had no rain that's right they lived in tents the prophet of God said who built ours who started building houses he said was King yeah others lived lived in - lived in caves of the earth and so on but it was Cain that went out started to build houses they would haven't started builders they were they were getting turning after after this this this group this culture and that culture and they started to build houses here and I already did Esau maybe and so on but so brothers sister don't copy the world whatever God wants you to have be content that's like I said this is tremendous him a tent or a cottage why should I care but I said people do here yeah they do they certainly don't want to ten a lot don't want a cottage do you want to mention god help us brother in st. lous Gospel chapter 4 and verse 1 and B in Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost well the Holy Ghost was made flesh in him returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness follow God's leadership but the people want the pleasures of this world more than they want the wilderness of the will of God being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he didn't eat nothing and when they were handed he afterward hungered amen brother Bob made reference to the bread and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread if you're the son of God well you can do this you can do this you can have this you can have that and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone amen you're not going to live by the natural things of life but most people are looking for the natural things of life working for the natural things of life focusing on the natural things of life amen but what would the spiritual grace he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word every word now God holds us responsible for every word a man for every generation he held them responsible for every word up to that hour up to that point now look at the word he's almost responsible for the end just saying concerning his ministry the end of his ministry nearing the third pole of his ministry they said Lord what are the signs of the coming and one of the greatest signs is deception take heed that no man deceive you because he would deceive he said the very elect please be on your guard spiritually give God preeminence not the world not your flesh not this life but the world to come call it Elvis man shall not live by bread alone the natural things of life but by every word of God the spiritual you got it what you do you you're gonna feel little the Lord to do it you're gonna be you're gonna be led by the spirit sons and daughters of God led by the Spirit of God and they're walking in the spirit they're living in the spirit by the grace of God it's not how to remember the the prophet of God said you can have the you can have the Holy Ghost on you 24 hours a day and he said then go to hell why because you don't have the Holy Ghost in you yeah and he said the person can be healed and go to hell that's true because that's all they're believing but brother the Bride of Christ not my will father oh oh brother what a trouble what lay ahead he said not my will but thine be done and knowing what lays ahead for the bride how many it's really really honestly from their hearts you're gonna say Lord not my will don't be done as I said at eight or a college an engineer or a janitor why should I care I'll led to be honest I just did what God wanted me to do I was a janitor - that's right and I was a cook and there was a time when I worked in a certain store and and III when I know I used to have gluten bringing those buddy-cop those carts and you did I said oh yeah I did well there's not much you haven't done no it's not much I said but I said I just well I just followed these leadership not my will father thine be done amen brother yeah so grace to his brother the janitor yes janitor but again like I said I never took breaks or anything like that I always wondered why they did I told you at the time I was working I went in took a break and and two of the two managers who were there at the time they come in sister are you sick I said no they say oh you're taking a break I said well I just come in and see what it felt like I said everybody has to can't wait I said to get into a break in the morning can't wait to get a break in the afternoon so I said I said what does it feel like so I said just come and see what it felt like I said I don't need it I said I said I'm not using a pick and a shovel I saw only using a pen I'm only using this or that or something else I said I don't need a break but that's the world we live in yeah brother you if you're there to take breaks like that well I tell you Jesus never took a break and when it comes to breaking like that he did say come aside and rest awhile but considering the spirit that was did the the burden that was on Jesus he needed the rest but when it comes to the burden of a lot of work today you don't need wrong you don't need no break no no and it's like like I was told they said they said mr. loss or a journal they says it's amazing but you know David they agree with me they said and they said this was just one there that you're working with it yeah they said if his pen if his pen Chris tastes stay stood up he said when I come break time he said he just leave his pin there he could be writing but he said he'd just leave his pen there he said go take a break so what oh yeah he said he wouldn't even bother he said to put his pen away someone order or to finish what he was writing oh that's that's that's insane that's the insane world we live in well thank God for His grace to his brothers sister listen let me finish with this I gotta go cuz and I was endeavoring to bring it out but never got to it on last service I was ministering on job eternal life death and eternal life God asked Joe where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth and the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy but when God laid the foundations of the earth the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy where were you Joe well Joe got the revelation he was there a man and originals and what happened in the Garden of Eden he bypassed his theophany and he came forth in flesh but he was going to go back to his theophany in the presence of God again amen and wait for a glorified body and maybe he's already got the glorified body when Jesus rose from the dead and the Saints arose went into the city appeared to many amen then when Jesus went up they went up amen because the because they you know did they go up yeah because when they got outside the city they said open up the everlasting gates let the King of glory come in and the angels were saying King of glory who's the King of glory and they said the Lord strong and mighty mighty in battle they said he is the king of glory so the gates opened not opened up and the Lord no doubt their directors Saints of the old testament winning with him praise the Lord hallelujah well Elijah and so are Elijah or the others that were resurrected in the Old Testament they were already there a man but waiting for a glorified body so brother we come from eternity we got subject to death we by pastor our theophanies and what word that were going back to eternity we're coming back by the baptism of the Holy Ghost were put put in contact with our theophany and there's pulling us into eternity by the grace of God into a glorified body and that comes by way of the rapture as it was 2,000 years ago for the Jews so it is now for the Gentiles the grace of God be with us brother amen so we'll get more of the revelation of the rapture the Lord willing next Sunday I was opened it may be brother John would give his testimony this Wednesday so if he's not working so the Lord bless you amen God again to remind you man shall not live by bread alone the natural things of life but by the by the entire every word of God amen just think every word that's that's tremendous god help us that we're gonna stay with the word be governed by the word controlled by the word we're gonna be convicted by the word Amen god
