but praise the lord jesus got the victory over the world he got the victory over the flesh he got the victory over the devil amen and he's come back to give us the victory over the world the flesh amen the devil amen so we through our lord jesus christ we've got the victory over death hell and the grave praise the lord amen let's believe god brother as we as we go into his word today and the lord willing will uh maybe hear the prophet of god minister just it's a not not a very long sermon and uh he ministered on it some years ago and it's called demonology in the physical realm that we had to deal with the devil brother from the fall well even before the fall adam and eve dealt with the devil and right now and ever since the fall we've been dealing with the devil in the flesh oh yeah so pray the grace of god that god in our souls is giving us victory over the world over the flesh over the devil amen through our lord jesus christ through the finished work of calvary oh brother to know that we have been redeemed and we are being redeemed we will be redeemed praise the lord what it's called pray is to get us back where we come from it's to get us back into into that body praise the lord like unto his glorified body praise the lord for where we're not not subject to sin no more when or we're not experiencing it no more we don't experience death no more amen because jesus came and paid the price jesus came and did what he did to give us the victory oh yeah well i'm not a sinner no more i'm a saint well that's good we got power over over the world and we got power over the flesh i trust you have there's too many that are still controlled by their flesh amen and it's the enemy that's working through that flesh but i trust that brother sister we're working by the grace of god out of our souls it is christ in me the hope of glory amen and again i trust by grace that you got this experience so you can say and you can at least say amen to it and you you know it you believe it brother it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me is that the kind of life you're living amen is that your attitude is that your spirit amen so that it hallelujah showing that you have been born again you have been born again on the inside of the inside and god is brother what he worked in what god works in through a new birth god is working out praise the lord to afford to bri to bring into us into a glorified body like honda is glorious body amen that what we're in we're in we have victory over the world victory over the flesh and brother victory over the devil amen so i pray grace of god let go let god have his way amen let go and let god have control in your heart and in your soul let go and let god have control in your life amen so you oh yeah so that you you really you really believe it and you really mean it and you can you can go you go out and live it what it's not me living is christ is that the life you live in is that is that what you're reflecting is christ in you the hope of glory praise the lord so i pray grace in the name of jesus amen give us that absolute complete revelation that we need brother that we'll enter into eternity by the grace of god amen it's not going down it's not going down to the grave going down to hell going down to torment no amen we're going to we're going to leave here and go to eternity with our lord jesus christ praise the name of the lord because now i've given control of everything to him that's tremendous brother sister i trust my grace that your life is a vindication that you've given everything controlled to him amen that's not and again that in the life you are living it's not you that lives is christ that liveth in you amen you're giving control to him amen so that he's working out the flesh he's working out the devil he's working out sin he's working in righteousness on to eternal life praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord not just believing what he did what's he doing amen thank you lord for what you did good he said would you let me do it in you amen oh lord you did this you laid down the life picked up again now he said i want to i want to lay it down in you and pick it up again amen by the grace of god hallelujah he has come back to to reveal it in us he has come back to take control of us to get us back where we come from we come from eternity we're going back to eternity amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah so god be the glory as we go into the word this morning amen again as i said it'd be a short message and again it's on demonology but it's demonology in the physical realm it's it's working and and for having to deal with satan in our flesh having to deal with satan in this in this whole nature amen jesus come to give us power over the world power over the flesh power over the devil amen what for we got eternal life amen the life that he had he come back to share that life with us amen god help us we're not religious we're spiritual praise the lord the devil's religious oh yes right from the beginning he was religious and he says the bible told says concerning satan he said you've been in the in the garden of god you're walking up and down in the coals of fire you did this you did that oh yeah amen and he came down and deceived eve oh brother i pray grace he will not deceive us amen god allowed him god permitted it for a reason god what for why did god allow all this why is all this going on god allowed us so he could show his love to his seed he could show his love to his sons and daughters amen that amen allowing what he allowed they would come this way amen and and they would they would recognize their need of him amen and he came down in flesh amen so well through prophet after prophet after prophet until finally it was the god prophet in our lord jesus christ to redeem us amen now he's bringing us back bringing us back bringing us back amen praise the lord till one day hallelujah this will be gone and we'll be in a new heaven and a new earth oh brother see the the reason why god allowed it all i pray grace that he's working out that reason in you and in me he's bringing it out amen he's showing his love for his seed and i trust where he's he's getting the response of our love for him he wants us to love him not just because he's god not because he's he's up there and he's bigger and he's this and he's powerful he wants us to love him for whom he who he is for himself love him for his nature amen love him for his love amen that is he laid down his life for us we laid out our lives for him and for one another amen see this is why god allowed it he wanted to bring in a a loving relationship a close relationship it's not just because well he's god so we're going to worship him because he's god he's powerful but we're not he's he's in control no he revealed his character his nature and he brought out love in us oh lord we love you considering what you've done concerning what you're doing and what you will do we love you i pray god you do not ever do your love relationship with jesus now the whole oh lord i was lost and i was a sinner and you saved me thank you lord you must have loved me do you love him love it see with peter jesus three times and he said love us thou me more than these and he and he said he was referencing human love physical love but then he he narrowed it down to spiritual holy ghost love divine love love amen because if there's anything in the seed of god and the sons and daughters of god it's not physical love it's divine love love us thou me more than these praise the lord i trust amen i trust that's what brings us here not religion not just think oh i want to be saved so i'm going to go to church i'm going to believe this and i'm going to believe that you you come because you love him amen thank god for what he's done thank god for what he's revealed amen pray thank god for what he's doing amen to get us back into fellowship with him in eternity and loving because listen he wants a loving relationship a real really not because you got to because you want to some things there's many a christian today think oh i got to do this i'm a christian i can't do this because i'm a christian well if you've got a real relationship with him you love him and you don't want to offend him no no it's your love this you're motivated by divine love amen because the greatest stuff that he went on through the scriptures concerning the gifts and the gifts and the gifts when people think this is the greatest this is the greatest order's wonderful i got this i got that do you have the greatest which is love divine love loveth thou me and he said now abideth faith hope charity the greatest of these is love charity divine love amen because grace produces love our love produces grace and grace produces the revelation we need to get us home to be with him amen let go let god have his way in your life give god control amen god bless you amen turn with me in your bible to matthew chapter 4 and we'll go into the message on demonology and again i said it's not not a long message and for our brother beisel that you would start on paragraph eight in demonology june the sixth 1963 amen and his demonology in the physical realm june 6 1963 and so ask our brother to start at paragraph eight and we'll go on to paragraph one zero seven amen and in matthew chapter four verse 1 then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil amen that's the truth and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and god allows the enemy sometimes to tempt us but to bring out the revelation of the word that's in our hearts amen concerning what jesus was experiencing in the mind of temptation it brought out the word the word it is written it is written it is written amen brother in all that the enemy does to you the only the only weapon that we have to defeat the enemy is the word satan it's written get thee behind me satan amen and again verse 4 he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen and then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and sitteth them on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written amen yeah then the enemy quoted the scripture that's right he took jesus up and said no no jesus it's written because jesus highlighted the scripture the word to the devil it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god now the enemy is going to quote the scripture to him but it's going to take it out of balance out of out of text and so on the way that the way that god meant it oh yeah don't let the devil quote the word to you and say this or this the bible says this yeah you're right satan yeah but make sure it's it's you keep it in the way that god wants it amen the enemy is there to take it out of context to add this to add that to get yours or get you to believe this get you to believe that well that's good but what is the will of god it revealed in it so verse 6 again and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for yeah yeah he goes back to the word satan yeah it is written it shall give his angels charged concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee of lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone amen yes it is but it's got to be in the will of god god's way amen and jesus saith unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god amen there's many a time when believers tempt god tempt god to do this tim god they'll go out and do this and and it's not the will of god god don't want him to do it as satan's influencing your life oh well that's sorry the lord will be with me and the lord yeah if it's his will he'll be with you but make sure you're in his will make sure you're under under his leadership amen so that it's not it's not the devil you're listening to that it's god you're listening to because satan will quote the word as well as the lord amen he will but make sure it's the will of god amen oh praise the lord amen and jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god don't tempt god with what you do or what you don't do don't tempt god into the well if i do this god will do this if i yes if it's my will if it's god will for you to do that he'll be with you and he'll be there to help you but if it's not his will you'll pay the price you'll suffer oh yeah god help us to have that wisdom brother again wisdom wisdom we need the wisdom of god amen not just the knowledge of the the letter of the word what we need the wisdom of god is leadership what the will of god what he wants us to do when he wants us to do it where he wants us to do it how he wants us to do it let's be led by the spirit amen amen verse 8 and again the devil taketh them up into an exceeding eye mountain amen see the power of satan be careful come back to the word make sure it's the will of god amen just think this is what satan was doing to jesus amen he did this he did that and then he took him up into an exceeding eye mountain yeah and see we think oh we had this experience that experience that if it could be god nor can be satan make sure any experience you have that it's god if it's god it'll bring you back to line up with the word stay with the word don't add to it don't take from it again the devil taking them up into an exceeding eye mountain and show them all the kingdoms of the world oh my so have you got a vision make sure it's god not satan he can give you visions too you can give your dreams he can give you feelings make sure whatever it is it's according to the word it's not going to cause you to to move away from the word it's not going to cause you to compromise on the word no no grace for the will of god yes he showed him all the kingdoms of the world oh my and the glory of them amazing oh people think i had this experience i had that experience make sure it's god not the devil amen and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will fall down and worship me yeah and then said jesus unto him get the end satan for it is written oh brother defeat the enemy not with your feelings with the word amen you want to get the victory over satan no you better know the word and be under the control of the holy spirit it is written it is written it is written amen oh it's not satan satan i don't agree with you i don't think this i don't think that no no the word don't tell satan what you're thinking just give him the word amen and then say jesus unto him get thee in satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve see what jesus is the what's the example that he's given us stay with the word no matter what you're you that you feel oh i feel that to do this i feel to do that you better make sure it's according to the word and will of god amen okay lord i feel that it's you so i'll go and do this because according to your word and it's for your glory i'll do it in your time in your way amen but sometimes the enemy is there and he'll quote the word he quoted the word amen amen don't think the enemy is there to take just so he's not going to say the word he's not going to mention the word oh yes he'll if you're a believer if you're a christian amen he's going to quote the word to deceive you no wonder the bible says make your calling and your election sure by the word amen from genesis to revelation if the enemy says this you better make sure that it's the thought and motive and nature of god from genesis to revelation amen that is not you know god's doing this there but he didn't do it back here he and he and he didn't do it here in in revelation or or in the new testament brother the word thy word have i hid in my heart amen thus saith the lord that i might not sin against the lord might not disbelieve him disbelieve his word and go and do what i want to do religiously let's be led by the spirit and be spiritual not religious there's too many that are just religious and it's a religious spirit but brother i pray we're spiritual and we have the holy spirit in control amen and again in verse 10 jesus saith unto him get thee in satan and again it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god in him only shalt thou serve amen but here's satan displaying his power and his anointing and trying to get jesus to worship going to get jesus to worship him brother he'll try to get you to worship him amen and you think you're worshiping god but brother it is a god but it's not the god grace to us amen brothers there's anything that the world's dealing with is many gods oh yeah they have gods amen brother it could be their vehicle it could be their home it could be their life it could be their job it could be their money amen or it could be their church yeah it's more important to them than god yeah their religion more important to them to the word oh i believe this i believe that well it is written do you believe that it is written grace of god and then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him and i'll tell you this if you take your stand for the word of god you stay with the word of god there will be angels there to minister to you and help you and strengthen you and encourage you oh yeah i i've experienced many things down through the years i'm 74 years old and after all those years brother amen i could go back and tell you what i experienced there what i experienced there i i dealt with the devil there and i dealt with god here amen praise the lord really god dealt with me i trust god is dealing with you in your soul and in your spirit amen so brother you're not not under satan's influence but under god's influence you can be religious very religious and still under satan's influence oh yes because he'll come he's not going to it's not altogether denying the word of god but he's going to add to the word or he's going to take away from the word amen but brother we need to leave the word the way that god give it and let god make the word flesh in you it was flesh in jesus he wants now he comes through the power anointing of the holy ghost he said i'll be with you even in you i'll be with you even in you amen by the grace of god by the holy ghost what for now is the word in it was a word in flesh and jesus now it's the word and flesh in you amen and i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee so the grace of god brother i pray that god has preeminence his word has got preeminence in your heart and in your soul amen let's not give turn over influence to satan and demonology because again brother brown did minister on demonology in the physical realm and demonology also brother in the religious realm amen so brother sister we want to make sure that we got the anointing of the holy ghost not satan amen and oh yeah he can make he make he can make you oh feel good and feel that why with his power with his anointing with his presence yeah what's he doing he's trying to trying to imitate god as it were and deceive you oh i'm the lord i'm this and i'm that brother just just think when god in the beginning in adam and eve and he came down and gave his word then the enemy came over through the serpent and he began to say this and say this do this do this yeah what was he focusing on he was focusing on the flesh he's focusing on the natural things of life oh yeah and satan can can bless you this way and bless you that way when it comes to the physical things of life oh yes he's he's he can do that oh yeah he offered to do it for jesus do this do this and so on oh brother sister let go and let god have his way make sure that whatever you feel led to do and the anointing in your life come back and see make sure it's going to keep you in the word and then line you up with the word more and more oh yeah because if it's god in you i'll tell you this no matter what what you're led to do it'll be according to the word he will not anoint you the lord will not anoint you or cause you to do something that's contrary to his will contrary to his word god's grace to us amen so the lord bless you and bless the going forth of the word let's stand and let's sing only believe as we go to the word or our brother visual there again it's demonology june 6 1963 amen and we'll start at paragraph 8 brother advice and going on to paragraph 1 the end of paragraph 107 so that god's grace be with us and let's let god give us the revelation we really need in these last days because

more and we'll talk to dad's mother now about something we're going to talk on demonology in psalms 100 and 3 1 to 3 we read these verses most every minister clergyman or bible reader knows them by heart bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all of these benefits who forgive us all of thine iniquity who healeth all of thy diseases i want you to notice there it was in all who forgive us all thine iniquities who health all of our diseases how can we bow our heads just a moment a heavenly father we thank you this afternoon for being out here we thank thee for these little children that's sitting around they're the man of tomorrow and women if there is a tomorrow if jesus tarries and now father we pray that that you'll bless us now as we're talking now on your word and about the great enemy we have satan we pray god that you'll let us uh put a front out a mechanized unit here the power of god that will withstand the night in every inch of his ground lord and showing that he don't have no legal rights at all that christ defeated him in our stood there at calvary when he died and he spoiled principalities and robbed satan of ever ever his power that he had and god gave us wisdom and understanding now to know and to explain to the people how that they might know how to be healed and to defeat satan in jesus name we pray amen now for a few minutes we go to speak on demonology you hear so much about demons now tomorrow afternoon we'll probably finish up i wanted two days of this week anyhow to preach on this just uh or two days for afternoon services uh to talk on this now the first thing what a demon is you hear so many people talking about a demon well now a demon devil all comes from one word and in the english it's called tormentor a fellow that torments is a devil a evil one he say now the bible today is to most to many people is some old backed book that grandpa and grandma read or something like that there's not much to it it's for the old folks and so forth but that's wrong it's for everybody and demons are tormentors that torment us now there is demons that comes into the soul of man and that is in the phraseology that would be that would be in the i'd say thistle the demon that comes into the soul is uh something that torments the soul many times you can see a person maybe of insanity now they may be yet a converted person feel with the holy spirit and yet be totally insane see that's right that has nothing to do with the soul it's a tormentor something that torments them now all sickness we have to find first that all sickness came from the devil god is not the author of sickness no sickness comes from god god sometimes permits satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of god when you've disobeyed but sickness in its beginning come from the devil could you imagine a person would believe that god our heavenly father would be the author of such a thing as sickness and death but no he isn't never was never will be god permits death because of disobedience god permits death as one writer said all that death can do god harnessed it to a buggy and it pulls us into the presence of god a believer but a the word death means separation jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him and sent me hath everlasting life and he said i am the resurrection life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and we pack the bodies of each other over the saintlets of our graves but he shall never die now if you watch when he spoke of lazarus he said lazarus sleepeth the disciples man like we are they said oh if he sleepeth he'd do as well he meant taking a rest what they thought but he'd come and talk to them in their language he said he's dead what you believe but said i go waking waking see when you're uh death means separate now if one of you should one of your family die or something he is if it's converted they're not dead they're dead in a humanistic standpoint but they're just separated from us but they're in the presence of god they're not dead and they can't die it's impossible for them to die jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him and sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death to life so he can't die anything it's immortal eternal it can't perish it's imperishable life he's got it because god has given to him and not not meritorious it's with it's unconditional god gives it to him god calls no man could come to god except god called him jesus said no man can come to me except my father calls him draws him is that right so it's god and all maybe tomorrow afternoon we'll get a little bit more on that because i want to get this thing of disease to you so that you'll see that there was a time when our we become germatized and our great grandfather you know that doctor knows that well you do to you bible readers you know the germ of life started in your great grandfather to becoming a germ and come out to your grandfather then into your father and then to your mother and where you are now that's right scripture even teaches that here's the scripture for if y'all uh i believe it said that levi paid tithes when he was in the lawns of abraham which was his great-grandfather is that right so see the germ become back there but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world and god created man in his own image spirit of man not a man in his own image but man in his own image see and then he made them male and female before he ever had a man in the dust the earth which we had a chance this afternoon take a time and go back into that you'll see how god now it's between the line but when you see it comes right up with the line thing how did god back in the beginning what he did there and how he moved down into the earth and how that he made man in his image and then god turned around was made in the image of man to redeem man now when god made man in his they meant she was a spirit man and then there was no man to tell the sorrow that he created man how to dust the earth our chronologists and so forth and these people search and get old bones and so forth and believe in evolution i believe in the right kind of evolution man evolutes from himself but not all from one cell no sir because a a bird has been a bird ever since god made him a bird and a monkey's been a monkey a man's been a man that's right now i was talking to a doctor here a while back in louisville he said while reverend brown was talking about how the navies of africa how they eat just go down but oh some of the awful things you'd ever see how they would eat just pick up things that's contaminated maggots in it just shake them around making all don't make any difference to him see they said drink anything don't make any difference what it is he said but reverend brown that people are not human i said oh yes they are they sure are human i said the closest thing to a human being in the beast line is a chimpanzee and you tried for four thousand years to get one mutter out of that japanese and he can't do it i said because he can't think he has nothing to think with or you can learn in little things like a horse g and hor or put on glasses or smoke a cigar or balance yourself on a bicycle ride a horse or something like that but just like gian hall to a horse or to a dog or something like that i said he's an animal but you let me go back in africa to the wildest tribe they got and that's the little tribe of the bushman now i said probably his great great great great grandfather never saw a white man or nothing the only thing that he knows he don't even know which is right and left hand the only thing he knows is he and he's trying to get his hands off it's human flesh anything else it'll make a difference to him just so he eats but let me get him at five years old and at 15 years old he'll speak good english and have a good education why he's got a soul god made him a human being and he's got just as much right to hear the gospel at least once as we have preaching around here all over america the people over and over and over begging persuading and everything letting here at one time and watch him scream and run to the altar real quick see yes sir that's what my heart is brother today when i think of africa and that poor little black hands raising up saying brother branham one more time about jesus oh mercy there's something in me digs and burns just as quick as i get money enough up i get over there too that's what i do with every penny i get everything god knows besides just what i can eat and most people give me my clothes and just what i can barely live by myself just as close as i can i thought right into missionary funds which the government has ranged i don't even pay income tax on it to get up three or four five thousand dollars and take a cross over there and preach the gospel to the people that i know that that day i'll have to answer now know what i answer far i used to want to go in the city and hold a big meeting back when they had lots of money and to have great campaigns and thousands of dollars i'd give it over to red cross and so forth uh not enough no slam to them but coming down the street in a four thousand dollar car the big diamond stud zone smoking a cigar 500 a week on the money that sick people no sir no indeed not only as soon as you get out of the city instead of holy rollers and everything like that and making fun and down in the religion that we're standing up for no sir i take it myself and before god is my judge i put it in the gospel work counter so i know it on that day that uh when i have to give an account for my stewardship it's given correctly that's exactly right because i realize is i treat the people i'm treating god just my attitude towards you is my attitude towards christ your attitude towards me is the same thing that's right towards christ now the sea of people like that and see how that a human being man with an immortal soul now that can't die can't perish can't do nothing but have everlasting life that god sovereignly in his own will gave it to you and now then now i for let me correct this just a little bit or say something somebody's going to go and say brother brown is a calvinist no i'm not i'm a calvarist as long as calvinist is in the bible but when calvinist gets out of the bible then i'm an armenian see i believe in holiness and i believe in calvinists too but both of them one run out on the limb and went this way and one right on the limb and went that way if it wasn't for the book of ephesians to bring it back and put it in the right place where god did we'd all be all mixed up but they both got a doctrine but they go to seed on it each one that's the holiness and the calvinist ii the armenian now calvinist has something true i believe that that the calvinistic doctrine i believe this in security i believe the church has eternal security any reader the bible knows that because god's already said it with a period or without blemish is that right then it's going to be there is that right the by the church is eternally secured now are you in the church is the next thing if you're in the church all right you're secured with the church but you better stay in the church and how do you get in the church by shaking a hand no put your name in the book no sir by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body god judged the calvary was the body of jesus christ and we're baptized into that body by one spirit we have eternal security as long as we're in the body of christ nothing can separate us nothing can touch us if you go out you go out by your own will but just as sure if you're in the body of christ as sure as jesus rose from the dead you'll rise to god's already done that he you can't sin or you do i might be a sinner in your sight but if i'm in christ god don't see it because his sins atones his blood atones from my sins there see i can't sin he just born god does not commit sin for you cannot sin the seed of god remains in him see he's willing to if he's makes a mistake sure he's right then willing to confess it if he's a real christian he will do it if he holds it back he shows he ain't got nothing in the first place that's right he hasn't got nothing to begin with but if he's a real christian right here you plant a grain of wheat in the ground it'll always be a grain of wheat cockle birds may be all around and everything else but it'll be a grain of wheat as long as it stands is that right and if a man's really born to the spirit of god he isn't in and out and back and forth you know in the world and i hear no sir no no you're not a coca bird one day and a grain of wheat the next day god don't have that in the field yes sir if you're born to the spirit of god you're a christian from that time until until you go away and then your you're immortal with god that's right if you're in the church now now let's talk about the death side now how could a person on that estate and that kind of a condition ever be sick because that your body is not yet redeemed your body is not redeemed no matter how much how good you are and how saintly and how holy how much holy spirit that's only your soul and your soul is not completed yet it's just got the blessing the promise of god which is the earnest of our salvation but now if we have no earnest of our resurrection no divine healing then i have no assurance or nothing to prove to me that there is a resurrection just like if christ doesn't live in my heart if i have to take it from some kind of a psychological uh thing backyard i had to believe somewhere like that well then i i'd be a little skeptical of it and that's reason over in africa when they come here come missionaries up bringing thousands of those natives and this packing little mud idols and everything else is because that they had just heard the psychic side of the bible that's right my own churches baptist methodist presbyterian all went in there but when they seen the power of god coming demonstration that settled it they know then that god was god but now what starts this sickness now the first thing it's a spirit before it becomes a disease just the same as you as a spirit before you become a human being now i'm going to take brother willits here as an example brother willits uh there was a time when you and i wasn't nothing and then the first thing god gave us a life and let's take if i take your body down this afternoon you're made up of a bunch of cells held together with atoms and now uh someday them atoms will be destroyed if jesus tarries you'll go on back they'll be just like there was in the beginning go back into the air but when your spirit returns those atoms will gather together again with this spirit and bring forth another brother willis just like that only younger when he was at his best when a man gets past about 25 years old he finds a few wrinkles under his eyes and some gray hairs coming in it's going to be because this after you and one of these days is going to take you no matter who you are it's going to take you but if gradually you'll get in a corner here and god will get you out of that corner you get in this corner here death will almost have you over here but after a while it'll get you but then what death can do it takes its full toll and then at when it's done all it can do when god gave you this life and used at your best at about 23 when you come into the resurrection you'll come back just exactly like he was when he's 23 years old 25 for death set in death will have everything that it can do it's set in there but you'll come right back where you were now if each one of your your cells in your body let's take it down now you come sell after sell sell after selling lay it apart you're on a platform after each cell in your body you'll come down to one little tiny germ where you begin can be seen with a natural eye you have to look under scope glasses i've seen the germ of life under a microscope it looks like a little bitty thread and the first thing starts is right in the spine it's like a little knot that's the first little cell accumulates on top of a cell now if i had to take that one single little cell that every one of you come from one little teeny cell germ what is a germ a germ is a little teeny the smallest of cell well what's after that now i've talked you down from every piece of you down to this one little cell and i haven't found you yet i've just got your cells laid out well then next thing blood cells and flesh cells and whatever they are laying them all out here but i haven't got you yet now i'm down to one germ now well i'm going to take that little cell apart now where you at your life and the life makes the first cell which is a germ then everything after its nature dog after dog bird after bird manager man develop and sell sell on sell sell on cell comes up to where you are human being developing of cells now that was ordained of god to be so but now what about a cancer let's talk of him a little bit now god gave you your life and say here you are today here i am there's there's nothing on my hand but there might be a cancer on my hand sometimes well how's that cancer get there let's see what the cancer is now let's take him apart let's go take him now he's a bunch of cells too did you know that tumor cataract any of those things are cells they don't have no form some of them spreads out and some looks like a spider and some looks run streaks a red cancer just like long red threads that runs through and then these are rolls cancer which usually comes on of the breasts of a woman it's like pancakes laying on one another and then he go scrabbling out they just grow anywhere sometimes tumors are lopsided this way long oblong and everything they have no form because they're after a spirit which has no form but it's the developing of cells it's a bunch of cells that say in you right now is a tumor or cancer this developing cells growing growing growing it's eating sucking your life from you living on the bloodstream cataract takes the mucus of the eye and grows right over covers yourself over shut your eyes off some of them comes and never gets like two burglar that comes just in little small germs there's nothing to the size of it the same size germ makes an elephant makes a a nothing nothing's the size of the germ and some of them takes body form some never does and some never goes into cells some becomes spirit torments the soul we'll try to get that party i'll leave that part for tomorrow afternoon if i can or that soul spirit comes and how down already hearing now friends i'm not telling this from some kind of a psychological i have dealt with demons for years and you know that if you only knew the thing after the services is over at night what goes on sometimes you don't know remember when you come against the spirit you better know what you're speaking about just don't stand there and carry on because it ain't going to do any good but when actually a demon has to obey you you'll recognize it it ain't how loud you holler it ain't how much oral you put on it's what's back here that he'll recognize it's the truth jesus just said to him come out remember the disciples have been kicking and twisting and trying to cast him out and everything he said why couldn't we cast and i said because of your unbelief said come out of him the boy fell and had the hardest city ever had they recognize authority look at those boys down those vagabonds who seen paul casting out devils they said we can do the same thing some priest sons so they ground said we can cast out devils acts 19 they went down to a man who had epileptic fits and said we adjure you by jesus come out of him the devil said now in the name of jesus who paul preaches the devil said now i know jesus and i know paul but who are you you know what happened jumped on the man tore their clothes and they had to fix himself run out into the streets them same demons live today so there is a lot of fanaticism this is a church this evening there's a lot of fanaticism in the lands that they call divine healing that ought to be shut up that's what brings reproach upon the real cause that's why you have such a hard struggle there's a lot of stuff called religion today that ought to be shut up nothing to cults that's what makes the true church of god have such a hard struggle with it but we're america that's the way to be god says the wheat and creepers and bars grow together don't try to pluck them up let them grow together but by their fruits you know them there's no fruits while there's no life there's nothing there now watch this cell let's say for instance like a lot of time a red cancer usually hits in the womb of a woman female with bruises and so forth now that let's take that that fellow down now on his cells this is cancer now cancer everything in the natural types the spiritual are you aware of that everything in the natural types of spiritual regardless for instance like this when when we're born in the body of christ there's three elements it takes to bring our birth and that's the three elements that came out of the life of christ when he died there come from his body water blood spirit is that right three elements that's the elements we go through when we're born again justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit now that can all be in one act but it takes but you can be in a justified state without being sanctified you can believe on the lord jesus christ and still carry your filth with you but you can absolutely live in a both justified and a clean holy life and without the holy ghost see the bible 1st john 5 7 said there are three that bear record heaven the father son and holy ghost and the father word and holy ghost which was the son and these three are one and there's three the bear wrecker on earth the water blood and spirit and they agree in one not one but agreeing one you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the holy ghost for they are inseparable one the trinity is in a one i don't hear it around here but you hear a lot across the country one of the greatest things in the pentecostal groups is a mix-up and that one simple thing and i've had their heads right together and prove to them they both believe the same thing it's the devil between them that's all if that great pentecostal church would you throw down them the little traditions and unite themselves together as one blessed church of god the rapture would come but as long as satan can keep him broke up all right that's of his way of doing it and they absolutely believe the same thing one said well this is that i said if this is that then that's this so there you are so it's all the same thing but there you are in that uh triune trinity of god now now the god in his ones god the father son and holy spirit now we don't say our gods as heathens it's our god see it's the threefold being of god now notice now satan is in a trinity also and his powers are in trinity now but notice then when the water blood and spirit produces the new birth is that right now watch that's what represents the new birth what represents the natural birth before the new birth come why don't you mothers when a baby's born what's the first thing water next blood [Music] next see that makes the life see makes the person water blood spirit now cancer let's deal on him for our next we've got about five minutes left i guess about the next five minutes let's deal on cancer what is that fellow what does he represent he's a scavenger he represents the vulture eats dead things and a cancer comes from a bruise mostly where a cell has been hit and it it breaks up and a little cell in there becomes backslid well that's a big word for a bat just ain't it all right but it backslides that cell i'm a baptist believes in backsliding someone said down here arkansas means they said brother branham said is a fellow nazarene had been healed he had walked right over town with his crutches on his shoulders he said you know what said when i first come here said i thought you heard you preach i thought you was a nazarene he said then i've seen the most people of pentecostal and somebody told me you're a pentecostal now you say you're a baptist said i don't get it outside that's easy i said i'm a pentecostal nazarene baptist that's all right no we are one in christ jesus by the holy spirit making us one that's right now [Music] notice this little cell backslide when it's bruised it begins little other little uh germs run forth to give its lives in there and that's what pus comes in a sore that's teeny little soldiers fighting for your life they're out there and to hit that poison them demon powers that's kind of trying to collect in there and give their lives that's what's made that's a bunch of little dead soldiers that pus that's in your blood in a sore a give their life to save yours now once a little cell rejects in there and this demon gets started he starts growing he begins to multiply cells he's building a body just exactly like your babies begin in your womb and like you did in your mother sell on top of sell sell on top of sales sell any way anywhere just they have no form of nothing like a human being after it's nature it's just out of a spirit it just scrolls anyway and it begins cell on top of cell cell on top of cell and now first thing you know you begin to get weak and feel sick you go with the doctor and he'll examine you maybe he can't find it if he does maybe he'll cut it if he can cut it clear all right he's got it but if he can't cut it clear then if it's in the throat or somewhere where it can't be cut clear one little speck of it will live right on because it has not like you cut your hand off and settle it or anything or you cut all uh what i mean if you'd cut the main body off leave your hand there why it wouldn't live but but see that has not the form of life like you have it's a demon power a moving and now notice you call them the doctor calls it a cancer god calls it a devil look at the day they just give it where does the word cancer come from it comes from the from a latin word which is used in medical terms meaning a crab a crab that you see along with seashore has got all them blades that's the way that that it does it reaches out spreads out the word cancer is crab [Music] and it gets in and just keeps taking the whole sucking blood as it goes like an octopus or something well a tumor cataract and other diseases every one of them comes from a germ and that germ has to be a body and before it can be a body it has to be a life before it can create or dermatize and make more cells it has to be a lie is that correct now where did that cancer come from who where'd that come from it wasn't only here some time ago but now maybe it's on you where did it come from it's another life different from your life living in you and it's a tormenting your life that's reason jesus called it a devil they call epilepsy today they say epilepsy well epilepsy in the bible jesus called it a devil when the man come with the boy it fell on the ground and frosted the mouth and everything he said he has the devil and all the time he throws them in the fire in the water now they polished his name up and called it epilepsy but he's the devil and jesus said thou devil come out of the child exactly now epilepsy is usually causing a kidney trouble maybe get into that a little later see it causes an epilepsy from your enemy now noticing this then that cell sets there it's a devil he's building a life he's growing becoming greater and greater he's got one duty to do let's take your life that's what the devil standing for to cut your day shorter three score and ten now i salute every doctor yes sir every medical science god bless them for the help that they've done for people that's correctly what would you do in the world today without us i thank god for medical science i thank god for my automobile if god had let science make me an automobile i'd have a hard time walking up here for electric lights and for soap to wash my hands with and toothpaste to scrub my teeth with certainly i thank him for everything because all good things come from god but let me tell you there's not one speck of medicine ever did cure any sickness and there's not one doctor now let's do some quack but a real doctor will tell you that they do not claim to be healers right at mayo brothers many of you i've been interviewed there two or three times of patients that come from their incurable you read the reader's digest the november issue how many november issue that article of mine in their own reader's digest see and they had me up there in the interview that baby they give up said it couldn't be done but the holy spirit spoke to me and told me how it would be done and it was done all right now they call me up there and right before the door where jimmy and mayo used to be there's a great big sign that we do not profess to be healers we only profess to assist nature there's one healer that is god they're the best in the world now we have a few quacks yes that's right we have some quack preachers too all right so that goes on both sides notice but any man that claims that he's a healer he's a storyteller because he can't do it for the bible said i'm the lord who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases i've been to studies and in my room the some of the best of doctors across the nations has come you don't know the back of the life friend to know what's been and things i don't tell out in public men come secretly don't you think there ain't a lot of nicodemus is yet in the world there sure is thousands of them they look on that come in the meeting sit there with a t-shirt on something like that with polish names that you'd be surprised set right in the meeting in a few days slip around calling by secretly and send someone in for an interview and say right now i said brother branham i believe that's the truth they're human the same as we are sure in every man's desire to look beyond that dark valentine has to go through someday but them cancers and things are absolutely devils informed in a body of flesh moving up taking your life now if i would do like the doctor if i could cut it off lay it on the ground or just like say for instance you was the cancer yourself on this earth now here's divine healing if i want to get rid of you in the way of the doctor's way i just keep have to rub your body or something to it just all banished off the earth there wouldn't be any more of it just like the doctor takes the growth off of you but in the form of divine healing if you was a cancer i'd just call your life out of you and you'd go on your life would leave you but your body would be here just the same as it was now there's where sight and time is god's worst enemy in divine healing i don't know whether brother baxter ever gets to these things in the meeting i said explained it to him and brother bosworth over and over but here's what's happened i doubt we're a man of people get it because after a while you begin to find the people coming back saying i had my healing brother branham for two or three days but blessed it left me i find it i think it's because it don't set the meeting right the people don't understand i've had man to come to the platform and be totally blind cancers are cataracts or their eyes and read this bible as you're being prayed for walk down in three or four days be just as blind as it was in the first place what happened anyone knows that when the life is gone out of any flesh it shrinks for a while is that right anybody ever kill a deer or cow or anything like that sure all right you wear tonight you hunters i hear friends of mine you kill the deer and you throw them on the scale tell the boys how much he weighs watch out in the morning he's going to be several pounds lighter than what he was when a human being dies the undertaker the first thing takes a false teeth or an eye whatever it is in there takes it out because it shrinks in a push-out because the human body shrinks every other flesh shrinks when the life's gone out of the cell it begins to move down strength it'll do that for about 72 hours and then it'll start swelling let a little dog get run over right here on the road let him lay down her son for about three days and watch what happens he's a bigger dog than he ever was it swells up is that right well that's the same thing takes place when a a demon is cast out of a sick person the first few days oh i feel wonderful then begin to say i'm i'm sicker than a than i ever was i've lost my healing just as sure as faith tuck it out unbelief brings it right back again as faith kills it unbelief resurrection jesus said when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man he walks in dry places and he returns back with seven other devils and if the good man of the house isn't standing there to protect that door he'll come right on in and the good man of your house is your faith say stay away that's it but now you watch the patience here with no ordinarily this is a outstanding miracle which divine healing in america is two different things divine healing one thing a miracle is another thing but an ordinary run of divine healing when the unclean spirits cast out a cancer devil where it leaves the person oh uh or say we'll take something so you see more visible i'll say the cataract what happened with that man if you'll notice a blind person i don't know where they've ever had in here or not yet cataract eyes i'll let them stand for a few minutes why so that shrinkage begins to take place tell them come back give us a testimony oh my they can see wonderful oh my just i can see things yes i what's the matter life is gone the body of the cataract is shrinking well it'll do that way for a couple days oh i'm getting so well naturally begin to get a headache don't feel so good get up the next morning i'm losing my sight again someone said uh-huh you just worked up that bunch of holy rollers got you worked up don't you believe that that's a lie that evil if you believe that you go right back blind again but if you just hold on say no lord i believe then what happens that body swells for so long it covers over that side again that cancer in the body will swell you'll become hurting and aching again then you'll get horribly sick terribly safe wow that big growth of dead flesh in you is laying there dead you go back to the doctor and you say oh that's nonsense there's a cancer right there i can see it sure it's there but it's dead hallelujah now the bloodstream has to purify the body every time the heart pumps it throws the blood around the body and it picks up that infection sure it'll make you sick what if you had a chunk of meat hanging in you somewhere or long as a snake or something big around your finger and hanging in there and it was dead that much dead meat hanging in you and it's rotten well of course your bloodstream has to keep that pure as it pumps through but there's the dead body the thing hanging there because the life is gone from him the power of god through faith drove it out he's a demon he has to leave but the reason the people is not instructed they go away and give up and that same devil standing right there to take over again when god tells you anything on this platform through his spirit when he's under inspiration don't you doubt that our worst thing will come upon you he said for jesus said the lies the state of that man was seven times worse than it was in the first place is that right when the unclean spirit went out of a man he walked around and died places come back with seven other devils so don't you disbelieve stay right with us need it from your heart say no sir i'll not be moved no matter how sick i get that i don't have nothing to do with it now the first thing you know you'll be getting cleared up everything will be all right then see it's dead the operation that the doctor would have taken from you that same growth is laying in you with no life in it you say life in it brother brandon want to take my life no sir that life is a separate life from yours i've just showed you that you are alive and become a being and it's a life and becomes a being and you're of god and it's of the devil you see what i mean demonology now you ought to see what that thing looks like when you stand and look at it oh my i'm sorry it's almost 3 30. i'm sorry look friends oh what this world needs i've been about seven years teaching across america having these healing services i just got a good notion starting back across the country teaching the bible and on demonology how the people can understand what to do and that's the reason they go to these meetings a lot of times and fellows if you don't understand the people come out and many times now remember that fellow that come and said he had a gift of divine healing the gift of divine healing was in you if you got healed it's you the one any gift operates by faith and no matter how much to get the divine healing i got i believe it was all my heart but you could stand here and if you haven't got the same kind of faith it don't do you no good i can pray for you for hours and weeks and months it isn't the preachers with the divine healing it's you that's got the gift of divine healing that believes in being healed because it's by faith by faith every operation of god is by faith the whole armor of god's by faith we haven't got one natural thing of this world everything of the christian church is a faith act look at the armor of god love joy peace strong suffering goodness speaking is gentlest patience is that right everything's supernatural nothing natural so we don't look at the things natural because we're operating supernatural and the only way we can base it is faith is on what god said was the truth and we look at the unseen and we call those things which are not as though they were like abraham did when god amen abraham called those things which was not like god did as though they were being 100 years old staggered not the promise of god through unbelief i can just imagine that couldn't you see sarah get up on the morning god said abraham to abraham you go to have the baby sarah god said how you feeling sarah this is a mixed multitude but listen no different well glory to god we're going to have it go get the bird on the pins and everything get ready all right another must pass sarah how you feeling no different year passed sarah what about it no different ten years fast no different 25 years fast no different abraham instead of getting weak he got stronger stronger you know it's going to be more of a miracle all the time because he believed god and he staggered not as it taught us of god through unbelief he said we're going to have it one morning the womb of sarah began to swell and little isaac was born because abraham believed god and he looked at the things that carried those things that was not as though as they were not by feelings not besides you don't walk by feelings or science by faith and when god is pronouncing things that whatever things you ask when you pray believe you receive it then hold on to it god said so it's got to be so amen demons faith in the father faith in the son faith in the holy ghost three in the one demons will tremble and sinners awake faith in jehovah will anything shake that's right oh my god sir it is have faith in god look to him don't you move stay right there god said so demons what are they they're spiritual beings now the the doctor says you got cancer you got tv you got cataracts you got percy you got this it's a devil amen it's a life and behind that life is the spirit how many knows and can see that a cancer cataract is god it's a god it's a spirit a god got life in it well nothing can have life without spirit so there has to be a life to operate that somewhere even that tree there has life in it all the science in the world couldn't make one blade of grass did you know that they make something looks like it but they can't find the formula of life that's god's see jesus said to the tree curse it be you you don't have any fruit you'll never have any the pass back by those about eight o'clock at morning pass back about eleven o'clock and just going to dinner peter said look at that tree it's dead from the roots up why jesus rebuked the life that was in that tree that was in the roots and the whole thing died hallelujah that same christ can rebuke a cancer from the roots and the whole thing alive that tree was standing there just the same as it was hours before but she finally the leaves begin to drop off and then see the bark began to peel off and the begin to wear away day after day and week after week and after a while there wasn't even one speck of that tree left hallelujah cancer tumor cataract or anything else will have to go when christ speaks he cast out devils he said in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues take up serpents or drink deadly things will not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover you love him i'm sorry i kept your hour here this afternoon sitting here you love the lord what's going to happen now if you accept christ as your healer believe in your heart that something has happened to you and you believe you're healed or you're going to believe that you're healed don't let the devil pin nothing else on you just keep on doctor say say doctor how does it look he said why it's still there in your heart you oh you know what's happening first thing you never say say you wonder what happened to that thing and say look doctor i'm going to tell you here's what happened jesus christ healed me that's right jesus christ heal me all right let's bow our heads just a moment brother willis would you come here just a minute brother now our heavenly father we're thankful for the blood of christ and maybe sometimes that thy servant lord doesn't use wisdom but speaking so long but i maybe feel like paul that preached all night one night a little fella fell out of the window and got killed and that apostle with the word of god in his life one lady's body or the boy life come in him and he lived again dear god i realize that the sunset of this great civilization is now setting way past spence the middle of the day is gone the evening shadows are falling great light is breaking forth from the kingdom of god to take its place of this gross darkness coming on the earth god i realize i'm getting older every day let me go lord give me strength help me to tell this great truth everywhere help us tomorrow afternoon it will understand more dear god bless this little audience this afternoon tonight when they gather in for the healing service may every man and every woman get to one another and go to talk and and say now here's don't don't have any more doubt we understand where it comes from now we know it's a devil and we know when he leaves he has to come in the command of god he has to god's done said so he has to leave then may they go out happy rejoicing claiming their healing nothing let nothing stand in their way anymore just go believing god made this little church here and these cooperating churches have a revival after this meeting lord that'll just pack it through many hundreds of souls be brought into the kingdom of god granted father may men and women hear from across the nations and other places may they take the message back to their churches may they have an old-fashioned revival granted lord forgive us of our sins now help us to be your servants in jesus christ's name amen hearing by the word so brother without the word we're lost without the word we have no hope amen it is by the word we have hope for salvation redemption healing brother for god to meet our needs but again our motives got to be right our our objectives got to be right our attitude got to be right it's got to be for the glory of god amen it's not just wanting god to do this for me god do this god do that we got to have a right motive and a right objective we gotta have a right reason it's got to be for the glory of god no matter what you're trusting the lord for no matter what you're believing god for brother you you want to give him the glory if you love him again if you love him amen you want to glorify him you want to magnify him you want to up lift him up amen for him to lift you up by grace again by the grace of god let us keep our attitude right our spirit right and our motives and objectives right as christians as believers we're not here to promote a church we're not here to promote you know even even william branham or or this gentleman or that you know this preacher that preacher not here to promote one another we're to promote jesus amen brother we're not here to i light our families no it's jesus brother we've got to give him the glory give him the honor give him the praise amen because again as it is written that without him we can do nothing amen but with him our lord jesus christ all things are possible so he's looking for the preeminence in our lives in our hearts in our souls amen brother this go back again by faith again abel abel he had a more more excellent faith than cain brothers somewhere abel was more in a in a personal fellowship with god than cain was cain was religious but abel was spiritual and i trust by grace that we're not religious but spiritual and there's too many too many so-called christians today just religious religious religious they go to church go to church and yes sometimes as i've said even even around what we call the message a lot of them are religious but how many are really spiritual well can you give me a scripture to prove there's going to be very few straight is the gate narrow's the way and few there be that find it amen and when it comes to the coming of the lord there's going to be so few living saints most of them are gone on there's going to be there's going to be many when it comes to the resurrection and the rapture and our are entered into our union with christ in another dimension but most of them are gone on the dead in christ shall rise first amen they're going on and they're waiting on us but i tell you the ones that are going to be alive and cut away well because so few they won't know you're gone there'll be somebody here somebody there will wonder where you are you know and that's all but for the world in general we won't be among the missing ones yeah oya as far as as far as god's concerned we will be missing out of this earth but we're going to be with him in another dimension by the grace of god but the world won't miss us because it may be a family something that they might oh where did this brother go where did he go where did she go oh i believe only i believe that they were testifying of a resurrection they were talking about a rapture when they were here in their testimony i wonder oh yeah there might be family members or friends that that knew what we were standing for they might think about it and say oh well do you think they're gone in the right rapture do you think they were gone in the resurrection oh yeah and and well how will they know just just because we're missing well some people think as i said i saw a picture one time and i don't think i i did have a book with it in a religious book and and i don't know what i did with the book and where it is now but it's been gone for i got rid of it a long long time ago but they had that picture of the resurrection in in the book a painting and as i said lord i said it's not like that why because there they had uh the senior citizens coming out of the graves and going out then they had babies coming out of a grave going up and so on and then there you know the regular people coming out of graves and going up why because there's going to be no infant of days neither an old man that does not fulfill his days amen why because we're going to be young amen we're going to go into a glorified body and i'll tell you this a glorified body won't be god bless you brother david it won't be like brother david here uh we wait here you know our gray hair yes and our brothers mark sister maureen amen oh there's two or three warriors like it yeah no no we're we'll go back as young brothers and sisters maybe 20 20 brother brown did mention 25 years it might be around 20 between 20 and then 25 years old just going to be young amen by the grace of god amen so brother we're not going to have the gray hair and have the wrinkles and be see old age and that brother sister no the old will be young there forever transformed in a moment of time and a mortal will stand in his likeness the sun and the stars to outshine by the grace of god amen so brother sister i trust we have that faith that we are being changed i have been changed and i'm being changed from time to eternity and from an old person to a young person amen and of course the babies there they're going to be if if they're predestinated god knows the heart oh yeah oh well if you're a baby they're going to be saved no no god knows the heart and some of that comes out there in the scripture concerning the when when god said sent them out and said to one of his prophets says go out into that city and that place and says kill them all kill the old kill the young killed and they said they said brother why in the world would god tell them to gluten killed the babies where god knew what was in their heart we look at it oh that's just a baby older sweet wait till they get old see if they're still sweet yeah god because whatever's on the inside of the inside will come out in their flesh oh yeah so brother sister when it comes to saying god's going to that baby's going to hell that baby's going to hell well brother god don't see babies because god sees them what they were you know and what's in their heart so god help us what's in your heart god help us amen by grace we want god to create in us a clean heart amen and renew a right spirit within us by the grace of god keep our attitudes right lord and i tell you if you repent amen and god receives your repentance and god gives you the baptism of the holy ghost brother i tell you you're going to have a right spirit and a right attitude because now it's not your it's not the old nature that you were born with that you're that's in control now it's the new nature in control now it's the holy ghost you're born again amen and if you're born again you're going to have the nature of your heavenly father amen our lord and even even through our lord jesus christ praise the lord so
