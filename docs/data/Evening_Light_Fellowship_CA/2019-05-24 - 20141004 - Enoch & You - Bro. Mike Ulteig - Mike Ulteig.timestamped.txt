[40:16] living through is written epistles amen
[40:20] thank you praise the Lord
[40:24] well it's good to be here in
[40:28] Newfoundland and I guess you know I kind
[40:35] of identify a little bit with
[40:37] Newfoundland where that little poof poof
[40:40] bird or whatever his name is
[40:42] and you know I remember seeing him a
[40:47] long time ago and didn't realize it was
[40:50] him that I saw until they were
[40:51] explaining to me that I was talking to
[40:54] brother Paul he's a tall he he flies
[40:57] over to England or your back in a day
[41:00] and I thought man you know what a flyer
[41:03] you know and then and then brother Mark
[41:06] was talking to me and he says oh yeah he
[41:09] says you know his wings you know that's
[41:11] kind of his weakness but he's really
[41:13] good into water and I'm thinking this
[41:14] see now there's a problem here and he's
[41:18] a good flyer but his weakness is his
[41:21] wings and then and then somebody else
[41:24] was talking to might have been might
[41:26] have been brother Gerald can't remember
[41:27] but when he has problems taking off you
[41:30] know and then in my brain I could come
[41:34] back they was showing this little old
[41:35] burden he was he said now you what he
[41:37] does he's have a hard time taking off so
[41:39] he's got a run down here to the cliff
[41:42] and then he jumps off and kind of gets a
[41:45] kickstart and then he does good after
[41:46] that of course he has a little problem
[41:49] getting from the start to the cliff
[41:51] sometimes you know then and so you have
[41:53] this one little guy coming and he's he's
[41:55] really doing good and get ready to take
[41:57] off and all sunny boop blue and you
[42:01] don't quite make it and I guess that's
[42:03] kind of way I am preaching you know I I
[42:05] started out kind of slow trying to make
[42:08] it to the cliff you know and and you
[42:10] hope you don't stumble before you get
[42:11] there but once you get once you get in
[42:13] that flight then you're good you know
[42:15] so we may be slow starters but buddy
[42:19] once we get in there don't get in our
[42:21] way
[42:23] amen amen
[42:25] it's not it's not so much start in a
[42:28] race but it's it's finishing that race
[42:32] and one thing's for sure we didn't start
[42:35] this thing he started it in us so then
[42:38] he's going to be the one that finishes
[42:39] it amen
[42:42] may we give him the the perfect liberty
[42:45] in our hearts that we might that we
[42:48] might finish it in perfect faith I'd
[42:52] like to turn to the book of Saint Luke
[42:54] tonight just been having a really good
[42:58] fellowship with the brothers and just
[43:01] find it that over here and in this
[43:05] island at the ending and beginning of
[43:07] the world you know everything is first
[43:10] but it might be you know the first is
[43:13] last on the last is first we don't know
[43:15] how this thing's going to turn out and
[43:18] but I've been having some real good
[43:21] fellowship and just enjoy the humor
[43:22] that's here you know it just you get
[43:26] really kind of tensed up especially if
[43:28] you're coming to a place for the first
[43:29] time you don't know you kind of anxious
[43:31] a little bit and I always you always
[43:35] when you come to a place you know
[43:36] especially the first time you're a
[43:38] stranger but you know you know by the
[43:41] grace of God by the time you leave
[43:42] you're gonna be you're gonna be a friend
[43:44] and you're gonna have friends and that's
[43:47] what we want we want friends true
[43:49] friends friends that have the Holy
[43:52] Spirit that we can differ with that we
[43:53] can get upset with and still know that
[43:56] we're locked together in our hearts and
[43:58] we're here we're here to help one
[44:01] another and that others might be able to
[44:04] depend on us
[44:05] I've got some brothers that I consider
[44:08] to be close friends very close friends
[44:11] may not talk to him in a year but I know
[44:14] if I ever need somebody they're there
[44:16] and you know it's not how often you talk
[44:19] to somebody it's how it's how dependable
[44:21] they are that's what counts
[44:24] and I believe that that God in our heart
[44:27] were we're the most dependable people or
[44:30] is in the world we may not be on time we
[44:33] might be late we might be early and all
[44:35] those things but but you know he he is
[44:39] integrity of our hearts and and he is
[44:42] there our strength so in st. Luke
[44:45] chapter 17 I've tried to stay within the
[44:49] bounds of the of the Newfie Bible and
[44:53] won't go beyond that to the American
[44:55] Bible too well for example like 2nd
[44:58] Peter of the 6th chapter I realize you
[45:00] although you don't have that in your
[45:02] Bible so I'm gonna try to stay with him
[45:04] you know you got your own encyclopedia
[45:07] you got your own dictionary but I know
[45:09] you don't have your own Bible if you do
[45:12] there's no sense of me staying here I
[45:14] might as well go on because we got to
[45:17] have an absolute so I try to stay within
[45:21] the bounds of this of this book that's
[45:23] been given to us by God and not not get
[45:26] too far away from it in st. Luke chapter
[45:30] 17 and verse 26 and as it was in the
[45:36] days of Noah so shall it be also in the
[45:38] days of the Son of Man did he'd eat they
[45:42] drank they married wives they were given
[45:45] in marriage until the day that Noah
[45:48] entered into the ark and the flood came
[45:50] and destroyed them all likewise also as
[45:54] it was in the days of lot they did eat
[45:57] they drank they bought they sold they
[46:00] planted they builded but the same day
[46:02] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[46:05] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[46:07] destroyed them all even dust shall it be
[46:11] in the day when the Son of Man is
[46:13] revealed may we bow our heads Heavenly
[46:17] Father and Lord we thank you for your
[46:21] mercy and grace this evening and for
[46:24] your your precious people Lord that's
[46:26] hearing this and as part of our
[46:29] civilization part of the earth Lord that
[46:31] you created to be inhabited and Lord
[46:35] I find them to be jewels you know and
[46:37] precious and and and just a real clean
[46:45] hearted people and I pray that you bless
[46:47] them father may you you bless our coming
[46:52] together tonight and may you bless the
[46:54] region of your word may you bless each
[46:57] one I ask in Jesus Christ's name hey hey
[47:02] man you may be seated
[47:07] so tonight we'd like to to talk a little
[47:12] bit if we can on Enoch and there's
[47:16] probably not too much that I can that I
[47:19] can preach on that you haven't already
[47:22] heard through the ministry that's here
[47:26] through the more I talk with brother
[47:30] Jarrell and listen to him talking and
[47:32] with your other brothers I realize the
[47:35] depth of the word that that the Lord has
[47:37] brought brother Gerald and this assembly
[47:39] and and there's fine that as I listened
[47:45] to him there's many similarities in our
[47:46] lives and the way we look at things and
[47:49] and I know there's something very
[47:51] similar in all of our lives and that's
[47:53] and that's the new birth and being
[47:57] called out of the world by by the shadow
[48:01] of the Lord and we are we're jewels were
[48:05] a peculiar people
[48:07] now peculiar is not so much like
[48:11] something that's an oddity but that word
[48:14] peculiar refers to like a ruby or a
[48:18] diamond or a precious stone that we're
[48:22] talking about something that's rare you
[48:25] don't it is really very peculiar to find
[48:28] just a diamond or a ruby land out on the
[48:31] ground somewhere you have to dig for it
[48:32] you have to a mind for it you have to
[48:34] hunt for it to to be able to come to it
[48:37] it's peculiars jewel it's precious and
[48:39] so when he calls us with precious our
[48:42] peculiar people's not because we're
[48:44] different or because we're funny but to
[48:47] him
[48:47] we've been purchased by his own
[48:49] that makes you very very precious
[48:51] because that means that you're more
[48:54] precious to him than his own blood you
[48:57] know I can I remember there was a time
[49:00] you know you you might carry a coin or a
[49:03] dollar bill a $2 bill you know they were
[49:05] kind of an oddity in America there for a
[49:08] while and you'd keep that thing for a
[49:09] souvenir but but you know one day maybe
[49:12] you want a cup of coffee and you reached
[49:14] in you said and gotten the coins and you
[49:17] pulled out your wallet oh man the only
[49:20] thing I got is a $2 bill what am I gonna
[49:23] do I know what I'm gonna do here I'd
[49:26] like a cup of coffee because that cup of
[49:28] coffee all it became more important to
[49:31] you than that then that $2 bill and you
[49:33] know coins are the same way people
[49:35] collect coins and then they get in a
[49:37] financial situation and they go sell
[49:40] things and they say you know this
[49:41] thing's worth $100 nicer I'll give you
[49:43] 25 you'd say well I'll take it you know
[49:46] and because of the need that you have
[49:49] and so then for God in Christ to shed
[49:53] his own blood for you on ion we are the
[49:55] purchase of his blood that makes you
[49:57] more valuable than than the blood within
[50:00] itself because it was shed to purchase
[50:03] you so then you're very precious people
[50:06] and and you're you're the apple of God's
[50:10] eye and that means that you're the
[50:11] center of his is I you're the center of
[50:13] his attention that's what the apple of
[50:15] his eye means not just a precious fruit
[50:17] but the center of his a his traction his
[50:20] eyes on you if a sparrow would fall to
[50:24] the earth and God would not be there
[50:26] then how much more precious are you than
[50:29] than a sparrow and
[50:32] and he he knows your needs he knows the
[50:35] questions it's on your hearts he knows
[50:37] the proper exit for pricks for prep LexA
[50:40] t that you stand looking at like there's
[50:43] things and it seems like every answer
[50:44] creates a problem but but he has the
[50:47] answer he has the way and may he provide
[50:50] that through his word so one thing I
[50:53] notice here that that in my Bible it
[50:58] breaks up even the chapters like it
[51:01] starts out here in chapter 17 it says
[51:03] Christ teaches of offenses and then in
[51:07] in verse 11 here this 17 chapters that
[51:10] Christ cleanses 10 lepers and it kind of
[51:13] this Bible that I have kind of changes
[51:16] it or puts topical the headings over
[51:20] these and so it's kind of nice you know
[51:21] like if you have a parable it'll say
[51:23] parable of rich ruler so when it gets
[51:25] down here to verse 20 I find that it's
[51:28] separated it from verse 20 all the way
[51:30] to 37 and in verse 22 25 when you go
[51:35] home and read it I was referring to it
[51:38] last night I believe this is where the
[51:41] Pharisees come in a demand want to know
[51:43] when the Kingdom of Heaven or the
[51:45] kingdom of God is coming and so the
[51:48] subject is the kingdom of God and so
[51:51] Jesus says well he says it doesn't come
[51:55] with observation and easy and he goes on
[51:58] to talk and he says the kingdom of God
[52:00] is within you
[52:02] it's right here in your midst and it's
[52:05] within within the individual so he was
[52:07] the kingdom of God he was the word made
[52:09] flesh he was that word that they were
[52:13] looking for to come and he says it just
[52:15] doesn't come with the natural wisdom and
[52:18] understanding and knowledge it doesn't
[52:20] come with observation you can't find it
[52:22] with binoculars you you know and then he
[52:27] says but the Son of man must suffer many
[52:30] things and so the kingdom of God had to
[52:33] suffer many things because he was that
[52:35] word and he was rejected so the kingdom
[52:38] of God was rejected in his day because
[52:41] he was the Word made flesh he came to
[52:44] his own and his own
[52:45] received him not and the darkness
[52:47] couldn't perceive it couldn't graphed it
[52:49] couldn't understand the light because
[52:51] light was opposed to darkness and
[52:54] darkness it's carnality even religious
[52:56] carnality and that means the natural
[52:59] mind and the natural mind is in the
[53:02] enmity with God because it can't receive
[53:04] the things of God because the things are
[53:05] God's by faith in our five senses we we
[53:10] live off of that's real the things that
[53:13] we can touch the things that we can
[53:14] understand and when it goes beyond that
[53:16] that's where faith comes in so the whole
[53:20] topic is here now in these verses from
[53:22] verse 20 down to 37 is the kingdom of
[53:26] God so then we have the kingdom of God
[53:29] that was in the in the days of Noah
[53:32] we had the kingdom of God that was in
[53:34] the days of lot and that was God's Word
[53:37] being fulfilled and how it was rejected
[53:40] just like it was rejected in two days of
[53:42] Christ and he comes down he says because
[53:44] you've not recognized your day of
[53:46] visitation he said there was a time you
[53:49] could have seen these things but now the
[53:53] time is past you can't see them so no
[53:57] matter how they sought from that time on
[53:59] they could never understand perceive a
[54:01] find the kingdom of God and because that
[54:04] they had rejected it because they didn't
[54:07] recognize the kingdom that they were
[54:08] looking for and the kingdom that they're
[54:11] looking for today is the Lord shall
[54:13] descend with a shout with the voice of
[54:16] an archangel at the last Trump the dead
[54:18] shall rise because that's the promise
[54:20] for us and they might come up in say
[54:23] halt well you believe that brother
[54:25] Browne is a prophet right and you say
[54:28] that shouts already started will tell me
[54:29] when is the resurrection when's the
[54:31] Raptors going to come they demanded to
[54:34] know when the kingdom was coming I don't
[54:37] know my father knows but I don't know
[54:40] it's not for me to know it's not for you
[54:43] to know but you better be ready when it
[54:46] comes that's what you need to do that's
[54:48] your that's your portion it's not for us
[54:51] to know the day or the hour at the time
[54:53] if I knew it was thirty days from now
[54:55] but yet it was appointed for me to
[54:58] ten days from now what good would it
[55:00] know that 30 days from now
[55:01] so each moment each day is a rapture
[55:04] rapture facing the rapture for you and I
[55:07] because resurrection is rapture because
[55:10] the word rapture when you go into
[55:12] American we're talking rapture we're
[55:13] talking translation but I go over to
[55:16] Europe I go over to Norway and I say
[55:19] rapture they're talking about a
[55:20] resurrection and they're talking about
[55:23] body change and that word is inclusive
[55:26] to them
[55:26] so the rapture is just not a translation
[55:29] it can't take place until the
[55:31] resurrection comes and then the
[55:33] translation comes so then the rapture
[55:36] really is all-inclusive of all the
[55:38] things that to take place
[55:40] and concluding in the catching up and
[55:42] meeting them in the air it's all
[55:44] inclusive of that but usually when we
[55:47] say rapture or I do mentally I'm
[55:49] thinking body change I'm not really
[55:51] thinking so much resurrection and yet I
[55:54] acknowledge that so they were looking
[55:58] for this kingdom and in the days of Noah
[56:01] and in the days of lot there was a
[56:03] rejection and in the days of Jesus
[56:06] Christ he said because you've not
[56:08] recognized your day in other words
[56:10] because you've rejected that which has
[56:12] come to you not one stone will be
[56:15] standing upon another so they're
[56:17] absolute the thing that they did was
[56:20] their typos his temple that God no
[56:23] longer dwelt in there but they claimed
[56:25] he dwelt in there it was to be tore down
[56:28] and there was to be no absolute as far
[56:31] as their religion left anymore
[56:33] and that's why Paul was so fervent with
[56:37] the Hebrews they were in danger of
[56:39] falling back into the temple worship
[56:42] they were going back into this world or
[56:44] comfort zone because of persecution they
[56:47] wanted something they could touch speak
[56:50] in tongues have this divine healing have
[56:53] a goose bumper cried just to know I'm in
[56:55] the will of God or something like that
[56:57] they they wanted to go back to the the
[57:00] temple worship to their comfort zone to
[57:02] find something and Paul knew that that
[57:04] world was fixing to be tore apart
[57:07] can you imagine falling away
[57:10] from a temple that nobody has access to
[57:13] except through the blood of Jesus Christ
[57:16] and we go back to a to an altar that
[57:20] anybody can have accent can break in
[57:22] there and touch it they broke in there
[57:24] and they desecrated it they broke in
[57:26] there and put blood and worship there
[57:29] was good and bad everybody had access to
[57:31] that thing but it was fixing to be tore
[57:35] down and what this denominational world
[57:39] has put an absolute in it's going to be
[57:41] tore down and burned and those that are
[57:45] falling away and going back as the
[57:48] Hebrews Paul said all he said don't do
[57:50] that because he knew that that that
[57:53] prophecy of that young prophet it had to
[57:56] come to pass and they say when Titus was
[58:00] coming down and he brought his forces
[58:03] down there was a group of Christians and
[58:05] in there they had kept alive this
[58:08] prophecy that there would not be one
[58:11] stone left another it was part of Paul's
[58:14] ministry a part of Peters ministry it
[58:16] was a prophecy that was was held in the
[58:19] church and talked to the church
[58:21] especially there in Jerusalem and they
[58:24] say according to history that when when
[58:26] Titus was coming down there was a group
[58:29] of Christians that fled Jerusalem
[58:31] because they remembered the prophecy of
[58:34] that prophet Jesus Christ and they
[58:37] recognized that the conquer the enemy
[58:39] was coming down to surround that temple
[58:42] surround Jerusalem and labor laid it
[58:44] waste but there was a group that
[58:46] remembered and Paul knew that this time
[58:50] was at hand he said as you see this day
[58:54] not necessarily talking about about the
[58:58] rapture because the subject here is
[59:00] falling back into that wall glare of
[59:03] another age after coming into the light
[59:07] of this age and that age was fixing to
[59:10] be destroyed back there and this was
[59:12] fixing to go on with God he said don't
[59:15] fall back and as you see that day Oh
[59:19] assemble yourselves even the more often
[59:21] as you see
[59:22] what evidence of the revelation of the
[59:27] rapture within an individual's heart is
[59:30] that there becomes a desperation to
[59:35] gather together two more off as you see
[59:37] that day so gathering is associated or
[59:41] linked together with the revelation of
[59:44] the rapture so these people that well I
[59:50] don't feel like going to church today
[59:53] there's something wrong with their inner
[59:56] vision because in there as we see that
[1:00:01] as we see that day coming close to a
[1:00:04] translation for the living there's
[1:00:07] there's a hunger within us like a woman
[1:00:10] that we talked about a woman pregnant
[1:00:12] and they're saying that she's hungry and
[1:00:14] for now if I'm coming to the threshold
[1:00:16] of the time into eternity if I'm coming
[1:00:20] to a body change then there's something
[1:00:23] in me down in this soul that's calling
[1:00:26] for that which is required to take that
[1:00:29] and it begins to hunger and thirst and
[1:00:32] the only place that we'll find it is in
[1:00:35] God's Word and so we assemble together
[1:00:38] not just for fellowship into strengthen
[1:00:40] one another but for the manna and Moses
[1:00:44] didn't bring that mana he said I am the
[1:00:47] manna how could he be the manna because
[1:00:50] the manna was the embodiment of
[1:00:54] nutrition for human life every bit of
[1:00:57] calcium every bit of phosphorous
[1:01:00] everything that you needed every mineral
[1:01:02] every vitamin everything that the human
[1:01:05] body needed for her immune system
[1:01:08] everything was in that manner
[1:01:10] it was the embodiment of the nutrition
[1:01:12] for human life and they could live off
[1:01:15] of that they fed off it there was no
[1:01:17] disease there was nothing he was the
[1:01:19] perfect food and it was prepared in
[1:01:21] heaven
[1:01:22] it wasn't accumulated down here on earth
[1:01:25] and given to the people God made it
[1:01:27] created it and put it together with
[1:01:29] elements whatever it was and have
[1:01:31] and Jesus Christ was the embodiment of
[1:01:35] eternal life that's how he was that
[1:01:39] manner because he had to give his life
[1:01:44] for you to have eternal life and outside
[1:01:48] of him there is no redemption there is
[1:01:50] no way to to heaven there's no approach
[1:01:53] to God except through Christ he was the
[1:01:57] embodiment of eternal life
[1:01:59] and he came back in the gospel and to
[1:02:05] take that gospel and to eat it and to be
[1:02:09] quickened by the Holy Spirit is life
[1:02:11] itself and he's still at manna
[1:02:15] I'm not the man huh you're not the manna
[1:02:18] there's Bibles not the manna but that
[1:02:21] word inspired by God becomes an Anna
[1:02:27] this might come manna for the human
[1:02:30] intellect it might become manna for a
[1:02:34] religious spirit but it's not true manna
[1:02:39] until it's inspired by God himself and
[1:02:42] you can't force God to inspire it you
[1:02:46] can't make him you can't fast you can't
[1:02:48] say I'm gonna jump off this cliff if you
[1:02:51] don't reveal something to me
[1:02:52] you can't force anything from God you
[1:02:55] can't beg it from God but you walk with
[1:02:59] God and as you walk with God he unfolds
[1:03:01] his truth to you as you have need so in
[1:03:09] here I find that we I thought it always
[1:03:13] in my life I thought well what a paradox
[1:03:16] because in here we have Noah and we have
[1:03:20] lot and that's what the days are
[1:03:23] signified by at the time of judgment
[1:03:27] because Abraham wasn't present down
[1:03:30] there in Sodom but lot was and Enoch was
[1:03:36] already gone but Noah was there and yet
[1:03:39] we find the key figures for you and I
[1:03:41] and our identity as the is the two
[1:03:44] that's not mentioned
[1:03:45] Abraham and Enoch they were both the
[1:03:48] type of the very elect and yet they're a
[1:03:51] mystery element of this time they're
[1:03:55] sealed in here in a mystery a prophet
[1:03:57] comes and he says Abraham he said God
[1:04:00] visited him in human flesh and where did
[1:04:04] he see that same sign in the end time
[1:04:06] lot never received that sign but it was
[1:04:10] to the very elect right before the body
[1:04:12] change you don't find that in here in
[1:04:15] st. Luke but yet it's there it's hidden
[1:04:20] in there in sealed in these scriptures
[1:04:24] Abraham was the very elect you and I are
[1:04:27] the very elect and yet we find that
[1:04:30] there was lot which was a type of the
[1:04:33] foolish virgin in the way that we were
[1:04:35] looking at it and how that he received a
[1:04:38] righteousness from Abraham through the
[1:04:40] message of the testimony of Abraham and
[1:04:44] so now we have we have Enoch and Enoch I
[1:04:49] don't even like to say that Enoch is a
[1:04:51] type of the raptured Saints because
[1:04:54] David was a type of Christ and Joseph
[1:04:58] was a type of Christ those portions of
[1:05:01] their lives
[1:05:01] but Enoch was was translated he wasn't a
[1:05:05] type of a translation he was actually
[1:05:07] translated so we are identified with
[1:05:11] Enoch he identifies the end times Saints
[1:05:16] at the time of the translation he was
[1:05:20] not a type of the church that died and
[1:05:22] gave their life for Christ down through
[1:05:24] the church ages he's not a type of the
[1:05:27] resurrected he is a type of those that's
[1:05:31] to be translated and we are directly
[1:05:34] tied to his life and all the types with
[1:05:39] it 7 throne Adam 7th church age so
[1:05:45] because it were so closely tied to him
[1:05:50] he is a pre figure of the other of the
[1:05:55] bride at the evening time
[1:05:58] not a type he's more than the tide
[1:06:05] because he was he was actually
[1:06:07] translated he was a man and he lived a
[1:06:10] life and you know that life that he
[1:06:13] lived was a direct reflection of the
[1:06:18] life that you're gonna live
[1:06:22] what made Enoch Enoch and what him
[1:06:26] brought what brought him to a
[1:06:27] translation is the same thing that's
[1:06:30] going to bring us to the translation so
[1:06:33] he's more than the tie he's more than a
[1:06:35] type so let's go back now and and we
[1:06:41] want to talk about Enoch and what we
[1:06:43] want to do tonight and then tomorrow
[1:06:45] morning if we can and I want to take
[1:06:48] anything and just kind of look at him
[1:06:50] and and I know by talking with brother
[1:06:52] Gerald you probably have heard most of
[1:06:54] all this but maybe it's a refreshing but
[1:06:57] I want to take Inuk and I want a time to
[1:06:59] know because know is the type of the
[1:07:01] foolish virgin and we know that brother
[1:07:04] Branham said the third pull he said it
[1:07:07] will be to the totally lost but it will
[1:07:10] be for the bride and the church because
[1:07:14] I quoted a law at at times I'd say well
[1:07:16] it was to the totally lost and for the
[1:07:18] bride now I was talking to brother
[1:07:20] Lonnie one day and he said and the
[1:07:23] church I said in the church yeah so I
[1:07:27] went back and I looked at it and sure
[1:07:28] enough that's what it says so the church
[1:07:31] is not the bride but it's not the church
[1:07:35] it's not the great and it's not
[1:07:37] the daughters it can only be the foolish
[1:07:39] virgin the church the righteous that are
[1:07:42] to be purged out during that Tribulation
[1:07:44] Period so then all rip represents to us
[1:07:48] the foolish virgin and I want to take
[1:07:53] these ministries and so the Association
[1:07:57] in there even though we might know it
[1:07:59] but to show that Lincoln there and how
[1:08:02] it also can reveal something to us in
[1:08:05] this evening time of the association
[1:08:08] because the bride is the last voice
[1:08:11] the last age you know there's not going
[1:08:14] to be another messenger and there's not
[1:08:18] going to be another voice to this age
[1:08:22] she's the final voice to the final age
[1:08:26] and I want to take and I want to show
[1:08:28] the association between Enoch and the
[1:08:32] foolish and between the bride and the
[1:08:34] foolish and to look at it back here as
[1:08:37] it was in these days so let's go back if
[1:08:40] we will and just start with with Genesis
[1:08:42] and and I just just to make a a footnote
[1:08:50] from from last night
[1:08:53] that in in justification I just wanted
[1:08:56] to make one thing clear I said that that
[1:08:58] justification is not a divine work but a
[1:09:00] divine verdict because justification
[1:09:05] only deals with your legal status as it
[1:09:07] was before before God but we find that
[1:09:12] in in justification that justification
[1:09:17] does not doesn't does not bring a moral
[1:09:22] change there's no work in you that's
[1:09:25] done it doesn't change anything in you
[1:09:27] it changes your status before God so
[1:09:31] even though that you stand innocent
[1:09:33] before God then the thing that made you
[1:09:36] do it is still there your moral nature
[1:09:40] has not been touched you justified but
[1:09:45] the thing that made you do those things
[1:09:46] that's still there so some can lay so
[1:09:50] heavy on justification that they forget
[1:09:54] it never touched the moral it never
[1:09:56] touched the man it doesn't touch it's
[1:09:59] not a work of God it's a divine verdict
[1:10:01] and that verdict is based upon your
[1:10:04] faith and that faith has to be in Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ and so he doesn't give us a
[1:10:10] pardon he justifies us through Christ
[1:10:14] because Christ has paid the debt for us
[1:10:17] and we're not we're not imputed
[1:10:20] righteousness it was imputed to Abraham
[1:10:24] but in the scriptures it says we become
[1:10:28] the righteousness of God in Christ but
[1:10:32] so there's a deeper work that's been
[1:10:34] done with you and I through the blood of
[1:10:36] Christ because they didn't have blood
[1:10:38] but they were still righteous before God
[1:10:41] and they were justified but their moral
[1:10:44] character was never dealt with so we
[1:10:47] find it under sanctification we have a
[1:10:50] divine work because his brother Brandon
[1:10:53] preached it in the future home he says
[1:10:56] that old snake he used that snake as a
[1:10:59] symbol he says thank our justification
[1:11:03] takes this away now we stand before God
[1:11:06] innocent but that serpent that snake
[1:11:09] that nature that calls you to do it is
[1:11:11] still there so under the work of the
[1:11:14] operation of God the scripture says
[1:11:16] through a spiritual circumcision that
[1:11:19] that dead flesh that serpent is taken
[1:11:23] away by the operation of God now you
[1:11:26] stand justified and sanctified and we
[1:11:30] know that we can be justified without
[1:11:33] being sanctified and we can be justified
[1:11:36] and sanctified without the Holy Ghost
[1:11:38] but I can't get the Holy Ghost without
[1:11:42] being justified and I can't get it
[1:11:45] without being sanctified and I can't be
[1:11:48] sanctified until I'm first justified so
[1:11:51] justification is not a divine work it's
[1:11:54] a divine verdict where you stand before
[1:11:57] God innocent but sanctification is a
[1:12:02] divine work and the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:05] Spirit is a divine is a divine seal it's
[1:12:10] a divine event that seals at it in other
[1:12:13] words the way it seals it he used it as
[1:12:15] an expression to the a woman's womb that
[1:12:18] once it she's impregnated and that child
[1:12:21] is conceived she cannot be impregnated
[1:12:24] during that pregnancy and so when the
[1:12:27] Holy Spirit comes in there and brings
[1:12:29] life to that there's no other life can
[1:12:32] come into that
[1:12:33] what you're born into this world you're
[1:12:35] born de or human being a personality
[1:12:38] you're complete you can be afflicted in
[1:12:42] the influencing and more than things but
[1:12:45] as a human being your unit and when
[1:12:48] we're born again that's what seals us
[1:12:51] were now the sons of God and that cannot
[1:12:56] change we're sealed so it's that's ours
[1:13:05] our starting point in life to understand
[1:13:08] these things understanding them does not
[1:13:14] bring them to pass in your life but it
[1:13:19] gives you understanding of what's taking
[1:13:20] place in your life you can look back and
[1:13:24] said that's why that's why and then to
[1:13:28] recognize who you are in Christ you know
[1:13:33] what your position in Christ is if he's
[1:13:34] and one said in heavenly places and
[1:13:36] brother Brent said you know what
[1:13:37] heavenly places this he's the Dutch your
[1:13:40] position in Christ and in fusion too he
[1:13:43] says he says when he when he resurrected
[1:13:47] what'd he do he sat down at all you're
[1:13:51] tired now we know he wasn't tired oh I
[1:13:54] know what he did he was taking his royal
[1:13:57] position beside his daddy he sat there
[1:13:59] on that throne no any what he did what
[1:14:04] was so significant about him sitting
[1:14:06] down because of the Old Testament under
[1:14:09] the feast days no priest could sitting
[1:14:12] on because the job was never finished
[1:14:15] offered sacrifice offered sacrifice
[1:14:19] again offer sacrifice clean the Hulk or
[1:14:23] clean this do that do this there was no
[1:14:28] rest
[1:14:28] there was no completion even for the
[1:14:30] worshiper all he could do was wait and
[1:14:33] intense anticipation for the next
[1:14:34] shedding of the blood the next day of
[1:14:36] atonement for the purging of all sins
[1:14:39] that he didn't even know that he
[1:14:40] committed what if I did something how do
[1:14:42] you know what it is so he waited for
[1:14:44] that day of atonement and the Catholic
[1:14:47] just tried to duplicate that you know
[1:14:50] what they have they have what they call
[1:14:52] a Jubilee door I don't know if anybody's
[1:14:54] seen it but I remember it was one time
[1:14:57] at Christmas and I don't know what year
[1:14:58] it was and I saw this and I didn't
[1:15:01] really know what was taking place at the
[1:15:02] time but they got this door over in the
[1:15:04] Vatican and it's all bricked up I don't
[1:15:06] know work that I don't know if it's in
[1:15:07] st. Peter's Basilica or where it was hat
[1:15:10] but Basilica but it's just during it and
[1:15:13] they brick it all up so once they call
[1:15:17] it a Jubilee door so every 50 years they
[1:15:21] come and and and the priest they they
[1:15:24] take all the bricks down and there's
[1:15:27] this door and then the Pope he he takes
[1:15:32] his his scepter there he comes up to the
[1:15:35] door and he goes and he steps back and
[1:15:43] they open the door now the significance
[1:15:47] of that is that whoever walks through
[1:15:50] that door all your sins all your time in
[1:15:55] purgatory
[1:15:56] everything the expiation of all sin and
[1:16:04] so humans are humble you know now they
[1:16:08] open it every 25 years because of his
[1:16:11] concern for the people and so as you
[1:16:15] approach the door then of course
[1:16:18] somebody's holding their offering plate
[1:16:26] so you go through this door after you do
[1:16:30] your duty here whatever it might be I
[1:16:33] don't know if they have an amount or
[1:16:35] what it is you walk through that and
[1:16:38] your sins are forgiven but then the
[1:16:42] first thing you do wrong you're right
[1:16:43] back in jail again so the only hope you
[1:16:47] have is to wait for the next day they
[1:16:50] open up that Jubilee door but he the
[1:16:53] expiation of all sinned he died once and
[1:16:57] for all for eternal redemption for all
[1:17:04] sin sins you did sins that you're doing
[1:17:08] sins that you're gonna do tomorrow all
[1:17:11] sin so when he resurrected and he went
[1:17:16] over there and he sat down he's the only
[1:17:21] high priest that ever sat down during
[1:17:23] the administration because it was a
[1:17:27] finished work and Ephesians 2 our
[1:17:30] position in in heavenly places he has
[1:17:36] made you to sit with him so then some of
[1:17:44] us have never sat down with him yet
[1:17:46] we're not in our position in heaven and
[1:17:49] we're not going to sit here like a royal
[1:17:53] queen with some scepter ruling the
[1:17:56] kingdom with him or in his vacancy but
[1:18:00] it's signified that we have accepted
[1:18:03] what God has done for us in Christ and
[1:18:05] were at rest our position in heavenly
[1:18:11] places with Christ is in perfect rest
[1:18:17] now we can serve Him because we're not
[1:18:22] working for him he is in us and we're in
[1:18:26] him but I just wanted to add that to
[1:18:31] last night in Genesis now we're going to
[1:18:34] go to Genesis 5
[1:18:39] and in verse 21 and we're going to read
[1:18:43] about a little bit about Enoch here
[1:18:47] verse chapter 5 of Genesis and verse 21
[1:18:52] and in Eclipse sixty and five years and
[1:18:57] begat methuselah an Inuk walked with God
[1:19:03] and he begat methuselah three hundred
[1:19:06] years and begat sons and daughters and
[1:19:10] all the days of Enoch were three hundred
[1:19:12] and sixty and five years an in aquatic
[1:19:20] him so that's what we have now the first
[1:19:27] thing we notice is that Enoch for 65
[1:19:31] years of his life he didn't walk with
[1:19:34] God because it said he was 65 years old
[1:19:38] and after he begat Methuselah he walked
[1:19:42] with God now there's only two people in
[1:19:46] the Bible in the Old Testament that the
[1:19:49] Bible ever said that walk with God in it
[1:19:52] nor there was kings that walked after
[1:19:56] God or in the way of God and Abraham
[1:20:01] walked before God but nobody in the Old
[1:20:05] Testament was spoken to walk with God
[1:20:07] outside of Enoch and Noah now the Bible
[1:20:11] says how can two walk together unless
[1:20:13] they be agreed and as we were saying
[1:20:17] last night when I go up here to two to
[1:20:20] Genesis five and I begin reading at the
[1:20:22] beginning it says Abel was created in
[1:20:25] the image of God and the likeness of God
[1:20:27] he was created and he bear forth his son
[1:20:29] in his own image said so we find that
[1:20:34] all man was born in are conceived in sin
[1:20:37] shapen in iniquity didn't come forth
[1:20:40] from his mother's womb speaking lies
[1:20:41] because now we're we're under a fallen
[1:20:44] nature
[1:20:45] we're not sons of God the seed is in us
[1:20:47] but the manifestation is the
[1:20:49] manifestation of
[1:20:50] fallen father because he could only
[1:20:53] bring forth children in his own image
[1:20:55] and so he brought forth children not in
[1:20:59] the image of God because he had lost the
[1:21:01] power of the spoken word so he could
[1:21:04] only bring them through a human natural
[1:21:06] relationship in the same way that
[1:21:08] animals and animals don't have a soul
[1:21:11] animals are controlled by their senses
[1:21:13] by reasoning by memory they can be
[1:21:16] trained they can be taught and so when
[1:21:18] we come into the world instead of the
[1:21:20] soul being dominant in our lives like it
[1:21:22] was with Christ the Spirit is dominant
[1:21:25] and it puts the soul there's an
[1:21:28] unbelieving nature that's permitted by
[1:21:30] nature the way that we come into the
[1:21:32] world if we'd been spoken like Christ
[1:21:34] we'd have come into the world and the
[1:21:36] soul that gene that come from God would
[1:21:39] be dominant and it would be controlling
[1:21:41] us even in the self Willy would control
[1:21:44] that self will and bring it under the
[1:21:46] will of God by nature not by subjection
[1:21:49] not because it had to under the law but
[1:21:52] because there was a greater power in a
[1:21:54] control room that that controlled him so
[1:22:00] we know that Enoch anybody we talked
[1:22:04] about in the Bible when he was born he
[1:22:07] was separated from God because you and I
[1:22:10] were separated from God we were dead in
[1:22:12] our sins and trespasses
[1:22:14] so Enoch because we're speaking of him
[1:22:18] he was dead in his sins and trespasses
[1:22:20] and he didn't walk with God for for five
[1:22:23] year or 65 years so now all of a sudden
[1:22:28] after he has a baby now he's walking
[1:22:31] with God so what happened something had
[1:22:34] to happen in between his 65 and 66 years
[1:22:39] that when he had this child now he's
[1:22:41] walking with God so he had to be
[1:22:44] reconciled to God he had to come into
[1:22:47] position of justification and
[1:22:49] righteousness to be able to walk with
[1:22:52] God and that's why we were back rounding
[1:22:55] this because now in order for Enoch to
[1:22:58] walk with God he had to have a
[1:23:01] revelation
[1:23:03] because it's faith that justifies us and
[1:23:06] it God has to reveal something to us so
[1:23:11] we know that that Enoch according to the
[1:23:14] scriptures that we're going to read that
[1:23:16] he had faith but wait a minute
[1:23:21] I cannot have faith without God
[1:23:26] supplying me a word and why was a
[1:23:31] nickname endowed from among the pure
[1:23:35] lineage because these are all the
[1:23:36] lineage of the firstborn that doesn't
[1:23:38] say sons and daughters sons and
[1:23:40] daughters they don't tell us about that
[1:23:42] he said and the sons of God they looked
[1:23:46] upon the daughters of men I don't
[1:23:47] believe that it was his firstborn
[1:23:49] lineage
[1:23:50] I believe it laid within the sons and
[1:23:52] daughters that was begotten by them
[1:23:54] because here we have a pure lineage
[1:23:57] coming down recorded by God that Seth
[1:24:01] begat eNOS and eNOS and on down so we
[1:24:04] know that when eNOS was born something
[1:24:07] taken place that was different than when
[1:24:10] Seth was born because Seth was born and
[1:24:15] he was a seed that was appointed by God
[1:24:18] instead of Abel but now eNOS is born and
[1:24:22] man begins to call on the name of the
[1:24:25] Lord so it wasn't it wasn't wild just
[1:24:28] Adam and it wasn't wow while Seth but
[1:24:33] something transpired when eNOS come for
[1:24:36] so we know to call upon God we would say
[1:24:39] they went back to the alternate offering
[1:24:42] of the sacrifice of blood because that
[1:24:44] was what was given to them through Abel
[1:24:47] by revelation so they went back to
[1:24:51] calling on the name of God which the
[1:24:54] name of God is the word of God revealed
[1:24:56] or the presence of God because in in
[1:25:00] Deuteronomy and in chapter 16 it says
[1:25:04] and you'll come before me three times a
[1:25:07] year in the Feast of Unleavened the
[1:25:10] feast of Pentecost and the feast of
[1:25:12] tabernacles and you won't come into
[1:25:16] because if you walk with me I'm gonna
[1:25:18] bless you and if you come empty it's
[1:25:21] because you kept it to yourself and you
[1:25:24] not brought forth the offerings of God
[1:25:26] recognizing that he's the one that gave
[1:25:28] it to you you know when when when
[1:25:35] Abraham when Melchizedek come and when
[1:25:40] Mackenzie said and God hath delivered
[1:25:43] the enemy into thy hand
[1:25:46] he knew the victory wasn't won by him it
[1:25:51] was won by God he didn't win it it was
[1:25:54] what God inspired and was with him in
[1:25:57] that battle and the spoils of the battle
[1:26:00] was not his earnings it wasn't what he
[1:26:03] got it was what God used to redeem him
[1:26:06] he redeemed those things and recognizing
[1:26:10] that he was not only the Most High but
[1:26:12] he was the one that gave him victory he
[1:26:14] gave a tenth of that back to God
[1:26:17] expressing the revelation that he
[1:26:19] believed that God gave him that that
[1:26:21] battle and when a man refuses to pay
[1:26:25] tithe he's refusing to acknowledge he's
[1:26:28] the Most High and he's the one that's
[1:26:30] given you the ability to have the have
[1:26:33] their earnings for your family you're
[1:26:37] you're declaring like like knit like at
[1:26:40] never can answer I have achieved this
[1:26:45] through my efforts in this job I got
[1:26:49] this money I deserve this money but
[1:26:55] Abraham said it's truth God gave me that
[1:26:59] victory I give this as a recognition
[1:27:04] tithing is only a recognition but never
[1:27:09] Knesset says I have created this great
[1:27:12] kingdom and the time it comes from his
[1:27:16] mouth he went back into a beast nature
[1:27:22] the words deeper than what you think so
[1:27:26] at the time of Enoch we know that man is
[1:27:29] calling on God oh what I was going to
[1:27:31] say in Deuteronomy he says but you won't
[1:27:33] bring your sacrifices everywhere not at
[1:27:36] all the gates that God gives you oh I
[1:27:41] was reading that I said not at all the
[1:27:45] gates that God gives you so then God
[1:27:48] must have given more than one gate God
[1:27:51] gave them gates plural and he said not
[1:27:57] at every gate but at the gate where I
[1:28:02] placed my name where was the first place
[1:28:07] that God put his name
[1:28:10] it was the tabernacle of Moses and you
[1:28:16] didn't walk up and say I am that I am
[1:28:19] they didn't say Jehovah lives here how
[1:28:24] do you know that's where his name was
[1:28:25] because his name is the manifestation of
[1:28:29] his word or the manifestation the
[1:28:32] Shekinah glory on earth which means the
[1:28:34] manifestation of deity and that pillar
[1:28:37] of fire came down and he placed his name
[1:28:41] there because his name is his manifested
[1:28:45] presence he covers all time and space we
[1:28:48] breathe we live in him the sinner lives
[1:28:50] in his presence but his manifested
[1:28:53] presence is what makes the difference
[1:28:54] and he gave him that gate the first gate
[1:29:00] that he gave him was the Garden of Eden
[1:29:02] because he met man he talked with man
[1:29:05] that was the holiest of Holies that was
[1:29:07] the center of Adam's Kingdom that's
[1:29:11] where his throne was and that's where
[1:29:12] God met him
[1:29:14] but he moved from that gate and then he
[1:29:18] moved from that gate to the Temple of
[1:29:20] Solomon and that gate was taken down so
[1:29:25] only only where he places his name
[1:29:28] that's where you bring your offering was
[1:29:31] that the gate where he placed his name
[1:29:33] so they were calling on the name of God
[1:29:36] but there was no response they called on
[1:29:41] him but there was no presence of God now
[1:29:44] it's interesting that in here when I was
[1:29:47] I never was much to look at lineages and
[1:29:50] things but I was I was noticing in here
[1:29:56] that that in this in this period of time
[1:30:00] let me see if I get this thing to work
[1:30:02] right I'm kind of afraid of this thing
[1:30:05] but but in here that Adam Enoch was 300
[1:30:15] and yet eight years old when Adam died
[1:30:19] in equals three hundred and eight years
[1:30:21] old man Adam died so that means Adam was
[1:30:25] alive talking on the earth three hundred
[1:30:28] and eight years while Inuk was alive
[1:30:32] Methuselah was two hundred and
[1:30:34] forty-three years old when Adam died and
[1:30:36] the limit was 56 years old when Adam
[1:30:40] died you say whoa so what what what what
[1:30:44] significance is that and the
[1:30:47] significance is this that Adam was given
[1:30:52] a testimony if you if you look at I want
[1:30:54] to take this kind of slow until I get in
[1:30:57] where I want to be if you look in
[1:31:00] Chapter five of Genesis in in verse 29
[1:31:06] the limit he has a son and it says limit
[1:31:14] and he called his name Noah and that in
[1:31:17] that word and that word means rest
[1:31:21] saying this same shall comfort us
[1:31:24] concerning our work and toil of our
[1:31:27] hands
[1:31:27] because of the ground which the Lord has
[1:31:31] cursed now how did lemak how did lemon
[1:31:37] know that the ground was cursed
[1:31:40] there was only two people that knew it
[1:31:42] was cursed and that was Adam and Eve so
[1:31:47] that means that Adam and Eve when they
[1:31:50] came out there were some verbal
[1:31:53] relationship of what taking place in the
[1:31:55] garden and he heard the testimony of
[1:32:01] Adam and he heard that how that God
[1:32:04] cursed the earth but somehow God is
[1:32:08] revealed to limit an insight into the
[1:32:11] Ministry of of Noah that in Lois
[1:32:15] ministry he's going to give them rest
[1:32:18] concerning this curse in the labor of
[1:32:21] their hands so he names him rest and we
[1:32:27] find it when Noah comes out of the ark
[1:32:29] God comes and speaks to him he said I
[1:32:32] will no longer curse the earth for your
[1:32:35] sake so then the curse was lifted now
[1:32:38] limit being prophetically named his son
[1:32:44] rest because of the toll and the labor
[1:32:47] and because the land was cursed and
[1:32:49] through Noah because the earth was
[1:32:53] justified under the flood of Noah then
[1:32:56] that curse was lifted and he said I'm no
[1:32:59] longer curse the earth so now we can see
[1:33:02] that there's a verbal or a testimonial
[1:33:04] relationship so they're coming together
[1:33:08] to call on the name of God or are
[1:33:12] worshipping Him
[1:33:16] so now Enoch and remember Enoch is a
[1:33:22] type of you and not really a type but I
[1:33:25] just say that just so he has 308 years
[1:33:30] that he's listening he's listening to
[1:33:33] Adam and you know I'm sure that after so
[1:33:39] many years that his testing
[1:33:41] onie you know people got tired of
[1:33:44] hearing that the church you know like
[1:33:48] one brother said maybe he'd going in the
[1:33:49] coffee shop and and there'd be some
[1:33:52] other brothers sitting with him and he'd
[1:33:53] start talking about oh I can remember
[1:33:55] back in those days you know how we
[1:33:58] walked walk with God and they said yeah
[1:34:02] well listen I've got to go at him you
[1:34:05] know I didn't heard this story before
[1:34:08] so he was he was he was talking about
[1:34:12] back there in those days you know as we
[1:34:17] read about back in the days of the book
[1:34:19] of Acts and some says well you know I
[1:34:23] don't ever be like that yeah well that's
[1:34:25] all right Adam but you know God's
[1:34:28] present don't come among us in the
[1:34:29] church anymore you know we pray and we
[1:34:32] worship and we offer up the offerings
[1:34:34] and and you know that's what God
[1:34:37] requires of us as to worship Him you
[1:34:39] know that's what Abel did that's what
[1:34:40] we're doing he said but you know there
[1:34:43] was a time that used to come down and
[1:34:45] and talk with us I remember back in
[1:34:47] Pentecost when we used to meet in to
[1:34:50] brush our burs in the presence of God
[1:34:52] oh yeah but do you know those days are
[1:34:54] past now we we've got the opening of the
[1:34:56] word you know and we we you know we've
[1:34:59] got the reality now that's fine and you
[1:35:03] know I can remember back in the meat
[1:35:05] into a brother Brent oh yeah I've heard
[1:35:07] that but now we're we're in the opening
[1:35:09] of the seals I read in here where Peter
[1:35:14] was just walking and then his shadows
[1:35:16] people was healed and you know the Bible
[1:35:19] Jesus said to work than I do you'll do
[1:35:21] and it was there oh yeah you know that
[1:35:25] was that's a long time ago well I got to
[1:35:27] go ahead am i I see you but you know
[1:35:32] there was something different about
[1:35:33] Enoch because there was a seed down in
[1:35:35] here I guess he would have been a little
[1:35:40] bit like the Queen of Sheba then she
[1:35:43] went to church she had a priest oh and
[1:35:47] he would tell her all about God and how
[1:35:50] good god was and he said you know God
[1:35:52] just loves you
[1:35:53] to give all friends and and we feed him
[1:35:56] this bread and we pour milk over this
[1:35:59] stone and you know all the things that
[1:36:01] pagans doing she's at all he's just a
[1:36:03] wonderful God he she said but you know
[1:36:06] in her there was a seed
[1:36:08] so she said old priest could you arrange
[1:36:12] some way that I could talk with him
[1:36:14] oh no no only the priest can do that you
[1:36:18] you you can't now if you have some
[1:36:21] questions I can ask him for you
[1:36:23] or if you have something you'd like to
[1:36:25] tell him that I can tell him for you oh
[1:36:27] yes well great priest would you tell him
[1:36:29] I just wondering about this and and
[1:36:32] maybe she had a child he was sick could
[1:36:34] could you ask him to heal you know and
[1:36:37] she just longed to talk to him so she
[1:36:40] just you know it's like talking through
[1:36:42] a translator you just want to sit down
[1:36:43] with people and talk to him heart to
[1:36:46] heart and when you talk to him you you
[1:36:48] can be this close but talking to a
[1:36:50] translator it's not it's not
[1:36:52] communicating like you want to
[1:36:53] communicate you know and she you know
[1:36:57] she was satisfied that this was all that
[1:36:59] there was you know and so she was
[1:37:02] content but I guess she was like Adam
[1:37:04] when he walked around he looked at
[1:37:06] everything and he said well how's it
[1:37:07] look everything's perfect he's what's
[1:37:11] wrong at him I don't know him but
[1:37:14] everything's perfect and so she said oh
[1:37:17] yes great high priest everything is just
[1:37:21] good he said what's wrong oh I don't
[1:37:26] know so one day the caravans come
[1:37:29] through and they come in offering all
[1:37:31] the jewels and bringing it up to her
[1:37:32] throne and and then she hears she hears
[1:37:36] him talking about the meetings they'd
[1:37:38] been up up there and in Jerusalem oh man
[1:37:42] she thought the presence of God you mean
[1:37:45] wait a minute wait a minute you mean the
[1:37:47] presence of God with oh yes we were
[1:37:49] there Queen oh my it the presence of God
[1:37:54] come down and here was Solomon and he
[1:37:57] was just oh my there was nothing that
[1:37:59] could stand before him but what wasn't
[1:38:01] revealed to him it was a very presence
[1:38:03] of God and oh my something just
[1:38:06] oh if I could just I could just get into
[1:38:08] his presence but so she goes to her
[1:38:12] pastor and says pastor you know I love
[1:38:15] you and I'm not leaving the church and
[1:38:17] but they're having some meetings up in
[1:38:19] Jerusalem could I please go well you
[1:38:22] know clean you know God would be
[1:38:26] displeased with you if you go and you
[1:38:29] know I'm not afraid for you to go but
[1:38:31] but perhaps if you went the camel might
[1:38:35] stumble and you might fall and break
[1:38:36] your neck because God would be
[1:38:38] displeased freeze you going to those
[1:38:40] meeting but we love you clean oh I love
[1:38:45] you great pastor but but you know I just
[1:38:47] I just feel like I've got to take this
[1:38:50] journey and go to church if you do God
[1:38:55] will judge you because if you leave here
[1:38:58] you're leaving the very presence of of
[1:39:00] God the great deity you know what I mean
[1:39:05] and she said well they're just a longing
[1:39:10] in my heart and I've just got to go
[1:39:12] great priest and I love you and so she
[1:39:14] saddled up and and took off you know I
[1:39:19] guess it was a little bit like Joe when
[1:39:21] he said if I just if I knew where he was
[1:39:24] if I knew where his seat was if I knew
[1:39:27] where throne was now she'd been given a
[1:39:30] direction and she'd be given some
[1:39:31] testimony and she went up there and you
[1:39:35] know after the revelation after God gave
[1:39:39] Joel the revelation of the question that
[1:39:41] was in his heart then he he met him he
[1:39:46] said gird up your loins and and he spoke
[1:39:48] to him through a whirlwind so he got his
[1:39:50] you know he'll meet with you if you
[1:39:53] really want a conference with him and if
[1:39:57] yours isn't sir in your heart desired
[1:39:59] you know he'll meet with you and she
[1:40:02] went up there to Jerusalem and so she
[1:40:06] was gonna test the preacher out a little
[1:40:09] bit
[1:40:09] you know they say because she didn't
[1:40:13] want to be fooled she wanted something
[1:40:14] that was real and she said you know King
[1:40:19] Solomon I've heard that God is with you
[1:40:22] and I I believe that inside I think you
[1:40:26] know I've got some questions I'd like to
[1:40:29] ask you I got some Bible questions here
[1:40:32] and what's this about water baptism
[1:40:35] what's this about serpent seed well you
[1:40:39] know you've got a child at home that's
[1:40:44] sick and you're wanting the healing for
[1:40:46] that child
[1:40:48] he not only answered all her questions
[1:40:52] he said and he told me everything that
[1:40:55] was in my heart and soul so it was with
[1:41:03] David you go over to the Psalms David
[1:41:06] said he just loved God and you know he
[1:41:09] loved the presence of God because he had
[1:41:11] experienced the presence of God Saul
[1:41:14] never did God had the knowledge of God
[1:41:17] and he experienced the anointing of God
[1:41:19] and he prophesied with the prophets but
[1:41:22] he never met with God he sought he
[1:41:25] sought the Word of God through the
[1:41:26] prophets and he went to the he went to
[1:41:29] the temple of Moses or the tabernacle of
[1:41:31] Moses and he offered up sacrifices but
[1:41:35] we don't know of any time that he had an
[1:41:37] actual visitation from God but David
[1:41:41] when he was a young man he said God
[1:41:44] delivered that bear into my hands God
[1:41:47] delivered that line into my hands he
[1:41:50] knew the presence of God and once a man
[1:41:53] has ever experienced that presence
[1:41:56] brother Branson once you ever drink from
[1:41:59] that artesian well you'll never go back
[1:42:02] to that cistern and David knew the
[1:42:09] presence of God and he said he was
[1:42:13] trying to express some way to tell how
[1:42:16] much that he loved God and he you know
[1:42:18] like we might say oh I give my right arm
[1:42:21] if I can
[1:42:22] have a car like that now we don't want
[1:42:24] nobody cut off arm but we're trying to
[1:42:26] think of something in our desperation to
[1:42:29] express how much we want something and
[1:42:31] David was thinking he thought I see how
[1:42:33] can i express my love for God and not
[1:42:38] not not just God but but the God is a
[1:42:41] person a relationship in it and a
[1:42:44] communication or a living relationship
[1:42:49] and he knew what the rest of the church
[1:42:52] they were satisfied with just going to
[1:42:53] the house you know some people might be
[1:42:56] satisfied to go to your house and they
[1:42:59] say ha that's where brother Gerald is
[1:43:02] what a wonderful thing wasn't that nice
[1:43:04] that's where he lived but there are
[1:43:08] those that would come and say is he home
[1:43:11] I want to talk to him I don't want to
[1:43:12] look at his house I don't want to look
[1:43:14] at the windows in his car I want to talk
[1:43:16] to him I don't want to wear his suit I
[1:43:19] want to talk to him and David said
[1:43:26] brother Brown said to him being a hunter
[1:43:29] he knew the relationship that when those
[1:43:31] hounds are that that hunter and wounded
[1:43:34] that deer it was bleeding and in that
[1:43:36] sense of that animal it new and
[1:43:39] desperation it had to get to that stream
[1:43:41] to hide its tracks and to drink that
[1:43:44] cool water to help coagulate that blood
[1:43:47] and give it new strength to escape the
[1:43:49] hounds of hell
[1:43:51] and he said oh what a desperation that
[1:43:53] deer was in he said o my soul thirst
[1:44:00] three on and I like the way the
[1:44:02] Scriptures written and it's written
[1:44:04] perfect he said my soul thirsts for God
[1:44:07] a living God he not not God up there in
[1:44:13] the cloud our God in the preacher God in
[1:44:16] the pulpit our God in his anointing on
[1:44:19] the Church of the Assembly but God my
[1:44:23] God that I can sit with him talk Abraham
[1:44:26] talk with him David talked with him many
[1:44:30] talked with him and I'm a child I want
[1:44:32] to talk with him
[1:44:33] Joe wanted to talk with him the Queen of
[1:44:37] Sheba wanted to talk with him he said my
[1:44:42] soul thirsts for God he said I go to I
[1:44:45] do go to the house of God the temple and
[1:44:48] I go and I worship Him with all the
[1:44:50] other worshipers and I go to church I go
[1:44:53] to his house I offer up the sacrifices
[1:44:56] of the day of Pentecost or whatever day
[1:44:58] it is Passover but when I come back why
[1:45:02] is there tears in my eyes all that I
[1:45:05] might come into his presence that I
[1:45:08] might come to his face but I might come
[1:45:10] to his presence he wasn't satisfied with
[1:45:13] knowing about him or just going to his
[1:45:16] house he wanted he wanted an fellowship
[1:45:20] he's that he's he's a God of my life he
[1:45:24] says my life is God God of my life
[1:45:31] the next films he said send my light and
[1:45:37] my truth so I can preach a good sermon
[1:45:41] no send thy light and thy truth that it
[1:45:49] might lead me to thy Tabernacles to his
[1:45:53] presence that I might worship that I
[1:45:57] might take up the instruments and I
[1:45:59] might worship and testify to the sinner
[1:46:03] into the law the God of my strength the
[1:46:10] woman at the well you know what her
[1:46:14] problem was her problem was not lust her
[1:46:20] problem was not sex her problem was she
[1:46:22] was hungry for God because then her was
[1:46:26] a seed so I said you know in my early
[1:46:31] life there is a seed in me and it
[1:46:34] hungered and it thirsted for God but the
[1:46:38] problem was is my spirit misinterpreted
[1:46:41] the voice of the soul and it says you
[1:46:45] need alcohol you
[1:46:47] need tobacco you need a woman you need a
[1:46:49] car
[1:46:50] he said we tried to satisfy that thirst
[1:46:53] with worldly things well where did that
[1:46:57] come from it was your spirit being
[1:46:59] carnal trying to interpret that which
[1:47:01] was divine and so it said what you need
[1:47:06] is what the flesh needs and so it
[1:47:11] misinterpreted it but one day I came to
[1:47:15] the right interpretation and I met him
[1:47:18] and the spirit couldn't understand it
[1:47:20] and the flesh couldn't feel it and it
[1:47:24] changed my life her problem was that she
[1:47:28] was thirsting for God so as a woman the
[1:47:33] spirit interprets it as comfort so it
[1:47:36] interpreted it to her as a as a husband
[1:47:39] so she marries and it doesn't it washes
[1:47:43] out and then she's still searching for
[1:47:47] God she's been to church and she's heard
[1:47:51] enough word that it's a little fire down
[1:47:54] here but nothing could help it and so
[1:47:57] now the Spirit is trying to satisfy the
[1:47:59] fire that's in her soul that's been lit
[1:48:01] through the word messiahs come in there
[1:48:05] is the Living God Abraham he talked with
[1:48:09] him and there was a fire that was lit
[1:48:13] down into that soul that the spirit was
[1:48:16] trying to satisfy through the flesh she
[1:48:21] married she married married and and she
[1:48:30] was falling falling falling until one
[1:48:37] day she wakes up and there's a man in
[1:48:40] the bed with her that she's lived with
[1:48:43] during the night and she comes to her
[1:48:46] senses and she looks over there and it's
[1:48:48] not even her own husband it's not even
[1:48:51] covered by a vow she's just living with
[1:48:54] a man
[1:48:55] may be married to another because Jesus
[1:48:58] said yeah and he's not yours and could
[1:49:06] you imagine how she felt because in here
[1:49:08] was a seed and the seed was looking at
[1:49:12] the situation she was in and what have I
[1:49:14] sunk to it's like waking up after a
[1:49:17] drunk and realizing what you did at the
[1:49:19] party how could I've done all that so
[1:49:23] she went about her daily business and I
[1:49:25] in my mind I thinks you know she must
[1:49:27] have been pondering on suicide because
[1:49:32] her life had come to an end there was no
[1:49:34] life the end of the tunnel
[1:49:35] because she knew that because her
[1:49:38] parents told her to there was and the
[1:49:39] priest told her there was there's no
[1:49:41] redemption for you there's no salvation
[1:49:43] for you you've gone too far
[1:49:45] we don't want you in the home we've
[1:49:48] taken your name out of our house we
[1:49:50] don't even talk about you no more and
[1:49:54] she went to the to the well and look
[1:49:59] look at st. John for seems like we're
[1:50:03] going a long way around the mountain but
[1:50:05] but sometimes it takes a journey to
[1:50:09] understand something st. John 4 and
[1:50:13] verse 19 now he tells us you you've had
[1:50:18] five husbands and the one you have now
[1:50:22] he said for thou for thou in verse 17
[1:50:30] and the woman answered said I have no
[1:50:33] husband jesus said unto her that has
[1:50:36] well said
[1:50:37] I have no husband for thou hast had five
[1:50:40] husbands and him and he whom thou hast
[1:50:44] is not thy husband in that thou sayeth
[1:50:48] thou truly now when she heard that I
[1:50:57] guess she must have been a relationship
[1:50:59] to the Queen of Sheba down in here and
[1:51:06] she said you know he's revealed
[1:51:08] everything in my heart because the way
[1:51:10] that he said that she knew he didn't
[1:51:13] hear this through gossip it but it was
[1:51:15] something that went to the inner soul
[1:51:18] look what she says and the woman saith
[1:51:22] unto him sir I proceed now what did we
[1:51:27] read or what did we refer to in
[1:51:29] Deuteronomy 29 I did not give you a
[1:51:32] heart to perceive now she has a heart to
[1:51:36] perceive because God now has been
[1:51:39] leading her through the Ministry of
[1:51:41] Christ you know what makes a difference
[1:51:44] where you go to church because God can't
[1:51:47] quick an on word but as Jesus was
[1:51:51] talking to her we realized that her her
[1:51:54] vision her her inspiration her
[1:51:58] discernment was being elevated because
[1:52:03] it was a progressive revelation under
[1:52:05] the ministry of the word and now she
[1:52:09] says I perceive she was inspired I
[1:52:16] perceive that there are two prophet our
[1:52:21] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[1:52:23] you say that in Jerusalem so what does
[1:52:26] she actually say him now she said I've
[1:52:29] sought him all my life I've stood
[1:52:33] outside the temple the house of God
[1:52:35] where where you go to church I can't go
[1:52:37] in there but I've stood outside and
[1:52:39] tried to listen see what we're going on
[1:52:41] I've been to my church up here on the
[1:52:45] mountain where we got the golden calf
[1:52:48] but I never found him
[1:52:52] you're a prophet where can I find him
[1:52:57] where can I find him
[1:53:01] I've searched here in all the religious
[1:53:04] places a night I never found him but
[1:53:08] you're a prophet if anybody knows where
[1:53:11] I can find him you can tell me and there
[1:53:15] he was standing in front of her the gate
[1:53:20] and she didn't know him but she was
[1:53:23] getting pretty close he's as well
[1:53:27] he said you're up there you don't know
[1:53:29] what you worship those that priesthood
[1:53:31] wasn't even a called priesthood the King
[1:53:33] wasn't even of the royal lineage and and
[1:53:37] you worship Cavs idolatry and call it
[1:53:39] Christianity and you change the dates
[1:53:41] and the times of the feasts and you
[1:53:44] don't know what you worship now we have
[1:53:47] the true worship down there in Jerusalem
[1:53:50] but it was a changing dispensation you
[1:53:54] couldn't find him down there because he
[1:53:57] was standing there in front of her he
[1:53:59] did stand down there at one time but now
[1:54:01] he wasn't there no longer he said but
[1:54:04] God seeketh them to worship Him in truth
[1:54:06] in spirit he says still under the
[1:54:12] inspiration of God now he could have
[1:54:14] revealed it terrific - but he was
[1:54:17] bringing her up to the opening of that
[1:54:19] seventh seal what's the seventh trumpet
[1:54:22] reveal when the seventh trumpet blows
[1:54:25] the door the gate in heaven opens up and
[1:54:28] there's the throne it reveals deity what
[1:54:32] did the seventh seal do revealed deity
[1:54:34] among us so she was approaching now the
[1:54:40] seventh seal under the ministry of the
[1:54:44] messenger of that age she says you know
[1:54:51] when Messiah comes he's gonna teach us
[1:54:55] these things and he was God was only
[1:54:59] inspiring her and bringing her on a
[1:55:01] journey to a position that he's as well
[1:55:05] he says the one that's speaking to you
[1:55:09] I'm he
[1:55:12] no altar call brother Brown says did you
[1:55:16] notice her sins was forgiven how by the
[1:55:21] inspiration of word through faith to
[1:55:24] believe that he was the Messiah and here
[1:55:31] comes the church what's going on hey
[1:55:33] what hey what the anointing we could say
[1:55:36] was broke but not the revelation and she
[1:55:41] sit then she pondered that in her heart
[1:55:44] no altar call no begging you know people
[1:55:49] come to church today and they want to
[1:55:50] get saved and I say they come down to
[1:55:52] the bargaining table all right
[1:55:54] what do I got to give up and what can I
[1:55:56] keep you know you say dresses what about
[1:56:03] a swimming suit or maybe pants when I'm
[1:56:06] working in the garden well that's a hard
[1:56:09] one or what about when I'm riding horses
[1:56:13] but you ever consider not riding horses
[1:56:15] if you can't write it decently you know
[1:56:17] well I tell you what how about some
[1:56:20] pantaloons I don't know you know what
[1:56:21] those hour of adult was those skirts
[1:56:23] that look like a skirt but it was
[1:56:24] actually two legs and women could wear
[1:56:26] them and as long as they walked just
[1:56:27] right you couldn't tell they had pants
[1:56:29] on but if they want to get on a
[1:56:31] motorcycle or do what they want to do
[1:56:32] then they were pants you know they were
[1:56:34] dual purpose so anyway today they come
[1:56:39] to the bargaining table well you know I
[1:56:41] was baptized and Father Son and Holy
[1:56:43] Ghost but in my heart I was thinking
[1:56:46] about the Lord Jesus Christ so do I need
[1:56:48] to really you know be baptized again and
[1:56:53] it's a bargaining table but the new
[1:56:56] birth is supposed to be a death
[1:57:01] it's not supposed to be you know trying
[1:57:04] to bring somebody back to life and and
[1:57:06] putting them on life support you ain't
[1:57:11] gonna be on life support and come to a
[1:57:12] resurrection
[1:57:14] there's no life support its life in you
[1:57:18] and you've got to come to a death and
[1:57:20] there's no bargaining when death comes
[1:57:24] [Applause]
[1:57:25] there's no hiding place from death but
[1:57:30] he said I am the resurrection in life
[1:57:36] she ran through the street and said come
[1:57:38] see a man and the church was still
[1:57:42] wondering what was going on he said the
[1:57:45] church is still wondering what's going
[1:57:47] on today not talking about the bride the
[1:57:49] church you know John's disciples they
[1:57:55] didn't even know who he was after all
[1:57:57] those years of ministry after walking
[1:58:02] with him all those years they didn't
[1:58:03] know who he was Jesus had to tell him
[1:58:07] who he was he was that Elijah someone
[1:58:13] couldn't even leave him to follow Christ
[1:58:17] Enoch Enoch was listening to one of the
[1:58:22] services or maybe he was sitting there
[1:58:24] in the coffee table with him and Adam
[1:58:27] says you know there was a time I can
[1:58:32] remember that when all in the evening
[1:58:36] when when me and Eve used to walk
[1:58:39] through the garden God used to come down
[1:58:43] and he just put his arms around us and
[1:58:46] walk with him you know on the rest of
[1:58:49] their church was that was good you know
[1:58:51] but those days are past but we still
[1:58:53] worship Him in truth in spirit but Enoch
[1:58:56] was just a little bit different than the
[1:58:58] than the normal church member or the
[1:59:01] backslidden member or the unbeliever
[1:59:04] because in him that when he heard Adam
[1:59:07] talking about God coming down and
[1:59:09] putting his arms around
[1:59:12] or perhaps if it was like brother
[1:59:14] branham said and he laid him down and he
[1:59:17] tucked him into the bed and give him a
[1:59:19] goodnight kiss you know they said oh
[1:59:23] that's good you know Adam and we've
[1:59:25] heard this a lot but you know down in
[1:59:28] the heart of Enoch and remember any cuz
[1:59:31] you I'm not talking about Enoch I'm
[1:59:34] talking about you and I ain't talking
[1:59:37] about the woman at the well I'm talking
[1:59:38] about you I'm not talking about the
[1:59:41] Queen of Sheba I'm not talking about
[1:59:44] David but we find our identity
[1:59:47] identification in them and Enoch says I
[1:59:56] believe that and I still believe that
[2:00:01] there's a living God and I believe that
[2:00:04] I can have that experience because he
[2:00:07] loved God so much and what Adam had told
[2:00:10] him said of fire down into his heart
[2:00:15] let's turn to Hebrews 11 for a moment
[2:00:21] Hebrews 11 and verse 5 now remember each
[2:00:26] one of these characters of faith that
[2:00:29] what Paul has written here by the
[2:00:31] instant buy the inspiration of God is in
[2:00:35] particular reference to the person that
[2:00:38] we're talking about we're not talking
[2:00:42] about Abel
[2:00:43] we're trying to talk about Noah we're
[2:00:45] talking about Enoch so what I read here
[2:00:48] in verse 5 and verse 6 is is
[2:00:51] specifically revealing enix life so
[2:00:59] here's what I read by faith Enoch was
[2:01:02] translated so now I know that his
[2:01:08] translation involves faith and faith
[2:01:13] what you can't have faith until what God
[2:01:17] supplies word but all adheres that word
[2:01:22] has not changed not have
[2:01:25] but what God inspires of the word that
[2:01:28] he sent becomes faith so Enoch had a
[2:01:32] revelation and it was through this
[2:01:36] revelation that he was translated and
[2:01:39] I'm not talking about anything I'm
[2:01:41] talking about you and he was translated
[2:01:46] so he would not see death and Elijah was
[2:01:53] translated but he didn't say he was
[2:01:56] translated so he wouldn't see death it
[2:01:58] just said he was taken up now we find
[2:02:02] him at Mount Carmel and then we find him
[2:02:05] in revelation 11 Enoch couldn't be in
[2:02:09] Revelation 11 because he was translated
[2:02:11] that he would not see death so then he
[2:02:15] couldn't be slayed down on her on the
[2:02:16] streets
[2:02:18] Lazarus was resurrected not that he
[2:02:22] would not see death but he was
[2:02:23] resurrected but Enoch was translated and
[2:02:27] he wasn't coming back to die you ain't
[2:02:30] coming back to die when you're
[2:02:34] translated you take on a glorified body
[2:02:37] and go into a millennium and into
[2:02:40] eternity in that body so Enoch was
[2:02:48] translated by faith through the
[2:02:52] righteousness of faith now I'm beginning
[2:02:57] to see why he was Wow he could walk with
[2:02:59] Him because God supplied something to
[2:03:03] him and then he inspired him to what he
[2:03:08] brought to him and that word because God
[2:03:15] had translated him and before his
[2:03:19] translation he had this testimony that
[2:03:22] he pleased God now I heard one man said
[2:03:26] that he had a testimony that he pleased
[2:03:28] God
[2:03:29] I'm the Bride of Christ and I know I
[2:03:31] pleased God that's not the testimony the
[2:03:35] testimony is the life that you live by
[2:03:38] faith as a result of the revelation it's
[2:03:41] been given to you by God and that faith
[2:03:44] is being expressed through you in a life
[2:03:47] not in human obedience but through the
[2:03:51] life of the soul demanding that the
[2:03:54] spirit come subject to that by the power
[2:03:58] of the resurrection of Christ in you the
[2:04:02] outflowing power of Christ he had a life
[2:04:09] that please God because he had a
[2:04:14] revelation and that revelation changed
[2:04:17] his life before his translation he had
[2:04:27] this testimony that he pleased God but
[2:04:31] without faith it's impossible to please
[2:04:35] him for he that cometh to God must
[2:04:40] believe that he is all right so this is
[2:04:45] telling me we're not talking about
[2:04:47] somebody else we're talking about Enoch
[2:04:51] in order for Enoch to come to God he had
[2:04:54] to believe more than the church and just
[2:04:56] call on the name offer up sacrifices and
[2:04:58] go home he like David was thirsting for
[2:05:03] the presence of God he that seeketh God
[2:05:07] must believe that he is that he's he's
[2:05:11] able to come into his presence he's able
[2:05:13] to have a conference with he's able to
[2:05:15] speak to speak back he's a God of
[2:05:18] reality he's your God he's my God God
[2:05:24] only speaks to the prophets God speaks
[2:05:27] to his children they didn't call him the
[2:05:30] name of the Lord are called by the name
[2:05:32] of the Lord are you called by the name
[2:05:34] of the Lord the Lord descended with a
[2:05:36] shout and the message was the call of
[2:05:39] people sanctify them father by through
[2:05:43] thy truth and thy Word is truth
[2:05:45] what sanctifies you is what separates
[2:05:47] you it's the word he supplies and
[2:05:50] inspiration on that word that separates
[2:05:53] you it's faith so faith speaks of a
[2:05:58] separated life and you cannot walk with
[2:06:02] God without faith he that seeketh God
[2:06:13] for he that cometh to God must believe
[2:06:16] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[2:06:22] them that diligently seek Him
[2:06:25] so Enoch was seeking God and he sought
[2:06:32] him because he believed the testimony of
[2:06:35] Adam and it was inspired to him by God
[2:06:38] and it lit a fire and God was pleased
[2:06:49] and he come to him because it said he's
[2:06:53] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[2:06:56] you know what that means that means that
[2:06:59] he will reveal himself to you because
[2:07:01] that's the reward of the seeker it's not
[2:07:03] money it's not jobs it's not power it's
[2:07:08] not gifts the reward of those that seek
[2:07:11] is the reward of the seeker finds him
[2:07:14] who they seek and he reveals himself to
[2:07:18] the seeker that believes that he is the
[2:07:21] same yesterday today and forever
[2:07:23] Jesus Christ the same same as he wasn't
[2:07:27] Pentacles same as he was in the Old
[2:07:30] Testament
[2:07:34] same God and he that believeth that he
[2:07:41] is it creates a thirst because you know
[2:07:46] he is if I knew where his seat was I go
[2:07:51] find it I want to talk to him you know
[2:07:55] where he where you can find them is in
[2:07:58] your heart
[2:08:01] the hearts the altar but listen you got
[2:08:05] to have something on your altar before
[2:08:07] you'll come talk to you you know he
[2:08:10] wanted fellowship with Abel because in
[2:08:13] able there was a seed he wasn't the man
[2:08:15] Abel it was the seed it was that gene
[2:08:18] seed that soul that was in him anyone
[2:08:21] had fellowship with the house that he
[2:08:23] was in and he came and he and he had an
[2:08:27] altar but if God would have come to him
[2:08:30] God meets man at the altar he builds the
[2:08:34] altar and God comes to the altar and man
[2:08:37] comes to the altar that's the meeting
[2:08:38] place the mercy seat but if you meet him
[2:08:44] at the mercy seat and there's no blood
[2:08:45] it's a judgement seat because sin cannot
[2:08:48] stand in his presence without being
[2:08:50] judged so he had to bring a word to Abel
[2:09:01] and then he had to inspire that word to
[2:09:04] him it wasn't it wasn't that dead lamb
[2:09:08] in that blood that made him righteous it
[2:09:12] testified of the righteousness that was
[2:09:14] given to him by God through that
[2:09:16] revelation and he wanted fellowship with
[2:09:20] him in order to have fellowship with him
[2:09:23] he had to inspire him that he'd had the
[2:09:27] right thing on his altar that he could
[2:09:30] meet with him and God wanted to meet
[2:09:33] with you but you had to have something
[2:09:37] on your altar and that was the blood of
[2:09:40] Jesus Christ
[2:09:43] and the only way that you're saved is by
[2:09:47] grace which speaks of the election of
[2:09:50] God through faith that he had to inspire
[2:09:55] you to accept the gospel truth of Jesus
[2:09:59] Christ
[2:10:00] now you had blood on the altar now he
[2:10:02] could come and fellowship with you
[2:10:06] so Enoch sought him we read that over in
[2:10:11] Jude we have two verses in Jude verse 14
[2:10:16] and Enoch also the seventh from Adam oh
[2:10:24] let me make one more point here in in
[2:10:27] Hebrews I was thinking it Oh
[2:10:35] in Hebrews verse 5 chapter 11 verse 5
[2:10:39] and was not found so he was not found
[2:10:46] now in order for him to be not found
[2:10:48] somebody was looking for him he could
[2:10:53] not not be found if nobody was looking
[2:10:55] for him so there's going to be somebody
[2:11:00] looking for you his mom and his daddy
[2:11:05] were looking for him
[2:11:07] his sons and daughters was looking for
[2:11:10] him his wife was looking for him
[2:11:12] everybody was looking for him he didn't
[2:11:16] know where he was there was no
[2:11:17] implication of where he was they
[2:11:19] couldn't find him they won't find you
[2:11:22] either so now it says in in Jude fort
[2:11:28] verse 14 and Enoch also the seventh from
[2:11:32] Adam prophesied so now we know that
[2:11:37] Enoch had a prophecy and in having a
[2:11:41] prophecy remember that makes him a
[2:11:44] prophet he had a prophetic ulm Ennis
[2:11:47] tree I'm not talking about him I'm
[2:11:50] talking about you
[2:11:52] because it said take and eat this
[2:11:56] revelation that I have brought to you
[2:11:59] this in time message that's to bring
[2:12:04] rapture in faith you eat this and then
[2:12:08] you go and prophesy again John so under
[2:12:12] the eagle anointing we have a prophetic
[2:12:15] ulm essage and we find that Enoch had a
[2:12:19] prophetic 'message because he and you
[2:12:21] are the same
[2:12:22] he said that was brother Branham it said
[2:12:25] there an eagle anointing not a city in
[2:12:28] Eagle not a walking eagle a flying eagle
[2:12:32] one that was moving one that was was on
[2:12:37] the move life in him and you prophesy
[2:12:43] John again prophesy to who you're not
[2:12:48] gonna prophesy to himself just have to
[2:12:52] prophesy to somebody so Enoch prophesied
[2:12:58] of these now who is that you have to go
[2:13:03] back and read verses 1 through 13 of who
[2:13:06] Jude is talking about contend for the
[2:13:09] faith for the revelation that was
[2:13:11] delivered to the Saints he talks about a
[2:13:15] backslidden
[2:13:16] that came out of Egypt and died in the
[2:13:19] wilderness because they didn't follow
[2:13:20] after the truth he talked about fallen
[2:13:24] angels that lost their estate he talked
[2:13:27] about he talked about Balaam he talks
[2:13:30] about Cain he talks about Cora
[2:13:35] these he prophesied of these whos these
[2:13:40] not people spirits so who's the end time
[2:13:46] people going to be prophets on these
[2:13:49] Antichrist spirit many faces many forms
[2:13:54] but same spirit and Enoch prophesied of
[2:13:58] these that means he was preaching about
[2:14:01] that in his day
[2:14:03] he was preaching against the backslidden
[2:14:06] church he was preaching against he pain
[2:14:10] in his religion he was preaching against
[2:14:13] the cold indifferent church that wasn't
[2:14:15] seeking the presence of God he
[2:14:17] prophesied he preached because of the
[2:14:21] revelation it was given to God from God
[2:14:24] to him 65 years he didn't walk with God
[2:14:29] and now he has Methuselah so Methuselah
[2:14:34] is connected to the revelation that was
[2:14:38] given to Enoch because he didn't walk
[2:14:41] with God because he had a boy he walked
[2:14:44] with God because he had a revelation and
[2:14:47] God revealed to him that he was pouring
[2:14:51] out judgment against those that he was
[2:14:54] looking at through the revelation it was
[2:14:56] given to him that actually came to the
[2:14:59] Word of of Adam and came to the presence
[2:15:02] of God and realized in the presence of
[2:15:05] God the condition of the world how did
[2:15:09] you recognize the world when you were
[2:15:12] blind again and the Spirit of God came
[2:15:15] in you and the light open your eyes and
[2:15:18] you looked at the world different than
[2:15:21] you ever did
[2:15:22] and a revelation came to him in
[2:15:28] connection with the judgment that God
[2:15:30] had revealed to him on that generation
[2:15:33] said when this child dies the deluge
[2:15:38] will come and he had a baby and he says
[2:15:45] your name is my fool ah his revelation
[2:15:52] was embodied in the name of his son not
[2:15:55] just a deluge was coming but there was a
[2:15:57] judgment being poured out on that
[2:16:00] central generation sin had been
[2:16:03] accumulating since Klain walked out of
[2:16:05] the presence of God it didn't start
[2:16:10] overnight it started back when he walked
[2:16:12] out of the presence
[2:16:14] but he built temples because his seed
[2:16:19] built temples the tower Babel and he
[2:16:26] built a false religion it was a glorious
[2:16:28] religion it was beautiful
[2:16:30] he created music God created a heart to
[2:16:35] sing King created a heart to play God
[2:16:41] created a heart that would speak through
[2:16:43] a voice Kaden created trumpets and
[2:16:48] guitars and cymbals and those are not
[2:16:51] evil but I'm just he was he he his
[2:16:54] children they were great singers and
[2:16:57] worshipers and instrument players and
[2:17:01] I'm not speaking against that I'm not
[2:17:03] what is it Church Christ or whatever
[2:17:05] they have been bleating music in the
[2:17:06] church because we know that David said
[2:17:10] let him play with instruments of strings
[2:17:13] horns whatever symbol sticks worship him
[2:17:16] but it must be music from the heart not
[2:17:19] talent the talent is only given to
[2:17:22] express what's in the heart and if the
[2:17:25] talent is expressing something that's
[2:17:26] not in the heart then it's not music to
[2:17:29] God it's music to the church
[2:17:31] it inspires a human spirit it can make
[2:17:34] you cry it can make it laugh it can make
[2:17:37] you feel brave it can make you march it
[2:17:40] can make you go into battle but it's
[2:17:42] what's in the heart that God looks at
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:51] Sahin ik had a prophecy and it says
[2:17:58] behold the Lord cometh with ten
[2:18:02] thousands of his Saints to execute
[2:18:05] judgment upon all and to convince all
[2:18:07] that are ungodly among them of all their
[2:18:11] ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
[2:18:12] committed and of all their hard speeches
[2:18:17] which ungodly sinners have spoken
[2:18:19] against him so his ministry reached all
[2:18:27] the way to the
[2:18:28] second coming of Christ but he ain't
[2:18:36] gonna be there but his relations will
[2:18:41] the bride of Jesus Christ because she's
[2:18:49] gonna have a prophecy and it's gonna
[2:18:52] speak the same thing that he is
[2:18:53] prophesied because God doesn't change
[2:18:56] his mind about his word so now we go
[2:19:01] back to Genesis again and we find that
[2:19:08] that Enoch now he walked with God and
[2:19:12] begat methuselah and he walked with God
[2:19:19] three hundred years so that means he
[2:19:22] preached three hundred years so Enoch
[2:19:27] had three witnesses he had a sign child
[2:19:32] that was divinely his name was divinely
[2:19:34] inspired by God and then when that boy
[2:19:38] died that's when the judgment was coming
[2:19:41] well Yannick you named that child right
[2:19:45] right you say God revealed that to you
[2:19:47] that when that boy died that the
[2:19:49] judgment was coming that's right you've
[2:19:52] heard my message you know what I
[2:19:55] preached against um you seen these
[2:19:56] things out here he said wool how old is
[2:20:00] he gonna be when he dies he said I don't
[2:20:03] know I said the Lord knows I don't know
[2:20:05] the day or the hour that he's gonna die
[2:20:07] but I know one thing he's gonna die
[2:20:10] because God said he was gonna die one
[2:20:14] things were certain he's gonna die
[2:20:15] because God said when he dies the deluge
[2:20:19] the flood the judgments coming when he
[2:20:22] dies so he had a son child and he had a
[2:20:28] divinely inspired prophecy a prophetic
[2:20:32] ulm Ennis tree and he wrote the entire
[2:20:37] Bible in stone
[2:20:40] now he might not have been able to read
[2:20:43] that Bible because John didn't
[2:20:46] understand everything that was in the
[2:20:48] book of Revelation but he wrote it under
[2:20:51] divine inspiration and the author knew
[2:20:53] exactly what he was writing and Enoch
[2:20:56] may not have known but that revelation
[2:21:00] and with that revelation comes to
[2:21:03] prophecy it was the only thing that came
[2:21:09] through the judgments of God was his own
[2:21:11] word the pyramid so they had the pyramid
[2:21:16] to look at and wonder at it and they
[2:21:19] said what is it this is well it's a
[2:21:22] revelation of God the entire plan of
[2:21:25] redemption is in that in that stone well
[2:21:28] what is it well I don't know he just
[2:21:30] told me to build it by divine
[2:21:33] inspiration I built it according to his
[2:21:35] blueprint to is revelation it's the
[2:21:39] entire plan of redemption is in there
[2:21:42] well I don't know it was the only thing
[2:21:48] that was on the earth not talking about
[2:21:50] the Ark that made it through because
[2:21:53] God's Word doesn't pass away it doesn't
[2:21:55] fail and it stands yet today I can go
[2:22:01] over there and I can take my Bible and
[2:22:03] read the prophecy of of Enoch and I can
[2:22:07] look at that pyramid I can't see a Sun
[2:22:09] anymore but I can look at the pyramid
[2:22:13] and I can look at that Bible and I can
[2:22:16] say the god of the god of Enoch lives
[2:22:19] and his words gonna come to pass because
[2:22:24] Enoch is you Enoch is me and so by
[2:22:31] divine inspiration he names the son and
[2:22:36] calls his name Methuselah and I thought
[2:22:40] you know this is interesting now here's
[2:22:43] a man walking with God and I don't know
[2:22:48] that you can eat any more spiritual or
[2:22:52] any closer to God than
[2:22:54] walking with him so we can say that he's
[2:22:59] pretty heavenly minded he's pretty
[2:23:01] spiritual because in order to walk with
[2:23:03] God you have to separate from the world
[2:23:06] so he was living a separated life by
[2:23:09] faith and he walked with God for 300
[2:23:14] years and then I thought it was unusual
[2:23:18] it says and he had sons and daughters
[2:23:24] walking with God still having a
[2:23:28] relationship with his wife still being a
[2:23:31] daddy
[2:23:32] he'll being a husband still being a
[2:23:37] human and at the same time separated he
[2:23:43] was separated from his wife but he loved
[2:23:46] his wife and he had relationship with
[2:23:50] his wife but he was separated by faith
[2:23:54] and nobody went with him he went alone
[2:23:58] in when we go we ain't going together
[2:24:02] holding hands we're gonna step across
[2:24:05] one by one just as death but it's gonna
[2:24:08] be a unit it's a Bonnie but it's it's
[2:24:10] you in Christ that stepped across that
[2:24:13] chasm that steps over death and puts it
[2:24:16] under our feet with a glorified body
[2:24:23] Enoch is you and that's why you believe
[2:24:27] this message because this is the name of
[2:24:30] God that's coming this day this is the
[2:24:33] gate
[2:24:34] you can't go back you can't go back to
[2:24:37] the Pentecost you can't go back to
[2:24:39] Baptist and loser those were gates but
[2:24:43] it's the gate where his presence is that
[2:24:45] where his name is the son of man not son
[2:24:50] of God son of man not brother Branham
[2:24:54] I'm talking about son of man the
[2:24:57] manifestation of the sons of God the
[2:24:59] unveiling what's going to unveil you
[2:25:01] it'll be the word the word through you
[2:25:06] bringing his sons to sonship even to
[2:25:10] include the changing of the role the
[2:25:12] body speaks on Adam lost that but it's a
[2:25:21] very year store back to the sons of God
[2:25:27] as we bear our heads
[2:25:30] Heavenly Father your word is great your
[2:25:35] word is true your word is you but Lord
[2:25:42] we don't want just your word we want
[2:25:43] that word quick and made alive that same
[2:25:46] word that was in the beginning that was
[2:25:50] with God that was God that was made
[2:25:52] flesh that same word to come down on the
[2:25:56] day of Pentecost and Tabernacles itself
[2:25:58] and the people and as tabernacled itself
[2:26:02] in your children all down through the
[2:26:04] church ages even to this day but to come
[2:26:08] to it to fullness of its fruition any he
[2:26:13] thirsted for him and because it he
[2:26:16] thirsted for you he sought you and
[2:26:19] because he sought you you revealed
[2:26:22] yourself to him just as you did to
[2:26:24] Luther just as you did to Paul now he
[2:26:29] sought you with all his heart like the
[2:26:30] woman at the well but he couldn't find
[2:26:32] you and because he couldn't find you
[2:26:34] wasn't satisfied all but it when he met
[2:26:38] you on that road it changed his life it
[2:26:44] changed our life and you've allowed us
[2:26:48] by faith by inspiration to separate from
[2:26:52] the world and still to be able to live
[2:26:54] in the world as any continued to have
[2:26:58] children while he walked with you a
[2:27:02] human man with human feelings and yet he
[2:27:06] was walking in another dimension walking
[2:27:10] in two dimensions at the same time but
[2:27:13] controlled by a higher dimension
[2:27:15] he separated himself from the
[2:27:17] backslidden church and the unbelievers
[2:27:20] he walked a separated life in faith but
[2:27:26] he had children he loved his children
[2:27:28] and he taught his children he preached
[2:27:30] to them but he was one out of a
[2:27:34] generation but I remember your word that
[2:27:42] you looked down saw a lot and you
[2:27:46] remembered Abraham the Lord let us not
[2:27:52] be concerned with who's going and who
[2:27:55] ain't going but Lord with this that
[2:27:58] we're going and to testify of your
[2:28:01] coming in a reality of your revealing
[2:28:04] and your presence and to who those seeds
[2:28:08] lay in it will light a fire of thirst
[2:28:12] and hunger that nothing can satisfy
[2:28:15] until you come to them and reveal them
[2:28:20] yourself to them as you have revealed
[2:28:23] yourself to us in Jesus name Lord we
[2:28:29] pray amen I'm reminded of a of a story
[2:28:36] that brother Brennan told he was going
[2:28:41] to a meeting and he'd arrived in a car
[2:28:43] and there was a great crowd on the
[2:28:46] outside trying to get into the into the
[2:28:49] place where they were having the meeting
[2:28:52] and there was a little blind girl you
[2:28:58] remember the story she was she didn't
[2:29:01] got separated from her daddy and
[2:29:02] everybody was trying to get in there and
[2:29:06] they were just pushing and bumping her
[2:29:09] she was getting in people's way and they
[2:29:10] were one thing on their mind get in
[2:29:12] there to where they can get a good seat
[2:29:14] to hear the prophet and see some
[2:29:17] miracles maybe get prayed for but his
[2:29:21] highs fell on that little black girl
[2:29:24] that seemed to be so insignificant and
[2:29:26] helpless
[2:29:28] so he said that he he walked her through
[2:29:33] the crowd he had that raincoat on or
[2:29:35] whatever it was he had himself kind of
[2:29:38] camouflage so they couldn't know who he
[2:29:40] was and the little girl was being bumped
[2:29:42] around and trying to find her dad and
[2:29:44] saying daddy daddy kind of like blind
[2:29:47] bartimaeus Jesus Jesus get out of the
[2:29:52] way
[2:29:53] where is it yeah I got a good view Oh
[2:29:55] somebody's in my way let me touch him
[2:29:57] and so he said he positioned himself in
[2:30:04] the such a way that she had to bump into
[2:30:06] him and she bumped into him and he says
[2:30:10] oh he says little girl you know like oh
[2:30:15] what's this what are you looking for oh
[2:30:19] she says I'm blind and and I'm looking
[2:30:23] for my daddy he says all he says what
[2:30:27] can I help you she said if you'll get me
[2:30:29] down there to the healer he'll pray for
[2:30:32] me and how fine I did he said oh he said
[2:30:39] you don't believe that do you
[2:30:41] yes I do you just get me down there now
[2:30:44] find my daddy then that world woman was
[2:30:52] headed to a well and he just kind of
[2:30:55] positioned himself
[2:31:00] so that she would bump into him Oh Oh Oh
[2:31:05] what are you doing
[2:31:08] and one day he stood in front of you and
[2:31:15] he just stood in such a way you couldn't
[2:31:18] go around him you couldn't go under him
[2:31:21] you couldn't go over and you bumped into
[2:31:24] something that was real you didn't know
[2:31:28] what it was but you knew it was real
[2:31:32] he might be standing in front of you
[2:31:35] tonight because he wants to talk with
[2:31:42] you brother Gerald if you'll come god
[2:31:51] bless you
[2:32:00] amen
[2:32:02] thank God for the word appreciate our
[2:32:08] brothers ministry because he preaches
[2:32:11] the word it's not man it's the word amen
[2:32:17] there are so many that do preach about a
[2:32:20] man but he's preaching about the word
[2:32:23] I'm bringing us into a personal
[2:32:26] relationship with the word amen and
[2:32:29] that's what God wants us to do amen
[2:32:34] he doesn't want us to put the emphasis
[2:32:36] on a man but on Christ a man whether
[2:32:40] he's had a man with a message but as I
[2:32:43] said one time I said you couldn't
[2:32:45] recognize the messenger that's good but
[2:32:48] I said what good is it I said unless you
[2:32:51] take the message and recognize the
[2:32:54] message is like a messenger coming to
[2:32:57] your door and you recognize him and he
[2:33:00] come from the government and for the
[2:33:03] post office or wherever and he's got a
[2:33:06] message for you and and and you got to
[2:33:08] take it and you got a sign for it and so
[2:33:11] oh thank you that's it so you take the
[2:33:14] message in and you just lay it on the
[2:33:15] table and leave it a man there's a lot
[2:33:20] of people have done that a lot of people
[2:33:22] are doing that there's this in a tent
[2:33:25] instead of taking that and acknowledging
[2:33:27] the messenger thank God for the
[2:33:29] messenger praise the name of the Lord
[2:33:31] now what's the message hey man what's
[2:33:34] the message

[2:34:04] password and I've even had a token as it
[2:34:08] were and I've got to confirm the thing
[2:34:11] by the grace of God a man so that's good
[2:34:15] you know we're thankful for the
[2:34:18] messenger
[2:34:19] but thankful are we for the message and
[2:34:22] there's more to the message than just
[2:34:25] well being baptized in the name of the
[2:34:28] Lord Jesus Christ there's more to the
[2:34:29] message than the oneness of the Godhead
[2:34:32] or the serpent seed but rather we got to
[2:34:35] get to the person of the message the the
[2:34:40] one that gave all of this to the Prophet
[2:34:42] the one that revealed all of this to the
[2:34:44] prophet a man a vindication of who he is
[2:34:48] the Alpha the Omega the word in the
[2:34:51] beginning was the word the Word was with
[2:34:52] God the Word was God a man and the Word
[2:34:55] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[2:34:58] the word is made flesh and Will's in us

[2:35:19] sir brother I tell you this DeeDee who's
[2:35:21] that I praise the Lord

[2:35:25] preach I'm like what I said I was going
[2:35:27] to preach concerning Enoch
[2:35:30] now I Nana and it's been a burden on my
[2:35:33] heart that way you know I'm walking with
[2:35:34] God and I had maybe the Lord has been
[2:35:37] waiting for this for our brother to come
[2:35:39] and lay this foundation but he did he's
[2:35:41] been laid you know last night and then
[2:35:44] earlier yesterday and again today
[2:35:47] maybe tomorrow or whatever Thor would
[2:35:49] lay on his heart but but again he said
[2:35:53] it's you a man it's you it's you it's
[2:35:56] you and it's good to go back and
[2:35:58] recognize Enoch but what about you
[2:36:01] can you compare yourself to Enoch amen
[2:36:04] brother God has laid it in tonight so we
[2:36:07] are without excuse
[2:36:09] absolutely without excuse because our
[2:36:13] brother is going to heal right if we
[2:36:15] fail he's going to raise the judgment
[2:36:17] against us with this word that he that
[2:36:20] he minister tonight and we can't say we
[2:36:23] didn't know this we didn't know that we
[2:36:25] didn't know no no no God a God of God
[2:36:27] will bring up by our brother Macon's and
[2:36:30] listen here's that voice that's not him
[2:36:32] that's me of me I was ministering
[2:36:37] through him amen
[2:36:39] since the prophet of God had to get
[2:36:41] himself out of the way for their for
[2:36:43] their to manifest the gifts he had to
[2:36:46] get himself out of the way to preach the
[2:36:48] word a man it is the anointing is just a
[2:36:52] different level of anointing a main one
[2:36:55] is for this gift another one for that
[2:36:57] given another one for the preaching of
[2:36:58] the word by the grace of Almighty God so
[2:37:02] thank God for our brother and the world
[2:37:06] amen
[2:37:07] that his emphasis is the word and I
[2:37:10] noticed I noticed I noticed that last
[2:37:12] night when he was ministering I said
[2:37:14] Lord as it is the word I said it's the
[2:37:17] word it's the word and I said he's
[2:37:20] constantly trying to bring our attention
[2:37:22] to the word and to the revelation and as
[2:37:28] I've been talking to our brother here
[2:37:30] and I used to remember I said dude don't
[2:37:33] they don't take a spoken word book I
[2:37:35] said and just go preach on it don't you
[2:37:39] do that
[2:37:39] did you taking them put it in here and I
[2:37:42] said now preach it I said you'll preach
[2:37:45] the word a man and I'm
[2:37:48] sure that this is seventy of is
[2:37:50] appreciated our brothers ministry last
[2:37:52] evening and again this evening because
[2:37:54] it's the word and I thought about it I
[2:37:57] said O Lord I said he's reaching christ
[2:38:01] he's reached in salvation he's reaching
[2:38:04] the ISIS preacher redemption not just
[2:38:07] you know goddess and a prophet so I the
[2:38:10] devil believes that Satan and over this
[2:38:13] doctor that doctrine the devil believes
[2:38:15] all those doctrines he knows that's the
[2:38:18] truth and then not only that but he
[2:38:21] knows more about this hour then it's a
[2:38:24] lot of so-called believers because the
[2:38:26] Bible says he and he knows his time is
[2:38:28] short but a revelation he got what a
[2:38:33] faith that he got rather and his faith
[2:38:36] is safe he knows his time is short he's
[2:38:38] come down with great wrath so do you
[2:38:41] know that your time is short
[2:38:42] amen brother I tell you this and after
[2:38:47] hearing what we heard last night and
[2:38:48] hearing what we were it again tonight we
[2:38:50] ought to realize that time is short Amy
[2:38:55] yeah our brother took that word there
[2:38:58] and he takes it right on back I like
[2:39:01] that he talked and he said not talking
[2:39:03] about he like I'm talking about you it's
[2:39:06] good so I can't you identify with that
[2:39:10] can you identify with that what he's
[2:39:13] reading here about Enoch he's reading
[2:39:15] about you hey man praise the name of the
[2:39:19] Lord because you know what with God and
[2:39:21] and that's that's what I wanted was
[2:39:23] going to preach on what does it mean to
[2:39:25] walk with God you know and and so on he
[2:39:28] walked with God and he was not because
[2:39:31] God took everything so brother - what
[2:39:33] with God is here you're going to do
[2:39:35] something that pleases God yeah a man is
[2:39:39] going to go you're going to do something
[2:39:40] that well again then it's going to be
[2:39:44] anointed hallelujah it's got the aunts
[2:39:47] got the anointing that it'll do for you
[2:39:49] when it did for Enoch hallelujah
[2:39:53] oh he want me in that revelation and
[2:39:56] walked in that River
[2:39:57] should I walk into that revelation til
[2:40:00] he got more and more and more separated
[2:40:02] from the world and the things of the
[2:40:05] world he walked with God he had
[2:40:09] relationships with with this one as our
[2:40:11] brother brought out and that one in so
[2:40:14] many a right hand into intimate
[2:40:16] relationships and so on but it's greater
[2:40:20] this greatest relationship he was was
[2:40:22] was with God to see what he saw and the
[2:40:27] know what he knew all brother he was
[2:40:30] close to God hallelujah walk with God we
[2:40:36] gotta walk with God walking with the
[2:40:38] word walking with the message and
[2:40:39] brother again that our my brother's
[2:40:42] ministry last night and a ministering in
[2:40:44] the night is God is my god proving
[2:40:47] whether or not you're walking with Him a
[2:40:49] man whether or not you're identifying
[2:40:52] with the revelation that God is
[2:40:55] revealing has he not being a man praise
[2:40:59] the name of the Lord so it's in our
[2:41:01] motives in our attitude in our
[2:41:03] objectives we gotta please God and it's
[2:41:08] all got to be based on the word for this
[2:41:10] day
[2:41:11] it gotta be based on the word for this
[2:41:13] age by the grace of God it's got to be
[2:41:16] what God is doing and brother listen
[2:41:20] deadliness and believe it that our
[2:41:22] motives our attitudes our objectives
[2:41:24] pleases God does it whether it's here in
[2:41:28] this assembly whether it's a and if it
[2:41:30] do well what is women do if your motive
[2:41:32] objective and that who doesn't please
[2:41:34] God at work and in everyday living it
[2:41:37] doesn't please God here no no I got a
[2:41:40] please got here you're not going to
[2:41:41] receive the word the way you should if
[2:41:43] it's not right over there it's not right
[2:41:45] here you got to come in the spirit a man
[2:41:50] and a nu and go to walk with God in the
[2:41:53] revealed Word there's too many walking
[2:41:56] with the devil that's the truth they
[2:42:00] think they're walking with government or
[2:42:01] walking with the devil and let me repeat
[2:42:03] it again
[2:42:04] and because the messenger reminded us
[2:42:07] and warned us that the Christ and the
[2:42:09] Antichrist are twins
[2:42:10] in the same church so do you know which
[2:42:13] one years serving they're twins of the
[2:42:18] same church why because they got the
[2:42:23] word you know except the devil got 99.9
[2:42:26] percent God got on two percent a man -
[2:42:31] they're twins sometimes you know you
[2:42:34] have twins out here and only mom and dad
[2:42:36] can tell them apart
[2:42:38] sometimes mother they can't even tell
[2:42:41] them apart and I've known where parents
[2:42:44] of many twins or triplets and and
[2:42:46] they've had to head to head their names
[2:42:48] on Honduras so they know which was which
[2:42:51] a main God knows God knows are we
[2:42:59] walking with God or walking with the
[2:43:00] devil that's good brother it's good cane
[2:43:07] walk with the devil able walk with God
[2:43:12] not Elvis brother we're huh I tell you
[2:43:17] Verena don't be like as our brother
[2:43:21] brother tonight he not be like that I
[2:43:23] tell you this he had a hunger and he had
[2:43:28] a first for thought he loved God because
[2:43:35] he knew God loved him a man and love
[2:43:40] will produce law that's where like the
[2:43:44] problem of God did say he said why did
[2:43:46] he do all this why did he allow all this
[2:43:48] why did he permit all this he says so he
[2:43:50] could reveal his character to you and
[2:43:52] you would love him for himself
[2:43:55] hallelujah he's a wonderful the
[2:44:00] revelation and you got it now
[2:44:03] that is forever settled I like it
[2:44:07] concerning the the verdict
[2:44:10] he had to do it before he could bless us
[2:44:13] with anything else he had the justify us
[2:44:15] Amen Saint was there accusing and
[2:44:18] accusing and a kerosene to finally got
[2:44:20] stood up the lamb was slain before the
[2:44:23] foundation of the world
[2:44:24] and they said look say you get out of
[2:44:26] here that's my son that's my daughter so
[2:44:29] on praise the name of the Lord he
[2:44:34] justified us so he could fit he could do
[2:44:36] the rest thank the Lord
[2:44:40] oh praise His name so brother let's make
[2:44:45] sure we're walking with God not the
[2:44:46] devil and their River oh well I'm not
[2:44:49] walking with the devil I don't drink I
[2:44:51] don't smoke
[2:44:53] well maybe I could say neither does the
[2:44:55] devil especially when he when he's
[2:45:01] identifying with religion and remember
[2:45:04] he's not worried about that religion of
[2:45:06] there he got that they're already
[2:45:10] worshipping him thinking they're
[2:45:13] worshiping Jesus and you got as I said
[2:45:16] believers worshipping the devil thinking
[2:45:18] they're worshiping Jesus
[2:45:21] that's how that's how serious it is so
[2:45:25] brother he's not worried about that I
[2:45:27] tell you where he's we're going to be
[2:45:28] right where God is he's gonna be right
[2:45:31] where God is doing this and doing that
[2:45:33] and doing something else it's gonna be
[2:45:36] in you in your life in your home in your
[2:45:39] job no matter what if he is he's called
[2:45:41] me right there to hinder your walk with
[2:45:45] God
[2:45:47] god help us oh my god I got to say this
[2:45:54] too just to say just to show our
[2:45:57] appreciation for the brother for the
[2:45:59] ministry and for what he's brought light
[2:46:00] brought out and that struck me it was
[2:46:05] good the bargaining table I'll tell you
[2:46:14] when it comes to a bargaining table is
[2:46:16] the devil got the bargaining table you
[2:46:18] know you love the bargaining table if
[2:46:20] you do this I'll do this if you do that
[2:46:22] in here yeah oh you'll get this you'll
[2:46:24] get that you use a compromise what the
[2:46:29] bargaining table does is compromise yeah
[2:46:33] that's what you got to do and you know
[2:46:35] we've had when we were living in Mount
[2:46:37] Pearl there and when we used to have a
[2:46:39] lot of wouldn't call it there are those
[2:46:43] yard sales and you know and you know the
[2:46:47] ones that we had the greatest problem
[2:46:49] with were the religious people yeah and
[2:46:54] the others were coming in and look at
[2:46:56] the insane yeah I'll take this I'll take
[2:46:58] this I take what happen and I remember
[2:47:01] and in particular I remember we had some
[2:47:03] religious people come in and I knew that
[2:47:05] they were they were really religious in
[2:47:08] the sense that in the sense that the
[2:47:10] woman had long hair and you're trans
[2:47:12] like woman you know very modest clothing
[2:47:14] and the man was very modest and so on
[2:47:17] and
[2:47:19] nice annoying they're talking but they
[2:47:22] were gonna pick up all this piccolo that
[2:47:24] all right now can we bargain over this
[2:47:28] well we'll give you this much work
[2:47:33] whereas the others just come as is here
[2:47:37] but they didn't want to do that even
[2:47:41] though it was you know that we we've
[2:47:43] used about of a sign and says listen our
[2:47:45] prices are the cheapest in Canada the
[2:47:50] TVs in Canada and yeah and yet still
[2:47:53] they they they're these so-called
[2:47:54] Christians were satisfied and knowing
[2:47:57] that others would come in and we didn't
[2:47:59] know they're Christians are not and we
[2:48:00] would say now 10% of all this goes to
[2:48:03] goes to charity goes through church and
[2:48:05] some would even give us more than what
[2:48:07] we asked o church yeah only said what
[2:48:12] you can keep the change
[2:48:13] we know we don't want to change brother
[2:48:17] a lot of world we're living in I tell
[2:48:20] you this when it comes to religion you
[2:48:22] got it you got a Brit judge everything
[2:48:24] by the word let's compare it to the word
[2:48:28] everything it is the distant Saints but
[2:48:31] I get it man thought my way is forever
[2:48:33] settled in heaven don't bargain with the
[2:48:40] devil that's good
[2:48:43] go get go get the DVD and listen to it
[2:48:45] again they man maybe we're going to get
[2:48:49] our brother come back and preach on the
[2:48:51] bargaining table a man yes we made will
[2:48:57] run with me we need that someone to
[2:48:59] enlarge on it we need something to break
[2:49:02] on it we need something to exhort on
[2:49:03] today and here is more more a greater
[2:49:06] revelation of it why to see that the
[2:49:10] devil is out there getting us to bargain
[2:49:12] with our faith bargain with what we
[2:49:15] believe you know you can still believe
[2:49:17] this and I'll give you this you still
[2:49:20] believe that but I'll do this yeah
[2:49:25] hey hey man praise the Lord brother
[2:49:34] Brown said he was you know what Jesus
[2:49:36] was be doing when he when he did that he
[2:49:38] was being an example he said for the
[2:49:40] Deacons I told the Deacons here in the
[2:49:44] church I said well I guess I'll add the
[2:49:46] group by some whips hey man and give
[2:49:49] them and give that give all the dickens
[2:49:50] a whip a man I guess there's a lot of
[2:49:53] Deacons would resign
[2:49:55] that's right brother yeah because why
[2:50:00] because in the temple they had
[2:50:01] bargaining tables you know they're Duke
[2:50:05] we don't bargain here for you know to
[2:50:07] exchange money you could go into a
[2:50:09] bargain here you know divided by this to
[2:50:11] the doves for sacrifices or maybe the
[2:50:13] Lambs or whatever they're what we call
[2:50:18] it a yard sale they call it a temple
[2:50:20] sale I guess
[2:50:22] Valentina this when Jesus saw it les
[2:50:25] said yeah hey do we have that attitude
[2:50:28] do we ever had to do the Jesus saying
[2:50:31] and I know a lot of people think that's
[2:50:34] not a Christian attitude oh yeah you
[2:50:38] call that man a Christian you call that
[2:50:41] me and you know a trial of God a servant
[2:50:43] of God he was gone
[2:50:46] anybody but again in this I heard we was
[2:50:48] people were thinking he's not a
[2:50:50] Christian here he was a Christian he
[2:50:51] wouldn't he wouldn't say that he
[2:50:53] wouldn't act like that he certainly
[2:50:54] wouldn't take a whip and whip them out
[2:50:57] of the temple a man he go ahead brother
[2:51:01] he got there and he went in and and he
[2:51:03] whipped about idiot get out of here and
[2:51:06] all the animals and all and overthrew
[2:51:09] the tables of the moneychangers and he
[2:51:12] didn't stop to pick it up
[2:51:22] yeah dog meat oh now you call that
[2:51:27] Christian yeah see see the man got one
[2:51:31] idea Christianity God got another but
[2:51:34] see where did they get that idea they
[2:51:36] got it from the devil and he just
[2:51:40] whipped them out with and as we when we
[2:51:43] were in Israel and we saw some repairs
[2:51:46] going on there in a in Jerusalem
[2:51:48] and maybe none the Westside there's
[2:51:50] someone near the near the the eastern
[2:51:53] wall and and our guide said if you see
[2:51:57] that over there and he said where
[2:51:59] they're working I said yeah man we all
[2:52:01] see yeah he said well he said that's
[2:52:02] where Jesus he said whip them out of the
[2:52:04] temple he see needs to do it again and
[2:52:10] he was a Jew of Salvage that he needs to
[2:52:12] do it again why because my there's too
[2:52:15] much emphasis or the money and that is
[2:52:17] even around this message amen there's
[2:52:22] too many preachers that are taking the
[2:52:24] tithe and the tithe and the tithe and
[2:52:25] the tight and they're not going to share
[2:52:27] with nobody because they wanted a man
[2:52:30] that's not right
[2:52:33] remember the time that we need went into
[2:52:35] the sanctuary the tithe that went into
[2:52:38] the temple in the Old Testament that the
[2:52:41] Levites and the priesthood would only go
[2:52:43] in and take what they need it not what
[2:52:47] they wanted what they did and you had
[2:52:50] this need all right go get it
[2:52:52] yeah there's need go get it but you
[2:52:54] didn't go in there just take it and bake
[2:52:57] it somewhere in your tent there's a lot
[2:53:03] of preachers as I say that are that are
[2:53:05] that are that are ordering the tithing
[2:53:07] there
[2:53:09] and they keep their hands on they when
[2:53:10] they won't share it with anybody I even
[2:53:16] had an email and somebody asked me I
[2:53:18] said brother can you help me with this
[2:53:22] and he said he said if a minister is
[2:53:26] getting more tities than he needs
[2:53:28] he said easy obligated to share that
[2:53:31] with a pastor or a minister there that's
[2:53:34] not getting sufficient funds you know to
[2:53:36] me they're nice I said he is absolutely
[2:53:39] obligate additional sites
[2:53:43] absolutely we're that other and that
[2:53:46] other than the other ministries out
[2:53:49] there to help them there's a reason why
[2:53:57] our brother brought it about deciding
[2:53:59] tonight because when he touched on I
[2:54:03] said Lord I said why did he say that for
[2:54:08] what it says on that for is the Laureus
[2:54:10] summer I said there must be a reason I
[2:54:12] said you know Lord and again another
[2:54:18] brother that we all know and known
[2:54:20] around the world wrote and asked me said
[2:54:22] brother can you gonna give me some
[2:54:24] highlights on tilings and I and I went
[2:54:26] in tonight and I gave him a sort of a
[2:54:28] discourse on tithing in the in the email
[2:54:31] and he printed and he said I'm going to
[2:54:33] send this he said to every every clergy
[2:54:36] every minister that I know and I deal
[2:54:40] with in the message age thank you
[2:54:46] because it's being abused
[2:54:49] that's not walking with God that's
[2:54:54] walking with the devil that's right the
[2:55:00] prophet of God exhorted us on these
[2:55:04] things because I said now I so remember
[2:55:08] I said the man that I said that had the
[2:55:10] child that was dying then the pilot of
[2:55:11] God went in and pray for it and it got
[2:55:13] well and I said the man came and yet
[2:55:18] offered the prophet of God his tidings
[2:55:20] and the prophet of God turned it down
[2:55:21] and so now
[2:55:22] he said go he said pay it under on the
[2:55:24] hospital bill I said william branham
[2:55:31] said paid on the hospital bill not the
[2:55:35] profit that was the man but he said the
[2:55:40] doctor won't take it because the doctor
[2:55:42] said he didn't do anything to make him
[2:55:44] well it was a miracle and he came back
[2:55:50] and offered it again the poverty God
[2:55:52] said no sorries it just take it he said
[2:55:55] I put it toward this expense or that
[2:55:56] expense will in Brenham said that and I
[2:56:03] finally the third time he came back he
[2:56:06] said brother Branham the Lord told me to
[2:56:09] give you the tithing it needs to thank
[2:56:15] your brother I'll take it and I'll put
[2:56:18] it into the ministry and missions and
[2:56:24] God bless them see I said the Prophet
[2:56:30] said I'll take it
[2:56:32] William Brown said do this to that but
[2:56:37] the prophecy god help us to walk with
[2:56:43] God you got to walk with God in every
[2:56:46] choice you make every decision you make
[2:56:50] you and then you're walking to the
[2:56:55] revelation that Enoch walked into that's
[2:56:57] good you can preach on the bargain you
[2:57:02] do
[2:57:05] brother because the devil if his
[2:57:08] anything he's doing today and changing
[2:57:11] this whole world once today is a bargain
[2:57:15] everybody's looking for a bargain they
[2:57:17] want something for nothing that's the
[2:57:22] spirit of the world doing and I brought
[2:57:25] it out when I was talking on tidings
[2:57:28] that it is contrary to the scriptures
[2:57:32] for you to go out and get someone to do
[2:57:37] something for you and not pay them
[2:57:42] somebody that's kind and you know
[2:57:44] they'll they're there to help you and
[2:57:46] and they come in and volunteer even the
[2:57:49] Bible tells us that a volunteer that
[2:57:51] comes in and helps you to do some work
[2:57:53] that you're obligated to pay him the
[2:57:57] Bible forbids free labor I was shocked
[2:58:04] when I read it and you get people going
[2:58:08] around looking for free labor yes
[2:58:14] brother
[2:58:15] the neighbor is worthy of his hire
[2:58:24] thank God for the word Oh brothers no
[2:58:28] book like it no book liar in the world
[2:58:33] what it contains and I was surprised
[2:58:38] when I read that right there in the end
[2:58:40] in the Old Testament somehow it says
[2:58:44] you've got to give him something and an
[2:58:48] appreciation for what he did for you and
[2:58:51] yet people going around looking for get
[2:58:52] something free free free free free
[2:59:00] salvation wasn't free and as I said we
[2:59:08] couldn't afford to perk to purchase it
[2:59:11] so he did it but I said can you afford
[2:59:15] to possess it
[2:59:18] love you don't think that there's a
[2:59:21] price well Jesus said count the cost
[2:59:26] make sure you're able to finish what you
[2:59:29] started top the cost
[2:59:34] come on this let's this tape the
[2:59:37] exhortation tonight I've titled a
[2:59:39] message that we are denied enough in you
[2:59:43] that's good you know in you
[2:59:50] you know whatever yeah he couldn't tell
[2:59:52] you with him in the natural and you
[2:59:58] can't take it with you
[3:00:01] God is God help us to have Enochs
[3:00:06] attitude God Elvis to have a Enochs
[3:00:10] motives and objectives and you know what
[3:00:16] then got to take you on to the IRS and
[3:00:18] deeper depths of the revelation that we
[3:00:25] might they never that we might be turn
[3:00:27] up and become the missing once that's
[3:00:33] good they were looking for inna couldn't
[3:00:36] find him I trust I'll be looking for you
[3:00:41] and not find you as I said one of these
[3:00:45] days they're gonna show up and turn off
[3:00:47] in church and so on so is missing this
[3:00:49] one's missing just a few oh they're gone
[3:00:52] for a week in the week next weekend
[3:00:55] they're still not there there might be a
[3:00:59] scatter ministry short missing and maybe
[3:01:04] most will still be a little bit it's a
[3:01:08] challenge to our faith god help us
[3:01:14] let us not a bargaining table now you
[3:01:20] did say come let us reason together
[3:01:22] saith the Lord but we're not talking
[3:01:29] about bargains it's all right here
[3:01:34] forever settle to them you can't change
[3:01:37] it now come let us reason together saith
[3:01:40] the Lord though your sins be as scarlet
[3:01:42] they should be as white as snow red like
[3:01:47] crimson they shall be as wool a man
[3:01:51] that's the result of the reasoning and
[3:01:54] the bargaining with God that we see
[3:01:58] praise the Lord that's wonderful
[3:02:05] we got a reason with him the confines of
[3:02:08] the word that is forever settled in
[3:02:12] Hammond hey man god bless you brother
[3:02:17] Mike thank God for the revelation of
[3:02:22] Enoch and you you know and we pray grace
[3:02:30] that we're walking with God pray grace
[3:02:35] that were walking off the earth or
[3:02:41] walking from time to eternity amen
[3:02:44] god bless you let's stand
[3:02:49] unless sing higher ground number 75 in
[3:02:55] the melodies of praise and our brother
[3:02:57] would put it under screen I'm pressing
[3:03:02] on the upward way so was he not new H
[3:03:07] I'm gaining every day I trust you are
[3:03:10] spiritually getting more like him more
[3:03:17] in his image so you get to that place

[3:05:51] what hath God wrought that was the first
[3:05:57] wireless message received upon Signal
[3:06:01] Hill well we got some Wireless messages
[3:06:04] we didn't get a turn or denominations we
[3:06:08] got it by the Holy Ghost and to them is

[3:06:15] sense and all these doctrines and this
[3:06:17] theology got that thing what is it well
[3:06:19] there was a prophet here to interpret it
[3:06:21] well if God wrote rapturing fate and
[3:06:29] again I like what he brought in I said
[3:06:34] lord I come I never put the notes then
[3:06:36] in my Bible a bad bad and the Lord used
[3:06:40] our brother to bring it together for me
[3:06:43] I say thank you Jesus when he referenced
[3:06:50] Thessalonians the Lord should have said
[3:06:54] remember with the show the voice of the
[3:06:55] Archangel the Trump of God oh oh and
[3:07:04] that God brought big bud to my
[3:07:06] remembrance what another preacher

[3:07:13] going right back to first Corinthians

[3:08:02] shall all be changed and in a moment in
[3:08:06] the twinkling of an eye and that's what
[3:08:08] struck me right there when our brother
[3:08:11] quoted that's the Lord's the last
[3:08:12] trumpet the trumpet shall sound and he
[3:08:16] said in the twinkling of an eye at the
[3:08:19] last Trump hallelujah for the trumpet
[3:08:25] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[3:08:27] incorruptible and we shall be changed
