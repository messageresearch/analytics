we're singing the truth that he leadeth me by day and night amen by the grace of god we're living water's flow amen god's looking for the truth in our hearts because there's so many just sing they sing this song they sing that one but they don't believe it and really it's not reality in the end they're in their lives but i trust by the grace of god it's a reality in you amen by the grace of god let's again just make sure yes lord make sure i'm i'm singing the truth lord i want you to just you know me so let me know if i'm not then just bring conviction in my heart amen by the grace of god amen so the lord blesses and praying the grace of god be with us tonight as we go into the word and usually one preacher but it's going to be two tonight and uh uh it'll be me and it'll be brother branham amen so we're going to hear a tape by brother branham a message and that was streets many years ago and is entitled by faith moses amen so we're trying to bring that series of faith to a conclusion and i noticed online there's a certain message pressure and he's he's preaching a certain topic there and it goes on and on and on and on amen a lot a lot of sermons it's like one time someone said brother there's no way he said you you can you can match brother uh lee vale i said oh why is that oh he said you you just preached you know this sermon part one part two three four five something like that he said but level goes on and on and on and on and and i did notice that there was sermons by lee vale too where you go on to part 50. you know and so i said well i just finished the series i said home i said that was part 60. so i said does that entitle me to be compared with brotherly veil and so they were surprised that i would go that far but i do well and not only that i don't recall the name of it the the title i was using of that sermon but the sister kissed a coffee and god bless her and god rest her soul sister gabby was saying brother she's that was the best sermon i heard she said in in what she was in dealing with in our services so god bless her amen by the grace of god because i went on as i said to about i saw sure it was clear close to 60 part 60. this is the title part 16. amen so to god be the glory amen why because it's the word and you go on and on and on and on amen this is the word that's the word that's the word amen what are we hearing well it doesn't make a difference when it comes to the subject it's it's it's the word amen it has that again it's like our brother jonathan there going through all these scriptures good wonderful amen and then go go through the quotes by the grace of god wonderful amen it's the word brother and we're feeding on the word amen and again it's like preachers of years ago oh my you know they would go and preach and preach and preach and preach and but the people weren't looking at watches thank god that not many had to watch back then amen they weren't looking at this looking at that and they just go on and on and on and i remember one time that our our our brother john wesley he was ministering usually he he would go to a iron ore mines where they were they were doing work there and he would preach to those that come out and then he would preach to those that were going in to the mines over and over and over again another time that john wesley was preaching oh my they could they he was he was in the cemetery outside the church and why because the church wasn't big enough for the crowd that had gathered to hear john wesley and what was this what was this is the thing that he was using to pulp it oh it was it was a tombstone and he went and he found a tombstone there somewhere and he got up on the tombstone and they preached from that amen praise the name of the lord it's not not like today where preachers want this and they want this they prefer this and prefer that oh brother amen the most important thing is not the pulpit it's the word amen so i pray grace again for the word going forth over the pulpit amen and then the broader god said the word is god it's true the word god's judging you that's right god knows your faith god knows your thoughts god knows your feelings toward toward what you're hearing amen oh yes so let's be on our guard by the grace of god that we're here for the word by the grace of god why because we recognize our need for the word amen it's not not not doctrine of a church or the creed of a church and this and that no we need the word we need thus saith the lord because why because it's ordained by god to give us the faith that pleases god amen praise the lord because there's many that will preach but it's not giving them the faith that pray that pleases god no no is it they're just preaching their creed you know well belong to this church they're gonna pray they're gonna preach with this this title and that title and oh yeah it's gonna line up with with our creed and so on no sir you gotta line up with the word of god amen thus saith the lord it is written and i'll be honest there's a i've mentioned to a couple uh of the saints there's a there's a clergy and his wife that are on that are on the internet and i'll tell you brother you think oh they represent this church or that church but they don't they don't act like that and they don't talk like that they're not they're just bound by by the creed of the church they're representing no bound by the word amen and they they'll sing and sing and sing and and they'll keep coming to it to you with the word the word the word the the bible says the bible says the lord said the lord said not church it's the lord amen and i said well god bless them and because they're on the internet and online they're oh my the people from around the world are tuning in and they are being fed by that word amen so glad that that they're not bound by the church that they represent no no to them it's the word and they all and then and they got always got their bible there amen the bible is there on on on something there yes there's a pulpit there and they they got the bible maybe the bible's next to them on a chair but when they get them to the bullet they ring the word of god amen so i said lord i said bless them i said for what they're doing and they stand they're taking for the word and remember again brother we need this understanding we need this revelation don't judge them because oh they don't believe what i believe they don't believe what william branham taught and so on but understand that's for the bride that's for the bride but what about those outside the city amen and again the bri the prophet of god warned us he said now we want now that we won't get the message to everyone but to the right amen and all down through the ages god has chosen this and this and this amen and some of them are the bride some are not and we just leave that with the lord amen brother and god looks at the heart amen so i pray the grace of god that he looks at your heart and he's pleased amen with the attitude and the spirit the motives objectives of your heart amen is it is it already true amen evidence that you are born again amen and if you're born again you got you got a new nature amen controlling you and it's in the in the soul of the inside of the inside and the power of god did i light he said that's what's important he said let's make sure it's on the inside of the inside amen he said you can have it in your flesh he said 24 hours and he said go to hell amen but he said you've got to have it in your soul amen your experience with god is in your soul you're dealing with god god did him with you is in your soul amen by the grace of god not in your head it's in your soul it goes beyond the head beyond the human spirit into the soul amen to take control and if you're born again he drives the devil out because we're born born with that nature amen so praise the lord that we are new creatures born again amen now we've got the nature of god amen and the nature of god is in control praise the lord that's why it's not gonna it's gonna be 1500 miles this way that way that way and he said from the top to the bottom and it's like a pyramid that's the city that the bride lives in amen and uh there's that and i remember back some years ago when certain ones were preaching on the city the new jerusalem they sort of painted the new jerusalem and explained the new jerusalem as if it was a block it was 1500 miles at the base and it went up 1500 miles north east south and west amen like a block no and i i wasn't sure it might have been the prophet he said no oh yes he did brother rabbi explained it no he said it's not like that he said it it's like a pyramid amen it's going to be 1500 miles this way and that way and he's from the center to the top of the pyramid 1500 miles it's going to be a great place and it's going to be millions and millions there as the bride of christ amen so the grace of god be with us brother amen okay listen only believe all things are possible only believe well as i said you're going to hear two preachers amen maybe three so lord bless us this let's stand and sing only believe before we go into the the message on by faith moses amen only believe all things are possible only [Music] all things are possible only be jesus is here yes indeed amen yes amen all things are possible [Music] jesus jesus is here jesus amen hallelujah praise the lord all thanks hallelujah because jesus is here amen [Music] amen [Music] all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i all things are possible lord i believe the grace of your presence with us lord amen in the going full of your word in the hearing of your word praying that your anointing is there to bring it forth that your anointing is there lord to receive it amen you're there to give the revelation to be ministered you're there lord to give the revelation to receive it lord and understand and know what you are saying lord know what you are doing amen in the going forth of your word to give us the faith that pleases you and praying grace oh god in then in the going forth of the word it'll give us the faith father that you're looking for in these last days you're looking for the faith father for the change of our bodies looking for the faith amen of the resurrection faith for the rapture glory so we pray that grace and that anointing within our soul body and spirit amen to show that you are in control amen hallelujah o lord so that it is absolutely the truth that is not me that lives not my brothers and sisters but it's jesus living in us oh this is amazing lord hallelujah we'll give god the glory lord for jesus to reign more and more and more in our lives the jesus should take more and more control lord of our living hallelujah truly lord again it's jesus living in us amen jesus hallelujah the word made flesh in us the word may flesh in these last days hallelujah and the reality of the promise lord for the for the resurrection the reality of the promise for the rapture is becoming flesh amen is becoming a greater and a greater and a greater reality praise the lord amen that we are experiencing the resurrection we're experiencing the rapture we're experiencing lord being cut away to meet the lord of the air may you have the glory honor and the praise hallelujah may you have the preeminence in our lives lord in our thoughts in our words and our dates give the glory to jesus amen we'll give you the preeminence amen to reflect to the world our lord jesus christ you're not dead you're alive forevermore amen you're living in yeah hallelujah you're living in your brother your sons and daughters by the grace of god trust god oh lord that you are living in me trust in grace say you are living in my brothers and sisters under the hearing of the word tonight for your glory amen will give the glory to jesus tell of his love unto the resurrection his love unto the rapture the change of our bodies hallelujah thank you jesus grace as we commit all into your care amen each brother and each sister so body and spirit that you have control in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen the lord bless you our musicians can go and uh turn with me to deuteronomy chapter 32. deuteronomy chapter 32 amen and it again is the first reference to faith in the bible deuteronomy 32 god was looking for faith but didn't find it amen not in to this generation there and let's begin to read at verse let's see 15. and uh oh to say that uh i want to correct something that i that i mentioned uh during the last service on sunday i believe it was and uh i made a reference to i i'm not sure enough from the claude gayle i meant but i used brother duff i used brother doug's doug's name claude's brother amen and i talked about the the the the brother dying amen and i believe he went to be with the lord for the claude gail but i i said doug doug is not gone yet so brother dog is still in cormac so so that god bless our brother doug if we get get to go out there i'm sure that we'd be able to go and stay with them amen so god bless brother doug and sister beverly amen and we pray the grace of god to brother claude's wife sister edna that sister edna is a woman in her 80s and she is in the seniors home uh in in deer lake so we pray god's grace be with her and sister beverly does uh take the time to go visit her and so on so we pray got grace to sister edna amen how long the lord will keep her i i'm not sure and also to thank everybody for their prayers for brother tom snow amen it's amazing that he went into the hospital and then the doctor said three hours or maybe friday he said but but he was going to go amen and that's that's about three weeks ago and he's and now he's home amen and they put him in the ambulance just two or three days ago and and they drove him back to his home amen so we pray the grace of god be with brother tom amen in graham falls amen no bishop false and he's not far of course our brother tom is not far from where uh brother ron his brother lives and sister shirley and also of course brother hank snow and sister verna amen so they're they're very they're they're close to together so we pray god bless the saints in in central newfoundland and in bishop falls and so on amen we thank god for their support and they are supporting the assembly here amen so keep them in prayer and uh also to we want to thank our brother jonathan for the ministry of the word amen and uh again we'll we'll give him the liberty to take as long as he wants the just being an hour no no we just we stay and stay and stay amen if anybody's to leave it's not the congregation it's the pulpit it's the it's the brother and the pulpit amen and also uh the lord willing we'll have here to hear hear the word amen and what we've been ministering on is faith so we just keep on moving until the lord wants to change it amen but is anything god's looking for now it is faith yeah yeah the faith that pleases god and without faith it's impossible to please him amen because no matter how simple it was it had to be a faith in the heart amen by grace but we're now we're moving on to the resurrection and the rapture so and brother that's the faith that god's looking for in us what are you believing for what are you taking your standing for what are you what are you praying for amen what are you hungry and thirsting for amen if you're hungry and thirsty amen we're not back in wesley's day or or or the other ages back there the pentecostal age no we're in the bright age by the grace of god so god help us and brother is like the power of god said he said when the holy spirit the pillar of fire came into the room in in uh branham tabernacle when the prophet of god was preaching this series right here and he was coming near the end of it and he said the pillar fire came in and he saw he he was people was looking at the reflection of the light but brother brown was looking at the bill of fire amen and he came in and he went over and uh on that side and oh and he what did he do he drew this this is what he put on the wall amen above the windows they look you know this is this they saw the seven church ages but and the problem god said he said you remember it he said you'll notice this one he said there was no light there he said it was all black it was all dark and he said i put that there to represent the bright age amen the calling of the bride by the grace of god because again the bible says when the son of man comes will he find faith amen that's how serious it is so i pray the grace of god that we have faith we believe we believe jesus did do what he did and he came back and he was resurrected amen and jesus has come back again now to unite with his bride amen did it brother brown refer to it as the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen brother i trust that he's in control and you feel bound to him as your mate amen in deuteronomy chapter 32 amen and verse 15 but jesus waxed fat and kicked thou art waxing fat thou art grown thick and thou art covered with fatness and then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation lightly esteemed it and they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations provoked they him to anger and they sacrificed unto devils not to god this is amazing but the life you're living sometimes either not not us by the grace of god but i know that it out outside there somewhere there they're the make believers amen they're sacrificed unto devils not to god amen and he said to gods whom they knew not and in new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not of the rock that beget thee thou art unmindful and has forgotten god that formed thee amen and when the lord saw it he aborted them because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are in fair a very forward generation children in whom is no faith god have mercy amen and they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people amen i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation amen the fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains god bless his word amen you may be seated turn with me to the book of hebrews chapter 4. hebrews chapter 4 and reading first couple of verses let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it amen for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith amen brother god's looking for faith not the word in your head he's looking for the revelation in your heart amen so we're praying the grace of god that we be we're here because we have something in our hearts controlling us amen not because we think all the the that message is good and i believe that's the right one this is right you can have all that in your head but where is it in your heart amen and are we going forth and out of the heart reflecting the word the word made flesh in you the word may flesh in me amen shall i pray the grace of god that we're going we will be we we will be a witness to the world of the world of the word made flesh amen as the prophet of god said and he said that this one will go up and they say i didn't i didn't see jesus i didn't know jesus you know was he in my day was he living in me in that hour and the brother ranu said oh yeah and god is going to open the heaven there and he said he's going to flash it on the screen it'll be your witness and your testimony it might be a friend it might be a neighbor we don't know but god was was a witness to the world through you amen through the life that you lived through the attitude that you had the actions and the reactions your brother brown said you'll show it on the screen right there amen and say well this was your neighbor amen see what he was reflecting see what he was doing amen he was reflecting god reflecting jesus amen yeah and then what that's why the prophet of god said he said god's going to judge them by you you better be on your guard amen you better walk in the spirit live in the spirit amen let the spirit control you amen because god's going to reflect it and show you the witness of god the witness of his word amen by the grace of god amen again verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them i trust that it's profiting you oh yeah grace why because it wasn't mixed with faith amen what believe in it not in your head believe it in your heart amen you're responding out of your heart to the word amen hallelujah oh there's something on the inside of the inside saying amen that's the word of god thank you jesus amen but again it might be in their heads and that's not salvation salvation is when the word is in control in your soul amen and you're a new creature you're born again and if you're born again you've got the nature and new nature of being born again amen it's the nature that controls you by the grace of god amen so what nature is in control of you is it your natural mother and father or is it jesus amen verse of moses the nature of jesus controlling the old nature well he's here he's here to control it amen you're going to go forth and not just reflect oh you know your natural mother and father you're going to reflect jesus that's in control oh yeah he's there to control the old nature amen in some instances to change the old nature some instances amen to rip out that old nature so that he takes control amen grace to his brother brother because why what we believe has to be mixed with faith so he said for we which have believed to enter into rest praise the lord as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest a seventh day from all his works amen and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest amen seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached amen entered not in because of unbelief amen they never had the faith that please god praise the lord i usually recommend saturday keepers read hebrews 4. amen i said you want to know who you who the true sabbath is what it is i read hebrews 4. amen i said our true sabbath is jesus and as i said then i i i mentioned it to a saturday keeper and when i met him and he was he's much older and i would say he's in his 80s for sure and uh he always said you're you're a pastor now because he told me when i was in in the i remember in the in the school and in the in the room there where the grade 11 was being taught and he said oh mr lush he said you know you're going to be a pastor do you i said i don't know i'll leave that with the lord. and he felt oh yes you'll be a pastor and that's what he felt in in his experience with me and so i met him many years later many many years later amen and he recognized me he come over to introduce himself to me and and i told him about the church always you you got you you're pastoring yes i said you told me yes he said and he said oh he said what day do you worship on do you worship on saturday or sunday i said no i said we worship on sunday but i said when it comes to the day you you i said it's in honor of the resurrection but i said any day will do i said you cease from your dead works of sin i said not one day a week i said you cease from your dead works of sin seven days a week and i said you enter into god's sabbath jesus amen and i'll tell you his eyes popped he was shocked he said i never heard that before i said well i said just want you to think about it consider it okay thank you oh yeah so we pray the grace of god brother you should have this revelation that jesus is god's sabbath amen not saturday not sunday amen but i should cease from your dead works of sin seven days a week and enter into the sabbath of god jesus and it's he couldn't he said i've never heard it before so i said well go to your bible hebrews chapter 4 i should read it amen praise the lord let's go to see first john chapter 5 amen and verse 1 whosoever believer that jesus is the christ is born of god amen and everyone that loveth him that begat love of them also that is begotten of him amen by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god amen you love god if you love god you love you love the brothers and sisters of the faith oh yeah no way you can do away with it it's there it's just all of them it's the in control amen for this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen praise the lord we got we don't have to worry about it we got the faith so the holy ghost is there to meet any challenge amen he's there to give you the victory amen he's there to manifest the victory go on my son don't worry about it one sister's daughter go on oh yes thank you lord amen so glad that i experienced that and and it didn't influence me i think that god in me influenced it amen thank the lord what is this tremendous let me read it again for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith to the glory of god amen amen god bless the reading of his word we'll leave it there and we'll go directly to the prophet of god and let him minister amen as i said his two two preachers so we'll hear the first one and pray the grace of god not not to anoint the second one amen god bless us brother matthew amen the 11th chapter of the book of hebrews wednesday night we were speaking on the seventh chapter of the book of hebrews of mel cassidy being without father without mother without beginning of days are ending of life and i thought maybe this morning it would be appropriate to open again this wonderful book being that we have the backgrounds to what we wish to say in the former readings and skipping over the 10th chapter in the ninth chapter which is the sacrificial laws we would come into a spot of faith and here in the book of hebrews 11th chapter and beginning with the 23rd verse we read it like this by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses when he came to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt and had recompensed unto the reward by faith he foresuck egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisibling i want to take the subject this morning choosing by faith and i want to take for a text the first three words are the 23rd uh chapter by faith moses and choosing by faith most everything that we do we have to choose by faith and all that we find that moses did that's worth repeating was by faith not by sight but by faith and the reason that i have selected this this morning for the church in this state has been that in our even our schools and around we have had so much of scientific teaching because of this we have drawn the people away from faith now faith is not proved by science faith is what science doesn't see and we if we ever lose this great faith then we are totally in darkness it no matter how well we are educated how we could explain the word of god to suit our own way of believing there is no way to ever please god only by faith the scripture plainly states it that way and it's by faith and without faith says the scripture it is impossible to please god so if faith disagrees with science and science disagrees with faith that puts them at age and each other then we must take a choice as moses did by faith we believe now if we lose faith then we will never get a prayer answered by god for he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him so if we lose faith our prayers are in all we get nowhere so it's all that we can think of this morning is to hold on to faith then if we lose faith all our hopes is gone and if we lose faith all our spiritual reality is gone for you cannot have faith in things that you see for the things that you see are all perishable if we look at some great person a great minister our great congregation they will all perish someday and if we look at a great nation our great weapon they'll all perish someday and then we must live by faith of those things that science does not declare it's by faith that we believe now we lose our glory if we lose faith now if we get away from faith then we take the church into an intellectual realm and many times it's been thought amongst people that because a congregation was large and they had great uh churches great steeples and a great lot of well dressed and groomed peoples and a lot of uh finances that they could afford such things we many times thought that was inspiring that this certain church must be inspired or we've often referred to different ministers who get out on the field and have great gatherings of crowds and we think sometimes that they are the signs of inspiration but that's not altogether the truth that's human inspiration but the real inspiration comes by doing the will of god see whether it is a one or just a handful whether it is a big church or a small church it matters not whether he is a great eloquent speaker or just a man that hardly knows his abc's it doesn't matter it depends on the message that he's bringing whether it is inspired by the word of god or is it inspired by intellectual conceptions of human inspiration some people can be inspired because of an eloquent speaker that doesn't make it right sometimes they're inspired because the man is so trained he could put his point over it that doesn't mean that it's of god see it's only through god's everlasting eternal blessed word can we receive inspiration and that's given by the holy ghost by faith we receive it now we would think of moses and this great time of his life and we read back of his birth and how that god had cured foreign but there cometh time in moses life to where there had to be a choosing time amen if we read right we find out that he was the son of pharaoh's daughter and it was the heir to the throne and would have been the next pharaoh in egypt so he would notice as he looked around after he'd become of age and other accountability and there would be those slaves working out in the slime pits and moses as he looked through the windows of the palace upon the same slaves that pharaoh looked down but what a difference there was in the looking i want to base that thought this morning for a few minutes and may the god of heaven drive it home to every heart here it's how you look at anything what makes the difference the great evangelist john sproul which was a convert of brother bosworth's ministry who many of you remember years ago of the old glory barn he said one day he was taking a trip before the deceasing of his beloved companion and wife they were in la salle reigns france and i had the privilege of visiting the same place and the god was taking them out through the gardens and showing them the different things and they come upon a certain statue of the lord jesus the crucifixion and mr sproul was standing off looking at it he and his wife and in their hearts were criticizing what the artist must have had in mind or the sculpture rather when he hewed out of a stone such a horrible looking thing to be to represent the suffering and the love and the pity of the lord jesus and how it was all cruelly and chopped up looking and the god came to mr sprole and he said sir i suppose that you are criticizing this statue of the lord jesus and he said i am and he said i am not a bit surprised because most people that look at it first they do criticize it and mr strong said well i can't see any pity or any inspiration from looking at such a thing so i'm wondering why the sculpture every made it like this and the sculpture said mr spell this statue's all right [Music] and the sculpture had the right thing in his mind but where the trouble is is with you it's the way you're looking at it and he took he and his wife by the hand and led them down to a altar at the foot of the said cross and he said now mr sproul look up now and when he looked up he said his heart liked to have failed him what a difference it was to stand off there and look at it that way and to get down and look at it the way that it was made to look at amen and that's the way that god is that's the way that faith is it's the way you look at it if you look at it as some sort of a historical bible of something that was in the days gone by you will never be able to get the real value of the bible you are supposed to get on your knees and obey the commandments of this bible and look at it through the eyes of the holy spirit i would ask this audience this morning what good does a historical god do us today if he isn't the same god what good does a god that would take moses and do the miracles with him that he did what good would it do us to read of such a god if he isn't the same one today what good is a god that could deliver from the fiery furnace the hebrew children if he isn't the same god today amen what god is the god that would judge between right and wrong in a day gone by and praise the wrong and bless the right if he isn't the same god today what do we go to church for why do we abstain from things of the world if he isn't the same god of the same judgment and the same opinion that he always was what good would it be for a god who could touch a woman's hand with a raging fever and the fever stop if he is of the same god today what good would it be to serve a god who could call his friend from a grave after being dead for days if he isn't the same god today by faith we believe that some glorious day he shall call us from the earth though we be a spoonful of ashes again hallelujah how do we prove it we do not prove it we believe it we are not asked to prove anything we're asked to believe it amen by faith moses did such and such as moses as a young man looked through the palace winter at the slaves he saw the same bunch of gravy dirty muck-ridden slaves that pharaoh saw and when pharaoh looked upon him and the egyptians they wasn't nothing but a bunch of slaves that's all they were good for just to be human mud daubers to make muddy bricks for the benefit of the cities that pharaoh was building that's the way mo the egyptians and pharaoh looked at the slaves but moses when he looked at him it was a different look moses had when he was seen passing by the window the great ditches in their face the tears that run down their cheeks and their bit bodies he looked upon them as the people of god amen he didn't look upon him as slaves he looked upon him as the chosen people of god amen oh as i go about from country to country and from nation to nation preaching since i left the doors of this little tabernacle that's an interdenominational institution with no law but love no book but the bible no creed but christ i've tried to look up on god's children and upon the rejected as being god's chosen and elected people i don't ask them if they belong to the venom tabernacle i don't ask them if they're methodists or if they're presbyterians or if they are pentecostals our nazarenes are pilgrim holiness i just want to look upon them as a people of god i'm seeing their doings and their actions that they are the servants of the lord god and my heart desires fellowship with them no matter what brand they got i just long for their fellowship i love them because i know they are people of god when i see a woman coming down the street with the long skirting her hair done up neatly in the back and and a decent looking dress on and i see another young lady maybe the same age with a little pair of shorts on she may be in looks twice as pretty as the woman with the long hair according to the looking of the world but i take my side with that girl that's dressed like a christian though they'd be laughing at her and calling her a fanatic yet i take my side she might not be as pretty as the other girl featurely but she sees something by faith she sees him who is invisible who is guiding her life when i see the man on the job being called deacon our teacher are a fanatic because he refuses to smoke and to drink beer and to go to dances like the rest of them and he's called a fanatic my heart goes out for him he is my brother am i down in this egypt soils that makes our heart long to embrace him and say brother we are pilgrims and strangers of this land and i long to fellowship with you moses had to make a choice choosing by faith how many young men would have jumped at the opportunity to become the son of pharaoh's daughter how many young men would have jumped at the opportunity that moses had to enjoy all the pleasures and the glamour of the world to become the king of egypt to have the whole world at his feet what a foolish thing that the young man of his days must have thought when moses chose to take his place with the afflicted and suffering people of god amen why did he do it by faith when he lifted up his eyes he looked beyond the grammar of this world he looked beyond the pleasures of sin and the bible said that he endured as seeing him who was invisible by faith and he made a choice to serve that god regardless of what took place it has not changed many of us could go to what we would call a better building we could enjoy maybe the fellowship and pleasures of setting in a better pew we might be more popular to drink and to smoke and to dress and to act like the world well what's the matter you've lifted up your eyes and by faith you see him who is invisible and took your stand with the rejected and so-called holy rulers of the day for by faith we see him who is invisible choosing to suffer the persecutions and the afflictions i wouldn't say to people that they should choose to be afflicted i don't say that you should choose suffering it would not be the human thing to do but if suffering lays in the path of duty then let's take it as it comes [Applause] i don't want you to do something for somebody to make fun of you i wouldn't want you to say uh uh different things that i'm uh i belong to a church that doesn't believe in so and so in the worlds and things like that just to get people to make fun of you you're bringing that on yourself i wouldn't say for you to get out here and carry on and do something that was radical i wouldn't want you to do that so that somebody would say that you are a fanatic you bring that on yourself but if it lays in the path of your duty towards god let the world say what they want to say [Applause] you make a choice every man and woman has to make this what if pharaoh could have saw what moses saw he saw the sufferings of the people he knew what the price was to pay but by faith he chose it rather than to have the pleasures of sin it's maybe a little young lady sitting here that's glamorous young women the world would like to say to you do dust and dust you are beautiful your body is so pretty shape you should show that but my sister raise up your eyes and look beyond that to him that said it's an abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man if the man of the people in your community if the women that you associate with said cut that long hair off it would be cooler it would be this that or the other or it would become you better don't you listen to that you lift up your eyes and my face saw him that said the woman's hair is her glory and she shall not cut it if they say it would be popular you would stand in better with your job or with your boss if you take a sociable drink if you would smoke cigarettes like the rest of the women you were standing more sociably in your neighborhood by faith raise your eyes and look to him who said this foul this body and i will destroy it by faith we believe those things it's nothing that you see it's something you believe by faith moses did and in this faith walk there comes a time there has to be a choice lot made that sad mistake that we make a lot of times we choose for our own good we choose things that would be a better sometimes if a little squabble comes in the church and someone would say well the deacon are the pastors on this side don't look at that look at what's righteous get that thing out and bring it both together that's godly there's a choosing and we choose for ourselves we choose something that's for our own good but moses chose the affections and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of god think of it now listen to it chose the afflictions of the people of god and counted it a greater treasure for he endured seeing him who was invisibly now lot one time had to make a choice and it may be this morning that there will be men and women sitting here that'll make your final choice you are today worry gone in the rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith lot as he had to make a choice abraham give lot his choice and god gives you your choice choose you this day who you shall serve amen in the garden of eden there was a tree of of knowledge and a tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you're giving your privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose my advice to you is don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be but choose rather than the glamour that you could be but choose rather by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and will write in all wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up no matter if you take the despised way with the lord's few make that choice if there is troubles in the hand if there are troubles in the land if there's troubles in the church if there's troubles in the home no matter where it is make your choice by faith i'll serve god i'll humble my heart and his presence i'll take the way with god's children i see them despised and rejected and drove out and made fun of it i'll still take my post of duty amen i'll stay right by and when they cry i'll cry with them and when they're sorrow i shall sorrow with them the way they live i'll live like me almost said aru said to me alma your ways be my ways my ways be your ways where you live i live where you go i'll go the god that you serve will be my god take that choice though it pulls the very skin off of your conscience of thinking that you're somebody skin yourself down and take your away with the lord's despised you and stay live on the field of service and at the post of duty lot looked around he said i got a choice and he looked towards sodom he saw the good grassy fields were better than what abraham saw and where abraham was he saw the opportunities to graze his cattle i have fatter and better cattle i hope i'm not hurting anyone's feeling but that's been the stand of too many preachers to compromise with the gospel thinking if they get more money out of it a meal ticket i'd rather live in the barren land drink from a bridge and eat soda crackers than a compromise upon the conviction of my faith in the word of the living god i'll take my way some of them said billy what's the matter with your meetings as there's too many pentecostals ahead a great denominational minister said that i said will your denomination sponsor my meeting not long ago in the look magazine i believe there was an article and the writer said there's talked about the pentecostal people he said the pentecostal church is the fastest growing church in the world today why it's because men and women has raised up their eyes they look far off and the writer also complimented the pentecostal people oh of course he said there were some of them that went radically and so forth but the methodist worship a creed they worship god by a creed the baptist does the same in the presbyterians but the pentecostal worships by his bible by faith we see the promise i'll take my lot with them no matter how much they're despised i'm still around them [Applause] though they be made fun of and have their ups and downs as israel did i'll never want to stand with the false prophet on the hill side of balaam and try to curse what god has blessed because in that camp is a smitten rock have a bloody sacrifice and a pillar of fire no matter what they're in it's leading them home to victory and they've got to come to it because they are the promised people that's walking by faith though they be not a denomination they were wonders around and so is the people of god but i want to take my way with them join up with them in their ranks not in their denomination but in their fellowship around the articles of god's eternal spirit which by faith i have received the baptism of the holy ghost god help me to always have that attitude notice as they moved on we find that launch saw the opportunities for a fatted cattle many see the opportunities of a fatted pocketbook man he sees the opportunities of a better social standing he saw the possibilities of a few extra dollars he saw the possibilities of being the mayor of the city being a stranger and a pretty smart man as he was maybe i will become the chief man of the city he saw the possibilities because they were laying before him but he did not see the fire that was to destroy the land he did not reconcile himself that the land was full of sin and god had to destroy it and today people try to reconcile himself and say are you i say are you a christian they say i'm an american that has no more to do with it and try to say to a crow that he was a frog it has nothing to do with it she's going to be destroyed because god is just amen and if america gets by with her sins the just and sovereign holy god will be duty boundary to resurrect sodom and gomorrah and apologize to them for bringing him up because of their sin he lets us get by with him if he lets you get to heaven on your injustice works you'll have to raise up ananias and survive and give them another opportunity he certainly would but he's just and i saw his money peter saw christ oh my lot didn't see the destruction of these children in that place many of you they holding around these old formal creeds and things you don't see the juvenile delinquency and the destruction of your children you don't see your daughter in a prostitute house you don't see your son a drunkard or at a card table somewhere because she's well watered in sin is not touched he didn't see his wife the head of all the societies turned to a pillar of salt when he was looking he didn't see him escaping only by the edge of his teeth to a little city somewhere for his life he didn't see that because he only looked at what he saw in front of him but abraham didn't notice the well-watered lamb for he lifted up his eyes and saw the tomorrow for he had inherit all things the real christian today lifts up his eyes and sees the promise of christ blessed are the meek for they shall inherit all things they shall be heard here we are the real christian by faith looks up and sees that him what you want to he lifted up his eyes and when he did that god said abraham walk through the land she's all yours amen amen by faith abraham did this the same faith that moses had it was wrote by one commentator that said this i thought it was most beautiful words but abraham moses took the best of the world and put it in one scale and the worst out religion and put it in the other scale and the worst of religion outweigh the best of the world so is it today that if we be called anything we want to be called fanatics or divine healers or holy roma or whatever they want to call the worst that we are will outweigh the best the world can afford you want to be called old-fashioned old fogey fanatic it'll outweigh the best thing that the devil's got to offer you amen it most surely will moses esteem the reproach of christ he foresaw christ later he spoke some mighty inspiring words about him see the lord your god shall rise up a prophet like unto me he knew he's foresaw him and he esteemed his reproach greater riches than all the glamour of the world christian friend today can't you do that but all the glamour and popularity of the world by faith we see him who promised and the worst of the church today in all of its condition yet it'll outweigh everything the devil can offer you if we are tore up if we are broke to pieces if we are confused and broke up into nominations and fanaticism it'll outweigh anything the devil can offer certainly he has seen the reproach of christ greater riches than all the treasures of egypt then he had to do something he forsook egypt oh i love that word he forsunk egypt see he was looking through the same window but he was looking different from favor what a pharaoh could have seen he's in what if pharaoh would have seen his nation drowning moses saw it how by science by faith moses saw it everything that he did was by faith because god promised abraham his father that he would he would visit this nation after 400 years and would bring him out and by faith moses believe the word that god said and note himself as by faith to be the chosen leader to bring them he knew where he was he took his place in the slime pits as a mud dauber and counted the reproach of christ greater riches than to settle the throne of egypt he never just said i sympathize with him he took their place and went with them amen he took their place we went with them no one of the inspired writers said i'll take the way with the lord's despised you i started with jesus now i'm going through i'm on my way to canaan's land sure moses it was said by one that moses had rather when he could have been the son of payroll and had the clamor of the world he'd rather be a son of abraham than to be the son of pharaoh amen a son of abraham to despise that it be son of pharaoh the king i'd rather be the son of the lord jesus and his fellow servants and take my place with the rejected people of this world and to be president of this great united states of america or to be an elvis presley or pat boone or whoever you want to make it i'll take my way young ladies are to take their way and stand to be in a a mary pitford or some great movie star some glamour girl take your way with the lord's despised you i'd rather be a preacher in the pulpit preaching the unsearchable riches of christ than to be a hollywood movie star or the greatest person on the earth if i had to eat meager bed or whatever i had to do i'll take my way with the lord's people by faith i do that i've been offered opportunities but by god's grace i still see by faith by faith i can see it afar and our father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there praise god an income tax man said today why did you turn your home to that church what made you give a 25 000 home to that little old rubbish looking tabernacle i said it wasn't the church that i did it's the people that's there i have not known this world's goods every penny of money i ever touched turned to this church wow my faith is on god and now the things of this world my affections are above and i believe your alls are the same if you're right with god it's true that you are am i we by faith receive we by faith believe god amen moses he had to make a choice and then he had to after making a choice he had to fight the faith in for he feared not the wrath of the king i humanly he had a right to fear the wrath he had a right to fear the wrath of the king but he didn't he did not do it because he had a job to do and he was in a line of duty and he didn't care what the king said about it he tucked his way just the same now pharaoh of course when he sees he's defeated he wanted to give uh moses and the children he said all right i'll tell you what i'll do you ought to stay in the land and go out and sacrifice to your god that's the way the devil works oh you can be religious once you go over and join some church you don't have to do all these things a man says to his wife the wife says husband i got saved no more manicure or lips drinking stuff no more this no more parties no more of these society things i'm out of it i'll put my time to reading the word taking care of home now look dear you you can be a religious all right now look you you go over here you've got the wrong church no we didn't you're in the right one if you got a preacher preach that to you or stay with him search back to the scriptures and find if that's right i always say go over here they don't they don't have to do that over here they don't do this over here that's wait just go so far but he don't want you to get out of the land that's the way the devil does he don't want you to get out of the things of the world just bring the world in with the church the other day coming down the road i turned on my radio and there was a song and i kept listening i had to take the other song through before i could tell whether it was absolutely a religious song or the devil is trying to bring down the things of god to the level of the world you can't do that god be merciful i don't care how many albums elvis presley writes of all the good religious songs he's still possessed of the devil he sent more children to hell and all the moves i know of in all the world in this day pat boone and the rest of me belong to church of christ elvis presley pentecostals are judases carrot in the form of those man the devil's trying to bring the high things of god so that they can mix them down here that people won't look up above this they just look and say what's all the same it isn't the same get out of the land said you can just go a few days and you go stay in the land sure you know they'd be back then he found out that wouldn't work so he thought something different he said i'll tell you what you do you've gone out anywhere you want to go but you leave all your wives all your children and all your cattle back here you leave them here and you go out because he know they had possession back there that would lure them back and that's what the devil says to you [Music] just as long as you leave some of the things of the world hanging on you still want to smoke you want to drink you want to dress like the world that's as good as it ever was i hear so much about backsliding i don't bleed as much backside as people think they are they just leave too many possessions in egypt to lure them back am i that's all backslides are not what they say it is you do have too much the world back there that lures you brother i'll tell you when israel got ready at midnight they had everything they had in this world packed up and ready to go god sent us revival like that we pack up everything and get ready to go the midnight christ coming going out to meet him you better have everything you better not packed enough in this world luring you back any strings to hold you down pack up let's get ready we're going and you know what i tell you they were so true to god until pharaoh got so excited at midnight he said get out get out and get going take everything you got and go i'm so glad that a man can live so close to god tell the devil don't know what to do with him that's right get out get going obey god by faith he's followed the promise but governor and oh my daughter he taken his way with the lord's despised you pharaoh said take all you've gotten get out of here i don't know what to do with you you're so true to god by faith faith the word miracles equals state true to god by faith we see him our time is up past time but by faith this morning lift up your eyes don't see what's around you this modern world but look and see him who give the promise the bible said we don't see all things perfectly now but we do see jesus you look at him this morning and your ways will be changed while we bow our heads just a moment for a word of prayer may the lord add his blessings to the message think in your heart now have you been looking on the things of the world by faith do you see jesus are you looking at your popularity your church what your social standing is with the world or do you see jesus who and pity place yourself at the right hand of the majesty on him who suffered as a martyr the just for the unjust can't you raise up your eyes and see that tree of life honor then leave this tree of science and knowledge and serve him would you like to be remembered in prayer before i pray raise your hands for any request that you might have needed god bless you he sees all your hands if you're sinner raise up your eyes and look now if you've been indifferent if you've had little squabbles and little things what difference does it make you're going to die one of these days what day maybe today you don't know an hour from now you may be in hell or you may be in heaven but you've got to choose now if there's anything in your life that isn't right you choose now by faith you say well if i can just get eaten with her if i can eat with him no matter what they've done choose life choose life for jesus said if from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one ought in your heart against any person sitter our saint you're in danger of hell fire now lift up your eyes what do you see your enemy or do you see your savior what are you looking at this morning if you're sick and your doctor says that you can't get well lift up your eyes to the cross where he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed don't look at what the doctor says he's working in science faith works in the realm of spirit and god let us think of these things now while you've raised your hands god see now let us pray amen praise the lord amen 1958 what if we what if he preached that in 96 well just before the lord took him 1965. brother it'd be even longer stronger that's right brother and god required it again even of him back there what does god require of us to stand he took that stand what stance should we take now i tell you brother sister that there's a lot more going on there now than was back in 1958 oh yes and yet he saw so much that he just took his stand by faith moses just thinking that god took took that subject by faith moses and he expanded on it expanded got it bigger and bigger and bigger he brought out this about moses amen but then he applied it to that hour that he was living we can apply to the hour that we're living oh by faith moses did this by faith moses did that brother and the faith that moses had god requires of us to stand that moses took god requires it of us in these last days again and of course we're living in a different hour different age and and brother what moses endured is one thing what you and i would have to endure as another oh yeah so as he went on and on and on brother and by faith what what do you mean well he had that faith and did this well he just went as the lord led him as the lord revealed this to him lord reveal that to him he just went on and did it amen he didn't he didn't he didn't mind this he didn't mind that whatever the will of god was but now lot was different totally different because lot was looking for oh looking for oh a good life natural life he want he wanted riches he wanted god to do this god do that god bless me here god bless me there and that's why when uh oh that when god god remember god would not deal with moses until lot was taken away and a lot was taken out of his presence then god came down oh yeah then god came down and and spoke to moses he said moses come up here and i want to show you look i'm going to give you all this land and so on that was after a and and moses separated so brother i pray grace in the name of jesus that we're not going to not going to rob ourselves of the blessings of god enter the blessings of god why because we're going to get too involved with this too involved with that to involve with family or or friends you know oh yeah but you got to take your stand because it's like when back years ago as as i was in in the word in the message and you know feasting on the lord feasting on the word and feasting on the message we when we travel we went to see this brother this sister this one believer and that believer and so on and and we have fellowship and and in particular let me mention that brother and sister burns and so on oh my the times that we would go and visit brothers in the barn visit brother sister burns but yet [Music] there was a natural part of my family that was jealous of it and rebuked me that oh yeah when you come by you just drop in for to see us and so on but then you go on down to mr mrs barnes you're spending all your time with them and so on and and they were saying oh but where your where your family naturally exactly they were but not spiritually even though they were christian and professing christian and go to a certain denominational church and i i didn't blast anything like that among them we just we if we had fellowship we go in and fellowship with with them or maybe have a meal with them but then we get up and we go on to brother and sister barnes why because our relationship was it was eternal our relationship with them was spiritual whereas our relationship with the other members of the family was just natural just natural and we were witnesses yes they knew our stand and so on and so but still we stayed with brother and sister burns oh yeah and i remember one time that we went out and visited them and we took a our pet it was a cat with us oh yeah and and we we decided to stay i might have been staying at night with with that family natural family and so on but the pet we had the cat wasn't at peace it wasn't at rest oh i it was just going around and just couldn't couldn't couldn't find any peace or any rest anything at all in that in that place so but the next day we did when we got up and after everything was done and greeted them and so we moved on to our brother and sister burns oh yeah and we went in yeah and we were in no time we we also had our at our pet there and our cat and all of a sudden the cat was missing i said where is he we all went looking for her and she was on the chesterfield sleep she found rest and peace there just think even an animal knew the difference even an animal sensed it oh yeah because in another place nor couldn't could for some time for something that she could the the pet couldn't couldn't rest oh yeah but when we got to brother sister burns oh my the atmosphere was different by the grace of god amen so brother oh yes i'm sure that we could that the brother brennan would say hey man brother i agree with that you know amen so you know brother if and if if an animal would discern it and recognize it how much our way to recognize amen that presence by the grace of almighty god amen and i still we still have company with our families natural families and they enjoy it they're glad and so on and as i said if we were to go in and they oh they were glad to see us coming and if they had their television on they turn it off yeah when we come in and they just leave it off as long as we're there or they weren't offended but they weren't offended by that they were just glad to have our have some time with us amen and we were there just just to be a witness by the grace of god and not necessarily with the message or doctrines of this no by the life you live by the spirit and attitude that you express and that you have oh yes they'll recognize that oh yeah your natural family they'll know that your spirit is different your attitude is different your motives and objective is different but at the same time they know that you respect them for who they are naturally and so on so i pray the grace of god help us brother don't let those things amen interfere with your relationship with with the word listen what do we believe in and why are we believing it why what has god done and why has god done it you know in these last days what's the purpose of god brother i trust by the grace of god to a lot of people we just believe god said a prophet god said a prophet well that's not going to get you in the rapture no no it's not going to get you in glory it's believing what god did through the prophet it's believing the word and then i know there's there's many that believes costing a prophet oh yeah and only that again i brought it out out of one of the messages the prophet brought and they'll say i believe gus and the prophet answer the prophet he gave us a message that's right it's like brother brown said to his own church he said that's right he said he said you're in the message but he said the message is not in you he was telling that to his own his own people so god help us brother is the message in you is the message in me if it is it is christ in us in control yeah he's the one that controls our thoughts our motives objectives what we do what we don't do and we're following his leadership by the grace of god but again make sure to be aware of this that you you're gonna you're gonna keep your spirit right and your attitude right it wasn't not you doing it if he's with you and then you eat he'll do it keep your attitude right your spirit right your motive objective objectives right is all for the glory of god and the will of god in your life amen so grace to us that by faith as moses went forth did what he did so by faith we go forth and doing what we're doing when we do it how we do it and it's all for the glory of god amen just give the glory to jesus by the grace of god amen let's go forth with faith real faith showing god in control yeah not the devil in control not religion in control it's god in control amen and brother sister by the grace of god our emphasis is always the word the word the word amen because faith comes by hearing the word amen so grace brother that we're going to hear the word the way god wants us to hear it how god wants us to hear it where god wants us to hear it so it'll it'll produce the faith that god is looking for no wonder jesus when he was questioning martha he's asking us the same question concerning her brother he said he'll rise again oh she said i know he'll do that and he said in the in the resurrection up back you know from martha's time maybe 2 000 years yes he said but i am the resurrection and the light he said believe us thou this brother he was challenging her then challenging the believers then and he's challenging us now because this is the hour of the resurrection where that's right god what did god do all he did in william branham what's god working on now brother what he did he brought forth the word that will give us resurrection and rapturing faith to get us out of here by grace amen and now god's working on on on the ministry preaching to the bride what for to to to to work on that faith amen to make it more and more real to us amen to get us to the place where we're going to forget it forget the things of the world and keep our our thoughts on on faith keep our thoughts on what god is doing amen and and god is trying to get us out by grace get us out brother he was working he was working in egypt through moses and so on all at four just just to open the way so that israel could walk on out until it got to the place where pharaoh said get out of here let him go because he couldn't take no more oh yeah so brother sister i pray grace at the devil facing the challenge of our faith he's one he's going to step back and say let him go amen and go on great grace of god be with us show god's grace to help us by faith moses so by faith this church by faith you brothers and sisters this is what you're doing this is what's controlling the life you live amen and you're living for god you're living for the promise of the resurrection you're living for the promise of the rapture lord all you did help us to keep our eyes on what you are doing and brother all he did through the ministry of william branham and the the opening of the seven seals the mysteries of god what was why did god do all that oh well it was the end so god wanted to do this yes but why the purpose of it is to give us the faith that we need the purpose of it all is to give us resurrection rapturing faith to get out of time and into eternity amen it wasn't just to do this oh yeah god did this god did that but i pray god pray grace that god is accomplishing what he desired in you and in me through the word amen praise the lord i appreciated our brother jonathan when he was ministry and uh bringing out the scriptures bringing out the scripture bring out the scripture amen and then then the the quotes of the prophets quotes of the prophet the quotes of the prophet amen the alpha and the omega by the grace of god giving us the faith that pleases god do you have the faith that pleases god amen that well what is the faith that pleases god now it's the faith for the resurrection and the rapture it's the faith to get out of here amen to get the bride out by the grace of god because why because we're living in the hour of judgment anything going on in the world is judgment brother judgment is not coming judgment is here god help us to look up by grace because that's what he told us when you see this see this see this happening he said look up because your redemption draweth nigh the resurrection the rapture grace of god to us and again i'll leave you with this thought the prophet of god said
