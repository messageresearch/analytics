prayer requests and God's will be done again not my will father dying be done God knows amen so we pray the grace of God that we're going to submit to him we don't always know when it comes to the will of God if it's not recorded here and we then we have to wait on the Lord amen for him to control our thoughts our words and our deeds so the grace of God be with those under prayer request and also our the grace of God be with our brother Bob and sister Brenda's they travel amen so it'll be a few days I guess some day they'll be back so i dro pray that got a bless their fellowship with our brother Doug sister Beverly and sister Edna in Deer Lake and brother Bob has opened a fellowship with them and also to visit with brother George Heath at the he's in the same home now that sister Edna's in so we pray the grace of God with our brother amen and last time I met him our brother George was in New Brunswick and that was a number of years ago so and I think he was in a home they put him in a home there his family did and now he's back here in Newfoundland so god bless him a man and god bless brother Bob fellowship with with the Saints there in Deer Lake in that area by the grace of God unfortunately he may not have the time to stop and fellowship with others so again if any of the saints are going out that way we certainly encourage you to to take into consideration the brothers and sisters that are out there a man and whether it's our brothers and sisters in Carlinville whether it's the Saints in in bought wood a man or central Newfoundland brand falls so they're Saints there and you could go right on through to dearly amen and there are a number of those Saints of course are supporting the ministry here supporting this assembly so I I think that they they certainly they required but I think they also deserve our fellowship when we travel across the island a man and again and I think that's the will of God and so don't don't do your will our will is we want to do this we want to do that but what does God want you to do a man so I pray and you know it's like if you're going over there and you just ignore them well I think you're ignoring Jesus that is the absolute truth you're ignoring Jesus that's right but if you really want to fellowship with Jesus you're going to fellowship with them because they're also representing Jesus amen and that's where as I said before we are his ambassadors a man so and I'm sure if you were an ambassador for for Canada you will certainly take into consideration Canadians when you travel and of course to thank God for that for that thing that he has given us as Newfoundlanders and it's been highlighted you know around the world concerning new for Landers they say wherever new fermenters go they get together and that's not that's not like a lot of people don't have that that idea they don't have that nature but they said new Flanders do and that is that is the truth yes to ask the absolute truth wherever they go and you find new Flanders you're going to get together with Duford Landers and and so on and they said there's a well they said there's not a place you can go they don't think and again that was a that was a very popular magazine noted magazine around the world as it were especially in the in the Western world and they said that there's nowhere you can go but he said you'll find a new Philander a man and they did I like the fact and that that they were in India and of course they were they were in a very very important building in India and so on and I don't remember the name of the building now but it's a common name our brother Vajra would know but as I said this dis gentleman from the magazine there he got on the elevator and went to go down the floor of course he noticed that the gentlemen you know the young man that was controlling the elevator didn't look like an Indian so he asked him where he was from I mean he said where are you from well he said he said I'm from Newfoundland by all he said yes I know he knew by the way that he talked and he knew by the way did he look and he said it's amazing no matter where you go there's a new Philander well wherever you go there's Jesus a man I trust were reflecting that and as I said before that during the during way back years ago that new Freeland was as it were the the Bible Belt of Eastern Canada there are certain certain states in the United States that is the Bible Belt of the United States a man because that's that's where you find the moving of the Spirit of God was more in certain states not all states were just certain ones a man and and so it says in when it comes to in Canada when it comes to the moving of the Spirit of God there's more in Newfoundland than any other province that's right that's the truth because whether whether it's the Salvation Army where there's the Pentecost the the moving of the Spirit of God was more ear than then any anywhere else he went to come to Canada and he just went from here to somewhere else so we thank God for that and we trust it's the same when it comes to the message of the hour amen by the grace of God so Lord bless us as we continue in the message a man so let's Stan and Melissa sing only believe all things are possible as we go to the word amen so just keep all the Saints in prayer and the grace of God be with them amen Oh Oh all things are

believe with all of our hearts enabling us Lord to commit everything absolutely into your hands into your care and believe that all is well in the Lord hallelujah and believe Lord it is written to believe thus saith the Lord to believe what you have said in your word a man so we ask that grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah that we're not going to doubt we're going to believe whether when I go into that we're going to claim the promise of God father again it is not my real father thine be done amen we're seeking and looking for your will father we find your will in your word and we're asking Lord for your will in our lives we're asking for your will in the leadership nor that we have in everyday living amen the will of God not the will of the devil or not the will of unbelief not the will of doubt but the will father of absolutely perfect faith that pleases God amen the faith that believes the Fae that trusts God the fail or that commits all things into your hands Alleluia the faith that trusts you amen absolutely completely Lord ain't I believing that you do all things well amen that you have never failed Lord we have failed but you have never failed help us support ourselves under your control help us to put ourselves under your leadership of us have put ourselves under the will of God to constantly always declare not my will father dying be done a man regardless of the circumstances regardless of the decision father it is your will a man when looking for the will of God father in this hour we're looking for the will of God in this age we're looking for the will of God father concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture we're looking for the will of God concerning our worship a man not my real father thine be done so we're asking that Grayson Antonian in our lives tonight that you will open it to our understanding and our revelry the revelation to our hearts you Lord the will of God ain't man father that grace Lord as you prayed so we pray not my real father thine be done Oh Lord that's grace that is absolute grace Lord because Lord our will is based on your word our will is based on the revelation nor the one you have spoken in your word amen the revelation of Lord what you have done and what you have shown us in your prophets once you have shown us yourself in flesh grace for the will of God in our lives amen grace for the will of God in what we do how we do it where we do it when we do it grace for the will of God in our ray in the revelation nor that comfort that cook controls our lives amen the will of God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the grace of God amen to keep us in the will while we know it'll be according to the world race race in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God your glory Lord amen so it's not our will is yours in us amen Greece [Music] [Music] a man praise the Lord god bless you turn with me to Matthew st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 26 sent you chapter 26 praise the Lord and beginning to read at verse 36 then cometh Jesus with him on to a place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit here while I go and pray yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy a man and then saith he to them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death grace that we're experiencing the joy of the Lord even unto the resurrection and the rapture we're dying to ourselves and dying to the world and becoming more and more alive to eternity so he said my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me Jesus in the flesh being an example to us in prayer a man that we there are time when we experience what II was experiencing not our will but is will be done as he was healing to the father's will from eternity a man whole my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt God's grace to us that in all circumstances in all situations we're going to yield to the will of God a man and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter what could we not watch with me could you not watch with me one hour one hour [Music] watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation we need to watch we need to pray amen the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak so even this was permitted to give us wisdom revelation understanding concerning prayer and concerning the battle with the flesh that he had a battle with the flesh so we also have a battle with the place a man now facing exactly what he was facing but we have other issues that we deal with when it comes to prayer but brother everyone are we going to stay in prayer are we going to give ourselves over to prayer as Jesus gave himself a man praise the name of the Lord then he wasn't he wasn't going to yield to it to the weakness of the flesh a man he was going to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and he cometh under the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter what could she not watch with me one hour they want less than that in worship today watch and pray that he entered not into temptation showing us the significance of prayer the sing evidence of being on our guard father and brothers was ever in any our in any ages in this hour and in this age a man we're in it is deception to the place to enter the place where Jesus said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved this is serious a man and whether we ought to have a serious attitude in our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ a serious attitude when it comes to the revelation of the word a serious attitude when it comes to what God asked as laid in our laps the revelation the responsibility ain't man this is not what they got over there no no that's the foolish virgin we're supposed to be the wise virgins by the grace of Almighty God so I trust we go wherever we got the wisdom of God and we got the leadership of God in our lives not my real father thine be done this is the wisdom of God all my brother it is serious and I tradition is more serious than what a lot of believers really think oh we gonna do we don't have to worry God did this God did that and we're going to real girl going in a rapture we're going in the resurrection all in all brother sister brother got God God is building us up in the faith for the resurrection God is building us up in the faith for the rapture amen but how many are getting into the word and let the word get into them to produce that faith amen or they just got it in their heads or the thing well I yeah oh my god I believe the message so I don't have to worry you know I'm not worried it's making your calling and election sure Amen right I'll tell you to worry I'm just tellin turns telling to get serious with God get serious with the word get serious with the revelation Amen that God has given us in this hour let it let that control you not it's not you controlling the revelation it's a revelation controlling you a man is now you controlling God is God controlling you Amen so brother watch and pray so you got to watch and you got to pray I'll tell you this what you see if you're really watching with your heart brother it's going to produce the prayer amen that pleases God and it says watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation amen temptation to doubt the Word of God the temptation to do what's right in your own eyes the temptation to yield to your will and not God's will a man yes whether this is when it comes down to a man this is why that our Lord amen it's an example for you and me and this is what he said what he said he said not Montone ek came to this place when the pressure that he was under amen the burden that he was married to finally said not my will then be done brother I was an example for you and for me a man where to learn by what he what he what he went through whittler by what what he experienced so he said watch and pray as since in he's given us counsel they'ii enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak a man and he went away again the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done amen and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words a man what not my will father dying be done grace god bless you should be seated so are we in the will of God are doing I review in our will not saying here tonight and yeah and yet a there can your your personal will can be controlling you here instead of the will of God you could be thinking at all you got these thoughts you got those thoughts you're wondering about this and wondering about that but is that the will of God what is God's will for you in this service this evening what does God want how does God want you to think how does God want you to act how does God want you to react what is God expecting from you in this service a man sir brother yeah I believe that God goddess expecting you to say what he said right here not my real father then be done because it's coming - it's coming to the to the decision of whether or not I'm I'm I'm over to God or are it's I I'm trying to control God or is God controlling me a man I'm I in the will of God or am I trying to get God to do things according to my will a man sir brother what is the will of God for you tonight what is the will of God for me tonight what is the will of God for the sisters for the brothers for those online or for those in in in DVD land or or or wherever might hear this message what is the will of God for your life amen not just here in church and I just say I do believe the message but what is will of God for your life in what you're doing in the natural a man oh and the drought you got in and the life you're living and so on and your family and your friends and your neighbors and so on what is the will of God so are we in the will of God is the will of God in control of us when it comes to our relationship with with with all of these things a man when it comes to our jobs when it comes to doing this when it comes to doing that going here going there what is the will of God brother sister we need to come to that place no matter whenever what the decision is we have to make brother we got to come to that place and we got to watch and pray and we got to humble ourselves with Lord not my wheel fine be done well I I don't feel that that God is against his we got us again now saying God is against that or against that but brother what is the will of God a man who's anything God is going to bless it is a brother or sister a son or a daughter it is a life that is that is that it's lined up with his will it is a life that is looking for his will it is life that is there to do his will a man 3 again that's why God has been looking for all the way down through not much someone that's their desperate that's willing to accept the will of God and not their own will and rather we can go right back again to the book of Genesis a man brother Wayne and again that that's the choice Alleluia that's exactly the choice that man is given as a choice whether when it comes to the original sin it is either the will of God or your will a man and then Satan was challenging that in II a man are you subject to the will of God are you controlled by the will of God or you know what is it oh and Eve say yeah if God said yeah he said God has said but I say unto you and and he said it in such a way so it's so it's too ordered the truth to deceiver he said it in such a way as to or to get her attention and the other hand she listened to what he was saying amen she listened to him when he added that one word yay I say a day God has said but any bad there's no buts brother but but Sir last hour some brother brought it here one time but Sir sheep not sheep but goats goats but but sheep don't but hey man there's goats cool but here and they bought this and they bought that hey yeah but brother the sheep don't but the Sheep just follows those Templars a man they they recognize the the voice of the shepherd they recognize the hearing of the of the word of the Shepherd amen and they know their shepherd a man by Hawaii because the Sheep knows that the Shepherd knows them and they know the shepherd a man praise the name of the Lord as I told you what we saw hey in Israel when we're a in Jerusalem in the hotel there way and we looked at and we saw all of these sheep in this field and then all of a sudden we saw you know all the sheep begin the move and some wind this way and some wind that way some in another way and we are wondering what going on until we noticed that there was four or five different shepherds and they had called the Sheep and this one was calling his sheep that was calling is she another was calling is she and there she recognized their voice a man and that's why they were moving in and out between each other a man - why because they they were going into the direction of the voice of their shepherd and this one went this way that one win that way another one went that way a man they brother see there's their faithful to the voice of their Shepherd they're not good they're not going to obey the voice of another Shepherd no just their Shepherd amen hallelujah no will no wonder why God God our God put these examples in the scripture of shepherds and sheep that God is calling a sheep not goats God is comparing us to sheep because why sheep are going to recognize the voice of their Shepherd and they're going to stay with their Shepherd amen when they're super cows they're going to recognize his voice and they're going to follow him amen whether it was in Luther's day on Wesley's day the Pentecostal age or whether it was even the old-fashioned Salvation Army a man they heard the Shepherd and they went that way all mine oh yeah what's wrong with you Wesley what's wrong with you Luther oh I'm following the voice of the shepherd a man and then when when they brought him but Luther up before the council and they wanted him to deny this and deny that they want him to go along with the church and deny what God had revealed to them and Luther just took his stand and he said this is the Word of God this is this is that and the finally and they even threatened his life but he said listen he said here I stand he said I can do no other amen he could do no yes as a believer he knew he could do anything else but stay with the word he could do anything else but stay with what God had revealed to him he wasn't going to compromise for the church hey man he wasn't going to compromise for the ministry and there there's many believers today there are compromising for ministries a man compromising for this kind of noise over there and allowing this for now in there ain't man they are but brother I turn this where's the ministry is trying to get you on fire for God where's the minister trying to get you on fire with the revelation of the Resurrection the revelation of the rafter keep keep these things look lift up your ears look look look a man by the grace of God watch watch the revelation of the rapture what's the revelation of the resurrection amen and pray pray pray well Frank keeping the spirit a night praying is keeping in line with God keep it in line with the will of God so you're not going to miss the rapture so you're not going to miss the resurrection by the grace of God amen you got a watch and pray watch what God has revealed and pray amen for the grace of God what for to become one with that revelation and that revelation is made flesh in you amen the revelation was made flesh in Martin Luther the revelation was made flesh and Wesley and the old fashioned salvation army the Pentecostals and other and other groups that God was using amen it was made flesh in there by the grace of Almighty God and what a man they were doing the will of God amen oh they're the temptation was there to do this the temptation were there to compromise but no not my real father thine be done I'm gonna stay with your word I'm going to stay with what you have revealed to me I'm not going to change I'm not going to compromise and I just going to take the letter of it I'm going to take the spirit of it ain't name Lord and I want it made flesh in me and I'm going to live it amen by the grace of God amen but then ever then there arose a third generation and the father God warned us that is raised the third generation that everything begins to change and by the time they get into the fourth generation that Akama denomination amen so there was a there was a Lutheran denomination after the third or fourth generation came on the scene amen because what were they liking they were lacking the experience of justification they were lacking the experience of justification with Jesus Christ amen Luther had they had they had the experience that he le lujah went winning when he got to the Word of God and and he entered into a oneness with the word he believed the word and this is the will of God is the word of God amen and he believed the word and he accepted it hallelujah whoa brother and he got a true the baptism of the Holy Ghost he got the experience of justification hey man he was no longer worried about it he was no longer wondering about it he was no longer Oh God justify be trusted by me uh-huh he got the revelation that he was justified in Jesus a man that Jesus a justified him treason and LuAnn went on down you know we bless Lee and all the rest Jesus that's a to fight them Jesus that filled them with the holy ghost amen and give them access to the gifts of the Spirit amen all down through the ages is not it's not me is Jesus a man that justified me and Luther went out any Oh hallelujah he didn't care they're gonna kill him he was justified hey man he didn't care they're gonna do this I'm justified I can do no other I got a stay with the word amen he got the revelation of the will of God amen he wasn't he wasn't going to go back to the church and I got to do this to be justified I got to do that to be justified I got to be faithful to the church to be justified no no he knew that he was already justified in Jesus came a and Wesley knew that he was already sanctified in Jesus we're already fulfilled with the Holy Ghost in our experience with the Lord Jesus Christ we had access to the gifts of the Spirit and know brother sister we're already I have access to the resurrection and the rapture in Jesus Alleluia oh yeah exactly why I have been resurrected I have been raptured and let me repeat it again because there are those that never heard it hey man as I say when I when I was ministry to a church or maybe 300 people or 400 and it was somewhere up there and we all say up in Canada and and I was ministering and I said I just want to let you know I've been raptured I won't let you know I've been resurrected it was quiet yeah got rid quiet and everybody been looking at each other oh yeah even the pastor looked her yeah I said oh Lord after they don't believe it because they don't understand it I said I have been resurrected I have been raptured and I said that's Bible and I said I'm going to be resurrected ain't going to be raptured amen and I said I brought him again to Ephesians chapter 2 and I said you had the quicken you had he made alive you have the erector a resurrected who were dead in sins and trespasses and I said now as I go on down and I see we've been caught up into heavenly places in Christ I said I've been raptured a man I said I have been resurrected in my soul I've been raptured in my soul I've been caught up into a heavenly place in Christ and what's going on there the words being revealed a million and it's going to give me the faith for a physical resurrection and a physical rapture praise the name of the Lord but the Deaf Bible amen and thank God for the revelation in this hour in this age but in other ages they never known they never recognized that and they never understood that they never taught the revelation of what God had already done in with concerning resurrection and rapture because the emphasis the emphasis was on justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit my brother we were moving beyond Pentecost we are moving into the time and the hour for the resurrection the hour for the rapture we're in that age now where now that we're not in the Pentecostal age were not in Luther's age Wesley's age we're experiencing what God did in those ages plus a man but God has given us something else now brother there's fewer and fewer and fewer going to experience it yes she reviewer that are going to recognize it big a man it's back there they believe oh yeah God sent a messenger named was where Martin Luther hey oh yeah and he taught us about justification God sent a messenger Wesley taught us about sanctification Oh God sent others say they taught us about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen and brother and they went off into denomination made a church out of it and that's all they've reached a man man then they were looking for this they weren't looking for that but what about the resurrection what are the rapture thank God for justification thank God for st. vacations thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the gifts of the Spirit amen my brother it comes to a place where God is going to climax it with the resurrection and rapture a man and come to a place where we got to get out of here amen and we got to get out of these parties we need to we absolutely need to get out of these bodies we need to get out of here brother what for because God's is going to make a new heaven and a new earth and then Barbado God said yeah he said the new heaven and new earth that's going to be born again he said like you were born again you become a new creature so it's going to become a new heaven a new earth amen and the whole scene is going to be gone do not mean any scene that's why God is gonna throw the earth he's that into the Sun and it's gonna burn nice away fire and it's gonna burn he's right from the center out amen so there's nothing left there's no sin left no unbelief left nothing amen try and God is going to do that and we're ain't may God help us God may make it more real to us than the world we're living in brother I trust by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I trust by the resurrection and the revelation of the rapture in our souls whether they were that the the the world to come the new heaven and new earth is more real to us than this one and it is more real to us we're going to be hungry and thirsty for it oh yeah we're going to be hungry and we're going to be thirsting for the new heaven and new earth we're just not satisfied watch and pray watch and pray Jesus saw what was coming amen thank God the other that he yielded to it to redeem us to us what for to show to resurrect us and rapturous virtually and to resurrect us and rapturous physically amen by the grace of God so watch and pray watch what God has promised and pray lord help us in the name of Jesus that we're going to be ready for it we may nor that we're going to yield ourselves to not my will thine be done it came to that place in our Lord's ministry brother a man it's a challenge absolutely a challenge to heal ourselves to the will of God amen see they they left they loose left to the will of God in Luther's age Westridge age the Pentecostal age and all of the revivals that God said they got out of the will of God into the will of me amen they started to follow man man's leadership man's ideas man's teaching a man instead of a instead of the Holy Ghost that's the absolute truth mother and that's why they denominated and they become a lutheran denomination a Methodist denomination a May and the Salvation Army denomination a Pentecostal denomination because they got out of the spirit and into the flesh a man they got out of their spirit and began to follow me name began to follow me and they were following me Pali man oh yeah I believe he's spiritual I believe he says so they weren't spiritual they were religious hey man they went from being spiritual with the Holy Ghost anointing to being religious all brother and God is not looking for religion God is not in religion God is in the God is in the Holy Ghost our faith College and the Holy Ghost experienced in his sons and daughters Amen my brother is not the life of a man is the life of God Alleluia it's a type of guardian the bride is that I forgot in the believers the life of God in J Martin Luther's the life of God in John Wesley the life of God in William Booth that's the absolute truth brother it was the life of God in the Pentecost dearly Pentecostals by the grace of God see Wes here that's what God is looking for is life and it's his life amen and it was his life it's going to line up with the word if it's his life in you it's going to stay with the word if his life in yo the life of God in you it's good it's going to look for the word for that for the day in the hour that you're living in a million we thank God for what he did then and what he did another age and another age but Lord what are you doing in this age Lord according to the prophecy we thank you for the Pentecostal age we thank you for the Pentecostal anointing but not according to the prophecy every word father we're in the hour for the resurrection we're in the hour for the rapture Lord hallelujah praise the name of the Lord as the party of God said he stood the satin seal he said as for the bride he said the silent revert is for Israel amen and there was was a they have had their their their their Feast of Trumpets amen and it is seven trumpets but the seventh trumpet a man was the collie of Israel to the word hey man but the Santa seal was the calling of the bride to the word hey listen old brother he called Luther to the word he called Wesley to the word he called the bay the the old-fashioned Salvation Army the Pentecostals of the word and other revivals that God started he called them to the Word of God for their day for their our brother and they believed that a man but brother again the third or fourth generation just made a denomination and instead of following God they're following me hey man that's the truth and then they wanted to highlight what they believe they wanted to highlight we know what the messenger for their age were brought or Luthor Wesley or will we will honor them God honored them you honor them brother by believing what God revealed but but you don't stop there you keep on going amen but see they stopped and they made a nomination and then they wouldn't go on with it with Wesley they would stop the name Wesley's age and they wouldn't go on with William move they stopped the wheel abou sage and they wouldn't go under the Pentecostals even though that William Booth it even his wife even when she preached amen she pointed them to Pentecost and he pointed them to Pentecost and he said you know what we need he said oh yeah he's preaching that during the latter latter days of his ministry he said what we need is what they add on the day of Pentecost oh yeah you're putting him plenty they're putting him let's must believe for this let's play for this amen but they went off into denomination and all of them but a lot of them went often to denomination but again when God began to move by the Spirit amen and the restoration of what he had given in Pentecost see we were coming to the end of the church ages what started the church agents now is coming to the end a man a man a man the revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the gifts of the Spirit amen but what introduced that revelation it was the Alpha Ministry in Jesus Alleluia it was God the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the flesh called Jesus amen and what did he do he went a brother he went and he resurrected us and he raptured us spiritually amen but then he went on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the day of Pentecost and they went on and on down through the ages he did this and this and this and death under finally in the last day she be brought he restored the Pentecostal baptism and the Pentecostal Rivera a man but where now is the resurrection and rapture it was in the it was in the Alpha ministry now this in the Omega ministry amen and the part of God said after the opening of the seals amen and after the revelation of this mystery in this mystery of the seventh seal amen and all these things that God was do they God had done it's done he's not God's going to do it God has done it god help us to believe I to what it was and what it is now hey man by the grace of Almighty God under finally he pointed to our he said the fullness of the Godhead bodily easton is now in the bright amen brother this pillar of fire ain't 9 again they detonated that is not just a pillar of fire that is gone but what is wonder what is that the trophies were salted to deliver them out of Egypt it was the pillar of fire a man that was with Moses the pillar of fire that was with him with the messengers that God has said to bring Israel out amen and it was God a man with his servant guarding his private garden in the message that that he had to come out of Egypt to deliver them amen and the part of God so we thank Lord that you have delivered us out of an agenda now an Egyptian denominational Egyptian bondage David they were brought out of Evan and Nora regular the real Egypt a million they were there as slaves and now he said God in this hour you have brought you have come to deliver us out of Egyptian denominational bondage Amen because we're in we're in organized religion it was like the Israelites in Egypt there they were slaves to that to through to the to Egypt and brother believers and then so-called Christians today are some of them are even slaves to churches today oh yeah they're slaves for this church to slaves for this brother sixty-eight million later of their lives for the gospel but it is there's millions who have laid down their life for churches oh yeah they laid down her life for churches they died for this church type of that church and so on that's right but how many are dying for the gospel amen how many of us are dead to ourselves dead to the world for the sake for the sake of the gospel for the sake of this message are you dead to the world Halon or is the world still in influence in your life is the world still in influencing your thoughts in your mother's and your objectives and you what you want to do where you want to do and how you want to do it is the world influencing you or is it God influencing you amen is it the will of the world the will of the first or is it the will of God brother as the public God preached doing God a service without his will amen or does not that their worldly there's their religious and they're doing God doing this for God doing that for God but it's not according to the will of God oh my brother's sister what are you doing for God amen is it according to his will that's what we got assembly wiggling I ministered on hearing and seen the Word of God by the grace of God so hearing it the way God wants us to hear it it's seen it the way God wants us to see it in this and is having a right motive and a right objective for the for the glory of God and giving God the preeminence in our lives a man sir brother if we are we're going to be doing God a service with his will hey man but it's a generation of doing God a service without as well they're doing this for God doing that for God but it's not the will of God in his country to the word all their religious or mine very very very religious right to the car as it were but out of the will of God amen and yet God is giving them a witness giving the mootness and they're turning it down turning it down oh yeah amen brother concerning what God has done in this age in this hour but then what he did in what he did in his self a ministry he did in this Omega ministry amen because that province has stood there and he said this is not me this is him he said I can't do this he couldn't do that the winner the prophet of God couldn't couldn't do that we didn't do the sign he had in his hand he couldn't do that no way where do the winner that anointing come from what was it when he when he would take the hand a day when he went to our sister 'but aziz air when he took her hand hey man and and he said what would happen and he took her hand and of course it is aim would be would be moving here oh yeah and it would be all your love like you had a maybe your hand on an electric wire somewhere oh yeah and it was moving moving and as you can see it and she saw it a man she saw it she give us our witness here a man when she went into his house and he took her hand and she saw his hand and as well that wasn't william branham that was god hey man and then when you could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and brother not only the past and the present but the future amen past present and future so that wasn't winner man that was gone a man and i know that one brother was telling me how that a certain person of a certain denomination in the town they they live in era newfoundland oh they were saying oh hey William Branham he was he was controlled by the devil brother that's serious they're gonna the answer for that oh my god have mercy on that woman for saying that winner man was controlled by the devil and the signs that he had that was from the devil and he did this that was the devil he did that that was it oh brother if they're saying that about what happened in winter in Browns ministry they would have said the same thing in the days of Jesus hey man oh yeah because he had that ministry a man he had those signs and wonders he was just learning the thoughts and intents of the heart he was doing this he was doing that amen brother that was God that wasn't the devil that was God mother that those they called him the devil brother they were committing to any absolute sin I pray God had mercy on that woman amen to bring conviction her heart or soul amen all condemn condemning the prophet of God because this is somebody in her family was all being influenced by the message someone who had being influenced way by the thoughts about William Brannon and who he was and so on my brother and all my because she was why she was taking her stead for denomination she was taking her sad for her church but not the word Taylor said for for a man but not not not God brother it wasn't William Branham it was God and again brother again when the belem didn't didn't take the glory he give the glory to God and that's what he said if you look at that picture in you you have you seen anything else on that picture other than the pillar of fire he said you're something wrong yeah don't don't see him no no he says don't look at me he's looking at him amen brother sister again why because they when that picture was taken here they there took a number of pictures of the minister that was challenging him the minister was calling him a false prophet they took picture of the picture the picture and when he got up they took a picture just one yeah and to pay then they notice the pillar fire they even like though you know it but they even went to and got the FBI they come and check the picture oh yeah they got the FBI and then the FBI checked it and the FBI went to where it was taken and see if there was a light there there was no light there no this is no light there they said dude and he said well where did they come from he said well that's the reason because it was there when you took the picture yeah brother it was God amen because because he made it just made a statement and to defend himself and a there I don't know many thousand people were in the in that audience tree at the time amen but again they're the news people were there taking pictures and so on and then he just he just made a statement and then he heard though he heard the whirlwind and he he said I I'll say no more he said got it the Lord has spoken he knew they God had come down how he wasn't sure but that was it right there Amen so brother that way that wasn't with a band that was gone and then that cloud of angels that wasn't William Brennan that was gone hey man and again science science guy got no explanation with a pillar of fire science got no explanation for the cloud of angels and science got no explanation for here for the altar of fire amen again this is this is like I said this is Ricky alert ooh and brothers the altar of fire and here's we're gonna BAM there but he said you're seeing me there but he said I'm right here and he is I can see him there he's there brother that wasn't God that was that was God rather but it wasn't the devil and it wasn't with him random it was Jesus amen brother this is this is not revealing winner Branum this is this is just as revealing Jesus Christ he was giving their premise to God amen and even Jesus in the flesh he was God in flesh but he was given preeminence to God hey man he was giving premise to the Father amen praise the ER though he was the father and he's throwing the father one hey man sorry but again he just it was a lesson an example for you and me he was the example for you and me to give preeminence to God hey man for the glory of God so brother we're going to do God a service but according to his will we can be doing it by contrary to his will without his will and if it's real as well he's not pleased with it I'll give you a couple of samples in the in the scripture there there's many many examples in the scripture where the word this one did this and this one did that but they didn't do it according to the will of God if it was according to the will of God God would have been well pleased and he would receive that he would have blessed him a man is like David going down to bring back the Ark of the Covenant but he did this he did it this way didn't do it so he didn't do it but he didn't consult the Prophet amen to get the counsel of doing it God's Way a man and that's why God come and did what he did and stopped it and again there was a time when David wanted to he wanted to they order take a number of the children of Israel to see how many he had all I got this many and I got I can fight this did this country I can fight that nation that nation so on amen and his faith was in the number that he had it not in God amen and God come down in God to God so David yeah and he said my son he said I'm gonna give you I got you two or three choices to give you he sought to judge you he said which one do you want a man that's God's grace but I didn't it didn't it didn't take away what he's gonna do but he just gave David a choice amen what what God was gonna do why because David doing what he did and numbering the people was a contrary to the will of God God wasn't pleased why because there was testimony of his lack of faith in God he wasn't believing God he wasn't trusting God amen on saying well I got no words he's got us with us and God gives us the victory God's gonna do this and so on no he felt that if if he had a great number and he had more numbers than than than the other end the enemy had or the other nation had he had no worse brother no matter how few he had if his faith was in God he had no words amen brother story there God's come down and judge David for what he did and how he did it brother how are we doing what we're doing in our lives amen are you doing the will of God with us a sister in her home with us or are at work with us too brother any in his home we're at work are you doing that are you doing everything according to the will of God amen God brother God judges this God shows us that a man because what you do and don't do it brother it determines what spirit you're under while spirits controlling you a man is that God in control or is it the devil brother Sony II see this is either the Spirit of God or the spear of the devil and Satan is using our senses hallelujah God uses faith the soul the will of God amen not my will fathered by B watch and pray and when you watch and pray you're not looking for your wheel you're looking for God's will Amen Lord it's your will is important not mine what would you want me to do how would you want me to do it Lord all brothers sister and this if there's anything that I've had to deal with over the years is it when I mount my own believers is they want their own will they do and and when it comes are going out they're not doing what God wants them to do how God wants them to do it where and when God wants them to do it they're doing what they want to do oh I want to do this I need this and I need that listen leave it with God and go on amen not my will father thine be done anybody nor Debbie's your will you will provide this if it's your will you'll provide that I want to Lidl you amen but that's the kind of faith that God looking for he's looking for there Amen this is faith he's not they say it's not based on your census and what your stretchers identify with your census are all know that I see this I feel this I know this and so on no no forget it the enemy that's the enemy oh I tell you brother that devil is there and he knows what he can do to influence you so that you're going to go by your senses and not by faith oh yeah that's what he's there to do see God had given Adam and Eve that faith of his word stay with the word amen but the enemy come a lot for to appeal to her census a man oh yeah because when the enemy and the enemy had done what he had done to Adam and Eve oh yeah you see it again just to show you and she said it's good for food see you appeal to her senses and he said it is pleasant to the eyes no faith is all the senses a man and a tree to be desired to make one wise intellectual it's not the spirit of the word it's the letter of the word amen brother who's control who's controlling what you do how you do it when it comes to what what you're allowing in your life what controls your life is that the will of God or is it the will of the devil not my well Father dine be done not the devil's will but the will of God amen or the devil's we'll all brother sister come on in the name of the Lord Jesus was the example and he had nordley is it he was the example where was he going to get food no how many would be willing to be willing to be a John the Baptist out there in the wilderness nobody was cooking food for him no no we want this we want this we want this we want that brother not my will father don't be done I mean are they are content with God hidden and God revealed in simplicity and their ears are content with a simple ol Eagles life amen god help us so that brother we're not gonna take pride in this and pride in that no no way we're gonna take we're gonna take pride is any probably in in God amen in the grace of God in the love of God in the Spirit of God amen not my will is will be done we want to give glory to God not to ourselves but David was in that place where he was getting the attention to himself and invited looking up to David look under David look under Solomon and so on oh yeah and then and then Saul was looking to try to get their people's attention to himself under God took him down he said he will not be will not be the king of Israel no longer mm-hmm oh yeah the Prophet felt bad yeah Samson felt bad Oh take that there Solomon did that Saul did this assaulted that and not only that but God give the word and it was clear what God told him to do and he wouldn't do it or they said we did this and God said you know when he did when he sent them into one of the sea the Amalekites yeah and God said salt addicted to destroy the Amalekites and and and he said all of them men women children and their animals but oh when they came back samuel said you didn't destroy all them what'd you bring that King back for oh well he was the King I brought him back never killed so Samuel wouldn't kill him yeah and they said what do you bring those their animals back for oh he says the peat the soldiers brought them back he said so to offer the sacrifice to God if they should have sacrificed him among the Amalekites oh yeah see God to him destroy at all but what was it it was in complete obedience or you can go out say I'm gonna do the will of God but are you gonna do the whole truth nothing but the truth are you do that the will of God absolutely completely in your life what God wants you even though we might think in the flesh I can't do this I can't do this no lord I don't think you want me to do that Lord oh yes we think if God's going to bless us you know always you know he'll always be prosperous he'll always give us the best know exactly brother you're sometimes God gives us the worst to bring out what seeing us amen see God's got to do this to bring out the right spirit God's got to do this and bring out a right attitude amen see what you're hungry in a thirsting for God will do this God will do that a man he knows he knows your heart and that's why he does this to bring up what's in your heart he did this and this and this to bring up what was his soul hurt a man and there was a time when Saul was guilty of in complete obedience and brother there's many many many believers that are guilty of in complete obedience yeah what they're doing God a service but without his will they're not in the will of God well brothers seriously brother Brown gets into explaining those who are doing God a service without his will and not only that what you can do the Prophet gets into explain what you can do for God even worship God but he said it's not in the spirit just without his will oh yeah oh I'm spiritual I'm this I'm this I'm that but he said you better be in the will of God with the experience or that it's absolutely amazing I said lady and he's preaching this to brendham to her now he's preaching this to believers oh yeah now as I heard as I said when you're willing to read a book and you older brother brems in this yeah but who was he preaching there was he preaching to believers I was he preaching to a mixed audience because he said when he preached her mixed audience and there was believers knew worthiness and there was this there were so many different ones there he said he said sometimes he's he puts this in and he said he said it's filler I saw you'll put this in you'll had this and he had that but he said just fill her and he's not he's not that's really the believer we'll move on over that the believers looking for something deeper and higher by the grace of God but he just put that in for them yeah because they were hungry on thirsting for the head so he just put in filler well that's what he called it oh brother sister and sometimes he said God Lisa didn't get me to say this he said get me to say that he said what for he said to bring up their attitude oh yeah he says sometimes he said I say things that make people laugh sometimes I say thing to me real serious to get them real real real somber he said what what did God want me to say all those things were easy to bring out what's in their heart what's in their spirit oh yeah people people they they all I like this that this this preacher he preaches this way makes you feel good something wrong you got to be on their guard because it may not be God in the preacher Amen because God make you feel good sometimes doesn't rain sent me it make you feel bad amen sometimes you make if you hole up then all the times you make you feel down you put you down to get you to look up amen praise the name of the Lord and brother through the preacher of the word in this hour of this age God is indifferent to bring a separation separation separation why for to get us a little home amen so we're separate from the world and were united with him amen for the resurrection and for the rapture but let's be fairly the will of God during the will of God amen not doing God a service without his will oh yeah see you got to be led by the spirit controlled by the spirit if not you're doing God a service without is will and we can seem spiritual and we can seem religious but yet there's something lacking that God is going to deal with [Music] grace brother in complete obedience and see thought I had it there see we have a complete obedience and sometimes in this and there's other there's another situation in life that God judges us with a man see God's working on us God is working I don't think salvation is oh I mean I'm saved and that's it I don't have to worry tomorrow oh yeah but God's God's gonna work on you God's gonna work on your spirit because working on your attitude God's work and I on your on your um your mind your thoughts your flesh a man say again the devil is working on your flesh to pay man to try to get you to go contrary to what God has got into heart but God in the heart and God in your soul eat brother he's moving out into your spirit to challenge what the devil is doing in your flesh amen that's the absolute truth God is challenging what Satan does in your face and Satan is moving on your thoughts and your feelings and your flesh and sometimes he only inject something this country to the word you get you to do this to get you do that think this think that and then the Holy Ghost on the inside is coming right up with the world amen and maybe God will knock you down to get you look up by the grace of God hey man sure brother let's not be found guilty of in complete obedience as well saw when they brought the king of the Amalekites back when he brought their flocks back and him an aggrieved Samuel aggrieved God and it says aggrieved Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night see if there were others here seeing all that they say what in the world is wrong with Samuel he's a prophet you know when God God blesses Israel God does this God does that you know come on Sammy would he listen they didn't obey God they didn't do the will of God though they did God a service but it wasn't his will amen it wasn't God's will for them to bring the cattle back it wasn't God's will for them to bring the the king back and and there was somebody that question why did God tell tell them to kill even the children the prophet of God explained it someone asked him they said God told him to kill the children after he preached that he said yes and they said why he said because they were growing and melech heights and he said they had a heart against Israel that's right God knew what was in their heart and that's why he sent Saul down kill them kill them all kill man woman and children why listen Saints the brother the prophet of God said he said seed of God can give birth to serpent seed and he said serpent seed can give birth to seed of God amen there's be on our guard this is serious amen don't think older oh that's that that their mother and father is serpent seed yeah but maybe that child that son that daughter is a seed of God see it's like there are some pictures that I have on my computer like a screensaver and it's popping here and popping there and and they're paintings and I could explain to you look you see that oh yeah the spiritualists nice yeah but I said that was painted by a child paid it by a young girl that was raised in an atheistic home and she was raised as an atheist but when she became like a teenager ha what was in the soul began to come out a man praise the Lord what she was she was recognizing that there is a God I believe in God amen God was dealing with her she was recognizing it and of all the family she came out as a seed of God just think of that you talk about predestination foreknown before the foundation of the world she was and she came out and she all the pictures that she painted and they were ended and a family was shocked you believe that yes I believe that pictures of heaven features of the seed of God oh yeah pictures of sons and daughters of God how they act how they gather they dress and so on absolutely amazing I said Lord bless her wherever she is amen see if you're a seed of God you're gonna stay with the Word of God if you're a seed of God you're going you're gonna be brother you're gonna take your stand for the truth you're gonna stay with it you're not going to compromise if you're the seat of God you're gonna be doing God a service according to his will cuz the seat of God wants the will of God amen right and it said Samuel said to Saul when there was little in thine own site was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel and the Lord sent me on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed and wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord but it's fly upon the spoil and it's evil in the sight of the Lord have you done an evil in the sight of the Lord today what will what evil would you think I did well if there's anything that's contrary to the will of God you did evil in the sight of the Lord you did your will not God's will we need to be on our guard general watch and pray you're gonna pray to stay in the spirit and be led by the spirit you had to pray just to keep the revelation of God in your heart and your soul God in control there's many believers brothers they go to church they've been baptized you know in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and when it comes to dressing the dress you know decent and and the sisters are there this and dad they did they dress decent and so on but the prophet of Gaza you can do that and go to hell what because it's not out of the heart it's just a really religion out of the head of the mind out of your flesh it's got to be from the heart borned again by the grace of God and your bringing forth that that born-again life it's just automatic automatic the devil can come but the but if you're born again the new creature says get thee behind me Satan it is written thus saith the Lord amen if you're born again but if you're not born again you just reason with the devil oh yeah mercy on us oh brother this is serious serious he said thou didst able in the sight of the Lord what were they doing doing God a service without his will because they're saying they brought the cattle back first to offer a sacrifice to the Lord you want to do this for the Lord won't do that for the Lord but that wasn't the will of God do we doing God a service without his will it was their thoughts well as Satan anointing their thoughts and Satan the Knights of thinking of believers oh yeah brothers so deceptive they make but again he'll make you believe it's good for you it's good for this one good for that one but it's deceiving it's not the will of God oh you make me believe those things because why he's using human reasoning fleshly reasoning good for your flesh but not your soul tell you that a nice and Saul said unto Samuel yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord yeah he'll hug you with you I don't meet and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought egged the king of melih of their malachite and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites well if they utterly destroy them where did the King come from Co deceiving they felt because they destroyed all the rest you know then he well yeah that'll please God I'll just bring the King back God to destroy them all including the King and just think if you don't do it the ministry got to do it because Samuel had to change I went and took the king and killed him yeah what a responsibility and Samuel said under Sara Saul said unto Samuel I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way of which the Lord sent me and it brought egged the King of Hell and malachite and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been already destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal well they should have sacrificed it were the Amalekites were amen God said kill it because as far as God was concerned it wasn't is Israel's sheep and oxen it was the Amalekites amen and Sanur said had the Lord a great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord Oh loves God want you to do this isn't this or do you want you just obey he wants you to obey he writes should have follow his leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life the conviction of the Holy Ghost in your soul is what he wants you to follow but yet people think I want to do this for God I wonder you better find the will of God amen doing God a service without his well and the Prophet brings it down to all mine the basics you bring it down to this bring it down to this bring it out of that oh yeah we think all you're religious because you do this for God you do that for God but God's not pleased why because you're you're not doing according to his will you're doing according to your will but not God's Way oh yeah if I could I find in it something a bit hard myself to bring out some of these things Oh amen brother oh yeah I said old or I said you're putting me on the spot you're putting everyone every one of us every brother sisters on the spot here I said this mess just think these are these are like I said the message they preach to the believers god help us Samuel said as the Lord our great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord be old to obey is better than sacrifice hey man therefore all that will make sacrifices he does this does this does this she does this she does that yeah yeah but that one they whatever I tell them to do they do yeah oh you consider them better oh yeah yeah they're sacrificing themselves hey hey man you're sacrificing their own ideas and their own thoughts and so on they're sacrificing their own will for my will for the will of God let's do God a service with his will according to his will amen he said Behold to obey is better than sacrifice amen and oricon then the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft if you refuse to do the will of God God will judge you for witchcraft yeah rebellion because your rebellion against God's will you don't feel this is the will of God you feel this is the will I wanna do to God I think God would do this I think God loved not what you think definitely not it's what God they see examples that God has given us in the world hello praise the name of the Lord hallelu where were that excuse because brother there's not a thing that we would have to deal with but we're somewhere and somewhere it's in the word oh I believe that but you got it you got to be in the spirit to get it so God can convict you of it when you're reading the word Oh Lord oh yes oh Lord I was thinking that I was thinking that Lord I don't want that I'm sorry Lord forgive me we think because we're in the message we think because we're dressed this win that will become two churches for this for that oh I got nowhere soon dieted Oh Lord I'm righteous yeah you better get in the spirit see if you're like a man if you got the Holy Ghost you show you the only goes to show you where you're where you're making a mistake and where your failure your weaknesses he knows oh my it's like I said you can go to hell not because of what you did sometimes it's because of what you didn't do yeah you didn't do the will of God this was the will of God you didn't do it you did your own will yeah your reason you think oh yeah Gaga night against this night against that but the thing of it is is it your is it his will well well God got nothing against it y'all God don't know it's not not opposed to this he's not opposed to that but again that doesn't mean he wants you to do it doesn't mean he want he wants you to do this and do this and do that no no no if it's not according to his widow he knows your spirit he knows what's motivating you did you want to do this you want to do that he knows he knew Saul's spirit and attitude why he wanted this and why he wanted that and so on brother sister let's make our calling and election sure amen make sure that what we do for the Lord is according to his will no matter how religious it is no it might look spiritual to you no don't do it if it's not the will of God rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft yeah if you're gonna rebel against the will of God we think of rebellion or a God fighting God no no rebellion is to go country to his will still be religious and think oh well thank you Lord for saving us the son our daughter you're not doing my will you're still doing what's right in your own eyes do what's right in mine eyes that's what God wants you to do and it says because thou has rejected the word of the Lord yes also rejected they from being King and what was the word there wasn't this doctrine this doctrine this doctrine it was what God wanted them to do in their life God wanted that this is he was a king he was a leader and God wanted him to take take his soldiers out and do this and do this and do this don't change it do it the way God said that's right yeah and they reject the word what is the word the will of God you know this is what Saul rejected the will of God and believers reject the will of God they want their own will it's doing what again was right in their own eyes and this is because that was rejected the word of the Lord yes also rejected thee from being King and if we reject the word of the Lord the will of God that he'll reject us from being the bride now saying we're lost we might be foolish virgins not wise yeah some are lost for sure because of their absolute wrong attitude wrong spirit wrong older strong objectives but if it's not in the will of God yeah might be foolish virgins but they don't get into the marriage supper they turned away and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people or sometimes because you want to be a benefit to the people you want to do this for the people that put it be you won't be good in the eyes of the people no you gotta be good in the eyes of the Lord not the people oh what a deal you have to cost under the betel I stir the number in the after there are so many that are looking for looking for preeminence among the people looking to feel good in the eyes of the people to do this to do that no let's make sure we feel good in the eyes of God amen and because you had rejected the word of the Lord he had also rejected thee from being King or from being the bride and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned prior transgressed the commandment of the Lord he finally admitted it he humbled himself repented nothing you believed he was saved yeah but he was rejected as king he said I had transgressed the commandment of the Lord and thy words and because I feared the people and obeyed their voice yeah they feared the people and there's ministries that dared us to oppress the people yeah because they don't want the people to reject them well if you're gonna preach the word if they're seen of God they won't reject the ministry hey man if you're not they will you know god help us he said I feared the people and obeyed their voice a man it's not doing what the people wants doing what God wants no you want to make the people feel feel good just given the revelation that they need to line up with straighten them out correct them yeah that this is a when it comes to the preacher of the word it is it is the correction by the word keeping us lined up with the word ain't man it's not just building up our knowledge of doctrines no no is to keep us in line with the will of God for and the Word of God so that it'll give us the faith that pleases God for the resurrection and the rapture people think all the ministries there to preach this and preach this and preach this well now I know this now I know that now I know that it's all so it really sometimes impersonal doctrines and theology but whatever personal correction most don't want correction I've experienced that over the years the church has I've been in people don't want correction they don't want the preacher to correct them they don't want the preacher to preach test it I want the preacher preach that no I just preach doctrine we believe this we believe this we believe that it's a Creed we believe no God's grace he's I feared the people and obeyed their voice now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again he said with me that I may worship the Lord and Sonia said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord has rejected thee from being king over Israel a man and the says and Samuel came no more to see Saul on to the day of his death nevertheless Samuel mourn for Saul and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel and God rebuked not only saw but God rebukes Samuel and the Lord said unto Samuel how long wilt thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel amen he said filled Einhorn with oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehem ight for ayah provided me a king among his sons amen so God had chosen another king over Israel he meant because of Saul's in complete obedience to the will of God amen brother grace to us God help us not to be guilty of in complete obedience not my will father dying be done a man constantly surrender to the will of God and the Word of God the will of God for for your life for your everyday living by the grace of God a man looking for another quote dear but we'll find it later a man so brother let's do God a service according to his will not without his will let's make sure that we're doing God a service here according to his will that our worship will be acceptable in his sight a man in his presence and left make sure when we go out the door that we're going we're going to do him service yeah oh yeah no I just do them service Church no no in your everyday living you're gonna do God a service you're not living for yourself you're living for him you're not you're not very witness of yourself you're witnessing in the life you live and now what you do and how you do it where do you do it when you do it you know into whom you do it you're doing your you're living doing it for the Lord they're doing it for the Lord alright let's make sure you're doing it according to the will of God and you become a revelation of the will of God to family friends neighbors whoever they are amen so that you're not doing what you're your own will you're doing the will of God and I tell you you're gonna live an odd life in the eyes of the world yeah why don't you do this once you do that well I'm just doing the will of God not my will father don't be done so on why don't you do this and do that no no I just whatever the will of God if God wants me to do it I'll do it it God wanted to go there I'll go there if you don't I want not sure what it is and okay where it is but it's the will of God sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God and the Spirit of God will lead you according to the will of God amen and it'll be the life of God in you amen and not just doctrine it'll be your attitude your your reactions what you do how you do it where you do it when you do it amen why is it oh well the world does it this way the world thinks this way the world they act this way but as a Christian you're totally different we're not of this world amen so how does at his believers in eternity act and think how does believers in eternity react God's grace to us brother again to repeat this just before we close we're in the end time and the Lord bless you richly and he said we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity and if we're fading into eternity what kind of life are we live what kind of life will we live not what we to live you you'll have that anointing on you so you automatically live it a lot of MAG to come out so let's make sure we got our calling election sure there's more sure we got the anointing of the Holy Ghost in us with us and around us now he said God is sovereign and we see here David Dunne in the scripture he said according to 1st chronicles 13 but Dodd God does not give us merits on good intentions davus intention was good to bring the Ark of the Covenant back but he said God didn't bless him for that because he didn't do it according to the will of God no he didn't just amazing because it was supposed to be on the priests shoulders not on a cart oh but it was a new cart so there was nothing else on the cart yeah but again God said don't don't put the cart don't put the the Ark of the Covenant on a cart ring like that it was under on the shoulders of the priesthood and they would put it on their shoulders and walk with it amen a we think all we won't do that cuz don't be a burden to them no that was the will of God hey Matt grace of course you know what happened and that God stopped it and it went on for so many months but then they went back but this time the priesthood went back and got it amen see there's only one way to serve God and that's by doing his will at his command doing his will that's only one way to please God and to serve God and he said God being sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it and there are believers that trying to tell God do this do this do this yeah they want God do this for them do this for they do this Lord know what's your will Lord whatever your will is I'll do it but we want to control God now they God control us and God being sovereign there's no one to tell them what to do or how to do it how does it eats and he knows the right way to do it and that makes me feel good it ought to make all of us feel good he said it sure does for one would have it coming in this way and one would have it going that way but he said one great thing again about God he has not left us now without knowing what's the truth and how to do it he wouldn't just be just to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how it was to going to be done and then let us stumble into something he's not that kind of a God he's a God that speaks a word and expects his children to believe it God spoke this word to saw Basalt did what was right in his own eyes God can speak his word to us and still we'll go out and do what's right in their own eyes no stay with the will of God and therefore he said he knows what's best and he knows when to do it he knows how to do it he said we have our ideas but he knows a man so god help us or brother-sister that we're not doing what's right in their own eyes and worship God in vain in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so I trust our worship is not in vain that's what the prophet of God brings that out in that in this message he says you can worship in pain if you're not doing what's right in his eyes they're not doing it his way according to his will and so on amen so we we've got to do it God's Way and according to God's will and it's not according to God's will he said your worship is in vain think of that how many are worshiping in vain in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men much of that is going on around the message oh yeah most definitely and remember he said God regulates the church there predestinated the bride to meet the season that they are living in so God is regulating us by the word they meant so that we're going to do his will not our will amen well we think whether it's going to be acceptable in God's sight because it's based on based on the message is based no you've still got to find the will of God and that and to do that you had to be led by the spirit by the grace of Almighty God amen god help us is my prayer as we go further into the message on doing God a service without his will the bride wants to do it according DS will not my world not what I want not what I think not what I'm hungry nor thirsty for brother no when it comes to the natural things of life no we don't want that we want the will of God according to the Word of God by the grace of God amen god bless you Lestat praise the Lord a man named man and amen praise the Lord let's sing stand up stand up for Jesus return to our brother mark Amen god bless you spear prayer as we continue on with the message I'm doing God a service without his will let's find the will of God give that message we had a reason for preaching that oh yeah and he there's a reason for God to have it printed there's a reason for God to have it recorded oh yeah some brother the prophet of God said he said you know he said God invented God did it was the one that permitted the invention of the tapes why he did because it was around the time of the prophet of God coming on the scene that the tapes were invented those being reel to reels yeah because that's the ones that I listened to many many many of them oh my there was several hundred of those big reel-to-reel tapes of the message over that we would put on and listen to the prophet of God preached then it went from there to the cassettes you know then he went from there to the the CDs and so on and now let's get down to a little a little machine I'll tell you this the bright is for the bright it's not for the world as he said we want we won't be able to get the message to everyone only the bright but the gospel is gonna be preached to all the world that's right and I believe I believe right now we're near i I've wondered I prayed I've talked to the Lord about it concern you how much time do we have left how much time do we have left Lord according to the prophecy this has happened this has happened this is coming to part pass this prophecy is coming to pass Lord how much more time and what what else do we have to see it there I think it's got to be a little worse than what we've seen so it's gonna be a little bit longer how much I don't know but I'll will maybe minister on that sometime because the Lord has been dealing with me on him concerning how much time we got left we'll we'll see exactly what it what has come to pass what is coming to pass them all will come to pass according to the prophecy amen so god help us is my prayer amen soliciting it stand up stand up for Jesus God
