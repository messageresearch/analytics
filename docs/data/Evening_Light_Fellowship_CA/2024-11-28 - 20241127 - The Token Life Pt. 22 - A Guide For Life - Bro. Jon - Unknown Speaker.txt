sunshine and warmth right now so and my mom's in Honolulu so anyways and here we are here we are praise the Lord anyhow right amen amen we want to remember brother Dale Walger he had a went to the doctor today and and they found that his cancer is a little more severe or more serious than they anticipated but you know I was thinking in the office that to God there's no difference between an eye infection and a Cancer and whatever else that we seem to be dealing with amen that he's the God of all he's the God of all healing he has full Authority and power over every sickness that comes against us every situation amen and so we believe in all situations amen that God is the god that heals our disease Jesus amen amen Psalms 25:5 David says Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do I wait all the day and then John 16:13 we've read this before but he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and I want to take just one service on a thought here as we continue our series on the Holy Ghost and I want to take a a title this evening of a guide for life amen and it's it's funny how technology has changed so many things well for most of us it didn't change much for brother Dale but uh you know when Blanc and I first moved to Texas they didn't really have GPS's back then what they had was Map Quest and so when we moved to Texas the first time we were poor students and and so we went to map and we printed out the instructions from St John's newfinland all the way to Fort Worth Texas and it was a big package of paper with all the step-by-step instructions there and of course today we don't do that except unless your brother Dale when you moved from Alberta and he just took a map and went with it and we did have a map just in case things went sideways amen but we were poor students we couldn't really afford a GPS but we had a destination in mind and we looked it up and we got all of the the things that that we needed and we trusted what we had and we set out on the road and guess what we got to Dallas Fort Worth without any issue and of course we we went there a second time uh once I graduated and to live there for quite some time but but uh there we had to do the same thing and we printed it out but once we got there and actually got a little bit of money it's a massive City eight or Metroplex 8 million people takes you over an hour to drive east to west and north to south there I mean it's it's absolutely massive and so we bought a GPS to go in our car because we had so many new places to go and so many new homes H to go to and and driving to work and driving here and going to church and visiting this believer and that believer and so we didn't have cell phones back then this was early 2000s you had a cell phone but they didn't have GPS capability they were expensive but we spent our money on a on a GPS and and we paid a lot of money for that thing I I think it was about $300 we probably paid back then for something like that but it completely changed our lives because now we didn't have to worry about how to get somewhere we didn't have to worry about what happens if we took a wrong turn cuz it could correct us as we went but the other thing we learned is that a GPS is not an absolute and and even today we find that even with your cell phones with it built in it could give us wrong directions it could tell us to make a turn where there was no turn it would take us down a road that wasn't really a road it would it would give us instructions that we weren't able to comply with it tell you to take a turn and you're on a freeway up in the air and there's no way you can turn you know unless you decide to go through the side of the the concrete barriers that were there amen it didn't often happen but it happened often enough that we learned that if we were going to go somewhere we needed to look before we went to make sure that when we're on the way we could recognize trouble if it was coming our way and like I said even today you know as good as cell phones are and Google Maps and and and and Google Street View and all these different things you can you can see these things but it sometimes messes these things up amen and it can lead you astray and you know I remember this when it was in the news how a a Canadian woman in Ontario followed her GPS right into the lake now you would think as the water was coming up that something in her would have said stop stop stop this isn't right but she blindly followed the directions she she had so committed her trust to her GPS and her phone that she followed it all the way into complete destruction of her vehicle and put her life in Peril now you think that's insane but yet it's amazing how what happens when people don't look where they're going and instead trusting something else that it's like they completely abdicate their ability to to think for themselves you know it's even gotten to the point I found this one and if you look on the bottom of its sign it says your GPS is wrong because what happens is so many people were making the same mistake and taking the wrong road to nowhere that they put up a sign saying don't follow your GPS the real route that you're looking for is along this path so many people go along that way and what is it it's the problem is that that people haven't looked to see where they're going and then compared what the directions are to where they're supposed to be going now that's pretty much a sermon in itself isn't it that you aren't looking where you're you're you're trusting so completely that you're focused on where you're at rather than where your directions are taking you if I'm going to cross new Fin and try and go to the West Coast if I'm driving for 3 hours and my compass hasn't turned West yet there's a problem because if I want to go to the West eventually the compass has to start pointing to a Westerly Direction so I know that I'm on the wrong road if I never go west and that's the way we ought to be able to look at life no matter what goal we have where we're trying to get what we're trying to achieve we ought to see something along the way that tells us we're on the right path that there's there are signs along the way there are there's feedback along the way that tells us you're going to get there that you're on the right path and you're going to get where you're going amen if we're trying to retire with a a million or $2 million doar at the end of of our working life amen and we're 10 years into our journey to retirement and all we have is bills bills bills and big vacations and big mortgages and big car payments and these things something in US ought to say you're not on the road to retiring with a million why because the road to retirement is filled with savings and rsps and Investments not just fun and games it's got simple living along the way it's living within your means these are all along the path to retiring with what you need at the end of your journey but we have people whether it's our parents who might be fiscally responsible maybe a good friend or we we pay or have a financial advisor that tell us how to get to that million dollar or multi-million dollar retirement why because some of them are there and some of them have been trained to get other people there but we put our trust in our in our finishing where our goal is in that person because they've either been there before or they know how to get there because they've taken specialized training we're trusting that they can do what we can't do in ourselves amen you know when we go moose hunting by God's grace I'll leave Sunday to go moose hunting for a week in central Newland when we go there brother Nelson guy Jr takes us around and he's a professional guide amen he's a moose Hunter himself and so more than that he knows not just moose but he knows the area where the Moose are he doesn't get lost he can't get lost because he spent so much time in the woods there that he knows every Bush every I'm I'm I'm exaggerating slightly but he knows where everything is and what happens he knows if he goes in a certain direction he'll hit a landmark he knows and then he'll know where he is absolutely based on that amen so he knows every nook and cranny he knows where where the Moose are he knows where they like to travel and what times of day and what times of the Season he he knows what they like to eat he knows the signs that moose have been there all these things the first time I went out with him he's gone and he's following a moose and I haven't seen a track I haven't seen anything and then he'll point out a shrub where it just nipped off the top of an elder and he say see it's still green it's still wet he was just here maybe within the last couple of hours I don't see anything why he's a guide he knows what he's doing the first moose I ever got I would have walked right by her but Nelson stopped me and he says she's right there go shoot shoot shoot and I'm looking he's saying see her hump right there and she was laying down behind a hump of grass and all that was showing was about this much of a brown hump of their back wouldn't have seen her but he had known for quite some time she was close I didn't know anything but as a guide he knew she was close and so he was looking for her and he saw her I didn't know she was so close I wasn't looking for her I would have probably missed her until she thundered up and scared the the ti out of me because I hadn't seen her in the first place amen every year we've gone out by God's grace we've gotten our moose why we have a guide we have somebody that knows what he's doing amen by God's grace amen and so now when we go out last year when I went out brother Nelson wasn't there he wasn't available because of his knee surgery but I had to go out by myself and get my own moose but I've learned enough from somebody that knows what they're doing and what they're talking about and he show me around enough that I have a general idea that I'm somewhat capable now I'm nowhere near what he is but I can do the job based on what I've learned from him by setting aside what I thought I knew and sitting down and shutting up and letting him teach me I'm now able to potentially do what he does for me amen but I want you to catch this thought amen because a guide has to be somebody that actually knows what they're doing and where they're going brother says this way and this is a long quote but it we we're only going to get through the first line he says you have to have a guide when you don't know where you're going and maybe I can add to it if you'll if you'll allow me this evening you have to have a guide when you don't know what you're doing amen when you don't know what's going on that's why you need a guide amen if we come back to our original scripture we opened up with David said Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation and on thee do I wait all the day we're preaching on a guide for life tonight and we have to realize that we can't be the guide there's no point in having a guide if I'm going to lead the point of having the guide is so that he takes me where I need to go and he keeps me safe while he's doing it anden if I'm trying to show him what I know if I'm trying to show him what I'm capable of doing then guess what the guide is of no help I've watched a ton of uh of hunting videos I love to to learn and and see what other people do and how they they they do these different things and one thing I've noticed is that most guides aren't pushy they'll they they'll try and help you but if you don't let them help you know what they do they step back and you know what else happens you're unsuccessful usually or you get hurt or you do something but when they'll let when you'll let the guide be what he's supposed to be for you let him do what you're paying him to do usually you're successful and you're safe in your success Africa's the the king of big Gabe hunting dangerous big game hunting and I can't tell you how many times I've seen where they they they've shot an animal or they're about to shoot one that's very dangerous and the the hunter is about to fire but you've got a guide that's backing him up with an even bigger gun and it's usually got two bullets it's got two barrels and and two bullets ready to go and that man the hunter the the the woman fires and when they fire if that animal does not go down or starts to charge then what does the guy do he takes the animal down why he's there to protect the person that he's with but now if you're all in his way and trying to do your own thing then what happens you're going to get trampled you're going to get run over because you're not letting the the the guy do what he's supposed to do Amen in this life we've got to realize our ways are death it it's that simple our ways lead to destruction amen everything that's in our nature as a human being is destructive amen our Innovations are even Dead Brother Braham says we we go to war and we kill people with our weapons and then we come back and in a time of Peace we kill more people with our Innovation than we did in the war everything we do has a way of coming around and biting us if you've noticed scripture says in Proverbs says there is a way which seeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death does God know how to turn a phrase or what he says you can think one way is good and he says in the end this is multiple ways of how to die it it it always leads to to bad things for our lives amen the greatest fa failing we have in the world today is that people think things are right and they act on them and it's nothing to do with the word of God Amen they come up with an idea these days rarely with experience or understanding but because it seems good to them or because they think a good person agrees with them or is on the project with them they go ahead and they do it and what do they lead us to destruction every single time amen why because they think it's good it must be good but it's not but God comes along he says every way which you think if you're an unregenerated person every idea you come up with leads to death that's the absolute of the scripture amen every plan every thought every Doctrine whatever it might be we might have the greatest and the best of intentions yet God says it leads to death you see what happened after God gave the law to Moses 613 laws and what did they do they added to it they added to it and what did it do it led them into dead religion so that when the word finally came they couldn't recognize it amen but everything we come up with it has a way of biting Us in the end brother BR puts it this way he says every man that's unregenerated of God will go that way of Destruction he says you can't help it your own soul guides you until there is the the the leadership of the Holy Spirit the Seal of the holy spirit in our soul it we can't help help it we can't help it he says if you are born again you're bound to go up if you're not born again you've got to go down amen that's a horrible thing to think if you're not regenerated amen but if you are it's a wonderful thing to know watch what he says here he says Jesus talking to this Mighty ruler who did not understand and he was giving the Old Testament a scriptural proof of what he was talking about he said Jesus was very fundamental in his Doctrine it's amazing Jesus quotes the the Old Testament constantly when he's preaching why because the word always points to the word amen he says but it was against their Theology of that Doctrine Jesus is giving them the truth of the doctrine but they had developed a Theology of that Doctrine they're both preaching from the same book but one of them has added his thoughts to it and the other one is the thoughts of it and what happens is you get a clash and what happens is somebody has to back down and so what happens is what they push Jesus away and they go on to destruction he says although in their theology they were very Orthodox they believed and were very much of Believers in what they did believe but they didn't have it the truth the scripture says there's a way that seeth right into a man it may seem every bit right but the end thereof are the ways of death and he says these words so we must be sure that we're right he says God knew in all ages that whether it was right or wrong he Vindicated and he proved it amen so the reason we need a guide is because we recognize we don't have the answers we don't know where we're going we don't know the way and we need someone to help us that's the only reason I ever need a guide is I me one or all of those conditions amen that's not that that's the starting place that it that it comes to to bringing a guide into your life is you have to recognize personally and individually I can't get where I need to go go on my own I don't have the knowledge I don't have this experience remember what what God Said to Joshua they had to put the word in front of them he says you have not been this way before so something else has to lead the way to make sure you don't stumble and fall and die by the wayside amen so this has to be a personal revelation to us as individuals that we need a guide because we don't know what we're doing and we don't know how to get there now watch what brother Bram says we're going to preach a lot out of the message a Guide tonight he says now a guide has to know the way what goods a guide that doesn't know the way he says he has to know where he's going and what he's doing and catch this and how to take care of you along the road he's got to see that you don't come up lost the guide has to sign your license to the game warden he has to sign himself in and he's responsible for you if anything happens to you it's his responsibility he's got to take care of you he's got to see that you're not lost he's got to be sure that he doesn't send you in somewhere that you don't know your way back and if you do get lost he's got to know the country so well that he can pick you up just any time he's got to know all these things or he cannot be licensed to be a guide you know I love that idea of the guide's the one that takes responsibility because that takes the pressure off me to try and be what I'm not he's taking the responsibility that's what I'm paying him for is to take the responsibility from my shoulders and put it on him because he's proven to know what he's doing you know when I was in management the way I always handled things was if my team made a mistake it was my mistake but if my team did something good it was the individuals and that's how you grow people and that's how you get people to buy in is that you when they they make a mistake you make it your mistake and when they do well then you make it theirs and what I found is when I did that is that one it kept you humble and two it allowed people to see that you were weren't just in it for yourself you were in it for them and the idea was that we had enough wins and enough good things coming through that when we inevitably made a mistake we had enough credit build up on all the good things that we' done that the bad things didn't matter quite so much but when I finally left management and came here and started working in New Finland it was such a sigh of relief in so many ways because now I'm only responsible for myself I'm as good as I want to be or I'm as bad as I am there's really not much I can do about it but I don't have to answer for anybody else I don't have to be looking over everybody's shoulder I don't have to be keeping things up to date and jumping and filling gaps and and bridging bridging things and all these different things amen because the buck stops with you and it's not a lot of fun even though the pays better it's not a whole lot of fun and so it was a relief to set that burden down but I guess the jokes on me because then he made me a pastor but here's the thing church I am not the guide that's the thing as I stepped into a different role and yes there's responsibilities with it amen but it's not the same because if there's one thing it's I know it's that I cannot be your guide amen I can't Le myself I need a guide which means I can't be your guide amen the holy spirit is the great Shepherd of the church that was what they fell away from in the Ephesian Church age was they lost their First Love and they tried to make men their guides I'm here to tell you I am not your guide if you're looking to me you've missed the mark But if I can surrender in humility and let the great Shepherd use me then we've got a Fighting Chance because he's ordained pastors to lead the flock but they have to be Pastors in subjection themselves not so puffed up that they can't be led by the holy spirit amen that was David's prayer David's prayer was God Lead Me In Your Truth and teach me your way that's the truth that makes a difference that's real truth that's life-changing truth amen that's proper leadership that's the kind of truth that will redeem us back to our original condition is his kind of Truth amen so when God gives us something and he teaches us and he leads us we ought to be able to use that the next time that situation comes around the first time's always the hardest but once we've learned something we ought to be able to say I've been here before and here's what I do listen the first time you commit your finances into the hands of God ought to be the last time you need to really think about it the first time he proves it is the last time he needs to prove it because if he proved it once he'll keep proving it over and over and over again amen whether it's your health whether it's your marriage whether it's your kids what the ministry whatever it might be once we've learned that God does what his word says we ought to be able to keep going in that path and never have to wonderer again we ought to be able to reply it to apply it amen remember what the scripture says we've read it so many times now he says he would bring things to our remembrance amen he'd remind us once he's taught us he'll remind you hey remember we've already been here oh it looks different but the principle of the word is the same just take that and move forward and you're going to be okay that's what he's trying to do amen you know somebody said to me after service not too long ago they said brother John I've heard that all my life but tonight it finally clicked see there's a difference between knowing and experiencing there's a difference between knowing and applying that knowledge amen and what happened is it's one thing to know truth but he said that he would lead us into all truth that's an experience of it not just a head knowledge of it amen that's what we read in our opening scripture he said he will guide you into all truth that's the defining action of the holy spirit is he takes you into all truth he does doesn't just do it for you but he does it to you he makes it a part of you he takes you from no truth or maybe partial truth into all truth that's the working of the holy spirit amen now there's a beautiful diagram that we use to explain something like this it's called a ven diagram and it shows and we use it to show things that are in common and where things intersect and I thought it'd be an easy way to show how this is supposed to look this evening and this is by no means exhaustive but it's just a few things that the Lord laid on my heart heart so if we look in this we've got us and we've got all truth and the goal is to bring those two into the same Circle amen and if we look at this we all start out and it doesn't matter if we're raised in the message raised in a Christian Home raised with believing parents or if we're born to a uh a a drug using alcohol drinking family of atheists it doesn't matter every single one of us starts out this way we are lost amen that's the way we start we are children of Disobedience by our human nature we are separated from God we're dead in religion we might be in a denomination or we might be in our own religion which is we're relying on self either way it's a dead religion amen and we are carnal our our nature is carnal because we're unregenerated and we are a slave to the emotions and the feelings and the thoughts and the carnality of this body amen that's where we start and there look there is none better and there's none worse in God's eyes here every single one of us starts this way so it doesn't matter tonight if your kids are out in the world or if they're in church if they are not filled with the Holy Spirit they look exactly the same to God there is no difference and the work is no more difficult or easy for God for one or the other it requires all of us to go through this particular path now remember Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would guide us into all truth because we I want to stop and talk about that for a second because we've got to realize that it doesn't say he will lead us to all truth and it doesn't say he will lead us around all truth he says I will lead lead you into all truth and mean you can sit around the truth you can sit around True Believers Holy Ghost filled people all your days and it won't do you a lick of good unless you get into all truth the way that they are amen it's got to be a personal thing Amen in other words he's saying you will Unite with all truth you will be a part of all truth you'll be filled with all truth it's a reality not just a knowledge this is not Doctrine though Doctrine is a part of it this is a living experience amen I can have a lot of of knowledge and never really know what I'm talking about absolutely true amen I went to to school to to be an engineer and I graduated by answering a lot of very difficult questions on a lot of very difficult tests but that is not what made me an engineer what made me an engineer is when I took all those answers and all of that knowledge and I started to use it to design and build things that worked listen you can be somebody that designs a lot of things but if they don't work you're not much of an engineer but when I could practically apply those things and and and produce things that were intended by my employer now that's when I became an engineer and so we've got to be in it it can't just be around us and we can't just be around it it's got to be a transformation amen so what is we' we've looked and we've seen what all what what you are but what is all truth what's the difference between you and all truth we know that truth is one thing and one thing alone and that means it's God's word that's the only thing that truth is What God Says is truth and everything else is a lie unless it agrees with the word of God Jesus said this he said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so when he says I'm going to guide you into all truth what's he talking about I'm going to guide you into all of the word but not all of the word but all of the word that applies to you because listen Noah's message does us no good it's all applicable to us for learning for correction for guidance in these things but the the the into all truth part is that he's taking you into the word that applies to you the word for your day amen we're not trying to throw scriptures away but there's a portion that is that is meant for a particular group of people throughout the scriptures amen so we can look at both of these things in a single scripture and in revelation 22 this is almost the end of the Bible it says if any man shall take away from the works of from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book you know there's an interesting Doctrine that's floating around these days not within the message but in the nominal Christian world and they're taking the Book of James and they're saying this book is not a part of the Gospel it belongs in the Old Testament because James focused on works that's what they say and works is under the law we're under grace amen and they say well we're not doing away with it we're just saying it doesn't belong under the New Covenant it doesn't belong in the New Testament amen but when you do that you make it of no effect because God placed it in the New Covenant in the New Testament and you're sitting here saying I know better this doesn't apply why did James have to write James is a really rough book James said show me your faith by your works why because there was people in those days that had accepted all the grace but they didn't realize or they didn't come to the reality that there was power behind that Grace to make you live then do certain things inside of your life and James said if you're just sitting on the couch with your grace that's not what God gave it to you for so what is it they have to take it with the entire gospel because if you just take some of the things Paul said you'll end up sitting on your couch doing nothing as well because it's all Grace it's all Grace it's all Grace I can't get myself into Heaven by my Works they don't add to they don't take away anything but they do and we'll see that in scriptures in a moment amen but it's all in Balance the entire word is imbalance so if you'll take the entire word it'll keep you in Balance but what happens is when people don't like a portion of it they say this doesn't apply to me and what do they do they lose the balance of the word and the guide doesn't work anymore because now they're going to the right or to the left based on what they feel in themselves amen but we see here in the scripture we cannot add one word and we cannot take one word away we can't do anything it is an absolute it's unchanging it's for our admonition it's for our correction Repro encouragement teaching and it's all in balance if we'll take it all it does a perfect work amen but notice there it says God shall take away his part from the things which are written in this book God says I'll take away your part the person that adds to or takes away from the word will lose his part he'll lose what's written for him he'll lose the potential blessing amen if you look at what was written for our age in leoda in Revelations 3 there's a word that's written to us and if we take away from it or we add to it what happens is we make the word of no effect and we don't get the blessing of it we don't get the correction of it we don't get the Overcomer gift of it amen we don't get anything from it when we add or take away we change it and it has no power anymore and so you can't get the benefit of it amen now we know that if you're a child of God you can't be lost that's quite a statement but we believe that amen Jesus said all that the father have given I won't lose one amen it's impossible for us to be l why because we're a part of Christ we're a part of the word we were there in the beginning we've got to be there but one thing's for sure that even as a child of God we can walk a hard path of our own making amen there's a rough way that we can go amen and what happens is when we decide to go our way what does God let us do he lets us go for a while so we can see how it how it works out and we when we get good and sick and tired of doing things our way God just brings the word right around and says now you can make the choice and if we turn it away then we just keep going around and around the mountain in the desert and until we finally do it God's way amen but what does he do he's waiting for the holy he's he's he's waiting for us to let the Holy Spirit Quicken that word to us amen and because of this some people will come to God empty-handed in the end children of God will come to God empty-handed In the End Amen everything that they did in their life their works the way they spent their time their effort their money whatever it might be might not stand up to God's scrutiny it may not be an eternal blessing that's what I mean when I say empty-handed Paul talks about it in first Corin Corinthians he says for other Foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ amen the rock the Cornerstone that the church is built on is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen it's not Peter it's not a pope it's not some church amen Christ is the the Cornerstone he's the stone that the builders rejected amen that is what we read last service and he says now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay and stubble now you look at that that's quite a list you put gold you put silver precious stones and and those things are going to hold up pretty good they're hard they're they're difficult to break up wood in theory can be very strong hay not exactly known for its structural properties and stubble is just hay that's left over in the ground that's even worse so there's a bunch of things we can build on there and those are by our own choosing and he says every man's work shall be made manifest in other words it'll be clear what it was built how it was built for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is I don't get to test my Works God tests it God gets to say if it's good or bad if it passes the test or if it fails the test he always judges by his word so that means I don't get to say it's right or wrong good or bad he gets to say it amen he says if any man's work abide which he ha built there upon upon he shall receive a reward so there are some that are going to stick but in the Amplified says but if any person's work is burned up by the testing of God he will suffer the loss of his reward yet he himself shall be saved but only as one who has barely escaped through fire so what do you lose potentially you lose your reward you lose the Eternal goodness of your works because they were not Eternal they were not of God Amen and so you end up in coming to your lord and savior and your empty-handed net there's nothing there there's nothing of Eternal value for me the only thing that's of Eternal value is a soul that's just me that means you got you brought nobody with you you lived a life for yourself in some form or fashion that's a sad place to be but he says there's going to be some that do it but he says you won't lose your life you won't lose your eternal life you won't lose your your your salvation or anything like that but you come in and you come in and empty-handed but when we look at what's written in the Book of Revelation we see that it's the whole Plan of Redemption from start to finish it's Christ from start to finish it's the whole Plan of Redemption amen even in John writing there he says if you change one thing if you add anything to this Redemption story or you take anything out you lose your part that God allowed for you but if he says that if you add or take anything away then it must be also true of the opposite that if you don't change anything then you would get it amen it it ought to be a blessing if we'll keep every part of it it ought to have the effect it's supposed to if we'll believe every bit of it and if we look in revelation 22 a bit earlier he says behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the says of the prophecy of this book and down to 12 it says and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last he says blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city so there's a people prepared to take God at his full word amen and those people are the ones that have a right to the Tree of Life to eternal life amen and they won't pull away they won't shrink back they won't stop amen they'll go all the way with the word of God Amen but we see where we started was outside of the word in our na in our nature in our flesh amen so we're outside of all truth it's just me it's just you and we're standing there in our lost condition in these things but what does all truth look like to us what does it mean to us as a child of God what does the Holy Spirit do when it's guiding us into all truth it's a simple answer it shows us who we are in the word of God and by the word of God it reveals Jesus Christ that shows our relationship to Jesus Christ and then it guides us into the full and complete reality of what the word says about us and so I did it this way amen so now when you see all truth then now it's not that you're lost it's that you're found it's that you're no longer a child of Disobedience amen you're a Child of Light now you're not separated from God but you're redeemed to God now you're not dead in religion but you're alive in Christ now you're not a carnal creature but you're a spiritual creature and you're no longer a slave but you're a son or a daughter of God that's what all truth shows you amen that's what the word says about you amen it's a complete it's a complete flip of what Satan tried to tell you R puts it this way he says the holy spirit always speaks of the word he says I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason for the coming of the seals he makes some amazing statements here he says at the finishing of the seven seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what is the opening of the seals the opening of the word it's bringing all truth back to our remembrance amen remember it was sealed to Daniel Paul had it all but there was a falling away and so John had to seal it up but as Christ comes back and he comes back to this last age and those seven seals are open what is he doing he's saying all truth is here again and when you have all truth you get the effect of all truth so he says under those seals now we should know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being why because we are becoming as he is we don't just know it by knowledge but we know it by experience and he confirms it he says you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time see to bring us into the full stature of Sons and Daughters of God a church that's walk in the blood of Christ that's bought without money is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ so the opening of the word the opening of those seals was to completely open the door to full Redemption so that the word could become flesh once again he says I am Alpha and Omega I'm the beginning and the end it was Christ in the first church and then it's Christ in the last church it's the full revealing of the word inside of us all over again amen so we have had two extremes that are shown here amen we could say so on the left we have you and I I added those two headings at the bottom where we are our nature is death amen it's the ways of death it's destruction but all truth is eternal life amen it's going back to God so that's what we have here the TR this is the most serious transformation that can occur this is literally life and death It's All or Nothing there's no halfway there's no partial it has to be be everything or it does you no good amen God is coming for a bride that is completely living by his word and you say how are we going to make that how are we going to get from Death to eternal life how are we going to have a complete change of way the way we look at ourselves the way we live the way we think the entire world has every gun pointed at keeping us from making those decisions from walking on that road into eternal life amen and there's only one thing that's going to get us there what is it God rich in mercy God rich in Mercy Church my discipline will not hold up to what Satan has ready for me it will not work my strength my courage whatever we might call it yours won't either I'm sorry to say it is God rich in Mercy that's going to take us from where we are where we were to where we need to be amen it's by Revelation that he's going to do it remember script says God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy there's an elect people that's already set up to receive his mercy and Grace amen and God always does it by opening Our Eyes by way of Revelation that's how Abel got it by Faith by a revelation of the will of God Abel gave a more perfect sacrifice Abraham Abraham sitting around living the life as everybody else's in God sovereignly comes down and reveals himself to to Abraham and takes him him out and everybody else gets left behind what is it it's the mercy and grace of God by The Sovereign choosing of God to the individual that's the only way he works but he always does it by sending his word amen he gives him his word we can read it we can study it we can hear it that's good don't stop doing it but until God opens our eyes we're not going anywhere that's just the way it works that's what the new birth is is when he opens your eyes to the word and you receive it and you to live in it amen that's the sovereignty of God remember what Jesus said he says you hear me because you are my sheep my sheep hear my voice that's why we can do it you can go a long time without hearing that voice but when you finally hear it when your eyes are open when your ears are open and you recognize who it is that's talking you'll never follow another voice in your life hey I'm not saying we don't make mistakes I'm not saying we don't get led to the left and right sometimes in these different things but in the end you'll always come back to that voice because that voice is what you're tuned to hear and to follow in your life Amen brother B says this he says now there's a way that God comes and that's the only way that you're ever going to get in there is come the way that God provided for you that's right he says the whole Bible is built completely upon Revelation the church is built on Revelation the revelation of the word so what happens is now is your eyes of understanding being open your soul being sealed by the Holy Spirit there's a transformation that's going on and it's bringing you into the word now realize this there's going to be conflict and the other thing is this there's only going to be one Survivor between you and all truth there's only going to be one Survivor now I'm here to give you the good news the good news is you don't survive all truth is the one that lives through this I have to die out you have to die out but that's the best news you can have is that this gets to go away and it's replaced with something else amen what happens is we move truth stays we're the one that has to pull away from where we are because truth is the absolute that is the unchanging part that is the unmoving part I've got to change I've got to surrender I've got to humble myself I've got to give up my thinking I've got to give up my emotions I've got to do the changing I've got to do the repenting because I'm the one that's outside of the absolute so to go in there I'm the one that has to change my course and my thinking and my inspiration I'm the one that's got to Di out so what happens now as we're guided into all truth is that the Heritage and the lies and the failures and the sins that we were born under start to fade away and you start to realize certain things and so what happens is we start to make this move and the first thing you find out is that once I was lost but now I'm found Hallelujah isn't that the first thing I remember so vividly the night I gave my heart to the Lord that I realized I am no longer lost I've been found my life has been ever more changed I'm in the place where I need to be now amen so the first thing is you realize you're lost but now you've been found then after that you realize then I can't be a child that's lost I've got to be a different child so I'm no longer a child of Disobedience but I'm a Child of Light and that comes with certain privileges that comes with a tutor that comes with authority that comes with expectations that comes with blessings and as you start to see the benefits of those things the Holy Spirit can lead you forward amen and so you realize now that you're not separated from God but rather you're redeemed to God and you have access to his presence and the Throne of mercy and Grace that you can have an audience with him anytime that you need it amen and then you realize that because you're a you're redeemed back to God you're in a process that's doing something inside of your life amen and it's bringing you from your condition into your original position and what that does is it takes you out of your dead religion and it makes you alive in Christ amen where there's a whole new life that's springing up within you there's something in your soul that's overcoming what's in these flesh and and our spirit realm and these different things amen it takes you out of the traditions of your family listen it's good to be raised in message tradition but they'll take you to hell if you don't have the Holy Ghost it'll turn into a law it'll turn into legalism you'll have a judgmental attitude but when you get the Holy Spirit it'll turn it into a work of of Love it'll turn it into relationship because here's one thing I know is that when you turn it into legalism you can never do it all and you'll condemn yourself eventually you'll condemn yourself eventually but notice What's Happening Here clashes are inevitable as I said something's got to give and what's happening is what Satan says about me or what people say about me or what I was born with starts to die out as the word starts to take effect by the quickening power of the Holy Spirit and I start to realize something I'm not who I thought I was and that brings a massive change in my life amen what is it I'm being lost to my own self and I'm being found in Christ I'm finding my identity in the word and what happens as you see as you become smaller and smaller and all truth absorbs everything that we are so what's next these are not in a particular order these are just the things the Lord laid on my heart to say tonight amen so they're not in an order but when when when religion drops away then what happens is you come into what spiritual maturity and you start to grow you're in a love relationship amen because the word is living through you and it's changed your desires amen and then the last thing is that you go and you're now no longer a slave but you're a son and you're a daughter of God and you recognize I'm not to be bound I don't have to bow down I don't have to let these things get the victory over me but I can stay in the the house I can dwell in the presence of God every single day of my life and have overcoming Victory and Power in every circumstance amen this is the last great revelation of the church is who she is brother Bram says when she recognizes who she is the rapture will go it's the last great one I was talking brother Garfield called me this afternoon we had a a wonderful chat about some of the things I've been preaching and some things he's been studying and and I and I I I relayed this idea because when we can see what he's trying to do it sets an expectation in our hearts for him to do it anden so that's why we read the word that's why we hear the word that's why the anointed word comes forth is it raises our sights to what God has in store for us that's what the holy spirit is doing is he's showing you things to come so that you'll believe for them so that you can see and receive what he has told you is going to come like I said before what's the point of telling us what's coming if he never comes he's there to take us into the truth of what he's shown us to come but look at this now we so close to the end here you is pretty much gone here it's almost completely all truth there's just a little sliver of you left but if you look on the bottom we've still got something that has to be resolved amen we're so close here if we were to look in the scripture we'd say that we're into the time of the quick short work it's 30 to 40 days left it's Christ now revealed through his bride and there's that quick short work of the de demonstration of the full power and authority of Christ and his bride but there's still one battle that has to be fought there's still one thing that has to be put under subjection and Paul talked about this in First Corinthians he says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed notice it says last Trump that means there's been other trumpets before but this one is a resurrection and Rapture Trump amen he says for this corruptible must put on incorruption we saw that little sliver that was left what is it it's the carnal nature it's the flesh for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so that when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is written death is swallowed up in vict ictory he says oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory see he's saying that because he's received eternal life by the Holy Spirit but this is a prophecy to the day when our faith shall be made sight where this in this corruptible puts on incorruption and we have a perfect body again he says the thing of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen there's just one thing that's left at the end of this journey church and it is all truth then we look here and what happens death is swallowed up in Victory Eternal Light see remember death is just a shadow eternal light is the light life is the light and so you can't have Darkness and light at the same time and so what happens is when that Holy Ghost it completely changes our body what does it do it swallows up death what go what happens to darkness when light comes it doesn't go away it ceases to exist it has no power it it's not even there anymore it literally is destroyed by light amen that's what he's saying it's swallowed up in Victory eternal life triumphs over flesh over the grave over death over hell and we're caught up in to the marriage supper of the Lamb that's what he's trying to do amen Church we're not Christians when we know the message we're Christians when we are the message that's what the holy spirit is doing is he's not revealing just head knowledge but he's trying to get us to the place where we have a living reality of the word in our lives and that's what the holy spirit's meant to do is to make it real in our lives that's why we're preaching this amen this church is going to be this I mean the bride of Christ not this church person Al or specifically we're the last Light we're the last witness we're the last revealing of Christ that's it when it's done we're gone and all that's left is Judgment amen Christ has returned in the form of the Holy Spirit brother Braham said to guide us into the living realities of the word of God that's what he's here to do to make it a reality Amen to take us all the way back to our conditions our original conditions you know when I was studying on this I thought about what a privilege we have you notice the world is talking a lot about privilege these days you want to talk about privilege God help them if they ever figure out what we believe because we are the most privileged people on this Earth we have eternal life we have an inheritance Incorruptible we have a city not made with hands We Rule and reign with Christ and we didn't choose it we didn't deserve it we can't earn it and we had nothing to do with it you talk about privilege you are the most privileged people in this world Amen by the unmar Grace favor and predestination of God Amen so what's our requirement then let the guide be the guide that's it's that simple let the guide be the guide let God be God and let him do what he's supposed to do surrender our thoughts surrender our opinions surrender our preferences surrender our Comforts to the direction and leading of the Holy Spirit and he'll take us all the way into our final destination Amen brother BR puts it this way he says the guide has understanding how to go and what to do God has always sent a guide to his people God has never failed he sends a guide but you've got to accept that guide see what does that look like he says you've got to believe it but you've got to and you've got to go the way he says if you get into a Wilderness and your guide says we go this way and yet you think you go that way you're going to come up lost God sends us a guide to guide us but we've got to follow that guide no matter what we think what looks reasonable what looks ridiculous we're not subjects to divide that the guide is the only one had a person call me up a while ago about some things they were dealing with not in this church and they gone to a minister and that Minister has a particular gift and using that gift he told them what they needed to do to come through their situation and this person did that for 3 days and then what happened is they doubted what he said and so they went and they did what anybody else would have done why because they weren't convinced of the guide they weren't convinced that what they said made sense and so what happened is they backed away because they thought their way was better and what they did is what anybody in the world would have done unfortunately brother B says this he says don't never dispute your gu's word follow him if you don't you come up lost he says and remember when you leave him you're on your own he says so we want to keep close to the guide so when this person talked to me it had been some months since this had happened and everything was in shambles and they said as much and they they tried to blame the minister and I said but you didn't do what he told you to do you did it for 3 days and then you went and you did exactly what he told you not to do and now you're getting exactly what you would expect I said how can that be his fault if you didn't do if you didn't do what he told you to do you're on your own you walked away your life LED you to this mistake now somebody who has a gift tells you how to get out of it by the Holy Spirit and you say I'm going to keep doing according to my own thoughts it's never going to work your own thoughts got you into it they're never going to get you out that's the problem see we we're we're so silly sometimes we think that we somehow have gained something more than we have before but that what we had got us into the problem in the first place we're not going to get ourselves out by thinking we need a guide to get us out of those things amen what is it our ways of thinking are the ways of death they're destructive amen Jesus put or brother BR puts it this way he says when Jesus was here on Earth don't you remember Jesus said to the Pharisees you blind guides blind guides blind to spiritual things see now they were supposed to be guides to the people guiding the people to salvation but Jesus said you're blind and he said let them alone for if the blind lead the blind won't they both fall in the ditch blind guides he says oh how the world has been contaminated with that blind guiding don't we see it today what we see today is literally the effect of blind guides everything that's in this world the shambles that we have the the economics the politics the social structure all these different things the failures of men are on the basis of blind guides and it's not because they weren't trying to do right it's not because they weren't sincere some of them were self-serving yes but I believe there was many good men and women out there that have tried to lead and what did they do they've led us into destruction amen they led us into destruction he says he doesn't want you to rely on your own understanding God does not want you to rely on your understanding or your thoughts or any manmade thoughts that person I'm talking about's in a world of trouble today because they backed away from the guide that was given them and what is it they kept walking in the way of their own understanding and unless God steps in again they'll pay a heavy price for it there's a price to be paid brother BR says when you leave him you're on your own amen you may not you'll not lose your soul but there's a price that's going to be paid amen but I want to close on a I don't like to close on a negative note but as I was studying this you know we're talking about leading us into all truth leading us into the realities of the word lead us into eternal life and you know I I thought as I was thinkinking on this idea of a guide for life that we showed that last bit that great Victory is when death is swallowed up amen by eternal life and it reminded me of the Rapture scripture that brother brandham read and it never struck me one element of it until I was studying this but let's read it as we close this evening he says this the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident you know what I was sitting in the Audi in the the office there I was thinking of Pilgrim's Progress and Christian comes up to a place remember and he can see the Lions waiting for him and yet he knows he's on the path to the celestial City but there's two lions that are there and they're roaring and they're reaching out and they're doing all this but the path that he has to go through leads to those lions and remember he stops and he waits and he's ready to back away and then a voice from the city says walk in the middle of the road they can't touch you as long as you stay in the road and what happened is they were chained there to cause fear but they had no right or access to the pilgrim walking the way of God Amen that's what David's talking about you can go through hard times and it looks like something's going to destroy you but it has no right to touch you or take you if you stay in his will and in his word but here's this thing as this is where we want to talk he says one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after this is the word in my mind that means that if you do what he says here you'll get what he's looking for he says that I may dwell this is his desire that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock you struck me as I was reading this say what is it that keeps us in his presence it's when we inquire after him when we ask him where do I go what do I do what do I say how do I respond how do I act what's your will what am I supposed to do what's he saying he's saying I go to my guide that's what keeps me in his presence that's what keeps me going forward is when I go to him and I say my life is in your hands Lord what would you have have your servant to do today and that's what keeps us moving that's what keeps us growing that's what keeps us going into all truth is because what we're doing is we're laying aside everything we think we know and we're saying Lord what would you do what would you have to say Amen let's stand if we would amen we need a guide I don't know about you but I've never walked this road before some of it looks familiar any they call it Deja Vu but there are times where I could swear I've been in places before and seen and and I know I've never been there but I know I've seen it before and sometimes I wonder if there isn't a a spiritual thing behind that where God's letting us see hey this was predestinated and I'm just giving you insight into what's going on in this situation even though you've never been here before amen but it's the guide of the holy spirit that leads us into all truth that we're looking for Amen brother BR would say he's the North Star he's always in the north he's unchanging he doesn't move it always takes us in the direction that he requires of us amen we're hidden in Christ amen and if we'll stay in that truth if we'll stay with that word it'll have a full effect on us amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are this Mo this evening L that we can say I once was lost but now I'm found Lord we were blind but but now we see Lord that we're walking this this this Highway of Holiness Lord that we're walking this road of eternal life Lord that we're walking in a way that takes us into your very presence Heavenly Father Lord and it's our comfort when we don't know where to go where we don't know what to do we don't know how to respond Lord that your spirit is here to Quicken your word and show us what you would have us to do Lord to give us peace to give us rest to give us Lord a a confirmation and an assurance that you're with us and you're in us every single day Lord I pray your grace to this little group that's gathered here this evening Lord that have patiently sat and listen to the word Lord that you would give us Lord that guide on a daily basis Lord that as David said Lord we would inquire of you daily Lord not just here and there not just when we wake up in the morning and when we put our head on our pillow Lord but throughout our entire day Lord may we seek after your presence and your will and your way Heavenly Father Lord it is time for us to get out Lord it is time for us to go the signs are all around us Lord there's a cry in our heart that says even so come Lord Jesus Lord but there's a light that has to be given Lord there's a witness that has to be there to catch that last predestinated seed Lord God lord I pray that that last one will come in by our witness and by your life inside of us Heavenly Father Lord that we would inspire people to seek the scriptures Lord and find the eternal life that's hidden in there Lord as our eyes will come open by your holy SP Spirit Lord let us be a witness let us be a testimony in everything we say and do we pray Lord God lord we're trusting you Lord our lives are in your hands Lord lead us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen show me your way 11:57 show me your way that I may walk with you show me your [Music] way I put my hope in you for the Cry of my heart is to Love You More To Live With the touch of your hands stronger each day
