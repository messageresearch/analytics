[29:39] [Music]
[29:44] so that
[29:48] [Music]
[29:55] amen blessed
[30:11] I'm just gonna say a few words first so
[30:19] as you know I've been living alone since
[30:21] January it has been a very interesting
[30:24] experience so it's just really good to
[30:29] see how God works in in individuals like
[30:32] individual lives and where the scripture
[30:36] says where he knows every single like
[30:40] piece of our here and showing that he
[30:42] really cares and I feel that God has
[30:45] really been working on me just
[30:47] strengthening me living by myself and
[30:52] I've just learned a lot just meaning
[30:54] like a huge learning curve being the
[30:56] baby of the family sometimes you know
[30:58] things are done for you and I have to do
[31:00] everything by yourself
[31:01] and so when Joshua was living with me he
[31:07] liked it a lot he did like everything
[31:09] basically and so then he left and then I
[31:13] was like I yeah I had to do everything
[31:15] that he had to do so that included
[31:17] dealing with the car which I never knew
[31:20] how to open like the front of the car
[31:22] for some reason and just little small
[31:24] things like putting water in the car had
[31:27] no idea how to do that either I was like
[31:30] on the phone with my brother like how do
[31:31] you open the front of the car and yet to
[31:33] give me instructions and we're the water
[31:35] thing went and just crazy and like every
[31:38] and I think like um in the first couple
[31:40] of weeks I think what God wanted to do
[31:42] he wanted like everything to go wrong so
[31:45] that I learned really fast and
[31:47] everything went wrong so like it was
[31:50] literally one thing after the other like
[31:52] the car something wrong with the car and
[31:54] in the printer falls apart and this is
[31:58] falling apart and it was just one thing
[32:00] after the other so I had to learn like
[32:02] every single day and in the snow fell
[32:04] and then I looked at the window and
[32:06] realized I had to shovel so it was my
[32:10] first time picking up a shovel it was a
[32:13] great experience but it wasn't actually
[32:15] too bad so I've really learned a lot and
[32:17] I thank God for that
[32:18] and I actually want to give a special
[32:19] special thanks to her the mark
[32:21] so what happened was obviously
[32:23] everything was going wrong and after all
[32:26] these years of living in st. John's the
[32:27] door decided to jam for some reason I
[32:30] came back home at like 10:15 after work
[32:33] and the door just didn't want to open so
[32:37] I literally did everything I called the
[32:39] guy from downstairs in the basement
[32:41] to help me and he did everything and yet
[32:45] to jump onto the dick to see if the
[32:46] sliding door was opened and that didn't
[32:48] work I went to my next-door neighbors
[32:49] and they weren't there I went to my
[32:51] other next-door neighbors and they
[32:52] didn't want to come out so anyways so
[32:54] lastly I called brother Marc because I
[32:56] thought that I was gonna maybe sleep
[32:57] over there and brother Marc called the
[32:59] locksmith and we figured out after like
[33:03] a good hour I think he was there so like
[33:05] maybe 11:30 or later and I just want to
[33:08] say special thanks to him just to kind
[33:10] of refer back to brother Steve some
[33:13] sermon yesterday about brotherly
[33:15] kindness and the warmth of the church
[33:16] and brother Marc was literally on his
[33:19] knees and hands like cuz we pick me
[33:21] we've we got into the door afterwards
[33:24] but he was literally on his hands and
[33:26] knees taking out my lock at like 11:00
[33:30] p.m. on a Saturday night you know
[33:32] tomorrow's church and I just really want
[33:34] to thank more than work for that and
[33:35] just to kind of like show the brotherly
[33:37] kindness and love that we have so thank
[33:39] you okay so this is the song that we

[58:50] that your perfect will would be done and
[58:53] we give you that opportunity we give you
[58:55] the preeminence to do so we ask that you
[58:58] would be with us this morning we love
[59:01] you and we thank you for all that you do

[59:05] do we pray amen amen
[59:08] Romans chapter 12 again if you would
[59:10] like to turn there once more
[59:25] and as we read last night we read in the
[59:32] beginning of the week or of the services
[59:35] we began the first chapter which is
[59:37] probably the portion that we're most
[59:38] familiar with and Paul begins to explain
[59:41] to the Romans what their part is to play
[59:46] and this is just one portion in
[59:47] scripture where he talks about what a
[59:49] Christian should be and what he should
[59:50] do and he talks in about service and in
[59:53] verses 3 and down and then he begins to
[59:56] talk to the church and those within the
[59:59] body of believers and then in verse 17
[1:00:02] he says this and he changes and if
[1:00:05] you'll notice here as we read in verse
[1:00:06] 17 recompense no man evil for evil and
[1:00:10] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:00:13] all men so he changes his terminology
[1:00:16] here because before he says B of 1 in
[1:00:19] verse 16 be of the same mind one toward
[1:00:21] another so this is one toward another
[1:00:24] those that are within the body of Christ
[1:00:26] say this to those that are brethren and
[1:00:30] sojourners along with you and then in
[1:00:32] verse 17 he says to all men this is what
[1:00:34] you must do so this is not just to one
[1:00:37] toward another this is to all the men
[1:00:39] those that are within and those that are
[1:00:41] without reading verse 17 again
[1:00:43] recompense no man evil for evil provide
[1:00:46] things honest in the sight of all men if
[1:00:49] it be possible as much as lies with
[1:00:52] lieth in you live peaceably with all men
[1:00:56] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but
[1:00:59] rather give place unto wrath for it is
[1:01:02] written vengeance is mine I will repay
[1:01:04] saith the Lord therefore if thine enemy
[1:01:08] hunger feed him if he thirst give him
[1:01:12] drink for in so doing thou shalt heap
[1:01:16] coals of fire on his head and similarly
[1:01:19] to verse 9 he says be not overcome of
[1:01:23] evil but overcome evil with good you can
[1:01:29] have your seats may the Lord bless the
[1:01:31] reading
[1:01:33] his word I appreciated the specials this
[1:01:35] morning I really I really enjoyed
[1:01:38] singing I can't sing my way out of a
[1:01:40] cardboard box but I love to hear people
[1:01:42] who can sing and sister Sarah sang one
[1:01:49] time before I preached at one church and
[1:01:52] the pastor got up after she sang and he
[1:01:54] said well if he has her sing before and
[1:01:57] after he preaches people might think he
[1:01:58] is pretty good so that's my strategy you
[1:02:01] know I'm gonna throw her out there and
[1:02:03] kind of prepare the way and people think
[1:02:05] oh he's a good preacher but it's really
[1:02:07] just my wife but and I'm appreciate her
[1:02:12] being with me like I said before and
[1:02:13] very thankful for her and her life and
[1:02:16] her testimony and the more and more I
[1:02:19] get to know her the more and more I
[1:02:20] realized how just an amazing Christian
[1:02:22] she is I hope we can all say the same
[1:02:25] about our spouses and I think we should
[1:02:27] be able to I think we should strive to
[1:02:29] to work towards that and I appreciated
[1:02:33] the song a sister Priscilla sang and
[1:02:34] appreciated all the specials that song
[1:02:37] that sister Priscilla sang my mother
[1:02:41] when she graduated from university she
[1:02:45] graduated from a private university as
[1:02:47] Christian and they actually sang that
[1:02:49] song at the graduation believe it or not
[1:02:51] it's kind of an odd place to hear that
[1:02:53] song at a university graduation but they
[1:02:56] sang it and it brought the house down
[1:02:58] it really did so then we our choir at
[1:03:01] the church sang it and it when you get
[1:03:04] believers singing it's even that more
[1:03:06] more powerful I believe and it really
[1:03:09] brought the house down that that song
[1:03:10] means a lot to me it just gets my blood
[1:03:11] pumping I really really like that song
[1:03:14] so I enjoyed it we really appreciate
[1:03:17] those who can sing and those who bring
[1:03:19] our hearts into an attitude of worship
[1:03:20] and open the hearts up and a lot of
[1:03:23] times just from the things that we do
[1:03:25] and all the responsibilities that we
[1:03:26] have are our hearts need to be opened up
[1:03:28] even as believers they really do so
[1:03:30] that's the purpose of a singing and of
[1:03:34] that I'm very thankful to have been here
[1:03:38] with you this weekend and I love each
[1:03:42] and every one of you very much and I'm
[1:03:44] happy to have had the opportunity to be
[1:03:46] able to speak to and I hope that in some
[1:03:48] way I've been a help and I hope you know
[1:03:52] I'm just gonna I've been just myself and
[1:03:54] I'll just say what's on my heart and the
[1:03:56] way that I see it sometimes I see it
[1:03:57] come a little bit in it from a different
[1:03:59] angle it's the same scripture what we
[1:04:02] see it from a different different
[1:04:03] perspective I guess that can really help
[1:04:06] but I hope it was a help to somebody and
[1:04:08] we're also drainers in the faith and you
[1:04:12] know no matter where you are or what the
[1:04:16] circumstances are he's the same God it's
[1:04:19] the same anointing and I've enjoyed the
[1:04:21] presence of the Lord here and I believe
[1:04:23] he has been here not I think that's in
[1:04:25] large part due to you it's nothing
[1:04:27] necessarily that I've done and as a
[1:04:30] minister comes you know when you have a
[1:04:31] great anointing in a powerful service
[1:04:34] many times it's not it's not necessarily
[1:04:36] the minister Manohar
[1:04:49] tear you apart and really drive that
[1:04:51] some are just real quiet and to the
[1:04:53] point and just line by line and teachers
[1:04:55] and ministers we have all kinds and
[1:04:58] sometimes some ministers some ministries
[1:05:00] will just lay this the the stepping
[1:05:03] stones to have a powerful service so
[1:05:06] everybody preaches in their own way but
[1:05:07] I believe that you you are the the
[1:05:10] reason that the atmosphere is so sweet
[1:05:12] in this church and I'm very very
[1:05:14] thankful to have been able to experience
[1:05:16] it with you I really am
[1:05:19] so we'll be praying for you and and
[1:05:22] again I'm thankful for the opportunity
[1:05:24] to be here we see here in Romans if we
[1:05:29] could just get back and jump right into
[1:05:32] it as I said before the Apostle Paul
[1:05:39] he's writing to the Romans which are a
[1:05:42] very peculiar group of people because
[1:05:46] they were it was the superpower of the
[1:05:49] world so their mindsets and their
[1:05:51] attitudes were in some respects very
[1:05:56] similar to ours because they had the
[1:05:58] the amenities and the technology in the
[1:06:00] society that was above anything else in
[1:06:02] the world so the way that they thought
[1:06:05] about things in that the way that they
[1:06:06] did did things is is in large part
[1:06:09] similar to modern culture in some ways
[1:06:13] not always and Paul he begins to write
[1:06:17] here in the first chapter and he talks
[1:06:19] about service like we talked about last
[1:06:21] night and the portion of faith that he
[1:06:23] gives you and then he talks about the
[1:06:26] Christian and those within and he talks
[1:06:29] about those that are preferring one
[1:06:32] another and as I said before the same
[1:06:35] mind one toward another so he's saying
[1:06:37] amongst yourselves this is how you must
[1:06:40] act and he says that between 9 and in
[1:06:43] verse 16 and he begins to say that and
[1:06:45] he we know that that the purpose of God
[1:06:50] was to bring us into fellowship one with
[1:06:54] another but not just one with another
[1:06:57] but with within to fellowship with him
[1:07:00] so as we come into harmony with him
[1:07:03] there is a unity that we have together
[1:07:06] in the Spirit of God so the harmony that
[1:07:10] God intended to bring that that God had
[1:07:12] at the very beginning of time that's
[1:07:14] what we're going back to and it overlaps
[1:07:17] now right among us together so now you
[1:07:20] are the carriers of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:23] Christ now you are where heaven and
[1:07:25] earth overlaps that unity that we are
[1:07:28] coming into and that we feel that we
[1:07:30] have is is is is coming together all
[1:07:33] according to the plan and purpose of God
[1:07:36] the Satan has a purpose as well and
[1:07:38] because of his purpose all of all of the
[1:07:42] the earth and in at the fall of time it
[1:07:45] became Satan's Dominion because man
[1:07:47] forfeited it they gave it up and they
[1:07:50] gave it to Satan himself and God just
[1:07:54] stepped back from the earth although it
[1:07:56] is his footstool and it is his to do
[1:07:59] with as he pleased he allowed Satan to
[1:08:02] have the the Dominion of the earth which
[1:08:04] was at one point gods and so it becomes
[1:08:07] Satan's own Eden and he's had 6,000
[1:08:09] years to create it as brother Branham
[1:08:10] says in
[1:08:11] in the service Satan's Eden so he's had
[1:08:14] that long to to create it into the way
[1:08:17] that he wants it to go Satan as God has
[1:08:21] allowed it to do certain things and he
[1:08:24] has allowed Satan to do that for his own
[1:08:27] purpose
[1:08:27] all the while thinking that Satan is
[1:08:30] working according to his plan and Satan
[1:08:33] knows exactly what's going on and as the
[1:08:35] scripture says we are not unaware of
[1:08:37] what Satan is doing in Corinthians so
[1:08:42] that being the case and since the
[1:08:45] purpose of God is to bring us back into
[1:08:47] fellowship he brought us into what we
[1:08:51] call the church and Jesus to Peter he
[1:08:54] says the first time to Peter he says
[1:08:56] upon this rock of Revelation I will
[1:08:58] build my church so there he singles out
[1:09:02] his church as the followers of of Christ
[1:09:05] not a particular group of people or a
[1:09:08] faction or a sect of people he says my
[1:09:11] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:09:13] who I am and so when you step into that
[1:09:16] church you're no longer just associated
[1:09:18] with a building or a particular group of
[1:09:20] people or an association with the
[1:09:22] doctrine you transcend that into the
[1:09:24] kingdom of God so you are no longer
[1:09:28] citizens of this world you are citizens
[1:09:30] of that kingdom and you are made an
[1:09:32] ambassador while you are here and so we
[1:09:35] are we are transfer you're lifted into
[1:09:39] that church and that is the Church of
[1:09:41] the Living God so you can you can pick
[1:09:44] yourself up and go to to Korea or China
[1:09:46] or Africa or wherever you want to go and
[1:09:49] it'll be the exact same Church of the
[1:09:50] Living God the exact same spirit the
[1:09:53] cultures are entirely different there's
[1:09:56] some cultures where they sing brother
[1:09:59] Jonah are talking about that before you
[1:10:00] go to Dubai or sharjah in that
[1:10:05] originates from Pakistan because they
[1:10:06] were all Pakistanis but they have a
[1:10:09] certain way of worshipping and they
[1:10:11] worship with a tabla drum so they don't
[1:10:13] really start worshiping until the tabla
[1:10:15] drummer comes so and only when he comes
[1:10:17] do they get the rhythm and they start
[1:10:19] going and everybody starts singing and
[1:10:20] then that's when they start to really
[1:10:21] worship but if they had this musician
[1:10:24] they
[1:10:24] they had this kind of instrument setup
[1:10:25] there they'd be they'd be they wouldn't
[1:10:27] know what to do they wouldn't feel
[1:10:28] comfortable so they have to have they
[1:10:31] have their own kind of worship which is
[1:10:32] their own kind of culture but the Holy
[1:10:34] Spirit transcends cultural barriers so
[1:10:37] regardless of where you are it's the
[1:10:38] same spirit so Paul then sets in order
[1:10:42] because we are people and we are fallen
[1:10:45] people sinners saved by grace he has to
[1:10:47] set it in order how we must treat each
[1:10:49] other so regardless of if you're in
[1:10:52] Korea or Africa or America or Canada
[1:10:55] wherever you are there's certain
[1:10:57] characteristics that a believer has to
[1:10:59] have to treat one another and he says
[1:11:02] not to to accept the diversity that is
[1:11:05] in Christ and diversity does not mean a
[1:11:08] diversity of principles or or of
[1:11:11] character or behavior the character is
[1:11:14] is our guideline of our character is by
[1:11:17] the Word of God so what he's bringing us
[1:11:20] into fellowship he brings us into
[1:11:21] fellowship with upon the basis of the
[1:11:23] Word of God and the same holy spirit
[1:11:25] regardless of what culture it is acts
[1:11:27] only on the basis of the Word of God and
[1:11:29] that's how we find the unity of the
[1:11:31] faith and that is the Church of God it's
[1:11:35] not the Church of God as it's just this
[1:11:37] building or just that building or just
[1:11:38] this group or just that minister or just
[1:11:42] that preacher or just that circuit of
[1:11:45] churches or just that fellowship of
[1:11:47] people because there's certain circuits
[1:11:49] in the message certain people who only
[1:11:51] fellowship with certain people
[1:11:57] that's the Church of God one that is not
[1:12:01] of this world but is of his kingdom and
[1:12:04] so while we are here we must know how to
[1:12:06] act with each other
[1:12:07] there's certain an order that is set of
[1:12:11] how we operate and how we how we proceed
[1:12:13] and how we treat each other and that is
[1:12:17] is based solely upon the character of
[1:12:19] Jesus Christ and as we grow in faith in
[1:12:23] a knowledge and in grace we learn how to
[1:12:28] better treat each other
[1:12:30] that's a lifelong that's a lifelong
[1:12:33] pursuit it's not as soon as you come
[1:12:35] into the church you have everything you
[1:12:37] need to know it's not you're not given a
[1:12:39] guideline of rules of this is what you
[1:12:42] must do and this is much what you must
[1:12:43] do you start reading your Bible and
[1:12:45] under the Neath the the anointing and
[1:12:47] like we were talking about last night
[1:12:49] the sovereignty of the local church we
[1:12:51] are set in order and then as the Holy
[1:12:53] Spirit has the freedom to move in the
[1:12:56] order of the church then we have the
[1:12:57] ability to - to operate as the Lord
[1:13:01] leads us each one of us he in the
[1:13:04] diversity that we all live our lives
[1:13:05] with he has the ability to lead us and
[1:13:07] to guide us according to his purpose
[1:13:10] because nothing is is-is-is in inline
[1:13:13] with our own idea or our own purpose it
[1:13:16] we all come into under subjection to the
[1:13:19] purpose of God the Bible says where
[1:13:23] there is no vision the people perish so
[1:13:27] you have to have a vision you have to
[1:13:29] have a vision any a successful business
[1:13:32] has to have a mission statement they
[1:13:34] have to have a purpose for being and it
[1:13:36] has to be simply stated and clearly
[1:13:37] stated in the vision that we have today
[1:13:40] is the message of the hour that Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:13:45] forever and he's alive and he can he can
[1:13:47] live inside of you the veil has been
[1:13:49] torn and you can walk right into the
[1:13:51] Holy of Holies and have fellowship with
[1:13:52] him and that's the vision that we are
[1:13:55] all coming in alignment with that's the
[1:13:57] the unity that we find inside the Church
[1:13:59] of God but we live in the world we live
[1:14:08] in a fallen world we still live in
[1:14:10] Satan's Eden we live in a place that is
[1:14:13] so vastly different from what we find in
[1:14:17] the scripture or what a believer should
[1:14:20] be that that's a hard thing to
[1:14:24] accomplish to live in the midst of
[1:14:28] Satan's Eden
[1:14:29] so Paul he shifts and he says now to all
[1:14:32] men not just amongst one another but to
[1:14:35] all men this is what you must do so we
[1:14:39] have the church within and the church
[1:14:41] within is not just the
[1:14:44] building the church within is the
[1:14:46] kingdom of God it's it's Christ living
[1:14:49] in you that's the church within but we
[1:14:53] have the world without if we have this
[1:14:56] mentality or the idea that this church
[1:14:58] is the only thing that there is then we
[1:15:01] will be out of a line with the kingdom
[1:15:03] of God because we'll just have the
[1:15:05] association with the doctrine and the
[1:15:07] teaching and in assimilate into a set of
[1:15:09] rules without the Holy Spirit leading us
[1:15:11] and if the Holy Spirit isn't leading us
[1:15:13] then we will come into alignment with
[1:15:15] his purpose for our lives and being the
[1:15:17] permissive will of God we become his
[1:15:22] deity in flesh in measure brother
[1:15:27] Branham says in 1961 a true sign that's
[1:15:30] overlooked he says God is not divided
[1:15:35] denominations divide the churches but
[1:15:37] not God and once said are you a
[1:15:39] Christian I'm a Baptist said that's no
[1:15:41] more than saying he's a pig and you say
[1:15:44] you I'm a believer I'm in a message
[1:15:46] church you could equally say the same
[1:15:49] that's no more than saying you're a pig
[1:15:53] that kind of rubs a little little harsh
[1:15:56] but it's the truth you say well I'm a
[1:16:00] part of a message church I go to a
[1:16:01] message Church that's no more than
[1:16:03] saying that you're a pig that's no more
[1:16:06] than saying that you're a Baptist or
[1:16:08] you're a Methodist or you're a Catholic
[1:16:11] I'm a message believer I go I've been in
[1:16:15] a message church all my life I cut my
[1:16:16] teeth on the on the edge of the eye I've
[1:16:18] never ever understood that statement
[1:16:20] I've never cut my teeth on a Pew but
[1:16:23] whatever I grew up doing it that's no
[1:16:26] more than saying I'm a I'm a Baptist or
[1:16:29] a Catholic it's it's no more the same
[1:16:32] just because you say you're in the
[1:16:34] message that doesn't mean that you
[1:16:36] believe it it doesn't mean that you know
[1:16:37] what it's all about
[1:16:38] as many churches who are classified as
[1:16:41] message churches and within in our
[1:16:44] community within 30 to 40 miles of our
[1:16:48] church a 40 mile radius around our
[1:16:50] church there's 32 message churches 32
[1:16:56] now if you want to be a polygamist if
[1:16:58] you want to have two wives there's a
[1:16:59] church for it if you want to have if you
[1:17:02] want to be a triple married deacon
[1:17:03] there's a church for it if you want to
[1:17:06] be if you want to live any kind of a
[1:17:08] life and then in and in basically dress
[1:17:12] like the world there's some churches
[1:17:13] around the area you meet them in a
[1:17:14] restaurant you can't tell the Baptist
[1:17:16] from the from the message believers so
[1:17:18] if you want to live like that then
[1:17:20] there's a church for if you want to
[1:17:21] believe the message in believe brother
[1:17:25] branham's your pastor there's a church
[1:17:27] for it there's all kinds of churches
[1:17:29] around where we're at you can take your
[1:17:31] pick whatever kind of believer you want
[1:17:33] to be you can be it you can have your
[1:17:35] pick 32 just because you say you're in
[1:17:39] the message it doesn't mean that you're
[1:17:40] in the message you understand
[1:17:42] he says there's all different kinds of
[1:17:43] things that you can say but that doesn't
[1:17:45] make you and this is the principle that
[1:17:47] brother Branham was consistent with
[1:17:48] throughout his ministry he says you can
[1:17:51] and again he was in a different time and
[1:17:53] there were no message churches as in a
[1:17:54] message community like we experienced
[1:17:56] today but yet he was trying to get this
[1:17:58] principle across that it's not just mere
[1:18:01] association with the type of church that
[1:18:03] makes you a believer he said there's
[1:18:05] three kinds of believers in every church
[1:18:07] he said there's a make believer there's
[1:18:08] an unbeliever and there's the believer
[1:18:10] so he said you have to make sure that
[1:18:12] you are not just going to this church
[1:18:15] you are a part of his church so he
[1:18:17] separates it's it's Christ in you the
[1:18:19] hope of glory you have to be associated
[1:18:22] with that church and only then when you
[1:18:24] have that association and you have that
[1:18:26] correct understanding of it then you can
[1:18:29] be a proper member of a local Assembly
[1:18:31] then the local Assembly can thrive then
[1:18:33] it can become all that God wants it to
[1:18:35] be and then the Holy Spirit has the
[1:18:37] preeminence to move so that he can move
[1:18:39] in on the individual lives of the people
[1:18:41] in their time of life he says well
[1:18:45] that's no more than being a pig again to
[1:18:47] God I say if you're a Christian to be a
[1:18:49] Christian you must be christ-like
[1:18:51] tabernac tabernacling deity in you with
[1:18:55] the Holy Ghost like it fell on the day
[1:18:57] of Pentecost this is not some emotion
[1:19:01] but I mean a real Pentecost see your
[1:19:03] tabernacling deity inside of you
[1:19:06] Ephesians in Ephesians chapter 2 it says
[1:19:13] you have a body fitly joined together
[1:19:15] you have become the habitation of God
[1:19:17] through the spirit so now we Tabernacle
[1:19:21] deity in flesh and we become deity in
[1:19:23] flesh because we we have him on the
[1:19:25] inside of us that part of us that was
[1:19:27] eternal has met the Holy Spirit and the
[1:19:29] two have become one and we are sealed
[1:19:30] into Christ so it is now no longer
[1:19:33] Christ out there it's Christ in me the
[1:19:35] hope of glory
[1:19:37] heaven and earth become one again that's
[1:19:40] how that happens is because he comes
[1:19:41] down inside of you now notice he says in
[1:19:44] in 1965 he says that's where we are we
[1:19:47] have to become we have to become from
[1:19:49] mortal beings from time beings to
[1:19:52] eternal beings and when the Word of God
[1:19:54] lit our souls and we become sons and
[1:19:57] daughters of God with the attributes in
[1:19:59] the gene of God in us to be sons and
[1:20:01] daughters of the Father God in heaven
[1:20:03] crying Abba Father my God my God it's
[1:20:05] the gene of God in us so that little
[1:20:08] gene of God is what the Holy Spirit
[1:20:10] moves over and quickens to life
[1:20:12] he says a year before that now God in us
[1:20:16] see the sons of God in the adoption that
[1:20:19] Christ come to do to redeem God's
[1:20:22] attributes as he did at the beginning
[1:20:25] all that God poured into Christ he
[1:20:28] poured into his church everything that
[1:20:33] God was the father he poured into Christ
[1:20:38] I wonder how many times it's been said
[1:20:41] from this pulpit every everything that
[1:20:46] the father was was poured into Christ
[1:20:49] and he became that and everything that
[1:20:54] Christ was he poured into his church so
[1:20:59] that you become Christ in flesh in
[1:21:03] measure so you don't have the the
[1:21:06] absolute that Christ was Christ was
[1:21:08] everything in one but when you step into
[1:21:11] Christ you become that that same seed in
[1:21:15] measure you have the same Authority in
[1:21:17] measure
[1:21:18] so you have the same the same attributes
[1:21:20] and the same things that God was he was
[1:21:22] in you and he is in you now brother
[1:21:28] branham he says this and keep in mind
[1:21:31] that the bride doesn't have any power in
[1:21:34] themselves they have the authority to
[1:21:35] claim the power that is inside them they
[1:21:38] have the authority to claim the power of
[1:21:40] God that abides inside of them now keep
[1:21:44] this and keep this in mind as we read in
[1:21:46] 1959 he's talking about Hattie right and
[1:21:48] he's explaining uh it's his questions
[1:21:51] and answers on the Holy Ghost and he
[1:21:53] begins to explain exactly what Hattie
[1:21:54] Wright was was asking for and he said
[1:21:56] that's right that's what she should have
[1:21:57] asked for he says Jesus said say to this
[1:22:00] mountain and and you've heard about
[1:22:02] what's been taken place in that ministry
[1:22:03] that we're entering into and we're way
[1:22:05] up way up the road now and soon the
[1:22:09] coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got
[1:22:12] to have rapturing faith in a church that
[1:22:16] can be changed in a moment of a
[1:22:18] twinkling of an eye to go out he says
[1:22:21] once we have the Harmony moving through
[1:22:24] the church and they know who they are
[1:22:26] the rapture will take place so you see
[1:22:30] the importance of the unity in in Christ
[1:22:33] Church that he's trying to bring us into
[1:22:35] and that's what I see is I visit
[1:22:37] different churches they're coming into a
[1:22:39] unity it's the same theme as the
[1:22:41] ministry preaches all over the world and
[1:22:43] you listen to them there's a common
[1:22:45] theme that you can pick up and we're all
[1:22:48] moving into a unity that is of God not
[1:22:52] of this world it's not just the
[1:22:54] sociation it's the unity of Christ
[1:22:56] Church and he says the he says will go
[1:23:02] out but don't worry he says it'll be
[1:23:04] there the rapture he says it'll be there
[1:23:06] and when the power of hit of this church
[1:23:09] rises it'll bring its brethren the power
[1:23:13] of that church rises will bring its
[1:23:16] brethren the power of that church will
[1:23:18] bring the other brethren and then
[1:23:21] there'll be a general resurrection
[1:23:23] he says and that's what we're looking
[1:23:25] forward to
[1:23:26] he says the voice within the bride will
[1:23:29] bring on the resurrection he says
[1:23:32] because God is inside of them and what
[1:23:35] God did is he subjected himself to the
[1:23:37] law that was overriding him the promise
[1:23:39] that was there so when Jesus was would
[1:23:43] died on the cross like we said on Friday
[1:23:46] night he submitted himself to the the to
[1:23:49] the authority of the word he submitted
[1:23:52] himself by his own authority into the
[1:23:54] power of the world is a better way of
[1:23:56] saying it so with the authority that he
[1:23:58] had he had the ability and the power to
[1:24:01] raise up and to lay down but yet with
[1:24:03] the authority that he has he subjected
[1:24:05] himself and surrendered himself to the
[1:24:08] law that was abiding over it and to the
[1:24:10] Word of God that we was subjected to and
[1:24:12] that's what rose him again so by the
[1:24:15] bride coming into the unity of the faith
[1:24:18] by the authority that they have inside
[1:24:20] of them they willingly subject himself
[1:24:22] to the law of God to the Word of God by
[1:24:25] grace because we're not under a
[1:24:27] dispensation of law but there is a law
[1:24:29] that abides over the Word of God you
[1:24:31] understand it brings it to pass
[1:24:33] so by grace we submit ourselves to the
[1:24:36] law of God and that's what will raise us
[1:24:38] up - and we're already quickened with
[1:24:41] him we are waiting for our resurrection
[1:24:43] but the voice within the bride by
[1:24:45] submitting themselves to the Holy Spirit
[1:24:47] is what will bring on that resurrection
[1:24:49] it's not that you call for it or that
[1:24:52] anybody knows what happened what what's
[1:24:54] happening we submit ourselves to the to
[1:24:57] the Holy Spirit because he is the only
[1:24:59] one that knows the time and when that
[1:25:00] time comes we'll go the voice within the
[1:25:04] bride is what brings that on you are
[1:25:06] what brings that on by submitting
[1:25:08] yourself to the Holy Spirit
[1:25:12] therefore in Ephesians 2
[1:25:15] now therefore you are no more strangers
[1:25:17] and foreigners but fellow-citizens with
[1:25:19] the Saints and of the household of God
[1:25:23] and our bill upon the foundation of the
[1:25:26] apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ
[1:25:28] being the chief Cornerstone in whom all
[1:25:31] the building fitly framed together
[1:25:33] groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord
[1:25:35] in whom ye are also
[1:25:37] together for a habitation of God through
[1:25:39] the spirit because of all of these these
[1:25:43] things you are no longer strangers and
[1:25:46] foreigners but your fellow citizens are
[1:25:49] the Saints I find it amazing that it's
[1:26:05] it's no longer Jesus on the earth but
[1:26:10] it's you and me tabernacling deity and
[1:26:14] because of that we know through the the
[1:26:17] the message that the church becomes as
[1:26:20] it were the moon and in Christ is the
[1:26:23] Sun and the moon is a reflection of the
[1:26:27] light that shines on it and so you have
[1:26:31] the earth and you have the Sun and you
[1:26:33] have the moon it's a very simple analogy
[1:26:35] and I'm thankful for the simplicity of
[1:26:37] it the the church is the only light that
[1:26:43] those without will see that those on the
[1:26:47] earth will see now remember now I'm not
[1:26:50] talking about just the association of
[1:26:53] the doctrine just the church we've come
[1:26:55] beyond that it's Christ Church it's a
[1:26:57] kingdom that you're born into so if you
[1:26:59] were to be plucked up and go to another
[1:27:00] church it's that you're still a member
[1:27:02] of God but but Eagles come where the
[1:27:06] carcass is that's why you find a pastor
[1:27:10] that that you know where he stands and
[1:27:12] you believe in what he's preaching and
[1:27:14] there you abide and he's it's it's a
[1:27:18] most simple analogy the world is the
[1:27:22] only light that you that they will ever
[1:27:24] see you are the only light that the
[1:27:26] world will ever see and you are simply a
[1:27:30] reflection of the light that is inside
[1:27:33] of you and brother Branham took it a
[1:27:36] step further and he says it's it's not
[1:27:38] just a shimmering he says you're glowing
[1:27:41] with the light so he says you as a
[1:27:42] person are glowing with the light and
[1:27:45] the analogy you are reflecting the light
[1:27:46] onto the earth in the evening time so we
[1:27:49] know that window
[1:27:51] gets into an evening place and the world
[1:27:53] becomes dark and the ages get darker and
[1:27:55] darker and darker as they go on you are
[1:27:59] the only thing that the world will see
[1:28:02] so you understand even from that the
[1:28:05] importance of not just having an
[1:28:07] association with a doctrine or the
[1:28:09] church or a church or a personality or a
[1:28:13] a man as many people who just they're
[1:28:16] associated with a man they are
[1:28:18] associated with it with the man of the
[1:28:20] church and that's that's a dominating
[1:28:22] spirit over the church and they're
[1:28:23] associated with that that's all they
[1:28:24] know and they very well are not in the
[1:28:28] kingdom of God they're just associating
[1:28:30] with the church the importance of you
[1:28:33] realizing that you're of a different
[1:28:34] Kingdom is the only way and in you
[1:28:37] stepping into that is the only way that
[1:28:40] you can be an adequate reflection an
[1:28:42] adequate reflection of the Sun so the
[1:28:45] only thing that they will see is is you
[1:28:48] in your proper place and the only way
[1:28:51] that you can come into that is when you
[1:28:52] have a proper understanding and a
[1:28:54] correct understanding of marriage in
[1:28:56] divorce so you have to understand
[1:29:00] marriage in divorce in order to to
[1:29:02] realize that you are coming into your
[1:29:05] place the thing that happens in marriage
[1:29:09] in divorce and to understand the church
[1:29:11] ages you have to have an understanding
[1:29:12] of marriage in divorce marriage and
[1:29:15] divorce is is that Christ is in his
[1:29:17] place and the man is in his place
[1:29:20] underneath Christ and then the woman is
[1:29:23] also in under under a covenant to Christ
[1:29:26] as well as to her husband so you know
[1:29:30] and what that says in that there's
[1:29:31] there's a lot of things you know that
[1:29:32] that comes as a result of that a lot
[1:29:35] along of wrong doctrine that comes as a
[1:29:37] result of that a woman's place is not a
[1:29:41] a man's place is not just to have the
[1:29:43] woman in subjection to him that's not
[1:29:46] that's not necessarily the way that's
[1:29:51] that's correct but that's that that's an
[1:29:53] imbalanced idea when the man says that
[1:29:56] the woman has to be under subjection to
[1:29:57] him the way that it properly works is
[1:30:00] that the man comes under subjection to
[1:30:02] Christ because Christ is all
[1:30:05] in his place Christ never wavers from
[1:30:08] his place so when we come under
[1:30:11] subjection to Christ as men then when we
[1:30:14] are abiding in that place then the woman
[1:30:17] can come into her place naturally it's
[1:30:20] not that the man dominates what the
[1:30:22] place of the woman is it's the man must
[1:30:25] get into his place in Christ only then
[1:30:27] can the woman adequately naturally
[1:30:29] assume her place it's when it's mixed up
[1:30:33] that's when you have marriage trouble
[1:30:35] that's when you have trouble with your
[1:30:36] spouse so the man must be in his place
[1:30:40] and he must abide there only when the
[1:30:43] man is in his place in the hole and in
[1:30:45] the marriage can can the woman come in
[1:30:48] and just naturally fit into that and it
[1:30:50] just fits right and there's no longer
[1:30:52] tension and she doesn't feel out of
[1:30:54] place or out of sorts or like something
[1:30:56] is is it's overriding her she just steps
[1:30:59] into that place and she blossoms like a
[1:31:00] woman should only when the man is in his
[1:31:04] place and when that is out of order
[1:31:06] I have little respect for a man that is
[1:31:09] out of order and in dominates the place
[1:31:12] that a woman should be that woman needs
[1:31:14] to be right there brother Branham said
[1:31:17] when he says a woman should be in the
[1:31:18] kitchen traditionally that's naturally
[1:31:22] where her place was that is where her
[1:31:25] places is because she is a care giver of
[1:31:28] the home in the sense that she can care
[1:31:31] for the home like a man never never will
[1:31:34] be able to care for the home if the if
[1:31:37] the world was full of men global global
[1:31:44] warming would have been a lot faster
[1:31:45] coming
[1:31:49] nothing even be more need be said about
[1:31:52] that if men if it was only men
[1:31:55] nothing can care for something like a
[1:31:57] woman can continually take care of
[1:32:00] something so when she naturally comes
[1:32:02] into her place he's saying she needs to
[1:32:04] just abide in where she where she fits
[1:32:06] were her places where her personality is
[1:32:09] where her nature is a man and a woman
[1:32:12] are different they're not the same
[1:32:14] so in culture and as we have businesses
[1:32:17] and all these different things we all
[1:32:19] would they try to say well a woman is no
[1:32:21] different than man the pace should be
[1:32:22] the same the things like that well I
[1:32:23] agree that the pace should be the same
[1:32:25] and I agree that they should have the
[1:32:26] same respect that men have but they are
[1:32:28] not the same a man is different than a
[1:32:30] woman and a woman is different than a
[1:32:31] man and anybody who that's an absolute
[1:32:35] of the world that that is an absolute
[1:32:37] truth that a woman is different than a
[1:32:39] man they are under the they have a
[1:32:41] similar likes and dislikes and things
[1:32:44] like that but they are the same the
[1:32:46] world chooses not to look at that look
[1:32:49] at our absolute as an absolute yet they
[1:32:52] live by an absolute men and women are
[1:32:54] different so they override their own
[1:32:55] absolute and say well no they're the
[1:32:57] same so they override common sense and
[1:33:00] in just natural tendencies and they
[1:33:04] override that with their own thinking so
[1:33:06] not only are they overriding God by
[1:33:08] their own thinking they're overriding
[1:33:09] their own absolutes by their own
[1:33:11] thinking people uh then and that's
[1:33:14] that's that's that's the way it is only
[1:33:16] when the man is in his place can the
[1:33:18] woman naturally assume her place
[1:33:19] wherever it would be wherever she would
[1:33:21] find it to be that's up to us up to God
[1:33:25] it's the exact same way Christ is in his
[1:33:29] place the church in and he is always in
[1:33:31] his place the church can naturally then
[1:33:34] come into a her place because he is
[1:33:36] always in his place
[1:33:37] there's no variance as to where he is so
[1:33:39] the church is not wondering well what do
[1:33:41] we do and where we are the church is is
[1:33:43] is coming unto unto headship into him
[1:33:47] because he is always in his place the
[1:33:49] bride can naturally assume that
[1:33:51] therefore can you have an adequate
[1:33:54] reflection to the world because the
[1:33:57] churches in her place in Matthew chapter
[1:34:04] 5 and 14 he says you are the light of
[1:34:06] the world a city that is set on a hill
[1:34:08] cannot be hid cabot tower cannot be hid
[1:34:12] from from many places in st. john's it's
[1:34:14] up there on the hill and it's not coming
[1:34:16] down it hasn't been hasn't come down a
[1:34:17] long time if it's set up on a hill it's
[1:34:21] always there so he says now you are the
[1:34:24] light of the world you are HID a city on
[1:34:26] a hill neither do men light a candle and
[1:34:30] put it under a bushel but on a
[1:34:32] candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[1:34:34] that are in the house therefore let your
[1:34:38] light so shine before men that they may
[1:34:41] see your good works and glorify your
[1:34:44] father which is in heaven
[1:34:45] you see works without faith is dead so
[1:34:50] your works express your faith it's when
[1:34:54] you do the works first that you are
[1:34:57] trying to assimilate into the works that
[1:34:59] it's mixed up but you have to have a
[1:35:02] work to display which exemplifies your
[1:35:06] faith it shows your faith so in order to
[1:35:10] adequately express your faith there must
[1:35:13] be a work there there has to be
[1:35:16] something there and so your works is
[1:35:20] what displays the glory of God to those
[1:35:23] that are without to those that are not
[1:35:26] only around you but to those that are
[1:35:27] without to see Christ working is to show
[1:35:30] forth your good works and he says that
[1:35:32] you may glorify your father which is in
[1:35:35] heaven so in order to be an ambassador
[1:35:37] you must show forth your good works and
[1:35:40] that comes from being in your proper
[1:35:44] place as the bride of Jesus Christ so
[1:35:47] it's not a church out of order the the
[1:35:50] head the male is in his place so as the
[1:35:54] church comes into alignment of it then
[1:35:56] you can be up then you are a part of
[1:35:58] that kingdom of God
[1:36:00] you're not only made a bet
[1:36:01] church member in your local church but
[1:36:03] you're also made a light by your good
[1:36:05] works you glorify the father to those
[1:36:07] that are without and you only do that
[1:36:11] when you come into alignment with the
[1:36:13] head when you come into the unity of the
[1:36:15] faith and when you are in alignment with
[1:36:17] Christ alone and if you try to take it
[1:36:20] if you haven't mixed up and you try to
[1:36:22] take the the legality of the religion to
[1:36:25] the outside world then you are no
[1:36:28] different than the Catholics you are no
[1:36:29] different than the Baptist you are no
[1:36:31] different than the Methodists you're
[1:36:32] just bringing people into a religion
[1:36:34] you're bringing and assimilating them
[1:36:36] into the religion so in order to be an
[1:36:39] adequate expression of Christ and
[1:36:41] glorify the Father which is in heaven
[1:36:43] you must be the city on the hill an
[1:36:45] adequate reflection and you can only be
[1:36:48] that unless if you are in line with
[1:36:50] Christ when Paul was preaching he
[1:36:59] understood and he had the the education
[1:37:03] of the Greeks he had the knowledge of
[1:37:08] the Greeks and he had the Roman
[1:37:11] citizenship and he understood Roman
[1:37:13] thinking but he was born a Jew so he was
[1:37:18] a Jewish man with a Greek understanding
[1:37:22] and in education understanding the
[1:37:25] citizen and being interacting with
[1:37:27] Romans being there's a citizen of the of
[1:37:30] the country and in in in all of that the
[1:37:35] Hebrews as Jews had an understanding of
[1:37:38] what light was they understood that God
[1:37:41] was light and they understood in the
[1:37:44] beginning
[1:37:44] there was light and the light shone
[1:37:46] forth and the light is what created and
[1:37:48] that to be light in in in darkness and
[1:37:51] they had a revelation of that God was
[1:37:53] light they understood that they
[1:37:55] understood that the Messiah would be
[1:37:56] light so they had this understanding in
[1:37:59] this revelation that God is light the
[1:38:02] Greeks understood and they had their
[1:38:04] ideals in knowledge they were obsessed
[1:38:07] with knowledge and understanding and in
[1:38:10] philosophizing and in debating and just
[1:38:12] talking back and forth and
[1:38:14] and growing in their knowledge and the
[1:38:16] Romans were obsessed with glory
[1:38:18] they said for the glory of Rome that we
[1:38:20] do this and they would conquer
[1:38:21] everything so here's Paul with with a
[1:38:24] Jewish background a Roman citizen and in
[1:38:28] a Greek education and he comes and he
[1:38:31] says in 2nd Corinthians 4:6 and he
[1:38:34] brings them these all of these
[1:38:37] abstractions because the like I said the
[1:38:39] Jews had the idea and the understanding
[1:38:41] and the conception and the revelation of
[1:38:44] light and that was an abstraction to
[1:38:46] them because they were looking for that
[1:38:49] in the Messiah so they had that
[1:38:51] abstraction there and then they had the
[1:38:53] the the the the Greeks they looked to
[1:38:55] knowledge and they had their ideology
[1:38:57] and had their understanding and
[1:38:58] abstraction is is the quality of dealing
[1:39:02] with ideas rather than events so it's
[1:39:05] it's it's it's the idea of the thing
[1:39:07] rather than the event of the thing or
[1:39:10] the actual reality of the thing so the
[1:39:13] Greeks understood the the the the
[1:39:16] abstraction of knowledge and all that
[1:39:18] they knew and all that they could bring
[1:39:20] to the table and then the the Romans had
[1:39:22] the idea of glory that they sought after
[1:39:25] and their culture was obsessed with it
[1:39:26] and then Paul comes along and he
[1:39:29] understands all of these different
[1:39:31] abstractions he understands all of these
[1:39:34] different ideas that are out there in
[1:39:36] the world and he understands how how
[1:39:37] each one of them are coming so he comes
[1:39:39] in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 6
[1:39:41] and he says for God who hath commanded
[1:39:44] the light to shine out of Darkness hath
[1:39:48] shined in our hearts to give the light
[1:39:50] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:39:54] the face of Jesus Christ so he brings
[1:39:57] together the idea of light in the glory
[1:40:00] of Rome and the knowledge of the Greeks
[1:40:02] and he brings it together and he takes
[1:40:04] the abstractions and he brings it down
[1:40:06] into the very embodiment of the Lord
[1:40:08] Jesus Christ in the life of a believer
[1:40:10] so he says for for God who commanded the
[1:40:13] light to shine out of darkness has
[1:40:15] sinned in our hearts to give the light
[1:40:17] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:40:20] the face of Jesus Christ
[1:40:22] so he brings all of these things and he
[1:40:24] brings them down into an abstraction
[1:40:27] - an embodiment of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:29] in the life of a believer the embodiment
[1:40:33] is a tangible or visible form of an idea
[1:40:37] the quality or feeling he brings the
[1:40:41] abstraction - an embodiment of the Lord
[1:40:44] Jesus Christ as the moon reflects the
[1:40:47] light of the Sun they are the embodiment
[1:40:50] of the Sun and then they reflect that on
[1:40:53] to the earth we know in in 1st Peter
[1:41:02] chapter 2 and verse 9 but you are a
[1:41:04] chosen generation a royal priesthood and
[1:41:07] in the Greek that's a paraparesis I
[1:41:12] believe it is which means it's an
[1:41:16] accepted or a a group that has an
[1:41:19] acquisition on it it's it's a it's a
[1:41:21] peculiar group it's it's set aside for a
[1:41:23] particular service so you're a peculiar
[1:41:27] people you're an odd people because
[1:41:30] you're a royal priesthood so he's saying
[1:41:33] you are a peculiar people because you
[1:41:36] are part of the kingdom of God so
[1:41:38] regardless of what church you go to or
[1:41:40] where you are you are a peculiar you are
[1:41:43] a peculiarity because of what you are
[1:41:46] because of the embodiment that you have
[1:41:48] of the Lord Jesus Christ inside of you
[1:41:50] you are an oddity because this is not
[1:41:54] God's Dominion man forfeited it so you
[1:41:57] are in the midst of Satan's Dominion and
[1:42:00] you are an oddity because you are an
[1:42:03] embodiment of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:42:05] the midst of Satan's Dominion so you are
[1:42:08] you that is why you are the light of God
[1:42:10] is because you are an oddity you are a
[1:42:14] possessed people by God he has set you
[1:42:17] apart and he has put you in his in his
[1:42:20] presence and you walk around an
[1:42:22] ambassador to that Kingdom in the midst
[1:42:25] of Satan's Eden a little while ago we
[1:42:33] teach a Sunday School class and we have
[1:42:35] we have a couple different Sunday School
[1:42:37] classes my mother-in-law teaches the
[1:42:40] once and then there's other sisters that
[1:42:41] teach the the younger kids and then
[1:42:45] sister Sarah and I teach the twelve to
[1:42:47] seventeen year olds and that's um that's
[1:42:50] almost a bigger a bigger burden than
[1:42:52] evangelism to me because those kids are
[1:42:56] going to make decisions that will affect
[1:42:59] the rest of their lives so the choices
[1:43:01] that they make between twelve and
[1:43:04] seventeen determine the outcome of
[1:43:07] eighteen and beyond so that to me is a
[1:43:10] more greater responsibility than even
[1:43:14] evangelism is because the decisions that
[1:43:16] they will make will determine the
[1:43:18] outcomes of their lives they'll either
[1:43:19] you know wine themselves up in with debt
[1:43:22] above their eyeballs you know coming out
[1:43:24] of college or they can make good
[1:43:25] decisions now and prepare for those
[1:43:27] things Jesus talked about money more
[1:43:29] than he did about anything else money is
[1:43:33] important because if you cannot be
[1:43:35] faithful with what he's given you then
[1:43:38] you won't be faithful and spiritual
[1:43:39] things so how you handle your resources
[1:43:43] that you have in large part determines
[1:43:46] how you will handle what God has given
[1:43:48] you and that is not of a matter of
[1:43:51] opinion that is not a something that
[1:43:54] somebody thinks that's what Jesus said
[1:43:56] he said if you're not faithful in Mammon
[1:43:58] and how can you be faithful in greater
[1:44:00] things so in if you go back then in the
[1:44:04] Old Testament you'll see the theme of
[1:44:05] Solomon and even David and then in the
[1:44:08] in the New Testament and even Jesus he
[1:44:10] says you you take care of the things
[1:44:12] that you've got you you you you you take
[1:44:14] care of the possesses possessions that
[1:44:16] you have you you look well on the face
[1:44:18] of your flocks you do all these things a
[1:44:20] the borrower is servant to the lender
[1:44:22] and all of these different things is it
[1:44:24] a sin to be a borrower no but the
[1:44:27] borrower is servant to the lender so you
[1:44:30] see it's not a heaven in her or hell
[1:44:32] issue but those are principles that
[1:44:33] determine the kind of character that's
[1:44:35] in you and those principles are set
[1:44:37] forth in the Word of God for us to
[1:44:39] follow not just to look aside because
[1:44:42] they're unconsecrated to us they may be
[1:44:44] seemingly inconsequential to you but
[1:44:46] they are not to God they may be
[1:44:48] seemingly inconsequential to traditional
[1:44:51] beliefs but they are not to God how you
[1:44:54] handle your money is extremely important
[1:44:56] and that's a we go over that stuff in
[1:44:59] that Sunday School class because I'd
[1:45:02] rather than wake up in ten years and
[1:45:04] have a not be saddled with debt and not
[1:45:07] be a servant to the lender
[1:45:08] I'd rather let's let's figure out how to
[1:45:10] do this right and see if we can do it in
[1:45:12] a good way and wake up and not be a
[1:45:14] servant who wants to be a servant so
[1:45:17] let's figure out how to do it when we're
[1:45:18] young anyways I walked in and I said to
[1:45:22] them or III what I did is I dressed up
[1:45:25] as a I did my best impersonation of a
[1:45:28] biker and it was a pretty sorry one but
[1:45:30] I did my best impersonation so I put on
[1:45:32] a little goatee and I had a bikers
[1:45:33] jacket on and I had a hat and some
[1:45:34] sunglasses and everything and sister
[1:45:36] Sarah introduced introduced Bob Shu
[1:45:39] Mizzou to the class so Bob comes in and
[1:45:42] he sits down he's a biker you know and
[1:45:43] he sees there was me and and I just
[1:45:47] began to ask them questions about what
[1:45:49] they believed and this was a complete
[1:45:50] surprise to them and even in that
[1:45:52] setting even in that setting they were
[1:45:56] getting nervous they were getting really
[1:45:58] nervous and it was it was out of their
[1:45:59] comfort zone it was me it was their
[1:46:01] Sunday school teacher
[1:46:02] dressed up as a biker but I win and I
[1:46:04] sat down right in front of him and I
[1:46:05] said so what do you guys believe and
[1:46:07] they say well we you know we believe in
[1:46:10] in the message what's the message and
[1:46:14] said well the message is you know Jesus
[1:46:16] Christ revealed who's Jesus Christ and
[1:46:20] when what is what is revealed mean like
[1:46:22] what does that mean so I mean I was
[1:46:23] really trying to stick it to them and
[1:46:25] trying to guide the conversation they
[1:46:27] did really well they did really well but
[1:46:29] even in that setting they got nervous
[1:46:31] there was something in them that just
[1:46:33] it's it's hard to do that it's really
[1:46:38] hard to do that it puts you out of your
[1:46:42] comfort zone when you interact with
[1:46:46] those that are without because your
[1:46:49] comfort zone is with Christ that's where
[1:46:53] you that's where you draw from the
[1:46:54] fountain is when you are with Christ so
[1:46:57] when we are here we draw from the
[1:47:00] fountain we refill ourselves we enjoy
[1:47:03] the presence of God we get a refreshing
[1:47:05] of the presence of God now he said he
[1:47:07] will never leave you nor forsake you but
[1:47:09] you don't get the same feeling all the
[1:47:11] time you understand God can come to you
[1:47:14] but then there's other times when you're
[1:47:16] just abiding and you're just you're just
[1:47:17] going throughout your life and when you
[1:47:20] come across something that is not in
[1:47:22] harmony with you there is a tension
[1:47:26] there because they are underneath the
[1:47:29] Dominion of Satan the scripture says as
[1:47:31] you or sometimes partakers of sin you
[1:47:34] are partakers of that life so now you
[1:47:36] have been transplanted into the Church
[1:47:38] of the Living God not just when you are
[1:47:40] in this building you are the Church of
[1:47:42] God at all times
[1:47:44] you're the Church of God wherever you
[1:47:47] are so you are now the Church of God and
[1:47:50] you're in the midst of Satan's Dominion
[1:47:52] so there is tension because there of
[1:47:55] that Kingdom and you are of a different
[1:47:57] Kingdom that happens all throughout the
[1:47:59] day you get you get a in Satan even
[1:48:04] tries to seep it into the very inner
[1:48:06] workings of your home you try to get in
[1:48:09] through your marriage you try to get in
[1:48:10] through your friends you're through the
[1:48:13] internet cable through a satellite or
[1:48:15] through a TV or through whatever he can
[1:48:18] he'll try to get in there and seep it in
[1:48:21] because that's Satan's purpose is to try
[1:48:23] to for the purpose of God and the
[1:48:25] purpose of God is for him to bring us
[1:48:27] unto fellowship with him so then
[1:48:30] obviously there's a disunity between us
[1:48:34] and the world so I dressed up as Bob
[1:48:38] shew Mizzou and they got a sense and I
[1:48:44] wanted them to do that because better
[1:48:45] they do it there than out in the world
[1:48:47] better better that in discomfort is
[1:48:49] there than out in the world so when they
[1:48:51] get out in the world and someone
[1:48:53] confronts them about their faith they
[1:48:54] can adequately describe it and they're
[1:48:56] used to being out of their comfort zone
[1:48:58] because when you're trying to share
[1:49:00] something that was soo
[1:49:01] natural for you it becomes almost
[1:49:03] impossible and I what I did is I rode
[1:49:06] them with question after question after
[1:49:08] question after question and eventually
[1:49:10] that one of them one of the little boys
[1:49:11] said well we believe that God has put
[1:49:13] you here for us to speak to you I was
[1:49:16] like wow speak on and then a little bit
[1:49:19] later after I began to press questions
[1:49:21] against them they said well you need to
[1:49:22] go talk to the Deacons and I said well
[1:49:25] you just said that I got God put me here
[1:49:27] in front of you so why are you sending
[1:49:29] me to them and they were like ah so they
[1:49:31] it was a it was a great conversation but
[1:49:35] the Lord will put you in front of
[1:49:36] somebody and better you you you you
[1:49:39] learn how to get out of your to exist
[1:49:42] outside of your comfort zone which is in
[1:49:45] the presence of God now the presence of
[1:49:48] God is always with you because the
[1:49:50] pillar of fire was always with the
[1:49:52] Israelites they just looked to the
[1:49:54] pillar of fire everything that they were
[1:49:55] supposed to do they follow the leading
[1:49:57] of the Holy Spirit because sons and
[1:49:59] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:50:00] so when you subject yourself to the Holy
[1:50:03] Spirit at all times and you abide with
[1:50:04] him his presence will be there although
[1:50:07] you may not feel like it and you may
[1:50:08] feel like you're out of your comfort
[1:50:10] zone which you are because you're in the
[1:50:12] midst of Satan's Eden with those who are
[1:50:14] in the kingdom of Satan's Eden so there
[1:50:18] in His Church and you're in God's church
[1:50:21] the thing that I'm trying to get across
[1:50:23] to you this morning is that separation
[1:50:27] does not imply isolation although the
[1:50:33] two are synonyms isolation is to pick up
[1:50:37] and isolate from others to remain apart
[1:50:39] from others to separate to touch not
[1:50:42] anything anything else to maintain
[1:50:44] purity that's what isolation is
[1:50:46] separation is to go in different
[1:50:49] directions
[1:50:51] separation is - is is different or
[1:50:54] viewed or formed as different to sever
[1:50:57] and Association to set aside for a
[1:51:00] special purpose
[1:51:02] so although the two are are are synonyms
[1:51:05] separation does not imply isolation
[1:51:09] isolation is dangerous separation is
[1:51:14] necessary you understand the trailer
[1:51:20] parks in Arizona did not work there were
[1:51:24] two men who and they they they created a
[1:51:25] trailer park and they said we're gonna
[1:51:27] exist
[1:51:27] in this community brother branham's
[1:51:29] gonna come and lead us and brother venom
[1:51:31] actually went out to that trailer park
[1:51:32] and checked it out they said this is
[1:51:34] there it'll never work
[1:51:35] it never did work they were trying to
[1:51:37] isolate themselves and keep the world
[1:51:40] out and keep God in and they were trying
[1:51:42] to to bring themselves into an isolated
[1:51:45] life with Christ isolation is not the
[1:51:48] same as separation we are not to be
[1:51:51] isolated from the world we are to be
[1:51:53] separated from Satan's Dominion
[1:51:58] isolation is very dangerous proverbs
[1:52:03] 18:1 though a desire a man through
[1:52:08] desire a man having separated himself
[1:52:11] which means isolated in the hebrew he
[1:52:13] says though a man isolates himself he
[1:52:16] seeketh an inner metalmouth with all
[1:52:19] wisdom so what he's doing is that when
[1:52:22] he isolates himself he cuts himself off
[1:52:25] from all sound wisdom and in the iron
[1:52:28] that he needs to sharpen iron and then
[1:52:31] all the things that are without that
[1:52:33] make him who he is he cuts himself off
[1:52:36] from that willingly he inner metal
[1:52:38] a--the with all wisdom the ability of
[1:52:41] God to change him and to mold him he
[1:52:43] cuts it off because he has isolated
[1:52:45] himself and the scripture says that
[1:52:47] that's wrong he's cut himself from from
[1:52:50] all sound wisdom and and all the the
[1:52:52] influences and all of the different
[1:52:54] things when he isolates himself it
[1:52:56] becomes dangerous because then he is
[1:52:58] subject to his own ideology then he has
[1:53:01] no buffer and no ability to get outside
[1:53:04] of his comfort zone because when you are
[1:53:06] in your comfort zone you're comfortable
[1:53:09] so you don't really need anything you
[1:53:12] don't really have need of anything else
[1:53:13] now you can learn and you can grow and
[1:53:16] I'm talking about a spiritual level here
[1:53:17] just as an individual not not just as a
[1:53:21] church as a whole but as a as
[1:53:22] individual between you and Christ
[1:53:25] between me and Christ when someone is in
[1:53:28] a comfort zone they don't really want to
[1:53:30] get outside of it they have no need to
[1:53:32] get outside of it now there's some
[1:53:34] people who all they existing is a
[1:53:36] comfort zone and they're nervous and
[1:53:38] they were really bad communicators they
[1:53:39] don't talk to anybody they don't want to
[1:53:41] have anything to do with anybody there's
[1:53:42] other people who are just boisterous and
[1:53:46] they get in front of you and they're
[1:53:47] just all in your business and you're ok
[1:53:48] with it because they're just just that's
[1:53:50] who they are and they just you connect
[1:53:52] with them there's some people who are
[1:53:53] more outgoing than others there's some
[1:53:55] people who are softer spoken than others
[1:53:57] or are introverts and there's some who
[1:54:00] are outgoing God is a God of diversity
[1:54:02] but everybody can have a comfort zone
[1:54:04] and when you abide in that comfort zone
[1:54:07] you're not you're not you've isolated
[1:54:09] yourself a little bit because there's no
[1:54:12] buffer to grow you to change you to give
[1:54:15] you a different idea or a different
[1:54:17] thought or a different mentality it's
[1:54:19] just yours and you and yourself so in
[1:54:22] that place you have the ability to
[1:54:25] choose what you will and will not do now
[1:54:28] to bring it more on a church level when
[1:54:30] a person comes into a church and they
[1:54:32] are in their comfort zone in the church
[1:54:34] they come to church they sit down their
[1:54:36] worship they go home and then they do
[1:54:37] whatever they do then they come back and
[1:54:39] do they do the same thing and there's no
[1:54:40] getting out of the comfort zone then
[1:54:42] what they'll do is they'll exist in a
[1:54:44] place where they can pick and choose
[1:54:47] what they think they need to do because
[1:54:49] they are comfortable so there's no
[1:54:51] conviction there's nothing that can move
[1:54:53] them because they don't they were
[1:54:54] resisting it they isolate themselves in
[1:54:57] their own minds they are in a comfort
[1:55:00] zone and God has no freedom to move he
[1:55:04] cannot budge them because they're
[1:55:05] comfortable and they're born-again Holy
[1:55:07] Ghost filled believers but they're in
[1:55:10] this mentality of comfort and and where
[1:55:13] they nothing else can press against them
[1:55:15] and they don't want anything else to do
[1:55:16] a little while ago we had a visiting
[1:55:21] minister and this family came in right
[1:55:23] in the middle of the service and the
[1:55:24] Deacons miss they came in and they
[1:55:27] missed them so the Deacons were like
[1:55:28] they didn't know who these people were
[1:55:29] and they came up and they sat right in
[1:55:31] the front row and they begin to disrupt
[1:55:33] the service because they were unfamiliar
[1:55:35] with church
[1:55:36] was drunk and what they were after was
[1:55:37] money so that's what they were coming it
[1:55:39] was it was a service than they were
[1:55:41] after that so then when the minister
[1:55:45] calls for prayer one of them goes up to
[1:55:47] prayer and he's he's just standing there
[1:55:49] and he begins to say my house burned
[1:55:50] down and all these different things and
[1:55:51] I need money and my family's hungry and
[1:55:53] blah blah blah and this was you know it
[1:55:55] was a real disruption the whole church
[1:55:57] was was out of out of unity it disrupted
[1:56:00] everybody it was so awkward and in in
[1:56:03] and everybody was out of their comfort
[1:56:05] zones because they came in and they sat
[1:56:09] there and I believe it was the devil
[1:56:10] trying to disrupt it but you it's even
[1:56:13] on a simpler level when someone of a
[1:56:16] visiting believer comes in it sits in
[1:56:18] your seat you can be out of your comfort
[1:56:20] zone it's like you're in a whole new
[1:56:22] church looking from the different side
[1:56:24] you know never saw that side of the
[1:56:26] pastor before and it's it's it's it can
[1:56:30] go that simple then it can also go all
[1:56:32] the way up to to uh just being
[1:56:34] uncomfortable when some when something
[1:56:36] comes in that is is out of your comfort
[1:56:38] zone and it's awkward and it messes with
[1:56:42] you a little bit because we're so used
[1:56:44] to the to the do the main theme and then
[1:56:48] just the going on and we go in and out
[1:56:50] and in and out and in and out day after
[1:56:52] day after day and just the commonality
[1:56:54] of things as they become we we form a
[1:56:56] comfort zone we're all in danger of
[1:56:58] forming comfort zones my comfort zone is
[1:57:00] is very small and out just being
[1:57:03] personal with you the only reason that I
[1:57:06] could travel and go all over the world
[1:57:08] where I go is because of the Holy Spirit
[1:57:11] if it wasn't for him I would stay at
[1:57:14] home and not go anywhere I've always
[1:57:16] dealt with homesickness I'm a homebody I
[1:57:18] don't want to go anywhere I don't really
[1:57:20] want to talk to anybody I don't know I
[1:57:22] want to be with my family with my
[1:57:23] friends eating what I like to eat in my
[1:57:26] house that's the kind of guy I am and
[1:57:28] you might not think about that you might
[1:57:30] not think that of me because I'd try
[1:57:33] different things and I meet different
[1:57:34] people and I interact with a lot of
[1:57:36] different people and I go and preach to
[1:57:37] people that's only because the Holy
[1:57:40] Spirit in me it really is and that all
[1:57:43] of that glorious to God because he is
[1:57:45] the one that has enabled me to get
[1:57:47] outside of my comfort zone
[1:57:49] and he continually brings me outside of
[1:57:51] it and I fight him all the time
[1:57:56] isolation is dangerous I've seen it in
[1:58:00] churches where a minister because of a
[1:58:02] doctrinal difference he'll isolate his
[1:58:05] people so he'll pull him close and
[1:58:07] because of the the dominating
[1:58:09] personality of that Minister you'll keep
[1:58:11] them close and here we won't have them
[1:58:13] interact so not only are they not
[1:58:14] interacting really with the world
[1:58:16] outside but they're not even interacting
[1:58:18] with fellow believers so they have no
[1:58:20] iron sharpening against the iron because
[1:58:22] they're in a complete comfort zone they
[1:58:23] have created it because they have
[1:58:25] isolated themselves some of the church
[1:58:27] members don't even realize what's going
[1:58:28] on but that man even if he doesn't even
[1:58:31] realize what he's going what wood is
[1:58:32] going on he isolates them and then
[1:58:34] within that he shuts out all sound
[1:58:37] wisdom so within that then the doctrine
[1:58:39] just keeps getting farther and farther
[1:58:40] off like brother Branham said the bullet
[1:58:42] would do if it's out of alignment at the
[1:58:44] beginning an inch it'll be four hundred
[1:58:45] yards off at the end of it that's
[1:58:48] exactly the same way with a group of
[1:58:49] people you get a group of people that
[1:58:51] together that isolate themselves they
[1:58:53] will be as far off as far off can be the
[1:58:56] Amish are isolated
[1:58:58] now the Amish are holy you won't see any
[1:59:02] more holier people than they because
[1:59:04] they do they have this they dress the
[1:59:06] same they have uniformity so there are
[1:59:09] salacious has produced in them
[1:59:11] uniformity not a unity because it's
[1:59:15] probably not on one of them that are in
[1:59:16] unity in their faith they are conformed
[1:59:20] to their faith and they are driven to do
[1:59:23] the work that they are do because they
[1:59:24] submit themselves to the to the
[1:59:27] isolation that they are subjected to so
[1:59:30] because of the isolation that they have
[1:59:32] they really don't want to have anything
[1:59:33] else to do with the world because it's a
[1:59:35] comfort zone to them so they go about
[1:59:37] the motions and the actions of their
[1:59:39] faith and thereby they produce a level
[1:59:41] of holiness that is very modest and very
[1:59:44] beautiful but brother Branham said that
[1:59:46] holiness is not just an action holiness
[1:59:48] is God God is holiness so he says when
[1:59:51] you be holy as God is holy when you come
[1:59:54] under the subjection of the Holy Spirit
[1:59:55] he is the one that produces that
[1:59:57] holiness in you it's not you going and
[1:59:59] doing it
[2:00:00] if you want to go in and dress
[2:00:02] appropriately or say nice things then
[2:00:04] that's good and I suggest you do it but
[2:00:06] it's better that the Holy Spirit convict
[2:00:09] you to do that and you surrender what
[2:00:11] you which you were doing wrong to him
[2:00:13] and he move you on that and that's him
[2:00:15] moving you outside of your comfort zone
[2:00:17] and bringing you a little closer into
[2:00:18] the kingdom of God
[2:00:20] isolation is extremely dangerous but
[2:00:28] there is also an isolation from the
[2:00:31] world that you can have because if we
[2:00:34] aren't careful we'll isolate ourselves
[2:00:37] from the world around us we can we can
[2:00:42] separate ourselves which is necessary
[2:00:45] but when we go the extra step and we cut
[2:00:48] everything else off then we create
[2:00:51] ourselves a comfort zone which is
[2:00:53] detrimental to the Holy Spirit's ability
[2:00:56] to move in us because we don't to have
[2:01:00] any around our interaction with it we
[2:01:01] don't have anything to do with it and as
[2:01:03] the scripture says we have we have
[2:01:05] nothing to do with ungodliness we have
[2:01:06] nothing to do with with evil as it says
[2:01:13] abhor that which is evil and cleave to
[2:01:16] that which is good so we say okay that's
[2:01:17] evil and this is good
[2:01:19] we'll have nothing to do with that and
[2:01:20] therein is an imbalance and there is in
[2:01:23] therein is isolation because you cut
[2:01:26] yourself off from the very Dominion that
[2:01:28] God placed you in this church is just
[2:01:31] the order that we have to hear faith and
[2:01:34] faith cometh by hearing of the word so
[2:01:36] the order that we have is the Holy
[2:01:38] Spirit's ability to move in your heart
[2:01:41] to convict you by the foolishness of
[2:01:43] preaching this is how we come into the
[2:01:45] faith and we grow in grace and knowledge
[2:01:48] and as we read it home but this is just
[2:01:50] a church building you live out there
[2:01:52] this is only two days a week you live
[2:01:55] out there five days a week six days a
[2:01:57] week so you understand isolation is very
[2:02:01] dangerous and without even knowing it we
[2:02:04] can isolate ourselves from the world and
[2:02:06] have nothing to do with it nothing to do
[2:02:08] with it it's ungodliness I'll have
[2:02:09] nothing to do with it it can all I can
[2:02:12] all
[2:02:12] go away and pass away it's going to pass
[2:02:14] away anyways I don't care of nothing to
[2:02:16] do with it and you come to church and
[2:02:17] you'll exist in that in that comfort
[2:02:19] zone and you'll abide but in what you're
[2:02:22] doing is merely associating with the
[2:02:24] doctrine of the church you're merely
[2:02:26] associating with with that which you are
[2:02:28] have been accustomed to be comfortable
[2:02:30] with Jesus himself says in 1715 I pray
[2:02:38] not that thou should us take them out of
[2:02:41] the world but that thou should us keep
[2:02:44] them from evil when Paul says abhor that
[2:02:50] which is evil and cleave to that which
[2:02:52] is good that is the exact same that
[2:02:54] Jesus prayed not take them out of the
[2:02:58] evil world but keep them from evil as
[2:03:01] individuals so when you are to a poor
[2:03:04] evil and to cleave that which is good
[2:03:06] that is on a personal level you abhor
[2:03:09] that which is evil and you cleave to
[2:03:11] that which is good they will never do it
[2:03:14] so the world in which you live is evil
[2:03:19] it is going to be evil it's been evil
[2:03:22] since Satan took it over and it will be
[2:03:25] evil until it's burned up you cleave to
[2:03:28] that which is good you personally have
[2:03:31] nothing to do with ungodliness as it
[2:03:34] becomes your vessel in Christ as it
[2:03:36] becomes your life you shun the very
[2:03:38] appearance of evil you abhor that which
[2:03:40] is wrong you you set yourself apart
[2:03:43] because you have been separated by the
[2:03:46] voice that called out to you to do so so
[2:03:49] you have not willingly isolated
[2:03:51] yourselves you heard a voice that called
[2:03:53] you higher than the world so it's not
[2:03:56] that you have willingly subjected
[2:03:58] yourself to something that is evil and
[2:04:00] we're going to come in here and we're
[2:04:01] going to exist in this that's not what
[2:04:03] happens this is just a building if all
[2:04:06] of us just dissipate it away with the
[2:04:08] Church of God dissipate away absolutely
[2:04:10] not because you are the Church of God so
[2:04:13] although we have the blessing of this
[2:04:15] building and this church and this
[2:04:17] assembly which is a marvelous blessing
[2:04:19] to all of us even though we have this
[2:04:22] Christ is the Church of God and
[2:04:25] we live in a world that is evil so as it
[2:04:28] becomes us we have heard the revelation
[2:04:30] of 10-7 we have heard malachi four five
[2:04:33] and six and we come out of the world
[2:04:35] because we are simulated into god's
[2:04:38] spirit because we have because the that
[2:04:41] ministry pointed us back to the word and
[2:04:44] the word produced in us a faith by the
[2:04:47] hearing of the word faith comes it
[2:04:49] produce in us a faith that can abide by
[2:04:52] the word and that's what god wants to
[2:04:54] have that's the that's the the mechanics
[2:04:57] and the dynamics that the holy spirit
[2:04:59] can move in so as the holy as the word
[2:05:01] is there and is going forth faith cometh
[2:05:04] and the holy spirit can abide and that's
[2:05:06] what produced the life in the church is
[2:05:08] this the revelation of who he is and the
[2:05:11] holy spirit to bring them into his
[2:05:13] kingdom so now that's how you're an
[2:05:15] ambassador to the rest of the world
[2:05:17] you haven't willingly cut that off and
[2:05:19] come in here you are made a new creature
[2:05:22] in Christ in his kingdom you come in
[2:05:25] here to hear the word of God you come in
[2:05:27] here to be refreshed we come in here to
[2:05:29] worship but out there you are a city on
[2:05:31] a hill you are a light that is not hid
[2:05:36] he says I pray that you would jesus
[2:05:39] prayed that we would not be taken from
[2:05:42] the world if there's anything that you
[2:05:45] think Jesus would pray he would say give
[2:05:47] my people goodness give my people peace
[2:05:50] give them just take all the evil in the
[2:05:55] sickness and the death away from them he
[2:05:57] said don't take them out of the world
[2:05:59] Lord keep them from evil he says they
[2:06:03] are not of the world even as I am NOT of
[2:06:06] the world sanctify them through thy
[2:06:08] truth thy Word is truth
[2:06:13] when we isolate ourselves it's dangerous
[2:06:18] when we isolate ourselves in our own
[2:06:21] minds it becomes dangerous when we
[2:06:24] isolate ourselves from the ability to
[2:06:26] rub up against another piece of iron
[2:06:28] then we we limit our ability to become
[2:06:31] sharp brother branham he says in 1963
[2:06:37] souls that are in prison now
[2:06:39] but that soul that's in there see that
[2:06:41] soul is what God is working on and if he
[2:06:44] can only get that nature that spirit to
[2:06:47] agree with him then that nature dies and
[2:06:50] that nature and that love of the world
[2:06:52] dies and the things of the world is dead
[2:06:54] see because if you love the world or the
[2:06:56] things of the world the love of God is
[2:06:58] not even in you see a man must be born
[2:07:01] again
[2:07:02] so this nature has to die and the nature
[2:07:04] of God comes and lives in you
[2:07:07] what isolation and I'm not going to be
[2:07:10] very much longer
[2:07:11] but what isolation produces is a
[2:07:16] legalistic mindset legalism is
[2:07:20] dependence on the moral law rather than
[2:07:22] by faith so when you isolate yourself
[2:07:25] not only from from others around you in
[2:07:28] and exist only in your comfort zone and
[2:07:30] and because you're not gonna just just
[2:07:34] for simple logic you're not gonna
[2:07:36] isolate yourself without having a
[2:07:37] comfort zone you understand
[2:07:39] nobody is gonna isolate them from
[2:07:41] something that gives them the extreme
[2:07:43] pain in misery no one's gonna exist like
[2:07:46] that we're human beings we want to find
[2:07:48] peace and happiness so they find that
[2:07:50] and then they isolate themselves from
[2:07:51] everything else within their comfort
[2:07:53] zone but what that can do is produce
[2:07:55] legalism whether it be in a church or
[2:07:58] whether it be personally legalism is a
[2:08:02] dependence on the moral law rather than
[2:08:03] by faith legalism actually came it's a
[2:08:08] mentality but it actually was developed
[2:08:10] by Chinese philosophy and in in in
[2:08:13] Confucius in his thinking and in his way
[2:08:16] of going about things
[2:08:17] it was very legal it's very this is the
[2:08:19] way it is this is the way it must be
[2:08:20] done it doesn't matter how you feel or
[2:08:22] what you think this is the way it must
[2:08:23] be done so it's actually a Chinese
[2:08:25] philosophy that really brought it about
[2:08:30] but legalism is a mindset so nobody says
[2:08:32] oh I'm a legalist no they don't say that
[2:08:34] but did some mind said that you can step
[2:08:37] into we don't do things legally we don't
[2:08:44] do things simply because the legality of
[2:08:47] the law now to do things because of the
[2:08:50] legality of the law is a good thing
[2:08:52] and you are not wrong in doing so
[2:08:54] understand the the Pharisees were
[2:08:57] abiding by the law yet they were
[2:09:00] legalists they were the holiest of
[2:09:02] holies holiest people around because
[2:09:06] they were abiding in a Christ type that
[2:09:08] God had given yet they were legalized
[2:09:10] and within that isolation they they said
[2:09:12] well nothing into a throme because
[2:09:14] they're an obviously they wouldn't want
[2:09:15] everything to do with Rome but they had
[2:09:17] nothing to do with Jesus they had
[2:09:18] nothing to do with anything else the
[2:09:19] they were blinded to seeing what God was
[2:09:22] trying to show them because they were in
[2:09:25] a legal aspyn set they were isolated
[2:09:27] from it they had set themselves away
[2:09:29] from it and as a result the holy spirit
[2:09:31] could not show them which was God was
[2:09:33] not willing to show them brother Branham
[2:09:37] says in 1965 and marriage and divorce
[2:09:38] and he's talking about filial love and
[2:09:41] agape love he says he says the Greek
[2:09:46] word agape meaning the love of God
[2:09:48] how would that would make me - how'd
[2:09:51] that make me do about Jesus Christ as
[2:09:53] long as I want to go do it it's in my
[2:09:56] heart to go do it whether I say as long
[2:09:58] as it's in my heart to do it
[2:10:00] I go do it now he's talking about his
[2:10:02] wife he's saying now if I was on the
[2:10:03] mission field and I wanted to cheat on
[2:10:05] my wife he said I could go do it but
[2:10:07] there's something in me that doesn't
[2:10:08] want to do it he says legalism won't let
[2:10:12] me cheat on my wife
[2:10:13] he says legalism won't let me do it it's
[2:10:15] because I know I'd get punished for
[2:10:18] doing it but the real truth of it is is
[2:10:21] when the love of God comes into your
[2:10:23] heart till you want to do it that's the
[2:10:26] truth of it capital T so you see
[2:10:29] legalism produces good Christians yes
[2:10:34] there's a lot of legalists in message
[2:10:37] churches because they are simulated into
[2:10:39] the doctrine of the legality of the law
[2:10:42] and they associate with that in so doing
[2:10:45] they have isolated themselves because
[2:10:48] they are in a comfort zone within that
[2:10:49] so they produce the works and they do
[2:10:51] that works out of a legalistic mindset
[2:10:54] instead of being moved by the holy
[2:10:56] spirit because they have isolated
[2:10:57] himself from that
[2:10:59] don't have anything to do outside of
[2:11:00] their comfort zone legalism won't let me
[2:11:04] cheat on my wife because III know that I
[2:11:06] would get punished for it you understand
[2:11:08] he was saying he said if I if I didn't
[2:11:11] want to cheat on my wife I know that my
[2:11:12] reputation would suffer I know that I
[2:11:14] have all these different things so he
[2:11:15] said even a legalistic mindset like that
[2:11:17] will cause me not to cheat on my wife
[2:11:20] because I know that I'll get punished
[2:11:22] for it
[2:11:22] so you can do things and you can act
[2:11:25] things and you can say things and you
[2:11:27] can behave in a way that you know you'll
[2:11:29] be separated outside of your comfort
[2:11:31] zone and use and so you won't do it if
[2:11:34] say if a young girl wants to cut her
[2:11:37] hair and she knows that she'll lose all
[2:11:38] of her friends she might not cut her
[2:11:40] hair just because that's what everybody
[2:11:42] else does so by it by a legalistic
[2:11:45] mindset she'll start to do that and
[2:11:46] assimilate into that the the legality of
[2:11:50] it you understand what I'm saying a man
[2:11:52] can do the same thing because they know
[2:11:54] that they'll be isolated if they don't
[2:11:56] so they set themselves in and they
[2:11:59] simulate into the behavior of the church
[2:12:02] and they miss the moving of the holy
[2:12:04] spirit entirely what isolation causes is
[2:12:09] a legalistic mindset there were I don't
[2:12:13] know if you've heard me say this but
[2:12:14] there was an island after during World
[2:12:16] War two
[2:12:17] the Japanese and the Americans came to a
[2:12:18] certain Island it's called the
[2:12:19] Melanesian islands and what happened was
[2:12:22] is that there were Islanders on there
[2:12:23] that didn't really have any interaction
[2:12:24] with the outside world well all of a
[2:12:26] sudden the Japanese and the Americans
[2:12:27] the Japanese came first and planes and
[2:12:29] supplies and they built air strips and
[2:12:31] everything like that and all of these
[2:12:33] Islanders were just kind of looking at
[2:12:34] him and they didn't understand what was
[2:12:35] going on well after a while all the all
[2:12:37] the supplies that begin to come in they
[2:12:39] begin to offer the the Aborigines they
[2:12:43] begin to offer the India the natives
[2:12:44] supplies so they begin to get all these
[2:12:46] chocolate and all these different things
[2:12:48] and cigarettes and all these different
[2:12:50] kind of things that they they had so the
[2:12:52] religious leaders of the Islanders never
[2:12:55] having experienced this before they said
[2:12:56] well the gods must be pleased with us I
[2:12:59] mean this is great
[2:13:00] so it established their dominion over
[2:13:02] their own people so then the war ended
[2:13:05] and then the earth the Japanese were
[2:13:07] bombed out the Americans came the same
[2:13:08] thing happened
[2:13:09] different logo on the planes but the
[2:13:11] same thing happened they begin to get
[2:13:12] supplies and everything like that well
[2:13:13] after a while the war ended and then the
[2:13:16] Islanders were standing there without
[2:13:17] any supplies coming in so in order for
[2:13:19] the religious leaders to have the same
[2:13:21] dominion over the people they began to
[2:13:23] create which is known as a cargo cult if
[2:13:26] you've ever heard that term and they use
[2:13:28] that in business uh in scrum and all the
[2:13:31] different kind of things it's called a
[2:13:32] cargo call people just do it because
[2:13:34] they they they believe that's what
[2:13:35] everybody else does so the Islanders
[2:13:37] began to think and the religious leaders
[2:13:40] begin to think now in order for us to
[2:13:42] receive the benefits then what we must
[2:13:45] do is try to create that again so what
[2:13:48] they did is that they went out and they
[2:13:49] built bamboo runways they constructed
[2:13:53] and I've got a picture of it they
[2:13:54] actually took a picture of it they've
[2:13:55] got they had they built a plane out of
[2:13:57] reeds
[2:13:58] they built headphones out of coconut
[2:14:01] shells and they'd strap it on their head
[2:14:03] and then they had bamboo shoots and
[2:14:05] they'd be out on the runway
[2:14:06] going like this moving to a plane made
[2:14:09] out of straw that wasn't moving anywhere
[2:14:11] and they were doing like this and the
[2:14:12] guys on the runway would be like this
[2:14:13] and then there'd be a person with the
[2:14:15] headphones in the control tower moving a
[2:14:17] little and they'd say this was
[2:14:18] documented this is proved I've got a
[2:14:20] picture of it and they were moving the
[2:14:21] little knobs and they were you know
[2:14:23] talking back and forth you know and then
[2:14:26] they were acting that's out they
[2:14:27] sincerely believed that the blessings
[2:14:31] that they had would come by mere
[2:14:33] legalistic mindset that if they did the
[2:14:37] works that they thought it would produce
[2:14:38] the benefits you understand so they were
[2:14:43] comfortable in that so instead of being
[2:14:46] out of the comfort zone and going back
[2:14:47] to the way they were they created their
[2:14:49] own comfort comfort zone and they began
[2:14:51] to do things out of a legalistic mindset
[2:14:54] if we do these things then we must get
[2:14:56] the benefits no benefits ever come I had
[2:14:58] no idea what happened to them after that
[2:15:02] isolation is dangerous come out of her
[2:15:09] my people be separate
[2:15:14] separation does not imply isolation you
[2:15:20] understand we are called to be separated
[2:15:23] and the reason that we are separated is
[2:15:26] because we willingly surrender ourselves
[2:15:28] to the leading of the Holy Spirit and in
[2:15:31] that we are made new creatures in Christ
[2:15:33] because of the oddity that is produced
[2:15:36] you naturally are separated from the
[2:15:38] things of the world the desires and the
[2:15:41] things of the world just fade away and
[2:15:43] they're gone and as a result you are
[2:15:46] separated and you are now a citizen of
[2:15:48] that Kingdom living in another Kingdom
[2:15:51] you're living in Satan's Kingdom
[2:15:53] although you're born out of another
[2:15:55] Kingdom you understand
[2:15:57] so you're separated as a the natural
[2:16:01] result of a birth is separation the
[2:16:03] natural result of a Christian life is
[2:16:06] separation but we are not to willingly
[2:16:09] isolate ourselves from the world that is
[2:16:11] around us because if we did that then we
[2:16:13] would prohibit the ability of God to
[2:16:15] move amongst us but as the in the order
[2:16:18] that he has set he has set it so that we
[2:16:20] could here by faith the word and grow in
[2:16:23] knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus
[2:16:24] Christ and so we are citizens of that
[2:16:27] Kingdom that lives in the midst of
[2:16:29] Satan's Eden you are a city on the hill
[2:16:32] you are the only thing that they will
[2:16:33] ever see this is by free will there was
[2:16:38] a one time an older man he came in and
[2:16:42] he sat down in front of me in my office
[2:16:43] and he said we were just talking back
[2:16:45] and forth and then he says he said
[2:16:47] there's three things that I hate in this
[2:16:48] world and I don't trust him worth
[2:16:50] anything said doctors policemen and
[2:16:54] preachers and he's just looking at me
[2:16:56] you know knows like so we got to talking
[2:17:00] to me and then he after a while he said
[2:17:02] dumb said I don't understand why God
[2:17:03] would create evil and everything like
[2:17:05] that and why God would allow people to
[2:17:07] live why why doesn't God just take all
[2:17:09] of the rapists away and that's a
[2:17:11] philosophical question that you'll hear
[2:17:12] in seminary and all the different things
[2:17:13] that is a foundry of a theological
[2:17:18] teaching is upon that premise of why
[2:17:20] would God do this and you try to reason
[2:17:22] with different people and on the basis
[2:17:24] of philosophy
[2:17:25] but if we think about it now God put man
[2:17:28] on the basis of free moral agency so he
[2:17:31] put you on the basis of free moral
[2:17:32] agency and he put them on the basis of
[2:17:34] free moral agency we're all sinners
[2:17:37] saved by grace so arthur pink said it in
[2:17:41] the sovereignty of god if he if he had
[2:17:43] just left it on the basis of free moral
[2:17:45] agency alone and said whosoever will can
[2:17:49] come to me how could God have ever been
[2:17:51] sure that anybody would come so you
[2:17:53] understood he pre-planned a group of
[2:17:56] people that were a flesh of his flesh
[2:17:57] and bone of his bone but yet he had to
[2:17:59] set them on the basis of free moral
[2:18:01] agency so that they could choose to love
[2:18:03] him if God were to simply take all of
[2:18:05] the evil out of the world and Jesus had
[2:18:07] instead prayed Lord I pray that you
[2:18:09] would take the evil out of the world and
[2:18:10] that you would bring heaven on earth
[2:18:12] right now if Jesus had instead prayed
[2:18:14] that then what we would do is we would
[2:18:16] have had no need for the supreme ethic
[2:18:19] of love because love is God God is love
[2:18:22] so as God brings us together the bond of
[2:18:26] our unity in the faith is Perez is
[2:18:28] charity is agape love love is then the
[2:18:32] supreme ethic that we that we have as
[2:18:34] Christians to love is to choose to love
[2:18:37] so if he were to simply take everything
[2:18:40] away and he were to say if that is what
[2:18:44] we are striving for and he said we're
[2:18:46] going to take all of the evil away and
[2:18:47] you are going to have in love
[2:18:49] intrinsically inside of you then there
[2:18:51] would be no need to choose what you
[2:18:53] would have is not humanity you would
[2:18:55] have a robotic race you would have a
[2:18:57] race that is pre-programmed and in and
[2:19:00] in a predetermined to choose a certain
[2:19:03] thing instead of having someone that can
[2:19:06] choose to love I choose to serve God I
[2:19:09] choose to surrender myself to God and
[2:19:11] those that are God's are the ones that
[2:19:14] hear the voice my sheep hear my voice
[2:19:16] and yet he gave you the choice to choose
[2:19:19] to respond to the voice so he set that
[2:19:22] inside of you by grace and by love but
[2:19:25] you are on the basis of free moral
[2:19:27] agency to accept that or reject it and
[2:19:30] if you take that away then you do not
[2:19:32] have humanness
[2:19:33] you have robots God did not intend to
[2:19:36] have robots he intended to have people
[2:19:38] who willingly surrendered themselves and
[2:19:40] willingly place themselves on the altar
[2:19:42] and that's what he intends for us that's
[2:19:45] what he wanted from us and that's what
[2:19:47] he wants from everybody not just us but
[2:19:50] they out there but the Benham said in
[2:19:54] 1965 but the inside of that spirit is a
[2:19:57] soul and it's controlled by one thing
[2:19:59] your free will you cannot accept what
[2:20:03] the devil says or you accept what God
[2:20:04] says and that will determine what spirit
[2:20:07] is in there that determines what what
[2:20:11] what presence sweeps over the seed
[2:20:12] that's on the inside of you so yet we
[2:20:16] are on the basis of free moral agency we
[2:20:18] have been predestinated to see what we
[2:20:21] now see because the god of this evil age
[2:20:23] has blinded the eyes of them which see
[2:20:25] not so therefore in many different
[2:20:33] places
[2:20:34] the Apostle Paul he's talking about how
[2:20:37] to interact with them and I saved them
[2:20:41] as in the world as in those who are not
[2:20:43] believers whether it be denominational
[2:20:45] or or anything non kingdom members non
[2:20:49] church members you understand whether
[2:20:52] that be within or without he says today
[2:20:57] they're gonna have a form of godliness
[2:20:58] but denying the power thereof from such
[2:21:01] turn away he says turn away from them he
[2:21:05] says do not be unequally yoked with
[2:21:06] believers he says give not that which is
[2:21:10] holy unto the dogs neither cast your
[2:21:13] pearls before swine lest they trample
[2:21:15] them under feet and turn again unto you
[2:21:18] and rent and rend you who shall over
[2:21:22] receive you and hear your words and not
[2:21:24] receive you and then not hear your words
[2:21:26] depart from that house and shake off the
[2:21:28] dust of your feet he says he adulterers
[2:21:34] and adulteresses know that ye are not
[2:21:37] friendship with the world friendship
[2:21:38] with the world is enmity with God
[2:21:43] isolation is not
[2:21:45] separation you understand so he does not
[2:21:49] say for the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:21:52] to pick yourselves up and be planted
[2:21:54] over here and have nothing to do with
[2:21:56] the world create your own economy and
[2:21:58] create your own lifestyle and create all
[2:22:00] of these different things and abide
[2:22:01] therein he never says to do that the
[2:22:04] commission that he gave each and every
[2:22:07] believer and I think too many times we
[2:22:09] just skip over the Great Commission it
[2:22:11] just it's a common thing to us because
[2:22:12] we have greater things to talk about
[2:22:14] which we do but yet if we go back to the
[2:22:16] Great Commission we see that what we
[2:22:18] have heard in the greater mysteries and
[2:22:20] realities it calls us to a commission
[2:22:22] that we must fulfill because all
[2:22:25] believers it was the pry that took the
[2:22:27] book in Revelations 8 or 10 8 through 11
[2:22:30] it was the bride that took it and then
[2:22:32] prophesied to all nations it was not
[2:22:34] just certain men that had a gift in a
[2:22:36] calling to preach all over the world you
[2:22:38] may never go anywhere outside of work
[2:22:40] home and church but yet you are called
[2:22:43] to preach the gospel the Commission is
[2:22:45] the same for ministry as it is for lady
[2:22:48] so therefore we have a great Commission
[2:22:50] what he did is that he said come out of
[2:22:52] her my people come out of Babylon and be
[2:22:55] not partakers of her pleasures come out
[2:22:57] of her sins and don't have anything to
[2:22:59] do with their wickedness come out of her
[2:23:01] and be separated so as a result of the
[2:23:04] life that we have in Christ naturally we
[2:23:07] are as separated people we are an oddity
[2:23:10] you're one in a million you're an
[2:23:11] oddball
[2:23:12] everything that you are is different
[2:23:14] than they are because you are not of
[2:23:15] this world
[2:23:16] yet he calls us in Matthew 28 to go
[2:23:19] right back out into the world that he
[2:23:22] just called us out of and to preach the
[2:23:24] gospel so yes we are to be separated
[2:23:27] from the world and be not partakers of
[2:23:29] her wickedness and her pleasures but yet
[2:23:31] he sends us right back out into the war
[2:23:33] and into the world in the midst of
[2:23:35] Satan's Eden and says now you are a city
[2:23:38] on the hill you are a light to the world
[2:23:40] in fact you are the only light that the
[2:23:42] world will ever see so in order for them
[2:23:46] to see the grace of God in in action in
[2:23:49] order for them to see the goodness of
[2:23:51] God you are the only thing that they
[2:23:52] will ever see
[2:23:54] he's saying here as it is for you do not
[2:23:57] partake of her pleasures as it is for
[2:24:00] your life have nothing to do with
[2:24:01] wickedness as it is for your life have
[2:24:04] nothing to do with evil
[2:24:05] don't let it seep into your homes don't
[2:24:07] let it seep into your life
[2:24:09] don't let it seep into your church don't
[2:24:11] let it seep into anything that you have
[2:24:13] but you must be a witness to the world
[2:24:15] you must interact with with Satan seen
[2:24:18] on a daily basis Jesus said I don't want
[2:24:21] the world to be taken away from you but
[2:24:24] I pray that you would be kept from evil
[2:24:26] do you understand what I'm trying to say
[2:24:27] that you live in the world and we should
[2:24:30] not be ashamed to live in the world we
[2:24:32] should not say I don't have anything to
[2:24:34] do with this world we are God's grace to
[2:24:38] them and to many times because of our
[2:24:41] comfort zone that we have within we
[2:24:44] forget those that are without and I'm
[2:24:48] not saying that you have to go in and
[2:24:50] say in and preach on a soapbox or yet
[2:24:52] you have to go and witness or that you
[2:24:54] have to go to a different country many
[2:24:56] times in my heart as I'm on the plane to
[2:24:58] a different country I say what in the
[2:25:00] world am i doing I haven't even talked
[2:25:02] to my neighbors about this and I'm
[2:25:04] flying to Korea what on earth am i doing
[2:25:07] and I have that conviction every single
[2:25:09] time I I fly and yet the Lord has called
[2:25:11] me to that place and I believe that
[2:25:13] their seed in that place and I am under
[2:25:15] the seduction of the Holy Spirit he is
[2:25:17] in the driver's seat not me so although
[2:25:19] I would be in my comfort zone because I
[2:25:21] just have to go next door he has called
[2:25:23] me to that place so I must go each one
[2:25:27] of us are called to be a witness to
[2:25:30] Christ in this day and age and just
[2:25:33] because we have our comfort zone in here
[2:25:35] does not mean that there is not seed
[2:25:37] elsewhere it could be at the McDonald's
[2:25:40] down the road it could be in Dairy Queen
[2:25:42] it could be anywhere this we just a down
[2:25:45] in North Carolina down in the McDonald's
[2:25:46] I heard a preacher say one time there
[2:25:48] could be someone in the window at
[2:25:49] McDonald's they said you bet you be the
[2:25:52] one to preach to them I said hey ma'am
[2:25:56] that's good southern accent for you
[2:25:58] there I could be in the drive-through
[2:26:01] window they could be your coworker it
[2:26:02] could be a neighbor it could be someone
[2:26:04] that you meet on a plane going to
[2:26:05] another country but yet there is
[2:26:08] somebody out there to receive the word
[2:26:10] and grace is still available and then in
[2:26:13] Christ's blood is still there's plenty
[2:26:15] to go around and therefore we must be a
[2:26:18] witness to them and as a result of the
[2:26:21] goodness that we have in this in this
[2:26:22] word and in this truth it should not be
[2:26:25] ashamed for us to witness that and share
[2:26:28] it we should be happy to share it and if
[2:26:31] we are too much in our comfort zone that
[2:26:33] when we get in front of other people we
[2:26:35] get it gets awkward and it gets so tense
[2:26:37] that we just back down then there's
[2:26:39] something wrong because we're not saying
[2:26:41] in ourselves this is such good news
[2:26:43] I've got to share it now in all things
[2:26:49] there is balance because he says do not
[2:26:51] cast your pearls before swine he says if
[2:26:54] they deny the power of God from such
[2:26:56] turn away he says don't have anything to
[2:26:58] do with somebody who is going to trample
[2:27:00] under feet what you have provided them
[2:27:02] and that's why I says brother Jared was
[2:27:04] saying last night that you have to you
[2:27:06] have to have you have to be wise as a
[2:27:08] serpent and harmless as a dove so as you
[2:27:11] are interacting with Satan Satan's
[2:27:14] Kingdom with with citizens of Satan's
[2:27:16] Kingdom you are an ambassador to the
[2:27:18] kingdom of God so you don't just come in
[2:27:21] here and get fed you are to be a light a
[2:27:24] city on a hill you and you should not
[2:27:26] hide that candle underneath a bushel you
[2:27:29] are to set it in front of everybody you
[2:27:31] are to be you are to show the works of
[2:27:34] God so that you can glorify the Father
[2:27:36] which is in heaven
[2:27:37] you understand I'm not saying that you
[2:27:39] have to go out and witness to three
[2:27:40] people before the day is out that's not
[2:27:42] what I'm saying
[2:27:43] I'm saying that you have to be yourself
[2:27:45] and you shouldn't be ashamed of it you
[2:27:48] have to just be yourself you have to be
[2:27:51] what you are in Christ that's what
[2:27:53] you've got to be to be an effective
[2:27:55] witness you are alight only because of
[2:27:57] the grace of God in your life your
[2:28:00] a light in a city on the hill because
[2:28:01] you have the greatest message that has
[2:28:04] ever done the face of the earth so with
[2:28:06] that it is a it is a joy and a comfort
[2:28:09] to those around but the Billy Paul was
[2:28:12] sitting in a dentist's chair when time
[2:28:13] and his dentist came in and Billy Paul
[2:28:15] Branham and his dentist came in and he
[2:28:16] had a message book in his hand and he
[2:28:18] held it up in front of brother Billy and
[2:28:19] he says is this your dad and brother
[2:28:23] Billy said yeah yeah that actually is my
[2:28:25] dad and the dentist he said he put it on
[2:28:27] the on the table and he says why didn't
[2:28:31] you ever tell me that about this why
[2:28:36] didn't you ever tell me about this and
[2:28:38] certainly why didn't you even tell me it
[2:28:39] was your dad and brother Billy said he
[2:28:42] said he felt 2 inches tall he said he
[2:28:44] didn't know what to think and he said
[2:28:47] that man needed to hear that and he
[2:28:51] confronted by the bill and he said I
[2:28:52] felt so ashamed that I hadn't shared it
[2:28:54] with more people if you have the
[2:28:57] opportunity you share the goodness of
[2:28:59] God are you still in Romans 12:17
[2:29:08] recompense to no man evil for evil never
[2:29:13] repay anyone evil for evil take thought
[2:29:16] for that which is right and gracious and
[2:29:18] proper in the sight of everyone in other
[2:29:20] words provide things honest in the sight
[2:29:21] of all men you're a witness and you've
[2:29:25] got to have an experience with something
[2:29:27] that you witness that's what brother
[2:29:28] Branham says in order to be a witness
[2:29:29] you've got to have an experience you
[2:29:32] better have something to show if you
[2:29:34] don't then don't say anything because
[2:29:35] all you're witnessing is another church
[2:29:37] that they could go to better they come
[2:29:39] than not 18 if it be possible as much as
[2:29:45] lieth in you live peaceably with all men
[2:29:49] as far as it depends on you live at
[2:29:52] peace with everyone if you look down on
[2:29:56] somebody that is in the world because of
[2:30:00] what they do and you look at yourself
[2:30:03] like you're more than they then you are
[2:30:05] worse than they
[2:30:06] if not for the grace of God where would
[2:30:09] you be if not for the grace of God where
[2:30:12] would you be you look down on people who
[2:30:16] leave the message and they they should
[2:30:20] have done that and they should have done
[2:30:21] that I say this is the only heaven
[2:30:25] they'll ever know that's what they
[2:30:26] genuinely believe this is the only
[2:30:27] heaven they'll ever know leave them
[2:30:28] alone
[2:30:29] let them live it up it's a shame but
[2:30:32] this is the only heaven that they'll
[2:30:33] ever know who are you to say to them
[2:30:38] is God not able to make the clay as He
[2:30:41] desires it to be he makes vessels unto
[2:30:43] honor and someone to dishonor as much as
[2:30:45] it lies within you live at peace with
[2:30:47] all men
[2:30:48] your barber your grocer your insurance
[2:30:51] person which is hard your you know your
[2:30:55] your banker which is harder you
[2:30:58] understand what he's saying to all men
[2:31:01] live at peace with him if it's possible
[2:31:04] verse 19 dearly beloved avenge not
[2:31:06] yourselves but rather give place unto
[2:31:08] wrath for it is written vengeance is
[2:31:10] mine I will repay saith the Lord don't
[2:31:13] avenge yourselves but leave the way open
[2:31:15] for God's wrath and in righteousness to
[2:31:19] take over twenty therefore thine enemy
[2:31:24] hunger feed him if he thirst give him
[2:31:26] drink for in so doing thou shalt heap
[2:31:30] coals of fire on his head in the old
[2:31:34] days sometimes a person's fire went out
[2:31:39] and he needed to borrow some coals to
[2:31:41] restart his fire so they did everything
[2:31:44] with coals the Indians would do the same
[2:31:46] thing they would keep up like a clay pot
[2:31:48] and they'd have coals in their embers
[2:31:49] and they continually keep it burning
[2:31:51] that's how they kept if they needed a
[2:31:52] fire they'd just take out their bottle
[2:31:54] and pour some coals on there and then
[2:31:55] they'd have a spark so sometimes
[2:31:58] somebody just needs to borrow some coals
[2:32:01] so by feeding those who are against you
[2:32:04] by giving drink to them then you heap
[2:32:08] coals on his head
[2:32:10] you give them maybe something that will
[2:32:13] spark him in the right direction you
[2:32:15] understand so it's not just that you're
[2:32:17] saying oh well you're gonna heap coals
[2:32:19] on his head as if he's going to
[2:32:20] die or with vengeance will be on him the
[2:32:23] Lord will repay him that's not what he's
[2:32:26] saying he's saying you could be the very
[2:32:28] thing that that person needs to have a
[2:32:30] spark so then live at peace with all men
[2:32:33] as much as it lies within you don't
[2:32:36] persecute them but feed them give them
[2:32:40] water be not overcome with evil but
[2:32:47] overcome evil with good you understand
[2:32:51] Jesus didn't pray that we would be kept
[2:32:54] from evil or that we would be kept from
[2:32:58] the evil in the world and that we would
[2:32:59] be taken away from it he didn't say
[2:33:01] don't let them be subjected to evil he
[2:33:04] says keep them from evil and here the
[2:33:07] Apostle Paul says be not overcome with
[2:33:09] evil but overcome evil with good if a
[2:33:14] church can't be a resource for a
[2:33:18] community a haven of rest for a
[2:33:21] community that I wonder what kind of
[2:33:23] church it is if it's so awkward
[2:33:26] for a person to come into a church and
[2:33:28] sit down that's coming off the street
[2:33:30] that they feel uncomfortable because
[2:33:32] everybody's looking down at them from
[2:33:33] their holy eye then what kind of
[2:33:36] a resource is that Church going to be
[2:33:38] now the elect will hear that God's voice
[2:33:41] so it doesn't matter who God's leads
[2:33:44] through those doors or through our doors
[2:33:45] of our church this is the way I feel in
[2:33:47] my heart about our church I'm not saying
[2:33:49] this to you but if the shoe fits well
[2:33:51] then great but up there comfortable if a
[2:33:55] church cannot be a resource that someone
[2:33:59] can come to I don't think brother
[2:34:02] Branham would really have appreciated
[2:34:04] that just on a personal level and I
[2:34:07] don't think that's what God wants for
[2:34:09] his church his kingdom you understand
[2:34:13] that me that may be the way it is in
[2:34:15] some churches buildings and in some
[2:34:17] assemblies or in some community of
[2:34:19] believers but that is not the way it is
[2:34:21] in God's kingdom God took the kingdom to
[2:34:24] them he went out to them and as you said
[2:34:28] last night he went into Matthews place
[2:34:30] of residence he went in and he began to
[2:34:33] talk to the
[2:34:33] and the taxpayers and all of them and he
[2:34:35] went in and that the other disciples are
[2:34:36] standing on the outside looking there
[2:34:38] and being like what should we do like
[2:34:40] should we go in there and Jesus was in
[2:34:41] there is it come on come on be not
[2:34:44] overcome with evil it's not that you say
[2:34:47] all there are the devil in there we're
[2:34:48] not going in there now we don't go into
[2:34:50] a bar because we have no place in a bar
[2:34:53] but if you come across somebody that
[2:34:55] goes around I'm just trying to place the
[2:34:57] balance in the common sense of it
[2:34:58] because I don't want you to
[2:34:59] misunderstand me but saying and you know
[2:35:01] this well but I'm just saying it was
[2:35:03] visits on my heart if someone is is is
[2:35:06] is participating than that then you
[2:35:10] can't say you're off the devil and blah
[2:35:13] blah blah and this is in this and this
[2:35:14] and this what they need is the same
[2:35:16] water that ignited your seed so by
[2:35:20] giving them water and by giving them
[2:35:22] food you are not a partaker of evil any
[2:35:25] longer you have a standard and you have
[2:35:28] you are walking in that standard and you
[2:35:30] will not be compromised balance is not
[2:35:33] compromised
[2:35:34] but you must give water to your enemy
[2:35:37] and food to them and by doing so you
[2:35:39] could very possibly give spark to them
[2:35:44] so we don't we don't get into the
[2:35:47] company of evil people and hang around
[2:35:48] unless we become overtaken with evil
[2:35:51] that we have a boundary and we have a
[2:35:53] line that we can cross and the Holy
[2:35:55] Spirit sets that for us and as we follow
[2:35:58] the Holy Spirit whoever he would bring
[2:36:00] us into contact with we must be willing
[2:36:03] and not ashamed to share what we have
[2:36:06] within without there is the church
[2:36:10] within but there are those without and
[2:36:13] they you are the only grace that they
[2:36:17] will ever see so here Paul he says this
[2:36:20] is what you this is how you must treat
[2:36:22] each other as a church and this is what
[2:36:24] you must do but this is how you must
[2:36:26] treat those without separation is not
[2:36:30] isolation so if you work in a place that
[2:36:34] I've worked with homosexuals and I
[2:36:37] worked right alongside them that was
[2:36:39] really hard for me but if I were to say
[2:36:41] I'm not going to work anywhere with a
[2:36:42] homosexual I had a man come to me and we
[2:36:45] we had a target on our registry what
[2:36:47] target is associated in the States the
[2:36:49] big convenience store it's associated
[2:36:51] with homosexuals and he said oh you you
[2:36:54] you you have gift cards coming from
[2:36:56] Target and they support homosexuality so
[2:37:01] I went over I should probably should
[2:37:02] have done this but I went over to him
[2:37:03] and I said what brand is your suit I
[2:37:04] said oh did you know that that guy is a
[2:37:08] homosexual where'd you buy your suit
[2:37:11] from I want to make sure and stay away
[2:37:12] from it I probably should not have done
[2:37:14] that but he was like well you know stuff
[2:37:16] like that I said we're not overcome with
[2:37:20] evil I said but we live in the midst of
[2:37:23] Satan zini and I said me working beside
[2:37:27] that guy's probably the only grace that
[2:37:29] he'll ever see do I have do it does it
[2:37:31] revolt me of course it makes me stomach
[2:37:33] sick do i do i can't stand to be around
[2:37:35] it yes at times it bothers me really bad
[2:37:37] and I just don't I just want to quit and
[2:37:39] get and get away from it I don't
[2:37:40] currently work with it I did as a young
[2:37:42] man do you understand what I'm trying to
[2:37:44] say we have to get away from the idea
[2:37:48] that this church in the comfort zone
[2:37:50] that we have within it is the only thing
[2:37:52] that there is you're in the Church of
[2:37:55] Almighty God and yes there is a church
[2:37:59] within and yes there is a way that we
[2:38:00] should treat each other and yes we need
[2:38:03] to treat each other that way so that we
[2:38:04] can take another step of faith and be
[2:38:06] going along the way but we should never
[2:38:09] neglect those that are without and if we
[2:38:12] isolate ourselves from those that are
[2:38:14] without then we lose the ability of the
[2:38:17] Holy Spirit to move through us to reach
[2:38:19] them like I said I'm not saying you have
[2:38:23] to go and witness to three before the
[2:38:24] day is out you have to be yourself in
[2:38:28] Christ because you are the church within
[2:38:32] just be yourself isn't it wonderful to
[2:38:38] be a Christian
[2:38:42] would you bow your heads musicians would
[2:38:45] come but the jail wants you come on
[2:38:49] would you pray with me
[2:38:53] Heavenly Father
[2:39:03] we're taught to be a a witness from the
[2:39:07] very outset of our Christian walk but
[2:39:12] sometimes in myself I lose the the joy
[2:39:19] and the beauty of what I what I have
[2:39:21] inside of me and I'm just looking at me
[2:39:25] and my failures and I allow the devil to
[2:39:27] get in my mind and say you're this and
[2:39:29] you're that and you're that that it
[2:39:30] stifles my ability to share the gospel
[2:39:32] with other people so as we come into a
[2:39:36] greater understanding of who we are in
[2:39:38] you and as we step into that harmony and
[2:39:41] we get closer to the time let me become
[2:39:45] a better Kingdom Kingdom dweller daily
[2:39:50] increase my ability to be a better
[2:39:53] servant in God's church not just my
[2:39:57] local church but but your church and in
[2:40:00] doing so you will enable me to to thrive
[2:40:03] in my local church so that the local
[2:40:05] church becomes a resource for those
[2:40:08] without so that it's not just for those
[2:40:10] within so that it's not just for our
[2:40:12] comfort zones but that we become a
[2:40:16] powerhouse for the Holy Spirit to work
[2:40:18] through and if nobody ever comes as a
[2:40:21] result then so be it but here we stand
[2:40:25] we carry your gospel Lord it is the
[2:40:30] greatest thing that we have it's joy
[2:40:31] it's peace it's good news
[2:40:35] it's the greatest news we've ever heard
[2:40:37] because it's brought us from this life
[2:40:39] to the next let us be good ambassadors
[2:40:43] of it teach us to be that as we walk the
[2:40:48] narrow road teach us to be proper
[2:40:51] ambassadors that would be pleasing in
[2:40:52] your sight would you help us to do that
[2:40:58] granite father in the name of the Lord
[2:41:00] Jesus Christ amen and amen for the
[2:41:04] journal if you come it's been a pleasure
[2:41:06] to be with you Saints I'm thankful for
[2:41:09] the opportunity and may the Lord bless
[2:41:10] you god bless you my brother amen praise
[2:41:14] the name of the Lord
[2:41:16] thank God for the word a man a nice the
[2:41:21] Lord I said this good and I said we
[2:41:24] could take it from Genesis to Revelation
[2:41:25] I said when it comes to earth revelation
[2:41:28] I said of a comfort zone because that's
[2:41:31] what the enemy issues right on down
[2:41:33] through a man'd until only that you
[2:41:36] could go back beyond Genesis 1:1 you
[2:41:39] could go way back to Satan himself in
[2:41:41] heaven amen when he came into his own
[2:41:44] comfort zone he wanted to do this but
[2:41:46] not the will of God a man he was what he
[2:41:49] what he was thinking what he felt within
[2:41:51] himself but again for the for the true
[2:41:54] believer is the will of God you want to
[2:41:56] if your comfort zone disease is God in
[2:41:59] control your kamas own is being led by
[2:42:01] the spirit a may and by the grace of
[2:42:03] Almighty God Amen I said Lord this is
[2:42:06] tremendous and I said the brother could
[2:42:09] go on for a few hours
[2:42:10] amen in acid he can go back to Genesis

[2:42:19] to the time of Enoch and Noah and and
[2:42:22] there was another one that kids another
[2:42:24] revelation that came to me when our
[2:42:26] brother was ministering and I said Lord
[2:42:28] I said this is tremendous I said a man I
[2:42:31] said because it proves again I said what
[2:42:34] our brother is ministering I said it's
[2:42:36] not it's not him I said it's the Holy
[2:42:38] Ghost he's bringing out a revelation of
[2:42:41] God in his word to his people he's
[2:42:44] bringing out a revelation of the
[2:42:45] relationship that God wants with his
[2:42:47] sons and his daughters in the earth a
[2:42:49] man is now you in control it's God in
[2:42:53] control is not you there's lead Ian's
[2:42:55] got of this leading a man so because if
[2:42:58] it's you in control there's going to be
[2:42:59] that what our brother was bringing out
[2:43:01] that self-righteousness a man that
[2:43:03] you're going to I I'm going to stay
[2:43:05] separated from this one to that one I
[2:43:07] want nothing to do with this one of that
[2:43:09] one amen brother it's the ice I said
[2:43:12] last night it's the grace of God that
[2:43:14] saved you and it's the grace of God to
[2:43:15] them amen
[2:43:17] by the grace i again likes to keep a
[2:43:19] right attitude and a right spirit stay

[2:43:25] of Almighty God amen
[2:43:27] brothers for that God is God is going to
[2:43:30] be able to use you some got you somebody
[2:43:33] to bring me of the word to me God is
[2:43:36] gonna use somebody to bring the word to
[2:43:38] you any may and so who's he gonna use
[2:43:40] you to take the word to Amen by the
[2:43:43] grace of God maybe they're waiting you
[2:43:45] know God is waiting on you
[2:43:46] but we got to have a right spirit and a
[2:43:49] right attitude brother I tied to any of
[2:43:52] this and I while our brother was
[2:43:54] ministering again there was some
[2:43:56] thoughts came to me and they in the
[2:43:57] Bible I surprised the Lord this is
[2:43:59] exactly what our brothers ministry and I
[2:44:02] said this brother had that problem I
[2:44:04] said when it comes to his own comfort
[2:44:06] zone and his self-centered revelation is
[2:44:09] self centered righteousness and so on oh
[2:44:12] god I said I said helpless I said to
[2:44:15] recognize we gotta we gotta have a keep
[2:44:17] a balance in this by the grace of God
[2:44:19] you're not called her self-righteousness
[2:44:22] recalled to his righteousness a man and
[2:44:25] whosoever will by the grace of God so we
[2:44:29] want this one we will and as I said you
[2:44:32] you feel bad because oh well it's the
[2:44:34] end and so don't worry about it just
[2:44:37] praise the Lord hallelujah we're going
[2:44:39] to glory we're going to heaven we're
[2:44:40] going to be with Jesus but what about
[2:44:42] that one there a man don't you want that
[2:44:45] one to go doing what about that brother
[2:44:47] whatever that sister whatever that man
[2:44:49] whatever their woman whatever they have
[2:44:50] that child there a man so brother I pray
[2:44:53] grace that we're in God's comfort zone
[2:44:55] is what God wants and not what we want
[2:44:58] amen if why God wants us to do when God
[2:45:01] wants to do it where God wants to do it
[2:45:03] and how he wants us to do it and to whom
[2:45:05] he wants it done by the grace of God
[2:45:08] amen
[2:45:09] submit again I had this trance the truth
[2:45:11] God has dealt with that vets spirit of
[2:45:14] self righteousness all down through the
[2:45:15] ages a man that a fellow this is God so
[2:45:19] God don't want me to do this God don't
[2:45:21] want me to do that and that's exactly
[2:45:22] what God wanted him to do amen he wanted
[2:45:26] to use them as a light he wanted to use
[2:45:28] them as a witness he wanted to use them
[2:45:29] as a testimony a man
[2:45:32] a-any what they say what they do how
[2:45:34] they
[2:45:35] when and where a man and the Lord opened
[2:45:39] to my heart there is there's a number in
[2:45:42] the scriptures a man that the survey
[2:45:46] themselves but ain't not now the way
[2:45:48] they got one of them separate and the
[2:45:51] one that I that that was that stands out
[2:45:53] and I pray God in the name of Jesus give
[2:45:56] you the revelation amen praise God
[2:46:00] brother don't don't get caught up with
[2:46:02] self-righteousness don't get caught out
[2:46:04] with old God called me into this word
[2:46:06] and it into this message so I could have
[2:46:08] nothing to do with them over there I'm
[2:46:10] gonna have nothing to do with that I'm

[2:46:19] chosen some of them is elect over there
[2:46:22] so keep your attitude right keep your
[2:46:24] spirit right by the grace of God a man
[2:46:27] yes god help us and I and the Lord led
[2:46:31] me to the scripture there concerning his
[2:46:33] servant Jonah amen brother
[2:46:39] Jonah where Jonah was was was in his own
[2:46:42] comfort zone Jonah was a Jew and
[2:46:45] Jonathan was self righteous and Jonah
[2:46:48] felt that God was going to call and do
[2:46:50] nothing or somebody anybody else it was
[2:46:52] just the Jews and he was one of them and
[2:46:56] God called him and what did he do he do
[2:46:58] yell oh my god Elvis brother to learn
[2:47:01] from the story of Jonah
[2:47:03] oh brother and again we we we I pray
[2:47:07] that though we've got God's will that

[2:47:19] wants you to do it where he wants you to
[2:47:21] do it where to whom he wants you to do
[2:47:23] it by the grace of God and Jonah didn't
[2:47:26] want to go down to Nineveh no no he
[2:47:28] wanted nothing to do with Nineveh
[2:47:29] because they were Gentiles Lord
[2:47:32] what are you doing that for amen they're
[2:47:34] Gentiles they don't worship you did
[2:47:36] it'll keep the law you know

[2:47:41] don't do this they don't do that they're
[2:47:42] guilty of all this a man but yeah there
[2:47:45] was there were seed down there a God

[2:48:12] the chosen is the bride a man and the

[2:51:10] that place the old fashioned Salvation

[2:51:15] had to come to that place not my will
[2:51:17] they be done a million because it's
[2:51:20] going to me maybe it's going to cost me
[2:51:21] this and it could have cost me that a
[2:51:23] man bring a total separation unto the
[2:51:26] Lord a man but an end not separation
[2:51:29] from but it's unto him it's under his
[2:51:33] control under his leadership a man that
[2:51:37] doesn't mean you kill you you don't God
[2:51:39] wants you to do it
[2:51:40] cuz our Brotherhood bringing it out and
[2:51:41] bringing it out that God don't want you
[2:51:44] to every new with that went over there
[2:51:46] that fellow that guy or they've met or
[2:51:48] that woman or whatever brother you don't
[2:51:51] know who's Seton who's not seen God do
[2:51:54] it does follow his leadership but again
[2:51:56] there are a lot of believers to
[2:51:58] our totally separated unto themselves a
[2:52:00] man they become they become as there
[2:52:04] were denominations a man they are self
[2:52:08] righteous oh well they're listened
[2:52:11] Saints they're Pentecostals
[2:52:21] when I have nine to do with them
[2:52:24] they're Anglicans one had nothing to do
[2:52:27] with them they're Catholic someone I
[2:52:28] have nothing to do with them yeah I've
[2:52:34] got I got notes home written by a
[2:52:36] Catholic and the priest was ministering
[2:52:43] then he went up to the priest after he
[2:52:44] said he said would you give me the
[2:52:46] reference of that Scripture he said and
[2:52:50] he and he wrote the scripture down some
[2:52:52] thoughts down and he gave it and that
[2:52:54] that man gave it to me and I was going
[2:52:59] and talking with him one time and Annie
[2:53:01] Aegis and and again a lot of you
[2:53:03] wouldn't even who wouldn't even talk to
[2:53:05] him because he was a Roman Catholic and
[2:53:06] talking to him one time and he said he
[2:53:09] said he said brother he said I've got to
[2:53:12] H I've got to confess this he said that
[2:53:15] I agree with you he said you you
[2:53:17] recorded that scripture concerning you
[2:53:20] know the attitude of people in the last
[2:53:21] days he said brother that's the truth
[2:53:24] and he said I agree with you he said we
[2:53:26] have come to that place because not only
[2:53:28] you experienced that but he said I've
[2:53:30] experienced him he said the same thing
[2:53:32] and I recognized that it's prophecy
[2:53:34] fulfilled it's what Jesus said he said
[2:53:36] to warn us and so as I said lord I said
[2:53:39] God bless this man amen praise the Lord
[2:53:43] it's just like we were in there the
[2:53:44] other again the brother brought us
[2:53:45] something then in this came to my mind
[2:53:47] just recently when he was ministering
[2:53:50] because it was exactly what God what he
[2:53:54] has said and I said Amen Lord that's the
[2:53:57] truth that God will do this and God will
[2:53:59] do that you know in the end and so on
[2:54:01] and what came to my mind was something
[2:54:03] that happened just this past week when
[2:54:06] we went to the barbershop and on
[2:54:09] Thursday
[2:54:11] it was amazing brother I try to let God
[2:54:15] lead because I turn it maybe we wouldn't
[2:54:18] make the choice we wouldn't do this we
[2:54:20] wouldn't do that but maybe God would do
[2:54:22] it and maybe God would want us to do it
[2:54:25] amen and as I said we went in and I sat
[2:54:28] down and there was this woman they're
[2:54:30] getting their hair cut and some demon
[2:54:33] eating and maybe it would recognize her
[2:54:36] as a woman
[2:54:36] maybe where she look like much so much
[2:54:39] like a man and but it was a woman and I
[2:54:47] remember looking at her sitting down
[2:54:51] myself sister Betty and I said Lord I
[2:54:56] said would you bring conviction in her
[2:54:59] heart
[2:54:59] I said Lord I said I don't know I said
[2:55:04] what the problem is what the issue is
[2:55:07] but in the name of Jesus I said have
[2:55:10] mercy I said our heart goes out to her
[2:55:16] why why well before I was finished with
[2:55:29] her and then her brother came and he got
[2:55:31] into the image of the barber's chair
[2:55:42] as the Lord as a wave you are Dean this
[2:55:47] that we would be here at this time and
[2:55:52] that's when we discovered that the woman
[2:55:54] was the mother of that man whose body
[2:55:59] they found in the harbor a few days ago
[2:56:02] I won't get into the details but he's
[2:56:14] been on the news he's been in the news
[2:56:16] where he's been testifying in the court
[2:56:20] concerning the issue that happened a
[2:56:23] while ago above the court the court
[2:56:25] issue just would just came to pass just
[2:56:27] recently but he was he was there he says
[2:56:31] to fight and though there was a lot
[2:56:34] going on I said oh I said maybe that's
[2:56:37] why I said the Lord laid me laid it on
[2:56:39] my heart to pray for and her brother of
[2:56:45] course he came to tears when he began to
[2:56:47] explain some things I said God have
[2:56:52] mercy on them so brother I pray the
[2:56:57] grace of god you're gonna be led by the
[2:56:58] Spirit of God it's not God and not our
[2:57:01] comfort zone as God's comfort zone and I
[2:57:05] tell you what makes it comfort is being
[2:57:08] in the will of God and being led by the
[2:57:11] Spirit of God so God elvis is my prayer
[2:57:15] that we're going to by that by the grace
[2:57:20] of God we're not going to have to fight
[2:57:23] our way as a word to nineveh when God
[2:57:26] called Jonah go down and witness to them
[2:57:28] and he we didn't want to do it and even
[2:57:31] after he did it and it brought forth the
[2:57:35] reason why God had sent him down and
[2:57:37] that all that Nineveh Nineveh repented
[2:57:40] everybody in then of it repented and
[2:57:42] they went on serving the Lord for two
[2:57:45] hundred and fifty years and going god
[2:57:50] did nothing they had to do nothing
[2:57:51] against Nineveh for 250 years
[2:57:54] because they stayed faithful to the
[2:57:56] message that God had brought them
[2:57:58] through Jonah but we find that Jonah
[2:58:01] still didn't if they felt that it that
[2:58:03] God shouldn't have done it because of
[2:58:06] Nineveh and God had to judged on Jonah
[2:58:09] today he wasn't lost buddy but God
[2:58:11] judged him amen and the thing of it is
[2:58:15] you know I got a race up this these
[2:58:19] trees are over Jonah and then he sent a
[2:58:22] worm and Jonah was glad for the trees to
[2:58:25] hide him from the Sun a man all pray was
[2:58:28] so thankful then the worms came in and
[2:58:31] took him down and Jonah felt bad for
[2:58:34] that because the tree was destroyed by
[2:58:36] the world and God said you feel bad for
[2:58:38] the tree sir but you didn't feel bad for
[2:58:40] the Ninevites a man we feel bad for this
[2:58:43] over there but whatever what about for
[2:58:46] the others out there a man for your
[2:58:48] family your friends your neighbors a man
[2:58:51] my brother brought out God's not willing
[2:58:53] that any should perish a man why should
[2:58:56] we be building that any perish if this
[2:58:58] heart went out to them why not our
[2:59:00] hearts go out to them amen old but we're
[2:59:03] at the end yeah I know we're at the end
[2:59:05] that means your heart ago that much more
[2:59:07] for them amen you're going to call that
[2:59:09] much more for the grace of God in their
[2:59:11] lives and then the grace that you have
[2:59:13] in the salvations you have you're going
[2:59:15] to call for them by the grace of God
[2:59:17] amen
[2:59:19] but I pray the Grayson and brother
[2:59:21] talked about the robots a man yes a lot
[2:59:25] of believers are robots no offense to
[2:59:28] anybody here I trust you're not by trust
[2:59:31] you're real but not a robot no no your
[2:59:36] seed of God brother the prophet of God
[2:59:38] said you not you know what he said he
[2:59:41] says my shot yet he said but he said I
[2:59:44] want to turn to this I want you to see
[2:59:47] this want you to know this he said do
[2:59:50] you know he said that man is an amateur
[2:59:51] God yeah
[2:59:54] he said you're an amateur God he said
[2:59:56] because you come out of God amen if
[2:59:59] you're really the true seat of God
[3:00:01] you're you you are God a man and you are
[3:00:05] Jesus in flesh
[3:00:07] amen so he's made flesh and I like it
[3:00:10] he's made flesh in is bright by the
[3:00:13] grace of God so God Elpis is my prayer

[3:00:21] real father
[3:00:22] thine be done God give us the Holy Ghost
[3:00:26] balance in the word in our relationship

[3:00:40] brother Minister concerning legalists

[3:00:45] us with the message no no no no don't do

[3:01:13] had to deal with that in every age when
[3:01:17] it comes to the comfort zones that
[3:01:18] people get into he had to deal with it
[3:01:21] with individuals from Genesis to
[3:01:24] Revelation he had to deal with it with
[3:01:26] the Jews he had to deal with it with the
[3:01:27] Gentiles amen that's why did you go to
[3:01:31] church ages that's what that's what
[3:01:34] produced the the message of repentance

[3:01:40] repent repent because I have this I see
[3:01:42] I got this against you I see this wrong
