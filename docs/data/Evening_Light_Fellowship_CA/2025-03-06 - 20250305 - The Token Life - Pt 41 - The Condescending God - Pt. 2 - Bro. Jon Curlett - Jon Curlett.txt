that when the hard times come the decisions come Lord that we can stand on your word and trust that you've got all things in your control so Lord we're thankful this evening Lord we're thankful for

this evening Lord as we preach your word Lord may you just take it and use it Lord to just change us a little more into that Perfect Image that you have of us Lord bless your people here that have made the effort to come out Lord It's middle of the week Lord we're tired maybe weary from the battle Lord I pray you strengthen us this evening each one we pray Lord grant us Grace now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 19 amen it is so good to see Nadine here with us tonight what a pleasant surprise God bless you for coming in on a Wednesday night amen wonderful to see you Amen brother Grant also has had a bit of a rough week and he came in tonight he said I don't know if I'll be able to make it or not he was with some scheduling issues and things and whatnot but he's here so God bless you as well for coming in brother Grant I see brother Chad's here alone and serving the lord up by himself here tonight at the service but it's good to see him as well amen amen it's a it's an effort you know just cuz you're a Believer doesn't mean it's not an effort that we don't have days where we don't feel tired and worn out and I see sister Kimberly's here tonight and I know she's not feeling real well but she's here I say God bless you God bless you amen it's uh brother Bob always gives this testimony brother Bob I'm going to testify for you tonight he says I come into church and my throat's not feeling good and I might be snuffled up or whatever that might be he says but I say Lord I'm here to serve I'm here to worship I'm here to do my part he says and in invariably by the end of the service or sometimes even before a few songs are sung he's right to where he needs to be and God comes down touches him you know sometimes we just need to say boo devil amen and let them know whose side we're on and that we're going to praise the Lord no matter what so I say God bless you to each one that's here tonight amen John chapter 19 maybe a bit of an odd scripture to start this evening on a Wednesday night it's the scene of the crucifixion it says in verse 28 after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst now there was a set of vessel there was set a vessel full of vinegar that's just a cheap wine and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hisp and put it in his mouth when Jesus therefore have received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening we're going to take a second service on this thought of the condescending God and it'll be tonight and as far as I know Sunday as well but we'll see what the Lord would have but I just want to say God bless you for the service on Sunday I just thought it was an absolutely wonderful atmosphere uh when I came in to preach and and I just when I was sitting in there about three lines into the first song I said all right they're here for church this morning and I I sure appreciate I was telling some of the brothers after the service I said I wasn't feeling it this morning I was nervous I was anxious I just was was just not feeling unsettled about the service and you can study your heart out and you can feel you found in mind of the Lord and that doesn't change a thing you can go up and you can be nervous as a well just nervous and so but once I got to the pulpit just everything kind of drained away and by God's grace I was able to preach without without anything holding me back so I'm thankful for that that's his grace amen but that's a a part of the congregation that sets that atmosphere so that the preacher can come in and he can step right into that and God can move in there and he can speak to his people but I want to pick up where we left off on Sunday and we were speaking of God above us at the very beginning there in his dispensation of the father and the pillar of fire and that was him revealing himself as father to his children and from there he condescended and he came down but remember he would only come down he would only come down temporarily as a father he'd only drop down and then he'd go up he'd drop down and then he'd go up he never stayed the whole time he he was he was never ever present he was ever present up there but he was never ever present in the lives of the people amen and so what would he do he would come down and he would show us his will he would show us his word he would show us what he wanted done and then when that was done he'd go away and you could do it or you could not do it that's kind of the way that that it worked there amen but his will is his word we know that's one thing and I was talking with brother Grant about this after the service and it's a point that we've got to keep clear as we're going going through this service and this series because we're speaking on the life of a Believer that's been filled with the spirit that's the token life they've received the token life of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit and we have to drive home this thought that if you have the spirit of God then the leadership of that spirit will be according to the word of God every single time that's the only way that he works God cannot go against his word God cannot move against his own word God can't anull his own word God can't contradict his word you can't have two parts that are in tension with each with each other it's impossible because if he was to do that he would be moving contrary to himself and remember what Jesus said a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand amen we know that truth is what God says if God says it's right it's right if God says it's wrong it doesn't matter what Society what what the social construct we have today says if God says it's right it's right and if God says it's wrong it's wrong and if God was to move against his word then he would have to declare that what he said was not true but truth is the very essence of God he is the he is the source of Truth and and of all knowledge and and these different things so when God says it he cannot go against it because he would make himself to be a liar and we know what he he it says in the Scripture it says God is not a man that he should lie it says neither the son of man that he should repent ha he said and shall he not do it in other words When God says it God binds himself to what he has said that's our trust this evening that's our rest this evening is that he has said it therefore I can trust and rest that he's going to do it and it says or have he spoken and shall he not make it good amen we can disappoint ourselves we can disappoint our families our children our spouses uh people around us because we promis something and then we find out we can't do it and even in our good intentions when we said it we find out we can't do it and we can't make good on our promise he says God is not like this God never leaves you hanging God will do it if he said he would do it so therefore the Holy Spirit which is the very spirit of God in our lives it cannot contradict the word of God Jesus said and we've read this many services before he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth so the leadership of the holy spirit will take you into truth rather than out of or contrary to truth amen that's what it's supposed to do he says he shall not speak of himself whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come in John 17:17 Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so we cannot claim to be led by the spirit of God and be in contradiction to the word of God impossible we can claim it but it ain't true it's impossible for God to lead us that way amen the very purpose we see here the very ident identification of the holy spirit in your life is it will lead you into the word not not away from it and not certainly not contradictory to it amen he leads us into all truth our leadership will align with the word of God if we have the spirit of God inside of us listen to this quote he says but God knows what he's doing as long as he's leading see so many times we get into a bind and we get into a bind because it wasn't God that led us it was that we thought God was leading us cuz we didn't check our leadership with the word of God and then pretty soon we get into a bind and we say what's going on and then we go check it with the word we realize oh my goodness I wasn't following the leadership of the lord we can't presume we can't presume we can know so much and yet miss the leading of God he says you see you must always go by the spirit listen Church lots of people claim they're led by the spirit that's not hard to claim I was telling somebody recently people it's a amazing what church has come to I'm not talking our church by God's grace I was telling telling someone the other day I said I saw a church where they called up a bunch of people to the front as a representation of their congregation and one of them was a group of drag queens called The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence that's a POS that that that is that is the desolation of abominate the abomination of desolation was that what it was in the church and that's what they have turned the service into is a worship of themselves and theyve made themselves to be something worthy of worship and of accolades and recognition can you imagine the sisters of Perpetual Indulgence how has it Fallen what grip does Satan have on the nominal churches today they're worshiping him and they don't even know it and they claim to be Spirit L church you can claim all you want but the proving time has come it says and the spirit will always agree with the word he says now if the spirit leads you contrary to word to the word then it's not the spirit of God I'm not going to sugarcoat this this evening if it's contrary to the word I don't care what your condition is you may be a child of God but if it's contrary to the word it's not the spirit of God that's leading you impossible listen we can come under other influences you can be filled with the spirit of God and come under another influence by choice by choice listen if I turn to my spirit rather than his spirit it's not the spirit of God I can turn to my own thinking my own desires my own opinions and follow that leadership and it is anti chist Church his spirit is the only thing that has perfect leaders ership in our lives he says then it's not the spirit of God now if the holy spirit's leading you it'll say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see too often people say well the Bible doesn't say I can't listen there's not enough pages in this world to tell us all the things that we aren't supposed to do or that we are supposed to do maybe but I've said this before amen it's the if what you're doing is keeping you from doing what the scripture says you should do then it's wrong because what it's doing is it's putting that in preeminence ahead of what the word of God says you're supposed to do so if you want to judge where you're at this evening in your life amen don't look at whether it's right or wrong in itself Paul said there's nothing there's nothing that's wrong of itself but if the impact of it is that it keeps you from doing what the word says then for you it is wrong in that aspect listen we can have our Hobbies we can have our hunting we can have our Sports we can have our work whatever it might be if that is holding us back from doing what the word says it is out of preeminence in our life it's in a place it ought not to be and it is wrong in that place we're not going to sugarcoat things this evening amen we have to judge ourselves by what the word tells us to do and if we're not doing what the word tells us to do by doing something that it doesn't say we can't do we're still wrong and we need to bring that back into preeminence amen remember what caus people to miss the marriage supper do you remember the parable Church why did Jesus give us Parables to teach us a lesson one of them had a new wife what's wrong with a new wife Brothers nothing's wrong with a new wife a new wife is a perfect wife one of them had a new he had a new car he had a new team of oxin he had a new tractor what's wrong with a new team of oxen nothing one of them had bought a new piece of land what's wrong with the new piece of land nothing but it's the preeminence they placed on it that kept them from the marriage supper and they lost their Eternal reward because they put something in preeminence above what they should have that's it check the impact don't check the legality only listen if the scripture says don't do it then don't do it there's no excuse for that but if it doesn't say anything about it say what impact is this going to have on what it tells me to do and if it's going to bring that above what God tells you to do by his word it's wrong because the effect is wrong but we opened up with this tragic scene in Calvary and I call it tragic because the prince of Glory died that's tragic it was needful but it was tragic but I want to show how God moves in these phases and this idea of him condescending remember he was revealed as Jehovah the father God above us and he gave us only the old Covenant the law of Moses that God had made with Mankind and then God comes down himself and he dwells within a man the human body of Jesus and he reveals himself in sunship then and he fulfills that contract he comes down and does what we could not do that's another thing you'll see as we move through this idea the condescension of God he does what we can't do he does what we've been trying to do and what we've been wanting done but then he comes down and he's the one that does it as we said before if we could do it we'd have done it by now but we can't but God moves in phases and we see this in the condescending of God when we look in the Book of Genesis God's in his creator phase and his speaking phase and so he speaks things into his existence and he brings man into a body and then he sits back and he just lets things unfold and we know what happens there is that Humanity falls in the garden by Adam and Eve and now God has to moved to another phase and his next phase is a covenant it's a law it's a contract but it was not a law of life it was a law of sin and death that was the next phase amen it told you what to do and what not to do and if you did what you weren't supposed to do you died and if you didn't do what you were supposed to do you died it was a law of sin and death there was nothing good in that law there was no life in it there was no rest in it because nobody could live perfectly there was nothing there that brought satisfaction there was nothing there it condemned you and it judged you even if nobody else knew that you'd done it you know You' done it and so all it could do it was con it condemn you and so it was it was a Grace of sorts because under that law there was an atonement that could be made there was an innocent life that could be shed to cover up your less than innocent life and it was blood that would cover us for those things amen but it was an imperfect atonement and so it was imperfect law in and of itself and then Christ came down to fulfill that law he didn't come away to come to do away with it as we said per se or to or or to to say it was wrong but he came to satisfy it that's what it meant to fulfill it he came to satisfy the contract with God to where a perfect sacrifice could make a perfect atonement so that now we can move into the next phase of God's condescension of God's Plan of Redemption amen that perfect atonement is once and for all it's a finished work it's a completely finished work there's nothing more that's required of us today amen church let me say it this way at Calvary God's requirement was met completely you have nothing you need to do today to satisfy God there's nothing you can do to satisfy God what we do today see back then it was works today your works are an offering they're a sacrifice there's something we give out of love and appreciation they are not a requirement they're expected because as a Believer you are expected to live a life amen but now we've moved on to an offering of life rather than an offering of works okay so watch now we're going to go back to our opening scripture as we look at this shift from phase to phase of God's condescending tied in with his Redemption plan and it says here I must have skipped it right yes for when we were in the flesh we're talking about that law of sin and death when we were in theh the Motions of sin which were by the law remember what what we know that without the law there's no sin if we don't have a law that says you're not allowed to run through a stoplight then it's okay to run through a stoplight so until the law came there's no saying our lives weren't judged until the law came but as soon as the law is there now it's judged amen and though so out of that law it did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death that's why I said under the first law there was no life all it could produce was death and condemn ation but now we look at John 19 and this was our opening scripture it says Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished in other words he's done everything that was required of him to satisfy the contract he lived a perfect life he was recognized by God as being acceptable he stepped into his mediatorial position or or his his salvational uh position right and now watch what he does does at the very end there's one thing left to do and I was reading in my devotions this morning Luke 18 and Jesus said that he was going down to Jerusalem that all things that were written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished Jesus was going down knowing that every word that was written about him was going to be accomplished the good and the bad he had to take the bad before he could get the good are you listening to me this evening you got to take the bad before you can take the good we're looking for the victory but we skip the battle can't do it Church we're going to get into that a little bit later this evening amen but he says and then he comes down to the very end and everything that was required of him he's done except there's one little scripture he has to fulfill and it's back in the Book of Psalms and then he says he says I'm thirsty and what did they do they give him vinegar and it fulfills what David wrote In in the Psalms and it's the last thing he had to fulfill and then he said it is finished he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost God condescending in that dispensation of sunship revealing himself in a human body came down with one purpose to finish the law to fulfill the law amen and as soon as he did that through Christ in that flesh form he left the flesh form but behind that flesh form was never used it's done we may not think that but we'll show you that by the scripture why because that phase is finished and now there's a stepping into a new phase of what God's going to be doing with us remember now in the Garden of Gethsemane all things were given into jesus' hand that Son of God born as Adam was born born by the spirit sinless flesh was given a choice a free will choice and of his own free will he says I'll drink of that cup if it's according to your will and he did and he sacrificed everything he had he sacrificed his body his reputation his flesh he sacrificed everything that he had for you and I of his own free will to the word of God and in doing so he became the perfect atonement to satisfy the law and one and done that's what he was It was a one in one the price was paid it satisfied the wrath of God Paul would say it this way in Romans 5 he says therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation how fair is that church Adam and Eve fail and you and I have to go through what we go through tonight Paul says one person's mistake got us here that ain't Fair it isn't fair but guess what God balances the unfair watch what he says now he says even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men under justification of Life praise the Lord he balanced the unfairness with another unfairness CU it wasn't fair that Christ took my place but he did and he gave it of his own free will and so I get here I got here by unfairness but I'm here today by another unfairness that balanced the scales of Justice amen praise the Lord that he took it on himself he did not say this isn't fair oh anybody have kids what do kids dwell on unfairness they're the perfect ones to talk about un uh uh a lack of Justice aren't they kids know when it's unfair I'm seeing all the parents grinning and all the kids saying who me we know when it's unfair listen God has God God makes sure it all comes out it all works out Amen brother Grant it'll all work out amen we have have a rest in those things but through one justification of life amen it's a free gift I was reading the other day brother Ram said you won't go to hell because you're a sinner you'll go to hell because you're a rejector of the free gift that's it that's it cuz the price was paid you've just got to take it remember but the law has established that a pardon is not a pardon until you accept that pardon and so if you don't accept the free gift the pardon of Calvary that's your fault not his fault and you'll go to hell in your sins he for he said for as by one man man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover he says the law entered that the offense might abound notice that the law wasn't here to raise us up the law was here to push us down can I put it this way the law was what we deserved he says but Hallelujah where sin abounded Grace did much more abound man we could probably do some preaching on Grace I heard a brother preach a service on Grace the other day and I so enjoyed it I wish I could have brought him over and had him preach that same service for us here this is the kind of Grace that we have church where sin did abound Grace did much more abound amen there's a song that I listen to it says what I earned is not what I got that's what Grace is what I deserve is not what I've got today I've got something else and it's the unmar favor of almighty God he says that as Sin reigned unto death the wages of sin is death even so my grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord the wages of Grace is what we don't deserve and yet we get it what is it eternal life through Jesus Christ the wages of Grace is eternal life here's a the thing with Grace you get it but you don't earn it so it's not a wage it's a free gift there is no wages with with Grace it's a free gift what you don't deserve you get anyways he paid the price he gets to determine what happens listen to this he says but when Jesus died at Calvary he settled the sin question forever forever we don't have to sit here and wonder does he see my sin he can't it's covered by the perfect shed blood of Jesus Christ he cannot see sin we're not going to get into this this service there's so much more coming I can't wait to preach it about how God sees us when we think we sin let me tell you a little secret tonight he can't see it he can't see it he can't see it amen it's a beautiful thing when we can see things through God's eyes we've got a message that'll open our eyes to the way that God these things but I want you to see something that Calvary was not just paying the price Calvary was opening the door Calvary was opening the door to Redemption Paul said in Romans 5 as we just read that by The Obedience of one person many shall be made righteous many will find Grace many will find Healing they'll find a place of rest and comfort there's a place where that longing of our heart can be satisfied it was Christ the open door that opened that path back to God again listen to this he says finally one day that's the day of Calvary there was one came down from Glory one by the name of Jesus Christ the son of God who came from glory and Calvary was formed that was the day that the price was paid and the sin question was settled forever he says and it opened up the way unto this thing that we're hungering and thirsting for what it's not just going to satisfy everything it's opening up a way that will satisfy our hunger and our thirst because there's more to C more to this life there's more to this Christian walk than just Calvary we'll cover it in a little bit he says there it opened up the this way into this thing that we're hungry and thirsting for it brought a place of satisfaction there's no man that's ever visited Calvary and seen it the way it was that can never be the same everything he ever desired or longed for is met when he reaches that place Cal Calgary Calvary Calgary doesn't do it calvary removes the weight it removes the stain it remain it removes the guilt it it it brings that acceptance of our longing to be in the presence of God I'll never forget the day that I met Christ when I gave my life to him because I walked in Feeling So Unworthy and so dirty and so unable to stand in his presence that all I could say was God forgive me God forgive me God forgive me but when he washed me clean church that's a feeling that I could never ever replicate with anything else the satisfaction of knowing I've been set free from my past from my present and from my future is a feeling that this world will never give you people are seeking that sort of release through the relationships they have the drugs they take the alcohol the entertainment the Hobbies whatever it might be there's nothing can satisfy like a true a and real relationship with Jesus Christ nothing will do it but Calvary was not the be all and end all it was the start of the be all and end all there's no other starting place except Calvary this message is not the starting place you've got to have an acceptance of the finished work of Calvary you've got to know that you've been cleansed from your sins before he can ever do anything else with you with this truth truth that we have it's not a church it's not a denomination it's a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that's what he's doing in the next phase of his work the foundation of this whole church is built on the Church of the Living God is that Jesus Christ it's the revealing of Christ remember God was known as Jehovah in the Old Testament now there's this change of dispensation as it goes from father to son and now God is revealing himself under a new name it's the same God all along when you look at at Hebrews 11 in the faith chapter remember what it said of Moses he says choosing to suffer what the reproach of whom Christ it didn't say Jehovah it said Christ why because that is the revealed name of God throughout the whole thing remember what the prophet of God said he says go back and read your Bible from start to end and if you can't see whom Christ in every page go read it again it was Christ it was God revealing himself through Christ the entire way amen but now he's coming in and he's revealing himself as the Lord Jesus Christ and if you didn't catch the shift from Jehovah to Christ you would stay dead in your sins that that sounds scary but it's true because if you continue to go and you continue to serve Jehovah under the law of Moses you completely missed the perfect atonement that had been made and all you had to do was accept the perfect atonement God you could go there and sacrifice sheep after sheep and cow after cow and turtle dove after turtle dove and God would got not recognize it because he had shifted he had fulfilled the contract there's nothing you could do anymore except except the finished work of Calvary you had to see the changing of God's phases in his word and his plan and what he was doing in these things you've got to move with God as he reveals himself and most of them didn't unfortunately and so that's why he turned to the Gentiles we know this remember what John said he says if we if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses his son cleanses us from all sin you say I can't go back to Calvary yes you've got to go back to Calvary like I said there is no other starting place except Calvary it's the open door I mean John repeated it in in Revelation 5 4 5 there's an open door come up a little higher it's Christ you've got to start there amen but you see as we move into the New Testament and Paul starts to preach and John and Peter and these things they did not stay at Calvary but they moved da because they said yes your sins can be forgiven but the life of that blood has to come into you to take you all the way down this road that's been opened up through the door that is Christ that Calvary is a starting place but remember what Paul says we've got to move past those first Works a baptism and repentance and this and that and the other thing and you got to move on into Perfection right and that is only by the spirit it is not by works amen we've got to be able to move past those things yes it's wonderful to be clean but we've got to move from just being clean to being a new creation lots of people are accepting the blood because it's such a wonderful feeling but you got to keep going as he is in the light so that you can receive the life that was in that blood cuz that's the only thing that'll give us a new birth I was reading there where brother Bram says in uh when when he's talking about uh those that are Before the Throne in Revelation 7 and he says you've got to realize that there's a mixed crowd there there's a bride that's there and there is also a a a um a foolish virgin that's there and they have to be purged in the tribulation because they didn't go all the way that's what happens when you don't go all the way they could never receive the spirit because they turn down the word ins sincerity and so they give their lives in the Great Tribulation we give our lives now in surrender to the word and in doing so we receive the spirit amen Church god holds us accountable for what he tells us and we can like it or not like it but that doesn't change that it's his word and he holds us accountable for whatever he brings our way listen we can say my pastor Don't Preach it that way my church doesn't preach it that way the world doesn't preach it that way church it's a straight and narrow way and few there be that find it most people aren't going to like it and most will be offended by it I was listening today at the very end of spoken words The Original Seed and brother Braham says at the end they will shut you down he says and then God will come down and prove who's who because they can't abide the truth so they will shut you down if you're not a part of an accepted denomination they will shut you down they're already starting to do these things over in Europe they're going to do it over here too it'll be a backlash against all the things that are going on we're getting close but remember if all you take is the blood but not the life of the blood it's a halfway job because you're not born again you're clean but you're not born again that's a work of the spirit the cleaning but it's not the spirit itself amen the blood cleanses but it takes the life of that blood blood to cause us to be a new creation and live the way that Christ did listen to this he says but if but you'll never be satisfied until you know him as the Forgiveness of your sins where the sin question is settled like I said that's a wonderful feeling when you know your sins are forgiven that's a wonderful feeling and most people stop there because it's a wonderful feeling but to the TR child of God there's a Hunger for More I believe that he says where the sin question is settled and then that beautiful word and you have that lovely peaceful quiet eternal Everlasting fellowship with him remember to have fellowship with him you need a new heart you need a new spirit just to get along with him and then his Spirit comes into you he says when the peace of God that passes all understanding has Sanctified your soul and has made you a new creature in Christ Jesus joining Church won't do it that's only perverting the real cause if the devil can't get you out on those things and he's talking about worldly pleasures he'll take you to this other which is what man-made religion he'll get you to join a church and make you think you're saved there's only one way to get into the body of Christ and that's by one Spirit we're baptized into that body 1 Corinthians 12 it's by it's by the holy spirit in your life it is not writing your name on a book it's not by Church attendance it's not by being affiliated with a group it's by the spirit of God making you a new creature creature in Christ it's the only way that's why we don't have a membership book here let me tell you this you'll know when you're a part of this church amen because your spirit will agree with the people that's here he says but don't settle for nothing less than an oldfashioned experience of the new birth to be born again of the spirit of the Eternal God and catch this he says when your soul and God unite together and you become one I want to show how this transitions now for this last half of this service remember God coming down revealing himself through Christ and he closes that chapter on the law of Moses on the Old Testament the old Covenant and then there's a short period of time when Christ dies and remember he goes down into hell and he preaches to the souls that are in prison and then after that he shifts into a new phase and Jesus foreshadowed it with his disciples before his death and we've read this before but I'll read it again for the sake of completeness he says I'll pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever Christ was a comfort to them remember when they're in the ship and the wind's blowing they say you know we're going to die if you don't do something and he stands up and he says peace be still they went from being completely uncomfortable to completely comforted he was the comforter and he says he's going to give you another comforter and it sounds like it's somebody different he says who's it going to be even the spirit of Truth the Holy Spirit whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwells with you presently and shall be in you in the future then he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I is a personal pronoun same person same God different way okay it's a different phase that's coming and it'll be something completely new to the family of God it'll have an effect of comfort and other things as we'll see but it'll be the same person he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live this is the I am the everpresent unchanging one because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you this is the perfect Unity of the bride with Christ they're all part of the same body we've said it before you can't be a part of God if you weren't always a part of God you don't become a child of God you always were a child of God and all you are is born again so that you can be revealed that way amen but this new dispensation this new phase this new era coming will finalize itself in perfect imp perfect Unity between God and man that's what this next phase is going to be so Christ raises from the dead on the third day and it seems like he's in the same body but the thing is they don't recognize him he's that little bit different isn't he he's similar but he's not the same and their eyes can't tell who he is it seems like it's the same phase cuz it's Christ interacting with creation but you've got to realize something he's in a different body now he's not subject to the laws like he was before of this Earth think of it when God condescended now with the law of Moses the the law that he gave to Moses he revealed the highest level of spirituality and that highest level was works that was it works that was as far as you could go that's what that's what held them in place dos and don'ts it was legalism it was a law right but it was God's ordained law and that was the way to keep them out from under judgment and I've been reading in my devotions I'm trying to get through my entire Bible this year and so I'm reading through things that maybe we wouldn't read so much you know Micah and NM naam's all focused on the on the destruction of Nineveh has nothing to do with me but there's some beautiful little verses in there but it struck me as I'm reading through all these things because after David goes off the scene what you see is people that fail in the D and don'ts and so God has to judge them according to the law and he's brutal they die they get put into slavery their homes get destroyed people take their stuff they go away for 70 years it's just up and down and in and out and serving this one and then get a victory and then serving one and get a victory it's this constant cycle of slavery and freedom why CU God's Bound by his word and when they stopped doing the dos and they started doing the don'ts God had to judge them and it's incredible how how Swift and how complete God's judgment was but now when he comes down in Christ what's he doing now he's showing the next phase he's showing the potential he's showing the purpose of the next phase and when he comes down in Christ he reveals the highest level of spirituality which is Unity I and my father are one I can do nothing except the father shows me first it's complete surrender to God to where you and him are one and he shows that amen he was the perfect example of what was coming and in that form he was Bridging the the the law and Grace he was standing in the Gap and he was closing that Gap so that as he fulfilled the law he would immediately step in to show what Grace was going to look like and he did everything the law required in that body not by force not by fear but by Perfect surrender to the will of God of his own free will he chose to Humble himself to obey that spirit of God that was inside of him and in many ways he was living in two dispensations at the same time there was a blending that was happening he was foreshadowing what was coming while fulfilling what was behind that's what he was doing all at the same time he was F he was showing us the perfect submission of a child of God that's filled with the spirit he's showing the full potential amen but when he's Rising now from the dead what's he doing he's showing us the end of all of that Unity he's showing what comes to a person that is submitted to the spirit and what is it it's a glorified body he's standing there in a perfect glorified body he can appear and he can disappear at will he can be one minute 100 miles there and the next minute he's over there he can travel like a thought does that sound familiar he's now interacting with this world but he's not bound by this world the laws of this well don't apply to him he can go through a solid wall and appear he's in it but he's not of it that's what's going on Amen he's in it but he's not subject to those laws and so in those 33 and A2 years of his life he's showing the whole process of what Grace is going to look like where God will condescend into human flesh and he'll bring them into perfect unity and restore them back to their original position that's what he was showing he was showing us the surrender the humility the obedience and the pain and the suffering and the rejection that comes with that but he also showed us the healing he showed us the Deliverance he showed us the victory he showed us the overcoming he showed us the authority that came when you submitted yourself to the things of God he showed us the whole picture because our life is going to match his and if we can see where he went through the hardships then we can also see that the victory is coming on the other side of it as well everything that is available to us today by the baptism of of the Holy Spirit was revealed in Christ in its Perfection remember what Paul would say in Romans 8 he said for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that who he who Christ that Christ might be the firstborn among many brethren in other words there's many more children there's many more Sons coming just like Jesus he's the first of a long line of people just like him that's the next phase of the condescension of God Amen it'll be the same people in the same image doing the same works by The Same Spirit that's what he's showing what's happening there Jesus Christ is the template for you and I cut from the same cloth we're just a portion instead of the whole thing but we're Cut From the Same Cloth it's the same work that's going on Jesus would say so many times he shared so much with the disciples about what was going to happen and yet they had no clue as to the changes now some of that I think was perhaps because they thought they had it I mean what more could you ask for signs and wonders uh sicknesses go away demons flee the dead are raised you've got a message what more could you want but the scripture also says that their their understanding was was was hidden from the truth they couldn't see it God held it because it wasn't that time yet and Jesus remember what he said before he died he says I've got a lot more to tell you but you can't handle it yet you need the spirit of God before you can handle this so what you got is not enough you might have power and authority in a great ministry and signs and wonders but that's not the be all and end all the be all and end all is Unity with God a restored relationship with him remember what Jesus said he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father we've taught it before it doesn't mean you'll do things that are super Superior to him greater that way is that there'll be numerically more cuz Christ only really had his works for 3 and A2 years one man and though he did thousands and thousands of Miracles now you got 2,000 years stretching in front of him with maybe millions of Believers filled with the spirit there's going to be more Works done by millions but notice what he says the next phase is that you step into my role whoa okay now now we're getting down to what he really wants to talk about you've got to keep doing what I've been doing all along and they would maybe say but Lord we've been doing it all along the demons they they obey us sicknesses flee the dead are raised what more could we want that ain't it it's perfect surrender and Leadership by God that's it that's it that's what will take us in church and that's what we're going to get into perfect surrender amen while he was here there were great things that happened but he wanted to step into a greater relationship with us while he was here great signs and wonders happened while God even condescended his father in that Pillar of Fire in the Old Testament wonderful things happened great signs and wonders but you ever notied church that having him with you is never enough It's never enough because as soon as he leaves we lose the effect of his presence we let me put it this way even when he's with us sometimes we lose the effect of his presence because of our lack of faith that's what he'd say to the disciples they come to him and say what are we going to do what are we going to do how are we going to deal with this and he say oh ye a little faith and then he'd handle the situation he was right there and yet their faith was not where it needed to be but when he's there it's great and when he's there the circumstances change but the problem is the people never change only the circumstances and we know that circumstances never stay the same we've said it before you get healed you're going to get sick again you get Victory today you're going to be in a battle tomorrow maybe you lose listen hardships might go away today and they'll be back tomorrow it's guaranteed that's what living in a sinful world does habits will come back and cling to us difficult decisions will cause us to compromise there's Victory when he's here but when he leaves what happens to the victory it goes and our peace and our goes with it amen David knew this that's why David said my one desire is to be in his temple in his presence that's the thing I got to do because when I'm in his presence that's when I get what I need and as soon as I'm not then things start to fall apart David say this in psalm 16 he says I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved when he's there nothing nothing can touch me but take him away and we become like any other man just like Samson take him away church and we will fall just like every other person in this world Falls then he says Thou wi show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more the law could never get you in God's presence all the time it was occasional listen you could pray and he might come down and answer you but he had to go away he could not stay there amen we remember we read that quote he could be around us he could be with us temporarily he could even put an anointing on us but he could not dwell in us there could not be a permanence that was in there it was always a temporary thing we read this quote last service I want to remind us he couldn't enter into sin that was the problem under the law he said but he cleared his way as he went for God so loved man that he wants to come down in fellowship with him God tonight the same Jehovah God that spoke to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden lives in every born again man or woman trying his best to make you believe him have faith in him step out don't you doubt one bit so what's the phase change that's needed what's the transformation what's the condescension that needed God above us that was okay it helped us God With Us that was even better but we need him to come in us that's the condescension we need Church that's the Fulfillment of Ezekiel 36 that's is the Fulfillment of Joel 2:28 and that's to get us from the temporary to the permanent that's what we needed amen just consider what God had to do to Humble himself to come down and dwell amongst us in the body of Christ to come down and be rejected and spit on and beat and persecuted and lied about to be completely destroyed by those that he came to save how much did God had to Condes had to condescend to do that but now let's take him and put him into sinful flesh how much more does he have to Humble himself listen on my best day on your best day we are completely unworthy to stand in his presence much less to have him live inside of us remember what the prophet God said he says no man standing in the presence of God can judge another man because you're too caught up in how unworthy you are in his true presence amen can you imagine bring it down to our level asking King Charles to come and live in a dirty soggy cardboard box in an alley in George Street that's about as close as I can get to God coming down and living in my life even as a child of God because compared to his absolute Holiness Perfection and righteousness were all his filthy rigs perverted disgusting unacceptable that's it and yet he promised I'll come down and do it you talk about God condescending Church you talk about God condescending God said I'll do it I'll put my spirit within them I will live in these people doesn't come in while we're dirty that's what the blood's for that's what the works of Grace are for that's what justification is for to take away your sins and then sanctification is to clean up your life he won't come in while you're dirty he's got to clean up your life he'll take away everything that is unsuited for him and then when it's cleaned and ready for service what does he do he says this is my beloved child in whom I'm pleased to dwell and then he steps into your life you have the same experience that Christ did on the River Jordan church when he steps in he's saying you are acceptable to me that he can take a filthy person like me and say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell that's what he does when he puts the spirit inside every child of God he says you're accepted you're acceptable you're good enough not because of my works that's the work of the blood and that's the work of the spirit in each and every one of our Lives amen church if God's willing to put up with us I think we can probably put up with each other a little more than we do sometimes and we can put up with ourselves as well I've said it before I believe that the closer you get to God the greater critic you become of yourself you stop pointing so much at other people because you're looking at your own life and saying God change me I believe that's a sign of immature believer but listen we can get a lot of Hang-Ups in this flesh I don't know if anybody gets Hang-Ups I get Hang-Ups I'm glad they're not hangovers but sometimes they can turn into spiritual hangovers because something happens and we fail ourselves and we fail God and we can sit there and say am I even a child of God and then we say am I an overcomer let me tell you one thing you always were a child of God that was decided way before you made your mistake you always were and you always will be that doesn't change are you living the life of an overcomer maybe not some days maybe not some days I don't feel like an overcomer but listen when you're in the middle of the battle there's no overcoming all there is is fighting it may be a day where you fought and some days we take steps back some days we hold our ground and some days we take steps forward don't worry about the winning and the losing worry about the fighting stay in the battle cuz sometimes we've been fighting for so long we don't lose we just lay down our weapon and we say I'm sick and tired of fighting I'm sick and tired of dealing with this cuz things can build up I I meant to mention brother Nelson guy before service you talk about a man that's in a battle every part of his body's giving him problems these days and you know how much he loves to be out in the woods and he's stuck in his house on his couch CU he can't walk he can't be around he's so beat up his body is just failing him in so many ways keep him in prayer keep him in prayer but everything is just building up on him and it's hard to fight every single day without anything that seems to be happening seems like nothing's going on I'm not making any progress fight anyways fight anyways be good soldiers fight anyways because listen victory's coming victory's coming our part church is to resist scripture doesn't say resist the devil and you'll win the battle it says resist and he'll end up fleeing but it's not by my spirit it's by his spirit it's not by my power it's by his power it's not by my works it's going to be by his Works amen sometimes our life isn't overcoming If we're honest sometimes we slip and fall say I might as well stop stop don't stop scripture says a righteous man falls seven times and gets up again we all fall we all fail get up and keep going he said if there's no battle then there's no Victory if I walked out today I'm a car guy and there's a brand new Ferrari there and the keys were in it and I got in and took the keys that Ferrari and drove away where's the victory I'm winning at life some might say but there's no Victory I didn't do anything to deserve it I didn't do anything to earn it that's not a victory that's a gift but you want a victory there's got to be a battle that comes first you got to have a part in that to have a victory I've always wondered you know in sports you got some guys that are on a team but they never come off the bench and then they win the championship that's got to be one of the hollow things for an athlete is you win a championship you never played for there no Victory without a battle he says but you've got to have a battle to have Victory if it was just given to you it wouldn't be a victory but he that overcometh is the one who has the victory so Jesus came to Earth he had a battle he won the Victory and tonight we have a battle and with Christ we can have the victory Christ was trying to tell the disciples there's change coming you think you've got it you don't got it there's something coming that's greater than anything you've received any Ministry you've had and he gifts signs wonders there's a Plan of Redemption that's in in motion now and the revealing of God is going to change the condescending of God is going to change he says I'm going away and I'm coming back it'll be me but it won't be the same me that you saw LEF I'll be in a different form remember we read this earlier as we start to close he said yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me and because I live you shall live also what is it now we're coming into a law of life not a law of sin and death it's a law of life because I live you shall live also the law that we have is if the spirit's in us we live and the way that we live is because of that spirit it's a law of life it's a law of Liberty it's a law of Grace it's a law of Freedom it's a law of restoration Paul would say it this way in Romans 8 he says for the law of the spirit of Life Paul had talked about the law uh of sin and death now he says we've got a new law and it's a law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death amen notice it's not the law of the spirit of the death of Jesus Christ it's the law of the spirit of Life see you got to take everything from Calvary not just the death you need the life that came afterwards cuz that's the law that we're living under is the spir is the law of the spirit of the Life of Christ not just the blood of Christ you get it amen if he never Rose from the grave we'd be no further ahead today because we need the same life and the life had to prove itself it had to show that it had conquered death hell and the grave because that's the exact same thing it's got to do in you and I but you know what I see when I read this he says the law of the spirit of life has made me free from the law of sin and death that means today if you're in bondage something in you is illegal because you got a law the spirit of life that makes you free so if you got something that's binding you remember brother Bram says he says you call the sheriff of the Holy Spirit and it'll deal with what's holding you back in your life cuz you now got a light a law of life and Liberty not a law of sin and death so if you've got sin and death reigning it has to come subject to this because this is the law we're under now the law of Freedom amen what is this last one it's the condescension of God It's the final condescension of God it's God in us it's God using us it'll be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's what Hebrews 13:7 and8 say considering the conversation the life of those that have authority over you their life shows Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not our works now it's his work it's not our power it's his power it's not our Authority it's his authority it's not just an anointing it's the Supreme anointing amen it'll be God condescending one final time living in a people producing Christ all over again and it'll be the Bride of Jesus Christ watch this as we close now he says for we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us in other words we know our limits as Samuel says there are limits we have limits we have limits of patience rest trust strength we've got limits he says God's us losing a vessel that has obvious limitations so that we know it ain't me it's him that's where you're sitting this evening in these Earth and vessels with the very power of almighty God dwelling inside of you so that we know that the power is his not ours we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair see the condition s have not changed under this New Covenant who's changed church we have persecuted but not forsaken see the under the the the the old Covenant when they were persecuted it was because they were out of the good graces of God they had messed up now Paul says we're persecuted but that doesn't mean we're forsaken it has nothing to do with our spiritual condition we're persecuted because we're children of God not because we've disobeyed necessarily he says we're cast down but we're not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body what is it it's the law of the spirit of Life of Christ Jesus manifesting itself in you and I he says now holy God could not condone sin so nothing could touch the mountain where God was then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood to us through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us it changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit he says then we become into the divine nature of God and then we become a dwelling place for God God is not just with us now but this is the final condescension where he says I am you and you are me you have my nature you have my attributes you have my mind and you are surrendered to all of those things we become a dwelling place for God he said Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you and you and me know how that God is in his church he says the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yet a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he says there it is carrying on his work next service we're going to look at what that looks like what is the effect of the spirit on the believer that final Dwelling Place of God and I want to dig deep into what Paul said Paul I mean it's not Paul it's the Holy Spirit speaking through Paul but Paul could give us such a perfect understanding of what it's like to live in this flesh and to live in the spirit at the same time and to understand the frustrations and the failings that come with these bodies were Bound in and yet be Sons and Daughters of God the manifested word yet in the conditions we're in sometimes like I said it's so easy to get hung up on this flesh and our mind and the things we battle like I said just keep fighting our role is to keep fighting it's up to God to bring the victory Paul fought and sometimes Paul won and sometimes Paul lost Peter fought sometimes he won sometimes he lost but get back up and keep fighting amen none of us wins every battle but I I want you to see tonight from the Eternal we've already won that's the beauty of it like brother Hank Snow said to me he says listen the script already is already written the play is already done and we're just going through our parts right now that old song I've read the back of the book and we win God's already got us in a place of Victory with a prize with an inheritance a position he's got everything planned waiting for us all we have to do keep fighting how do you you keep fighting Church stay with the word that's it stay with the word that's how we fight we wrestle not against flesh and blood we're not fighting against people we're not fighting against situations it's a spiritual warfare and so you got to fight with a spiritual weapon and the only thing you need is the word of God Amen quickened by the spirit one last scripture as we close he says who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter anybody been killed all the day long recently brother Grant you've been killed all the day long recently sometimes it feels like you're getting killed over and over again sometimes it's Death By A Thousand Cuts By A th paper cuts right isn't it just that where it's just aggravation on aggravation things poking trying to get a response out of you trying to get you to lose your temper trying to get you to lose your faith trying to take away your peace trying to take away your rest trying to put in questions that nobody can answer one thing after or another killed all the day long he says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us church I don't even know how to explain what more than conquerors means listen either you're a winner or you're a loser he says you're more than a winner I don't I can't even Define that I don't know how you can be more than something that is top dog but he says whatever it is you're more than it you're beyond Victory you're beyond Victory you're beyond just winning and losing maybe the fact is it's because we've already won we've been made more than conquerors through him that loved us and he says for I'm persuaded he asked do all these things separates he says I'm persuaded that neither death nor life sometimes it feels like death would be a welcome rest if you've ever really been in a trial sometimes it seems like Lord just take me and let me go to perfect peace if you know you're a child of God if you know you've been sealed with the spirit it shouldn't matter if we go tomorrow and sometimes it seems like that would be better than dealing with the struggles and the trials of this life he says listen death won't separate us life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor governments nor Trump nor Trudeau nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth David said if I go to the depths of the sea you're there if I go up to the highest of heights you're there if I go to the depths of the sea you're there even the darkness can hide nothing from you and with your hand you'll lead me he says nor things present nor things to come how often do we borrow tomorrow's troubles and bring them into today he says nor height nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen God bless you let's stand this evening amen Church we're in a wonderful wonderful place today when you consider the condescension of God to live inside of us when you look at the potential that lies within you it's a resurrecting power it's a rapturing power it's a body changing power it's a healing power it's a saving power it's a leading power it's a providing power it's a resting power everything you have need of is inside of you if you've got the Holy Spirit what's the thing that clogs it up Life Time commitments we need to take time you know I have to study a lot to preach of course sometimes I can rely on that you know I I have my own little devotion book where I write down things that strike me in the scriptures as I'm reading them in personal devotions but sometimes I go and it's been four days since I've had my actual Bible reading for devotions personally I may have studied but that personal devotion time to just sit down and let God deal with you you know and I find if I miss that I start to struggle even with all the studying that hours and hours of of preaching studying that I do but when I leave that time just for him that's where I tend to get the big breakthroughs because I'm giving him time to clear out those channels to answer those questions to take things to him and leave them there to lay them before him you know I've got questions I've talked many times and and I read the the the thing that answer that question about how do we get to from 30-fold to 60-fold to 100-fold in the kingdom of God and then I finally get an answer and it's surrender but I've asked that question for months but all of a sudden what does he do he gives you an answer and it takes us being still and it's one thing I've noticed so much I don't know if this is if this is the way it works for everyone maybe it's different for preachers but all I know is if I can get quiet things start to come to me if you just get quiet and start to let God work I'm not sure why I'm saying this this evening but if you'll just sit quiet quietly and dwell on the things of God I find it just starts to come to you and then you can open your Bible you can go to prayer and things just start to come together and that peace you're looking for that rest that answer that direction whatever it might be it just starts to come there but it takes that time to just sit down and say God will you talk to me for a bit sometimes we just want to do all the Talking sometimes we need to just sit down and say Lord what would you have your servant to know I'm standing in the need of prayer Lord I've asked now it's time for me to do some listening and I find without fail he comes down and he starts to talk and all of a sudden those things I'm looking for start to become clear and situations start to resolve it's not that circumstances change it's that my feelings about it my opinions of it my thoughts about it my Approach my attitude attitude starts to change why cuz he's right here here he's right here I don't have to bring him down then I when we get quiet Church what we're doing is we're letting him come out that's all we're not suppressing him with I got to do this and I got to do that and I got to be here and I got to study for this and I got this at work and my no we got to let him out and let him do the work sometimes we can get so caught up even in our own Duty as Believers that we forget he's trying to come out and have a relationship with us and that peace comes from relationship not from works it comes from spending that time with him amen so if you're feeling like you've been killed all the day long brother Chad if you've been feeling like you've been killed all the day long sit down for a bit put the job away put School away put the family away and just say Lord would you do a little work for me right here and just let me dwell in your presence I'll tell you he'll honor you he'll honor you brother R says he's a gentleman he waits for you to invite him and then he speaks let him speak amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord my heart just gets so stirred thinking of what you've done Lord that you have come down Lord and you've humbled yourself to dwell in US Lord and too many times I think we can take it for granted Lord and we forget that we are the Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost that we are the Tabernacle of the Living God lord where's Zion where where you dwell Lord I pray through these Services Lord and through this week as your people people might dwell on these things Lord that you would Quicken a revelation of the god that is within us Lord that we would realize we don't have to bring you down from heaven we don't have to raise you down from the depths Lord we just have to clear the channels of our heart and our lives Lord and let you have free reign Lord there's a Simplicity in serving Lord there's a Simplicity of coming into relationship with you Lord I pray you just help us to give you the time you deserve Lord that we give you free access to our life each one Lord that we'd let you do the work
