finished singing this and just be in prayer for him because even though the singing and the worship is wonderful the word is the most important part and all we've done is my grace prepared our souls for the going forth amen so the congregation is now ready and anointed but a random said that once the congregation is Anointed and praying and the minister comes out to bring the word he said

my Jesus with the glory of God oh we praise you I Praise You Lord [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] a treasure thank you Lord please [Music] as we bow our heads together I want you to Envision yourself coming into a hospital tonight and the doctor has your case you're walking through the door past the secretary down the hallway into the private place now you've come into a place where the specialist has your file and the door is closed and the curtain is pulled and you are the person you are the one I wonder who would slip up your head and say Lord speak to me Lord deal with my life Lord I wanted to be personal great physician we look up into your face tonight we look up into your eyes [Music] Lord Jesus if there was any of us or our family members that had a serious need tonight and trouble we wouldn't care about the doctor's glasses or the Doctor's shoes or what city they were born in or what country they were born in or what Lord we would want help we would want deliverance we would want a way Lord made for us so we confess your Holy Name the name of Jesus that you are present Among Us and you are Mighty you are greater than all of our situations Lord we cast all of our cares we cast all of our needs Lord we lift up our hands Lord needy peoples our brother prayed and we just want to get out of the way we want to forget about ourselves and forget about those around us and just pull ourselves into a Cove Lord like a booth where you can speak to us and the word can have impact Lord may we be a people Lord trained by Your Word while we hear your word we can be filled with the Holy Spirit while we're in your presence Lord you can heal someone you can do a miracle here tonight you could save a soul you can't deliver the bound you could touch someone's spirit touch someone's body touch someone's soul [Music] it's a late hour Lord and we want to go in behind the veil this isn't a public show this isn't for everyone else and Newfoundland or everyone else in Saint John or conception Lord this is for the bride of Christ talk to us along the road and may our hearts burn within us while you move now in the operating room Lord Jesus and we don't want you to take your hands off of Our Lives until the work is finished so just do what you do Lord [Music] just do what you do Lord and you know all about it you know the past and the fine print of our case Lord but now we give it into your hands I will restore saith the Lord all the years all the months all the minutes in Jesus name in Jesus name in Jesus name Lord from now to the close of the service Lord let there be a supernatural presence and a supernatural glory in this room Lord that we would not even be able to contain ourselves Lord in Jesus name we thank you Lord amen amen why don't you just shake hands One Last Time thank you musicians it's so wonderful [Music] man you can bring up our slides brother thank you brother thank you hey man I'm gonna let you have your seats for a moment because I wanted to share something on the screen for us together nice to see all of your faces tonight and welcome to the presence of the Lord Jesus amen I made this personal the slide this is a mountain where near where we live and um just put the name of your church there so I could make it a little personal Amen in Jeffersonville brother Branham had this uh something that he shared he said somehow another I feel I just feel we're going there's something laying right ahead for us now just remember he said I believe I'm prophesying great joy lays ahead believe it that's right many saddened hearts will be made great Mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into Joy Hallelujah wouldn't that be wonderful if the Lord fulfilled that tonight and this weekend for us in in Tifton Georgia this is a a quote I wanted to share before we go to the word brother Branham said when we see God heal a man here a few days ago in our church they brought a little girl up there on a stretcher and they'd called me in the night time on the road and said the girl cannot live the cancer was so bad about 17 years old and she can't even get there she's going to die before she gets there it was a pitiful case a lovely little child of 17 years old to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all I never as much just touched her I walked in laying on a stretcher of course there were other sick people but I was concerned about the child to catch her spirit when I spoke to her and she seemed like a very fine little girl I see no reason why that child should fill a premature grave and that has to be the devil trying to take her life so I never touched the child at all remember he was trying to teach his church the Tabernacle a lesson he was trying to bring them up into further things I never touched a child at all and went right to the pulpit with the word and stayed right with the word and then and the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away is all right now living like anybody else can't find the trace of it anymore I never even touched her how many believe that's possible he said so the word went forth let's all say the word the word went forth and she believed the word and the word is God's life and God's power and the word is what does it the word heals the sick then you say well Jesus healed the sick he is the word he is the word when you receive the word you receive Jesus for he is the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we believe that don't we every bit we believe that Christ is God's word may manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing and we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head so now life flows through the body healing flows through the body there's power in the word amen and you know sometimes we have needs as individuals and we have a MD a medical doctor we have a general practitioner and then there's sometimes we need a specialist we get sent to a specialist tonight you're in the hands of a specialist it's the Lord Jesus now brother John's Ministry is is unique and different but I just have to be what God has called us to be and I'm going to speak from my heart today and I know that this service is going to be for someone it's it's very uh specific and very personal and I want I just want each one of you to be receiving be open and let's let the Lord Jesus do what he wants to do tonight I want to speak tonight on I will restore I will restore so let's turn together as we stand how many would just want the Lord to have his way and we're already in the second service of this weekend I don't want you to be distracted by anything and you're we're all together we're all here and Jesus is in control there's no demon or devil that can conquer the Lord Jesus let's just take him at his word and let's believe him tonight I believe from the service tonight there's going to be testimonies I believe he's a God that does miracles and he's also a Divine healer and and healing takes time do you all know the difference there's healing and that can be immediate and then there's healing did I say that wrong a miracle a Miracle's instant but a healing takes time and God's A Healer so just reach out I don't know you I don't know your private lives I don't know your situation so you just have to take it from the Lord that he's talking to you personal amen can we do that Joel chapter 2 verse 23 as you know the scripture isn't just speaking the present Joel wasn't just speaking for the the now but it was actually prophecy for future be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice Joel 2 23 rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former reign and the latter rain in the first month so this is where we have the planting rain and the Harvest rain coming in the same season in the same time could be the same service you could have teaching you could have a planting you could have a harvest right in the same month in the same season this isn't just a foundational message that we've received we're in a Rapture message and so that means God could be dealing with uh someone in kindergarten a new Christian or he could be dealing with an elder person someone that's very mature in the same season do we believe that it's this rain this word this uh that you're going to receive is gonna just be coming and flowing and the floors shall be full of wheat that's the word and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil wine and oil is always to do with healing and you know that wine is stimulation that comes from Revelation oil is the holy spirit so remember the the the man that was uh beaten by the robbers and the priest walked by and the levite walked by but there was a man that had wine and oil and he helped bring a healing then he brought him to the church he brought him to the Inn and he said take care of this person and whatever's lacking when I return I'll make up the difference that was a promise to us as Believers that the church is a place of healing our church services should be a time of healing it should be like a hospital okay it's like a hospital verse 5 25 is our verse tonight and I will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed you know we're humans so he said it twice you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to be embarrassed who's ever been in a hospital or wore one of those gowns it's embarrassing I mean you put it on and the hinder parts you don't want nobody to see your hinder Parts it's so embarrassing it's like please exit out of the room I need to stand up and go to the washroom and it's not a glorious place to be when you're in need now I'm I'm approaching the service tonight like a specialist and we've all we've been there we've all been there it's embarrassing to say I have a need or that I I'm in trouble or that I need help verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the Servants of it upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and the and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the Earth the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come verse 32 is our last verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever and brother Branham paused at this verse and he talked about this verse because it's also in the Acts chapter 2 in Romans Chapter 2 whosoever means you need to put your name there because if the Bible would have put your name there then you could have had a reason to say well someone else's name is come on Mark Coffey or Jonathan curlette or sister Amber you would if somebody's name was sister Faith or Selena you would be able to say well oh there's a lot of Selena so it's not for me but he said the Bible says whosoever that means you can put your name there are we believing together whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance how many know that the bride is called New Jerusalem so there ought to be deliverance and there ought to be something about our Gatherings and as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call God bless you you can have your seats tonight I will restore who is saying this who made this promise God God did God will restore when we say I will restore will means not maybe I will I'm on your case I'm working on it I've got this I've got this it's God saying this to you tonight I want you to take this personal like brother John was with you in a room all alone and when the Bible says I will restore I God said I will restore you I'm going to bring you back to the original he's never lied to no person whether you're young middle-aged or older I will restore saith the Lord I woke up early this morning a very burdened and and with these things upon my heart the Lord laid this on our heart to say and tonight I want us to go together on a little journey as we look now at many current situations that would be among us or certain needs things that have happened amongst the the bride of Christ and what is happening there's been many hurts there's been many things that have happened that are irreparable there's been great damage in individuals lives there are believers that are in a lot of pain Satan is the one that inflicts suffering Satan is the one that brings turmoil Satan is the one that brings confusion Satan is the one that brings Mix-Ups how many has ever heard that little phrase about Humpty Dumpty that he had a great fall Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall and all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again say brother John why are you talking with a childhood it's a little story that's so that we all get it you know if you talk simple then everybody gets it the point about this is all the kings horses and all the king's men couldn't put back all these pieces they couldn't bring it back again and sometimes we get into situations where we get into things as Believers that we just look at it and say however would there ever be a restoration [Music] never in the message I want you to think and just meditate upon this tonight brother John is 50 years old and born and raised in the message so I'm just really speaking uh locally and globally never in the message did we realize or did we know or would we ever accept that so much could happen so much would happen so much is happening or that is possible in the message for many years and uh in conventions or local churches we talked about the Catholic church or we talked about the Pentecostals or we talked about denominations and and for many people it was out there it was out there but now as the message has gone on and years have gone on and now it's really come down home for a lot of years we talked about being in the token and being in message churches and you know we kind of put divorce as something out there great but now as we've gone on in the message we see that it's come in right among us even in the message we talk about breakups or we talk about premarital sex that would go on amongst young people even amongst children or even amongst middle-aged or even single adults and and never did we think that we'd even be talking about that especially from behind a message Pulpit not even saying the word never would we think that there would be babies born out of wedlock within the message ranks it was always something out there somewhere it was always the other Church in town it was always something we read in the newspaper something that would happen in the Catholic church or something down the road and some denomination somewhere and we frowned upon it and we kind of shook our head like oh that'll never come in our church that'll never come in the message but I just want to wake you up tonight we need to get our heads out of the sand and realize the waters have come to your Shores also never would we thought that prescription drug use would become so even common and prevalent amongst message people we talk about drugs and alcohol and I don't know what it's like here in Newfoundland but they've they have uh accepted marijuana and and approved all kinds of illegalized drugs in certain states in the United States and in America I don't know what it is in Newfoundland I really don't know but they've allowed alcohol they've allowed certain drugs marijuana and certain gateway drugs not knowing that that you know many of them the lawmakers were from the 60s where they took drugs themselves so it's no wonder they make it legal because they think they didn't turn out too bad themselves they think but it really fried their brain brother Bynum said you're insane if you don't have the Holy Ghost so stay with me a little bit whether you have a message name on it or someone out in the world you're insane without the Holy Ghost never would we think that the media overuse would become not just a problem amongst the young people many people say it's a young people's problem you know things they're looking at on their computers or on their cell phones or on their tablets and things but it's not just a young people's problems it's become a middle-aged problem and actually seniors in the message I've been in Rome with full of ministers and even prominent ministers in the message and almost all of them have their cell phones out and they're looking at their cell phones can't hardly have a meal can't hardly have a conversation today without someone looking at their watch or looking at their phone or looking at this it's become a global pandemic and you can all be quiet tonight that's just fine you know I'm a specialist I'm not a medical doctor and I'm not just someone General I'm being very focused and you can be embarrassed or you can be quiet but it's nothing but the truth anyway it's become a cell phone usage has become a global epidemic in homes social media Expressions what you say well find me a quote on that brother John well you know what you might not be able to say brother Branham said but the Holy Ghost says social media has become in a global epidemic amongst message believers in fact it's out of control in many areas a lack of personal attention a lack of focusing on things that are the most important and it leads to marriage breakups it leads to children that are out of order and disorder it leads to things that happen I remember some years ago getting called from uh getting a call late at night by a head Deacon of a church in the message and he was just speaking to me I knew the church very well and the family very well and and it and you know the the conversation came around he was very serious and urgent that you know his young daughter that was a teenager had been in a relationship with someone and she had become pregnant and this is in the message and now his daughter has become pregnant and you know the conversation becomes well is abortion and then it goes on to this and goes on to that you know these kind of questions you say well that's just shocking that's just something that is just unheard of well you know friends when it becomes down the road when the rubber meets the road that's where we find out what's really in the heart of people today abortion is not God's perfect will but neither is sex outside of marriage God's will it's it's fornication it's it's a it's adultery if you're married it's something that even fornication and and you know the word behind it is porno pornography and we find that all of these things is becoming rampant even amongst message believers should they keep the baby should it go to full term you know should the couple get married you know it's just a young teenager just someone that's in the message and all finally later they get married then there's a breakup that it just becomes a mess and you become to realize that people don't want to really admit that they've got a problem they don't want to admit that they're in an issue it's they become too proud to become honest I'm speaking on I will restore tonight I mean there's got to be a way back you can't just always talk about the issue or talk about the problem there's got to be an answer to all of this we got to open up our hearts to the solution the message was is that God would send a messenger that would turn the heart not turn the head but turn the heart and not give statistics but actually give a word that would be able to uncover the devil and deliver God's people out of their dilemmas so friends we can't keep our heads buried in the sand people don't want to hear about these things that I just talked about in the last five minutes they don't even want to hear about it they just want to think God's truth is marching on and we're in the glory bound way and people don't want to talk about their afflictions and their troubles they don't want to talk about even the mental troubles that's amongst message uh People sisters struggling with a mental oppression Brothers struggling with that they get so nervous how many has heard the messages of brother Branham and he'll go one right after the other and say you've got a nervous trouble and you've got nervous trouble how many's ever heard him say that did you notice what I said nervous trouble and it's all the trouble and you've got a kidney trouble and you've got a heart trouble and you got a certain trouble well nervousness is a trouble and and it causes people to get nervous and upset it can almost be like a duck though or a Canada Goose sitting on the water on on the top of the water it looks like everything's good everything's good but underneath but underneath their feet are going like this their feet are just how many knows what I'm talking about you underwater things are going like this so on the surface it looks like I'm good and how you doing tonight well I'm good all's good when really it might not be all as good I want to say tonight before we get into further of our message Jesus Christ is the answer to all of our needs Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the solution to all the situations I'm not here to give you psychology or to just talk about some issue I'm here to say Jesus Christ is the only one that you or I need to be holding on to me and we need to make sure that Jesus Christ is the one that's holding on to us so it does go both ways friends he's holding on to us but we've got to be holding on to him and and if you're not tonight you need to at least make a motion toward the lord just take a step just take a step toward the lord I encourage you he is the answer brother John personally has dealt with young people in mental institutions I've dealt with uh underage they're not even adults I've gone into institutions like brother Branham talked about in Louisville when he crossed the the river that Sunday afternoon to deal with a a young person there was two ladies they were 17 and 18 years old and they were very smart and they were dealing with overtures and things and writing songs and you know they got in an environment where Pete someone was making fun of them how they dressed and their long hair and long dress and and they started to make fun of them and one of the young ladies was kind of stronger and she was able to throw it off and said oh we know who we are and where where we're going but the other young lady kind of took it personal and it wounded her spirit who remembers what I'm talking about and she got into this institution and they were gonna turn her over to Madison which brother John was born in New Albany in Madison was just up the road there and and Anna and so they were going to turn her over to Madison and brother Branham walked in there and he said you had to go into the elevator and they closed the door and it was padded and go up to a certain floor and the doors would lock behind you and he went in and spoke to the uh young lady and I'm not going to go into that account I think her name was Margaret but brother Brandon began to speak to her and talk to her and all the medication and all the doctors and all the years that she had been in that situation but the Lord Jesus gave brother Branham the word and began to go back in her life and catch her wandering spirit and bring it back to her and he just said something about all your life you've been Desiring to marry a minister and he said that that caught her spirit just to say something that seems so why would you even be talking about that but it went out there and it caught her spirit and brought it back and by that evening she's already sitting up in bed and they were releasing her from the hospital the next day I want to say praise the Lord that that God even had time to go after a troubled heart brother John has been across from young ladies that have been born and raised in the message in institutions like that and it just tears your heart out brother Gerald to be in a situation where you know the families and you know this dear person this young lady and Satan would ravish their lives and get them so upset I've been in another room I'll remember a young lady just being torn and smashed up and her life just going through a relationship a shift and and things that happened that night and going on the road and smashing headlong face on with another vehicle and I went into the hospital and she just all messed up her a order was just burst her her legs her hip and Bones were just crushed and things and I remember going in is this okay tonight I I went in and I remember because she wasn't living right and she wasn't where she should be with the Lord and her fingernails she was a white sister she had black Phoenix fingernails on and I remember kneeling down and praying with her and I want to say tonight God brought her out of that trouble she was able to marry a real Godly brother and she just had a new baby in the last few weeks serving the lord and her life has just been like a rocket ship going up in the presence of the Lord I want to say wherever you're at Tonight There's Hope for you I will restore Rings through this little church building Brokenness will not break you I remember where that came into my heart I was in a certain meeting I hope you don't mind me speaking some of these testimonies do you all mind that or I believe the word can heal someone just sitting right in their chair not even laying hands on them just the word healing them testimonies being in a church coming through covet and it was just coming through it was last year sometime and you know how everyone masked do you wear masks do you don't wear masks should we come to church should we stream all these nonsense that we all had to go through and well this certain service the the pastor felt to have people come forward that had needs you know and we were praying like right there with people and I still remember the pastor he's just praying right in front of a person you know this is Coveted time this is where people are afraid you know and here he calls me up and I'm right next to him and we're praying for people and just praying for the needs of the people and I remember going back to my seat and the Lord putting that right into my thoughts and I wrote it down on the piece of paper I still have it in my Bible Brokenness will never break you I wrote it down this morning in my notes as I Was preparing for tonight I want to speak to all of you no matter what you're going through no matter what has happened in your life you might feel broken tonight but it will not break you wounded hearts when and have it that came to my heart today maybe I'll speak on that at another place at another time but wounded hearts when in heaven foreign there are events that have happened in our lives and there's happenings in life that we cannot reverse we would like to do that we would like to do that for ourselves and we would like to do that for others that we deal with how many know what I'm talking about you wish that it could be reversed you wished that that never happened to that person because you can see that they're really struggling with that you can see that Satan really has them on the ropes and you would like to go back and reverse that but there's things we cannot take back we cannot undo and I find that in brother branham's ministry as I listen to him today in healing lines and things and it was never like he was trying to undo the past but he was allowing the Lord Jesus to meet the person at their present point of need right here and then let the Lord do what he wanted to do I'm going back now to last year I'm going to back to last year I think it was about January was the time and there was a mother in the message she has four teenagers from young teenagers all the way to late teens she had teenagers in her home and she saw the direction of her children she is a minister's wife and so she was burdened about the needs in the church and burdened about the needs in the message she's a very wonderful sister if she was here tonight you would really love her she began to write these words on little Post-it notes and on notes all through the house I will restore saith the Lord you can see one of her sons probably like swords or something she wrote it above the beds in the house this was a burden of a mother that had teenagers I will restore saith the Lord how many can see that on the screen she wrote it on the microwave so no matter who was preparing their meal as you know with teenagers and a busy home things can be going in all kinds of directions mothers fathers teenagers I will restore saith the Lord it was a burden it was a desire I means God is going to do this for us I will restore saith the Lord she wrote it on mirrors in the bedrooms on their mirrors when they tried to get ready to go to school or go to work or go to the store I will restore saith the Lord she wrote it on their master bedroom window uh a mirrors in the mirrors in the bathrooms I will restore saith the Lord oh this is some of our people's favorite places the refrigerator she wrote it on the refrigerator she was burdened she was earnest she wanted to get the message across I'll tell you friends we need to let the message get through like the little messenger Dove that was that was shot at and shot out in those Wing torn off in its and its feet torn and blood is going everywhere but it fell behind the Enemy Lines and though there was blood everywhere and though it wasn't the most beautiful dove in the family but the message got through and we need to get the message through to one another Hallelujah has anybody here ever had problems in your life have you ever had a problem or do you have a problem tonight so we all know what we're talking about then the message has got to get through that I will restore all the years all the situations all the months of whatever you've gone through in your life God is saying tonight that I know all about it I know where you've been I know what you've been thinking I know in your family I know in the message I know in your church God knows all the fine print you don't have to spend a four-hour counseling session with him tonight going over all the details he just says I know isn't that wonderful as you look up from your hospital bed and look into the face of Jesus and to know that he knows I will restore she wrote it on the Windows of their house can you believe this this is a picture looking out of the of a believer's home outside can you see the trees I will restore saith the Lord she wrote it on the wall she wrote notes it was all through her house of this promise of I will restore so I thought about what about today does God still restore is God able to take a mind is he able to take a troubled spirit is he able to take a body that's wrapped by pain is he able to take a soul that's that is in distress and out of order I will restore Joel chapter 2 verse 25 I will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palm of worm my great Army which I sin among you that that word of years is a division of time it's a measurement of time it's an indication of a part of an age Satan wants to create Havoc at this time of our age the laodicean age the bride age Satan wants to cause havoc and he wants to eat away and all those things that God is sowing within your life where it could be a lifetime of years of your life God is saying to you I will restore to you the years Now The New International Version and The New American Standard Version just watch this are we feeding okay tonight when the Bible says I will repay you for the years that the Locust has eaten the great Locust and the young locusts the other locusts and the locust swarm Maya just seems like Satan's comes sometimes and you're able to Ward it off and then there's sometimes it just comes from this way then it comes from that way then comes from this way like a swarm and God is saying to you I will repay you for the years and all the damage that has caused in your family in your life in your church in the message I will repay you in the in The New American Standard the but it says then I will make up to you for the years that the swarming Locust has eaten the creeping locusts the stripping Locust and the gnawing Locus oh that really describes the devil he goes about like a roaring lion trying to destroy you trying to get you to the place that you just feel like it's all over there's no hope for you there you'll it'll never be you'll never be a good Christian come on specialist speak to us Lord amen come down into our private lives [Music] use the minister to say something that our teenagers thought this afternoon or late last night or this week what your wife thought about her what a single sister in the church is going through Lord use the minister he came all the way from the west coast to the East Coast to give you a message you don't even know him he don't even know you but God knows you he knows beforehand he God knows beforehand he knows before the trial he knows why you're going through the trial and he knows after the trial and he's saying I'm going to restore you now is God a liar I'm getting personal is God a liar that and so many other people's case he can come through and be victorious but you know you're kind of a special case your case is kind of one of those special ones and you know he just shakes his head and well I don't know about your case come on come on I'm talking to you we getting a pity party we we get a victim mentality we we start thinking you know everybody's against me and nobody cares and I'm going to the Garden to eat worms we think like we're not a good we don't have the Holy Ghost we think like we're Judas yeah we act the part we do all the mechanics but down in our heart Satan's been gnawing at our peace he's gnawing at our joy he's gnawing at our confidence and then something happens in your marriage or something happens in your job or or you fail a test or you actually do something willingly to hurt the Lord it's called iniquity and you think you've crossed the line and you think like it's all over but you know the next service or the next morning there's still that something that's knocking at the door of your heart do you know what that is that's the Lord Jesus and it's also Vindication that you're a seed of God because God doesn't deal with serpent seed the way that she deals with you there'll be people that God deals with one time and that's it and at the day of judgment it'll be that sign on the wall or that person that came through their checkout line and it'll be the Holy Spirit at that meeting or that special services and he'll deal with them and never deal with them again but with you it's just not like that he just keeps coming around he keeps coming around and you shut the door you get cold something happens and and you just kind of harden up a little bit and kind of maybe resist him or get disenchanted and you know what he'll he'll give you space he's a wonderful father and a wonderful husband he's never abused any person he's never been mean or nasty amen the way of the transgressor is hard but you know if you're a seed of God you're going to come around again and there'll be a time that if you just keep slamming the front door he'll creep around to the back door he'll come up through an attic he'll come through the side he'll he'll let you know that I see your life I know you and I will restore saith the Lord [Music] you're not too far that God can't reach you or you wouldn't be feeling the way you do right now that's the Holy Spirit so when the Bible says I will restore and if you want to write some of this down it might be good to take the medicine it's to be in a covenant of peace with you I'm gonna bring you back to peace I'm going to make things to be complete again for you it's going to be sound your mind is going to be sound your spirit is going to be strong you're gonna make it you know God is more interested in you having the Holy Spirit than you are having the holy spirit in fact brother Branham said he wants to give it to you more than you desire it you say well I have a desire for the Lord or I have a desire to draw closer to the Lord or I would like to receive the Holy Spirit what do you think that is that's not a demon spirit that's the Holy Spirit trying to press himself into you like all the Waters of the ocean trying to come down into a little pipe that that's what it would be like all of the waters out there in the ocean you all live near the ocean right I I live near the ocean the other ocean amen yeah all the pressure of all the ocean coming down into a little pipe that would be the pressure of the love of God trying to come down to your life how did somebody say thank you Jesus I will restore means I'm gonna finish this I'm gonna bring it to an end and it's kind of like the three Hebrew children you're going to come out of this uninjured like kind of like the Lion's Den with Daniel those that sought to destroy you are the ones that's going to be destroyed those that despised you are the ones that's going to be judged but you're going to come out of this uninjured say but what about all my hearts and my scars I'm going to get to that in a few minutes are you what about my spirit brother John I just I'm wrestling with this to why it happened and what do I need to do and brother brother John I'm just seemed so unsettled God's gonna make you safe you're safe tonight he's gonna make you whole he's going to make you good you know there's a there's a plaque brother John travels a lot in the past in evangelism and and sometimes now we fly out of Seattle and when we come out of the Seattle how many knows when you come out of the airplane there's a long jet way up to the where the inside of the airport is who's ever traveled before that jet way there and when you're walking up the side sometimes they have signs on the wall and it's advertisements and things but there's a certain sign in Seattle that says you are now entering a safe place this is a safe place that means if if you've been trafficking it or if there's people that are abusing you or mistreating you and telling you to be quiet you know and don't tell nobody that now you're coming into a safe place this is a safe place that if you're in danger tell somebody hello you're being trafficked maybe for sexual things or someone is abusing you and it goes on for weeks and months and years and you're being trafficked you're now coming into a safe place tell a stewardess tell a steward tell a gate agent tell somebody if you go into the bathroom and the man that's you know mopping the floor the lady that's cleaning tell somebody don't just be all quiet don't just you know be all beaten down and bruised and be wearing long sleeves because you're you know you're being abused on and there's bruises all over tell somebody yes sir it is that's what we need to do tonight we need to tell the Lord and we need to stop being silent and lay in there like some beaten abused woman when you are the Bride of Jesus Christ it's time for you to come out of that it's time for you to come out of that victim mentality somebody telling you you're bad and you're horrible and you'll never be worth anything and you're you're ugly and all of this it's not true you're beautiful you're lovely you're not a you're not defeated you're not a failure I'm talking to somebody paid for my airline ticket for me to come all the way over here and tell you on a Saturday night you're not a failure you're not a weakling you don't need to be abused and be heard and be beaten down what that person said about you is not the truth you need to take the word of God and say I will restore that includes me take the gospel I'm giving you a prescription tonight some of you need to pop it open and break that seal and tug it on down there saying oh God I want to take everything the Lord has for me I'm coming out of here hallelujah we're giving you the word Faith cometh by hearing your faith muscles ought to be like I'm coming out of here Lord I feel stronger I can do this greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world I'm not giving you psychology I'm giving you the saith the Lord I will restore is a promise you ought to feel that energy you ought to feel like the healing bomb coming over you right now there's Waters to swim in you don't need to just be pedaling around okay the Lord and praise the Lord you know let's all praise the Lord with all my my own praise the Lord and I will praise the Lord let's praise God I thank you Jesus I love you Lord it might start like that it might start like this but then it gets like this and then you start weeping a little bit then you start crying a little bit and then you start nodding your head a little bit you know that's true brother John I know and then pretty soon it's like yes Lord like thank you Jesus Hallelujah it ought to be that way Lord God's Gonna Give You compensation and make up for those weary jury nights and those nightmares are going to start turning into God's presence now moving the angels of God are going to start ministering to you I'm going to make it good for you I'm gonna reward you I'm gonna perform my good word I'm going to repay you and make an end of this what brother John is preaching about tonight isn't just for the preachers Detroit I'm speaking about a sister that had four teenagers and she saw what they was going through she saw the turmoil she wrote this down it wasn't a comic book it wasn't a YouTube link first you know some other dress or some she was serious about her family she was burdened for the situation she wanted to see a change and so she posted these letters all over the house on the refrigerator on the mirror she began to post them on the on the different areas the microwave on the master bedroom uh mirror she began to post him on the living room mirror on the doorway God give us more mothers like that let me just pause right here and say may this church be full of mothers like that Spirits travel on words and we need to encourage one another with positive words let me say that again Spirits travel on words and we need to watch our words and watch what we feed on because our thoughts are feeding on things and our thoughts become words and our words become actions so we need to start tonight to start feeding off the word and start confessing the word then later that year last year we went over to Europe and Belgium and we took a youth camp and this is just some young people from Belgium and Germany and Holland that they just gathered there in Germany for a weekend of services and it was during this this is an opening like a morning session I think this was Saturday morning and we begin to talk about covet because remember this was October of last year so covet had been over a year how this affected the young people of the message and how did it affect the young people being at home and they used to be able to go to church and they used to be able to have youth meetings they used to be able to visit their grandmothers or you know see their friends but now they're all you know in homes and now they're having to do their schoolwork remotely and so they're being forced to be on their computers more and in their bedrooms and private things is this okay that I'm talking like this I didn't bring my notes it was Pages after pages of us uh we're sitting over on the right hand side there in the top of the you can see us in the table we get we like to get right down with the young people and they begin to just speak in their groups and then they would talk about it for a little while then they would have a leader then they would all Express you know how did this affect your Christian Life how did this affect your life or in your church throughout covid and how you know what were some of the positive things what were some of the negative things and we begin to speak to the young people about this I think it's good to talk to our young people about these things I don't think it's good that you know everybody goes to their rooms and they're they never have a conversation so we opened it up like that and then we took it to the main services this is in their church I just wanted to share this I thought it might be encouraging to you to see some other believers from Europe and and this is just a young people's Gathering from several countries and so on some of the services that we had and speaking to them from our hearts this is uh the church in Belgium then we came back to the United States and took this uh youth meeting down in South Carolina and uh just speaking to them speaking about the rising generation this was one of the services that we took this is just some pictures of of the one uh part of the building that we were speaking uh to and then there's a whole nother group that sat off to the one side on the front there on the right hand side there was a whole nother room that was just full of hundreds of young people you can how many can see that on the photo and to have young people being ministered too and then to have it at the end of the service a response to the word and a response at the altar many times or responding in their seats I'm just standing like this some rejoicing some just dedicating themselves to the Lord I believe that God's moving amongst the bride globally amen locally and globally and I thought of that today what about today what about in Newfoundland is God moving here is God moving tonight does God want to still restore my son-in-law is a real good believer brother John Waldner and he went into the doctor's office some time ago and he saw this sign hanging and he took a photo please limit each office visit to one to two issues only the doctor's office people coming in and they just want to tell all their needs and tell all that they're going through and it's the medical field is so overwhelmed and so you know please keep it to one or two issues only and I thought Lord May that never sign never hang in our message churches God can take all the issues could you imagine brother coffee us putting that up in a message Church only one or two issues only per person I tell you our God's bigger than all of that he's he's better than the medical system we don't need to talk to the secretary we need the Lord we don't need to talk to the minister only we need to talk to the lord it's not our mother or our father or the Sunday school teacher or the Deacon we want to go all the way brother and I thought isn't that amazing that the medical field is saying don't come in here and unload on us you've only got 10 minutes and then you we need we need out of here this person has issues too look at us tonight we're all here together all of our issues we all come to church and put on our nice clothes you know and tomorrow it'll probably be more bling blingy you know or I'll be dressed up and y'all smell it brother John amen tomorrow's Sunday and we all dressed so nice and we come in and we're all good and but really sometimes it's not all good really sometimes if we'd be honest we're bearing burdens and baron cares that we really don't want to talk to nobody about many times we carry these for weeks and maybe months it's amazing the Bible would say I will restore the years because sometimes things can go on for years and we never thought in the message we would raise our families and out of five children maybe two of them serve the Lord well am I going to get quiet on me tonight we never thought we'd have children and six children in the message and raised under the token and raised at camp meetings and go into youth services and having Sunday school and having church and having conventions and having all of this and out of six children maybe three are serving the lord tonight we never thought you'd have children and have three children on my beautiful children my lovely children all these precious children in the message and when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be and then two of the children choose to not follow in the way of the Lord and it becomes a big burden and then some begin to question the message some begin to question the Lord preach I'm talking to you tonight I'm a specialist I'm not going to be general doctor MD tonight I'm I'm not going to be like that I'm a specialist I'm honing in down on you we've been in a lot of services over the years we've we've heard a lot of things and then we've all got to go home tonight and after the special meetings brother John's gonna fly back home and be with my home and my family and my issues and our church issues and you're going to be back on Wednesday night or back next week and back to your home and back to your emails back to your taxes back to your medium back to your jobs and it's like oh God do you even know do you even care Lord is my life just like numb numbly going through life am I just shuffling down the road kicking the rock down the road is there ever any answer to all of this I'm going to tell you tonight God is here Among Us I will restore means that God is very present to your situation how many can say Amen to what brother how many can appreciate the word tonight Psalms 107 verse 20 says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions let's all read this out loud together let's read it he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their distractions he healed them he made them helpful speaking of God being our healer he's a physician he's my physician man you are really a case you're a hard case well why don't you say but I've got somebody on my case Hallelujah I'm not talking about you but I am talking about you you are such a case but you know who's got my case the Lord's got my case and if the Lord can't bring anything good out of this nobody can how many of y'all's ever thought Lord what do you do with people like me I'm being serious how many of y'all ever thought that Lord what do you do with people like me after all I've heard and all I know what do you do with people like me I'll just leave it right there amen some of you've thought that before some of you have actually prayed and you've got down on your knees maybe or maybe you're just going to work or you're going through your house and you're like Lord I feel like such a failure I feel like such a failure and the Bible says he sent his word and it healed them God just has a way of speaking it in a certain way and you start being healed we not we might not be running the aisles tonight we might all be shaking our hats are our bonnets but the Lord sending his word out and it's bringing healing to the church it deals with hurts of the Nations and restoring back to favor individual distresses of healings literally of persons of national hurts or individual defects just get in line tonight you're gonna be healed just get a line you say well God's not talking to me or God's not on my case well you're in the prayer line it's not all about you all the time surely as Believers we've mature enough to know that it's not all about you surely we're Way Beyond being selfish and think that everything revolves around you I know you that raised children know what I'm talking about they just think everything revolves around them and it doesn't they're gonna find out it doesn't all revolve around them somebody fires them or somebody gives them a ticket where you're going 98 in a 60 and that oh no policeman you were you were speeding sometimes the mother didn't get across or the daddy but the RCMP officer got across yeah you're speeding you're wrong just say I'm wrong are you there yet just say you're wrong well this government or this officer he must have had a bad day no you're speeding shut your mouth up you're speeding you're guilty [Music] why don't you just say I'm wrong I'm talking about in the message where did we lose that feeling of I am wrong [Music] we better move along some of you might have seen this before about a tree the healing continues tonight the healing continues anybody take a breath special meetings we're halfway through amen we're Saturday night tomorrow's our last service y'all doing okay we're like a tree when you cut a tree it talks about the years how old that tree is and you can look at the rings of a tree and see if it was a rainy season or if it was a dry season if it was rainy the the Rings are farther apart if it was a dry season they're close together it's called seasons of life but the tree just keeps growing now in this tree a certain year there was a forest fire that came through the community it was a real fire it was a bad thing but did the tree live beyond the fire on the picture here can you see did the tree live beyond that's why when we say when you go through things I mean you will go through things but it leaves a scar you can tell in that person's life that even for the years after you can see the growth it's affected by this let me show you in this next slide how this tree that is 24 years old how there came a certain knot a certain naughty situation it was about year it looks like you're about between 10 and 12. like there was a knot like there was an issue that happened and it looks like it was about five years long it just went through this not this issue it came around to October 16th or February 20th and every time it would come around you're dealing with this naughty issue this attitude or there's something in your marriage or uh the church or this it always brings up these bad feelings and it just seems like when it came around and you can see the bark of that tree actually grew into this other tree how many can see that it it was like a knot and that dark part is the Bark of the other situation and you had to get around it you had to keep going you had to go to March you had to go to April I'm talking spiritual language because you are the Bright Tree how many know you're the bride tree you just gotta keep going you can see though how this knot and this actually affected this tree for years to come you say but brother John I'm a Believer you know everything's going to be smooth you know you serve the Lord everything's just going to be easy Street well who lied to you who who gave you that something I mean you're on something you need to and it's not the Holy Ghost the Bible talks about many are the afflictions of the righteous I mean if you're single and you think you've got issues just wait till you have get into a marriage and then have children then have grandchildren boy this is a good service tonight amen thank you Lord for having this service amen everybody thinks when the children grow up and they get out of the house it's all gonna no no no brother you start finding out there's burdens to life that's why we need to seek out our mate and really seek the Lord and let it be a spiritual event and you don't want to marry the wrong person but you also don't want to be a skeleton sitting on the tree saying well I didn't want to marry the wrong person and you turn out to be 85 and you you've had that fear your whole life you think it's funny I saw a picture of that today it was a female that was sitting on a park bench bench it's just her skeleton bones and she sat there her whole life and she finally died nobody was ever good enough nobody ever made enough money nobody was whatever and she got so old she just died there skeletons sitting on a park bench waiting for Mr Right I don't know who your spouse is gonna be I don't know God's perfect will is for your life you're supposed to wrestle that out we don't need the pastor to be telling us who to marry need the Lord Jesus to tell us who we're gonna [Music] and then sometimes I'm just going to be honest people make mistakes and they marry the wrong person and we have people in our churches that are divorced or they're separated we have single mothers or single fathers it doesn't mean life is over it doesn't mean that you'll never be a contribution to the church we need to serve the Lord no matter what our status in life no matter our marriage or our failure or whether you're single or older single or I better move along amen do you all get what I'm talking about we need to go through the knots in our lives and stop getting so naughty about it k-n-o-t-t-y whatever that is in French amen you see it on this next slide someone was 20 years old 20 years of their life it was just they didn't get a lot of rain they didn't get a lot of moisture they didn't get a lot of revivals boom and something happened 20 years old and for the next nine years how many can see that on the screen it just the year was full of and it just water and nutrients that they would call it biosolids scientifically and something was added to this person let's just say let's just say they gave their heart to the Lord let's just say God revealed the message to them and all of a sudden from that time they began to grow and grow and grow then I say Lord add some water to our lives I will restore mean something happened to me at that year and from that time I began to grow it was like Leaps and Bounds it was just like we said last night God putting a key in the lock and turning it and and I've been living in this dark room for a long time brother and God just I ca I I went through the door and I walked out in and it's just been like a new day brother it's like I got a new lease on life it's like I see things differently it's the Lord Jesus saying I will restore [Music] walk through the door tonight he's standing at the door saying I want you to come out of that dark room and you come to church and you're playing the part and you're trying to look the part and the Lord wants you to take another step towards him this is my last slide on this subject all the years and years and years and then there was a fire scar there was something that went through that church and it really caused a scar and for years and years and years whenever it came around to that issue and around to that it really affected that but do you all see it just kept on living it didn't roll over and die and when you felt like it and when you felt like my life is over God says no I have more for you let's get up and go you know friends I'll be honest there's sometimes you just dress and you go out the door and you go to work or you go to church and you don't feel a lot you don't feel a lot it's not all about feelings as you grow in the Lord You've begin to realize there's good days bad days there's bad things that happen to good people it don't mean you're a devil it don't mean your serpent seat Hallelujah say I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and if God never speaks to me again he has spoken to me enough where is all the Abrahams in the message that if God don't talk to me for 20 years I'm still gonna serve him amen listen friends you've heard enough you have heard enough of the message than more than most people in the message oh but I've got to hear from God every service and next week if God Don't Talk To Me by Tuesday night at eight o'clock I'm walking away well who gave you that attitude who gave you that spirit people in the world are more resilient than that I'm being honest sometimes people in the message are a bunch of babies yeah forgive me for the next 30 seconds but they get so Baby Fat and sometimes people in the world are more resilient they don't even have the Holy Ghost they don't even have God and sometimes there's a divorce and they just they find another life they find another they find another hobby they find and they live single and they're not even believers they just and they go on and they just serve they just they're not even in the message boom something like how that happened to one of us and it's like the end of the world it's like we got hit by a Big Mac Truck I'm not taking away the feelings of getting hit by a Big Mac Truck and I'm not belittling what's happened in any of your lives I hope you're not misunderstanding I'm just trying to give you some medicine to say you're bigger than that you're better than that of people in the world can be more resilient than us in the message we've missed something we're not living as close to Jesus as we say we are we need to get more out of our services we need our services to carry in a greater atmosphere and and our ministers to be more honest with us you know last year can I continue on a few more minutes last year I took my parents out to Olive Garden Olive Garden just sits across this parking lot and I took him out for their wedding anniversary this is right you know covert was just kind of still get people getting over coveted it it might have been two years ago I'm sorry it was 2020. so this was right in July and it was my parents anniversary and I took them to this Olive Garden right across the street and I saw this sign across the parking lot and I began to look at this sign the Care Center and peace health and it said the wound healing Center how many can say that and I begin to look at a wound Healing Center and I thought God if people in the world can go into a place that have had wounds and come out and be healed what about in the message is it possible the people that have gone through times of wounds can find a place of healing is it possible I begin to think about this so I begin to think about wounds I'm not going to stay on these pictures very long because some of them are a little unsightly these are wounds these are things that have actually happened to people that you can see happen to their body and we are the body of Christ and see the stages of wound healing right here you can see how things happen to a person things happen in their lives you can see how there Comes A Time of dramatic wound a drought a dramatic hurt or an accident or like a shock you hear Brother Brown talk about this in the message he'll go back in a person's life and say that happened because of a shock I see your husband that happened in the shock he was in the war and I see you sister something happened you fell down a well and the shock and the jolt of that's caused something in your abdomen but I'm speaking about now how things happen to people's lives in the message and it causes a wound and for so many years people just kind of gloss over it kind of like a medical MD with oh just get over it just get the Holy Ghost you're thinking that way about yourself you just got a demon on you sister brother you're just so and people been talking like that for years it's it's kind of like that's how it was dealt with just get the Holy Ghost yet we realized there were deep wounds and it's scars that happen to people scars are actually evidence that healing has taken place I want you to look at that thing that happened in your life when you look down and see it from now on I want you to see that a scar is actually evidence that healing is taking place when you see this happen on a person's hand or on their arm a scar is actually a visual or an emotional response from a past injury that did not lead to death so God allowed you to go through that something in your life and I'm I'm asking the Holy Spirit to make that real to you because he can do that because I don't know you but he does but a scar that happens to you but it didn't lead to your death somebody needs to say praise the Lord so it's not always a bad thing a scar or something that happened to you that it's actually evidence that something happened in the past but it did not take your life it could have took you out it there's another person that would have went to the world there's other people that shake their fist toward God come on be mature tonight I'm asking are young people and children everyone they shake their fists toward God say how could you do that to me well you're gonna understand one day that there's wounds that happen to all of us then they become scars in this picture something might have happened and it came very very close through their face that if that would have hit their eyes or went a little bit God God rich in Mercy like I talked about this young lady just a few months ago in this horrible head-on collision and and just wrecked and flown to the hospital and gone through actually years of therapy and things in her arrow in her and now when she gave birth to a child that she has to have it cesarean because of her hips being in a certain way but years ago months ago when I met with her and she had black you know um fingering and now she's walking saintly and living and married and as a child and her spiritual life like I said has gone up it took something to get their attention so we all have scars we all have wounds but I want you to after tonight's service to start looking at that is actually it's healing healing has taken place it's actually something that God allowed to happen in your life I'm not saying God caused it he allowed it to happen but it didn't lead to your death stop blaming it all on God when moving times it's just life it's actually something that could have took your life but you made it through and you need to stop and instead of getting that you know singing that song Somebody done somebody wrong song You need to start saying thank you Jesus I love you Lord I'm going to serve you in spite of this I'm gonna come out of this I'm coming Lord I'm not going to become bitter I'm not going to become hard in God I sense myself becoming that way and I'm not gonna let that happen oh God and it's in your time of wounding release is the spirit of God and that's called character and that's what you're gonna take to heaven with you is your character God's molding you he's shaping your life I trust this is okay in the next photo you see a bad bad burn but you see the results after four months of of healing how it can become a scar and I looked across the parking lot and I thought if they can have a wound healing Center for someone in the world that has had an accident or had an injury what about people in the message we serve a great God we serve a god of the Universe I believe he's interested I believe he knows the things we've gone through and sometimes we can go for months and years and hear messages and go through services and listen to tapes and then all of a sudden it's like we have a weekend of services or there's a special service or a special meeting or something happens and it's like God begins to reveal himself to us that he cares for us that he knows where we're at I think that's what he's saying tonight he's saying I will restore I'm I'm here I've got you you say but I'm falling but he's saying my arms are here to catch you say I don't know how this is all going to work out it's like me dropping this glass and it just shattering everywhere well how are we going to put brother John I mean let's talk how are we going to put this all together well I don't know brother I don't know sister we can all get our gorillas you know glue and our super glue and brother there's thousands of pieces just go buy another one we'd say no for a Believer for a seed of God he is not there is no other person you are the person he he allowed that but I was dropped I was brother John this happened to me don't you even care it's like you just some light thing and you're not you're not even serious about it we can get that way sometimes we can we can be kind of jokey and laughing when really maybe we need to be more serious we need to be like our sister was in our pictures we need to be desperate about our teenagers we need to be desperate and sometimes it takes a a real jolt or something to get our attention I remember sitting in a coffee shop with a young man from Africa and now he's in the prime of his life been born and raised in the message and it went to a youth camp in my he was just the star of the Youth Camp they loved him the young people that could see he was magnetized to him but he also had been offered scholarships and he had also been offered to play in the NFL and now this young man was was coming to that time of his life and I knew him well I knew his family well and I could tell we had gone through a camp and God had dealt with his life and he had a real gift to to work with the young people he could have been a real blessing and I was sitting in the coffee shop and I gave him the story of me on an airplane and I was flying I think through Detroit and I could I was sitting in an economy coach and I could tell that there was someone in first class I recognized the person I didn't know who they was but I I recognized that I knew them from somewhere and sure enough when they got off the plane and they went down and they got into the terminal everybody was wanting their autograph and one in their autograph it was turned out to be the coach of the Seattle Seahawks that's our local football team and I recognized him oh that's the coach of the Seattle Seahawks that's why he was flying through Detroit and people was wanting his autograph so I brought that up to this young man sitting there at the table I said hear the Lord used you at these meetings and you could see that there's he dealt with your life and you are at a junction and I said now there's there's Great Men there was there's universities that are flying to be with you your parents in your house to sign you to be on their team they want you and it's it's serious this is on social media so it's nothing anything private and they're coming and they're this is how the quality he was and I said you hear you're at a crossroad I said I would like to sign you up to be in the Lord's army to be on the Lord's team I said here are these coaches and here's these great people they're flying and they're now they're asking they they are wanting you to play for them when I said there's other young men that God could really use you with in the church or you could be a real blessing I said I could I was appealing to the spiritual side of this young man to he could really be a blessing I said you can be in a local team you could be the star and a local team you don't have to go here and go there in big stadiums my stadiums just literally rocking with thousands of fans and he played for them he went on to play in the stadiums and he went on to sign for the NFL team until an injury happened and you know what friends that's just like the devil he'll hang something out in front of you and all you need you'll be a superstar one day and carted off the field the next and like after a while you're just forgotten Satan will do that he'll do that to our young people he'll do that to a brother in the church to a sister in the church he'll start whispering little lies to them and you know the man next door and and you know what you could be and hear your husband's not respecting you and you've got all these children in their diapers and all the things you do and nobody takes you for who you really are and you're taken for granted and a sister can start to feel that pull but it's not always glorious it's not always breaking up homes and breaking up relationships the answers and I thought God if the world would have a wound healing Center surely there's a place that a Believer that's going through a time of wounding can run into and be saved amen I see that it's 8 34. so we're over our time what do you think about this tonight what do you think about what I'm talking about we have sisters that are going through these things Brothers that are going through these things and David prayed like this bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits let's say oh all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles Hallelujah Lord that's what I trust would happen after tonight is that some of you would lift up your wings and just flutter them a little bit let's start flying a little bit you say well I don't think I can do that brother John I'm so anxious and nervous I I just feel I'm just gonna go right out of here and go back home that's where I always feel the safest is when I'm all alone no you're just all alone with your thoughts and the devil is just ratcheting it up more and more and more and you're not happy and you're not satisfied while you're in this presence is when we need a release can we release ourselves tonight for ourselves and for others let's not forget his benefits and the way she deals and his benefit package is just out of this world I mean that Hallelujah the salary for you is out of this world it's it's eternity it's the future home it's it's literally out of this world see I've been I've been persecuted brother John I've been rejected I've been despised I'm dealing with rejection right now the Bible talks about that despise not the days of Small Beginnings Paul told Timothy to let no man despise the youth how many knows that scripture let no man despise thy youth or to Titus he said let no man despise you that means to look down on you and Scorn and bad mouth you don't let it now when Paul said that let no man despise your youth he what he did he was not saying when they despise you take up arms and let's all be like militant and go take them out you know you despise me I'm taking you [Music] let no man despise you he wasn't saying if they do despise you take them out destroy him on social media no that's not what he meant because they will despise you they will look down on you they will say you're nothing you're oddballs you're weird what he was saying to Timothy was don't let it affect you don't let it move you did you get that that's what he meant let no man despise your youth mean they will despise you because you're younger you're just a youth you're younger than them you're a startup you know you've had to now go out on a limb because something happened in your life and now you're going to have to make a change and you feel despised and you feel like rejected like I I used to be the one they wanted to sing a special I used to be the one they wanted to be a teacher I used to be a now like I'm so ashamed Brother John I'm so embarrassed like even to see the other believers I and Satan wants to make you feel rejected and despised and misunderstood and you start feeling reproached and you really start feeling little but you're not in God's eyes nothing's ever changed I hope that I hope that helps someone I will restore to you the years that the cankerworm has eaten the canker where the caterpillar and Palmer worm I'm just gonna take a few more minutes because tomorrow morning I'm speaking on another subject so can I take a few more minutes restoration takes time as we said earlier miracles happen in an instant but healing takes time any of you that's ever worked in restoration or working on a building or something being restored know that it takes time is that true when you talk about things happen like disasters and recoveries and restoration and protection things disasters happen tornadoes damage snow flooding fire certain things happen it starts to over it takes time to recover I'm not here tonight with some magic wand and there's no Minister that can just wave over you and it's like well you know brother John I went to this meeting I felt really good and then those are things that you have to deal with oftentimes for the rest of your life oh that's not what some of you wanted to hear was it any of you that knows about restoration and knows about these things and even before and after photos it's not just a matter of a five-minute sermon it's not a one-week process these things restoration takes time here's something in New York that um from on the left hand side you can see 1948 there's the before and then there's the after it takes time for restoration if you want the real beauty of something to come out then you've got to be willing hear me out to have patience with God and you've got to have patience with yourself and you've got to have patience with others I know you're a little church but sometimes we need to have more patience for others because there's a work in progress and it looks like you're spinning your wheels with this fella or the sister just looks like she's always sick she's always their family's always sick there's always 9-1-1 they're always in his life well there's probably times in your life God felt like going up and maybe other people like they're never going to be safe they're never gonna work out they'll never be and then then time goes on and those people are the ones that turn out to be standing in it you all know what I'm talking about sometimes all those people I'm sure they're the man they're always this and their children are disorderly and they're always this job and that job and this house and then the years go by and those are the people still in the church then the others that are you know they're wealthy and they're educated and they're this and they drive around their Beamers and there's Teslas and and then time goes on and they leave the message all right I'm sorry and here is that couple or that family in the church that was so messed up and you're looking at it in 2022 and saying that's incredible well that's what God that's how God deals praise the Lord I mean you're one of those I was talking to and all the salt on the roads and things and how cars and Automobiles can get kind of weathered after a few years well if you're talking about an automobile restoration it takes time we want drive-through restoration drive through you know I'm a mess it's horrible yeah five minutes glory to God hallelujah you know don't we I mean we want to be in the Statue of a perfect man tomorrow brother honey that's my Starbucks McDonald's Tim Hortons drive-through man I mean we want to get this and let's go man and we want that spiritually we want to let's let's go you know let's be and when it's not like that it's like oh ah a and we want drive through restoration and drive through change and we just want to Blink and Sunday night it's uh there's no problems but Monday morning comes every week and we gotta go right back to dealing with the issue your bank account the relationship and we need God to work on the other end of the line sometimes can the church say Amen we need to start praying like that that the Lord would start working on the other end because Lord you know that I've tried you know that what can we do Lord and we can come out of a weekend of services like this and just feel like wow that was wonderful something go sideways next week or blow up in our face and we wonder like what was it even real yes it was real God was God Was preparing you for that are you listening so this restoration by God oftentimes we look at it like this an old house or an old place and in a time of restoration and God turns it to that we we look at a situation and it can turn from this on the inside and then when God gets done with it it's totally renovated I'm talking about restoration and I will restore and some of you tonight after tonight I believe the Lord is speaking to you that it's time for you to come into a season of recovery and restoration and stop talking about all the years just stop talking about all the things that's happened to you bad and all the things that were said and you're reliving it over and over and over and you're killing yourself and it took a little Minister from back West to come here back east and maybe shake you up a little bit and say you need to put a period there and say I'm going on to Restoration I'm going on to recovery I'm coming out of this I'm not gonna be a mournful dead Christian if everything goes south if everybody else leaves I'm gonna be a believer I Love You Lord and friends you start having an attitude like that comes from the word things begin to change it becomes creative and I'm ending right now I'm ending the service it's just like here we are at evening Light Fellowship we are the Sheep of his pastor and sheep are dumb hello well before we're finishing strong aren't we I'm really yeah we are Venice and strong sheep are dumb and they need a shepherd and they don't know how to find their way I'm dumb and I need a shepherd and I don't know the way but I have Jesus the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want so you take the scriptures that all of you know and you have it in your hallway and on the refrigerator but do you have it in your heart the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. I shall not be mournful I'm not going to be a bad sheep here we are we're just coming right down home I'm going to feed from his word I'm going to drink from his presence and here it is we're closing it out I want the Lord Jesus to put his come into the room now here you've been laying here this whole last few minutes and the great physician has been touching your life supernaturally just guiding and moving guiding the hands of the physician for years the Lord might have molded brother John to say some of the things I did tonight and you don't need to know what we've gone through you don't need to know our pain or our wounds or our scars but maybe the Lord would do all of that for brother Lush all these years and and your little church has has actually spawned hundreds of churches in Africa and from the website and people have known the message and you've supported in other churches and other believers have been made strong and many of them I've been to Africa I've been to and their churches are larger than your church their restrooms are some of them more than you have they're Pastor studies are four times as big as your pastor study and here the last weekend of services I think that you're of special meetings in this little building and it seems like God is about ready to bless your life to Crown your ministry and say I'm I'm going to give you a building that's 10 times what you have now is that what it is I'm gonna give you a sanctuary where you might have to put up walls or something I don't know it's huge and you have a fellowship hall and you have offices and you have thing and you have a parking lot a parking lot what's a parking lot that's where you park cars you know and there's enough parking really yeah we're it's gonna be huge well I just feel like it's the Lord blessing your life forgive me I'm an outsider but I feel like you've been Faithful over the years and God's given you above and beyond he's not just giving you a double blessing he's like giving you a quadruple blessing and I think some of you need to change your attitude and learn to accept the crowning time of your life and you're saying you're so humble oh no Lord you know we're hum no just give us a little place you know don't talk about my mansion on the hilltop just get me there in a log cabin and God's saying I'm giving you a mansion Oh Brother John a honeymoon of a thousand years we only had a few days when we were married maybe a weekend God says just stop your talking I'm giving you a thousand years [Music] y'all remember the guy comes you know puts in a couple gold bars into his bag up to heaven and gets up there and the angels are all looking they said what's that stuff he pulls out these gold bars these are gold bars and they're all laughing the angels are laughing what are you laughing about that's what the that's what the streets are paved with here straights are paved with gold here you know throw away your gold bars you know it's like and you work and strive and then we're going to have this and God just says no I'm giving you all of that plus plus plus is that is that why the Lord laid that on my heart today that the wounded ones when in heaven because down on Earth you feel like you lose and you feel like you're thrown to the side and you feel like Lord after all these years in our our little place and I guess we're all the Rapture is going to happen and we're going to have 40 or 50 of us and the Lord's like well there's more to come you got to make room for him and I'm gonna provide and I'm gonna sell your old building

heels just forget about that you know and in a few weeks this is like a memory here we're in November and literally in a month just a few weeks but I mean in a month it's just all going to be over

lonely Church there in St John's a Newfoundland we're way up there you know we're just some little church we did so much for the Lord over the years brother bless God brother we did so much when the Rapture happened we were despised and rejected of all men and women with a whole lot God said be quiet put a smile on your face When the Saints Go Marching In amen hallelujah and you're like Lord I'm
