[0:18] concerning leadership we better be led
[0:21] by the spirit we better come under God's
[0:24] leadership and not the devil's
[0:26] leadership and there are those that the

[0:33] for them the faith that pleased God in
[0:35] the day the hour the age in which they

[1:07] goes back beyond that it goes even even
[1:10] into heaven amen because where this is
[1:12] where the devil come from was heaven a
[1:14] man and he got to the place where he got
[1:17] lifted up in his pride and there were so
[1:20] many thousands of angels that followed
[1:22] the devil's leadership amen and God

[2:07] allowed all of these things to happen he
[2:09] is allowing it to happen
[2:11] a man for a man to get down to the
[2:13] lowest of the low a man and he comes
[2:16] down with to identify with them and to
[2:19] bring them back up but we talk about the
[2:21] love of God a man I pray God in the name
[2:24] of Jesus then we got DD divine love a
[2:27] man not just human love not religious
[2:31] love and these things but we got divine

[3:05] extreme

[3:07] what happened they put him out of the
[3:09] church amen they put pray so they're
[3:12] gonna then and they took their stand
[3:14] against the believers they want to stay
[3:16] with the word unto finally God had to
[3:19] bread to send the message down to call
[3:20] us out
[3:21] amen amen to bring you out of it to
[3:24] bring me out of it be a man to add to it
[3:27] so that we are fellowship with him and
[3:29] he have fellowship with us amen so he

[3:36] we're under the right and leadership a
[3:39] may and the right anointing any man with
[3:41] brother it's only 1 or 2 you're in
[3:44] either under the leadership of the an
[3:46] anointing of the of Jesus love of God or
[3:49] you're under the anointing and
[3:51] leadership of the devil amen and
[3:54] remember again that it's so close they
[3:56] would deceive the very elect a man but
[3:59] God has given us by grace the anointing
[4:03] to discern the right from the wrong amen
[4:05] you need to recognize the devil amen so
[4:09] that we're not going to be deceived get
[4:11] he behind me Satan for those savourest
[4:14] not the things that be of God a man so
[4:17] how every movie we're going to recognize
[4:19] you know the devil well if he's going to
[4:21] influence you to go to to to go back
[4:24] go forward a mayor that's exactly what
[4:27] he's going to do and he's done it in
[4:29] every age brother/sister he's done in
[4:32] Luther's age Wesley sage the Salvation
[4:35] Army the Pentecostal age and now he's
[4:37] doing it around the message the people
[4:39] that they came out and they and they
[4:41] went forward and they did this they
[4:43] stood for the word they stayed with the
[4:45] word a man their hunger and thirst was
[4:47] from more of God and was to please God a
[4:50] man but then the enemy came in and began
[4:52] to influence the people and it becomes a
[4:55] form of godliness and denying the power
[4:57] there are a man it is a form of
[5:00] godliness but denying the power of
[5:02] godliness denying the power of God
[5:05] denying the power of our Lord Jesus
[5:07] Christ amen
[5:08] Germany that's their endeavoring to make
[5:10] us into his image by the grace of God
[5:13] endeavoring to get us back to where we
[5:16] come from by the grace of God amen
[5:18] brother
[5:19] it's tremendous it's a UUA uragan you're
[5:22] going to be led by the Holy Spirit
[5:23] you're going to be led by the devil one
[5:25] or the other and that doesn't mean
[5:28] you're going to deny the word no the the
[5:31] first station deny the word they weren't
[5:33] denying Jesus but they had left Jesus
[5:35] they left her what do you mean left him
[5:38] they had left is influenced a man so
[5:42] that Christ was not influencing them
[5:44] everything that they were the thinking
[5:46] or doing or are saying in their lives
[5:49] because now they're under the influence
[5:51] of the Spirit of the Nicolaitans
[5:54] a man that was causing a man it was
[5:57] causing them to compromise a little here
[5:59] and a little there a man and as time
[6:01] went on they begin to compromise more
[6:03] and more and more amen and even even in
[6:07] Luther's age Wesley's age they
[6:08] eventually began to begin to go back God
[6:11] moved them forward for the first three
[6:13] or four generations and they went on
[6:15] with God and got closer to God and love
[6:18] God and they were rejoicing in the hope
[6:21] they made of the revelation of the word
[6:23] that God gave to Luther and Wesley and
[6:26] the benicar CIL's but again the enemy
[6:28] got in a
[6:29] and and the enemy got in to influence
[6:32] him this way this way that way to had a
[6:34] little their take away a little there
[6:36] Amen that he was he wasn't asking them
[6:38] to deny the word but he was that he was
[6:41] just not going to let them know just as
[6:43] he did in the Garden of Eden yes God
[6:45] said but I say unto you and he didn't he
[6:48] didn't leave out the word he quoted the
[6:51] word a man and the same thing in the
[6:54] first days the same thing right on down
[6:56] to every age they were they they had to
[6:58] deal with Satan quoting the word they
[7:01] had to do with Satan ministering the
[7:02] word a man Satan a whole brother's
[7:06] sister the grace of God to help us to
[7:08] recognize how deceiving it is amen and
[7:12] to be on our guard so make sure that
[7:14] they will whatever I do however I do it
[7:17] whenever I do it wherever I do it it's
[7:19] going to be the leadership of the Holy
[7:21] Ghost amen you know when we say it's not
[7:24] me that lives as Christ I live within me
[7:26] and if it's crazy living in me then
[7:28] Christ is leading me Amen I'm not
[7:30] following my leadership I'm not doing
[7:33] what I feel to do or what I want to do
[7:35] I'm doing what Christ wants me to do
[7:37] it's not me that lives his life as
[7:39] Christ that lives their life in me amen
[7:41] so brother sister go back and reflect on
[7:44] your life
[7:45] well even since you got up this morning
[7:48] Amen reflect on your life for the last
[7:50] three hours reflect on your life for the
[7:53] last few days Amen wasn't the leadership
[7:55] of the Holy Ghost in your life or
[7:57] whether the whether the influence of the
[7:59] devil that you did what you did you said
[8:01] what you said that you were thinking
[8:03] what you were thinking a man that you
[8:05] were acting the way that you were acting
[8:07] a whole brother sister Grace in the name
[8:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that were
[8:12] we're going to be under the right
[8:14] leadership amen and I'll show you right
[8:17] now you're on you're either under the
[8:19] right leadership or the wrong leadership
[8:21] Amen the wrong leadership is going to
[8:23] take you into a tribulation a Great
[8:25] Tribulation Amen it takes something to
[8:27] hell and whereas the right leadership is
[8:30] taking us into the resurrection and the
[8:32] rapture is taking it into the presence
[8:35] of Almighty God amen
[8:37] so we got to make our calling and
[8:39] election sure by
[8:40] our leadership sure a mayor so that is
[8:44] Satan that they are not Satan but it's
[8:46] Jesus that's influencing me and the way
[8:49] that I live and the way that I think in
[8:51] the way that I talk and the way that I
[8:53] act and my attitude and my spirit amen
[8:56] praise the name of the Lord
[8:59] old brother sister let's lift me on our
[9:02] guard let's listen be constantly
[9:04] watching any man let's be constantly
[9:08] comparing ourselves with the Word of God
[9:10] judging ourselves by the word and
[9:12] Birdland don't please and the name of
[9:14] the Lord don't do what the devil would
[9:16] have you to do and then what would he
[9:18] have you to do he would have you to look
[9:20] into the mirror of the word amen
[9:23] and forget it amen
[9:26] oh yeah that's that's that don't don't
[9:28] worry about that go on a man you're
[9:30] saved amen don't worry what that Jesus
[9:33] did this Jesus did that amen oh yeah
[9:36] he'll give Jesus the the the preeminence
[9:40] for this and and the preeminence for
[9:42] that and so on amen but Jesus did this
[9:46] but Jesus did that but that's what he
[9:49] was doing with Eve in the Garden of Eden
[9:51] hey man
[9:53] brother the Adam was under God's
[9:55] leadership Eve came under the devil's
[9:57] leadership amen
[9:59] she should have one of our brothers our
[10:02] brother Ali preached here one time and
[10:04] he said he said v's that went out from
[10:06] when under her husband's leadership he
[10:10] she went out from under Adams leadership
[10:12] and where she shouldn't I went through
[10:14] that tree of knowledge of good and evil
[10:15] amen amen
[10:18] and when when that did the sermon began
[10:20] to deal with her and begin to reason
[10:23] with her Amen brother cast down
[10:25] reasoning and they believe the word they
[10:28] stay with the word line up with the word
[10:31] amen
[10:32] God is judging us by the word the truth
[10:34] the whole truth nothing but the truth
[10:36] amen any-any and he persuaded Eve he was
[10:40] leading me to believe the word plus he
[10:44] said God has said yes yes he said God
[10:46] has said anybody said I say unto you you
[10:50] shall not surely die now he wasn't
[10:52] denying
[10:53] word but he was going to head to the
[10:55] word and he was going to he was going to
[10:57] bring you to doubt a little here and
[10:59] question a little there a man and
[11:01] brother work we're in that stage right
[11:04] now around the message where the enemy
[11:06] is where the enemy is taking control and
[11:08] influence and a lot of believers and
[11:10] causing them the question the message
[11:12] here question it here that is to know
[11:15] that a man old brother/sister that's why
[11:17] yes why we're still here since their
[11:20] prophet has been gone in 1965 a man
[11:23] why because yes siree it is to bring out
[11:27] the faith that is in the bright it is to
[11:30] bring out a the the lack of faith that
[11:32] is in the in the false bright a man
[11:35] because there are people that profess to
[11:38] be the bright they're not bright a man
[11:40] but there is a true bright the true
[11:42] bride is going to stay with the word a
[11:44] man by the false right she's going to
[11:47] add to it or take away from it here and
[11:50] there and there there are many that are
[11:52] doing that today and when it comes to
[11:54] the message of the hour they're there
[11:56] and they're finding a thought we'd
[11:57] william branham finding this fault oh
[11:59] well oh he couldn't have been a prophet
[12:02] then that's that's why those are those
[12:04] are many many I have left the message in
[12:07] the last three years a man exactly
[12:10] neither and I've had to deal with him
[12:13] and concern concerning the the prophet
[12:16] and of course you know to they that
[12:21] they're accusing me as they accused
[12:23] William Branham so they're accusing
[12:24] brothers rural as well what they're
[12:27] accusing brothers rural of trying to
[12:30] cover up the promised mistakes as the
[12:34] day as the devil right here brothers
[12:36] they're the one to doing it a man and
[12:39] because he was trying to cover are the
[12:41] devil's the serpent was trying to cover
[12:44] up this and trying to cover that trying
[12:45] to hide this from me and to get her to
[12:47] believe it this way not that way a man
[12:50] and he said that a brother drove us in
[12:53] Newfoundland there and he did I lied
[12:55] brother mark I think as well and he said
[12:58] my brother-in-law Seshadri sees his
[13:00] preaching progressive revelation he said
[13:03] to hide he said and cover up the
[13:05] mistakes of the Prophet
[13:07] because they think they feel that their
[13:08] property you know he said this in
[13:11] 1963-64 65 then he said this way you
[13:15] know back here in 1965 5653 and why and
[13:20] I says progressive revelation and they
[13:22] didn't they didn't believe in it they
[13:24] believed that if he was a property with
[13:26] a tree he would have known owner back
[13:28] then and God would have revealed to him
[13:30] back then he would have preached the
[13:31] background and I said well I said
[13:33] brother I said I say I want to remind
[13:36] you I said you weren't born with grade
[13:37] 11 and I said you progressed into it and
[13:42] and their response was well brother
[13:45] Louis I guess we'll leave the message
[13:47] and that's what they did and more are
[13:51] also leaving the message because they're
[13:53] following the devil's leadership and not
[13:55] God's leadership but then there are
[13:57] other Asuma that are that are under
[13:58] Satan's leadership that are going to
[14:00] stay with the message and they're going
[14:02] to and they're going to interpret it and
[14:03] their way and believe it their way
[14:06] Amen em and say well this is this is
[14:08] what it means is it what I mean oh
[14:10] brother sister the scripture is clear in
[14:13] what what it means the scripture is
[14:15] clear concerning the men demanding what
[14:18] god has done in this hour but the
[14:20] messenger of Malachi 4 amen brother and
[14:24] is here incest alone Ian's got to
[14:25] descend from heaven with a shout the
[14:27] voice of the Archangel the Trump of God
[14:30] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[14:32] we return live remain are going to be
[14:34] caught up with him to meet the Lord in
[14:35] the air so brother what God said God is
[14:38] God as son and God is doing amen so
[14:43] that's and that's what we're believing
[14:44] that's what that's what we're living for
[14:46] a man that's what we're testifying about
[14:48] a man
[14:49] we're not we're not looking for those
[14:51] looking for that where we're entering
[14:52] into what God has done wherever they
[14:55] making it flesh in you and me a man
[14:58] brothers sister that's what God is
[15:01] looking for somebody that really
[15:02] honestly believes it a man they don't
[15:07] doubt it
[15:07] Amen believe us now this see that was
[15:13] the question he in his cell phone
[15:15] ministry that he had the challenge
[15:17] Martha with Bentley
[15:19] this what was it it was concerning his
[15:22] third pole of his ministry and that was
[15:25] the resurrection and the rapture and now
[15:28] in the Alpha ministry and the third pole
[15:30] of his ministry in this hour now does
[15:32] the third pole of within Browns ministry
[15:34] it was the third pole of the ministry of
[15:37] the son of man a man concerning the
[15:40] resurrection and the rapture and
[15:42] rapturing faith now a the question is
[15:44] believe us now this a man praise the
[15:48] name of the Lord so brother Steve what
[15:51] God said God does and he does of the way
[15:54] that he says it amen
[15:57] but the important thing is that we got
[15:58] to make sure we're under the right of
[16:00] leadership and that are going to stay
[16:02] under what God said stay with what God
[16:06] said we're not going to head to it we're
[16:08] not going to take away from it amen
[16:10] we're going to follow God's leadership
[16:13] amen and it were born again and under
[16:16] the leadership of God brother we
[16:18] consider his leadership in every area of
[16:21] our lives
[16:22] amen and it's not again what I've what I
[16:26] want to do and it's not what I where I
[16:28] want to go into what what else what does
[16:30] God wants you to do where does God want
[16:33] you to go amen what and what does God
[16:36] wants you to say Amen praise the name of
[16:39] the Lord so what was for what you have
[16:41] done where you have gone and what you
[16:44] have said and what you're saying and how
[16:45] you're talking how you live is that the
[16:47] leadership of the Holy Ghost in your
[16:49] life is a God in your life or is it or
[16:52] is the Satan Amen brother God elbows
[16:55] because we in the first age they had the
[16:57] deal was Satan amen because we were
[17:00] warned of false prophets we're a warned
[17:04] of false ministries God has got it
[17:06] through a fivefold ministry but the
[17:09] devlins got a false faithful ministry
[17:11] amen because the Bible says even the
[17:14] Devils angels he said are preaching a
[17:16] man preaching the Bible preaching the
[17:19] word even the Devils angels are
[17:21] professing to believe this and believe
[17:23] that and believe the message a man
[17:25] brother you better be under the right
[17:27] anointing amen better than the seed of
[17:30] God under the anointing of God
[17:32] with the life of God in you so that God
[17:35] has made flesh in your and the devil not
[17:37] the devil there are some brother there's
[17:40] not not Jesus and pleasures the devil in
[17:42] flesh that's right amen how do you know
[17:46] that I know that by their attitude I
[17:49] know that by their spirit I know that by
[17:51] the motors from the objectives they got
[17:52] in this life I know that why by by what
[17:55] they're putting the emphasis on in this
[17:57] world amen
[17:58] what they're concerned about in this
[18:00] world amen they're more concerned about
[18:03] the natural things than they are about
[18:04] the spiritual whereas if we are the
[18:06] Bride of Christ under the leadership of
[18:08] the Holy Ghost
[18:09] whether we're just concerned about God
[18:11] what do you want me to do Lord where do
[18:13] you want me to go what would you want me
[18:15] to say I want to do it in the name of
[18:16] the Lord Jesus Christ amen brother again
[18:20] that's there again they get you consumed
[18:22] and then to - to what Paul said it's not
[18:25] me that leaves us Christ liveth in me
[18:27] that's tremendous a man is not just by
[18:30] the doctrine and the letter of the word
[18:32] but it's the word himself it's the word
[18:36] himself in you it's the word himself
[18:38] living in you is the word himself
[18:40] controlling you a man again as John said
[18:44] in the beginning was the word and the
[18:46] Word was with God and the Word was God
[18:49] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[18:52] among us now the word is flesh in us a
[18:55] man because he has been moving by
[18:59] measure more and more and more and more
[19:01] until under the fullness of the Godhead
[19:03] bodily is in the brain brother it took
[19:07] the fullness of the Godhead bodily in
[19:09] the flesh called Jesus - what for - lay
[19:12] down his wave and pick it up again amen
[19:15] all the prophets were prophesying they
[19:17] had the power of God they had anointing
[19:19] of God but they lay down their lives but
[19:21] couldn't make a living here amen oh yeah
[19:23] some of them even even raised the dead
[19:25] but again when they died they they
[19:28] they're the wait on God amen praise the
[19:31] name of the Lord
[19:32] brother brother he is lay down their
[19:34] lives and they died but God in the again
[19:38] the God had ordained a resurrection and
[19:40] a rapture so a man according to the
[19:42] scriptures he would be made flesh in the
[19:44] bread

[19:47] Christ when the Bible says he shall
[19:49] descend from heaven with a shout Amen
[19:52] the voice of the Archangel message a man
[19:57] is going to be a message and what it's
[19:59] going to be the results of that message
[20:01] it's going to be the resurrection that
[20:03] any Christ will rise first then we which
[20:05] are alive remain are going to be caught
[20:07] up together with them to meet the Lord
[20:09] in the air
[20:10] amen but as I've already emphasized
[20:13] we're going to me to me in the cloud of
[20:15] angels the probably of God was caught up
[20:17] into that cloud and though the bride is
[20:20] going to be caught up into that cloud a
[20:22] million but brother we've got to make
[20:24] sure that we're under the right
[20:26] leadership run to the leadership of the
[20:28] Holy Ghost not the devil as I said the
[20:31] Holy Ghost wants to wants us to stay
[20:33] with the truth the whole truth and
[20:35] nothing but the truth don't answer it
[20:37] don't take from it don't interpret it
[20:39] your way you let God interpret it in and
[20:42] through your life amen praise the name
[20:45] of the Lord but the devil is there to
[20:47] interpret it he wants to hand to it he
[20:49] wants to change any air changer there

[21:40] be just a little different yes God said
[21:42] but say again as I said by the we got a
[21:48] stay with the word when we first came
[21:50] into it it's not again as I did I did do
[21:54] it and you're familiar with it well

[23:25] so that they're going to be proved that
[23:27] they're led by the Holy Ghost brother do
[23:30] to it to add a word to had to change
[23:33] something the Prophet said and explained
[23:35] it in a in a different way so as to
[23:37] allow us to do this and this and this
[23:39] brother that's the devil that's Satan's
[23:41] leadership amen
[23:44] oh yeah and Satan is is God delete got
[23:47] his leadership in a lot of believers
[23:48] today a lot of brothers not a sister's
[23:50] just a way they're acting the way
[23:52] they're talking their attitudes their
[23:53] spirits and even sometimes the way that
[23:56] they dress and the way they oh yeah
[23:57] there's there's many many men
[24:00] many under that influence and they think
[24:03] oh well you know what
[24:05] like they said oh well as long as I got
[24:07] long haired that no make a difference
[24:08] you know I can do it this way I can do
[24:11] it that way the prophet of God said he
[24:12] said you sisters
[24:13] I taught I told you in the message how
[24:16] can I overcome he preached at Branham
[24:18] tabernacle he said he said and he was
[24:22] talking to the sisters and brought him
[24:23] down a couple he said you didn't realize
[24:25] he said long hair looks so nice did you
[24:27] and he said that's why I said you want
[24:29] to do this with it and you want to do
[24:31] that with it you want to do something
[24:32] else with it he said why he's because
[24:35] you're ashamed he said of the of the
[24:37] spare tire on your head and the bun oh
[24:40] yeah
[24:43] why said what so whatever influence is
[24:46] that now Satan he said you want to be
[24:49] like your denominational sisters that's
[24:53] right
[24:53] they weren't dressed like their
[24:55] denominational sisters didn't want to
[24:56] act like the denominational sisters and
[24:58] still say they believe the message still
[25:00] go to a message church amen still maybe
[25:03] I have some books in there but message
[25:05] books in their house or whether or a
[25:06] Bible whatever amen oh brother don't
[25:10] they'll lift up their eyes in hell like
[25:13] the rich young ruler you know brother
[25:16] Rams text in the message he preached
[25:20] leadership he preached the message
[25:23] December the 7th 1965 in California and
[25:27] his text I was surprised
[25:30] his text concerned the rich young ruler
[25:34] amen he refused God's leadership he
[25:39] refused Jesus leadership but he took the
[25:41] devil's leadership amen jesus said do
[25:45] this this and this he said I've done
[25:46] that all my all my life come the
[25:48] commandments and Jesus and the Bible
[25:50] says Jesus loved him but he said one
[25:54] thing you liked how many things do we
[25:57] like a man there's one thing that Jesus
[26:01] saw in his life that was the leadership
[26:04] of the devil
[26:07] what does God see in your life go today
[26:10] when it comes to attitude and spirit
[26:11] well as God seeing you
[26:13] in me when it comes to an edit and again
[26:15] it comes to it really comes down to the
[26:17] your editor than your spirit a million
[26:21] when it comes to the works rather when
[26:23] it comes to the works or conversation or
[26:26] words it's the result of an attitude or
[26:28] your spirit yeah what does the person
[26:32] talk like this what do they act like
[26:34] that
[26:34] it's an attitude and a spirit that's
[26:38] influencing you amen
[26:40] you no matter how much you say you
[26:41] believe in your head God looks into your
[26:43] heart hey man no matter how much that
[26:46] rich young ruler said he believed this
[26:49] in his head and he and he obey the word
[26:51] he obeyed the word he obey the word well
[26:53] here was the word of flesh and he said
[26:55] one thing y'all like us why because he
[26:58] discerned something in his soul anybody
[27:02] it has earned something in his spirit
[27:04] amen he said I want you to go sell all
[27:07] you got and give to the poor and he said
[27:09] come follow me what Lord I kept I keep
[27:19] your word I believe your word I do this
[27:22] I do this I do this as I've said I said
[27:25] you know from my youth up and now you
[27:27] want me to sell all I got and give to
[27:29] the poor come follow you he was testing
[27:34] his spirit of sacrifice the seal far he
[27:38] was willing to go with God to see if he
[27:42] would be truly led by the Spirit of God
[27:44] and he refused and always struck him so
[27:48] hard that he turned and he walked away
[27:51] from Jesus but he lifted up his eyes in
[27:55] hell he never dreamed that probably God
[27:58] said no doubt he said he said when when
[28:00] when when he died he had he had the
[28:03] biggest funeral he said anybody would
[28:05] have
[28:05] he said because of who he was because of
[28:08] his influence on the world and in the
[28:11] world and so on
[28:12] and he's Lazarus died they just took him
[28:14] out just maybe threw his body into into
[28:17] it into the place for the slaves oh yeah
[28:21] but the rich young ruler no doubt he got
[28:23] it all they got up and praised his name
[28:26] they gave him a high you know reputation
[28:32] and so on
[28:33] oh yeah but where was he spiritually he
[28:38] was in hell crying screaming where as
[28:44] Lazarus was in the bosom of Abraham Oh
[28:51] does your life reflect Lazarus spirit or
[28:56] does it reflect the spirit of the rich
[28:58] young ruler Amen because what your life
[29:02] reflects is an indication of the
[29:05] leadership your honor
[29:06] oh yeah what you doing how you do it
[29:10] when you do it as I said where you do it
[29:11] it shows you oh my we make decisions
[29:15] sometimes and brother I'll tell you this
[29:17] is not Jesus decision it's the devil's
[29:20] decision you know why because we're it's
[29:24] based on our feelings it's based on our
[29:26] emotions it's based on our senses but
[29:29] not on our faith sons and daughters of
[29:33] God are led by the Spirit of God brother
[29:40] let's not deny the leadership of Jesus
[29:43] Oh what when I believe this doctrine
[29:47] that doctrine no no you still it's not
[29:49] just a word there and we're in in in
[29:51] letter in a book it's the Word made
[29:55] flesh in you to accomplish what he wants
[30:00] to accomplish now brother don't don't go
[30:03] back let's go forward this day under the
[30:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[30:09] by the grace of Almighty God and the
[30:11] Prophet is bringing it out we need this
[30:13] right leadership to get to the rapture
[30:17] now Lazarus would make it to the rapture
[30:21] but the returner wouldn't those were
[30:24] caught up with this world and the things
[30:25] of this world they're not gonna make it
[30:28] in a resurrection or a rapture no way
[30:32] where is where is God hidden and God
[30:35] revealed in some
[30:36] you got Elvis we had to be certain we
[30:50] get it right make sure we got the right
[30:54] leadership as the powder God said in
[31:01] 1964 he said now my subject this morning
[31:05] I trust that God will reveal this and
[31:07] each time if you who take the tapes and
[31:10] listen and I open trust that you have
[31:12] had spiritual understanding amen yes
[31:20] spiritual understanding what God who God
[31:22] is where God is what God's doing what
[31:26] God requires of us now I've got an
[31:30] intellectual understanding or God wants
[31:32] us to leave the denominational Creason
[31:35] and believe the the word God once want
[31:38] you to surrender so he can make the word
[31:41] living living you amen he said I try
[31:47] open trust that you have had spiritual
[31:49] understanding many of intellectual
[31:51] understanding and are spiritual and he
[31:54] sort of one God has been trying to get
[31:56] over to the church without saying it
[31:59] right out catch the revelation in your
[32:05] heart and in your yeah not your head but
[32:07] in your heart you know what God is doing
[32:09] because it's raised here in the word and
[32:12] he said see he said we have to say
[32:16] things in such a way that it might thin
[32:20] down
[32:22] I believe brother our brother Jonathan
[32:29] brought it out any man concerning Jesus
[32:36] had too many disciples and they weren't
[32:40] all true believers some were led by the
[32:44] spirit
[32:45] others were led by the devil so Jesus
[32:49] and said except you eat the flesh of the
[32:52] son of man and drink his blood you have
[32:54] no life in you know what how come we eat
[32:59] your flesh and drink your blood by
[33:02] eating and drinking the word but they
[33:04] didn't know that they rebuked that they
[33:08] said it who can receive this and they
[33:11] and this seventy walked away
[33:14] how many preachers would cut down under
[33:17] their congregation by preaching the
[33:19] truth the whole truth
[33:21] amen even brother BAM did that because
[33:27] he preached Church one and when he
[33:28] preached Church horde there was a lot
[33:29] left random Tabernacle yeah and when he
[33:35] got into preaching this message in how
[33:37] can I overcome he said I know he said
[33:42] you're thinking how much longer are you
[33:45] gonna keep preaching that brother round
[33:47] he said I'm gonna keep preaching until
[33:49] you stop doing it
[33:52] amen and again others got up and left
[33:57] the church you mean yet believing that
[34:02] he was a prophet but you know what they
[34:03] wanted
[34:04] BAM tell you know what the trouble he
[34:06] had in Brown Tabernacle one of the
[34:08] problems he was dealing with they wanted
[34:09] they wanted him to go back to the signs
[34:11] and wonders they wanted to go back to
[34:14] the - you know the sign in his hand and
[34:16] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[34:17] the heart
[34:18] well he was but now he was responding by
[34:21] giving them the word Amen not just
[34:25] responding say you're thinking this and
[34:26] you're thinking that no no he gave them
[34:29] the word for everyday living not just
[34:33] for this issue in their life for that
[34:35] issue in their life but for to control
[34:36] them in every everything because there's
[34:44] alternate there's still a lot of
[34:45] believers doing what they want to do how
[34:47] they want to do it when they want to do
[34:49] it where they want to do it oh I like
[34:51] this I like this what does he like they
[34:55] never stopped to consider Jesus do you
[34:57] like this Lord Jesus is this pleasing to
[35:00] You Lord
[35:02] Lord forgive me if did I do anything
[35:05] wrong today Lord forgive me people a lot
[35:07] of you were just considered themselves
[35:08] Christians and you just go and do what
[35:10] they want to do you know this this and
[35:12] this because getting we're getting in a
[35:14] world now brother sister yeah there's no
[35:16] sin the people don't consider this sin
[35:21] that's seen there anything seen and and
[35:23] even a lot of believers they did to them
[35:28] there's no sin unless you don't don't
[35:31] believe this don't believe it this way
[35:32] if you don't believe it that way or
[35:33] that's in believe it if you believe it
[35:38] you can go and live it it reflect itself
[35:41] in you well I tell you it's getting to
[35:45] that place where there's nothing to sin
[35:49] anymore it's a deception of the devil
[35:53] they're following Satan's leadership and
[35:55] you better be careful even even with
[35:57] with with with cell phones there there
[36:02] there are people out there in the world
[36:03] that arise in judgment against believers
[36:05] now because even even again just
[36:09] recently I just say another another
[36:11] gentleman as through the cell phone away
[36:16] he got rid of it
[36:18] no because it was affecting his life and
[36:24] and he said this is not normal and we're
[36:29] not living in a normal world people
[36:33] think they got we got to have a cell
[36:35] phone we think we got it we got to be
[36:37] there so you can contact me anywhere
[36:38] anytime and so on know if Jesus was
[36:44] there I don't think he would even want a
[36:45] cell phone
[36:48] no and Jesus is there and this this
[36:53] brother got rid of his cell phone
[36:54] through that and brother it's it's the
[36:58] leadership of the devil in in technology
[37:01] in science it's the rear so the devil in
[37:06] and listen please in the name of Jesus
[37:08] leadership of the devil even in the
[37:10] internet please don't don't ignore it
[37:14] be on your guard oh yes Satan you talk
[37:20] about the Bible tells us they're gonna
[37:22] be false prophets false apostles false
[37:25] teachers and and brother they're all
[37:27] over the world on the Internet
[37:29] be on your guard and there's a lot of
[37:32] heat even don't don't think because oh
[37:34] this is a message preacher that's the
[37:36] message preached a sermon don't think
[37:37] because oh you identified with the
[37:39] message that is it could be Satan you
[37:46] know is that is that ministry or that
[37:48] church under God's leadership or under
[37:50] Satan's leadership you better and I will
[37:56] I determine it judge it by the word
[38:00] bring it back to the word not just all
[38:03] what the preacher said but what about
[38:06] the congregation is it bringing out the
[38:10] word into people more and more and more
[38:13] brothers sister it is a world where
[38:17] there's no more sin the bride is going
[38:20] to recognize the end but the world in
[38:23] general doesn't recognize sin anymore
[38:26] because everybody is doing everything
[38:30] god have mercy on us to make sure that
[38:35] it is striking us right he said we have
[38:42] to say it in such a way that it might
[38:44] thin down and yet there people want
[38:49] bigger churches and as I said the
[38:55] prophet of God spoke encouraged the
[38:58] pastor's of small churches he said don't
[39:01] be discouraged he said that's what God's
[39:03] going to use because if the rapture
[39:09] comes and it goes and the nobody will
[39:15] know only those that went until it'll
[39:20] take time and and they'll recognize Oh
[39:22] surely where's the rapture
[39:24] and that'll be a there's gonna be a lot
[39:27] of messy churches I've said that in 84
[39:30] when I preached in Brother Folgers I
[39:31] said listen after brides gone they'll
[39:34] still be preaching Malachi 4 yeah I
[39:38] preached that in brother fortress 1984
[39:42] and after the brides gone they'll still
[39:45] be preaching Malachi 4:2 God has sent a
[39:48] prophet and there's many big members of
[39:53] big churches they're gonna be wondering
[39:54] where's the rapture already happened
[39:57] didn't know it why because they were
[40:00] they were worldly and they were led by
[40:03] the devil not dead by Jesus so we have
[40:10] to say it in such a way they might thin
[40:12] down it might bring some to go out and
[40:16] it has some delay and some to ponder
[40:22] over but he said that's done purposely
[40:27] it must be done that way and some would
[40:31] say you mean God would purposely do a
[40:33] thing like that he certainly did and he
[40:37] does it yet today amen it's proving the
[40:43] leadership in the individuals life amen
[40:47] again in Revelation 3 we reference
[40:53] revelation to the first stage and the
[41:00] finally comes down to the last stage and
[41:03] the conclusion and the results of
[41:06] Satan's leadership what about the
[41:12] beginning and end of your life amen
[41:17] [Music]
[41:20] you can begin with God and in with the
[41:22] devil
[41:25] because I reach our ruler began with God
[41:27] and ended with the devil oh yeah
[41:34] Lazarus no maybe he but maybe he began
[41:37] with the devil and ended up with God his
[41:39] faith was in God he trusted God he loved
[41:44] God a man and brother the church came to
[41:49] the place where it eventually where had
[41:51] lost its love for Jesus now we see the
[41:54] proof of it because Jesus was put out
[41:57] and in verse 14 he said under the Angel
[42:00] of the Church of the Laodiceans write
[42:02] these things say the Amen
[42:06] that means the conclusion is the end the
[42:12] faithful and true witness meaning that
[42:17] there is a false witness in the church
[42:21] the faithful and true witness and the
[42:25] beginning hallelujah the beginning of
[42:28] the creation of God amen we're going
[42:33] from time to eternity
[42:36] wonderful and he said I know thy works
[42:41] not just a church remember the church is
[42:45] made up of people individuals in the
[42:50] church he's not referring to the
[42:52] building but those in the building amen
[42:57] he said I know thy works that thou art
[43:01] neither cold nor hot he meant he knew
[43:06] the works of the first-stage and comes
[43:10] right on down to the last stage he said
[43:14] you're not cold and you're not on amen I
[43:18] would that thou wert cold or hot so then
[43:23] because there are lukewarm and neither
[43:26] cold nor hot I will spew you or spit you
[43:30] out of my mouth
[43:35] and got lot goddess bit out of his mouth
[43:39] and their witnesses for the church they
[43:43] go to oh yeah they're witnesses now
[43:47] don't be a witness for the preacher be a
[43:50] witness for Jesus amen
[43:53] be a witness for Jesus and people are
[43:57] witnesses for their preachers oh yeah
[44:01] that's the truth brother they'll
[44:03] highlight this preacher I laid that
[44:05] preacher and put this one up but that
[44:07] one not another one no where's Jesus oh
[44:14] my
[44:15] no wonder the promise says you're gonna
[44:17] be surprised who made it and who didn't
[44:20] make it and God looked for it God looks
[44:26] for sincerity anything God looked for is
[44:31] humility amen those that are humble and
[44:37] sincere they're not looking for
[44:39] attention
[44:40] they're not looking to be to be to be to
[44:43] be I light it or I'll hell of a tit up
[44:46] and exalted no let's exalt Jesus this
[44:51] give Jesus the glory the praise and the
[44:54] honor in our lives
[44:56] amen in our testimony our witness
[44:59] everything is Jesus it's like I've been
[45:04] praying that the grace of God and the
[45:06] conviction of the Holy Ghost in a sister
[45:09] of another church that right right now
[45:11] maybe in palliative care in the Miller
[45:16] center and I've witnessed to her
[45:21] concerning the word because they belong
[45:27] to a certain church that don't believe
[45:29] in a certain thing and I said you don't
[45:32] believe this
[45:33] no and I said but let me give you the
[45:37] scripture it's a church that doesn't
[45:42] believe in music
[45:46] because they feel that a music affects
[45:49] the people emotionally I can begin god
[45:52] uses music and so I gave scripture and I
[45:57] said I said right here and I think it's
[46:01] in the Book of Kings and I said the the
[46:04] ruler sent them to get this prophet that
[46:08] was separated from the other prophets oh
[46:11] the 400 prophets said this well go and
[46:14] see what this prophet says and so they
[46:18] went to talk to him
[46:20] and before he gave them the word of the
[46:25] Lord
[46:25] he called for a musician and the Bible
[46:31] tells us that when the musician played
[46:33] that the Spirit of the Lord came on the
[46:37] Prophet a man and he had thus saith the
[46:41] Lord
[46:42] now I said that scripture eyes his
[46:44] sister but they wouldn't take it so I've
[46:49] been praying as Lord
[46:50] maybe you'll convict our sister I said
[46:56] at this hour that she'll repent they may
[47:01] not saying that she's bright but that
[47:03] praying the grace of God that she would
[47:05] make it if she repented Norden forgive
[47:08] me a man she knows myself and sister
[47:14] Betty you know we've had fellowship you
[47:17] know the grace of God brother please
[47:25] make your calling and election sure you
[47:28] gotta make sure whose leadership you're
[47:30] under and it can be so simple it can be
[47:35] a very basic thing a very simple thing
[47:38] because she like I said Jesus only he's
[47:40] told to rich and ruler one thing that he
[47:44] wanted him to do well a couple of things
[47:46] he said sell what you got and come
[47:48] follow me Jesus had a reasonably to
[47:52] bring to say that and and God got a
[47:55] reason sometimes to require this of you
[47:57] or to cause the pastors say something
[47:59] or some other brother ministering
[48:01] brothers say something to bring out your
[48:03] attitude that's not my attitude Jesus
[48:10] were looking to say that's not my
[48:11] attitude you've got you got a wrong
[48:16] anointing if you had to write an onion
[48:19] you leaven well you would have my my my
[48:21] anointing you'd have my attitude oh yeah
[48:25] so we're not gonna think like God or
[48:27] like the devil rather we want to think
[48:29] like God yeah act like God we're gonna
[48:33] have the same attitude toward the things
[48:35] of life that God would have a man how
[48:41] many of us would would be sorrow like
[48:45] the rich young ruler if Jesus come have
[48:47] told you sell what you got and come
[48:49] follow me
[48:50] what do you mean well I just want you to
[48:53] just keep what you need and help help
[48:58] your brothers and sisters with the rest
[49:01] grace
[49:05] Strait is the gate
[49:07] narrow is the way a few there be that
[49:10] find it because most everybody they're
[49:14] working for themselves living for
[49:16] themselves prospering for themselves and
[49:19] so on and want this I want that oh it is
[49:21] good and I won't have to worry about
[49:22] this
[49:23] I wanted to worry about that worry well
[49:28] God gives faith to take worry away amen
[49:33] all brothers sister there are so many
[49:36] believers that worry that that's a proof
[49:40] that's an indication that you don't have
[49:41] any faith wow they're afraid of this and
[49:46] afraid of that don't be afraid of
[49:48] anything listen just be content and
[49:51] because whatever you get in life well
[49:54] Lord your will be done I'm on my way
[49:56] home to be with you and Lord I got to
[50:00] all mine but you putted it make sure you
[50:05] got lots in the bank
[50:06] in heaven
[50:09] where the thieves won't break through
[50:10] and steal well in this age and at this
[50:14] time and in this place
[50:16] thieves are breaking through and
[50:17] stealing and brother that's what's going
[50:21] to happen as I said you'll wake up one
[50:24] morning and you want on anything I say
[50:26] the government have taken as collateral
[50:29] for the Antichrist oh yeah
[50:33] that's coming God's going to test your
[50:36] faith I tell you brother more ways than
[50:38] one God's going to test your faith he's
[50:40] allowing all this to happen in the world
[50:42] testing your faith testing your
[50:44] leadership see if you're under the
[50:46] leadership of the Holy Ghost or the
[50:48] devil hey man
[50:51] god help us so he said I know thy works
[50:55] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[50:58] would thou wert cold or out for them
[51:00] because there are lukewarm and neither
[51:02] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[51:04] mouth
[51:07] hmm amazing Ted the Bible says the love
[51:14] of many shall wax cold deceiving and
[51:17] being deceived or these are even more
[51:21] deceiving under greater deception
[51:24] lukewarm they're not here they're not
[51:28] there hey man but I tell you God knows
[51:34] who they are
[51:35] God knows their attitude God knows their
[51:38] spirit yeah praise the Lord because
[51:42] there are lukewarm and neither cold nor
[51:44] hot I will spew or spit you out of my
[51:46] mouth because I'll say I am rich and
[51:49] increased with Goods and have need of
[51:50] nothing and knowest not oh we don't need
[51:55] anything but God said you don't know
[51:59] that you're wretched we see ourselves as
[52:03] the good good condition everything's
[52:05] going fine God says what what leadership
[52:10] were you under you think that you think
[52:13] everything is fine he said your wretched
[52:16] knowing that is you're miserable and he
[52:20] said you're poor
[52:21] and blind and naked now what leadership
[52:25] is that under and the thing of it is
[52:27] they didn't know it they didn't know it
[52:32] they thought everything was fine they
[52:34] you know whatever they thought their
[52:35] relationship with God was fine God has
[52:38] blessed us and God has done this and God
[52:39] has done that sometimes God takes away
[52:43] things from us rather than give it to us
[52:47] you'll take it away but the devil would
[52:50] give to give it to you well he promised
[52:52] to Jesus he's although he said Oh God
[52:54] he said worship me said no I'll give all
[52:57] these kingdoms to you I'll give all this
[52:59] to you what because it Adam and Eve sold
[53:03] it out to the devil and he was gonna
[53:08] give it Jesus Jesus knew he's going to
[53:10] inherit it you know three rebuked the
[53:14] devil
[53:15] listen Saints don't go by what Satan
[53:17] says I'm gonna hire you if you go this
[53:19] way go that way all you'll be you'll be
[53:21] a lot better have about better life in
[53:23] this world well I'm not worried about
[53:26] this world I'm gonna have a wonderful
[53:28] life in the world at all I'm gonna have
[53:32] a body like his glorified body
[53:34] hallelujah I'm gonna sit with him in his
[53:37] strong
[53:38] hey man praise the name of the Lord you
[53:41] just make sure you're led by his spirit
[53:44] a man and he said I counsel thee to buy
[53:49] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[53:53] may us be rich and white raiment that
[53:56] thou mayst be clothed and that the shame
[53:58] of thy nakedness do not appear and
[54:01] knowing thy noise with I say that thou
[54:03] may SC see as God sees a man and be
[54:08] clothed with the righteousness of God
[54:09] amen the glory of God as many as I love
[54:13] I rebuke and chasten he meant amazing be
[54:21] zealous therefore and repent make sure
[54:27] you get back under his leadership if you
[54:30] feel that Satan is influencing you with
[54:33] his leadership
[54:34] this rebuked the devil and get back
[54:36] under God's leadership a man a man time
[54:40] is passing and I got another five
[54:46] scriptures and we don't we'll get into
[54:49] it later but let me finish with this
[54:55] that it was not until about 11 o'clock
[54:58] last night that the Lord laid out on my
[55:02] heart to minister on the subject of
[55:04] leadership to get the Saints to to
[55:09] challenge the Saints to take into
[55:13] consideration what leadership they're
[55:14] under and what Spirit is leading them
[55:19] amen there was a couple of other
[55:23] subjects that I was considering but the
[55:26] Lord finally in his word laid subject of
[55:28] leadership come on my heart and I have
[55:31] scriptures here from the Old Testament
[55:34] and the New Testament concerning
[55:39] leadership
[55:45] the Prophet ministered on this subject
[55:47] in 1965 in California and considering
[55:51] the hour in which we live this is a
[55:53] serious subject considering the last
[55:56] days the believers are warned that false
[56:00] leaders and leadership would prevail to
[56:04] the extent that it would deceive the
[56:07] very elect if possible and such deceit
[56:10] causes man to serve God country to the
[56:13] correct will of God that's right they're
[56:19] serving God contrary to is correct will
[56:22] there's the Provost said you're trying
[56:24] to do God a service without his will why
[56:27] because you're under the wrong
[56:29] leadership make sure that what you feel
[56:33] led to do that it's God leading you and
[56:35] not Satan it was God leading Eve or the
[56:40] devil leading need not say not not not
[56:43] God make sure it's God leading you and
[56:50] the first Adam put himself in sin with
[56:54] the first Eve trusting that in redeeming
[57:00] him God would redeem her amen and the
[57:07] second Adam he put himself down to be
[57:10] tested in all points like as we are yet
[57:12] without sin laying down his life
[57:16] shedding his innocent blood for you and
[57:18] me amen
[57:20] so that amen laying down his life of
[57:23] picking it up again he would redeem you
[57:26] and me Amen because we are his bride by
[57:34] the grace of God
[57:38] so there are false leaders and
[57:39] leadership's that are prevailing to the
[57:43] extent that is deceiving the very elect
[57:46] if possible such deceit causes man to
[57:50] serve God contrary to the correct will
[57:54] of God his man as the Bible says doing
[57:58] what's right in their own eyes
[58:01] religiously but they feel this is what I
[58:04] should do this is how I should do it and
[58:06] so on no you gotta be led by the spirit
[58:09] most definitely we have to make sure
[58:13] that the leader you are following is
[58:15] under the true anointing of the Holy
[58:16] Ghost keeping us in line with the truth
[58:20] the whole truth nothing but the truth to
[58:23] give us the faith that is pleasing to
[58:25] God the faith that we need for the
[58:29] rapture
[58:29] a man and as I said right here we'll get
[58:33] to it later the Lord has led me to six
[58:36] scripture references highlighting God's
[58:39] leadership among his seed and the
[58:42] scripture the Prophet used in his
[58:44] message puts the emphasis on the supreme
[58:49] leader amen he's not you he's not your
[58:56] neighbors not your friend it's Christ
[58:59] amen supreme leadership and before he
[59:08] got into his message he made this
[59:10] statement he said I have a message I
[59:16] feel from God is at the beginning of the
[59:22] leadership message he said it's a little
[59:26] odd to some people and he said I just
[59:32] got to be what I am and he said I don't
[59:37] mean to be different it's just that I'm
[59:41] living at a changing time and we are
[59:45] what would he say today concerning the
[59:49] world that he was experiencing then
[59:51] in 65 what would he say today in 2019
[59:55] brother I pray that that we got a
[1:00:02] greater concern over what's going on
[1:00:04] than what the world worldly people have
[1:00:07] and what science has for these last few
[1:00:12] days I have witnessed things that are
[1:00:20] going on in this world that's bringing
[1:00:24] scientists
[1:00:28] - attention they're recognizing that
[1:00:34] there are things going on just
[1:00:38] destroying the world there are things
[1:00:40] going on that's going to make this world
[1:00:44] impossible to live in that's why a God
[1:00:48] is going to create a new heaven and a
[1:00:50] new earth but there have been references
[1:00:56] even in the news concerning the poison
[1:00:59] in the atmosphere there been references
[1:01:07] concerning the global climate they says
[1:01:14] the climate changes and everything is
[1:01:17] changing the weather is not what it used
[1:01:18] to be around the world was it a global
[1:01:26] warming climate for years they just made
[1:01:32] light of it
[1:01:33] and they felt that it there was no
[1:01:36] significance to it but now they're
[1:01:38] beginning to recognize that there is a
[1:01:41] global warming and it's causing a lot of
[1:01:45] problems a lot of trouble amen
[1:01:49] we're here by the grace of God please
[1:01:54] let's honor and respect His grace they
[1:01:58] saw none respect him and humble
[1:02:00] ourselves that goddess reminded us of
[1:02:05] these things there they're looking at
[1:02:08] what they're seeing what they're
[1:02:12] experiencing out there but you and I are
[1:02:15] believing the word thus saith the Lord
[1:02:19] we knew all this was coming that in
[1:02:24] certain countries in certain areas of
[1:02:26] the world that people were going around
[1:02:29] with masks over their face what
[1:02:35] or trying to avoid the poisoning of the
[1:02:42] vehicles that are driving around
[1:02:44] constantly don't you think that's not
[1:02:48] having an effect on the world we're
[1:02:50] living in what the what those motors are
[1:02:57] putting out where's all the gas going
[1:03:00] it's going out into the atmosphere and
[1:03:04] now that they violated the fact in the
[1:03:07] news concerning certain areas now where
[1:03:10] people go around with mud mask over
[1:03:12] their face because of the what they feel
[1:03:16] is the poison coming out of the out of
[1:03:19] the vehicles and not only that we know
[1:03:24] that the weather is changing and again
[1:03:28] even our weather is changing and but
[1:03:32] there's also been a news item concerning
[1:03:33] germs and it's I told you just recently
[1:03:38] that it's not the new new diseases but
[1:03:41] the old diseases and there there are
[1:03:44] many many many hard to believe I you
[1:03:47] know when it comes to naturally speaking
[1:03:49] that there's so many that are that are
[1:03:51] under the influence of of the old
[1:03:54] diseases tuberculosis one and other old
[1:04:00] diseases that thousands are that are
[1:04:03] influenced and under the under the under
[1:04:05] the influence and many have died
[1:04:14] it's time to go home not in this
[1:04:19] community but to heaven it's time to go
[1:04:24] to glory amen so brother sister is
[1:04:30] serious but I trust that you're gonna
[1:04:34] live by faith you're trusting Jesus amen
[1:04:41] so the germ warfare of all of the old
[1:04:44] diseases are striking humans and
[1:04:48] thousands have died in certain parts of
[1:04:52] the world but to our right again though
[1:04:57] I did tell you some time long time ago
[1:04:59] that they're not going they're not going
[1:05:03] to be more open with that information
[1:05:06] because they don't want to stir the
[1:05:08] people up there's like certain
[1:05:12] scientists they give the government's
[1:05:14] reports they contact the government and
[1:05:17] says that well what do you want us to
[1:05:18] say and how do you want us to say it
[1:05:21] well I'll just say what is the truth no
[1:05:25] the government wants it said in such a
[1:05:27] way so as not to stir the people so you
[1:05:31] keep pleading the token life of the
[1:05:33] blood of Jesus for your life that were
[1:05:37] under the token Lord so the devil is not
[1:05:40] going to attack us with these germ
[1:05:42] warfare amen so make sure you're under
[1:05:48] his leadership it's serious
[1:05:54] you mean to tell me that we're going to
[1:05:57] look out here and we're going to see
[1:05:59] people in affected with old-fashioned
[1:06:03] germs diseases that they had years ago
[1:06:05] yes because the Prophet prophesied a
[1:06:10] germ warfare and and I said O Lord I
[1:06:13] said all of these things I'm hearing
[1:06:15] this last few days I said is the
[1:06:18] prophesies of what a Brenham coming to
[1:06:20] pass it's later than you think
[1:06:25] and they're talking about the negative
[1:06:28] effects of scientific technology in the
[1:06:33] atmosphere around the world they talked
[1:06:39] about gases other things coming out of
[1:06:42] planes and again even the vehicles down
[1:06:46] here and and and fire everything if
[1:06:51] there's a fire where it's the smoke go
[1:06:55] it's getting worse and worse don't think
[1:06:58] well that's just a fire down there in
[1:07:00] the south somewhere that's just a fire
[1:07:02] in British Columbia that's just a fire
[1:07:04] somewhere else noise getting worse
[1:07:10] it says mysterious clouds produced when
[1:07:17] aircraft inadvertently causes rain or
[1:07:19] snow that's been in just recently in the
[1:07:23] news mysterious clouds produced when
[1:07:28] aircraft inadvertently he said causes
[1:07:32] rain or snow I remember one time at home
[1:07:38] look at the window and it was it's not
[1:07:42] supposed to be snowing but it wasn't I
[1:07:44] heard a plane go over and it started to
[1:07:46] snow and the plane went on then it
[1:07:51] stopped it's snowing and then after
[1:07:54] another while I just hear playing goal
[1:07:56] snow
[1:07:57] I said Lord I said what's going on
[1:08:02] it's the end don't think don't think the
[1:08:07] world's getting better the world's worse
[1:08:11] it'll pass away and it says pollution
[1:08:18] from Asia is circling the globe global
[1:08:24] warming affecting certain areas of the
[1:08:27] earth
[1:08:28] they said it's a reality whereas for a
[1:08:34] number of years they denied it made
[1:08:36] light of it but now they're
[1:08:37] acknowledging it's a reality
[1:08:40] they said it's affecting the atmosphere
[1:08:43] around the earth and he says affect him
[1:08:46] evenly I beyond the earth even the moon
[1:08:54] you know they're bringing they're
[1:08:57] bringing out these warnings global
[1:08:59] warming affecting certain areas of the
[1:09:01] earth and there's also another issue
[1:09:05] concerning the wireless technology in
[1:09:09] the atmosphere again that's like the
[1:09:12] cellphones and everything else amen
[1:09:16] well it's like the man said that he
[1:09:19] turned his TV on one time and there was
[1:09:25] a program come on he said where in the
[1:09:27] world that come from that program it had
[1:09:31] not been on television for years so he
[1:09:35] called somebody about it always said
[1:09:36] that's he said it's still out there and
[1:09:38] he said it's going through the going
