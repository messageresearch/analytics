[47:11] coffee this morning
[47:14] amen
[47:30] I'll wait
[47:43] amen this is one of the good times to
[47:46] one of the better times to be a pastors
[47:47] the baby dedications and usually the
[47:50] marriages amen but were gathered here
[47:52] this morning to to dedicate Wesley Mark
[47:55] coffee to the Lord and
[47:57] of course as you have to you look up the
[47:59] names and Wesley we know is one of the
[48:01] greatest preachers ever lived one of the
[48:03] most dedicated ministers and I'm not
[48:06] going to be prophetic this morning but
[48:07] you never know what could happen with
[48:09] these things but certainly the word
[48:11] Wesley or the name Wesley means western
[48:13] Pastor Western Lee and brother Paul told
[48:16] me it also means token but it must have
[48:18] been buried in an ancient manuscript
[48:19] because I couldn't find it so I've got
[48:22] to only preach what I know myself and
[48:23] that said it's Western pasture Western
[48:25] Lee but you know when I read that I
[48:27] thought about Psalms 23.
[48:29] says the Lord is my shepherd
[48:33] shall not want
[48:36] he lead me besides the wires he restores
[48:38] my soul but he he what he puts them in
[48:40] Green Pastures a place of rest a place
[48:43] to feed a place where the shepherd's
[48:45] watching over
[48:46] but then we come to a second name which
[48:48] is Mark
[48:49] and Mark is perhaps the most
[48:52] bipolar of Christian names that you can
[48:54] get I say that in a wonderful way
[48:56] because it means polite
[48:58] it means Shining
[49:00] it means kind
[49:02] and then it means warlike
[49:04] and it means hammer
[49:07] and you know what when I look at that I
[49:09] think that's the way the Christian is
[49:11] you start out and you're kind
[49:14] and you're a shining light
[49:16] and you're polite
[49:19] but when it comes time for battle
[49:22] you bring the hammer
[49:24] and you give it everything you've got
[49:27] and you don't back down
[49:29] you know even Michael arguing over the
[49:32] body of Moses
[49:34] does not bring a railing accusation the
[49:36] scripture says against Satan he was
[49:37] polite to Satan
[49:39] but when it comes time to time to fight
[49:40] we don't back down
[49:42] amen our personality is not to back down
[49:45] we'll be kind as long as we we can be
[49:46] kind
[49:48] but when he's on our property we've got
[49:50] to fight for it amen so I believe that's
[49:52] what we've got here is we've got a child
[49:53] of God a Son of God that's gathered and
[49:55] he's been set in Green Pastures
[49:58] and Manny's God's got a place for him
[50:00] God's got a a position for him
[50:03] and he's going to be a gentleman
[50:05] but he's going to be a soldier for the
[50:06] Lord as well amen
[50:08] Jeremiah 29 11 says for I know the
[50:10] thoughts that I think toward you saith
[50:13] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[50:16] evil to give you an expected End Amen
[50:25] all right let's pray together if we
[50:27] would Heavenly Father
[50:30] Lord what a precious thing it is to
[50:32] bring these children before you Lord God
[50:34] Lord knowing our insufficiency in
[50:36] ourselves as parents Lord even as
[50:38] Believers Lord to bring them Lord into
[50:41] your presence Lord but we know that
[50:42] you've ordained Lord each one Lord you
[50:45] put a seed of life to see Gene of God
[50:47] inside of them Lord God lord and in
[50:50] recognition of that this morning we're
[50:52] committing Lord Wesley Mark coffee into
[50:54] your hands Lord we're committing his
[50:56] parents for committing his grandparents
[50:58] into your hands Lord that they would
[51:00] raise him in the admonition admonition
[51:02] and nurture of the Lord heavenly father
[51:04] that they would raise him in a home
[51:06] where the holy spirit is the atmosphere
[51:08] Lord that he would know your praise and
[51:10] worship
[51:11] Lord that he would know what it is to be
[51:13] around a real and living God lord and as
[51:16] he comes to his time of age and maturity
[51:18] Lord that he would just reach out to you
[51:21] Lord as you call and Lord that he will
[51:23] receive you Lord that your holy spirit
[51:25] will just overshadow him Lord that it
[51:27] would fill him Lord that it will bless
[51:29] him Lord abundantly we pray Lord be with
[51:32] brother Paul and Sister Kim Lord young
[51:34] Michael Lord may you just surround them
[51:36] Lord with a hedge of protection Lord
[51:38] bless and provide them day by day Lord
[51:40] as they dedicate their lives and their
[51:42] family to you therefore we ask these
[51:44] things in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[51:48] amen

[52:26] Psalms 132
[52:28] men want to thank brother Paul for
[52:30] taking the service on Sunday with his
[52:32] adult Sunday school and then trusting
[52:34] you enjoyed it I only got to watch a bit
[52:35] of it but I enjoyed what I what I heard
[52:38] and then certainly having brother Barry
[52:39] here to speak to us on Wednesday I was
[52:41] able to hear all of that and and trust
[52:43] it was a blessing to you amen
[52:46] we certainly want to greet our visitors
[52:48] brother and sister Baggett here we've
[52:50] got brother Adam sister Jamie and family
[52:52] amen it's good to have each one here
[52:54] when I was away I I met so many people
[52:56] and so many brothers other ministers but
[52:59] brother Ed hammermeister brother Dwayne
[53:01] Fair brother Ron Spencer and many others
[53:03] asked me to pass on their greetings and
[53:05] their blessings to the church and say
[53:07] that they miss us and certainly are
[53:08] looking forward to the next time that
[53:10] they'll be here amen
[53:12] amen Psalms 132
[53:15] and verse 13 says for the Lord had
[53:17] chosen Zion he had desired it for his
[53:20] habitation this is my rest forever here
[53:24] will I dwell for I have desired it let's
[53:27] bow our heads Heavenly Father
[53:29] Lord what a precious scripture we're
[53:30] reading this morning lord lord of your
[53:33] bride and Lord we see here Lord that we
[53:35] are here because you desired it Lord
[53:37] because you have chosen us Lord that you
[53:40] have declared us before the foundation
[53:41] of the world and Lord that's our rest
[53:43] this morning Lord is that you have
[53:45] chosen us Lord that this is a work of
[53:47] yours not a work of ours that this is
[53:49] not just our will Lord but it's your
[53:51] will and it's been determined Lord
[53:52] before the foundation of the very World
[53:54] Lord we're praying that you would just
[53:56] bless us now with the the preaching Lord
[53:58] and the hearing of the word Lord speaker
[54:00] and hearer like Lord you may you just
[54:02] Quicken us Lord may you just build up
[54:04] our faith this morning Lord may we rise
[54:06] to a higher Heights Lord may we come up
[54:08] a little higher we pray in Jesus
[54:10] Christ's name we're asking it amen and
[54:13] amen you can have your seats this
[54:14] morning God bless you it's certainly
[54:15] good to be back I had quite a whirlwind
[54:17] trip and so many different people I saw
[54:20] there and met many new ministers and and
[54:23] talk to different ones and so we've got
[54:24] quite a lineup coming up over the next
[54:26] months and years certainly Lord willing
[54:28] but just to get right into the preaching
[54:30] the the the word this morning I want to
[54:32] take a a second uh portion on on this
[54:35] thought of the certainty of a seed in
[54:37] this series we're doing on manifesting
[54:39] time and we spoke last time just as a
[54:41] recap for those that weren't here we
[54:43] spoke on the certainty of a seed is that
[54:45] it cannot change amen what's inside it
[54:47] does not change because it's environment
[54:49] changes because its location changes
[54:51] because the things around it change it
[54:52] never changes what's inside of a seed
[54:55] what it is inside is what it will always
[54:56] be and what it is it always will be amen
[54:59] it has no say in the matter and we
[55:01] talked about how God spoke in Genesis
[55:03] and he spoke to the seeds that were
[55:05] planted and he said bring forth of your
[55:07] own kind and the seeds did exactly that
[55:09] the principle is that God speaks and
[55:11] things happen amen and when it comes to
[55:13] seeds they produce exactly what he's put
[55:15] in them from the beginning but I spoke
[55:17] last time and I wanted to hammer it this
[55:19] morning this thought that those seeds
[55:21] could only produce life and produce what
[55:24] was inside of them as the conditions
[55:26] were right for life amen they've been
[55:28] sitting there for for for who knows how
[55:30] long you know whether you believe in a
[55:31] short Earth or a long Earth literal days
[55:34] or or whatever it might be that when the
[55:36] word came forth it did not produce the
[55:39] life
[55:41] when the word came forth it did not
[55:42] produce the life what happened when the
[55:44] word came forth was that it produced the
[55:46] conditions and then the conditions
[55:48] produce the life the word of God in and
[55:51] of itself did not bring them to life but
[55:52] the Word of Life set the conditions
[55:54] correctly for those seeds to come to
[55:56] life in a way that they weren't able to
[55:58] do before that amen God has to set the
[56:01] conditions we can sit here under the
[56:03] preaching of the word we can sit here
[56:04] under the hearing of the word we can sit
[56:06] in a message church we can have all
[56:07] these things but until God sets the
[56:09] conditions right we cannot produce what
[56:12] this word says we're supposed to produce
[56:13] and it's a time of God's choosing not a
[56:16] time of our choosing amen
[56:18] amen it took the conditions to be right
[56:21] for these things to come out and we can
[56:23] sit here and in Jesus day there were
[56:24] many people going on the Sabbath to hear
[56:26] the word
[56:28] and they heard it for hundreds and
[56:29] hundreds of years but until that Messiah
[56:31] showed up there were certain things that
[56:33] could not happen why because the
[56:35] conditions weren't right the timing
[56:36] wasn't right and it was up to God to
[56:38] choose those things but when God speaks
[56:40] that word and he says let the seeds
[56:42] bring forth of their own kind then it's
[56:44] up to him to make the conditions right
[56:46] it's up to him to bring out the life
[56:48] that's inside of them amen seeds need a
[56:50] prompt
[56:51] seeds sit in the ground and if you put a
[56:53] seed in and you plant it late in the in
[56:55] the fall it won't come to life because
[56:56] it's not meant to do it the temperatures
[56:58] are dropping and it it senses the cycle
[57:00] that's there but it'll lay dormant all
[57:02] through the winter and it'll lie in
[57:04] frozen ground where there's no life that
[57:06] can come out of it at that season but as
[57:08] it comes into spring and the days get
[57:10] longer and the Sun starts to shine and
[57:12] the Earth starts to warm up then
[57:14] something prompts the seed and it's got
[57:15] a trigger inside of it that when certain
[57:18] conditions are met it comes to life and
[57:20] it starts to grow and it starts to rot
[57:22] the outside and it starts to grow from
[57:23] the inside out and when the conditions
[57:26] match the DNA that's programmed into
[57:27] that seed it says it's time to come to
[57:29] life and then it comes to life and
[57:31] there's nothing can stop it from doing
[57:32] that amen you can put a seed in a cold
[57:35] place you can put a seed in a dry place
[57:37] and it will never come to life but that
[57:40] doesn't mean there's no life in it it
[57:42] just means that it can't come to life in
[57:44] those conditions you know it needs
[57:46] certain things to come to life it needs
[57:48] dirt it needs moisture it needs sunlight
[57:50] it actually needs a cycle in temperature
[57:52] it can't be hot all the time it needs to
[57:54] be cool at times and hotter times it
[57:56] needs ups and downs if we want to put it
[57:57] that way it needs the conditions to just
[57:59] be right and you know I was studying a
[58:02] long time ago on a certain thing and I
[58:03] don't think I ever brought it to the
[58:05] church but that back in in Jesus day
[58:07] Judean dates from Israel were prized
[58:10] around the world for their taste you
[58:12] know the scripture says it's a land
[58:13] flowing with milk and honey well the
[58:15] dates from Judean Palms tasted they had
[58:18] an aftertaste of honey and there was
[58:20] nothing like them in the rest of the
[58:21] world and they would ship them all over
[58:23] the world and they were prized for that
[58:25] special taste that they had but sometime
[58:28] somehow those dates those palm trees
[58:31] that produce those dates went completely
[58:33] extinct right
[58:34] and today if you were to go around the
[58:36] world none of those trees exist
[58:39] but then the archaeologists were up in
[58:41] the in the in the the desert Fortress of
[58:43] Masada
[58:44] and we know what that looks like and and
[58:47] I got a picture here we look at Masada
[58:49] and they found the seeds from a Judean
[58:52] date palm
[58:54] so for 2 000 years those seeds have been
[58:57] sitting in Masada now that's Masada up
[58:59] there on the left that is not a place
[59:01] for life
[59:03] that is not a place for gold palm trees
[59:05] don't grow in Masada but Masada is a
[59:08] great place to preserve
[59:10] sometimes we look at situations we look
[59:12] at people and we say they're never going
[59:14] to grow there
[59:16] sometimes God's preserving them for a
[59:18] place where they'll grow
[59:19] sometimes what's happening is God's
[59:21] keeping them in a place where they won't
[59:23] be tainted where they won't come to life
[59:25] and die because there's nothing there to
[59:27] grow with and he's preserving them for a
[59:29] place where they can once plant it grow
[59:31] completely because God doesn't do an
[59:33] incomplete work God doesn't start us to
[59:35] fail us when he starts us he's going to
[59:37] see us all the way through the end and
[59:39] sometimes he's got to put us in a place
[59:41] where we can't grow and then all of a
[59:43] sudden God will move them to a different
[59:44] Ministry move them to a different Church
[59:46] move them out of the world where they
[59:48] were kept safe as an atheist for so long
[59:51] untainted by false religion and he'll
[59:54] bring them into a place where the truth
[59:55] is preached and that person will come to
[59:57] life immediately because they're under
[59:58] the right conditions but God preserved
[1:00:00] them in a place of unbelief where
[1:00:03] nothing could touch them to bring them
[1:00:05] to a place where his perfect word could
[1:00:07] be preached and all of a sudden they
[1:00:08] come to life but they found these date
[1:00:10] palms in Masada and they found I think
[1:00:12] 32 or 33 of them and so they got special
[1:00:15] permission to try and grow one
[1:00:18] and they took it and they took it and
[1:00:20] they put it in a lab in perfect growing
[1:00:22] conditions and they planted this tree
[1:00:24] and it came to life and this is the tree
[1:00:27] now and they call it Methuselah
[1:00:31] because it's been dormant for so long
[1:00:33] but now it lives and this tree now is
[1:00:35] over six meters tall
[1:00:38] and it's a male
[1:00:40] and when they realized that they could
[1:00:41] do that then they planted and they tried
[1:00:43] a bunch of other seeds and they got six
[1:00:46] more to grow so now they have seven
[1:00:47] trees and they name them all after
[1:00:49] characters in The Bible
[1:00:51] and so what they have done now the last
[1:00:53] I looked they had 111 dates that they
[1:00:55] got from a female tree that Methuselah
[1:00:58] had pollinated so now today you can have
[1:01:01] dates that they haven't had for two
[1:01:02] thousand years because they were
[1:01:04] perfectly preserved in a dry cool place
[1:01:06] for two millennia
[1:01:09] that's the certainty of a seed
[1:01:12] it'll lay there and it'll lay there and
[1:01:14] it'll lay there and then you put it in
[1:01:16] the right conditions and all of a sudden
[1:01:18] it blossoms into life amen
[1:01:20] you know we'd look at like I said these
[1:01:22] people and and we look at where they're
[1:01:24] at sometimes and we say they've made the
[1:01:26] wrong decisions they're in the wrong
[1:01:27] place they're never going to grow and
[1:01:29] you know what usually they don't grow
[1:01:31] usually our perception on these things
[1:01:33] is right but you come to that place and
[1:01:35] God's moving and I think sometimes we
[1:01:37] forget is in all the noise God is still
[1:01:39] moving amen he's the one that secures us
[1:01:42] he's the one that calls us he's the ones
[1:01:43] that pulls us he's the ones that ordains
[1:01:45] us and so we're looking at all the noise
[1:01:47] and not realizing that in it all God is
[1:01:50] moving brother Brown would say a birth
[1:01:52] is messy he says it's always a mess and
[1:01:54] sometimes you got to get in messy
[1:01:56] conditions to have a messy birth and
[1:01:58] it's got to be very obvious and
[1:02:00] sometimes that's the security we need is
[1:02:01] an obvious birth rather than a cold
[1:02:03] formal birth just because we've been
[1:02:05] going to church all of our life or we've
[1:02:06] been sitting under the message all of
[1:02:08] our life they're supposed to be a mess
[1:02:09] that goes around these things amen but
[1:02:11] God is working even when we don't see it
[1:02:14] God is working even when we don't see it
[1:02:16] when God says something has to happen
[1:02:17] and it's a supernatural happening
[1:02:19] because everything God says is
[1:02:21] Supernatural then it's up to him to
[1:02:23] consent the conditions for his word to
[1:02:25] come to pass it's him that's going to do
[1:02:27] it it's not us why because he's
[1:02:29] responsible for his own word and I read
[1:02:31] this quote in the last service and I
[1:02:32] want to use this as an anchor point this
[1:02:34] morning brother Brian said now first
[1:02:36] place the word of God is the only plan
[1:02:39] and the only truth about God the word is
[1:02:42] God you understand I'm quoting scripture
[1:02:44] he says in the beginning was the word
[1:02:46] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:02:47] was God so the word is God and he says
[1:02:50] now then if God has said something it's
[1:02:53] up to God to take care of his own word
[1:02:57] amen so if you are a part of him I'm
[1:03:00] saying because you are a part of him
[1:03:01] it's up to him to take care of you it's
[1:03:03] up to him to produce the word that's
[1:03:05] inside of each one of us amen it's not
[1:03:07] up to you and I to bring this word to
[1:03:09] pass yes we have a part to play yes we
[1:03:12] have a mind yes we can accept yes we can
[1:03:14] make decisions yes we can choose how we
[1:03:16] spend our time and energy But ultimately
[1:03:18] it's up to him to produce the word
[1:03:20] because he's the one that thought it
[1:03:22] he's the one that spoke it he's the one
[1:03:24] that declared it and it's up to him to
[1:03:26] produce it in these things amen we
[1:03:28] aren't responsible to make it happen
[1:03:29] it's God that quickens it's God that
[1:03:31] gives life it's God that puts us in the
[1:03:33] right conditions and it's God that
[1:03:35] produces what's inside of us
[1:03:37] it's his responsibility overall brother
[1:03:39] Brown would say this he says now if we
[1:03:41] would think this morning the very Earth
[1:03:43] We're living on this morning is the word
[1:03:45] of God that tree is the word of God and
[1:03:49] you your body is the word of God God
[1:03:51] spoke it into existence like that made
[1:03:54] it from nothing which had nothing he
[1:03:57] says did you ever notice the human life
[1:03:58] where it come from one little cell so
[1:04:01] small that a human eye couldn't see it
[1:04:03] only through a great powerful glass and
[1:04:06] out of there come a 200 pound man where
[1:04:09] did it come from he says God just spoke
[1:04:12] it and it just started by Nature growing
[1:04:16] and there it produced just exactly
[1:04:18] notice why did it grow by Nature because
[1:04:21] there was something in it that was
[1:04:23] programmed for it to grow amen it's
[1:04:25] nature that God had put in it was to
[1:04:28] grow and as soon as God sets the right
[1:04:30] conditions by Nature it will grow
[1:04:33] that's why brother Branham said if
[1:04:35] you're standing still you're backsliding
[1:04:37] because your nature is to grow your
[1:04:40] nature is to keep pushing forward your
[1:04:42] nature is to keep coming higher it's to
[1:04:44] keep digging deeper so your nature is to
[1:04:46] keep pressing and when you suppress it
[1:04:48] it's because you're backslidden we don't
[1:04:50] stand still amen everything we have need
[1:04:53] of inside of us to be a son or daughter
[1:04:55] of God is already in US
[1:04:57] and all it takes is a holy spirit to
[1:04:59] Quicken it by the word and all of a
[1:05:01] sudden it starts to grow he says by
[1:05:04] Nature it started growing and there
[1:05:06] produced just exactly he says he spoke
[1:05:09] every tree everything into existence and
[1:05:11] it's such a wonderful wonderful thing
[1:05:13] this morning to view the word of God
[1:05:15] like I said we've got a part to play
[1:05:17] unlike natural seeds we've got
[1:05:19] intelligence we've got a mind we have
[1:05:21] choices that we make day in and day out
[1:05:23] but God will bend it to make it work to
[1:05:26] his plan we talked about Jonah before
[1:05:28] remember and how God used his
[1:05:30] personality that unwillingness to go
[1:05:32] somewhere to turn it into his perfect
[1:05:34] will and God will use your personality
[1:05:36] God will use who you are as we heard
[1:05:39] over this Pulpit God will use you
[1:05:41] exactly as you are to produce his word
[1:05:43] and he's going to break us he's going to
[1:05:46] bend us he's going to mold us I was I
[1:05:49] was listening to to brother Brown when
[1:05:50] he was talking about he said that that
[1:05:53] the bride is not brass that breaks under
[1:05:55] a beating but it is gold that is
[1:05:57] malleable and can be formed and shaped
[1:06:00] and it doesn't break under the shaping
[1:06:02] hand of God and the same thing amen but
[1:06:04] it's his responsibility
[1:06:06] but I want to talk about a second
[1:06:08] portion of the certainty of a scene
[1:06:09] because we've talked about how what's
[1:06:11] inside it cannot change and that's the
[1:06:13] first certainty but there's a second
[1:06:15] certainty because what I didn't tell you
[1:06:17] about those seeds that they found in
[1:06:19] Masada was only seven came to life out
[1:06:22] of 32.
[1:06:23] some of them were not preserved for the
[1:06:26] 2000 years some of them have gone too
[1:06:28] far they've been sitting too long
[1:06:30] they've been dormant too long and the
[1:06:32] life would not come out of them and so
[1:06:34] only six out of the 32 came out and so
[1:06:36] we see within the certainty of a seat we
[1:06:39] see an uncertainty and that is will it
[1:06:41] come to life at all
[1:06:43] will it come to life at all you know we
[1:06:45] look around this this this uh this
[1:06:48] congregation we look around the the
[1:06:50] people that are here and we say
[1:06:52] the numbers are stacked against us
[1:06:55] when we compare the 50 or 60 people that
[1:06:58] are here this morning you know with the
[1:07:00] 250 000 that are in the St John's area
[1:07:03] we would say this the the the numbers
[1:07:05] the odds are stacked against us
[1:07:08] that not many are going to make it
[1:07:11] because the evidence sits before us not
[1:07:14] many are sitting under the hearing of
[1:07:16] the word this morning
[1:07:18] and so we have a great uncertainty as to
[1:07:20] whether we are truly a son and daughter
[1:07:23] of God
[1:07:26] why because the numbers are stacked
[1:07:28] against us
[1:07:30] only six out of 32 made it out of those
[1:07:32] date palm seeds in Masada and we look at
[1:07:34] here
[1:07:35] and we look at ourselves and we say am I
[1:07:38] really
[1:07:39] is this really true brother Brandon
[1:07:40] would preach One in a Million
[1:07:42] I think we're greater than 1 million I
[1:07:45] think we're about one in 10 million
[1:07:46] these days because it says he has to cut
[1:07:48] the day short because otherwise no flesh
[1:07:50] should be saved
[1:07:51] we're on a we're on a Razor's Edge
[1:07:54] but I'm not here to talk to you this
[1:07:56] morning about uncertainty I'm here to
[1:07:57] talk to you about certainty
[1:07:59] but listen to this
[1:08:01] because I want you to realize what it is
[1:08:03] that you are and I want to realize you
[1:08:05] to realize how special you are this
[1:08:07] morning first first Corinthians 1 says
[1:08:10] is for you see your calling Brethren how
[1:08:12] that not many wise men after the flesh
[1:08:16] not many mighty not many noble are
[1:08:20] called
[1:08:21] listen if you're smart if you're
[1:08:22] educated if you have all the things that
[1:08:24] this world wants if you're sitting in
[1:08:26] this church this morning you are blessed
[1:08:28] above all because not many of those
[1:08:29] people are called most of the ones he
[1:08:32] calls the scripture says the Common
[1:08:33] People heard him gladly
[1:08:35] and more common considering ourselves
[1:08:37] against most of the world brother Brown
[1:08:39] would say this it says and he said as it
[1:08:40] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[1:08:42] in the coming of the son of man see
[1:08:44] where eight Souls were saved he says I
[1:08:47] don't say there's going to be eight
[1:08:48] saved now now don't get that all wrong I
[1:08:50] never said that I don't know how many
[1:08:52] are going to be saved in that that last
[1:08:54] moment to Rapture that little group
[1:08:55] it'll be a small group I'll tell you
[1:08:58] that
[1:08:59] for straight As the gate and narrow is
[1:09:02] the way but few there be that'll find it
[1:09:04] he'd go on to say this he said but all
[1:09:06] down through the age there had been a
[1:09:09] little remnant
[1:09:10] a little Remnant was holding on to the
[1:09:13] truth of God just a small group The
[1:09:15] Church of God has always been in the
[1:09:17] minority
[1:09:18] when we see big numbers now I'm not
[1:09:21] talking against big churches but when
[1:09:23] you look at a church that's got 15 000
[1:09:25] people these mega churches then
[1:09:27] something's wrong because the word will
[1:09:29] not allow that many people it's a
[1:09:31] divider it's a separator it's a breaking
[1:09:33] down of these things so when you see the
[1:09:34] masses going to it that's your first
[1:09:36] sign that it ain't the true word of God
[1:09:38] because it's always been rejected amen
[1:09:40] but we're here to talk about certainty
[1:09:42] I'm not here to put doubt in your mind
[1:09:44] but I'm here to show you because you are
[1:09:46] here it points to the great certainty of
[1:09:48] God and the seed of life and the seed of
[1:09:50] God that's inside of you amen
[1:09:52] we spoke last service how the word is
[1:09:54] the thoughts of God expressed and God
[1:09:57] thought it and God spoke it and then he
[1:09:58] wrote it in a book and now perhaps God
[1:10:01] has many thoughts
[1:10:03] we don't know all the thoughts of God
[1:10:05] he didn't choose to give us all the
[1:10:07] thoughts of God but he chose us to give
[1:10:09] chose to give us the thoughts that
[1:10:11] pertained unto us
[1:10:12] in this little book that we have here
[1:10:14] these 66 books we have everything we
[1:10:17] need to get us out of here to get us
[1:10:20] through life to get us into a
[1:10:21] resurrection to get us into a Rapture to
[1:10:24] give us the Holy Ghost to get our family
[1:10:25] saved to live an overcoming life to live
[1:10:28] a Victorious Life To Break Down The
[1:10:30] Walls of Satan's kingdom in our lives
[1:10:31] and others everything we have need of is
[1:10:33] here he's given us the recipe he's
[1:10:35] giving us his portion of his thoughts to
[1:10:38] get us through amen scripture says that
[1:10:40] this is so clear
[1:10:42] that even though a man is a fool he
[1:10:44] won't air in it he won't error in it he
[1:10:46] won't fall away from it it doesn't take
[1:10:48] intelligence
[1:10:49] it just takes a revelation from God and
[1:10:52] you can be a fool in the eyes of the
[1:10:53] world and you can be a true son or
[1:10:54] daughter of God Amen
[1:10:56] but what I love about God is that he is
[1:10:58] consistent
[1:10:59] he is repetitive because guess what we
[1:11:02] aren't the smartest knives we're not the
[1:11:04] the smartest cookies we're not the
[1:11:06] sharpest knives in the drawer and
[1:11:07] sometimes we need to see things over and
[1:11:10] over and over again to see it and that's
[1:11:12] exactly the way God does it in his word
[1:11:13] is he does the same thing over and over
[1:11:16] and over and over so that you'll realize
[1:11:19] it's him
[1:11:20] so that you'll realize if you do what he
[1:11:22] says he'll do what he said
[1:11:25] and over and over again and you can
[1:11:26] start to see the way God moves and then
[1:11:28] you can start to enter in to the work of
[1:11:30] God rather than sitting back and letting
[1:11:32] God do all the work you can start to see
[1:11:34] what's happening and you can be a part
[1:11:35] of these things
[1:11:37] we can have faith we can have confidence
[1:11:38] that God is moving in our lives brother
[1:11:41] Brown would say this he said The
[1:11:42] Impossibles Are Made Real when God is
[1:11:45] taken at his word The Impossibles Are
[1:11:47] Made Real when God has taken at his word
[1:11:49] when any person
[1:11:52] any person
[1:11:54] he didn't put an age requirement he
[1:11:56] didn't put a gender requirement he
[1:11:58] didn't put a marriage requirement on it
[1:12:00] he said when any person will take that
[1:12:02] same word it'll bring the same results
[1:12:04] every time he says every time you ask
[1:12:08] about it
[1:12:09] when God had his thoughts and he spoke
[1:12:11] to him we showed how in the last service
[1:12:14] we were in those thoughts and therefore
[1:12:15] we were part of what was spoken and what
[1:12:17] was written we are not just it's not
[1:12:19] just an idea of God but we are literally
[1:12:21] made a part of God when he expresses
[1:12:24] himself this way amen I think we've said
[1:12:26] this before it's not just this Bible is
[1:12:28] written for us this Bible is written
[1:12:30] about us
[1:12:32] this is our book
[1:12:34] this is our book it's meant specifically
[1:12:36] for us when I was in Edmonton brother
[1:12:38] Nathan Erickson I only was able to make
[1:12:39] one of the special meetings there but he
[1:12:41] was preaching and he was speaking about
[1:12:43] Ruth and Boaz and there come a time
[1:12:45] after Ruth had gone to the threshing
[1:12:47] floor and she'd laid at the feet of Boaz
[1:12:49] and then he covered her over and he
[1:12:51] declared that yes he would redeem her
[1:12:53] and she goes home and what happened
[1:12:55] Naomi said take your rest
[1:12:58] because he will not rest until he's done
[1:13:01] what he said and then he said one of the
[1:13:03] most profound statements I've ever heard
[1:13:05] he said it was boaz's power but it was
[1:13:08] Ruth's book
[1:13:10] it was boaz's power but it was Ruth's
[1:13:12] book it was him that was doing it but it
[1:13:15] was her story
[1:13:16] it's God's power but it's our story amen
[1:13:19] he's written this book about us and
[1:13:21] we're supposed to be stepping into the
[1:13:23] pages amen the title deeb was never
[1:13:25] supposed to be out of our hands
[1:13:28] it was ours it was given to Adam and we
[1:13:31] lost it by sin and it went back to the
[1:13:33] hands of God but it did not belong to
[1:13:36] God he's given it back to us Revelations
[1:13:39] 10 8 he gives us back the book and says
[1:13:41] now you go now you eat it realize you're
[1:13:45] in it realize it's inside of you live it
[1:13:48] produce it
[1:13:50] it'll taste great it's going to be hard
[1:13:52] in your belly but you've got to produce
[1:13:54] it and you've got to prophesy again
[1:13:56] you've got to produce the word again
[1:13:58] it's not just to you it is yours you're
[1:14:02] in it it's a part of you and you're a
[1:14:04] part of it amen everything we have need
[1:14:06] is supplied there
[1:14:08] God and His Sovereign will and purpose
[1:14:10] declared that he was going to have a
[1:14:12] family that there would be a royal seed
[1:14:14] line that was coming of priests and
[1:14:16] kings that would Rule and reign with him
[1:14:18] and so he's got to produce these things
[1:14:20] and We Know It was supposed to be
[1:14:22] perfect
[1:14:23] Adam and Eve were not intended to fall
[1:14:25] in God's perfect will but yet God's seen
[1:14:28] it ordained that his Redemption plan
[1:14:30] would come and it would still produce us
[1:14:32] so God's word could not be stopped after
[1:14:35] Satan came in and messed up humanity and
[1:14:37] so we're stuck now between two
[1:14:39] Dimensions we've got a spiritual calling
[1:14:41] in the high places in Christ Jesus and
[1:14:43] yet we're stuck in this thinking flesh
[1:14:45] down here and there's a battle between
[1:14:46] those two things and it's up to God to
[1:14:48] resolve the differences and take us out
[1:14:50] of here amen
[1:14:52] brother Brown puts it this way he says
[1:14:54] and so God knew that we would be here
[1:14:56] but then he put us in flesh so we could
[1:14:58] be contacted in order that he could
[1:15:01] contact he became one of us when he
[1:15:02] became Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:15:04] himself the fullness of the
[1:15:06] manifestation of God therefore that was
[1:15:08] God's purpose to display his attributes
[1:15:11] in Fellowship
[1:15:14] God wanted a family God wanted to be
[1:15:17] family and fellowship is the first thing
[1:15:20] that He restored when he died on the
[1:15:21] cross was he tore that Veil so that
[1:15:24] anybody would come into could come into
[1:15:26] the presence of God brother Ram said it
[1:15:28] used to be death to come into His
[1:15:30] presence now it's death to refuse to
[1:15:32] come into His presence he is restoring
[1:15:34] us back to fellowship he said when I was
[1:15:36] in my father I knew nothing about it
[1:15:39] brother Brown says we bypassed our
[1:15:41] theophany so we have no memory of what
[1:15:43] we were
[1:15:44] but when I become his son and was born
[1:15:47] of him I was an attribute a part of my
[1:15:49] father and you're a part of your father
[1:15:52] and as children of God we are a part of
[1:15:54] God's attribute that was in him made
[1:15:57] flesh like he was made flesh
[1:16:00] don't miss that
[1:16:02] he had to come in flesh so that you
[1:16:05] could come and flesh behind him and
[1:16:07] produce the exact same word that was
[1:16:09] written about you
[1:16:10] you are no less than him except he was
[1:16:13] the full manifestation and each of us is
[1:16:15] only a partial manifestation but it's
[1:16:17] the same word the same power in this
[1:16:20] very same lost flesh
[1:16:22] exactly the same thing
[1:16:25] he said why were we made flesh so we can
[1:16:27] have Fellowship one with the other as a
[1:16:30] family of God upon the Earth and that
[1:16:32] was God's purpose at the beginning yes
[1:16:34] sir that's what God wanted at the
[1:16:36] beginning
[1:16:37] and then this very thought of redemption
[1:16:39] is restoring to original position of
[1:16:41] relationship the thought of redemption
[1:16:43] is that we were with him before this all
[1:16:44] began you can't redeem that which was
[1:16:47] not deemed in the first place you had to
[1:16:49] be somewhere to be redeemed back to it
[1:16:52] that's why only the true children of God
[1:16:54] can be redeemed is because only they
[1:16:56] were in his thoughts only they are a
[1:16:58] part of his word so they're the only
[1:16:59] ones that can come back you can't redeem
[1:17:02] what isn't yours
[1:17:03] there are those that will be saved that
[1:17:06] aren't redeemed
[1:17:07] and that's the grace of God that wants
[1:17:09] to preserve life
[1:17:11] but the redeemed is the bride and bride
[1:17:13] alone
[1:17:14] that's how special you are this morning
[1:17:16] church you are the elect Pride you are
[1:17:19] the redeemed of Christ this morning
[1:17:22] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:17:24] world Amen you had to be with him to be
[1:17:26] redeemed back to him you had to have
[1:17:28] eternal life to be redeemed back to
[1:17:30] eternal life you had to have
[1:17:31] relationship to come back to
[1:17:32] relationship
[1:17:33] but let's take it back to the scriptures
[1:17:35] very familiar in Revelation 17 8 it says
[1:17:38] the Beast that thou sauce was and is not
[1:17:40] and shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[1:17:42] pit and go into Perdition and they that
[1:17:45] dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose
[1:17:47] names are not written in the Book of
[1:17:49] Life from the foundation of the world
[1:17:51] when they beheld the Beast that was and
[1:17:53] is not and yet is
[1:17:55] amen we're talking about the certainty
[1:17:57] of a seed and here's the second
[1:17:58] certainty we've got to have that we will
[1:18:00] come to life
[1:18:02] because not every seed has life in it
[1:18:04] it'll produce something but it'll die
[1:18:06] out or won't produce any fruit because
[1:18:08] it's not the original life it's not the
[1:18:10] Original Seed amen you've got to have a
[1:18:12] second certainty which is that of coming
[1:18:14] to life
[1:18:15] and the prophet will point to this time
[1:18:17] and time again as our certainty and he
[1:18:19] says you have eternal life because he
[1:18:22] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:18:23] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:18:27] you're an attribute of God and here's
[1:18:29] the thing I love about God is he didn't
[1:18:31] just write there's going to be an
[1:18:33] attribute
[1:18:35] but he said there's a name attached to
[1:18:37] that attribute there's a person that's
[1:18:39] attached to that attribute there's a
[1:18:40] personality that's attract that's
[1:18:42] attached to that attribute it can't just
[1:18:44] be anyone that doesn't he doesn't just
[1:18:46] say somebody is going to produce the
[1:18:48] patience of God in laodicea but instead
[1:18:50] he writes Maureen coffee is going to
[1:18:52] produce the patience of God in laodicea
[1:18:55] then he wrote Garfield Grant is going to
[1:18:58] produce the victory of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:00] then he wrote Amber coffee is going to
[1:19:02] produce the long suffering of Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ he put a name next to the
[1:19:06] attribute he made he said there's going
[1:19:08] to be a body there's going to be a
[1:19:09] person there's going to be a nature
[1:19:10] there's going to be an expression a
[1:19:12] living expression not just happenstance
[1:19:15] not just luck but specific to you
[1:19:18] when you're sitting here this morning
[1:19:20] it's because he called you specifically
[1:19:23] not that you somehow made up your mind
[1:19:25] about this but he called you out of this
[1:19:27] Earth and he said you will live for me
[1:19:29] you are me you are a production of me
[1:19:32] and there's something for you to do
[1:19:33] inside of this life
[1:19:35] we it's not just random it's not just
[1:19:36] happen sense Church
[1:19:39] what
[1:19:41] people in this world aren't built to
[1:19:42] live this but you're built to produce
[1:19:45] the exact word for this age The Living
[1:19:48] Word is inside of you and the Holy
[1:19:50] Spirit quickens it and you do something
[1:19:51] that you could never do otherwise
[1:19:54] brother Graham said this he says so God
[1:19:56] in the beginning was life the Eternal
[1:19:58] one in him were attributes and those
[1:20:01] attributes became words and the word
[1:20:03] became flesh
[1:20:05] then he says Jesus was the Redeemer of
[1:20:08] what those attributes
[1:20:10] he expressed it but there was a greater
[1:20:12] there was a greater expression meaning
[1:20:14] uh more expression he says until redeem
[1:20:17] means to bring back if he has to bring
[1:20:19] it back it had to be somewhere to be
[1:20:21] brought back to so you see all people
[1:20:24] will never be able to see it because all
[1:20:26] people weren't in the beginning in God's
[1:20:28] thoughts see
[1:20:30] you can talk to people and it can be as
[1:20:33] clear as clear can be
[1:20:35] and they won't get it
[1:20:37] why because there's nothing in them to
[1:20:40] receive it there is no resonance inside
[1:20:43] there isn't something inside of them
[1:20:44] there is no deep calling to the Deep
[1:20:47] that's why that's why the the scripture
[1:20:50] would say after the first or second
[1:20:51] admonition just let it go
[1:20:54] because there's nothing there to receive
[1:20:55] it
[1:20:56] now sometimes it's for another time
[1:21:00] it's not that we'll never talk to a
[1:21:01] person again or never witness to them
[1:21:02] again but don't force it because it's a
[1:21:05] work of God that has to do it you can't
[1:21:06] put eternal life into somebody you know
[1:21:09] the scripture says we impart eternal
[1:21:10] life how do we apart impart eternal life
[1:21:12] by giving them the word
[1:21:14] because the word is where the life is
[1:21:15] it's not in me or you to give it that
[1:21:17] way I can't give someone the Holy Ghost
[1:21:18] I can't give someone the new birth but I
[1:21:20] can show them the word that'll lead them
[1:21:21] to the New Birth which will take him
[1:21:22] into the holy spirit amen
[1:21:25] and maybe so our lives are not happens
[1:21:27] to answer chants or blind luck our young
[1:21:29] people that are sitting here and even
[1:21:30] myself being born into a message church
[1:21:33] this end time message is not luck
[1:21:36] that's the calling of God that's the
[1:21:38] ordination of God in our lives that
[1:21:40] would do that but yet we have people
[1:21:42] like brother Mark and brother grant that
[1:21:44] came out of other systems and that is no
[1:21:46] less the ordination of God
[1:21:48] 's got to start with something and
[1:21:50] usually he's got to stop with something
[1:21:51] that's outside and then he'll keep
[1:21:53] people inside of it but he's got to have
[1:21:55] ones that'll answer that call and come
[1:21:56] out of these things amen even our own uh
[1:21:59] brother Gerald you know out of Pentecost
[1:22:00] and Salvation Army and that to come out
[1:22:02] of those things to come into the full
[1:22:03] truth
[1:22:04] that takes what a deep inside that'll
[1:22:07] pull you out of that because most people
[1:22:08] can never break free of these things
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:11] so what the scripture and Revelation
[1:22:13] that we are looking at says what you are
[1:22:15] ordained to eternal life you are
[1:22:18] ordained to overcome you are ordained to
[1:22:20] be victorious you are ordained to
[1:22:22] produce the word for this age you are
[1:22:24] ordained to have a family that can serve
[1:22:26] God you are ordained to have the fruits
[1:22:28] of the spirit in your life amen you're
[1:22:30] ordained to tear down the works of
[1:22:31] Satan's kingdom in your life first and
[1:22:33] then in others afterwards and then
[1:22:35] you're ordained to all of these things
[1:22:37] amen it's an all or nothing proposition
[1:22:40] remember God is an absolute so he
[1:22:43] doesn't start us to fail us and so he's
[1:22:45] going to give it all to you or he's not
[1:22:47] going to give it to you in the first
[1:22:48] place
[1:22:48] it's an all or nothing proposition the
[1:22:51] only thing is is an All or Nothing
[1:22:52] proposition for us
[1:22:54] but we go all in or do we have one leg
[1:22:56] in and one leg out
[1:22:58] we're the only thing holding them back
[1:23:00] Church
[1:23:01] we're the only thing that's holding them
[1:23:02] back
[1:23:04] Jesus would say this he says for I came
[1:23:06] down from heaven not to do mine own will
[1:23:08] but the will of him that sent me and
[1:23:10] this is the Father's will which has sent
[1:23:12] me that all of which he hath given me I
[1:23:15] should lose nothing
[1:23:17] but shall raise it up again at the last
[1:23:19] day and this is the will of him that
[1:23:22] sent me that everyone everyone that
[1:23:25] seeth the son and believeth on him may
[1:23:27] have everlasting life and I will raise
[1:23:29] him up on the last day
[1:23:32] brother Brian would look at this and he
[1:23:33] would say now in the beginning was the
[1:23:35] word and the Word was made flesh and
[1:23:36] dwelt Among Us he says the three stages
[1:23:39] it was an attribute first in God that he
[1:23:42] thought of himself as being human and
[1:23:43] then transmitted him down to Jesus and
[1:23:46] then he says and now if you'll ever be
[1:23:48] there you were with him then
[1:23:50] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:23:53] and that's God and you had to be a part
[1:23:55] of God at the beginning not just what
[1:23:58] you chose down here he chose you
[1:24:03] remember seeds don't have intelligence
[1:24:05] they are what they are what was put in
[1:24:07] is what was put in and they didn't
[1:24:09] choose it but they are what they are by
[1:24:11] the original Creator the original
[1:24:13] designer amen
[1:24:15] so we don't get to choose either
[1:24:17] we see that with Esau Esau sought time
[1:24:20] and time again a place of repentance
[1:24:22] with tears he tried to tap into the life
[1:24:24] of God he tried to tap into the word of
[1:24:27] God but he could never do it because it
[1:24:29] wasn't in him to connect to in the first
[1:24:30] place and eventually he gave up and he
[1:24:32] went completely sideways
[1:24:34] why it wasn't in there in the first
[1:24:36] place but what's inside of us is the
[1:24:38] literal expression of God's attributes
[1:24:40] God's desires and God's intentions for
[1:24:43] you and I
[1:24:44] it's all built inside of us everything
[1:24:47] we have need of is inside of us and all
[1:24:48] it takes is the is the Holy Spirit by
[1:24:50] the word to Quicken it that's all it
[1:24:52] takes and once it started no man can
[1:24:54] stop at amen but brother I'm saying here
[1:24:57] we didn't choose him
[1:24:59] he chose us
[1:25:01] remember what Jesus said
[1:25:03] no man can come to me except the Father
[1:25:07] which has sent me draw him and I will
[1:25:10] raise them up in the last days Isaiah
[1:25:12] will put it this way he says I am sought
[1:25:14] of them that ask not for me I am found
[1:25:16] of them that sought me not I said behold
[1:25:19] me behold me unto a nation that was not
[1:25:22] called by my name in other words he's
[1:25:24] saying we seek after God because he put
[1:25:26] something in us to do it not because we
[1:25:28] in ourselves wanted to do it amen God
[1:25:31] set a call in our lives and we're
[1:25:33] Gentiles every one of us were outside of
[1:25:35] the natural lineage of Abraham we're
[1:25:36] outside of the natural call children of
[1:25:39] God yet he says there's people that are
[1:25:41] going to call on me that aren't even
[1:25:42] seeking after me he says we seek after
[1:25:44] him but we didn't ask to do it
[1:25:47] that's how gracious he is that's how
[1:25:49] perfect predestination is is we get
[1:25:51] something that in our in and of
[1:25:53] ourselves we would never call for we're
[1:25:55] born outside of it we're born outside of
[1:25:56] of the original message we're born
[1:25:58] outside of the original gospel and yet
[1:26:00] there's something inside of us he says
[1:26:02] we find God and yet it is not because we
[1:26:04] look for him but rather because he says
[1:26:07] behold me he revealed himself to us
[1:26:11] we didn't go looking for him he stepped
[1:26:13] into our lives and said here I am the
[1:26:15] word for your day
[1:26:17] that's what happened wasn't it brother
[1:26:19] Mark literally the word stepped in front
[1:26:21] of him and says here I am and he says
[1:26:22] whoa
[1:26:24] that's him
[1:26:25] that's him and from that minute there
[1:26:27] was no changing
[1:26:29] it was a done deal
[1:26:31] but here's the thing it always was a
[1:26:32] done deal
[1:26:34] it always was a done deal but he what
[1:26:36] got a revelation of what that word was
[1:26:38] and he stepped into it and it was
[1:26:40] quickened into life that seed inside of
[1:26:41] him and all of a sudden he can walk and
[1:26:42] he can live an overcoming Victorious
[1:26:44] Life for the rest of his life why
[1:26:45] because it's inside of him to do it it's
[1:26:48] just taking the quickening of God Amen
[1:26:51] brother Graham says this he says where
[1:26:52] was Jesus slain at Calvary no sir Jesus
[1:26:55] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:26:57] world he said behold the land of God
[1:26:59] Lamb of God that was slain before the
[1:27:01] foundation of the world God in the
[1:27:03] beginning when he saw the sin he saw
[1:27:05] what was happened he spoke the word and
[1:27:07] Jesus was slain before the foundation of
[1:27:10] the world and every person that was
[1:27:12] saved was saved according to the Bible
[1:27:15] when the lamb was slain in the mind of
[1:27:17] God before the foundation of the world
[1:27:19] you were included in Salvation then
[1:27:23] he says so what are you going to do
[1:27:25] about it we're talking about a certainty
[1:27:27] of the seed this morning what are you
[1:27:29] going to do you're going to change it
[1:27:30] can you change it
[1:27:32] you can't it's a finished work it's
[1:27:34] already done he says it's God blessed be
[1:27:37] the name of the Lord It's God that
[1:27:39] worketh not him that willeth or him that
[1:27:41] runeth but God showeth Mercy hey don't
[1:27:43] stop working don't stop running but
[1:27:46] recognize you're doing it because he's
[1:27:47] called you to do it and he's the one
[1:27:49] that's given you the power to do it amen
[1:27:51] he says because the he says uh it was
[1:27:54] Jesus slain before the foundation of the
[1:27:56] world and it took 4 000 years before it
[1:28:00] actually happened you talk about a seed
[1:28:01] planting
[1:28:02] 4 000 years but when God spoke it back
[1:28:05] here every word of God is steadfast it's
[1:28:09] immutable it's impartable it cannot fail
[1:28:12] and when God slayed the psalm before the
[1:28:14] foundation of the world he was just as
[1:28:16] much slain than as he was at Calvary
[1:28:18] it's a finished product When God says so
[1:28:21] that means you're a finished product
[1:28:22] from back then as well
[1:28:25] because you were under the blood of the
[1:28:26] Covenant back then the perfect Covenant
[1:28:29] the finishing Covenant the Grace
[1:28:31] Covenant was already there before he
[1:28:33] ever came you were included in that amen
[1:28:35] it's already done we sing that song it's
[1:28:38] already done everything you ever needed
[1:28:40] was finished before you ever even
[1:28:41] arrived on this planet
[1:28:43] he says and remember when the lamb was
[1:28:45] slain your salvation was included in the
[1:28:48] sacrifice the but because the Bible said
[1:28:49] that your name was written on the Lamb's
[1:28:51] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:28:53] the world he says what about that then
[1:28:55] what are we going to do it's God that
[1:28:57] shows Mercy it's God that called you
[1:28:59] it's God that chose you in Christ before
[1:29:01] the foundation of the world Jesus said
[1:29:03] you never chose me I chose you and I
[1:29:06] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:29:08] world there you are so you weren't just
[1:29:11] a believer and he says well there's
[1:29:13] going to be a believer named Rebecca
[1:29:15] coffee or Dale won't slager
[1:29:18] no no you're ordained to be a believer
[1:29:21] today in this age and he said in that
[1:29:24] layout to see an age I'm going to have
[1:29:26] children of God and I'm going to have
[1:29:27] sons of God and I'm going to have
[1:29:28] daughters of God and they're going to
[1:29:30] overcome and they're going to live
[1:29:32] Victorious and they're going to have
[1:29:33] hard times but they're going to come
[1:29:34] through them
[1:29:35] and they're going to make difficult
[1:29:37] decisions but I'm going to be with them
[1:29:38] in those times they're going to have
[1:29:40] Financial issues but I'm going to still
[1:29:41] provide they're going to have health
[1:29:42] issues but I'm still gonna heal
[1:29:44] and I'm going to produce a perfect word
[1:29:46] out of all of these things amen listen
[1:29:48] what's he saying he's saying you are a
[1:29:50] finished work that's the second
[1:29:52] certainty it's not just that it's in you
[1:29:54] but then it's going to come out because
[1:29:56] he put a name next to the attribute that
[1:29:58] is you in the word of God Amen
[1:30:01] amen we saw this in our opening
[1:30:02] scripture this morning that we are here
[1:30:04] by the choosing of God and that alone is
[1:30:06] what makes us children of God Amen we
[1:30:09] cannot die
[1:30:10] we cannot lose
[1:30:12] we cannot be forsaken we cannot be
[1:30:14] destroyed
[1:30:15] nothing
[1:30:17] what can separate us from the love of
[1:30:19] God
[1:30:20] Church what's going on in your life that
[1:30:23] can separate you from that
[1:30:25] from a name that's already written in a
[1:30:27] book that cannot be erased that's how
[1:30:30] perfect that's how he says immutable it
[1:30:33] cannot be changed he cannot change his
[1:30:35] mind he chooses perfectly from the
[1:30:38] beginning you are his perfect choice
[1:30:42] you are his perfect choice
[1:30:45] can you say it this morning I am his
[1:30:47] perfect choice
[1:30:50] if only we could receive it
[1:30:53] every day and say I am his choice
[1:30:57] he chose me to walk before him in love
[1:31:02] and grace and mercy and power and
[1:31:06] authority and victory every single day
[1:31:10] no matter what conditions no matter how
[1:31:13] dirty it is whether it's a drought
[1:31:15] season whether it's a wet season whether
[1:31:17] it's the middle of the summer that we're
[1:31:18] loving right now or whether it's the
[1:31:19] coldest winter we've ever had yet he has
[1:31:22] called me to walk before him in
[1:31:23] perfection in his word he chose me
[1:31:26] perfectly
[1:31:29] amen
[1:31:31] it's a work of God start to finish and
[1:31:33] it's a finished work and we're just in a
[1:31:35] body of time to prove it out
[1:31:37] but it's already done
[1:31:38] let's go back to our original scripture
[1:31:40] he says for the Lord had chosen Zion who
[1:31:43] is Zion
[1:31:44] Zion is always the bride always the
[1:31:47] bride you have Jerusalem which is Israel
[1:31:49] but inside of Jerusalem is Mount Zion
[1:31:52] and that's the bride that's the chosen
[1:31:54] place that's the dwelling place of God
[1:31:55] he says the Lord had chosen the Zion who
[1:31:58] desired it
[1:32:00] he had desired it
[1:32:03] what for
[1:32:05] as a trophy
[1:32:08] for his habitation
[1:32:10] God has chosen us he has desired us to
[1:32:13] be his habitation amen
[1:32:15] you can't want it unless he desired it
[1:32:17] first
[1:32:18] remember because he's got to call us
[1:32:20] first it's his desire that puts a desire
[1:32:22] inside of you he says this is my rest
[1:32:25] forever
[1:32:27] here will I dwell for I have desired it
[1:32:31] how long forever
[1:32:32] why because he's already declared it in
[1:32:34] his word he cannot change it he chose
[1:32:36] perfectly
[1:32:38] amen
[1:32:39] you are the Eternal resting place of God
[1:32:43] why because you're a part of his word
[1:32:46] God is his word God is in his word amen
[1:32:49] this is what we're talking about this
[1:32:50] morning this is my rest forever here
[1:32:52] will I dwell for I have desired it
[1:32:55] you know what that means even when I
[1:32:57] don't want it
[1:32:58] it's not going to change it
[1:33:01] you ever have a day where you woke up
[1:33:02] and you said
[1:33:04] it's going to be a rough one
[1:33:06] listen we wake up
[1:33:09] and we know we've got things ahead of us
[1:33:10] in a day that aren't going to be easy
[1:33:12] and you know why
[1:33:14] they're not easy it's because we're
[1:33:16] going to do it by the word
[1:33:17] and that is not the easiest thing to do
[1:33:19] because every gun in hell is turned
[1:33:22] against people that will put the word
[1:33:23] before them
[1:33:24] every day we wake up it's going to be a
[1:33:26] battle
[1:33:27] and sometimes it's less of a battle than
[1:33:29] others but it's still going to be a
[1:33:30] battle every single day amen
[1:33:33] it's not always easy being a Christian
[1:33:36] and then we're not carried to heaven on
[1:33:37] beds of ease
[1:33:39] they remember Warriors
[1:33:41] it's a it's a battle every single day to
[1:33:43] live this Christian walk
[1:33:45] remember the battle shouldn't be
[1:33:46] internal
[1:33:47] the battle should be externally men
[1:33:50] he says before there was a world you
[1:33:52] were in God's thoughts to give you the
[1:33:53] Holy Ghost
[1:33:55] can I get the Holy Ghost brother John
[1:33:57] you were in his thoughts to get it
[1:33:59] because that's the only thing that'll
[1:34:00] Quicken what's inside of you
[1:34:02] if he chose you perfectly he has to give
[1:34:04] the perfect provision as well and that's
[1:34:06] his very own life before there was a
[1:34:08] world you were in God's thoughts to give
[1:34:09] you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd
[1:34:12] be wanting it if you've got a desire for
[1:34:14] it it's because he put it there he says
[1:34:17] and he chose you himself because you
[1:34:19] desired he says he chose you in Christ
[1:34:21] before you or Jesus any of you were on
[1:34:23] the earth and He sent Jesus to die to
[1:34:25] prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost
[1:34:27] to bring you to himself he says oh that
[1:34:29] is so rich to me to think it's not what
[1:34:31] I wanted
[1:34:34] I told you before I had great plans to
[1:34:36] not serve the Lord
[1:34:39] come on now
[1:34:42] I had great plans to have great plans
[1:34:46] I was going to be a doctor and I was
[1:34:48] going to make hundreds of thousands of
[1:34:49] dollars and have great sports cars and
[1:34:51] have an enjoyable life in big homes and
[1:34:54] great vacations
[1:34:55] and a beautiful wife and he gave me one
[1:34:57] of those things
[1:35:00] but
[1:35:02] but there was nothing in me that desired
[1:35:04] that
[1:35:06] but he chose me
[1:35:09] and when the moment came he turned my
[1:35:11] heart like that
[1:35:12] and there was never going back
[1:35:14] and all of a sudden
[1:35:16] I saw what we read in Jeremiah 29 11
[1:35:18] this morning
[1:35:20] that he thinks great thoughts towards us
[1:35:22] he's already thought him he doesn't
[1:35:24] change him and it's to bring you to an
[1:35:26] expected end
[1:35:27] men thoughts of Peace not of evil
[1:35:31] the way he looks rough
[1:35:32] but there's peace through it all and
[1:35:34] there's something waiting at the end
[1:35:35] that's worth it all he said to think
[1:35:37] it's not what I wanted it wasn't my
[1:35:39] desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my
[1:35:42] choosing I had not one thing to do with
[1:35:45] it and if you didn't have it that back
[1:35:47] then you don't have one thing to do with
[1:35:48] it now
[1:35:50] God's going to get you
[1:35:52] he's going to get you
[1:35:54] stop fighting
[1:35:56] you keep putting off that decision you
[1:35:58] know you're supposed to make stop
[1:35:59] fighting and just do it because God's
[1:36:00] going to get you there one way or the
[1:36:01] other
[1:36:03] like I said before I was 10 when I
[1:36:04] started to feel the pull of God in my
[1:36:06] life
[1:36:07] to give my heart to him and it was 17
[1:36:08] until I gave it to him seven years of
[1:36:10] misery
[1:36:12] imagine what he could have done perhaps
[1:36:14] if I would have done it at 10 instead of
[1:36:15] 17.
[1:36:16] but yet he preserved me he kept me
[1:36:19] mostly
[1:36:22] right
[1:36:24] don't put it off
[1:36:26] because he's already chosen you you're
[1:36:27] not going to get away from it
[1:36:28] that desire's in there and it's saying
[1:36:30] it's not going away
[1:36:32] he says I had not one thing to do with
[1:36:33] it but before the world ever started God
[1:36:36] saw us and put our name on the Lamb's
[1:36:38] Book of Life before there was even a
[1:36:40] world he says talk about God that's the
[1:36:43] kind of God we serve
[1:36:44] that's the kind of God we serve amen
[1:36:46] that he has ordained it he has
[1:36:48] predestinated he has planned it and then
[1:36:50] he spoke it and now it's got to happen
[1:36:52] but if I would say this and whatever
[1:36:54] Christ was I am
[1:36:59] really
[1:37:01] can we say that word that this morning
[1:37:03] whatever Christ was I am what he is I am
[1:37:06] what Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:37:09] yesterday today and forever remember he
[1:37:11] said we are in the same flesh producing
[1:37:13] the same word that Jesus Christ did
[1:37:16] I'm just not all of it but I'm the same
[1:37:18] stuff
[1:37:20] what was that slogan the right stuff
[1:37:23] we're the right stuff
[1:37:25] we're exactly the same as him we're just
[1:37:27] a teaspoon out of the ocean
[1:37:28] but it's no less it's no less God Amen
[1:37:31] he says oh God if he is considered a
[1:37:33] fanatic so must I be
[1:37:35] if he was a Beelzebub by The Works of
[1:37:37] his spirit I am too
[1:37:39] so when people prop you up and say
[1:37:41] you're a wonderful son and daughter of
[1:37:42] God say praise the Lord and when they
[1:37:44] say well you're be yells above then say
[1:37:45] praise the Lord as well because they
[1:37:47] call them both
[1:37:49] he says whatever he was I am whatever he
[1:37:53] was you are we must be the makers of her
[1:37:56] immortality her Freedom or her Fame her
[1:37:58] glory or her shame he's talking about
[1:37:59] the bride we must be that we must be the
[1:38:02] church the Bride of Jesus Christ I live
[1:38:04] with him on the earth when he lived I
[1:38:06] die with him when he died I rose with
[1:38:07] him when he rose I'm assembled and
[1:38:09] seated with him now in Heavenly places
[1:38:11] because I'm part of him wherever he is
[1:38:14] there I am where my servant is there
[1:38:16] will I be also he says now
[1:38:20] he can fellowship with us
[1:38:22] and through us and rest his word with us
[1:38:27] which we are a part of his word if he is
[1:38:29] the word and we are part of him then we
[1:38:31] are part of the word he says now
[1:38:33] transforming he can transform us through
[1:38:36] his word that we can rest because we are
[1:38:40] a part of it where's our rest today
[1:38:45] is our rest because we're sitting in
[1:38:47] this church this morning
[1:38:48] is our rest because we've heard the
[1:38:50] prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:38:52] that cannot be our rest
[1:38:55] don't stop those things don't look past
[1:38:57] those things but many heard Jesus
[1:38:59] message and went all the way to hell
[1:39:01] many were sitting in the day of
[1:39:03] scriptures being fulfilled and never
[1:39:05] fulfilled a single one that is not what
[1:39:07] makes us Believers amen those are good
[1:39:09] things don't lose sight of them but our
[1:39:10] rest is in what the choosing of God
[1:39:13] the ordained will of God the purpose of
[1:39:15] God the election of God the desires of
[1:39:17] God and that's what's keeping us moving
[1:39:19] forward because his word cannot return
[1:39:21] to him void
[1:39:22] we sang that song Last service something
[1:39:24] keeps holding me
[1:39:26] there are days where it feels like we
[1:39:28] don't have any strength and yet we Press
[1:39:30] On
[1:39:30] we keep going why because his word
[1:39:32] cannot return to him void and it keeps
[1:39:34] pulling us forward and forward and
[1:39:36] forward and Higher and Higher and Higher
[1:39:38] and Away in a way and away from the
[1:39:40] world until one day we're going to step
[1:39:41] right off of this planet amen
[1:39:44] he can transform us through his word
[1:39:46] that we can rest because we are a part
[1:39:49] of it amen his choosing puts a desire in
[1:39:51] us to choose him
[1:39:54] and after that comes what the holy
[1:39:56] spirit that quickens the life inside of
[1:39:58] us to produce the word for our day
[1:40:01] listen to this this is one of the most
[1:40:04] beautiful things I think in scripture I
[1:40:05] can put myself here
[1:40:07] it says and the Lord said Simon Simon
[1:40:11] and the Lord said Jonathan Jonathan
[1:40:14] and the Lord said Kingsley Kingsley
[1:40:17] and the Lord said Abby Abby Satan had
[1:40:20] desired to have you that he may sift you
[1:40:22] as wheat now you think about what
[1:40:24] sifting wheat is right
[1:40:26] so he used to do the threshing floor and
[1:40:28] what would they do they would throw it
[1:40:30] up in the air
[1:40:31] to blow the chaff away
[1:40:33] but if you get a strong enough wind
[1:40:36] and you can get that wheat up in there
[1:40:37] it'll blow it away from all the other
[1:40:39] wheat and it won't be gathered into the
[1:40:40] Garner
[1:40:41] it'll be separated out of Fellowship
[1:40:44] they'll be separated out from hearing
[1:40:46] the word
[1:40:47] and he'll get you out to a place where
[1:40:48] there's nobody else around you
[1:40:50] and then the question is will you
[1:40:51] survive or not
[1:40:54] he says Satan's trying to do this
[1:40:57] he's trying to sift you out he's trying
[1:40:58] to get you separated he's trying to get
[1:40:59] you away from fellowship trying to get
[1:41:01] you away from Believers trying to get
[1:41:03] you away from the preaching hearing of
[1:41:04] the word trying to get you out of the
[1:41:06] place where you'll grow
[1:41:08] he says but I have prayed for thee
[1:41:11] that thy faith fail not and when thou
[1:41:14] art converted strengthen thy Brethren
[1:41:16] Church that's their we are there that
[1:41:19] wasn't just for Peter
[1:41:21] Jesus said I sanctify myself for what
[1:41:23] them those that are coming he did all of
[1:41:27] this he wasn't just praying for Peter he
[1:41:28] was praying for the complete elect lady
[1:41:30] the entire bride of Christ there that
[1:41:32] they would not fail and listen this is
[1:41:34] one man whose prayers are always
[1:41:36] answered
[1:41:37] amen we're before the throne of grace
[1:41:39] he's ever interceding for those needs
[1:41:42] for us amen that we will not fail that
[1:41:45] the world will produce what it said
[1:41:46] inside of us amen
[1:41:48] but you know sometimes we forget
[1:41:51] we forget we're Zion we forget where the
[1:41:53] bride of Christ we get caught up in
[1:41:55] situations we get caught up because our
[1:41:57] finances aren't doing well we get caught
[1:41:58] up because our health isn't going so
[1:41:59] well we get caught up because our
[1:42:01] marriage is struggling we get caught up
[1:42:02] because our job is on Rocky ground of
[1:42:04] some sort and the conditions surround us
[1:42:07] and all of a sudden we start to forget
[1:42:09] I'm the chosen elect Lady of God
[1:42:14] maybe it's just me
[1:42:16] but there's days where you're not really
[1:42:18] sure who and what you are
[1:42:19] because Satan gets our eyes off of what
[1:42:22] what the word says about us
[1:42:25] and we start to feed on circumstances
[1:42:27] rather than feed on to finish work
[1:42:29] that was done before the foundation of
[1:42:31] the world Amen
[1:42:32] you know what I love
[1:42:34] God knows when we get in those places
[1:42:37] he knows it and he understands it
[1:42:40] and he knows it so well that he actually
[1:42:41] wrote about it
[1:42:43] he wrote about a Zion that felt forsaken
[1:42:46] why because he knew we were going to
[1:42:48] feel forsaken
[1:42:49] you know that circumstances would make
[1:42:51] us think that we're forsaken
[1:42:54] that in the down times we think that
[1:42:55] he'd left us that when we pray that he
[1:42:57] wouldn't hear us
[1:42:59] that when we'd ask he wouldn't heal us
[1:43:01] and we get down down down and we'd feel
[1:43:04] Forsaken and he gave us a word for The
[1:43:06] Forsaken ones he didn't say those silly
[1:43:08] people
[1:43:10] why are they always forgetting
[1:43:13] don't they read my word don't they
[1:43:15] listen to my message
[1:43:17] don't they go to church twice a week why
[1:43:19] do I have to no no he didn't say that
[1:43:21] he could be touched by your infirmities
[1:43:23] by our weaknesses by our shortcomings by
[1:43:25] our human frailties and he said this in
[1:43:27] Isaiah 49 he says but Zion said the Lord
[1:43:31] hath forsaken me and my Lord hath
[1:43:33] forgotten me
[1:43:36] anyone felt forsaken lately
[1:43:39] prayers unanswered situations not moving
[1:43:43] clients not coming jobs not changing
[1:43:46] children not being saved
[1:43:53] we feel forsaken at times
[1:43:56] that doesn't mean he doesn't hear us
[1:43:58] that doesn't mean he's not moving
[1:44:01] but you've got to take yourself back to
[1:44:03] what he said about you
[1:44:04] amen
[1:44:07] you can't lose the Holy Ghost
[1:44:10] you can't lose it once you got it you're
[1:44:11] sealed to the day of your Redemption
[1:44:14] so never get that thought in your mind
[1:44:16] that I had it but I lost it
[1:44:18] now you may never have had it
[1:44:21] you may never have had it but if you
[1:44:23] ever get it you'll never lose it and
[1:44:25] here's the thing once he gives it to you
[1:44:26] once he'll fill you over and over and
[1:44:29] over and over again and sometimes that's
[1:44:31] what we're feeling forsaken is because
[1:44:32] we just haven't had a feeling in a while
[1:44:34] and that's what we really need is we
[1:44:36] need God to fill our lives again amen
[1:44:39] he says this can a woman forget her
[1:44:41] sucking child that she should not have
[1:44:44] compassion on the son of her womb yea
[1:44:46] they may forget yet will I not forget
[1:44:49] thee
[1:44:50] our sisters when they have babies once
[1:44:52] that baby is born and they nurse for
[1:44:54] that first time that mother will never
[1:44:56] forget that child
[1:44:58] he says they might God says they might
[1:45:01] he says but I won't
[1:45:03] you're that dear to me he says behold I
[1:45:06] have Graven thee upon the palms of my
[1:45:08] hands thy walls are continuously before
[1:45:12] me
[1:45:13] never forgets us never forsakes us
[1:45:16] though appearance appearances may say
[1:45:19] otherwise in our own eyes sometimes
[1:45:22] power remind us in Hebrews he says let
[1:45:24] your conversation be without
[1:45:25] covetousness
[1:45:27] and be content with such things as you
[1:45:29] have for he has said I will never leave
[1:45:32] thee nor forsake thee
[1:45:35] what's Paul saying he's saying you're
[1:45:36] looking at your life
[1:45:38] and you're saying brother Paul has a
[1:45:40] nicer estate than I do
[1:45:44] and brother Matt has a nicer car than I
[1:45:46] do
[1:45:47] and brother Bob has a nicer retirement
[1:45:49] than I do
[1:45:51] and brother John has a Pulpit and I
[1:45:53] don't
[1:45:54] and this sisters no no no no
[1:45:56] he says that's not what you're supposed
[1:45:57] to be looking at be content with what
[1:45:59] he's given you once he said I have said
[1:46:01] I will never leave thee or forsake thee
[1:46:03] remember what do you tell Abraham I am
[1:46:05] thy ice exceeding great reward
[1:46:07] just remember I'm with you that's the
[1:46:10] thing that matters most in all of this
[1:46:12] we're not going to take anything with us
[1:46:13] except our character
[1:46:15] the nice car is going to burn just as
[1:46:17] well as the old car
[1:46:19] the small house is going to burn just as
[1:46:20] much as the big house
[1:46:22] the hundred thousand dollars in the bank
[1:46:23] is going to burn just as much as the
[1:46:25] minus 50.
[1:46:26] it's all going but he says what
[1:46:29] take take peace take rest with the fact
[1:46:32] that I said I'll never leave you or
[1:46:33] forsake you
[1:46:35] Joshua 1 5.
[1:46:37] this is our scripture he says there
[1:46:39] shall not be any man be able to stand
[1:46:41] before thee all the days of thy life as
[1:46:43] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[1:46:46] I will not fail thee
[1:46:53] but he's not moving Brother John
[1:46:55] situations getting worse
[1:46:58] I will not fail thee listen he was four
[1:47:02] days late for Lazarus they thought
[1:47:05] amen why do you have to let them die in
[1:47:07] the first place
[1:47:08] four days late but he was right on time
[1:47:12] amen God will let you get right down to
[1:47:15] the very last millimeter of disaster and
[1:47:19] then he'll step in
[1:47:22] look at the three Hebrew children
[1:47:25] I think brother Berry was talking about
[1:47:26] it wasn't he
[1:47:28] brought right up to where everyone
[1:47:30] around them is dying and death seems
[1:47:31] certain at the very last step and they
[1:47:33] have to step in and God still isn't
[1:47:35] there
[1:47:36] as far as they can see
[1:47:38] but yet they're standing in conditions
[1:47:39] that would kill any other Mortal and yet
[1:47:42] they're living
[1:47:43] and then they step right into the fire
[1:47:44] and nothing happens except their bonds
[1:47:46] are broken
[1:47:48] why he was with him all the time and
[1:47:50] then he appeared and he fellowship with
[1:47:52] them and they were so happy to be in his
[1:47:55] presence they didn't even walk out of
[1:47:56] the fire they waited for the king to
[1:47:58] call them out that's how comfortable
[1:47:59] they were in the fire why because the
[1:48:01] presence of God the son of man the Son
[1:48:03] of God was right in their midst showing
[1:48:05] them he had been with them all the time
[1:48:06] encouraging his children
[1:48:11] you know this life it's meant to grind
[1:48:13] us down
[1:48:16] this is a grinder you know there's that
[1:48:19] that saying that life chews us up and
[1:48:20] spits us out and Satan's goal is to get
[1:48:23] us so beat up
[1:48:25] and so worn out and so tired and so
[1:48:27] stressed that we're just like that limp
[1:48:28] dish rag on the side of the sink
[1:48:31] and it's good for nothing it has no
[1:48:32] resistance it has no strength it has no
[1:48:34] use it's just laying on who
[1:48:36] completely beat out
[1:48:38] why because he wants to put doubt inside
[1:48:40] of us
[1:48:41] to counteract the faith that God has
[1:48:43] already anchored inside of us
[1:48:45] that's all he's trying to do he's trying
[1:48:46] to get us to feed on doubt
[1:48:49] which is circumstance
[1:48:51] rather than Faith which is the word
[1:48:53] promise that's it
[1:48:55] and you know what wins brother Brown
[1:48:56] would say I got a black dog and a white
[1:48:58] dog remember he tells a story which ones
[1:49:00] which one's winning whichever one I'm
[1:49:02] feeding the most
[1:49:04] when times get tough
[1:49:06] you know what makes them tougher when
[1:49:07] you're not feeding on the right things
[1:49:09] is that simple
[1:49:11] it's that simple you feed on the word
[1:49:12] then you're going to get word results
[1:49:13] you'll feed on doubt you'll get doubt
[1:49:15] results which is always going to be
[1:49:17] opposite to what the word says amen but
[1:49:19] if he could ever get if you could ever
[1:49:22] get
[1:49:23] to the place where every time it comes
[1:49:24] up you go back and you say I want to see
[1:49:26] what God said about me
[1:49:28] I want to see what God said about the
[1:49:30] situation and you look until you find it
[1:49:32] that'll build faith in you like you've
[1:49:34] never had before because now you've got
[1:49:36] a resting place remember he says God
[1:49:38] wants to have a place where he can rest
[1:49:40] his word in you rest his word in you you
[1:49:45] got to feed on it
[1:49:46] you got to take it for yourself amen
[1:49:52] but if we can walk in those promises
[1:49:53] that's when Victory comes
[1:49:56] took him many years to take Canaan
[1:49:59] but after a few little initial hiccups
[1:50:01] they never lost a battle why because
[1:50:03] they stuck with what God had told them
[1:50:04] to do every single time
[1:50:08] Deuteronomy 11 18 this is Moses speaking
[1:50:11] of children of Israel he says therefore
[1:50:12] shall ye lay up these my words in your
[1:50:14] heart and in your soul and bind them for
[1:50:16] a sign upon your hand that they may be
[1:50:19] as frontlets
[1:50:20] between your eyes
[1:50:22] that's what we call blinders on a horse
[1:50:25] and you notice when that horse is
[1:50:26] wearing blinders he can't see anything
[1:50:32] because remember a horse's eyes are on
[1:50:33] the side of his head so that horse is
[1:50:36] completely blind to what's going on
[1:50:38] around him he can hear and he can feel
[1:50:40] and he can smell and all these things
[1:50:41] but he can't see a single thing and the
[1:50:43] only thing that guides him is what the
[1:50:45] Reigns so he has to completely trust
[1:50:48] that the driver that's holding the reins
[1:50:51] sees everything that's going on
[1:50:53] that's what the word has already taken
[1:50:55] care of God's already ordained what's
[1:50:57] going to happen and you just have to
[1:50:58] walk in it he's saying let the word
[1:51:00] guide you
[1:51:02] it also means don't look at what's going
[1:51:05] on
[1:51:06] don't look at what's going on because
[1:51:07] that's only going to raise concerns
[1:51:09] we're in Satan's eating looking around
[1:51:11] just raises concerns doesn't it
[1:51:16] don't look around look at the word let
[1:51:19] them be if word is frontlets all you can
[1:51:21] see is the word the word the word all
[1:51:23] you can read is the word the word the
[1:51:24] word all you can hear is the word the
[1:51:25] word the word and you have what The
[1:51:26] Guiding Light of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:51:28] pushing you along where that word tells
[1:51:29] you to go
[1:51:31] laughs
[1:51:32] and he says if you do this
[1:51:34] every place where on the soles of your
[1:51:37] feet shall tread shall be yours why
[1:51:40] because the word's guiding you see this
[1:51:41] is where we get this this Doctrine mixed
[1:51:43] up and speak the word and do this and
[1:51:45] that no no to do that you've got to be
[1:51:47] guided by the word and we'll get into
[1:51:49] this in the next few Services where
[1:51:50] brother Brown would say you take the
[1:51:51] word for your day for your age for your
[1:51:54] position for your place and that's what
[1:51:56] you're speaking you're not running
[1:51:57] willy-nilly around but you're put taking
[1:51:59] what the word for you and you speak that
[1:52:02] and you walk in that and you possess
[1:52:04] that
[1:52:06] because you can't go after another day's
[1:52:07] message you can't go for another day's
[1:52:08] results you're here for this day's
[1:52:10] results by the word amen so those word
[1:52:12] that word is in front of you and all you
[1:52:14] can see is the word we should really do
[1:52:15] it like this because as humans this is
[1:52:16] the way we do it and all you can see
[1:52:18] is the word the word the word the word
[1:52:20] the word and you're just walking the way
[1:52:22] that word tells you to go
[1:52:24] it's so simple
[1:52:26] remember that a man though a fool should
[1:52:28] not air therein if you keep the word
[1:52:30] before you he says every place we're on
[1:52:33] the soles of your feet shall tread shall
[1:52:34] be yours from the Wilderness in Lebanon
[1:52:36] from the river the river Euphrates even
[1:52:38] Under the uttermost Sea shall your Coast
[1:52:40] be there shall no man be able to stand
[1:52:42] before you for the Lord your God shall
[1:52:44] lay the fear of you and the dread of you
[1:52:46] upon all the land that you shall tread
[1:52:48] upon as he has said unto you
[1:52:52] our Assurance is not just that we are
[1:52:54] his children
[1:52:56] but that we are his name-written
[1:52:58] children in a book of life
[1:53:01] that there's a specific person there's a
[1:53:03] specific personality there's a specific
[1:53:05] body there's a specific lineage that he
[1:53:07] has called out to be his children in
[1:53:10] this age amen he wrote our names
[1:53:12] on a Lamb's Book of Life and then that
[1:53:14] means we're destined for life
[1:53:17] eternal life that we're destined for
[1:53:19] overcoming power that were destined for
[1:53:21] victory
[1:53:22] that were destined for grace and mercy
[1:53:24] that were destined for the fruits of the
[1:53:25] spirit
[1:53:26] that were destined to bring Salvation to
[1:53:28] others
[1:53:30] that were destined to produce the word
[1:53:31] for this age perfectly and exactly as he
[1:53:35] has called for it to be amen he'll take
[1:53:37] us all the way into maturity all the way
[1:53:39] into that final resurrection that final
[1:53:41] Rapture that moment where we step into
[1:53:44] total glorification and we are exactly
[1:53:46] exactly as he is
[1:53:49] the promise of his word
[1:53:52] Jesus said this he said the thief cometh
[1:53:55] not but for to still steal and to kill
[1:53:58] and destroy
[1:54:00] I am come that they might have life
[1:54:04] that's it life
[1:54:06] to do what produce the word that's what
[1:54:09] life is
[1:54:11] the word made flesh he says that they
[1:54:13] might have life and that they might have
[1:54:14] it more abundantly
[1:54:16] amen that there's more than what I have
[1:54:18] today I'm resting in that I'm trusting
[1:54:21] in that that there's more than what I
[1:54:22] have today not that it's not laid before
[1:54:24] me but there's more for me to be
[1:54:26] expressed
[1:54:27] because why there's a desire in me for
[1:54:29] more there's something in me that's
[1:54:31] calling out for more that's saying Lord
[1:54:32] make me more like you
[1:54:34] Lord draw out more of the word not just
[1:54:37] for my sake but for the benefit of those
[1:54:38] that are around me
[1:54:40] then we would draw people unto him that
[1:54:42] we would draw people to Calvary not to
[1:54:44] ourselves but that they could see a
[1:54:46] shining light in a dark world
[1:54:48] amen
[1:54:50] one more quote as we close
[1:54:53] brother Bible say this he says in the
[1:54:54] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:54:56] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:54:59] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Now
[1:55:01] Catch This
[1:55:03] there can be no satisfaction
[1:55:06] until this word which is God becomes
[1:55:10] alive in you and then you see God
[1:55:12] himself fulfilling the promises that he
[1:55:15] made in the Bible
[1:55:18] that's what I'm seeking for
[1:55:20] every promise in the book is mine
[1:55:23] every chapter every verse every line
[1:55:26] that's written about me
[1:55:28] we've got Redemptive promises
[1:55:31] and then we've got adoptive promises
[1:55:33] and some of them are only for certain
[1:55:35] people in certain positions and some of
[1:55:36] them are for everyone that's a child of
[1:55:38] God healing is for everybody
[1:55:40] that's a children's bread
[1:55:42] the Holy Ghost is for everybody
[1:55:45] that's what proves your son or daughter
[1:55:46] of God in the first place but there's
[1:55:48] things that are ordained just for
[1:55:49] mothers just for fathers just for
[1:55:52] ministers Just For Men just for women
[1:55:55] but he says you won't have any
[1:55:57] satisfaction there'll be no satisfaction
[1:55:59] until what this word becomes alive in
[1:56:02] you fulfilling what the promises of this
[1:56:04] age
[1:56:05] what's the greatest promise
[1:56:09] Resurrection or rapture
[1:56:11] that's all I care about that's all I
[1:56:13] care about that's all that's left for us
[1:56:15] is a resurrection and a Rapture amen
[1:56:17] amen let's stand together if we would
[1:56:25] amen we have a certainty not just of
[1:56:27] what's inside of us
[1:56:29] but that he's going to bring it out
[1:56:31] and I love that he put our names on that
[1:56:32] book amen
[1:56:34] they just didn't say you know God ties
[1:56:36] himself to things
[1:56:38] that's the beauty of it I think that's
[1:56:39] what makes him consistent is because he
[1:56:41] ties himself to it
[1:56:43] he doesn't leave it to well it might
[1:56:44] work and it might not work or it might
[1:56:46] go this way it might go that way so I'm
[1:56:47] going to wait and see how things turn
[1:56:49] out and then I'm going to choose the
[1:56:50] next step no no he ordains it from start
[1:56:52] to finish
[1:56:53] that's why it's a finished work that's
[1:56:55] why we can have rest in it is because
[1:56:57] nothing can change it it may wiggle
[1:56:59] around and try and get away but each
[1:57:00] each critical point he brings us back
[1:57:02] exactly to where we need to be and
[1:57:04] brings us back along the paths of Sons
[1:57:06] and Daughters of God Amen
[1:57:08] amen let's just bow our heads together
