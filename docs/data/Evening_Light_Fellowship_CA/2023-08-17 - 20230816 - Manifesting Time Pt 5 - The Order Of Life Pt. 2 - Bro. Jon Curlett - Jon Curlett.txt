secure us Lord by your word and your word alone or may we rest on that strong Foundation that Firm Foundation that can't be moved Lord and may we know it Lord that it's you that speaks Lord that it's you that's working in US Lord have your way now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ezekiel 36 again Ezekiel 36. amen good to be in the house of the Lord tonight a few missing I see but and then trusting that we've gathered into to hear his word amen and trust him to come on the scene and reveal himself a little more to us amen certainly want to keep praying for brother Bob and sister Brenda I spoke to him yesterday and they're still quite weak so uh we certainly want to keep remembering them trusting that they'll be well and good certainly by the weekend and into next week Lord willing amen Ezekiel 36 and 25 says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God Amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're going to continue on that title that we had last time and we're speaking on our series on manifesting time and and for a thought tonight we want to continue with this idea of the order of life and last service we spoke about the process of giving birth and we showed how that a human birth starts with a conception and it concludes with a functioning body that's born and it's delivered out of the mother and it's all part of a birth process but we tend to focus on when the baby comes out right rather than when the baby is conceived at the beginning amen we don't commemorate the time of conception but we commemorate the time when it actually is manifested as what happened nine months previous to that amen life started at conception but it's not a living Soul Brother Branham taught us and the scripture teaches us until it comes out of the mother and the Breath of Life is put into it then we talked about the calling of God and how it was before we ever did right or wrong like the scripture says that God said Esau have a Jacob have I loved and Esau if I hate it it said neither one of them having done any evil it says that the election of God might stand amen that the election of God might stand and so we know that it's a total work of Grace and it's a calling of God and that that word called the actual word is invited but it reminds me that it's like an invitation like when our parents call us for supper because the first time it's a it's an invitation and if you come right away then it's an invitation but if you don't come then there's a compulsion there's a compelling hand that says you better get to the supper right now because I'm serving supper and I'm not going to serve it to nobody there's got to be somebody to eat it and we remember in the in the parable of the wedding supper and and he said he sent them out into the highways and the byways and the ditches and the hedges and and that's where he went and he grabbed us and he didn't grab us the first time the first time he says I'm inviting you but then if we don't come easy then he grabs onto us and he says you're going to come by hook or by crook because I've got to fill my wedding house I've got to have somebody to eat this supper and we know it's the predestination of God it's the calling of God it's not just happenstance or any of these things but rather it shows the work of Grace because the people that that actually come into the wedding supper are nothing like the ones that were first invited and then looking at them naturally looking at them in the way they're born and the way they live in and of themselves there's nothing worthy to go into the wedding supper and yet he says I've got a place prepared I've got a meal prepared I've got garments prepared I've got Transportation prepared I have everything prepared for you to get all the way through you just have to say I'll take it now brother Bob had shared this quote with me earlier this week and in talking about the grace it says now remember that it was his grace and his mercy and that alone that gives you the only hope that you have he says no matter what you would ever do past present or future there is nothing nowhere that can anyways come near hear what Christ did for you amen we look at what he did and we look at the price that he paid even coming down from Glory coming down from glory to dwell in in flesh and Fallen Earth and dealing with sin the way that he had to and to be surrounded by that that took do you talk about Grace for for one to leave the Throne of Heaven to leave the portals of Heaven as the songs would say and to come down and dwell with Mankind and step into Fallen flesh the way that he had to boy you talk about Grace but then we talked about the in First Corinthians 6 that when God called you he automatically made a way he says not those that I called I Justified those that I Justified I Sanctified and those that I Sanctified I glorified amen but it's not just an invitation but it's an invitation where like I said like at the wedding supper he's provided the transportation he's provided the clothing he's provided the directions he's provided the food he's provided everything we have need of to get across the Finish Line in this walk that we call Christianity amen he's already made us acceptable to him he's already given us a robe of his righteousness of his will of his grace of his works and all of these different things and so it's just by grace that we have to say I'll take it I'll take it and we will walk into these things then we looked at justification and and how the truth of justification is that you didn't even sin in the first place brother Branham said at first he says now justification is as if you didn't and then the further on he went in his Revelation he got to the final place and he said she is perfect she never did it in the first place and I want to read a quote here he says I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house amen there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there we look at that idea of perfection say we've got to be perfect here no no you've got to be in his Perfection it's not your Perfection you're never going to have Perfection here the way that we look at his Perfection it's his robe of righteousness it's his Holiness that we put on it's his spirit it's his life that is the Perfection that he's seeking and we'll get into this more as we get into not the service tonight but in future Services what that Perfection looks like he said the Bible said so Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect he says it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come he says because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins amen what is our Perfection when the word has a perfect work when the word does what it's supposed to do when we let it have free reign in our life it says it washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word and amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated he he said this in 1965 20 days before he died she stands perfect virgin unadulterated he says she never sinned in the first place amen he says she was trapped into it now that's a hard thing for us to to even comprehend because we have memories of our failures you know some of us we have pictures of our failures we've got scars of our failures we've got physical and mental and emotional trauma that has been ingrained inside of us and we have all of these reminders of everything that we did wrong inside of us we don't need God to remind us we don't need Satan to remind us we have our own reminders we've got a memory we've got a conscience we've got all these things and all you have to do is go hang out someplace where you used to be drive by somewhere that you used to go do something and you'll remember those things and it reminds you that you're not perfect but Satan tries to bring those things up to get us off the idea that wrapped in his robe of righteousness under the blood of Jesus Christ we never even sinned in the first place amen so don't let your memories try and trap you don't let your the your conscience of things that are are in your past hold you because under the blood they never happened in the first place that's what we want to be reminded of here you know last service I talked about shame for a little bit and I said Christ came to take away our shame but let me tell you the only reason you even have shame is because you got an invitation to come up higher there are people walking around in the world doing things that you are perhaps ashamed of today and there is no shame in them because they don't even realize there's anything wrong with it the reason you can even feel shame in the first place is because you've come out of it you come to a higher plane you come to a higher calling you've stepped out from this human nature and you've stepped into a glorified nature you've stepped into a Godly nature and that's what gives you shame of what you were of what you did in these different things amen we were in the ditches and the hedges when he called us whether we like to think of it that way or not amen but it's because we got that invitation to a wedding supper that we realize hey I'm in a shameful condition now we look back in Revelations 3 this is the laity in church age it says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Raymond that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear he says in anoint thine eyes with ice have the thou mayest sea now this is the message to the final Gentile Church age these are the instructions to get out of here you want to know how to get out of here this is how you do it if you have shame then there's a remedy and he says the remedy is that you take the clothing that he's provided you take what he's provided you wrap that around yourself and your shame is gone what is it it's the robe of his righteousness which is his will which is his word which is his grace which is his provision which is his own Holiness and our message has been sent in this in this time to let us know how to get rid of our shame so the only thing that would hold us back from from not being from being pressed into that shame is that religious spirit of a laodicean because the laodicean spirit is I don't have need of anything I have everything I need of I'm rich and I'm increased of goods and I have need of nothing it's a religious spirit it's a prideful spirit it's a deceiving spirit that says I don't have to even listen to what's coming over the pulpit because that's for everybody else I'm just going to go in a rapture it's that Pitchfork religion that brother Steve Clark talked about where everything that comes over the pulpit you've got somebody else to land it on that's a religious spirit that's a laodicean spirit is when you can come to the house of God when you can read the word and there's never a correction applied listen the isab that he's talking about will make you see what you really are and it'll bring you to a place where you say I need something more than what I've got Proverbs said this he said Proverbs says this when Pride cometh then cometh shame shame comes when you don't accept the word of God because you'll find yourself down a road that you didn't even realize you're walking and you'll get so far down the road and all of a sudden hopefully by God's grace your eyes will come open and you'll say oh my goodness what was I thinking what was I doing what was I believing what kind of leadership was this that I was under because I'm so far away from the word of God and I've got such a far road back what is it pride takes us further down that road than we could ever imagine he says but with the lowly is wisdom amen God help us to walk into what he thinks about us what he sees in US rather than what we think about ourselves amen amen if we're standing still remember brother Brown said we're backsliding because God's always trying to bring us into a higher maturity always trying to grow us amen but it's that resistant proud stubborn attitude that says I'm fine right where I am I don't know about you I'm not happy where I am as in I'm not satisfied to stay here I'm thankful for what he's given I'm thankful for what he's done like brother Brown says about that color woman she says I know that I'm not what I used to be and I'm not what I'm supposed to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be I used to be something I'm supposed to be something and I'm somewhere in between but I'm glad at least I've moved away from what I used to be amen listen the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed and then that's our rest is that we believe in this word of God Amen and the only thing that's going to cause us to be shamed in the end is that we didn't heed the call and we didn't obey the word because he's going to say you had a witness in front of you this whole time this whole world has had a witness this whole world there's going to be no excuses in the end and the only shame will be that we see it and we don't do it we don't accept it we don't go the way that God says amen then we talked about sanctification I'm going to pick up there for just the first portion of this service to clarify what that is because justification says you didn't sin in the first place and then sanctification comes right behind and says yeah but you're still dirty and it's a bit of a paradox but it's the process of the working of God it's the order of eternal life and the the process of sanctification has to bring us to a realization that the way we're living is not in line with the word and the process of sanctification is to get our life cleaned up so that our the word is reflected in that portion of our life amen is to get those things out of our life that would hold back the presence or the indwelling of God brother Bob says this he says you never hear God say go back never go back go forward as long as you're in the line of duty now we've received justification and don't know what sanctification means it's the line of duty go forward if you're Sanctified and never received the Holy Ghost it's the line of duty go forward if you're sick and you can't get well you've done all the doctor told you to do and still you can't get well your line of duty is to go forward he says go forward speak to the people and then go forward just keep moving on Amen so that's why I said in this at the start of this series don't worry if you say brother John I feel like I'm at the beginning I've just been baptized I've just been Justified but my life still has a lot of cleaning up and needs to do don't worry about where you're at just worry that you're in the process as long as you're in the process you're okay because what he starts working he's going to finish her working so don't don't be worried if you're not to the Finish Line be worried if you haven't started if you haven't even started in this race if you haven't started in this process of coming to eternal life amen you're coming through it just keep moving forward don't get down because you're not maybe as far ahead as you think you are or thought you were but just hold on to where you're at and say Lord I want to keep moving forward from where I am don't go back to anything don't rest and say well this is as much as I've got no keep pressing forward talking about sanctification Paul said this to Timothy he said study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but Sean profane and vain bablings in other words look at what you're talking about remember we talked last last service about Paul said everything is lawful unto me but everything's not expedient watch what you're dwelling on and don't get uh caught up in things that have nothing to do with the word of God that have nothing to do with the gospel that have nothing to do with the kingdom of God that have nothing to do with your Eternal destination there are so many people including Believers that are caught up in the politics of the world in the economies of this world in the careers of this world and all of this mess that's here and it's a total trap of the devil don't get caught up in it because there's no coming out of it it's all got to burn if it's going to burn it ain't worth getting caught up in that's for sure he says for they will increase unto more ungodliness dropping down to verse 19 he says nevertheless the foundation of God stand is sure having this seal the Lord knoweth him that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ apart from iniquity in other words if you call yourself a Christian act like a Christian is what he's saying here if you take the name of Christian you better act like Christian and today that word that phrase has no meaning whatsoever to most people because you you look at what people call themselves Christians and you look at the the bandwidth of the the the difference between ones are on this side and that side and we have people that will go around dressed in no clothes cursing smoking drinking fornicating all these different things and call themselves a Christian and then you've got the true beliefs over here True Believers over here and they're living a completely different life Paul's saying if you take on the name of Christ you better Live the Life of Christ he says but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver remember in my father's house are many mansions he says there also of gold and silver also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor so there's a diversity of vessels there's a diversity of responsibilities there's a diversity of callings within the kingdom of God and that means some of us are placed low some of us are placed in the middle and some of us are placed high in terms of responsibility and there is a higher honor for those that are in higher responsibility but the other thing is there's a higher price to pay as well most of us would love to be like Paul or like Peter or like brother Branham or or one of these great Heroes of the faith but how many of us want to go through the trials and tribulations and testings that they went through to get there how many of us are willing to have a thorn in our flesh to get the revelations that Paul had to go out on the back side of the desert for years and years and years to let the Holy Spirit teach us to have to get knocked off of your horse in public and see everybody see you made a fool of in front of everybody that's what it takes how many of us would be willing to be crucified upside down like Peter this is the the the the level of character that's in these sorts of Heroes of the faith that's what's required to be there and God knows how to put it in but I'll tell you if you want to be a big shot in the kingdom of God you got to be ready to be humbled because that's the first thing he did to every one of them was he humbled them amen but watch this we're talking about sanctification he says if a man therefore Purge himself from these Purge himself justification is yours by faith through Grace you've gotta you've got to accept You've Got to Believe In the finished work of Calvary but now we're looking at sanctification you've got something to do here too you get to decide you get to act you get to choose Paul says to Timothy if a man therefore Purge himself from these things you purge it you say I don't want it in my life Lord this ought not to be here I'm walking away now you keep me away from it you make a choice every day of your life are you going to be Sanctified or are you going to be dirty he says he says if a man therefore Purge himself he shall be future tense a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use acceptable for the Master's use and prepared unto so it's a current process for future events you're being prepared Now for Something in the future prepared unto every good work amen notice he says if a man Purge himself sanctification is absolutely a work of the Holy Spirit by conviction by conviction you're not responsible for your ignorance but if he shows it in the word if it is shown here clearly that you not not to do it then the Holy Spirit working with you is going to say so don't do it stop doing it you've heard it so stop doing it and you get to make a choice there but it's under conviction now not under condemnation amen but you've got to decide to let things go remember brother Brandon would talk about spirits and he'd say if you love it too much God will never take it off of you you've got to decide I don't like it and you really got to not want it and sometimes that takes us getting to a place of great shame of Great Depression of great bondage even before we say this is overcoming me to the point where I can't even stand to live without it that means I got to get rid of it where we're so addicted to something we're so held by something we're so Bound by something we get into desperation and that's when God comes on the scene because we say I'm sick of this I'm sick of loving it I'm sick of needing it I'm sick of wanting it I'm sick of seeking it I need this out of my life and that's when the Holy Spirit can do a work to kick it out of your life but if you've invited it in if you've opened the door then he's not going to kick it out you got to start trying to kick it out before he'll move in today man but sanctification is where you get to your own thoughts and your own mind and you get to receive the word or you get to reject the word and if you'll just agree with the word mentally that's not going to do it but you're going to have to take it into your mind and now put it on your lips put it in your life and say now I want it to be in my life not just in my mind amen and when you do that God's not going to use you fully but God can use you in a Sanctified condition absolutely and we'll prove it by the scriptures as we go through this series amen but it's the work of the Holy Spirit preparing you for good work in the future which is your Kingdom Purpose which is God's will for your life he says flee also youthful us but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart the prophet of God will put this way he says the word Saint means the Sanctified ones in other words we must contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Sanctified ones sanctification means to be called out set apart cleansea cleansed and set apart for service now we're coming into this idea of adoption and we're getting into the mean of the message this evening because this is a working of the Holy Spirit but you do not yet have the Holy Spirit you can have an atmosphere of the Holy Spirit you can be surrounded by the Holy Spirit you can be in church services where the holy spirit is and it does a cleaning work on you but you do not yet have the Holy Spirit and literally your life can be Crystal Clean and yet you don't have the Holy Spirit but it's absolutely the supernatural working of the holy spirit in your life that's what does it it's the Holy Spirit working on you amen it's cleaned up by by conviction of the Holy Spirit and it's the training of the Holy Spirit that's doing it and it's God testing us to see what we'll do when he puts his word in front of us this is literally a portion of the tutoring of the holy spirit that we talk about in the adoption process it's telling you what's right and seeing if you'll do it seen if you'll obey it but after that we come to the and really these are these are things that happen within themselves sanctification and this new heart new spirit but that's what we've read at the start of this service this idea of a new heart and a new spirit he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you and heart of Flesh now the first bit he says is a new heart and the scripture is very clear about the difference between the old one and the new one the old one is Stony and the new one is fleshy now I don't know about you but when I compare flesh and stone there's a few things that stand out if I compare this to stone stone is way harder than flesh stone is not yielding Stone does not give it does not bend it is completely resistant to change or external Force it's unmoving it's very difficult to change and if you want to do anything with stone you need very heavy very powerful or very abrasive equipment when you're working with stone you can't go up there or it takes an awful lot of time you can stick a stone in a river for a thousand years and it'll smooth it out or you can put it under uh some sort of a Sandy mechanism and you can smooth it in 30 seconds but you need something very powerful very abrasive to work with stone but by contrast flesh is soft it's yielding when flesh goes up against stones stone winds every time doesn't it flesh is is easy to work with it's easy to manipulate our bone our body compared to muscle it's just not durable at all compared to Stone so this this heart that we have is something that can be worked with in other words that it's not resistant it's not stubborn it's not unmoving but it's something that God can work with and the prophet puts it this way he says so God had to give you a new heart not a patched up one a new heart and he says that's your intellect that you think with a new way of thinking he says then when he gave you a new way of thinking yes this is what it looks like yes that's right the Bible looks to be reasonable I used to didn't believe that I believe it now now there is your great Revival see they say yeah sure I don't want to go to hell I want to accept Christ that's all right that's good that's just your first step when you can agree with the word that just means you've got a new heart and we have turned that like I said before we can agree with the message and we think that we've got the Holy Ghost no that's just the work of a new heart potentially to look at it and say yeah that seems reasonable like he says and I want to do it that's a new heart that does it brother Branham said this is why there are so many people so many Christians wrecked on the side of the road is this spot right here now remember it's not Pitchfork religion today we want to look at our own lives here this is our messenger talking to us behold I send you Elijah he didn't come to the denominations he didn't come to the world that that's not believing he came to Believers so this is our message this is for us this is for you and I this evening amen this is our Elijah so let's not put it on somebody else in the Pew let's look at our own lives amen like I said know where you're at and keep pressing onward notice how this is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism of the holy spirit is not till the end of the new heart and the new spirit and then he says I'll put a new spirit within you but I want you to consider the way brother Brown talks about this he says if the Holy Spirit brooding over mankind that's already nothing but dust of the earth he says the holy spirit is the only one who can brood eternal life into you your intellectuality no matter how brilliant you may be is totally rejected by God your denominations means not that much to God and in the in the I took it out of here but he says he snaps like that says you're a great teacher of theology doesn't mean that to God it takes the brooding of the Holy Spirit to bring you into the fellowship of God to give you eternal life to raise you up at the last day he says accept a man be born of the spirit and water healing no wise enter in this idea of brooding is a key concept and brother Brandon would come to this over and over and over again because he's showing the work and the effect of the Holy Spirit as contrasted with the indwelling of the holy spirit amen you can't confuse the two the brooding is not the indwelling the brooding is the presence the anointing the atmosphere of God around us with us but that's the thing that brother Brown says you can have that on your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell because it's not in you but it's around you he says and the great Holy Spirit over the Earth as a mental picture he says we're going to make it like wings with his great Wings around the earth brooding making love cooing he's treating it like a bird like a head he says come come the father has ordained you come I'm coming to perform what the father's word has said he says it says soaking in I've come to manifest what the father has spoken brood he says and after a while it's a process of time don't look for immediacy there is a moment where you come to life but there's nine months before that and this is what he's saying there's a brooding there's something that's going on in the meantime he says and after a while there begin to come some petroleum moving across the earth a little bit of this and that and a little Easter Lily comes up in the Earth he says what brought it the Holy Spirit brooding then along Along come the Dahlia the Azalea and the other bushes then Along come the vegetation he says the Holy Spirit brooding everything was in there everything was in there but the presence of the Holy Spirit brings it to life this is absolutely key the presence of the Holy Spirit brings it up it brings out he says what the in the in the last verse quote he says I'm here to bring out what the father said so it's bringing out the word amen that went forth he says then Along come the vegetation come the trees the plant light then after a while birds begin to fly from the dust of the earth he says the Holy Spirit brooding them together and sent them into the air what causing the Earth to form into a bird and then Life coming into it and it flying away he says then Along Came the animal life the Holy Spirit brooding this was all remember script says and the and the spirit of the Lord the presence of the Lord moved across the face of the Earth that's what he's talking about the brooding the atmosphere that what is it it's the Holy Spirit going out from God to do the work of the word it's the power of the word amen listen we look at this and he's talking about plants he's talking about birds he's talking about trees none of those things had the Holy Spirit but the presence of the Holy Spirit has an effect even if you don't have a soul the presence of the Holy Spirit has an effect remember brother Branham he goes and he walks into that field with the bull that animal has no soul but the Holy Spirit had an effect on that animal that's how my that's how Adam even before he was in flesh he was leading them as the Holy Spirit leads up us brother Branham says by the spirit there was an effect there was an atmosphere amen what does the Holy Spirit do it's meant to produce the word of God it's the power of God to perform his word to manifest it that's what it's meant to do that's why we believe in anointed preaching because it's what the Holy Spirit bringing out what's inside of you that's why we believe in anointed song leaders in anointed musicians you can't just come up here because you have a gift to play you have to be anointed that's what makes the difference listen sister Maureen would say time and time again there are way better players than her 100 maybe not in this church but a hundred percent but I'll tell you she's got an anointing that very few ever have why because she's got the Holy Ghost that's the Difference Maker the Difference Maker is not the gift the Difference Maker is not the gift the Difference Maker is when the gift is yielded to the Holy Spirit not to money not to influence not not to some desire not to some program but to the Holy Spirit to use you for his purpose to do what to bring out the word the very things of God that are inside of us that worship leads us into the presence of God and that is in and of itself a holy spirit an anointing movement that brings us into those things amen even people that don't even know they're a child of God can come into that presence and they realize they're in something different because it has an effect everything responds to the Holy Spirit some can't take it and some love it and they don't even know what it is because they get arrest they get a piece they get an energy from it whatever it might be people have all sorts of things for it they talk about it they talk about you have an energy about you they talk about you have a light around you all these different things I've heard it all and what is it it's the Holy Spirit on you there's a presence there's an anointing that surrounds us as we walk through this world today but brother Brandon would say he says it's not just in this earth he says it's in this earth the Holy Spirit Broods over this Earth and he says the holy spirit is brooding with this new heart and this new spirit it's brooding over you to produce the very thing inside of you just like he did with the Earth back in Genesis 1. what is it it's just like we talked about in adoption the tutor is bringing out what's in the Sun and he's in the presence of the Tudor he's not in the presence of the father he's in the presence of the Tudor and the tutor is bringing out what's in him good or bad because that's what student is bringing forth whatever's inside that's the work of the holy spirit amen what is it it's to show what's already inside the earth human flesh by the word of God what I have in here is by the word of God before the foundation of the world and it's the work of the Holy Spirit to bring it out listen to this he says if you won't accept righteousness then unrighteousness will take over if you won't receive Christ the world will take you you can't go out that door the same person you were coming in here you can't be he says the Holy Spirit brooding wooing calling he says oh if you'll come I'll take away that Stony heart see sanctification church is about surrender sanctification is about laying down your rights remember laodicea means people's rights I don't have to do it I like this I like that I believe this I believe that no no no no sanctification is about surrender to what the word says and that alone that alone you're not surrendering to the pastor you're not surrendering to the preacher you're not surrendering to Mom and Dada you're surrendering to the word amen and the Holy Spirit will lead you to the word every time he says oh if you'll come I'll take away that Stony heart if you'll come I'll place a new spirit in you and if you'll come I will come into this new spirit see you've got to choose you've got to surrender you've got to make a choice he says then when the Devil comes back what does he find he says he finds his old Tin Can Alley God sent his big bulldozer down and cut the thing all the pieces bulldozed it up and scraped it all off and a Hallelujah Avenue is built there it ain't the same place there's a big modern home built there he says the Holy Spirit has brooded big beautiful flowers of Salvation standing up where once was dirt and filth and garbage things rattling around nobody wanted to be in your life he says now there's big beautiful flowers of Salvation standing up you don't have to try to impersonate anything it's a new heart it's a new dwelling place it's a new spirit he says everything is new it's a beautiful picture isn't it it's eaten all over again it's a garden of God and the thing is that sometimes it doesn't look like anything's happening you ever look at a new build when they've got a property and they're going to put a house on it somebody's bought it somebody's paid for it they've got the plans approved they've got the permits approved but you don't see anything of that going on all you see is that that land is supposed to be turned into a house and you don't see all the work that's going on in the background and then what happens is in a day what happens a bulldozer comes in and he levels all the trees he flattens it out next day a backhoe comes in and he digs out the foundation the next day they're pouring the foundation and then the next day after that they get they wait a couple days then they start framing it out we've got one going up by our house in a week they've got a house completely framed from nothing to house in a week but the thing is we didn't see all that work that was going in behind the ground behind the back that's the way it is with us sometimes we're looking we're saying nothing's happening like in the Garden of Eden when the Holy Spirit was brooding over it those plants were growing before they ever came out and if you are watching you'd say nothing's happening that kid's been in services for seven years and nothing's happening no no no just trust the brooding of the Holy Spirit it'll bring forth its thing in its own season and in its own time God's got a time for each and every one of them amen but you get that new heart and all of a sudden brother Brown says it's a different way of thinking and all of a sudden the word starts to make sense it starts to sound right it starts to resonate inside of us right the things of God start to have an attraction to you you're drawn to these things and and you start to say hey that that seems like something I'm really interested in and that starts to move you now into a change inside of your life but then after that he says then he said after that then I'll give you a new spirit so your thoughts are changing you're open to the word you're open to leadership you're open to change you're open to letting go you're open to surrender then he said after that then I'll give you a new spirit what's that he says a new desire I want to do right that's a great evidence that God's working in your life you at least want it you got to want it before you do it if you don't want it you're never going to do it but if you're at least wanting it and not doing it hey at least you're in the race amen he says a new desire but watch what he says now he says now I know I'm a Christian I'll smoke one more and then I'll throw it away see and I'll just see I'll just stay home tonight you know I'll just he says all these little just just that's exactly he says Eve stopped just for a moment that's all she had to do notice he said the old Spirit was just one more just this just that I'll put it off a day I'll put it off a week I won't go to church I won't do this I won't do that it was always able to just slide away from making that right decision knowing it's right but the desire isn't really there yet he says then he gives you a new desire the human nature is that you keep kicking your decisions down the road why because it's going to hurt giving up cigarettes is going to hurt giving up drinking is going to hurt giving up movies is going to have given up friendships whatever it is that's in your life it's all going to hurt amen but he says the new spirit is a new desire and that's what changes things it's not knowing what's right and wrong but it's wanting to do what's right and what's wrong lots of people have an intellectual conception of things that are right and wrong but they don't do them and there's no desire in them why because they don't have a new spirit and I'm talking even within this world not much less inside the church amen but he says this new spirit is a desire to do them not just to know them I mean not just to sit in church and not head at what's coming over the pulpit but a desire in you to go live it to put it into action amen you go make a decision that's a hundred percent according to the word and Watch What Happens you're going to face opposition somebody's going to get mad somebody's going to offend it somebody's going to leave somebody's going to stop talking to you somebody's gonna not like it because everything in this world is contrary to the word everything is contrary to the word amen everything every societal thought every human inclination is anti-word you start to do things right it's going to cause pain it's going to cause discomfort it's going to cause separation that's what the word does is it separates us from the world and guess what you need a new spirit to help you push through the pain to do the right thing amen this gospel isn't meant to be just spoken over a Pulpit or reading a book it's meant to be lived the gospel is a way of life not a way of talk I mean that's what we're supposed to be doing everything remember what the angel told John in Revelation 10 he says it's sweet in the mouth but it's bitter in the belly and you need a new spirit to help you get to the bitter belly part because you've got to eat it you've got to become a part of you amen your old spirit will refuse it it'll say one more cigarette one one more service I won't go to whatever the case might be these are brother bradham's words not mine right but the new spirit will accept it knowing that it's not going to sit very well knowing that it's going to be a difficult thing to deal with he says he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit is in God's spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you when you see God working on a person brother Brown says they'll be more gentle and they'll settle down you know what does that humility because you realize I ain't such a big fish that's all you realize I got a lot of work to do that in the the view in the mirror of the scripture I'm a little nothing and so it humbles us and we get a little more gentle and we settle down he says so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in I'll give you a new spirit it's the working of the Holy Spirit he says then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right when he means entertain like entertaining somebody in your home you can have somebody in your home he says you can have him in your home you can have him in your life once he cleans you up properly you get a new spirit and the things that that bothered you and tainted your life and cause you shame and anger and hurt start to Fall Away you start to let grudges go you start to let bygones be bygones you start to let these habits drop away and then you're open to change you're open to leadership you're you're open to worship you're open to expressing what you hear rather than just nodding your head to what you hear amen condemnation under this turns to conviction where you don't walk away because you're upset or because you're hurt or you're offended but you step into it because you know that when he says it there's always a remedy to bring you to it that when he sets that requirement when he sets that word before you he has a way made already for you to produce what he says is in you right condemnation goes out the door amen what you start to breathe some fresh air you ever notice maybe this is just me but you know in the summer on the few days when it gets so hot that you have to turn your air conditioning on your car and turn the recirculation fan on so that there's no outside air coming in and so it's just the same error over again what you don't realize is it gets stale after a while and all you have to do is hit that restart button and turn it off and in about five seconds you'll get just this and you're like oh my goodness I was in stale air this whole time that fresh air coming in try it everybody's going to try it now but that's what this is like is you start to realize there's a freshness there's a newness of life there's a freedom that you had no idea was there and not only that but you want to be in it even if it's not easy it's a new desire inside of you amen you're starting to realize that life is more than just jobs vacations relationships money cars whatever it is sports you're realizing there's more to this than just a Daily Grind and then we die he says you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you get a new spirit you quit your line you get a new spirit listen to this you can do most anything with that spirit but that isn't what God's talking about that's one of the most powerful things I think he's ever said when it comes to the difference between the Holy Spirit and the new spirit he says you can do almost anything with that Spirit but that's not what God's talking about he says a new spirit he said I'll give you now watch I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit why he'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him while you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you had you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate with the next man on the next corner you couldn't associate with these Christians while you'd have an awful you'd you'd have had an awful spirit so he has to give you a new spirit I'll give you a new heart a new spirit now watch and I'll put my spirit in you there's the difference he says I'll put my spirit in you he says and that's where you find it so hard that you go down to church and you get a different concept you know what I believe I ought to go to church then you go back home and say hallelujah I got it no you haven't then you go down to church and you say oh I believe that something's happened I don't look at things the way I used to Hallelujah he says in a few days you find yourself right down into the same old Route you were doubting reasoning and everything else he says well now a pastor so-and-so said that wasn't right I don't believe it's right I'll just take his word for it and I'll tell you I'm going to do this and do that and you find yourself up and down in and out he says see you just didn't go far enough you want an Evidence you don't have the Holy Ghost it's the ups and downs and in and outs it's a lack of an overcoming life where you take the word that's coming over the pulpit but you don't have the power to make it live he says you can have a new heart and a new spirit and that's a working of the Holy Ghost but you don't have the Holy Ghost yet you quit this you quit that but he says that's not it that's not what we're talking about now listen to this he says oh you say brother Branham I got all the evidences he says I know but we're not talking about evidences we're talking about the product we're talking about the product that's right yes sir I've seen Heathen show watch how he frames it I've seen them speak with tongues I've seen them lay down a pencil and write in unknown tongues and a witch raise up and read it interpret it and tell the truth if a man could speak with tongues if a man could shout if a man could see Visions if a man could do any of these other things that he can do without Divine love they are lost he says that's right in other words he says every evidence that you've got they've got and they're heathens the prophet of God went around the world seven times he's seen it all he's seen demonic power he's seen witches he's seen all of these different things and he says every evidence that you guys are claiming he says I've seen heathens do it that declare nothing of Christianity that absolutely do not have the Holy Ghost do not believe the word of God he says and they shout they speak with tongues they they see Visions they interpret they do all of these different things he says every evidence you've got they've got and yet they don't have Divine love so he said how can that be evidence he says the product is what matters the evidence is not enough evidence is he said Christ is in the heart see so don't be deceived by signs and evidences there's all kinds of signs the Bible said in the last days false prophets would rise up and show such signs it would deceive the very elective possible he says come back to the Bible signs now notice I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit notice the new heart is right in the middle of you and the new spirit is put in the middle of your new heart and his spirit is put right in the middle of the new spirit so I read all of that and the prophet is putting up a sign that's saying don't stop with the cleaned up life don't stop with speaking in tongues don't stop with having these gifts or manifestations he's saying go back to what the Bible says about what the true sign is of a holy ghost filled believer don't stop because you're not drinking anymore don't stop because you agree with the pastor those are all great things be joyful of it but we're not talking about evidences evidences he says we're talking about the product now I want to spend some time on this because here's the thing we all want to believe we've got the Holy Ghost we all want to believe we're right with God we all want to say we've been changed and we've had a new birth and we're real Believers that's good we ought to be able that's something we ought to want but the human condition is to seek that which confirms what we believe rather than looking at all of the evidence and brother Brown says that's the problem is you chose evidences rather than all of the evidence you're looking at one thing rather than the whole thing you're looking at one thing and saying that makes me a Christian rather than looking at everything and saying is this Christian because the goal is not to have evidences the goal is to be Christ the Hebrews 13 8 is our message amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so we don't want to go around trying to find evidences but we want to see Christ inside of us you know when I when I was speaking last service and I spoke about the watches and it struck me as I was just dwelling on this and studying you look at all those pieces of that watch and if you put them all together and you close that watch up and it has a see-through backing like a lot of them do or even a see-through front you'd say that watch has all of the evidence of being a watch but without the mainspring the product's no good it has every evidence but it doesn't have a power it has every part except the thing that makes it a watch a Christian has Christ not evidences and brother Brown says you've taken the evidences rather than the Christ you've taken one portion rather than the the satisfying portion which is himself ever ever you know you look at this watch and that could be sitting there and maybe you go into a into a store and it's a used watch and everything looks great and the only question you have to ask is but will it keep time because what makes it a watch is that it tells time not that it has the parts of a watch the parts of awat don't make it a watch what makes it a watch is that it can tell time and that it can tell time accurately what makes us a Christian is not that we have the parts of the Christian it's that the parts of a Christian work together to make us christ-like amen you ever drive a car I'm a car guy you ever get in a car look good on the outside it has four wheels has a steering wheel paint looks good nothing seems completely off and then you get in you turn it on you drive in it seems like all of the parts are just flying in close formation but not touching each other where the car just doesn't seem to work right where it seems like the transmission is clunky and the engine doesn't respond and you go around a corner and it just almost flops over on itself and it's shuttering in that it's got all the parts of a car but when you actually try and use it as a car it's not a good car that's the difference between evidences and product and you'll find that when you get into a bad car they're selling you on the features rather than the function and that's what he's saying he says you focused as Christians on the features of a Christian rather than your function as a Christian he says the evidences are fine but what's the product of all those evidences what is the life that's behind it what is the end result is it evidences or is it an eternal life is it reading your Bible or is it living your Bible because a Christian reads his Bible but if you don't live it then what does that make you a hypocrite for now certainly not filled with the Holy Ghost amen he says you've forgotten about the you you've forgotten the real goal to be Christ not to just check off a bunch of lists things on the list that say I'm a Christian the goal is not to have evidences the goal is to represent Christ to be Christ in all of these different things to have what the authority of the word acting in every part of our life that's what makes us christ-like really the evidences are supposed to come from us we're not supposed to bolt them on remember brother Brown says a sheep Bears wool it doesn't manufacture it and it doesn't add it it just doesn't the evidences are a product of Christ in US rather than a precursor it's Christ coming out of us rather than us bolting them on you see these guys again carving they go around and they got a car and they want to make it look fast what do they do put a big wing on it and they put a loud exhaust on it and you know what it makes it slower and it makes it less efficient but it looks fast and that's all they're interesting is looking fast not being fast that's the problem with evidence is it makes you look like a Christian without letting you be a Christian evidence are just gifts the prophet said and he said the heathens have them just as much as Christians do and he said every one of them could be reproduced without the holy spirit so he says they weren't definitely the right product and he says they're not even the right evidences that's why they latched on to to speaking in tongues speaking in tongues are so simple you get up there and go and they say you got the Holy Ghost and you're going in that's easy we love easy we love simple we love a quick check mark and speaking in tongues was the easiest check mark you could get because you don't even have to be able to do it you can just mimic speaking in tongues and they'll tell you now you'll know but nobody else will you can look like a Christian a holy ghost-filled Christian just because you're mimicking the way people speak in tongues they do it all the time it's easy but it's not scriptural I'm going to close with a long quote and a short quote because I want to just wrap this up the way the prophet brought it to us listen questions and answers he says this is the question they said do you believe that God gives the Holy Spirit to everyone that is truly a born-again Christian at the time they accept salvation or you do you believe that this is a different work of Grace that in the experience of most Christians comes later that's a great question he says now Christian friend a person cannot be born again until they have received the Holy Spirit period he says see you can't you are not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost he says I'm not saying you're lost before you receive the Holy Ghost because you're not he says there is one work of Grace only one work of Grace and that's the Holy Spirit now I'm going to jump just interject another quote here because I want to make a clarification it's a big clarification because we've been talking time and time again about the difference of the working of the Holy Spirit as opposed to the indwelling or the baptism of the Holy Spirit I want to do this because brother Bradham makes a big deal of this this thought right here and I wanted to put it in in he says it better in a different place and so I wanted to inject it here before we continue with the original quote he says now then there was justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost not three different dispensations not three works of Grace but one work in different manifestations he says the same Holy Spirit was with Luther under justification was under Wesley with sanctification is in the church now in the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says it's the same Holy Spirit not two Holy Spirit certainly not three it's the same Holy Spirit he's saying what happened in the previous Church Ages was the Holy Spirit working and moving and it's the same Holy Spirit that's given today but what was with them is in US there's a working and then there's an indwelling because remember Martin Luther he drank he smoked he cussed he was an anti-semite he hated Jews that wasn't a holy ghost-filled man but he had a portion he had a working that was there now brother Bram jumps right back to this he says just like there's one God and three manifestations Father Son and Holy Spirit one God he says only one now there is one work of Grace but three manifestations there's a manifestation of justification by faith a man believes God says yes sir I believe that I believe there's a true God and now for my personal savior I accept Jesus Christ his son is my personal savior now that's what's called justification by face faith which the disciples receive first see we look at the the upper room is the holy as the only work in the whole in the disciples but he says no no they received this first he says now the next thing is this man will go out and today he might Smoke Drink curse do things that it's that his habits is hanging on to him it's just rooted in there he says it's Spirits habits are spirits the Bible said they're unclean spirits in men now maybe he's lost well for instance men sometimes especially men become lustful sex maniacs and not only that but just lustful the way women dress in things today no wonder they are but the woman becomes the same way lustful Spirits get on them and they're nice little ladies and they put on short clothes and little bitty things around them that looks terrible and they get out why they don't want to be bad but they don't realize that that old passion demon spirit is working on them what's he pointing to Original Sin this is the original demon this is the original possession he says they don't do that to appear before God listen in the Bible times taking your clothes off was a sign of demon possession and today it's a sign of normalcy in the world taking your clothes off is not normal it's never been normal except under the influence of Satan he says Mary Magdalene didn't realize the spirits that was on her see well now when you get that kind of a spirit on you or men you get out there and start lusting for women you say well it's human nature he says not like that he says see no it's a spirit the Bible said it was a spirit that's right so the thing to do then the blood of Jesus cleanses you from lust and passion that's called sanctification the word sanctification means to be cleaned and set aside for service he says now that lust Spirit leaves you under sanctification because remember the house has to be cleaned out before he can come in now remember it has no power over you except you give it amen the word exposes it for what it is and then you say I want it or I don't and if you want it it stays and if you don't want it then the word will put it out and the Holy Spirit will do that work it's a working of the holy spirit in sanctification to clean you out he says let a little lady nice go to church she sings in the choir but she has to mower grass with a little pair of shorts on I know I'm not speaking to the choir here today all right but just consider this thought let her get Sanctified one time and let her put on a pair he's saying she won't do it see let that man that'll almost have a wreck looking at that woman in the yard let him get Sanctified one time and go down the street he'll keep his mind on what he's doing Sanctified not filled with the Holy Ghost sanctify will do this he says that's exactly right if he gazes sideways he'll turn his head this way the holy spirit says turn your head brother Graham would say the first look that that's okay he says but if you look again that's the problem you can't help what you see you don't know what's coming your way but if you keep looking at it that's on you he says the holy spirit says turn away now are you going to do it or are you not he says that's it that sanctification notice the Holy Spirit working with him in sanctification he does not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and yet he's turning his head he says now in this person that's been called by God there's manifestations of gifts and he's pointing to the final work he's pointing to adoption he's pointing to the infilling of the Holy Spirit and he says you're here for a purpose and that purpose is to manifest the gift of God in your life but it's not always a gift of tongues or interpretation of these different things but there's a word that's coming out of you that God placed in there and he says that's going to come out in the end that's what the indwelling of God is supposed to do it's supposed to bring out whatever that gift is inside of you he says now a very dear friend of mine Endeavor the other day was discussing this we with me that used to be here and preach in the city very fine man as far as I know but you see he was in Nazarene he thought that sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which it is not there's no scripture to show that I'll prove that in a little bit by the Bible see that it isn't you're not sealed by sanctification you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit now listen to this a ceiling is the completing of the work a ceiling is the completing of the work we're going to get into this with adoption this is a game-changing statement a ceiling is a completing of the work so that means that it comes at the end not at the beginning you don't start with the Holy Ghost and get adopted you get the Holy Ghost as your adoption because it's a finished work it's a ceiling of something that's already done he says that's the reason it couldn't be sealed under Luther Wesley either one it had to come to the baptism before the church was sealed away till the day of redemption you see he says now oh no they're not lost they're saved certainly they are now sanctification is the same work of Grace that saved you Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him he says so it's the holy spirit all along but that's a portion of the Holy Spirit he says this is a greater portion of the Holy Spirit and then when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the completion of the Holy Spirit taking up its Abode in you to manifest with gifts speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of power wisdom knowledge and understand and there's a lot more to that as we're going to get into it in a much much further down the road but he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the completion justification that's a portion of the working sanctification it's a portion of the workingness the holy spirit all through it he says but in the end you get the Holy Spirit rather than just it working with you see it's the holy spirit all along it's a portion absolutely why because it's the word being brought out that's what the Holy Spirit does is it's bringing out what's inside of us it's the seed of God and you coming to life and it's matching what God said it should be It's Supernatural and it's the Holy Spirit brooding over our lives creating an atmosphere for change for cleansing for accepting for surrendering all of these different things amen but the prophet reminds us of the baptism the Holy Spirit the indwelling is a seal it's a ceiling of a completed work it's a sign that everything in there has been said in order and it's been done right it's a sign that it's acceptable and it's bound for eternity now remember the sealing of the holy spirit is what in the soul because that's what's eternal that's what's Eternal it's not the body that's doing the body's still going to be a fight but amen there's a greater life than just living clean and and talking clean and attending church so the prophet's saying there's more to it than just not drinking and not smoking and coming to church he says that's not it that's good that's a portion of it but that's not the completion of it there's far more than that listen to this this is our closing our closing quote he says God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of Christ well accepted and espoused and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God will be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord that's what we're supposed to look like that's to come up a little higher that's what adoption looks like he says it should live in that characteristic in the church and it should be living that way but we find out that many times that with good intentions that people are trying to make themselves act like Christians they're trying to say well I am thus and I must live this way now if the church could only not look at it in that way this can't be about a must brother Brian would say when you get the Holy Ghost your very desires have changed it's no more he says you have no more conscience of sin there's nothing in you that has a desire for sin so you don't have to force now your body that's a fight that's a fight that's always going to be a fight but in the Inner Man in the inner woman it ain't a fight it's done it's sealed hey the battle's over there the victory's been won you know what you believe and that means you'll fight to be what you believe he says God never intended Christianity to be governed by denominations neither by Creeds listen Creeds alone make us legalists that's all Creeds do is they make us legalists that's a that's when we get the I must rather than the I am because Creed say You must whereas Christ in US says I am that's Hebrews 13 8. God only allowed or intended for the church to be governed and carried on by Creeds and denominate Nations and intellectuals he says then we do not need the holy spirit in the church it's success would largely be largely placed upon the intellectuals of the best of us then what would be our church would have he says that will be what our church would have the better intellectuals we would have in our church the more Progressive our church would be and guess what that's that's what the world has today I'm not convinced they're intellectuals but they look for the greatest of this and the greatest of that and none of them are looking for the actual Holy Spirit they're not looking for Christ himself living through a man they're just picking the best one the one that has the greatest Vision the greatest programs the greatest speaking ability the best looks the best combination of all of those things ideally he says that's not the way it's meant to be he says but in the word in the word I find that God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by any Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ and I think in doing that with that in mind and in God's program we will never be successful no matter how good our intentions are until we get back into the center of God's program where the Holy Spirit controls amen God bless you let's stand this evening what is it he's saying we need to get back to the original word we need to get back to the original life we need to get back to the original Power he says we need to get back to our eating condition where we walk with God and we talk with God and we're in that Eternal relationship with him he says what we ought to be he says we ought to be walking in it our characteristic ought to be that we're walking with God walking according to the word amen amen I hope you know preaching things like this and maybe there's some of us are saying you know what I'm not as far ahead as I thought and that's not an easy thing to hear sometimes but the idea is like I said are you moving or are you standing still as long as you're moving thank God for it and keep moving amen but the point of this is is we've got to get to a place where we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we've got the Holy Ghost that that's the game changer brother Brown says that's what makes the difference when you have it and when you know you've got it because when you know you've got it then there's things that he can do with you in ways that he can use you that he's never been able to do before amen but we've got to go through the process there's no jumping there's no skipping you know what we look in scriptures and this is one of the the the the hard points of scriptures that we look at it and we see and scripture doesn't record the day to day it records the highs and it records the lows but it doesn't say that brother Joshua went to work for three years and then you know what it does in some cases it says that that's that Samson ruled for 20 years and judged and then we hear all of the bad stuff he did and then we hear the mighty Victory we only hear the high points and the low points and we think that our life has to be high points all the time no no no no brother bam talked about that humble Victorious Christian walk we ain't all walking around raising the dead day in and day out if we did that the world would know who we were and this church would be full and we'd have to put the old pews back and we'd probably have to get a newer building a bigger building that's not what it's about but see we think that this adoption is going to make us walk around doing Mighty works all the time no no no you'll see that he wants you doing right what you're doing right where you are but you'll be anointed to do it and you'll know you're anointed to do it and when you know you're anointed to do it you'll do it differently and you'll realize what's given to you in everything that you're doing because you've been positionally placed by Christ to be right where you are doing right where you are whether it's a housewife at home whether it's a a young sister at work whether it's a father at work whether it's a minister Deacon whatever it is when you're positionally placed there and you're anointed to do it it's a game changer and you realize that you've got Authority in every one of those places that God has put you to what use the word to produce the Kingdom Purpose that he's placed inside of you amen amen we're going somewhere and then we're going somewhere let's stay on the road let's keep moving forward let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're on a journey Lord and maybe I'm behind some or maybe I'm ahead of some but Lord all I want to do is keep moving on Lord and I believe you're calling each one of us higher Lord I believe you're calling us away from this world Lord I believe there's a separation that's going on Lord I believe you've started it and I believe there's going to come a greater separation Lord I pray you help us surrender Lord humble ourselves Lord that our desires will be wedded by the word that we we read and listen to day in and day out Lord that we would feed that inner man Lord that that new heart and that new spirit Lord and even your spirit Lord will be feeding on the right things Lord that it would be putting painting a picture Lord an image of what you saw before us Lord what you saw of us before the foundation of the world Lord let us keep that in our minds let us keep that in our mouths let us keep that in our hearts Lord that that great thought Lord that great word attribute of God that you've placed inside of us Lord let us press towards that Mark let us press towards that prize of the High Calling of Jesus Christ Lord lift up our eyes a little higher Lord may US rest let us rest Lord in the fact that you're the one that does all things well Lord bless us now we pray Lord be with us we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen yes I know 4 38 Come Ye sinners sorry I don't know the 438 Come Ye sing ERS lost and hopeless Jesus blood can make you free for he saved the
