God's blood that fell down from Calvary Lord it was your body that was broken and bruised for us heavenly father and you paid a great price for us Lord and we're here as tokens of that Grace this

hearer equally Heavenly Father Lord that each one of us Lord would be subject to your presence to your word Lord that you would just encourage us strengthen us correct us Lord draw us closer to you Lord whatever our need is Lord you know all things Lord I pray you speak now in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen and amen God bless you amen turn if you would to Genesis chapter 2 Genesis 2 amen greet each one here tonight and amen it's a wonderful weekend this is the weekend that matters most of all for all believers amen amen he had to die but he had to rise again and tonight we're in commemoration of his death but every day ought to be a commemoration of his of his res resurrection of his raising up of the power of the holy spirit in the believer's life amen so we don't want to just remember it today and through the weekend but let every day be a a commemoration amen of the great work that was done at Calvary and then we certainly want to remember the family for brother Ian Brenton brother AB sister Olive brother Barry sister Darlene sister Leah brother Chad and the different ones that are out there and uh the funeral should be sometime this coming week Lord willing and we'll share those details as we get them but just remember them and in prayer as well they wanted me to mention that there's Refreshments after service for those that want to and can stay so uh don't rush out too quickly amen Genesis 2 verse1 15 says and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die amen God bless you you can have your seat and not a very warm scripture that we open up with amen but it's not a very warm thing that put Christ on the cross and this is where we see God lay down the law so to speak but I just want to take a little minseries this weekend from what we've been preaching on and I guess everything really plays into it but when brother Andrew do was here he he talked about the fullness of the atonement and that stuck with me ever since and just been dwelling on it and studying on it a bit and so I thought this would be the best time to maybe bring it and and just see what the Lord will do with it and it's just services and when it comes to the atonement everything is under the atonement we'll see that the seven seal book is under the atonement and all these things and we'll only go so far with it this weekend but I just want to dwell on that this this weekend and I want to take a title tonight of a price required and a price paid amen and we know uh what happened in in the Garden of Eden and Adam's wife was seduced and she was tricked and she did what God said not to do and I'm not going to dwell on sin a lot this evening I think we know enough about Sin we we know the effect of that but I want you to see that the first thing that happened as soon as they transgressed God's word Was Fear set in and fear separated them from God God did not separate himself from them they separated themselves from God Amen and the scripture says that we do not have a spirit of fear if you're scared to approach God tonight that is not the spirit of this age that is not the spirit of the Bride that's not the spirit of the believer that Spirit has been thoroughly conquered at Calvary amen we do not need to be under spirit of fear we don't have to wonder if he will accept us we don't have to wonder if he's looking for us if he wants us to be in his presence that has been completely dispelled and even in a time of sin God did not turn them away immediately he went looking for them amen amen but we see that what happens here is that Adam partook and Eve was tricked but Adam did it willingly Adam knew what he was doing and there was a transgression in there and we see that what happened after that is man just dropped into an abys and he just went further and further away from God and he dropped deeper and deeper into unbelief and deeper and deeper into sin and he turned into a beast because a man without God is a beast that's what he turns into he goes back to that satanic nature rather than the god nature because the god nature is what makes us human it's a satanic nature that makes us Fallen amen and so we see what happens here is that man degraded to a point and we see it even with Noah that he degraded to a point that the scripture says that the every thought of his mind was evil continually there was no good in it but this was the starting point of it the starting point of it was when God said don't do something and they went and they did it and we know what happened in in Genesis and what God Said there the consequence of it and he said but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die God declared in this verse that they would die the day that it happened amen and there was a price that would have to be paid and God said death's the price but we look at death as as as loss of breath and loss of life but death is not that death is separation from God because what happens and we'll see that God has to fulfill his word so there's a natural death but there's a Supernatural death that happens and that Supernatural death comes by separation from God and so God said the day that you do this is the day that you have to separate from me and they couldn't even comprehend that they couldn't even comprehend what death meant because death did not exist at that time sin did not exist God said don't do something and they couldn't even comprehend the effects of it cuz life was so perfect back then there was no there was no shame there was no fear there was no worry there was none of these things but God's word have been declared and he says the day you do it is the day that you're separated from me that's the day that you're going to die and we see though that God is gracious because after they sin what happens they recognize they're naked and what do they do they hide from God there's fear there and there's worry and there's anxiety and they hide from from God but the grace of God comes through the garden and he's saying Adam Where Art Thou because when he came down in the cool of the evening brother Brandon would say he would sit there and he would lay their heads in his lap and he would calm then he would soothe them as they went to sleep each night and God came down to soothe them and all of a sudden they weren't there to be soothed but the grace of God said I'm still seeking even when you don't deserve it even when you broken my word you transgressed my word god came and he said where are you Adam and finally he called long enough that Adam said I'm here but I'm scared I'm scared why are you scared Adam because I'm naked I'm not fit to be in your presence the way I am the way you made me now is no longer good and God said who told you you're naked you've been naked all along but what made you to unfit for my presence Adam what changed church if there's something we ought to know today it's that sin takes us further than we ever anticipated they had no idea what they were in for and sometimes I think as children of God we think that we'll get away with it because we're children of God it's because we're children of God that we don't get away with it because he holds us accountable to his word in the good and in the bad amen and we see what happens the deeper effects of sin and we step away from the protection of the word what does it do it opens us up to everything that Satan has for us you know I was talking to my wife about this just this week and I you know we look at people that have left the message and some of them just go back to religion and they're sad but you know what most do is they go back to Beast nature they don't even have that cloak of religion and I told her I I ran across a young lady and it was it was suggested as a friend on my Facebook and I looked at that and I said I don't recognize that person the ne the last name's right but who is that person and I realized she was a daughter of a family that had left this message about 10 years ago and I clicked on her profile and the pictures that I saw of her there she would look like a prostitute and she was happy and proud to be that way that poor young lady had no idea what she was going to turn into when her parents walked away from this message another young sister walked away and within a year she was pregnant out of wedlock had a baby the father left and then a couple years later another man did it to her and now she sits there today with two young children and no fathers around another married a young woman and was divorced within a year this is what happens when we get out from under it why did they go that route church because Satan showed them the pleasure of that decision but he never showed them the consequences of the decision because remember what the scripture says to Eve it says and when she saw that it was pleasurable when she was convinced that it was good she tried to get somebody else to do it and that's what happens you'll find when people leave the word is they'll tell you of the pleasures they have because it's too soon for the Harvest to be shown but Satan will never tell you the Harvest that's coming down the road when you leave the protection of the word they were seduced to make a decision based on how it was going to feel rather than what it was going to produce amen Satan tells us it's pleasurable and he is right it is pleasurable for a season you know the scripture says that Moses rejected the pleasures of Egypt for a season while choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of the children of Israel because that was his place that's where he knew that he was supposed to be but somebody always has to pay a price someone always has to pay a price and we'll find as we go through this today you know who pays the price those who did no wrong the innocent pay the price of the guilty every single time parents when we step out of line who pays the price most our children right the ministry when we step out of line who pays the most the congregation the innocent suffer for the guilt of the ones that did it in the first place amen the innocent always suffer but we see in Galatians 6 Paul would say be not deceived God is Not mocked in other words God will not be mocked God won't be made a fool of he says for whatsoever a man Seth that shall we also re reap this is the law of the Harvest and this is a law of God church and this is the best thing you can read in your Bible because what happened in the beginning was God sowed a seed and he SED it in your heart and he swed it in my heart and what did he do he sowed the seed of a son or daughter of God in there and what God's saying is here is whatever is sown is what's going to come out that is the anchor that holds me day in and day out whether I feel like a child of God or whether I don't is the seed of God is inside of me and that is the anchor is that I am a child of his but he says now listen you're going to sow as well and whatever you sow is what you're going to reap whatever decisions you make we sow temporary seeds every single day by way of our decisions amen and he says for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption you s after this human nature you sow after the desires of this body and this mind that we have you reap corruption he says but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting everything we do is good or bad and what determines good or bad the will of the Lord if you're in God's will it's good and if you're outside of the will of God it's not good anything that's for God is good and anything that's against God is bad so it's in the word it's in God's will that's what determines if you're sowing good seed to the spirit and everything else is to the Flesh and it reaps corruption he says but let us not be weary in well-doing in other words let's not be weary in sewing to the spirit why because that doesn't always reap things so good immediately you don't always get the good feeling of sowing in the spirit you don't always get the good feeling of sewing in the word but he says if we do that for in due season we shall reap if we faint not if we stay with it if we hold to the sewing that we swed in the first place by the Spirit by the word of God then that's going to produce what God Said but you've got to hold on to it because God doesn't tend to do things like this when it breaks out of the ground it seems immediate but it's been growing all along you've got to seow the right thing there scripture says there that we reap corruption if you go back there it's talking about the length of time there's a time that you s and there's a time that you reap and the thing is when you sow something bad it takes a while to bring corruption but nonetheless corruption is all you get it's death it's destruction it's Mayhem it's chaos it's separation from God Amen the pleasure is immediate when you swow to the flesh but the corruption starts from there and it just goes and it goes and it goes and it produces death amen that's what Satan's trying to do get us to sew to the flesh to the lust of the eyes the lust of the the flesh that he he'll get us to Fritter away our time and get stuck on things of this life rather than sowing to the spirit focusing on the things that matter to God we look at Adam's Harvest Adam had a moment of pleasure with his wife and then as soon as he finishes that he has time to think now he has time to take his action and run it by the word of God and he realizes I'm in trouble and fear sets in he was scared to face up to God the very one that had the closest fellowship with Adam now he's scared to step into his presence he doesn't want to do it but we see that he was gracious we look at G Genesis 3 it says and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree wherever I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said it was the woman's fault really she made you do it Adam the woman who thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat you notice he says the woman you gave me he's almost putting it back on God you gave me a flawed wife and the Lord God said unto the woman God doesn't answer anything he just follows it down the line what is this thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this you notice he never asked the serpent what did you do he knew what had been done he says because thou Hast done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life he says and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and it shall Thou shalt bruise his heel and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened under the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it curs it is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return under the ground for out of it thou was taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust thou shal return but I want you to consider something here because God has already declared that death was the penalty but yet what do we see here we don't see death as the way we would think of it we see what consequences but we don't see death not this day not now what is it there's a Grace that's being applied here but God has to fulfill his word he can't go against his own word what we see here is righteous consequences for their actions they're going to die all right he tells it to Adam in verse 19 he says You Came Out of the Dust you're going back to the dust you're going to die one day physically but there's something else has happened to give you Grace for now and we see it in verse 21 because what's happened here is love has projected that's what happen is love is projected and now Grace is doing what producing what is needed for love to take place nothing's deserved here but watch what love does verse 21 it says unto Adam also and his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them what did he do he gave them a covering for the thing that was separating them from his presence he calmed them down he settled the fear and anxiety for a moment but if you know one thing is that you can't have skins unless something dies and this is where we see the provision of Grace because of love something had to die I want to set the tone for this week with this quote brother B said God requires Perfection I want you to dwell on that this entire weekend God requires Perfection Because by the end of it I'm hoping we'll have a greater revelation of what God's done for us God requires Perfection amen he says we want to bear that in mind that there's nothing just partway can go in the presence of God catch that nothing partway can go in the presence of God he says it must be perfect our worship everything now in the Garden of Eden God had Adam and Eve in the garden and they sinned and transgress the laws of God by sinning and Disobedience and when transgression comes disobedience is the transgression of the law and the law of God him being holy just unadulterated holy therefore no spot of unholiness can ever stand in his presence so if sin came in the world by transgression then sin must be dealt with before the sinner can ever stand in the presence of God he says every law has a penalty for the penalty of transgressing God's law is death and it had to project death to the human race and all of the human race is under the penalty of this law now when Adam and Eve had sinned there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with and no man can commit a sin of any type no matter how liter or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of the holy God but watch this he says and then love of God went out for his subject and when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace produces the object of the love amen Love by Grace produces a solution he says and God by forn knowledge when he loved his race so well yet with the penalty he caused the substitutionary death to take place in the Garden of Eden remember God can't break his word but he can add to it he can interpret it but he can't break it he says that was he substituted an innocent creature a little lamb that knew no sin and it went for a substitute to work and to die in the stead of the guilty Sinner and it was a lamb slain to hold the life of his subjects so we saw that they were clothed with skins what was it a lamb had died for their sake that's their clothing their clothing was to prove that something else had taken their place it was a covering it did not fix the sin but it covered the results of it it was just a covering though amen it covered their nakedness it made them not scared now to stand in his presence amen it helped calm them down but it was just a respit it was just a momentary break from the effects of what had happened brother Brown would continue he would say grace provided a preparation Grace is love and God so loved his Fallen creatures that he provided a preparation to stand them in his presence before judgment God went and killed sheep or animals and put skins on them to cover them up and blood was first made before the Judgment the Judgment was through the blood of course and then he shed the blood of the innocent to cover up the guilt of the guilty so it was just a respit it was just a temporary thing that he did there it did not stop the law from taking effect did not did not stop them from being taken out of his presence it did not stop death but it took them away from the immediacy of what they deserved of what the law of God had declared amen death was coming but it wouldn't be immediate why because they were being separated from the Tree of Life which is Christ that was the source of eternal life as to be in the presence of God and so he separated them and then so there was this slow death after that until they would die and no man lived a thousand years scripture says a thousand years is as a day in the eyes of God no one made it past the day in God's eyes every single one died physically but they had that separation but I want to jump back from this because we see what he did but we've got to see that God has a preparation even before he does this and how he's going to do it and it's a secret of this whole mystery of the atonement is found in the scripture we read where he said and I will put enity between thy seed and the serpent seed he says what the serpent seed she had a seed and he had a seed and then he quotes and he shall bruise thy head and you shall bruise his heel he says a bruise there means to make an atonement so the Prophet by the word interprets that phrase there and says he's saying there I'm going to make an atonement now what does it mean to atone what is an atonement it means to cover to remove from evidence to hide to make amends to satisfy the requirement or to make reparation in other words it means to undo everything that had caused the problem in the first place to atone means to unravel the effect as if it never happened in the first place the prophet of God will continue he says now when there was a trouble God has always been the god to meet the need he says when there is a need for his people and you know that and God promised that he would Supply their need yet when they had did wrong and they had sinned and done things that was wrong yet when they had need of healing he's talking about the Brazen serpent God even made an atonement for healing when there was no atonement yet see God made it in the face of every difficulty God Will Make A Way of Escape he will do it if you'll just have faith and believe him that tells that under the atonement is a way of Escape for everything that sin has placed in our lives that no matter what Satan has on you what he thinks he has on you what he tries to place on you what he plagues you with what he fights you with the way out is through an atonement because God has a provided way for every one of his children to make a way of Escape amen church if we ever inject ourselves into the into the solution what are we going to do we're going to end up sitting on the curb wondering what went wrong cuz we can't make an atonement for ourselves we cannot do it amen everything that we have is a temporary covering and our favorite way of it is religion what trying to make ourselves acceptable rather than taking the acceptable way that's it amen we read already that God requires Perfection I don't know about you I ain't perfect so if I am not perfect in myself why would I ever inject myself into a process that requires Perfection I have no place in this thing amen but God said I'm going to atone I'm going to make a way amen I'm going to satisfy my own requirement because he's the only perfect one we fell and since the days of Adam and Eve we have only Fallen further and further away naturally speaking everything we do is is destructive but God would say I'm going to do it I'm going to bruise his head and he's going to bruise my heel I personal pronoun God himself was going to step down and make a way God saying you can't do it you tried it doesn't work so I've got to do it this is mine and mine alone to do I think it's amazing sometimes that we think we can save ourselves and you say brother John I don't believe it then stop trying our actions bely our words when we say yes he does all things he's my provider he's my healer he's my this he's my that and then we go out and we try and do it all ourselves and we don't let go and say Lord I'm your child and I'm trying to step into your word so just let me be quiet and still for a bit and let you do the work let you be the provider let you be the healer let you be the guide let you open the doors amen I've always said this that I believe that the the great attribute of the True Believer is rest and it's rest in the finished work that he does all things well he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us and he's our all in all that is where we rest amen i' rather go straight to his way like save the time save the time we beat around the bush and we try and we try and we try and open doors and we try and make things happen and what happens is we just get tired and we get frustrated and we get wore out and we get snippety and then we finally say this is not the way a Believer is supposed to act and we realize that's exactly it I haven't been believing I've been working too hard I've been trying too hard I've been trying to make it happen myself and it's taken me completely out of the workings of God in my life and the holy spirit's pushed away we got to step back and let him do these things but I want you to see here that right there in Genesis 3 he made an unconditional Covenant he said I'm going to bruise his head and he's going to bruise my heel there is nothing of me in that there's nothing of you in that he said it's my work and mine alone God didn't even tell him to keep sacrifice icing they did it by Revelation but God never made a law that they had to sacrifice after that until Moses until they chose a law over the grace of God when they tried to take works and God said all right I'll give you works and you'll just condemn condemn yourself all the more but you'll never see him requiring sacrifice he made the sacrifice there but God had already provided a covering for them we see it much later when God's talking to Abraham and we see that Abraham was called by Grace not by performance Abraham was just walking around like brother Mark talks about living under a mushroom maybe Abraham was a Roman Catholic you know just bobbing along doing a thing and God just sovereignly called him we have no idea of Abram's life prior to that but all we know is God just went down and he said Abram I'm going to make a great nation out of you h seriously it's that simple isn't it brother Mark he calls and you say okay where did that come from whatsoever a man SWS he'll reap whatsoever God SWS he'll reap and he's just reaping what he soow before the foundation of the world and he wrote a name in the Lamb's Book of Life and that's what he's coming back for and we're just realizing it amen we're of Abraham's seed we're of faith not of works there is a works that follows but we don't get in by works we get in by faith Amen in acceptance of the righteousness of Christ amen the promise that Abraham gets has nothing to do with his morality his Holiness his performance his Works none of that it's by grace that he's called listen this is Genesis 12 now the Lord God or the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed what did you do to deserve it Abraham nothing I was living the exact same as the person next to me and God came down and said I'm going to bless you above everybody else on this Earth Church you're no different than Abram tonight no less the same lineage The Original Seed the word seed by faith amen God comes out here and he says I will I will I will that's what a one-sided Covenant that's what an unconditional Covenant looks like is when one person says I will I will I will and we see all the way through Abraham's life what did Abraham do to deserve this nothing what would Abraham do to to deserve this nothing quite the contrary he'd obey disobey obey disobey in the land out of the land in the land out of the land fing the child not by Sarah messing up constantly but he would always come back because God would keep drawing him back that's the grace that's pulling him into the Covenant the grace pulls you into his Covenant we don't earn our way into it amen but this is God's unconditional Covenant and he says Abraham in you shall all families of the earth be blessed that's a supernatural promise that's not a natural lineage that's a supernatural lineage that he's talking about there and all Abraham had to do was be obedient and he was disobedient at times but he'd come back and Obey and every time he came back and obey God would confirm God would confirm God would confirm and then finally God did exactly what he said he was going to do God will bring us back time and time and time again again church amen we'll step out we'll have a besetting sin we'll make bad decisions we'll waste our time we'll waste our gift whatever it might be and God is gracious and he just keeps pulling us back pulling us back pulling us back because whatsoever God SWS God's going to reap and he has sowed word children amen but once Abraham separated from his family completely once he got into total obedience and God will bring us to that place he'll bring us to a a place of total obedience Abraham took his time remember he took his father or father-in-law with them and then he took lot with him and once he separated from all those God said no you got to separate yourself once he separated himself then God started to deal with them on the Covenant we see it now in Genesis 15 it says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision okay this is God coming down to confirm the promise he said fear not Abraham or Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward Christ is our reward that's the greatest thing we have here is him we're not here for worldly wealth and recognition and these things but we're here to what receive him he is the greatest thing that we're looking for in this but watch how this scene plays out and Abraham said Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless he's saying God it doesn't matter what you give me if I don't have somebody to inherit it it dies with me it dies with me what's the point he said and the steward of my house is this elar Eleazar of Damascus because he's a servant and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and behold one born in my house is mine Heir a servant is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine Heir he says and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be he's confirming the promise of Genesis 12 which we just read and it says and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness now watch now this is God coming up now to to talk about how he's going to prove it and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of the of er of the caldes to give thee this land to inherit what's he's doing he's reminding Abram I'm the one that started this Abram you didn't start this I started it it's my promise to you not your promise to me I'm here Abram and even though it looks like nothing's been happening I've been here all along I've been here all along and now that you're in a place of obedience I can keep moving with you that's all I was waiting on Abram I didn't go anywhere I just needed you to get into the line needed you to get into where I told you to be and as soon as you did that look here I am it's a lesson for us church if it seems like God has pulled away have we pulled away from him or has he pulled away from us are we in obedience or are we in iniquity cuz at this stage pretty much much everything we do as iniquity church we know better we know better there's not much hidden now there's no room for ignorance anymore we know what we ought to be doing and we all know what we ought not to be doing by now but God says listen I'm the one that started this and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it Abram saying God sounds good prove it nothing's happened nothing's changed in my life I'm getting older and older all I've got is a servant he's a good servant he's a faithful servant but he's not my son Lord how are you going to do that and he said unto him take me an eer of 3 years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon this is God saying this is how I'm going to prove it and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each pieace one against another he says but the vers divided be them divided he not so he killed one of the big animals and he split them in half and he put the two sides on either side and then he put a bird one on either side and he didn't separate those birds it says and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away so of course anytime you kill an animal the birds come when I killed a Moes last fall you wouldn't believe how bold those birds were to get in there and try and steal something from me and the funny thing is I could put out a little tender bit for them and they come right into whatever I wanted but they just came in and what did they do they want that fresh kill and so what does Abram do Abram tries to inject himself into the promise and he tries to beat them all off he tries to keep it clean he tries to make it work he tries to make it acceptable it says but when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo an Aur of great Darkness fell upon him so Abraham's been immobilized now Abram's been taken out of partaking in this Covenant okay he's helpless to do anything and he said God said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance it says and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full catch verse 17 it says and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces and in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt under the Great River the river Euphrates now this is quite a scene if you can imagine it Abraham kills the young cow three-year-old cow lb splits it in half puts two sides then he takes a goat splits it in half puts the two sides over then he takes a male sheep splits it in half puts them there and then kills a pigeon and a dove and lays them both there this is buckets and buckets of blood and gore and mess it is gruesome it's disgusting but God said this is how I'm going to confirm the Covenant in this big mess that's here and it's not a super it's not this natural Covenant that's only a part of it but it's going back to Genesis 3 where God says he's going to bruise my heel and I'm going to bruise his head because remember he's confirming the Covenant that in all thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed or in thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed thy seed one not seeds we know Paul talks about that later he says not seeds as in many but sees as in one Christ he says this is how the Covenant is going to be fulfilled yes you Abraham you've got a land and you've got a natural seed but that's not what I'm working with you in you I've got a a supernatural seed that's coming and it's a seed of Faith it's a word seed it's a predestinated seed and it's going to come and it's going to produce one that'll do exactly what's shown right here the prophet of God would take us to this scene he says look when he come down and show to Abraham what he was going to do he says first he put Abraham to sleep now Abraham you don't have nothing to do with it I say praise the Lord that he's not trusting in me to make this work he says now he said Abraham he put him to sleep said I'll show you how I'm going to do it how I'm going to keep my Covenant and he took those animals now watch when Abraham went to sleep showing death must come to Every Creature then before him went a burning furnace and a burning furnace represented hell that every sinner deserve to go to hell he says and then beyond that by the sacrifice on the hill went to little white light what was it it's the pillar of fire Christ that went in between each one of those pieces of sacrifice he says now the Covenant see they made different covenants different people's Customs but the Oriental custom was to kill a beast and stand in between this beast and then write it out over here you find in Leviticus they write out their agreement and that agreement is tore in two over this dead beast and they take an oath over the dead beasts that if they break this Covenant May their body be as this dead Beast and they give each one a piece everyone that's part of a covenant gets a piece of the Covenant hold it in your minds he says and then they're sent away and when they come back those two pieces has to dovetail just exactly the same pieces he says how beautiful the Covenant is confirmed when the two match up again torn apart reunited that's the proof of the Covenant he says God making a covenant showing pre-show that I have sworn that I'll do it in your seed I'll bless all the nations of the world read it he says I'll bless the Gentiles I'll bless the black man the yellow man the white man I'll bless everyone through your seed for out of you will come Kings and princes how are you going to do it Lord he says I'll show you how and he showed him on the hillside where those pieces represented he says and any Bible scholar here knows that each one of those was a clean animal that represented the sacrifice of Jesus Christ he was the ram he was the heer that made the Waters of Separation when you had the Waters of Separation through he says now we have the washing of washing by the word by the Water by the word of the separation from sin through the word through believing he says and the pigeon and the turtle dove was Divine Healing that all was in Christ nowhere here do you see you and I in our in our natural side of things remember he says God took Abraham completely out of the Covenant God required death so he gave them a temporary covering in the garden by way of the death of an innocent lamb now he's coming to Abraham and he's saying now Abraham I'm going to atone for sin this is not just about a land of Canaan this is not just about the children of Israel this is about all of humanity All Families on Earth are going to be blessed he says I'm not going to do something temporary now I'll give you temporary for a while but something has to happen because the Deb load's building up and all I'm doing is covering the interest but it's just building and it's building and building and it's going to be messy and gruesome and Abraham you can't do it you don't have it in you to do it so I've got to take you out of the way and I'm going to do it and I'm going to do it alone I've got to pay the price I've got to take the only part that's available you can't do it he says the only thing you're going to know is that when the work's done you'll be back in my presence that's how you know it's done that's how you know it's effective is that you get to come back in my presence presence again Abram Abraham's all about having a son God's all about restoring the children restoring the family of God back to himself and he did it through a faithful line that started with Abraham we know that Christ did not come through any natural birth there's no natural DNA of Abraham up through the up through that line that came into Christ but Naturally Speaking when we look at it we would say he was a son of Abraham he was the son he was the Seed of Abraham that way amen but God's saying there's much more going on here Abraham than just this I'm going to do something in your day but this is going to be something that takes care of everything that's happened up to this point amen our blessing is in the the spiritual Seed of Abraham not in the natural seed God said I'm going to come down it was him walking in the midst I'm going to be torn apart I'm going to be made a mess of I'm going to be torn into two I'm going to be broken and in that will be an atonement for everything that's happened before this and what's he telling Abraham he puts him to sleep Abraham you can't start it you can't stop it you can't deserve it you can't do anything you're just the beneficiary and that's the grace of God you just get the benefits Israel under the law we know what happened brother Brandon would say that they turned down God and they took the law they chose a man and when he did it he gave them atonements and you go looking in Leviticus especially and they've got an atonement for everything they got an atonement at for diseases they got atonement for family issues they got atonement for mistakes and failures and sins and unknown sins and all these different things and every time you made an atonement something had to die and it was just animal after animal being di being killed and being killed and mess after mess and it was a bloody mess and all it did was was absorb the wrath of God temporarily that's all it was it never resolved anything it never changed people it never changed situations it just covered things up temporarily and God even ordained a day of atonement every year for people to dwell on all the wrong that they' done and we read it in L viticus and he says and the Lord God spake unto Moses saying also on the 10th day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be in holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord he says you'll afflict your souls that word afflict means humiliate humble be down W bowed down with the weight basically dwell on all of your shortcoming and your failures and your flaws and your sins of the year not a fun day every year you had to dwell on why you were unworthy what a horrible Feast it's not this is not a Christmas event that's for sure sit there and go over in your mind how you failed every single day of this year how you thought you were doing so well and then you failed repeat repeat repeat they needed to be reminded why so they'd start looking for the solution so they'd say there's got to be a day where enough is enough where this can change where we can go back to the way we were he was developing a hunger and a thirst in them to be restored back it says and you shall do no work in that same day for it's a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God for whatsoever Soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people he says you've got to take time out to realize what is going on in your life that you need me and that You' got to come the way that I tell you to he says and whosoever soul it shall be that doeth any work in that same day the same soul will I destroy from among his people God's law was serious and God said this is a serious deal you better do it he says or I'll cut you off from the whole Tabernacle you won't ever get in my presence again the day you eat thereof is the day you die he'll give them what they deserved by the law amen but what effect did this day of atonement have on the people except to cause sorrow shame embarrassment maybe fear it never changed them but it only reminded them of how separated they were from God that they needed him that they needed the blood of a lamb that they needed a sacrifice that they needed something greater than themselves it never lifted them up it always pushed them down like I said God was developing them in them a cry for a messiah for somebody that would take their sins that would make a way back to the presence of God but all this did was it held back the righteous Judgment of God and remember what would happen is that the priest had to go in and he had to go in for his own sins first and then when God accepted that he went in and he sacrificed for the entire nation and the people could take a collective sigh of of Rel when he came out that second time alive and God had accepted that sacrifice and they knew their sins were pushed back another year but in another year they would come back around and they're back in the same place waiting and seeing is he going to forgive us or is he not never change the people never change their desires never change their Natures just cover them temporarily Paul talks about in Hebrews 10 he says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things he says it's pointing to something it's not the thing but it's pointing to something he says can never with those sacrifices which they offered yearby year continually make the comers there unto perfect he said for all of that every year coming in year after year day of atonement making sacrifices making atonements he says it never made them perfect and never made them acceptable In God's Presence never did he says for then would they not have ceased to be offered if it was effective he says wouldn't they have stopped doing it he says because that the worshippers once Pur should not have had any more conscience of sin in other words if the atonement was truly effective wouldn't it take away the guilt on their conscience wouldn't it have taken away the nature that was causing them to sin he says but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year nothing ever went away nothing was ever dealt with it just pushed it off it kicked the can down the road he says for is not possible that the blood of blls and goats should take away sins brother Brown would say it this way he says and under the Old Testament the law was when a man sinned he brought a lamb to the altar say if he transgressed any of The Commandments he brought the lamb and he laid it on the Altar and he laid his hands upon the lamb and he confessed his sins that he was wrong and knew that he was guilty the law required death this is our position he says and he brought the lamb in his said the throat of the Lamb was cut and it began to kick its little feet and bleeding he said if you've ever seen a lamb slaughtered what a pitiful cry the poor little fellow trying to bleed and his jugular vein is cut and he kicks and quivers and as he straightens out then Quivers again and bleeds and the blood gushes out it bathes his little wool in the worshipper hands and as the worshipper realiz him for committing adultery for lying stealing whatever his guilt was or even evil thinking he says what whatever it was in the least Shadow he was guilty because he was it was his nature now catch this he says he was a guilty person not maybe by desire but by Nature he was guilty Paul would talk about in Romans 7 who will deliver me from this body of death when I want to do good evil is present with me and when I it just seems no matter what I do no matter where I go I can't do the thing that I want to do I intend to do it and then I don't do it I want to do it and then I don't do it he says and he had to recognize that this little innocent lamb died in his place and he felt sorry for the little thing you say I don't mean to do it brother John that doesn't matter if you do it in the eyes of God it doesn't matter under the law we're talking under the law we're talking you'd say God I didn't want to do it I got tricked into it can I say this if you keep getting tricked into something maybe you're not being so tricked after all if you know where you're going and you keep getting tricked you're not being tricked you're doing it willingly knowing what's going to happen that's iniquity and God deals with that completely differently for a child of God if you keep getting tricked in the same place doing the same thing you're fooling yourself that it's Satan and there's a desire that has to be taken care of inside of that little heart of ours I speak by experience amen you got to cut those things out brother Joe and I were talking just this week and I said listen I I was talking about social media I think I've shared over over the pulpit you go on to social media and they will offer things to you no matter what they've got an algorithm and they're trying to get you hooked and so they'll offer stuff and for guys eventually they're going to throw women at you no matter what you click or don't click they're going to throw it at you and I said enough is enough I'm not doing anything I ought not to do on here but they keep throwing it at me I said I've got to get that out of my life because eventually I'll click on it why cuz I'm a red-blooded man and in a moment of weakness I'll do something I not to do so what do I do I take it away knowing that that is the place of Temptation why CU Satan would say no no no every time you do that you'll get tricked no no no I know you're waiting for me there Satan so I just get you out okay I'm using my own life as an example so you don't think I'm preaching at you I'm saying that's what I've had to do because if he can knock me down it bleeds into the congregation I've got to hold a standard and Satan will use anything he can to knock me down and that Spirit can go right through the church amen let's stop him when we know where he's at let's not keep going back let's hold him don't walk on his land kick him off of yours he says and but that man as soon as that lamb died with the blood of the Lamb upon his hands he walked away from the building with the same desire in his heart that he had at the beginning why he says cuz life lays in the blood your life is in your blood and the life and the blood of the animal of the Lamb was animal life therefore when its little cor pusles were broken and the life went out of that animal it could not come back to the worshipper because the worshipper was a human being he says the blood made a covering but it could not perfectly atone we're talking about the full atonement tonight he says it could atone but not perfectly he says for the man left the building with the same desire to sin as he had in the first place so if you get a full atonement what'll it'll do it'll change you that's what a full atonement does is it doesn't cover it changes it changes the situation and it changes you he says but doing this he was looking forward to a time when there would come a perfect lamb come this was all a type it was pointing to God's Great provision and he did it on the burnt offering because it was the only way he knew about so you see when the blood was pouring the life went out from the animal it could not come back to the man for one was animal one was man he said an innocent animal to a guilty man and we see the brutal deaths of animal after animal after animal and what was it doing it was pointing to the righteous Judgment of God that was his right to claim death not that he wanted it not that he's a bloodthirsty God but he says that's what happens when you when you transgress my word and so you saw maybe millions and millions of animals killed to try and cover up those sins to hold off the wrath of a of a just God Amen but God's word has to be satisfied but the thing is he said I'm going to satisfy it I'll give you a temporary fix brother Matt you know all about temporary fixes don't you when you don't have the part you need you put one in that'll work for a short time it won't last the way it's supposed to but it's a temporary fix God says I'll give you something temporary until I come and fix the real issue think of it thousands of years now and what's happening is Adam and Eve they just do one little sin and it's a pile just one little thing but every year what happens is a pile just grows and grows and grows and the only thing that covers it is the millions and millions of animals that they're killing every year but the pile's still there the sin's still there the problem's still there the proof is still there the debt has not been paid and so it's just building and it's building and it's a building and look even before uh you know when Noah was there we talked about earlier where the thoughts of men were evil continually had got to the place where God wiped out the entire world except for eight people because of how bad it was that's how great the sin was in God's eyes he says I've got to destroy this and I'll start again with just eight and what did that do one of the eight was still bad cuz we're all born and sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies even Noah his chosen vessel failed no matter what he did it did not resolve the issue the sin issue the unbelief issue and all that's building up what would it look like if we if we we we built up the sins I think I I spoke on this many a couple years ago where if you you said each one of us had a book of sins and I calculated we'd have if we had one word per sin we could do about a thousand pages in our life if we did a certain number every day we'd have enough books to go back into the moon back and forth back and forth many times that's the sins of the world built up what would the wrath of God look like if he truly judged us for that remember what we just read not just what you do what you think the attitude the response the inclination every single one of it building up and up and up I've told the story of how I dreamed of hell until I got the Holy Ghost and this is literally what it was was the inevitable Judgment of your sins coming back on you remember brother Rah says hell is solitary because you sit there and you think about everything you shouldn't have done that you did and everything you ought to have done that you didn't what a horrible place to be stuck there thinking it could have been different you say what does that wrath look like well we know what it looked like because he took it all out on Christ and Christ came down specifically to offer himself as a sacrifice to atone for our sins Isaiah 53 says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he's speaking of Christ now he says for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he had no form nor cless and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men in other words we turned our back on him as if he had done something wrong as if he was the problem he says a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised him we esteemed him not we wouldn't even look at him not even worthy of looking at him it says surely he had borne whose griefs ours and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted we're saying this was his fault he must have done something that's what the priesthood was saying when they crucified him and the people he must have done something wrong to deserve this we put it all on him it says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities that word iniquities means for our depravity for doing Unthinkable and unspeakable things before a holy God and refusing to do the things he asked us to do so what we did was completely unacceptable before him and then we wouldn't even do what he asked us to do either he says the chastisement of our peace was upon him so in other words the punishment required to give us peace and rest God took it out on him it says and with his stripes we are healed he was with ripped and torn within an inch of his life they destroyed his back until the bones showed through it looked like raw hamburger hanging off of him so that we could be healed he did not say we were healed he did not say we would be healed he says we are healed yesterday today and forever that's why the birds weren't horn the pigeon and the dove those were what they held together there's no tearing them apart it's always available Divine Healing is always available to the children of God he says all we like sheep have gone astray all and we have turned everyone to his own way we've done what we thought was right what we thought was good what we thought was our right I'm a free man man I'm a free woman I can do whatever I want I can think whatever I want I can dress however I want I can be whoever I want to be right he paid the price for our decisions he says and the Lord ha laid on him the iniquity of us all I want to stop here as we start to close tonight because we're speaking on a price required and a price paid and I want us to see what we deserved I want to see us to see what we've been saved from well we've been spared tonight it says and there God showed Abraham what he was going to do through that seed of Isaac he would bring forth his only begotten son Christ and was slain Yonder between the heavens and earth when the sun went down and Blackness over the Earth he says and there he tore him apart tore him apart God pulled his soul out of him and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth when that precious unadulterated blood of the almighty God dripping down emanuel's veins he says he tore that soul out of him and he said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all he knew was Unity with God he knew no sin he knew no smut he knew no Blackness he knew no Darkness he knew no fear and in the end God tore him apart so much that he took his own Spirit from him and the man the body was left saying my God my God why have you forsaken me he went from being pure as pure could be to as black and smutty as we could all lay on him every single thing that we've ever done collectively dumped on a vessel that only knew Holiness you take a shower and then you go outside and somebody throws you in the mud how you going to feel take that and multiply it by a million million million times and that what he felt he went from Pure as the driven snow to having every weight of every sin the feeling when we do something wrong how do we feel that guilt that embarrassment that shame he had that just dumped on him in one Fell Swoop from every one of us every sin in the past every sin in the present every sin in the future dumped on him and in the end he says God why have you forsaken me he said his face full of mockery spit a crown of cruel mockery pulled down over his brow his nails driven were Roman spikes his back Riven until his rib showed through swinging on the cross screaming dying a sinner's death and the sin of the world upon him and there God rived his side tore his soul out of him when he said into thy hands I commend my spirit and dropped his head and the Earth shook and belched out its Rock he says there he is there's God's covenant there's the fulfilling of it then he tore the soul of his own son and separated a covenant and he threw the body onto the ground tore the body apart but there's a covenant that he pulled out of that imagine now scripture says he who knew no sin became our sin he didn't just have sin he became sin he personified it he became it remember he was Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father now his name is Sin Sin he became sin he was the man of sin he was a person of sin he wasn't just holding it he became it he was the despised and rejected one the fullness of God in flesh became the effect and the weight and the fruit of every bad and wrong and evil thing we've ever done like that the weight of the sins of a hundred billion people on them body wrecked destroyed mangled beyond recognition Isaiah said as many were astonished at thee his Visage his face was so marred more than any other man and his form more than the sons of men he looked worse than any man has ever looked what it means here is that he didn't look like a man anymore more that's how beat up he was that's how wrecked he was that's how destroyed his body was prophet of God said God gave him a body that could take the abuse and live because it would have killed any other of us he gave him a body that was built to handle the suffering long enough for him to fulfill every portion of the scriptures that were written about him and then he would voluntarily give up his life Isaiah 53 continues it says he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a SL lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living and for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because what he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth he hadn't done a thing catch for verse 10 yet it pre pleased the Lord to bruise him to crush him to break him this is the bruising that was talked about in Genesis 3 you say Satan bruised him death bruised him but God poured his wrath out on that body the scripture says that it literally pleased God to just pour it out all on him did God enjoy it that's not what it means by pleasing he could unload it he could get it off the books you business owners when you got when you're in the red what are you trying to do you're trying to get the debts off and God's trying to get the debts off the book He's pleased because this the debt is being satisfied the price is being paid and when the price is paid and an atonement is made now he can start the process of bringing his children back that's why it pleased him but he had to do it because he's a righteous God and judgment has to follow the law amen because out of this would come something that was far greater and Christ it says took it all without complaint somebody says something to us and we flash off and he took out the sin of every single human being on this planet and never opened his mouth once to defend himself yet knowing he had done nothing wrong knowing not believing knowing he had done nothing wrong his face so beat up that he didn't even look like a man anymore his back shredded looked like hamburger hanging in shreds off of his back his rib showing through that was what I deserved that's what I should have looked like that's what you should have looked like under the law of God under the word of God under judgment under righteous judgment I should have had to do that but he took it he took it for you he took it for me and what is it he tread The Wine Press of God's Wrath alone he did it willingly laid his life down as a sacrifice that specially made body he sacrificed it he laid it all on the line for you and I that we could benefit that we could be under a total and full atonement I want to just read this in the Amplified in verse 10 it says that when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand so see what happens there as we have yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him then there's a period of time he put him to grief a longer period of time and then it says out of that comes this great thing it says he shall see his he shall when you and he make his life an offering for sin and he's risen from the dead in the time to come he shall see his spiritual Offspring you know who that is you and I this is the joy that lay before Christ why he did it he says he'll prolong his days and the will and pleasure of of the Lord shall prosper in his hand it says he shall see the travail of his soul he'll see what he went through you saw what he did in the in the Garden of Gethsemane that's where he travailed and he travailed so much that he sweated drops of blood and then he travailed on the cross so much that the blood and the water separated that's how hard he suffered that's how hard he worked to stay in the will of God he says he shall see the travail of his soul and he shall be satisfied Hallelujah when God satisfied that's all that matters when God says the debt is paid that means the debt is paid that when Satan comes our way and tries to lay it on us you could say he said he was satisfied the debt is paid you can't hold me with that it's under the blood he took the price he took the debt he paid it God is s Saied it doesn't exist it ain't on the Bucks anymore sinless spotless today because of what he did God was satisfied that means no more sacrifices needed that means no law is needed that means no more days of atonement it means god is done with dealing with us through animals and he's now ready to come back and deal with us as Sons and Daughters Direct he says and by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors what did he say he said I'm going to bruise his heel I'm going to bruise his head he's going to bruise my heel but he said it's going to be a full atonement it's going to unravel this sick twisted thing he's tried to do with humanity and I'll redeem my people and bring them back to where they can be my children where they can be my bride at my side where they can come into my presence where they can stand and they can ask and they can pray and I'll hear them and I'll answer them and I'll lead them and I'll guide them and I'll feed them and I'll provide for them I'll give them rest it was Satan that bruised him absolutely it was Satan that drove that thorn of death into him but he didn't drive it in prophet of God would say he saw it coming and he took it and he anchored it in him that Stinger of death he says and it killed that bee and he doesn't have a stinger anymore he'll take you but he can't keep you Christ God in flesh took every punch took every stroke of that loaded whip if any of you have ever seen that that movie The Passion of the Christ you watch that whipping scene and they start with just a light Whip and what happens is Jesus doesn't Buckle under it and so what they do is they take out that cat of Ninetails and it's a long whip and in the end they've just got 90 degree angles of Steel and you see a scene there where they take it and they they try it out on a table of wood first and it hits the wood and it Yanks wood chunks out and then they turn around and they start going one by one two men back and forth because it takes energy to do it and they wore themselves out ripping his back apart with steel and you see the final picture and this is just a movie church it was worse than that and you see Christ and he's tied to the post and his hands are up and there's just 10 or 15 ft of blood and muscle in One Direction and in another where those two men just threw that whip at him and then yanked the flesh out threw it in yanked it out until what his whole back was just nothing just a mess ribs showing through his whole body exposed why so you and I could have our healing he kept himself there so we could have our healing he says when we look at Christ you see the penalty the only one God himself made flesh God coming to the Earth and he took on him the sin of all of us and the judgment and the wrath of almighty God was poured out upon his body and there it was Riven at the cross that's the real judgment he tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God Alone we've got each other many times but everyone forsook him that day he says alone he walked the road alone he died with no help from an angel from a man from his church from his mother from his Brethren from his father forsaken by God man and nature he was so forsaken that Earth wouldn't accept him and Heaven wouldn't either so he had to die in between he died alone to show us that even nature itself can't help us in the hour of death there's no friend no Priest No Pope no Pastor it's death he says but there was one who took it for us church we fail we fail so many times and if we think about a righteous God we say why is he not taking it out on me because he took it out on him he doesn't need to beat you he beat Christ he doesn't need to whip you he whipped Christ he doesn't need to crush you he crushed Christ so you're sitting there and you're saying I deserve more you do deserve more I deserve more but he already took it out the wrath of God has been satisfied that's why we don't get what we deserve anymore but remember there's always consequences but the consequences are not what you deserve consequences are what you sow and that is not what you deserve you deserve death under the law but he satisfied the law he brought a perfect atonement and so we sit there and we say God or we look at others remember brother brandom God why don't you just wipe it all off the Earth God came and he showed him that slap every time we sin that was Christ getting slapped in the face every time brother Braham had a lot more grace after that but that's what we deserve was to be wiped off but he paid need it he made an atonement for us he said what did he do the wrath of God was upon us for being Sinners is that right no one could save himself there's nothing we could do we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and what did he do he came to the Earth Hallelujah and he trod the wine press all the wrath of almighty God was poured out upon him he quotes Revelation Thou Art Worthy oh Lamb of God for you were slain taking the sins of the world upon him and he bore our sin that God poured out the fierceness of his wrath upon him he says never a man died like that man he suffered until the blood and the water separated in his body this is what we deserved and at the end of it says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost what atonement had been paid and accepted it's not the end of the story but the price was paid it says and behold you want to know if it was an effective atonement it says and behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom remember he had the outer Court you had the inner court and then you had the holy of holies and that's where the very presence of God was the shikina glory of God and only one person could go in there once a year and they had this massive curtain that was there and it was soundproof and it was thick and baffled and it was supposed to just take everything from the outside and block it out and it was just you with God and only the high priest would go in there once a year and when Christ died that that that veil was torn from the top to the bottom showing who did it God did what was he saying access granted you can come back red or yellow black or white sinner whatever access back to God has been granted and there's another place to meet him now and it's not in a temple like that but he was going to meet him someplace else he was going to meet him by way of his Covenant amen the Covenant wasn't fulfilled but the price was paid because remember the Covenant is a tearing apart but then there's a putting back together again he tore it apart now he's got to put it back together again you can only enforce the Covenant when both halves are there and what's he got to do he's got to take what he tore out of Christ and put it back together again to satisfy his promise to his children he's unraveling the effects of sin the musicians would come Paul said it this way but God commendeth his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us amen God bless you let's stand there's no deserving this there's no working in a way that'll somehow make it easier or better there's nothing you can do to satisfy God's requirement for sin but what you can do is take his provided way that's a great greatest thing that God could ever ask us to do is say take my provided way don't try anything just take my way that's how we show him we love him that's how we show we accept him is when we say I'll take your way I'll take the price you paid and then I won't let Satan keep trying to make me pay it so many times the things that hold us back are because we think we don't deserve it we don't deserve it but he makes us worthy I don't make myself worth if he calls me now into his presence then I want to be in his presence if he says you're worthy then I'll say I'm worthy if he says you're spotless then I'll say I'm spotless and I'm not going to let Satan tell me otherwise I'm not going to let me tell me otherwise amen but I'm going to take the effect of what he did here on the atonement and say I take his righteousness CU he took my sin that's the swap he gave us that's the trade that happened at Calvary was he said I'm going to take your place and you get to take my place and there's a benefit there's a blessing under that and there's access to God that comes under that robe of righteousness but there's a restoration that's going on in all of this there's a Redemption that's going on and it's bringing back all that were torn apart in Christ prophet of God would say he says you aren't even judged now he says because you were in Christ on that cross and you took every punishment you were ever going to take right then and there you were in Christ then he says and you're in Christ now amen what a glorious place we stand in this evening every sin taken care of if our conscience bothers us he's greater than our conscience he's just and quick to forgive amen there ought to be no fear to come into the presence of God you know we're going to take communion in a few minutes and the scripture says that you're not supposed to eat unworthily that doesn't mean that we don't make mistakes it means make it right before you partake don't let Satan hold you back don't let your mistakes don't let a besetting sin don't let a habit don't let a whatever it could be that Satan would throw your way hold you back from coming up and saying I'm taking the full atonement here I'm taking the emblems of his atonement tonight and in that is our healing in that is our deliverance in that is our provision everything that we have need of is in that atonement we'll see but we've got to accept it we've got to say that was an atonement for me not just for my brother not just for my sister not just Mom not just dad not just Nan not just pop that was for me he became my sin so that I could take on his righteousness and that's why we're coming tonight is because he called us to do it he told us to do it he made a way for us to do it to stand in his very presence accepted in the Beloved and he'll withhold no good thing from us he's trying to bring us back to Eden and we're on that road amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord May nothing hold us back from your presence Lord May nothing hold us back from seeking you Lord let us not try and look at our worthiness or our Good Deeds or gifts or whatever we might have Lord but Lord may we just come humbly to your throne of Grace and say Lord we're here because you called lord and we're just trusting you to complete the work you've started in each and every one of our Lives Lord we want to say we love you tonight Lord we want to say we thank you Lord for the price that you paid Lord we can't imagine Lord and I've poorly tried to create a picture of words here this evening Lord but we can't imagine the agony Lord and alone completely forsaken by God and man Lord and you did it so that you could bring us back into relationship and fellowship with you Lord how we worship you and praise you for it Lord we thank you for your goodness Lord we thank you for your longsuffering your patience for us Lord for the Forgiveness of where we fail Lord and we only ask strength to serve you more and more each day Lord help us we pray Lord May nothing hinder us this evening Lord May there be Deliverance May there be

congregation the next and we'll alternate and I'll join together on the 34th verse as we normally do 1 Corinthians 11:23 Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you

often as you drink it in remembrance of [Music] me wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord for he that
