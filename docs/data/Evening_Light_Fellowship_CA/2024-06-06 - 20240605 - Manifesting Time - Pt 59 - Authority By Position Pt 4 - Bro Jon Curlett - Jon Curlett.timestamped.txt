[40:32] brother Jerry Fury as they come up to do
[40:34] our special meetings amen want to
[40:36] remember brother Paul Gail or Paul Gail
[40:39] I guess we can call him brother I guess
[40:40] maybe but uh I went in to visit him on
[40:42] Sunday and he was due to go into surgery
[40:44] on Monday to have a screw uh adjusted in
[40:47] his spine because it was touching the
[40:49] nerve and they went and adjusted it and
[40:51] uh he still had issues so he went back
[40:53] in today to get it readjusted so he's
[40:56] really struggling there with that that
[40:58] back surgery that fusion surgery that he
[40:59] got but that said I was able to have a
[41:02] chat with him and his wife and she had
[41:04] many questions about what we believe and
[41:06] why we believe it so in it all amen we
[41:09] we testify of God and we just trust that
[41:11] he's in all of these things so certainly
[41:13] keep them in prayer I'm hoping to get to
[41:15] see them uh sometime this weekend Lord
[41:17] willing I've got a family to take care
[41:19] of full-time now so we'll see how that
[41:22] works out but uh just remember them in
[41:24] prayer amen this is this is part of
[41:25] being a Believer it's not just the
[41:27] preaching of the word and these
[41:28] different things but it's going to those
[41:30] that are in need and holding up those
[41:32] that that have need of what we have amen
[41:34] and trusting God to do something that
[41:36] they would get a testimony that he's
[41:38] alive and well amen Hebrews 138 it's
[41:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[41:43] and forever amen let's turn to the
[41:45] scriptures if we
[41:46] would John 15 and verse 16 says ye have
[41:49] not chosen me but I have chosen you
[41:52] we're going to talk about some of that
[41:53] choosing today he says I have chosen you
[41:56] and in that Cho chesing he says I have
[41:58] ordained you that you should go forth go
[42:01] and bring forth fruit and that your
[42:04] fruit should remain he says that
[42:06] whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in
[42:09] my name he may give it to you amen God

[42:16] series and I want to take yet another
[42:18] fourth series on adoption by position
[42:21] and we're going to or authority by
[42:23] position and I want to spend some time
[42:24] on David today because in David we see
[42:26] this clear progression and he he he goes
[42:29] from being just another boy to being an
[42:31] anointed boy to being an established
[42:33] young man to being persecuted to being
[42:35] an outlaw and all the way to being a
[42:37] king and we see this beautiful
[42:38] transformation of a person's life and
[42:41] the difference is always that anointing
[42:42] that comes on him amen and I I want us
[42:45] to see that this idea of progression of
[42:47] an anointed child of God because we need
[42:49] to understand the idea of progressing in
[42:52] our walk with God Amen that that people
[42:55] can think well as soon as you got the
[42:56] Holy Ghost you've got everything yes you
[42:58] have the potential for everything inside
[43:00] of you amen but it's got to bring your
[43:01] life into subjection it's got to bring
[43:03] your mind into subjection it's got to
[43:04] bring your body into subjection and it's
[43:06] got to prove you and train you and all
[43:08] of these things and so we don't just get
[43:10] the Holy Ghost and then have everything
[43:12] manifested in their life that we're
[43:13] supposed to have but it takes a while
[43:15] for us to get the strength and the
[43:17] knowledge and the understanding and the
[43:18] wisdom of the word of God and and get it
[43:21] to come out at our lives amen and so
[43:22] we're growing at all times the scripture
[43:24] says that Jesus grew in wisdom and
[43:26] stature and favor with God and man and
[43:28] that did not stop at Jordan but it
[43:30] continued to grow and mature all the way
[43:32] up until he came to his Mount
[43:33] Transfiguration adoption experience amen
[43:36] and so we see even in Ephesians 4 this
[43:39] idea of progression Paul says he gave
[43:41] some Apostles some prophets some
[43:43] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[43:45] for the perfecting of the saints that
[43:47] word perfecting doesn't mean sinless
[43:50] Perfection but it means for the maturing
[43:52] of the Saints so if we need maturing
[43:54] that means we don't start out mature
[43:56] amen it means that we start immature if
[43:58] we want to put it that way and the
[44:00] purpose of the five full ministry is to
[44:01] bring us into a place of being mature
[44:04] Believers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[44:06] he says it's for the maturing the
[44:07] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[44:10] the ministry and for the edifying of the
[44:12] body of Christ till we all come in the
[44:16] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[44:18] of the Son of God unto a perfect man a
[44:21] mature man unto the measure of the
[44:23] stature of the fullness of Christ so we
[44:26] can't get out of here and until we're
[44:27] all mature we're all mature in the word
[44:30] amen we're mature Sons and Daughters of
[44:32] God we're all living our lives in the
[44:34] same place so to speak why he says that
[44:36] we henceforth be no more children that
[44:39] means we were children we are born
[44:41] children we are Christian children but
[44:43] yet we are children nonetheless that we
[44:45] be no more children tossed to and fro
[44:49] and carried about with every wind of
[44:50] Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning
[44:53] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[44:55] deceive he says but speak speaking in
[44:57] Truth and Love We may grow up we've got
[45:01] to grow up we've got to increase in our
[45:05] understanding increase in our nature
[45:06] increase in our wisdom increase in the
[45:08] way that we react relative to the way
[45:10] that Christ would react that we may grow
[45:12] up into him in all things which is the
[45:15] head even Christ amen so we've got to
[45:18] grow into our position in Christ and the
[45:21] prophet of God would say this he says
[45:22] every seed of God correctly placed will
[45:27] sure notice he says correctly placed
[45:30] have you ever noticed when you start a a
[45:32] plant out now I don't have a green thumb
[45:35] I don't profess to but I know we've got
[45:36] people in here that like to plant plants
[45:38] and so many times what do we do we don't
[45:40] plant them outside what do we do we take
[45:43] them and we take a seed or a couple
[45:45] seeds and we put them inside a little
[45:48] pot in the house or we put them inside
[45:51] of a a greenhouse where it's nice and
[45:53] warm and it's it's you know heated
[45:55] warmer than what's outside side and and
[45:57] so that plank gets all of the sunshine
[46:00] when they're Sunshine but the winds and
[46:03] the storms they don't they don't cause
[46:05] it problems because it's protected but
[46:07] in those conditions that seed starts to
[46:09] grow and it it it comes forth and it
[46:12] blossoms out and it breaks the ground
[46:14] and we start to see that yes there's
[46:16] something growing but we notice very
[46:18] quickly even in those shelter conditions
[46:20] it starts to outgrow the pot and so you
[46:23] have to either move it into a bigger pot
[46:25] or you have to move it out doors and so
[46:27] what do we do then is we take it and we
[46:29] put it someplace else and now it starts
[46:31] to face the challenges of being a real
[46:34] plant but under that it starts to dig
[46:37] deeper Roots it starts to become more
[46:39] resistant to disease and insects and
[46:41] these things and pretty soon it grows
[46:43] into a fully mature plant Paul says
[46:46] we've got to grow into our position in
[46:48] Christ and we see even in in different
[46:50] churches I was talking to Brother Steve
[46:52] clar about this he says our church in
[46:54] Edmonton is purely Evangelical it is
[46:57] meant to bring people to Christ to show
[47:00] them the truth of this end time message
[47:01] and he says that's what we did all the
[47:03] time and so what would happen is they
[47:05] would be plant they would be
[47:07] Planters they would get people to Christ
[47:10] but what would happen pretty soon is
[47:11] those people would move to other
[47:12] churches that have a different style of
[47:14] ministry why because they needed to be
[47:16] matured they needed to be stabilized
[47:19] they needed to be settled and so they
[47:20] had a lot of churn in their Church By
[47:22] Design because God had put a Ministry
[47:24] there to get plants to start growing but
[47:27] then they had to move to another church
[47:29] to continue to grow and mature and
[47:31] there's nothing wrong with that that's
[47:32] what the ministry is for is to take us
[47:34] all the way from the planting to the
[47:36] Harvest and everything in between and
[47:39] and so we've got to be placed what we
[47:40] see here is we've got to be placed
[47:42] someplace where we can mature and that
[47:44] doesn't mean it has to be in this church
[47:47] amen I've said it before if we're not
[47:49] fed here then we need to go someplace
[47:51] else if you're not fed under this
[47:53] ministry you need to go someplace else
[47:55] make sure it's not me and make sure that
[47:58] it's not you make sure that it's the
[48:00] leading of God but if you're not fed
[48:02] here go someplace where you can be fed
[48:03] because there's a god-ordained pastor
[48:06] out there for every child of God that's
[48:08] here that's what Ephesians 4 is telling
[48:10] us that there's somebody that's there
[48:11] that'll bring you into full maturity so
[48:14] we're not fertile ground for every type
[48:15] of Christian some people need more
[48:18] Fellowship some people need a broader
[48:19] base of ministry and more people coming
[48:21] in in those things that's what they need
[48:23] and we don't always have that but we do
[48:25] need to be correctly place and the
[48:27] correct placing is always in the word of
[48:29] God that's the thing that is common
[48:31] amongst all the five full ministry is
[48:33] they'll place you in the word of God not
[48:35] on themselves not on gifts not on signs
[48:37] and wonders they'll place you on the
[48:39] word of God and if you sit under the
[48:41] preaching of anointed hearing of the
[48:43] word then what you're going to mature
[48:45] and you're going to grow that's the way
[48:46] it works amen the holy spirit will
[48:48] always lead us to a place where we will
[48:50] mature he'll take us to a place that'll
[48:52] challenge us sometimes that's what
[48:54] drives people away is they get
[48:55] challenged and they don't like the
[48:57] challenge they don't like the
[48:59] personality of being challenged but it's
[49:01] the holy spirit that does those things
[49:03] and it brings us up because it's trying
[49:05] to get us to a higher place in our walk
[49:06] with Christ brother Brown would say this
[49:08] he says you can't expect a baby to be
[49:10] born a man you can't start at the top
[49:14] you can't just go into the water and
[49:16] come out and you're the superch
[49:17] Christian that's not the way it works he
[49:19] says it's got to grow to it and we grow
[49:22] in Christ to the full stature not
[49:24] somebody get converted tonight and
[49:25] tomorrow go to preach preach the gospel
[49:27] he says we grow up into manhood enter
[49:30] into the stature of Christ amen so it
[49:34] doesn't matter how long we've been going
[49:35] to church doesn't matter what Ministry
[49:37] we've been sitting under you've got to
[49:39] grow in Christ and that only comes by
[49:41] the Holy Spirit the only thing that'll
[49:43] make you an adult in the body is the
[49:44] holy spirit because otherwise you're
[49:46] just a child and remember you might be
[49:48] you might he said the scripture says
[49:50] though an heir yet still only a son just
[49:53] like a servant you're just like a
[49:54] servant because you haven't matured and
[49:56] it takes the Holy Spirit to tutor us and
[49:58] guide us and we've got these carnal
[50:00] bodies and these carnal minds and we've
[50:01] got these experiences and we've got
[50:03] emotions and all these things that have
[50:05] to be brought subject to the word and
[50:07] we're brought subject by the spirit
[50:09] that's the thing that overcomes us amen
[50:11] but once you get that Holy Ghost you are
[50:13] changed forever you are changed forever
[50:15] and I mean I believe everyone here
[50:17] that's got the Holy Ghost can say from
[50:19] that day on I was never the same again
[50:21] and I praise the Lord for that I wasn't
[50:23] perfect but I was never the same again
[50:25] amen there was no going back to what I
[50:27] used to be and so we always grow and
[50:29] mature in Christ in this walk and we
[50:31] can't we can't ever come to the place
[50:33] where we say I've made it we'll make it
[50:35] when we're gone we'll make it when we're
[50:37] gone amen you know I was reading in
[50:39] judges we're talking about Authority by
[50:41] position and the moving of the spirit in
[50:43] our lives and it was talking about
[50:44] Samson and it says this we're talking
[50:47] about the idea of progression here it
[50:49] says and the spirit of the Lord began to
[50:52] move him at times in the camp of Dan
[50:55] between zor and tell in other words it
[50:58] didn't say Samson just got all of this
[50:59] anointing and with that came all of this
[51:02] power all the time that's not the way
[51:04] Samson worked and that's not the way God
[51:06] worked God started what working in
[51:09] Samson's life and began to work in his
[51:12] life at times and so he began to move on
[51:16] Samson to do this and Samson to do that
[51:18] and what's God trying to do he's trying
[51:19] to get Samson to realize what his call
[51:21] is in his life and he's also testing
[51:24] Samson to see what he's going to do and
[51:26] when look at Samson we're going to spend
[51:28] more time with David this morning but or
[51:30] this afternoon but but Samson you'll see
[51:32] has an occasional experience with the
[51:34] spirit do you ever notice that in
[51:35] scripture Samson lived just like the
[51:37] rest of us do as normal people if we
[51:40] wanted to put it that way but then it
[51:41] would say and the spirit of the Lord
[51:43] Came Upon Samson and all of a sudden he
[51:45] tears a lion apart or he he goes and
[51:47] catches 300 Foxes or he goes and kills
[51:50] 100 Philistines it's the spirit of God
[51:52] on Samson that made him special or made
[51:55] him powerful brother Brandon was say he
[51:56] was just a runt nothing to look at him
[51:59] he wasn't some big Arnold Schwarzenegger
[52:00] out there but he was a just a normal man
[52:03] but that Spirit would come on him and he
[52:05] would do Mighty Deeds but the problem
[52:07] with Samson is that outside of that
[52:09] anointing he was very flawed and we see
[52:11] what happens is he kept getting into
[52:13] problems with women and these things but
[52:15] yet God continued to use him and he
[52:17] judged Israel for 20 years without any
[52:20] issues but then he got caught up in
[52:22] something else and even in that God used
[52:25] him and the spirit of God came on on him
[52:26] and he killed more in his death than he
[52:28] had killed in his entire
[52:30] life that's what the anointing will do
[52:32] on a person but we want to see David
[52:34] because David's experience with the
[52:36] anointing is different than Samson's and
[52:38] we see a much greater progression with
[52:40] with David here amen we'll see that
[52:43] David has he he gets this anointing he
[52:46] moves towards being a king but yet he
[52:48] never does it himself the anointing is
[52:50] what makes the difference now I want to
[52:52] take us back and we're just going to go
[52:53] through this quickly I know that brother
[52:54] Paul has spoken on this and and many
[52:57] times I've even spoken on it so I just
[52:59] want to lay a bit of a foundation on it
[53:01] here and it says and Samuel said unto
[53:03] Jesse are here all thy children and he
[53:06] said There remaineth Yet the youngest
[53:08] and behold he keepeth the sheep and
[53:10] Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch
[53:12] him for will not sit down till he come
[53:14] hither and he sent and brought him in
[53:16] now he was Ruddy and with all of a
[53:18] beautiful countenance and goodly to look
[53:20] to and the Lord said arise anoint him
[53:23] for this is he the youngest the least
[53:25] significant
[53:26] it says then Samuel took the Horn of oil
[53:29] and anointed him in the midst of his
[53:30] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[53:33] Upon David from that day forward so
[53:36] Samuel rose up and went to Rama so we
[53:39] see here this picture where all of the
[53:41] young men that that are the sons of
[53:42] Jesse have come before before Samuel and
[53:45] each one looks good to him from the
[53:47] youngest all the way down to the second
[53:48] youngest and each one he thinks would be
[53:50] a good King but God says no it's not him
[53:52] it's not him it's not him and then and
[53:54] then David comes up and he says this is
[53:56] is the one and there's nothing looking
[53:59] at David that would suggest there's
[54:00] kingly material inside of him that's the
[54:03] that's the sight of God that's the
[54:04] sovereignty of God as he sees the inside
[54:07] of the inside and he knows what he's
[54:08] ordained for each and every purpose but
[54:11] David gets his anointing to be king here
[54:13] and historians believe he was only 12 or
[54:15] 13 years old here can you imagine you
[54:18] that are 12 or 13 or 14 you've got a
[54:20] king anointing on you and this isn't
[54:22] just un anointing church this is the
[54:25] spirit of God there's only one the
[54:28] spirit and that's the holy spirit this
[54:29] is the spirit of God on David as a 12 or
[54:33] 13year old and the purpose of this
[54:35] anointing is to do what mature him to
[54:39] the place where he can be a king it's a
[54:42] king anointing and the anointing that's
[54:44] on you will bring you to your position
[54:47] amen it will bring you to position and
[54:49] how does it do that it prepares you and
[54:52] it places you in the situations you need
[54:54] to be in to get you to learn learn what
[54:56] you need to learn amen that's what the
[54:58] purpose of the holy spirit is is to
[55:00] bring us into maturity so we can step
[55:02] into our purpose in the body of Christ
[55:05] that's what we're here to do amen each
[55:07] and every one of us it brings us to our
[55:09] original condition is really what it's
[55:11] doing amen but it gives you three main
[55:13] things it gives you overcoming power
[55:16] first and foremost over yourself that's
[55:20] what maturity is is when you put self
[55:23] aside amen when we look at us as a as
[55:26] spouses when we look at ourselves as
[55:28] adults and when we look at ourselves as
[55:30] parents maturity comes when you can set
[55:32] selfishness aside and you can act based
[55:35] on what's right and good rather than
[55:37] what's best for
[55:38] you second thing it gives us so it's
[55:41] first power over yourself the Holy
[55:43] Spirit the second thing that gives you
[55:44] is power over the world and the things
[55:46] of the world it separates you amen it
[55:50] separates you from those things from
[55:52] from ungodly influences from the lusts
[55:54] of the flesh from all these things that
[55:55] Satan throw at us and then the third
[55:57] thing after he you the the Holy Spirit
[56:00] conquers you is he conquers those things
[56:02] that are around you and that's when you
[56:04] step into position and now it's power
[56:06] over Satan and his kingdom and that's
[56:08] where you have the the the the power and
[56:10] the authority now for liberty for for
[56:12] casting out demons for Healing The Sick
[56:14] for for prayers having a real effect in
[56:16] these different things it's Ministry
[56:18] time then that's the third effect of of
[56:20] the Holy Spirit remember what brother
[56:22] Bram said he says the holy spirit is
[56:24] power for what
[56:27] service service so the first thing it
[56:30] does is It prepares you for service and
[56:33] then it gets you to live the word and
[56:36] then it gets you to act by the word amen
[56:38] It prepares you and then it starts to
[56:40] push you out into service for the people
[56:42] around you and we see that this happens
[56:44] with David because that anointing on
[56:46] David took him from a Shepherd to a
[56:48] warrior Shepherd to a political Shepherd
[56:51] if we want to call it that way to a
[56:53] musical shepherd He was the greatest
[56:55] Shepherd ever until Christ came he
[56:58] turned a God turned that anointing
[57:00] turned David into a Shepherd the world
[57:01] had never seen before this was a a young
[57:04] man that that developed the reputation
[57:07] for being great just by being out with
[57:10] Sheep amen we look at at David and and
[57:13] we see that God doesn't need us to go
[57:15] find a place for him to work on us God
[57:18] will take us exactly where we need to be
[57:21] and he'll bring every situation and
[57:23] every influence and every training bit
[57:25] our way to to get us to what he needs us
[57:27] to be we don't have David didn't have to
[57:29] go look him for a fight the fight came
[57:31] to David the lion came to David the bear
[57:33] came to David Goliath came to David
[57:36] David didn't go seeking a fight David
[57:38] didn't go seeking training David didn't
[57:41] seek anything David went to where God
[57:43] wanted him to be and he stayed there and
[57:46] in that staying God trained him into
[57:49] exactly what David was supposed to be
[57:51] God put him in situations that required
[57:53] him to step up in his walk with god
[57:55] listen to this brother B says and each
[57:57] one of us is born for something we
[57:59] weren't just put here for nothing that
[58:02] mountain he says never happened out
[58:04] there just to be that tree was put there
[58:06] for a purpose everything is for a
[58:08] purpose it's God to serve he says and
[58:11] we're here for a purpose don't despise
[58:14] where God has got you don't despise
[58:16] where God has got you imagine David now
[58:19] and he's he's watching over the sheep
[58:21] and if he was caral he'd be saying
[58:24] oh I'm supposed to be a The King and I
[58:27] could be out there learning to fight and
[58:29] train and I could be doing so much more
[58:32] with my life no David wasn't out there
[58:35] sighing and crying for for the miserable
[58:37] Place God had placed him David was happy
[58:40] to be doing what he was doing he didn't
[58:43] despise where God had put him he says
[58:45] but serve your purpose there's coming a
[58:48] great Victory Day one of these days
[58:50] where the battle is over so God knows
[58:53] how to prepare us and he takes us there
[58:56] his way not our way it's always a path
[58:58] of his choing choosing knowing what
[59:01] we're supposed to be I've said this
[59:03] before doesn't make us ready to be it
[59:06] amen knowing you're supposed to be a
[59:08] king doesn't make you ready to be a king
[59:10] we know that because God didn't Place
[59:12] David for 15 more years after Goliath he
[59:15] wasn't ready to be it though he was
[59:17] anointed yet he had to be prepared amen
[59:20] David's exploits all came after his
[59:22] anointing he didn't kill the lion he
[59:24] didn't kill the bear until after he was
[59:26] anointed he doesn't come to Goliath
[59:28] until he's anointed as well and these
[59:30] things take years and years it takes
[59:32] time and God knows how to work it out so
[59:34] that when the situation comes up we're
[59:36] ready for it amen you say I don't know
[59:39] how I'm going to handle where I'm at in
[59:40] my life I don't know how to handle the
[59:42] troubles that have come up listen God
[59:44] has prepared you if you're a holy ghost
[59:45] filled son or daughter of God God has
[59:48] prepared you for this moment amen he's
[59:51] prepared you he knows how to work it out
[59:53] brother BR says this he says God trains
[59:55] men and bring brings them up he says
[59:57] it's his purpose it's his purpose that
[1:00:00] he's preparing you for and it's his
[1:00:02] purpose to prepare you for those things
[1:00:05] he says time is with man see we get
[1:00:06] caught up in the time element we think
[1:00:09] we've got to push it we've got to rush
[1:00:11] it we've got to get it done the word
[1:00:13] says it's going to happen so we got to
[1:00:14] get it going no God will get it going in
[1:00:17] his time and when he does it he does it
[1:00:19] perfectly and there's no stopping it he
[1:00:21] says time is with man eternity is with
[1:00:24] God and I love what David because David
[1:00:26] never changes himself and David never
[1:00:29] attempts to change his situation in fact
[1:00:31] you'll see David is usually having to
[1:00:33] react by running for his life to keep
[1:00:36] from taking the kingship David's
[1:00:38] actually trying to keep from pressing in
[1:00:40] and grabbing what God has already
[1:00:42] promised him and so David's either
[1:00:43] running for his life or he's protecting
[1:00:45] somebody else from something unjust you
[1:00:48] know that like the most police uh you
[1:00:51] know uh uh divisions and and groups
[1:00:53] their models to Serve and Protect all
[1:00:55] you see with David is to Serve and
[1:00:57] Protect why because that's what Kings do
[1:01:00] is they protect those that are under
[1:01:02] their care and all you see with David is
[1:01:04] he's constantly trying to protect those
[1:01:06] that are around him why there's an
[1:01:08] anointing that's pushing him to do those
[1:01:10] things and placing him inside of those
[1:01:13] positions but you notice he stays right
[1:01:15] where God has put him until his
[1:01:17] authority moves him elsewhere David
[1:01:19] never jumps the queue they never tries
[1:01:21] to get ahead David just goes with the
[1:01:23] flow of what God's doing in his life and
[1:01:26] there's a lesson there brother Brown
[1:01:27] says but brother and sister you better
[1:01:29] know what you're doing he says you
[1:01:32] better be careful and you better be sure
[1:01:35] that you understand he says don't walk
[1:01:37] out there stay right where God's called
[1:01:40] you until you know what you're doing for
[1:01:44] it's a dangerous thing you can't just
[1:01:46] walk around slinging this word you got
[1:01:48] to know that you know that you know that
[1:01:50] God has called you to do certain things
[1:01:53] remember the seven sons of Sia
[1:01:56] in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches
[1:01:58] they tried to cash out Devils what did
[1:02:00] they do they they presumed brother
[1:02:02] brandham said and that devil said those
[1:02:04] Devils said Jesus we know Paul we know
[1:02:08] who are you and it ripped the clothes
[1:02:10] off of them and ran them naked down the
[1:02:13] street it made a laughing stock of the
[1:02:16] gospel because they tried to pretend
[1:02:18] they were something they weren't amen
[1:02:20] David couldn't say I'm anointed to be
[1:02:22] king and therefore I'm going to be a
[1:02:23] king right now no he had to wait for
[1:02:26] that anointing to prepare him before it
[1:02:28] would Place him and we see that David's
[1:02:30] challenges just start ratcheting up and
[1:02:33] up and up and and what he experienced as
[1:02:35] a Shepherd prepared him for his next
[1:02:36] challenge which would be Goliath and we
[1:02:38] see here that it's the basics that are
[1:02:40] drilled into us that'll hold us through
[1:02:42] all the way of our life you don't think
[1:02:45] maybe you young people that what Brother
[1:02:46] Paul's teaching you in Sunday school is
[1:02:48] going to hold you listen let me tell you
[1:02:49] what brother Mark drilled into our heads
[1:02:51] in Sunday school has stayed with me all
[1:02:53] my life because it's the basic
[1:02:56] Simplicity of the gospel and the types
[1:02:59] and shadows that we learned there that
[1:03:00] help me to see things for the way they
[1:03:02] ought to be cuz God never changes God
[1:03:05] never changes you know I've run in my
[1:03:06] time to to many ministers and men that
[1:03:09] they just love to talk about the
[1:03:10] mysteries of God and they love to go
[1:03:12] into these great depths and sometimes
[1:03:14] they get so deep into the word that your
[1:03:16] head starts to spin and you start to
[1:03:18] wonder do I even believe that
[1:03:20] message what am I do I even know what
[1:03:22] they're talking about and you think
[1:03:24] you're left behind but what I realized
[1:03:26] in those situations is bring it back to
[1:03:28] the basics because the basics never
[1:03:31] change and so often what I found with
[1:03:34] those Brothers is you can ask them one
[1:03:35] question from the basics and the whole
[1:03:37] thing falls apart why because they've
[1:03:39] gone to seed on one little quote or one
[1:03:42] portion of a scripture and they
[1:03:44] neglected the entire principles of the
[1:03:46] Bible the basics that are building up
[1:03:48] the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:03:50] basics we get in those times that set us
[1:03:52] up those little things that we think
[1:03:54] don't matter those are the things that
[1:03:56] save our life amen that's the things
[1:03:58] that we hold to it's the simple things
[1:04:00] remember brother BR would talk about
[1:04:01] that story I think it was
[1:04:03] Martin and sorry my voice is kind of bad
[1:04:05] tonight i' I've been struggling with the
[1:04:07] cough the boys had but brother brother
[1:04:08] Brandon was talking I think it was about
[1:04:10] Martin and and remember that that that
[1:04:12] Vision he had or a dream and it was
[1:04:16] Christ that came to him and he says
[1:04:17] Martin do you know me Martin do you know
[1:04:20] me and the prophet says Martin hesitated
[1:04:23] cuz something seemed off and this was a
[1:04:25] great bean and he had Mighty robes and
[1:04:28] and gold and all these things and he
[1:04:29] looked very Majestic and he had a crown
[1:04:32] on his head and he said Martin do you
[1:04:34] know me I am
[1:04:36] Christ and something caught Martin and
[1:04:39] he just he wasn't certain about what was
[1:04:41] happening and so he waited and three or
[1:04:43] four times this this Vision this person
[1:04:46] this this this thing in the vision said
[1:04:48] Martin I'm Christ don't you know me and
[1:04:50] then Martin looked at him and he says
[1:04:52] you can't be him he says because you've
[1:04:54] got a crown and the word says the Saints
[1:04:57] will crown him he says and that thing
[1:04:59] disappeared out of his way what was it
[1:05:01] he knew the word and he applied it to
[1:05:04] what we would often think would
[1:05:06] absolutely be something of God you have
[1:05:08] a supernatural experience you
[1:05:09] automatically think that's of God
[1:05:10] because I'm a Believer no there's a
[1:05:12] whole Supernatural world out there and
[1:05:15] there's Satan and there's God and
[1:05:17] there's two things in there and it was
[1:05:18] his knowledge of the basics of the word
[1:05:20] that caught that one detail cuz
[1:05:22] everything else looked right but then he
[1:05:24] said you can't be Christ because we're
[1:05:25] going to crown him we're going to crown
[1:05:27] him and that's what made the difference
[1:05:29] was that little that little scripture
[1:05:31] that little thing that he knew and it
[1:05:33] caused that Vision to disappear we see
[1:05:36] what David's doing and he's out there
[1:05:37] and he's watching the sheep and maybe
[1:05:39] not much is happening and maybe he
[1:05:41] yearns for excitement and he's wondering
[1:05:43] what the future holds and then one day a
[1:05:45] lion comes out and I don't know what
[1:05:47] happened in previous times when David
[1:05:49] faced a lion maybe he never had I'm sure
[1:05:52] he probably did cuz where there's a lion
[1:05:53] once there's usually a lion before but
[1:05:55] perhaps he's never fought that lion
[1:05:57] maybe he used to run from them but this
[1:05:59] time with the anointing on it David
[1:06:01] doesn't run from the lion he runs to the
[1:06:04] lion completely same situation
[1:06:07] completely different result and the
[1:06:08] scripture says he goes and he grabs him
[1:06:10] by the
[1:06:12] Mane now I don't know if you've ever
[1:06:14] fought a lion but you don't want to be
[1:06:16] where the man is because that means his
[1:06:18] teeth are in front of his man and the
[1:06:21] claws are there to latch on to you and
[1:06:23] rip you apart but David gets right up in
[1:06:25] his grill and he kills a
[1:06:28] lion he kills a
[1:06:30] lion and then after that what happens is
[1:06:33] a bear comes out bigger meaner stronger
[1:06:36] and David kills that bear the same way
[1:06:38] that he kills the lion why not because
[1:06:41] David's anything special but because
[1:06:43] there's an anointing in David that says
[1:06:45] you are called to protect those that are
[1:06:48] under your care that's all David's doing
[1:06:50] he's responding to the situation based
[1:06:53] on the authority that's been given to
[1:06:54] him protect the sheep protect the sheep
[1:06:57] and that anointing gives him confidence
[1:06:59] and faith that he can face whatever is
[1:07:00] in his in front of
[1:07:02] him why was David confident David was
[1:07:06] confident because he knew that he hadn't
[1:07:07] placed himself there he hadn't picked
[1:07:10] his
[1:07:10] anointing he didn't choose any of this
[1:07:14] God had placed him God had anointed him
[1:07:16] God had chosen him God had ordained him
[1:07:19] and therefore David's confident was that
[1:07:21] confidence was that God was doing a work
[1:07:24] he also knew
[1:07:26] he had to be a king and if you're if
[1:07:29] God's given you a vision of what you're
[1:07:31] going to be you can have confidence
[1:07:32] he'll take you through what you're
[1:07:33] facing even if it's a lion even if it's
[1:07:36] a bear it's a wonderful thing to know
[1:07:37] you're going in a Rapture church because
[1:07:39] nothing here can take you nothing can
[1:07:41] stop you nothing can separate separate
[1:07:43] you from the love of God David's facing
[1:07:46] what's in front of him because he's
[1:07:48] placed based on God's
[1:07:51] choosing mamas you're placed to protect
[1:07:55] your house you're anointed to protect
[1:07:58] your house and you're anointed to kick
[1:08:00] out anything that tries to come in there
[1:08:02] dad's you're anointed even above your
[1:08:04] wife to kick out anything that Satan
[1:08:06] tries to place in your family in your
[1:08:08] relationship in your home in your
[1:08:10] bodies just make sure you didn't bring
[1:08:12] it in just make sure you didn't bring it
[1:08:15] in you know it's interesting that with
[1:08:18] our youngest he he's got an interesting
[1:08:20] personality as many of us know and
[1:08:22] there's certain things that set him off
[1:08:24] and it's up to us to protect him from
[1:08:26] those things CU by his choosing he won't
[1:08:29] protect himself from it there's things
[1:08:30] he likes to do that don't help him and
[1:08:33] we've got to protect him we can't blame
[1:08:35] him for what happens if we don't protect
[1:08:36] him from it if we allow it if we're the
[1:08:39] ones that bring it into the home as the
[1:08:40] case may be amen so we are we are
[1:08:43] anointed to take care of whatever Satan
[1:08:45] tries to throw in front of us like
[1:08:48] brother Braham says you don't have to
[1:08:49] take that box of rattlesnakes you don't
[1:08:51] have to take it Satan will try and get
[1:08:53] you to sign for it you're anointed to
[1:08:54] turn it and say send back to sender we
[1:08:57] don't want that in this house listen to
[1:08:59] this brother Bram says this he says any
[1:09:01] man here that's been circumcised by the
[1:09:03] spirit of God that's been born again he
[1:09:06] says any of you people that's sick the
[1:09:08] devil's a bluff he'll rob you he'll pale
[1:09:11] your cheeks he'll do everything he can
[1:09:14] but you don't have to stand for it no
[1:09:16] longer now catch what he says here you
[1:09:18] say I'm not a
[1:09:21] preacher cuz we think it's got to be an
[1:09:23] apostle it's got to be a member of the
[1:09:24] fivefold ministry to these things out to
[1:09:26] deal with it he he says you say I'm not
[1:09:28] a preacher he says but you're a
[1:09:32] Christian you're a Christian he says
[1:09:35] shamgar didn't know how to fight nowhere
[1:09:39] in scripture does it say shamgar was a
[1:09:41] trained
[1:09:42] Warrior it says you say I don't know
[1:09:45] nothing about faith he says step out
[1:09:48] anyhow yes sir he says I was going to a
[1:09:51] football stadium one day and I saw a
[1:09:54] little thing that hanging on the wall
[1:09:56] that always struck me it's he said it's
[1:09:59] not the size of the dog in the fight
[1:10:01] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[1:10:03] that's what does it if you're a big dog
[1:10:05] and just a coward you'll get whipped
[1:10:07] anytime I remember when I was living in
[1:10:10] Mount Pearl and we were playing hockey
[1:10:12] one time and there was this big guy that
[1:10:13] we used to play hockey with and he was
[1:10:16] just a
[1:10:17] bully and he was pushing his weight
[1:10:20] around and you know it's you're just
[1:10:21] playing on the street it's not supposed
[1:10:22] to be that physical and he was throwing
[1:10:24] his weight around and so one day I let
[1:10:26] him have it and you know what he
[1:10:29] practically cried and then he never
[1:10:31] bothered us anymore sometimes all we've
[1:10:33] got to do is turn around and say Satan
[1:10:35] that's enough and lay down the law and
[1:10:39] say No More Bullies are weak at heart
[1:10:44] and all they're hoping is that you don't
[1:10:45] realize how how truly weak they are
[1:10:48] remember he says Satan's just a bluff
[1:10:50] and he's hoping you don't realize how
[1:10:52] strong you are he says you could be a
[1:10:54] little puppy and a lot of grit and you
[1:10:57] could put the enemy running anytime now
[1:10:59] catch this he says it's the size of the
[1:11:02] god of Heaven that's in the
[1:11:05] heart it's not about you in the first
[1:11:07] place it's the size of the god of Heaven
[1:11:09] that's in the heart he says and he's a
[1:11:11] big God and a good one that covers all
[1:11:14] space and time he says sure what the
[1:11:17] church needs tonight is another getting
[1:11:18] back to God realize that it's the spirit
[1:11:21] of God in you that's going to do the
[1:11:22] work
[1:11:23] anyways amen it's the spirit of God that
[1:11:26] makes the difference in all of these
[1:11:27] situations and we see with David the
[1:11:30] spirit of God is just raising up and
[1:11:32] it's raising up and there's something in
[1:11:34] him that's coming up that's never come
[1:11:36] up before and no doubt he's sitting
[1:11:38] there saying what is this what is this I
[1:11:40] often wonder his thoughts as he's
[1:11:41] running towards that Lon in that bear as
[1:11:43] he's saying what are you doing what are
[1:11:45] you doing stop stop stop but I believe
[1:11:47] there's something that was screaming in
[1:11:48] him you're you're more than able you're
[1:11:51] more than able to do this there was a
[1:11:53] what it was the authority of God Rising
[1:11:55] ing up inside of him and saying you're
[1:11:56] anointed to deal with this
[1:12:01] situation we need to recognize our
[1:12:05] anointing finally David Gets a change of
[1:12:08] scenery and he's Out Among the sheep for
[1:12:10] a couple years and then we know he goes
[1:12:11] to Saul and he does his musical bit but
[1:12:14] then David has a change of scenery it's
[1:12:15] not by his choosing but rather his dad
[1:12:18] comes up and he says listen I need you
[1:12:19] to take some cheese down to brother Mark
[1:12:21] coffee down there and the captain of
[1:12:23] your of your brothers and go down and
[1:12:25] see how things are going 10 cheeses he
[1:12:28] had to have been a coffee brother
[1:12:30] Mark 10 cheeses for one
[1:12:32] Captain
[1:12:35] wow but his dad says just look you've
[1:12:38] been a good shepherd now be an Aaron boy
[1:12:40] go down and see how the battle's going
[1:12:42] see if you can do something down there
[1:12:44] and we know that as David comes up to
[1:12:46] the to the Army and to the camp that
[1:12:48] David or Goliath comes out and he issues
[1:12:50] his
[1:12:51] Challenge and David hears the challenge
[1:12:54] and remember David's anointing is always
[1:12:57] go forward and accept the challenge
[1:12:59] that's the that's the power of the holy
[1:13:01] spirit in a Christian is it'll say
[1:13:03] accept the challenge accept the
[1:13:05] challenge every time and God's putting
[1:13:07] him in these situations now remember we
[1:13:10] read last service where where the
[1:13:12] scripture says God said to Joshua he
[1:13:14] said be
[1:13:15] courageous and what did he have to be
[1:13:17] courageous with keep the word in your
[1:13:19] mouth keep speaking the word keep saying
[1:13:22] the word why because you're establishing
[1:13:25] your rights and you're also reminding
[1:13:27] yourselves who you are and what you
[1:13:29] really believe we're forgetful hearers
[1:13:32] we're forgetful hearers you know it was
[1:13:35] funny I was talking with my wife today
[1:13:37] we were talking about special meetings
[1:13:38] she said boy I just don't remember
[1:13:40] anything that brother said that's why we
[1:13:42] need to be reminded all the time is in
[1:13:44] the moment it's great but we got to have
[1:13:46] that continuing sustaining that
[1:13:48] continuing hearing that continuing
[1:13:49] feeding on the word of God and David
[1:13:52] comes up here and he's he's been a king
[1:13:54] over the sheep and he been a king that
[1:13:56] conquered the lion and he's a king over
[1:13:57] the bear and now David's word that he
[1:14:00] has to be courageous with is you're a
[1:14:01] king that's anointed to protect and
[1:14:03] serve and so he sees Goliath and all of
[1:14:05] a sudden what happens the king anointing
[1:14:07] is rising up inside of David he can't
[1:14:09] help it and watch what he does it says
[1:14:12] and David spoke to the men that stood by
[1:14:14] him saying what shall be done to the man
[1:14:16] that kth this Philistine and taketh away
[1:14:18] the reproach from Israel David is
[1:14:21] already saying what am I going to get
[1:14:23] when I kill this guy
[1:14:25] I love that about a son or daughter of
[1:14:28] God says what's the reward when I have
[1:14:30] the victory what's going to come out of
[1:14:33] this it says for who is this
[1:14:35] uncircumcised Philistine that he should
[1:14:37] defy the armies of the Living God and
[1:14:39] the P people answered him after this
[1:14:41] manner saying so shall it be done to the
[1:14:43] man that kth him remember they they'd be
[1:14:45] taxfree the rest of their life and he'd
[1:14:47] get to marry Saul's daughter it says and
[1:14:50] elab his oldest brother heard what he
[1:14:52] spake unto the man and eliab's anger was
[1:14:54] kindled against David and he said why
[1:14:56] camest thou down hither and with whom
[1:14:58] has thou left those few sheep in the
[1:15:00] wilderness look he's putting down David
[1:15:03] Church David's the only one that's got
[1:15:06] the courage to speak and somebody's
[1:15:08] already trying to rip the testimony out
[1:15:09] of his
[1:15:11] life the few sheep he's minimizing you
[1:15:14] weren't even much of a Shepherd it was
[1:15:15] just a few sheep and who how come you're
[1:15:17] down here and who did you leave back
[1:15:19] there to take care of those few sheep he
[1:15:22] says I Know Thy pride and the
[1:15:23] naughtiness of thine heart for thou art
[1:15:25] come down that thou might seat the
[1:15:27] battle he's saying David you're not even
[1:15:29] supposed to be here you've been
[1:15:30] disobedient to come out here you need to
[1:15:32] go back to your little job and leave
[1:15:33] this to the men what have the men been
[1:15:35] doing cowering in their tents doing
[1:15:37] absolutely
[1:15:39] nothing says and David said what have I
[1:15:42] now
[1:15:43] done is there not a cause persecution
[1:15:46] Without a Cause is the Hallmark of every
[1:15:48] Christian they'll tear you down for no
[1:15:50] good reason and really eliab's pride is
[1:15:53] probably the thing that's most hurt here
[1:15:55] he's the oldest he didn't get to be
[1:15:56] anointed king and he hasn't done
[1:15:57] anything about Goliath and now his
[1:15:59] little brother did get the anointing is
[1:16:01] coming in and saying I'll take care of
[1:16:02] that L that giant for
[1:16:04] you it says and he turned from him
[1:16:06] toward another and spake after the same
[1:16:08] manner and the people answered him again
[1:16:10] after the former Manner and when the
[1:16:11] words were heard which David spake they
[1:16:13] rehearsed them before Saul and he sent
[1:16:15] for him and David said to Saul let no
[1:16:18] man I love this
[1:16:20] church young men young sisters this is
[1:16:23] what a 15-year-old with the the Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost can
[1:16:26] do what's our excuse brothers and
[1:16:29] sisters he says let no man's heart fail
[1:16:32] him because of him thy servant will go
[1:16:35] and fight with this with this Philistine
[1:16:37] in other words don't be scared everyone
[1:16:40] I'll save you says the
[1:16:42] 15-year-old can you imagine what this
[1:16:44] looks
[1:16:45] like I don't like to pick on people but
[1:16:48] can you imagine my son Jonathan standing
[1:16:50] up and saying I've got this everyone
[1:16:53] it's going to be okay I'm going to kill
[1:16:55] the
[1:16:58] 10-footer it's ludicrous it's
[1:17:03] Madness but David steps up before the
[1:17:05] king and he says I've got
[1:17:08] this and Saul said to David Thou Art not
[1:17:10] able to go against the Philistine to
[1:17:12] fight with him for thou art but a youth
[1:17:14] and he's a man of war from his youth
[1:17:16] watch this D Saul's saying look David I
[1:17:18] appreciate the attitude I I like the can
[1:17:21] do attitude but you got to realize this
[1:17:23] guy's been fighting since he was
[1:17:24] kneehigh to Grasshopper And you barely
[1:17:26] come up to his
[1:17:27] knee he can beat you with one he can
[1:17:29] beat you with both hands tied behind his
[1:17:30] back he'd probably just kick you to
[1:17:32] death David you don't have a chance
[1:17:33] against this
[1:17:35] guy I like your faith I like your
[1:17:39] testimony but that's not going to cut it
[1:17:42] this is the real deal
[1:17:44] now but Watch God's training hasn't been
[1:17:47] lost on David David knows exactly who he
[1:17:51] is and he knows why He's
[1:17:53] there cuz there's something rising up
[1:17:55] inside of David that's saying go forward
[1:17:58] and take the challenge answer his bluff
[1:18:01] it says and David said unto Saul thy
[1:18:02] servant kept his father's sheep and
[1:18:05] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[1:18:06] lamb out of the flock now watch this
[1:18:08] past experiences are being applied to
[1:18:09] Future experiences he says and I went
[1:18:12] out after him and smote him and
[1:18:13] delivered it out of his mouth and when
[1:18:15] he arose against me I caught him by his
[1:18:17] beard and smote him and slew him see
[1:18:19] David's got experience on his
[1:18:21] side that's the thing that Satan can't
[1:18:23] beat out of you as your experience in
[1:18:25] God when you know you've met God when
[1:18:27] you know he's real when you know he's
[1:18:29] personal Satan can't take that from you
[1:18:31] and all he can do is try and get you
[1:18:33] focused on circumstances rather than the
[1:18:34] realities of God in your life and
[1:18:36] David's got a great memory he's saying
[1:18:38] no no no you don't understand I've been
[1:18:40] in impossible circumstances before let
[1:18:43] me tell you about him amen he's got a
[1:18:45] revelation of what it means to beat
[1:18:47] something that he can't
[1:18:49] beat it says thy servant slew both The
[1:18:52] Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:18:55] shall be as one of them seeing he had
[1:18:56] defied the armies of the Living God
[1:18:59] David is the only one there that
[1:19:01] remembers that he's a living God Saul's
[1:19:03] had victories Saul's had Miracles Saul's
[1:19:07] had God doing all sorts of wonderful
[1:19:09] things and then a big giant Rises up and
[1:19:11] all of a sudden he forgets all about
[1:19:13] it and David said moreover the Lord that
[1:19:16] delivered me out of the Paw of the lion
[1:19:18] and out of this paw the bear he will
[1:19:20] deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:19:21] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:19:25] and the Lord be with thee David says
[1:19:28] listen when you've beaten one impossible
[1:19:29] enemy then you've beaten them all it's
[1:19:31] not about me he says the Lord the Lord
[1:19:34] that's with me is going to beat him it's
[1:19:36] not going to be me he delivered me he
[1:19:39] doesn't say I killed he doesn't say I
[1:19:41] defeated he says God delivered me God
[1:19:43] kept me safe while I was in the line of
[1:19:45] duty that's what David's walking in here
[1:19:47] amen he's saying what I know who am I
[1:19:49] whom I believed and I'm persuaded that
[1:19:52] he's able to keep that which I've
[1:19:54] committed to him against that day David
[1:19:56] knows exactly who he is Goliath is no
[1:19:59] different in David's eyes than a lion or
[1:20:01] a bear in fact Goliath is below them
[1:20:04] because those were just brw animals
[1:20:06] Goliath is uncircumcised David is
[1:20:08] circumcised David has a covenant that
[1:20:11] tells him that you can destroy anything
[1:20:13] that's uncircumcised David has a word
[1:20:15] promised for Goliath that he didn't have
[1:20:17] for The Lion and the bear David's on
[1:20:19] more sure ground with this 10-foot giant
[1:20:21] than he was with the lion and the bear
[1:20:22] he's got a word covenant that applies to
[1:20:24] him
[1:20:25] and he knows where he's standing
[1:20:27] amen but I want you to see and we're not
[1:20:29] going to read it for the sake of time
[1:20:30] but right after this what a Saul say he
[1:20:33] says here's my armor here's my sword
[1:20:35] take them out and what does David say I
[1:20:37] can't take those he says they haven't
[1:20:39] been tried they haven't been tested they
[1:20:42] haven't been proven with me David's
[1:20:43] saying your experience won't get me
[1:20:45] through this battle Saul the biggest
[1:20:48] problem we have is we're relying on
[1:20:49] somebody else's experience or we're
[1:20:51] trying to get somebody else's experience
[1:20:53] and that's their experience it's it's
[1:20:54] not yours you've got to live your life
[1:20:56] and I've got to live mine and God deals
[1:20:58] with you differently than he deals with
[1:21:00] me and he prepares you differently than
[1:21:02] he prepares me you know it's something
[1:21:04] that I've seen often and often brother
[1:21:06] brother uh Brandon was talking about
[1:21:08] this in a quote I was reading and he
[1:21:09] says you you'll see a church and God
[1:21:11] will move in that church and he'll bring
[1:21:13] a certain gift or a certain Ministry and
[1:21:16] God will bless it tremendously and you
[1:21:18] know what happens every other Church
[1:21:19] wants that gift and they want that
[1:21:21] blessing and so what do they do is they
[1:21:23] mimic it
[1:21:25] and brother Bram says when you mimic it
[1:21:27] it always fails and it brings a reproach
[1:21:29] on the gospel because it's not yours if
[1:21:33] David went out in Saul's armor he'd have
[1:21:36] died why he doesn't know how to fight in
[1:21:39] armor he doesn't need armor it's just
[1:21:42] going to get in the way armor makes you
[1:21:45] self-reliant David goes out with only
[1:21:48] what God has proven to be able to use
[1:21:50] with him and that's a Shepherd staff and
[1:21:53] a sling
[1:21:56] that's it that's what David walks out at
[1:21:59] amen no armor no sword he didn't need a
[1:22:02] sword Goliath would do just fine Goliath
[1:22:05] provided all the sword that David needed
[1:22:07] and so he heads out there and God's
[1:22:09] prepared David for this encounter just
[1:22:11] by giving him a time with the
[1:22:14] Sheep the Simplicity of the preparation
[1:22:16] of God church we can look at our lives
[1:22:19] and so often it seems like it's not a
[1:22:20] whole lot going on let me tell you
[1:22:22] there's more happening than you realize
[1:22:24] you know my wife asked me the other day
[1:22:25] she said How's your shoulder doing I
[1:22:27] said you know because why it's so slow
[1:22:31] in its growth back to normal that you
[1:22:34] can't tell day to day but what'll happen
[1:22:36] is a month from now I'll do something
[1:22:37] that I couldn't do a month before and
[1:22:40] then I'll know that I've been growing
[1:22:42] but in the meantime I don't notice it
[1:22:43] dayto day as a Believer if you're
[1:22:46] feeding on the word of God if you're
[1:22:49] spending time in the presence of God
[1:22:51] you're growing whether you realize it or
[1:22:52] not look at little Rafi how much has
[1:22:56] Rafi grown in the last 6 months he's a
[1:22:58] beast now right why just eating and
[1:23:04] sleeping if you read your Bible and you
[1:23:07] pray you're going to
[1:23:11] grow maybe just that much a day but you
[1:23:14] put a 100 days of that together and all
[1:23:16] of a sudden you grown in an
[1:23:17] inch just the little
[1:23:20] things it's simple it's not complicated
[1:23:24] but it requires that
[1:23:26] faithfulness that Simplicity of purpose
[1:23:30] to sayl I want to be with you and I want
[1:23:33] to be in your presence and I want to
[1:23:35] dwell on the right things David knew
[1:23:37] what God could do with a sling and a
[1:23:40] Shepherd staff that's all he
[1:23:42] needed he knew what he could do brother
[1:23:45] says this he says David he knew he was
[1:23:47] anointed and was Vindicated to be a good
[1:23:49] shot David's experience is supporting
[1:23:52] him as he moves into a new challenge he
[1:23:54] says he knew that they knew he was a
[1:23:55] good shot David was anointed he knew it
[1:23:58] but when he stood before Goliath he
[1:23:59] never cried oh God what must I do now I
[1:24:02] know what you did in the times past you
[1:24:04] let me kill a bear you let me kill a
[1:24:05] lion but what about this Goliath out
[1:24:07] here huh he says he never did that he
[1:24:09] just spoke and what did he say he said
[1:24:12] you will be like they
[1:24:17] are that's not
[1:24:19] Cockiness that's
[1:24:22] experience if you know you can it's not
[1:24:24] being
[1:24:25] cocky
[1:24:27] right he says you will be like they were
[1:24:30] he spoke and what did he do he went
[1:24:32] forward he never prayed a prayer he
[1:24:34] never offered nothing he knew he was
[1:24:36] anointed amen he was anointed and that
[1:24:38] slingshot had proved the right kind of a
[1:24:41] thing he had faith in his anointing
[1:24:44] church you've got to know your anointed
[1:24:47] you've got to know you've got the Holy
[1:24:48] Ghost and if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:24:50] you've got to have faith that God has
[1:24:51] given it to you for a purpose and it
[1:24:53] comes with authority
[1:24:55] he says he had faith that God could
[1:24:57] direct that rock right straight in the
[1:24:59] middle of that helmet there where the
[1:25:01] only place could be hit he was standing
[1:25:04] there he knew he was a good shot in
[1:25:06] other words he knew he had something to
[1:25:08] contribute but that in itself would not
[1:25:10] do
[1:25:13] it notice he says he was standing there
[1:25:17] God needed somebody to stand there so he
[1:25:19] could use them somebody had to go out
[1:25:21] and face the giant that's all all God
[1:25:25] needed he says he knew he was a good
[1:25:27] shot he knew God had made him that he
[1:25:29] knew he had killed a lion he knew he had
[1:25:31] killed a bear but that was Cash oh
[1:25:33] Hallelujah he says that was with his
[1:25:35] Earthly father's possession he says here
[1:25:38] is his Heavenly father's possession
[1:25:41] that's just money that's just jobs
[1:25:43] that's just a house that's just a car
[1:25:45] but now it's
[1:25:47] Souls amen it's his children it's his
[1:25:50] precious elect bride it's the ones that
[1:25:53] he is going to come and die
[1:25:54] for it's his
[1:25:57] people if God will do that for our jobs
[1:26:00] if God will do that for our possessions
[1:26:02] Church what will he do for the souls
[1:26:03] that are in our
[1:26:06] care
[1:26:08] amen when the situation gets elevated to
[1:26:11] things that really matter that's when
[1:26:13] our confidence ought to elevate with it
[1:26:15] and say if God's with us in the little
[1:26:16] things that really don't matter he's
[1:26:18] definitely with us in the things that
[1:26:20] matter Above All Else amen he says amen
[1:26:24] he didn't get down what must I do now
[1:26:25] Lord he spoke and said you will be like
[1:26:28] The Lion and the bear and here I come he
[1:26:33] didn't wait for Goliath to start the
[1:26:34] battle he said it's I'm bringing it amen
[1:26:38] glory to God yes sir he spoke and went
[1:26:40] forward to meet this Goliath he says
[1:26:42] regardless of his
[1:26:45] size he was a little Ruddy looking
[1:26:47] fellow you know he wasn't very big now
[1:26:49] regardless of his size and his so-called
[1:26:52] ability to do so you know the Bishop
[1:26:54] told him said now look here son this man
[1:26:56] is a theologian sees a fighter he was
[1:26:58] born a fighter and he's been a fighter
[1:27:00] from his Youth and you're no match for
[1:27:03] him church people will look at you and
[1:27:05] say you can't do
[1:27:07] it I don't know why believers do
[1:27:10] this but somebody steps out in faith and
[1:27:12] they say I don't think you should do
[1:27:14] that if you got faith to do it go do it
[1:27:16] brother B says you may have I may not
[1:27:18] have faith to do it but if you have
[1:27:20] faith to do it I'm not going to stand in
[1:27:21] your way I'm not going to want to beat
[1:27:23] you down that's the sign of somebody
[1:27:25] that's got pride is they're trying to
[1:27:26] bring you down to where they are rather
[1:27:28] than let you get ahead of them amen some
[1:27:31] of the greatest miracles in the Bible
[1:27:33] came to the simplest and humblest of
[1:27:35] people that's who God uses that's who
[1:27:38] God calls it's just Little People Like
[1:27:41] Us it's not big shots big shots are not
[1:27:45] in the economy of God it's a bunch of
[1:27:46] little simple
[1:27:48] people God will say or people will say
[1:27:52] better people than you have tried this
[1:27:55] greater Christians than you have
[1:27:57] believed on this and they never got it
[1:27:59] what hope do you have that's Satan he's
[1:28:02] trying to make you look at yourself
[1:28:04] trying to make you look at yourself
[1:28:05] David was walking out there with a
[1:28:07] covenant it wasn't with an idea it
[1:28:09] wasn't just his well I'm going to be a
[1:28:11] big shot no David was walking out under
[1:28:13] a covenant he knew where he stood on the
[1:28:16] word and that's what he was walking out
[1:28:18] and the anointing in him was what
[1:28:19] bringing that word to fulfillment that's
[1:28:21] what it was doing listen to this
[1:28:24] very familiar scripture but God had
[1:28:30] chosen chosen that's specific that's
[1:28:36] intent God had chosen the foolish things
[1:28:40] of the world to confound the wise and
[1:28:44] God had chosen the weak things of the
[1:28:48] world to confound the things which are
[1:28:51] Mighty you know what if you say I'm a
[1:28:53] weakling here's your scripture God has
[1:28:56] chosen you to confound the wise and to
[1:29:00] confound the things that are Mighty you
[1:29:01] know what that word confound means it
[1:29:03] means disgrace to bring to shame to put
[1:29:07] to utter confusion and to frustrate now
[1:29:10] this is probably best put into sporting
[1:29:12] terms it's when you're playing a
[1:29:15] football game and the little guy that's
[1:29:17] 5 foot 8 knocks down the the 6'4 300
[1:29:21] pounder people love an Underdog Story
[1:29:23] they love a David and Goliath and what
[1:29:25] Paul is saying here is he's saying the
[1:29:26] little guys they're built to win God
[1:29:30] chooses the little guys so that they
[1:29:32] know it's not in them to do it that it's
[1:29:34] God that's doing it and yet the
[1:29:35] victories keep coming and coming and
[1:29:37] coming Amen brother Chad the contracts
[1:29:40] keep coming the jobs keep coming the
[1:29:42] victories keep coming the healings keep
[1:29:45] coming what is it it's God saying I'm
[1:29:48] with you I'm in you press forward take
[1:29:53] heart have have faith I've chosen you to
[1:29:58] frustrate I love that because remember
[1:30:00] what demons are they're
[1:30:02] tormentors and what does it cause
[1:30:04] frustration guess what we're supposed to
[1:30:06] frustrate Satan more than he's supposed
[1:30:08] to frustrate us we're chosen of God to
[1:30:11] frustrate Satan we're chosen to
[1:30:13] frustrate demons we're Frozen chosen to
[1:30:16] frustrate
[1:30:17] sickness and these things that he throws
[1:30:19] at us chosen just little old you and me
[1:30:23] are chosen to frust the kingdom of
[1:30:27] Satan he says and his brother said oh
[1:30:30] you naughty thing come out here to do
[1:30:31] such a thing as that get on back home
[1:30:33] that didn't bother him why he knew he
[1:30:36] was
[1:30:37] anointed you've got to know your
[1:30:39] anointing he says the god that delivered
[1:30:41] me from that lion the god that delivered
[1:30:43] me from the paws of that bear he'll more
[1:30:45] than that deliver me from that
[1:30:47] Philistine here I come I meet you in the
[1:30:50] name of the Lord God of Israel amen he
[1:30:52] says he didn't pray through
[1:30:55] he was already prayed
[1:30:58] through matters how you start your day
[1:31:00] Church matters how you spend your week
[1:31:02] church he was prayed through he says God
[1:31:05] prayed him through before the foundation
[1:31:07] of the world in other words God had made
[1:31:09] a way for
[1:31:12] David God had built David
[1:31:15] up God knew what David needed and God
[1:31:17] had prepare David for David's challenge
[1:31:20] David's prayed up he was anointed for
[1:31:22] the job now catch this he had to speak
[1:31:26] and go forward that's all there was to
[1:31:28] do about it just speak and go forward
[1:31:30] that's all there was to it he says about
[1:31:32] his denominational Brothers them
[1:31:34] scoffers standing there too you know oh
[1:31:36] yes they were standing there saying and
[1:31:37] scoffing and making fun saying his
[1:31:39] brothers you know and say ah you can't
[1:31:41] you're just naughty that didn't move him
[1:31:43] a bit you want to be different from
[1:31:46] somebody else you just want to show
[1:31:48] off if that had been showing off it had
[1:31:50] been so but they only looked at the
[1:31:52] intellectual
[1:31:54] side their problems were all in them not
[1:31:57] in David none of this had anything to do
[1:31:59] with David all this showed was what was
[1:32:02] inside
[1:32:02] elb all the show was what was inside
[1:32:05] Saul he says David knew the anointing
[1:32:08] oil was on him am man didn't make any
[1:32:10] difference to him he said that
[1:32:12] Philistine will be like the bear and the
[1:32:13] lion so here I come he predicted it
[1:32:16] before it happened what did he do he
[1:32:19] killed the bear he killed the lion he
[1:32:20] knocked the lion down what with with the
[1:32:22] slingshot and took a knife and then the
[1:32:24] bear he killed the lion with a knife
[1:32:26] that's the same thing he done Goliath he
[1:32:28] knocked him down with a rock pulled his
[1:32:30] sword cut his own head off right there
[1:32:33] before it what a lion is a bear as a
[1:32:36] Goliath doesn't matter to David it's all
[1:32:38] the same thing it's got to go
[1:32:41] down he says what did he predict before
[1:32:43] it
[1:32:44] happened and you will be as they are why
[1:32:49] it says he spoke the word that it would
[1:32:51] be and then went forward to make it be
[1:32:55] fulfilled David didn't say you're going
[1:32:57] to die Goliath Maybe not today but
[1:33:00] you're going to die no David says it's
[1:33:03] going to happen right
[1:33:04] now because you've challenged the Living
[1:33:07] God because you've cursed me I've got a
[1:33:09] word to stand on and you're going to
[1:33:10] have everything you said happen to you
[1:33:12] right here today and he went forward to
[1:33:14] make it be fulfilled he says amen oh
[1:33:16] brother he spake and took over the
[1:33:18] situation that day if there was ever a
[1:33:21] time that man should speak he says it's
[1:33:23] now
[1:33:25] you know what David
[1:33:26] did David called his
[1:33:29] shot now those that know Sports know
[1:33:32] what calling your shot is and the first
[1:33:33] one we know was probably Babe
[1:33:36] Ruth
[1:33:37] remember and he takes his Bat and they
[1:33:39] don't have a picture of it they've got
[1:33:41] video of it but what does he do he
[1:33:42] points at this center field
[1:33:44] wall and he says I'm going to hit a home
[1:33:46] run and on the next pitch what did he do
[1:33:48] he hit a home run then you see Owen
[1:33:50] Nolan the skater up there and he's
[1:33:52] playing the game he's got two goals and
[1:33:54] he says I'm going to score a hattick I'm
[1:33:55] going to get three goals and as he's
[1:33:56] going in on the goalie he points with
[1:33:59] his hand to where he's going to shoot
[1:34:01] and then he puts it right there and he
[1:34:02] scores the goal then you see Mark
[1:34:04] Messier 1994 game six Conference Finals
[1:34:09] he says we're going to win tonight
[1:34:10] they're down four games or three games
[1:34:12] to two he says we're going to win
[1:34:13] tonight and then we're going to win the
[1:34:15] next game and what does he do he goes in
[1:34:17] and they win the game and then they win
[1:34:20] the Stanley
[1:34:21] Cup that's not what we're talking
[1:34:23] talking about because they were doing it
[1:34:25] to build hype they were doing it to
[1:34:27] build morale they were doing it to get
[1:34:29] people going but they had no guarantee
[1:34:31] of winning Babe Ruth had no guarantee of
[1:34:33] hitting that pitch out of the park for
[1:34:36] all he knew it was going to go in the
[1:34:37] dirt and he would have even had a chance
[1:34:38] to hit
[1:34:39] it but David Knew by experience what was
[1:34:44] going to happen David had a word promise
[1:34:47] David wasn't being cocky David was
[1:34:49] standing on the promise of the word of
[1:34:51] God on the Covenant that God had given
[1:34:53] him that's why he said it that's why he
[1:34:56] could call his shot was because he was
[1:34:58] standing on the word
[1:35:01] amen our certainty isn't in ourselves
[1:35:04] Babe Ruth was certain of his power ow
[1:35:07] and Nolan just knew that he was going to
[1:35:08] be able to beat that goalie Mark mesier
[1:35:10] just knew that they could beat that team
[1:35:12] that's not what we're talking about
[1:35:14] David's certainty was that the god
[1:35:15] that's been with me is the god that's
[1:35:17] with me today and he'll be with me
[1:35:19] tomorrow and he's going to be with me
[1:35:20] all the way until he places me in the
[1:35:21] Throne of Israel that's his certainty
[1:35:24] amen what is it it's his word quickened
[1:35:26] by his Spirit by the anointing of God in
[1:35:28] our
[1:35:30] lives brother Braham says this he says
[1:35:32] the people that laid in his shadow never
[1:35:33] said Oh Come Apostle Peter and pray the
[1:35:36] prayer of faith for us to God no no they
[1:35:39] never said that they knew he was
[1:35:40] anointed and a Vindicated Apostle of God
[1:35:43] so they said just let us lay in his
[1:35:46] shadow you don't have to say a word we
[1:35:49] know it we believe it he says it's life
[1:35:52] within them
[1:35:54] the Apostle couldn't get to them all and
[1:35:57] they themselves catch this he says
[1:35:59] they're a part of it see we focus so
[1:36:02] much on the bigs the ministers the
[1:36:05] apostles the prophets brother brandham
[1:36:08] is trying to rip this Doctrine apart
[1:36:11] because why he's going to leave the
[1:36:12] scene and if it's all about the prophet
[1:36:15] then what are we going to do after the
[1:36:16] prophet's gone if it's all about Moses
[1:36:18] then what are we going to do after Moses
[1:36:19] is dead if it's all about Christ in his
[1:36:21] physical body then what are we going to
[1:36:23] do after he leaves the Earth he's trying
[1:36:25] to get us ready for what's about to
[1:36:27] happen he says the he couldn't get to
[1:36:30] them all and they themselves they're
[1:36:32] part of it Moses said it's not just me
[1:36:34] going we're all going he says we've all
[1:36:37] got something to do we've all got to be
[1:36:42] anointed amen it's not riding on the
[1:36:44] coattails or the shoulders of some man
[1:36:46] or some Ministry amen this makes me want
[1:36:49] to shout because he's saying we've all
[1:36:51] got an anointing that's with us now
[1:36:53] listen some of us are anointed to
[1:36:55] speak but somebody's got to be anointed
[1:36:58] to be on the receiving end to hear and
[1:37:00] to act on what they hear and it's the
[1:37:02] exact same anointing working from both
[1:37:04] sides to bring the word to pass that's
[1:37:07] what God's doing as he's working on both
[1:37:09] of us Moses can't be a deliverer unless
[1:37:11] there's someone to be delivered somebody
[1:37:13] to accept the message that he's bring
[1:37:15] bringing what's the point of being a
[1:37:17] pastor if there's no sheep but what's
[1:37:19] the point of being sheep if the P if the
[1:37:21] shepherd's not effective it takes the
[1:37:23] two group groups to come together
[1:37:24] brother Bram saying we're all going to
[1:37:26] be there we all are there we're all
[1:37:28] anointed we've all got a part to play in
[1:37:30] these things amen we're all headed to
[1:37:32] Eternity we're all on the Gospel Ship to
[1:37:34] Zion I'm not getting here there without
[1:37:36] you and you're not getting there without
[1:37:38] me it's all got to be there and
[1:37:40] sometimes it's power to give and
[1:37:42] sometimes it's power to take sometimes
[1:37:44] it's power to speak and sometimes it's
[1:37:45] power to receive but all of it is what
[1:37:48] the authority of the spirit of God
[1:37:50] inside of us that's saying the word is
[1:37:51] true and it'll happen happen if we'll
[1:37:53] just hold on to it
[1:37:56] amen you know I was talking to my wife
[1:37:59] about Wednesday night service and I said
[1:38:01] you know sometimes I feel like I'm I'm
[1:38:03] preaching too simple the the depth of
[1:38:06] the message is so it's so
[1:38:08] rich but the thing is God has to meet us
[1:38:11] where we are first and
[1:38:13] foremost amen we've got to learn how to
[1:38:16] do addition and subtraction before we
[1:38:18] can go to multiplication and division
[1:38:20] before we can do algebra and
[1:38:22] calculus we're not going to kill Goliath
[1:38:24] the first day as a Christian in all
[1:38:26] probability man we've got to grow and
[1:38:28] we've got to mature and I'm not saying
[1:38:30] the church is immature but I'm saying
[1:38:32] that we've got to be able to take the
[1:38:33] Simplicity all the way up to the great
[1:38:35] mystery and everything in between it's
[1:38:37] all got a purpose to develop Us in these
[1:38:39] things amen and God will meet us where
[1:38:41] we are and he'll feed us something
[1:38:43] that'll take us right to where we need
[1:38:45] to be God knows how to do
[1:38:47] it but he says here we've all got to be
[1:38:50] anointed brother BR puts it this way God
[1:38:52] rich and mercy says this is not a
[1:38:54] Superstition it is the
[1:38:57] manifestation of a promise of God that's
[1:39:00] what David was standing on David was
[1:39:02] saying Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:39:05] now here's the
[1:39:06] situation let the word come forth that's
[1:39:09] all he's saying let the word have its
[1:39:12] promised
[1:39:14] effect so
[1:39:16] simple but what courage did it take for
[1:39:18] David to stand there David was the only
[1:39:20] True Believer standing there that would
[1:39:23] take God at his
[1:39:24] word he says it depends on what you're
[1:39:27] looking at there's no virtue in any man
[1:39:30] there's no power in any man but we as
[1:39:33] Believers have authority not power but
[1:39:35] Authority somebody asked me long not
[1:39:38] long ago said brother brandham you
[1:39:39] believe you got power to do this I said
[1:39:41] I ain't got no power at all but I've got
[1:39:45] Authority and we all say Amen the
[1:39:47] prophet had Authority and then he says
[1:39:49] every believer has it every believer has
[1:39:53] it not just the
[1:39:55] prophet he says if you refuse it you'll
[1:39:59] stay where you're at but if you'll
[1:40:01] accept it Hallelujah it'll do the
[1:40:04] exceeding abundance because God is rich
[1:40:07] in his Mercy if you'll accept it if
[1:40:10] you'll believe it if you'll act on it if
[1:40:12] you'll hear it if you'll dwell on it if
[1:40:15] you'll feed on it if you'll saturate
[1:40:17] yourself in it it'll do the exceeding
[1:40:20] abundance you know there's nothing in
[1:40:22] the scripture that says that when David
[1:40:25] was going towards
[1:40:27] Goliath that he had this great anointing
[1:40:30] sweep over
[1:40:32] him doesn't say that David had
[1:40:34] goosebumps running up and down his
[1:40:36] arms it doesn't say that David started
[1:40:39] sweating
[1:40:40] profusely it doesn't say David had a
[1:40:42] Hallelujah
[1:40:44] moment all it says is David ran toward
[1:40:50] Goliath sometimes we're waiting for the
[1:40:52] emotion
[1:40:54] of the
[1:40:57] anointing we want to feel
[1:40:59] anointed brother Braham didn't say that
[1:41:03] the scripture didn't say that you have
[1:41:04] to know you're
[1:41:06] anointed the emotion may come it may not
[1:41:09] come sometimes by the time the emotion
[1:41:11] comes you've moveed past the point you
[1:41:13] missed the
[1:41:14] moment you've got to know your anointing
[1:41:17] when we read those quotes how many times
[1:41:19] did Brother Bram say David knew he was
[1:41:22] anointed
[1:41:24] That's What mattered it didn't say David
[1:41:26] felt
[1:41:27] anointed it said David knew he was
[1:41:30] anointed that's the Difference Maker
[1:41:34] amen we've got to know we're
[1:41:37] called and in that calling God backs us
[1:41:42] up because it's the anointing that's
[1:41:44] doing it it's the anointing that's
[1:41:45] pushing it's the anointing that's
[1:41:46] pulling it's the anointing that's
[1:41:48] pressing us forward in these things
[1:41:50] brother Joe I hope you don't mind me
[1:41:51] sharing this part of a conversation we
[1:41:53] had had he he was in a meeting and and a
[1:41:55] client brought up something that you
[1:41:56] know about these alternative Lifestyles
[1:41:58] and what they want to do a project and
[1:42:00] brother Joe was saying you know I H I
[1:42:02] forced myself to get those words out to
[1:42:05] say no we don't do
[1:42:06] that why because if we sit there and
[1:42:10] wait for courage the moment goes and we
[1:42:14] fail but we have to speak
[1:42:17] regardless and stay with the word that's
[1:42:20] why Joshua had to be courageous stay
[1:42:21] with it whether you feel it or don't
[1:42:23] feel it
[1:42:25] amen I don't always stand up here and I
[1:42:27] feel like the the anointing of God is
[1:42:29] just flowing through
[1:42:31] me he never promised that but he
[1:42:34] promised he'd be with us and he'd never
[1:42:36] forsake us and if we'd stay in the line
[1:42:38] of duty he'd back his word up every
[1:42:40] single time that's what my rest is in is
[1:42:43] that he said not that I feel not that I
[1:42:47] feel we can't wait on the emotion of the
[1:42:49] anointing or the feeling of the
[1:42:50] anointing we have to know we're anointed
[1:42:53] otherwise we'll miss the opportunity
[1:42:55] every
[1:42:57] time he says you
[1:42:59] know after we've confessed our sins and
[1:43:02] met every requirement that God requires
[1:43:04] we've believed on God there's a
[1:43:06] circumstance has to be met and it's
[1:43:08] according to his will and we've
[1:43:10] confessed our sins made all the wrongs
[1:43:12] that we've done right done everything we
[1:43:14] know how to do every requirement that
[1:43:17] God has made or asked we've met that
[1:43:19] requirement and yet he lays silent he
[1:43:22] just won't won't answer us we're talking
[1:43:24] about Authority by position he says I'm
[1:43:27] sure that I'm speaking to people who've
[1:43:29] come to that place I've been there many
[1:43:31] many times myself and when I've went
[1:43:34] back and traced my life and turned over
[1:43:35] every stone and I find that I've did
[1:43:37] something wrong I go confess it and say
[1:43:39] Lord God I'll make it right and go do so
[1:43:42] then come back again and say now Lord
[1:43:44] Thou Art God you'll answer me surely I
[1:43:46] met every request that you required me
[1:43:48] to do and every requirement I've met it
[1:43:51] and still he won't move
[1:43:54] seems to set silent he says that's when
[1:43:57] you've got to be sure that he is God
[1:44:00] don't be
[1:44:01] discouraged the only thing is in your
[1:44:04] heart to be certain of God you've got to
[1:44:08] know that you know that you
[1:44:11] know I was listening to brother Jerry
[1:44:13] Fury the other day he was talking about
[1:44:15] faith and he says you've got to have
[1:44:17] faith from the inside to the
[1:44:19] outside because you can have it in here
[1:44:21] but it's got to work its way out
[1:44:23] amen it's got to work its way from the
[1:44:25] heart through the Mind into the spirit
[1:44:27] and then it takes into the Flesh and
[1:44:29] then the whole being is subject to Faith
[1:44:31] but if you've just got it in here but it
[1:44:33] can't get past the mind it won't do you
[1:44:34] any good amen it won't have the effect
[1:44:37] because you start to doubt your own self
[1:44:40] there's got to be a way for it to come
[1:44:42] out he says but be certain first before
[1:44:47] you do
[1:44:48] anything if you want to have authority
[1:44:50] you want to know that you're where he
[1:44:51] wants you to be doing what he told you
[1:44:53] you to
[1:44:54] do that's the hardest work as a Believer
[1:44:56] find the will of God and when you have
[1:44:59] found the will of God stay stay there
[1:45:02] and don't worry he says be certain in
[1:45:04] your heart that it's God and when you've
[1:45:06] met everything he said then make sure he
[1:45:09] says then you're sure that he's God
[1:45:11] that's when Faith goes to work right
[1:45:12] there Faith stands steady for it knows
[1:45:15] that what he is your trust is in him not
[1:45:19] in yourself and you met every
[1:45:21] requirement you believe that he is and
[1:45:23] Faith holds steady Faith won't move for
[1:45:26] it's sure that God is and a rewarder of
[1:45:29] those that diligently seek him that's
[1:45:31] when real faith can kick in you're
[1:45:33] certain you know you're where you need
[1:45:35] to be he says now Satan likes to throw
[1:45:37] that at you why you're no better than
[1:45:39] you were when you were anointed you're
[1:45:41] no better than you were when those
[1:45:42] preachers prayed for you those preachers
[1:45:44] aren't right in the first place he says
[1:45:46] it doesn't matter about your that
[1:45:48] preacher it's your faith in the Living
[1:45:50] God what counts it's not what the
[1:45:53] preacher is it's what God is the
[1:45:55] preacher never made the promise God made
[1:45:57] the promise I remember brother darl Ward
[1:45:59] saying it's not my job to heal them it's
[1:46:01] my job to pray for them in
[1:46:03] faith because it ain't my promise but
[1:46:06] it's my
[1:46:08] commission the prayer of faith shall
[1:46:10] save the sick amen it's my job to have
[1:46:13] the faith to pray it it's God's job to
[1:46:16] do the healing and that's in his time
[1:46:17] and in his season he says it's not what
[1:46:20] the preacher is it's what God is the
[1:46:21] preacher never made the promise God made
[1:46:23] the promise it's not up to the preacher
[1:46:26] it's up to God and your faith to believe
[1:46:28] that that is God so be certain of God be
[1:46:32] certain that it's God and that's God's
[1:46:34] word he says and God is in his word amen
[1:46:39] let's stand together if we would David
[1:46:42] was standing on the promise of God
[1:46:45] nothing shall stand before you David saw
[1:46:48] no difference between him and Joshua why
[1:46:51] he was the son of Abraham he was in the
[1:46:53] lineage of Abraham he was under the same
[1:46:55] covenant made the same sacrifices
[1:46:57] worshiped the same God and was in the
[1:46:59] same line of duty David was standing on
[1:47:02] his word he didn't consider what other
[1:47:03] people thought nobody thought he could
[1:47:06] do it and it didn't even enter David's
[1:47:08] mind CU he had an experience that said
[1:47:10] otherwise that God was with him amen God
[1:47:13] had anointed him God had called him God
[1:47:15] had placed him in the situation and so
[1:47:17] he knew he had to be able to walk right
[1:47:19] through it David walked out with only
[1:47:21] one thing his
[1:47:23] anointing everything else was stuff that
[1:47:25] he had with him all the time he didn't
[1:47:27] do some sort of special preparation to
[1:47:29] face the battle he walked out the way he
[1:47:31] walked in God had brought to him
[1:47:34] everything that he needed to face
[1:47:35] Goliath amen he knew he had a word
[1:47:38] promise like that little children's song
[1:47:40] remember that old song He flung The Rock
[1:47:42] and God did the
[1:47:44] rest God needed somebody to stand and
[1:47:47] throw a rock that's all he needed David
[1:47:50] said I can do that and God took down a
[1:47:52] giant
[1:47:54] took Israel out of slavery why he knew
[1:47:57] he was anointed church are you filled
[1:47:59] with the Holy Ghost this
[1:48:01] evening ask yourself do I have the Holy
[1:48:05] Ghost because if you do you've got the
[1:48:08] exact same anointing that put a Goliath
[1:48:11] on his
[1:48:12] back you got the exact same anointing
[1:48:15] that took down Jericho's walls you got
[1:48:18] the same anointing that raised Christ
[1:48:20] from the
[1:48:21] dead there is no
[1:48:23] difference maybe in portion but there's
[1:48:26] no difference in that
[1:48:27] anointing that means that when the
[1:48:30] situation arises you've got an anointing
[1:48:32] to take you through
[1:48:34] it however it
[1:48:37] is over under
[1:48:42] through God's got it all and he's
[1:48:45] equipped you with an anointing to have
[1:48:48] authority to say this has to change
[1:48:53] he'll be he'll be the one that decides
[1:48:55] how it does it it's not up to us to tell
[1:48:57] God how to do it but it's up to us to
[1:48:59] stand out and say God I believe you and
[1:49:02] I'm going forward and I'm going to keep
[1:49:04] pressing forward until this thing
[1:49:05] changes
[1:49:08] amen all he's asking us to do yield to
[1:49:12] the anointing and stand on his word
[1:49:15] that's what a child of God does sons of
[1:49:17] God are led by the spirit of God and the
[1:49:19] spirit of God always leads us to stand
[1:49:21] on his word amen
[1:49:24] it's simple when we talk about
[1:49:26] it it's easy to preach it now we got to
[1:49:30] live it we got to seek after him say God
[1:49:34] what am I anointed to do what have you
[1:49:37] placed me here to do look around we
[1:49:40] shouldn't have to look very far
[1:49:42] Church certainly not for our first line
[1:49:44] of duty as husbands as wives as Fathers
[1:49:46] as mothers as as Sunday school teachers
[1:49:48] as song leaders as musicians as
[1:49:50] preachers whatever it might be
[1:49:53] but maybe there's
[1:49:54] more you young people you're called if
[1:49:57] David could be anointed at 12 what can
[1:49:59] you be anointed
[1:50:01] for if he could be a king what can you
[1:50:04] be if nothing else you can be an example
[1:50:06] of a living God amen amen let's just bow
[1:50:10] our heads Heavenly
[1:50:13] Father Lord one thing we know is your
[1:50:15] anointing will always bring Glory To You
