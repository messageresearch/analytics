[1:21:39] just put the name of your church there
[1:21:41] so I could make it a little personal
[1:21:44] Amen in Jeffersonville
[1:21:47] brother Branham
[1:21:49] had this uh something that he shared he
[1:21:53] said somehow another I feel I just feel
[1:21:56] we're going there's something laying
[1:21:58] right ahead for us
[1:22:00] now just remember he said I believe I'm
[1:22:03] prophesying
[1:22:05] great joy lays ahead believe it
[1:22:09] that's right many saddened hearts
[1:22:12] will be made great Mysteries will be
[1:22:16] made clear and people who are sad will
[1:22:19] be turned into Joy
[1:22:22] Hallelujah wouldn't that be wonderful if
[1:22:24] the Lord fulfilled that
[1:22:26] tonight and this weekend for us
[1:22:29] in in Tifton Georgia this is a a quote I
[1:22:33] wanted to share before we go to the word
[1:22:35] brother Branham said when we see God
[1:22:37] heal a man
[1:22:39] here a few days ago in our church they
[1:22:42] brought a little girl up there on a
[1:22:44] stretcher
[1:22:45] and they'd called me in the night time
[1:22:47] on the road and said the girl cannot
[1:22:49] live the cancer was so bad
[1:22:52] about 17 years old and she can't even
[1:22:55] get there she's going to die before she
[1:22:58] gets there it was a pitiful case a
[1:23:01] lovely little child of 17 years old
[1:23:05] to prove something to my church I never
[1:23:08] touched the child at all I never as much
[1:23:11] just touched her I walked in laying on a
[1:23:15] stretcher of course there were other
[1:23:17] sick people but I was concerned about
[1:23:19] the child to catch her spirit
[1:23:23] when I spoke to her and she seemed like
[1:23:25] a very fine little girl I see no reason
[1:23:28] why that child should fill a premature
[1:23:32] grave and that has to be the devil
[1:23:34] trying to take her life
[1:23:36] so I never touched the child at all
[1:23:39] remember he was trying to teach his
[1:23:42] church the Tabernacle a lesson he was
[1:23:45] trying to bring them up into further
[1:23:47] things
[1:23:49] I never touched a child at all and went
[1:23:51] right to the pulpit with the word and
[1:23:54] stayed right with the word
[1:23:55] and then and the word healed her so
[1:23:59] instantly until she got up and walked
[1:24:03] away is all right now living like
[1:24:06] anybody else can't find the trace of it
[1:24:09] anymore I never even touched her
[1:24:14] how many believe that's possible
[1:24:18] he said so the word went forth let's all
[1:24:21] say the word the word went forth and she
[1:24:25] believed the word and the word is God's
[1:24:29] life and God's power
[1:24:31] and the word is what does it the word
[1:24:35] heals the sick
[1:24:37] then you say well Jesus healed the sick
[1:24:39] he is the word
[1:24:42] he is the word when you receive the word
[1:24:44] you receive Jesus for he is the word the
[1:24:47] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:24:49] we believe that don't we every bit we
[1:24:52] believe that Christ is God's word may
[1:24:55] manifest and we believe that his bride
[1:24:58] must be the same thing
[1:25:00] and we believe that she must believe
[1:25:03] every bit of the word
[1:25:05] and have that word in her because she is
[1:25:08] part of the body she is the body where
[1:25:12] he is the head
[1:25:14] so now life flows through the body
[1:25:17] healing flows through the body
[1:25:20] there's power in the word
[1:25:23] amen and you know sometimes we have
[1:25:24] needs as individuals and we have a MD a
[1:25:29] medical doctor we have a general
[1:25:31] practitioner
[1:25:33] and then there's sometimes we need a
[1:25:35] specialist
[1:25:37] we get sent to a specialist
[1:25:39] tonight you're in the hands of a
[1:25:41] specialist
[1:25:42] it's the Lord Jesus
[1:25:45] now brother John's Ministry is is unique
[1:25:48] and different but I just have to be what
[1:25:49] God has called us to be and I'm going to
[1:25:52] speak from my heart today and I know
[1:25:53] that this service is going to be for
[1:25:55] someone it's it's very uh specific and
[1:25:58] very personal and I want I just want
[1:26:01] each one of you to be receiving
[1:26:03] be open and let's let the Lord Jesus do
[1:26:07] what he wants to do tonight
[1:26:09] I want to speak tonight on I will
[1:26:12] restore
[1:26:14] I will restore
[1:26:17] so let's turn together as we stand
[1:26:23] how many would just want the Lord to
[1:26:25] have his way and
[1:26:27] we're already in the second service of
[1:26:29] this weekend I don't want you to be
[1:26:31] distracted by anything and you're we're
[1:26:33] all together we're all here
[1:26:36] and Jesus is in control
[1:26:39] there's no demon or devil that can
[1:26:43] conquer
[1:26:45] the Lord Jesus
[1:26:47] let's just take him at his word
[1:26:50] and let's believe him tonight I believe
[1:26:52] from the service tonight there's going
[1:26:54] to be testimonies I believe he's a God
[1:26:57] that does miracles
[1:26:59] and he's also a Divine healer and and
[1:27:02] healing takes time
[1:27:05] do you all know the difference there's
[1:27:07] healing and that can be immediate and
[1:27:09] then there's healing
[1:27:11] did I say that wrong a miracle a
[1:27:14] Miracle's instant but a healing takes
[1:27:16] time and God's A Healer
[1:27:18] so just reach out I don't know you I
[1:27:21] don't know your private lives I don't
[1:27:23] know your situation
[1:27:25] so you just have to take it from the
[1:27:27] Lord that he's talking to you personal
[1:27:29] amen can we do that
[1:27:32] Joel chapter 2
[1:27:35] verse 23
[1:27:40] as you know the scripture isn't just
[1:27:42] speaking the present Joel wasn't just
[1:27:44] speaking for the the now but it was
[1:27:47] actually prophecy for future
[1:27:50] be glad then you children of Zion
[1:27:53] and rejoice
[1:27:55] Joel 2 23 rejoice in the Lord your God
[1:28:00] for he hath given you the former Reign
[1:28:03] moderately
[1:28:06] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:28:10] the rain
[1:28:12] the former reign
[1:28:14] and the latter rain
[1:28:16] in the first month
[1:28:19] so this is where we have the planting
[1:28:21] rain and the Harvest rain coming in the
[1:28:24] same season
[1:28:26] in the same time
[1:28:28] could be the same service you could have
[1:28:30] teaching you could have a planting you
[1:28:33] could have a harvest right in the same
[1:28:36] month in the same season this isn't just
[1:28:39] a foundational message that we've
[1:28:42] received we're in a Rapture message and
[1:28:44] so that means God could be dealing with
[1:28:47] uh someone in kindergarten a new
[1:28:49] Christian or he could be dealing with an
[1:28:51] elder person someone that's very mature
[1:28:54] in the same season do we believe that
[1:28:57] it's this rain this word
[1:29:00] this uh that you're going to receive is
[1:29:02] gonna just be coming and flowing and the
[1:29:05] floors
[1:29:06] shall be full of wheat
[1:29:09] that's the word
[1:29:11] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[1:29:15] and oil
[1:29:17] wine and oil is always to do with
[1:29:20] healing
[1:29:22] and you know that wine is stimulation
[1:29:24] that comes from Revelation oil is the
[1:29:27] holy spirit so remember the the the man
[1:29:30] that was uh beaten by the robbers and
[1:29:34] the priest walked by and the levite
[1:29:36] walked by but there was a man that had
[1:29:38] wine and oil
[1:29:40] and he helped bring a healing
[1:29:43] then he brought him to the church he
[1:29:45] brought him to the Inn
[1:29:46] and he said take care of this person and
[1:29:49] whatever's lacking when I return I'll
[1:29:53] make up the difference that was a
[1:29:55] promise to us as Believers that the
[1:29:58] church is a place of healing our church
[1:30:00] services should be a time of healing
[1:30:03] it should be like a hospital
[1:30:06] okay it's like a hospital
[1:30:09] verse 5 25 is our verse tonight
[1:30:13] and I will restore to you the years
[1:30:18] that the locusts hath eaten the the
[1:30:21] canker worm and the caterpillar and the
[1:30:24] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[1:30:27] among you and ye shall eat in plenty and
[1:30:31] be satisfied
[1:30:33] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:30:36] that hath dwelt wondrously with you and
[1:30:39] my people shall never be ashamed
[1:30:44] and ye shall know that I am in the midst
[1:30:47] of Israel and that I am the Lord your
[1:30:50] God and none else and my people shall
[1:30:54] never be ashamed
[1:30:58] you know we're humans so he said it
[1:31:01] twice
[1:31:03] you don't have to be ashamed you don't
[1:31:04] have to be embarrassed who's ever been
[1:31:07] in a hospital or wore one of those gowns
[1:31:11] it's embarrassing I mean
[1:31:13] you put it on and the hinder parts
[1:31:19] you don't want nobody to see your hinder
[1:31:21] Parts it's so embarrassing it's like
[1:31:24] please exit out of the room I need to
[1:31:26] stand up and go to the washroom and it's
[1:31:28] not a glorious place to be when you're
[1:31:30] in need
[1:31:33] now I'm I'm approaching the service
[1:31:35] tonight like a specialist
[1:31:38] and we've all we've been there we've all
[1:31:40] been there it's embarrassing to say I
[1:31:43] have a need or that I I'm in trouble
[1:31:46] or that I need help
[1:31:51] verse 28 and it shall come to pass
[1:31:54] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:31:56] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:32:00] daughters shall prophesy and your old
[1:32:02] men shall dream dreams and your young
[1:32:05] men shall see visions
[1:32:07] and also upon the Servants of it upon
[1:32:09] the handmaids in those days will I pour
[1:32:12] out my spirit
[1:32:13] and I will show wonders in the heavens
[1:32:16] and the and in the earth blood and fire
[1:32:19] and pillars of smoke the Earth the Sun
[1:32:22] shall be turned into darkness and the
[1:32:25] moon into blood before
[1:32:28] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[1:32:31] come
[1:32:33] verse 32 is our last verse and it shall
[1:32:36] come to pass
[1:32:38] that whosoever
[1:32:40] and brother Branham
[1:32:42] paused at this verse and he talked about
[1:32:44] this verse because it's also in the Acts
[1:32:47] chapter 2 in Romans Chapter 2 whosoever
[1:32:50] means you need to put your name there
[1:32:54] because if the Bible would have put your
[1:32:56] name there then you could have had a
[1:32:59] reason to say well someone else's name
[1:33:01] is
[1:33:02] come on Mark Coffey or Jonathan curlette
[1:33:06] or sister Amber you would if somebody's
[1:33:09] name was sister Faith or Selena you
[1:33:11] would be able to say well oh there's a
[1:33:13] lot of Selena so it's not for me but he
[1:33:15] said the Bible says whosoever that means
[1:33:18] you can put your name there
[1:33:20] are we believing together whosoever
[1:33:22] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[1:33:25] be delivered
[1:33:27] for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall
[1:33:29] be Deliverance how many know that the
[1:33:32] bride is called New Jerusalem so there
[1:33:34] ought to be deliverance and there ought
[1:33:36] to be something about our Gatherings and
[1:33:39] as the Lord has said and in the remnant
[1:33:41] whom the Lord
[1:33:43] shall call
[1:33:45] God bless you you can have your seats
[1:33:47] tonight
[1:33:57] I
[1:34:00] will restore
[1:34:04] who is saying this
[1:34:07] who made this promise
[1:34:10] God God did
[1:34:12] God will restore
[1:34:15] when we say I will restore will means
[1:34:20] not maybe
[1:34:21] I will I'm on your case I'm working on
[1:34:25] it I've got this
[1:34:27] I've got this it's God saying this to
[1:34:30] you tonight I want you to take this
[1:34:32] personal like brother John was with you
[1:34:34] in a room all alone
[1:34:36] and when the Bible says I will restore I
[1:34:39] God said I will restore you I'm going to
[1:34:43] bring you back to the original he's
[1:34:45] never lied
[1:34:46] to no person whether you're young
[1:34:49] middle-aged or older I will restore
[1:34:52] saith the Lord
[1:34:54] I woke up early this morning a very
[1:34:57] burdened and and with these things upon
[1:34:59] my heart the Lord laid this on our heart
[1:35:02] to say and tonight I want us to go
[1:35:04] together on a little journey as we look
[1:35:06] now at many current situations
[1:35:10] that would be among us or certain needs
[1:35:13] things that have happened amongst the
[1:35:16] the bride of Christ and what is
[1:35:18] happening
[1:35:19] there's been many hurts
[1:35:21] there's been many things that have
[1:35:23] happened that are irreparable
[1:35:26] there's been great damage in individuals
[1:35:29] lives there are believers that are in a
[1:35:32] lot of pain
[1:35:35] Satan is the one that inflicts suffering
[1:35:39] Satan is the one that brings turmoil
[1:35:43] Satan is the one that brings confusion
[1:35:46] Satan is the one that brings Mix-Ups
[1:35:50] how many has ever heard that little
[1:35:52] phrase about Humpty Dumpty that he had a
[1:35:54] great fall Humpty Dumpty fell off the
[1:35:57] wall
[1:35:58] and all the king's horses and all the
[1:36:01] king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty
[1:36:04] back together again say brother John why
[1:36:07] are you talking with a childhood it's a
[1:36:10] little story that's so that we all get
[1:36:11] it you know if you talk simple then
[1:36:14] everybody gets it the point about this
[1:36:17] is all the kings horses and all the
[1:36:20] king's men couldn't put back all these
[1:36:23] pieces they couldn't bring it back again
[1:36:25] and sometimes we get into situations
[1:36:28] where we get into things as Believers
[1:36:31] that we just look at it and say however
[1:36:35] would there ever be a restoration
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:39] never in the message I want you to think
[1:36:42] and just meditate upon this tonight
[1:36:44] brother John is 50 years old and born
[1:36:46] and raised in the message so I'm just
[1:36:48] really speaking uh locally and globally
[1:36:51] never in the message did we realize or
[1:36:54] did we know or would we ever accept that
[1:36:58] so much could happen so much would
[1:37:01] happen
[1:37:02] so much is happening or that is possible
[1:37:05] in the message
[1:37:07] for many years and uh in conventions or
[1:37:10] local churches we talked about the
[1:37:12] Catholic church or we talked about the
[1:37:14] Pentecostals or we talked about
[1:37:15] denominations and and for many people it
[1:37:18] was out there
[1:37:20] it was out there
[1:37:22] but now as the message has gone on and
[1:37:25] years have gone on and now it's really
[1:37:28] come down home
[1:37:30] for a lot of years we talked about being
[1:37:32] in the token and being in message
[1:37:34] churches and you know we kind of put
[1:37:36] divorce as something out there
[1:37:39] great but now as we've gone on in the
[1:37:41] message we see that it's come in right
[1:37:43] among us even in the message
[1:37:45] we talk about breakups or we talk about
[1:37:48] premarital sex
[1:37:50] that would go on amongst young people
[1:37:53] even amongst children or even amongst
[1:37:55] middle-aged or even single adults and
[1:37:58] and never did we think that we'd even be
[1:38:00] talking about that especially from
[1:38:02] behind a message Pulpit not even saying
[1:38:05] the word
[1:38:07] never would we think that there would be
[1:38:09] babies born out of wedlock within the
[1:38:12] message ranks it was always something
[1:38:15] out there somewhere it was always the
[1:38:17] other Church in town it was always
[1:38:19] something we read in the newspaper
[1:38:21] something that would happen in the
[1:38:23] Catholic church or something down the
[1:38:25] road and some denomination somewhere and
[1:38:27] we frowned upon it and we kind of shook
[1:38:29] our head like oh that'll never come in
[1:38:31] our church that'll never come in the
[1:38:33] message but I just want to wake you up
[1:38:35] tonight we need to get our heads out of
[1:38:38] the sand and realize the waters have
[1:38:40] come to your Shores also
[1:38:43] never would we thought that prescription
[1:38:46] drug use
[1:38:47] would become so even common and
[1:38:50] prevalent amongst message people we talk
[1:38:52] about drugs and alcohol and I don't know
[1:38:55] what it's like here in Newfoundland but
[1:38:57] they've they have uh accepted marijuana
[1:39:00] and and approved all kinds of
[1:39:02] illegalized drugs in certain states in
[1:39:05] the United States and in America I don't
[1:39:07] know what it is in Newfoundland I really
[1:39:09] don't know but they've allowed alcohol
[1:39:11] they've allowed certain drugs marijuana
[1:39:14] and certain gateway drugs not knowing
[1:39:17] that that you know many of them the
[1:39:19] lawmakers were from the 60s where they
[1:39:21] took drugs themselves
[1:39:23] so it's no wonder they make it legal
[1:39:25] because they think they didn't turn out
[1:39:27] too bad themselves they think but it
[1:39:29] really fried their brain
[1:39:31] brother Bynum said you're insane if you
[1:39:33] don't have the Holy Ghost so stay with
[1:39:36] me a little bit whether you have a
[1:39:37] message name on it or someone out in the
[1:39:39] world you're insane without the Holy
[1:39:41] Ghost
[1:39:43] never would we think that the media
[1:39:45] overuse would become not just a problem
[1:39:49] amongst the young people many people say
[1:39:51] it's a young people's problem you know
[1:39:53] things they're looking at on their
[1:39:55] computers or on their cell phones or on
[1:39:57] their tablets and things but it's not
[1:39:59] just a young people's problems it's
[1:40:02] become a middle-aged problem and
[1:40:04] actually seniors in the message I've
[1:40:06] been in Rome with full of ministers and
[1:40:08] even prominent ministers in the message
[1:40:10] and almost all of them have their cell
[1:40:12] phones out and they're looking at their
[1:40:14] cell phones can't hardly have a meal
[1:40:16] can't hardly have a conversation today
[1:40:18] without someone looking at their watch
[1:40:20] or looking at their phone or looking at
[1:40:21] this it's become a global pandemic
[1:40:25] and you can all be quiet tonight that's
[1:40:27] just fine you know I'm a specialist I'm
[1:40:29] not a medical doctor and I'm not just
[1:40:31] someone General I'm being very focused
[1:40:33] and you can be embarrassed or you can be
[1:40:35] quiet but it's nothing but the truth
[1:40:37] anyway
[1:40:39] it's become a cell phone usage has
[1:40:42] become a global epidemic in homes
[1:40:45] social media Expressions what you say
[1:40:48] well find me a quote on that brother
[1:40:50] John well you know what you might not be
[1:40:52] able to say brother Branham said but the
[1:40:54] Holy Ghost says social media has become
[1:40:57] in a global epidemic amongst message
[1:40:59] believers
[1:41:01] in fact it's out of control in many
[1:41:03] areas
[1:41:04] a lack of personal attention a lack of
[1:41:08] focusing on things that are the most
[1:41:10] important and it leads to marriage
[1:41:13] breakups
[1:41:14] it leads to children that are out of
[1:41:17] order and disorder it leads to things
[1:41:20] that happen I remember some years ago
[1:41:21] getting called from uh getting a call
[1:41:25] late at night by a head Deacon of a
[1:41:27] church in the message
[1:41:28] and he was just speaking to me I knew
[1:41:31] the church very well and the family very
[1:41:33] well and and it and you know the the
[1:41:36] conversation came around he was very
[1:41:38] serious and urgent that you know his
[1:41:41] young daughter that was a teenager had
[1:41:43] been in a relationship with someone and
[1:41:45] she had become pregnant
[1:41:47] and this is in the message
[1:41:50] and now his daughter has become pregnant
[1:41:53] and you know the conversation becomes
[1:41:55] well is abortion and then it goes on to
[1:41:58] this and goes on to that you know these
[1:42:01] kind of questions you say well that's
[1:42:02] just shocking that's just something that
[1:42:04] is just unheard of well you know friends
[1:42:07] when it becomes down the road when the
[1:42:08] rubber meets the road that's where we
[1:42:11] find out what's really in the heart of
[1:42:12] people today
[1:42:14] abortion is not God's perfect will but
[1:42:17] neither is sex outside of marriage God's
[1:42:19] will it's it's fornication it's it's a
[1:42:22] it's adultery if you're married it's
[1:42:24] something that even fornication and and
[1:42:26] you know the word behind it is porno
[1:42:28] pornography and we find that all of
[1:42:31] these things is becoming rampant even
[1:42:33] amongst message believers
[1:42:38] should they keep the baby should it go
[1:42:40] to full term you know should the couple
[1:42:42] get married you know it's just a young
[1:42:44] teenager just someone that's in the
[1:42:46] message and all finally later they get
[1:42:48] married then there's a breakup that it
[1:42:50] just becomes a mess and you become to
[1:42:53] realize that people don't want to really
[1:42:55] admit that they've got a problem
[1:42:58] they don't want to admit that they're in
[1:43:00] an issue
[1:43:02] it's they become too proud to become
[1:43:05] honest I'm speaking on I will restore
[1:43:08] tonight I mean there's got to be a way
[1:43:10] back you can't just always talk about
[1:43:12] the issue or talk about the problem
[1:43:14] there's got to be an answer to all of
[1:43:16] this
[1:43:16] we got to open up our hearts
[1:43:19] to the solution
[1:43:22] the message was is that God would send a
[1:43:25] messenger that would turn the heart
[1:43:28] not turn the head but turn the heart and
[1:43:31] not give statistics but actually give a
[1:43:34] word that would be able to uncover the
[1:43:36] devil and deliver God's people out of
[1:43:39] their dilemmas
[1:43:40] so friends we can't keep our heads
[1:43:43] buried in the sand
[1:43:44] people don't want to hear about these
[1:43:46] things that I just talked about in the
[1:43:48] last five minutes they don't even want
[1:43:50] to hear about it
[1:43:52] they just want to think God's truth is
[1:43:54] marching on and we're in the glory bound
[1:43:55] way and people don't want to talk about
[1:43:57] their afflictions and their troubles
[1:43:59] they don't want to talk about even the
[1:44:01] mental troubles that's amongst message
[1:44:03] uh People sisters struggling with a
[1:44:07] mental oppression Brothers struggling
[1:44:10] with that they get so nervous how many
[1:44:12] has heard the messages of brother
[1:44:14] Branham and he'll go one right after the
[1:44:16] other and say you've got a nervous
[1:44:18] trouble and you've got nervous trouble
[1:44:20] how many's ever heard him say that did
[1:44:22] you notice what I said nervous trouble
[1:44:24] and it's all the trouble and you've got
[1:44:26] a kidney trouble and you've got a heart
[1:44:28] trouble and you got a certain trouble
[1:44:30] well nervousness is a trouble
[1:44:33] and and it causes people to get nervous
[1:44:36] and upset it can almost be like a duck
[1:44:39] though or a Canada Goose sitting on the
[1:44:41] water on on the top of the water it
[1:44:44] looks like everything's good
[1:44:46] everything's good but underneath
[1:44:50] but underneath
[1:44:52] their feet are going like this their
[1:44:54] feet are just how many knows what I'm
[1:44:56] talking about you underwater things are
[1:44:58] going like this so on the surface it
[1:45:00] looks like I'm good and how you doing
[1:45:02] tonight well I'm good all's good
[1:45:05] when really it might not be all as good
[1:45:09] I want to say tonight before we get into
[1:45:12] further of our message Jesus Christ is
[1:45:15] the answer to all of our needs
[1:45:20] Hallelujah
[1:45:22] Jesus Christ is the solution to all the
[1:45:25] situations
[1:45:27] I'm not here to give you psychology or
[1:45:29] to just talk about some issue I'm here
[1:45:32] to say Jesus Christ is the only one that
[1:45:35] you or I need to be holding on to
[1:45:39] me and we need to make sure that Jesus
[1:45:41] Christ is the one that's holding on to
[1:45:44] us so it does go both ways friends he's
[1:45:48] holding on to us but we've got to be
[1:45:50] holding on to him and and if you're not
[1:45:52] tonight you need to at least make a
[1:45:54] motion toward the lord
[1:45:56] just take a step just take a step toward
[1:45:59] the lord
[1:46:00] I encourage you he is the answer
[1:46:04] brother John personally has dealt with
[1:46:06] young people in mental institutions I've
[1:46:09] dealt with uh underage they're not even
[1:46:12] adults I've gone into institutions like
[1:46:14] brother Branham talked about in
[1:46:15] Louisville when he crossed the the river
[1:46:18] that Sunday afternoon to deal with a a
[1:46:21] young person there was two ladies they
[1:46:23] were 17 and 18 years old and they were
[1:46:26] very smart and they were dealing with
[1:46:28] overtures and things and writing songs
[1:46:30] and you know they got in an environment
[1:46:32] where Pete someone was making fun of
[1:46:34] them how they dressed and their long
[1:46:36] hair and long dress and and they started
[1:46:39] to make fun of them and one of the young
[1:46:41] ladies was kind of stronger and she was
[1:46:43] able to throw it off and said oh we know
[1:46:45] who we are and where where we're going
[1:46:47] but the other young lady kind of took it
[1:46:50] personal and it wounded her spirit who
[1:46:53] remembers what I'm talking about and she
[1:46:54] got into this institution and they were
[1:46:57] gonna turn her over to Madison which
[1:47:00] brother John was born in New Albany in
[1:47:02] Madison was just up the road there and
[1:47:04] and Anna and so they were going to turn
[1:47:06] her over to Madison and brother Branham
[1:47:09] walked in there and he said you had to
[1:47:11] go into the elevator and they closed the
[1:47:14] door and it was padded and go up to a
[1:47:16] certain floor and the doors would lock
[1:47:17] behind you and he went in and spoke to
[1:47:19] the uh young lady and I'm not going to
[1:47:22] go into that account I think her name
[1:47:24] was Margaret but brother Brandon began
[1:47:26] to speak to her and talk to her and all
[1:47:29] the medication and all the doctors and
[1:47:31] all the years that she had been in that
[1:47:33] situation but the Lord Jesus gave
[1:47:36] brother Branham the word and began to go
[1:47:38] back in her life and catch her wandering
[1:47:41] spirit and bring it back to her
[1:47:45] and he just said something about all
[1:47:48] your life you've been Desiring to marry
[1:47:50] a minister
[1:47:53] and he said that that caught her spirit
[1:47:56] just to say something that seems so why
[1:47:59] would you even be talking about that but
[1:48:01] it went out there and it caught her
[1:48:03] spirit and brought it back and by that
[1:48:05] evening she's already sitting up in bed
[1:48:07] and they were releasing her from the
[1:48:09] hospital the next day
[1:48:11] I want to say praise the Lord that that
[1:48:14] God even had time to go after a troubled
[1:48:17] heart
[1:48:19] brother John has been
[1:48:21] across from young ladies that have been
[1:48:24] born and raised in the message in
[1:48:26] institutions like that
[1:48:28] and it just tears your heart out brother
[1:48:30] Gerald to be in a situation where you
[1:48:33] know the families and you know this dear
[1:48:35] person this young lady and Satan would
[1:48:37] ravish their lives and get them so upset
[1:48:40] I've been in another room I'll remember
[1:48:43] a young lady just being torn and smashed
[1:48:46] up and her life just going through a
[1:48:49] relationship a shift and and things that
[1:48:52] happened that night and going on the
[1:48:56] road and smashing headlong face on with
[1:48:59] another vehicle and I went into the
[1:49:00] hospital and she just all messed up her
[1:49:03] a order was just burst her her legs her
[1:49:06] hip and Bones were just crushed and
[1:49:09] things and I remember going in is this
[1:49:11] okay tonight
[1:49:12] I I went in and I remember because she
[1:49:16] wasn't living right and she wasn't where
[1:49:17] she should be with the Lord and her
[1:49:19] fingernails she was a white sister she
[1:49:22] had black Phoenix fingernails on and I
[1:49:24] remember kneeling down and praying with
[1:49:26] her
[1:49:27] and I want to say tonight God brought
[1:49:29] her out of that trouble she was able to
[1:49:32] marry a real Godly brother and she just
[1:49:34] had a new baby in the last few weeks
[1:49:36] serving the lord and her life has just
[1:49:39] been like a rocket ship going up in the
[1:49:42] presence of the Lord I want to say
[1:49:44] wherever you're at Tonight There's Hope
[1:49:46] for you
[1:49:48] I will restore Rings through this little
[1:49:51] church building
[1:49:55] Brokenness
[1:49:56] will not break you
[1:50:00] I remember where that came into my heart
[1:50:03] I was in a certain meeting I hope you
[1:50:05] don't mind me speaking some of these
[1:50:06] testimonies
[1:50:08] do you all mind that or
[1:50:10] I believe the word can heal someone just
[1:50:12] sitting right in their chair not even
[1:50:14] laying hands on them just the word
[1:50:16] healing them testimonies
[1:50:19] being in a church coming through covet
[1:50:21] and it was just coming through it was
[1:50:23] last year sometime and you know how
[1:50:25] everyone masked do you wear masks do you
[1:50:27] don't wear masks should we come to
[1:50:28] church should we stream all these
[1:50:30] nonsense that we all had to go through
[1:50:32] and well this certain service the the
[1:50:34] pastor felt to have people come forward
[1:50:37] that had needs you know and we were
[1:50:38] praying like right there with people and
[1:50:40] I still remember the pastor he's just
[1:50:43] praying right in front of a person you
[1:50:44] know this is Coveted time this is where
[1:50:47] people are afraid you know and here he
[1:50:49] calls me up and I'm right next to him
[1:50:50] and we're praying for people and just
[1:50:52] praying for the needs of the people and
[1:50:55] I remember going back to my seat and the
[1:50:57] Lord putting that right into my thoughts
[1:50:59] and I wrote it down on the piece of
[1:51:01] paper I still have it in my Bible
[1:51:03] Brokenness will never break you
[1:51:08] I wrote it down this morning in my notes
[1:51:11] as I Was preparing for tonight I want to
[1:51:13] speak to all of you no matter what
[1:51:15] you're going through no matter what has
[1:51:17] happened in your life you might feel
[1:51:19] broken tonight but it will not break you
[1:51:24] wounded hearts when and have it
[1:51:29] that came to my heart today maybe I'll
[1:51:31] speak on that at another place at
[1:51:33] another time but wounded hearts when in
[1:51:36] heaven
[1:51:38] foreign
[1:51:39] there are events that have happened in
[1:51:41] our lives and there's happenings in life
[1:51:43] that we cannot reverse
[1:51:48] we would like to do that
[1:51:52] we would like to do that for ourselves
[1:51:54] and we would like to do that for others
[1:51:55] that we deal with how many know what I'm
[1:51:58] talking about you wish that it could be
[1:52:01] reversed you wished that that never
[1:52:04] happened to that person
[1:52:06] because you can see that they're really
[1:52:08] struggling with that you can see that
[1:52:10] Satan really has them on the ropes
[1:52:14] and you would like to go back and
[1:52:16] reverse that
[1:52:17] but there's things we cannot take back
[1:52:20] we cannot undo and I find that in
[1:52:22] brother branham's ministry as I listen
[1:52:24] to him today in healing lines and things
[1:52:27] and it was never like he was trying to
[1:52:29] undo the past but he was allowing the
[1:52:32] Lord Jesus to meet the person at their
[1:52:35] present point of need right here
[1:52:39] and then let the Lord do what he wanted
[1:52:41] to do
[1:52:45] I'm going back now to last year
[1:52:49] I'm going to back to last year I think
[1:52:52] it was about January was the time
[1:52:57] and there was a mother in the message
[1:52:59] she has four teenagers from young
[1:53:01] teenagers all the way to late teens she
[1:53:04] had teenagers in her home and she saw
[1:53:06] the direction
[1:53:08] of her children she is a minister's wife
[1:53:10] and so she was burdened about the needs
[1:53:13] in the church and burdened about the
[1:53:16] needs in the message she's a very
[1:53:17] wonderful sister if she was here tonight
[1:53:20] you would really love her
[1:53:22] she began to write these words on little
[1:53:25] Post-it notes and on notes all through
[1:53:27] the house I will restore saith the Lord
[1:53:34] you can see one of her sons probably
[1:53:36] like swords or something
[1:53:39] she wrote it above the beds in the house
[1:53:46] this was a burden of a mother
[1:53:49] that had teenagers I will restore saith
[1:53:54] the Lord how many can see that on the
[1:53:55] screen
[1:53:56] she wrote it on the microwave so no
[1:53:58] matter who was preparing their meal as
[1:54:01] you know with teenagers and a busy home
[1:54:03] things can be going in all kinds of
[1:54:05] directions mothers fathers
[1:54:07] teenagers I
[1:54:10] will restore saith the Lord it was a
[1:54:14] burden it was a desire I means God is
[1:54:18] going to do this for us
[1:54:21] I will restore saith the Lord
[1:54:24] she wrote it on mirrors in the bedrooms
[1:54:27] on their mirrors when they tried to get
[1:54:29] ready to go to school or go to work or
[1:54:32] go to the store I will restore saith the
[1:54:36] Lord
[1:54:37] she wrote it on their master bedroom
[1:54:39] window uh a mirrors in the mirrors in
[1:54:42] the bathrooms I will restore saith the
[1:54:46] Lord oh this is some of our people's
[1:54:49] favorite places the refrigerator
[1:54:51] she wrote it on the refrigerator
[1:54:56] she was burdened
[1:54:58] she was earnest
[1:55:00] she wanted to get the message across
[1:55:03] I'll tell you friends we need to let the
[1:55:05] message get through
[1:55:07] like the little messenger Dove that was
[1:55:10] that was shot at and shot out in those
[1:55:12] Wing torn off in its and its feet torn
[1:55:15] and blood is going everywhere but it
[1:55:18] fell behind the Enemy Lines and though
[1:55:20] there was blood everywhere and though it
[1:55:21] wasn't the most beautiful dove in the
[1:55:24] family but the message got through and
[1:55:27] we need to get the message through to
[1:55:28] one another
[1:55:30] Hallelujah has anybody here ever had
[1:55:33] problems in your life
[1:55:38] have you ever had a problem or do you
[1:55:41] have a problem tonight so we all know
[1:55:43] what we're talking about then the
[1:55:45] message has got to get through that I
[1:55:47] will restore all the years all the
[1:55:50] situations all the months of whatever
[1:55:52] you've gone through in your life God is
[1:55:54] saying tonight that I know all about it
[1:55:57] I know where you've been I know what
[1:56:00] you've been thinking I know in your
[1:56:01] family I know in the message I know in
[1:56:05] your church
[1:56:06] God knows all the fine print you don't
[1:56:09] have to spend a four-hour counseling
[1:56:11] session with him tonight going over all
[1:56:14] the details he just says I know
[1:56:17] isn't that wonderful
[1:56:21] as you look up from your hospital bed
[1:56:23] and look into the face of Jesus and to
[1:56:25] know that he knows
[1:56:28] I will restore
[1:56:31] she wrote it on the Windows of their
[1:56:33] house
[1:56:34] can you believe this this is a picture
[1:56:37] looking out of the of a believer's home
[1:56:40] outside can you see the trees
[1:56:43] I will restore saith the Lord she wrote
[1:56:47] it on the wall she wrote notes it was
[1:56:50] all through her house
[1:56:52] of this promise
[1:56:54] of I will restore
[1:56:57] so I thought about what about today
[1:57:00] does God still restore
[1:57:03] is God able to take a mind is he able to
[1:57:06] take a troubled spirit
[1:57:08] is he able to take a body that's wrapped
[1:57:10] by pain
[1:57:12] is he able to take a soul that's that is
[1:57:15] in distress and out of order I will
[1:57:17] restore Joel chapter 2 verse 25 I will
[1:57:21] restore to you the years that the
[1:57:23] locusts hath eaten the canker worm and
[1:57:25] the caterpillar and the palm of worm my
[1:57:27] great Army which I sin among you that
[1:57:30] that word of years is a division of time
[1:57:32] it's a measurement of time
[1:57:35] it's an indication of a part of an age
[1:57:38] Satan wants to create Havoc at this time
[1:57:41] of our age the laodicean age the bride
[1:57:45] age Satan wants to cause havoc
[1:57:48] and he wants to eat away
[1:57:51] and all those things that God is sowing
[1:57:53] within your life where it could be a
[1:57:55] lifetime of years of your life God is
[1:57:58] saying to you I will restore to you the
[1:58:02] years
[1:58:03] Now The New International Version and
[1:58:06] The New American Standard Version just
[1:58:08] watch this are we feeding okay tonight
[1:58:10] when the Bible says I will repay you for
[1:58:14] the years that the Locust has eaten
[1:58:18] the great Locust and the young locusts
[1:58:20] the other locusts and the locust swarm
[1:58:24] Maya just seems like Satan's comes
[1:58:27] sometimes and you're able to Ward it off
[1:58:28] and then there's sometimes it just comes
[1:58:31] from this way then it comes from that
[1:58:33] way then comes from this way like a
[1:58:35] swarm
[1:58:36] and God is saying to you I will repay
[1:58:39] you for the years and all the damage
[1:58:42] that has caused in your family in your
[1:58:45] life in your church in the message I
[1:58:48] will repay you
[1:58:49] in the in The New American Standard the
[1:58:52] but it says then I will make up to you
[1:58:55] for the years that the swarming Locust
[1:58:58] has eaten the creeping locusts the
[1:59:02] stripping Locust and the gnawing Locus
[1:59:05] oh that really describes the devil
[1:59:08] he goes about like a roaring lion
[1:59:13] trying to destroy you trying to get you
[1:59:16] to the place that you just feel like
[1:59:18] it's all over there's no hope for you
[1:59:20] there you'll it'll never be you'll never
[1:59:22] be a good Christian
[1:59:25] come on specialist speak to us Lord amen
[1:59:28] come down into our private lives
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:32] use the minister to say something that
[1:59:34] our teenagers thought this afternoon or
[1:59:36] late last night or this week what your
[1:59:39] wife thought about her what a single
[1:59:41] sister in the church is going through
[1:59:43] Lord use the minister
[1:59:46] he came all the way from the west coast
[1:59:48] to the East Coast
[1:59:49] to give you a message
[1:59:52] you don't even know him he don't even
[1:59:54] know you but God knows you
[1:59:57] he knows beforehand he God knows
[2:00:00] beforehand he knows before the trial he
[2:00:03] knows why you're going through the trial
[2:00:06] and he knows after the trial and he's
[2:00:08] saying I'm going to restore you now is
[2:00:12] God a liar
[2:00:15] I'm getting personal
[2:00:16] is God a liar
[2:00:18] that and so many other people's case he
[2:00:21] can come through and be victorious but
[2:00:24] you know you're kind of a special case
[2:00:29] your case is kind of one of those
[2:00:31] special ones and
[2:00:33] you know he just shakes his head and
[2:00:36] well I don't know about your case
[2:00:40] come on come on I'm talking to you we
[2:00:43] getting a pity party we we get a victim
[2:00:46] mentality we we start thinking you know
[2:00:48] everybody's against me and nobody cares
[2:00:51] and I'm going to the Garden to eat worms
[2:00:57] we think like we're not a good we don't
[2:00:59] have the Holy Ghost we think like we're
[2:01:01] Judas yeah
[2:01:03] we act the part we do all the mechanics
[2:01:06] but down in our heart Satan's been
[2:01:08] gnawing at our peace he's gnawing at our
[2:01:11] joy he's gnawing at our confidence and
[2:01:14] then something happens in your marriage
[2:01:15] or something happens in your job or or
[2:01:18] you fail a test or you actually do
[2:01:21] something willingly
[2:01:23] to hurt the Lord
[2:01:25] it's called iniquity
[2:01:28] and you think you've crossed the line
[2:01:30] and you think like it's all over but you
[2:01:33] know the next service or the next
[2:01:34] morning there's still that something
[2:01:36] that's knocking at the door of your
[2:01:38] heart do you know what that is that's
[2:01:40] the Lord Jesus
[2:01:42] and it's also Vindication that you're a
[2:01:45] seed of God
[2:01:46] because God doesn't deal with serpent
[2:01:48] seed the way that she deals with you
[2:01:54] there'll be people that God deals with
[2:01:56] one time
[2:01:57] and that's it
[2:02:00] and at the day of judgment it'll be that
[2:02:02] sign on the wall or that person that
[2:02:04] came through their checkout line and
[2:02:06] it'll be the Holy Spirit at that meeting
[2:02:08] or that special services and he'll deal
[2:02:10] with them and never deal with them again
[2:02:15] but with you it's just not like that he
[2:02:19] just keeps coming around he keeps coming
[2:02:21] around and you shut the door you get
[2:02:23] cold something happens and and you just
[2:02:25] kind of harden up a little bit and kind
[2:02:27] of maybe resist him or get disenchanted
[2:02:30] and you know what he'll he'll give you
[2:02:32] space
[2:02:33] he's a wonderful father and a wonderful
[2:02:35] husband he's never abused any person
[2:02:39] he's never been mean or nasty
[2:02:42] amen the way of the transgressor is hard
[2:02:46] but you know if you're a seed of God
[2:02:48] you're going to come around again and
[2:02:49] there'll be a time that if you just keep
[2:02:52] slamming the front door he'll creep
[2:02:54] around to the back door
[2:02:56] he'll come up through an attic he'll
[2:02:58] come through the side he'll he'll let
[2:03:00] you know that I see your life I know you
[2:03:03] and I will restore saith the Lord
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:09] you're not too far that God can't reach
[2:03:11] you
[2:03:12] or you wouldn't be feeling the way you
[2:03:14] do right now
[2:03:16] that's the Holy Spirit
[2:03:19] so when the Bible says I will restore
[2:03:23] and if you want to write some of this
[2:03:24] down it might be good to take the
[2:03:26] medicine
[2:03:28] it's to be in a covenant of peace with
[2:03:30] you
[2:03:32] I'm gonna bring you back to peace
[2:03:36] I'm going to make things to be complete
[2:03:39] again for you
[2:03:42] it's going to be sound your mind is
[2:03:44] going to be sound
[2:03:46] your spirit is going to be strong
[2:03:50] you're gonna make it
[2:03:53] you know God is more interested in you
[2:03:56] having the Holy Spirit than you are
[2:03:58] having the holy spirit in fact brother
[2:04:00] Branham said he wants to give it to you
[2:04:02] more than you desire it you say well I
[2:04:05] have a desire for the Lord or I have a
[2:04:07] desire to draw closer to the Lord or I
[2:04:10] would like to receive the Holy Spirit
[2:04:11] what do you think that is that's not a
[2:04:13] demon spirit
[2:04:15] that's the Holy Spirit trying to
[2:04:18] press himself into you
[2:04:20] like all the Waters of the ocean trying
[2:04:23] to come down into a little pipe that
[2:04:25] that's what it would be like all of the
[2:04:27] waters out there in the ocean you all
[2:04:29] live near the ocean right I I live near
[2:04:31] the ocean
[2:04:32] the other ocean amen
[2:04:35] yeah all the pressure of all the ocean
[2:04:37] coming down into a little pipe that
[2:04:40] would be the pressure of the love of God
[2:04:42] trying to come down to your life
[2:04:45] how did somebody say thank you Jesus I
[2:04:48] will restore means I'm gonna finish this
[2:04:50] I'm gonna bring it to an end and it's
[2:04:53] kind of like the three Hebrew children
[2:04:54] you're going to come out of this
[2:04:56] uninjured
[2:04:59] like kind of like the Lion's Den with
[2:05:01] Daniel
[2:05:04] those that sought to destroy you are the
[2:05:07] ones that's going to be destroyed
[2:05:09] those that despised you are the ones
[2:05:12] that's going to be judged but you're
[2:05:13] going to come out of this uninjured
[2:05:16] say but what about all my hearts and my
[2:05:19] scars I'm going to get to that in a few
[2:05:21] minutes are you what about my spirit
[2:05:23] brother John I just I'm wrestling with
[2:05:25] this to why it happened and what do I
[2:05:27] need to do and brother brother John I'm
[2:05:29] just seemed so unsettled
[2:05:33] God's gonna make you safe
[2:05:35] you're safe tonight
[2:05:38] he's gonna make you whole he's going to
[2:05:40] make you good
[2:05:42] you know there's a there's a plaque
[2:05:44] brother John travels a lot in the past
[2:05:46] in evangelism and and sometimes now we
[2:05:49] fly out of Seattle and when we come out
[2:05:51] of the Seattle how many knows when you
[2:05:54] come out of the airplane there's a long
[2:05:55] jet way up to the where the inside of
[2:05:58] the airport is who's ever traveled
[2:06:00] before that jet way there and when
[2:06:02] you're walking up the side sometimes
[2:06:04] they have signs on the wall and it's
[2:06:06] advertisements and things but there's a
[2:06:08] certain sign in Seattle that says you
[2:06:10] are now entering a safe place
[2:06:14] this is a safe place
[2:06:16] that means if if you've been trafficking

[2:09:19] praise the Lord
[2:09:20] let's praise God
[2:09:24] I thank you Jesus I love you Lord it
[2:09:27] might start like that it might start
[2:09:29] like this but then it gets like this and
[2:09:30] then you start weeping a little bit then
[2:09:32] you start crying a little bit and then
[2:09:34] you start nodding your head a little bit
[2:09:36] you know that's true brother John I know
[2:09:37] and then pretty soon it's like yes Lord
[2:09:39] like thank you Jesus
[2:09:41] Hallelujah it ought to be that way Lord
[2:09:45] God's Gonna Give You compensation and
[2:09:47] make up for those weary jury nights
[2:09:51] and those nightmares are going to start
[2:09:53] turning into God's presence now moving
[2:09:55] the angels of God are going to start
[2:09:57] ministering to you I'm going to make it
[2:10:00] good for you
[2:10:02] I'm gonna reward you I'm gonna perform
[2:10:04] my good word I'm going to repay you and
[2:10:06] make an end of this what brother John is
[2:10:08] preaching about tonight isn't just for
[2:10:10] the preachers
[2:10:12] Detroit I'm speaking about a sister
[2:10:16] that had four teenagers
[2:10:19] and she saw what they was going through
[2:10:21] she saw the turmoil
[2:10:25] she wrote this down
[2:10:29] it wasn't a comic book it wasn't a
[2:10:31] YouTube link first you know some other
[2:10:33] dress or some she was serious about her
[2:10:36] family she was burdened
[2:10:38] for the situation she wanted to see a
[2:10:41] change and so she posted these letters
[2:10:43] all over the house on the refrigerator
[2:10:46] on the mirror she began to post them on
[2:10:48] the on the different areas the microwave
[2:10:51] on the master bedroom uh mirror she
[2:10:53] began to post him on the living room
[2:10:55] mirror on the doorway
[2:10:58] God give us more mothers like that let
[2:11:01] me just pause right here and say may
[2:11:02] this church be full of mothers like that
[2:11:08] Spirits travel on words
[2:11:11] and we need to encourage one another
[2:11:12] with positive words let me say that
[2:11:15] again Spirits travel on words
[2:11:18] and we need to watch our words
[2:11:21] and watch what we feed on because our
[2:11:23] thoughts are feeding on things and our
[2:11:25] thoughts become words and our words
[2:11:27] become actions
[2:11:29] so we need to start tonight to start
[2:11:31] feeding off the word and start
[2:11:33] confessing the word
[2:11:35] then later that year last year we went
[2:11:38] over to Europe and Belgium and we took a
[2:11:41] youth camp and this is just some young
[2:11:43] people from Belgium and Germany and
[2:11:47] Holland that they just gathered there in
[2:11:49] Germany for a weekend of services and it
[2:11:52] was during this this is an opening like
[2:11:55] a morning session I think this was
[2:11:57] Saturday morning and we begin to talk
[2:11:58] about covet because remember this was
[2:12:01] October of last year so covet had been
[2:12:03] over a year
[2:12:05] how this affected the young people of
[2:12:08] the message and how did it affect the
[2:12:10] young people being at home and they used
[2:12:12] to be able to go to church and they used
[2:12:14] to be able to have youth meetings they
[2:12:15] used to be able to
[2:12:17] visit their grandmothers or you know see
[2:12:20] their friends but now they're all you
[2:12:22] know
[2:12:23] in homes and now they're having to do
[2:12:26] their schoolwork remotely and so they're
[2:12:28] being forced to be on their computers
[2:12:30] more and in their bedrooms and private
[2:12:33] things is this okay that I'm talking
[2:12:35] like this I didn't bring my notes it was
[2:12:37] Pages after pages
[2:12:39] of us uh we're sitting over on the right
[2:12:42] hand side there in the top of the you
[2:12:43] can see us in the table we get we like
[2:12:45] to get right down with the young people
[2:12:47] and they begin to just speak in their
[2:12:49] groups and then they would talk about it
[2:12:51] for a little while then they would have
[2:12:52] a leader then they would all Express you
[2:12:54] know how did this affect your Christian
[2:12:56] Life how did this affect your life or in
[2:12:59] your church throughout covid and how you
[2:13:02] know what were some of the positive
[2:13:03] things what were some of the negative
[2:13:05] things and we begin to speak to the
[2:13:07] young people about this I think it's
[2:13:09] good to talk to our young people about
[2:13:10] these things I don't think it's good
[2:13:12] that you know everybody goes to their
[2:13:14] rooms and they're they never have a
[2:13:16] conversation
[2:13:18] so we opened it up like that and then we
[2:13:20] took it to the main services this is in
[2:13:23] their church I just wanted to share this
[2:13:25] I thought it might be encouraging to you
[2:13:27] to see some other believers from Europe
[2:13:29] and and this is just a young people's
[2:13:31] Gathering from several countries and so
[2:13:34] on some of the services that we had and
[2:13:37] speaking to them from our hearts this is
[2:13:39] uh the church in Belgium
[2:13:43] then we came back to the United States
[2:13:45] and took this uh youth meeting down in
[2:13:49] South Carolina
[2:13:50] and uh just speaking to them speaking
[2:13:54] about the rising generation this was one
[2:13:56] of the services that we took this is
[2:13:59] just some pictures of of the one uh part
[2:14:02] of the building that we were speaking uh
[2:14:05] to and then there's a whole nother group
[2:14:07] that sat off to the one side on the
[2:14:10] front there on the right hand side there
[2:14:12] was a whole nother room that was just
[2:14:14] full of hundreds of young people you can
[2:14:16] how many can see that on the photo and
[2:14:19] to have young people being ministered
[2:14:20] too and then to have it at the end of
[2:14:23] the service a response to the word and a
[2:14:26] response at the altar many times or
[2:14:28] responding in their seats I'm just
[2:14:30] standing like this some rejoicing some
[2:14:33] just dedicating themselves to the Lord I
[2:14:36] believe that God's moving amongst the
[2:14:38] bride globally
[2:14:40] amen locally and globally and I thought
[2:14:43] of that today what about today what
[2:14:46] about in Newfoundland is God moving here
[2:14:51] is God moving tonight
[2:14:54] does God want to still restore
[2:14:58] my son-in-law is a real good believer
[2:15:01] brother John Waldner and he went into
[2:15:03] the doctor's office
[2:15:05] some time ago and he saw this sign
[2:15:07] hanging and he took a photo
[2:15:10] please limit each office visit to one to
[2:15:15] two issues only
[2:15:18] the doctor's office
[2:15:22] people coming in and they just want to
[2:15:24] tell all their needs and tell all that
[2:15:26] they're going through and it's the
[2:15:28] medical field is so overwhelmed and so
[2:15:30] you know please keep it to one or two
[2:15:33] issues only
[2:15:37] and I thought Lord May that never sign
[2:15:40] never hang in our message churches
[2:15:43] God can take all the issues
[2:15:47] could you imagine brother coffee us
[2:15:49] putting that up in a message Church
[2:15:52] only one or two issues only per person
[2:15:58] I tell you our God's bigger than all of
[2:16:00] that he's he's better than the medical
[2:16:02] system
[2:16:04] we don't need to talk to the secretary
[2:16:06] we need the Lord
[2:16:08] we don't need to talk to the minister
[2:16:10] only we need to talk to the lord it's
[2:16:13] not our mother or our father or the
[2:16:15] Sunday school teacher or the Deacon we
[2:16:17] want to go all the way brother
[2:16:19] and I thought isn't that amazing that
[2:16:22] the medical field is saying don't come
[2:16:24] in here and unload on us
[2:16:27] you've only got 10 minutes and then you
[2:16:28] we need we need out of here
[2:16:31] this person has issues too
[2:16:38] look at us tonight we're all here
[2:16:40] together all of our issues
[2:16:44] we all come to church and put on our
[2:16:47] nice clothes you know and
[2:16:49] tomorrow it'll probably be more bling
[2:16:52] blingy you know or I'll be dressed up
[2:16:54] and
[2:16:55] y'all smell it brother John amen
[2:16:57] tomorrow's Sunday
[2:16:59] and we all dressed so nice and we come
[2:17:02] in and
[2:17:03] we're all good and
[2:17:06] but really sometimes it's not all good
[2:17:10] really sometimes if we'd be honest we're
[2:17:12] bearing burdens
[2:17:15] and baron cares
[2:17:17] that we really don't want to talk to
[2:17:19] nobody about
[2:17:22] many times we carry these for weeks and
[2:17:25] maybe months
[2:17:26] it's amazing the Bible would say
[2:17:29] I will restore the years because
[2:17:32] sometimes things can go on
[2:17:34] for years
[2:17:36] and we never thought in the message we
[2:17:38] would raise our families and out of five
[2:17:41] children
[2:17:42] maybe two of them serve the Lord
[2:17:47] well am I going to get quiet on me
[2:17:48] tonight
[2:17:50] we never thought we'd have children and
[2:17:51] six children in the message and raised
[2:17:54] under the token and raised at camp
[2:17:56] meetings and go into youth services and
[2:17:58] having Sunday school and having church
[2:18:00] and having conventions and having all of
[2:18:03] this and out of six children maybe three
[2:18:05] are serving the lord tonight
[2:18:09] we never thought you'd have children and
[2:18:11] have three children on my beautiful
[2:18:13] children my lovely children all these
[2:18:16] precious children in the message
[2:18:18] and when we all get to heaven what a day
[2:18:21] of rejoicing that will be and then two
[2:18:24] of the children choose to not follow in
[2:18:26] the way of the Lord
[2:18:28] and it becomes a big burden
[2:18:32] and then some begin to question the
[2:18:34] message
[2:18:35] some begin to question the Lord
[2:18:38] preach I'm talking to you tonight I'm a
[2:18:42] specialist
[2:18:43] I'm not going to be general doctor MD
[2:18:45] tonight I'm I'm not going to be like

[2:18:54] years we've we've heard a lot of things

[2:19:00] and after the special meetings brother

[2:19:04] my home and my family and my issues and

[2:19:29] Lord is my life just like numb numbly
[2:19:33] going through life am I just shuffling
[2:19:35] down the road kicking the rock down the
[2:19:38] road is there ever any answer to all of
[2:19:41] this I'm going to tell you tonight God
[2:19:44] is here Among Us I will restore means
[2:19:47] that God is very present to your
[2:19:49] situation
[2:19:52] how many can say Amen to what brother
[2:19:55] how many can appreciate the word tonight
[2:19:58] Psalms 107 verse 20 says he sent his
[2:20:02] word and healed them and delivered them
[2:20:05] from their destructions let's all read
[2:20:08] this out loud together let's read it he
[2:20:10] sent his word and healed them and
[2:20:14] delivered them from their distractions
[2:20:16] he healed them he made them helpful
[2:20:20] speaking of God being our healer he's a
[2:20:23] physician he's my physician
[2:20:28] man you are really a case
[2:20:31] you're a hard case
[2:20:33] well why don't you say but I've got

[2:20:42] case

[2:20:47] Lord's got my case
[2:20:49] and if the Lord can't bring anything
[2:20:51] good out of this nobody can
[2:20:54] how many of y'all's ever thought Lord
[2:20:56] what do you do with people like me
[2:21:00] I'm being serious how many of y'all ever
[2:21:02] thought that Lord what do you do with
[2:21:04] people like me

[2:21:09] do you do with people like me
[2:21:13] I'll just leave it right there amen

[2:21:49] aisles tonight we might all be shaking

[2:21:55] word out
[2:21:56] and it's bringing healing to the church
[2:21:59] it deals with hurts of the Nations and

[2:22:27] surely as Believers we've mature enough
[2:22:30] to know that
[2:22:31] it's not all about you
[2:22:34] surely we're Way Beyond being selfish
[2:22:37] and think that everything revolves
[2:22:39] around you
[2:22:40] I know you that raised children know
[2:22:42] what I'm talking about they just think
[2:22:43] everything revolves around them and it
[2:22:46] doesn't they're gonna find out it

[2:22:49] somebody fires them or somebody gives

[2:22:56] oh no policeman you were you were

[2:23:37] I'm talking about in the message
[2:23:39] where did we lose that feeling of I am
[2:23:41] wrong

[2:24:05] we're Saturday night tomorrow's our last
[2:24:07] service
[2:24:10] y'all doing okay
[2:24:13] we're like a tree when you cut a tree it
[2:24:16] talks about the years
[2:24:18] how old that tree is and you can look at
[2:24:21] the rings of a tree and see if it was a
[2:24:24] rainy season or if it was a dry season
[2:24:26] if it was rainy the the Rings are
[2:24:28] farther apart if it was a dry season
[2:24:30] they're close together
[2:24:32] it's called seasons of life
[2:24:35] but the tree just keeps growing
[2:24:38] now in this tree a certain year there
[2:24:41] was a forest fire that came through the
[2:24:43] community
[2:24:44] it was a real fire it was a bad thing
[2:24:48] but did the tree live beyond the fire
[2:24:52] on the picture here can you see did the
[2:24:54] tree live beyond
[2:24:56] that's why when we say when you go
[2:24:58] through things I mean you will go
[2:25:00] through things
[2:25:01] but it leaves a scar you can tell in
[2:25:04] that person's life that even for the
[2:25:06] years after you can see the growth
[2:25:09] it's affected by this let me show you in
[2:25:12] this next slide how this tree that is 24
[2:25:14] years old
[2:25:17] how there came a certain knot
[2:25:19] a certain naughty situation it was about
[2:25:22] year it looks like you're about between
[2:25:25] 10 and 12.
[2:25:27] like there was a knot like there was an
[2:25:29] issue that happened and it looks like it
[2:25:33] was about five years long it just went
[2:25:36] through this not this issue it came
[2:25:38] around
[2:25:40] to October 16th or
[2:25:43] February 20th and every time it would
[2:25:46] come around you're dealing with this
[2:25:48] naughty issue this attitude
[2:25:51] or there's something in your marriage or
[2:25:53] uh the church or this it always brings
[2:25:57] up these bad feelings and it just seems
[2:25:59] like when it came around
[2:26:02] and you can see the bark of that tree
[2:26:04] actually grew into this other tree how
[2:26:08] many can see that it it was like a knot
[2:26:11] and that dark part is the Bark of the
[2:26:14] other situation
[2:26:17] and you had to get around it you had to
[2:26:19] keep going
[2:26:21] you had to go to March you had to go to
[2:26:23] April I'm talking spiritual language
[2:26:25] because you are the Bright Tree how many
[2:26:28] know you're the bride tree you just
[2:26:30] gotta keep going you can see though how
[2:26:32] this knot and this actually affected
[2:26:35] this tree for years to come
[2:26:38] you say but brother John I'm a Believer
[2:26:40] you know everything's going to be smooth
[2:26:42] you know you serve the Lord everything's
[2:26:43] just going to be easy Street
[2:26:45] well who lied to you
[2:26:48] who who gave you that something I mean
[2:26:50] you're on something you need to and it's
[2:26:52] not the Holy Ghost the Bible talks about
[2:26:54] many are the afflictions of the
[2:26:56] righteous
[2:26:58] I mean if you're single and you think
[2:26:59] you've got issues just wait till you
[2:27:01] have get into a marriage and then have
[2:27:03] children then have grandchildren
[2:27:07] boy this is a good service tonight amen
[2:27:09] thank you Lord for having this service
[2:27:11] amen everybody thinks when the children
[2:27:13] grow up and they get out of the house
[2:27:15] it's all gonna no no no brother you
[2:27:17] start finding out there's burdens to
[2:27:19] life
[2:27:21] that's why we need to seek out our mate
[2:27:23] and really seek the Lord and let it be a
[2:27:25] spiritual event and you don't want to
[2:27:28] marry the wrong person
[2:27:30] but you also don't want to be a skeleton
[2:27:32] sitting on the tree saying well I didn't
[2:27:34] want to marry the wrong person and you
[2:27:36] turn out to be 85 and you you've had
[2:27:38] that fear your whole life
[2:27:42] you think it's funny I saw a picture of
[2:27:44] that today
[2:27:46] it was a female that was sitting on a
[2:27:48] park bench bench it's just her skeleton
[2:27:50] bones
[2:27:53] and she sat there her whole life
[2:27:56] and she finally died
[2:27:59] nobody was ever good enough nobody ever
[2:28:01] made enough money nobody was whatever
[2:28:04] and she got so old she just died there
[2:28:06] skeletons sitting on a park bench
[2:28:08] waiting for Mr Right
[2:28:12] I don't know who your spouse is gonna be
[2:28:14] I don't know God's perfect will is for
[2:28:16] your life you're supposed to wrestle
[2:28:17] that out
[2:28:18] we don't need the pastor to be telling
[2:28:20] us who to marry
[2:28:23] need the Lord Jesus to tell us who we're
[2:28:25] gonna
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:27] and then sometimes I'm just going to be
[2:28:29] honest people make mistakes
[2:28:32] and they marry the wrong person
[2:28:35] and we have people in our churches that
[2:28:37] are divorced or they're separated
[2:28:40] we have single mothers or single fathers
[2:28:43] it doesn't mean life is over it doesn't
[2:28:46] mean that you'll never be a contribution
[2:28:49] to the church we need to serve the Lord
[2:28:51] no matter what our status in life no
[2:28:54] matter our marriage or our failure or
[2:28:56] whether you're single or older single or
[2:28:59] I better move along amen do you all get
[2:29:02] what I'm talking about we need to go
[2:29:04] through the knots in our lives and stop
[2:29:06] getting so naughty about it
[2:29:10] k-n-o-t-t-y
[2:29:12] whatever that is in French amen
[2:29:16] you see it on this next slide someone
[2:29:17] was 20 years old
[2:29:20] 20 years of their life it was just they
[2:29:22] didn't get a lot of rain they didn't get
[2:29:24] a lot of moisture they didn't get a lot
[2:29:27] of
[2:29:28] revivals boom and something happened 20
[2:29:32] years old and for the next nine years
[2:29:34] how many can see that on the screen it
[2:29:36] just the year was full of and it just
[2:29:39] water and nutrients that they would call
[2:29:42] it biosolids
[2:29:44] scientifically
[2:29:45] and something was added to this person
[2:29:48] let's just say let's just say they gave
[2:29:50] their heart to the Lord
[2:29:52] let's just say God revealed the message
[2:29:53] to them and all of a sudden from that
[2:29:56] time they began to grow and grow and
[2:29:59] grow then I say Lord add some water to
[2:30:02] our lives I will restore mean something
[2:30:05] happened to me at that year and from
[2:30:07] that time I began to grow it was like
[2:30:09] Leaps and Bounds it was just like we
[2:30:11] said last night God putting a key in the
[2:30:13] lock and turning it and and I've been
[2:30:16] living in this dark room for a long time
[2:30:18] brother
[2:30:20] and God just I ca I I went through the
[2:30:23] door and I walked out in and it's just
[2:30:25] been like a new day brother it's like I
[2:30:28] got a new lease on life it's like I see
[2:30:30] things differently it's the Lord Jesus
[2:30:33] saying I will restore
[2:30:34] [Music]
[2:30:37] walk through the door tonight
[2:30:40] he's standing at the door saying I want
[2:30:42] you to come out of that dark room
[2:30:47] and you come to church and you're
[2:30:49] playing the part and you're trying to
[2:30:51] look the part and the Lord wants you to
[2:30:53] take another step towards him
[2:30:56] this is my last slide on this subject
[2:31:01] all the years and years and years and
[2:31:03] then there was a fire scar there was
[2:31:05] something that went through that church
[2:31:08] and it really caused a scar
[2:31:11] and for years and years and years
[2:31:13] whenever it came around to that issue
[2:31:16] and around to that it really affected
[2:31:19] that but do you all see it just kept on
[2:31:21] living
[2:31:23] it didn't roll over and die
[2:31:26] and when you felt like it and when you
[2:31:28] felt like my life is over God says no I
[2:31:32] have more for you
[2:31:33] let's get up and go
[2:31:36] you know friends I'll be honest there's
[2:31:38] sometimes you just dress and you go out
[2:31:40] the door and you go to work or you go to
[2:31:42] church and you don't feel a lot
[2:31:45] you don't feel a lot
[2:31:48] it's not all about feelings
[2:31:50] as you grow in the Lord You've begin to
[2:31:52] realize there's good days bad days
[2:31:55] there's bad things that happen to good
[2:31:57] people
[2:31:58] it don't mean you're a devil it don't
[2:32:00] mean your serpent seat
[2:32:02] Hallelujah say I'm a Son of God I'm a
[2:32:05] daughter of God and if God never speaks
[2:32:07] to me again he has spoken to me enough
[2:32:11] where is all the Abrahams in the message
[2:32:13] that if God don't talk to me for 20
[2:32:15] years I'm still gonna serve him amen
[2:32:17] listen friends you've heard enough you
[2:32:20] have heard enough of the message than
[2:32:21] more than most people in the message
[2:32:25] oh but I've got to hear from God every
[2:32:27] service and next week if God Don't Talk
[2:32:29] To Me by Tuesday night at eight o'clock
[2:32:31] I'm walking away
[2:32:34] well who gave you that attitude
[2:32:38] who gave you that spirit
[2:32:40] people in the world are more resilient
[2:32:42] than that
[2:32:44] I'm being honest sometimes people in the
[2:32:46] message are a bunch of babies yeah
[2:32:49] forgive me for the next 30 seconds but
[2:32:51] they get so Baby Fat and
[2:32:54] sometimes people in the world are more
[2:32:56] resilient they don't even have the Holy
[2:32:58] Ghost
[2:33:00] they don't even have God and sometimes
[2:33:02] there's a divorce and they just they
[2:33:04] find another life they find another they
[2:33:06] find another hobby they find and they
[2:33:08] live single and they're not even
[2:33:10] believers they just and they go on and
[2:33:12] they just serve they just they're not
[2:33:14] even in the message
[2:33:16] boom something like how that happened to
[2:33:19] one of us and it's like the end of the
[2:33:20] world
[2:33:21] it's like we got hit by a Big Mac Truck
[2:33:26] I'm not taking away the feelings of
[2:33:28] getting hit by a Big Mac Truck and I'm
[2:33:30] not belittling what's happened in any of
[2:33:32] your lives I hope you're not
[2:33:34] misunderstanding
[2:33:36] I'm just trying to give you
[2:33:38] some medicine
[2:33:40] to say you're bigger than that you're
[2:33:42] better than that of people in the world
[2:33:43] can be more resilient than us in the
[2:33:46] message we've missed something
[2:33:48] we're not living as close to Jesus as we
[2:33:51] say we are
[2:33:52] we need to get more out of our services
[2:33:55] we need our services to carry in a
[2:33:57] greater atmosphere and and our ministers
[2:34:00] to be more honest with us
[2:34:07] you know
[2:34:08] last year
[2:34:10] can I continue on a few more minutes
[2:34:13] last year I took my parents out
[2:34:16] to Olive Garden Olive Garden just sits
[2:34:19] across this parking lot and I took him
[2:34:21] out for their wedding anniversary this
[2:34:23] is right you know covert was just kind
[2:34:25] of still
[2:34:26] get people getting over coveted
[2:34:29] it it might have been two years ago I'm
[2:34:31] sorry it was 2020. so this was right in
[2:34:33] July
[2:34:34] and it was my parents anniversary and I
[2:34:37] took them to this Olive Garden right
[2:34:39] across the street and I saw this sign
[2:34:41] across the parking lot
[2:34:45] and I began to look at this sign the
[2:34:48] Care Center and
[2:34:51] peace health
[2:34:52] and it said the wound healing Center
[2:34:57] how many can say that
[2:34:59] and I begin to look at a wound
[2:35:02] Healing Center
[2:35:06] and I thought God
[2:35:10] if people in the world can go into a
[2:35:13] place
[2:35:14] that have had wounds
[2:35:17] and come out and be healed
[2:35:20] what about in the message
[2:35:23] is it possible
[2:35:25] the people that have gone through times
[2:35:27] of wounds
[2:35:29] can find a place of healing
[2:35:31] is it possible
[2:35:33] I begin to think about this
[2:35:36] so I begin to think about wounds I'm not
[2:35:39] going to stay on these pictures very
[2:35:40] long because some of them are a little
[2:35:42] unsightly
[2:35:44] these are wounds
[2:35:47] these are things that have actually
[2:35:49] happened to people that you can see
[2:35:51] happen to their body
[2:35:54] and we are the body of Christ
[2:35:59] and see the stages of wound healing
[2:36:02] right here
[2:36:03] you can see how things happen to a
[2:36:06] person
[2:36:07] things happen in their lives
[2:36:10] you can see how there Comes A Time of
[2:36:12] dramatic wound a drought a dramatic hurt
[2:36:15] or an accident or like a shock
[2:36:18] you hear Brother Brown talk about this
[2:36:20] in the message
[2:36:21] he'll go back in a person's life and say
[2:36:23] that happened because of a shock
[2:36:26] I see your husband that happened in the
[2:36:28] shock he was in the war and
[2:36:30] I see you sister something happened you
[2:36:32] fell down a well and the shock and the
[2:36:34] jolt of that's caused something in your
[2:36:36] abdomen but I'm speaking about now how
[2:36:38] things happen to people's lives in the
[2:36:40] message
[2:36:41] and it causes a wound
[2:36:43] and for so many years people just kind
[2:36:46] of gloss over it kind of like a medical
[2:36:48] MD with oh just get over it just get the
[2:36:50] Holy Ghost
[2:36:52] you're thinking that way about yourself
[2:36:54] you just got a demon on you sister
[2:36:55] brother you're just so and people been
[2:36:57] talking like that for years it's it's
[2:37:00] kind of like that's how it was dealt
[2:37:01] with just get the Holy Ghost
[2:37:04] yet we realized there were deep wounds
[2:37:06] and it's scars that happen to people
[2:37:11] scars are actually evidence
[2:37:15] that healing has taken place
[2:37:18] I want you to look at that thing that
[2:37:19] happened in your life when you look down
[2:37:21] and see it from now on I want you to see
[2:37:24] that a scar
[2:37:25] is actually evidence that healing is
[2:37:29] taking place
[2:37:30] when you see this happen on a person's
[2:37:33] hand or on their arm a scar is actually
[2:37:37] a visual or an emotional response from a
[2:37:41] past injury that did not lead to death
[2:37:46] so God allowed you to go through that
[2:37:48] something in your life and I'm I'm
[2:37:51] asking the Holy Spirit to make that real
[2:37:54] to you because he can do that
[2:37:57] because I don't know you but he does
[2:38:00] but a scar that happens to you but it
[2:38:02] didn't lead to your death
[2:38:04] somebody needs to say praise the Lord so
[2:38:07] it's not always a bad thing a scar or
[2:38:10] something that happened to you that it's
[2:38:12] actually evidence that something
[2:38:14] happened in the past but it did not take
[2:38:16] your life
[2:38:19] it could have took you out it there's
[2:38:21] another person that would have went to
[2:38:23] the world there's other people that
[2:38:25] shake their fist toward God
[2:38:29] come on be mature tonight I'm asking are
[2:38:31] young people and children everyone they
[2:38:34] shake their fists toward God say how
[2:38:36] could you do that to me
[2:38:38] well you're gonna understand one day
[2:38:41] that there's wounds that happen to all
[2:38:43] of us
[2:38:46] then they become scars in this picture
[2:38:48] something might have happened
[2:38:52] and it came very very close
[2:38:54] through their face
[2:38:56] that if that would have hit their eyes
[2:38:58] or went a little bit God God rich in
[2:39:02] Mercy
[2:39:03] like I talked about this young lady just
[2:39:06] a few months ago in this horrible
[2:39:08] head-on collision and and just wrecked
[2:39:11] and flown to the hospital and gone
[2:39:13] through actually years of therapy and
[2:39:17] things in her arrow in her and now when
[2:39:20] she gave birth to a child that she has
[2:39:21] to have it cesarean because of her hips
[2:39:24] being in a certain way but years ago
[2:39:26] months ago when I met with her and she
[2:39:28] had black you know
[2:39:30] um fingering and now she's walking
[2:39:33] saintly and living and married and as a
[2:39:36] child and her spiritual life like I said
[2:39:38] has gone up it took something to get
[2:39:40] their attention
[2:39:44] so we all have scars we all have wounds
[2:39:47] but I want you to after tonight's
[2:39:49] service to start looking at that is
[2:39:51] actually it's healing healing has taken
[2:39:55] place
[2:39:56] it's actually something that God allowed
[2:39:58] to happen in your life I'm not saying
[2:40:00] God caused it he allowed it to happen
[2:40:02] but it didn't lead to your death
[2:40:06] stop blaming it all on God when moving
[2:40:08] times it's just life
[2:40:14] it's actually something that could have
[2:40:16] took your life but you made it through
[2:40:19] and you need to stop and instead of
[2:40:22] getting that you know singing that song
[2:40:24] Somebody done somebody wrong song You
[2:40:26] need to start saying thank you Jesus I
[2:40:29] love you Lord I'm going to serve you in
[2:40:31] spite of this I'm gonna come out of this
[2:40:34] I'm coming Lord I'm not going to become
[2:40:36] bitter I'm not going to become hard in
[2:40:38] God I sense myself becoming that way and
[2:40:42] I'm not gonna let that happen oh God
[2:40:45] and it's in your time of wounding
[2:40:47] release is the spirit of God
[2:40:50] and that's called character
[2:40:54] and that's what you're gonna take to
[2:40:56] heaven with you
[2:40:58] is your character
[2:41:00] God's molding you he's shaping your life
[2:41:07] I trust this is okay
[2:41:09] in the next photo you see a bad bad burn
[2:41:12] but you see the results after four
[2:41:14] months of of healing how it can become a
[2:41:18] scar
[2:41:19] and I looked across the parking lot and
[2:41:22] I thought
[2:41:25] if they can have a wound healing Center
[2:41:28] for someone in the world
[2:41:30] that has had an accident or had an
[2:41:32] injury what about people in the message
[2:41:37] we serve a great God we serve a god of
[2:41:40] the Universe I believe he's interested
[2:41:43] I believe he knows the things we've gone
[2:41:46] through
[2:41:47] and sometimes we can go for months and
[2:41:49] years and hear messages and go through
[2:41:51] services and listen to tapes and then
[2:41:54] all of a sudden it's like we have a
[2:41:56] weekend of services or there's a special
[2:41:58] service or a special meeting or
[2:42:00] something happens and it's like God
[2:42:03] begins to reveal himself to us that he
[2:42:05] cares for us
[2:42:07] that he knows where we're at
[2:42:11] I think that's what he's saying tonight
[2:42:14] he's saying I will restore I'm I'm here
[2:42:16] I've got you
[2:42:18] you say but I'm falling but he's saying
[2:42:20] my arms are here to catch you
[2:42:23] say I don't know how this is all going
[2:42:24] to work out it's like me dropping this
[2:42:27] glass and it just shattering everywhere
[2:42:28] well how are we going to put brother
[2:42:30] John I mean let's talk how are we going
[2:42:32] to put this all together well I don't
[2:42:34] know brother
[2:42:36] I don't know sister
[2:42:38] we can all get our gorillas you know
[2:42:41] glue and our super glue and brother
[2:42:43] there's thousands of pieces just go buy
[2:42:45] another one we'd say
[2:42:50] no
[2:42:51] for a Believer for a seed of God he is
[2:42:54] not there is no other
[2:42:55] person you are the person he he allowed
[2:42:58] that but I was dropped I was brother
[2:43:01] John this happened to me
[2:43:04] don't you even care it's like you just
[2:43:07] some light thing and you're not you're
[2:43:09] not even serious about it
[2:43:12] we can get that way sometimes we can we
[2:43:16] can be kind of jokey and laughing when
[2:43:17] really maybe we need to be more serious
[2:43:19] we need to be like our sister was in our
[2:43:23] pictures we need to be desperate
[2:43:26] about our teenagers we need to be
[2:43:28] desperate
[2:43:30] and sometimes it takes a a real jolt or
[2:43:33] something
[2:43:36] to get our attention
[2:43:40] I remember sitting in a coffee shop
[2:43:44] with a young man from Africa
[2:43:47] and now he's in the prime of his life
[2:43:50] been born and raised in the message and
[2:43:53] it went to a youth camp in my he was
[2:43:55] just the star of the Youth Camp they
[2:43:58] loved him the young people that could
[2:43:59] see he was magnetized to him but he also
[2:44:03] had been offered scholarships and he had
[2:44:05] also been offered to play in the NFL
[2:44:10] and now this young man was was coming to
[2:44:12] that time of his life
[2:44:14] and I knew him well I knew his family
[2:44:16] well
[2:44:18] and I could tell we had gone through a
[2:44:19] camp and God had dealt with his life and
[2:44:22] he had a real gift to to work with the
[2:44:24] young people he could have been a real
[2:44:26] blessing
[2:44:27] and I was sitting in the coffee shop
[2:44:30] and I gave him the story of me on an
[2:44:33] airplane and I was flying I think
[2:44:35] through Detroit and I could I was
[2:44:38] sitting in an economy coach and I could
[2:44:41] tell that there was someone in first
[2:44:42] class I recognized the person I didn't
[2:44:45] know who they was but I I recognized
[2:44:47] that I knew them from somewhere
[2:44:50] and sure enough when they got off the
[2:44:52] plane and they went down and they got
[2:44:54] into the terminal everybody was wanting
[2:44:56] their autograph and one in their
[2:44:58] autograph it was turned out to be the
[2:45:00] coach of the Seattle Seahawks
[2:45:02] that's our local football team and I
[2:45:05] recognized him oh that's the coach of
[2:45:08] the Seattle Seahawks that's why he was
[2:45:10] flying through Detroit and people was
[2:45:12] wanting his autograph
[2:45:14] so I brought that up to this young man
[2:45:16] sitting there at the table
[2:45:21] I said hear the Lord used you at these
[2:45:24] meetings and you could see that there's
[2:45:26] he dealt with your life and you are at a
[2:45:28] junction
[2:45:30] and I said now there's there's Great Men
[2:45:32] there was there's universities that are
[2:45:35] flying
[2:45:36] to be with you your parents in your
[2:45:38] house to sign you to be on their team
[2:45:41] they want you
[2:45:43] and it's it's serious
[2:45:45] this is on social media so it's nothing
[2:45:47] anything private
[2:45:49] and they're coming and they're this is
[2:45:51] how the quality he was
[2:45:53] and I said you hear you're at a
[2:45:55] crossroad I said I would like to sign
[2:45:57] you up
[2:45:58] to be in the Lord's army to be on the
[2:46:00] Lord's team
[2:46:02] I said here are these coaches and here's
[2:46:04] these great people they're flying and
[2:46:06] they're now they're asking they they are
[2:46:08] wanting you to play for them
[2:46:10] when I said there's other young men that
[2:46:12] God could really use you with in the
[2:46:14] church or you could be a real blessing
[2:46:17] I said I could I was appealing to the
[2:46:19] spiritual side of this young man to he
[2:46:22] could really be a blessing I said you
[2:46:23] can be in a local team you could be the
[2:46:26] star and a local team you don't have to
[2:46:29] go here and go there in big stadiums my
[2:46:33] stadiums just literally rocking with
[2:46:36] thousands of fans and he played for them
[2:46:40] he went on to play in the stadiums and
[2:46:42] he went on to sign for the NFL team
[2:46:46] until an injury happened and you know
[2:46:48] what friends that's just like the devil
[2:46:50] he'll hang something out in front of you
[2:46:52] and all you need you'll be a superstar
[2:46:55] one day and carted off the field the
[2:46:57] next and like after a while you're just
[2:46:59] forgotten
[2:47:02] Satan will do that he'll do that to our
[2:47:04] young people he'll do that to a brother
[2:47:06] in the church to a sister in the church
[2:47:09] he'll start whispering little lies to
[2:47:11] them and you know the man next door and
[2:47:14] and you know what you could be and hear
[2:47:16] your husband's not respecting you and
[2:47:18] you've got all these children in their
[2:47:20] diapers and all the things you do and
[2:47:22] nobody takes you for who you really are
[2:47:24] and you're taken for granted and a
[2:47:26] sister can start to feel that pull but
[2:47:28] it's not always glorious
[2:47:31] it's not always breaking up homes and
[2:47:34] breaking up relationships the answers
[2:47:36] and I thought God if the world would
[2:47:38] have a wound healing Center surely
[2:47:42] there's a place
[2:47:44] that a Believer that's going through a
[2:47:46] time of wounding can run into and be
[2:47:49] saved
[2:47:53] amen I see that it's 8 34.
[2:47:55] so we're over our time
[2:48:03] what do you think about this tonight
[2:48:07] what do you think about what I'm talking
[2:48:09] about
[2:48:11] we have sisters that are going through
[2:48:13] these things Brothers
[2:48:14] that are going through these things and
[2:48:16] David prayed like this bless the Lord O
[2:48:19] my soul and all that is within me bless
[2:48:21] His holy name bless the Lord O my soul
[2:48:24] and forget not all his benefits let's
[2:48:28] say oh
[2:48:29] all his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[2:48:33] iniquities
[2:48:34] who healeth all thy diseases who
[2:48:37] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[2:48:40] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[2:48:42] Tender Mercies
[2:48:43] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[2:48:46] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[2:48:49] eagles
[2:48:50] Hallelujah Lord that's what I trust
[2:48:53] would happen after tonight is that some
[2:48:55] of you would lift up your wings and just
[2:48:57] flutter them a little bit
[2:49:00] let's start flying a little bit you say
[2:49:02] well I don't think I can do that brother
[2:49:04] John I'm so anxious and nervous I I just
[2:49:07] feel I'm just gonna go right out of here
[2:49:09] and go back home that's where I always
[2:49:11] feel the safest is when I'm all alone no
[2:49:14] you're just all alone with your thoughts
[2:49:16] and the devil is just ratcheting it up
[2:49:18] more and more and more and you're not
[2:49:20] happy and you're not satisfied while
[2:49:22] you're in this presence is when we need
[2:49:24] a release
[2:49:25] can we release ourselves tonight
[2:49:28] for ourselves and for others
[2:49:33] let's not forget his benefits
[2:49:36] and the way she deals and his benefit
[2:49:38] package is just out of this world
[2:49:42] I mean that
[2:49:44] Hallelujah the salary for you is out of
[2:49:47] this world it's it's eternity it's the
[2:49:49] future home it's
[2:49:51] it's literally out of this world
[2:49:55] see I've been I've been persecuted
[2:49:57] brother John I've been rejected I've
[2:50:00] been despised I'm dealing with rejection
[2:50:03] right now
[2:50:07] the Bible talks about that despise not
[2:50:10] the days of Small Beginnings
[2:50:14] Paul told Timothy to let no man despise
[2:50:18] the youth
[2:50:20] how many knows that scripture
[2:50:23] let no man despise thy youth or to Titus
[2:50:27] he said let no man despise you that
[2:50:29] means to look down on you and Scorn and
[2:50:32] bad mouth you
[2:50:35] don't let it now when Paul said that let
[2:50:38] no man despise your youth he what he did
[2:50:40] he was not saying when they despise you
[2:50:43] take up arms and let's all be like
[2:50:45] militant and go take them out you know
[2:50:46] you despise me I'm taking you
[2:50:48] [Music]
[2:50:52] let no man despise you
[2:50:55] he wasn't saying if they do despise you
[2:50:57] take them out destroy him on social
[2:50:59] media no that's not what he meant
[2:51:01] because they will despise you they will
[2:51:04] look down on you they will say you're
[2:51:06] nothing you're oddballs you're weird
[2:51:09] what he was saying to Timothy was don't
[2:51:12] let it affect you
[2:51:16] don't let it move you
[2:51:18] did you get that
[2:51:20] that's what he meant let no man despise
[2:51:22] your youth mean they will despise you
[2:51:24] because you're younger
[2:51:26] you're just a youth you're younger than
[2:51:27] them
[2:51:29] you're a startup
[2:51:33] you know you've had to now go out on a
[2:51:35] limb because something happened in your
[2:51:37] life and now you're going to have to
[2:51:38] make a change
[2:51:40] and you feel despised and you feel like
[2:51:43] rejected like
[2:51:46] I I used to be the one they wanted to
[2:51:48] sing a special I used to be the one they
[2:51:50] wanted to be a teacher I used to be a
[2:51:53] now like I'm so ashamed Brother John
[2:51:57] I'm so embarrassed
[2:52:01] like even to see the other believers I
[2:52:05] and Satan wants to make you feel
[2:52:08] rejected and despised and misunderstood
[2:52:13] and you start feeling reproached
[2:52:16] and you really start feeling little
[2:52:19] but you're not in God's eyes nothing's
[2:52:22] ever changed
[2:52:25] I hope that I hope that helps someone
[2:52:30] I will restore to you the years
[2:52:33] that the cankerworm has eaten
[2:52:35] the canker where the caterpillar and
[2:52:38] Palmer worm I'm just gonna take a few
[2:52:40] more minutes because tomorrow morning
[2:52:42] I'm speaking on another subject so can I
[2:52:44] take a few more minutes
[2:52:45] restoration takes time
[2:52:52] as we said earlier miracles happen in an
[2:52:55] instant
[2:52:57] but healing takes time
[2:53:00] any of you that's ever worked in
[2:53:01] restoration or working on a building or
[2:53:05] something being restored
[2:53:08] know that it takes time
[2:53:11] is that true
[2:53:13] when you talk about things happen like
[2:53:15] disasters and recoveries and restoration
[2:53:18] and protection things disasters happen
[2:53:21] tornadoes damage snow flooding fire
[2:53:24] certain things happen it starts to over
[2:53:26] it takes time to recover
[2:53:29] I'm not here tonight with some magic
[2:53:32] wand and there's no Minister that can
[2:53:35] just wave over you and it's like well
[2:53:37] you know brother John I went to this
[2:53:39] meeting I felt really good and then
[2:53:41] those are things that you have to deal
[2:53:43] with oftentimes for the rest of your
[2:53:44] life
[2:53:47] oh that's not what some of you wanted to
[2:53:49] hear was it
[2:53:55] any of you that knows about restoration
[2:53:57] and knows about these things and even
[2:53:59] before and after photos
[2:54:03] it's not just a matter of a five-minute
[2:54:05] sermon it's not a one-week process
[2:54:09] these things restoration takes time
[2:54:12] here's something in New York that
[2:54:15] um from on the left hand side you can
[2:54:17] see 1948 there's the before and then
[2:54:20] there's the after it takes time for
[2:54:22] restoration if you want the real beauty
[2:54:24] of something to come out then you've got
[2:54:27] to be willing
[2:54:29] hear me out
[2:54:30] to have patience with God
[2:54:33] and you've got to have patience with
[2:54:34] yourself
[2:54:36] and you've got to have patience with
[2:54:38] others
[2:54:39] I know you're a little church but
[2:54:41] sometimes we need to have more patience
[2:54:44] for others
[2:54:46] because there's a work in progress
[2:54:50] and it looks like you're spinning your
[2:54:51] wheels with this fella or the sister
[2:54:53] just looks like she's always sick she's
[2:54:55] always their family's always sick
[2:54:57] there's always 9-1-1 they're always in
[2:55:00] his life
[2:55:03] well there's probably times in your life
[2:55:05] God felt like going up
[2:55:08] and maybe other people like they're
[2:55:11] never going to be safe they're never
[2:55:12] gonna work out they'll never be and then
[2:55:14] then time goes on and those people are
[2:55:16] the ones that turn out to be standing in
[2:55:18] it you all know what I'm talking about
[2:55:20] sometimes all those people I'm sure
[2:55:22] they're the man they're always this and
[2:55:24] their children are disorderly and
[2:55:25] they're always this job and that job and
[2:55:27] this house and then the years go by and
[2:55:30] those are the people still in the church
[2:55:32] then the others that are you know
[2:55:33] they're wealthy and they're educated and
[2:55:35] they're this and they drive around their
[2:55:37] Beamers and there's Teslas and and then
[2:55:39] time goes on and they leave the message
[2:55:42] all right I'm sorry
[2:55:45] and here is that couple or that family
[2:55:47] in the church that was so messed up and
[2:55:50] you're looking at it in 2022 and saying
[2:55:52] that's incredible well that's what God
[2:55:54] that's how God deals
[2:55:57] praise the Lord I mean you're one of
[2:55:59] those
[2:56:02] I was talking to
[2:56:05] and all the salt on the roads and things
[2:56:07] and how cars and Automobiles can get
[2:56:09] kind of weathered after a few years well
[2:56:12] if you're talking about an automobile
[2:56:14] restoration it takes time
[2:56:21] we want drive-through restoration drive
[2:56:25] through you know I'm a mess it's
[2:56:27] horrible yeah five minutes glory to God
[2:56:30] hallelujah you know
[2:56:32] don't we
[2:56:33] I mean we want to be in the Statue of a
[2:56:35] perfect man tomorrow brother honey
[2:56:41] that's my Starbucks McDonald's Tim
[2:56:44] Hortons drive-through man I mean
[2:56:46] we want to get this and let's go man
[2:56:49] and we want that spiritually we want to
[2:56:52] let's let's go you know let's be and
[2:56:54] when it's not like that it's like oh
[2:56:58] ah
[2:57:00] a
[2:57:03] and we want drive through restoration
[2:57:05] and drive through change and we just
[2:57:08] want to Blink
[2:57:09] and Sunday night it's uh there's no
[2:57:11] problems
[2:57:15] but Monday morning comes every week
[2:57:18] and we gotta go right back to dealing
[2:57:19] with the issue
[2:57:21] your bank account
[2:57:24] the relationship
[2:57:26] and we need God to work on the other end
[2:57:28] of the line sometimes can the church say
[2:57:32] Amen we need to start praying like that
[2:57:34] that the Lord would start working on the
[2:57:36] other end
[2:57:37] because Lord you know that I've tried
[2:57:39] you know that what can we do Lord
[2:57:41] and we can come out of a weekend of
[2:57:43] services like this and just feel like
[2:57:44] wow that was wonderful
[2:57:46] something go sideways next week or blow
[2:57:49] up in our face and we wonder like what
[2:57:51] was it even real
[2:57:53] yes it was real God was God Was
[2:57:56] preparing you for that
[2:57:58] are you listening
[2:57:59] so this restoration by God
[2:58:03] oftentimes we look at it like this an
[2:58:06] old house or an old place and in a time
[2:58:09] of restoration and God turns it to that
[2:58:13] we we look at a situation and it can
[2:58:16] turn from this on the inside and then
[2:58:18] when God gets done with it it's totally
[2:58:21] renovated I'm talking about restoration
[2:58:23] and I will restore and some of you
[2:58:26] tonight after tonight I believe the Lord
[2:58:28] is speaking to you that it's time for
[2:58:30] you to come into a season of recovery
[2:58:32] and restoration and stop talking about
[2:58:35] all the years
[2:58:37] just stop talking about all the things
[2:58:39] that's happened to you bad
[2:58:41] and all the things that were said and
[2:58:43] you're reliving it over and over and
[2:58:45] over and you're killing yourself
[2:58:48] and it took a little Minister from back
[2:58:50] West to come here back east and maybe
[2:58:52] shake you up a little bit and say you
[2:58:54] need to put a period there and say I'm
[2:58:56] going on to Restoration I'm going on to
[2:58:59] recovery I'm coming out of this I'm not
[2:59:03] gonna be a mournful dead Christian
[2:59:07] if everything goes south
[2:59:10] if everybody else leaves I'm gonna be a
[2:59:12] believer I Love You Lord and friends you
[2:59:15] start having an attitude like that comes
[2:59:17] from the word things begin to change
[2:59:20] it becomes creative and I'm ending right
[2:59:22] now I'm ending the service it's just
[2:59:24] like here we are at evening Light
[2:59:26] Fellowship we are the Sheep of his
[2:59:28] pastor
[2:59:29] and sheep are dumb
[2:59:32] hello well before we're finishing strong
[2:59:35] aren't we
[2:59:37] I'm really yeah we are Venice and strong
[2:59:40] sheep are dumb
[2:59:41] and they need a shepherd
[2:59:43] and they don't know how to find their
[2:59:45] way
[2:59:47] I'm dumb
[2:59:49] and I need a shepherd and I don't know
[2:59:51] the way but I have Jesus
[2:59:54] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[2:59:58] so you take the scriptures that all of
[3:00:00] you know and you have it in your hallway
[3:00:01] and on the refrigerator but do you have
[3:00:03] it in your heart
[3:00:05] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not

[3:00:26] I want the Lord Jesus to put his
[3:00:30] come into the room now
[3:00:33] here you've been laying here this whole
[3:00:35] last few minutes
[3:00:38] and the great physician has been
[3:00:40] touching your life
[3:00:42] supernaturally just guiding and moving
[3:00:46] guiding the hands of the physician
[3:00:50] for years
[3:00:52] the Lord might have molded brother John
[3:00:54] to say some of the things I did tonight
[3:00:57] and you don't need to know
[3:00:59] what we've gone through you don't need
[3:01:01] to know our pain or our wounds or our
[3:01:04] scars
[3:01:06] but maybe the Lord would do all of that
[3:01:08] for brother Lush
[3:01:10] all these years and and your little
[3:01:13] church has has actually spawned hundreds
[3:01:16] of churches in Africa
[3:01:18] and from the website and people have
[3:01:20] known the message and you've supported
[3:01:22] in other churches and other believers
[3:01:24] have been made strong and many of them
[3:01:26] I've been to Africa I've been to and
[3:01:28] their churches are larger than your
[3:01:30] church
[3:01:32] their restrooms are some of them more
[3:01:35] than you have
[3:01:37] they're Pastor studies
[3:01:39] are four times as big as your pastor
[3:01:41] study
[3:01:44] and here the last weekend of services I
[3:01:47] think that you're of special meetings in
[3:01:49] this little building
[3:01:51] and it seems like God is about ready to
[3:01:53] bless your life
[3:01:55] to Crown your ministry and say I'm I'm
[3:01:58] going to give you a building that's 10
[3:02:00] times what you have now is that what it
[3:02:02] is I'm gonna give you a sanctuary where
[3:02:05] you might have to put up walls or
[3:02:06] something I don't know it's huge
[3:02:12] and you have a fellowship hall and you
[3:02:14] have offices and you have thing and you
[3:02:16] have a parking lot
[3:02:18] a parking lot
[3:02:21] what's a parking lot that's where you
[3:02:23] park cars you know and there's enough
[3:02:25] parking really yeah we're it's gonna be
[3:02:28] huge well I just feel like it's the Lord
[3:02:31] blessing your life
[3:02:33] forgive me I'm an outsider but I feel
[3:02:35] like you've been Faithful over the years
[3:02:37] and God's given you above and beyond
[3:02:40] he's not just giving you a double
[3:02:42] blessing he's like giving you a
[3:02:43] quadruple blessing
[3:02:46] and I think some of you need to change
[3:02:48] your attitude
[3:02:50] and learn to accept the crowning time of
[3:02:53] your life
[3:02:55] and you're saying you're so humble oh no

[3:08:50] three years a thousand days it's almost
[3:08:53] three years David was saying I'd rather

[3:09:01] hear songs like we sang
[3:09:03] like we heard tonight sister Delphine
[3:09:05] and others and our young ladies and
[3:09:08] sisters I'd rather be in one service

[3:09:12] Taylor Swift concert
[3:09:17] you might as well bring it down home I
[3:09:18] mean if they can shut down a
[3:09:20] Ticketmaster website because there's
[3:09:22] Millions flooding in there to get
[3:09:24] tickets
[3:09:26] see some lipstick some prostitute get
[3:09:29] out there and gyrate to the to the moves
[3:09:31] of souls in prison now that's right
[3:09:34] that's right
[3:09:34] [Music]
[3:09:35] he said when he went down there he heard
[3:09:38] that and it was the sound like he had
[3:09:40] heard in the prison
[3:09:43] [Music]
[3:09:44] and you run back backwards AC DC music
[3:09:47] and that's exactly what it sounds like
[3:09:49] oh
[3:09:51] it's the background music
[3:09:54] and and I don't want to go into that
[3:09:57] but but they're making mockery
[3:09:59] of hell
[3:10:01] and the background's going
[3:10:03] that's exactly what our Prophet said in
[3:10:06] souls in prison
[3:10:08] it wasn't hell
[3:10:09] and they were going on about the prices
[3:10:11] and so forth
[3:10:13] God help us not to get in the language
[3:10:15] of the world
[3:10:16] it's the background music to a
[3:10:18] tribulation
[3:10:20] it's the background music to hell
[3:10:23] and forgive me for going like that amen
[3:10:26] I had something in my hand amen God help
[3:10:28] us to be real with one another
[3:10:31] heavenly father I thank you Lord for
[3:10:33] this group of Believers Lord
[3:10:35] I thank you for being our healer
[3:10:38] thank you for being the one that can
[3:10:40] bear our burdens Lord
[3:10:41] that we can hear messages I will restore
[3:10:45] saith the Lord
[3:10:46] and to know that you personalize it for
[3:10:48] every situation
[3:10:50] Lord we lift up our lives tonight to you
[3:10:54] I pray for every single person that may
[3:10:56] be wounded
[3:10:59] every single person this message might
[3:11:01] affected Lord and if this if the
[3:11:03] pictures of the scars and wounds
[3:11:06] hurt someone I pray that you'd Forgive
[3:11:08] Me Lord
[3:11:09] but we did it to drive point of home
[3:11:11] drive home a point
[3:11:13] and maybe our young children or young
[3:11:15] people as they get older they'll find
[3:11:17] out they'll be scarred by bullies
[3:11:20] they'll be scarred by a boss they'll be
[3:11:22] scarred by something the secretaries are
[3:11:25] talking about or by the way they dress
[3:11:27] they want us bring it they want to bring
[3:11:29] us down to their fleshly carnal level
[3:11:31] but I pray tonight there would be a
[3:11:33] voice that would be streamed out over
[3:11:35] the bow of our little ship
[3:11:38] I will restore saith the Lord
[3:11:42] and it's the voice of God it's the saith
[3:11:45] the Lord the Lord is picking us up the
[3:11:48] Lord is bearing our burdens The Lord Is
[3:11:51] Our Shepherd the Lord is our great
[3:11:52] physician
[3:11:54] the Lord is the one that is reaching for
[3:11:56] our file that he knows all the past and
[3:11:59] all the fine print and all the details
[3:12:01] of what's been said and what's been done
[3:12:03] and tonight I'm asking you to put that
[3:12:05] under the blood for every single person
[3:12:08] here Lord give them the power to receive
[3:12:11] the word
[3:12:13] give us the power Lord of that
[3:12:15] Revelation to apply it in our own lives
[3:12:18] to apply the token is literally it's not
[3:12:21] to talk about it it's not to talk about
[3:12:23] the message but it's to get underneath
[3:12:25] it it's to apply it it's to get under
[3:12:28] that token and get into the house
[3:12:31] and eat all the word and eat all the
[3:12:33] pertinent Parts even the parts that we
[3:12:35] don't want to talk about even the parts
[3:12:37] that hurt us even the parts that we
[3:12:40] don't want to become public even the
[3:12:42] things we wouldn't want to say to
[3:12:43] someone
[3:12:44] but we've got to eat all of it the
[3:12:47] pertinent Parts the inside parts we got
[3:12:49] to hear it Lord Jesus
[3:12:51] for in doing so we will save ourselves
[3:12:55] and those that are with us Lord
[3:12:57] help us as ministers help us as church

[3:13:02] brothers help our young people help our
[3:13:05] children help our elderly help our ones
[3:13:07] that have struggled in their marriage as
[3:13:09] God and maybe tonight they're on the
[3:13:11] Rocks maybe it's falling apart maybe
[3:13:14] it's someone that's even grasping for a
[3:13:16] little bit of Hope a little bit of a
[3:13:18] word a little bit of something and here
[3:13:21] the Lord has given us handfuls on
[3:13:23] purpose he's given us a boatload he's
[3:13:25] giving us a double portion he's giving
[3:13:28] us a portion times ten
[3:13:31] amen that sometimes we don't even
[3:13:33] realize how blessed we are
[3:13:36] oh Jesus forgive us if we have whined
[3:13:39] and complained or saw something with a
[3:13:42] bad attitude
[3:13:44] we've looked at it wrong we've been
[3:13:45] looking at it wrong for so long
[3:13:48] it's kind of caused us to be worked a
[3:13:50] little bit it's caused us to kind of
[3:13:51] Bend

[3:13:54] because the wind was blowing so hard we
[3:13:56] had to stand up against it we started to
[3:13:59] bend over
