powerfully to speak lord to draw your bride just that much closer to you heavenly father lord clothe us with your word we pray have your way in your people we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians if you turn the scriptures to genesis chapter 3. genesis chapter 3 amen welcome each one here this morning appreciate the deacons doing the work to get us through the vaccine check-ins and all these different things and uh it's good to see each one that's here this morning and then i had a lot of feedback on the last service certainly appreciate it i had it from young and old men and women alike amen and uh i appreciate it when people come and talk to me and and whether it's good or bad or whether they're unsure or sure and then certainly like to have people talk to me about it and let me know what's going on amen the thing is this this is a house of correction now we look at correction in such a negative light but the first line of correction is always instruction and men and we're not responsible for something until we hear it but once we hear it now we're responsible for it so when we take a service like that it is not given as a correction in order to to spank somebody or to single anybody out but rather it's to show us what the word says and then we can come in line with it amen we're not responsible for what we don't know but once we hear it then god holds us responsible for him and we've got a lot of young people in this church by god's grace and they need to hear these things our young men need to hear it our young women need to hear it amen and the olders too the olders all had lots of feedback and and talking about the ways it impacted them amen we did we never stopped growing we never stopped learning we never stopped changing amen into the glory of christ so these services are are direct in many ways and if you can just take it as the word says it and if you feel i'm off a little bit then grant me a bit of grace amen and hopefully the lord can speak through it amen genesis 3 verse 17 says and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curse it is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt that eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the ground in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return amen god is blessing to the word you may have your seats this morning and then we're continuing on our series on that kingdom come and i want to continue to focus on the men today and i want to take a title of christ-like provision amen christ-like provision remember the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of god is within us i mean this is not something that we're looking to to experience on this earth in this timeline that we're here in this age amen we're peculiar people on this earth and that's because we have a power within us that makes us live differently than people that allows us to not be influenced by the world we're not here to take power we're not going to rule and reign as we will in the millennium amen this is a time for us to be shaped to have our character molded for us to be tried for us to be proven and is for us to overcome our flesh and overcome what satan throws at us in this time amen john said this he says i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i think that's a beautiful scripture we we spoke to the young men in the last service and john says i'm speaking to you young men because you have overcome that's not just because they did then that's a prophetic voice speaking to the future generations saying you have overcome amen it's a finished work for you and though we struggle and we strive and we have difficulties and we fail and these different things yet john's saying you have overcome him and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen you have a you have a call in your life to be an overcomer and you have overcome in god's eyes and we're just going through time here to prove it he says i write unto you little children because you have known the father i have written unto you fathers because because you have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men again because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one amen that's a promise i want to take in my life amen that's the promise each one of us should have is that what the word of god abideth in us and we have overcome the wicked one amen again this is a prophecy not just a declaration for that day love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen amen so when we talk about the kingdom of god coming the kingdom of god coming in power even it is not just looking ahead to the day when christ comes back with his saints and clouds of glory and we come back for a millennial reign but we're talking about what the kingdom of god being displayed in our lives today with overcoming power so that satan has no influence on us while we are here the power of god the holy spirit that has sealed our soul is so powerful that satan is is completely bound in our lives amen that's what we're looking for that's the completion of our faith is when satan has no influence on us amen when god is so completely in control on us that we can influence the world at best but they cannot influence us amen that the word has put up a barrier and satan can't pass through that barrier in our lives amen but we know it's a battle every day it's a battle to express it's not just cruising through life but it's a struggle because satan's trying to punch us and hit us every day of our lives to try and get us off of the word amen so with that in mind we want to dive into a bit of a deeper look at this great attribute that god has assigned to the men and it's a critical attribute it's perhaps the greatest attribute and it is that of the provider and then i said in the last service how god has taken the man and he's taken the woman and he's given them different roles and different responsibilities and when we talked about the man we said the key the the key principle here is that he acts as christ as in his love towards his wife his love towards his family is christ-like which means it is first and foremost sacrificial and second it is provisional it means that he may he what he puts himself at at their he sacrifices himself for their good and in that he makes a way for them to have what they have need of amen amen so the man is always to act christ-like to the woman if christ wouldn't do it to us we shouldn't do it to the people that are under our authority amen and we talked about how he still doesn't replace god he acts like god right he has been placed in the position of headship but he acts as god but he doesn't replace god amen we said a man cannot heal you a man cannot redeem you a man cannot save you a man cannot deliver you in and of himself but it is only through god using him that he can have even any influence in those things and it's still god that does it amen amen so i want to talk about first before we get into men as a provider we want to look to the great provider amen and that is jehovah jireh amen that jehovah jireh means the lord who sees and we say that that's a beautiful thing but it's not just the lord who sees it is the lord who will see to it amen so he will see the need and he will make a way for that need to be met amen he is not just forward-looking he doesn't just have foresight he doesn't just have understanding but he has a will and he has a way to meet the need that he sees coming up amen and he doesn't see it when it happens he sees it before it happens and he makes a provision for that need before we ever ask him for it amen amen what is it we know that god sees everything in our life and he's bringing all things together for our good and he has made a way he has made a provision to meet every need that we have and we want to take this into the scriptures and there's perhaps dozens maybe hundreds of scriptures that talk about god our provider i've just picked a few here but i want to take it all the way back to genesis because we see jehovah jireh in action as soon as man sins that's the first time he comes in in a new way and he shows himself to be jehovah gyra so if we look at genesis 3 7 it says and this is right after adam and eve adam and the woman sinned and it says and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons this is man's first attempt at provision as soon as he sins he tries to step into a place of provision what does he do he makes something that is ineffective and temporary amen that is his way of doing it he knows that something has to be done he knows that there's a need there and he does the best that he can with what he has but we know it wasn't enough right we know it wasn't enough that adam and eve did what they could but it wasn't enough and when they had when they saw that something had to be done they took it on themselves to make it happen and then that's the human condition is we see the need and we say i've got to take care of the need but it's rarely effective because why we're we're in a fallen condition now and we can't have a supernatural effect in a fallen condition amen the first action after sin was to try and handle the situation our own way and it didn't work did it but after god pronounces judgment on the man and the woman he doesn't just send them away empty-handed right he doesn't just say all right you sinned get out of my sight you have nothing i'm not going to deal with you anymore you're on your own you live you live you die you die it doesn't matter but no we see jehovah jairus step in here in genesis 3 21 and he says unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them now they originally made aprons of leaves now i don't know about you but as far as i know leaves don't last very long right very ineffective to what was going to be a life of toil and sweat and struggle and striving leaves aren't going to last long they're going to curl up they're going to die they're going to get brittle and then it's not going to give them the covering that they need for the work that's ahead of them but god comes down and he's supernaturally he divinely provides a covering for them that will give them some longevity but this isn't just a practical solution amen they needed a covering for their sin and the thing is they didn't know they needed it they didn't know they needed it that's why they tried to do leaves they were trying to cover their nakedness but it wasn't their nakedness that was the problem it was the sin that opened their eyes to that negative to that nakedness that had to be addressed so they had need to have a covering for their sin not just their nakedness it was their understanding that said they were naked but it was sin that kept them out of the presence of god moving forward so they had to have a covering for their sin amen they needed there needed to be a death that day and god said something has to die because they were supposed to be death that day says the day you eat thereof is the day you die something's got to die that day and what did god do he went and he took a lamb he took an innocent animal and he killed it and said that death will be yours for today and in that it will cover your sin and now you can actually approach me now you won't die as soon as you step into my presence the next time the next time that you talk to me i can't i won't judge you because i've judged you through the innocent life that's covering you right now amen what was it he saw the problem and he provided the need so that they could go out and live until he could come and redeem them back a final time amen brother braham says this he says now notice when adam his fig leaves were all right as long as he didn't have to face god but when he had to face god he realized his fig leaves was no good and now friend you might think you're a pretty good person see and you might be that's right but when you come to face god if you haven't accepted god's provided sacrifice for you you're lost and you'll know it amen you'll hear stories of people that are on their deathbed and they may have been professing christians all their life and they get to their death bed and what happens they start panicking because they realize that i don't have what i'm supposed to have i don't have a peace i don't have a rest i don't have a closeness to god and so they start to freak out because they realize that they're missing something and they're about to face god and they can't face him in that condition and so they start trying to do whatever it is that takes them and gives them peace but says in another way he says now we know the word religion means a covering and adam instead of saying god cover me catch that adam should have went and said i'm naked lord can you cover me he says no no no he didn't say that he made himself some aprons out of fig leaves he and eve and they worked all right as long as god wasn't around but when they come in the presence of god they realize that their fig leaf religion wouldn't work and brother there's so much of that today too i'm afraid that you're going to find the same thing when god comes again that homemade fig leaf religion won't stand in the presence of god god had to make a covering for them amen god has a provided way and we've got to come by that way brother brahm says in that message god has a provided way he says there's only one way provided and if you don't come by it will never work there's only one way that god's done it amen so when we try and do it our way rather than god's way what is it he says it's a fig leaf religion and it won't survive it won't stand in the day that we stand before god and what we don't remember and what we don't realize sometimes is that when we do it god's way we're not just doing it his way and it's obedience and therefore it's good but that it gives us protection it gives us access it gives us rest it gives us strength it gives us a place to to what claim the word for our lives because we're in obedience we don't realize until we're out of it that there was something in it that we missed that we didn't realize was in our lives all along because we are in accordance with the word amen amen so god was the great provider here in eden even as he's kicking them out of eden even as he's putting them away from eternal life yet he is the great provider because he's made a way for them to still approach him moving forward amen but we see the first time that the word jehovah jireh has ever used is when abraham is about to sacrifice isaac and he's got the knife up here and he comes to stab isaac he god tells him to kill his son as a test and the knife's about to go down he puts his weight into it and what happens is the angel stays his hand and says stop and then what what happens is and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen that's where we first see this redemptive name of god as jehovah jireh the god who sees and what the god who will see to it amen god was jehovah jireh first in the beginning what did he do he provided a lamb to cover them and then we see him come around with abraham and he provides what a ram again a male substitute a male clean lamb it was a type of christ that was there again in foreshadowing what he was going to do at calvary amen god's perfect isn't it he started it in the first way and then he comes to abraham and he confirms it and then he comes as christ in the end and he does it in in his own body and a body prepare for him and he gives his life is that perfect sacrifice for us amen that jehovah jireh is a redemptive blessing amen to us is that he provides the need he sees it and he provides the need amen and he's constant god is constant in this in this attribute he's constant in his provision he's constant in his understanding in his scene our needs and he is constant in providing the needs that we have amen i find it interesting i was listening to um greater than solomon is here um and brother branham said you know we've got we talk about the god of abraham and isaac and jacob he says it's no good if it's just for abraham isaac and jacob amen we need to have a god of jonathan corlett we need to have a god of ellie colombo amen we need to have a god of sandy curlette we need to be able to say that he is not just a god of the past but he is a god of my needs here's jehovah jireh to me he is the god that sees my need he sees my family he sees my situation and he's going to see to it that the need is met amen amen so when we stop start talking about providing or working to live and survive even to prosper in this world we do not look to ourselves for that as men we cannot look to ourselves to even be the one that does that but rather whatever role we find ourselves we do not look to ourselves as the ultimate provider but we look to jehovah jireh as the great provider amen so what it must always be god that we're relying on not on the arms of flesh not on the intellect not on our education not on our experience but we look to god and we say god you are the one that has made the promise you are the one that has said that you will meet all of my needs and on that basis i'm keeping myself under your headship under your word and in that now i can hold on to the promise that you're going to be the great provider for my family and for my situation amen amen i want to read a number of scriptures here that talk to us about the provision of god as an encouragement amen because when we get into situations we need to remember who is our great provider who we are looking to amen if you're a wife if you're a daughter whatever it might be and you say you know it's not working dad doesn't have this ability dad's not able to provide my husband's not able to provide are you looking to your husband or your father are you looking to the great father the great provider amen so paul says this he says in philippians 4 19 but my god shall supply all your need we could stop right here and why would i ever read another scripture because that is all-encompassing but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by whom by christ jesus so let me put it this way but my god shall supply all your need by christ jesus who is christ jesus he is our bridegroom and he is our husband amen what is he doing he's saying you have a great provider that is a relation to you and he is the one that provides all of your needs amen [Music] psalms 23 1. david says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want that means i shall not lack anything i need and i will not diminish under his provision that the working and provision of god will not decrease me but it will grow me it will strengthen me it will bring forth fruit it has a positive effect always now he'll trim us down won't he but god will be what manifested in his provision for us and through us amen david says in psalm 37 he says the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down i thought he was good why is he falling right why is he falling if he's good because he's in human flesh amen we all make mistakes let us take comfort that when we make mistakes that he will what the lord upholdeth him with his hand and then what's he going to do he's going to lift him up out of where he fell he's going to set him on the right path and he's going to keep him moving forward david said i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed paul says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee david says in psalm 16 the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot amen what that means is lord you hold on to what is for me and you keep it safe and you give it to me as i have need of psalms 84 says for the lord god is a son and a shield what is the sun required for growth what is the shield required for protection the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee peter says this grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things all things that pertain unto what just the spiritual he says all things that pertain unto life that's this life and godliness amen we have a provision for our carnal needs here for the body that we're in for the attributes that need to be corrected and changed for the things that need to be grown in our life he says i made a provision for all the godliness part but listen you're still living on this earth and i have made a provision for your life as well amen god sees what we are he is not somebody that can't be touched by our infirmities amen he knows what it's like to be human and he says i've made a provision for life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen when i read all those all i say is where's my portion in this there there's nothing here that i can add to this when he's provided all of my needs then what is my portion my portion is to take it and only step into the role and expect him to keep feeding it through me amen that as he gives it to me i can give it to those that rely on me and as he gives it to you that you can give it to those that rely on you and if you're under somebody that's providing it that you can have trust that you'll receive what you have need of amen every need supplied as the song said amen amen amen so our reliance is in god now the curse on adam was that what you've got to work the ground and it's going to fight you so we have a curse that's working against us to keep us from doing what we're supposed to do so it's always going to be a struggle and if we don't look to the promise we're going to get down sometimes when it's not going so great amen but it is a curse that we're fighting against and the only time that curse is lifted is when we get off of this earth amen just because you have the holy ghost doesn't lift the curse off you that you're gonna have to work men you're gonna have to strive you're gonna have to struggle you're gonna have to toil you're gonna have to sweat you're gonna have to strain you're gonna have to to what kill yourself over time working to provide for your family and for the household of faith even as we get into that amen amen so the christ-like provider has to realize what what makes this provision possible is god not his own strength amen amen amen glory now there's a very simple process to be under god's provision and that is one thing stay with the word amen we've seen it from genesis to revelation stay with the word and god's provision is guaranteed now he didn't say we'd have all of our wants he didn't say we'd have all the clothes we want the greatest cars the biggest houses the best vacations amen he didn't promise us that but he says i'll meet your needs amen you know remember what david said i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread didn't say we'd have steak every night right fried chicken whatever it might be the thing that you like most but he says he'd never be begging bread and then he'd always make a way provided for us listen to what jesus said okay we've talked from peter's standpoint from paul's standpoint david's standpoint let's take it back to jesus own words on earth where he says why take ye thought for raiment for clothes consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith amen notice when you doubt it god says why are you doubting where's your faith listen i've got the whole earth covered i've got a provision for them you're much more important to me than them so why are you doubting that i can't take care of you he says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or shall we drink or where with all shall we be clothed for these for after all these things to the gentile seek now catch that because this is a gentile problem we're gentiles so this is a gentile problem he says it's a worldly problem a worldly influence jesus is talking to who the elect the members of the kingdom of heaven and saying you are not like the gentiles you're not supposed to be going around wondering who's going to provide for you tomorrow don't get caught up in this this is a heathen thing right don't get caught up into how am i going to make ends meet tomorrow or this day or that way now he's not saying don't plan but he's saying don't worry about it right don't get caught up on it don't let it keep you up at night because why your father in heaven is the one that does it it's something the rest of the world has to worry about but you're my children you don't have to worry about this i've said i'll take care of it he says for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things what things clothes food a roof over your head he says look god knows that you've got to have these things he's not just interested in growing you spiritually but he knows you've got needs on this earth and he's there to provide them sometimes we diminish god and say he's only about spiritual growth but in that spiritual growth he has made a way for us to be provided for our natural needs amen and so when we get into natural needs we can say we have a provider the question is is he meeting our spiritual needs as well because if he's not meeting our spiritual needs he usually backs away from the natural needs as well amen he says take therefore no thought for the moral for the moral sorry seek ye first verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god what's the what's the kingdom of god it's the holy spirit in you bringing forth christ the word so seek forth or seek first but the holy spirit making you live a christ-like life and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you all of these things things for life and things for godliness for the carnal needs and for the spiritual needs what all these things will be added unto you take therefore no thought for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof amen we've read multiple times when they did it when we did our series on the overcomers about how they were told to stay with the word meditate on it keep it in front of you keep it in front of you lot walk it talk it live it all these different things and when you do with it when you stay with that whole word of god then he gave them every promise that they have need of to have a land and meant to have a kingdom to have a place with their where they could raise their families the problem is is when things are going great then what happens to our zeal it tends to die off doesn't it when we're not fighting when we're not struggling when we're not growing then our zeal for god drops off why because we we're not thinking about him because we have everything we need amen but we've got to be seeking first the kingdom of god and saying lord what more do i need what more do i need to change lord what do you have to add and what do i have to take away to get you to do it and we open up our lives to him deuteronomy 8 says this and this is a warning to the children of israel beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command thee this day lest when thou has eaten and are full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy herds and their flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied in other words when the promise of god comes to pass look out amen he says then thine heart be lifted up and now forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought and where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do the good at thy ladder in all that difficulty he says was to do you good at the end amen but watch this this is the warning sorry my voice has been going and thou shalt say in thine heart my power and the might of mine hand has gotten me this wealth why because we've sweated and we've toiled and we've gone through the struggle and we've gone through the trial and what is it i deserve it i've done all the work therefore it makes sense that i have reaped a great reward he says no no no no no no this is me that did that but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth the power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he swear unto thy fathers as it is this day amen amen so when things get tough when things get tough financially when things get tough with our careers when things get tough where we see that there's more month at the end of the paycheck than there is paycheck at the end of the month what do we have to do check up and say lord have i gotten slack lord are you just are you just bumping me a little bit to say hey buddy we haven't been talking so good anymore right you've been just cruising on your own lord is there something that i need to need to tighten up here lord do i need to get a little closer to my bridegroom amen and sometimes that's what he's doing but if we check up and we say lord my heart's open show me where i'm slacking show me if i'm off and we get nothing back and we give him time to answer mind you if we get nothing back then what can we say we can say that he is still working it for what to do the good at thy latter end because he brought them through scorpions he brought them through times without water he brought them through times without food he brought them through trials and tribulations to bring them to a place where they could trust god and then so sometimes we need to have an experience so that we will trust so that we can say that we have faith so we can say we know that god is a god of provision but he's got to have something taken away before he can be a god of provision sometimes and sometimes what he's just trying to do is show you the magnificence of god to show you that there is no problem too big for him there's no situation he can't resolve there's nothing that he can't do to meet your need and sometimes the problem is he's just got to give you a need before he can meet it sometimes we've got to realize the need before he can meet it right so the man's role here that moses is pointing them to the man's role is to keep the family in a position to be blessed by god by resting and staying with the word of god the man's role as the provider the provider role comes by sticking with the word of god first and foremost it is not in working your tail off it is not as wearing your fingers to the bone it is not in coming home tired every day it is in keeping the family under the headship of the word so that god can bless and provide for the family amen that is the jehovah jireh attribute in a man is to give it to jehovah jireh himself and keep himself in subjection and under that authority amen so when god delegated authority to adam he put him in the role of working outside the home i don't think that's debatable at this point amen that he said the ground is what you're going to work he didn't tell a woman she was going to work the ground doesn't mean she can't or she won't but he told the man this is your main role this is your primary role is to get out there and work and sweat and toil amen and then as a you know we take that because god we said before wasn't just looking to have people he was looking to have a family right and so he's putting the man in the role that he was and so now we see that there's a drop down again of the woman into the role of the bride to do something with what he gives her right she magnifies what is brought to her she glorifies what is brought to her and she makes it better than what was brought in and then my wife and i were talking about this and she said somebody said i bring in the pig and she turns it into bacon and eggs right that's way better than the pig that you brought in wasn't it right she takes in she she magnifies it you look at proverbs 31 she brings in something and she turns it into something more valuable she takes in the work that he's brought and she turns into something that was better than what he gave her that she she blends it together and makes it into something amen and then he's bringing the food and she's bringing forth life that's what we see in the woman is the man's bringing forth a provision and she's bringing forth life and that's a that's an amazing thing to be able to say amen now much of what we're about to say is geared toward married couples okay so just because you're not married though doesn't mean you don't need to listen because you may be married someday amen as a young man you may be a husband and as a wife as a young young girl you may be a wife and mother so you can look ahead and say this may apply to me someday so listen up and then we've got of course lots of married couples in here young and old and so we want to just listen to this a little bit and see what god has to say about this amen i'm going to take us to a scriptural frame of reference for this because we we see where god told adam that he was the one that was going to work and sweat and these different things but i want to take it beyond adam and i want to take it back to christ because if that is the perfect example and what we're what we're setting a a setting for here today is the perfect example and i'll say this and that's that we aren't a perfect example our relationships our marriages aren't perfect we're living in an imperfect world with imperfect spouses at least a couple of us have imperfect spouses right and so we know that things can there it's not that there are exceptions it's that we're living in the real world and sometimes things have to be done that aren't according to the perfect example but i want to show us the perfect example because that's what we strive for amen we want to be as christ is we want to do as christ does as much as we possibly can in this world amen and if we can take it back to the scriptures then it's not my opinion amen it's not even god's opinion god doesn't have an opinion did you know that god doesn't have an opinion god has truth and that's all it is and if it's not what he says then it's wrong and then so if god says it then we stick with that and we say it's truth it's not an opinion okay so i'm going to take it back to the scriptures here and this is a bit different approach perhaps but stay with me if you would isaiah 9 6 we're talking about christ now for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace isaiah 22 22 says and the key of the house of david shall i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open amen take it all the way to revelation 3 verse 7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that had the key of david that he openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth now we're talking about man being the in the role of the primary provider the primary worker for the home this doesn't look like those type of scriptures does it but let us take it back and i'm going to read a quote here i could explain it myself but i figure if i say it the way brother branham said it then we're on a very sure foundation as he explains these scriptures amen and this is in the church age book he says he that had the key of david he's referring to revelation 3 7. he says this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true remember we said god doesn't have opinions he is truth christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization we're painting a perfect picture here now here it is moses was a prophet of god but jesus like unto moses was the prophet of god david a man after god's own heart was king of israel but jesus is the greater david king of kings and lord of lords god very god amen now david was born of the tribe of judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the show bred reserved for priests he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he said on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of christ now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of david shall i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at this time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the land lampstands what's that in the midst of the gentile church amen it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but jesus himself he says isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it read isaiah 9 6 the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean he says the answer is this the phrase the government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head right that's great brother jonathan but listen to this but also that he bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility to do what provide and care for her amen and that beloved is the key of david and god being sovereign he foreknew by divine degree decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of his church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight so what is it the responsibility of the bride is on the shoulder of the bridegroom she takes her veil she unveils herself before him and passes it over to him and says now it is your care to provide for me it is your responsibility alone she doesn't put that veil on anyone's shoulders and she doesn't leave the veil on her own shoulder she takes her responsibility off of herself and gives it to that man and says now it's your responsibility and it says what that he accepts it he accepts the obligation amen this is the perfect picture of christ and the bride this is the perfect example for a marriage this is perfect example of the union of a man and a woman and as men as paul tells us we are supposed to love our wives as christ did so we are supposed to accept the obligation for the care and responsibility of our family of our wives amen but that's the perfect example is anybody here perfect we're not in our flesh if you didn't know we're not we're not in our flesh we're not perfect and then so we've got to be able to do what be able to reconcile this with the fact that we are imperfect amen that we can't always do what we need to do that we're living in sinful bodies that we're living in a sinful earth and so there are things that can change what this looks like in our lives amen amen but let's see what paul says to our friend timothy again about what this means for the man today he says but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he had denied the faith and is worse than an infidel the amplified says if anyone fails to provide for his relatives and especially for those of his own family he has disowned the faith now catch this by accompanying his faith with fruits and is worse than an unbeliever who performs his obligation in these matters and then so paul takes a man's responsibility and his ability to provide for his household and it's not just for his household and his immediate family but it is for his relations and for the household of faith as we'll see later it said he he ties that into the man's spiritual walk he says this is a reflection of a man's faith is how well he provides for his family he says what the in the amplified there it says by what his faith isn't accompanied with fruits if he's not if he's not providing for his family he ties that into what the fruits of the holy spirit in a man's life is his provision for his family now that's a pretty serious thing isn't it that's a pretty serious thing to say well i know all the revelation in the word i can i can get up i can preach i can talk i can exhort i can testify but paul says but can you take care of your own family right why because you're in that role that was your that was your god-given role was to provide for your family so if you're doing everything else but you're not doing what god placed you on earth to do then there's a problem and then you've got a lot of head knowledge you've got a lot of understanding but the application is lacking in your life so the provision of a man for his family is a fruit of his faith and and paul ties us directly to a spiritual walk amen but catch now that this is a refusal of the man it's a refusal of a man to do it it's not if a man literally can't do it hey man if you got both your legs lopped off in the war then you're going to struggle to sew and and toil in the fields aren't you if you've got a physical disability you're there's going to be a real struggle there and you may not be able to make ends meet that's why i say there's grace for us because we're in an imperfect world with imperfect bodies in a sinful fallen condition amen but what it's speaking of a man that is fully capable of doing it that refuses to do it amen that refuses to sweat and toil to the point that he provides for his family but instead backs away and either doesn't provide for them or lets it fall on somebody's else's shoulders to provide for his family amen so when we look at this scripture where do we see the woman we don't see her sitting there providing for her house there's no he there's no she there's no her here it is all he his all he and his right because why the primary role of the man is to be the provider right not that the woman doesn't work heaven knows the women work amen but the primary role the primary provider in the family is to be the man and that's why paul addresses the men specifically amen why the woman is not responsible to provide for herself are we responsible to provide for ourselves in relation to christ no he is a great provider for us so imperfect type the woman is not to provide for herself the husband is to provide for her amen her veil is on the husband's shoulder and he accepts that now again bear with me don't get tight i'm not saying that women can't work and i won't be saying that and i won't be preaching that so don't get all up in arms with me okay i'm not saying women can't work but i'm showing us the the perfect image so that we can strive for the perfect image amen and then we can have grace where we fail amen grace for each other grace for ourselves and those sorts of things amen i'm showing you god's provided now pride provided way and that's where i would prefer to rest amen is god's provided way but we still want to have grace we still want to have mercy for where things change in situations change in these different things but i want to look into this scripture a little deeper because it says if any provide not for his own that word provide means to perceive before to foresee to think of beforehand now where did we just read about that jehovah jireh the lord who sees and the lord who sees to it this is the jehovah jireh attribute in a man being applied to the provision of his family amen so what is it a man is supposed to be forward looking not just saying what is the need for today but what do i see coming down the road where there's going to be a need that i have to provide for and then when you have a wife when you have kids then guess what you know if you have a wife chances are there's going to be children coming someday so you have to be planning how am i going to add kids to this family is the home that i rent is the home that i own going to support that family what kind of vehicle do i have how many kids can i fit into it what kind of budget do i need for my kids they need eyeglasses they need braces they need chiropractic appointments they have sports that they want to play they have school they have to attend all these different things a man's got to be looking forward to see what's coming down the road so he can make provision and planning now so that when the need arises he said i've got this amen that's the jehovah jireh attribute is looking ahead and saying this is what's coming down the road now we don't do this just by planning let me say that remember paul paul admonishes us he says he says we don't say we're going to go to this city and we're going to do this and buy this and sell this and go here and go there he says we say what if the lord willing amen that is remember he's taking it back and saying we've got to check up with god on these things but how many times can i say that we've gone in prayer and we say lord what do we need to do is there something coming is there a change coming in am i going to have to turn a corner am i going to have a need here and do i need to make provision for it and guess what god will put an action on you to save got to put an unction for you to start looking for new work god will put an action on you to maybe upgrade your education upgrade your training whatever it might be because what's he doing he's preparing you for what's coming down the road now you can't see all these things there are things we can see like i said if you're married and you have a wife chances are a kid is going to come at some point right that's just a we ought to be able to see those things if we have kids we know they're going to have needs they're going to need clothes we're going to need a vehicle we're going to need new winter tires we're going to have to maintain the home something's going to break those are all things that we ought to be able to do we're going to have to retire someday right that's all things that we can see but there are things that are coming down the road that we can't know but yet if we are tied to god then he can prepare us for why through prayer through dwelling on it through meditating on it and saying lord what would you have me to do right we can see there's something potentially coming so we say lord what is it and how would you have me prepare and all of a sudden you come to that point and you say wow he really did know what was coming and he really did prepare me but we've got to take that time to say lord will you open my eyes to what i need to do now to prepare for the need that's coming down the road because he's the one that sees it before we ever will and he's the one that can show us how to provide for it amen so this planning does not start when we become a married man when does it start it starts when we're young and single because we've got to start planning then for what's coming down the road if we're going to get married our young men have to prepare to be married don't they they need to have a stable career they need to have a stable job they need to have savings they need to have a vehicle they need to have an income that can support a home they need to have an income that can furnish a home they need to have an income that can send their wife home because everybody here we know we're gonna have to bring in wives right that's the pattern that's the pattern right we gotta import newfoundland is short on on messaged women of the same age of the same age right so what we've got to be looking at that and as young men we have to look and say what is going to be the requirement for me as i step into this role and if i'm not ready for it then i shouldn't be stepping into it either amen i remember when i got married i had ten thousand dollars in the bank by the time we finished doing everything for the wedding and furnishing the house i had less than a hundred dollars left that's how tight it was but i had it i had it and that was the plan i had it i had what we needed to get going but then after that you're really you're really working to build that thing back up again aren't you why you have to look and see what's going to be coming and how can i take care of it amen so so often the problem is not whether women should work for not it's whether men are planning or not that's direct but it's true is is the man planning and providing or is he not doing that and so he's caught by surprise and now he's saying to his wife can you please work to make up the the difference here right why because he hasn't done the jehovah jireh part that god's asked of him and that's to be forward-looking to provide by looking ahead and meeting the needs himself amen the needs exceed the income all of a sudden and he says well what can i do this is my job this is what i make i don't expect to you know anything more than this amount of a raise and all of a sudden our lifestyle is expended ten thousand dollars when i say lifestyle i just mean whatever's happened sometimes it is lifestyle but sometimes it's a baby comes along sometimes we have triplets right that's a big hit isn't it you know these different things we have things happen in life and all of a sudden he's saying holy cow how am i going to deal with this well the thing is we got to be forward looking we got to be planning for this and here's the thing is satan is attacking every day the ability of the man to be the primary breadwinner in the family every day i lived in vancouver where the the the average house was over 1.1 million dollars who's got that kind of money right to make that to make that house payment comfortably you'd have to make almost 300 dollars a year anybody here making three hundred grand never will you never will for most of us three hundred thousand dollars and yet here's the thing i know young men that are there that have good stable jobs and that have found a way to make a living provide for their family still be a church amen still be at the household of faith still supporting the local body and make a living and do that but they work their tails off amen they're sweating and they're toiling and they're doing what it takes to get the job done why they're planning and they're looking and they're trusting god to provide what they need and they're just letting god do it remember they got to work they're still pushing they're always looking for something amen the other thing is that satan is working to do what turn our wants into needs isn't it because we look around and we see what everybody else has and we say well that's the standard but that's not the standard when i got married i had a 1994 volkswagen golf that kept rusting out the uh the flex joint in the exhaust so that it sounded like it had a hole in the muffler all the time okay blocker hated driving it because reverse was right next to first gear and you beat a stop light and you go to put it in the first and you go backwards if you weren't careful so we learned to just touch the release the clutch a bit and make sure it was going forward before we pushed ahead right it's not all fun and games right we don't start at the top we start at the bottom and we work our way up but what is happening is satan is saying no you've got to have a vacation or two every year you got to have a new car you got to have a nice home it's got to be beautifully furnished you have to have the latest and greatest clothes you got to do this you got to do that you got to drive this you got to be here you got to do that that's not a need that's a want in most cases right yeah my vehicles are eight and nine years old right now right we don't need the latest and greatest right what we need is something reliable that will do the job right we don't need the biggest house now you may need a big house if you're going to be hosting a lot if you're doing these different things but we don't need it it's a nice to have amen and when i look at what i started out in blanc and i have lived in a place that wasn't even a one bedroom it was an all room it was one big room and that's what we lived in right why that's what we could afford it's the way it is and then you work your way up and you get to this and that we can't be looking ahead to what everybody else has because if you look at what it took to get there you got to go through the same thing amen it'll develop your character as you go i can definitely say that i remember living in bc and we rented a townhouse for almost two thousand dollars a month and that was a good deal and blanc and i we used to go for a walk pretty much every day and i walk around and as we walk by the driveways i'd list out how much was how much car payment was sitting in that driveway and i can't tell you how many driveways had more fifteen hundred dollars or more in vehicles sitting in their driveway how do you afford a fifteen hundred dollar car payment every month right you know how you do it dual income and usually no kids that's how you do it and what you do is you get both of them in there to support a lifestyle rather than to support a need and those kids that they might have are going to a daycare center every day and they're not being raised by their mother they're they'd obviously be raised by their father and instead they're living a great lifestyle to what make the payments on every all the stuff that they have amen the latest phone the latest gadget the latest this the latest that and all of a sudden they've got to make so much money to live a lifestyle rather than living it the way god has intended us and what happens something's got to give right you can't step out of the you can't step out of the perfect image of god and expect to grow right something's got to give right if a man is always working then it's going to have an impact if a man is never working it's going to have an impact right if a wife is being pulled out of the home it's going to have an impact isn't it the meals are going to suffer the kids are going to suffer the wash is going to suffer and usually what happens is what the woman's pulled in to do more and the man doesn't step up and do more himself right there's no there's rarely an offsetting of duties is there if he wants her to step in then all of a sudden she's doing everything a wife is supposed to do everything a mother's supposed to do and she's working and he's just working right it's not right it shouldn't be amen we ought to have a balance in these things amen the thing is something's got to give and the question is this will it be the thing of god that gives right will it be the word of god that gives or will it be something else is the big question we have to ask so watch who the man is responsible it says if he provide not for his own and then especially for those of his own house now that house means household and the greek says it is belonging to a house or family domestic and intimate so that's our family but it also says belonging to one's household related by blood kindred or belonging to the household of god right this is not just an obligation now to your blood relations to your wife to your children to your mom your dad your brothers or sisters or those different things but this is to the household of faith that we are also responsible for now you say how do we do that look in the book of acts chapter 4 and we see the provision that's there it says and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common now here they held all things in common that means that everyone took their money put it into a central pot and it was divided by the by the deacons and whatnot to meet the needs of the local body now this is not a scriptural command we're not commanded to hold all things in common but what we are commanded men is we are commanded to provide for the needs of the household of faith as well so the bible doesn't say we have to do this and that's why we don't do it right that's why we don't do it but it does say you need to be looking out for your brothers and sisters as well and then we need to be helping where we can help and it's not always financial amen i loved it i so appreciated it when i moved here and i asked people to come help guess what all the brothers showed up and it took us what 20 minutes or something like that because all the brothers showed up also because we didn't bring much but it was great because it was just quick in and out in and out in and out and everything was done and then when we go and we go to the church and we clean up what is it the brothers and the kids come and they do it if somebody has a need over at the house what happens the brothers will go and do it and then they're providing for the household of faith not just for their own family now your first responsibility is to your own family and man we can't be doing more for everyone else and leaving our family destitute in any way but if you've got time and money or effort and strength after that then it's to be put into the household of faith first and then those that are without after that amen we're to be providers throughout the entire community if we look at the scripture fully listen to this galatians 6 says and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men now this is not just to the men but we're talking to the men today especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen so even if you don't have a family as in you're not a married man at this point you still have a family you have your local family you have your your your your uh your you know your your mom your dad your sisters and and brothers and these different things but you also have the household of faith so the young men have an obligation to support what the local household of faith and how do we do that ties and offerings right how is it that we pay to bring people in by ties and offerings right so the more we bring in the more we can give right and so when we do that by working when we do that by bringing in income and then we tithe and do our offering on it then it helps the household of faith when there's a need in the body how do the deacons pay for it they don't pull it out of their pocket typically what do they do they go into the church offering fund and they say there's a need hey there's money praise the lord let's meet the local need with what we have to do we see that with our tuition reimbursement program we see that when we have needs people that have lost their jobs are facing difficult situations and whatnot is what we're supporting the household of faith with what we give in tithes and offerings as well so god has a whole way provided to to support and provide for the needs of the local body right and it's not just when we get married that we start doing it we do it as soon as we're of a workable age and we can bring in income it has an effect on the whole local body amen now there's plenty of examples of women helping out and we're going to get into that when we start talking about the sisters lord willing but the primary role is for the man to do it and paul ties it directly to your spiritual walk and that's that if you refuse to do it or you refuse to do it to your full strength then you're worse than an infidel because you're not bringing forth the full fruit of the holy spirit as being the provider for your family amen it's part of a christ-like masculine nature and it's not just a suggestion it's a command to the men it's a command to the men it's not a command to the women doesn't mean that women can't help but it's a command to the men and the men alone amen it's optional for the sisters if i could put it that way and then like i said before this is a type of christ in the bride and does the bride provide for herself she doesn't we read it i'll read it again but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by christ jesus and that's where we stand as we look to the we look to the main provider we trust in the main provider and then in the in this world if we have to put in a helping hand we'll see that amen amen amen almost done we see that the bride takes the word and she puts it into action amen that's what we're looking for is a bride that'll take what is brought into the house and she'll put it into action she'll put it into good action into profitable action into fruitful action and then we see a shift if i could add this we see a shift because prior to calvary we have this this word that says be fruitful and multiply and he never backs away from it he never backs away from be fruitful and multiply all the way through to the all the way to revelation but what we see is we see be fruitful and multiply because you have a worldly kingdom coming your way you're having a natural land coming your way so you need to be fruitful and multiply so that you can be in there so that you can be blessed in there and so that you can hold it amen so you need a people to do that you can't walk into the whole land of canaan and hold it with with jacob and his twelve sons you needed hundreds of thousands you needed millions of people to go in there and to make it a great land right so the fruitful multiply was to what bring them into their kingdom right that was their promise god's promise to israel was not future you know it wasn't future home like we looked a future home it was the land of israel that was their promise was it was a natural land where they could have natural lives where they could have natural safety and natural provision and it was god that would be doing that for them but it was a land that was supposed to be theirs forever and ever but but then what happens is they reject christ and after calvary we don't see him saying to the new bride right to the real bride he doesn't say be fruitful and multiply what does he say go ye into all the world right it's a different fruitful and multiply because what now we're looking for spiritual seed we're not looking for natural seed so that's why we don't have to focus so much on having a ton of children we're not looking for natural children now our goal is not to bring in natural children our goal is to bring in spiritual children it's to go out and bring in the seed of god that are waiting to go into that rapture bring them into the bride let them see who they are and when that's done then we get to go to our kingdom amen that's our be fruitful and multiply for the gentile now is what go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and bring in those that are meant to be in this land why the kingdom of heaven thy kingdom come that's the work that we're doing now is the kingdom of heaven not the kingdom of this earth all of israel was looking for what a kingdom on this earth when the messiah came what were they looking for their messiah to do kick out the romans they weren't interested in heaven they were interested in earth but when we when we're here and our god comes when christ comes for us what are we looking for we're not looking for him to kick them out we're looking for him to take us out and then we'll come back with him and we'll do what needs to be done on this earth amen amen like i said we're in a sinful world things aren't perfect and so that means that situations aren't perfect it means that things are going to be difficult it means that our brothers are going to have to do things that are difficult that means that our sisters are sometimes going to have to do things that are difficult when it comes to this provision side amen but god has grace for that god has great flirt and we ought to as well amen and we ought to be able to find that grace in the scripture and that's what we're going to do as we move forward into wednesday's service lord willing is we'll see what happens when those things when those things take place and how do we address it scripturally how do we address it and look at it the way god looks at it and how do we keep ourselves in alignment with the word when things aren't as perfect as they ought to be amen amen let's all stand together if we would and then i wanted to keep it tight this morning teaching amen like i said we've got the perfect type in front of us and that's always our striving for right we're always looking to be exactly as christ is and where we fail we look for grace and we trust his mercy in those situations amen let's just bow our heads if we would heavenly father in all of this lord in all of this word if there's anything lord that we could take out lord let it be an encouragement that you have met our every need lord that we sit in heavenly places amen lord that we are your chosen bride lord and that as you have provided for us lord spiritually so you will provide for us naturally and lord as we look at these things of provision lord of position lord of scriptural

our broken minds lord your work with our failures lord your work with our inadequacies lord you'll work with everything that might hold us back lord but you'll prevail through it if we will just humble ourselves to your word and trust you that what you say is true and it'll still work today lord as i said we don't want a god of yesterday lord we want a god of today and we believe you're jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen lord we pray that as we speak on these things that you would quicken our ears lord that you would just touch our lives may you quicken our faith above

and she was healed and he said he said it's not um he said it depends on how you touch him right that's really good advice but it depends on how you touch jesus how we approach him and how we touch
