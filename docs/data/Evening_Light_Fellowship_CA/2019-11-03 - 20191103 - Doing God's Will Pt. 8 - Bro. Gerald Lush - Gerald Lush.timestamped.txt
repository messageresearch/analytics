[56:36] because the present tense God is here we
[56:40] have the present a man believeth now
[56:44] this hallelu praise the name of the Lord
[56:48] Amen hallelujah
[56:50] god bless return with me to first Peter
[56:52] chapter 3 verse Peter chapter 3 I was
[56:59] advised I don't know who advised me of
[57:01] that but there's certain of the Brethren
[57:05] when they're having a community for
[57:07] washing the pack apparently the pastor
[57:09] doesn't preach he just comes out and
[57:12] just ministers concerning communion foot
[57:14] washing and they just go in and do it
[57:16] that's it oh well I I don't think I'm
[57:20] that pastor I said so I said we'll see
[57:23] what what the Lord will do a man because
[57:26] even if we go through those the tapes of
[57:29] the prophet of the books of the Prophet
[57:31] the the recorded messages he he came out
[57:34] and he ministered and then they went
[57:36] into the communion a mat and so and far
[57:41] as I know it was all the way mainly all
[57:42] the way down through his ministry he
[57:44] didn't come out and lay the sermon aside
[57:46] no he came out and preached first and
[57:48] then went into the communion a mat so
[57:50] brothers sister why because we need that
[57:53] we need the challenge of the word amen
[57:56] and it's not just a challenge of first
[57:57] Corinthians 11 but the setting up of the
[58:01] communion no no no no God there's other
[58:03] things that God wants wants to challenge
[58:05] us with his word not only that there
[58:09] might be a brother here that got a need
[58:10] there might be a sister with a need
[58:12] maybe here or online are you on YouTube
[58:15] whatever but praying the grace of God
[58:17] will meet that need
[58:18] amen maybe it'll be a certain scripture
[58:21] that you're looking for maybe it'll be a
[58:23] certain thought that God through the
[58:25] ministry will explain and whatever it is
[58:27] again you know you know there's there's
[58:29] a reason for the fifl ministry and it's
[58:32] this and this and this and this a man
[58:34] and and and yet there are those that
[58:37] don't believe in the fivefold ministry
[58:38] that is that's the truth
[58:40] and they they just don't I just go to
[58:42] and hear their pastor and that's it and
[58:44] there's some wood even near the pastor
[58:46] and that is the truth you know just
[58:48] well I just gonna listen to the prophet
[58:50] may amazing brother and we think old
[58:54] gods from the Prophet for the opening
[58:55] the seven seals well they better go back
[58:58] to those seals again a man and go back
[59:02] to the questions and answers on the
[59:04] seals a Myatt because there's the in the
[59:07] questions and answers on the seals they
[59:08] asked a prophet of God does the bride
[59:10] have a ministry and he said yes he says
[59:14] been with her since the day of Pentecost
[59:16] and he said is the faithful ministry and
[59:19] he said it's right there he said she's
[59:21] got apostles and prophets and teachers
[59:23] and pastors and so on and so on it is
[59:26] for the perfecting of the saints and yet
[59:28] you've got so-called believers now they
[59:30] profess to believe but they really don't
[59:33] amen that's the truth they don't believe
[59:35] their brother because if you're gonna
[59:37] believe the the opening of the seven
[59:38] seals you got to believe the questions
[59:40] and answers on the seals a man so
[59:43] brother they believe the Prophet because
[59:45] to believe this the prophets are that
[59:46] they believe that the prophets are that
[59:48] but what about what he said about the
[59:49] fivefold ministry a man brother B and
[59:53] knowing that he said now he said you
[59:55] young ministers here he said he said he
[59:58] should be on your on your toes or
[1:00:00] whatever he said because you're going to
[1:00:02] have to you're gonna have to take this
[1:00:03] message on to the coming of the Lord
[1:00:07] amen praise the name of the Lord and
[1:00:10] that's just not that's just not the only
[1:00:12] the seven seals brother we're gonna take
[1:00:14] it on to there through the literal
[1:00:15] physical coming of the Lord the change
[1:00:18] of our body the resurrection the rapture
[1:00:20] a man so brother
[1:00:22] I pray grace God give us the revelation
[1:00:25] that we need a mayor guy and a God that
[1:00:27] was to recognize our need of the
[1:00:29] ministry and God help us to recognize
[1:00:31] who our pastor is a man by the grace of
[1:00:34] God well it's the Holy Ghost but he's
[1:00:36] going to come down and minister to a
[1:00:37] pastor I was like oh yeah
[1:00:40] praise the Lord bear with me and he said
[1:00:42] again somebody said oh brother Brown III
[1:00:45] don't need a teacher because the Holy
[1:00:47] Ghost is my teacher well brother brother
[1:00:49] had the brother he said he said the Holy
[1:00:51] Ghost
[1:00:52] uses the teacher he said he's got a
[1:00:54] teacher out there as part of the
[1:00:56] fivefold ministry and he uses the
[1:00:58] teacher to teach you a man he's not
[1:01:00] going to bypass the teacher he's
[1:01:02] he's gonna use the teacher a man and
[1:01:04] again he was dealing with those fears -
[1:01:06] you and I are dealing with people that
[1:01:08] don't believe in a fivefold ministry so
[1:01:11] the grace of God brother to help us amen
[1:01:13] to recognize and and respect the
[1:01:15] ministry that God got there God got over
[1:01:17] there a guy got somewhere else
[1:01:19] a man so god help us is my prayer
[1:01:22] so being prayer and I'll try not to be
[1:01:24] too long but again there's a number of
[1:01:27] things that I want to share with you and
[1:01:28] again you can go on and on and on until
[1:01:31] we blend into eternity
[1:01:32] a man by the grace of God and and that's
[1:01:35] why we're gonna oh yeah yeah we're gonna
[1:01:38] go on and on and the prophet of God said
[1:01:39] it's good they ours company so when it
[1:01:41] wouldn't meet wouldn't hurt us to meet
[1:01:42] every night yeah yeah so that that had
[1:01:46] all your God's gonna create that hunger
[1:01:48] and that thirst amen
[1:01:50] God's gonna create what it's gonna be
[1:01:52] it's gonna be there anything you're
[1:01:53] gonna want it amen now we're caught up
[1:01:56] we're busy with this with this with this
[1:01:58] but but there's hours coming when God's
[1:02:00] going to create that hunger that thirst
[1:02:02] and we're online come on we got to get
[1:02:04] together we got to get together why
[1:02:06] because you're gonna see so much
[1:02:07] happening out there
[1:02:08] and so much going on you know what we
[1:02:11] need you our faith to increase we need
[1:02:14] to get that faith Lord for the
[1:02:15] resurrection we need to get that faith
[1:02:17] for the rapture more and more and more
[1:02:18] by grace don't let us miss the rapture
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:22] because somebody is going to miss it I
[1:02:24] pray it's not you and me
[1:02:25] amen somebody's going to miss the
[1:02:28] resurrection that's the way they're
[1:02:29] gonna be the ones to ask where's the
[1:02:30] rapture yeah yeah I mean it'll strike
[1:02:32] them it's already happened you didn't
[1:02:34] know it let's let's see what God is
[1:02:37] doing if they didn't know it then it's
[1:02:40] like God was doing something and they
[1:02:41] didn't know amen let's recognize what
[1:02:44] God's doing in you and in me
[1:02:46] amen in 1st Peter chapter 3 and verse 18
[1:02:51] and this was
[1:02:57] Parvez text when he ministered on a very
[1:03:01] serious sermon in November 1963 and it's
[1:03:08] even more serious now and it was
[1:03:12] entitled souls that are imprisoned now a
[1:03:17] man not so that we're in prison souls
[1:03:20] that are in prison and we are
[1:03:23] ministering to souls in prison your your
[1:03:26] testimony is two souls in prison a man
[1:03:29] you're witnessing two souls in prison so
[1:03:32] brother that's as straight as it is and
[1:03:34] it's going to get worse and worse and
[1:03:35] worse till there's absolutely no seat of
[1:03:39] God out there to hear the word of God
[1:03:41] but there's going to be souls in prison
[1:03:43] so the grace of God brother that we're
[1:03:47] going to be the seed of God the right of
[1:03:49] Christ
[1:03:50] going into the resurrection of rapture
[1:03:52] not souls in prison for Christ also and
[1:03:56] once suffered for sins the just for the
[1:04:00] unjust that he might bring us to God
[1:04:04] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:04:07] quickened by the Spirit and by the
[1:04:10] Spirit and by the Holy Ghost it is to
[1:04:13] bring us back to God and by which also
[1:04:16] he went and he preached unto the spirits
[1:04:20] in prison which sometime were
[1:04:23] disobedient souls in prison Jesus went
[1:04:28] and preached to them a man and when we
[1:04:32] know he went in to testify listen the
[1:04:36] Prophet said I was coming and Here I am
[1:04:38] you didn't believe it in the days of
[1:04:40] Noah he didn't believe it in the days of
[1:04:42] Abraham you didn't believe it in the
[1:04:44] days of the prophets or Elijah but here
[1:04:46] I am a man see Justin just know this and
[1:04:50] I know there's a lot a lot of people
[1:04:52] think when a person dies say that's it
[1:04:53] they're gone and they're just wait for
[1:04:55] the resurrection no there's like the
[1:04:57] rich man there lifted up his eyes and
[1:04:59] helped being in torment a man and Jesus
[1:05:02] went down and preached to those souls in
[1:05:04] prison a man and when he was finished
[1:05:07] there and he gave them the witness I I
[1:05:08] am the resurrection and
[1:05:10] rapture a man he took the keys of death
[1:05:13] and of hell from the devil and he went
[1:05:15] over to he went over to the two who were
[1:05:17] referred to his paradise any empty
[1:05:19] paradise a man and and what for but with
[1:05:23] the seed that believed God with the seed
[1:05:26] to believe the prophets with the seed
[1:05:27] that believed Abraham and so on right on
[1:05:29] right on from from the Garden of Eden
[1:05:31] right on up to that time a man there
[1:05:34] Jesus laid down his life any many and he
[1:05:37] took the mirtha and they went up they
[1:05:39] ascended with a one songs 121 that it
[1:05:43] that is the Messiah going up and and and
[1:05:45] the seed of God with him going up a man
[1:05:47] that he they a man then he took out of
[1:05:51] the prison the devil he put him in a man
[1:05:53] man now they weren't they weren't in
[1:05:55] torment and it says by which also he
[1:05:58] went and preached on to the spirits in
[1:06:01] prison which sometime were disobedient
[1:06:05] but he went down to redeem those that
[1:06:07] weren't there were obedient when once
[1:06:10] the long-suffering of God waited in the
[1:06:12] days of Noah while the ark was a
[1:06:15] preparing wherein few that is eight
[1:06:18] souls were saved by water a man by the
[1:06:22] grace of God because they believed
[1:06:25] Noah's message and the light figure were
[1:06:29] on - even baptism doth also now save us
[1:06:32] not the putting away of the filth of the
[1:06:36] flesh but the answer of a good
[1:06:39] conscience toward God by the
[1:06:44] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:06:46] a man who is gone into heaven and is on
[1:06:51] the right hand of God angels and
[1:06:55] authorities and powers being made
[1:06:57] subject unto Him god bless his words you
[1:07:01] may be seated a man turn with me to
[1:07:07] again the familiar scripture that we
[1:07:09] have read a number of times in reference
[1:07:11] many times and that is Matthew chapter
[1:07:13] 24 and brother Branham himself as
[1:07:19] referenced it many times and
[1:07:22] that he highlighted the fact that
[1:07:24] Matthew 24 he said is the same as the
[1:07:28] seven seals and he said the salmon seals
[1:07:32] he said are revealed in Matthew 24 and
[1:07:34] the Prado God did highlight and he went
[1:07:38] he preached the seals but he also went
[1:07:40] back to Matthew 24 and the highlight of
[1:07:42] the mystery of the seven seals in
[1:07:44] Matthew 24 and let's begin to read at
[1:07:48] verse four and this is the first seal a
[1:07:53] man Matthew 24 and verse in verse 4 and
[1:07:56] in Jesus and to be cut know verse 3 and
[1:07:59] as he set up on the Mount of Olives the
[1:08:01] disciples came unto him privately saying
[1:08:04] tell us when shall these things mean
[1:08:08] concerning his coming and concerning the
[1:08:10] destruction of Jerusalem and the temple
[1:08:14] he said when shall these things me and
[1:08:17] he said what shall be the sign of thy
[1:08:20] coming and of the end of the world so he
[1:08:25] gave them a revelation the mystery he
[1:08:29] denied lighted there but is highlighted
[1:08:31] in Revelation 10 and that is the mystery
[1:08:34] of the seven seals there this was going
[1:08:37] to happen that was going to happen and
[1:08:39] now he had the seven seals he said he
[1:08:42] said come right on down through the
[1:08:44] seven church ages and then this sister
[1:08:47] this is the first seal and and the baby
[1:08:50] said the second seal and in there
[1:08:53] there's third and then there's the
[1:08:54] fourth seal and but he said the salmon
[1:08:58] seal breaks under the four didn't intend
[1:09:01] to come here ministry on the seals but
[1:09:03] he said the salmon sealed will break
[1:09:04] under the fourth Church H and that was
[1:09:07] in Luther's time because God said I will
[1:09:09] restore a man so under the under the
[1:09:12] fourth seal to fit under the four days -
[1:09:14] 15 - 6 and so on that there there is or
[1:09:17] rather the fourth story the the seals
[1:09:21] for the Jews Easter there they're also
[1:09:23] under under these Church ages because
[1:09:26] God is during God is working on the
[1:09:27] Gentiles but at the same time he said
[1:09:30] God is also working on the Jews a man
[1:09:32] and when God has finished with it with
[1:09:34] the Gentiles in the
[1:09:36] the other seven seals and the mystery of
[1:09:38] God then he said he said the bride is
[1:09:40] shaken out and he said the mystery good
[1:09:42] and the Spirit of God goes back to the
[1:09:44] Jews a man praise the name of the Lord
[1:09:47] because the bride has been calling on
[1:09:49] God Amanda for the coming of the Lord
[1:09:52] and the mystery of his coming the
[1:09:53] revelation of his coming a man because
[1:09:56] even Pentecost the Pentecostal revival
[1:09:59] they really thought and believed that
[1:10:01] there they were going to see the coming
[1:10:02] of the Lord
[1:10:03] but that generation has gone on that's a
[1:10:05] that's a hundred years ago or over a
[1:10:07] hundred years ago that God started the
[1:10:10] Pentecostal revival and those that
[1:10:12] witnessed it are gone on by there was
[1:10:15] another generation coming whereby that
[1:10:17] God was going to climax the climax the
[1:10:21] Pentecostal revival a man by the grace
[1:10:23] of God and that he was going to reveal
[1:10:26] the mystery of God even on to the coming
[1:10:28] of the Lord the resurrection the rapture
[1:10:30] and when he was finished there than it
[1:10:32] was going back to the Jews praise the
[1:10:35] name of the Lord and if you and I are
[1:10:36] are seen anything we are seeing the
[1:10:39] gospel going back to the Jews we are
[1:10:42] seeing God bringing it to a conclusion
[1:10:44] when it comes to what he prophesied in
[1:10:46] what he said he was going to do for the
[1:10:48] Gentiles Brotherhood that is the
[1:10:51] resurrection and the rapture and brother
[1:10:53] what was God going to do it was the
[1:10:56] opening of the mystery of God
[1:10:57] it was the finish of the mystery of God
[1:10:59] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:11:01] angel revelation 10 that he was going to
[1:11:03] send that messenger and then the opening
[1:11:06] of the mystery of God whatwhat was that
[1:11:07] for
[1:11:08] it was to give the bride the revelation
[1:11:10] that she needed for the resurrection and
[1:11:12] the rapture a man we didn't get there at
[1:11:15] the faith for the resurrection of faith
[1:11:17] for the rapture from the Pentecostal
[1:11:19] revival no no it is too bright revival a
[1:11:22] Maya in the old me of the seven seals
[1:11:24] God has given us the revelation of the
[1:11:27] word the mystery of God to give the
[1:11:29] bride the faith for the resurrection the
[1:11:32] faith for the rapture a man so I pray
[1:11:35] grace might be better all mine that and
[1:11:37] as we're going to keep going into the
[1:11:40] word that we're getting more and more
[1:11:42] and more into the faith of the
[1:11:44] resurrection we're getting more and more
[1:11:46] into the faith of the rapture brother
[1:11:49] sister to know what is God doing brother
[1:11:52] what's God doing the prophet of God said
[1:11:54] what brother it's been going on for a
[1:11:56] number of years and what is that he said
[1:11:58] the resurrection he said the
[1:12:00] resurrection is not going to happen the
[1:12:02] resurrection is already going on and he
[1:12:04] has been going on and going on and going
[1:12:06] on till finally it's going to climax
[1:12:08] with the change of our body and then
[1:12:10] will we refer to as the rapture but
[1:12:13] brother let's get into the revelation of
[1:12:15] the resurrection now a man you a they
[1:12:17] quicken Jesus or Paul said in Ephesians
[1:12:20] you had they quickened who were dead in
[1:12:22] sins and trespasses and we have been
[1:12:25] caught up into heavenly places in Christ
[1:12:27] and again the prophet of God say what's
[1:12:29] going on in heavily places in Christ and
[1:12:32] he said the words mean reveal any man
[1:12:34] and any way any generation in any age
[1:12:38] knows that now it is it is the bride age
[1:12:40] Amen that we have been resurrected we
[1:12:43] have been quickened we have been made a
[1:12:45] light spiritually and we've been caught
[1:12:47] up spiritually amai and God and we have
[1:12:50] been brought in to the end where God is
[1:12:52] revealing his word revealing the mystery
[1:12:54] of God and he's given us what he's given
[1:12:56] us resurrection and rapturing faint by
[1:12:59] the grace of God caught up into a
[1:13:01] heavenly priests in Christ and brother
[1:13:04] were cut up we are raptured smoothly
[1:13:06] then God wants us to get the revelation
[1:13:09] of the rapture physically god help us
[1:13:11] brother in the name of Jesus that were
[1:13:14] not putting the emphasis just on this
[1:13:16] mystery of that mystery of that mystery
[1:13:18] but it is the climax of all the
[1:13:20] mysteries and it is the resurrection and
[1:13:23] it is the rapture a man so this is the
[1:13:26] revelation that I'll be coming more and
[1:13:28] more and more real to us a man than the
[1:13:31] other mysteries this mystery that
[1:13:33] mystery the guardian serpent see and
[1:13:35] other mysteries that God revealed
[1:13:38] through the opening of the seven seals
[1:13:40] but the climax is the change of our
[1:13:42] bodies the climax is going at a time in
[1:13:45] into eternity because if God did
[1:13:48] anything for the Ministry of Malachi for
[1:13:50] it is to bring us in contact with
[1:13:52] eternity amen it is in history it is to
[1:13:56] make us more and more subject more and
[1:13:58] more conscious of eternity and less and
[1:14:00] less conscious of time amen
[1:14:02] because there's anything that we want a
[1:14:04] man oh brother sister if you're if you
[1:14:07] got the sheet of God in you you got the
[1:14:09] life of God in you the agreements Christ
[1:14:11] in you brother they said you're you're
[1:14:13] sick and you're tired you're fit up and
[1:14:15] you want to go you want to go because
[1:14:18] they got to the place where Jesus he
[1:14:20] wanted to go and then and I have
[1:14:23] highlighted the scriptures where Jesus
[1:14:26] mentioned it out he was in mark 17 or
[1:14:29] Matthew 17 I have much longer shall I be
[1:14:31] with you how long shall I be with you he
[1:14:34] said and then he said I am no more in
[1:14:36] the world but then the Lord led me to
[1:14:39] another scripture here and I said all
[1:14:40] that I said Lord that's tremendous I got
[1:14:43] to share that with the Saints clue and
[1:14:45] it was it was in mark chapter 9 and it's
[1:14:48] in verse 19 and he answered him and
[1:14:50] saith unto Him well it was a question
[1:14:54] that he was asked and says when he when
[1:14:59] he came to his disciples he saw a great
[1:15:02] multitude about them and the scribes
[1:15:04] questioning with them and straightway
[1:15:07] all the people when they beheld him were
[1:15:10] greatly amazed and running to him
[1:15:13] saluted him yeah but they didn't
[1:15:16] recognize the full revelation of what
[1:15:18] God was doing through him a man and he
[1:15:22] asked the scribes what question ye with
[1:15:25] them and one of the multitude answered
[1:15:27] him and said master I have brought unto
[1:15:30] thee my son which has a dumb spirit and
[1:15:33] wheresoever he taketh him atera them and
[1:15:36] he fullness and he gnashes with his
[1:15:38] teeth and pint of the way and I Speights
[1:15:42] with I disciples that they should cast
[1:15:44] him out and they could not why because
[1:15:47] they never had the faith that Jesus said
[1:15:49] than ever the faith that Jesus was
[1:15:52] giving the example of a man a man and
[1:15:55] Jesus was setting the example not only
[1:15:57] in
[1:15:58] his actions but in his words and in any
[1:16:01] in his deeds hey man he so I took him to
[1:16:05] the earlier just what's your thing
[1:16:06] that Jesus had already given the
[1:16:08] disables power over the devil you know
[1:16:10] they gave him power to do this and they
[1:16:12] went out and did this they did this they
[1:16:13] did that but when this man brought his
[1:16:16] son to them they couldn't do it
[1:16:17] amen why not because they never had the
[1:16:22] perfect thing a man and he said and he
[1:16:26] answered him and said and they could not
[1:16:30] cast him out and they could and he said
[1:16:32] they couldn't do it
[1:16:33] anybody jesus answered him and said o
[1:16:36] faithless generation a man he was
[1:16:40] dealing with a faithless generation you
[1:16:42] and I are living in a faithless
[1:16:44] generation we're living in a generation
[1:16:46] of living by their census amen not thing
[1:16:49] you're living by what they can see where
[1:16:51] they can feel what they can touch a man
[1:16:54] but what we were living by what they
[1:16:56] could what they believe in the Word of
[1:16:57] God who is living according to what God
[1:16:59] has revealed Cory what God is saying
[1:17:01] ain't may absolutely we're just
[1:17:04] believing the Word of God amen we're not
[1:17:07] going by our feelings when I green by
[1:17:09] our senses we're not going by our sight
[1:17:11] we're going by our faith amen
[1:17:14] because without it it's impossible to
[1:17:17] please God I don't care how much we say
[1:17:20] that we believe this we believe that I
[1:17:22] believe God I got sin a prophet I
[1:17:24] believe this mystery I believe that
[1:17:25] mystery no no God looking for faith
[1:17:28] don't know don't tell me
[1:17:30] show me a man so there do you have the
[1:17:33] faith not not adjusted the knowledge in
[1:17:37] your head do you have the faith for you
[1:17:39] in your life and you're going out and
[1:17:41] you're living there faint a man you're
[1:17:43] living my faith amen this is what Jesus
[1:17:46] is looking at this is what Jesus is
[1:17:48] looking for in the end of the circles
[1:17:50] and in us you're looking for those that
[1:17:52] are living by faith now those are say
[1:17:55] they got faith now those that talk faith
[1:17:57] those that they live it hey man
[1:18:01] and the answer has said o faithless
[1:18:03] generation and we are living in that
[1:18:06] generation as Jesus lived in it we are
[1:18:09] living in it
[1:18:10] and listen to what he said and he said
[1:18:12] how long should I be with you amen
[1:18:17] yeah I wonder how many of us aren't
[1:18:19] questioning how long Lord will I be in
[1:18:22] this generation how long will I have to
[1:18:24] put up with this spirit of unbelief in
[1:18:26] this old world hello
[1:18:28] well I had to deal with the devil much
[1:18:30] more amen
[1:18:32] the spirit of unbelief he said how long
[1:18:35] should I be with you and how long shall
[1:18:37] I suffer you how many of her suffering
[1:18:42] because of the unbelief and Marist feel
[1:18:47] that pressure of unbelief and Jesus felt
[1:18:52] it oh yeah how many of us are feeling it
[1:18:55] then I met you yeah we do we just can't
[1:18:58] walk we just can't bear to go out there
[1:19:00] and mix with the world no because
[1:19:02] there's too much unbelief there's no
[1:19:04] faith they're not denied and I get
[1:19:06] confessing their faith in God then I
[1:19:08] confessing their faith in Jesus it's
[1:19:10] like when I went went to a barbershop

[1:24:11] amen others knew that but they knew
[1:24:13] Jesus was different a man and it got any
[1:24:16] and and Jesus got to that place why
[1:24:19] because he was more and more
[1:24:20] experiencing a faithless generation and
[1:24:23] brother you and I are experiencing a
[1:24:25] faithless generation amen

[1:24:56] whether the way that Jesus felt that's
[1:24:59] the way the bride fields brother why
[1:25:01] it's a faithless generation because one
[1:25:03] time there they had faint weather

[1:25:10] better early Pentecostal thing

[1:25:41] brother but now you know you hardly find
[1:25:43] that among believers little longer there
[1:25:46] in denominations a man and sometimes
[1:25:49] denominations are going to rise in
[1:25:50] judgment against relievers that's right
[1:25:53] brother god help us to live in the
[1:25:54] spirit god help us to walk in the spirit
[1:25:56] God ever said god help us for that we're

[1:31:03] how many are taking heed that no man
[1:31:05] deceive them than to do that you had to
[1:31:08] stay with the Word of God but they were

[1:33:16] tribulation of those days shall the Sun
[1:33:18] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[1:33:20] her light and the stars shall fall from
[1:33:22] heaven and the powers of the heavens
[1:33:24] shall be shaken and then shall appear
[1:33:27] the sign of the Son of man in heaven
[1:33:29] amen
[1:33:31] he's coming back to the Jews and then
[1:33:34] shall have certain the tribes of the
[1:33:35] earth mourn and they shall see the Son
[1:33:38] of man coming in the clouds of heaven
[1:33:40] with power and great glory
[1:33:42] and he shall send His angels with a
[1:33:45] great sound of a trumpet and they shall
[1:33:47] gather together his elect from the four
[1:33:49] winds from one end of heaven to the
[1:33:52] other
[1:33:52] the six seal and the Provost said the
[1:33:56] seventh seal that day an hour knoweth no
[1:33:58] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:34:01] father also and as it was in the days of
[1:34:04] Noah saw in the coming of the Son of Man
[1:34:06] as in the days that were before the
[1:34:08] flood they were eating drinking marrying
[1:34:10] giving in marriage and so on and knew
[1:34:12] not to the flood came and took them all
[1:34:14] the way amen and he said there be this
[1:34:19] and this and this but know this if the
[1:34:23] good man of the house had known what
[1:34:25] time the thief would come he would have
[1:34:27] watched and would have not suffered his
[1:34:29] house to be broken up therefore be ye
[1:34:32] also ready for in such an hour as ye
[1:34:35] think not the Son of man cometh a man
[1:34:40] grace to us to get into the revelation
[1:34:45] of what God has done and what God is
[1:34:48] doing brother when we see it and we
[1:34:52] recognize brother the hour that we're
[1:34:54] living Jesus I believe that brother
[1:35:01] Branham felt as Jesus did yeah he
[1:35:05] mentions in this book on souls in prison
[1:35:07] now bear with me I wonder if we feel
[1:35:16] like this oh yeah well I'll tell you if
[1:35:21] maybe the problem is as this brother
[1:35:24] said right here in his email and it's
[1:35:26] from the brother I would say this
[1:35:30] morning is it with the Branham
[1:35:32] tabernacle
[1:35:33] because I met this brother who three
[1:35:37] years ago we have fellowship he was the
[1:35:41] one that showed us around Jeffersonville
[1:35:43] and so on him and his wife that was with
[1:35:46] myself and sister Betty and again this
[1:35:49] is an email that I got yesterday but
[1:35:51] again he's been a he's been attending
[1:35:53] that I guess to bet him to have an icon
[1:35:54] for almost 50 years
[1:35:56] yeah but as a young boy he was there and
[1:35:59] even now as a senior brother there and
[1:36:02] so on and so they've been listening to
[1:36:05] tapes for 50 years 50 years and brother
[1:36:10] he knew knows now that after all those
[1:36:14] years it wasn't striking the people
[1:36:16] right and that's what the problem God
[1:36:19] said he said it's not striking you right
[1:36:21] and he says not striking me right why
[1:36:24] because it wasn't the hour but now it is
[1:36:28] the hour he may go I share that with you
[1:36:31] shortly
[1:36:32] but the part of God said in this book
[1:36:34] right here on souls in prison now and he
[1:36:38] said he said why he said I have
[1:36:42] scratched my head listen
[1:36:44] he said I have wallowed on my pillow and
[1:36:47] he said I have walked the floor and he's
[1:36:52] asked himself the question what's the
[1:36:55] matter with you
[1:36:55] a few days ago I asked to man I was
[1:37:01] writing with he said I asked Jack Moore
[1:37:03] one time he said I asked I asked my wife
[1:37:06] I want to ask you a question don't pull
[1:37:10] no parts that Ruth and I said have I
[1:37:13] studied so much he said listen he said I
[1:37:16] am I'm a make up funny odd and he said
[1:37:20] what what kind of a person and he said
[1:37:23] well he said you can't make yourself you
[1:37:25] are what you are by the grace of God and
[1:37:28] I said in East and he asked his wife he
[1:37:31] asked whether Jack Moore and he said EV
[1:37:33] I lost my mind
[1:37:37] how many are getting into the word sure
[1:37:40] that God takes away our minds and he
[1:37:43] gives us his mind amen
[1:37:47] he should have I lost my mind he said
[1:37:50] just a little bit he said you know he's
[1:37:53] a kind of gone he said why am i
[1:37:55] condemning those women constantly when I
[1:37:57] love them he said I ain't going to pat
[1:38:00] you on the back
[1:38:01] he's a seen he says you are wrong but he
[1:38:05] said he felt like he was losing his mind
[1:38:08] why because of what he was seeing was
[1:38:11] less less and less word and more and
[1:38:14] more world people were getting more and
[1:38:16] more caught up with the world and less
[1:38:18] and less with the world yeah he was
[1:38:21] feeling this even in his own tabernacle
[1:38:23] a man that they weren't catching the
[1:38:26] word that it wasn't striking them the
[1:38:28] way that it should a man and of court
[1:38:30] but again I believe it was striking
[1:38:32] brother around the way it should right
[1:38:33] here in that he was losing his mind amen
[1:38:36] it was it was the evidence said brother
[1:38:38] Brown was really in turning to the
[1:38:40] revelation of what God was doing and
[1:38:42] what God God had done and what the devil
[1:38:44] was doing and what the devil had done a
[1:38:46] man and brother I believe that the bride
[1:38:49] and especially the ministry they also
[1:38:51] feel like they're losing their mind they
[1:38:53] feel that oh they're gone crazy and so
[1:38:57] on and you're wondering well lord what's
[1:39:00] the matter with me is it because of the
[1:39:01] word did I feel like this you should
[1:39:07] understand the ministry oh yeah don't
[1:39:10] just think well they eat just a pastor
[1:39:12] he's just an evangelist he's just they
[1:39:14] see just that no no no no brother we can
[1:39:18] go back to the scriptures and we can
[1:39:19] highlight it yeah and then look at and
[1:39:24] look at Elijah and how Elijah felt oh
[1:39:27] yeah he thought he was losing his mind
[1:39:30] oh no no oh lord this Lord that and and
[1:39:35] God had to deal with the light yet and
[1:39:36] God had to deal with Elijah
[1:39:38] there was other prophets that really
[1:39:39] that were sincere in what they were
[1:39:41] doing what God was doing through them
[1:39:43] amen and they recognized that Israel
[1:39:46] didn't believe Israel wasn't responding
[1:39:48] to the word
[1:39:48] the way they should a man sir brother
[1:39:51] they thought they were losing their mind
[1:39:54] yeah the prophet of God thought he was
[1:39:56] losing his mind and there's time when
[1:39:59] brother Joel fella he's losing his mind
[1:40:01] yeah
[1:40:02] why because jondor a different anointing
[1:40:05] than that then in the congregation oh
[1:40:08] yeah the grace of God brother brother
[1:40:12] what he losing your mind for because of
[1:40:14] what I'm seeing in the world because of
[1:40:17] what I've seen him even among many
[1:40:18] believers you know it's getting less and
[1:40:22] less and less spiritual oh yeah so he
[1:40:26] said he says you see what you are what
[1:40:31] you are by the grace of God and have I
[1:40:32] lost my mind a little bit easier you
[1:40:35] know
[1:40:35] and he said the kind is kind of gone why
[1:40:38] am i can condemning this condemning that
[1:40:40] and he said but I'm he saying I'm not
[1:40:42] going to pat you on the back he say if
[1:40:45] you're wrong and there's a lot of
[1:40:48] preachers want to pat you on the back
[1:40:49] and there's a lot of believers want the
[1:40:51] preacher to pat him on the back no
[1:40:53] brother
[1:40:54] why the father of God again went on
[1:40:56] further into the in later on in this
[1:40:59] message and he highlighted what was
[1:41:01] going on he said he said this is
[1:41:10] smiling time but hinders believers that
[1:41:15] go around joking and carrying on as if
[1:41:17] everything is just don't change oh thank
[1:41:20] you Jesus yeah Jesus looking for you to

[1:45:38] it's Jesus its Christ it is the fullness
[1:45:41] of the Godhead bodily
[1:45:42] amen and no wonder the prophecy the
[1:45:45] fullness of the Godhead body is in the
[1:45:47] bright and he said maybe you don't see
[1:45:52] him with your eyes maybe you don't but
[1:45:54] through vision
[1:45:55] I tell you easier and he said we feel it
[1:45:59] we know there is something here that our
[1:46:01] census doesn't declare and he said it's
[1:46:04] the spirit declares it that Christ is
[1:46:06] here and he said what if it's over and
[1:46:09] he said what if the third pole coming on
[1:46:13] now is to preach to the loss what if
[1:46:15] they said that all the types are going
[1:46:17] to show forth now we're and we're in
[1:46:20] wouldn't that be wonderful what a
[1:46:23] fellowship he said now and he called the
[1:46:27] people to the altar for repentance and
[1:46:31] humility and he said now he said blessed
[1:46:36] be the
[1:46:37] that binds our hearts in Christian love
[1:46:40] the fellowship of kindred mine is like
[1:46:43] to that above and he said not when now
[1:46:46] he said not one smile and he said this
[1:46:49] is not smiling time and he said with a
[1:46:52] deepness of sincerity well that song is
[1:46:55] being played
[1:46:56] he said let's shake hands with somebody
[1:46:58] and say God bless you he said with
[1:47:00] sincerity
[1:47:02] Amen he said I don't know that this
[1:47:07] thing is true but he says got to be that
[1:47:10] way and he said it's got to come to that
[1:47:12] and he said it could be now in every way
[1:47:16] the world will carry on people will
[1:47:19] still come to the altar and they'll
[1:47:20] still cry out but it won't do no good
[1:47:23] God have mercy they'll be gone and it'll
[1:47:28] be over there won't be no mercy remember
[1:47:32] that and the sanctuary becomes smoky and
[1:47:35] he that's filthy is filthy still and he
[1:47:38] that is righteous his righteous still
[1:47:40] and he that is holy is holy still and
[1:47:42] there is no more mercy when the lamb
[1:47:45] takes the book that's it and he said and
[1:47:48] it looks a whole lot like it could be
[1:47:50] now
[1:47:52] amen amen brother
[1:47:56] that's how serious it is so no wonder
[1:48:00] the Prophet felt like he had lost his
[1:48:01] mind
[1:48:02] amen my brother he didn't realize that
[1:48:05] we'd be here over 50 years later amen
[1:48:09] and this brother in the random tavern
[1:48:13] akka live in in the ministry of their
[1:48:15] word that i preached were you the last
[1:48:16] few well two or three months I guess
[1:48:19] and I've earring and see right motive
[1:48:23] right objective doing God a service
[1:48:24] without his will and so on and I've said
[1:48:27] he preached this in Brenham town tract
[1:48:28] he preached that in Brenham tabernac and
[1:48:31] so on and now there's other time when he
[1:48:33] preached in brown chairman Akal and he
[1:48:35] felt that the people weren't into it
[1:48:36] they weren't with it as I said when he
[1:48:39] preached church order and a number of
[1:48:41] people left his church they thought he
[1:48:44] was a prophet believed he was a prophet
[1:48:45] and here they are because he said this
[1:48:47] because he said that they got up and
[1:48:49] left
[1:48:49] and they went to another brothers Church
[1:48:52] why would they leave a promise Church no
[1:48:57] faith
[1:48:57] well I contacted this brother because
[1:49:02] there's been a while since we've been in
[1:49:03] contact and he came back to me yesterday
[1:49:07] and he said brother it is glorious he
[1:49:11] said I have been hearing the tapes of
[1:49:13] brother Branham 50 years and he said I
[1:49:17] fine and he's right he say fine brother
[1:49:23] that we have been missing a lot that's
[1:49:27] right you can hear it physically
[1:49:31] naturally but not spiritually and
[1:49:33] there's many that are hearing the word
[1:49:35] physically unnatural but they're not
[1:49:37] getting the revelation of what the
[1:49:38] prophet is saying and knowing that
[1:49:40] they're reading the books and they're
[1:49:42] reading this and reading that and they
[1:49:44] got the letter of it but not the don't
[1:49:46] not to make dynamics of it the prophet
[1:49:48] of God did say in why Christ speak and
[1:49:51] he said the trouble is you could point
[1:49:53] to more chances on the mechanics and not
[1:49:55] enough on the dynamics amen
[1:49:57] this is going to take the dynamics to
[1:49:59] get us off the air amen
[1:50:01] you've got its got it God got to anoint
[1:50:03] that word by the grace of God you got to
[1:50:06] have the faith calling for that
[1:50:07] anointing amen
[1:50:09] you've got to recognize your need for
[1:50:12] the anointing Lord and without you Lord
[1:50:15] without the anointing Lord this is just
[1:50:16] a dead letter I want you to make it a
[1:50:18] living reality amen and he said brother
[1:50:22] we I've been airing the tapes for
[1:50:24] brother Branham 50 years now and I find
[1:50:27] we have been missing a lot and what's
[1:50:31] the problem well thank God he does have
[1:50:34] somebody there but I'm fabric
[1:50:36] to highlight it and his brother Joseph
[1:50:40] and well the Joseph will get up and
[1:50:43] he'll exhort and then he'll put on the
[1:50:45] tape and then he'll exhort again
[1:50:47] concerning what the Prophet said and I
[1:50:50] said brother
[1:50:51] I've been ministry on a number of
[1:50:52] sermons preached by the Prophet in 1965
[1:50:55] and exhorting you on on whether what
[1:50:59] he's going to say and what he says after
[1:51:01] and so on and apparently this is what
[1:51:03] brother Joseph has been doing and he
[1:51:05] said but he said after fifty years we
[1:51:07] missed this and with this and missed
[1:51:09] this but now he said when he said it
[1:51:13] seems like it's the season now to hear
[1:51:15] and to see it now yeah he's right they
[1:51:19] didn't hear it and see it before your
[1:51:21] ear has seen it now now it's striking
[1:51:24] now I tell you there's certain things
[1:51:26] that the Prophet is said and God well
[1:51:28] God has said to the Prophet it's not not
[1:51:30] william branham it's Christ that that
[1:51:33] was revealed and said that he didn't
[1:51:36] strike probably God said 50 over 50
[1:51:40] years ago and they were 55 years ago he
[1:51:43] said I know it's not striking you the
[1:51:44] way it should he said it's not striking
[1:51:47] me the way it should yeah why guess it
[1:51:51] strike us the way it should it's gotta
[1:51:53] put us in the resurrection and rapture
[1:51:55] praise the Lord it's going to get us out
[1:51:58] of this dimension and into that eternal
[1:52:00] I pray God that it says real to us as it
[1:52:06] was to Jesus amen now we're not looking
[1:52:11] for emotion we're not looking for this
[1:52:13] and looking for that we're looking for
[1:52:14] you and we're looking for a new
[1:52:15] resurrection and we're looking for a
[1:52:17] glorified body yeah
[1:52:21] the young are going to be older and the
[1:52:23] older gonna be young by the grace of God
[1:52:27] and as seeing
[1:52:30] now he says season to hear it and to see
[1:52:32] it now and he said when brother Joseph
[1:52:34] was ministry and he simply takes what
[1:52:37] the Provost said and was what I'm doing
[1:52:40] yeah he simply changed what the Provost
[1:52:43] said and then our eyes come open yeah
[1:52:46] he's reminding them highlighting the
[1:52:49] brother Ram said this or they might have
[1:52:52] heard it but never struck him but now
[1:52:54] he's going back and he's and he's
[1:52:56] highlighting him the head of this
[1:52:57] message I lydian added the other message
[1:52:58] amen
[1:52:59] so that we're gonna see the day in the
[1:53:02] hour of 11:00 and know what God has done
[1:53:05] but know what God is doing and he said
[1:53:08] takes what the Provost said and then our
[1:53:10] eyes come open and he says I am just
[1:53:13] assembly reading and I say yes brother
[1:53:16] we sembly read for 50 years and we never
[1:53:19] seen it before and the message under God
[1:53:21] showed it and where it was and how it
[1:53:24] applies for today he said truly the
[1:53:27] message is the spoken word the original
[1:53:30] seat Amen it is and now it's bringing
[1:53:33] for what it's worth ordained to bring
[1:53:36] forth to give a bride resurrection and
[1:53:38] rock shrimp a previous it was just the
[1:53:42] letter of the word it was just the
[1:53:46] mechanics of the word but now we're
[1:53:48] getting into the dynamics Amen God is
[1:53:52] quickening what the Provost said to make
[1:53:55] it real to us now so that it'll strike
[1:53:57] is the way God wants it to strike us hey
[1:54:00] man
[1:54:01] so he's her brother it's it didn't
[1:54:05] strike us then it's striking us now
[1:54:08] amen and the problem
[1:54:10] said in 1965 and he said we see him he
[1:54:14] said meeting after meeting and sometimes
[1:54:17] we just sit as cold and and indifferent
[1:54:19] yes I know the scripture says it oh I've
[1:54:23] seen it done
[1:54:24] we have no enthusiasm it don't seem to
[1:54:27] strike us right and there's a lot of
[1:54:31] believers dear believers in word only
[1:54:35] but they're not in the not in the Holy
[1:54:38] Ghost it's not striking them right
[1:54:42] because the anointing is not there the
[1:54:45] anointing is on the word but not on the
[1:54:47] person that's right you got to have the
[1:54:50] anointing
[1:54:51] you got the whole Holy Ghost for it to
[1:54:53] strike you right yeah if you got the
[1:54:58] Holy Ghost in your soul and it goes into
[1:55:00] your belly you don't know the matter
[1:55:02] cause days
[1:55:03] it's a rolando we are chillin yeah you
[1:55:11] go into your soul and brother it's gonna
[1:55:15] strike you you go into your soul and you
[1:55:20] move from the natural dimension to a
[1:55:22] spiritual you're not a net you're not
[1:55:25] the summon or the daughter of this this
[1:55:27] parents no no now you're gonna manifest
[1:55:30] your sonship you're the sons and
[1:55:33] daughters of God
[1:55:35] any man who are you I'm the son of God
[1:55:42] you're a daughter of God your sons of
[1:55:44] God yeah Oh too many going living like
[1:55:50] their natural mother and father brother
[1:55:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost changes
[1:55:55] your nature that's right
[1:55:58] why or dad all nature still there in
[1:56:00] your flesh but if you're going to live
[1:56:02] in the spirit and walk in the spirit
[1:56:03] you're gonna do the nature of God you're
[1:56:06] going to manifest the nature of Christ
[1:56:07] oh yeah or the devil is there to try to
[1:56:09] get try to get you to follow the the
[1:56:11] nature of your mom and dad no but the
[1:56:13] Holy Ghost is there to give you power
[1:56:16] over that yeah
[1:56:18] a million sure the nature of Christ has
[1:56:20] got control a man old brother
[1:56:24] there's too many still out there without
[1:56:26] the Holy Ghost and there just mom and
[1:56:28] dad where's Jesus
[1:56:31] oh he's in their head but he's not in
[1:56:34] their heart if he's in your heart you're
[1:56:40] ordained for the rapture the
[1:56:42] resurrection I am that's why the
[1:56:46] probably God knew it wasn't striking
[1:56:48] them right
[1:56:52] he said yes I know
[1:56:57] says that I've seen it done we have no
[1:56:59] enthusiasm and it don't seem to strike
[1:57:02] us right if it struck your right you'd
[1:57:04] be a boost
[1:57:06] you'll be enthused over the resurrection
[1:57:08] enthuse concerning the rapture you'll be
[1:57:10] put and listen as parents you'll be
[1:57:11] putting your children to it point your
[1:57:13] grandchildren to it
[1:57:14] Amen why you want to get them out of
[1:57:17] time and into eternity to grace of God
[1:57:22] he said they don't seem to be something
[1:57:27] like if you had enthusiasm taking a
[1:57:32] match he said and striking it if the
[1:57:35] match hasn't got the sulfur right on the
[1:57:37] head of the match it cannot strike
[1:57:39] that's right and you can rake and rake
[1:57:42] and rake but if some chemical has killed
[1:57:45] the sulfur it will not strike that's
[1:57:48] right again you know what it is to take
[1:57:50] a match we were used to that as new foes
[1:57:53] that older no peace because we were used
[1:57:56] to their on the box of matches and we
[1:57:59] take it out and and their lights to
[1:58:01] match amen but the probably God said if
[1:58:05] the sulfur is gone from the side of the
[1:58:09] box
[1:58:09] you can scratch it and scratch and
[1:58:11] scratch it and it won't like that's
[1:58:14] right and you can scratch it and scratch
[1:58:17] and scratch it and I don't lady in your
[1:58:20] heart and so make sure the sulfur is
[1:58:25] there don't let the word I'll take it
[1:58:28] out
[1:58:29] amen so he said
[1:58:32] taking a mattress striking it and if the
[1:58:34] match hasn't got the sulfur rate on the
[1:58:36] edge of the match he cannot strike and
[1:58:39] you can rake and rake and rake and if
[1:58:41] some chemical has killed the sulfur it
[1:58:43] will not strike there'll be no light
[1:58:46] brother pray the grace of God that the
[1:58:48] sulfur is on the match in your life and
[1:58:51] when God scrapes it down on the word
[1:58:53] oh you late you become a light praise
[1:58:58] the Lord hallelujah you're going to
[1:59:01] reflect the light so you shouldn't
[1:59:05] the true genuine vindication of the
[1:59:08] Scriptures of this last day message and
[1:59:12] he said you see the presence of Jesus
[1:59:14] Christ and that you had heard what he
[1:59:17] done in his life and hearing the
[1:59:19] scripture say east the same yesterday
[1:59:20] today and forever and just before the
[1:59:25] Sodom condition is fired over with the
[1:59:28] wrath of God
[1:59:29] you see Jesus return amongst his people
[1:59:32] formed in human flesh and do the same
[1:59:35] thing he'd done my it ought to strike
[1:59:39] our souls to glory and it ought to do
[1:59:41] something to us it's dropping on that
[1:59:46] so is it striking you is the word
[1:59:49] striking you the way that it should
[1:59:51] you know sometimes preachers stir the
[1:59:56] people up because of the way they preach
[1:59:59] my brother if you have the Holy goes
[2:00:04] it's not the way the preacher preaches
[2:00:07] is what he preaches yeah it's what he

[2:01:06] yeah of his eternal life you've got the
[2:01:07] nature of eternal life amen
[2:01:11] bear with me my again probably God said
[2:01:25] he said what did they do they didn't
[2:01:28] know it today men walk ignorant li and
[2:01:31] they don't know that it that's the truth
[2:01:34] they think it's some kind of a his 'm
[2:01:37] they don't dig down deep enough easier
[2:01:40] to get into the spirit of Revelation not
[2:01:44] knowledge a lot of people are just
[2:01:47] receiving knowledge it's the left the
[2:01:51] literal word coming into their heads but
[2:01:53] no you're beyond that hey hallelujah
[2:01:57] praise the Lord this is not controlling
[2:01:59] you
[2:01:59] you're not listening to me with this
[2:02:01] you're listening to me with this it is
[2:02:04] the ear of the soul not the not the ears
[2:02:07] I preached how that okay it's not your
[2:02:11] ears
[2:02:11] it's your ear a man but too many are
[2:02:14] just hearing with this I salt it is
[2:02:17] becomes intellectual but there's a few
[2:02:19] that will hear by the soul praise the
[2:02:23] Lord what yeah only God God knows God
[2:02:26] knows who's hearing him in your hearts
[2:02:30] Amen oh yeah

[2:02:34] and you gloat somebody said I heard this
[2:02:37] you what I didn't know that well maybe
[2:02:41] that other person was hearing by the
[2:02:42] soul and the other person was there you
[2:02:44] by the head
[2:02:46] you don't get you don't get the great
[2:02:48] revelation as you need it this is
[2:02:52] serious this serious
[2:02:54] no wonder the Bible tells us to make
[2:02:57] your calling and election sure oh yeah
[2:03:00] you believe you're called you believe
[2:03:01] you're elected you better make it sure
[2:03:04] hey man and it says they don't dig down
[2:03:09] deep enough to get into the spirit of
[2:03:11] Revelation and they don't pray enough
[2:03:14] they don't call upon God enough they
[2:03:16] just lately take it oh well I believe
[2:03:20] there's a god sure the devil believes
[2:03:22] the same thing and the devil believes it
[2:03:24] more than some people claim to believe
[2:03:26] it the devil believes that in Trimble's
[2:03:28] people believe it and go on and that's
[2:03:31] the truth there's a lot a lot of
[2:03:33] believers say they don't have that fear
[2:03:34] of God no no no they'd like to be
[2:03:38] settied they believe in one you know I
[2:03:40] believe I believe I believe he was a
[2:03:42] prophet
[2:03:42] I believe God did this I believe God did
[2:03:44] that yeah the devil believes it too and
[2:03:46] he come down with great wrath knowing
[2:03:48] his time is short look at the faith they
[2:03:51] give the devil and while faith isn't
[2:03:54] giving the believers it changed the
[2:03:58] devil's life
[2:03:59] it changed the devil attitude oh it just
[2:04:04] justice increased him and build them up
[2:04:06] build them up build up my is anger and
[2:04:10] his fear and everything got got got got
[2:04:12] greater and greater and greater
[2:04:14] what are it to do to you and me hey man
[2:04:18] if the devil knows this time is short
[2:04:21] well praise the Lord we know our time is
[2:04:23] not short our time is getting long we're
[2:04:26] going from time to eternity hey man the
[2:04:31] devil knows he's reaching the hour of
[2:04:33] judgment but the bride ought to
[2:04:35] recognize grace and look up he said the
[2:04:40] devil believes the same thing and he
[2:04:42] believes him more than what some people
[2:04:44] claim to believe it he said the devil
[2:04:46] believes and trembles people believe it
[2:04:48] and just go on and that's true lot of
[2:04:50] Ebers are just going on but he said the
[2:04:53] devil trembles oh my amazing there's so
[2:04:58] many believers you know they feel or I
[2:05:01] mean the message I believe the message
[2:05:05] and that's fear that that's all that's
[2:05:06] all but the prophet of God said but he
[2:05:09] said then he said the message is got to
[2:05:11] be in you he said there's a lot believe
[2:05:13] in the message but their message is not
[2:05:15] in them that's the truth and I have over
[2:05:19] the years I've met a lot of believers oh
[2:05:21] I'm in the message I'm in the message
[2:05:22] yeah but I new message is not in there
[2:05:25] and I see by their actions I see by
[2:05:28] their reactions and their spirit and
[2:05:30] their attitude message is not in know
[2:05:33] because if the messages and the crises
[2:05:36] in and if crisis then they're going to
[2:05:39] have a the spirit and attitude of Christ
[2:05:42] amen Eastern the devil
[2:05:49] knowing his judgement is coming but with
[2:05:52] the bride
[2:05:53] knowing the resurrections here and the
[2:05:56] rapture and people believe it and don't
[2:06:00] pay no attention that judgment is coming
[2:06:03] but it's here now in other places that
[2:06:07] he does say it's here now we're in the
[2:06:09] object he said guilty of crucifying him
[2:06:14] sure I indict this generation finding
[2:06:18] them guilty by the same word that found
[2:06:20] them guilty at the beginning and Jesus
[2:06:22] said who can condemn me he was the Word
[2:06:25] made flesh and today the same word is
[2:06:27] made flesh and it is he said just keep
[2:06:32] praying keep digging he said yeah he
[2:06:35] said don't stop just like when Elijah
[2:06:37] told them dig ditches out there and when
[2:06:40] you get down he said you can hit an old
[2:06:42] tin can and say I am too tired throw it
[2:06:46] out of the way and keep digging and he
[2:06:48] said just keep digging because we've got
[2:06:50] to dig and he said we've got to dig and
[2:06:54] he said because they said if you expect
[2:06:56] to miss the Tribulation
[2:06:58] you better start digging amen and for
[2:07:02] myself I'm preaching to myself there I'm
[2:07:04] going to start digging deeper than I
[2:07:07] ever dug and then remember he said in
[2:07:11] Hebrews it says faith is the substance
[2:07:12] of things hoped for and here's where
[2:07:15] many people fail to receive their
[2:07:17] healing and he said what they're asking
[2:07:20] for because they take faith to be
[2:07:22] something that it is not but faith is
[2:07:25] not that you will be healed you are
[2:07:28] healed
[2:07:28] faith is all past tense amen and he said
[2:07:33] because they take faith to be something
[2:07:35] that it is not they don't believe it and
[2:07:37] it's amidst it's not imagination it is
[2:07:40] actual substance amen now he said this
[2:07:48] close this is not what you imagine it's
[2:07:55] just this realist you as any sense of
[2:07:57] your body would declare anything else
[2:07:59] and he says just as real as my eyes say
[2:08:02] this is a piece of paper it's just as
[2:08:05] real as to say that that is a light it's
[2:08:07] just as real to say I feel my coat so is
[2:08:11] her faith that real what you're
[2:08:13] believing for your healing you're
[2:08:17] believing for this believe that it was
[2:08:18] that is the realistic coat you got on
[2:08:20] there the sweater you got on is it as
[2:08:23] real as the seeker said he need you're
[2:08:26] afraid to see it it's gonna disappear
[2:08:29] you'll end up on the floor yeah well
[2:08:34] that that's the same way faith is it's
[2:08:37] just as real yeah as the garment you're
[2:08:42] wearing just as real as the seat you're
[2:08:44] sitting on the floor you're standing on
[2:08:45] oh yeah
[2:08:47] just as real but how many believe in
[2:08:51] that kind of a thing god help us he said
[2:08:55] you have it alone it's yours faith is
[2:08:59] the substance not a myth now he said
[2:09:04] these are real D blessings and I'll
[2:09:06] catch the top of it and then you deep
[2:09:08] down amen
[2:09:18] opinion the last member will be caught
[2:09:25] up one of these days are you caught up
[2:09:29] if you're caught up in the revelation
[2:09:31] you're you're caught up in the power and
[2:09:33] the anointing of the rapture oh yeah in
[2:09:35] the resurrection
[2:09:37] so you said are you the last member will
[2:09:41] be caught up one of these days it might
[2:09:43] come and you wouldn't know about it
[2:09:45] it's a secret secret catching away and
[2:09:48] you'll come an hour that you think not
[2:09:50] and you won't know nothing about it
[2:09:52] she'll be gone and it'd be too late then
[2:09:55] I trust brother's not too late for us
[2:09:59] you're at the end now and he said I know
[2:10:06] everything is fulfilled ready for the
[2:10:08] rapture the church has called out and
[2:10:11] it'll be a secret going just vanished
[2:10:14] that'll be all he said the world will go
[2:10:17] right on just the same people preaching
[2:10:19] people thinking that they are getting
[2:10:21] saved but they're not that's right he
[2:10:28] said think of it there'll be eternally
[2:10:30] lost but think they're saved God have
[2:10:34] mercy on us grace I'll have to leave it
[2:10:41] there
[2:10:42] amen and brother it is as the prophet
[2:10:47] has already said we're living in a scary
[2:10:49] time and it is but it produces
[2:10:55] the revelation producing us the fear of
[2:10:57] God and the fear of God is there to get
[2:11:00] us to look up brother - what for it is

[3:17:18] amen that's that's a that's a tremendous
[3:17:21] thing to see and again he lives in us
[3:17:25] because of what he did because of the
[3:17:27] price that he paid to remember first of
[3:17:29] all take away your sin amen
[3:17:31] put it in the sea of forgetfulness amen
[3:17:35] so he comes into you into your heart
[3:17:37] into your soul not your flesh don't
[3:17:40] don't don't focus on the flesh the
[3:17:42] prophet of God speaks here concerning
[3:17:44] false anointed ones he said their
[3:17:47] anointed but he said their anointed in
[3:17:49] their flesh but not in their souls and
[3:17:52] he said because they have anointing in
[3:17:55] their flesh
[3:17:55] they'll deceive meant David they say
[3:17:57] many and they even to the even to the
[3:18:00] very elective if it were possible so
[3:18:02] brother list let's go by the anointing
[3:18:04] in our souls and if it's in your soul
[3:18:07] it'll come back to the word amen it'll
[3:18:10] always focus on the word and always
[3:18:12] focus on what God has done is doing and
[3:18:15] will do amen
[3:18:17] but you'll certainly recognize what he's
[3:18:18] doing and the thing of it is today the
[3:18:21] false anointed ones they have a ninety
[3:18:23] in their flesh and as the prophet of God
[3:18:27] said you could have the anointing in
[3:18:28] your flesh and going to hell you know
[3:18:30] because it's not in your soul if you got
[3:18:32] it in your soul it'd take you back to
[3:18:34] the word if it's in your flesh you take
[3:18:36] you back to what God has done and maybe
[3:18:39] what God will do but he's ignoring what
[3:18:43] God is doing that's right so we pray the
[3:18:46] grace of God and again well the ground
[3:18:48] brings that out in the message I have
[3:18:49] heard but now I see what are you hearing
[3:18:52] and what do you see no is it is this
[3:18:55] problem the soul or is it from just just
[3:18:57] just in the flesh
[3:18:58] and there's many there was there's not
[3:19:01] so much after now there was the nineteen
[3:19:04] one time in a lot of preachers
[3:19:08] evangelism they had anointing outwardly
[3:19:10] but never edited in their hearts because
[3:19:13] they denied their prophets message they
[3:19:16] denied the proc they did they loved his
[3:19:19] sign in his hand and the discernment and
[3:19:22] all that but and they wanted more of it
[3:19:25] more of it more of it but eventually the
[3:19:28] angel tour of the grounds of stop
[3:19:30] because there they were leaning on the
[3:19:32] signpost and the people were just
[3:19:34] focusing on this preacher that preacher
[3:19:36] that preacher just what they had that
[3:19:38] anointing to do this to do that and and
[3:19:41] God allowed it God permitted it to help
[3:19:43] the people to do this to do that that's
[3:19:45] the love of God but again you can be
[3:19:50] healed and go to hell but you could
[3:19:52] always gotta check check it check it
[3:19:54] with the word check it with the word
[3:19:55] check it with the word see like the
[3:19:57] prophet of God like I said I was this
[3:19:58] tremendous for me when I read that quote
[3:20:01] about people brother Browns question he
[3:20:04] why do you want to be healed well I said
[3:20:08] why because they're sick and and I say
[3:20:13] the best majority of the of those that
[3:20:16] were part of the healing revival back
[3:20:18] years ago that's why they wanted to be
[3:20:21] healed because they were see and well
[3:20:23] Jesus will heal and he already healed me
[3:20:26] so I'm gonna go to I'll go to or brother
[3:20:28] Roberts I'll go to brother to Osborne
[3:20:30] Dyke or this just preacher brother
[3:20:32] branham and they'll pray for me and I'll
[3:20:35] be healed and well I long yeah but the
[3:20:38] public God says why do you want to be
[3:20:39] you you gotta have a right motive and a
[3:20:41] right objective he said even for healing
[3:20:44] I was surprised he said you got it
[3:20:47] wanted for the glory of God if you wanna
[3:20:51] for the glory of God you'll be healed
[3:20:52] and you leave it with the Lord and you
[3:20:55] give God the glory and and you go closer
[3:20:58] to him not go on and be religious but
[3:21:02] you'll get closer to the Lord and be
[3:21:03] spiritual amen
[3:21:05] so you give God the glory no matter what
[3:21:08] it is give God the glory
[3:21:09] too often the people experience the
[3:21:11] anointing
[3:21:12] is this this but was only in their flesh
[3:21:15] and they didn't come back to the word
[3:21:18] the word the word no just signs and
[3:21:20] wonders and the prophet of God brings it
[3:21:23] out here he said that he said remember
[3:21:26] he said false Christ we think there we
[3:21:31] think already got it Falls of 92 no he
[3:21:33] said they got a true anointing place of
[3:21:35] false teaching
[3:21:36] he said they want to come back to the
[3:21:39] word he said they want the anointing of
[3:21:41] God but not the Word of God now see they
[3:21:44] don't think that's necessary they think
[3:21:45] God is love so God don't want mind if I
[3:21:47] do this go on my I do that thought amen
[3:21:51] but they're going to stay rejected the
[3:21:53] message that told him no repent you know
[3:21:57] no what they felt they didn't have to
[3:21:59] repent yeah but the problem God was
[3:22:02] there to expound to them repent repent
[3:22:04] repent amen come back to the word come
[3:22:06] back to the word amen so he said they're
[3:22:09] false Christ's false anointed ones but
[3:22:12] again it's not a false in 19 he's
[3:22:14] bringing that out some do have false or
[3:22:16] 90s but there's others that don't have a
[3:22:18] false night they should deceive the very
[3:22:19] elect if possible a very elect it had to
[3:22:24] be a spiritual anointing to de-seed the
[3:22:27] very elect if possible well why is it
[3:22:29] they want to see the real it cuz they
[3:22:30] like come back to the word amen
[3:22:33] they want the word not just religion but
[3:22:36] they want the word so thank God for for
[3:22:38] understanding thank God for revelation
[3:22:41] amen thank God that he's there amen to
[3:22:45] keep us on our guard it's there to keep
[3:22:48] what to make our calling that election
[3:22:50] sure amen
[3:22:51] chose to make sure you got a lot of ever
[3:22:55] you got to come back to the word it's
[3:22:57] the word it's the word we made in our
[3:23:00] hearts by the grace of God that we might
[3:23:03] not sin against him so and that's why
[3:23:07] God's looking for in your life is the
[3:23:09] word is that's not he's anointing no no
[3:23:12] he took him for his word so that he can
[3:23:15] not just use you to do this use you to
[3:23:17] do that he wants you to use you to
[3:23:19] witness for the word amen they are that
[3:23:22] we're living what God is doing now what
