[37:01] these things Lord we pray a special
[37:03] Grace to them each one Heavenly Father
[37:05] Lord but trusting your presence to be
[37:06] amongst us once again Lord Just Have
[37:09] Your Way in this service we ask in Jesus
[37:11] Christ's name amen man God bless you
[37:14] turn if you would to Second Peter
[37:16] chapter 1 once again amen certainly
[37:19] appreciate having our deacons back from
[37:21] a successful hunting trip appreciate
[37:23] brother Dale stepping up to help out
[37:25] while they were gone kind of holding the
[37:27] fort amen glad to have able-bodied
[37:29] people here that can do that and
[37:31] certainly appreciate brother Paul taking
[37:33] the service on Wednesday and had some
[37:35] good feedback on it and I was able to
[37:36] listen in for most of it so thankful for
[37:39] that amen I also met with Brother Carmen
[37:42] Mills while I was in New Brunswick and
[37:44] and so looking forward to maybe having
[37:45] him come up uh later this year or maybe
[37:48] next year sometime but uh good to
[37:50] connect with him after 20 years of not
[37:52] seen him so it's good to see God
[37:54] blessing them there and then spoke with
[37:56] brother David Nash also this week and
[37:58] he's excited to come up here he'll
[37:59] arrive late Thursday night and of course
[38:01] we've got Services Friday Saturday and
[38:03] Sunday and he doesn't leave till Tuesday
[38:05] afternoon but just praying that the Lord
[38:07] will bless us in that keep them in
[38:09] prayer amen we've got a a missionary
[38:11] gift coming and that's one thing I don't
[38:12] think we've had here yet I guess brother
[38:14] George Smith would maybe be called a bit
[38:15] of a missionary but I'm just praying
[38:17] that the Lord will bless us amen with
[38:19] what he comes to bring and the stories
[38:20] and the testimonies of how we've
[38:22] supported it we can't all be preachers
[38:24] and we certainly can't all be
[38:25] missionaries but we can put our shoulder
[38:27] to the wheel amen and we can support men
[38:29] that that go out and do those things and
[38:30] it's attributed to us not just to them
[38:33] amen but those that support get the same
[38:35] reward as the one that goes in and does
[38:36] the work so we're thankful for that amen
[38:40] certainly want to remember those that
[38:41] aren't here brother Chad and brother
[38:42] Grant and sister Morin and those
[38:44] different ones brother Kingsley just
[38:45] praying the Lord will be with them amen
[38:48] second Peter 1 ver4 says whereby are
[38:50] given unto us exceeding great and
[38:52] precious promises that by these you
[38:54] might be partakers of the Divine nature
[38:57] having escaped the corruption that is in
[38:59] the world through lust and beside this
[39:01] giving all diligence add to your faith
[39:03] virtue to Virtue knowledge and to
[39:06] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[39:07] patience and to patience godliness and
[39:10] to Godliness brotherly kindness amen God
[39:12] bless you you may have your seats this
[39:14] morning and as you can imagine we're
[39:16] continuing our series on manifesting
[39:19] time and we're going to be speaking on
[39:20] brotherly kindness Tom morning but I
[39:21] want to have a title of a higher
[39:24] kindness and before we go into this you
[39:26] know it's it's interesting as you if
[39:28] you've ever listened to or read the
[39:30] message statue of a perfect man some of
[39:31] these attributes brother Bram spends
[39:33] very little time on it on brotherly
[39:34] kindness he gives us two paragraphs and
[39:37] that's it and I'm supposed to make a
[39:38] service out of two paragraphs but we're
[39:40] going to do it amen by God's grace this
[39:41] morning but you know I wanted to kind of
[39:44] have a bit of a just a preamble this
[39:46] morning on these things and talking with
[39:48] different ones you know as we're
[39:49] preaching these attributes they're great
[39:52] attributes and they're Christian
[39:53] attributes and the expectation is that
[39:55] it's in each and every every one of us
[39:57] and the simple fact is it is in every
[39:58] one of us whether we believe it or not
[40:00] it's in there because we're children of
[40:01] God and those those attributes those
[40:03] Natures are in there and yet when we
[40:05] preach these because remember as brother
[40:07] Brandon preaches these he doesn't preach
[40:08] them at the low level he preaches them
[40:09] at the high level he preaches them at
[40:11] the peak he shows what the epitome what
[40:13] the the the Mastery of of this attribute
[40:16] would look like and we look at those
[40:18] things and like I I said a couple
[40:19] Services ago it's hard to preach about
[40:21] Joseph and Abraham and these different
[40:23] ones that had faith for decades before
[40:25] the promise came through because we can
[40:26] look at these things and we think well I
[40:28] can't even go a week and yet you're
[40:30] preaching about 25 years of waiting
[40:32] around for the promise of God but you
[40:34] know it can be daunting and and we can
[40:36] look at these things and say honestly I
[40:38] don't have it yet I don't maybe have
[40:40] what Abraham had I don't have what
[40:42] Joseph had or Daniel had or or these
[40:44] different ones and I say join the crowd
[40:47] join the crowd because amen we're
[40:49] preaching these at the Pinnacle but
[40:51] don't think that for a second you don't
[40:52] have it because you don't have
[40:53] necessarily what Abraham did or these
[40:55] different ones amen but the proving of
[40:58] you having these is done at the level
[40:59] where you're at and that's more the
[41:01] point I want to make if if you're just a
[41:03] young person and you're going to school
[41:05] then your trial of patience is different
[41:07] than your mom and dad's trial of
[41:08] patience is different than the elders
[41:10] trial of patience because this is a
[41:12] process remember we're going through
[41:13] Redemption we're going through something
[41:15] that's bringing us back to what we were
[41:17] in the eyes of God and so all these
[41:19] things are going on through your entire
[41:21] life you don't just get Faith once and
[41:23] then that's it but you get Faith on top
[41:25] of faith and you get patience on top of
[41:27] patience and you get virtue on top of
[41:29] virtue and these things grow and it's
[41:31] the work of the Lord throughout your
[41:32] entire life that's going to bring out
[41:34] the the the full manifestation of the
[41:36] attributes of God in your life and we'll
[41:38] see that even you can't have the full
[41:40] attributes until you get the Holy Ghost
[41:42] and that's really where we go on the
[41:43] next one but but you don't just have
[41:46] enough patience and enough faith and
[41:47] virtue to get you to the Holy Ghost
[41:49] because we look at the Holy Ghost as the
[41:51] be all and end all but I've said this
[41:53] before that getting the Holy Ghost is
[41:54] really the start of your true Christian
[41:56] walk and impact all of these things that
[41:59] we're doing now they're because you're a
[42:01] child of God but when you get the Holy
[42:02] Ghost that's power for service amen and
[42:05] it's supposed to do more than just
[42:06] develop you now but it's to help develop
[42:08] others it's to help make you more
[42:10] effective in the in in the kingdom of
[42:12] God and we've preached before how in
[42:14] Acts 2 you know they're in the upper
[42:15] room and the Holy Ghost comes down and
[42:17] they get that infilling of the Holy
[42:18] Ghost and two chapters later in Acts 4
[42:21] they get a greater infilling than they
[42:23] had before and what was it it was so
[42:26] that they could continue in service so
[42:28] that they would have the courage so that
[42:29] they would have the strength to go on
[42:31] and continue to do what Christ had told
[42:33] them to do brother B will put it this
[42:36] way he says we should be
[42:39] unfolding we don't look at unfolding the
[42:42] same way they used to but remember in
[42:44] the old days you had Scrolls and and
[42:46] when you would unfold a scroll you would
[42:48] unroll it a bit and you'd read that
[42:49] portion and then you'd roll up the next
[42:51] bit and unroll the next bit and you'd
[42:53] see more and then you go more and more
[42:55] and more he says we're supposed to be
[42:56] like those Scrolls just a constant
[42:58] unfolding a constant revealing of what's
[43:01] written in our lives of the The Godly
[43:03] DNA if I could put it that way that's
[43:05] inside of us but this is a continuous
[43:07] revealing and it's the holy spirit's
[43:09] work inside of us he says we should be
[43:12] unfolding God's spirit pouring out not
[43:15] just pouring out on you but God's spirit
[43:17] pouring out from you so that you can
[43:20] have an effect on those that are around
[43:21] you to bring them to the same gospel
[43:23] that you've received he says not just
[43:25] one little user not one little baptism
[43:28] but baptism after baptism not a
[43:30] revelation of the just shall live by
[43:32] faith or sanctification of the gifts of
[43:33] the Spirit but revelation after
[43:36] Revelation power after power glory after
[43:39] Glory he says why we ought to be way up
[43:41] the road ready for the translation and
[43:43] we're lingering back down in the old
[43:45] things and saying well he says we keep
[43:47] going back he says let's go
[43:50] forward I love it when people come to me
[43:53] and they tell me what God's doing rather
[43:55] than what God did you know why that
[43:58] shows that they're growing it shows that
[44:00] they're maturing it shows that they're
[44:01] stepping into this that there's a
[44:03] revelation after Revelation there's a
[44:04] glory after Glory line upon line word
[44:07] upon word is being built up in their
[44:09] life I've said it before it doesn't have
[44:11] as much impact today because our ships
[44:13] aren't D don't you sail so much but a a
[44:15] ship doesn't Sail on yesterday's wind
[44:17] and a Christian doesn't grow on
[44:19] yesterday's experience we build on it
[44:22] but that is not our growth we have to
[44:24] grow day by day and it's a Contin ous
[44:26] working of God in our lives that's doing
[44:28] this so we need new revelation we need
[44:30] new molding we need new shaping we need
[44:32] new sanctification we need God working
[44:35] daily in our lives we need a greater
[44:37] experience in the Holy Ghost every
[44:38] single day we need a greater experience
[44:41] in the word I love how I can read my
[44:44] Bible and it is something new every
[44:46] single day something every single day
[44:49] brother Brandon would continue he says
[44:51] but if you constantly they lay there
[44:53] before God all the time
[44:57] not just Sundays not just in services
[44:59] not just when you get a moment but every
[45:01] day all the time he says with baptism
[45:04] after baptism striking you something's
[45:07] got to take
[45:09] place brother Brown was talking about
[45:11] speaking in tongues in this this actual
[45:13] place and he was saying don't stop there
[45:16] don't stop with speaking in tongues
[45:17] because so remember so many of the
[45:19] Pentecostals all they wanted to do was
[45:20] speak in tongues because that was their
[45:22] evidence he says no you got to go on
[45:24] from that that's not the be all and end
[45:26] all and it's the same in this message
[45:28] where you're accepting a prophet of
[45:30] Malachi 4 and and and knowing that a
[45:32] message is here is not it you've got to
[45:34] move on from that and you've got to
[45:36] receive the person of the message you've
[45:37] got to receive the life of the message
[45:39] you've got to meet the god that sent the
[45:41] messenger because he says behold I sent
[45:43] you Elijah the prophet the key is that
[45:46] he sent him not who he sent he's trying
[45:48] to get you to see who God is amen so
[45:50] we've got to move on day by day by day
[45:54] and so I don't want you to be listening
[45:55] to these Services we preached on the
[45:57] Statue of a perfect man and just walk
[45:59] away dejected because brother John's
[46:00] preaching on something that I don't have
[46:02] brother John's preaching on some things
[46:03] that he doesn't have and it's okay
[46:07] because it's up to God to draw out of me
[46:09] what he needs and it's up to God to put
[46:11] in what I need as well that's a work of
[46:14] his hands that's doing these things we
[46:15] look at Abraham Abraham was a man of
[46:17] great patience and a man of great faith
[46:19] and yet Abraham was subject to emotion
[46:22] he was subject to to Family Ties and
[46:24] that's what held him back for a while do
[46:26] you know the promise was held back
[46:28] perhaps from Abraham because he didn't
[46:29] separate himself as quickly maybe if he
[46:32] separated quickly he might have got it
[46:33] more quickly I don't know the scriptures
[46:35] silent on it but some of this was
[46:36] Abraham literally holding back things
[46:38] because of his own Humanity because of
[46:40] his own relationships his wife got him
[46:42] off the path many times told him what to
[46:45] do and and it went against what God had
[46:47] told him was going to happen and then
[46:49] Abraham gets caught up in circumstances
[46:50] and he becomes a liar a half
[46:53] liar right half Li are still a
[46:57] liar but but but don't look at it and
[46:59] just say well Abraham was a man of great
[47:00] faith but recognize there's Humanity
[47:02] Blended in this remember he says that
[47:04] Elijah was and Elisha were men of like
[47:06] passions as we
[47:08] were so there's got to be growth through
[47:11] all of these things amen I'm not giving
[47:13] that us a license now to just do
[47:15] whatever we want and and just stay where
[47:17] we are but I'm saying it's a growth
[47:19] that's happening it's a maturing that's
[47:20] happening and these these things so but
[47:23] the thing you'll notice with a child of
[47:24] God is when push comes to shove they
[47:27] make the right decision and it's
[47:29] attributed to Abraham for righteousness
[47:31] and it's the same thing for us because
[47:32] through the blood he doesn't see our
[47:34] faults he only sees our faith and that's
[47:36] a beautiful thing that we get and that's
[47:38] only available now under the New
[47:40] Covenant under the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:42] but brother watch how he says this he
[47:44] says a man says I can't live the life he
[47:48] says that little girl the other day that
[47:49] was converted she said I can't live it
[47:53] he said that was reasoning reasoning
[47:56] looks in here rather than up here it
[48:00] looks in here rather than in
[48:03] here and he says that little girl that
[48:05] said I can't live it he says that was
[48:07] reasoning but when it struck her soul
[48:10] something became a reality then brother
[48:12] van would say time and time again when
[48:14] that light of the word strikes your soul
[48:16] it quickens it and all of a sudden it
[48:18] starts to grow but until you get a
[48:20] personal revelation of Christ nothing's
[48:23] going to grow and you can't live it and
[48:25] you won't live it and you'll frustrate
[48:27] yourself if you think you
[48:29] can he says it's not reasoning anymore
[48:31] it's taking God at his word amen notice
[48:34] when you get reasonings Cast Away the
[48:37] soul will answer clear that's why I
[48:40] can't convince you into this and I can't
[48:42] convince you out of it it's because
[48:43] you've heard a voice and that's the
[48:45] voice you're listening to and that's the
[48:46] voice you're responding to and if I can
[48:48] get your eyes on God if I can get your
[48:50] eyes on his word on his promise and
[48:53] that'll solidify you in every aspect of
[48:55] of your life as you bring it subject to
[48:57] that word amen I said it before I'll
[48:59] repeat it until the day I day day I die
[49:02] the simplest thing you can do as a
[49:03] Christian is read your Bible every
[49:05] single
[49:07] day some of us read differently you know
[49:09] I was talking to a brother a while ago
[49:11] and he said I just read the same verse
[49:14] or the same chapter over and over again
[49:16] until I feel like I've got it that's
[49:18] okay there's no law behind how we do it
[49:21] I like to read a chapter across four
[49:22] different places every single day but
[49:25] the key is to get something out of what
[49:27] you're reading and what I do is I write
[49:29] it down in a book and that's the thing
[49:31] that I take with me for that day and you
[49:33] meditate on it and you grab onto it and
[49:35] you dwell on it and you apply it until
[49:37] it anchors in your soul and what happens
[49:40] is it starts to change your attitude it
[49:42] starts to change your approach it starts
[49:43] to change your reaction to life and all
[49:46] of a sudden you realize I'm maturing I'm
[49:49] growing and it's just from the
[49:51] Simplicity of reading your Bible just
[49:54] something so simple amen amen but God
[49:57] will test us now at the level he'll
[49:59] prove us at the level that we're at and
[50:01] if you're capable of a harder test he'll
[50:03] give it I remember when I was in
[50:05] elementary school and I was pretty bored
[50:07] and so they started giving me higher
[50:09] level classes to test me at a higher
[50:11] level and all of a sudden I wasn't
[50:13] getting everything right I was making
[50:14] mistakes but they knew that I was
[50:16] capable of doing more and so they tested
[50:18] me at a higher level to do it and here's
[50:20] the thing God knows where you're at
[50:22] better than you do you're his child
[50:24] remember he's getting a a a tutor that
[50:26] talks back to him and lets him know
[50:28] what's going on and so he'll test you at
[50:30] the level where you're at and he's the
[50:32] one that knows where you're at man you
[50:35] you look at at something like the the
[50:36] three Hebrew children and they were only
[50:38] in their teens as far as we know and he
[50:41] brings them to the fiery furnace trial
[50:43] they didn't know perhaps how much Faith
[50:45] they had until they got in the trial but
[50:48] all of a sudden they're in the trial and
[50:49] their faith is not wavering and there's
[50:51] they're not backing off but they're
[50:53] walking towards final judgment on this
[50:55] Earth and yet something keeps holding
[50:58] them and something keeps pushing them
[50:59] and then they realize we've got this
[51:02] this is a part of me I can't turn back
[51:05] there's something inside of me and they
[51:07] realized they were passing the test no
[51:09] doubt and it proved what they had and
[51:10] like I've said before I don't believe
[51:12] you could ever scare the Hebrew children
[51:13] after that if there was any fear in them
[51:16] it went out when they went into a fire
[51:17] and came out with the only thing being
[51:18] destroyed with their bonds and having an
[51:21] experience with the Son of
[51:22] God Paul would say this as a comfort and
[51:25] 1 Corinthians 10 he says there hath no
[51:27] temptation taken you but such as is
[51:30] common to men you know what that means
[51:32] it means you haven't gone through
[51:34] anything that no one else hasn't gone
[51:35] through that others have gone through it
[51:38] before you he says but God is faithful
[51:41] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[51:43] above that ye are able that means he's
[51:47] not going to give you a test that you
[51:48] can't pass he's not going to put you
[51:50] through a trial that you can't survive
[51:52] he's not going to put you in a hole that
[51:54] you can't get out of he says he but but
[51:56] he but will with the Temptation also
[51:59] make a way to escape that you may be
[52:01] able to Bear it now if you take his way
[52:03] you can bear it if you take your way
[52:05] you'll fail and the key is to recognize
[52:07] what his way is rather than what your
[52:09] way is now I read this these next two
[52:12] scriptures a while back but before we
[52:14] get to our real message this morning I
[52:15] wanted to just fit it in here as we're
[52:17] doing this little short short beginning
[52:19] here on on settling us a bit and Paul
[52:22] said this for when we were come to
[52:23] Macedonia our flag had no rest you ever
[52:27] had a month or a week or a year seems
[52:30] like every seven years almost you get
[52:32] one of those
[52:34] years and it's just like nothing goes
[52:37] right well Macedonia was Paul's
[52:40] experience of that he says our flesh had
[52:42] no
[52:43] rest maybe they were sick maybe they
[52:45] were tired maybe they were getting
[52:46] chased out of every town stressed out
[52:48] nobody was whatever it was he says we
[52:51] had no rest but we were troubled on
[52:53] every side without we're fightings
[52:57] within we're fears things going on
[52:59] around us things going on inside of us
[53:01] fightings
[53:03] fears he says nevertheless God that
[53:07] comforteth those that are cast
[53:10] down doesn't mean anything if you're
[53:12] cast down what matters is what happens
[53:15] when you're cast down he says he
[53:17] comforted Us by the coming of Titus
[53:20] sometimes God's provision for you is
[53:22] another believer sometimes your down in
[53:25] the dump sometimes you're in despair
[53:27] sometimes you're depressed sometimes
[53:28] you're stressed you're tired and what
[53:30] does God do he sends an angel your way
[53:33] in the form of a brother or sister and
[53:35] sometimes it's physical support they
[53:37] come in they give you a meal they clean
[53:39] your house they take your kids for a
[53:41] while and sometimes it's spiritual
[53:43] support where they come in and they just
[53:45] give you a word in due
[53:47] season don't forget that sometimes
[53:49] you're God's answer you're the word that
[53:52] he sends to to help in the situation
[53:55] he'll send the word and flesh to meet us
[53:57] sometimes
[53:58] amen then Paul and this was after the
[54:01] next scripture I'm going to read but
[54:02] Paul would say for we would not Brethren
[54:04] have you ignorant of our trouble which
[54:06] came to us in Asia that we were pressed
[54:08] out of measure above strength in so much
[54:11] that we despaired even of Life the
[54:13] Amplified says for we do not want you to
[54:15] be uninformed Brethren about the
[54:16] Affliction and oppressing distress which
[54:19] befell US in Asia how we were so utterly
[54:22] and unbearably weighed down and crushed
[54:25] that we despaired even of life itself
[54:27] the great Apostle Paul the the greatest
[54:30] prophet of that age says I was utterly
[54:34] weighed down unbearably weighed down
[54:36] crushed I despaired of life I had no
[54:39] idea what was going to
[54:41] happen greatest man of his age and he's
[54:44] sitting there and he's so
[54:47] human the question is not are you going
[54:49] to be unbearably crushed or are you
[54:51] going to have despair it's are you going
[54:53] to stay there amen CU that's a choice
[54:58] and what you do in the situation will
[55:00] determine whether you stay in the
[55:01] situation or you come into a rock a
[55:04] strong a place a strong place of shelter
[55:06] that Christ gives us in the word amen
[55:08] Paul didn't stay in the feeling of loss
[55:10] and defeat and weariness watch what he
[55:12] says he says we had the sentence of
[55:14] death in
[55:15] ourselves why that we should not trust
[55:18] in ourselves but in God which raises the
[55:21] Dead the Amplified says indeed we felt
[55:23] within ourselves that we had receed
[55:25] received the very sentence of death this
[55:27] is going to kill me I'm not going to
[55:29] make it through I can't take it anymore
[55:31] it's gone further than it's ever gone
[55:33] before it's taking longer than it's ever
[55:35] taken before and I don't know where to
[55:37] go or what to
[55:38] do he says but that was to keep us from
[55:41] trusting and depending on ourselves
[55:44] instead of on God who raises the
[55:47] dead what was Paul saying about this he
[55:50] says I learned a lesson in this and the
[55:52] lesson is my life is in God's hands your
[55:54] life is in in God's hands nothing can
[55:56] touch our health nothing can touch our
[55:57] families our marriage our finances our
[55:59] job our children whatever it is nothing
[56:02] can touch US unless God allows it and he
[56:05] said the the situation we were in was to
[56:07] teach us that it's God that protects us
[56:09] it's God that keeps us it's God's power
[56:11] inside of us that keeps us in all of
[56:13] these things amen that that song we sing
[56:16] on Christ the solid rock I stand my his
[56:18] oath his Covenant his blood support me
[56:21] in the whelming flood when all around my
[56:24] soul Soul gives way he then is All My
[56:27] Hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I
[56:29] stand all other ground is sinking sand
[56:32] amen the greatest thing you can realize
[56:34] is that you are built on
[56:36] Bedrock you're built on a solid
[56:39] foundation and sometimes we've got to be
[56:40] stripped and broken down to realize that
[56:42] the thing that is holding us up is what
[56:44] we're built on and not
[56:46] ourselves but look at the finishing of
[56:49] this Paul gives us hope he says who
[56:52] delivered us Paul's giving a testimony
[56:55] here and then he says from so great a
[56:57] death that's all past tense he says and
[57:00] do deliver That's The Great I Am that's
[57:03] the god of every day that's the god of
[57:05] every moment the everpresent god that's
[57:08] with us he is a god of Deliverance he
[57:10] says and he does deliver he says in whom
[57:13] we trust right now that he will
[57:16] yet he says Deliver Us what future tends
[57:20] to Deliver Us from a present problem
[57:23] Paul says he delivered us he will
[57:25] deliver us and he is delivering us he
[57:28] didn't say I see it he didn't say I
[57:30] understand it but he said he's a god of
[57:32] Deliverance amen we Face things day to
[57:35] day and sometimes it just seems like
[57:36] like things just drop on us and it
[57:38] crushes us and it seems like we've done
[57:40] everything right and we've done what we
[57:42] ought to do and then something drops on
[57:44] us and we think that's one more thing to
[57:46] Bear day by day just recognize God
[57:49] delivers God knows what you can carry
[57:52] God knows what you can bear amen
[57:55] amen but let's get back to our message
[57:57] for this morning and and if we look at
[57:59] the the attributes here and this is the
[58:01] way that it's drawn out traditionally by
[58:03] brother brandom is is this pyramid and
[58:05] we can see the changing intention of
[58:07] these attributes here because we look at
[58:09] the starting point of faith and faith is
[58:11] firstly for you when you have faith to
[58:14] receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[58:16] savior that's for you it's not for
[58:18] anybody else but then you start to have
[58:20] virtue and that virtue is strength and
[58:22] that's firstly strength for you but it
[58:24] starts to turn to strength for others as
[58:26] well to draw from you and we go from
[58:29] there and we add knowledge and remember
[58:30] brother Bram says that's knowledge that
[58:32] the word of God is true and again that's
[58:35] for you not necessarily for somebody
[58:37] else now if if it's if you're a father
[58:40] or you're a mother or a husband or a
[58:42] wife or these different things then
[58:43] obviously that has an impact but again
[58:45] these first three things are primarily
[58:47] for you but then you step into
[58:49] Temperance and while Temperance benefits
[58:51] me because it keeps me from blowing up
[58:53] it's really for the person on the other
[58:55] side and so you see that it starts to
[58:58] transition now to start to focus on
[59:00] other people rather than yourself as you
[59:02] get higher up the pyramid in these
[59:04] attributes amen and these things the
[59:06] thing with Temperance is that it it
[59:08] gives people a blessing instead of the
[59:10] curse they really deserve and we see
[59:12] that with patience and these different
[59:13] things but brother BR would talk about
[59:15] this and how you get closer to the top
[59:18] it gets narrower and narrower and he
[59:20] says that's because less and less people
[59:22] have these different things the higher
[59:25] you get see the less it's about you and
[59:27] the more it's about others and that's
[59:29] where we all naturally tend to struggle
[59:30] isn't it is when it's for the other
[59:32] person and you're turning now from
[59:34] selfishness to sacrifice to service
[59:38] because we're supposed to be servants
[59:40] amen not just Masters and as you get
[59:42] higher and higher and higher these
[59:44] things become more and more difficult
[59:46] for the carnal nature because it starts
[59:48] to turn away from yourself and to the
[59:50] benefit of others and we see people that
[59:53] have these things remember the quote I
[59:54] read at the beginning of of this series
[59:56] where brother Bram says people have some
[59:58] of these things naturally and they're
[1:00:00] not even
[1:00:01] Christians they have these benefit they
[1:00:04] have these attributes but nobody has
[1:00:07] them all unless they're a child of God
[1:00:08] that's the other thing you'll see but I
[1:00:10] met people that have the patience of Job
[1:00:12] and they don't even know who Christ is
[1:00:14] absolutely they just have it but what
[1:00:16] happens is they'll come to the next
[1:00:18] stage or another stage and they won't
[1:00:20] move past it because they don't have it
[1:00:21] naturally and because they're not a
[1:00:23] child of God God's not working to draw
[1:00:25] them through it and so they just
[1:00:26] stagnate they stop they fall away
[1:00:28] whatever it might be but with a child of
[1:00:30] God God's always working with us to
[1:00:32] bring us through these entire stages
[1:00:35] amen otherwise people just get hurt they
[1:00:37] get tired they get disappointed they get
[1:00:39] weary and they fall away but the child
[1:00:41] of God keeps pressing through because
[1:00:42] they're a child of God and he's pulling
[1:00:44] us through he's going to make us produce
[1:00:46] what's inside of us amen now I'm not
[1:00:49] saying that we don't get weary or tired
[1:00:51] we do Believers we feel all those things
[1:00:53] amen but what do we do when we feel
[1:00:55] those things that's the thing that
[1:00:57] defines us is not what the what the
[1:00:58] situation we're in but it's what we do
[1:01:00] in those situations that tell us who and
[1:01:02] what we are remember I read that quote
[1:01:04] where brother BR says cross a Christian
[1:01:05] up one time and you'll find out if he's
[1:01:07] really a Christian or she's really a
[1:01:08] Christian Paul would say this he says we
[1:01:10] are troubled on every
[1:01:13] side anybody had a lot of trouble
[1:01:15] recently where it seems like
[1:01:17] everything's going wrong here's a
[1:01:19] scripture for you he says yet not
[1:01:23] distressed
[1:01:25] you're in trouble you feel troubled you
[1:01:27] you're you're worried you're uncertain
[1:01:29] about where things are going he says but
[1:01:31] we're not distressed we're
[1:01:33] perplexed we don't have understanding we
[1:01:36] don't have Insight he says but we're not
[1:01:38] in despair we're persecuted but we're
[1:01:41] not forsaken that's a revelation that
[1:01:44] God's with you no matter what he says
[1:01:47] and we're cast down but not destroyed
[1:01:49] remember a righteous man falls down
[1:01:51] seven times but he gets up again and
[1:01:53] again and again
[1:01:55] it's not that we're never cast down it's
[1:01:56] not that we don't fall down it's that it
[1:01:58] doesn't destroy us it doesn't take us
[1:02:00] out of the path that God's called us for
[1:02:02] amen a Believer is allowed to feel
[1:02:05] that's a part of our Humanity you'll
[1:02:07] never hear me say you're not allowed to
[1:02:09] feel but the believer doesn't rest on
[1:02:11] their feelings you'll never see emotion
[1:02:15] in the attributes of a Believer there's
[1:02:19] no emotion
[1:02:21] here patience like we're talking about
[1:02:23] is not an emotion
[1:02:25] love like we're talking about is not an
[1:02:27] emotion brotherly kindness is not an
[1:02:29] emotion it's an attribute these are
[1:02:31] actions not feelings amen so we go
[1:02:34] through these things and and so the the
[1:02:37] the Believers allowed to feel but the
[1:02:39] Believers are not allowed to rest on
[1:02:40] their feelings amen and so we come to
[1:02:43] something like patience and and remember
[1:02:45] brother Brown says the first thing to do
[1:02:46] is have patience with God and that's for
[1:02:49] your benefit but then he says and then
[1:02:51] have patience with others and that's for
[1:02:53] their benefit
[1:02:54] and as you grow these B these attributes
[1:02:56] are starting to turn outwardly rather
[1:02:58] than inwardly and the great Mark of a or
[1:03:01] an attribute of a Christian is that they
[1:03:03] act the same no matter how other people
[1:03:05] act there's a constancy there's a
[1:03:07] there's a a Simplicity a straightness to
[1:03:10] our walk and it has nothing to do with
[1:03:12] what the other person does or says we
[1:03:14] ought to walk the same way no matter
[1:03:16] what we come to Godliness and we know
[1:03:18] that's to act and live and receive the
[1:03:20] word of God and we know there's a price
[1:03:22] to pay for Godly living there's a price
[1:03:25] to pay for these things and we've got to
[1:03:27] be able to understand the sacrifice that
[1:03:29] comes with having Christ live in your
[1:03:31] life and we've got to be ready for those
[1:03:33] things and then we come to brotherly
[1:03:35] kindness and that's the seventh
[1:03:36] attribute and that's the crowning
[1:03:38] attribute that we have in us as children
[1:03:42] of God I want to explain that because
[1:03:44] and brother BR would go into it and he'd
[1:03:45] say seven means completion he says and
[1:03:48] brotherly kindness is as far as you can
[1:03:50] go you're built with this you're born
[1:03:53] with this because you're a child of God
[1:03:55] and and and and that's as far as we can
[1:03:57] go but there's a Capstone that has to be
[1:03:59] external to us to come down and solidify
[1:04:02] this and make it all work and that's
[1:04:03] where God truly steps in and he starts
[1:04:06] working inside of our life amen but
[1:04:08] Brotherly Love is as far as we can go
[1:04:09] brotherly kindness we can't go to
[1:04:12] charity without him but all of these
[1:04:13] other things are built into us to be
[1:04:15] able to work this way brother Brian
[1:04:17] would say this he says then let's add
[1:04:19] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness he
[1:04:22] says when we get to that brother ly
[1:04:24] kindness what does it mean he says put
[1:04:27] yourself in his place on the matter my
[1:04:31] brother sinned against me said Peter
[1:04:32] shall I forgive him he said seven times
[1:04:34] a day Jesus said 70 times seven see
[1:04:38] brotherly kindness he says now you see
[1:04:40] if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[1:04:43] impatient with him see be kind to him
[1:04:46] and go
[1:04:48] anyhow now we're getting to the
[1:04:51] peak now we're getting narrow because
[1:04:54] the closer you'll see with the other
[1:04:56] things that so many of them are
[1:04:57] applicable to to people outside but when
[1:04:59] we get to brotherly kindness we're
[1:05:00] dealing now with Believers primarily
[1:05:03] I've said it before the people that can
[1:05:05] hurt us disappoint us disillusion us the
[1:05:07] greatest are those that that confess
[1:05:09] Jesus Christ as their lord and savior
[1:05:11] the same as us we've got a greater
[1:05:12] expectation of these but he's saying
[1:05:14] that brotherly kindness seeks to
[1:05:16] understand rather than judge or
[1:05:19] condemn and that's a hard thing to do
[1:05:22] sometimes especially when it's personal
[1:05:23] to us it's very hard to do amen but
[1:05:27] understanding where a person is or where
[1:05:29] they're coming from doesn't excuse their
[1:05:31] actions that's not what Brotherly Love
[1:05:33] does or brotherly kindness does but
[1:05:36] rather it explains their actions and
[1:05:38] allows you to approach it from a place
[1:05:39] of understanding rather than
[1:05:41] condemnation or judgment that's a tough
[1:05:44] thing to do especially like I said when
[1:05:46] it's personal now the greatest deception
[1:05:48] the world has today is because I
[1:05:50] understand it's right and we see that we
[1:05:53] see that with all these alternative
[1:05:54] Lifestyles and we see it with the
[1:05:55] choices people are making and people say
[1:05:57] yeah I can see why you're doing that
[1:06:00] therefore it's okay no that's not the
[1:06:02] way it works understanding doesn't ever
[1:06:05] cause us to compromise on the word of
[1:06:06] God ever ever ever ever I can understand
[1:06:10] why you're doing it but that doesn't
[1:06:12] make it right and and as a minister many
[1:06:15] times the people will come and they'll
[1:06:17] talk to you about situations and you sit
[1:06:19] there and it's a great tale of
[1:06:21] Woe but what you say in the end is you
[1:06:23] say I understand but then you have to
[1:06:26] say but the word says because brotherly
[1:06:30] kindness will take us back and restore
[1:06:32] or introduce somebody to the word of God
[1:06:34] that's what we do is we understand where
[1:06:37] they're coming from but we're seeking to
[1:06:39] bring them to where they need to be and
[1:06:41] that understanding gives us patience it
[1:06:43] gives us love it gives us concern for
[1:06:45] them and it raises their well-being
[1:06:47] above ours and so we sacrifice our
[1:06:50] position so that we can draw them to
[1:06:52] where they need to be amen
[1:06:54] but it never causes us to compromise on
[1:06:56] the word of God like I said people will
[1:06:58] will come in and they're fearful and
[1:07:00] they're worried about things and that
[1:07:02] worry drives them to a decision rather
[1:07:05] than the word of God we can't do that we
[1:07:07] can't let time press us to make a
[1:07:09] decision without the word of God to
[1:07:11] support us and people will C fall back
[1:07:13] on that and say I don't have time I
[1:07:14] don't have time you've always got time
[1:07:17] there's nothing that requires us to go
[1:07:18] outside of the word of God there's no
[1:07:20] situation so desperate that would cause
[1:07:22] us to compromise and then compromis is
[1:07:24] the Devil's Playground I believe is the
[1:07:25] saying amen but these things ought to
[1:07:28] drive us to God not drive us to a
[1:07:29] decision and so we don't give ground
[1:07:32] because of what's happening around us we
[1:07:33] don't give ground because of what's
[1:07:34] going on around us but we stay with the
[1:07:37] word of God and having done all to stand
[1:07:38] Paul said stand stay there and wait and
[1:07:41] let God move in these things because
[1:07:42] otherwise what happens is we take the
[1:07:44] road of our own understanding our own
[1:07:46] reason our own logic our own fear how
[1:07:48] can God be using
[1:07:50] fear God never used remember perfect
[1:07:53] love casts out fear fear God cannot use
[1:07:55] worry God cannot use fear to drive us to
[1:07:57] a word-based Godly decision he cannot do
[1:08:00] it amen he just can't do it remember
[1:08:03] this scripture in Proverbs it says
[1:08:05] there's a way that seeth right unto a
[1:08:07] man but the way thereof the end thereof
[1:08:10] are the ways of death don't let Satan
[1:08:13] sway you with your emotions don't let
[1:08:14] him pull on these things emotions aren't
[1:08:16] bad we have emotional Services we have
[1:08:19] emotional marriages we have emotional
[1:08:21] relationships we are creatures of
[1:08:23] emotion God didn't give us emotions so
[1:08:25] that we wouldn't ever use them or enjoy
[1:08:27] them but they're supposed to be brought
[1:08:29] subject to the word of God because
[1:08:30] emotions aren't
[1:08:32] Sanctified emotions aren't converted and
[1:08:35] so we've got to bring them subject to
[1:08:37] the word of God every every every time
[1:08:39] like I said emotion's not in that
[1:08:41] pyramid of Christian attributes that's
[1:08:43] just an attribute of you as a human amen
[1:08:45] but then we jump to the other side and
[1:08:48] you come to where I tend to be which is
[1:08:49] that place of cold hard logic and reason
[1:08:52] and we can look as logical people look
[1:08:55] down on those that are emotional because
[1:08:57] it's just two sides of the same con same
[1:09:00] coin cuz we're trying to bring whatever
[1:09:01] it is we're using subject to the word of
[1:09:04] God if you're emotional you got to bring
[1:09:06] your your emotion subject to the word of
[1:09:08] God if you're a deep thinker and very
[1:09:09] logical you've got to bring your
[1:09:10] thoughts subject to the word of God
[1:09:13] remember what Paul said he says for
[1:09:14] though we walk in the flesh we don't war
[1:09:16] after the flesh so flesh can be logic
[1:09:19] and flesh can be reason and emotion it
[1:09:22] can be all of these things he says for
[1:09:24] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:09:25] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:09:27] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[1:09:31] imaginations that word means arguments
[1:09:34] theories and
[1:09:36] reasonings so theological German must be
[1:09:40] equally uh subject to the word of God as
[1:09:44] the weepy crying lovey-dovey emotional
[1:09:47] person I've got to bring what I Am
[1:09:49] Naturally subject to the word as much as
[1:09:51] somebody that's highly emotional he says
[1:09:54] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:09:56] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:09:58] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:10:02] The Obedience of God of Christ every
[1:10:05] thought has to be brought obedient to
[1:10:07] Christ to the word brother M says this
[1:10:09] he says what we need is an old-fashioned
[1:10:13] Backwoods sky blue sin killing religion
[1:10:16] what we need is Gun Barrel straight
[1:10:19] something that'll preach the gospel
[1:10:21] without compromise and let the chips
[1:10:23] fall wherever they wish to and chop into
[1:10:25] it he says we need men of God stain with
[1:10:27] power get the church back into the place
[1:10:30] where it ought to be if you've ever
[1:10:32] fired a gun and there's something wrong
[1:10:33] with the barrel it's it where the bullet
[1:10:36] lands is always indiscriminate one
[1:10:39] minute it's high and right the next
[1:10:40] minute it's down and left and the next
[1:10:41] minute it's right in the middle and
[1:10:43] there's no Rhyme or Reason why cuz your
[1:10:44] gun Barrel's messed up it's got to be
[1:10:46] straightened it's got to be free of
[1:10:48] obstruction brother Bram says we got to
[1:10:49] preach the word straight not compromis
[1:10:52] because of what somebody says what
[1:10:54] somebody feels how hard the situation
[1:10:57] is it it's this understanding of
[1:10:59] Brotherly Love is such a trap because we
[1:11:02] know how it feels to be in
[1:11:04] situations and the longer you live the
[1:11:06] more you understand where people are and
[1:11:08] what they're doing and why they're doing
[1:11:09] these things amen but this idea is to
[1:11:13] seek with the intention of restoring
[1:11:14] them not to just empathize empathy
[1:11:18] doesn't help anybody it helps them in
[1:11:20] the moment but it doesn't help them move
[1:11:22] down the road every day we make choices
[1:11:25] and our walk with God is choices and we
[1:11:27] have these areas of great strength and
[1:11:29] and we tend to rest in those areas but
[1:11:31] there areas where we have yet to prove
[1:11:32] God and that's where brotherly kindness
[1:11:34] is required of me for you and you for me
[1:11:37] because there's areas in my life that
[1:11:38] maybe I haven't been tested in yet or
[1:11:40] God hasn't proven himself in a
[1:11:41] particular way and when I come up to
[1:11:43] that area I may fall or you may fall
[1:11:47] there are some things you look at you
[1:11:48] know you'll see this especially with
[1:11:50] children you may only deal with a
[1:11:52] particular situation with your child
[1:11:53] once in their life or twice in their
[1:11:55] life as they become teenagers we've got
[1:11:57] to make decisions about how we raise
[1:11:59] them we've got to make decisions about
[1:12:00] what we allow in our home we've got to
[1:12:02] make decisions like Joshua said as for
[1:12:03] me and my house we're going to serve the
[1:12:05] Lord and you may only have to make that
[1:12:07] decision once but you're going to have
[1:12:08] to make it and different children
[1:12:10] respond different ways and we see family
[1:12:13] relationships that we've had to give up
[1:12:14] and these different things and we've got
[1:12:16] to decide are we going to let those
[1:12:17] things Slide by compromise or are we
[1:12:21] going to hold fast to the word of God
[1:12:23] because you know what our feelings say
[1:12:24] our feelings say I'm going to keep our
[1:12:26] my children close to me so that I can
[1:12:28] impact them and in the meanwhile we're
[1:12:31] compromising on the word of God you're
[1:12:33] keeping them close to compromise that
[1:12:35] doesn't make any sense God can't use it
[1:12:37] my wife was telling me of a of of a
[1:12:39] family she she knows or we know down in
[1:12:41] California they're professing Christians
[1:12:44] and and and you know good people good H
[1:12:46] good father and and mother and and
[1:12:48] they've got this this this young
[1:12:50] daughter and she's got one child out of
[1:12:52] wedlock last I heard now she's got two
[1:12:54] children out of woodlock and she lives
[1:12:56] in their home with them cuz her the the
[1:12:58] girl's boyfriend is away much of the
[1:13:00] time but when he comes back he stays in
[1:13:01] their house with her they're allowing
[1:13:04] fornication in their home for the sake
[1:13:07] of having their daughter close to them
[1:13:09] how can God bless it God can't bless
[1:13:12] that God can't bless that there's no
[1:13:15] there's no price that she's paying for
[1:13:17] her decisions and so she gets to stay
[1:13:20] there and reap the benefits of a
[1:13:21] Christian home without having the word
[1:13:23] actually held accountable in her life
[1:13:26] God can't bless that God can never take
[1:13:28] you out of his word by his will it's
[1:13:30] impossible brother Bram said his word is
[1:13:32] his will you can't say God told me to do
[1:13:34] it and it's contrary to his will it
[1:13:36] doesn't work that way anden if you've
[1:13:38] never seen God provide for your finances
[1:13:41] you'll work your fingers to the Bone
[1:13:43] trying to get
[1:13:44] money you know I in my life I've had
[1:13:47] good years and I've had bad years and
[1:13:48] what I found is that God is faithful no
[1:13:50] matter what some of the best years I've
[1:13:53] had I made the least
[1:13:55] money and I think it was God showing me
[1:13:58] that my finances are in his hands not in
[1:14:00] mine because it seems like the more you
[1:14:02] make then the more you spend or the you
[1:14:05] get things fail on you you you have you
[1:14:07] know high cost for this or that and the
[1:14:08] other thing you get to the end of the
[1:14:09] year and say I made all that money and
[1:14:11] I've got less to show for it next year
[1:14:12] you make $30,000 less and You' got more
[1:14:14] to show for it why it's God showing you
[1:14:16] that it's not what you do it's what he
[1:14:18] does remember way he said he
[1:14:20] says he says you know try me prove me he
[1:14:24] says and see if I won't pour out a
[1:14:26] blessing do what's right seek ye first
[1:14:28] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:14:30] and all these things will be added unto
[1:14:32] you scripture says except the Lord build
[1:14:34] the house they labor in vain that build
[1:14:36] it and whether it's our finances our
[1:14:38] health our marriage whatever it might be
[1:14:40] our businesses unless the Lord builds it
[1:14:43] it's all going to crumble
[1:14:45] anyways because here's the thing we
[1:14:47] might think we're getting ahead in one
[1:14:48] area but we're destroying in another
[1:14:50] area you know I I remember in Texas
[1:14:53] there for a while they had a special
[1:14:54] project they assigned to me and I was
[1:14:55] spending an extra 2 hours a day at work
[1:14:58] and you know what that did that gave me
[1:15:00] a bonus that got me employee of the year
[1:15:03] that got me a big
[1:15:05] raise and it hurt my
[1:15:07] marriage and all I could see was the
[1:15:09] benefits on this side not realizing that
[1:15:11] I was destroying something on the other
[1:15:14] destroy marriage destroy Fellowship
[1:15:15] destroy Church attendance whatever it
[1:15:17] might be we've got to be able to see
[1:15:19] that God's got to keep us on the
[1:15:20] straight and narrow with these things
[1:15:22] and he keeps us in Bound bance for what
[1:15:23] we need for each and every one of our
[1:15:25] Lives amen but here's the thing we're
[1:15:28] talking about brotherly love what
[1:15:30] happens when you see me doing
[1:15:32] that what happens when I see you doing
[1:15:35] it what do we what do we do then we
[1:15:38] apply brotherly kindness that's what we
[1:15:41] do it's a place of understanding because
[1:15:43] guess what each one of us have been in
[1:15:45] that place in some form or fashion in
[1:15:46] our
[1:15:47] life we've been there we've done it
[1:15:50] we've come up to the test and we failed
[1:15:53] or we've come up to the test and we've
[1:15:54] passed and no matter what it ought to
[1:15:56] give us an understanding or an
[1:15:58] appreciation for where that person's at
[1:16:00] and what it takes sometimes to make the
[1:16:02] right decision because when you get into
[1:16:04] tight spots the the right decision is
[1:16:06] the hard decision and it can be so
[1:16:09] difficult to step out in faith and say
[1:16:11] Lord I'm going to trust your word rather
[1:16:13] than trust what everybody else would
[1:16:14] tell me to do because a Christian's
[1:16:16] action or reaction is never the same as
[1:16:19] the world's ever and so unless you're in
[1:16:21] the right circle of Fellowship unless
[1:16:23] you're in the word you're going to be
[1:16:24] drawn to make the wrong decision time
[1:16:26] and time again but yet God brings us
[1:16:28] through
[1:16:29] it David would say this in Psalms he
[1:16:32] says because thy loving kindness is
[1:16:34] better than life he says my lips shall
[1:16:36] praise thee thus will I bless thee while
[1:16:38] I live and I will lift up my hands in
[1:16:40] thy name remember Jesus said freely
[1:16:42] you've received freely give his loving
[1:16:46] kindness we can all testify to it I
[1:16:47] believe when we got something and he
[1:16:50] brought us around and he got us to the
[1:16:52] right place even even maybe we made the
[1:16:53] wrong decision even maybe we went the
[1:16:55] wrong way and then his loving kindness
[1:16:57] comes around and it restores us back to
[1:16:59] the word so we can have our feet on a
[1:17:02] secure path and then we can come back
[1:17:04] and we can Praise Him and thank him for
[1:17:05] those things and then you see me do it
[1:17:07] get out of the line or you get out of
[1:17:08] the line what do we
[1:17:10] do do we go to restore or do we go to
[1:17:13] condemn and
[1:17:15] judge brother Bram says this he says
[1:17:17] Jesus said if you just do favors for
[1:17:19] those that do favors for you while the
[1:17:21] publicans do the same thing
[1:17:24] but see you must be kind to those that
[1:17:25] are unkind to you do good for those that
[1:17:28] would do evil to you always remember
[1:17:30] that keep that before you that God is
[1:17:33] watching you rem remember God was good
[1:17:35] to you when you were evil to him while
[1:17:38] you were yet sinners Christ died for you
[1:17:41] our approach ought to be one of
[1:17:43] understanding of experience of I've been
[1:17:46] there but here's the beauty of being a
[1:17:48] mature Christian is with that experience
[1:17:50] we ought to have a testimony of the
[1:17:52] faithfulness of God God to his word I me
[1:17:55] sometimes all people need is that
[1:17:57] testimony to help them make the right
[1:17:59] decision remember when brother Dwayne
[1:18:00] was here and he was talking about
[1:18:02] tithing and offerings I've never heard
[1:18:04] somebody get a blessing out of tithes
[1:18:06] and offerings the way brother Dwayne
[1:18:07] Fair did nobody's ever given me a
[1:18:09] vehicle like
[1:18:10] that but him spending his life on the
[1:18:14] road hundreds of thousands of kilometers
[1:18:16] driving his Vehicles into the ground he
[1:18:18] does the right thing and God gives him
[1:18:20] exactly what he needs in the exact spec
[1:18:23] and color that he needs it in that
[1:18:25] Suburban he had a
[1:18:27] testimony of the faithfulness of God we
[1:18:30] have testimony after testimony if you're
[1:18:33] an entrepreneur we've got brother Joe
[1:18:34] here we got brother Chad brother Chad's
[1:18:36] a new entrepreneur and this sort of
[1:18:38] thing and he's blowing the socks off of
[1:18:39] it why the goodness of
[1:18:42] God that's not brother Chad it's not
[1:18:45] brother Joe it's the goodness of God
[1:18:48] proving his word so that you can have
[1:18:51] faith when your situation comes up St
[1:18:53] that's similar to theirs we've had it
[1:18:54] for health we've had it for finances
[1:18:56] we've had it for provision we've had it
[1:18:58] for deliverance we've had it for healing
[1:19:00] and yours might take longer than mine
[1:19:01] and mine might take longer for yours but
[1:19:03] that testimony is to help and edify the
[1:19:06] believer next to you through brotherly
[1:19:08] kindness to say I understand but let me
[1:19:10] tell you about a God who answers prayer
[1:19:12] let me tell you about a God who heals
[1:19:14] let me tell you about a God who provides
[1:19:16] let me tell you about a God who shows
[1:19:18] you where you can go and what you can do
[1:19:20] let me tell you about a God that answers
[1:19:22] prayer
[1:19:25] that's what we're here for that
[1:19:26] brotherly kindness says I understand now
[1:19:29] let me show you what happens when you
[1:19:30] follow the word of God let me show you
[1:19:32] what happens when you make a decision
[1:19:34] for Christ above yourself let me tell
[1:19:36] you what happens when you're patient
[1:19:38] instead of rushing through let me tell
[1:19:40] you what happens when you cast worry out
[1:19:42] and fear out and you step into the love
[1:19:44] of
[1:19:46] God brother Braham says this he says the
[1:19:48] hardest thing in the world is somebody
[1:19:51] being taught one thing and then happen
[1:19:53] to see something that turns them all the
[1:19:54] way around when you think you're going
[1:19:56] right and you somebody preaches
[1:19:58] something that says you're wrong that's
[1:20:00] the hardest thing for us to recognize or
[1:20:02] believe is that I am completely wrong
[1:20:06] that's the hardest thing that's the most
[1:20:07] humbling thing is to recognize that in
[1:20:09] our sincerity in our good intentions we
[1:20:11] still have done wrong brother says it's
[1:20:14] the hardest
[1:20:16] thing he says and that's what's the
[1:20:18] matter with the Jews that rejected Jesus
[1:20:20] they've been taught one thing the rabbi
[1:20:22] said we can't CH that but yet
[1:20:23] scripturally Jesus was rightly the
[1:20:25] Messiah but they had it set up some
[1:20:27] other way he says and today isn't it
[1:20:29] just as true that we have our own ideas
[1:20:31] set
[1:20:33] up he says when God works in wondrous
[1:20:36] ways his wonders to perform my ways
[1:20:38] aren't
[1:20:39] wondrous and as good as you might be
[1:20:42] your ways aren't wondrous either he says
[1:20:43] we set it up our way we have a
[1:20:46] plan you know in boxing they say
[1:20:48] Everybody's Got A Plan until they get
[1:20:51] punched this is the approach this is how
[1:20:53] I'm going to beat this guy I've studied
[1:20:54] him this is the move he makes I've got
[1:20:56] him all figured out and then you get
[1:20:57] punched in the nose and all of a sudden
[1:20:59] you know where the plan goes right down
[1:21:00] on the floor with the blood dripping out
[1:21:02] of your nose we've got our own ways he
[1:21:04] says but God has wondrous ways and his
[1:21:06] wondrous ways are tied to his word he
[1:21:09] says God works in wondrous ways his
[1:21:11] wonders to perform he works many ways he
[1:21:13] says and we have it just the way we want
[1:21:15] it but God will send it to us his
[1:21:17] provided way for us he says receive it
[1:21:20] and be
[1:21:21] rejoicing this brotherly kindness is a
[1:21:24] recognition that this is a process and
[1:21:26] that where you're at may not be where
[1:21:28] somebody else is at and they've got to
[1:21:30] grow the same way you had to grow to get
[1:21:32] where you are it's an understanding that
[1:21:34] we're in a restoring process we're in a
[1:21:36] redeeming process and it's the washing
[1:21:38] of Water by the word and listen there's
[1:21:40] things that God had to deal with me on
[1:21:42] early that he may never get around to
[1:21:43] dealing with you because it just doesn't
[1:21:45] impact your position in the body of
[1:21:46] Christ and you can do things and say
[1:21:48] things and have things and and be things
[1:21:50] that I can't because I'm in a different
[1:21:52] position than you and then you can do
[1:21:54] the same thing with me God will deal
[1:21:56] with you and he doesn't have to deal
[1:21:58] with that on me because it's not a
[1:21:59] problem in my life or in my position and
[1:22:01] we have to be okay with that we have to
[1:22:04] be okay with those gray areas where
[1:22:05] somebody's tight and somebody's
[1:22:12] not but regardless in all these things
[1:22:14] we've got areas are going to be common
[1:22:16] we all have health needs we all have
[1:22:18] financial needs we all have relational
[1:22:19] needs we all have job needs we all have
[1:22:21] child needs and all these different
[1:22:23] things and so we come up to those things
[1:22:25] and we've got to realize that not
[1:22:26] everybody's mature as we are
[1:22:30] mature and sometimes we're not as mature
[1:22:32] as we think we are either amen but
[1:22:35] because we see clearly now doesn't mean
[1:22:37] we always saw clearly and because we
[1:22:39] make the right decision now doesn't mean
[1:22:40] we always made it and brotherly kindness
[1:22:42] reminds us of what we used to be so we
[1:22:44] can understand where somebody's at and
[1:22:46] we can work now to draw them up rather
[1:22:47] than to push them down and condemn them
[1:22:49] amen that'll temper our attitude towards
[1:22:52] people if we remember where we came from
[1:22:54] amen amazing
[1:22:56] grace Amazing Grace amen Paul said this
[1:23:01] in Galatians he says Brethren if a man
[1:23:03] be overtaken in a fault ye which are
[1:23:05] spiritual restore such a one in the
[1:23:08] spirit of meekness he says considering
[1:23:10] thyself lest thou also be tempted you
[1:23:12] say brother John I'm not tempted in that
[1:23:14] I would never do that you don't know
[1:23:15] what you do until God put you in the
[1:23:17] Press you don't know what You' do until
[1:23:19] God puts you in that place and we can
[1:23:20] sit here in our Ivory tires and say I
[1:23:22] would never do that you'd be surprised
[1:23:24] what You' do if you get a little bit
[1:23:26] weak if God pulls away his hand of grace
[1:23:28] and mercy you'd be surprised what you'd
[1:23:30] do David was ready to kill a man because
[1:23:33] he wouldn't give him some
[1:23:34] sheep and yet he wouldn't kill
[1:23:37] Saul David was ready to be a murderer in
[1:23:40] the heat of
[1:23:42] passion David took another man's wife
[1:23:46] when he got away from being where he
[1:23:48] ought to
[1:23:48] be don't tell me you'd never do it it's
[1:23:52] only by God's grace we wouldn't do it
[1:23:55] and you get so high and proud and hottie
[1:23:56] and I would never do it and look at them
[1:23:58] and can't they just get it right listen
[1:24:00] God will put you in a situation and
[1:24:01] humble you because Pride goes before a
[1:24:04] fall and you get proud because you're
[1:24:05] not where somebody else is look out that
[1:24:08] is the the opposite of what Christianity
[1:24:10] ought to be doing or saying he says bear
[1:24:12] ye one another's burdens and so fulfill
[1:24:15] the law of Christ sometimes our burden
[1:24:17] is to bear bear with somebody else's
[1:24:21] weakness with without blowing
[1:24:23] up in understanding being patient with
[1:24:27] that person's shortcoming until they
[1:24:29] come to the place of maturity and as
[1:24:31] mature Believers this is the peak of our
[1:24:35] of our of our attributes remember this
[1:24:36] is the seventh one the highest level is
[1:24:38] to Bear somebody else's burden somebody
[1:24:40] else's weakness somebody else's maturity
[1:24:42] until they come to a place where they
[1:24:43] ought to be and we pay the price for
[1:24:46] their lack and we do it willingly it's
[1:24:49] sacrificial he says for if a man think
[1:24:51] himself to be something when he's
[1:24:53] nothing he deceives
[1:24:55] himself remember this he said such were
[1:24:58] some of you he says but ye are washed ye
[1:25:01] are Sanctified you are justified in the
[1:25:03] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[1:25:05] of our God look at brother
[1:25:07] brandham he's a seventh Church a
[1:25:09] messenger he's a word prophet and he
[1:25:11] comes down he has uh spoken word
[1:25:14] Authority he's an adopted son of God
[1:25:16] he's got signs of Wonders that have been
[1:25:18] unparalleled since Christ was here and
[1:25:21] he comes down and he goes to the
[1:25:22] denominations and they love the signs
[1:25:24] and wonders they love the discernment
[1:25:26] they love the third pole they love all
[1:25:27] these things but they refuse his
[1:25:29] Doctrine and it's just like Christ and
[1:25:32] watch what he says here he says somebody
[1:25:34] said not long ago and how can you
[1:25:35] believe these things the way you do and
[1:25:37] still go to the Assemblies of God and
[1:25:39] Oneness and all the rest cuz he's
[1:25:41] preaching it and they're rejecting him
[1:25:43] and the doors are closing this is almost
[1:25:45] at the end of 1962 the doors have been
[1:25:47] closing for a while now and brother R's
[1:25:50] been squeezed and squeezed into where
[1:25:52] they'll actually receive his message he
[1:25:54] says then put see brotherly kindness
[1:25:57] hoping someday see it keeps you doing it
[1:26:02] he says patient with him see temperate
[1:26:06] enduring with him well I've told them 73
[1:26:09] times I've preached it and I preached it
[1:26:11] and I've taught it and I've told them
[1:26:12] and they still don't do it temper
[1:26:15] it he says knowledge to understand what
[1:26:18] he believes remember it's in his heart
[1:26:19] that's what it is he says virtue in
[1:26:22] yourself to let it go out with kindness
[1:26:27] not with frustration not with anger not
[1:26:30] with offense and hurt he says Let it go
[1:26:32] out with kindness he says meekness to
[1:26:35] him having faith that someday God will
[1:26:38] bring him in he says see brotherly
[1:26:40] kindness the seventh thing that's the
[1:26:43] only two paragraphs he gives us in
[1:26:45] stature of a perfect man he says put
[1:26:46] yourself in the other person's place so
[1:26:48] you can understand where they come from
[1:26:50] he says and act in a way that shows God
[1:26:53] you believe that God will bring that
[1:26:54] person
[1:26:55] higher that's giving them the benefit of
[1:26:57] a doubt listen we don't know who our
[1:26:59] brother and sister
[1:27:00] is until they are our brother and sister
[1:27:04] and listen we've still got false
[1:27:05] brothers and sisters as well so we're
[1:27:07] supposed to treat each one
[1:27:09] equally Saul was not a brother until he
[1:27:13] became Paul but he was a brother all
[1:27:15] along they just didn't know it cuz he
[1:27:16] wasn't acting like it amen but remember
[1:27:19] God tells ananas he says go and pray for
[1:27:21] Saul he says Lord he's been killing us
[1:27:24] he's been giving us a hard time we
[1:27:26] shouldn't be messing with this guy and
[1:27:27] God says he is a chosen vessel can you
[1:27:30] imagine if ananas said Lord get yourself
[1:27:33] another man I ain't doing it he's been
[1:27:36] he's been bothering us he's been putting
[1:27:38] us in jail I know somebody he killed
[1:27:40] just last
[1:27:41] week no ananas in brotherly kindness you
[1:27:46] went you ever read your Bible he says
[1:27:48] brother
[1:27:48] Saul brother
[1:27:51] Saul
[1:27:53] he says the Lord came to me told me to
[1:27:55] come pray for you that you'll receive
[1:27:56] your sight and then he went out and
[1:27:57] baptized him and Paul got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:59] and he never looked back brother
[1:28:01] Saul the accuser of the Brethren the
[1:28:04] Jailer the
[1:28:06] Tormentor brother
[1:28:08] Saul we look around this church and we
[1:28:11] see people from across Canada we've got
[1:28:13] people from across the Western
[1:28:14] Hemisphere and we've got people from
[1:28:16] across the globe we've got black people
[1:28:17] white people brown people we've got
[1:28:19] different cultures we've got people from
[1:28:21] different religions we've we got people
[1:28:22] from no religions we've got people from
[1:28:25] all walks of life we've got people that
[1:28:27] have only been in this church all their
[1:28:28] life and we've got people that have been
[1:28:29] in multiple churches all their life amen
[1:28:31] we've got different ways of response
[1:28:33] we've got different ways of worship
[1:28:34] we've got different ways of reacting to
[1:28:36] things and that's sometimes what causes
[1:28:39] us the greatest test of Brotherly
[1:28:41] kindness somebody's different than you
[1:28:44] are and you know what it is tradition
[1:28:47] it's culture so many of the things that
[1:28:50] causes friction have nothing nothing to
[1:28:52] do with the actual word of God we tend
[1:28:54] to believe exactly on Doctrine be
[1:28:56] somebody does it this way or they don't
[1:28:58] do it that way and all of a sudden we
[1:28:59] get up and arms about it why tradition
[1:29:01] and culture and it has nothing to do
[1:29:03] with who we are amen I've been around
[1:29:05] the world there's remember brother Bram
[1:29:07] said there's a national spirit I went to
[1:29:10] Russia and Russia is somber and kind of
[1:29:14] sad and Melancholy I could never live in
[1:29:16] Russia it felt depressing to me but
[1:29:19] that's their Natural Spirit then you go
[1:29:21] to America America and America's louder
[1:29:24] and more boisterous and more joyous and
[1:29:26] more very
[1:29:27] outward then you go to Africa they
[1:29:31] worship like nobody else can
[1:29:33] worship you go to South America and
[1:29:36] they've got a a calmer more contented a
[1:29:38] more peaceful type of nature very happy
[1:29:41] with life in general very very content
[1:29:44] in in in the Simplicity of their life
[1:29:46] and yet you go to every single one of
[1:29:48] those places and you meet people and you
[1:29:50] immediately connect because they're a
[1:29:51] part part of the family of God but you
[1:29:54] know what would happen if I stuck around
[1:29:56] long enough I'd find places of friction
[1:29:58] because their Traditions are different
[1:29:59] than mine and their culture is different
[1:30:00] than mine but that's not what makes us
[1:30:03] Believers that's not what makes us part
[1:30:05] of the body of Christ what makes us a
[1:30:06] part of the body of Christ is the holy
[1:30:07] spirit in your life and the Holy Spirit
[1:30:09] In My Life by One Spirit we're baptized
[1:30:12] into this body not by One Pastor not by
[1:30:15] one church not by one tradition not by
[1:30:17] one culture it's by one spirit and I
[1:30:20] have been to all of those places and I
[1:30:21] have met Believers and I knew without a
[1:30:23] shadow of a doubt we were we were part
[1:30:25] of the same
[1:30:26] body and God accepts their worship the
[1:30:28] same as mine whether it's a what I would
[1:30:31] say a higher level or a lower level it
[1:30:33] did not matter God accepts it because
[1:30:35] that's how he's made them and he works
[1:30:37] with them in that way but we'll sit
[1:30:40] there and we'll say no that can't be it
[1:30:42] why tradition and
[1:30:44] culture sometimes these things like I
[1:30:46] said clash and they cause
[1:30:47] misunderstanding and like I said it's
[1:30:49] not spiritual it's not scriptural it's
[1:30:52] just the way that we've been raised in
[1:30:53] these things it has nothing to do and
[1:30:55] it's just a tradition or preference of
[1:30:57] the way we look at these
[1:30:59] things and that happens and all of a
[1:31:02] sudden you know what God's doing rubbing
[1:31:03] the bumps off of
[1:31:05] us those little lumps of
[1:31:09] humanity and you know what you've got
[1:31:11] them and I've got
[1:31:12] them and it's brotherly
[1:31:15] kindness that Smooths those things
[1:31:18] out where we don't look at those things
[1:31:20] and say well they're not in the message
[1:31:23] they just need a new birth no we need to
[1:31:28] grow and they do too
[1:31:31] probably
[1:31:33] amen what do we
[1:31:35] do we've got people I've run into many
[1:31:39] now and they'll smile to your face and
[1:31:40] stab you in the back when you walk away
[1:31:42] they'll talk good to your face they'll
[1:31:43] talk bad about you when they go out amen
[1:31:46] the they'll say one thing they'll do
[1:31:47] another and it's fellow Believers fellow
[1:31:49] professing Believers and what do we do
[1:31:51] in those situations
[1:31:53] so often the Temptation is to gather the
[1:31:55] scriptures and gather the quotes to
[1:31:58] build a castle of defense that puts them
[1:32:01] in their
[1:32:02] place that's what we tend to do we're
[1:32:04] talking on brotherly kindness now but
[1:32:06] the natural inclination is to fortify
[1:32:08] yourself as to why you're allowed to be
[1:32:11] hurt as to why you're allowed to be
[1:32:12] offended as to why you're allowed to
[1:32:14] separate from fellowship as to why
[1:32:16] you're allowed to not support that
[1:32:17] person as to why you'll never have them
[1:32:18] over again and we build up all the
[1:32:21] quotes about what they did wrong and all
[1:32:22] the scriptures about how they're off the
[1:32:24] word of God and you know what we don't
[1:32:26] do go read every bit of the word that
[1:32:28] tells us how we're supposed to react and
[1:32:31] we sit there on the side of the road in
[1:32:32] the Ivory Tower of our hurt and offense
[1:32:34] because we've got a word reason for it
[1:32:37] all and you know what's happening is
[1:32:39] Satan is coming in and we've got a root
[1:32:40] of bitterness in in our lives and and it
[1:32:42] just takes us completely it takes the
[1:32:44] joy out of our life it kicks the holy
[1:32:46] spirit
[1:32:47] away and we just get bitter and we get
[1:32:49] worn out in these different things why
[1:32:51] cuz it's way easier for me to read about
[1:32:53] why brother brother Bob is wrong than it
[1:32:55] is for how I ought to respond to brother
[1:32:56] Bob for taking my water in the service
[1:32:58] where I was speaking to him so nicely
[1:33:01] right it's way easier to put the burden
[1:33:03] on the other person than ourselves
[1:33:05] brotherly kindness says I'm going to
[1:33:07] take it to me and react the way the word
[1:33:09] tells me to react rather than try and
[1:33:12] correct
[1:33:13] them because if you can respond rightly
[1:33:16] now then you can invite them to come to
[1:33:19] the right place but if you blow up if
[1:33:22] you withdraw them what do they have
[1:33:24] they've got nobody to help them out they
[1:33:25] may not even realize where they're at
[1:33:27] they may not even realize where the
[1:33:28] weakness is they may not even realize
[1:33:30] where they're immature and if you don't
[1:33:32] give the right answer they don't have
[1:33:33] the word but if you can respond rightly
[1:33:36] in meekness remember what Paul says and
[1:33:38] you can come in meekness then maybe
[1:33:40] perhaps God will use you to help them
[1:33:41] out but if we stand in this Castle we
[1:33:44] built of our right to not engage and to
[1:33:47] be hurt we can't help anybody I'm
[1:33:50] sitting on the sidelines and guess what
[1:33:51] I'll stagnate with that root of
[1:33:53] bitterness that root of frustration that
[1:33:55] offense for the rest of my life until I
[1:33:57] make it right with God and go back and
[1:34:00] actually make it right with that brother
[1:34:01] or sister I'll
[1:34:03] stagnate see this is outward looking but
[1:34:05] it does benefit us inwardly when we do
[1:34:07] these things if we've really got it
[1:34:09] remember we're supposed to act
[1:34:10] independent of the person we do what the
[1:34:13] word says regardless of whether they do
[1:34:15] it forgiveness is as much for me as for
[1:34:17] the other person if I don't forgive God
[1:34:20] won't even hear my prayer
[1:34:22] and if God doesn't hear my prayer church
[1:34:24] I don't know where I'd be but it's real
[1:34:26] lonely and it's real cold and it's real
[1:34:28] formal and it's real starchy when I
[1:34:30] can't forgive so these things are for my
[1:34:33] benefit not for theirs but in the end
[1:34:35] they benefit the most because it gives
[1:34:36] them an opportunity to come to a higher
[1:34:38] plane
[1:34:40] amen Paul would say this in Ephesians 4
[1:34:42] as we start to close this is the last
[1:34:45] thing that Paul says in his stature of a
[1:34:46] perfect Man chapter he says let all
[1:34:50] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:34:54] clamor I love that word clamor you know
[1:34:56] what clamor means getting worked up
[1:34:59] getting all up in arms getting riled
[1:35:03] up the world is completely Bound by
[1:35:07] clamor these days they'll take the
[1:35:09] smallest thing and they'll blow it up
[1:35:11] into the biggest
[1:35:13] issue it's an overreaction time and time
[1:35:16] again Paul says get that out of your
[1:35:18] life he says and evil speaking be put
[1:35:21] away from you with all malice and be ye
[1:35:24] kind to one another what does that look
[1:35:26] like brother John well brother Paul says
[1:35:28] it means tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:35:31] another even as God for Christ's sake
[1:35:33] has forgiven you you'll see that
[1:35:35] kindness brotherly kindness is tied to
[1:35:38] forgiveness remember brother brandham
[1:35:40] said when that couple was making
[1:35:42] out he said I forgive
[1:35:45] you don't do it again but the first
[1:35:48] words out of his mouth were I forgive
[1:35:50] you and and you'll see that it's tied
[1:35:52] the same thing in brotherly kindness is
[1:35:53] that we forgive even if they don't ask
[1:35:55] for
[1:35:56] forgiveness that's the key to brotherly
[1:35:58] kindness is that you can forgive you can
[1:36:00] look past you can ignore their actions
[1:36:03] and you just come through and do the
[1:36:04] right thing for their sake not for your
[1:36:06] sake it'll benefit you but it's
[1:36:08] primarily for them not for you brother
[1:36:11] Braham says that's why I want to put all
[1:36:13] my life for the Lord Jesus he says
[1:36:15] everything that I can do for him he says
[1:36:17] and I can only serve him as I serve his
[1:36:19] people you can only love him as you love
[1:36:21] each other I can only love him as I love
[1:36:23] you and you love me and together we love
[1:36:25] God and we become his children in that I
[1:36:27] serve you and you serve me and that's
[1:36:29] how we're serving God Jesus said in so
[1:36:31] much as you've done it unto the least of
[1:36:33] these little ones you've did it unto me
[1:36:35] he says if we want a blessing let's be a
[1:36:37] blessing to somebody else and a blessing
[1:36:40] will return like casting your bread upon
[1:36:42] the Water it'll return and that's true
[1:36:44] in all walks of life you'll find that
[1:36:46] you usually reap just as you show so he
[1:36:48] says so let's do good talk good good and
[1:36:51] be kind and people talk about us we'll
[1:36:54] say good things and kind things and good
[1:36:57] things will come our way if we'll give
[1:36:59] them
[1:37:01] out easy to read hard to do he says how
[1:37:06] you will you know how will the world
[1:37:08] know that you love Jesus when we love
[1:37:10] one another he says that's how the world
[1:37:13] see God sees your faith the world sees
[1:37:16] your actions you know what that means
[1:37:19] actions really do matter because the
[1:37:22] world can listen to your words but
[1:37:24] they're going to judge you by your
[1:37:26] actions so you can have all the good
[1:37:28] intentions in your heart and you can
[1:37:29] have all the right doctrines and you can
[1:37:30] have the word but if you don't act upon
[1:37:32] it then the world is going to call you a
[1:37:34] hypocrite rightly
[1:37:35] so he says the world sees your actions
[1:37:38] love one another now be kind to one
[1:37:40] another talk with one another be patient
[1:37:43] with one another I highlighted that talk
[1:37:46] with one another because so many times
[1:37:47] that's the biggest issue when we're
[1:37:48] coming to brotherly love because we talk
[1:37:50] about one another rather than talk with
[1:37:52] one
[1:37:56] another we talk about the situation
[1:37:58] rather than addressing the situation and
[1:38:01] what happens is we make it bigger we
[1:38:03] magnify the issue rather than minimize
[1:38:06] the issue now the hardest thing to do is
[1:38:08] have a hard conversation with somebody
[1:38:11] you go to somebody remember I told you
[1:38:12] about that brother that I defended and I
[1:38:14] didn't know it and he was treating me
[1:38:16] differently and I didn't know it because
[1:38:17] I'm clueless that way and he called me
[1:38:20] aside before remember and he said I need
[1:38:22] to talk to you and then he told me that
[1:38:24] I'd said something that hurt him and I
[1:38:26] cried and I I said I was sorry and I
[1:38:28] asked his forgiveness and we hugged and
[1:38:29] we made up and everything was good after
[1:38:31] that but I had no idea I'd hurt that
[1:38:33] brother until he came and told
[1:38:36] me but he didn't go tell everyone else
[1:38:38] brother John heard him he came to me and
[1:38:40] he sorted it out and that took courage
[1:38:43] that took courage because as men we
[1:38:44] don't like to say you hurt me we don't
[1:38:47] like to go to somebody and say what you
[1:38:49] did there I feel that was wrong
[1:38:52] but having the conversation what it does
[1:38:54] is it allows you to get to the the the
[1:38:56] motive and the objective rather than
[1:38:58] just the impact if somebody comes to me
[1:39:00] and says brother John you hurt me I'll
[1:39:02] say I'm sorry no matter if what I did
[1:39:04] was right or wrong because I am sorry I
[1:39:07] hurt
[1:39:08] you that doesn't mean I'm sorry for what
[1:39:10] I did but I'm sorry I hurt you and we
[1:39:12] always ought to be able to to apologize
[1:39:14] for the impact of our
[1:39:17] actions not the
[1:39:19] intent remember brother Brown talks
[1:39:21] about the Shepherd that breaks the the
[1:39:22] Sheep's leg keeps wandering away keeps
[1:39:24] wandering away he breaks the leg so that
[1:39:26] he has to carry it all the time so that
[1:39:27] the Sheep becomes dependent and wants to
[1:39:29] be around the shepherd sometimes we do
[1:39:32] things that are hard and it hurts people
[1:39:34] and we can say I'm sorry it hurt you
[1:39:36] even though it was the right thing to do
[1:39:39] but we focus on their hurt rather than
[1:39:41] it's the right thing to
[1:39:45] do brother says this so then you see
[1:39:48] what he did let that be your example in
[1:39:50] the house here that we want to be a
[1:39:52] house that he'll be honored in with
[1:39:54] everything every office every place that
[1:39:57] there be no taking back there be
[1:40:00] gentleness and sweetness and
[1:40:03] kindness he says but just straight on
[1:40:06] the line every man at his post a
[1:40:09] duty you can stay tight with the word
[1:40:12] and not be a
[1:40:14] jerk you can stay tight with the word
[1:40:16] and not intentionally be
[1:40:18] offensive you can do it with sweetness
[1:40:20] with gentl with kindness he says every
[1:40:22] man at his post of Duty see that's the
[1:40:24] way he wants it he never slagged when it
[1:40:26] came time to say and call what was what
[1:40:28] he called
[1:40:29] it right we don't back down remember we
[1:40:32] don't compromise on emotion we don't
[1:40:33] compromise because we understand he says
[1:40:36] but when it come time to show gentleness
[1:40:38] then he showed gentleness he was sweet
[1:40:41] kind understanding but Stern and
[1:40:45] everything was right to the dot with him
[1:40:47] and he did that for your example amen
[1:40:50] amen let's stand together if the
[1:40:52] musicians would
[1:40:58] come brotherly
[1:41:00] kindness the toughest of all of these
[1:41:02] because it puts us squarely in the
[1:41:04] position of showing not just by words
[1:41:06] but by actions how much we value the
[1:41:09] other person rather than
[1:41:11] ourselves and that's the toughest thing
[1:41:13] to do this is we're getting to the place
[1:41:15] of sacrifice and it's only the holy
[1:41:16] ghost that really is a higher level of
[1:41:18] sacrifice than this but when we in love
[1:41:21] gentleness can point to them the way
[1:41:22] they ought to go rather than standing in
[1:41:24] that that that castle we built of our
[1:41:26] hurts and offensive offenses amen it
[1:41:28] seeks
[1:41:30] restoration listen to this it seeks
[1:41:32] restoration rather than
[1:41:33] Reformation because remember brother
[1:41:35] Bron would say you talk about you know
[1:41:37] people in jail and people doing thing
[1:41:38] wrong he says we're not reformers we're
[1:41:41] here to convert you not reform you I
[1:41:43] don't want you to act right because I
[1:41:45] tell you I want you to act right because
[1:41:47] God's working in your life and that's
[1:41:49] what we're doing is we're restoring
[1:41:50] we're trying to bring them back to the
[1:41:51] word of God not back to where I feel
[1:41:53] comfortable or where I feel better or
[1:41:55] where I'm not hurt we're trying to bring
[1:41:57] them back to their position in Christ
[1:41:59] amen and so it seeks to elevate them
[1:42:01] from where they are to where the word
[1:42:03] wants them to be amen and by a right
[1:42:06] response we limit the damage to them
[1:42:08] that's caused by a poor response I I I
[1:42:11] if you do the wrong thing and I respond
[1:42:14] poorly there's no hope for that
[1:42:17] situation but if you do poorly and I do
[1:42:19] correctly There's Hope hope because now
[1:42:22] you're not offended by my
[1:42:25] reaction and I can potentially work with
[1:42:27] you and if I do something wrong and you
[1:42:30] react very nicely to me you know what
[1:42:32] it'll usually shame me and I'll realize
[1:42:35] hey I stepped out of line there and it
[1:42:36] makes it easier for me to come back and
[1:42:38] be restored in those things as well and
[1:42:40] all it is is we're giving each other the
[1:42:41] opportunity to grow as God grows us not
[1:42:44] at the rate that I want listen as a
[1:42:47] pastor I want everyone to grow
[1:42:49] overnight that's the that's what we
[1:42:51] would love wouldn't we love our children
[1:42:53] to just basically be born and within the
[1:42:55] first 3 years just have everything
[1:42:56] worked out that would be our desire but
[1:42:59] that's not the way it works and so that
[1:43:01] that that brotherly kindness that
[1:43:03] patience with where people are at helps
[1:43:06] them grow in a real way rather than a
[1:43:09] forced way and allows God to work with
[1:43:12] them rather than us
[1:43:14] amen it's tough it's tough like I said
[1:43:18] this is the highest this is this is the
[1:43:20] the the high point you can go as a
[1:43:22] Christian before you get the Holy Ghost
[1:43:24] and God's testing us and he tries us you
[1:43:27] take young people you go to school and
[1:43:29] somebody does you wrong somebody says
[1:43:31] something about you sisters you know
[1:43:32] they make fun of your clothes or your
[1:43:34] hair they don't do this and they don't
[1:43:35] do that and the boys won't look at this
[1:43:37] and they won't talk about that and they
[1:43:39] don't like the jokes and they make fun
[1:43:40] of you that's your test of Brotherly
[1:43:43] kindness but then as you get older it
[1:43:45] comes into the church and maybe somebody
[1:43:47] in the church hurts you and what do you
[1:43:49] do do we shut him down do we put him
[1:43:53] away do we dechristianize him or do we
[1:43:55] respond in
[1:43:56] love amen considering ourselves that we
[1:44:00] could just as easily fall into the same
[1:44:01] thing if God pulled his hand of Grace
[1:44:03] away from us amen man it gives us grace
[1:44:05] and patience for the person next to us I
[1:44:08] say God help us amen the next thing is
[1:44:10] the Holy
[1:44:11] Ghost and he's got to build this Temple
[1:44:14] Before He'll take us to that place amen
[1:44:16] let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:44:19] Father Lord what a challenge you've
[1:44:21] placed in front of
[1:44:22] us and Lord looking in the reflection of
[1:44:26] the word Lord seeing my own weaknesses
[1:44:28] many
[1:44:29] times Lord we get frustrated we get
[1:44:31] tired we get weary and then Satan will
[1:44:34] inject something in Lord God I pray that
[1:44:36] you'd raise up a standard in our life
[1:44:38] Lord Jesus Lord I pray that the word
[1:44:40] would cast it out Lord I pray that your
[1:44:42] Holy Spirit would guard us Lord that
[1:44:44] there would be a hedge of protection
[1:44:46] about us Lord that when Satan would try
[1:44:47] and separate us Lord when Satan would
[1:44:49] try and cause Cal conflict or
[1:44:51] misunderstanding Lord that brotherly
[1:44:53] kindness would raise up Lord that there
[1:44:55] be no no friction Lord that there be no
[1:44:58] Schism between us Lord but that we would
[1:44:59] cleave one to another that we be United
[1:45:01] in bonds of Love Lord that we would look
[1:45:04] for the word in each other rather than
[1:45:05] the world Lord and that our hearts would
[1:45:07] be gracious Lord that the mercy and love
[1:45:10] that you've shown us Lord would flow out
[1:45:11] from our lives to those that are around
[1:45:13] us Lord I pray you lift us higher Lord
[1:45:16] give us strength Lord for the day Lord
[1:45:18] strength for the trial and the test
[1:45:21] Lord I pray you help us to just keep the
[1:45:22] faith Lord to look to you as the author
[1:45:24] and finisher of these things Lord bless
[1:45:27] your people now we pray in Jesus
[1:45:28] Christ's name we ask it
[1:45:31] amen let's sing that song Lord prepare
