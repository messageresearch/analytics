heads Heavenly Father Lord there's one thing every believer every Overcomer in every age had to do Lord and that was present the word Lord for their age Lord they had to take your word Lord in faith they had to lay it in their heart Lord they had to speak it in their mouth they had to confess it Lord Lord they had to apply it Lord and then you came right behind it Lord and you put your power behind the word Lord and It produced that very word in their lives and Lord we're laying our lives on the altar Lord we're laying ourselves before you once again this night saying Lord let your word be manifested in each one of us Lord God let us go out tonight Lord just that little bit closer Lord to the Rapture Lord a little further away from this world and this death Lord in this Darkness Lord may we just be drawn closer to you tonight we pray Heavenly Father Lord will you speak bring us Clarity this evening Lord just set us on a firm foundation Lord we pray Lord minister to those that aren't here Lord grant them Grace each one we ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 again second Peter chapter 1 amen certainly want to thank the folkerson for their time here with us and they leave first tomorrow so God bless you be with you certainly greet the folks back there lots of lots of old folks from my past certainly so greet them brother Chris and then of course we've got brother uh brother and sister bagot leaving as well later this week and so we want to say God bless you to you as well bring your our greetings back to the people there and just trusting God will keep you safe and bless you bless your new pastor your church there anden that God would just continue to work in there and we also want to remember the kids are back at school of course this week so remember the kids remember the parents lots of us homeschooling and so we pray especially for the mothers that God will give them grace and patience and strength and energy and then more of each of the same amen amen it's a it's a tough job and you can't overpay your wife you can't overpay a mother that's for sure and yet they do it out of the goodness of their heart and the the grace and the strength that God's put in there so we say God bless our mothers that are Faithfully teaching and the Fathers as they help out of course as well amen second Peter chapter 1 says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the right rightousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now listen to this verse 8 says for if these things be in you and abound amen there's a bounty there's an abounding that comes with this work he says they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ but he that lackthe things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall if I can paraphrase that he's saying this process works it cannot be undone and you will be victorious amen God bless you you can take your seats this evening God bless the reading of his word and we're continuing our series on manifesting time and I want to take a a second service on this idea of building a True Believer and we're still about to dive into this this message and this thought on Statue of a perfect man but I want to take this service and I just want to teach a little bit here and settle us in a bit because before we start going into this idea of the stature of a perfect man what I don't want is you to sit there and think I've got a checklist and I'm going to go through my life and I'm going to check all these things off and until I check it off then I can't get the Holy Ghost I'm not saying that's not true but I'm saying that it's not your checklist it's God's checklist list and he's the one that decides it's not you that decides amen but I don't want you to get into a performance-based Christianity or to think that somehow you've got to wait for something it's all in God's hands and God's going to be the one that decides these things but I what I definitely don't want to do is complicate this because when we're talking statue of a perfect man the thing that comes as the end is Charity which is God's love itself which is the Holy Ghost and so this this whole series on on building a True Believer the stature of a perfect man could really be entitled how to get the Holy Ghost cuz brother r said he remember remember he said in that quote he said this is the the Plan of Salvation this is how to become the dwelling place of God so really the statue of a perfect man is how you get the Holy Ghost but it's it's really a a broaden version of it it's really getting into maybe the nitty-gritty details of all of these things and so Peter here is just giving us half a chapter of instruction on how to get the Holy Ghost how to become the dwelling place of God and that's really the question we have to have it's the most important question you'll ever ask yourself how do I get the Holy Ghost and after that it's do I have the the Holy Ghost but if you don't know how to get it then you probably don't have it amen but we want to go through these things but remember I like I said I want I don't want this to be complicated and if we go back to what Jesus said he said the new birth comes by two things water and spirit water and spirit and so the simple fact is this if you will hear the word if you will accept the word and you will obey the word you'll get the Holy Ghost and that's as simple I think as we can make it and that's all Jesus said it comes by water and it comes by spirit and then on the day of Pentecost Peter said what he gave them the word they accepted the word they acted on the word they got the Holy Ghost and so I don't want to make this into some big kafuffle here I don't want to make it into this this big ordeal but but Peter's giving us some details in these things a and the prophet comes behind and maybe expands it even more than Peter did to show you this is the process that a child of God goes through before they get the Holy Ghost before they're really pulled into the kingdom of God Amen and so you can't just take a portion you can't take a portion of the word at any time but you got to take the full word to get the the full result I me you can't pick and choose and that's where we see Christianity Today socalled is that people are picking and choosing the portion of the word that they want and guess what if you take a portion of the word you only get a portion of the results and we can't get out of here with a portion we've got to have a full portion amen we've got to have an overflowing portion which is the word dwelling within us and producing himself through the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Bron would say this in the message of paradox and I want you remember I said last service I had 36 pages of notes 35 pages of notes and only two pages come from statue of a perfect man and that's because I want to show you out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses I don't just want to preach out of a single message but I want to preach across the depth of the message to show you that brother brandham is emphatic in the points that I'm about to make and and the things that I'm trying to Anchor in this evening he says this in the message of paradox he says I believe that every Born Again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves he says because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a par Parx is a miracle he says unless that happens you cannot be a Christian now let me say this when you're born in the message there's still got to come A change when you get a new birth there has to come a new change because you're still a child of Disobedience and we'll talk about this in a bit you're still under the nature of a child of Wrath and so there has to be a change and no matter how good you are how obedient you are to your parents how Faithfully you attend church whatever it is there has to be a change when you truly become a Christian when you truly get the new birth because you can't be what you were you can't be what you were he says cuz no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of God you can get a spirit in you Satan's trying to put many spirits inside of you but he says nobody can give you a new birth except it's God and give you a new spirit he said cuz God Alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking his ways his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it so every one of us is supposed to be a paradox it's supposed to be a miracle where people say she used to be this and now she's that and how did it happen it seemed like almost overnight it happened and she used to be this and now she's that or he was this and now he acts that way and what he used to do he doesn't do and what he didn't used to do now he does it what is it it's a paradox it's a it's a complete miracle and so as we go through this I'm going to take a page from brother Mark's uh you know way of doing things and I'm going to draw diagram and I want to draw a diagram because I want you to see how everything fits in so don't worry about catching everything that's here CU we're going to go stage by stage tonight I'm just going to take my time and teach this as we go through it but but I want you to notice some things on this graph as we go and so the first thing you have is this main line going through the middle and it's red at the start and then it goes into green and this is this is your your life and it represents time but as we look at this you'll see that most of those segments I've drawn are roughly equal I had to fit it within the page so some of them are a bit shorter but but I don't want you to think that the length of time for all of these periods of your life are exactly the same the length of the line is irrelevant in terms of the graph some of us are children of Disobedience until we're 35 40 50 60 70 remember that woman brother brandham led to the Lord at 92 her her her graph of this would be a straight line of a child of Disobedience and then she basically went straight up into heaven God can do it God's Sovereign and that's why I don't want to complicate this I don't want to draw this into some big you know massive process and you think You' just got to spend 18 years or 25 years or 30 years before you get the Holy Ghost no that's not the way it is at all but you'll understand here that the length of the line is irrelevant in each of these portions that's going to be in some cases up to you and in some cases it's going to be up to God but some people are that as soon as they hear the word they hear it and they're convicted and they obey it and they accept it and they apply it and then they go and and and very quickly they'll get the Holy Ghost and very soon after that God places them and they're adopted Sons and Daughters of God and some of us are more prideful or or we don't learn lessons very well or we like pain or whatever it is we got something that we just like too much about this world and so we're dragged out in some of these and it takes us a long time but usually what happens is we finally learn the lesson then we move quickly into the next portion and then hopefully we've learned that lesson and so the next bits go a little bit quicker as we go along but what we have now on this graph now this is the graph of your life and above it I've put all the events or actions and these are key things that happen or are done in your life some of them are based on you and some of them are based on God so the line is what's happening and then if you look below that you get the results and that's the the effect of what you did above the line so you see there we have things like conviction dying out getting filled with the Holy Ghost adoption Rapture these different things those are events but the effect of those events is what follows in the line that comes after it and that's what's shown underneath it and then I have blue dots here and these are the pivotal moments these are these are Junctions in time brother Brandon would talk about these are conferences with God where you've got to make a decision you've got to make a decision many times and and based on your decision then God acts on it okay so that's what what we're looking at as we go through here okay so so if you look at these blue dots if you don't do what God wants you to do then what happens is you go around the mountain one more time you go around the desert one more time and he comes back and he lets you make that choice again and if you don't make it he sends you around the desert one more time until you get sick and tired of walking around the desert and then you do what he finally wants you to do and they says praise the Lord you say praise the Lord I finally figured it out and you move on into the next stage of your Christian walk but brother man would say this he said Lily he said consider it how it grows toils has to bring itself up this Little Pond Lily look where it come through dirt mck mud Muddy Waters and dirty Waters don't worry where you come from worry where you get worry where you get cuz that's all that really matters he says it pressed its way through all of those all of that this little germ of Life working itself from the bottom of the pond where the frogs and things are at and and then brings itself up through all of that but when it gets in the presence of the sun it's born that little sea bursts open into life it cannot do that until it goes through all that process it's got to come through that that's what makes it is because the sun itself is what's drawing it what is it he's talking about what the presence of the sun it's the atmosphere it's the drawing of the Holy Spirit that's pulling that life out of you and bringing you up to where you can truly live he says and when it gets fully above all the dirty Waters and muck and so forth then it's so happy it just gives its life out freely and it's a beautiful type when it when it gets in the presence of that which is drawing it up he says I think that's a beautiful type of Christian Life when something is drawing you out of the world until one day you're born right into its Presence by the Holy Spirit he says how beautiful but he says if you try to help it you kill it in other words he says the process has a purpose so don't try and shortcut it don't try and go around it don't try and but just go right through it just stick right through it so if we go back to this this this graph and this is how to get the Holy Ghost this is how to become the dwelling place of God this is is is what the new birth looks like and and what it does when you get it so on the lower left here we stop and we look here and we see we're we're children of Disobedience our our nature our attitude our mind our thoughts our flesh everything is contrary to God and Ephesians 2 says this wherein in times past ye walk according to the curse of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience that was our spirit Ephesians is our book Ephesians is our book so we are under the nature of the children of Disobedience it says among whom also we had our conversation our life in Times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so that's our starting place and I I don't care if you're born in a message home or if you're born to a drug dealing parent out on the street you are a child of Wrath a child of Disobedience every single one of us in your human nature in your human nature okay doesn't matter how good you look that's where you are but what happens now we see above it we see an event or an action what is it it's God rich in Mercy comes and he sends his word to us that's the only thing that God has that he can do is he can send his word to you because the scripture says he sent his word and he healed all our diseases the word does the work that's required in our lives amen and it does two things to a person it either convicts them or it condemns them now we're talking to Children Of God here tonight so for us we have this pivotal moment number one and what is it it's conviction because we're convicted by the word not condemned we hear it and what it does is we hear it and we hear the remedy not just the con condemnation in it but we say there's a way out of where I am and so what happens is that conviction leads us to do the right thing remember in chapter 2 when the Peter comes down and he starts preaching to the people there it says they were pricked in their hearts they were convicted and they said what do we do about this conviction cuz condemnation you'll just walk away conviction keeps you there and says how do I fix it and so they said what did we have to do and he says repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and what happened is as soon as they hear that they repent they changed their ways they obey the word word and they're baptized and all of a sudden there's no more condemnation they don't have to worry about it it's all washed away brother BR would say this he says first repent of your sins your unbelief that you've disbelieved these things notice what he says your unbelief that you disbelieved these things that it was here all along and you didn't believe it you got to repent for that he says repent and then be baptized and then the guide will take you from there on see that's your duty now listen to this CU I want you to see you've got a duty and then God's got a duty he says it's your duty to repent it's your duty to be baptized but after this he says then it's the God's duty to take you from there on lead you from virtue to knowledge to Temperance to patience to Godliness to brotherly love and the Holy Ghost seals you see he says then you're a full stature of God a real man of God a real woman of God anchored away in Christ so you repent you're baptized and what happens is is what you receive the word you accept the word rather and what happens there is that you accept the finished work of Calvary and in doing so you're baptized you die to your old nature and then what happens is you get a new a new heart and a new spirit and that inclines you now towards the things of God Amen Jesus said if you go this far you're saved you have eternal life he that believeth on me he's saved and brother BR would say it over and over again it's what Jesus said doesn't mean you're a part of the Bride like I've said doesn't mean you're part of the elect but you accept the finished work of Calvary you go this far and you've got eternal life now you may have to go through a tribulation but you have eternal life we'll see you on the other side one way or the other why because you've accepted the finished work of Calvary and you've had faith in the work that he did there and you've acted upon it but now you do that and you've got a new heart and a new spirit you're saved if we could put it that way and you come to this pivotal moment number two and this is the biggest thing you'll ever do in your life church this entire series of of the Statue of a perfect man or this thought is tied to this next thing and it's that you die out and this is the hardest part of your Christian walk that you'll ever face is dying out because once you've accepted the finished work of Calvary and he gives you a new heart and a new spirit now there's got to come A Change you've turned around you're facing another way but you got to keep walking in that way you got to take the word and you've got to apply the word and you've got to let it have an effect in your life and that means you've got to die out and you'll see that as we go through this series that every single virtue that he talks about in terms of the Statue of a perfect man is tied to how much you will die out every single one of these things just comes back to this point everything comes back to dying out brother B would say it this way he says I'll say today if man will dump out all this nonsense of carrying on and impersonating Christianity and let the Holy Ghost take its place then there will be a Revival start on eth and Penn Street that will sweep the whole country he says quit the non sense get back to the word of God now listen to what he says here dump out that you might fill up you let go and God will let come you dump out God will fill in all the petty things of you got to do this you got to do that you ought to do this and you ought to do that forget it dump it out of your soul that's why I said this is not a performance-based Christianity but you die out he said you got to do this you got to do that what's he talking about legalism but he says you die out and something's going to happen that brings in the things that you need you've got to die out now listen to what he says say God let me from this day be holy thine Lord I come with a broken heart I come with a contrite spirit I love you you know I love you and I want to forget all this foolishness of all these 40-day fasts and see if I can get closer to God and all this that all the other all this nonsense he says stop it there's nothing in the world tells you to have a 40 in the word that tells you to have a 40-day fast not a thing there's nothing in the world telling you to fast less God would tell you he says if you fast you ain't going to get hungry and go all these things now he's referring to brother to to Jesus when Jesus fasted 40 days in the wilderness he wasn't hungry until he was done his fast and and brother Bam's saying that if you go on a fast and it's God that's telling you to do it you won't even be hungry throughout it what's he trying to do he's trying to break people out of a religious habit and get them into an inspired action cuz Jesus said there's some demons won't count ex come out except by prayer and fasting that tells me there's a time for fasting but you got to be inspired to do it not just have it by ritual he says as you are fasting brother you'll be joy and happy all the time he he refers to scripture says don't appear before men like Hypocrites do with a long sad face I'm on a 40-day fast my plates won't fit me anymore I've lost 30 PBS and they told me I look better after this is over he says oh nonsense it's enti ing spirits of the devil he says now watch this get up on the Altar and say Glory Glory Glory till you can hardly say anything else and say you got to speak in tongues before you get the Holy Ghost he says nonsense dump it out get that out of your system and come on the word of God he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if God don't keep his word he's not God Amen dump out get filled up amen W he says I love that that's his word God said so that's right and when God said it God will take care of it all right now watch he says all the preparations you make all the going to church you can do he's not saying don't do it he's saying that's not how you get it he says it's just like going down here to the car Works where they build a build big bunch of Passenger cars he's talk about trains I used to work there and they take and build these big coaches and everything they put hardwood inlaid mahogany all around and everything's so beautiful set it out there on the track and it was as dead as a doornail there set the engine no steam in it she just sat there he says what it needs today is some fire in the boiler what it needs today is some steam what it needs today the church to boil he says the hottest boiling thing there is to boil sin out of your life is love you can't love one another how you going to love God who you haven't seen love hides a multitude of sin get in love with God then you'll love one another then you'll love the church you'll love the cause you'll love everything that's Godly and you'll keep away from the things of the world that's a that's a One-Stop shop right there you'll love one another you'll love the church you'll love the cause you'll love everything that's Godly and you'll keep away from the things of the word I say God give me more love give me more love if it's going to have that effect give me more of that that's the kind of stuff I want in my life brother van would say this he'd say you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith then virtue and these other things is added to you until you're a perfect living image of God like I said earlier if you die out to yourself you'll find that these virtues that Peter talks about in second Peter 1 just start to develop naturally I'm not saying that it won't be in I'm not saying it's going to be enjoyable dying out ain't fun rotting isn't fun humbling isn't Fun killing Pride isn't fun cuz this entire body wants to hold on to those things but there's an inner man in there that's crying out to be reborn it's trying to be made into the image of God and so it's fighting to bring everything else under subjection amen you're letting go of so many things and when you let go what comes with that often is a feeling of helplessness and that's the hardest thing for a Believer to do is let go because what you're doing is you're giving up your rights and in Le oia rights are all that they care about and what you're saying as a Christian is I give up my rights I give up my right to be offended I give up my right to be hurt I give up my right to stand up for myself I give up my right to lash out at people I lay it all down so that Christ's love can flow through me amen amen but notice something when you do something it has an effect when you do something but when God does something it has a supernatural effect so what you do naturally God comes right behind it and he steps in he does the supernatural but you've got to let go that's your choice it's your decision it's your duty are you going to let these things go amen you notice that all the events and actions are on top of the line are based on the word and we'll see this as as we get back to this in a minute but you choose based on what faith in God's word and then the word comes right behind it and it does what you've taken Faith to act on you started with your faith God finishes it by going to work through word what's he saying you want to get the Holy Ghost first thing you got to do here is die out dump out dump out I've said this before I we've been well taught here I came in and when I got the holy ghost at the age of 17 I had lots of ideas I had lots of doctrines well taught but I had to let every single one of those things go and pull them back through the filter of a newborn Son of God you have to because let me tell you your perspective is wrong no matter how well you've been taught how good you think you are it's got to come back through the filter of the Holy Spirit cuz that's what quickens the word that's what quickens the word and so you're going to have to die out to some things you thought about in the scriptures as well things that you thought that brother Bram said or what he meant through different things but what if you'll humble yourself to the word then the word through the holy spirit will come back and turn you into a True Believer brother Brown would say this in the message hear you him he says and men today is constrained by the Holy Spirit to come and love him and serve him for he's seeking such to do that God is looking for someone who will stand out on the front line with great power and boldness tremendous gifts discernment third pole Authority does he say any of that there he says who will stand out on the front line with one thing love love it's the the the defining trait the defining feature of God is that he is love he says not with no education I'm not trying to support my ignorance but I am trying to say that it doesn't take scholar ships it takes a surrendered heart that God Can Make Love he says you don't know the Bible half as good as the devil does what he's saying is you can study your way and the devil will twist you around like a knot no problem no problem because he's been studying it for an awful long time compared to us hasn't he but he can't get past Revelation but he can twist you in knots with the scripture if you let him do it so what happens after this you die out and what happens when you die out is as you die out you're obeying the word amen and it's the sanctification process and as we've said before this is a work of the Holy Spirit just like all other aspects are and what is it it's God's spirit striving with you it's striving because there's a battle there because you don't have the Holy Ghost yet and so your nature is there and it wants to hold on and the holy spirit's wooing and it's calling and it's pulling and sometimes it's pushing and occasionally it's kicking to get you to do the right thing to get you to see what's going on so you'll let go so that what the sanctification process can go on and these Christian virtues that he talks about the Statue of a perfect man can step into US amen you can't say that you've died out and then not obey the word it's impossible how can you have died out and then stick to what you think rather than what the word thinks whether what the word says the word doesn't think the word is it's an absolute it's true it just is and so how can you elevate yourself above it if you've died out if you've died out then the word automatically takes preeminence in these things now this is often where we see a bit of a a span of time you know you look at the accept the word and justification that is theoretically just something that can happen like that that that really is I believe that it's something that's virtually instantaneous but now we get into this next portion of sanctification and this can take years or it could be literally the work that that was already going on in in some form or fashion if you're a religious person if you've been raised in a Christian Home sanctification has been going on most of your life whether you realize it or not so you're already mostly cleaned out in many ways you might have a few habits that you've been hiding from your parents or these different things or your spouse even but but most of your life is generally cleaned out so this can be a a short period or a long period but or a short work or a long work if I can put it that way but it's going to depend on two things first thing is what's your position in the body of Christ what is God preparing you to do what is your purpose in the kingdom and if you're in a position of Greater Authority then God traditionally is going to work with you a lot longer and he's going to work a lot deeper if I can put it that way why because you've got to be perfectly prepared for the authority that you're going to be given for the responsibility that you're going to have for the gift that you're going to have whatever it's going to be the greater The Authority the the greater the responsibility the greater the cleaning that has to happen in these things why cuz your character has to be tested and proven before God can put Power there we said it before power without character is what satanic but Power with character is fit to rule that's what brother brandham said so look at this in second timothy2 it says nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth so there's all different ones there's one with high honor and low honor ones that are used for certain things and ones that are used for other things he says and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he's talking about the bad things he talked about earlier in the chapter he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use ready for the Master's use acceptable for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work so in other words if this sanctification process has its Pur perfect work then when you're done you're ready for your use whatever God has determined remember he says the Lord knows them that are his and if he knows you're his then he knows what your purpose is as well and so his only work is to prepare you for your purpose in the kingdom of God cuz you're going to produce an element of the word that nobody else can do and so he's preparing you for that specific thing so if the man's life is Sanctified he'll be prepared appropriately for his end purpose and position by the washing of Water by the word and then Tim Paul says to Timothy flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart so I want you to look at it this way because there are different levels of clean and and the wives would say just between us and our husbands we know there are different levels of clean she'll say go clean the kitchen and we clean the kitchen and then they come behind to us it's clean and they say that ain't clean they say can you clean up the bathroom before the guests come over we clean it up and they go in and they clean it all over again don't they but we're talking about being fit for purpose and so if you have a mechanic that's working on a car and you look at his tools tools don't have to be clean now anybody that has any sort of semblance of respectability in their in their job is going to keep their tools as clean as possible because that's how they stay in good working order and they do a better job when they're clean but you don't go to your mechanic and say how clean are your tools before he works on your car why because your car is filthy especially in new land it's covered in Rust he's going to have to use a torch on half the parts anyways half the things are going to break all you care is are they strong enough to get the job done and does he know what he's doing you don't care how clean his tools are so if there's a smudge of grease on here or some dirt or rust on the tools we don't care people won't even notice dirt after a mechanic's done his work his tools are clean but they're clean for a mechanic's work but now you go to a guy that does woodworking or maybe he's he's building furniture or something his tools have to be much cleaner because he's working now on something that's going to be uh inside the house it's out of the elements people are going to sit on it people are going to look at it and you're going to notice if your if your your furniture or your your couch or something has a dark smear of dirt or grease on it cuz he didn't keep his tools clean aren't you he's working with a product that's going to show and hold on to dirt a whole lot more and so his tools have to be that much cleaner than a mechanic's but now you go to a Chef's kitchen and he's got tools just like everybody else but a chef's tools have to be that much more clean don't they because now he's working with food now he's working with something that you don't just maybe sit but now he's talking working on something that goes inside of you and when things go inside of you they have to be very clean and so a chef's knives they have to clean them after every use because otherwise they can cross contaminate can't they and if he goes and he cuts a piece of raw chicken and then goes and cuts something that's going directly without being baked then what happens that bacteria will get transferred onto the food you eat it it can make you very sick it give you food poisoning and in the worst case it can kill you a chef that works with unclean tools with unclean knives and these different things can literally kill a person or make them very sick so there's a different level of cleaning for a chef's a Chef's Equipment doesn't it they've got to put it and they got to scrub it in really hot water and lots of soap and they got to run it through a a high-grade you know uh washing uh dishwasher and all these different things why because the impact of the dirt is much more is much higher than it's just a mechanic with dirty tools but then you step into an operating room and they're using knives just like a chef uses they're using drills just like a literally you look at some of these things on YouTube where they're doing it and they've got literally a DeWalt drill in some cases they're using the exact same thing that the Carpenter and the woodworker or even the chef might use but you talk about clean an operating room is the Apex it's the peak of cleanliness because there if anything is dirty people die they get infections and then they they might die or else they do die why everything they use has to have no bacteria no dirt no uncleanliness what whatsoever it has to be perfect and so they boil the instruments they clean the instruments they use a special antiseptic soap and then they use an ultrasonic cleaner now I know a bit about ultrasonic cleaners cuz I want to get one because they make things clean that you can't clean any other way and do you know how they do it they take sound waves and they vibrate everything that's on that object and they shake it loose and you don't have to do anything you literally just sit in there and it's goes go and it's shaking all the dirt all the bacteria everything out of it and it cleans it in the way way that nothing else can you can't clean it that much if you scrub it you could scrub it all day and never get it as clean as an ultrasonic cleaner will cuz it's shaking loose anything that wasn't there in the original God's got an ultrasonic cleaner doesn't he what is it it's the washing of Water by the word and what is it doing it's shaking loose everything that'll fall apart as soon as you get on the journey and so the cleaner you got to be the more Sanctified you got to be for your role the deeper that word's got to clean there's things that some people are God allows them to do cuz it doesn't matter in the role they're in and then he'll take the next one he'll say you can't do that remember Jesus said he says I sanctify myself for their sake there are things that we ought to sanctify for the sake of those that are beneath us and when I say beneath us I mean those that we're raising our children these different things we ought not to have such a liberty that we would bring something dirty into their lives we might be able to handle it but if they can't handle it we ought not to do it we sanctify ourselves for their reason but what is it there some of us are called to do surgical procedures by the word of God and that means means your life has to be Sanctified cuz otherwise what gets into it is your idea your preference you're doing it for yourself rather for them and what happens is that taints the whole thing you can kill somebody like that you can cause an injury you can you can get them to leave you can offend them in s sort of a way but every tool every person I've mentioned here has clean tools but clean is a relative term you'll find that's what Timothy's even talking about is we've got different ones that are at a certain level and then other ones and Jesus would talk about some of us we have a 30-fold return some of us are 60-fold and some of us are 100-fold and each one of us is cleaned and prepared for that purpose and I believe the greater the purpose the greater the return but remember brother bam says God will train a man for his entire life for 15 minutes of work but that's all you've got to do and you've got to be ready and prepared and clean for that moment listen under the blood we're all the same cleanliness don't don't think for a second I'm saying that brother Bob's cleaner than sister Selena who's cleaner than Sister Kim who's cleaner than brother Matt no no no we're not talking about that we're talking about sanctification for preparation for use under the blood we're all perfectly clean we are sinless we are spotless we are wrinkle-free there is no difference I'm not doing this to elevate one or the other but I'm saying God has to use people in different ways and he's got to prepare people to a higher level than others in some cases amen some people have to be further away from the world than others if I can just make it that simple so the first thing is what what is your position that's going to determine how long this this sanctification process is but the second thing is what's your attitude what's your attitude towards the word of God cuz if you're rebellious sanctify if is going to take a real long time if you're prideful dying out in sanctification is going to take the longest time you can ever imagine pride is the killer to the Christian walk brother Braham said humility is power with God pride is nothing pride comes before a fall that's all Pride's good for making you trip up and fall over so your attitude your approach is going to determine how long this takes because if you do it easy God will give it to you easy you go hard God will make it hard it's your decision it's your choice it's the way you approach it brother Bram says it this way he says then God representing his church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to be his son to go in that bride he has also brought the bride through these ages till he brings this one complete Church into this he says my feet move why cuz my head says so now it can't move like my hand cuz it's my feet Luther can't do the things we did neither can the Methodist because they were something else see the feet moves because the head said so and the head never says now feet you become hand ear you become eyes in other words I don't get to tell you what to be and who to be in the kingdom of God I've got my place you've got your place and you're positionally placed by the father and I'm positionally placed by the father I don't positionally place you and you don't positionally Place me and I can't say you're not like me therefore you're wrong and you can't say brother John you're not like me therefore you're wrong you can't do it why each one of us is shaped and prepared for a certain place and position and purpose in the body of CHR Christ it's the holy spirit that places us not the pastor not the preacher not Mommy not Daddy not the church nothing he says but each age God has placed these things into his church and patterned it by showing that each individual has these and possesses these qualities he's talking about the Statue of a perfect man and this being when it's completed is the Church of God going to the Rapture so he says you've got individuals and then the individuals come together form the body the being and he says that's the Church of God that's going into Rapture and this being individual and completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the Rapture so there's a working on the entire body and then there's a working on the individuals you and I inside of this he says see what I mean there you are there's the full thing so you're just a little piece in the big body but you've got to be prepared just like everybody else so that the body comes into its perfect headship he says here comes a man Paul laying the foundation irius began to pour this onto it the next one poured this the next one poured this next one that this and that on down till it comes to the last age he says but what is it it's the same Spirit The Same Spirit that dwells in me says hands reach after that case the same spirit says feet make a step see what I mean then the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things what these virtues but it cannot be completely controlled till it completely possesses these qualities in other words Christ can't take full control unless the qualities are there in the first place that's in Statue of a perfect man then he comes out on and hear ye himym this is 5 years previous he says God is looking for time tested Christians time tested Christians so that means there's a time I can't tell you how long but there's a time for testing every son that comes to God must be tried child trained and tested and you who jump from pillar to pul and this to that and in and out how can God ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you now think of that for a moment how can you be positionally placed when you will not stand still long enough for God to do it dying out when you're dying out you don't do a whole lot of moving around you ever been so sick you couldn't move that's what dying out ought to feel like you're standing there and you're just letting it all out and then he's got to fill it back in not a lot of running around when you're dying out because you don't feel like anything CU you're rotting you're dying out everything's passing away old things are becoming new so things are going away and new things are coming up you're not going to be doing a bunch of running around in this but there comes a point where you get those qualities those the these these things in the Statue of perfect man and it's God that decides it not you and not me I don't decide it for myself and I don't decide it for you and you don't decide it for me why because God looks at the heart God always looks at the heart God can see things in you and I that we don't see in ourselves and he'll say it's there and we don't even realize it's there absolutely God's Sovereign he knows he can see these different things now you may not realize you have it and God will say that's it you're done and I can give you the Holy Ghost now sometimes you think you got and God says you you ain't got it let's go around the mountain one more time and you sit there and you say why do I keep going around and around and around cuz you don't have it yet you haven't figured out the problem you haven't humbled yourself you haven't died out to something so God says let's do this one more around the mountain around the desert wherever he's taking you he's got to get you to the point where you'll you'll fully die out he says in Blasphemous names he says God is building in seven Church ages a bride for Christ through the Philadelphian tharan pergamus sman and Ephesus a church age that Jesus said if the bridegroom came in the first first watch or the seventh watch all these virgins awakened they were they awoke The Virgins of Ephesus Smyrna pergamos tharus Sardis Philadelphia and Lea did you notice that he said it was the seventh age when he came and woke up those sleeping virgins that brings them all the way back down to here and he's showing the statue of a perfect man he says for in these through these years and ages he has built a bride he has borne a bride and he has begotten a bride on Earth for Christ he has begotten he's born and he's built three different things going on there he says in the same way that he begets this bride he has begot individuals so he's building up a bride body but now he says he's doing the same thing in individuals he says now these things these Virtues Of second Peter 1 he says here absolutely must be in the Christian before the holy ghost ever seals him before this comes down on top and makes a complete Unity he's talking about Christ coming down the head the top of the pyramid he says You must have these qualities before you get the Holy Ghost absolutely he's emphatic about it now I can't put a timeline on your life and I can't put it on mine amen but the prophet is adamant that you can't get the Holy Ghost unless you got the Christian virtues inside of you God has to do a work in your life and it's a working of the Holy Spirit we've talked about these things now that might seem unfair you say well how am I supposed to do that how am I supposed to be Godly without God look at the old teston none of them in the Old Testament had the Holy Ghost and yet you'll go through and you'll see it even as we get into this message on Statue of a perfect man brother Brandon will use Old Testament Saints to give give it uh examples of second Peter 1 virtues so you don't they didn't have the Holy Ghost but yet they have virtues you want Faith they got a whole chapter of people in the Old Testament that had Faith you see ones that have brotherly kindness You' got ones that have virtue all these different things it's all in the Old Testament that's just the nature the characteristics of God being drawn out of that c Gene inside of you by the presence of the Holy Spirit by the Brewing of the holy spirit it's bringing out what's inside you in the first place so that God can come in and inhabit it that's all that's going on they had it you look at I mean how many of the Great Heroes of the faith are in the Old Testament you'd say I wish I was like David or I wish wish I was like Ruth or whatever hopefully nobody wants to be like Rab in terms of her entire life but in certainly in how she responded to the word we should we should be like rahab's that when we hear it we lay hold of it and we get our family in brother baham said when you get the token he says you want to get everybody else to get the token you got a desire to get everybody else in the house to get them safe under that token that's a Ministry for every one of us regardless get people to get what you've got because he says if you got it you'll be convinced and concerned for others as well amen but he says it what before this comes down on top and makes them a complete unit they had these virtues under an imperfect atonement under the blood of bulls and goats like I said brother br will use it we'll see as we get into this as as he preaches on Statue of a perfect man so these things are part of being a Christian but it is not the infilling of the Holy Ghost but it's a work of the Holy Ghost but when you have it then you have this pivotal moment and what is it it's getting filled with the Holy Ghost it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the infilling of the spirit whatever you want to call it and it's the greatest moment of your entire life because this is the Capstone this is the ceiling of the finished work this is the baptism into the body of Christ this is where you are sealed to the day of your total Redemption it's a finished work from there you never have to worry you're not going into tribulation you've already passed from death into life you've already been judged you're under the blood you're Perfect You're spotless you have the character and now he comes on top of you and he seals it and it's God saying you're good to go you've got what I need inside of you now I'm going to come in and I'm going to dwell in you and what happens after that is you live a life that you couldn't live before not that you couldn't live a Christian life but now you're living the Christian life now you're you're acting in ways that you never could before now listen God can take 10 years to give somebody the Holy Ghost and God can take God can give it to you in a moment and as we get into scriptures we'll see is I don't speak for God he's Sovereign and I don't know all the ins and outs but there are people that get it faster and there are people that get it slower and that's just the way it is don't worry how long it takes just worry do I have it and if you don't have it stay there till you get it that's all I think I can say on that but brother BR would say this and blasphemous names he says now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God so remember we talked about that that full service on New Birth versus born again and all these different things this what he's talking about he's saying when you've accepted Christ as your savior he says and has proven to have these virtues in him that God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him or places him now brother bam will say at different times he'll say sealing and placing happen at the same time and then he splits them up in other places and we'll take it into the scriptures and you'll see there's some places where people got the Holy Ghost and were immediately adopted and there's places where people got the Holy Ghost and then God did a work with them to train them and then he adopts them and we see it in well I won't go into it I don't want to give don't want to give it all away amen but he says God seals him or places him he says and there that's when you see the Sons and Daughters of God that's when you're truly a Son of God that's where you see a Son of God manifest if we can put it that way he says then Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption he says now some of you Baptists want to go on eternal security Now if you'll come to that stage if you'll come to this place he says I'll stand with you it's eternal security if if you'll come to this place what get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says but just to say anybody says I've joined the Baptist Church I'm a presbyter and I got eternal security he says that's wrong now that means nothing to us but if you say I attend a message church and I've accepted a prophet that's just as wrong as what the Baptists are saying why because you got to have the life lots of people can nod their head and say yes I believe it but can you live it can you be it not just live it but can you be it can you be the embodiment of the message not just nod your head and say that amen you don't you don't rest on you don't rest on what you know you got to rest on who you know and then the thing is lots of people thought they knew him at the end day and he said I never knew you so the biggest thing is does he know you has he identified himself with you he says your own life proves you haven't got it until this is there and God has adopted you and sealed you by the Holy Ghost into his kingdom then there is no getting out of it you are eternally secure believe he says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby all you and your Godly virtues are sealed until the day of redemption he says I believe there's a bride that's predestinated I believe God said he would have a a church without spot or wrinkle I believe in predestination that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there he says I hope I'm with her that see I'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with God until these things are approved of God and then sealed into the kingdom of God there is the holy spirit he says there is the genuine works of God it's sealed until the day of redemption because sealed is what it's a it's a completed work it's a finished work it's got the the stamp of approval he would say add to your faith and virtue and so forth all this in second Peter I believe the first chapter where it's all added to your faith all these things godliness Purity Holiness everything he says and then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost he says it over over and over and over and over again out of the mouth are two or three Witnesses I I pick the best ones to do this but he says it over and over again there has to be a working to draw out the Christian virtues in your life before he gives you the Holy Ghost so what is the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost is the living word for your day because if you have what they have on the day of Pentecost under their message that ain't going to work today we preach the same thing but it has a different effect on us cuz they went down we go up so it's got to be the living word for your age which is what it's the word made flesh the holy spirit is the word made flesh that's what Christ was so you've got to be the same thing and so it's the life of God in you it's the Dynamics of the word of God for your age inside of you it's the Living Word inside of you it's Christ himself making you live what he said would be in this age brother B puts it this way all the way back in 1955 church he was a prophet way before 1963 he says well preaching the word is the acorn but making it live is the gospel he says that's right if he promised the Holy Spirit that's the word he says and receiving the holy spirit is making it live manifested if he promises Blessings by the word then accepting and the word and producing what it said is the gospel he says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature so you get the Holy Ghost and what is it you receive the Living Word that's what the Holy Ghost is is it's the word living in you for your age and for your time and that's where you live in a place in a way in a place that you've never lived before absolutely cuz now God's dwelling in you now God's dwelling in you you have to raise up if God dwells in us and nothing changes then what does that tell us about God he has no effect he's not Supernatural he's not greater than the thing that we had before amen but doesn't mean you weren't admirable doesn't mean you weren't a Christian brother BR would never say you weren't a Christian but he'd say now you're a true Christian now you're the real deal now you're the manifested Sons and Daughters of God what is it it's not that you couldn't be used before and we'll see this as we get into adoption now you couldn't be a blessing not that you didn't have gifts before this but now you're placed positionally and now you've got what a real job to do you've got a real purpose and God starts to use you and place you into these different things scripture says what sons of God are led by the spirit of God so if nothing else you're LED different than you were LED before you could hope for it before this now you got it and now there's something in the control tower that's moving us around now I don't want to give away some of the the beautiful things I've been studying just yet but we tend to think as soon as we're doing the father's business see what I say here it says doing the father's business but underneath I put servant I didn't put son because we look at this and we say as soon as we're about the father's business we're adopted and yet brother Brandon would say time and time again especially as he preached the message he you him many times he would say that being about the father's business was part of the training and he says the the the tutor comes back and says he's about your father's business he's about your business he's about your business over and over again and remember he says while he's under the tutor he's no different than a servant so he's not a servant but he's no different than a servant you always were a son you always were a daughter of God but in this form even with the Holy H ghost there's still a Time approving and for some people it's very short and for some people it's very long again we'll see this as we get into the scriptures amen but in fact the the focus of the son on the father's business was what determined if he was mature enough and ready enough for adoption we'll find out as we get into this a little bit let's let me talk about this a bit as brother BR would say he says let God add to the church let God give to the church see those gifts are in the church right here in this morning is Gifts of speaking in tongues Gifts of Prophecy there's Gifts of everything sitting in here but if you'll just not go to hanging after that gift he says if you do you're going to get the gift without the giver you're going to go back to Pentecost I mean Pentecost isza Street he says see the thing of it is seek after God he says seek after love of God in your heart and then as God wants you he'll move you into whatever he wants you to do see that's it that's how the church is put in order that's 1954 he says that so we look at this let me take us back just for a second so when you get the Holy Ghost brother Brown says that's when the biggest battles start he says you think you that it's just a cakewalk or or that after the Holy Ghost says no that's when it starts because Satan has been kicked out of your life the control tower is full and it's sealed and he can't get in there so Satan knows once you got the Holy Ghost what he's dealing with and so every gun in Hell Comes now against you because you've been identified you got a token you've been changed you've been sealed and now the holy spirit is working through you and so Satan is helpless to mess with your soul why cuz there's a strong man in the house the door is locked he can't get in there and so the only thing that Satan's got because he can't control you is Temptation it's what he did with Jesus remember he couldn't control Jesus after he got the Holy Ghost but what did he do he tempted him to try to get him off of his position get him off of his calling get him out of his place to a place where Satan had Authority he tried to get him into the worldly side Jesus said said I don't need it it's not even yours to give to me in the first place I'm not going to be tempted by that but with us what he tries to do is he tries to tempt us away from the things of God from our focus and our purpose and the kingdom of God and when he gets us off of that we're powerless because we're not on the word anymore we're out of our place we're out of our land we're we're off the property we don't have a title deed to where we're standing so if he can get us off of that that's where he can have influence he can't get control but he can get influence but if we'll stay behind the the word if we'll stay focused on the word Satan has no power remember we have this saying that Idle Hands are the devil's workshop you get the Holy Ghost and sit around look out now the Holy Ghost puts you into action that's one thing it definitely does but you sit around and do that Satan will find something for you to do and brother Bram says to stay away from that seek after God don't seek after your gift seek after God remember brother Brown we read that he read that he says the brothers they all got the Holy Ghost and they they wrote a letter to brother Bram said brother brandom what do we do now do we seek after gifts and he says no don't seek after gifts you'll just get caught up and everything that you were in before don't seek after your gift seek after God and God will place you God will put you in the place that you're supposed to what seek to be a place where you can help you can edify you can encourage you can strengthen you can you can do something that'll be of of good and value to the kingdom of God Amen don't seek what you want seek what he wants in other words seek his will and you do that and he sees that you're focused on what he wants rather than what you want and we come to this pivotal place which is called adoption now adoption I don't again I don't want to give on everything but you'll see here that I've separated the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the infilling of the Holy Ghost from adoption and we'll see there that there are people that it was the exact same thing it happened in the exact same moment and I'll give a bit of it away Peter on the day of Pentecost he gets the Holy Ghost and he's adopted and he's placed immediately and he comes down he's got the Keys of the Kingdom he's got full Authority it happened right there then you look at Paul Paul gets the Holy Ghost and he gets taken out in the in the backside of the desert for three years he's been positionally placed as a prophet but he can't be a prophet yet because he's got to be trained the Holy Spirit has to go out and teach him so he has the Holy Ghost but he goes out for three and a half years and what he's not doing anything he's just a preacher he's not a prophet he's a preacher he's not positionally placed yet in what God wants him to be then we see with Jesus brother Braham says he gets the Holy Ghost and he doesn't get adopted until he's up on Mount Transfiguration there's a span of time in there and we'll get into that in more detail amen but God is Sovereign God chooses those things it's not up for me to say if you say brother John I was adopted the minute I got the Holy Ghost I say praise the Lord that's between you and God it's not between me and you and if you say I haven't been adopted yet even though I got the Holy Ghost I say that's between you and God but all I can say is what as soon as you get the Holy Ghost you can be adopted and that's between you and God that's the only place I can go what adoption is placing you in your position in the king om of God it's setting where you where you can do the most damage to Satan's kingdom and the most benefit to God's kingdom damage to Satan benefit to God brother BR says it this way he says I got better hopes of you Brethren sitting here this morning that you'll be men of God who stay with the word of God and let everything else fall right to left but stay right with that word don't move no matter if you're a doormat out there be a good doormat David said I'd rather be a doormat as long as I can be in the house of God God he says don't try to compete with someone else or do this just get right in the word and stay right there and God will positionally place you into his kingdom where you can be the best where you can be the best where you can be the best where you can be the best he places you where you can be the best you don't choose you don't pick you don't influence if he does it he does a perfect work and you'll be the best you could ever be if you'll surrender to his leading in the way he does it amen he says he will do the same for you if you'll stand after you receive the Holy Ghost make yourself a Christian and act like a Christian should how does a Christian act sons of God are led by the spirit of God if you'll obey the leadership of the Holy Spirit doing what God wants you to do he'll take you and he'll place you he says if you'll put your face in God's word your eyes towards heaven and let your pants legs be bagged at the knees now do we know what that means how do your pants legs get bagged you can see I don't pray in my suit CU what happens is when you bow it stretches your knees and if I stay there long enough what happens is if I'd stood up and you'd see a big baggy section sticking right at my knees and ruin my pants brother says get that way get to praying get to seeking get to looking for leadership and then God will place you I I don't understand people that make decisions and you say how did you make it I it just happened how can we do that we're Sons and Daughters of God and we're not praying and making sure we get clear direction from God how are we making big moves jobs careers whatever it might be places churches pastors Whatever It Is Well that's just what turned up no no you got to be led and you got to know you're LED because the first thing that'll happen is Satan will put a roadblock in your way or put a hardship in your way and you're out the window you're out the door you're running away cuz why you didn't have leadership in the first place you weren't convinced of the leading of God and so you don't have any ties you don't have anything to hold you there but here's the other thing I've learned if I make the wrong decision be quick say I made that one without you lord don't pretend it it's the I'll say this in my life perhaps the greatest sign of a religious spirit in my life is when I Won't Back Down on a decision that I know was wrong if I know I messed up and I refuse to acknowledge it that's pride and God can't work with that and so I've had to be able to acknowledge I didn't make that decision with you Lord CU what fruit of it ain't of you I've had to walk it back say that one's on me head of the house all comes back to me he says let your pant legs be bagged at the knees be reverent before God there'll be someday that God will take you over to his side and give you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he's been with you he says that's placing a son to his position he says hallelujah now we think this is going to be some big show brother B said the third poll is not a public show he said the bride Revival is not a public show so don't expect all of us to be going around clearing out the graveyards and clearing out hospitals and bringing limbs back and speak no no no no no brother Bram only had spoken word a couple times in his life and every time he did it the holy spirit said it's up to you now brother bam didn't decide when he was going to have spoken word Authority brother Ram didn't decide when the third poll was going to go into action God told him it's up to you and what was it every time it was because brother brandham had the character to do the right thing every time remember he's in the meeting and the couple is making out on the front row or near the front wherever it was how many preachers would let them sit there and do it the way brother Braham said he said I personal pronoun forgive you but don't do it again we'd be yelling at the deacons we'd be calling out fire from heaven on them we'd be sending them to Hell brother Bram said I forgive you but don't do it again why cuz the holy spirit said there's a trap laid for you tonight whatever he said was going to happen to them he had spoken word authority over their Eternal destination and what was it he was a servant of love and so he brought Mercy before judgment it reminds me so often of the Suns of Thunder and the first thing they wanted was judgment that's how Christ knew they weren't ready adopted Sons don't come out with Jud judgement it's Mercy every time first cuz the spirit and the bride are saying come judgment follows doesn't lead but what is it brother Brandon wasn't just walking around speaking these things into existence but when he spoke it was by what inspiration of the Holy Spirit and by an authority given to him rather than an authority taken by him God says whatever you say it'll happen your wife she's going in she's got this tumor whatever you say will happen he says before the surgeon touches her it'll fall away and be gone and it happened just like it he's speaking to the squirrels he says whatever you say there they'll be and he picked all the worst spots where those squirrels would not be and he spoke them into existence what is it the storm speaking it out of existence what is it God moving on him to speak not him just walking around doing whatever he wanted so under adoption you are still under and we'll get to the quote here in a second you're still under Authority but you have authority and it's given by God you have a place and a purpose purp and a standing and within there you have a certain amount of authority Peter had it at the gate beautiful such as I have give I unto thee but he was inspired to do it that's what people don't realize Paul had it when he cast The Demon out of that girl with a familiar Spirit she was a she was a fortune teller remember and Paul waited for two days before he cast that demon out you go look what brother Brown says brother Brown says he waited till the Holy Spirit told him to do it for two days he let that girl harass them draw attention to them maybe that they didn't want and then he turned around and he said come out of her why he's an adopted son of God but he's still under Authority none of us takes headship over Christ none of us takes headship over the Christ that means none of us take headship over the word butam says it this way he says then when that son was adopted or placed positionally into the kingdom he was a coair he had was just as much Authority as what his father had he could bind turn loose do whatever he wished to because he had already been recognized and adopted and positionally placed and we'd all put a period right there but he says what positionally placed under the authority they're still ahead and it's still Christ and then we still have a headship in our life and it's the Holy Spirit but everything we're doing is by the Holy Spirit through the holy spirit it's not us that does it it's never us that does it it can never be us that does it amen what is it you went from doing the father's business now you're running the father's business you're the son now you went from being like a servant now you're the adopted son now you're the place son what is it now you're his hands now you're his feet now you're his voice now you're his preacher now you're all of these different things now you're his and it's him working through you why because we're amazing fabulous no because we're humble to the word that's what gets us to that as we humble ourselves to the word God tells you what to do and you do it by faith and you leave the results to him I love what brother Daryl Ward said he says it's not my it's not up to me to heal him he says it's up to me to pray for them says the prayer of faith shall save the sick it's not it's not up to me to make them better it's up to me to pray the prayer of faith it's up to him to heal him so you do the work he gets the result that's what it means to be an adopted son and daughter of God you do what he says and he comes behind it and he backs you up and that's what you find time and time again brother BR would say when you say something happens it happens that's how you know you're in an adopted state is when you pray when you ask when you believe it happens it happens what is it you're running his business but you're still under his authority why you've got a vision you've got a word you've got a direction you've got all of these different things that are working to bring you to the place where you're focused and you can do exactly what God wants you to do and what is it it's the message of the hour it's the word for your age that's what it is that that's why we preach what a prophet taught us is cuz that's the voice to our age and it's focusing us on the father's business that we're supposed to be getting into these things and we do all of those things we do all of those things there's only one thing left and that's at the very end that's a Rapture and that's his call that's his time it's his Spirit remember scripture says if the same spirit that dwelt in Christ dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies amen You' got to have the Holy Ghost you've got to be placed and then after that you're a candidate for the Rapture some of us will go by way of the Grave Same Spirit same effect you still get to go in the End Amen but it's him that's working inside of us amen it takes us to meet him with the air that's our full adoption that Paul would talk about he says to wit the Redemption of our bodies that's how you get the Holy Ghost that's the Walk of a Christian believer laid out in hopefully a simple easy graph amen God bless you let's stand if we would like I said and I appreciate it I was glad sister Justine walked in at the end where she did I feel for the young people and you know being raised in the message and and we've heard lots of things preached and we've heard great doctrines and great truths and and it can turn into this big thing and remember brother Bram says all he's looking for is surrendered Hearts he's not looking for great intellect he's not holding you accountable for every great revelation of every this and that and the other you don't have to be able to explain the Seven Seals you don't have to be able to explain every mystery of God but what you have to be is a mystery revealed in your own life you have to be a word living out and that comes only through humbling yourself to the word surrendering yourself to God and then he does everything else it's his work it's his promise it's his word it's his plan it's his will it's his love it's his grace it's his Mercy it's him from start to end he's just looking for people that'll believe it take it apply it work with it and he does the rest the word's got power behind it the word's got all the power we need all you need to do is let it have its way amen and then God sees us through amen let's bow our heads if we would Heavenly Father Lord you are so gracious Lord you are so good and Lord we look at these things Lord we look at this Supernatural promise Lord of a bride that's going to be spotless and without wrinkle Lord that's going to do the very works of Christ Lord and we say how can these things be Lord and maybe like Mary we Ponder them in our heart Lord but we kept walking towards it we kept believing Lord we kept looking we keep trusting Lord I'm praying that you'll help our faith to just rise to the challenge Heavenly Father Lord that we'll seek after you Lord that we'll keep our face in your word Lord that we'll keep our eyes towards you Lord that we'll separate that will sanctify Our Lives of these things Lord so that you can come in and dwell within us Lord in a greater way than we've ever had before Lord we're trusting you to take us through Lord we know we're on a journey Lord we're creatures of Time Lord but we're coming to a place where we're creatures of Eternity Lord would you give us faith and strength Lord to stay true Lord to hold fast Lord to just trust your word day in and day out Lord let us give you the preeminence Lord and trust you to have the perfect work in our lives we pray Lord
