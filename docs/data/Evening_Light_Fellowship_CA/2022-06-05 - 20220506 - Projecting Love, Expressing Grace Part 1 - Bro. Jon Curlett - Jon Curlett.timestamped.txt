[49:44] that refuge that strength that is your
[49:46] name that is your word
[49:48] in jesus christ's name we ask it this
[49:50] morning amen
[49:52] and amen thank you musicians
[49:55] i mean god bless you this morning if
[49:56] you'll turn your bibles to first john
[49:58] chapter four
[50:00] in first john chapter four and we'll
[50:01] start at verse seven
[50:03] amen certainly good to be in the house
[50:05] of the lord this morning to
[50:08] to enjoy the praises and
[50:10] just be in his presence amen it's good
[50:11] to be here this morning
[50:13] and then just before we start i wanted
[50:15] to make a couple announcements we've got
[50:17] a prayer request from dear friends of
[50:20] ours back in british columbia sister
[50:21] lynn frangos and
[50:23] her and her husband are an older retired
[50:24] couple and she's
[50:26] she's not the world's most active woman
[50:28] she's somewhat frail but she loves to be
[50:30] outdoors and work in her gardens and
[50:31] those sorts of things and
[50:33] and she's been knocked on her back and
[50:35] she can't stand for about more than 10
[50:37] minutes before she has to lay down so
[50:38] she's spending most of her time these
[50:40] days laying down and she's got a uh an
[50:43] appointment with a neurosurgeon or a
[50:45] specialist this week or early next week
[50:47] so we want to remember her her husband's
[50:49] having to do basically everything around
[50:50] the home and whatnot and he's got the
[50:52] energy for it so we thank god for that
[50:54] he provides him in but we just want to
[50:56] hold her up before the lord in prayer
[50:58] also some of you may have noticed we
[50:59] don't have an organ here anymore and so
[51:01] we put a chair over there and that's for
[51:03] the minister if he wants to go after the
[51:05] service so if i'm over there brother
[51:07] gerald's over there that's that if you
[51:08] need to come up for prayer you know we
[51:10] don't call prayer you know lines or
[51:12] invite people up very often but we're
[51:14] there so that if you have need of us
[51:15] then we're there to pray with you and
[51:17] talk with you after the service or while
[51:18] they're singing or those different
[51:19] things so you feel free to come up at
[51:21] any time and and you can just go right
[51:23] over there and talk to the minister you
[51:24] don't have to do anything special but we
[51:26] do that for you so that you have access
[51:28] and and if you have a need then we can
[51:30] hopefully minister to that amen amen
[51:32] first john chapter 4 and verse 7 says
[51:34] beloved let us love one another
[51:38] for love is of god and everyone that
[51:40] loveth is born of god and knoweth god he
[51:42] that loveth not knoweth not god for god
[51:46] is love amen you can have your seats
[51:48] this morning may god bless his word
[51:51] it's uh
[51:53] brother jason watkins says to be a to be
[51:56] a pastor or you know a regular minister
[51:58] you got to be a preaching machine
[52:00] and uh
[52:01] brother gerald calling me to come right
[52:03] back he took one and then he said you're
[52:04] up for the next two and so you're
[52:06] sitting there and you're saying lord
[52:07] what am i going to do you're not sure
[52:08] sometimes you know and i've got a lot of
[52:10] notes
[52:11] i've got a lot of notes but preaching
[52:12] isn't about notes amen i can have lots
[52:14] of ideas and good things written down
[52:16] but you've got to try and find the mind
[52:18] of the lord and so i've had this
[52:21] some of this probably for eight or nine
[52:23] months and i'll be frank i thought it
[52:24] was for a different place a different
[52:26] time and not necessarily for this church
[52:28] not that it wouldn't be good for this
[52:29] church of course but um anyways god just
[52:31] started dwelling with me on that and and
[52:34] dropping some things in so i said okay
[52:35] and here we are this morning amen so
[52:37] just trusting that the lord will be in
[52:39] it and i want to bring a a just a little
[52:42] mini series two services tonight and
[52:43] wednesday or this morning and wednesday
[52:45] of projecting love and expressing grace
[52:48] amen and this is going to be down home
[52:50] where you live preaching this is going
[52:51] to be right in your kitchen right in
[52:52] your living room this is going to be
[52:54] rubber meets the road very pastoral type
[52:56] of message this morning so it's not all
[52:58] going to be mysteries i mean it's not
[53:00] all going to be mysteries we're not
[53:01] going to be necessarily getting into the
[53:02] deep things where we're drilling down
[53:04] into scripture amen but we want to be
[53:06] revealed mysteries amen we don't just
[53:08] want to read about mysteries we don't
[53:10] just want to hear about mysteries but we
[53:11] want to be mysteries it's kind of like
[53:13] somebody says that they've got a
[53:14] treasure map and they say i've got the
[53:16] treasure map figured out and you say do
[53:17] you have the treasure and they say no
[53:19] then you know there's something wrong
[53:20] with their interpretation that treasure
[53:22] map because if you knew where it was
[53:23] you'd have it by now amen and it's the
[53:25] same thing for us as believers we don't
[53:27] just want to know the truth we want to
[53:28] be the truth we want to have the truth
[53:30] we want to know the we want to be the
[53:32] expression of god just know about god
[53:34] but we want to be god expressing him
[53:36] through our lives amen let's go back to
[53:38] that original scripture and
[53:40] if you'll hold your bibles in first john
[53:42] 4 we're going to stay there the entire
[53:43] service i'll go off a few different ways
[53:45] but you'll want to stay there amen this
[53:47] morning but verse 7 says beloved let us
[53:50] love one another for love is of god and
[53:52] everyone that loveth is born of god and
[53:54] knoweth god and he that loveth not
[53:57] knoweth not god for god is love and i
[53:59] want to stop here and start with this
[54:01] and it's what what john is saying here
[54:02] is he's saying if you don't have god's
[54:04] love you're not a part of god
[54:07] it's very simple this morning he says if
[54:09] you don't have the love of god then you
[54:12] don't actually know god and you can't
[54:13] even say you're a part of god you might
[54:16] be inclined towards god
[54:17] right you might have a
[54:19] leaning towards it you might have a an
[54:21] understanding of what truth is but he
[54:23] says if you don't have the love of god
[54:25] then you have no part of god so we need
[54:27] to know what that love of god is amen
[54:29] but he says he goes so far as to say you
[54:31] don't know god you haven't met god and
[54:34] more importantly you haven't had an
[54:35] intimate relationship with god if you
[54:37] don't have his love that's right that's
[54:39] how that's how straight the line is this
[54:41] morning he says if if you haven't
[54:43] experienced the love of god then you
[54:45] don't have any part of god you say i
[54:47] know what's under the seven seals
[54:48] doesn't matter
[54:50] right i dress right i dress according to
[54:52] the scriptures that doesn't matter if
[54:54] you don't have love amen i attend church
[54:56] every time the church door is open it
[54:58] doesn't matter if you don't have love
[55:00] and then he's it's a simple line that
[55:02] we're drawing this morning that said
[55:03] you've got to be able to express god's
[55:05] love in order for you to be a part of
[55:06] god
[55:07] and then as we start to get into this
[55:09] we'll
[55:09] we'll look at some of these different
[55:11] things and don't stop dressing right
[55:13] don't stop understanding the things of
[55:15] the scripture don't stop coming to
[55:16] church those are attributes of a child
[55:18] of god amen but that doesn't make you a
[55:20] child of god that comes out of a child
[55:22] of god but that's not what makes you a
[55:24] child of god it's the love of god
[55:25] that'll make you do those things it's
[55:27] the love of god that will give you
[55:28] revelation and understanding in the
[55:30] scriptures
[55:31] you i could say it this way
[55:33] you can believe this message of the hour
[55:35] and if you don't have the love of god it
[55:37] doesn't matter
[55:38] because what i'll tell you is that you
[55:39] don't understand what the message is if
[55:41] you don't have the love of god because
[55:43] then it just becomes words it just
[55:44] becomes doctrines it just becomes
[55:46] sermons that a prophet brought to us but
[55:48] if you don't have the life of that
[55:49] message if you don't have the love that
[55:51] brought us that message then you don't
[55:52] really understand what the message is
[55:54] about because in the end the message is
[55:55] a person it's not just things on a page
[55:58] it's not just sermons on a tape it's a
[55:59] person so that message you have to
[56:01] become the message you don't if you've
[56:04] received it you will become it and if
[56:05] you've received it and you haven't
[56:06] become it then it you can't have
[56:08] received it because the receiving of the
[56:09] word always has an effect in a person's
[56:11] life amen
[56:13] you've got to you can't get stuck on the
[56:14] mysteries you can't get stuck on the
[56:16] depth of the scripture and not have that
[56:18] same depth in your life expressed
[56:19] through the things that you do
[56:21] listen you say brother john that's
[56:23] blasphemy to say that you can believe
[56:24] the message of the hour and not be saved
[56:26] or that you don't have a part of god
[56:28] let's go back to the original prophet in
[56:30] first corinthians 13 he says though i
[56:32] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[56:34] and have not charity i am become a
[56:36] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and
[56:38] though i have the gift of prophecy
[56:41] and understand all mysteries mysteries
[56:44] under the seven seals mysteries of
[56:46] godhead mystery of serpenty mysteries of
[56:48] marriage and divorce all of these things
[56:49] if i understand all those
[56:51] mysteries and have all knowledge and
[56:54] though i have all faith
[56:56] so that i could remove mountains
[56:58] and have not charity i am nothing
[57:02] i am nothing you say i would listen if i
[57:04] walked through there and i s if i if i
[57:06] could say that i jonathan corlett have a
[57:08] gift of prophecy understand all
[57:09] mysteries and all knowledge and that i
[57:11] have faith enough to move great
[57:12] mountains as jesus told us we could have
[57:15] if we believed i would say i'm an
[57:17] amazing christian
[57:18] and then paul says and if you have not
[57:20] love you're nothing
[57:21] so you can have all of those gifts you
[57:23] can have all of those things from god
[57:25] but he says if you don't have the love
[57:27] of god then you are nothing you are
[57:29] nothing as a believer you are nothing as
[57:31] it represents a child of god amen we
[57:33] talked a lot about faith recently and
[57:35] paul says look you can have the greatest
[57:37] faith on earth but if you can't love the
[57:39] way christ's love then you're nothing
[57:40] you have no place you have no position
[57:42] you have no standing in the kingdom of
[57:44] heaven what's he saying he's saying you
[57:45] can have all of that and you you won't
[57:47] have even experienced god in your life
[57:49] men the rain falls on the justin the
[57:50] unjust you can sit in a service you can
[57:52] have tremendous anointing on you you can
[57:54] have an anointing and speak as a prophet
[57:56] a gift of prophecy and never have the
[57:57] baptism of the holy spirit
[57:59] absolutely you can
[58:01] because what it falls on the just and
[58:03] the unjust people have an inclination
[58:05] towards it i know people personally have
[58:07] people in my family that have spoken
[58:09] things in the name of the lord and they
[58:10] never had the holy ghost but yet god
[58:12] operated through them
[58:13] right why because it's without gifts and
[58:16] callings or without repentance right god
[58:18] will use anybody if they're willing
[58:20] but that doesn't mean they're saved it
[58:21] doesn't mean they're a child of god it
[58:22] just means they were willing and they
[58:24] were in the right place at the right
[58:25] time and they were open to what god was
[58:26] wanting to do amen but paul says listen
[58:28] the defining attribute and john john
[58:30] confirms it the defining attribute of
[58:32] god is love when you say god is love
[58:35] that encompasses all of god and
[58:36] everything flows out from that love of
[58:38] god everything that we have whether it's
[58:40] revelation whether it's understanding
[58:41] whether it's faith is an attribute of
[58:43] the very love of god that's working
[58:45] inside of our life amen and he says you
[58:47] can see it recognize an expression of
[58:49] god and that's what all these things are
[58:50] in verse two but he says if you don't
[58:52] have the love of god then you've just
[58:53] got an expression rather than the
[58:55] reality of god in your life what's a
[58:57] reveal mystery anyways
[58:59] that's just god showing his love to you
[59:01] it's giving you a revelation it's giving
[59:02] you an understanding so that you can
[59:04] take a look through things the way god
[59:05] sees it and you can start to move into
[59:07] the things that god wants you to have
[59:09] but he opens it up for you out of love
[59:12] right because that's remember when the
[59:14] the disciples are talking to him he says
[59:16] it's hidden from them it's hidden from
[59:18] them but you're my friends you're the
[59:20] ones i love and that's why i show it to
[59:22] you it's given unto you to understand
[59:24] these things because what you're a part
[59:26] of me because i love you that's why he
[59:27] did it in the first place right but
[59:29] there's a mystery here there's a mystery
[59:31] here but it's a mystery of experience
[59:33] it's not our mystery of words right and
[59:35] that's what we're looking for as we just
[59:37] take these next two services is that we
[59:39] want to be the mystery of love reveal we
[59:40] want to be the mystery of the expression
[59:42] of grace revealed not only for us but
[59:44] for those that are around us
[59:46] if we go back to first john 4 and verse
[59:48] 9 it says in this was manifested the
[59:50] love of god towards us because that god
[59:53] sent his only begotten son into the
[59:55] world that we might live through him so
[59:56] he says the manifestation the proof of
[59:58] god's love was that he sent somebody to
[1:00:00] take our place
[1:00:01] that's what god's love does is it takes
[1:00:03] the place it takes on the burden of
[1:00:05] somebody else and he says herein is love
[1:00:08] not that we love god but that he loved
[1:00:10] us
[1:00:11] that's a special kind of loves that love
[1:00:13] somebody when they don't love you
[1:00:15] and in that love he sent his son to be
[1:00:17] the propitiation for our sins so god's
[1:00:20] love was and is so great that he loved
[1:00:22] us when we didn't love him not only did
[1:00:24] he love us but he made a way for us he
[1:00:26] removed the barrier he took he tore the
[1:00:28] veil in half right he took uh something
[1:00:30] out of the way he looked past our carnal
[1:00:33] carnality pos passed our human thinking
[1:00:35] past our faults past our failures and in
[1:00:37] that he sent somebody to pay our price
[1:00:40] so that we could approach him what love
[1:00:42] comes down and what does it do it makes
[1:00:44] a way and then grace comes and it takes
[1:00:46] us into his presence love makes a way
[1:00:49] grace takes us into his presence and
[1:00:50] that's a theme we'll see throughout this
[1:00:52] but what did we do to deserve it
[1:00:54] what did we do to deserve his love it
[1:00:56] says while we didn't love him yet he
[1:00:58] loved us
[1:00:59] so there's nothing we did to deserve it
[1:01:01] there's nothing listen if there's
[1:01:02] nothing we did to deserve it then
[1:01:04] there's nothing we can do to deserve it
[1:01:06] so don't start trying to get into what a
[1:01:08] christianity a performance it'll never
[1:01:11] work you'll never perform your way into
[1:01:13] the kingdom of heaven you'll never
[1:01:14] perform your way into a place where god
[1:01:16] loves you where god gives you gifts that
[1:01:18] has nothing to do with it while we were
[1:01:20] yet sinners he gave his life for us amen
[1:01:22] so don't try and perform your way into
[1:01:25] this body of christ it is a love gift it
[1:01:27] is given free you didn't deserve it it
[1:01:29] is unmerited favor and mercy in your
[1:01:31] life accept it and receive it and move
[1:01:33] on in newness of life amen there's
[1:01:36] nothing we can do we give our lives back
[1:01:38] but we don't give our lives back as what
[1:01:40] a try to repay him
[1:01:42] we give it back as a love gift to him it
[1:01:45] is a sign of our appreciation for what
[1:01:47] he did but we can't ever get in our
[1:01:49] heads that because i give it back to him
[1:01:51] i'm worthy no your life is unworthy for
[1:01:54] him
[1:01:55] what i offer him is worthless
[1:01:57] that's why i give it to him is because
[1:01:59] it's worthless i lay it down and then he
[1:02:01] can burn out all of me and turn it into
[1:02:04] something that is of use to him that's
[1:02:06] what we're here for say we say lord i'm
[1:02:08] useless you died for uselessness but if
[1:02:10] i give it to you maybe you can turn this
[1:02:12] piece of trash into something that can
[1:02:14] be a a sign something that will stand
[1:02:16] for your kingdom
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:19] we can't do anything
[1:02:21] first peter 2 says for this is thank
[1:02:23] where's the if a man for conscience
[1:02:25] toward god and your grief suffering
[1:02:27] wrongfully for what glory is it if when
[1:02:29] we be when you be buffeted for your
[1:02:31] faults you'll take it patiently or if
[1:02:34] when you do dwell and suffer for it you
[1:02:36] take it patiently this is acceptable
[1:02:38] with god he says so when you've messed
[1:02:40] up don't pat yourself on the back when
[1:02:42] you take your beating well
[1:02:44] that's what he's saying he's saying
[1:02:45] listen you did wrong doesn't matter how
[1:02:47] good your response is to your to your
[1:02:50] your your spanking he says you did wrong
[1:02:52] so don't sit there and say well i
[1:02:54] endured the the difficulties of making
[1:02:56] things right that has nothing to do that
[1:02:58] he says you messed up except that you
[1:02:59] messed up and stop messing up and forget
[1:03:01] about how good you are there's no reward
[1:03:03] for doing wrong and then holding back
[1:03:05] when you get the spanking that your
[1:03:06] mother or your father is giving you
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:08] there's no reward in that you've done
[1:03:10] wrong you're paying a price
[1:03:12] so don't say well i took that beating so
[1:03:14] well it doesn't matter how you took the
[1:03:15] beating you did wrong
[1:03:17] right but he continues he says for even
[1:03:19] here unto were you called or in other
[1:03:21] words he's saying where you are now is
[1:03:23] for a purpose just like christ was
[1:03:24] you're in this experience and you're
[1:03:26] what you're about to go through
[1:03:28] is for a reason he says because christ
[1:03:31] also suffered for us leaving us an
[1:03:34] example that you should follow that so
[1:03:35] catch that the love of christ makes us
[1:03:37] act the way christ did and the things
[1:03:39] that we go through we go through for the
[1:03:41] same reason and purpose that christ did
[1:03:42] amen so you look at the way that christ
[1:03:45] did it what he acted based on who he was
[1:03:48] not on what we were
[1:03:50] as in he was not defined by our response
[1:03:53] or our lack of response right they were
[1:03:55] mad at him it didn't change what he did
[1:03:57] they slapped his face they told him to
[1:03:59] prophesy they crucified him they whipped
[1:04:01] him they put a crown of thorns in his
[1:04:02] head none of that had anything to do
[1:04:04] with it he says i'm here to do my
[1:04:06] father's will and guess what you're
[1:04:07] going to receive what i have for you
[1:04:09] regardless of what you want
[1:04:11] he's going to offer it up he's going to
[1:04:12] say i'm not going to let your actions
[1:04:14] determine whether or not i give you what
[1:04:15] you're supposed to get
[1:04:17] why they didn't know what they needed
[1:04:19] and so he's coming to them in love and
[1:04:21] he's giving his life for them and
[1:04:22] they're sitting there and they're
[1:04:23] crucifying the prince of glory because
[1:04:25] they have no idea that he's offering
[1:04:26] what they have need of and for many of
[1:04:28] them they didn't realize it until later
[1:04:29] on the day of pentecost and there's 3000
[1:04:31] realized holy cow we just killed the
[1:04:33] king
[1:04:34] and their hearts were pricked and they
[1:04:36] repented for and they got the holy ghost
[1:04:38] and god started to move there but they
[1:04:39] had to do it because he had to die
[1:04:41] but then they come around and they
[1:04:42] receive the very thing that they they
[1:04:44] sacrifice and they take his he they they
[1:04:47] take the the the gift that he's given
[1:04:49] them amen but he acted on his liberty
[1:04:51] not on their bondage
[1:04:53] right he's not defined by what the other
[1:04:55] person by what we were doing at the time
[1:04:57] he was operating based on a perfect love
[1:04:58] that's not looking at the other person
[1:05:00] there amen he was not bound by our
[1:05:02] problems or issues
[1:05:05] so if that's the way he acts then paul's
[1:05:07] saying that's the way you act now so
[1:05:09] when you're going to give love it's not
[1:05:11] going to be whether or not brother david
[1:05:12] accepts what i need him to accept and
[1:05:14] when i say accept when brother david's
[1:05:16] wrong
[1:05:17] are you ever wrong brother david i don't
[1:05:18] know i've never caught you in the wrong
[1:05:20] but when brother david's wrong if i go
[1:05:22] to him and talk to him and he starts to
[1:05:24] flash up at me and rail back at me
[1:05:26] i don't get mad and rail back at him now
[1:05:27] do i
[1:05:28] because christ didn't do that
[1:05:30] what is it i'm gonna go pray for brother
[1:05:32] david
[1:05:33] right i'm gonna say well he needs what
[1:05:35] i've got so i'm going to keep giving it
[1:05:36] no matter what i'm not going to let
[1:05:38] brother david define what my message is
[1:05:41] nor how i respond to him when he comes
[1:05:43] back at me amen
[1:05:45] but listen to this it says who did no
[1:05:47] sin neither was guile found in his mouth
[1:05:49] now none of us can claim that
[1:05:51] christ could justly say i've done no
[1:05:53] wrong
[1:05:54] we can't do that no matter how good we
[1:05:55] are no matter how good our intentions
[1:05:57] are we can't go to verse 22 and say
[1:05:59] that's me
[1:06:01] so that ought to bring some humility
[1:06:02] into us every time we enter a situation
[1:06:05] verse 23 says who when he was reviled
[1:06:08] reviled not again and when he suffered
[1:06:10] he threatened not but committed himself
[1:06:12] to him that judges righteously so he
[1:06:14] could have righteously and correctly
[1:06:16] spoken up and he could have discerned
[1:06:18] the thoughts and intents of the heart he
[1:06:19] could have projected a vision in front
[1:06:21] of him he could have done whatever it
[1:06:22] took to prove that i haven't done what
[1:06:24] you've said i've done
[1:06:25] he could have righteously and justly
[1:06:27] done that he could not be blamed for any
[1:06:29] of these things and be found guilty
[1:06:31] because he didn't do any of what they
[1:06:32] said
[1:06:34] but in that place
[1:06:36] because he's acting in love he's got to
[1:06:38] do something for us he did not respond
[1:06:40] back
[1:06:41] right he didn't revile back he didn't go
[1:06:42] back at them with the same attitude that
[1:06:44] they brought to them what he committed
[1:06:46] those things to god and he kept his
[1:06:47] focus on his kingdom purpose
[1:06:49] who his own self bear our sins in his
[1:06:52] own body on the tree that we being dead
[1:06:54] to sin should live unto righteousness by
[1:06:56] whose stripes ye are healed for ye as
[1:06:59] she she ye were a sheep going astray
[1:07:02] but
[1:07:04] this is the effect
[1:07:05] but are now returned under the shepherd
[1:07:08] and bishop of your soul so he did all
[1:07:10] that he held himself back he bit his
[1:07:12] tongues ten thousand angels are sitting
[1:07:15] there saying let us adam let us at them
[1:07:17] and he said no no i've got to take this
[1:07:18] because i've got a love purpose for the
[1:07:21] people that are even doing this very
[1:07:22] thing to me amen why so that we can
[1:07:24] return ourselves to our rightful place
[1:07:26] rightful meaning where we're supposed to
[1:07:28] be not because we deserve it but where
[1:07:30] he said we had to be that's what he had
[1:07:32] to do to get us back to the shepherd and
[1:07:33] bishop of our souls this morning amen
[1:07:36] now paul now john is he's pushed all
[1:07:38] this on christ and he said this is what
[1:07:40] christ did
[1:07:41] right and then paul's doing the same
[1:07:43] thing here but watch now as john starts
[1:07:45] to bring it down to us in first john 4
[1:07:46] and 11. he says beloved if god so loved
[1:07:50] us
[1:07:51] we also ought to love one another now i
[1:07:53] want to break that down a minute because
[1:07:55] so often what we there is we say if god
[1:07:57] loved us we also ought to love one
[1:07:58] another
[1:07:59] but there's a very special little word
[1:08:01] in there that says if god so
[1:08:04] loved us in other words if god loved us
[1:08:06] this particular way then we ought to
[1:08:08] love one another in this particular way
[1:08:11] the way that god did it is the way we've
[1:08:13] got to do it so it wasn't that god just
[1:08:16] loved us it's the way that the way that
[1:08:18] god loved us is the way that we're
[1:08:20] supposed to love one another amen so
[1:08:22] whatever he did were supposed to do the
[1:08:25] way he did it is the way we're supposed
[1:08:26] to do it the motive with which he did it
[1:08:28] is the motive we're supposed to have and
[1:08:29] the objective for which he had is the
[1:08:31] same thing that we're supposed to have
[1:08:32] if we're going to love amen this is a
[1:08:34] particular way of loving and it is not
[1:08:36] i'll tell you this it is not the way the
[1:08:38] world loves today amen
[1:08:40] the way that he loved is the way he we
[1:08:41] have to love and there's no variableness
[1:08:43] neither shadow of turning in christ amen
[1:08:45] and god there's no change so i don't get
[1:08:47] to love brother david one way and then
[1:08:49] brother mark gets a lesser dose of it
[1:08:51] right
[1:08:52] because god loves us all equally doesn't
[1:08:54] he right there's no variableness no
[1:08:56] shadow of turning so whether brother
[1:08:57] david is shaking my hand or not shaking
[1:08:59] my hand that doesn't change my love it
[1:09:01] shouldn't change my love for brother
[1:09:03] david
[1:09:04] does it
[1:09:05] if we were honest probably if brother
[1:09:06] david stopped shaking my hand i'd
[1:09:08] probably say
[1:09:09] we've got some issues right
[1:09:11] maybe with me maybe with him but guess
[1:09:12] what in humanity we'd back away wouldn't
[1:09:14] we
[1:09:15] but he's saying no no no that's not the
[1:09:17] way we do this we've got to love
[1:09:18] everybody the same way and in the same
[1:09:20] way
[1:09:21] so with the same regard with the same
[1:09:23] amount if i could put it that way and in
[1:09:25] the same way that christ loves each and
[1:09:27] every one of us amen amen
[1:09:30] we give each other the same grace and
[1:09:31] latitude no matter whose family they're
[1:09:33] in right no matter whose church they're
[1:09:34] in no matter which pastor they're under
[1:09:36] we ought to be able to give every single
[1:09:38] one the same amount of love and grace
[1:09:39] and latitude that we give our best
[1:09:41] friends
[1:09:43] right because our best friends we're
[1:09:44] good with best friends but what about
[1:09:46] our worst friends what if you're number
[1:09:48] 10 on the ladder right brother paul
[1:09:51] right what if you're number 10. i got to
[1:09:53] love number 10 the way i love number one
[1:09:58] i don't have it here but remember in
[1:09:59] john he says by this jesus said this to
[1:10:01] his disciples he says by this shall all
[1:10:04] men know that you're my disciples
[1:10:06] if you understand the revelation of the
[1:10:07] seven seals
[1:10:09] if you prophesy
[1:10:11] if you cast out devils if you heal the
[1:10:13] sick
[1:10:14] that was not what he said he says by
[1:10:16] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:10:17] disciples if
[1:10:19] you have love one to another
[1:10:22] the defining feature of believers always
[1:10:23] to love as god did
[1:10:25] and that will show you how you're going
[1:10:26] to act in every situation amen
[1:10:29] and here's the kicker is that what he
[1:10:31] didn't just love the people that agreed
[1:10:32] with him at that one particular moment
[1:10:34] listen jesus came to a world that didn't
[1:10:36] even realize they needed him they knew
[1:10:38] that they needed him but they weren't
[1:10:39] ready for what he had and he preached
[1:10:41] the message that most of them except 120
[1:10:44] refused initially
[1:10:46] everybody else walked away he lost the
[1:10:47] majority of his disciples people walked
[1:10:49] away from him he got accused by church
[1:10:51] leadership all of these things
[1:10:53] everything that he brought was what they
[1:10:55] needed and they turned him down and yet
[1:10:57] he still loved them for god so loved the
[1:10:58] world that he gave and gave and gave and
[1:11:00] gave and gave until he gave his life
[1:11:02] amen that's what we're talking about is
[1:11:03] this kind of love amen he didn't love
[1:11:05] just the ones that were cleaned up
[1:11:06] because he came to a filthy world
[1:11:09] we were filthy
[1:11:10] we were filthy when he came to us amen
[1:11:12] he came to me right when i could not
[1:11:15] come to him he came to me
[1:11:17] so he comes to those that aren't cleaned
[1:11:18] up he comes to those that don't look
[1:11:20] like believers doesn't he because guess
[1:11:22] what before you're a believer you've got
[1:11:24] to be an unbeliever and guess what
[1:11:25] unbelievers look like unbelievers
[1:11:28] right he doesn't come to the ones that
[1:11:29] have the right doctrine up front
[1:11:31] speaking to the catholics in the group
[1:11:34] he didn't come to you because you had
[1:11:36] the right doctrine did he he came to you
[1:11:37] when you had the wrong doctrine right he
[1:11:39] didn't come to the people that dressed
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:42] he didn't come to the people that had
[1:11:43] the right attitude
[1:11:44] he didn't come to the people with
[1:11:45] perfect marriages with perfect kids he
[1:11:48] didn't come to the perfect ministers
[1:11:50] what did he do he came to those who had
[1:11:51] a need amen and so your love's got to be
[1:11:54] able to look to the need and look past
[1:11:55] what's in front of that need the facade
[1:11:57] that's there the prickly spines that are
[1:11:59] there the armor that's built up the the
[1:12:02] fortress that is trying to hold it back
[1:12:04] and love's got to look to what's beyond
[1:12:05] that to say there's something in there
[1:12:07] that i need to come to amen
[1:12:10] you say they don't believe like i
[1:12:12] believe
[1:12:13] what does it have to do with anything
[1:12:15] listen when the prophet came nobody
[1:12:17] believed right
[1:12:18] because he had to come back and restore
[1:12:20] them to the truth
[1:12:22] so that he can restore them to the faith
[1:12:24] you've got to be restored through truth
[1:12:26] before you can come to faith and so he's
[1:12:28] coming and he's preaching to all of them
[1:12:30] he's preaching to assemblies of god he's
[1:12:31] preaching to pentecostals he comes out
[1:12:33] of the baptist church he said all of
[1:12:35] these people and he's putting all of his
[1:12:36] energy and time into people that don't
[1:12:37] agree with him
[1:12:39] and yet we'll sit here in the message
[1:12:40] and we'll say well that brother doesn't
[1:12:42] agree with me so we're just going to put
[1:12:43] him out
[1:12:44] listen that's never been the way of
[1:12:45] christ
[1:12:46] amen that's never been what we saw in in
[1:12:48] the life of a prophet here either we
[1:12:50] ought to be praying for those people we
[1:12:51] ought to be fellowshipping with those
[1:12:53] people if you have what they need how
[1:12:54] are they going to get it unless you'll
[1:12:55] come and take it
[1:12:57] right
[1:13:02] listen if i have to go only to where
[1:13:04] people will accept my message then i'm
[1:13:05] not much of a preacher amen you've got
[1:13:08] to be able to go where it's needed not
[1:13:09] where it's going to be accepted because
[1:13:11] how can they come unless they hear the
[1:13:12] truth right they can be sitting in a
[1:13:15] cold dead formal message church and
[1:13:17] think that they're living and they need
[1:13:18] a they need a life preached to them and
[1:13:20] unless you come and preach a life to
[1:13:21] them then they're never going to get it
[1:13:22] sitting where they are and then you've
[1:13:24] got to be able to go whether they
[1:13:25] receive it or not you've got to be able
[1:13:26] to preach and love regardless of whether
[1:13:28] the people will take it amen listen i
[1:13:30] resisted truth until i gave into truth
[1:13:34] some of us came in easy i didn't come in
[1:13:35] easy
[1:13:36] and i'm glad that brother gerald sat or
[1:13:38] stood and he preached the truth and he
[1:13:39] preached the truth and he preached the
[1:13:40] truth
[1:13:42] why because until i could take it he
[1:13:44] still had to keep going and still had to
[1:13:46] be laying in there there has to be a
[1:13:47] buildup because he's convicting us he's
[1:13:49] drawing us to him and all he was doing
[1:13:51] was building up a tsunami of what god's
[1:13:54] love that would eventually topple over
[1:13:56] the tower of jonathan corrects humanity
[1:13:58] and desire to control his life and then
[1:13:59] that love flows in and in a moment it's
[1:14:01] done and it's never going to be rebuilt
[1:14:02] again right jonathan curlett's gone and
[1:14:04] in that place it stands now jesus christ
[1:14:06] working in my life
[1:14:08] what it's a love gift amen it's it's an
[1:14:10] act of love love love doesn't defeat by
[1:14:13] by control it defeats by what breaking
[1:14:15] down what you have and letting you see
[1:14:17] that there's something bigger than what
[1:14:18] you've got holding on into in your hands
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:21] brother brown would say it this way he
[1:14:22] says a few weeks ago in phoenix when i
[1:14:24] preached on sunday afternoon where
[1:14:25] there's divisions and men wouldn't
[1:14:27] hardly speak to one another i've seen
[1:14:29] around 200 ministers or better walk down
[1:14:31] to the altar and shake one another's
[1:14:33] hands and cry over one another's
[1:14:34] shoulders and say they'd never fuss or
[1:14:36] be different with one another again
[1:14:38] he says let that great church of god
[1:14:40] take that attitude tonight and i'll show
[1:14:42] you a revival that'll sweep this nation
[1:14:44] and tear down every nest of hell there
[1:14:48] is
[1:14:49] truth no love
[1:14:52] brother we can preach it till we're
[1:14:54] horse and our lungs fall out but until
[1:14:56] the people make a move you'll never do
[1:14:59] nothing
[1:15:01] so now he's taking it off the pulp and
[1:15:03] he's put it in your laps and he's saying
[1:15:04] you got to do something now
[1:15:06] we preached it now you got to do
[1:15:08] something with it
[1:15:09] that's right you've got to make them
[1:15:11] move and believe it brethren do it
[1:15:12] tonight do it tonight stand up for the
[1:15:15] words stand up for the living word of
[1:15:17] the living god and god will manifest
[1:15:19] today men i was talking to some brothers
[1:15:21] outside church there a while back and i
[1:15:22] said how should we act if an unbeliever
[1:15:24] comes into our church
[1:15:26] if we get a woman walks in here and
[1:15:27] she's showing some skin what are we to
[1:15:29] do
[1:15:29] the guy walks in and he's got tattoos
[1:15:31] all over and piercings and you know he's
[1:15:33] got a muscle shirt on
[1:15:35] what should we do
[1:15:38] what is the church the church is always
[1:15:40] a hospital
[1:15:41] right
[1:15:42] amen it's always a hospital we bring the
[1:15:44] sick in and we heal them don't we
[1:15:47] and so it doesn't matter what they look
[1:15:48] like now we wouldn't put that sister up
[1:15:50] at the front of the church now would we
[1:15:51] our deacons would have some wisdom but
[1:15:53] listen i don't care how they're dressed
[1:15:54] you bring them in if you got to cover
[1:15:56] them up a bit then cover them up a bit
[1:15:57] but we want them to come in the way they
[1:15:59] are if we force them to conform before
[1:16:02] they're convicted then all we're turning
[1:16:04] them into is legalistic christians and
[1:16:05] no life comes out of that no life comes
[1:16:07] out of that amen we ought to be able to
[1:16:09] bring them in the way they are and let
[1:16:11] the holy spirit work on them and it will
[1:16:13] then be a love affair with god
[1:16:16] rather than a legalistic affair with the
[1:16:18] man behind the pulpit most often we
[1:16:20] can't bring them in that way we've got
[1:16:21] to be a hospital to what the dying to
[1:16:23] the hurt and half the time they don't
[1:16:25] even know they're sick until they come
[1:16:26] in here
[1:16:28] how many times have we gone to a doctor
[1:16:29] and he says you got something wrong you
[1:16:30] say i feel great but he says look your
[1:16:32] blood work says you got something wrong
[1:16:34] we got to deal with it they come in here
[1:16:36] and what under the anointing of the holy
[1:16:38] spirit which is god's love to us he
[1:16:40] reveals that they need to make a change
[1:16:42] and that's what draws them to what
[1:16:44] living a life for christ it's not
[1:16:46] because we tell them to do it's because
[1:16:47] god's drawing them to himself
[1:16:51] brother braham says in the midst of a
[1:16:53] perishing dying people a perishing dying
[1:16:55] nation god so loved the unworthy look
[1:16:58] how unworthy they were
[1:16:59] oh if it wasn't for the love of god he'd
[1:17:01] destroy the whole world tonight but he
[1:17:04] can't do it his love won't let him do it
[1:17:06] amen that's me that's me right there
[1:17:09] unworthy
[1:17:10] unworthy as all get out amen and i will
[1:17:13] say that when i walked up to that altar
[1:17:14] and gave my life to him the only thing i
[1:17:17] could say is i'm unworthy i'm dirty
[1:17:20] there's nothing i can do to deserve it i
[1:17:22] cried and i cried and i cried because i
[1:17:24] knew i wasn't worthy for his love and
[1:17:27] grace amen and that's what repentance is
[1:17:29] is i'm not worthy it's not just i'm
[1:17:31] sorry but i'm not even worthy that's how
[1:17:33] that's how much i realize my humanity
[1:17:36] and and the lack of the of the holiness
[1:17:38] of god in our lives is that i've got
[1:17:39] nothing here and that's why i'm coming
[1:17:41] to you is because i am nothing
[1:17:43] absolutely nothing he says so he so
[1:17:45] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:17:47] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:17:49] him should not perish but could drink
[1:17:51] the waters of life freely whosoever will
[1:17:54] may come just enough of bountiful
[1:17:56] blessings pouring out he that believeth
[1:17:58] on me in other words take it like this
[1:18:01] he that believeth on me shall have a
[1:18:04] great big gusher right in the middle of
[1:18:06] his soul bubbling up into everlasting
[1:18:09] life oh he says what a beautiful thing a
[1:18:12] great big gusher can you say you've got
[1:18:14] a great big gusher this morning
[1:18:16] sometimes we've got a little dribbling
[1:18:18] stream if we were to be honest
[1:18:20] sometimes we're pretty dry aren't we
[1:18:22] sometimes we get there
[1:18:25] me and brother gerald the only two with
[1:18:26] our hands up
[1:18:28] and brother joe there we go and blanca
[1:18:31] but we do we get dry don't we amen we're
[1:18:34] going to talk about dryness a little bit
[1:18:35] tomorrow or on wednesday lord willing
[1:18:37] but i want you to hold that in your
[1:18:38] heart are you a great big gusher
[1:18:42] because that's what we ought to be
[1:18:43] to a world that has no pure clean living
[1:18:46] water
[1:18:47] we got to be a gusher because there's a
[1:18:49] lot of people need it and there's very
[1:18:50] few sources for them to get at this work
[1:18:52] in this world amen we need to have a to
[1:18:54] give a lot and guess what to give a lot
[1:18:57] you got to get a lot
[1:18:58] and that's where we're really going with
[1:18:59] this is you got to be full before you
[1:19:01] can give out you can't just be full
[1:19:03] you've got to be overflowing i like what
[1:19:05] brother joe adams said i don't know if
[1:19:06] he told me uh
[1:19:08] privately or over the pope but he says
[1:19:10] we need to preach out of the overflow
[1:19:12] that's really what we're coming is
[1:19:13] there's something in us bubbling up
[1:19:15] that's coming out and you say lord we
[1:19:17] gotta share that with the people and
[1:19:18] that's what god's doing is he's filling
[1:19:20] you up with something and it's coming
[1:19:21] out of your life and you say this is
[1:19:23] what they need it's so good for me it'll
[1:19:25] do them some good as well and that's
[1:19:26] what we're trying to bring this morning
[1:19:27] is an overflow and listen i'm not
[1:19:29] preaching from a place if i have it this
[1:19:30] morning
[1:19:31] i raise my hand
[1:19:33] we get dry we get dry but look this is
[1:19:36] where i want to be right brother gerald
[1:19:37] this is where we want to be
[1:19:39] the ministry will face it the toughest
[1:19:41] and and those that have serving gifts
[1:19:43] and whatnot because why you're always
[1:19:45] giving giving giving and you rarely get
[1:19:46] as much as you give and you know what
[1:19:48] that means is that you've got to get
[1:19:49] back in the presence of god every single
[1:19:51] day to have something to give otherwise
[1:19:53] you get drawn out and dried out and we
[1:19:55] turn into legalistic preachers every
[1:19:57] single time
[1:19:58] every single time why because you're not
[1:20:00] preaching out of the overflow and when
[1:20:01] you lose the overflow is grace
[1:20:04] and love and when you lose those two
[1:20:06] things you go straight to the legalistic
[1:20:07] side of the word and you'll beat the
[1:20:08] people with it
[1:20:09] so that's for me and brother gerald to
[1:20:10] remember
[1:20:11] that's for us amen now watch the
[1:20:13] progression now as john starts to move
[1:20:15] and he's really starting to get onto
[1:20:16] love with us
[1:20:17] and he says no man has seen god at any
[1:20:19] time
[1:20:20] if we love one another
[1:20:23] god dwelleth in us
[1:20:24] and his love is
[1:20:27] perfected
[1:20:28] in us
[1:20:30] his love is perfected god's love is
[1:20:32] perfected he didn't say god's love is
[1:20:34] perfect
[1:20:35] in us he says god's love is perfected
[1:20:39] you know what that means
[1:20:41] it means there's a progression
[1:20:43] it means that there's a growth it means
[1:20:44] that he puts something in and in you it
[1:20:47] comes to perfection it comes to maturity
[1:20:49] it comes to completion amen we are an
[1:20:52] expression of his love and he's bringing
[1:20:54] us to a place of perfect love that
[1:20:56] reflects christ perfectly amen now each
[1:20:59] one of us is going to have a portion of
[1:21:01] that and it's going to be expressed a
[1:21:02] different way that's why we have
[1:21:03] different gifts and different roles and
[1:21:05] different positions in the body because
[1:21:06] guess what brother mark has a different
[1:21:08] role than brother david has a role has a
[1:21:09] different one than brother joe and
[1:21:10] brother kingsley brother bob and brother
[1:21:12] chad and guess what sister betty's
[1:21:14] different than sister kim and sister
[1:21:15] leah and sister rebecca ask what we're
[1:21:17] all going to express it differently but
[1:21:19] it'll be perfected through you in the
[1:21:21] vein that you're supposed to to put it
[1:21:23] out to the rest of the world amen
[1:21:25] now listen the fruit of the spirit is
[1:21:26] required of all of us
[1:21:28] right
[1:21:29] but love's at the top and that's because
[1:21:31] the holy spirit dwells in each one of us
[1:21:32] and that's got to be there no matter who
[1:21:34] you are but it'll still be displayed in
[1:21:35] certain ways for each and every one of
[1:21:37] our lives amen but it's perfected in us
[1:21:40] it comes to a place of maturity it comes
[1:21:42] to a place of completion inside of us
[1:21:44] and that's that great big gusher we're
[1:21:46] looking for is that you build it up
[1:21:48] enough that you've got something to give
[1:21:49] to everybody else that it doesn't just
[1:21:50] keep you but now it goes out and starts
[1:21:52] to keep other people as well brother
[1:21:54] brown says brother sister that's what
[1:21:56] the world needs today is some more love
[1:21:58] of god that's what the world's hungry
[1:22:00] for today is more love of god try and
[1:22:02] tell them that though
[1:22:03] try and tell them that
[1:22:05] but they need it even if they don't
[1:22:06] realize it you go to a doctor and he
[1:22:08] says you're short of iron you're short
[1:22:09] of calcium you're short of this and that
[1:22:11] and the other thing and you don't know
[1:22:12] it but as soon as you take it you
[1:22:14] realize that's exactly what i needed
[1:22:16] they don't know what they need but we've
[1:22:17] got what they have need of amen he says
[1:22:20] if we'd show a little more love to one
[1:22:22] another a little more love towards god
[1:22:24] how much better are churches and
[1:22:25] individuals and how much better we'd be
[1:22:28] if we just love one another if we love
[1:22:30] one another then we can love god for god
[1:22:33] is love
[1:22:34] and i've been thinking on this for a
[1:22:35] while months months actually in
[1:22:37] different situations and different
[1:22:39] people and they they talking you know
[1:22:41] what do we do and how do we handle this
[1:22:42] and what are we going to go and do and i
[1:22:44] thought you know what if we look at what
[1:22:47] god's love would do in that situation we
[1:22:48] probably get a lot of clarity many times
[1:22:51] now the thing is god's love has a lot of
[1:22:53] different facets to it right it's not
[1:22:55] all lovey-dovey
[1:22:56] right a hug doesn't resolve every
[1:22:58] situation
[1:22:59] but that's what the world will say if
[1:23:01] you give him a hug then everything will
[1:23:02] be okay listen a hug's no good to
[1:23:04] somebody that's been abused they don't
[1:23:05] want a hug they won't take a hug they
[1:23:06] need something else you know but god's
[1:23:09] love is perfect because it is god god
[1:23:11] himself is love that's what the
[1:23:12] scripture says god is love this is the
[1:23:14] defining attribute of god so in that
[1:23:16] love is power there's direction there's
[1:23:18] provision there's healing everything
[1:23:20] that is god is baked into that idea of
[1:23:22] love amen so if you can say what does
[1:23:24] god's love look like in this situation
[1:23:26] how did christ love in a situation like
[1:23:29] this you know how you need to love in
[1:23:30] that situation now
[1:23:32] right sometimes it's a word fitly spoken
[1:23:34] sometimes it's a word fitly unspoken
[1:23:37] sometimes we need to be quiet
[1:23:39] sometimes we need to talk
[1:23:41] sometimes you need to hug sometimes you
[1:23:42] need to sit back
[1:23:44] sometimes you need to let people go
[1:23:45] sometimes you need to pull them in
[1:23:47] right god's love works in different ways
[1:23:49] in different situations amen but what he
[1:23:51] showed his his love on calvary
[1:23:54] but what he gave his love on the day of
[1:23:56] pentecost
[1:23:57] that's what we're looking at he showed
[1:23:59] his love he proved his love when he gave
[1:24:01] his life
[1:24:02] but then he gave his love on the day of
[1:24:04] pentecost because what he gave us the
[1:24:05] holy spirit which is god's life which is
[1:24:07] god's love
[1:24:08] and that's why it's at the peak here is
[1:24:10] because this is where love can only come
[1:24:11] in is when you have the holy spirit
[1:24:13] inside of you that is the pinnacle of
[1:24:14] your relationship it's the pinnacle of
[1:24:16] your christianity is what love but the
[1:24:19] thing is it starts with love you've got
[1:24:20] to have that love inside of you
[1:24:21] otherwise you're not a believer in the
[1:24:22] first place we read it if god if the
[1:24:24] love of god isn't in you then you have
[1:24:25] no part of him right you're nothing you
[1:24:28] don't have a part of it amen
[1:24:30] we each one of us if we have the new
[1:24:32] birth if we have the holy spirit
[1:24:33] literally have the love of god available
[1:24:35] to us and to those that are around us in
[1:24:37] each and every situation
[1:24:40] now listen to this this is uh this is an
[1:24:42] interesting thing brother branham said
[1:24:43] here he says
[1:24:44] that's the real thing
[1:24:46] about divine healing and the people know
[1:24:48] whether you really mean it or not they
[1:24:50] can tell it and i have learned that in
[1:24:52] my life walk of life to know that you
[1:24:54] cannot get by impersonating something
[1:24:57] you've got to be just what you are
[1:25:00] how would you like just before i start
[1:25:02] my sermon if i will give you a little
[1:25:04] insight of something that's a real
[1:25:05] secret just to me about healing powers
[1:25:07] and so forth like that would you like to
[1:25:09] know a little secret
[1:25:11] by the way i'm saying you want to know
[1:25:12] the secret to divine healing you want to
[1:25:14] know the secret to the gift that he had
[1:25:17] he says all right here it is friend the
[1:25:19] secret of the whole thing
[1:25:21] is divine love
[1:25:24] divine love is the secret to his
[1:25:26] ministry
[1:25:27] he says that's the secret of every bit
[1:25:29] of it is love
[1:25:30] now listen to this he says you can't
[1:25:32] make yourself love
[1:25:34] you've got to have
[1:25:36] love
[1:25:37] so something you possess not something
[1:25:39] you create
[1:25:41] you have it you just have it and it will
[1:25:43] flow out when it needs to flow out if
[1:25:45] you're submitted to the holy spirit he
[1:25:47] says love is something that'll work on
[1:25:49] animal life and it'll work on human life
[1:25:52] and it works before god
[1:25:54] that's pretty amazing you say well it
[1:25:56] was the visions that did it no he says
[1:25:57] that was the love of god moving out into
[1:25:59] the people that did all of those things
[1:26:02] he says i believe paul said in first
[1:26:03] corinthians 13 do i speak with the
[1:26:05] tongue of men and angels and have not
[1:26:06] love or charity it profited me nothing
[1:26:08] though i have all the knowledge to
[1:26:09] understand all the mysteries of god and
[1:26:11] have not love though he could do it it
[1:26:13] profit me nothing and though i have
[1:26:15] faith to move the mountains and have not
[1:26:17] love it profit me nothing where there's
[1:26:19] tongues they'll cease where there's
[1:26:20] prophecies it'll vanish and where
[1:26:21] there's these things will all pass away
[1:26:23] but when love has come it endures
[1:26:25] forever he says love i have seen its
[1:26:28] power
[1:26:29] what all of those things fade when
[1:26:31] perfect love comes
[1:26:33] that's what the scripture says there
[1:26:35] right now he's talking about god's love
[1:26:37] not love god's love you've got to make a
[1:26:40] strong distinction there amen human love
[1:26:42] will get you what the world has today
[1:26:43] and that ain't what we want if you look
[1:26:45] at the the world's love it's variable
[1:26:47] inconsistent prone to emotions prone to
[1:26:49] hormones prone to moral change but god's
[1:26:51] love is always absolute and in line with
[1:26:53] the word it never changes amen god can't
[1:26:56] love you in a way that's contrary to his
[1:26:58] word so don't ask him to act in love in
[1:27:00] your behalf if you're going against the
[1:27:02] word of god because he can't do it and
[1:27:03] love you
[1:27:04] his love will bring you back to the word
[1:27:05] it won't support you while you're
[1:27:06] outside of the word
[1:27:08] and then brother eugene taught me a few
[1:27:09] things and there's a couple key phrases
[1:27:11] that that will always stick with me and
[1:27:14] he said that agape love or god's love is
[1:27:16] based on spiritual growth meaning that
[1:27:18] love has a purpose and god's love has a
[1:27:20] purpose and it is to grow you
[1:27:22] spiritually first and foremost
[1:27:24] amen i've said it before god doesn't
[1:27:26] care about your house god doesn't care
[1:27:28] about your car doesn't god doesn't care
[1:27:29] about your health god doesn't care about
[1:27:31] any of these things if you're not
[1:27:32] spiritually where you need to be so you
[1:27:34] ask him and you say lord bless me with
[1:27:35] this bless me with that bless me with
[1:27:36] this bless me with that and he says son
[1:27:39] daughter you're not even talking to me
[1:27:40] you're not even walking with me you're
[1:27:42] just doing your own thing and now you're
[1:27:43] asking me to bless you no no no i'm not
[1:27:46] going to do it my love is based on
[1:27:47] growing you spiritually growing you into
[1:27:49] the image of god that is meant for you
[1:27:51] and that's the only thing that i care
[1:27:53] about and everything else will have to
[1:27:54] go to the side until you come in line
[1:27:56] with that brother brown would say god
[1:27:58] will get you to the place where he's got
[1:27:59] to lay you flat on your back looking up
[1:28:01] at him with nothing you can do about it
[1:28:03] to get you in back into that
[1:28:05] relationship with him to get you where
[1:28:07] he needs you to be so that he can start
[1:28:09] moving and walking into your life and
[1:28:11] he'll take everything away from you and
[1:28:13] what he'll do is he'll pass everything
[1:28:15] through the fire until all that's left
[1:28:17] is you and him
[1:28:18] now if you commit it to him if it's
[1:28:19] built for his kingdom purpose it'll
[1:28:21] stand guess what if you've committed
[1:28:23] your life to him if you're walking with
[1:28:24] him your business will stand the
[1:28:25] pandemic won't it brother joe well you
[1:28:28] watch if it's not
[1:28:30] it'll go down into the dust
[1:28:32] you watch your marriage do it watch your
[1:28:34] family do it watch your career do it
[1:28:36] whatever it is if it is not in line with
[1:28:38] your kingdom purpose then god will say
[1:28:39] i'll burn it every single time scripture
[1:28:42] talks about it says every man's good his
[1:28:43] works are all going to be judged and if
[1:28:45] they make it through the fire they'll
[1:28:46] stand and he'll have a reward you'll
[1:28:48] never lose your soul if you're a son or
[1:28:49] daughter of god but you lose your reward
[1:28:51] and what you're doing here can be a
[1:28:52] reward because you can be a witness for
[1:28:54] god in your career and your education
[1:28:56] and these different things that you do
[1:28:58] but if you're not in line with his word
[1:29:00] then he can't do anything with you so
[1:29:02] he's going to bring you back to his
[1:29:03] place before he ever starts to bless you
[1:29:05] in those things
[1:29:07] what he's trying to get you where you
[1:29:08] say lord i'm sorry
[1:29:10] i'm not doing what i need to do
[1:29:12] i need to submit my life to you and let
[1:29:14] you work through these things and commit
[1:29:16] it into you the same way that christ did
[1:29:18] now i've read this next quote before but
[1:29:20] it stuck with me ever since i read it
[1:29:22] for me personally
[1:29:26] and he says jesus in his prayers said
[1:29:28] father i sanctify myself
[1:29:31] jesus became sanctified to the church he
[1:29:33] could have gotten married but he didn't
[1:29:34] do it he'd be some come sanctified he
[1:29:36] said sanctify them father through the
[1:29:38] truth thy word is the truth now let's
[1:29:41] lay aside every weight
[1:29:43] you got to wait this morning
[1:29:45] this is the kind of weights he's talking
[1:29:47] about you got a temper
[1:29:50] you got something about you makes you
[1:29:51] talk when you ought not to talk he says
[1:29:53] oh god lay it there now lay it there and
[1:29:56] watch the fire of the altar come down
[1:29:58] and take it away watch the
[1:30:01] love of god lick it up
[1:30:04] what consume what you're dealing with
[1:30:06] with love
[1:30:08] and let that now burn inside of you amen
[1:30:11] right because the love of god is
[1:30:13] unquenchable the fire of god is
[1:30:14] unquenchable once it starts burning
[1:30:16] it'll keep burning until that's gone
[1:30:18] right it'll keep burning until it's gone
[1:30:20] if you'll let it
[1:30:22] if you don't douse it
[1:30:24] he says watch all that old selfishness
[1:30:26] the way you've been talking to your wife
[1:30:28] the way you've been talking to your
[1:30:29] husband the way you've been talking to
[1:30:30] your neighbor the way you've talked
[1:30:32] about the people in the church lay it on
[1:30:34] the altar this morning and the fire of
[1:30:36] god will come down and take it right
[1:30:37] away and divine love will burn in its
[1:30:40] place
[1:30:41] that's how you know that god's done a
[1:30:43] work is when love replaces everything
[1:30:45] else that you've had
[1:30:46] right when that irritation when that
[1:30:48] frustration when that pain when that
[1:30:50] hurt when that offense of nature
[1:30:51] whatever it might be when that is gone
[1:30:53] and you've got love residing in its
[1:30:55] place that's when you know the god the
[1:30:56] working of god is complete in your life
[1:30:58] amen he finishes with this he says you
[1:31:00] got sickness
[1:31:02] lay it on the altar and say lord here it
[1:31:04] is created me a clean spirit create in
[1:31:08] me a healing power see what god will do
[1:31:11] and god will do it this morning you know
[1:31:13] this is from the message enticing
[1:31:14] spirits how do you get rid of a spirit
[1:31:17] you like
[1:31:18] yeah that's right
[1:31:19] listen we like some of our spirits
[1:31:21] it's why we still have them
[1:31:24] okay
[1:31:26] this is in our this is in our kitchen
[1:31:27] now we like it don't we sometimes
[1:31:30] our carnality likes it guess what i'm
[1:31:33] built a certain way i got half of my dad
[1:31:35] and half my mom in here and guess what
[1:31:37] genetically we like certain things
[1:31:40] and guess what i can let a spirit get in
[1:31:41] and start to feed on those things i've
[1:31:42] talked about i love motorcycles i love
[1:31:44] cars anything with an engine i can get a
[1:31:46] spirit on me real quick if i start to
[1:31:48] dwell on those things
[1:31:49] right and it'll pull me down a rabbit
[1:31:51] hole that i don't need to go down
[1:31:53] right and each one of us has these
[1:31:54] things whether it's genetic whether it's
[1:31:56] sometimes we have family traditions
[1:31:57] sometimes we have church traditions
[1:31:59] sometimes we have those little besetting
[1:32:01] sins that we just got something in us
[1:32:02] likes to do it and guess what that's an
[1:32:04] enticing spirit because there's
[1:32:06] something in you that likes it brother
[1:32:08] brahm says you got to let the love of
[1:32:09] god overcome that and burn it out of
[1:32:11] your life until there's nothing left and
[1:32:14] he says that'll go all the way down to
[1:32:15] the healing of the sickness in your body
[1:32:17] let the love of god burn it out amen
[1:32:20] listen he didn't say love will gently
[1:32:22] emit a soft heat
[1:32:25] did he
[1:32:27] listen
[1:32:28] he's a he's a raging fire
[1:32:31] right
[1:32:33] this is this is not a god that just you
[1:32:35] know you can kind of just cup your hands
[1:32:36] around this right
[1:32:38] we're talking about a raging fire that
[1:32:40] destroys the carnality of our very lives
[1:32:43] that's the kind of fire i want and
[1:32:44] that's the kind of love i want working
[1:32:45] in my life amen it's something that'll
[1:32:47] burn out every enticing spirit that's in
[1:32:50] me or that wants to get around me that
[1:32:51] that love will overcome it in my life
[1:32:53] that my love for him
[1:32:55] will reach out and meet with his love
[1:32:56] for me
[1:32:57] and that'll allow him to do the work of
[1:32:59] me that i need done in my life amen what
[1:33:01] does it do this is not a fire that just
[1:33:03] sits there and puts out a bit of heat
[1:33:05] amen it consumes
[1:33:07] right it makes you stand back six feet
[1:33:09] anybody ever built a bonfire that was so
[1:33:10] hot you couldn't really get close
[1:33:13] that's that's the love of god amen it
[1:33:15] reaches out a long ways
[1:33:17] it hasn't affected man it creates light
[1:33:19] doesn't it fire creates light it exposes
[1:33:22] the other things that need to be burnt
[1:33:23] up in your life and what does it do it
[1:33:25] creates a warmth that'll draw other
[1:33:27] people to god as well
[1:33:29] that's when you know you got the love of
[1:33:30] god is when you got something that the
[1:33:31] world wants and people will respond to
[1:33:33] it and guess what believers respond to
[1:33:34] it too that's why people can come into
[1:33:36] our church that have never been here
[1:33:37] before and we can have immediate
[1:33:39] relationship with them is because
[1:33:40] they've got the love of god in their
[1:33:41] life the same way we do and it is not
[1:33:43] the love of god like the way the world
[1:33:45] would explain it but it's the living
[1:33:46] holy spirit in their lives that connects
[1:33:48] with us and brother brown remember he's
[1:33:49] up there in the prayer line he'd say
[1:33:51] you're a believer
[1:33:52] why'd he say that because they had the
[1:33:54] holy spirit he'd say your spirit you've
[1:33:56] got a warm spirit he says i can work
[1:33:58] with this
[1:33:59] now we can talk now we've got a
[1:34:01] connection he says now we can do
[1:34:02] something together because i recognize
[1:34:04] that you got the same thing that i've
[1:34:05] got and if we put both of it together
[1:34:07] then something's going to happen here
[1:34:08] today
[1:34:09] that's the kind of love we're talking
[1:34:10] about that's the fire we're talking
[1:34:11] about amen
[1:34:12] the love of god's supposed to have the
[1:34:14] same effect on us amen it's not just
[1:34:16] lovey-dovey hug your sister hug your
[1:34:17] brother but it's a love that's effective
[1:34:19] on you and on those that experience it
[1:34:21] coming out of you
[1:34:25] listen to this brother brown says take
[1:34:26] the man or woman that would put himself
[1:34:28] down into some cellar and would not see
[1:34:30] the sunshine the natural sunshine that
[1:34:32] god has provided for him but he refuses
[1:34:34] to believe it and because of selfishness
[1:34:37] he shuts himself off
[1:34:39] catch that now selfishness is what
[1:34:41] drives people away from god
[1:34:44] they don't want what he offers or more
[1:34:46] importantly they don't want to give up
[1:34:47] what they have to take what he offers
[1:34:50] right we're holding tightly to things we
[1:34:52] need to hold loosely
[1:34:54] everything in this world we need to hold
[1:34:55] loosely
[1:34:58] he says that man will soon become anemic
[1:35:00] he'll become pale he won't have good
[1:35:02] strength he won't have health and soon
[1:35:04] because he has shut himself off from the
[1:35:07] very privilege that god gave him that's
[1:35:08] right he did it willfully now he's
[1:35:11] talking about an unbeliever
[1:35:12] here but watch this he says
[1:35:16] then if we shut ourselves off from the
[1:35:18] glory of god from the baptism of the
[1:35:20] holy ghost or the fellowship of the
[1:35:22] spirit the first thing you know we
[1:35:23] become pale sickly christians now he
[1:35:26] says you shut yourself off
[1:35:29] god doesn't turn off the taps folks
[1:35:32] we turn it off
[1:35:34] he says our experience is growing out
[1:35:36] dim and when the great great trials come
[1:35:39] we shrink and go back it takes that
[1:35:41] soldier who has lived in the sunlight of
[1:35:43] god it takes that spirit who knows god
[1:35:46] where there is not a wave of doubt they
[1:35:49] can stand in the midst of trouble and
[1:35:51] cry out my redeemer liveth hallelujah
[1:35:54] that's it see
[1:35:55] we shut ourselves off he says we shut
[1:35:58] ourselves off
[1:36:00] how do you shut him off
[1:36:03] turn on something else
[1:36:05] what are you turning
[1:36:08] on they do it automatically
[1:36:11] he's talking about the unbelievers we
[1:36:12] read in the in the previous paragraph
[1:36:14] we do it because we want to do it
[1:36:18] you say brother john a believer shuts
[1:36:20] off the presence of god yep
[1:36:22] get hurt bad enough one time you'll shut
[1:36:23] off the presence of god get offended bad
[1:36:26] enough one time you'll turn off the
[1:36:27] presence of god
[1:36:28] right
[1:36:30] see god not answer a prayer once or
[1:36:32] twice
[1:36:33] and you turn off the presence of god
[1:36:35] there's all sorts of ways to turn off
[1:36:37] the presence of god and it's because we
[1:36:38] get selfish or we get offended usually
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:43] us christians we have to choose to turn
[1:36:45] off that presence right
[1:36:47] brother brown said that what the crying
[1:36:49] of a baby in the service can impact and
[1:36:51] push away the holy spirit for the next
[1:36:53] service amen if it's that sensitive
[1:36:56] then what are we doing in our lives that
[1:36:57] would turn him off
[1:37:00] right
[1:37:01] anything that feeds on belief
[1:37:03] anything that's of the world
[1:37:05] anything that is an enticing spirit or
[1:37:07] has potential to be it that's going to
[1:37:09] push him away that's going to turn it
[1:37:10] off and sometimes we don't turn it off
[1:37:12] what we do is we turn it down to a
[1:37:13] trickle
[1:37:14] and guess what a trickle will keep you
[1:37:15] alive but that's about it
[1:37:17] that's about it
[1:37:19] if you had to if you couldn't turn on
[1:37:20] your tap and get a glass of water every
[1:37:22] time you needed but you had to sit there
[1:37:23] and wait for it to drip out one drip at
[1:37:25] a time you had to sit there for three
[1:37:26] hours to get a cup full of water guess
[1:37:28] what you'd get real sick real quick
[1:37:29] wouldn't you
[1:37:30] because it's not gushing out it's not
[1:37:32] coming out right when you need it it's
[1:37:33] the same thing sometimes it's not that
[1:37:34] we turn him off it's that we turn him
[1:37:36] down to such a level that he really
[1:37:37] can't do anything for us and we're
[1:37:38] barely staying alive in our christian
[1:37:40] walks
[1:37:42] amen but listen to this
[1:37:43] this is beautiful
[1:37:46] but god is good
[1:37:48] he provides it for us too many today
[1:37:50] don't want to get into that healthy
[1:37:52] place with god a healthy christian and
[1:37:54] have a healthy spirit you certainly
[1:37:56] would rally for a healthy body anybody
[1:37:58] would sure
[1:37:59] he says well that body no matter how
[1:38:01] much health you put in that body it's
[1:38:03] going back to the dust but oh my brother
[1:38:06] that soul cannot get too healthy and
[1:38:08] every time it grows it grows in the
[1:38:10] strength and the grace and the power of
[1:38:13] god we need to walk in the sunlight of
[1:38:16] god because he is
[1:38:18] good
[1:38:20] good he's always good how many times
[1:38:23] have we heard it how many times brother
[1:38:24] joe say all things work together for the
[1:38:27] good to them who are the called
[1:38:30] everything about god is good for you
[1:38:33] even when it doesn't seem like it
[1:38:35] anybody ever been through a trial in
[1:38:37] their christian walk
[1:38:39] everyone
[1:38:40] except brother gerald this time
[1:38:44] we are the trial
[1:38:46] we've all been through a trial
[1:38:48] how many of us said this is fantastic
[1:38:51] loving this trial
[1:38:54] said nobody ever i'm loving this trial
[1:38:57] right but still for your good
[1:38:59] and guess what every one of us if we're
[1:39:01] believers we can look back on that trial
[1:39:03] and say praise the lord
[1:39:05] like job my redeemer liveth amen right
[1:39:08] marva didn't relevant he did what he
[1:39:09] said he was going to do he brought me to
[1:39:11] a place i couldn't get unless i went
[1:39:12] through that trial you praise him after
[1:39:14] but it's really hard to praise him going
[1:39:16] through it
[1:39:16] but everything about god is good we have
[1:39:19] a great heritage he says a sacred trust
[1:39:22] that's been given to us
[1:39:24] what keep the taps on
[1:39:26] stay in his presence
[1:39:28] was that what was that that pamphlet or
[1:39:29] that little book called practicing the
[1:39:31] presence
[1:39:32] practicing the presence is what a
[1:39:34] believer of this day ought to be doing
[1:39:35] every single day we ought to be going
[1:39:37] into the presence of god every single
[1:39:40] day not a here i lay me down to sleep
[1:39:42] pray the lord my soul
[1:39:43] that's not going into the presence
[1:39:45] right but dedicating time to talk to him
[1:39:48] and let him talk to you to get into his
[1:39:51] presence it changes you
[1:39:53] it changes you amen and hold on to it
[1:39:55] and hold on to it and seek it and guess
[1:39:57] what you dwell on him he draws near to
[1:39:59] you
[1:40:00] right scripture says draw near to him
[1:40:02] and he'll draw near to you
[1:40:03] right dwell on him think about him you
[1:40:05] want god in your life think about him
[1:40:07] dwell on him meditate on him that's what
[1:40:08] david did david was great at meditating
[1:40:10] wasn't he dwelling on the things of god
[1:40:12] and that's when god would come to him
[1:40:13] each and every single time
[1:40:15] praise the lord first john 14 13 says
[1:40:18] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[1:40:21] he and us because he had given us of his
[1:40:24] spirit
[1:40:25] you can't have it without the holy
[1:40:26] spirit
[1:40:27] you cannot have it the new birth is the
[1:40:29] holy spirit it is not a name on a book
[1:40:32] it's not signing up for something it's
[1:40:33] not the sinner's prayer it is the holy
[1:40:35] spirit dwelling inside of you your proof
[1:40:38] of god's love is that he gives you
[1:40:39] something capital s and that something
[1:40:42] causes you to live and love the way he
[1:40:43] did amen right
[1:40:45] this is something capital s something
[1:40:48] that the world can't give and the world
[1:40:50] can't take it away amen
[1:40:52] this is brother brahman he's talking
[1:40:53] about the church on the original day of
[1:40:54] pentecost he says look they were full of
[1:40:57] the new wine that's right the wine that
[1:40:59] come from god out of heaven did you ever
[1:41:01] see a drunk man he's just in love with
[1:41:03] everybody you see he don't care that's
[1:41:06] the way a man is when he gets drunk on
[1:41:07] the spirit the bible said be not drunk
[1:41:09] on strong drink with excess but to be
[1:41:11] drunk on the spirit the spirit of god
[1:41:14] makes you so drunk you forget all your
[1:41:16] enemies and everything everybody is in
[1:41:18] love with you
[1:41:20] how many of us could say that
[1:41:23] everybody's in love with you
[1:41:25] i don't even think we can say within the
[1:41:26] church
[1:41:27] much less everybody else
[1:41:30] amen we're being honest this morning
[1:41:36] the spirit of god makes you so drunk you
[1:41:38] forget all your enemies starts with you
[1:41:42] he says in everything everybody's in
[1:41:44] love with you i look at that more
[1:41:47] if i can put my interpretation to it
[1:41:48] this is us thus saith jonathan corlett
[1:41:50] what he's saying is that the spirit of
[1:41:52] god makes you so drunk that you look at
[1:41:54] everyone as if they're in love with you
[1:41:56] you know
[1:41:57] that you'll say they love me even if
[1:41:59] they don't act it
[1:42:01] they love me even if they don't realize
[1:42:02] it
[1:42:05] potentially they love me
[1:42:08] that's usually where we end up
[1:42:09] potentially they love me
[1:42:10] but what he's saying is you look through
[1:42:12] you look through drunk goggles that
[1:42:13] think everybody likes you
[1:42:15] because what you're so full of love
[1:42:17] that it just overwhelms anything that
[1:42:19] anybody else might throw your way
[1:42:21] he says you don't care who's standing
[1:42:22] around you you're the biggest man in the
[1:42:24] country right then those are strong
[1:42:26] words
[1:42:27] strong drink
[1:42:28] strong meat
[1:42:29] for us amen that we would look at
[1:42:31] everyone and say i love them so much
[1:42:33] that it that i think they love me that's
[1:42:35] a powerful love that says they love me
[1:42:36] because i love them
[1:42:39] i don't know much about drunks
[1:42:41] never been drunk
[1:42:43] i probably run into a couple you know on
[1:42:45] the street occasionally but i've heard
[1:42:46] there's two kinds of drunks
[1:42:49] brother brahms talking about the
[1:42:50] friendly drunk
[1:42:51] and that's supposed to be people that
[1:42:52] are drunk on the spirit amen everybody
[1:42:54] is their friend everything's good
[1:42:57] everything's happy everything's gonna be
[1:42:58] good
[1:42:59] that's what he's talking about but
[1:43:01] there's another kind of drunk
[1:43:03] and that's a mean drunk
[1:43:05] again i haven't experienced that one but
[1:43:08] i've been told about them
[1:43:10] and that's a drunk that's got a chip on
[1:43:11] their shoulder
[1:43:12] when they're normal when they're not
[1:43:14] drunk they may be the nicest person on
[1:43:16] the planet but when they get drunk they
[1:43:18] turn mean and they've got a chip on
[1:43:20] their shoulder they're looking for
[1:43:21] fights they're looking to take offense
[1:43:23] they're looking to get people riled up
[1:43:24] they're looking for any reason to start
[1:43:26] a fight
[1:43:27] right they refuse to give way to allow
[1:43:30] somebody you're walking down the aisle
[1:43:31] of the bar or walking down and they're
[1:43:33] there and they'll put their shoulder out
[1:43:35] there just to bump you just to say you
[1:43:37] bumped me
[1:43:38] right they'll put something out there to
[1:43:40] get you
[1:43:41] to what
[1:43:42] flashback at them and then they say all
[1:43:43] right it's on the next thing you know
[1:43:45] you're breaking bottles over their head
[1:43:46] and you're you're punching them and
[1:43:47] everything like that that's what a mean
[1:43:49] drunk is right the only reason they'll
[1:43:50] start a conversation with you is in
[1:43:52] hopes of getting into a fight with you
[1:43:54] right that's a mean drunk amen
[1:43:56] that satan's kind of drunk
[1:43:58] that's not the kind of drunk a believer
[1:43:59] supposed to be if they're in the holy
[1:44:00] spirit they're not out looking for
[1:44:02] fights
[1:44:03] right
[1:44:03] that's the last thing we're doing is
[1:44:04] looking for fights guess what the fights
[1:44:06] are going to come to us no matter what
[1:44:07] we don't need to go looking for them
[1:44:08] that's the last thing we need to do is
[1:44:10] go looking for fights
[1:44:12] speaking of fights james 4 says from
[1:44:14] whence come wars and fightings among you
[1:44:17] come they not thence even of your lusts
[1:44:19] that warn your members what's he saying
[1:44:21] carnality is what causes problems in the
[1:44:23] church
[1:44:24] right it's not god it's human human
[1:44:25] tendencies it's when you want what you
[1:44:27] want more than preferring your brother
[1:44:28] and sister amen
[1:44:30] he says you lust and you have not you
[1:44:32] kill and desire to have and cannot
[1:44:33] obtain you fight in war yet you have not
[1:44:36] because you ask not so you're doing all
[1:44:38] these things to get something and he
[1:44:40] says you still don't get it
[1:44:43] listen it says that last bit says yet ye
[1:44:45] have not because you ask not why because
[1:44:47] you're trying and you're trying and
[1:44:48] you're trying and you're trying to do it
[1:44:50] your way and you're going to do with
[1:44:51] your gifts and you're going to do with
[1:44:52] your education your business smarts and
[1:44:54] you're going to do with your
[1:44:54] relationships and your contacts and your
[1:44:56] influence in the community and all these
[1:44:57] different things and he says all you're
[1:44:59] doing is causing fights and you're
[1:45:02] killing your testimony
[1:45:04] and you're killing your effect on the
[1:45:05] people around you as a believer and then
[1:45:07] he says you're wrong because you have
[1:45:08] not because you don't ask for it
[1:45:11] you're supposed to ask god commit it to
[1:45:13] god and then just keep moving he says
[1:45:15] that's how a child of god gets things is
[1:45:17] they go to the provider
[1:45:19] amen the problem is so often we're
[1:45:20] trying to provide for ourselves he says
[1:45:22] stop trying to do it yourself ask him
[1:45:25] trust him commit it to him and keep
[1:45:27] walking on if you're gonna try and do it
[1:45:29] all on yourself get ready for a fight
[1:45:31] because guess what you're going to do it
[1:45:32] the human way and you're going to get a
[1:45:33] fight every single time because somebody
[1:45:35] else is going to want the same piece of
[1:45:36] land you want somebody else to want the
[1:45:38] same piece of business you want somebody
[1:45:39] else going to want the same relationship
[1:45:40] you want you're going to get into fights
[1:45:42] and he's saying these are the reasons
[1:45:43] you have fights amongst you
[1:45:45] he says you ask he says then when you
[1:45:46] finally say okay i've had enough it's
[1:45:49] not working out then he says you ask and
[1:45:50] receive not because you ask amiss that
[1:45:52] you may consume it upon your lust so
[1:45:54] when you've done everything you can it
[1:45:55] doesn't work out then he says you go to
[1:45:57] god and you ask and then you don't get
[1:45:58] it because you're still asking for for
[1:46:00] selfish reasons for carnal reasons
[1:46:02] rather than for kingdom purpose reasons
[1:46:04] and god says sorry i can't give that to
[1:46:05] you because you're my child
[1:46:08] i won't give it to you specifically
[1:46:10] because you're my child if it was
[1:46:11] anybody in the world they'd just get it
[1:46:13] satan will give it to him but i won't
[1:46:14] give it to you because you're asking it
[1:46:16] for the wrong reasons
[1:46:18] he says you adulterers and adulteresses
[1:46:20] know ye not that the friendship of the
[1:46:21] world is enmity with god why is he
[1:46:23] calling them that he's saying you're
[1:46:24] cheaters why because you're blending
[1:46:27] what the world and the word
[1:46:29] he says you're blending your
[1:46:30] christianity with your carnality and all
[1:46:32] that's coming out of it is fights in the
[1:46:34] church knock it off
[1:46:36] he says whosoever therefore will be a
[1:46:38] friend of the world is the enemy of god
[1:46:41] wow the enemy of god
[1:46:43] he says do you think that the scripture
[1:46:45] says in vain the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:46:47] us lester's envy listen in this body
[1:46:50] we've got three realms right we've got
[1:46:51] body soul and spirit the spirit
[1:46:54] potentially and certainly the body
[1:46:56] that's that's satan's realm
[1:46:58] so he says naturally in this body the
[1:47:00] spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy
[1:47:03] envy is to want to have what somebody
[1:47:04] else has
[1:47:05] he says that's the nature that's human
[1:47:07] nature you get people saying human
[1:47:08] nature is kind and good in love no no
[1:47:10] scripture says the spirit that dwells in
[1:47:11] us lusts to envy
[1:47:13] that's natural for us he says oh this is
[1:47:16] beautiful but he giveth more grace
[1:47:22] i can say that for me
[1:47:24] he gave more grace
[1:47:26] and he gave more grace and he gave more
[1:47:28] grace and he's still giving more grace
[1:47:30] because what he's trying to drive that
[1:47:32] out completely that he's spirit of that
[1:47:34] so that the holy spirit can have what
[1:47:36] total preeminence in my life and that's
[1:47:39] the grace of god that allows us
[1:47:41] amen he giveth more grace wherefore he
[1:47:44] saith god resisteth the proud but giveth
[1:47:47] grace unto the
[1:47:48] unto the humble amen now he'll let us
[1:47:51] fall and get messed up time and time
[1:47:52] again
[1:47:54] that's no problem to god gotta let us
[1:47:55] fall but he'll pick us up and that's the
[1:47:57] grace side bring us back in say you want
[1:47:59] to try this again yes lord let's go
[1:48:01] again you fall you want to try it again
[1:48:03] yes lord and he'll keep doing it until
[1:48:05] you learn your lesson
[1:48:06] he keeps picking you up and bringing you
[1:48:08] into his presence that's his grace to us
[1:48:10] his grace is always there to receive us
[1:48:12] back
[1:48:13] he says submit yourselves therefore to
[1:48:15] god resist the devil and he will flee
[1:48:17] from you draw nigh to god and he will
[1:48:19] draw an eye to you cleanse your hands ye
[1:48:21] sinners and purify your hearts ye
[1:48:23] double-minded what's he saying make up
[1:48:25] your mind and stick to it now this
[1:48:27] christian walk is not a make up your
[1:48:28] mind type of thing
[1:48:30] it's a new birth type of thing
[1:48:32] make up your mind to get the new birth
[1:48:34] is really what he's saying
[1:48:35] and then when you got it stick with it
[1:48:37] don't go back and forth remember what we
[1:48:39] talked about the one the one that's
[1:48:40] sitting on the fence is the most
[1:48:41] miserable of all because they're not
[1:48:43] committed either side and it really
[1:48:44] hurts in their mid region
[1:48:46] right you don't want to stay on the
[1:48:47] fence he's saying get off the fence get
[1:48:49] to one side or get to the other get out
[1:48:51] of our way or get with us
[1:48:53] right
[1:48:54] cleanse your hands get out of whatever
[1:48:56] it is that's causing you these issues
[1:48:57] and get on the right side he says be
[1:49:00] afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[1:49:02] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[1:49:03] joy to heaviness and everybody said no
[1:49:05] thanks
[1:49:07] how many would read that verse verse
[1:49:09] nine be afflicted mourn weep let your
[1:49:11] laughter be turned to mourning your joy
[1:49:13] to heaviness and say yes please
[1:49:15] i'd like some of that give me a big
[1:49:17] plate of verse 9.
[1:49:20] no
[1:49:21] we don't want it
[1:49:22] we don't want it
[1:49:24] but if you don't do it you don't get
[1:49:25] verse 10. humble yourselves in the sight
[1:49:28] of the lord and he shall lift you up
[1:49:32] he'll lift you up if you can only humble
[1:49:34] yourself yes
[1:49:37] my
[1:49:38] speak not evil of one another brethren
[1:49:41] he that speaketh the evil of his brother
[1:49:43] and judges his brother speaketh evil of
[1:49:45] the law and judges the law but if thou
[1:49:47] judge the law of thou art not a doer of
[1:49:49] the law but a judge
[1:49:50] what's he saying don't be a mean drunk
[1:49:54] so he's saying don't be a mean drunk
[1:49:56] don't go around picking fights don't go
[1:49:57] around talking
[1:49:59] right
[1:50:00] don't go back to the law
[1:50:02] let's move to grace
[1:50:04] listen we're under a covenant of grace
[1:50:05] now
[1:50:06] the law is supposed to be dead you can
[1:50:08] go to the law you want to go the law god
[1:50:11] will let you go to the law but you don't
[1:50:12] want to be under the law you
[1:50:14] believe me you want to be under the
[1:50:15] covenant of grace right now that's for
[1:50:17] sure amen now you say well brother john
[1:50:20] he's wrong
[1:50:21] she's wrong
[1:50:23] have to do with anything
[1:50:25] listen if somebody's genuinely wrong and
[1:50:27] you have a burden
[1:50:29] a burden
[1:50:30] for them
[1:50:32] go talk to them
[1:50:34] but don't go talk to them because
[1:50:35] they're wrong
[1:50:36] go talk to them because you have a
[1:50:37] burden for them
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:39] because what love has a purpose
[1:50:42] and that purpose is to do something is
[1:50:44] to help them be restored to the word of
[1:50:47] god amen what don't talk about them
[1:50:50] go talk to them in love
[1:50:52] and they'll recognize if you're coming
[1:50:53] in love
[1:50:55] now let me stop right here and say this
[1:50:58] if you're dealing with a child
[1:51:00] a scriptural child
[1:51:02] they're not going to recognize love most
[1:51:04] times because guess what your kids
[1:51:06] recognize love when you're hugging them
[1:51:08] they don't recognize love when you're
[1:51:09] spanking them
[1:51:10] okay
[1:51:11] so there's going to be difficult times
[1:51:13] if you're dealing with an immature
[1:51:14] believer
[1:51:15] it's not going to go over so well
[1:51:17] is it
[1:51:18] and that's when you got to have maturity
[1:51:20] to be able to walk away because they're
[1:51:21] not your kid
[1:51:23] they're not your kid
[1:51:25] right they're a child of god
[1:51:26] and you say lord i'm going with the
[1:51:28] right attitude going with the right
[1:51:29] spirit
[1:51:30] i'm going to go talk i'm going to go try
[1:51:32] and help them
[1:51:33] but if they don't take it lord i'll walk
[1:51:35] away and it will have nothing to do with
[1:51:36] me not gonna get offended i'm not gonna
[1:51:38] get hurt i'm not gonna go tell brother
[1:51:39] so-and-so not gonna tell sister
[1:51:40] so-and-so i'm just gonna take it to you
[1:51:42] and leave it with you and commit it in
[1:51:44] prayer and let you work with them
[1:51:46] where is hands and feet where is mouth
[1:51:49] guess what the holy spirit doesn't get
[1:51:50] up here and without a man here and speak
[1:51:52] to the church that's not the way it
[1:51:53] works
[1:51:54] whether we like it or not you're stuck
[1:51:56] with brother gerald and i speaking for
[1:51:57] the holy spirit that's literally what
[1:51:59] we've got to believe
[1:52:00] you got to believe that that's what's
[1:52:01] happening up here will never be of help
[1:52:03] to you
[1:52:04] but guess what in the end it's between
[1:52:05] you and god whether you accept it
[1:52:07] it's that simple
[1:52:08] and that's it and guess what we're not
[1:52:10] going to beat down your doors to try and
[1:52:11] force it
[1:52:12] right we don't want legalistic believers
[1:52:15] right
[1:52:16] but we don't get into a big fuss about
[1:52:17] because when you get into a fuss that's
[1:52:19] when satan has a door to get in
[1:52:21] when you start fussing about things
[1:52:23] that's when satan has an open door to
[1:52:24] come into the situation why because you
[1:52:26] you know why we fuss it's because we're
[1:52:28] caught up in who's right
[1:52:30] rather than the purpose of the
[1:52:32] conversation or the issue which is to
[1:52:34] get you back to the word
[1:52:36] it becomes about you rather than the
[1:52:38] word and that's when the fussing starts
[1:52:40] let me give you a quote for it brother
[1:52:41] brown says this now i said to brother
[1:52:43] schism and brother ness to answer your
[1:52:45] question i said now i do not take either
[1:52:47] side with you brethren and i know as
[1:52:49] long as you fuss you both are wrong
[1:52:52] fussing is what he's talking about what
[1:52:53] back and forth back and forth he said
[1:52:55] she said he said he said back and forth
[1:52:57] he says that's never going to be right
[1:52:59] let your yay be a your navy nay and then
[1:53:01] walk away if you can't if you can't
[1:53:02] resolve it
[1:53:04] he says because i would rather be wrong
[1:53:06] in my doctrine and right in my heart
[1:53:07] than to be right in my doctrine and
[1:53:08] wrong in my heart see i said after all
[1:53:11] it's your heart's condition
[1:53:14] so what god looked at look god looked
[1:53:16] past a lot of david's flaws
[1:53:18] david was far from perfect
[1:53:20] david had some pretty big hang-ups if
[1:53:21] you look at you talk about adulterers
[1:53:22] and adulteresses david was one of them a
[1:53:25] murderer an adulterer
[1:53:27] right this was not a man that was
[1:53:29] perfect but god looked at his heart
[1:53:32] and david got away with things that
[1:53:33] nobody else got away with because god
[1:53:35] looked at his heart now david still got
[1:53:36] correction
[1:53:38] right we don't get away we pay for what
[1:53:39] this flesh does
[1:53:41] right right be not mocked god is not
[1:53:43] mocked right whatsoever man souls that
[1:53:45] shall he also reap grace does not do
[1:53:47] that grace is what allows us to reap
[1:53:48] what we sow so we learn the lesson
[1:53:51] grace is what allows us to see the
[1:53:52] lesson so that we don't do it again as
[1:53:54] well amen
[1:53:56] but you're going to pay for what you do
[1:53:58] in the flesh but god's looking at your
[1:53:59] heart
[1:54:00] and you ought to be able to say lord i
[1:54:02] did it
[1:54:04] but i really didn't i didn't mean to do
[1:54:06] it and that's not the way i it's not the
[1:54:07] way i lean lord i got caught up in
[1:54:09] something
[1:54:10] right i got caught up in something went
[1:54:12] down a dark path i shouldn't have walked
[1:54:14] down but lord you know my heart
[1:54:17] what is it we got dry usually
[1:54:20] very few people have been in the
[1:54:21] presence of god and then go get caught
[1:54:22] up in pornography
[1:54:24] go out and cheat on their wife
[1:54:27] right
[1:54:28] that doesn't happen
[1:54:30] you get dry and then god takes then you
[1:54:33] go a place that's what your lust leads
[1:54:34] you there and all of a sudden you're in
[1:54:36] a place where you're in problems it's
[1:54:38] not because god left you it's because
[1:54:39] you turned off god and walked away and
[1:54:41] now you've got a problem
[1:54:43] right but your heart is still right your
[1:54:45] heart's still right you just got dried
[1:54:46] out a little bit
[1:54:47] that's all
[1:54:48] we don't beat ourselves up
[1:54:50] just get back into the water get back
[1:54:53] into the presence get back into the love
[1:54:54] of god amen
[1:54:56] brother brown continues he says even if
[1:54:58] we can disagree with a person if we
[1:54:59] can't do it in a brotherly way see if
[1:55:02] christ is in the heart if christ is in
[1:55:04] the heart then no matter how much you
[1:55:06] disagree with the men you've still got
[1:55:08] love and for him and respect
[1:55:11] that's a tough one
[1:55:13] i think us ministers can be the worst of
[1:55:15] that will absolutely destroy a man from
[1:55:17] this pulpit because he doesn't believe
[1:55:19] the way we believe
[1:55:20] listen
[1:55:21] you had the prophet of the age and
[1:55:23] almost nobody had the truth and you
[1:55:25] don't see him destroying men over the
[1:55:26] pulpit like that
[1:55:27] right
[1:55:28] now listen sure you probably aren't
[1:55:30] going to send people to a brother's
[1:55:31] church if you don't think he's preaching
[1:55:32] right you got no no right to true him
[1:55:34] down over the pulpit that's not what
[1:55:36] this is for we're here to preach the
[1:55:37] word
[1:55:38] right
[1:55:38] not to preach it out of somebody else
[1:55:41] he says i disagree with many men many
[1:55:43] times that's putting it lightly
[1:55:47] but still i've never seen one yet i
[1:55:48] disagree with that i ever thought of any
[1:55:50] more than put my arm around him and call
[1:55:52] him my brother and try to help him the
[1:55:54] best i could i disagree with him because
[1:55:56] i think that maybe upon disagreeing that
[1:55:58] what he believes that i might not
[1:56:00] believe just like him and so forth but
[1:56:02] now i might try to project my way to him
[1:56:04] as he projects his to me and get them
[1:56:06] together and comb out and see what we
[1:56:08] got but disagreements like that just as
[1:56:10] far as it comes to we should never get
[1:56:12] angry or want to hurt or destroy or
[1:56:15] anything we should always be trying to
[1:56:18] build up amen amen
[1:56:21] i believe brother bryant said something
[1:56:23] to the this will be a massive paraphrase
[1:56:25] but he says add to what they have don't
[1:56:26] destroy what they have
[1:56:28] find the truth they've got and it might
[1:56:30] only be that jesus saves
[1:56:32] and build off of that don't destroy
[1:56:35] their their baptist background don't
[1:56:37] destroy their catholic background build
[1:56:39] on the one thing that you can find and
[1:56:41] it may only be one thing build on the
[1:56:42] one thing they've got that's true
[1:56:44] and build on that and the rest will
[1:56:46] crumble
[1:56:47] because it's not a part of the building
[1:56:48] anymore and they're not going to keep
[1:56:49] building on it if they accept the truth
[1:56:51] that'll fall away in time build on what
[1:56:53] is solid in their life and leave the
[1:56:54] rest to god and let him take it out amen
[1:56:58] praise the lord
[1:56:59] what
[1:57:01] never get angry or want to hurt or
[1:57:02] destroy or anything we're talking about
[1:57:04] god's love now
[1:57:06] he says a little brother come not long
[1:57:07] ago a little church of christ brother
[1:57:09] and oh he stood up there and he said
[1:57:10] this guy's a devil brother branham
[1:57:12] said he says of the holy ghost he says
[1:57:14] there's no such a thing well only the 12
[1:57:16] apostles have received the holy ghost
[1:57:18] and divine healing was only given to
[1:57:19] those 12 apostles and went on about a
[1:57:21] half hour and i said just a moment
[1:57:23] brother i think you ought to give me a
[1:57:24] chance to defend this see then brother
[1:57:26] brown kind of gives a rebuttal i left it
[1:57:28] out for the sake of time but then he
[1:57:29] continues and he says but after it was
[1:57:31] over
[1:57:33] he said but i said i forgive you for
[1:57:34] calling me a devil because i know you
[1:57:36] didn't mean that and then when he got
[1:57:38] finished he come and he said there's one
[1:57:40] thing i can say
[1:57:41] you have the spirit of christ
[1:57:45] i said now brother which am i a devil or
[1:57:47] of christ
[1:57:49] how can i be how can i have the spirit
[1:57:50] of christ and not actually preach of
[1:57:52] christ it's impossible right he can't
[1:57:55] deny himself so there's a problem
[1:57:57] i'm sure that brother maybe walked away
[1:57:59] a little stumped with it
[1:58:00] especially when you have a man that's
[1:58:02] healing the sick amen and he's saying he
[1:58:04] doesn't believe it and it's happening in
[1:58:05] front of him
[1:58:06] he says see but i tell you see because
[1:58:08] that man he could tell that i loved him
[1:58:11] no matter he was disagreeing and
[1:58:13] horribly disagreeing and lambasting
[1:58:15] we don't use that word lambasting
[1:58:17] basically means just hitting you over
[1:58:18] and over and over again verbally he says
[1:58:20] he did all that to me but in the end he
[1:58:22] said he had the brother abraham you've
[1:58:24] got the spirit of christ i'll give you
[1:58:25] that much don't agree with you still but
[1:58:27] i'll give you this much you got the
[1:58:28] spirit of christ
[1:58:29] he says if you can't disagree with a man
[1:58:32] and things and then shake his hand and
[1:58:33] still have the same feelings toward him
[1:58:35] then there's something wrong with you if
[1:58:38] i can't disagree with a man
[1:58:40] bitterly from one side to the other what
[1:58:42] he's saying if you can't have a
[1:58:43] conversation and you don't agree on
[1:58:45] anything
[1:58:47] anything
[1:58:48] and still think of much as much of him
[1:58:51] as christ would then there's something
[1:58:52] wrong with my spirit
[1:58:55] he says i haven't the spirit of christ
[1:58:57] see if he says well brother brahma i
[1:58:58] believe you're teaching is this that all
[1:59:00] right brother let's come together to
[1:59:01] reason you and i will take it ourselves
[1:59:03] we'll go over in the room to ourself and
[1:59:05] we'll reason it out
[1:59:06] he said if you've got a disagreement go
[1:59:08] sort it out
[1:59:09] don't talk to the pastor don't talk to
[1:59:11] the deacon don't talk to mom don't talk
[1:59:12] to dad go sort it out
[1:59:14] let's sort it out amongst ourselves if
[1:59:15] we can
[1:59:17] now listen to what happens in that room
[1:59:19] and he just cuts me to pieces
[1:59:22] and i have to say things back to him
[1:59:24] oh this is going to be a lovey-dovey
[1:59:26] conversation no
[1:59:27] sometimes it's a hard conversation isn't
[1:59:29] it he says he cuts me to pieces now i
[1:59:31] don't believe brother brad and ryle back
[1:59:32] at him but brother brown probably had to
[1:59:34] say things back that weren't easy for
[1:59:36] that man to hear
[1:59:38] he says if in my heart i can't feel the
[1:59:41] same about him that he's still my
[1:59:42] brother and i'm trying to help him then
[1:59:44] i'll never help him there's no way for
[1:59:46] me to help him if i don't love him
[1:59:48] what's the use of going over there
[1:59:50] wow
[1:59:51] but you're right brother brown doesn't
[1:59:52] matter if i don't have the right spirit
[1:59:55] tell him the first place brother i don't
[1:59:57] love you and let me get that out of my
[1:59:58] heart right here before we go in there
[2:00:00] because i can't help you until i love
[2:00:03] you
[2:00:04] wow
[2:00:05] wow
[2:00:06] that's tough preaching
[2:00:08] i'm glad it's not me saying it
[2:00:11] that's tough preaching
[2:00:13] where you wouldn't even have a
[2:00:14] conversation over a difficulty with
[2:00:15] somebody if you couldn't go in first and
[2:00:17] say i love you
[2:00:19] but i'm saying i have to get that out of
[2:00:21] me before i can even go and have that
[2:00:22] conversation because i can't help him if
[2:00:24] i don't love them
[2:00:26] if i don't love them then my motive and
[2:00:27] objective is wrong regardless of if i'm
[2:00:29] absolutely correct on my doctrine on my
[2:00:32] position everything else if i can't love
[2:00:33] that person before i go in there i'll
[2:00:36] never help them
[2:00:39] what's he talking about he's talking
[2:00:40] about how to keep your spirit right even
[2:00:42] if you bitterly and completely disagree
[2:00:46] with another brother or sister
[2:00:48] wow
[2:00:51] romans 5
[2:00:52] therefore being justified by faith we
[2:00:55] have peace with god through our lord
[2:00:56] jesus christ
[2:00:58] by whom also we have access by faith
[2:01:00] unto this grace wherein we stand and
[2:01:02] rejoice in the hope of glory of god
[2:01:05] verse 5 says and hope maketh not ashamed
[2:01:08] because the love of god is shed abroad
[2:01:12] in our hearts by the holy spirit
[2:01:14] which is given to us that phrase shed
[2:01:16] abroad means it's poured out it's
[2:01:18] gushing it's spilling
[2:01:20] so the love of god is poured out it's
[2:01:22] gushing it's spilling in our hearts by
[2:01:24] the holy ghost which is given into us so
[2:01:26] if it's gushing into us it ought to be
[2:01:28] gushing out of us
[2:01:30] that's what he's saying is he's saying
[2:01:31] if it's given freely you've received
[2:01:32] freely give
[2:01:33] right if if you're saying i've got a
[2:01:35] gushing christian experience then we
[2:01:36] ought to be seeing it come out of our
[2:01:38] lives
[2:01:38] right
[2:01:39] it can't be filling you up and it not be
[2:01:41] overflowing eventually we ought to see
[2:01:43] the overflow eventually amen amen don't
[2:01:45] let what's he saying don't let the love
[2:01:47] of god just be for you amen let it be
[2:01:50] for everyone else that comes into
[2:01:51] contact with you because if it's shed
[2:01:53] abroad it's going to overflow because
[2:01:54] the love of god never just gives you a
[2:01:56] little bit it overflows you that it's
[2:01:58] got to conquer it's got to conquer you
[2:02:00] it's got to overflow it's not just
[2:02:01] pressing out right but it's gonna
[2:02:03] overflow if the blessings of god are
[2:02:04] pressed down shaking together and coming
[2:02:06] out then guess what the blessing of the
[2:02:08] holy spirit and your life ought to be
[2:02:09] doing the exact same thing right it's
[2:02:11] got to be flowing out of you it's
[2:02:12] something greater of you it's a
[2:02:13] wellspring of the very life of god that
[2:02:15] rises up to meet the challenges that you
[2:02:16] face brother batman put it this way he
[2:02:19] says if i have found grace in your sight
[2:02:20] through god you take my word for this
[2:02:22] brothers if you want to be a blessing
[2:02:24] and get a blessing when a man has done
[2:02:26] you wrong and he has absolutely done you
[2:02:29] wrong and you know he's done you wrong
[2:02:31] he's done you evil now catch the
[2:02:33] distinction here
[2:02:35] he's not just saying somebody's done you
[2:02:36] wrong he's saying somebody's done you
[2:02:38] evil what is evil evil is the absence of
[2:02:40] god he's saying somebody's really put
[2:02:42] one on you
[2:02:43] somebody's done something that has no
[2:02:45] place in the life of a christian to you
[2:02:48] he's not talking about somebody that's
[2:02:49] done it and then asked forgiveness or
[2:02:50] tried to make it right he's talking
[2:02:52] about somebody that has done something
[2:02:53] completely off the word to you
[2:02:55] and they don't recognize it and they're
[2:02:57] not doing anything about it
[2:02:59] listen to this
[2:03:00] he says don't mention that
[2:03:04] take him to prayer before god
[2:03:06] and oh
[2:03:08] don't take it in just a selfish way and
[2:03:10] say well i'm supposed to do this
[2:03:13] this is my christian duty
[2:03:15] to take brother chad before the lord in
[2:03:18] prayer
[2:03:19] because once again he forgot to mow my
[2:03:21] lawn
[2:03:23] whatever it is
[2:03:25] that's not evil brother
[2:03:26] chad what's he saying you don't say it's
[2:03:29] my christian duty now this is what a
[2:03:31] christian does so i'm going to do it
[2:03:34] ouch
[2:03:35] that's what he's saying don't be selfish
[2:03:37] it's selfish because what you're
[2:03:38] propping yourself up to say well this is
[2:03:40] what a christian does so i will do it
[2:03:44] everybody watch me as i do what a
[2:03:45] christian ought to do in this situation
[2:03:48] no no no no no no you need to repent
[2:03:52] that's our attitude we need to repent he
[2:03:54] says but stand with your shoulder to his
[2:03:57] shoulder
[2:03:58] and stand in the presence of god our
[2:04:00] father
[2:04:02] way a prayer should be made in the
[2:04:04] presence of god and say father here's my
[2:04:07] brother
[2:04:08] and he justly deserves punishment
[2:04:10] because he has done the evil and i don't
[2:04:13] see why he did it
[2:04:15] that's the most difficult prayer to
[2:04:16] praise when you don't even understand
[2:04:17] why they did it in the first place
[2:04:21] watch this remember he says stand in the
[2:04:23] presence of god the way a prayer should
[2:04:24] be made in this situation you've got to
[2:04:26] get into the presence of god this ain't
[2:04:27] a casual prayer
[2:04:29] this is in the prayer of five minutes
[2:04:31] this is going and laying before the
[2:04:34] presence of god until he comes down and
[2:04:36] does something and this is what he does
[2:04:38] he says then let god go to talking to
[2:04:41] you
[2:04:43] and you'll see maybe
[2:04:45] what that man's been through maybe he
[2:04:47] didn't say you would he said maybe he
[2:04:49] says god will show you what that man's
[2:04:50] been through the devil has twisted him
[2:04:52] up somewhere and caused him to do that
[2:04:53] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[2:04:56] leave the throne of god you'll be
[2:04:58] feeling sorry for that man you'll be
[2:05:00] sympathizing with that brother
[2:05:03] now listen to this he says and when you
[2:05:05] get back to earth again that's why i
[2:05:07] said this isn't a prayer five minutes
[2:05:08] this is a prayer that takes you
[2:05:10] somewhere and it's a prayer that takes
[2:05:11] you into the presence of god where he
[2:05:13] changes your complete approach and
[2:05:16] thoughts about this situation that's how
[2:05:18] you know you've been the presence says
[2:05:19] you've caught his mind now
[2:05:21] and not only with his mind but you've
[2:05:22] now caught what you need to do the way
[2:05:24] he would do it
[2:05:26] that's what we're looking for that's the
[2:05:27] kind of presence we're looking for is
[2:05:28] that it changes us and puts us now into
[2:05:30] his role instead of in our carnality
[2:05:35] he says and when you get back down to
[2:05:36] earth again you'll go over to that
[2:05:38] brother and shake his hand because you
[2:05:40] know what he's been through you can't
[2:05:42] stand with a mortal in the presence of
[2:05:44] god and condemn anybody i don't believe
[2:05:46] no sir even if he's a rank sinner
[2:05:48] i want to say this as we start to close
[2:05:53] we don't
[2:05:54] i i'll speak for myself
[2:05:57] there are moments in life where you know
[2:05:58] god is there
[2:06:00] it's it is very real it is
[2:06:02] it you know it
[2:06:04] and you can't barely move
[2:06:06] i can't at least
[2:06:07] you just sit there and you're still and
[2:06:10] that love and that presence of god
[2:06:11] washes over you
[2:06:14] and when you're in that situation i'll
[2:06:15] say for myself if you've had any issues
[2:06:18] with people
[2:06:19] in myself i'll say this
[2:06:20] when i'm in that presence all i'm
[2:06:22] thinking is forgiveness and restoration
[2:06:25] because i'm sitting there and i'm
[2:06:26] sitting in the sovereign holy presence
[2:06:28] of god and guess what that levels us all
[2:06:31] that levels us all right there's no good
[2:06:33] ones there's no big ones there's no
[2:06:35] great ones we're all dead flat wrong
[2:06:38] in that presence
[2:06:40] and it's only the blood of christ that
[2:06:41] allows you to sit there and enjoy it in
[2:06:43] the first place and so the same blood
[2:06:45] that covers my sins
[2:06:46] covers brother chad's sins
[2:06:49] amen when he doesn't mow my lawn
[2:06:52] right it's the same blood
[2:06:54] it's the same thing for him and i and so
[2:06:57] it doesn't matter does it
[2:06:59] so i'm sitting there and you went
[2:07:00] brother brandon's saying when you get in
[2:07:01] that presence he says you won't condemn
[2:07:05] you won't throw an accusation there's
[2:07:07] only one that can accuse in the presence
[2:07:09] of god not satan
[2:07:11] scripture says he's the accuser of the
[2:07:12] brethren
[2:07:13] in that presence you can't do anything
[2:07:15] but what look for restoration and
[2:07:17] forgiveness for that person he says
[2:07:18] you'll come out he says and you'll go to
[2:07:20] that brother you'll go that sister
[2:07:22] you'll put your arm around him and
[2:07:23] you'll say what i love you
[2:07:25] right shake his hand because you know
[2:07:27] what he's been through amen right
[2:07:31] what is it
[2:07:33] you know when you're in that presence
[2:07:34] that you can't do anything
[2:07:37] that would make you right that would
[2:07:39] make you good that would make you
[2:07:40] acceptable in the beloved it's all
[2:07:42] through christ
[2:07:44] and so all you're saying is lord let him
[2:07:46] let her get in the same presence that
[2:07:47] i'm in so they'll realize what they need
[2:07:49] to do and they need what they need to
[2:07:50] move into amen that's all we're trying
[2:07:53] to do what are we doing here we're
[2:07:54] creating an atmosphere aren't we
[2:07:56] when we're in a service we're creating
[2:07:57] an atmosphere for what people to be
[2:08:00] changed it's a hospital
[2:08:02] right and every one of us is still sick
[2:08:05] because we're in this body
[2:08:07] every one of us is sick so when we're
[2:08:09] coming in here we're looking for not
[2:08:12] just
[2:08:12] brother chad to get
[2:08:14] better right we're not just looking for
[2:08:16] brother gerald we're not just looking
[2:08:18] for sister lydia we're not just looking
[2:08:19] for brother kingsley but we're coming in
[2:08:20] we're saying lord as long as i'm in this
[2:08:22] body i'm sick
[2:08:24] and i need an overflowing i need a
[2:08:26] gushing of the presence of god in my
[2:08:27] life to wash those wounds out to take
[2:08:30] away the genetics to take away the
[2:08:31] traditions to take away the false
[2:08:33] religion all of these things to get it
[2:08:35] out of our lives and let your love take
[2:08:37] over amen
[2:08:38] first peter 4 says but the end of all
[2:08:40] things is at hand is the end of all
[2:08:42] things at hand
[2:08:44] we're at the end
[2:08:45] we're we're we're
[2:08:47] we're seconds to midnight on the on the
[2:08:49] the doomsday clock right it is so close
[2:08:52] it is so close
[2:08:54] it says but the end of all things is at
[2:08:56] hand be therefore sail sober and watch
[2:08:59] unto prayer
[2:09:01] and above all things have fervent
[2:09:03] charity among yourselves for charity
[2:09:05] shall cover the multitude of sins
[2:09:08] now this word fervent here is not what
[2:09:09] we normally think no for us fervent
[2:09:11] would typically be you know hot or
[2:09:13] boiling or zealous that's what we use
[2:09:15] and every other instance of the word in
[2:09:18] the scripture
[2:09:19] that says fervent refers to that hot
[2:09:21] boiling zealous
[2:09:23] this fervent charity is a completely
[2:09:25] different word and it's the only place
[2:09:26] that's used in the entire bible
[2:09:28] right
[2:09:30] because that fervency fervency tends to
[2:09:33] fizzle out the way we normally talk
[2:09:34] about it
[2:09:35] right it's only good for a while brother
[2:09:36] brahma i was listening to a tape the
[2:09:38] other day and he says you gotta you know
[2:09:39] he says you're pentecostals he says you
[2:09:41] blow it all out the chimney when you're
[2:09:42] in service and then you've got nothing
[2:09:43] left for the rest of the week he says
[2:09:45] you can't even put your shoulder to the
[2:09:46] wheel because you blew all your praise
[2:09:47] and all your energy and all your love
[2:09:49] out the pipe in the service he says and
[2:09:51] you walk out and you got nothing to give
[2:09:53] that's usually the fervency we're
[2:09:54] talking about hot boiling and then they
[2:09:56] walk out the next day and they just fall
[2:09:57] flat on their face because they have
[2:09:59] nothing left
[2:10:00] but this fervent charity this word
[2:10:02] fervent means
[2:10:03] this is this is amazing stretched
[2:10:06] strenuous
[2:10:08] continuous
[2:10:09] and earnest
[2:10:11] and when i was looking at it they say
[2:10:13] that the kind of the the phrase that
[2:10:15] covers all of this is that this is the
[2:10:17] maximum potential
[2:10:19] so if you take a an elastic band
[2:10:22] this is elastic band love where it's
[2:10:24] pulled tight
[2:10:26] and it's it's just quivering you ever
[2:10:28] pull an elastic band you ever see that
[2:10:30] maybe people have been around
[2:10:31] construction you get pulling on a cable
[2:10:33] so tight you get a cable to its maximum
[2:10:35] tightness and it'll just sit there and
[2:10:36] it'll vibrate it so tight
[2:10:39] that's the maximum love that we're
[2:10:40] talking about where that love is so
[2:10:42] tight where there's so much energy in it
[2:10:44] that it will vibrate
[2:10:46] that's the kind of thing we're talking
[2:10:48] about he says this is the kind of love
[2:10:49] that i'm supposed to have for you and
[2:10:51] you're supposed to have for me is that
[2:10:53] it's the maximum potential you give
[2:10:55] everything that you have inside of you
[2:10:57] to what meet the needs of the body to
[2:10:59] cover a multitude of sins that's a lot
[2:11:02] of sins
[2:11:03] it's not just the one-time sins it's the
[2:11:05] multitude of sins that's a that's a
[2:11:07] bundle as we would say
[2:11:08] that's the kind of love that that will
[2:11:10] cover a multitude of sins is one that's
[2:11:11] at its maximum potential it's giving
[2:11:14] every bit it's got every fiber is
[2:11:16] straining to let that love come out and
[2:11:18] do the work that it has to do in our
[2:11:20] lives and let's stand together if we
[2:11:21] would
[2:11:22] maximum potential love is what we're
[2:11:24] talking about
[2:11:26] amen
[2:11:27] why because it's got to be god's love
[2:11:28] and god's love is the only thing that'll
[2:11:30] conquer
[2:11:31] it's the only thing we'll conquer our
[2:11:32] human love will conquer guess what our
[2:11:34] marriages don't stay together because of
[2:11:35] human love
[2:11:37] right our marriages stay together
[2:11:38] because we have the god's love inside of
[2:11:40] us that's the only thing that'll do it
[2:11:42] right people will stay together in life
[2:11:43] but they won't love each other through
[2:11:44] life they'll stay together because they
[2:11:46] have nobody else better to go to they're
[2:11:47] too old or too poor whatever it is but
[2:11:49] we stay together wide because we've got
[2:11:51] god's love in us and it binds us
[2:11:52] together and it's no different with the
[2:11:54] body a man it's got the maximum
[2:11:56] potential it'll do what's required for
[2:11:58] the situation you can't overcome god's
[2:12:00] love it overcame us
[2:12:01] to overcome everything that the devil's
[2:12:03] thrown at us so there's nothing we
[2:12:04] should face amongst ourselves there's
[2:12:06] nothing we should face in our families
[2:12:07] nothing we should face in the church
[2:12:08] body that can't be overcome by looking
[2:12:10] at it through the lens of god's love
[2:12:12] amen that's the kind of love that's
[2:12:13] going to cover every fault every failure
[2:12:16] that comes over this pulpit that resides
[2:12:18] in the pews from the front to the back
[2:12:20] it'll cover
[2:12:21] everything that we do if we can submit
[2:12:23] ourselves to that and let it come out of
[2:12:24] our lives amen
[2:12:26] amen let's bow our heads this morning
[2:12:28] heavenly father
[2:12:32] lord not an easy one to preach this
[2:12:34] morning
[2:12:36] lord but we preach it because we've seen
[2:12:38] it from you
[2:12:39] amen lord and you gave us the great
[2:12:41] example
[2:12:42] lord that when we were unlovable lord
[2:12:44] when we wanted nothing to do with you
[2:12:46] yet you loved us heavenly father and
[2:12:48] lord if we've received your holy spirit
[2:12:50] lord or because we've received your holy
[2:12:52] spirit lord then the same potential lies
[2:12:54] within each and every one of us this
[2:12:56] morning and lord i pray that your holy
[2:12:58] spirit will minister in our lives this
[2:12:59] morning lord that it would cover a
[2:13:01] multitude of sins or that it would help
[2:13:03] us to look past the faults and failures
[2:13:05] lord that it would look to see the
[2:13:06] potential inside each and every one of
[2:13:08] us lord that it would draw us closer not
[2:13:10] push us apart lord that your love would
[2:13:13] just reign freely amongst us heavenly
[2:13:15] father lord as we've received lord
[2:13:17] freely from you lord may we freely give
[2:13:19] to each other we ask lord we're so
[2:13:21] thankful for your grace lord we're
[2:13:23] thankful for your goodness we're
[2:13:24] thankful for a word lord that can make
[2:13:26] us live the way we ought to live
[2:13:28] lord if we can only just surrender
[2:13:30] ourselves and humble ourselves to you
[2:13:32] lord minister grace to your people now
[2:13:34] we pray in jesus christ's name we ask
[2:13:36] him
