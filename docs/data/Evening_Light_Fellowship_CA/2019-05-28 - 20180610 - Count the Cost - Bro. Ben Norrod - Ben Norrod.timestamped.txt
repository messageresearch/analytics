[49:24] this morning but we're looking forward
[49:26] to what he's gonna do in central this
[49:27] coming weekend and trusting you all will
[49:30] be praying for those services that the
[49:32] Lord will help us find his mind as of
[49:34] yet standing right here and I've been
[49:36] trying to get ready for months and
[49:38] months and months I still to this moment
[49:39] I have no idea what the Lord's want me
[49:41] to speak out there but I'm just waiting
[49:43] on him because I know he'll give it to
[49:45] me in the hour that I need it and I'm
[49:47] just trust I don't want to just stick
[49:48] something in the microwave and reheat it
[49:50] and take it out there you know and I
[49:51] wanted to be fresh from the Lord when we
[49:53] go in there and I of course I handle all
[49:56] sermons that way but I don't like
[49:58] serving leftovers amen I like it to come
[50:00] fresh from the throne of God
[50:02] trust in the Lord just give us that type
[50:05] of Revelation that type of understanding
[50:07] what we need to say and I want to ask
[50:08] you to pray for us on the mission field
[50:10] coming we got Africa coming up very very
[50:13] quickly in just a few weeks time I'll be
[50:15] leaving on the 27th for a convention
[50:17] there in the Congo and we're gonna be
[50:20] there just just a weekend convention
[50:22] just a few days time but again the
[50:25] services go from 8:00 in the morning to
[50:26] whenever the Sun Goes Down and if they
[50:28] decide to stay a while they'll stay a
[50:29] while they men and and so they're gonna
[50:31] be long and strenuous and they're gonna
[50:34] be a lot involved and we trust you'll
[50:36] pray there and then in July we return to
[50:38] Trinidad and then Guyana and then before
[50:40] the years out we're trust in the Lord
[50:42] will send us to Mexico and we talked
[50:44] about that a little bit last year
[50:45] with you but when we went to go write
[50:48] about the time we went to go we got a
[50:49] report from some of the Brethren stay
[50:51] out right now the political climate is
[50:53] not right and gang warfare and drugs and
[50:55] all kinds of stuff was happening and
[50:57] they said it's not safe don't come in
[50:59] just right now so we've been waiting
[51:00] about a year now I guess to get back
[51:02] into Mexico and looks like it's gonna
[51:04] work out maybe around September if the
[51:06] Lord will help us we're going to try to
[51:08] get there for a weekend meeting and
[51:10] maybe five or six days meeting something
[51:13] like that and then maybe once before we
[51:17] finish the year out we're trusting to go
[51:19] to West Africa again before the years
[51:21] out and then I don't know but we've got
[51:24] some other things on the agenda coming
[51:27] up in the beginning of the year some
[51:29] brethren are calling to come back into
[51:30] Europe again probably around the 1st of
[51:32] the year so I'm not exactly certain how
[51:34] all that's going to work out but I like
[51:36] to tell the body who likes to pray I
[51:38] like to tell them about it so you can
[51:40] help us pray and last time I went to
[51:43] Europe they made fun of me and they said
[51:45] yeah going to France yeah what a mission
[51:47] trip well you see what happened just
[51:48] after we left out there with all that
[51:50] with all that Charlie Hebdo or whatever
[51:52] his name was and all that terrorists and
[51:54] all that stuff so I told people these
[51:56] things aren't vacation time they're
[51:58] ministry of the Lord and the devil is
[51:59] right there on the field trying to
[52:01] attack it every way you can so be sure
[52:03] to pray and ask the Lord to help us and
[52:06] so we love you god bless you and we've
[52:08] enjoyed the last two services and the
[52:11] Capstone's are coming hey man we're
[52:13] looking for the Lord to come bring us a

[1:04:17] let's stand together this morning I'll
[1:04:22] praise the Lord Amen I'm so glad that he
[1:04:26] that he carried us amen Alleluia one
[1:04:31] thing's for sure we could have never
[1:04:33] carried ourselves that's for sure it
[1:04:35] took him to carry us amen I want to
[1:04:38] speak to you this morning upon those
[1:04:40] little words that we sang in that song
[1:04:42] counting the cost counting the cost Luke
[1:04:46] chapter 14 verse 28 I want to start
[1:04:49] there on verse 28 29 and 30
[1:04:52] then the Lord helping us I want to try
[1:04:54] to drop down a few little scriptures
[1:04:57] here and just just a short moment but
[1:05:00] I've got a lot of Mon try to get through
[1:05:02] this morning the Lord helping us and I'm
[1:05:05] in a hurry now I'm just gonna take my
[1:05:07] time and preach and one of the brothers
[1:05:09] said to me they said we gonna wring you
[1:05:12] out I said well there's a lot to wring
[1:05:14] there's a lot to wring but we're looking
[1:05:17] forward to what the Lord will speak to
[1:05:18] us now alright you're reading with me
[1:05:20] Luke 14 verse 28 for which of you
[1:05:23] intending to build a tower setteth not
[1:05:27] down first and counted the cost whether
[1:05:30] he has sufficient to finish him lest
[1:05:33] happily after he hath laid the
[1:05:36] foundation and is not able to finish it
[1:05:38] all that behold it began to mock him
[1:05:41] saying this man began to build and was
[1:05:44] not able to finish him better to start
[1:05:48] something and finish rather than to
[1:05:50] start it and not be able to complete him
[1:05:52] now the word that he uses here for
[1:05:55] counting it means in the Greek word of
[1:05:58] the way that they defined this type of
[1:06:01] counting they would count with pebbles
[1:06:03] count with pebbles pebbles to compute
[1:06:07] calculate to reckon to give one's vote
[1:06:11] by casting a pebble into an urn or
[1:06:15] decide by voting so many times when they
[1:06:17] would count they would take like a
[1:06:18] little like a steel urn like this and
[1:06:21] they would put pebbles into it and a lot
[1:06:23] of
[1:06:23] they would keep count by just counting
[1:06:25] the stones so if they want to know for
[1:06:27] example how many certain things they've
[1:06:29] done they just look in there and they
[1:06:31] could count what it was that they done
[1:06:32] we use calculators and all these
[1:06:34] different types of methods today but
[1:06:36] this is one of the methods that they use
[1:06:38] so Jesus here saying that if a man would
[1:06:41] build a tower he would actually look as
[1:06:44] it was into this urn to see if he had
[1:06:47] the ability to finish what it was that
[1:06:50] he began we call it taking inventory of
[1:06:53] ourselves it's what we call it but now
[1:06:55] notice the word that he uses here is to
[1:06:57] count by casting pebbles now I want to
[1:07:00] reach ya the message God had explained
[1:07:02] brother Brent says here on page 12 you
[1:07:04] must test your motive and objective
[1:07:06] first first find the will of God and
[1:07:10] that's exactly what all of us are
[1:07:13] searching for in our lives everyday
[1:07:14] we're looking for the will of God it
[1:07:16] isn't something that just happens once I
[1:07:18] told somebody here not long ago finding
[1:07:21] the will of God is an everyday task for
[1:07:23] us as the people of God and God expects
[1:07:26] us to find that will too and he said
[1:07:28] then find your objective your objective
[1:07:31] and then test your motive test your
[1:07:34] motive to see if your motive is right
[1:07:38] Amen that's right let's let's pray over
[1:07:40] the word this morning while your heads
[1:07:43] are bowed I just wonder how many in here
[1:07:45] would have a special need on your heart
[1:07:46] you'd like to be remembered just by the
[1:07:48] lifting of your hand my hands up as well
[1:07:51] Lord Jesus we love you this morning
[1:07:53] Father we are so happy to know that you
[1:07:58] by your grace and your mercy has made
[1:08:00] provisions for us as the people of God
[1:08:03] Lord there's so many things that is your
[1:08:05] bride we could stand here and just
[1:08:07] rejoice and glory over as it was
[1:08:09] appropriately said yesterday time would
[1:08:11] fail us of the testimonies that we have
[1:08:14] of what you've done for us in our lives
[1:08:16] and Lord Jesus we stand here once again
[1:08:18] coming now to the
[1:08:21] capstone to the benediction to the
[1:08:23] closing of these weekend meetings in
[1:08:26] Lord Jesus with a few hours that remain
[1:08:28] us in this weekend time we're asking
[1:08:30] that you will come orden up those hours
[1:08:33] with your presence and with revelation
[1:08:35] of your spirit and may your Holy Spirit
[1:08:37] come this morning
[1:08:39] pray and take me into your hands as clay
[1:08:41] Lord I might be molded to saying act and
[1:08:45] behave in the way that be most pleased
[1:08:47] with that be a blessing to your children
[1:08:49] Lord if maybe I would go this way in my
[1:08:52] thoughts but Lord you want me to go in
[1:08:54] opposite direction I yield myself to you
[1:08:56] Lord to do whatever it is you want to do
[1:08:57] this morning and lord I pray for your
[1:08:59] children out there today Lord that are
[1:09:01] setting their needs and their heart god
[1:09:03] or they're looking for your spirit to
[1:09:05] come and do great things for each thing
[1:09:07] that the Holy Ghost will not let a one
[1:09:10] leave here unsatisfied
[1:09:12] Oh God but every uplifted hand every
[1:09:15] heart every representative Lord will
[1:09:17] leave out of here full with the Spirit
[1:09:18] of God just overflowing from their cup
[1:09:21] into their saucer Oh God that Lord that
[1:09:23] others might want to drink of the glory
[1:09:25] of the Living God living out of their
[1:09:27] lives we commit ourself to you this
[1:09:29] morning father we're asking that your
[1:09:31] Holy Spirit come and take the further
[1:09:33] part of this service Lord in Jesus
[1:09:35] Christ's name Amen god bless you may be
[1:09:39] seated
[1:09:44] one thing I believe that we're noticing
[1:09:47] in the message as we call it or in the
[1:09:50] ranks of the message is that as we go on
[1:09:54] in time people for the most part start
[1:09:57] out very well they go pretty good for a
[1:10:00] while and they seem to be in it for a
[1:10:02] while but then after a period of time
[1:10:04] something happens and they start
[1:10:07] trailing off we call it backsliding and
[1:10:09] get colder sometimes they get more
[1:10:12] distance they get more removed from the
[1:10:15] house of God they get in a place where
[1:10:17] they're discouraged and they don't
[1:10:18] really know how to bring themselves to
[1:10:21] the place of feeling the enthusiasm the
[1:10:24] joy the Lord like they used to and we
[1:10:26] realize that those things are a natural
[1:10:29] part of Christianity the falling back
[1:10:32] the backsliding the getting cold
[1:10:34] that's a natural part of Christianity
[1:10:36] now it's not something that we should
[1:10:38] accept as status quo it's not something
[1:10:40] we should accept as the ultimate of our
[1:10:43] lives but it is a evident fact that if
[1:10:46] you are a human being with the Holy
[1:10:47] Ghost at some point in your life you're
[1:10:49] going to get discouraged you're going to
[1:10:51] get depressed you're going to get upset
[1:10:52] you're gonna feel like things aren't
[1:10:54] working in your order and actually
[1:10:56] friends suffering is built-in to the
[1:10:59] Christian life for example you take a
[1:11:01] computer when you buy a computer it
[1:11:03] might have a certain type of program
[1:11:05] programmed into it maybe a Windows
[1:11:07] program or something from Microsoft or
[1:11:10] an Apple type setup all of that is
[1:11:13] pre-programmed into that computer so
[1:11:15] when you hit the power button and the
[1:11:17] things fires up and you see the Apple
[1:11:19] signal or the Windows or HP or whatever
[1:11:21] it is there would be all of that that
[1:11:23] was placed in and woodall way to be to
[1:11:25] be there and ready at your disposal and
[1:11:28] the same thing in a Christian life
[1:11:30] suffering is built-in to our Christian
[1:11:33] life it is built-in to our experience
[1:11:35] with God and when God as it was push the
[1:11:38] button all of this was a part of our
[1:11:40] walk with God and they asked for the
[1:11:41] brennaman questions and answers about
[1:11:43] these type of things and you know
[1:11:44] brother branham is that normal is it
[1:11:46] something we're supposed to be going
[1:11:47] through and you hear the prophets say
[1:11:48] over and over again yes of course it is
[1:11:50] he said it's as though the devil has a
[1:11:53] bull's-eye and he's aiming right at you
[1:11:55] and every gun in Haley said training on
[1:11:58] you when you received the Holy Ghost so
[1:12:00] we know that it is a natural part of the
[1:12:02] order of God for us to be in a fight
[1:12:04] because you realize that when Peter
[1:12:06] picks it up with these virtues behind us
[1:12:09] here and he takes this about the
[1:12:11] character and the nature of God in the
[1:12:13] heart of the bride you realize that the
[1:12:15] character of an individual is developed
[1:12:17] by suffering it is not developed by
[1:12:20] their study or their memory of the word
[1:12:22] that is your soul feeding on the word of
[1:12:25] course but your character is developed
[1:12:28] in the things that you suffer now in
[1:12:31] when I was preaching last night speaking
[1:12:33] about the Lord being a healer to us and
[1:12:35] a deliverer to us and many of these
[1:12:37] types of things that we seek after we
[1:12:39] expect God sometimes to take us out of
[1:12:41] these circumstances but the truth of the
[1:12:43] matter is is that many times the Holy
[1:12:45] Spirit will put you in a situation he
[1:12:48] will
[1:12:48] place you in a circumstance that many
[1:12:51] times seems impossible and it is for
[1:12:53] your good and for your benefit
[1:12:55] ultimately that he sticks you in such a
[1:12:58] condition and many times we pray old God
[1:13:00] take me out of it take me out of it take
[1:13:02] me out of it but yet if we knew from
[1:13:04] eternity scope what that battle or that
[1:13:08] circumstance or that trial would do for
[1:13:10] your Christian character we would say
[1:13:13] God double it up make it triple make it
[1:13:15] more than what it is if we could see it
[1:13:17] from eternity view but yet all of these
[1:13:20] things that we suffer we must realize is
[1:13:22] a normal part of a Christian experience
[1:13:25] now we know what Peter said about how
[1:13:27] that when a man a woman suffers and they
[1:13:29] go through hard things he tells the
[1:13:31] people of God in that first century
[1:13:32] think it not strange that you go through
[1:13:36] fiery trials in other words he's telling
[1:13:38] them the same thing I'm telling you this
[1:13:39] morning that being a Christian has all
[1:13:42] of this accompanied with it don't ever
[1:13:44] think that you're going to escape trials
[1:13:46] and tribulations and suffering in this
[1:13:48] life it is through those adversaries and
[1:13:52] adversities of life that we are
[1:13:54] developed into the man and woman that we
[1:13:56] are today and thank God for we don't
[1:13:58] like going through it when we're going
[1:14:00] through it but I sure like what I see
[1:14:02] out of my life after I go through hard
[1:14:03] things hey man don't you now we look at
[1:14:07] the way the prophet of God said this
[1:14:09] about our motive and our objective now
[1:14:11] in tying a lot of these type of thoughts
[1:14:13] together about a Christian character and
[1:14:16] about trials and tribulations you know a
[1:14:18] lot of what we go through comes down to
[1:14:21] a couple elements and one of those
[1:14:22] elements is is it a trial sin from God
[1:14:25] or is it something that you put yourself
[1:14:27] through you know there's a lot of things
[1:14:29] we bring upon ourself because we just
[1:14:31] make silly decisions and we don't do the
[1:14:33] thing we ought to do but then there are
[1:14:35] trials that come from God that are
[1:14:37] predestinated trials that God has sent
[1:14:41] to the person's life and I want to read
[1:14:43] to you now out of a message called
[1:14:45] anointing once at the end time and I
[1:14:46] want you to listen the way brother
[1:14:47] Branham answers you remember the story
[1:14:49] how that when lavell was sending there
[1:14:51] with him in the restaurant and he was
[1:14:53] talking about a certain man saying
[1:14:54] certain things to him and he begins
[1:14:56] speaking about how that habit you know
[1:14:58] that was me brother branham
[1:15:00] I wouldn't put up with that I'd handle
[1:15:02] it this way he said he's a little bit
[1:15:03] too quick on the trigger but then
[1:15:05] brother Bram says it this way he said
[1:15:06] I'm wondering brother Lee said to him
[1:15:08] how can you take it like that that
[1:15:10] involves your family I said all mine
[1:15:13] brother Lee that was a predestinated
[1:15:15] trial before the foundation of the world
[1:15:18] so you see a lot of these aspects of our
[1:15:21] walk of our journey as we spoke about
[1:15:24] last night being on this narrow way it
[1:15:26] is a rugged way it is a difficult way
[1:15:29] and brother lives that were sitting here
[1:15:30] this morning knowing that every footstep
[1:15:33] we take has been ordered by Almighty God
[1:15:35] you remember one of the messages I
[1:15:38] brought to you here when I first came to
[1:15:39] Newfoundland about the direction of our
[1:15:42] life and how David said that every
[1:15:44] footstep even our rises and our Falls
[1:15:47] are ordained of God the fall in the
[1:15:49] Garden of Eden for example last night as
[1:15:51] we looked at Eve coming in to a
[1:15:53] predestinated place where she was going
[1:15:55] to fall there was no way that Eve could
[1:15:58] escape that program
[1:15:59] it was the predestinated program for her
[1:16:02] life to listen to the devil's reasoning
[1:16:05] to fall to Satan's wisdom and to bring
[1:16:08] sin into this world God ordained it to
[1:16:11] be just that way now I know how people
[1:16:13] think sometimes in their minds they have
[1:16:15] a tendency thing well glory to God this
[1:16:17] man committed adultery that was a
[1:16:19] predestinated thing from the hand of God
[1:16:21] many times friends those are things that
[1:16:24] the Bible said we are drawn away by our
[1:16:26] own lust and that's what creates a lot
[1:16:28] of these situations but when it is a
[1:16:31] trial predestinated by god it is
[1:16:34] ordained to bring character out of your
[1:16:37] hearts all hallelujah amen it is
[1:16:40] ordained to bring things out of our
[1:16:42] hearts now watch this in Psalm 34 verse
[1:16:45] 17 watch David said the righteous cry
[1:16:48] and the Lord heareth and deliver them
[1:16:51] out of all of their troubles the Lord is
[1:16:54] nigh unto them that are of a broken
[1:16:56] heart and save as such as be of a
[1:16:59] contrite spirit and many are the
[1:17:01] afflictions of the righteous on the
[1:17:05] church said a man but the Lord
[1:17:07] delivereth them
[1:17:08] out of him out of them all a man now you
[1:17:11] notice here that all of these things
[1:17:14] that David speaks of he never once says
[1:17:16] that God is going to take trouble away
[1:17:18] from us that is going to take
[1:17:20] afflictions away from us that you'll
[1:17:22] never have issues you'll never have
[1:17:24] problems and many times we try to create
[1:17:26] this imagery of Christianity and the
[1:17:28] message that if a man or woman is
[1:17:30] serving God and living for God oh
[1:17:32] they'll be wealthy and everybody will
[1:17:34] like them and all their family will get
[1:17:36] saved and you'll be walking through
[1:17:37] Walmart and people will be repenting
[1:17:39] because of the glory of God coming out
[1:17:41] of your soul then when we get saved we
[1:17:43] find out people hate us we're broke as a
[1:17:45] Amen broke as we can be poor as a church
[1:17:48] house mouse our family don't want to
[1:17:50] speak to us no more and instead of
[1:17:52] repenting people are cussing at you well
[1:17:54] hallelujah somebody it's exactly the
[1:17:57] opposite of what we try to paint it up
[1:17:59] to be because we realize we are in a
[1:18:02] warfare did you know that this is not a
[1:18:05] picnic we're not here to eat cookies and
[1:18:07] so forth this is a battleground hey man
[1:18:10] look at Paul in Ephesians chapter 6
[1:18:13] whenever he begins to take the soldier
[1:18:15] and dress him up he takes his sword puts
[1:18:18] it in his hand puts a helmet on his head
[1:18:19] put shoes on his feet
[1:18:21] puts breastplate Gerdes his loins gives
[1:18:23] him everything he needs
[1:18:25] to fight as a Christian soldier but then
[1:18:28] Peter is going to turn right around and
[1:18:30] now he's gonna put character in that
[1:18:33] soldier because you realize if you got a
[1:18:36] sword in your hand but you don't have no
[1:18:37] character you'll cut the wrong head off
[1:18:39] if you got a shield on your arm you'll
[1:18:42] use it in the wrong way if you don't
[1:18:44] have Christian character to accompany
[1:18:46] these things of God so as Jesus said in
[1:18:49] the opening text then we as the people
[1:18:52] of God must take inventory them as they
[1:18:55] would take a stone and they would drop
[1:18:56] it in okay we've got this we've got that
[1:18:59] we've got the materials we got the nails
[1:19:01] we got the wood we can build this tower
[1:19:03] as a Christian would take inventory so
[1:19:06] are we to take inventory of who we are
[1:19:09] and where we are in the economy of God
[1:19:12] we must look at where we're at because
[1:19:14] friends I find many times that there is
[1:19:16] a balance between blessed are they that
[1:19:18] are hungry and thirsty and a
[1:19:21] balance between such as that and then
[1:19:23] also being content in the state where
[1:19:25] with God has called you many times a man
[1:19:28] a woman gets saved or you sort of
[1:19:30] serving the Lord and within a month they
[1:19:32] want to be a manifested son of God
[1:19:33] the fact of the matter is it takes years
[1:19:36] it takes years to develop a proper
[1:19:39] Christian character in the hearts of the
[1:19:41] people of God and we cry of course to
[1:19:43] the Lord O God O God do things in me
[1:19:46] change things in me O God make me
[1:19:48] different and what we're really saying
[1:19:49] by that is that we want the Lord in an
[1:19:52] overnight get rich quick type scheme to
[1:19:55] be able to change us in a moment's time
[1:19:57] well let me tell you it took six
[1:19:59] thousand years to get us in the mess
[1:20:01] we're in and we ain't going to get out
[1:20:03] of it in six minutes come on somebody
[1:20:05] we're going to have to struggle we're
[1:20:07] going to have to fight come on now we're
[1:20:09] going to have to wrestle until that
[1:20:11] Christian character is developed in our
[1:20:14] life and it's important for you and I to
[1:20:16] have the patience and to have a
[1:20:18] longevity and to have a long-term vision
[1:20:21] of where we are going in the kingdom of
[1:20:24] God this is why Jesus told us count the
[1:20:26] cost count the cost remember that if
[1:20:29] you're going to be all-in as the world
[1:20:31] says and you're gonna do commit and
[1:20:33] dedicate yourself 100% to God that this
[1:20:37] is a long haul thing that this is not
[1:20:39] I'm going to serve God today and be in
[1:20:40] the rapture tomorrow no you're going to
[1:20:42] go through probably years of tribulation
[1:20:44] you're going to have years of ups years
[1:20:46] of down years of this years of that and
[1:20:49] God is going to develop your character
[1:20:52] that's what the Bible said right here
[1:20:53] every trouble he lets you go through
[1:20:55] every affliction he lets you suffer he
[1:20:58] will deliver you out of it all
[1:21:00] hallelujah but we've got to endure it in
[1:21:03] order to finish this building of God
[1:21:06] it's hard for some people to accept what
[1:21:08] I'm preaching this morning because they
[1:21:10] just don't want to work I have found
[1:21:13] that Christians on the average and I
[1:21:15] don't mean this naturally I mean it's
[1:21:16] spiritually they can be some of the
[1:21:17] laziest people you've ever seen in your
[1:21:19] life you know we've got an age where you
[1:21:21] can push a button and find 500
[1:21:23] statements on the rapture it's easy for
[1:21:26] us to live a Christian life according to
[1:21:28] the technological mindset of things it's
[1:21:30] easy for us to sit people talk about not
[1:21:33] coming to church I've
[1:21:34] always wondered what in the world is so
[1:21:36] difficult about coming to church you sit
[1:21:38] in a Pew for two hours and do nothing I
[1:21:40] mean it ain't like I'm asking you to
[1:21:42] swing sledgehammers this morning you're
[1:21:43] sitting there listening you're not
[1:21:45] exerting most of you ain't even sweat
[1:21:46] and except for charity amen praise the
[1:21:50] Lord somebody a man and me too brother
[1:21:52] Chad that's why I got this handkerchief
[1:21:55] towel up here you don't have some Matt
[1:21:56] amen some of us do a little work some of
[1:21:59] us just come and hang out amen we're
[1:22:00] here a part of the a part of the gang a
[1:22:02] part of the service oh but I can't go to
[1:22:04] church I'm too tired they're gonna sit
[1:22:06] in the Barcalounger why not set in the
[1:22:08] pew it'll do you some good
[1:22:09] hey man that's exactly right but it's
[1:22:11] the devil you see what Satan does he
[1:22:13] puts it in the minds of the people oh
[1:22:15] it's just too much for me I've never
[1:22:17] understood how that somebody can sit
[1:22:19] down and watch a video for two and a
[1:22:21] half hours but can't read one chapter
[1:22:22] out of their Bible of a morning and one
[1:22:25] chapter of a night oh it's so difficult
[1:22:26] it's so hard no it's the devil's trying
[1:22:29] to keep you from the blessings of God
[1:22:31] that lay out yonder that's what it is
[1:22:34] amen so many are the afflictions of the
[1:22:36] righteous watch this in a message called
[1:22:38] my commission the Prophet talks about
[1:22:40] this woman a discernment here he said I
[1:22:42] see that you've never been satisfied
[1:22:44] with yourself in the way that you tried
[1:22:47] to serve God now many of us can identify
[1:22:49] with that remark I'm sure because all of
[1:22:52] us we look at our lives and we say man I
[1:22:54] just think where I need to be man I've
[1:22:56] never been satisfied with where I'm at
[1:22:58] watch the Prophet said you've always
[1:23:00] wanted a deeper walk with God now watch
[1:23:04] these next words he said because I see a
[1:23:07] shadow following your path a shadow
[1:23:11] following your path so there's always
[1:23:14] this type of mindset for a Christian
[1:23:17] especially with a Christian who has a
[1:23:18] heart that really wants to serve the
[1:23:20] Lord you always feel like that you're
[1:23:22] always short of where you need to be and
[1:23:24] you're always failing and falling and
[1:23:26] coming you know short of the glory of
[1:23:28] God and what more and you always feel
[1:23:30] like oh I'll never achieve but yet when
[1:23:33] you look at it through a turn of this
[1:23:34] view you are exactly right now in the
[1:23:38] place where God wants you this very
[1:23:40] moment
[1:23:41] even though you feel like you're not
[1:23:43] there yet you're exactly where God wants
[1:23:45] you oh you said that's crazy no it's not
[1:23:48] if you don't want to hire here to put
[1:23:49] you hi-c friends the problem is and I
[1:23:54] I'm just gonna say this this may pinch a
[1:23:56] little bit it's true the problem is is
[1:23:58] that often we want to control our own
[1:24:00] walk with God we cannot control our walk
[1:24:03] with God like you control that
[1:24:05] thermostat back there I got one of them
[1:24:08] little dials in that room Carson's got
[1:24:09] me in I reach over it's too cold I just
[1:24:11] cranked it that way too hot I cranked it
[1:24:13] that way we want to handle Christianity
[1:24:15] that way oh I want to be more of God so
[1:24:17] I just crank my little dial and I'll be
[1:24:19] more of God I'll read more I'll pray
[1:24:20] more how fast more our study more but
[1:24:23] that's not how you get character
[1:24:24] character comes with suffering God is
[1:24:27] the one that controls those elements
[1:24:28] he's the one that's got your thermostat
[1:24:31] in his hand
[1:24:31] Oh God y'all get any quieter I'm just
[1:24:34] about to preach to myself this morning
[1:24:36] huh hey man that's right
[1:24:38] but we think to our cept klore to God
[1:24:40] I'm a message believer yes but why are
[1:24:43] you a message believer because God saw
[1:24:44] in your life that he had character
[1:24:46] inside of you he had something inside of
[1:24:49] you that he could work with himself
[1:24:50] remember we are the clay he is the
[1:24:52] Potter not the other way around
[1:24:55] but here this woman this shadow
[1:24:57] following her life and why was it
[1:24:58] following her life because the devil was
[1:25:01] haunting this woman all you need to be
[1:25:03] more you need to be this you need to be
[1:25:05] that so what they do to walk around most
[1:25:07] of the time in a miserable condition oh
[1:25:09] I'm never the Christian I need to be oh
[1:25:11] I'm just not now listen there's a
[1:25:12] difference my friends in hungry for God
[1:25:15] to do something in you and then there's
[1:25:16] a difference between that and that's
[1:25:18] just whining and complaining we ain't
[1:25:20] what we want to be oh god it's gonna be
[1:25:24] hard this morning
[1:25:26] whoo help me Jesus help me Lord
[1:25:30] oh we digging taters this morning a man
[1:25:32] I'm already digging deep hey hey man
[1:25:35] that's right amen now sometimes you have
[1:25:37] to understand that when the Holy Spirit
[1:25:39] moves on you and says you ain't livin
[1:25:41] where you need to live there's something
[1:25:43] in you says god that's right I want to
[1:25:44] be better but you also realized that the
[1:25:47] devil likes to hold things over your
[1:25:48] head he's slick friends and he can make
[1:25:52] you feel like because you ain't where
[1:25:54] you need to be and make you feel like
[1:25:56] because you ain't in some certain spot
[1:25:58] but listen God is the one that grows you
[1:26:03] remember Paul watered
[1:26:05] Apollo's planted but it was God that
[1:26:07] gave the increase
[1:26:08] you cannot increase yourself you can't
[1:26:11] make yourself greater well hallelujah I
[1:26:13] I need to get some virtue and I need to
[1:26:15] get some knowledge in my life so I'm
[1:26:17] gonna read four more books imma listen
[1:26:19] to six more tapes well that's good
[1:26:21] fertilizer that's good vitamins and
[1:26:23] nutrients that's good water the Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit to put on there but you go bring
[1:26:27] the increase God someone brings the
[1:26:28] increase in friends I wonder if we just
[1:26:32] press ourself too deeply into things
[1:26:34] trying to move beyond the predestinated
[1:26:37] part that God's got us playing right now
[1:26:39] Oh preach brother been a man exactly
[1:26:44] right and remember let me just say it in
[1:26:46] a very simplified way if you're on faith
[1:26:48] you're gonna you're not gonna be on
[1:26:49] brotherly kindness tomorrow not unless
[1:26:51] God want you to be listen you know the
[1:26:54] only thing that grows fast don't you a
[1:26:55] weed a real plant grows slow because it
[1:27:01] takes time to develop everything that it
[1:27:03] needs hallelujah to become what it needs
[1:27:06] to become a weed is what grows up
[1:27:09] overnight and then you go out and weed
[1:27:11] your garden today I hate the garden I
[1:27:13] hate it I love doing the garden part I
[1:27:15] hate weeds I've got to pull the crazy
[1:27:18] things before midnight you got a whole
[1:27:20] host of them more I hate weeds in a
[1:27:22] church
[1:27:24] amen you spend all your time pulling
[1:27:26] weeds and you know what you don't have
[1:27:27] no time to deal with the real plants in
[1:27:29] the church oh god I should have said
[1:27:32] that but it's the truth anyhow hey man
[1:27:34] that's right you got all you got a real
[1:27:36] plant set in there and if you ain't
[1:27:38] careful you'll spend all your time
[1:27:39] pulling weeds up oh they they they got
[1:27:42] all kinds of potential to move and and
[1:27:44] they're movers and shakers as the world
[1:27:46] says but a real plant it takes time to
[1:27:50] invest in it the qualities that need to
[1:27:52] become what it needs to become and if
[1:27:55] you want to be a real Christian it ain't
[1:27:56] gonna come overnight and it shouldn't
[1:27:59] come overnight if it's done right it
[1:28:00] should take time it should take time to
[1:28:03] become where we need to come to and I
[1:28:05] wonder sometimes that the devil just
[1:28:07] doesn't torment us to a place to
[1:28:09] thinking oh you should be so much
[1:28:11] further you see things have come along
[1:28:12] and you'll get upset and you'll lose
[1:28:14] your temper next thing you know you've
[1:28:16] done unchristian eyes yourself well you
[1:28:19] have no control over any of that God
[1:28:22] gave you the Holy Ghost didn't it did
[1:28:25] you give it to yourself oh god you done
[1:28:28] forgot even how say a man doesn't wanna
[1:28:30] come on
[1:28:32] you didn't give yourself the Holy Ghost
[1:28:34] did you anybody hear birth himself into
[1:28:37] the kingdom of God anybody I'm gonna put
[1:28:39] my hand up because it took grace to get
[1:28:42] me where I am to grace to get you where
[1:28:45] you are well if I've got so many
[1:28:47] qualities in my life and I'm I'm
[1:28:48] ordained to be a certain type of way and
[1:28:51] God made me with a certain type of
[1:28:53] makeup then all I can do is take the
[1:28:55] word into my soul feed on that word of
[1:28:58] God and trust God the increase will come
[1:29:01] friends if I see that I still got a
[1:29:03] short temper the Prophet said sweeten it
[1:29:05] with prayer but until he gives me
[1:29:07] increase till I can raise to a level to
[1:29:10] overcome it I don't need me walking
[1:29:11] around going oh I'm in fighting temper
[1:29:14] I've been having problems I've been I've
[1:29:16] been that yes you may realize and
[1:29:18] recognize that all of these things are
[1:29:20] evident in your life but it takes God to
[1:29:23] give you the ability to overcome that
[1:29:25] thing
[1:29:26] hey man you can't make yourself grow and
[1:29:30] sometimes we say Oh God take his temper
[1:29:33] away
[1:29:33] maybe God's letting you wrestle with it
[1:29:35] for a while for a purpose oh hey man
[1:29:40] maybe that strain that God put in your
[1:29:43] life maybe it's there for a reason maybe
[1:29:45] God like Paul would say to you three
[1:29:48] times Lord I asked you to take his thing
[1:29:50] away even if we could hear God say to
[1:29:51] Paul Paul I'm the one in charge not you
[1:29:54] just to just be quiet and let me handle
[1:29:55] the business
[1:29:59] you know how doesn't reel away we look
[1:30:01] at one another we wish one another would
[1:30:02] be better you can't wish on that what
[1:30:04] Jesus say you can't even add to your
[1:30:06] stature by taking thought you can't add
[1:30:09] to one another oh I wish they'd do this
[1:30:10] I wish they'd do that
[1:30:11] sure pray for them and say God if
[1:30:14] they're in a certain condition they are
[1:30:16] there because there is a reason you put
[1:30:18] him there amen it's like I sat down here
[1:30:21] at the piano last night we had prayer
[1:30:23] and was praying and I sat down at the
[1:30:25] piano and Samantha accidentally left her
[1:30:27] book up there and and I pulled the cover
[1:30:29] over and on the front of that cover it
[1:30:31] said God makes all things beautiful in
[1:30:33] his time and I thought that's exactly
[1:30:36] right you see things going on in
[1:30:38] people's lives you see situations coming
[1:30:40] up in a certain way and you see things
[1:30:42] arise and you say to yourself oh god I
[1:30:44] wish it wasn't that way but if you could
[1:30:46] look at it through eternity as view
[1:30:48] there's a reason that person or that
[1:30:50] church or that individual is in the
[1:30:52] situation that they're in God is doing
[1:30:55] it for a purpose because God knows what
[1:30:58] kind of character he needs to get out of
[1:31:00] his people don't know that we can do is
[1:31:03] trust him and I don't mean we don't quit
[1:31:05] read and pray and studying and fighting
[1:31:06] and battling and pressing and being
[1:31:08] present like the woman of the unjust
[1:31:10] judged I don't mean we don't quit coming
[1:31:12] and we stop all of a sudden I'm not
[1:31:14] going to fight no more no that didn't
[1:31:16] they don't mean that but it means don't
[1:31:17] walk around with a cloud over you all
[1:31:19] the time
[1:31:20] and the shadow you over you all the time
[1:31:22] oh I wish I was a better Christian you
[1:31:24] know I'm convinced that some people
[1:31:26] absolutely love being miserable
[1:31:29] and if they can walk around tell
[1:31:31] everybody what a bad Christian they feel
[1:31:33] like they are I think they they feel
[1:31:34] like they get glory out of that somehow
[1:31:35] if people feel sorry for him pay
[1:31:38] attention to him or something like that
[1:31:39] well glory to God anyhow amen but it's a
[1:31:43] Christian I shouldn't be walking around
[1:31:44] and saying oh I should be much more we
[1:31:47] should I had the attitude that little
[1:31:48] black woman habit been talked about she
[1:31:50] said I ain't what I ought to be she said
[1:31:52] but I ain't what I used to be either
[1:31:54] hey man but I'm marching on I'm gonna
[1:31:56] become whatever God wants me to become
[1:31:59] by His grace by His mercy but many times
[1:32:02] we like to wallow in self-pity
[1:32:05] yeah three head nods two eye blinks and
[1:32:08] a few a man's everything doing pretty
[1:32:10] good still we hanging in there that's
[1:32:13] right we like to wallow in self-pity oh
[1:32:15] I wish I was more I wish I was this hey
[1:32:17] listen all of us feel that way as
[1:32:19] Christians we do I feel like right now
[1:32:22] here I've been serving God the majority
[1:32:24] of my life and I feel like I'm just
[1:32:26] getting started after all these years
[1:32:27] some of you all have been in this longer
[1:32:29] and I have I know you feel the same way
[1:32:31] I do even like man I'm just getting
[1:32:33] started but then if I can take
[1:32:35] confidence in God put me in a situation
[1:32:38] he put me in a spot in time where he
[1:32:41] exactly wants me at that time I've got
[1:32:45] to trust that I got to have confidence
[1:32:47] in that because I sure can't change it
[1:32:50] if I do I don't want to end up in the
[1:32:52] belly of a whale because anytime anybody
[1:32:55] tries to change the will of God you find
[1:32:57] out what happens over and over and over
[1:32:59] again so what must I do I must count the
[1:33:01] cost I must take inventory of where I am
[1:33:04] as a child of God if I look at where I
[1:33:06] come from I look at what God's done for
[1:33:09] me I may not like where I'm at right now
[1:33:11] but if I look in the past and see what
[1:33:13] is done it gives me hope he's gonna do
[1:33:15] more for me in the future
[1:33:17] amen it's just like people suffering
[1:33:19] with all kinds of illnesses and things
[1:33:21] of that nature you take a man a woman I
[1:33:23] read a thing this morning where they
[1:33:25] talked about somebody losing a fight
[1:33:27] with lung cancer I thought but for a
[1:33:29] Christian that's not losing a battle if
[1:33:32] they died and they go by the way of the
[1:33:33] grave the moment they take a breath and
[1:33:35] that's the often in body they've been
[1:33:37] healed
[1:33:38] amen they're not suffering with divine
[1:33:40] or with with lung cancer anymore they've
[1:33:42] been healed in their body is perfect for
[1:33:44] take a doctor and put it on that
[1:33:45] theophany and try to put a scope on that
[1:33:47] the often in see percent lung cancer in
[1:33:49] it in aspect of it it's a healed body
[1:33:52] and man it's a perfect body it's a word
[1:33:55] body so for us it's not losing the
[1:33:57] battle you look at these people down
[1:33:59] through the through the martyr ISM when
[1:34:00] they would stand there and they would
[1:34:02] preach while they're being burn at the
[1:34:03] state they would testify while they're
[1:34:05] being fed to lions we said what about
[1:34:07] your losers but the less the world's
[1:34:09] view the prophet of God said they were
[1:34:11] heroes of faith a man died as a hero in
[1:34:15] the faith of God imagine Paul with his
[1:34:19] head laying around Nero's chopped block
[1:34:20] you thought boy I didn't see myself here
[1:34:22] today this isn't where I thought I
[1:34:25] should be but he was exactly where God
[1:34:26] wanted him that's what we have to take
[1:34:29] confidence and that every step that we
[1:34:31] take in this life there's a reason
[1:34:32] behind why God's doing it I know it's
[1:34:34] hard for us to accept that sometimes but
[1:34:36] there's a reason why now let me keep
[1:34:38] reiterating to you that doesn't mean
[1:34:40] that we just give up and throw our hands
[1:34:42] up and say oh well you know whatever and
[1:34:44] however not only we keep fighting we
[1:34:46] keep struggling we keep pressing but we
[1:34:48] there there must be a balance there you
[1:34:51] understand I'm trying to say to you we
[1:34:53] must be able to balance between
[1:34:55] struggling and hungry and thirsting and
[1:34:58] being burdened and having all of this in
[1:34:59] our heart and another part of us needs
[1:35:01] to be resting saying okay Lord I'm
[1:35:03] burdened I want to be more but I've got
[1:35:06] confidence you're in control
[1:35:09] oh praise the Lord I hope you see in
[1:35:11] daylight that's the thing that will
[1:35:13] bring us to the fruition of a child of
[1:35:15] God is that the husband had long
[1:35:18] patience waiting for the former in the
[1:35:20] latter rain amen God ain't worried here
[1:35:23] but biting his fingernails off thinking
[1:35:25] why in the name of God aren't they doing
[1:35:26] better he knows exactly where we are
[1:35:29] today he knows exactly why we are the
[1:35:31] way we are again some things we do is
[1:35:35] that appear stubbornness just because we
[1:35:37] don't want to do right that's when our
[1:35:39] daddy whips us I've had many a spanking
[1:35:42] because I don't listen the way I should
[1:35:44] listen it has nothing to do with my
[1:35:46] predestinated plan of God
[1:35:48] that's a disobedient child and he's
[1:35:50] gonna be dealt with if he's disobedient
[1:35:52] Amen I told the little Church Wednesday
[1:35:55] night I said you know the way you deal
[1:35:56] with bratty children's a shot and sit
[1:35:57] down I thought they're gonna pass out on
[1:35:59] me I said you must not tell your kids to
[1:36:01] shut up Amen but I said God does
[1:36:04] sometimes God looks I'm gonna zip it and
[1:36:08] you better zip it boy because I'm happy
[1:36:10] if you don't oh yeah God ain't always
[1:36:13] nice to us sometimes he's rough
[1:36:16] sometimes he's hard did you know the
[1:36:19] prophet of God said that sometimes God
[1:36:21] gets some mad at us he feels like
[1:36:22] kicking us well friends I'm sorry you
[1:36:26] didn't know that was in a message but
[1:36:27] it's been in there for 60 years Amen
[1:36:30] that's right since frustrated with us
[1:36:33] not because we're not maybe a child of
[1:36:36] God not because we're not Christians but
[1:36:38] because we fall away from staying in the
[1:36:40] course that God wants us to stay and
[1:36:42] we've got to keep our steps moving
[1:36:44] forward always remember them for living
[1:36:47] creatures they were always moving
[1:36:48] forward never moving backwards amen and
[1:36:50] if I'm moving forward what did the Bible
[1:36:52] say if I've done all that I know how to
[1:36:54] do to stand if I've counted all of my
[1:36:56] pebbles and I've done everything I'm
[1:36:58] supposed to do I may not be way down the
[1:37:00] rule but where I'm at I'm gonna keep on
[1:37:02] building keep on working keep on moving
[1:37:05] forward because eventually hallelujah
[1:37:07] God it's going to help me finish this
[1:37:09] word amen I got my hammer in my hand I
[1:37:13] got my nails in my head Sam and I we
[1:37:15] went through we went through purgatory I
[1:37:18] called it amen and that is the word I
[1:37:20] used is purgatory Shore down
[1:37:22] what seven years ago six years ago I was
[1:37:25] in the house and I had a had an old
[1:37:28] little skinny looking closet thing and
[1:37:30] that had closet on one side of the wall
[1:37:32] and on this side was a little tiny
[1:37:33] little pantry thing listen friends the
[1:37:36] noron family likes to eat we can't
[1:37:38] handle little pantries they don't work
[1:37:40] it's odd made a decision I said I'm
[1:37:43] gonna go in there and I'm gonna gut the
[1:37:45] thing out I'm gonna build a nice big
[1:37:46] walk-in pantry for sister Sam and so
[1:37:49] when I walked in there I pulled
[1:37:51] everything out gutted the thing kicked
[1:37:52] the walls in sledgehammer didn't I get
[1:37:54] my hands on and I pushed the floor on
[1:37:56] the floor was mushy and I look at my
[1:37:58] brother-in-law and I said that ain't
[1:37:59] good is it uh-uh
[1:38:01] about time we got done peeling it we had
[1:38:04] a hole the size of this church whether
[1:38:06] previous owners that let a water heater
[1:38:08] bust and then everything was robbed
[1:38:10] there were six layers of flooring on my
[1:38:12] kitchen floor six layers there was
[1:38:15] linoleum there was indoor/outdoor carpet
[1:38:17] in between linoleum I said welcome to
[1:38:20] the south hallelujah I mean I've never
[1:38:25] seen nothing like it we we dug and
[1:38:27] crowbarred and scraped and knife blade I
[1:38:29] mean we done everything we could and we
[1:38:31] gutted this thing and I get so
[1:38:33] frustrated because we'd be Church time
[1:38:35] and I'd be halfway down in a hole I'd be
[1:38:37] covered with mud I'd have just enough
[1:38:39] time to get in there and wrench myself
[1:38:41] off we had to support the floor we had
[1:38:43] to repair joists we had to do all kinds
[1:38:45] of things and I used to get so
[1:38:47] frustrated and I remember one morning I
[1:38:49] was in Iowa preached of her brother
[1:38:50] Isaiah Brooks and I was so frustrated
[1:38:52] with that house and I it's on my mind so
[1:38:55] bad I could think get that thing done
[1:38:57] get over with and I even got the
[1:38:59] preaching on it I guess I'm still
[1:39:01] preaching on today and I got in my mind
[1:39:05] I thought why can't I get this thing
[1:39:07] done God why don't you help me get this
[1:39:09] thing finished and while I was standing
[1:39:12] the platform the Holy Spirit spoke the
[1:39:14] words right through my mouth God makes
[1:39:15] all things beautiful in his time
[1:39:18] I didn't realize it but it was a life
[1:39:20] lesson for being nor odd I needed to
[1:39:23] learn that things aren't done overnight
[1:39:25] because I'm an impatient person I want
[1:39:27] it done yesterday amen I don't like to
[1:39:32] wait around on things you know if listen
[1:39:36] I've got it under control
[1:39:37] okay I've got victory when it comes to
[1:39:39] being impatient but they don't mean it
[1:39:41] don't bug me there are times that I get
[1:39:44] so impatient I've got to bite my lips
[1:39:46] all right boy you hold on hold on don't
[1:39:48] you don't you aren't you settle down hey
[1:39:50] I got it under control by God's grace
[1:39:52] I've got victory over the thing I thank
[1:39:55] the Lord for that but things don't
[1:39:57] happen overnight that's one of the first
[1:39:59] lessons you've got to learn as a
[1:40:00] Christian sometimes it takes time for
[1:40:03] God to do things I imagine that maybe
[1:40:05] when Abraham first heard from the Lord
[1:40:07] he was looking for a body change oh say
[1:40:10] about midnight that night if the Lord
[1:40:12] would have told him it had been 25 years
[1:40:14] before he got his body changed wonder
[1:40:16] how he too reacted to that but you know
[1:40:18] the Bible said Abraham walked with God
[1:40:21] and staggered not even though he himself
[1:40:24] in that Old Testament time he had doubts
[1:40:27] he even laughed at God when God told him
[1:40:29] he was going to do it he fell I did
[1:40:30] everything that Sarah did but when his
[1:40:32] divine commentary was wrote he said God
[1:40:37] looked on him as the father of faith he
[1:40:39] swaggered not do unbelief he believed
[1:40:41] God to the promise of God it goes to
[1:40:44] prove that many times in our mind when
[1:40:46] we think oh I'm never going to get there
[1:40:48] I'm never just keep on building keep on
[1:40:51] working count the cost put another
[1:40:53] pebble in the urn I'm one more step
[1:40:55] ahead than what I was yesterday drop one
[1:40:57] more pebble and okay now I'm moving on
[1:40:59] I'm doing a little bit better in Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ because if you're not careful the
[1:41:04] devil will become a shadow to you and it
[1:41:06] will haunt you all the days of your life
[1:41:08] and remember the devil will never let
[1:41:10] you forget yesterday he don't know what
[1:41:12] tomorrow holds the only thing he knows
[1:41:14] is yesterday so he'll never let you
[1:41:15] forget it he can't look into the future
[1:41:18] and tell you what's going to happen
[1:41:19] tomorrow oh he knows what the Bible said
[1:41:21] but he didn't tell you about your future
[1:41:22] he doesn't know what's going to happen
[1:41:24] from one day to the next the only thing
[1:41:26] he's got is yesterday and he uses it to
[1:41:28] the best of his advantage he reminds you
[1:41:31] of every time you sat
[1:41:32] mom and dad or but every time you lied
[1:41:33] or that candy bar you stole when used
[1:41:35] for tea nor ever what it was or that
[1:41:37] time such-and-such happened and you got
[1:41:39] mad and said bad word oh he reminds you
[1:41:41] of all of that kind of stuff
[1:41:43] amen but he'll never know your future
[1:41:46] God is the one that knows our future
[1:41:49] he's got it in the palms of his hands so
[1:41:52] it doesn't do me any good to get
[1:41:53] frustrated and say well I'll tell you oh
[1:41:55] I'm terrified it's a better question I
[1:41:57] am exactly where God wants me as long as
[1:42:00] I'm not moving backwards I am riding the
[1:42:03] predestinated will of God oh thank you
[1:42:06] Jesus amen you heard him singing this
[1:42:09] morning the song service I believe that
[1:42:11] a song leader led by the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:13] setting the stage many times for the
[1:42:15] message coming if you listen close to
[1:42:17] the songs you'll hear the the will of
[1:42:19] God being sang through them songs of
[1:42:20] what he's going to preach about let me
[1:42:22] read this to you out of second
[1:42:23] Corinthians 12 8 9 let's just see if the
[1:42:25] Lord was talking in the song service or
[1:42:26] not for this thing I besought the Lord
[1:42:28] thrice that it may depart from me and
[1:42:31] he's said unto me my grace is sufficient
[1:42:33] for thee from my strength is made
[1:42:37] perfect in weakness anybody remembers
[1:42:41] singing that this morning
[1:42:42] that's a Holy Ghost lead song leader
[1:42:45] right there amen these notes laying in
[1:42:47] here he don't know I don't tell him I
[1:42:49] don't tell nobody I don't even let Sam
[1:42:51] taste the sauce I'm a selfish chef when
[1:42:53] it comes to preaching amen amen I don't
[1:42:55] want you to eat until time to eat it
[1:42:57] Amen I don't even let you get a smell
[1:42:59] out of the kitchen I just bottle it all
[1:43:01] up and hold it in him Amen i don't want
[1:43:03] the devil to get ahold of it see because
[1:43:05] if he gets a hold of any starts of
[1:43:07] making all kinds of havoc and working on
[1:43:08] people this way and that way oh he's a
[1:43:10] good adversary he knows how to muddle
[1:43:12] things up and mix things up but I'll
[1:43:14] tell you when I see the Holy Ghost
[1:43:16] taking charge of the service I think
[1:43:17] Satan you ain't got a foothold on none
[1:43:19] of us amen and that's what I saw this
[1:43:22] morning when the songs are being sang
[1:43:24] all the little specials in the way the
[1:43:26] Holy Spirit was moving just listed the
[1:43:28] words and them saw how they're
[1:43:29] connecting with what I'm preaching you
[1:43:31] hear this morning
[1:43:32] and then my grace is sufficient in other
[1:43:35] words Paul don't be nothing more than
[1:43:37] you hate I am what I am by the grace of
[1:43:42] God well I want to be more yes you may
[1:43:45] want to be more but you cannot be more
[1:43:47] of yourself you have to wait till God
[1:43:49] brings you up a little bit higher the
[1:43:51] only thing you can do is make sure
[1:43:52] you're not going backwards make sure I'm
[1:43:54] in the faith make sure I'm counting the
[1:43:56] costs I'm taking inventory of where I'm
[1:43:59] at I'm not losing I'm not losing I may
[1:44:01] not be gaining but I'm not losing praise
[1:44:07] the Lord
[1:44:08] hey this goes to a lot of things weight
[1:44:11] loss I have got on that scale for a
[1:44:14] month now and that scale is from the
[1:44:16] devil did you know that Satan created a
[1:44:18] weight scale I'm convinced that was the
[1:44:21] first invention he gave to torment a man
[1:44:23] or a woman there's an old stupid scale I
[1:44:25] hate the thing I get on there and it
[1:44:28] ain't moved I mean I I'm running I'm
[1:44:31] jumping rope I'm doing all kinds of
[1:44:32] things I'm climbing mountains I'm you
[1:44:34] know I'm doing all of this and that
[1:44:36] scale ain't moved a bit and I hate the
[1:44:38] thing I hate it but then I have to talk
[1:44:40] to myself and say but I'm not gaining
[1:44:43] weight either it works on almost the
[1:44:46] opposite you know flip that over a
[1:44:48] little bit that's the way it is in
[1:44:49] Christianity
[1:44:50] I'm not backsliding I may not be moving
[1:44:53] forward so I must be in the perfect will
[1:44:55] of God where I am right now you have to
[1:44:58] look at these things friends if you
[1:44:59] don't study this you'll walk around
[1:45:00] discouraged all the time and I heard a
[1:45:03] preacher for many many years every time
[1:45:05] he got in the platform he said I just
[1:45:06] wonder about my own self I said God
[1:45:09] there ain't no hope for the rest of us
[1:45:10] then because if the leader don't know
[1:45:12] where he's at where the rest of them are
[1:45:14] gonna be a mint we must be content with
[1:45:18] where God has placed us
[1:45:20] and if there's gonna be more the Lord
[1:45:23] will reveal that to you he'll bird in
[1:45:24] your heart put something in you you need
[1:45:26] more and you start striving and when he
[1:45:28] puts the burden on you to move forward
[1:45:30] he'll take you in to that next step but
[1:45:33] you can't force yourself into it
[1:45:35] let me quote to you what brother Branham
[1:45:37] said about a chicken he said you cannot
[1:45:39] peep that chicken out of that egg he
[1:45:42] said if you do you'll kill it it has to
[1:45:45] come out on its own
[1:45:47] you can't rush the process you can't
[1:45:51] rush it you can look down there and say
[1:45:52] I wish that chicken would hatch you you
[1:45:54] may have on your mind you know Mary
[1:45:56] brown chicken you may have on your mind
[1:45:59] chicken dinner
[1:46:00] maybe Thanksgivings are coming eight you
[1:46:02] might want to slaughter that chicken and
[1:46:03] put it on the table put some thyme and
[1:46:05] some rosemary and some butter all over
[1:46:07] that thing oh god I'm hungry a man but
[1:46:12] you might want all of that but if you
[1:46:14] peep that chicken out of that egg you're
[1:46:16] gonna kill that chicken
[1:46:17] it'll never develop it'll never come to
[1:46:19] birth do you realize most of the animals
[1:46:21] today when they try to rush them to the
[1:46:23] table that's one thing is killing our
[1:46:25] bodies so much because they'll take an
[1:46:26] old chicken said let it eat grain
[1:46:28] they'll pump a bunch of steroids into it
[1:46:30] and put this thing into it
[1:46:31] feed it this type of deal that put them
[1:46:33] under lights and grow them up real super
[1:46:35] super fast and it's out of the natural
[1:46:38] process of that bird and their breasts
[1:46:41] and their legs and thighs and what more
[1:46:43] are so big they they break their legs
[1:46:45] and they fall in they can't even hardly
[1:46:46] walk in the yard because they pumping
[1:46:48] them up making them bigger
[1:46:49] that's about the way some people would
[1:46:51] like to be with Christianity Oh God make
[1:46:53] me a super Christian you better take
[1:46:55] your time you better take your time and
[1:46:59] get all of the elements that you can get
[1:47:00] get them right remember what that Indian
[1:47:03] told brother branham he said welcome
[1:47:04] welcome wants look them twice you're
[1:47:07] better - you're better to study where
[1:47:09] you're at count the cost of where you
[1:47:11] are rather than rush into something and
[1:47:13] make shipwreck that's right you know
[1:47:17] it's just like when people try to come
[1:47:18] to Christ they come to the altar and
[1:47:20] they pray nothing against then I'm not
[1:47:21] I'm not throwing off they kind of the
[1:47:23] altar and they pray and then they walk
[1:47:24] out the door and they're looking for the
[1:47:25] devil you know hey listen I appreciate
[1:47:29] that the determination you call it I
[1:47:32] appreciate the aggressive ad
[1:47:34] I've wanted to be a child of God like
[1:47:36] that but you better remember the devil
[1:47:37] they're going after has been going after
[1:47:40] man for six thousand years he ain't no
[1:47:42] it was brother Carroll you say ain't no
[1:47:43] dumb bunny he knows how to fight
[1:47:46] he's very slick he's very mean he's very
[1:47:49] selfish and he'll stop at nothing to
[1:47:52] take you to hell and to do everything he
[1:47:54] can to destroy your life
[1:47:55] so us jumping up from the otter where's
[1:47:58] that devil out in a month from now we're
[1:48:00] walking in there oh god I pray he never
[1:48:01] heard me say it because Satan will fight
[1:48:04] you to the bitter end the moment you
[1:48:06] make a confession there's going to be a
[1:48:08] battle that follows that confession we
[1:48:10] have to know what we're talking about
[1:48:12] that's why I fear that around the ranks
[1:48:15] of the message we've got to a place we
[1:48:16] hand somebody a book hand him a bunch of
[1:48:18] tapes get him to repeat a few
[1:48:20] catchphrases and glory to God there a
[1:48:21] message believer and what have we done
[1:48:23] we've pumped the chicken up so much it
[1:48:25] ain't got no legs to stand on it ain't
[1:48:28] got no foundation underneath it what the
[1:48:30] Bible say to strengthen and establish
[1:48:32] and settle you in the foundation as a
[1:48:35] child of God you must be settled before
[1:48:37] you take your next steps it's like
[1:48:40] walking a tightrope see you got one foot
[1:48:43] you better make sure that foot stable
[1:48:45] before you put the next foot in front
[1:48:46] because any step you could fall off
[1:48:48] you've got to know that your foundation
[1:48:50] is right before you can move on in
[1:48:52] spiritual things amen we save glory to
[1:48:56] God ah I was healed last night praise
[1:48:59] the Lord
[1:49:00] wonderful thank God for it but remember
[1:49:02] after you've made that testimony after
[1:49:04] you've made that confession
[1:49:05] Satan's going to be listening he's going
[1:49:07] to be coming after you and the Prophet
[1:49:09] said in divine healing you may get
[1:49:10] sicker in three days time than you'd
[1:49:12] ever been in your entire life he said
[1:49:15] that doesn't mean that God didn't heal
[1:49:16] you it just means this is a part of the
[1:49:18] programming this is what we've got to
[1:49:21] experience you must count the cost as a
[1:49:23] child of God just say yes I've made my
[1:49:26] confession and I'm willing to go through
[1:49:28] whatever it takes to be able to win
[1:49:29] God's grace in this matter
[1:49:31] amen you've got to count the cost
[1:49:33] because if you can't finish the building
[1:49:35] the Bible said they'll laugh at you
[1:49:38] they'll make fun of you oh you know how
[1:49:41] it is all sure
[1:49:42] so I read these forums sometimes not all
[1:49:45] the time but every day every now and
[1:49:46] then
[1:49:47] they come up with something you know
[1:49:48] with this on the believe the sign group
[1:49:50] and these are defectors that have come
[1:49:52] in every night and I'll try to read some
[1:49:54] of their comments when a new one shows
[1:49:55] up and it's the same old thing the same
[1:49:57] old way and they've come in a typical
[1:50:00] message person typical message person
[1:50:02] and I thought one of these days I'm
[1:50:05] gonna ask that bunch who are you getting
[1:50:07] your evidence from you're talking to the
[1:50:09] wrong people the people you're talking
[1:50:11] to are the ones that couldn't live right
[1:50:13] never went to church never paid a dollar
[1:50:15] tithe in their life they was always out
[1:50:17] doing things of the world and and and
[1:50:20] run into every prayer line in the
[1:50:22] country running to every camp meeting in
[1:50:23] the country they never had any stability
[1:50:25] and yet you're using them as your plumb
[1:50:27] line for those that believed the message
[1:50:28] let's talk to me a while I've been in 27
[1:50:31] years I'm a better example than they are
[1:50:33] if I want to talk to some of you you're
[1:50:35] a better example than they are you've
[1:50:36] been in at 40 years some of you 50 years
[1:50:39] some of you come on now but they use
[1:50:41] their example they want to use somebody
[1:50:43] that never had the Holy Ghost they want
[1:50:46] to use them as their example of the
[1:50:47] message you got to count the cost if a
[1:50:51] man a woman is gonna live right and live
[1:50:53] for God and listen friends it's not the
[1:50:54] Baptist that about the greatest reproach
[1:50:56] upon this message it hasn't been the
[1:50:58] Methodist that had been the Pentecostals
[1:51:00] it's been message people that has
[1:51:02] brought the reproach upon this message
[1:51:04] because they don't want to live to the
[1:51:06] level they're supposed to live to
[1:51:07] because everybody wants to rush into be
[1:51:09] manifested sons of God and speaking
[1:51:11] squirrels and controlling storms and
[1:51:13] this that the other but they don't want
[1:51:15] to learn how to pray they don't want to
[1:51:18] learn how to love one of those one
[1:51:19] another they don't want to they don't
[1:51:21] want to learn these principles that make
[1:51:23] a man as firm founded Christian we've
[1:51:26] got to have the right foundation
[1:51:27] underneath us or I don't care how
[1:51:29] beautiful the building is it'll topple
[1:51:30] at one point remember of oh Jesus give
[1:51:33] the parable about the man that had his
[1:51:35] house bid on the rock and the man that
[1:51:37] built his house on the sand if you read
[1:51:39] the scripture you'll find out that the
[1:51:41] storm vehemently beat against both
[1:51:44] houses
[1:51:45] the storm is coming whether we like it
[1:51:47] or not it's programmed into Christianity
[1:51:50] amen the devil's going to fight anything
[1:51:53] that looks like God but we've got to be
[1:51:55] confident that we're standing on a firm
[1:51:57] foundation am I where I want to be
[1:52:00] absolutely not I want to be well on
[1:52:01] higher up the ladder but I'm not
[1:52:03] backsliding therefore I must be where
[1:52:05] God wants me at this present time if you
[1:52:10] ain't careful you'll have a cloud
[1:52:11] following you
[1:52:12] a dark shadow following you're trying to
[1:52:15] get you in a condition to say oh you see
[1:52:18] you know how it is this time preaching
[1:52:20] to the choir here I know that but I know
[1:52:22] how it is you want you in the middle of
[1:52:24] the night sometimes you wake up and a
[1:52:26] thought hits your mind you're
[1:52:27] discouraged with yourself you're upset
[1:52:29] with yourself why did I waste years and
[1:52:31] why did I do this what yes we have
[1:52:33] regrets we have things that we've all
[1:52:36] failed in but if you've got the baptism
[1:52:39] of the Holy Ghost God is faithful to you
[1:52:41] right now this very moment God is
[1:52:43] faithful to put you where you need to be
[1:52:46] you've got to have confidence you've got
[1:52:49] to trust God that where you are right
[1:52:51] now is exactly where he wants you to be
[1:52:53] because anything else he'll reveal it to
[1:52:55] you that's why we get burden in our
[1:52:57] hearts sometimes and and some things
[1:52:59] Torm innocent and work on us sometimes
[1:53:02] God is trying to tell you it's time to
[1:53:05] come up higher and then there are times
[1:53:07] that we're tormenting ourselves
[1:53:10] sometimes we're trying to beat at the
[1:53:12] air trying to make things happen that
[1:53:13] ain't never going to happen right you've
[1:53:16] got to test your motive test your
[1:53:17] objective testify to all of the things
[1:53:20] that God has done for you and testify of
[1:53:23] what he's doing in your life now but
[1:53:24] expect more tomorrow
[1:53:26] amen because God is always moving he's
[1:53:29] always expanding where you are today
[1:53:31] will not be where you are tomorrow
[1:53:33] because God's got a whole lot more out
[1:53:34] there for us tomorrow but God don't let
[1:53:37] me move until it's time for me to move
[1:53:40] right you see this little thing right
[1:53:43] here patience you know brother branham
[1:53:45] said about that guy he said when you
[1:53:47] really get Holy Ghost patience he said
[1:53:48] you learn to let God be your next
[1:53:51] crossing thing he said you don't move
[1:53:54] until you see God moving we see God move
[1:53:56] then you step right up with him we need
[1:53:58] a whole lot of that this more
[1:54:00] we need to learn to wait on him for the
[1:54:02] next cues of our life you know how it is
[1:54:05] some of you parents in here you look
[1:54:06] down you seen your kids and you wish
[1:54:08] they'd be a whole lot more and if you
[1:54:10] start drilling at them and beating at
[1:54:11] them and fussing I don't want you
[1:54:13] anymore on what you are you're not going
[1:54:14] to get him that way overnight you have
[1:54:16] to train them you have to work with them
[1:54:18] you have to teach them we take for
[1:54:20] granted sometimes we think everybody
[1:54:22] knows what we know some people just
[1:54:27] think God it yet
[1:54:28] Oh God hallelujah some people just ain't
[1:54:33] there yet you have to teach them you
[1:54:35] have to train them you have to bring
[1:54:37] them up into the things of God
[1:54:38] right and spiritual children are the
[1:54:40] same way you have to teach him what's
[1:54:42] right teach him what's true in the Bible
[1:54:44] when I watch this in 2nd chapter 13
[1:54:47] verse 3 Paul said since she seek proof
[1:54:50] of Christ speaking in me which to you
[1:54:53] word is not weak but is mighty in you
[1:54:56] for though he was crucified through
[1:54:59] weakness yet he liveth by the power of
[1:55:01] God for we also are weak in him amen but
[1:55:06] we shall live with him by the power of
[1:55:09] God toward you examine yourselves
[1:55:13] whether you be in the faith prove your
[1:55:18] own selves no you're not your own selves
[1:55:22] how that Jesus Christ is in you except
[1:55:25] ye be reprobates so Paul is saying if
[1:55:29] you want to know where you are now count
[1:55:30] the cost look in your urn see what how
[1:55:33] many pebbles you got in there
[1:55:35] are you missing pebbles is God got a
[1:55:37] bunch more pebbles to put in there and
[1:55:39] you're just not putting them in there
[1:55:40] examine yourself well I'm not where I
[1:55:43] should be true but are you that way
[1:55:45] because your backsliding argue that way
[1:55:47] because you're not trying are you that
[1:55:49] way because you're not praying are you
[1:55:50] that way because you're not working
[1:55:51] listen I saw a whole bunch of folks at
[1:55:53] work here last night they put their
[1:55:55] coveralls on and they went down in the
[1:55:57] trenches put their mining hat on they
[1:55:58] got to work I saw a lot of people up
[1:56:01] here working last night so don't be
[1:56:03] discouraged if you're working and you
[1:56:04] don't feel like you're moving you just
[1:56:06] keep standing there and keep mining away
[1:56:08] you'll get a gold nugget after a while
[1:56:10] God will see to it he brings the
[1:56:12] increase but examine yourself am I going
[1:56:15] backwards if you are something's wrong
[1:56:17] you need to move forward then right
[1:56:19] because God doesn't want us going
[1:56:20] backwards friends he wants us pressing
[1:56:23] forward in the things of God hey this is
[1:56:25] what Paul said examine yourselves
[1:56:27] examine your cells prove yourselves
[1:56:31] whether you be in the faith now listen
[1:56:33] to this and God me misunderstood brother
[1:56:35] BAM I'm saved and I've been baptized in
[1:56:38] the name of Jesus Christ but how do I
[1:56:40] get away from a stubborn spirit well my
[1:56:44] Christian brother or sister
[1:56:47] I love how brother branham identifies
[1:56:49] them as a Christian it doesn't mean
[1:56:52] there's going to call him a devil or
[1:56:54] glory to God you you use center you
[1:56:56] don't you say you've been baptized and
[1:56:58] say you haven't even got started yet he
[1:57:00] said well my Christian brother or sister
[1:57:03] whoever it may be now most times when
[1:57:05] you find people that's got stubborn
[1:57:07] spirits it's usually a complex that
[1:57:09] causes this they inherited it from their
[1:57:11] mother father uncle aunt grandmother
[1:57:13] grandfather someone like that and if
[1:57:15] you'll chase it back down through your
[1:57:16] life if you'll chase it down through
[1:57:19] your life I've taken my experience of
[1:57:21] discernment thousands of those that have
[1:57:23] that spirit cases on the platform first
[1:57:25] thing you know I'd chase that spirit by
[1:57:27] discernment fine there was a granddaddy
[1:57:28] or grandmother somebody else back there
[1:57:31] and you inherit that by Nature then
[1:57:34] brother ben says how do you overcome it
[1:57:36] he said you just overcome it the same
[1:57:38] way you do anything else my face he said
[1:57:41] like a snake you don't aggravate a snake
[1:57:43] you just walk away and leave it alone it
[1:57:44] said just overcome the thing by faith
[1:57:47] but here's the way that most of it goes
[1:57:49] in Christianity I've got a stubborn
[1:57:51] spirit
[1:57:51] Oh God I'm stubborn that must mean I'm
[1:57:54] not saved that must mean I'm not born
[1:57:56] again now wait a minute
[1:57:57] count your pebbles if you're praying if
[1:58:00] you're fighting if you're working if
[1:58:01] you're laboring if you're trying to keep
[1:58:03] the Spirit of God in your life if you're
[1:58:05] taking every step forward that you can
[1:58:07] stubborn spirit or not you're where you
[1:58:09] need to be in the in the presence of
[1:58:11] Dolphin
[1:58:12] it does not matter god don't look at
[1:58:14] that thing and so they've got this and
[1:58:15] they've got that I can't use them at
[1:58:17] that's the very people God looks for is
[1:58:19] the people that have got all the
[1:58:20] problems Amen God likes taking broken
[1:58:24] people and making beautiful things out
[1:58:25] of them
[1:58:26] amen his reputation was made with
[1:58:28] sinners come on somebody he doesn't look
[1:58:31] for the best and the ones that got it
[1:58:33] all together they're the ones that don't
[1:58:35] need help but the ones that need help
[1:58:38] there's the one Jesus wants somebody
[1:58:41] that can cry out to him lord I need your
[1:58:43] help I need your strength I need your
[1:58:45] wisdom that's the one God can use
[1:58:47] however God's looking for somebody he
[1:58:51] can put his hands on and use them for
[1:58:53] the glory of God but they can't be
[1:58:54] somebody's got it all figured out you
[1:58:57] take a man a woman they got certain
[1:58:59] things that's been passed down to him to
[1:59:01] nature just like we taught last night
[1:59:02] just like this court here this morning
[1:59:03] you take all the little things that have
[1:59:05] come down to you and here you stand as a
[1:59:08] Christian as a child of God and you got
[1:59:10] little things in your life that you are
[1:59:12] battling on a daily basis and if you
[1:59:14] ain't careful the dark cloud will come
[1:59:16] by you and start talking well you see
[1:59:19] something's wrong with you something's
[1:59:20] wrong with your experience something's
[1:59:21] wrong no ain't nothing wrong with my
[1:59:23] experience if I'm counting the cost and
[1:59:25] I'm counting all them pebbles in my urn
[1:59:27] I am doing everything I can to serve God
[1:59:30] I am praying I am fasting I'm doing
[1:59:33] whatever I need to do to keep myself
[1:59:35] surrendered to the Lord I'm standing as
[1:59:37] the Bible said when you do nothing else
[1:59:39] to stand I'm standing I've got my feet
[1:59:42] flat I'm not moving backwards I'm right
[1:59:44] where I'm at it doesn't matter what I'm
[1:59:46] battling I'm waiting on God to give me
[1:59:48] the increase
[1:59:51] a man our friends I hope you understand
[1:59:54] what I'm preaching you this morning this
[1:59:55] will help us if we can apply it to our
[1:59:57] lives because Satan knows Satan knows
[2:00:00] better than all of us he knows that you
[2:00:02] cannot move beyond what God has made you
[2:00:04] to be I don't care how much the man
[2:00:06] wants to be a preacher if you don't have
[2:00:08] a gift in his life he'll never preach
[2:00:09] right I don't care how much a person
[2:00:12] wants to do gifted things any kind of
[2:00:14] gift at work if there's no gift there
[2:00:16] they'll just be beating it there or they
[2:00:18] might make a few little compliments here
[2:00:19] there but you can take a gifted person
[2:00:21] amen and set them on a music instrument
[2:00:23] or whatever it may be and they can do 50
[2:00:26] times more than somebody that that is
[2:00:28] just learning by the music and by note
[2:00:30] or something like that why because that
[2:00:32] gift gives them the ability to break
[2:00:34] into supernatural channels and you
[2:00:36] cannot help it if you're not made that
[2:00:38] way you're not made that way and I
[2:00:43] believe that's one reason the Bible said
[2:00:44] make a joyful noise unto the Lord
[2:00:47] because not everybody is built in a
[2:00:49] certain way
[2:00:50] amen they all have different gifts they
[2:00:53] all have different abilities and the
[2:00:55] things I may be gifted in you may have
[2:00:56] 50 gifts that's different than mine but
[2:00:58] we put us together we become a
[2:01:00] powerhouse team all of us put together
[2:01:03] we become an invincible army that's what
[2:01:05] were the venom said and Satan don't know
[2:01:07] what to do with this when we surrender
[2:01:08] our lives to God in such a way that all
[2:01:10] them gifts are moving and milling
[2:01:12] through the body working in the kingdom
[2:01:14] of God Satan does not know how to attack
[2:01:16] such a force like that but one of the
[2:01:21] greatest weapons he's got is the weapon
[2:01:23] of discouragement
[2:01:26] if he can discourage you while you're
[2:01:28] working he thinks he can get you down
[2:01:31] and get you depressed
[2:01:32] oh I'm not there yet yes but I'm
[2:01:35] building I want you to listen devil I'm
[2:01:38] walking sure I may be halfway through
[2:01:42] sure I may have to crawl out of a mud
[2:01:44] hole and get the rent jumping a shout
[2:01:47] and get cleaned off and run to church
[2:01:49] sure I may be aggravated that the
[2:01:51] two-by-fours and the the sheetrock and
[2:01:53] all that ain't in the right place yet
[2:01:54] but I'm working I'm working how many
[2:01:59] here like cook let me likes cook you
[2:02:01] might your sisters I know especially
[2:02:02] brothers you like it too you just know
[2:02:04] admit it because you think it's a girl
[2:02:06] thing but any good chef will tell you
[2:02:11] whenever you put something into the pan
[2:02:13] you started out scalding hot and you
[2:02:15] step it back
[2:02:16] worse steak you'll ever eat in your life
[2:02:18] is one it tastes like the bottom of your
[2:02:19] shoe you just remember I said that but
[2:02:23] you put it in there you turn the hot the
[2:02:25] pan up real nice and hot it's scalding
[2:02:27] hot you take that steak and you set it
[2:02:29] in there like that and leave it on that
[2:02:30] heat you'll kill the steak it'll taste
[2:02:33] like leather it won't be good at all but
[2:02:35] you crank that heat way on down there
[2:02:37] after you get the pan nice and hot put
[2:02:39] some butter in there put some thyme put
[2:02:41] some garlic put some rosemary and you
[2:02:43] take that pan you tilt it back you base
[2:02:44] that steak like that with that butter
[2:02:46] you just take it at low easy gradual
[2:02:49] heat you pull that babydoll off there
[2:02:51] and I mean that's a steak fit for a king
[2:02:53] come on somebody hey man hey man that's
[2:02:56] for how you want to say man you just
[2:02:58] afraid to hey man it's good but you
[2:03:01] don't throw it in the pan and cook it to
[2:03:03] death you ease it up you ease the
[2:03:06] temperature up to a place to where it
[2:03:08] will come to it what they call
[2:03:09] perfection in the way they cook it
[2:03:11] anything you ever make you can't just
[2:03:13] listen my mama I love my mama my mama
[2:03:16] greatest woman my face his plan but my
[2:03:18] mama could not cook water if her and my
[2:03:21] daddy used to getting fusses all the
[2:03:23] time because my dad was a cook my dad
[2:03:25] loved to cook and he was oh he's a great
[2:03:26] cook and my mom my poor mother she can
[2:03:28] cook corn bread and I think that's about
[2:03:30] the only thing that she's ever really
[2:03:32] all that good and I'd tell her dad would
[2:03:34] tell her all the time dad would say
[2:03:35] Wilma you're cooking the thing to death
[2:03:40] she throw a pot of beans in there but
[2:03:42] imagine I mean she crank it all the way
[2:03:44] up there and you could see the smoke
[2:03:45] billowing all over the house we'd have a
[2:03:47] cloud and how she just cook in the devil
[2:03:49] and I mean it's just on fire almost the
[2:03:52] think you know he said turn it down why
[2:03:56] are you cooking it so big he's turn it
[2:03:58] down a little bit he walked over and
[2:03:59] crank it down mama
[2:04:00] he'd walk away my mother
[2:04:04] to her that's the way it was
[2:04:07] wonder how many Christians are that way
[2:04:10] they think all to be a Christian I've
[2:04:12] got to be right out
[2:04:14] you know sometimes friends being red-hot
[2:04:17] is good but don't forget if you always
[2:04:20] go wide open 100 miles an hour in
[2:04:24] spiritual things wonder how much times
[2:04:27] it turns into you doing it and not God
[2:04:30] doing it I'm not talking about a red-hot
[2:04:34] Christian experience I know the quotes
[2:04:35] you probably think of those type things
[2:04:37] but what I'm talking about is I wonder
[2:04:39] how much is human motivation how much is
[2:04:41] spiritual motivation I I believe in
[2:04:46] prayer I know you do too
[2:04:48] but do you realize that God can hear a
[2:04:50] five-minute prayer as much as you near a
[2:04:52] three-hour one but we get into our minds
[2:04:56] to be a Christian we got to pray three
[2:04:58] hours a day what about a man working 90
[2:05:00] hours a week what about some of these
[2:05:03] brothers that literally go into the
[2:05:04] ground and like my mom my mamma's my
[2:05:07] grandfather was a coal miner they'd
[2:05:09] start at 4:00 in the morning there was
[2:05:10] under the ground by five o'clock and
[2:05:12] they stayed there to nearly midnight and
[2:05:13] it was back for 3-4 hours sleep it was
[2:05:15] right back into the coal mines again
[2:05:16] they've done that seven days a week
[2:05:17] nearly yeah my grandfather got killed in
[2:05:20] a coal mine
[2:05:20] and he had worked a hundred hours that
[2:05:22] week the day got killed and you
[2:05:24] understand a person like that so they're
[2:05:27] supposed to have a four-hour prayer
[2:05:28] meeting every day they ain't got time
[2:05:30] for it they ain't got the ability to do
[2:05:33] it they're raised in a family hey that's
[2:05:34] just Scripture the Bible said when a man
[2:05:37] is married he cares for the his wife and
[2:05:39] how he may please his wife in other
[2:05:40] words he's got people to take care of he
[2:05:43] don't have the time for God that it used
[2:05:44] to have you take a man that has a lot of
[2:05:46] obligations or a woman that has a lot of
[2:05:48] obligations I've said sometimes a woman
[2:05:50] I know Susanna Wesley I know I know I
[2:05:53] know but Susanna Wesley didn't live in
[2:05:55] our day the pressures in this day are a
[2:06:00] lot different than the day she lived in
[2:06:02] and sometimes sisters in this age they
[2:06:05] got a kid on one hip a vacuum cleaner in
[2:06:07] the other a tape going in the background
[2:06:09] the phone ringing over there and emails
[2:06:11] turpan over there on their phone over
[2:06:13] there
[2:06:16] forgive me huh
[2:06:20] they gotta pray oh god oh god you see
[2:06:24] such and such you see so and so you see
[2:06:25] this and that God hears those prayers
[2:06:28] but if we ain't careful a cloud will
[2:06:31] come by you know you don't ever go to
[2:06:34] all-night prayer meetings you don't do
[2:06:36] this you don't do that but listen I
[2:06:38] would rather have five minutes in a
[2:06:40] genuine connection with God than five
[2:06:43] hours with nothing let me tell you
[2:06:46] brother Branham said about Moses he said
[2:06:47] Moses in 40 years didn't learn nothing
[2:06:50] he said fifteen minutes in the presence
[2:06:51] of a burning bush he knew enough to
[2:06:53] deliver an entire army you see a lot of
[2:06:58] times that cloud will tell us ah you
[2:07:01] ain't where you need to be that's true
[2:07:03] maybe I'm not but I sure ain't where I
[2:07:05] used to be a man I'm not gaining weight
[2:07:09] [Laughter]
[2:07:11] listen to that Benny
[2:07:15] I'm not backsliding I'm movin powered by
[2:07:18] God's grace well I wish things would be
[2:07:22] better you know he said if you're laying
[2:07:24] in bed paralyzed he said if you can
[2:07:26] wiggle a finger we're gettin the name of
[2:07:28] Jesus Christ well I wish you'd be better
[2:07:31] but wiggle the finger in the meantime
[2:07:33] now here's the key of it if you can
[2:07:35] wiggle a finger and you don't wiggle it
[2:07:37] then you're backsliding if you got the
[2:07:39] ability wiggle the finger wiggle
[2:07:41] because that's moving forward cuz
[2:07:44] brother Graham said tomorrow you'll be
[2:07:45] able to wiggle to amen and listen I know
[2:07:49] we got people that have the ability to
[2:07:51] pray we got prayer warriors in the
[2:07:52] church I'm convinced that's one reason
[2:07:54] God ordained some people with the
[2:07:56] ability to pray because that the rest of
[2:07:58] the body will be occupied with matters
[2:08:00] of the church let me tell you something
[2:08:02] as a minister friends I literally wake
[2:08:04] up a morning to about 40 emails and
[2:08:06] things all over the place and let me
[2:08:08] tell you if I don't shut the computer
[2:08:09] off I never find time to pray people
[2:08:12] ringing and calling and this and that
[2:08:14] all the time and you when you travel
[2:08:15] around like I do
[2:08:16] everybody in there brother wants to ask
[2:08:18] you advice and ask you this and ask you
[2:08:19] that because they got pastors that won't
[2:08:21] talk to them and if they do they'll
[2:08:23] repeat over the pulpit what they say to
[2:08:25] them so they'll pick up a telephone
[2:08:27] brother band what
[2:08:28] you think about this what do you think
[2:08:29] about that how do you feel about that
[2:08:30] I've got a man right now in Arizona that
[2:08:33] talked to me three weeks ago and I'm
[2:08:34] still praying and I'm waiting on what to
[2:08:36] say to him about how to call I know
[2:08:39] people think well my god well he is a
[2:08:41] ministry you had a land of presence of
[2:08:43] God for hours I would love to I would
[2:08:47] love to there are times I was in North
[2:08:49] Carolina a few weeks ago and I had a
[2:08:51] chance to pray a prayed to and a half
[2:08:53] hours in a room I went through every
[2:08:54] little issue that had been lagging and
[2:08:56] been waning and waiting and I had two
[2:08:58] and a half hours where I could pray
[2:08:59] after two and a half hours the phone
[2:09:01] started ringing and this started
[2:09:02] happened that started having that
[2:09:03] started happening I said thank you Lord
[2:09:05] for the two-and-a-half hours I needed it
[2:09:08] but sometimes you get up in the morning
[2:09:10] and it's as much as you can do read your
[2:09:12] Bible talk to the Lord about 10 minutes
[2:09:14] or so and you got to be off to the next
[2:09:16] thing
[2:09:17] I'm not advocating that we don't try to
[2:09:19] pray but I'm trying to put a little
[2:09:21] encouragement and a little bit of a
[2:09:23] bright shining lining around that dark
[2:09:25] cloud to let you know that just because
[2:09:27] you're busy in this life you're busy for
[2:09:30] the work of the Lord you're busy for the
[2:09:32] things of God hey sister you think
[2:09:33] raising them kids ain't to work of the
[2:09:35] Lord you're the fifth gospel that's what
[2:09:36] the Prophet said amen isn't today
[2:09:39] Father's Day today's Father's Day and
[2:09:41] then happy Father's Day I just happen to
[2:09:43] think of that happy Father's Day to your
[2:09:44] fathers next Sunday okay all right well
[2:09:48] I'm a week ahead hallelujah happy
[2:09:53] Father's Day it's a job it's a
[2:09:56] responsibility brother BAM talked about
[2:09:58] a man said all you'd see him at lunch
[2:09:59] with a sandwich in his hand reading his
[2:10:01] Bible he said he raised his kids to the
[2:10:03] glory of God done what God's purpose was
[2:10:05] in his life sometimes that's all a man
[2:10:08] can do and he may have just so much time
[2:10:10] to do this yeah but it doesn't mean
[2:10:12] because we're not having all-night
[2:10:13] prayer meetings and the Tri hear people
[2:10:15] say things like that all the time they
[2:10:16] say glory to God I remember the days
[2:10:18] when we had hot prayer meetings I just
[2:10:21] like to get people smiling in church
[2:10:22] well we'll start there
[2:10:24] let's start with getting them smiling in
[2:10:26] church and then we'll work on all-night
[2:10:27] prayer meetings later somebody's people
[2:10:31] to mess is most unhappy people that ever
[2:10:33] seen in my life or the other you can
[2:10:36] even get him to smile sometimes much
[2:10:37] less shout amen
[2:10:40] but that's what I'm trying to say to you
[2:10:41] sometimes it's baby steps financial
[2:10:45] people will tell you that when you're
[2:10:46] trying to get out of a mess of a debt
[2:10:48] it's what they call baby steps you have
[2:10:51] to take little steps to try to get
[2:10:53] yourself out of the mess it's the same
[2:10:54] thing serving the Lord now there may be
[2:10:56] people in here you may have the
[2:10:58] opportunity every morning you may have
[2:10:59] an hour with the Lord god bless you I
[2:11:01] pray the Lord gives you five by the time
[2:11:02] the thing is over with
[2:11:03] I pray God gives you all kinds of time
[2:11:05] to stay in the presence of God but
[2:11:07] brother sister what I'm trying to say to
[2:11:09] you is that you cannot allow yourself to
[2:11:11] be discouraged because you've got so
[2:11:13] many irons in the fire God understands
[2:11:15] every bit of that it's like I said about
[2:11:18] the church and central down there Oh
[2:11:20] who's gonna want to come pastor the
[2:11:22] church out there I said God knows where
[2:11:24] Grand Falls Central is he knows where
[2:11:27] that is just like he knew where Saul was
[2:11:29] hiding in the stuff Amen people I've
[2:11:33] been in so many churches vacated pastors
[2:11:35] and things over the year and I'd hear
[2:11:37] them say the same thing well who's gonna
[2:11:39] want to come here let me tell you
[2:11:40] something God knows exactly what needs
[2:11:42] to happen in these churches he knows
[2:11:44] exactly what needs to take place he has
[2:11:47] everything just said I'm just the way it
[2:11:49] needs to be settled and that's the thing
[2:11:51] we got to understand is that when
[2:11:53] circumstances come up in our life and we
[2:11:55] feel like Oh surely this this is the end
[2:11:57] oh it's over no this this is I'm never
[2:12:00] gonna get out of this God knew he was
[2:12:02] going into that thing before you went
[2:12:03] into it and if he put you in it he
[2:12:06] already had the answer out of it we just
[2:12:10] have to trust him we have to trust his
[2:12:12] wisdom in the situation's were in that's
[2:12:15] right that's right
[2:12:18] exactly oh my this is this and the key
[2:12:21] to the door but the Branham says he said
[2:12:23] somebody said to me the day I would
[2:12:25] become a Christian when I get good
[2:12:26] enough hey I'll tell you what you do
[2:12:29] Papa look around you find that place
[2:12:32] where you can get good enough and tell
[2:12:34] me where that place is because I want to
[2:12:36] go there too he says
[2:12:41] Christ never came to save the good man
[2:12:44] he came to save the bad one when you
[2:12:47] think you're good he didn't come to save
[2:12:51] you he come to say them that knows they
[2:12:55] are bad
[2:12:56] oh praise the Lord he said that's right
[2:13:00] he said it's like we're in one big
[2:13:01] building over here we're in jail he said
[2:13:03] I can't stand over in the corner of that
[2:13:04] jail cell and say hey help me get out of
[2:13:06] this jail he said we're both in the same
[2:13:08] fix every man born in the world
[2:13:10] he said born in sin shapen iniquity came
[2:13:12] to the world speaking lies he's a
[2:13:14] renegade to begin with he's a renegade
[2:13:17] to begin with but when God takes us out
[2:13:20] of the jail cell and places us on our
[2:13:22] way then we have to know that the God
[2:13:26] that took us out of prison is able to
[2:13:28] put us in the rapture and resurrection
[2:13:30] we got to know that we got to have
[2:13:32] confidence in the thing that he started
[2:13:35] what did the Bible say he will complete
[2:13:37] this good work that he began in you I've
[2:13:42] said it a thousand times let me say it
[2:13:44] again to you this morning anytime I've
[2:13:46] ever felt to myself I think I'll quit
[2:13:48] it's like something says to me how can
[2:13:50] you quit something you never started I
[2:13:53] never began this Christ is the one that
[2:13:57] began this he got me out of a jail cell
[2:13:59] and now it's up to him to take me all
[2:14:01] the way up I have to trust him I have to
[2:14:05] have confidence in what he's gonna do in
[2:14:07] my life and if I'm not backsliding I got
[2:14:09] to keep moving forward but if I can't
[2:14:11] take another step forward I can say okay
[2:14:13] God there's a reason why you're doing
[2:14:14] the things that you're doing
[2:14:16] hey man I'm getting long winded on my
[2:14:18] approach hey man watch this oh thank you
[2:14:22] Jesus don't you love the Lord oh he's
[2:14:25] wonderful litany watches the first
[2:14:27] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 he said
[2:14:30] see your calling brethren how that not
[2:14:32] many wise men after the flesh not many
[2:14:34] mighty not many noble are called that
[2:14:40] ought to encourage you because
[2:14:41] everything I just said we ain't I ain't
[2:14:44] Marty I ain't noble ah oh wise neither
[2:14:48] you
[2:14:49] come on say man sure people walk by you
[2:14:54] on the street right not all that great
[2:14:57] of a thing in the eyes of the world but
[2:14:59] God have chosen the foolish things of
[2:15:02] this world to confound the wise
[2:15:05] God chose weak things of the world to
[2:15:09] confound the things which are mighty and
[2:15:10] the base things and things which are
[2:15:12] despised hath God chosen yea he said in
[2:15:15] the things which are not to be brought
[2:15:17] the things that are and then first
[2:15:20] Corinthians 2 1 through 3
[2:15:21] he says brethren I came you not with
[2:15:23] excellency of speech of wisdom declaring
[2:15:24] only the testimony of God for I
[2:15:26] determined not to know anything save
[2:15:28] Jesus Christ and him crucified I was
[2:15:30] with you in weakness in fear and in much
[2:15:34] trembling but abandoned Auctus learning
[2:15:37] all of his human weaknesses and learning
[2:15:39] all of the things that go with his his
[2:15:42] stuttering ways and high stuttered along
[2:15:45] he said God he said how am I gonna
[2:15:46] deliver people when I can't even talk he
[2:15:48] said who made your tongue he said I'll
[2:15:52] give you a voice he said you'll be God
[2:15:54] and I'll make Aaron your prophet he said
[2:15:56] go down and tell him I said let my
[2:15:58] children go let my people go tell them
[2:16:00] to come out of that mess I want my
[2:16:02] children back I'm gonna bring them to
[2:16:03] this mountain and they're gonna worship
[2:16:05] me and I want you to go tell them you
[2:16:07] tell them through Aaron Moses oh I can't
[2:16:10] do the job God's that's what I'm
[2:16:11] counting on you see when we're applying
[2:16:17] for a job we put the best things we can
[2:16:19] find on the resume but whenever your
[2:16:21] resume looks like I can't I failed I
[2:16:23] lied I murdered I did this I did that
[2:16:25] God said you got the job
[2:16:28] he's not looking for the one who's got
[2:16:29] the best qualifications friends
[2:16:31] hey man he's looking for the ones that
[2:16:34] ain't got no qualifications now watch
[2:16:37] this in the message does God call a man
[2:16:41] to judge him that first morning but the
[2:16:42] man who says when you plead anything to
[2:16:43] God you've got to have a reason for it
[2:16:45] he said like you say to this mountain be
[2:16:47] removed don't doubt he said but believe
[2:16:49] what you said he'll come to pass
[2:16:50] now that's altogether controlled on
[2:16:52] motive and objective and there's were
[2:16:55] many of us make mistakes we go out there
[2:16:57] and say now I'm gonna show you I've got
[2:16:59] faith
[2:17:00] to do this thing he says you're wrong to
[2:17:02] begin with God don't give you gifts just
[2:17:06] to play with it
[2:17:10] hallelujah I believe the message I'm
[2:17:12] gonna speak to squirrels when I was a
[2:17:18] young Christian
[2:17:19] I mean first stages of my Christian I'm
[2:17:21] still a young man I guess a lot of
[2:17:23] people say anyhow I said we got
[2:17:27] spoken-word power I cannot tell you how
[2:17:30] many times I spoke to wind to lightning
[2:17:33] to red lights to flies you name them I
[2:17:38] tried to use creative power to make my
[2:17:41] life a flowery bed of ease best I could
[2:17:43] you know what you find out you find out
[2:17:46] that those are things that God alone
[2:17:48] gives to you when that happened with
[2:17:50] brother Branham you remember what he
[2:17:51] said he fell into that super anointing
[2:17:54] came on him
[2:17:55] well the RAM couldn't stood out there
[2:17:56] himself and said okay I think today's a
[2:17:58] good day to speak a mess of squirrels
[2:17:59] okay you go over there and you do this
[2:18:01] he said the Holy Spirit had to move on
[2:18:03] him first before he could do it even
[2:18:05] Jesus himself said the son can do
[2:18:09] nothing of himself except what he first
[2:18:12] sees the father doing there's no way in
[2:18:14] the world we can do it of ourself I
[2:18:16] cannot make things happen neither can
[2:18:18] you
[2:18:18] so what good does it do me to stand
[2:18:20] there and say oh I'm gonna get rapturing
[2:18:22] faith I'm gonna listen to every message
[2:18:24] I can I'm gonna look up every quote on
[2:18:26] rap stream faith I'm gonna get rap
[2:18:27] stream faith you know when you'll get
[2:18:28] rap string faith when God brings the
[2:18:30] increase out of you to come to rap
[2:18:32] string faith until then just keep
[2:18:36] working keep pressing and if you come
[2:18:39] this way and you can't go nowhere
[2:18:40] brother BAM said if I come up to a wall
[2:18:42] I can't get above it and I can't get
[2:18:43] under it can't get around it you know
[2:18:45] what he said he said I just stand still
[2:18:47] and wait let God make the way through it
[2:18:49] sometimes we don't have any other choice
[2:18:51] because in the great scope of eternity
[2:18:54] zuv you you don't understand that may be
[2:18:57] the thing you're battling and facing in
[2:18:59] your life that thing may be connected to
[2:19:01] 30 other things in the spear of
[2:19:03] influence and if you move this way it
[2:19:06] may throw a whole bunch of cogs out of
[2:19:08] there right place so God's holding gyro
[2:19:11] steady so there's no way that can
[2:19:13] be really thanking what he said in an
[2:19:16] adoption he said the unconfessed sins of
[2:19:19] you believers could knock somebody from
[2:19:21] getting healed up here at the platform
[2:19:22] you said and greatest battle ever fought
[2:19:24] he talked about if one star would move
[2:19:26] out of their position it would throw the
[2:19:27] whole host of God out of order so the
[2:19:30] thing that you're doing in your life and
[2:19:31] you come to that spot and so I wish I
[2:19:33] had more God may burden you for more
[2:19:36] there will be more for you to have if
[2:19:37] it's God burden you but you can't move
[2:19:39] beyond where he's got you because if you
[2:19:42] step this way there may be something
[2:19:44] back here connected to you that could be
[2:19:46] thrown completely out of order so God
[2:19:49] may be waiting he may be waiting on this
[2:19:51] one and that one and this thing and that
[2:19:53] circumstances this this and this it'll
[2:19:56] all line up in time you just have to
[2:19:58] stand still and wait on it they that
[2:20:01] wait on the Lord shall renew their
[2:20:04] strength right they'll mount up with
[2:20:07] wings like eagles right all these things
[2:20:11] have to come you said they're sacred he
[2:20:13] said then when God says so he said you
[2:20:15] can come with thus sayeth the Lord when
[2:20:17] God says so he said if you want to study
[2:20:20] anything at all he said you look at the
[2:20:21] spirit of the thing he said look at the
[2:20:23] spirit and Families look at the spirits
[2:20:25] and cities look at the spirits and
[2:20:26] churches and what more he said all of
[2:20:28] these type of atmospheres and all these
[2:20:31] type of things that people have got
[2:20:32] there's something that controls and
[2:20:34] motivates them all right if you're a
[2:20:36] Christian look and see what's motivating
[2:20:38] you if the reason you want to be a
[2:20:41] better Christian is because you just
[2:20:43] feel like you're not where you need to
[2:20:45] be and it's just you feeling that way
[2:20:47] well that's not going to mount to a hill
[2:20:49] of beans
[2:20:49] look at it the way God sees it don't
[2:20:53] look at the way you look at it it's easy
[2:20:55] for us to take the Bible and start
[2:20:57] writing down we could do pro and con :
[2:20:59] okay I obey this I obey that I'm doing
[2:21:02] this I keep the law I do this you know
[2:21:04] there's another fellow in the Bible had
[2:21:05] that idea his name was the rich young
[2:21:07] ruler Jesus said you know the
[2:21:09] commandments he said every one of them
[2:21:11] he said here's my list Jesus I've kept
[2:21:12] every one of them since I've been a kid
[2:21:14] and Jesus looked and said one thing you
[2:21:17] still lack do you understand that many
[2:21:21] times no matter how spiritual we may be
[2:21:24] no matter how spiritual we may come up
[2:21:26] into the things of God
[2:21:27] there's always gonna be something
[2:21:28] lacking somewhere so what we do about it
[2:21:34] well we're gonna have prayer meetings
[2:21:36] you could have every prayer meeting in
[2:21:37] the world and gonna make the flower grow
[2:21:38] any faster you could read the Bible
[2:21:43] every single day of your life until God
[2:21:44] gives the increase you're just waiting
[2:21:46] on him to make the moves only thing you
[2:21:49] can do is be patient
[2:21:51] so God you see in me what needs to be
[2:21:53] developed and I'm waiting on you until
[2:21:55] you develop out of my life what you want
[2:21:58] to develop out of my life what I'm doing
[2:22:03] good here doing good here doing good
[2:22:05] here doing good here doing good here I
[2:22:07] don't know that one it's a little little
[2:22:09] a little song I'm not a good Christian
[2:22:11] because these things aren't an order God
[2:22:13] ain't a bit more nervous about them
[2:22:15] things in that column than nothing in
[2:22:16] the world you're the one nervous not him
[2:22:19] it's you worrying about it because Jesus
[2:22:23] looks at your life and remember the
[2:22:24] Prophet said he sees you in a perfect
[2:22:26] condition already the blood of Christ
[2:22:29] puts us in a condition where he sees us
[2:22:32] perfected and the thing that God done in
[2:22:35] our heart he'll bring it to its
[2:22:36] completion one day he will but we've got
[2:22:39] to be patient
[2:22:41] gotta wait on him we got to count the
[2:22:43] cost okay god this is where I'm at today
[2:22:45] am I where I want to be no but if you
[2:22:48] brought me here then you can bring me
[2:22:50] here and then here and then here oh
[2:22:56] thank you lord thank you Jesus amen let
[2:23:01] me hurry watch this I just love how the
[2:23:05] how the Bible says like this right here
[2:23:08] in verse 12 of Saint John 14 there he
[2:23:12] said verily I say he that believeth on
[2:23:13] me the works that I do shall he do also
[2:23:16] greater works than these shouting the
[2:23:19] Prophet said there's nothing greater
[2:23:21] could have been done
[2:23:22] he said the correct translation is more
[2:23:24] God will do more through the people of
[2:23:27] God because there's more people to work
[2:23:28] through he said he said and whatsoever
[2:23:30] you shall ask in my name that will I do
[2:23:33] that the father may be glorified in the
[2:23:36] son then the word he uses here if he
[2:23:38] shall ask a Itoh which means to
[2:23:41] egg to call to crave the desire to
[2:23:44] require anything in my name that's the
[2:23:47] thing I will do well if that's got to be
[2:23:49] something God puts in your heart you
[2:23:52] can't just want it for once sake you
[2:23:55] have to test your motive and objective
[2:23:56] if I want to be a better Christian if I
[2:23:59] want to move beyond where I'm at today
[2:24:00] is it just me wanting to be better is it
[2:24:03] just me wanting to be higher me wanting
[2:24:06] to do this or is it because God's
[2:24:07] telling me I've got more out there for
[2:24:09] you you need to start stepping forward I
[2:24:11] know that sounds strange to some people
[2:24:14] you think well how could how could it be
[2:24:15] that way if you think of it in this way
[2:24:17] when a person desires to do something
[2:24:20] they genuinely desire to do something
[2:24:24] there's nothing wrong with the desire to
[2:24:26] want to do it but you can desire things
[2:24:29] that's not the will of God I'm gonna
[2:24:34] give you a case when we gonna go home
[2:24:37] David wanted to see the Ark of God
[2:24:39] restored by the brem said he had an
[2:24:43] honest desire he didn't desire for the
[2:24:46] wrong things he wanted the thing to be
[2:24:47] right he wanted God's ark restored back
[2:24:50] to the people but David took his own
[2:24:52] route there was a prophet in the land he
[2:24:55] should have consulted Nathan and Nathan
[2:24:57] would have told him bring the Ark over
[2:24:59] on the shoulders of the Levites but they
[2:25:02] put it on a new cart they put it on a
[2:25:04] set of wheels and the wheels rolled him
[2:25:06] all the way in there and those wheels
[2:25:08] rolled him out of the will of God
[2:25:09] and in trying to do God to serve that
[2:25:11] means remember the brem said they
[2:25:12] trumpeted they had Pentecostal meetings
[2:25:14] had great singers they had the people
[2:25:16] shouting and David even danced and his
[2:25:18] clothes fell off completely out of the
[2:25:20] will of God because the Ark was supposed
[2:25:23] to come on the shoulders of the Levites
[2:25:27] you see what I'm saying to you sometimes
[2:25:30] we can want something that's a righteous
[2:25:32] thing but make sure we're doing it in
[2:25:35] God's timing in God's ceasing in the way
[2:25:39] that God wants it to be done
[2:25:42] many things I'd like to see manifest in
[2:25:45] my life but I realize already I'm never
[2:25:47] going to come to that spot unless I'm
[2:25:48] patient I wait on him to bring those
[2:25:50] things out of my life and I may not
[2:25:53] understand it all but one trial after
[2:25:54] another after 9:00 you realize brother
[2:25:57] mem said it was trial after trial test
[2:25:59] after test trial after trial test after
[2:26:00] test and that's the day in the life of a
[2:26:02] child are gone we wake up in the morning
[2:26:04] his mercies are new then it's trial
[2:26:06] trial trial test test test trial trial
[2:26:08] trial test test test time to go to sleep
[2:26:10] that's a normal day and you think why am
[2:26:13] I going through all of this when I
[2:26:15] should be a that's what you're really
[2:26:16] thinking when I should be up here why is
[2:26:20] all this happening when I I should be
[2:26:22] you know it's easy for us to get
[2:26:24] offended whenever we go through things
[2:26:26] because in our mind we think that I'm
[2:26:29] bribed
[2:26:29] I'm the elect of God yeah you are
[2:26:34] that's why you're going through that
[2:26:35] thing and the Lord Jesus is determined
[2:26:40] to make sure that the things that we are
[2:26:43] going through will bring him glory and
[2:26:47] not us because when we stand there on
[2:26:52] that day they're not a one of us gonna
[2:26:53] be able to say I brought myself here I
[2:26:55] lived right I prayed I attended
[2:26:58] all-night prayer meetings I listened to
[2:26:59] every tape and the message I listened to
[2:27:01] every book and a message you realize
[2:27:03] there's gonna be people in the rapture
[2:27:04] that's never gonna get to hear every
[2:27:05] tape they're gonna be people in the
[2:27:08] jungles out there in the foreign fields
[2:27:09] that ain't never gonna be able to read
[2:27:10] every book they may only get a hold of
[2:27:13] 200 books in their lifetime but they're
[2:27:15] gonna have somebody preached to them
[2:27:16] they're gonna have the Holy Ghost and
[2:27:17] God's gonna work with them and perfect
[2:27:19] their character and they're gonna be a
[2:27:20] part of the rapture just like you and I
[2:27:22] are because God knows what we need and
[2:27:25] how we need it amen we have to trust him
[2:27:29] ah tell you we say these remarks and I
[2:27:33] know I know what we're meaning when we
[2:27:35] say them but well all that church should
[2:27:37] be higher up the road that's true but
[2:27:39] the church st. going no higher till God
[2:27:41] brings her higher
[2:27:43] I mean I look around the situation's
[2:27:46] around Jude I get just a discouraged and
[2:27:48] fed up but just like you all do
[2:27:49] I mean why in the world can't people be
[2:27:51] different I mean human beings sometimes
[2:27:54] are the most curious things I can figure
[2:27:57] an animal out an animal makes sense it
[2:27:58] eats and sleeps and but humans they're
[2:28:03] an enigma nothing seems to satisfy me
[2:28:07] there's all the dynamic of the human
[2:28:10] mind is something that people are still
[2:28:12] studying six thousand years later
[2:28:13] they're still ain't figured it out and
[2:28:15] the best guess they got as we come from
[2:28:17] monkeys and that's probably why we're
[2:28:18] all the way we are a man that's probably
[2:28:21] about the truth of it a man what I'm
[2:28:24] trying to say to you is that we see all
[2:28:26] the different you know the the the the
[2:28:29] nuances and the and the different parts
[2:28:31] of the human mind and the aspects that
[2:28:33] you see all the funniness and the
[2:28:35] strangeness that have that exist in
[2:28:38] people yes people are so strange and so
[2:28:41] funny but we serve a God that is mindful
[2:28:45] of every single nuance every single
[2:28:49] oddity every funny thing how it all
[2:28:52] works together he just looks at it like
[2:28:54] one great picture that he understands
[2:28:56] and in all of that confusion all of
[2:28:59] those people here's the bride of Jesus
[2:29:01] Christ scattered throughout the midst of
[2:29:02] all of this humanity and he knows how on
[2:29:06] my part and your part how it all works
[2:29:08] together in the great economy of God I'm
[2:29:12] not saying we don't know hunger blessed
[2:29:13] are they the hunger and thirst I'm not
[2:29:15] saying we don't try but I'm saying we
[2:29:17] need to count the cost sometimes we need
[2:29:20] to look into our earn and say okay I may
[2:29:22] not be where I need to be but I've done
[2:29:24] everything I know how to do to be the
[2:29:26] right kind of Christian I'm living the
[2:29:28] best that I possibly know how give
[2:29:31] yourself some credit
[2:29:33] give yourself some grace friends
[2:29:36] sometimes we are our own worst enemies
[2:29:38] we're judge and jury of everything we do
[2:29:40] we don't need the devil to condemn us we
[2:29:43] do a better job of it ourselves because
[2:29:46] we look at things in our life and we say
[2:29:47] all right and we hear a preacher preach
[2:29:50] and he'll say something cut us to the
[2:29:51] quick you'd be talking to yourself say I
[2:29:53] know I was a rotten thing
[2:29:55] give yourself some grace count the cost
[2:29:58] are you praying are you studying or you
[2:30:01] reading your Bible are you doing like
[2:30:02] you should
[2:30:02] are you moving forward long as you ain't
[2:30:05] moving backward stand there flat-footed
[2:30:07] and say okay God I'm doing the best I
[2:30:09] know how
[2:30:10] and I'm asking you to help me that when
[2:30:13] the next step comes if you burden me for
[2:30:15] something greater just help me be able
[2:30:17] to step right into a flow oven and step
[2:30:18] on up amen because otherwise you can't
[2:30:21] do it of yourself there's just no way
[2:30:24] you can do it of yourself I know it's
[2:30:26] been strange to preach this way after
[2:30:29] the last couple nights but this really
[2:30:31] is what they say the icing on the cake
[2:30:34] because if you think of what I preached
[2:30:35] to you last night you think how we open
[2:30:37] this up about God wanting us to have
[2:30:39] hope you understand the theme of what
[2:30:42] I'm trying to preach to you God wants us
[2:30:44] to have a confidence in ourselves and
[2:30:47] that means if I'm not here and I feel
[2:30:49] like I should be here I just relax okay
[2:30:51] God I'm here
[2:30:52] praise the Lord I'm here I'm what I am I
[2:30:55] can't be anything different I'm just I
[2:30:57] am what I am by the grace of God it
[2:31:00] gives you a hope is this what the
[2:31:02] prophets said about that woman that dark
[2:31:04] cloud falling around I'm wondering how
[2:31:05] many sleepless nights she had oh I just
[2:31:09] wish I was you remember you remember the
[2:31:10] woman had the dream I was reading it
[2:31:11] this morning
[2:31:12] Brad was talking about how she saw
[2:31:14] herself on white sands you know the
[2:31:16] eagle come down all that she was so
[2:31:18] worried about that dream the prophet of
[2:31:20] God said she made her whole family
[2:31:21] nervous worrying about the dream brother
[2:31:23] Bream said sister you was on white sands
[2:31:26] he said that represents purity said stop
[2:31:28] worrying you're making your whole family
[2:31:30] nervous what good does it do to worry
[2:31:33] about where yet mm-hmm hey listen we see
[2:31:38] things sometimes when we think how are
[2:31:40] people gonna survive you know I go to
[2:31:43] these these countries and I see people
[2:31:44] sitting there that they don't have one
[2:31:47] good meal a week sometimes they have to
[2:31:49] beg everything they get and their
[2:31:51] Christians their Holy Ghost field people
[2:31:53] and I think how they're gonna survive
[2:31:54] but then I remember the Bible said if I
[2:31:57] can feed sparrows I can feed you
[2:32:00] never seen the righteous forsaken I've
[2:32:02] never seen the seat of God beggin bread
[2:32:04] you know and I say beg but you
[2:32:06] understand what I mean they have to work
[2:32:08] and struggle and fight to get everything
[2:32:09] that gets what I mean God knows how to
[2:32:11] take care of them and you look at that
[2:32:13] and you think God why don't you do it
[2:32:15] this way how do you know if he did it
[2:32:17] that way if it wouldn't disrupt a whole
[2:32:19] lot of other things in their life
[2:32:22] sometimes God puts them in situations
[2:32:24] we're blessed aren't we three square
[2:32:29] meals a day
[2:32:30] cars heat cool when we need it we're
[2:32:33] blessed or are we or are we a lot of the
[2:32:42] things that we call blessings are
[2:32:43] actually some of our greatest hindrances
[2:32:47] that's what I'm trying to say to you God
[2:32:49] sees the whole picture through eternity
[2:32:52] scope through eternities view and I am
[2:32:55] closed and I'm not gonna say it not do
[2:32:57] it I'm closin the Eternity scope
[2:33:00] eternity is view God sees the whole
[2:33:02] picture of it so we have to learn to be
[2:33:04] contented okay God here's where I am
[2:33:07] today now I don't want to be here
[2:33:09] tomorrow but if you choose for me to be
[2:33:11] here tomorrow I'll stay put until the
[2:33:13] next step comes because that's what
[2:33:16] maturity really is you know as a
[2:33:18] minister sometimes either situations
[2:33:21] come up and I see it I could attack it
[2:33:23] right away but I've learned take a step
[2:33:26] back for a moment and pray over that
[2:33:27] thing watching watching to see how it
[2:33:29] develops watch and see what comes out of
[2:33:31] it because a lot of times if you rush in
[2:33:33] and make a quick decision you can make a
[2:33:34] wrong one and the thing you think was
[2:33:37] right is actually the wrong the think
[2:33:39] you think was wrong there's the things
[2:33:40] gonna be right it's always the opposite
[2:33:43] sometimes so you just said still okay
[2:33:46] god I want more I do with all my heart I
[2:33:53] want more but til more comes I'll stay
[2:33:57] here I won't let the devil pull me back
[2:33:59] I'll just stay put right where you put
[2:34:02] me
[2:34:03] I want this to encourage your friends I
[2:34:07] wanted to encourage you and I want you
[2:34:09] to be able to look at your life as a
[2:34:11] child of God and realize that Satan uses
[2:34:14] these very things to discourage us so
[2:34:17] many times you look at your families you
[2:34:20] look at situations at work and Satan can
[2:34:22] take all of that and make that almost
[2:34:24] like it's your own personal fault that's
[2:34:27] why I was preaching to you last night a
[2:34:28] lot of these things you struggle with
[2:34:29] you never asked for it it was given to
[2:34:32] you it was a head of hair down to you
[2:34:35] through through the natural way of
[2:34:38] natural birth and James 1 verse 5 if any
[2:34:41] of you lack wisdom let him ask of God he
[2:34:44] said they give it to all men liberally
[2:34:45] upbraideth not shall be given to him but
[2:34:47] let him ask in faith nothing wavering
[2:34:49] for he that waiver is like the wave of a
[2:34:53] sea driven with the wind and tossed let
[2:34:55] not a man think that he shall receive
[2:34:58] anything of the Lord but a double minded
[2:35:00] man is unstable in all of his ways then
[2:35:05] the Prophet says this one my motive is
[2:35:07] right when my objective is right and God
[2:35:10] and my heart is leading me if I can't
[2:35:13] get over the mountain if I can't get
[2:35:15] around the mountain then I might say
[2:35:18] mountain move lorry he said in that one
[2:35:23] little spoonful of mountain may drop
[2:35:24] down but it'll have to obey me
[2:35:27] eventually but you know I said I was
[2:35:34] quitting didn't I I am we can be the
[2:35:40] most impatient people in the world
[2:35:41] though we ask God to do something and we
[2:35:45] want it now that society's trained us to
[2:35:47] be that way
[2:35:48] humans are so impatient you know you go
[2:35:52] to McDonald's they got a 30-second
[2:35:53] window from the time you order the time
[2:35:55] you get your bag and run out there or
[2:35:57] Wendy's whichever place you might go to
[2:36:02] just saying
[2:36:06] amen the world is push-button put your
[2:36:15] dishes in push a button want popcorn
[2:36:17] push the button want TV dinner pop it in
[2:36:22] push a button but when it comes to the
[2:36:24] things of God it's not a push-button
[2:36:27] religion you don't get it instantly it
[2:36:32] doesn't come quickly it's just something
[2:36:36] that takes time I don't like it either I
[2:36:42] wish we could get it all right now but
[2:36:47] we have to be patient they that wait on
[2:36:50] the Lord they shall renew their strength
[2:36:53] and mount up with the wings of eagles
[2:36:56] Oh God help me be patient
[2:37:01] help me now get frustrated with myself
[2:37:03] help me not get discouraged with me help
[2:37:06] me trust that I'm where I need to be in
[2:37:08] his side let's pray together
[2:37:25] Lord Jesus father I know in my heart
[2:37:31] that the very thing that you've let me
[2:37:34] preach this morning is it really hits
[2:37:38] home with me lord I know it hits home
[2:37:42] with these others here but lord I I know
[2:37:45] as far as I'm concerned that's always
[2:37:46] been my battle always wanting to do more
[2:37:50] and go greater and be bigger as Lord I
[2:37:55] read this message I study this Bible and
[2:37:59] I see what's laying before us is the
[2:38:00] People of God and Lord I've always had
[2:38:04] such a burden and a fervent desire to
[2:38:07] get us there
[2:38:09] even in my preaching sometimes Lord I
[2:38:11] get so strong with it there's almost try
[2:38:14] to push people into it and that's part
[2:38:17] of what we got to do as preachers we've
[2:38:18] got to drive at home sometimes but Lord
[2:38:21] at the same time I realize God we have
[2:38:24] to have patience these things don't
[2:38:27] develop overnight help us Lord
[2:38:31] father help us this morning as your
[2:38:34] children they're just kind of settle
[2:38:36] into this revelation that you've give us
[2:38:38] today help us to understand what it is
[2:38:41] we need to change in our way of thinking
[2:38:43] or in our mind our mindset and help us
[2:38:50] Lord to be patient with ourselves help
[2:38:53] us to give ourselves grace and
[2:38:54] transition as we move from one thing to
[2:38:57] another lord help us to slow down a
[2:38:58] little bit and just look at ourselves
[2:38:59] and count the cost and say okay Lord
[2:39:01] where I am is where you want me and I'm
[2:39:05] gonna stay firm I'm gonna be faithful
[2:39:06] I'm gonna be loyal to the place that
[2:39:08] you've placed me
[2:39:10] god help me not be impatient it helped
[2:39:13] me to settle down and wait on you to
[2:39:15] lead me and when you place a burden in
[2:39:17] my heart for more or for greater or for
[2:39:19] bigger or for whatever it may be Lord
[2:39:21] then help me to move right into that
[2:39:23] revelation help me to step right into
[2:39:25] that imagery of what you want me to be
[2:39:27] which is more but God until then lord
[2:39:30] help me to work within the vocation help
[2:39:33] me to work in the capacity of God that
[2:39:34] you want me to work in Lord and let it
[2:39:37] be for these people this morning Lord
[2:39:38] then as they examine themselves Lord
[2:39:42] it's easy for us to push my lord we want
[2:39:45] hunger we want desire we don't want to
[2:39:48] be lazy but God help us all sort of
[2:39:50] recognize that we need to be satisfied
[2:39:53] yes we want a deeper walk with you yes
[2:39:57] we want to know you in a greater way but
[2:39:59] lord help me be satisfied with what
[2:40:01] you've chosen to show me help me be
[2:40:04] satisfied with what you've chosen to do
[2:40:06] for me and Goblin you want to do more
[2:40:09] I'm ready for it lord help us this
[2:40:11] morning I pray in Jesus name

[2:41:17] I pray Lord God please please help us
[2:41:20] lord help us in Jesus name sing a little
[2:41:28] song David wait upon the Lord let's sing
[2:41:30] that let me give you a tiny example of
[2:41:34] the principle I'm preaching to you
[2:41:35] brother band was said when they would
[2:41:37] seek for the Holy Ghost
[2:41:38] he said they bring him up to an altar
[2:41:41] and grab their chin try to make him say
[2:41:42] Jesus Jesus Jesus real fast he said they
[2:41:45] were trying to push himself into
[2:41:48] something rather than just yield
[2:41:50] themselves and let the Lord do the work
[2:41:51] that that's what I'm trying to tell you
[2:41:54] we don't want to force our self into
[2:41:56] something you can't force God to do
[2:41:58] anything because the whole secret of
[2:42:00] Christianity ways is just yielding just
[2:42:03] yielding just surrendering it's okay
[2:42:04] Lord Here I am I don't want to be guilty
[2:42:07] of having the same type of Spirit on me
[2:42:09] as what many of them did when they
[2:42:10] dragged people up to the altar to get
[2:42:12] saved you could drag all you want to but
[2:42:15] jesus said no man comes to me except my
[2:42:19] father draws him first it is going to
[2:42:22] take him to make the next moves
[2:42:23] Oh God this morning help me be in that
[2:42:25] kind of mindset amen let's sing it
[2:42:28] together they
[2:42:30] [Music]

[2:43:48] [Applause]
[2:43:51] Oh
[2:43:52] [Music]
[2:44:04] when Nehemiah was building the wall
[2:44:08] Tobiah and samba lat
[2:44:10] came and tried to discourage him from
[2:44:13] doing his work
[2:44:14] they even got him a priest to tell him
[2:44:19] come into the house of the Lord come
[2:44:21] into the house of the Lord and rest
[2:44:23] yourself a little while and he says this
[2:44:25] in verse 12 chapter 6 chapter lo I
[2:44:28] perceived that God had not sent him he
[2:44:31] pronounced this prophesy against me
[2:44:32] total by and sanballat had hired him
[2:44:35] therefore was he hired I should be
[2:44:37] afraid and do so and sin that they might
[2:44:41] have matter for an evil report he knew
[2:44:43] he had no business in the temple they
[2:44:45] tried to bring him in the temple when he
[2:44:46] wasn't had no business there but he said
[2:44:49] these words my god think that upon until
[2:44:51] bye and Sam black according to their
[2:44:53] works on the prophetess note no daya and
[2:44:58] the rest of the prophets that they would
[2:45:00] have put me in fear the wall was
[2:45:04] finished 12 fifth day of the month of a
[2:45:08] loo in the fiftieth and the two days and
[2:45:10] it came to pass when all our enemies
[2:45:12] heard thereof and all the heathens round
[2:45:14] about us saw these things they were much
[2:45:15] cast down in their own eyes
[2:45:17] and they perceive that this work was
[2:45:20] wrought of God the devil will always
[2:45:24] send a tow bionis ambolyn and even if he
[2:45:27] has to come through a religious
[2:45:29] perspective and even if he has to use a
[2:45:32] religious mindset to try to discourage
[2:45:34] you from doing the work of God Satan
[2:45:37] will use any method he can to try to
[2:45:40] discourage you from continuing your work
[2:45:42] but that's why we have to be faithful to
[2:45:45] wherever we are to be faithful at that
[2:45:47] moment in time of what God has called us
[2:45:50] to be
[2:45:51] we've got all kinds of Samba laps until
[2:45:53] buyers in our life but keep working
[2:45:55] hammer in one hand sword in the other
[2:45:57] and the will of God in your heart just
[2:46:00] keep working keep fighting keep pressing
[2:46:02] you even tried to use a prophetess to
[2:46:06] bring this man of God off that wall all
[2:46:09] by Satan has all kinds of tricks he has
[2:46:13] all kinds of little things but we have
[2:46:15] to have enough discernment about
[2:46:16] ourselves that's why Paul said examine
[2:46:19] yourself in other words discern yourself
[2:46:22] count the cost is this me is this what
[2:46:26] I'm trying why am i trying to be more
[2:46:28] what what what's the point of it to get
[2:46:30] my self glory so that I can sit back and
[2:46:32] my lazy boy and say boy I've really
[2:46:35] turned out to be a Christian if that's
[2:46:38] all it is friends it'll never come to
[2:46:40] the place it needs to come to because
[2:46:42] everything God does in us we ought to be
[2:46:43] able to sit back on a lazy boy and say
[2:46:45] Lord I'm so thankful for what you've
[2:46:47] done in me it's not of me of any works
[2:46:50] the man could boast but God that showed
