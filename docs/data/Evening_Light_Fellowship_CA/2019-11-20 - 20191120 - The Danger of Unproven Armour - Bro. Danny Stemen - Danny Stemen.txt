do we have many faults a man become short of the glory of God but thank God for grace a man Calvary was grace what Jesus did was grace brother to bring us to that place where our sin is in the seal forgetfulness that's grace hey man we're used to that place where no man can lay a charge against God's elect this grace a man we didn't deserve it we were born to that nature a man and really that was that was what we wanted to do that's how we wanted to live was according to that nature a man but the word turned it around amen the preaching of the truth brought us to repentance amen and I was going to maybe going to some more thoughts on repentance well we leave that for another service a man where the grace of God and we were late getting here very late just a few minutes ago because we were at the our house today they're on Mockingbird Drive and to thank you for your prayers and the sign is now sold amen so thank the Lord amen so he got it right there on the for sale sign sold a man so we're waiting for everything to come to a conclusion now and it's a the individual that is buying it is a schoolteacher a man and of course she's got children overall and so on I think they would like to be able to move in before the end of the year but we'll have to wait and see and but there's things that we have to do it the house there ourselves and make sure that everything is working amen and as far as we know it is but we want it we want to check it and so thank you for your prayers amen so we gave God the glory amen so we're when you pray you're praying to someone a man you're praying to God a man you're praying to Elohim the self-existing one a man and he's the all-powerful one he's got ever the amazing that he got everything under his control a man raised the name of the Lord brother thank God and he wants to bring us amen bring us in into that relationship with him so he's everything is under your control hey man so whatever you ask the Father in my name he said he will do it they may have thank God for the revelation of the day a man so brother its salvation in the name redemption in the name healing in the name everything is in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ all power in heaven and in earth we have access to it through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ he is our Lord he is our Savior amen by the grace of God so grace of God be with us as we go through the final plans of the house and so uh took after it well over two years trying to sell it it was a tremendous burden I know that you are some of you felt that same thing as well as a burden for myself and sister Betty you know going from the house to the condo house to the condo and so on and of course there was a tremendous burden there so we thank the Lord for relieving us of that burden to God be the glory amen and also to ask you to continue to remember our sister Rose Gayle in prayer in Alberta there and for her need and her problems with cancer the grace of God for the salvation of her soul the grace of God for the healing of her body a man so we pray that the Lord would deal with her in her soul amen and then God will bring the past the promise brother listen see we got to go beyond when it comes to Redemption brother it goes beyond you know just it's in our souls I've been redeemed I've been redeemed you know I've been redeemed spiritually and physically they met by the grace of God and what we're experiencing spiritually we're going to experience physically amen we were caught up spiritually we could being caught up physically by the grace of God and you can be impress I contact with certain individuals overseas and they're there wanting more understanding of the rapture I remember some time ago that an individual wrote me and and he said where in the world to get rapture he said that word is not even in the Bible and I remember responding to the brother I said well brother that's the s the English word I said what does that mean I said to be cut off and I said well is that in the Bible cut off and I said it's there you go here go there go there and I said in English it's rapture I said I don't know what it is in French and I said I don't know what it is in German I don't know what it is in some other language I said or whatever your languages and so on so I said brother that's just that's just a word but I said you'll find the meaning of it in the Word of God you'll find it's a promise to the seed of God the sons and daughters of God so I said brother if you got any other thing that you can further explain it let me know never come back a man so no brother so mother it is it is a resurrection and it is a rapture because that the Bible preaches it the Bible teaches it and the Bible gives prophecy concerning a man the physical resurrection and the physical rapture by the grace of God so we're looking forward to that by grace so be in prayer and for the revelation of the of the rapture being prayer for for your pastors he tries to endeavor to help explain to different ones that are that are emailing me you know they want to understand this they want to understand that and so on and the brother looking for understanding of the rapture and I would Brian sent him in all mine then the quotes I sent him on the rapture well you know some of the quotes that I've used recently concerning the rapture the rapture the rapture come back and he said no you still didn't get the revelation of the rapture whether takes god it takes your melody a man it takes the Holy Ghost amen well he wanted he wanted to he wanted to find a quote directly by whether Branham saying that the Hinton message is the revelation of Rattray fate and it's there it's a little here a little there my other folks I give brother you ought to come up with that revelation that the message of the hour is resurrection Rattray faith what was Luther's message what was his faith justification and brother everything God does in every age it was to give faith for that age a man and it was adding to our faith and so on trouble justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit so what what what's left what's left now the only thing left now is the resurrection and the rapture amen praise the name of the Lord so I thank God for that revelation I think offer that understanding to God be the glory amen so I made every to share that with the Saints across the island cannot love cause the other but around the world a man so there's many that have contacted me for this this this this by pray grace the Holy Ghost shall be there to give them the revelation they need amen to God be the glory so again just to remind you that the Lord willing on Sunday I have asked our brother vice ruler to give his testimony amen I I offered him tonight but no it was too it was too fast it was too close and because that was only yesterday I believe I was asking him and so we will all give our our brother some time on Sunday to give his testimony and I I felt to do this after he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I did ask our brother you know concerning his first baptism and it was in it was in the titles not not the name of the titles it was the titles a van and he explained to me you know when he was first baptized that way but thank God for the grace that brought him to the word and brought him to the weight because it was anything that God looking for now it's the name mother and if there's anything a bride it's going to take from her husband or her mate is his name a man she changes her name to his name by the grace of God a man so I have been Lord dealing with our brother Weiser and trusting and believing that our brothers are part of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ a male and that he needed the name not just titles well I would baptize in the name of the son now what is his name you know if you're baptized in the name of your pastor what's his name and so on so there has to be a name oh yeah so and any I've had to deal with government-issue sometimes work for different individuals outside the city and go and find out what their name was you know when they were dedicated when they were baptized as children or babies or whatever and so on would you get would you please go to the government to get this get this they wanted proof they wanted evidence and so on that they were you know dedicated or they were born as it were and that it was registered and because it was a time when preacher's brother had to add to when they dedicate a child or baptized the child in a church it was a preacher's responsibility to register with the government but it's not that way now I know it's all done through the hospital and so on so the clergy has been omitted and and put out but there was a time when I when I had the I had to go and search this church that he would would through the government for certain individuals amen and I didn't search it for myself because I discovered that the name that I was using it wasn't exactly according to the name that was registered in government a man so I had to go back and get him to change it but again the one of the names was what it was the way that there's the way that the clergy back then understood it and the way that he would spell it and he didn't spell it right a man it was totally different a man so we have we have to change those things but thank God for mother we needed things change regarding the name of our Savior the name of our Lord the name of our bridegroom a man and thank God brother this is one of the reasons why he sent the messenger of the hour amen brother it was it was changing us from church to bright a man and just saying is not the spirit and the church say come the spirit of the bride say come a man that is absolutely tremendous and you're going to the book of Revelation and it explains the bride and and the marriage of the of the the bride to the bright grow by the grace of Almighty God revelation 18 tremendous praise the name of the Lord that we can identify ourselves in Revelation the book of Revelation a male and going beyond the church ages we're going were writing to the bride age by the grace of God the bride uniting with the bridegroom praise the Lord for the revelation and we were more than willing to take his name a man we entered into a relationship with him maybe in different churches but then God brought us under the Ministry of a prophet a man to bring us into a more personal and a more intimate relationship a man and to bear his name and write what is it's a confirmation to that we have an intimate personal relationship there's like Jesus said to the foolish virgin I never knew you they're not lost he's just said what did he mean he didn't know them he had no intimate relationship with them as bride know he's like a bride that's like a bride having an intimate relationship with a bridegroom the bridegroom with his bride a man it's a confirmation or or or capybaras and oh my capping off the the the marriage a man exactly so brother I trust you understand what that is and there's a relationship between a man and a woman and loving they love they love to finally it's it's brought together and it's climaxed a man and after you marry each man is there's an intimate relationship to climax that marriage by the grace of God as someone has said that might have sent myself here yeah that we live in a three-room house you eat in the kitchen fellowship in the living room and he said but he said the the intimate relationship is is dealt with in the bedroom amen by the grace of God your you give yourself to one another by the grace of God and as Jesus gave himself to us we gave him ourselves to him amen and when he says I never knew you he mess what he's referring to I never had no intimate relationship with you amen they had a religious relationship but not an intimate one amen thank God for that revelation so that brother makes sure that like I've wanted to go on into repentance you repent you're baptized just pray that it's absolutely genuine let's pray that God has acknowledged it that God has got us confirm your faith and give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the rapture of the Holy Ghost is God is Christ and the believer entering into a very intimate relationship he's taking control amen by the grace of God praise the name of the Lord but I tell you he hasn't got control of all believers amen but he does have a he's got a control of some but not all I trust he's got control of your life it's a confirmation that your relationship was climaxed a man you entered into that that intimate relationship where he's taken control of you amen and you're giving him control as the woman would yield to the man so thank God for that revelation so the grace of God to our brother byesville as he will give his testimony on Sunday God's grace to be with our brother a man shall be in prayer for him amen so the Lord will turn with me to Revelation 9 no revelation 22 and I'm going to turn it we're going to have a brother minister to us by way of the internet tonight and we're going to hear our brother Danny steamin a man and his sister sister Amber's brother he is our brother in the Lord he's her brother in the Lord and in in her family relationship a man so our brother Danny steamin he's a pastor of a church in Florida so we pray the grace of God to bless us in the going forth of the word as he ministers to us amen let your heart be open to receive what God is going to minister in Revelation chapter 22 and verse 8 and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God I somehow agree with some of the brethren that feel that that this was brother Branham maybe in in a theophany form and he was dealing with John the Baptist's and he was revealing all these things to John amen and John was at the end of it all John was going to worship him he said don't worship Me and I'm just I'm just a prophet he said one of your brothers and so on and he was the prophet to whom all things were revealed a man the end from the beginning amen and it was in this hour and this age the prophet of Malachi for a man that he was given the revelation of the end not just a beginning not just down to a certain age but to the end even going from time to eternity and he said worship God and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at a m-- ii that is unjust let him be unjust still and he was just filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life praise the name of the Lord and may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie love is what is contrary to the word I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches amen and that's what the message of the end time did testified of these things in the churches and he was put out I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and I notice see where Lucy the varieties see what her position is see what her Authority is hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride amen what a relationship brother it comes right to the end where the Providence has informed us that the fullness of the Godhead bodily is now in the bright amen and the spirit and the bride say come amen hallelujah and let him that Aerith say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life that's the word they'd have take the water of life freely priest the name of the Lord thank God that he brought us to that place and we say come drink of the water of life for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book a man is serious either which testify of these things say it surely I come quickly a man even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us would go into here our brother Danny Stephen ministered to us the Word of God the word that we need this have our ears or the ear of the Soul open by the grace of God to hear the word amen god bless you return to our brother Matthew amen we have a nice place let's all stand together amen amen for Samuel 17 verse 32 something about babies this makes everybody smile I said just everybody remember the baby a man a man verse 32 very familiar story and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him my servant will go and fight with this Philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he's a man of war from his youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them I want you to think for a moment about that faith that translates to this day where he has not fought that battle yet but he already knows the outcome if you know the outcome Amen you can speak to that and not to the Giant I mean this is not just a children story this is God showing us how to fight amen and he said amen he shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the Living God notice he never just defied Amen a person he defied God David said moreover the lion that the Lord rather that delivered me out of the pall of the lion and out of the pall of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee and saw arm David with his armour and he put a helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail and David girded his sword upon his armor and he essayed to go for he had not proved it and David said unto Saul I cannot go with these four I have not proved them and David put them off him and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth Stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine amen you can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen I want to draw our attention to what David has said that he is telling of his faith by past experience I'm not so interested a man in in just what we say we believe I'm interested in what you believe produces a men for if what we believe cannot produce control over your own life cannot produce produce something that you have faith in then either it has not been quickened or you're in the wrong thing I think it always would pay for us amen to be established and know that we're established in what we stand for and we're not just social gatherers we're not just coming to church and saying I'm in the message amen but we know what the message is we know what it produces we've seen what God has done in the past we see what he's doing now therefore our faith is not shook Amen by what's in the valley in front of us amen but we know by past experience that God Amen is going to work now and you notice a man excuse me thats all he tries to convince David to take his armor for the battle with Goliath brother branham called it saws theological vest now david has just given a testimony meeting of past experiences with god and of overcoming and yet Amen what God has done in his life and then saw hurt it but it seemed like it didn't even move him it was like okay you did these things and you've had that experience and God was with you but somehow Amen the supernatural never impressed saw enough to say God be with you instead he tried to help him more with his own amen covering a man and so I want to I want to I want to title this this morning the danger of unproven armor the danger of unproven armor remember when faith really hits your heart you don't have to have a spontaneous miracle a man as as we seen so often and in brother Mannis meetings that you see amen that was a faith that was being operated that would challenge the people's humanity and condition that he would speak to them and said if it was me I would get up off of that cot now how many of us would hear that word feel the pain haven't felt the surge of the Holy Ghost yet Amen you feel the weakness you haven't been able to get off the cough you haven't been able to get out of a wheelchair but the word is telling you get up now why is that because I mean there's something that's going to prove your faith and it's not going to be your theology and it's not gonna be your intellect it's gonna be your action towards alert you see God wants to see you act back to what he has already said theologies never impress God amen our understanding our intellect our reason amen has never impressed God aiming but it's our action back to the word is there something in my life answering back to the supernatural is there a supernatural response in my life that responds to the words amen the Prophet said that he saw we were watching a man laying here on a cot he was swelled up in his stomach and I was going to leave and the Holy Spirit called me and I looked and I saw the vision over the man and a moment he responded to it and his stomach went down and off the kadhi went rejoicing through the building he said the people in the stretchers the other night in the wheelchair it doesn't have to happen like that as long as you believe it's going to happen like that you can rejoice just as much as when faith takes ahold saying you have it as you could be if you were running up and down the aisle just like you was out of the wheelchair so now the prophets saying your reaction to the Lord in your condition is just as important as if it's already happened and as we heard Wednesday night that's why it's so important to stay away from a negative attitude negative negativities never fed faith wants Amen through the entire history of the world amen it's never fed your faith it'll never feed your faith so don't think your negativity's going to feed it today it's not going to help you now and it's not going to help you tomorrow and it's not going to help me preach but I'll tell you what will help me preach is no matter what your condition is that you can take the Word of God and say God that applies to me condition he's looking at your faith and when your faith answers back to the word the condition will line up [Applause] God will make your party obey your confession so I asked you what are you confessing you're confessing is not your thinking your thinking is where the battle is your confession is your decision right now the Lord stand with him in this heart I'm not asking if you're in the message I'm asking you have you got into it how's the message got into you here less how well you can put it together it's the life of it that makes you rapture it's a life of it that quickens us and he says here he says you can rejoice just as much as if you're already running out of the wheelchair you see it's a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen you don't have to feel nothing you don't have to taste nothing the only thing you have to do is to believe something and then it becomes a positive something you possess that's your faith I mean how many in here have a temper problem raise your hand and a couple few honest ones and the others have other problems to go with it hey man glory glory hey man but you notice if you allow faith faith if you allow anger to control you there's no way it won't express itself and it'll cause you to do things that down in your heart you say well that's not me that's not the way I am I don't believe like it but it possesses your body and controls it now what will faith do that's controlled by the Holy Ghost you know with anger comes excuses well you know I just I did that because it was so what that's not good enough amen so you cannot you cannot use the circumstance to justify the anger amen but you see if faith takes a hold brother man talk about seeing a man with psychic ability explode a light bulb he said if a man under the control of Devils can do that what can a man under the control of the Holy Ghost what can he do Mountains can be moved children can be saved sick are healed you see brother Danny this is basic message no it's not if you haven't experienced it it's not basic to you you see you know many took the message after 63 and say that's the opening of the world and it is and they say that's what caught the brides attention and so we'll just quote this you know all the miracles never woke the bride up and so we we ignore all the supernatural and we go into a dead formal condition because we don't even know the foundation that he catches your attention first will you see before Moses could ever go into Egypt and throw down that rock he had to meet God in a burning bush he already knew the promises he already knew what Abraham had heard he already knew him in the theology of Exodus towards his people but he had never met the supernatural that would produce it you say you cannot accept it by an intellectual fault that's intellectual your minds will reason but faith doesn't reason if you've got intellectual faith then that's just a reasoning faith you would say well if I was only healed I could get up if I was only healed this lump would leave if I was only healed I would feel different if I was only healed the doctor would tell me so but when you've got faith all the doctors in the world could never tell you anything different you possess it it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen yeah well brother Danny why is this important because I believe that God loves you so much that he doesn't want you to have ups and downs because of a physical problem because discouragement is is Rob's you of strength keeps you from serving God keeps you from doing your reasonable service your reasonable duty your depression all these things that that war against the mind your questions you're wondering what's going on you know God just encourages you even you know just just get close to the supernatural you get close by prayer get close by study don't stand off and wander get close to God and watch what he does he's the dissolver and the answer of every question you don't have to worry about a 10 you don't have to sit here in the sermon say look what is going on with that one eye what is going on with this one get close to him he answers all our doubts he answers all our questions you're not going to get strength out there you're going to get strength in here young men young women you'll never get strength amen by going home and watching a Hollywood movie never get it you can't get it you're not getting from Disney you might not you might see or hear a nice antidote out there in the world say well that's good that applies my situation that helps me that's fine but your strength does not come from that your strength is in the work and Satan will try to sever that lifeline and cause you to put on something unproven do you know why your life is miserable today if it's miserable because you are trying to walk in unproven armor not talking you're understanding the message what your operating and fighting your battles with unproven armor you see David has already said what I've had let's kill the bear and it's killed a lion you didn't have to be there to see it I know what God has done for me brother and sister I'm not preaching to you from what I heard about somebody else I have my own personal experience and I know my redeemer lives blessed be the name of the Lord I know notice you have to accept it you have to believe it you could go down to the altar if you could cry all night long you see a lot of us try to win the sympathy with God God doesn't he's not here to sympathize with you we try to win his sympathy God do you feel sorry about my situation huh he'll come on he's been through the dark ages amen you see we don't win a sympathy we accept his word you have to believe it you could cry all night you could beat up on the author you could scream - you can't scream no more still you're not safe you could feel real good and run all over the building the shout and still not be saved the devil can beat you around on your feelings if I had to go by my feelings every many times I'd be all out of condition but I don't rest on my feelings I rest upon the unconditional word of the Living God who made the covenant with me if I would believe it it's not what I feel it's what I believe Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it faith happens it's far beyond feeling you could feel tonight like your save and run around and praise God in the next morning you wouldn't have any feeling about it at all now let me just let me just tell you this there's many of you many of us we've said in the service amen the Holy Spirit is the xix you feel wonderful you raise your hand you say praise the Lord you go home and that same sickness strikes you again and you turn around and open back the door of discouragement and go right back down by and then pretty soon nobody loves you nobody cares for you I guess I'm always going to be in a in a condition like this but a greater testimony is no matter how long you've been sick no matter how many times things happen to you you maintain a good relationship with the Lord and I don't care it's not about what he's done for me it's about I want to worship Him no matter what many of you only base your worship on him on what he's done for you you're still in a denomination God wants to take it from you what's you I want to worship Him he said the next morning says you'd run around tonight I'm saved tomorrow you wouldn't have any feeling about it and you'd say I'm lost but when faith takes ahold Jesus Christ God's Son died in your stead he became you and your sins and you and yours that you and your sins might become him and his righteousness and accept him as your only perpetuation for sins then faith takes ahold and all Devils out of hell can't move it faith in doors faith locked something faith seal something and if a man has had faith to accept Christ he walks up from the altar he goes outside his associates say you haven't got nothing your eyes are still blue that's the same suit you are in there your nose is just as big as it was when you went in your fingerprints are the same there's no difference but you know there's a difference and in the ages to comment in the days and weeks you'll prove there is a difference because your faith will vindicate you're a Christian how many knows that to be the truth every man and woman that's ever accepted Christ if you can step out and trust your eternal destination upon your faith how much more can you step out with that little body of yours upon the same atonement Amen that he was wounded for your transgressions and with His stripes we are healed usually it takes experience I want to I want to challenge us that if we've had an experience with God before that literally changed your soul then why can't the faith of that same experience operate today in your life change your attitude you know why amen uh-uh okay I'll back up I'm not going to say Amen now Amen now he said usually it takes experience many times we try to educate ourselves into believing that's intellectual there's a far great difference between intellectual faith and real god-sent faith intellectual faith reasons now talk to yourself what kind of faith do I have intellectual faith reasons ain't gonna work if I if I do it that way I got to do it this way and in your way that's proven that it's not proven brother Branham said one time Israel was called out to war against the Philistines of listings had gathered over on one side of the mountain the valley between them Israel on the other side and just like the enemy always does when he feels he's got the upper hand he likes to puff and blow and brag about it when he thinks he can make you cower down if the enemy thinks he can make that heart of yours flutter a few times and make you think you're not healed he likes to do that if he can make you look at your hand and say it's no better he loves to do that cause he's got you conquered right then I said now the reason I put this in here is because I just read this and it really struck me what a challenge of faith he said I see a crutch setting back here by a lady if the devil can make her believe she's going to have to use that crutch to go out of here she's whipped you know we like comfortable faith faith we can manage but when she won't look at that lets you look towards God promise it will be left at the seat say well I've been crippled for years that don't have nothin to do with it it's what God said that's the idea so the idea is now I can as I say that everybody's mind starts thinking about conditions and that's exactly what we're not supposed to do our focus is not condition our focus is the word brother branham set up here at Cato Tabernacle we had a meeting and a crippled boy come in here much prayed for you say brother Danny now we're far beyond this this is this is this is what they label you know we're beyond this somehow we've put intellectual beyond beyond supernatural okay but this is this is the foundational work that God used to catch our attention he said he said now they brought this boy a crippled boy coming here much prayed for him many of you was there to see him and they brought him back in that emergency room and and Billy brought him to me and they had him on the platform for three or four nights in the building he didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the in the the room and I went there and prayed for him and I looked at me says mr. Branum can you give me some consolation can you give me anything and I told him I said son yes sir said yes I said yes her son Polly always got you in this condition he said that's right I said your name is such-and-such and you come from a certain place now the boy had asked for consolation something he could do i how can i know and so what the brother branham do he told him his condition and he told him who he was where he lived so God was telling him I know you yeah I know you and I said and he said that's right I said you come from a certain place he said that's right he said what about my healing and I said I hit stripes you're healed now look what did he do he just quoted the word but he had told him who he was so the Lord was tyno you okay what about my condition by His stripes you're healed you see God's not gonna point you to something different he's gonna always point you to the word I said by His stripes you're healed so he went home testifying and giving up praise and he brought such a reproach in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers came down and set him down and set down by him and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach upon the cause of Christ and the young man said in there and here's the key young man said in there said mister if you were sitting where I am you know it's really easy for you to say something about someone else's condition and you're not sitting there but this man was crippled and he was wanting something from God and when he'd been told he was been that he'd been healed in that wheelchair he just started praising the Lord and he praise the Lord so much that the minister said it's bringing a reproach in the neighborhood so let's talk not about your condition let's talk about your praise because what comes out of your mouth is what God has revealed to you amen and they said you must stop doing they said mister of you were sitting where I am if you were in the chair I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope I have in Christ you see how these ministers are trying to put something unproven on this boy he said by his stripes I'm healed her brother met him said he no more than set that sitting there paralyzed feet hands body back and no more than said that out of the cherry wind giving glory to God oh brother and sister you know what God wants you to do he wants you to believe him whoa brother Danny but what no believe him but brother Danny what about believe him amen What did he say only believe amen turn it around believe Oh amen what did it believe on me well if I turn around to only believe you can't get out of it he wants you to just believe what he said and he went out giving gaurav glorifying God what his natural senses said he would sit there the doctor said he will be there forever are as long as he lives but the faith since the sixth sense said by His stripes I'm healed and it cast everything away contrary to what God said that's what the sixth sense is for now if I was you I wouldn't sit and look at me and ponder what I just said I would react to it I wouldn't give a moment's consideration to the feeling of my body I would say Lord that's right Lord if I don't even feel any different in my body I raised my hand and acknowledge your word takes the preeminence over that King Bishop [Music] [Applause] but I'm seeing a lot of Christians with their heads uncovered no helmet of salvation to cover their mind and if you a men want to believe the devil's lie you have to first take off the helmet of salvation to believe him lay it on the ground and fight with an uncovered head but David said you've covered my head in the day of battle hey man what is your head it's where the mind is it's where the thoughts come into the mutual meeting ground between God and Satan that's where Satan tries to anoint you that's where God sends his word and it's your mouth that gives testimony to what is right let me tell you this I'm not saying this is a nice antidote and I'm not saying this is a nice story and this is not a little editorial in the newspaper this is the truth it works in school amen it works you don't have to be ashamed of what you stand for girls boys you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to let the world push your ideas on you you can make your stand and they have for respect it you know I don't worry ir5 like if I find out that if I I have to I don't say I don't worry I don't say that say but I find out that were in no work it'll work it doesn't give you strength just make you tired does wear you out Saul wanted to call David and armor that David's never worn David would have to put off what he has been using in order to use saws gift the purpose of armor is not just made for protection the purpose of armor has specific purposes instead designed not just to protect because we don't hide behind armor but rather armor equips you to fight better Saul's armor has been worn before when he failed to fully follow the Lord and destroy the Amalekites it's been worn before when he forced a vial on the people that as they were fighting you cannot eat all day long until we have beaten have defeated the enemy and and it calls them amen great problems he's worn that armor before his armor has not been proven the man who wore it was proven to be wrong but refused to repent I just told a while back the problem problem here is that leaders failed to repent failed to admit they're wrong I told that man I am willing to stand in front of the congregation have a meeting about it and if I'm wrong I will submit to correction but I want you there they didn't want to have the meeting listen you don't have to be afraid of the truth I found out it never did me any good to try to base my faith upon rumor it never did me any good to base my faith upon Amen want somebody else thought about it I've been told about this message before and Bill the building was just reiterated to them the other day by disciple of the man amen if you come to this church you have to check your mind in at the door you know I've got to be honest for just a minute I wish some of you would you know in other words you're not intelligent you to believe this message you're just taking a taking a man's word you follow a man and you're not intelligent you don't use your intelligence and all let me just tell you this would you have used your intelligence to follow the Lord Jesus amen when the Lord looked at Peter and says even you gonna go as well he said lord I don't know where else to go you alone have the words of eternal life now I gotta be honest I don't understand what you're saying but I do know this I know God is with you well let me tell you what this message has been proven over and over to work it's been proven to change lives it's been proven to clean you up it's been proven to deliver you it's been proven why it's live prophets message it's God's message I don't have to sit here and worry I mean what's the cloud or rocket or was it angels come on folks we're far beyond reasoning like that [Applause] people say well if brother Branham wasn't underwritten and he's a false prophet you mean angels can't be here and there and there and here these are angels that can come in a split but the most important thing to me is the man that told me that check your brain in at the door that's all you guys do I said why don't we sit down and discuss what you believe by the Bible they don't want to do it they want to go on the questions they want to try to assassinate a man's character come on let's bring it back to the word because amen that's where our feet are shod with the preparation of feet of peace you know what I have peace in my heart because I know I'm standing on something a man that's built upon the rock a min the glob that designed the rapture it's the God that's in this building he designed this message to change your body a meaning to change your body yes to quicken your mind quick in your spirit quick in your heart and then your bodies will also be quickly that's why we preach like this is because you must be quick and inwardly before your ever be changed outwardly it mean that outward change can only follow let me tell you if my spirit is going after the world my body's gonna follow it eventually a man church if I've been all up last night watching TV I'm gonna sleep all through the service this morning amen you're telling on yourself and you have no interest in the Lord of heart but I want you to know I'm interested in what God is for me this morning I'm interested in what he's got to give me from the Word of God I care less what science says about it I don't care what man says about it my eyes are on God and I know what he said about it what did God say about it Gloria why in the world when I want to dial up the devil to think what he thinks about this when the serpent came to Eve you can be sure before he ever got to Eve the devil had sit down and counseled him real good you're anointed for this buddy you're anointed to do this you're anointed to talk to that woman unproven armor Saul's armor was not proven I want to wear what's been proven you know other people maybe some of you are right now fighting with other people's armor on why do you want to put an army armor on of a man who's a quitter why would you put a armor on of a man who don't know how to repent I don't want to wear unproven armor I want to wear armor that's proven hitmen in this show say men that that armor is always supernatural and not carnal Haman dad saw its right arm David with something carnal amen but David said I have not proven this and he put off the Kings sword he put off the Kings armor and he went back to what is defeated amen the enemy before so David took it off he took off what Saul had armed him with you need to take off what you're trying to fight with that's not working brother Danny I'm just going to count on the love of God at the end of my life it's just going to supernaturally change me and I you know I'm living the way I am down yeah you're living a sloppy backslidden life it's not going to work you're going to get worse and you're going to get worse your hearts going to get hard because every time you hear the word and don't respond to it that becomes seared hey men but God wants to come and take away the seared condition make a care in your heart again soften you up in the presence of God where he can begin to speak to you and all of a sudden all things are possible [Applause] you know what I want for you in this church I want you to be happy in the Lord I asked a man the other day who is giving it to me I said and I said so I said buddy why are you rejoicing in somebody's fallen condition you think I get joy out of a falling condition you think I get joy out of somebody's trial no but I want you to know if a bear is come in or if a line has come in there has been proving something to where what will win today brother and sister the thing that's always worth the blood shall never ever lose its power how dare you question the blood of Jesus Christ if it can cover you it can cover your brother try the enemy out pick up the sword of the Spirit I'm gonna begin to fight the battle you've been ordained to win David took them off you have to renounce Saul's armor you have to say it's wrong imagine how how foolish it looked to put off a king's armor and to walk out in the Shepherd's tunic with only a sling takes courage to stand up on the truth it's gonna take courage for you to stand up on the truth there's giants in those days you know brother Bantam looked at that and it's it's a saint it's a giant what was carnal then now spiritually in front of us he called it these intellectual giants like Goliath intellectual Giants like Goliath that's what we're facing you know what really struck me in the hour that we have men telling us it meant not to preach the word and not to do this and not to do that and that Paul told a young man by the name of Timothy Paul told him to stay in Ephesus I'm asking you to abide here while I go to Macedonia I want you to stay here that you might charge them in if Ephesus to teach no other doctrine he never told him now Timothy I just want you to read to them my letters he's telling I charge you to tell them quit teaching another doctrine other than what I have already talked [Music] then he told him don't give heed to fables and endless genealogies which Minister questions you see a man even in Ephesus where the word had been taught in its meat now they begin to bring in more revelation that begin to minister questions to the people's hearts the word should not Minister questions it should minister answers I a man should not have received a prophets message and my heart has been turned by it and all of a sudden wondered was that the right message I didn't believe it the right way now I got a look at it all over again there's no fear and believing the truth I mean the truth does not Minister fear the truth does not minister questions the truth amen dissolves it there's a giant standing in our way the giant of intellectualism there's a giant standing in the way of our young people of sensuality the lure and the attraction of the world it's a giant that's so persuasive that young people amen we'll get up and leave and walk out of the supernatural seeing what God has done and go right back to the world because it's a giant there's a giant a worldliness stands in the way of people you know you know the way to get around this giant that I'm talking about and just leave him there attack me tell David tell David he's a naughty boy why are you wanting to go defeat that giant attack the word is trying amen to tell you it's wrong why does resentment rise up in your heart and quietness settle on the congregation because you know these are giants these are giants that stand in the way the more I preach it the more you buy your head the more you get quiet the more you look away amen the enemies upon you amen but you are David ordained to fight David knew he was anointed David knew he was a good shot David knew he'd been vindicated [Music] there's the domineering power of fashion man that comes in upon the people and they men they begin to drift and get closer and closer to the world don't give the devil the opportunity to paralyze your faith amen there's the giant of so-called public opinion some of us are living our life based upon the opinion of somebody else hey man the giant of public opinion amen the giant of indifference to a higher call a man a giant of unbelief these are giants and God wants men to meet them men and the men that meet him are men who are to be champions a men that bring with them genuine first realized truth what good is it to fight a battle with something you're not sure it'll work glory I mean God wants people who not amen not only can speak of what they know but have proof of what they know who can not only repeat but they can testify notice david has given the king's armor he's given a king sword but this King was a man afflicted with an evil spirit a man anointed by an evil spirit trying to convince David to fight with what he fights with amen Saul's leadership abilities did not meet the expectation created by his appearance because he was impulsive by Nature you know Satan studies your nature and he knows he knows your nature better than you know yourself and he knows what doors to open in order for you to follow your nature instead of follow the call of God and if you don't shut that door and tell the devil he's a liar your walk right through it and you find out that door closing a lot behind you and it's a lot harder to get back through it than it is to walk into it [Applause] see that's why the Bible said the wages of sin are death but it don't start out looking that way it's called the pleasure for a season amen so what did saw allowed his nature to overstep the bounds that God had given him he allowed jealousy to overcome him so he tried to kill David specifically amen that's a lessons from Saul's life God wants obedience from the heart not mere acts of religious ritual obedience church coming can be ritual religious obedience it should be the house of correction it should be judgment begins at the house of the Lord it should be where we wash ourselves they're all not to be an auth in your heart that you're sitting here when you're down stopping what you're here and preaching you know some of us are hearing other word has become so limited and so small we only hear a few things slip through and it never benefits you God wants this to abundantly amen bless you he wants it to abundantly free you but you would have life and have it more abundantly amen Saul made sacrifice but sacrifice is not always obedient God wants to make use of our strengths and he wants to make use of our weaknesses rather Danny what good is my weaknesses here's what's good about weakness yeah anybody know any of you young men no you got there you know what's good about weakness he's trying he felt what did you feel like you're on the spot yeah he bless his heart come on how about you young man hey good to see you buddy was that you that knocked on the door that must be why you didn't open it you're supposed to open it hey man hey man so what's good about our weaknesses what is good about your weakness that's true amen it's a good answer and you know what reliance is you feel like you pass the test learn put an A on his paper hey man you know what you weakness do it makes us remember our need for God weakness gives us humility which is a needed element in our lives weakness helps us to empathize with somebody else in prayer [Applause] so in the week say they're strong it's saying I'm strong in the Lord praise the Lord they should help us remember our need when Saul had success his greatest success in the Bible came when he obeyed God his greatest failures resulted when he acted on his own Saul had all the materials he needed to be a good leader he had a parents he had courage he had action and God could have used his weaknesses if Saul had recognized them and left them in God's hands have you ever asked God to take something away and he never took it away well then it was obviously the weakness of your faith God take us away I'm not talking about immorality I'm not talking about uncleanness no about weakness you know maybe your weaknesses you tend toward negativity that's that's that's and I'm not not trying to speak against your character that's actually in nature amen and then there's other people that you know are always you know have you ever met the person that's always too happy well there is a time to cry you know I'd hate to have a doctor at my bedside you're going to die yeah it wouldn't be good bedside manners how wouldn't with that guy praying for me Oh God this guy you know you see there's a time yes and so but if you don't recognize maybe you have a weakness called anger amen only two people said yeah yeah anger is just a step away from insanity do you see what anger will do when it's anointed by drugs it'll go kill five people and shoot 20 more see what anger will do when it's anointed by a circumstance it'll speak against its brother anger is the opposite of discernment and don't dis quote the scripture to me about being angry and sin not because there is a righteous anger that we have to use and don't tell me your anger is always so righteous that you actually started cussing or something that's not righteous anger that's your anger don't tell me your anger was so righteous that it ran your brother down that's your anger don't tell me that it was the right anger that made you look like a fool and then you had to go pass a track about what you believed let me tell you if your anger is right try to give somebody let's just take the track the original sin and why you're angry try to give it to somebody be a witness of what you believe now I can tell you how you do it you take this book because in it tells you exactly who you are that's anger hallelujah weakness God can use our weakness but his own choices caught him off from God and then an alienated him from his own people have you ever prayed and asked God for something you wanted God to bless your family but the blessing was hindered by you what you prayed for is hindered by your own nature hallelujah man from Saul we learn that our strengths and our abilities will make us useful but it's our weakness that'll make us usable God will use your weakness our skill and our talent which we like to highlight make us tools but our failures and shortcomings remind us we need somebody in control I wanted to say this what you accomplished on your own is only a hint of what God can do you know you talk about our own ability and I I've got ability I can do this and I got ability in this area I got ability and you gotta be honest every one of you in here has a little bit of pride of what and what you can do right you got a little bit of pride you know I'm good maybe maybe you're good with math maybe you're good with English maybe you're good with this maybe you're good with languages maybe you're good with that or that or whatever you a little bit of maybe you're just proud in your weaknesses I don't know I'm proud I'm the weakest guy in this church and I don't have an ounce of ability I can't do anything I just I'm down all the time and I'm depressed I'm part of that what are you gonna do my buddy okay what I'm gonna do hey man well hallelujah I tell this story all over again here we only got one service a day brother Allen has actually said let's remember the service today and this evening but I like to tell this story because I was there and not because I was there but because I experienced it and and I've told it many times but I when I was in South Africa years ago and we went we was going to go up in the bush but before we did we had a house meeting and and these brothers come in they were brother how many remember Brian Jones you know me remember brother Brian Jones runs a rehab center there not far from the the the Kruger National Park and it's a world-renowned facility for animals and so we had a house meeting there on his grounds and there was men had come in and they had working off the coast up in northern Africa on some of the oil rigs and stuff and I mean he's a real man big strapping South African six five burly strong and we're going to go what they call sleep with the Predators which is the last part of a Ranger course that they have is where they take you in the bush and you can't buy a water hole or something and they drag an animal a dead animal around camp for the scent and try to draw in the lions hyenas and whatever predator will come in and you're there on the ground sleeping or watching and you get to experience that I saw pictures that he had of lions sniffing the feet of people in their sleeping bag so this is what we were going to experience and so anyway they had these these men there was going to be brother Brian and then myself and another minister we was going to be in another truck so that's two trucks and then the back truck was going to carry like four men and all these men were the ones that had been working up on the rigs and their lease trapping these big South Africans so they have this this mentality of their Bushmen you know they're strong and and and so we had the meeting and then we got to talk about where we're gonna go out camping and we're gonna do this and I never forget it and this man is talking to me said yeah he said I've been in the bush before and he says when I go I usually wear you know big knife on my hip and a gun and and so forth it says they call me ramble so that's good you know you know it's a it's intimidating to talk to Rambo you know and I mean he's just a stern stolid guys you know you're you know it's easy it's easy to say these things in a house meeting it's easy to say man in church okay so so we got done talk on his Rambo and in and on so we're gonna pack up after the service and we're gonna we're gonna go and so brother Brian he gathers us around he says not listen he says we're gonna be in the bush he says on the trail he says if I stop you stop he said I go you go you do whatever I do now notice the guide is telling us if I move you move you have to copy my actions so amen we're driving were we're in the middle of nowhere okay we're on a two-track driving through these through the bush and trees we come around the curve now so it's it's brother Brian in the first truck and then and he has in the back of the truck he's got half a zebra and all the equipment he needs to drag this thing around the water hole and then myself in a minute other administer in the next pickup in the back pickup is two men in the cab and two men sitting in the open air in the back and these were like little you know Nissan pickups or something they want these big old Chevrolet's a man and and so these little pickups and Rambo was sitting in the back now he had a big old knife so he's equipped right he's ready do we come around the curve and the next thing we know we're in the herd of elephants this isn't the zoo this isn't the house meeting and this is not him telling me I'm Rambo so they're coming across the track let me tell you these are not the elephants in the in the bush is not the elephants in the zoo okay it's a lot different and so they're milling around and and and an opening comes up and by the brian guns it and and the minister driving our truck he guns it and but the other truck just eases up real slow too and and they instead of following the way they should have they went real slow in the gap closed and the and the elephants closed and blocked the way and so now all them elephants we went up drove up went around the corner and out of sight and stopped brother brian got out and he sits there like it's for a while and you could hear these elephants trumpeting you could hear trees cracking and and he go he slapped his hand on the roof and he says I told them boys to stay with me thankfully they had Rambo so we they eventually we went and they they caught up with us and and they weren't dead they caught up and we got to the camp with him guys climbed out it was a different man that I had talked to in the house meeting it was not come on you know they called me Rambo and I heard her hey hey he was real quiet he sat down on this chair and he looked at me he goes it was very skinny very quiet everything was taken from him what we had been told the instructions we were given brother Brian took that tied a rope to that zebra and he drug it around the camp and around the water hole and so the scent would get out there and then he told us he said now what we're going to do is we're going to take watches through the night he says two men to a watch hour and a half per watch and so there was and he said I'm going to sleep so it was us and the other four brothers so that was three watches that we supposed to have in meantime the sun's starting to set we watched giraffe come down how they laid himself out to get a drink and you walk you saw snakes we saw other animals but were there for the Predators and he's already drawn it around okay so we're all we're all supposed to take her watch myself in the other minister we're going to do I think it was the first watch so it had been I don't know if we started 11 or whatever it was it's going to be 11:00 to 2:00 12:30 or if we started at 12:00 is going to be to 1:30 whatever it was so we're there we're taking our watch no watch was you know once in a while you shine a light so you know you the predators you don't actually sleep with them it's not recommended you know hey I'm sniffed but don't let him sleep hey man and so we we did our thing well the other guys you Rambo and the other guys that are going to take their watch they never sleep the entire time they're going like this all right shot they never sleep they were scared so then we we laid on the ground to go to sleep and you could hear the Lions you can hear the prides roaring off in the distance and all that and where they get okay maybe eventually we're gonna get woke up and hey they're here you know they're and well these guys they're like this they'll entire time we slept we woke up and and Rambo told me he said hey while you slept we watched a red Roman a red Roman is not a spider but it looks like a spider they look like huge tarantulas about like this big he said we watched him crawl right towards you and I think he he'd crawl and we looked and sure enough you could see the tracks came right to here and went back so the thing crawled all over me so then I'm thinking okay Rambo you watch this thing you know what kind of test point is that I saw you you had a red Roman on you ha ha ha I don't want you backing me up I don't care how big your knife is I don't care how nice your armor is you have not been proven I want somebody who's been there somebody knows what it's like somebody that can fight with you I figured out you know you can testify all you want in the house meeting but when you get out there and you hear the lines and you see the elephants and you hear the noise and you feel the fear it's very scary hey man Church we have been called to be afraid well I found out that their fear ruined the whole experience you know fear will ruin a good church service for you we went on a walk the next morning we could see where the hyenas had come in but they wouldn't come in all the way because there's guys constantly like it is hey man you want a good gospel experience get rid of the fear get rid of unproven armor David said I've never proven that they showed me another video I hope you don't mind I'll close here in a minute but it showed me another video of another man and whom I've met and and you know it's exciting you're in the bush this isn't the zoo you name that some old tired animal just walking around and snuffling its food that's been laid there and you know some cleaner coming behind them and hey the feedings it too you know they're saying something like these are it's just a real deal and they showed me a video of one of those sleeping with the Predators a and they kept the they kept the zebra tied to the Jeep and he's out maybe 100 feet laying out there and they got it tied to the Jeep so these guys are out there and there's some big old guns on their hips and the big old knee boots and I mean it you know it's exciting cuz you're going to go out there you want to look the deal like brother branham you know when he wanted to say he was a rider and he he put on the Arizona chaps and the big old hat and he set on the fence with everybody else until he saw that horse and the horse begins to buck can knock the guy off and he said the ambulance has got the man he said the riders got the horse and then the owner come up and down I'll give any man $500 who can stay on him six seconds or whatever and he looked right at brother BAM said oh you a rider he says no sir you see the real deal will change your mind it's easy to float along and think you're doing the right thing and think it's that but when you get in the mess and you get into trouble and everything is going on what are you then what do you have to meet the chat champion and the giant the lion come in you should have heard him guys that lion got ahold big old black mane line got ahold of that zebra and it and it got angry because it couldn't take that zebra with it it was tied to the Jeep and it picked it up in its mouth and that the guy that was all dressed up and looked the deal he jumped up fell off from the campfire and jumped up on the top of the the Jeep up on the roof up on the top and he's up there and that thing was sitting there that and that that lion took that zebra and begin to back up and he begin to pull the Jeep you better be careful what you climb into you hear these guys talking about Fort Concho they're all getting excited you know this this is sleeping with predators and thing got angry and it just one twist of its neck snapped that animal in half and walked off with half of it you see the giant you face a men is more than your mouth more than your minds more than sitting in your easy chair say hey that guy's doing the wrong thing it's actually participating it's actually doing something entering your prayers into the event entering your energy into the church energy and putting yourself into the body and edifying it what do we have hey will brother Danny I sure glad I'm not in Africa well let me tell you what but the devil goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour praise the name of the Lord brother Branham says amen well let me just say we say this first before say what brother Branham says they're not close and we can maybe pick it up at another time whatever we accomplished on our own is only a hint of what God can do you know why when brother BAM spoke about the third pole the opening of the word what is the opening what does opening mean to you every time God opens something it brings life brings life brings light and he talked he said I had my hands up praising the Lord that's why it's good to raise your hands up praise the Lord didn't have feeble hands hanging down on his knees he had his hands up praising the Lord and sabino canyon something struck his hand and he said he looked at it he said it was a sword and I said it's a king short and said avoid spooking he says not a king it's the king the king he said then if it's the king sword it's the the sword of the king is the word the Lord has put the word in your hand see the God doesn't argue a man with nothing he armed you with his word and what you accomplish on your own ability is only a hint of what God can do so I'll say this when we're weak and we don't realize it we feel that void with pride and that's the worst combination a week and a proud person but when you're weak and realize it brother Ram said there's so many of us like to testify or think that were insufficient and we make an excuse I have no education I have no ability I'm unable to do this he said if you keep that up and do that in that way if you keep going like that you will amount to nothing but the very thing we make excuses for our weaknesses God uses that very thing to tackle the job with he waits for us to get to that condition so he can use you glory we take the excuses and say I can't do it I'm insufficient I can't do it and God takes that very thing to do the job with that is true I love that because then what does that do to this poor weak person all because I know then that it wasn't me that done it but it was God that done it and I know that if it was God that done it it's gonna be God that keeps on doing it I never saved myself he saved me he'll save my children amen let's all stand together this should be the name of the Lord so don't go out and say I'm tremble go out and say I'm a son and daughter of God I don't want to be patterned after a television star amen I find my identity in here then I can fight Haman David don't arm yourself and don't put on unproven armor put on what's been proven I know I never scratch the surface of it this morning but don't put on something unproven amen when when God our excuse me Paul told Timothy young man he told him you stay there in Ephesus and you tell them not to teach these genealogies in these fables but to stay with what you've already been taught a man he armed him with the word and God has armed us stay with the word I believe every son and daughter of God anointed of the Holy Spirit has something in their heart that can recognize can recognize when Satan's trying to do something I mean if we can't let's ask him to help us to do it say Lord amen I'm gonna put on what's been proven cover myself with what's been proven and stay right behind me Heavenly Father thank you for this day that you have given us as David said this is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it I pray your arm your people may they go out of here armed with the Word of God I would not say they're not armed they have been armed but may they not forget what they armed with brother venom said in the greatest battle he said Satan if he can get you to lay down that sword he's got you right there he said if he can get you amen to believe that your weapon is only equivalent to what Satan is trying to do to you it's not stronger amen in the situation than Satan's got you right there Amen but we know Amen we've been equipped a man with the Word of God we've been equipped with the supernatural power of God that equips every believer Lord then let us not lean to the arm of the flesh let us not lean to our own understanding let us lean upon yours Lord you know the way through the wilderness all we have to do is follow Amen then father we thank you for that you said in your word that your sheep know your voice Amen and another they're not follow I pray this morning Amen that you're strengthened every heart Amen may the sick among us say they are healed and rejoice in it Lord rejoice Lord for that rejoicing in itself works against the symptom Satan tries to anoint their mind with Oh God maybe he'll then firm mine may you heal the fear that's in the mind drive it away may they not Amen put trust in their own abilities and their own way they handle things may they put trust in you we Lord submit ourselves to your leadership thank you father for being with us today heal the sick encourage each one filled with the holy spirit again we ask in Jesus name Amen praise the name of the Lord and God bless our brother amen it is a challenge to our faith amen and again thank the Lord I trusted that God has spoken to our hearts and our souls amen to chant it to make sure to make our call the election short is to make sure we have faith and that it is spiritual and not intellectual and our brother was right in bringing out this side and that side this side of that side because no matter what God does the enemy is there to do this amen no matter what God says the enemy is there to add a word or take away a word yet God said yeah if God said and so on so brother I pray the grace of God then we're going to stay with my god said we're not going to reason with the devil we're not going to add to it we're not going to take away from it by the grace of God and as he said right here we had to stay away from negative attitudes what because that challenge is your faith that questions your faith negative attitudes and where does that come from that comes from the devil amen oh it's a you know in our natural flesh yet it is but they Satan that highlights it it's saying that where he's working on and he knows he knows what's in your flesh he knows the weakness that's there he knows what he what he needs to use in you he nobody needs to use in me and again well we're all different when it comes to that because you've got this weakness somebody else got that weakness and that weakness you know us Satan knows he definitely knows so whatever your weakness is that's what the enemy is going to use what for the Challenger faith he's going to use it to weaken your faith he's going to use it to get us out of the spiritual and into the intellectual or into into the into the physical or into the religious whatever but brother has got to be spiritual as spiritual is the Holy Ghost amen it again it is Christ in me the hope of glory by the grace of God so brother make sure it's Christ in us make sure it's the word in us and make sure it's not the devil a man so whatever that that you feel led to do and again brother were sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God amen we would we live in the spirit we walk in the spirit so matter what it is so everyday sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God in every every circumstance in every situation led by the spirit a man again not me that lives Christ that living them is it is it Christ at you in in your home it is Christ to you in your job you mean to tell me as action actually that Jesus is doing that work but he's using you to do it oh yeah if there's no way there's not one thing if you're born truly sincerely honestly born again there's nothing you do yourself it's you live you it's his choices it's his assistance it's this knowledge is this wisdom it's his leadership a man again boy because it's not me that lives this Christ to live within me I pray God that then what we have heard tonight will gel challenge us in all that we experience it would challenge us in all that we do amen as the sons and daughters of God are we led by the Spirit of God as sons and daughters of God are we controlled by the Spirit of God amen not the devil not feelings but faith amen what is your faith producing our brother brought this out is it the results of the mental faith or is it the results of a spiritual faith amen and again in a message that I was I lady there in the last service than the service before the public God brings it out and he challenging even even Brenham tabernacle why because he felt that UE said you got a mental but not a spiritual faith even random tabernacle so where does mental faith come from it is the devil it is not God no no it is Satan is working on working in our flesh and he's taking what God gives us in the spirit and I put it putting it into our minds and into our flesh and helping and getting us to understand oh this is your faith this is faith this is faith oh that's your faith now faith that comes right back to the word the whole truth nothing but the truth amen so brother what is your faith producing is it mental faith or spiritual faith a man it's good but the thing but the the thing it is can you answer the question and can you answer it sincerely and honestly amen the devil's get you is there to get you to lie like Eve yeah when when Adam was challenging Eve oh no she said but she said this is good for this good for this good for that and well I told you that's mental faith that's right not spiritual so I pray God that we're going to be sincere and honest before God regarding the faith that we say that we have let's make sure it's spiritual and if it's spiritual it just gives God the preeminence Lord not me it's you what is it what is your will what is it you want me to do lord grace amen so brother sister let's make sure that we are living in the spirit walking to the spirit controlled by the Holy Spirit not the Holy Spirit and remember again the prophet of God warned us concerning their that Jesus and the devil he said our twins in the same church oh yeah one is Christ the other is Antichrist a man but they're twins in the same church so brother God have mercy God help us to be more sincere and more honest with God remember everything is coming down to the challenge of our faith everything is coming to that place a man and it's going to it's going to manifest and reveal our faith it's going to prove whether it's spiritual or whether it's intellectual and again as I said the Prophet brought it out and he really put a hard emphasis on it he said the trouble today his people he said got too much mental faith and not spiritual a man it's all in their heads but not in their hearts if it's in your heart it controls you yeah morning noon and night it controls you thought word and deed and you're led by the Spirit of God amen if it's in your head you're led by this you can be led by the spirit the devil and remember he's so close so close so close it would deceive the very elect oh well I won't be deceive no because you think you because of your knowledge you won't be deceived or it can't be your feelings st. no use your feelings snake me use your reasoning no you're gonna cast it down what what well your faith constant well I believe this I believe this that no way comes down to it is written thus saith the Lord no question no feelings no no what do you live in my well it's written and again there are a brother bottle doubt concerning humility but you went you're going to have that almost spirit amen I pulled it from the from the message on on humility that the Prophet preached and you have to humble yourself and brother all the sons and daughters of God are humble they're not there to push that lift themselves up to Allah and you exalt themselves or oh I'm this and I'm that I'm gonna do this y'all we think we're doing this dude this old God's gotta be pleased no what pleases God is your humility yeah oh yeah there are those that that will do this will do that but yet they don't have the the love of God oh yeah God's not there to to think God is not pleased no see you if you want to play please go on oh well I gotta do this I gotta do this to please God yeah but you got to do with a right attitude you got to have a right spirit you got to have a right motive you got to have a right objective it's got to be God in you doing it not you based on your knowledge based on your feelings based on your understanding no it's got to be God in you you're led by the Holy Spirit well he's right your brother really brought it out then what you do it's got to be the God in you and what you do it's got to be a right attitude on the right spirit a man by the grace of God it is the danger as he preached of unproven armor yeah it's got to be proven by the grace of God it might work for Saul but it would it would work for David no not by any means David was going by faith amen and yeah and faith now that's something else - we're going David and Goliath how do you know he's gone by faith when he went when he went to fight Goliath he talked about the lion and the bear and so on but when he when he when he challenged when to challenge Daliah what did he highlight to the Israeli soldiers what did he eye light - Saul the King it was a spiritual revelation that they never considered just saying all these Israeli soldiers and the end and all my those in charge never considered just think they were Israelis they were Jew but they were afraid of Goliath what afraid of Goliath all them soldiers yeah and here comes this young man David just a shepherd boy and he said Goliath you know he said you're you what's going on here he said when he came to and to meet his brothers there and to give them the food and so on and and he noticed they were all there and and there's just this one man there he said what's going on oh yeah he's challenging us that if we if we defeat him then you know that all the others are going to submit to us and he said what are you afraid of nobody going down there and I guess the most of all laughing at David that maybe others were criticizing David pretty girl of David putting him down yeah what was there why because of his faith faith no gave it listen David even though y'all did you God get delivered the lion God delivered to bear to you and all that but this is this is Goliath you know any and he sees he's so he's over nine nine feet I think it was over nine feet tall and David David was just a young boy maybe not fully grown yet and he said but he wasn't afraid of him well the King thought well no well maybe he was just for his conscience sake what David I'll give you the issue you take my armor and go down and fight and if you're gonna do that and they just tried it on that didn't work there's no way he said not used to this he just threw it off and what did he do he went down to the river and he picked up five stones grace yeah but where was his faith his faith was in the promise of God to the Jews and it was in the token of the Covenant she was shunned order is the patent the latest the token you mean to tell me all those Jews never recognized that Goliath never had the token and yet here comes this young boy this shepherd boy whom they consider to be stupid no one did didn't know anything and then you know they didn't consider him to be big or important and there he had no fear whatsoever just thinking that he had no fear all the others were fearful frightened to death of July where David come you see what's going on he was so relaxed and I've been asking questions just the last few days Chris Ernie fasting no he got a pass you got a fast and there are those that see oh you've got a fast well probably God didn't he said well probably God only fast I think it's three days the most but I think he fasted less and less as he came to the end of his ministry and all he got a fast you got a fast no David didn't fast and kill the lion he didn't fast and killed a bear and he did know he know he didn't had the fast and killed in fact he would bring a food and that thinks to his to his brothers and to kill Goliath know what ye means because what was the token circumcision physical fleshly circumcision the Jews added but Goliath never added and he challenged them based on that on the token he said why are you so fearful of this uncircumcised Philistine was that God doing it was the Covenant the token of the Covenant and he doesn't have it therefore God is not with him cause not going to defend him God is going to give us the victory over him what faith what faith God airp us that we'd have that faith they've got no question that faith they got no doubt and and made all the Israel maybe was frightened to death and they were nervous Oh old David Oh David oh don't do that don't do that you know you don't have to do it you know he wasn't nervous he wasn't afraid he just went down with his slingshot picked up the five stones and he said go at he said God's going to deliver you into my hands he was going to cut his head off yeah they were afraid he's gonna cut David say Oh No David was gonna do it to him yeah why David knew God was with him because he was in the Covenant and he had the circumcision he had the token of the Covenant amen amen do we have the token of the Covenant of our Lord Jesus Christ the life of his blood in us if you got the token in your heart in your soul you got you are more than a copper David was more than a conquerer they were all behind him but here he was Davis conqueror was in his heart in his soul the anointing was with David praise the name of the Lord I pray please in the name of God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ please let's have that faith that spiritual faith that has no question no doubt whatsoever our president brought it out he said you would you think this and that but it there's not faith you're thinking that but it's not that you feel this you feel that but no faith got nothing to do with that faith just believes God get please just trust the Lord believes the word it yeah it is written and they again don't doubt God help us just there's hardly a day but we'll go by what we need it is written but we need thus saith the Lord that's how we that's why we defeat the enemy shall we conquer the enemy I so we get the victory but you say it is written and you don't doubt it you don't question it it's so saith the Lord it's finished get thee behind me Satan amen because again that's what Jesus did that's exactly he gave us when he when he was conquered when he was challenged by Satan he just said it's written it's written it's written hey man but brother but you got to believe it and not doubt it hey man now I tell you the devil knows whether or not you're gonna doubt it the devil knows whether or not you really believe it oh he knows so I pray God that we have really true Holy Ghost faith rather you ask the question what is the giant in your life Goliath the giant and David's life but David with the giant in July is life David copper Goliath a man brother it is not theology when it comes to the Word of God but it is a supernatural response to the word mister were to to to many believers the messages theology but to the Holy Ghost believer of the bride it is a spiritual revelation oh my grace of God to stay away from negative attitudes grace of God amen to make sure that we have a spiritual faith that has no reasoning intellectual faith reasons but spiritual faith believes no reasoning it is written period a man thus saith the Lord period you're not going to argue with the devil on it you don't have to yeah he she allowed the devil say this and she and she and she Toya she went into reasoning but faith doesn't reason face stays with the word Amen so brother spiritual faith is as no reasoning so it is written period you know you don't question it thus saith the Lord carry it you don't question it you just go on believing it by the grace of Almighty God amen don't put intellectual beyond the spiritual amen there's other things I had written here but we'll leave it amen I pray the grace of God that what the Lord ministered through our brother tonight will feed our souls amen yeah we will become will become the word in flesh by the grace of God amen let's say hold the fort for I am coming Jesus signal still sir brother let's not be guilty of in complete obedience because the Bible highlights in complete obedience what does it lead to it leads to confusion civil and religious confusion in our lives so let's be completely you know being to the will of God doing the will of God living for God loving God loving the Lord any and the word by the grace of God to God be the glory brother Amen let's give God the glory this stand saying one foot or hold the fort oh my comrades see the signal
