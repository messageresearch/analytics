evening lord we want to thank you for your goodness lord we want to thank you for your provision for your safe keeping lord for your patience with us lord your long suffering lord we're thankful for your mercies that are new every morning heavenly father and lord we've come in just to be refreshed in your presence lord but lord hopefully our praises have refreshed you this evening lord that it's been a pleasing thing for you heavenly father and so now we invite you to just speak to us lord may you just touch each heart and so lord may you look into each life lord you know the needs that i don't but lord if your holy spirit can open up that little door lord we know that that person can be changed lord that my life can be changed or that that area of my life can be changed the lord will want a changing god here tonight lord we want a god that makes a difference we want a god that's alive and well within us we pray lord so just have your way in this service lord there's many lord of wade tonight lord remembering the colombo and the katuka family especially lord sick at home tonight lord we pray your ministering grace and your healing touch to them lord for the collins family as well we pray lord god may you just be with them we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen thank you musicians and god bless you if you'll turn your scriptures to first john chapter four and we'll start in verse 18. and then certainly appreciate sister kimberly and brother paul singing that special i kind of put them on the spot and asked them to do it and they were gracious enough to do it so i certainly appreciate it that's uh that song's a prayer amen amen that he would devastate us with his presence that there be nothing left of us and only him that would be left amen that he would saturate us amen that he would draw us closer to him amen first john 14 4 verse 18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love god whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also amen god bless you can have your seats may bless the reading of his word we spoke on uh last service on this this uh theme of projecting love and expressing grace and i want to just wrap it up hopefully in a a nice tight little package here this evening and maybe last time we spoke more a bit on what you have to do and then we talked about the the things that are required of a believer to show that love and it was maybe a bit more on the on the telling you what to do but this service we want to get down to the cause and effect now and we want to see what happens when you do what we talked about in that last service when you when you show that love when you have that love the kind of effect it has not only on you and your life and your family and those close to you but also those that you come in contact whether it's human whether it's animal whether it's nature and all these different things we know that the love of god is is going to have an effect and i stopped at verse 17 so we could start on verse 18 the service because honestly you could preach an entire service just on verse 18 that perfect love casteth out all fear but we're going to go into it and we're going to cover it from a different couple different angles this evening and then we'll move on to the grace side as well but that scripture again says there is no fear and love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love and i want to touch this like i said from from from multiple angles and i want to start with the individual level because you can't give this if you don't have it you can't share with somebody if you haven't experienced it for yourself you can't give what you don't have inside of you so we want to bring this down this portion of perfect love casts out fear to each and every one of us this morning and brother branham would say a man that walks in love walks in life and perfect love casteth out all fear then if you can take him at his word and not fear a bit about it say lord i love you i know you're going to answer because you promised me you would and i just know you're going to do it see and it takes away all fear notice he says a man that walks in love walks in life and for the believer the word of god is life amen he can walk in the word of god without fear because he says lord i love you and i know because i love you i can't love you unless you love me first and that means that you're going to do what you promised you would by your word for my life amen then he would say as long as you're doing what he says do and you know you're directly led well then there's nothing to fear perfect love casts out all fear so there's no fear in god love takes away all fear amen so you have to be led you have to be led to cast out that fear you have to know that god is with you to cast out that fear so you've got to be sure you're led and the first thing you want to do if you're if you're seeking leadership is you check it with the word so often you know what people do is we go to prayer you don't need to go to prayer you need to go to the word first because don't waste your time praying for something that he hasn't promised in his word don't waste your time praying for something that he says don't do in your in his word amen go to the word and see if it lines up with his word and then you go to prayer and say lord your word says i should do it your word says i can do it now what would you have me to do and then you want to be confident that you're where you are and doing what you you're doing because he led you there amen that's what you want to do brother branham would say that he said i have to know that i'm where i am i'm where i'm supposed to be so that i know that god's with me to do whatever i face when i come up to that pulpit and where he goes to these meetings and that minister doesn't just accept any any invitation that he had especially when you're a prophet you've got hundreds maybe thousands of it he says i've got to know that god led me where i'm going so that when i get there anything that i need him to do he'll do for me because he sent me there in the first place he also says god is love perfect love but you don't know what love is that's why today people don't know what faith is he says god is love he has to be in love he's sovereign to his word and he has to keep his word he has to love you and if he loves you he's got to protect you notice he says he has to keep his word he has to love you how does he love you by keeping his word amen he proves his love to you by keeping his word to you personally as an individual amen that's how you can have faith is because he loves you he's going to act through his word to do what he told you he's going to do why because we tend to lose faith when we lose sight that god loves us and then often what happens is we say well this isn't going to happen because what you forget that god has called you he has changed you has placed you where you are and we start to get unsure of that we start to question our experience with god we start to question do we have the holy ghost and all of a sudden we start to doubt his word and it goes back to the very fact that we've forgotten that he loves us above all else he loved us and that's why we responded to him and that's why we love him and that's why we can appreciate his word and that's why we can accept his word is because he loved us but we get these little situations come up in his life in our life and something doesn't quite go the way we thought it should and we say well maybe his word isn't for me you've forgotten above all that he loves you you've forgotten that he's for you he's not against you that he wants to pour out every blessing he can on you and yet you let the circumstances rise up and you say well maybe it's not for me and we've forgotten first and foremost that everything he does is for our good even when we don't realize it you know selena was supposed to have a driving test yesterday and we did everything right we booked it right we made sure she had her license done right we did the lessons we we were there on time we did everything right and yet when she got there they said your license isn't right because they'd forgotten to transfer her license from british columbia now my natural reaction was not you know my natural reaction was anger right because i i forgot that all things work for good after just preaching it just how many times have i said it in the last couple of services or brother joe's saying it i completely forgot that all things work together for good to them who are the cult and so i got angry and i was going through conversations in my head about what i'd say if i was at the dmv with selena right now and da da da da and eventually i had to repent and say lord you've got a reason for it we did everything we did we should have we did everything right and yet it didn't happen so that means you didn't want it to happen for some reason and we don't know what that is maybe there was going to be an accident maybe she'd have had a wreck maybe she'd have got the grumpiest driving test person in the in the building and she wouldn't have passed no matter how well she did we don't know but i had to repent and say lord you do all things well right so it doesn't matter what it looks like or how inconvenient it is or or whatever because what happens as believers is we do everything right and then it doesn't go right has anybody else ever had that happen you do everything right it goes right eventually but it doesn't always go right when you want it to go right and it doesn't always happen the way you thought it should happen but it goes the way it needs to go according to his will and not yours but you do everything right and you stand there and you stand on his promise and you you step out in faith and you confess this and you testify that and then it doesn't happen when you thought it should and you say well maybe it's not for me remember he loves you remember he loves you and hold on and hold on because he loves you he's going to bring it the other thing is sometimes we doubt ourselves don't we we doubt ourselves we doubt our rightness we we doubt that we've done it the right way we we doubt maybe our motive and our objective and sometimes we've got to just have grace for ourselves and say listen he loved me and he called me and he'll work through any of these little issues i might throw up in his way you know amen we've got to remember that it's not us that's living this life in the first place amen it's not us that's living this life it is his life inside of us if jonathan was doing this tonight have failed a long time ago but he's living this life inside of us and so we've got to trust that that life is going to come forth regardless of how much concrete i put on top of it how much i turn off the taps that life's going to come out because it cannot be killed when you have eternal life inside of you it cannot die it cannot die and once it comes to life nothing can do it oh we can quench it and we can we can slow it down and we can put shade on it so it doesn't grow as well but it will continue growing and it will always break forth no matter what amen brother branham would say this he says i love him and i want you to love him i want you to believe him for perfect love casts out all fear if you love him with the right kind of a heart you won't have one speck of fear whether you can keep his word or not because what do we say we look at the word and we say well i've got to do that i've got to prove i'm one in a million i don't like that song so much because i'm not proving that he's proving it through me right i can't hold on i can't hold on i've let go many times but he never let me go yet he says you've got to have the you can't have one speck of fear whether you can keep his word or not why his word keeps his word and his word is inside of you and it's going to bring it out the way that he put it in there he says anything god says you love him so much that you believe it to think that perfect love casts out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting you're not oh i may backslide tomorrow may i may backslide next week i wouldn't worry about that i'm not trying to hold on he held on for me and he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him that's holding me not me holding him and if it was me holding him i'd probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he will never turn loose he promised he wouldn't i will never leave you i will never forsake you you're engraved in the palms of his hands i'll not lose the one that you've given me sorry that's for you brothers and sisters that's for you he's never going to let you go doesn't matter how far you go the prodigal son could never be anything but the son of his father no matter how far he went prodigal or not he was still the son and you're still the son and you're still the daughter because he's called you and he's going to place you and he's going to fulfill his word in your life amen brother bob says perfect love turns that out turns out all of that fear and he says what you may you may what you may let it go sometimes have you ever let go of him i've let go of him many times we do it we have these little ideas we have these little faults we have these little failings we have these little trips sometimes we have big trips right sometimes we forget that all things work for the good amen and we doubt and we doubt and we fear and we worry and that's torment if you're tormented i can tell you it's not of god whatever is happening your reaction to it cannot be of god if you're in torment because perfect love casts out torment amen sometimes the person you need to be the easiest on is yourself just let yourself relax and say listen he's got this i love him he loves me and he's going to sort it out and he's going to give me the strength he's going to give me whatever it takes to get me through this brother brown says do you want to act like the world and the rest of them then kiss christ goodbye and go back he says if you want it you might as well do it now i'm not advocating that to anybody today if you're not feeling it we want you to stay in the atmosphere in the presence of the holy spirit but what he's saying is if you're professing to believe and you're professing him as your lord and savior and you don't want to kiss the world goodbye get guess what he says you might as well go because your heart's not near him he says but if you want to take your way with the lord's despised few hold on to god's unchanging hand regardless of what the rest of the world says you hold right there god said so it's truth i believe it though i can't make it manifest in my life sometimes that's our problem is we're trying to make it manifest we're trying to make it happen we're trying to do it ourselves and he says listen you can't do anything to bring the word of god to pass in your life as a human as an individual in your carnality you can't do it he says it's true i believe it though i can't make it manifest in my life god said so i believe and i hold right there now i thought you say well i thought brother john you said that he was holding me he is holding you but guess what you've got to make your decision you've got to make a decision are you going to go his way or are you going to go your way are you going to go his way or are you going to go the hard way you're going to go perfect will or you're going to go permissive will guess what you can go permissive will and he'll allow you but you're going to get a spanking to bring him into his perfect will he'll work with you that way but that's not the way you want to go you've got a decision to make is will you go his way will you stay with what the word says amen you decide to stand on the word or you decide to go with the arm of flesh that's where you go that's your decision you can say lord i'm for you or lord i'm going to try it my way permissive perfect right listen the decisions in a believer's life ought to be independent of circumstance or outcome okay what that means is we don't make a decision based on how it could go we make a decision based on what does the word say for us to do in that situation and whether it's brother joe that might possibly lose a client because he stands up for the word whether it's the way you treat your kids because you're worried they'll go out in the world if you don't slacken up on them whether it's where you go whether it's where you fellowship whatever it might be you never do that based on what other people might think or how you think things might go bad you do it in faith because you're doing it based on the word and if you're doing it out of worry then you're never going to make the right decision because perfect love casts out all fear and a fearful decision cannot be a word decision it cannot be a word decision because it'll bring you a place of rest and peace regardless of how tough the decision might be to make what is it you gotta know god loves you and if you stick with his word he's gonna bring it to the right end no matter how bad the situation looks no matter how tough it is no matter how much you think you might lose you've got to make that right decision it's got to be by love amen and then we read last time that were his love perfected and then it said that his love is perfected in us that means we ought to have a perfect faith in the word that he's going to show his love and and back up his word in our lives every time john 14 15 says if you love me keep my commandments that's how you make decisions you love him and you do what his word says and it's very simple do what the word says it's very few things that you'll ever face in life that the word doesn't address in some form or another and that's where you have to go to prayer of course but if you love me he says keep my commandments brother brown would say and that's the same thing it is we must have love before we can have faith when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the battlefront for god see genuine godly love for god and for his word and for his people will push faith out there love just takes a hold of faith and just come on let's go and out it goes because that's what love does john 14 23 jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my words now you can't keep his words without having faith in what he said so you see if he loves god then he keeps god's word if he said i'm the lord that healed thee he believes that love makes him believe it because love dominates all though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love it's nothing see though i have faith to move mountains and have not love it's nothing love dominates all because god is love a god of love now yes sir if jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my words now i'll give you a simple example and i've given you this before and that's when i was in university every time i had an exam that was coming up after a church service i would never skip church as far as i know god is my witness i never skipped church to stay home and study why because the word says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together all the more as you see the day approaching okay so i had a command to go to church he didn't say don't go to church if you've got a business deal going on he didn't say don't go to church if you're going to be going through a big exam tomorrow don't go to church for that no he said don't stop assembling yourself together and then he gave me a promise he said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you so i knew that if i did my part and i wasn't fooling around and playing games and and this and that and i did my study beforehand and then i went to that exam he was going to get me through the exam now it's up to him whether i got 100 a 90 or a 60. but i never failed a class in my entire thing never failed it and i always went into a test with confidence because i knew that i had done my part and i'd obeyed his word and i didn't have to worry about it and he never failed me in that sort of a thing he never failed me now guess what satan would come and he would say look if you don't get the best marks in your class you're not going to get the best jobs you're not going to have the greatest career this is a cutthroat world you're going to have to be the best of the best of the best and you're going to get the best and everything to get anywhere in life let me tell you that's flat wrong why because he's jehovah jireh he's my provider he owns the cattle on a thousand hills guess what he can make a job out of nothing can't he he can give me a job i didn't even have to apply for initially it was decided before i even put in my formal application pretty much they decided i was gonna get that job guess what he can provide no matter how well i do and how bad i do it doesn't matter if i'm in his will and i'm doing things his way i know that he's got my back and i don't have to worry about these things amen what does satan say he says you've got to earn your way god says i've already made a way isn't that what we're looking at we've got to say god has made a way and it has nothing to do with my skills my education what i bring to the table he will bless me and provide with me what i have need of amen amen i didn't have a single fear that i wasn't going to make it through engineering school because i didn't go to church or because i went to church rather what silliness is that i'll give up god so that i can go through university right we ought not to do that amen we ought to be committed to him the way he's committed to us amen amen when we've done all par our part we stand having done everything you can stand on his word and trust him to bring us through this is brother bram now he's speaking of paul when he was on the island remember and and the snake came out of the wood and bit him he said now the very holy spirit that made the heavens and earth had that man so charged with his power till that death and that fang of that serpent wouldn't even go into his body because his whole body was full of the spirit same as it's full of blood see and is that right and every little cell of blood is a life and there you are all charged full of the holy ghost why certainly they walked on water they'd done great miracles and so forth why they were so perfectly in harmony with god that first church and christian friend until we can get back to that we can argue and quarrel and fuss with the denominations and over and ever get to it denominations won't bring it to us bring us to it it's a perfect love and a confidence of god is just what brings it amen listen you won't get it fussing around with message believers either you won't get it fussing over doctrine and who said and quote battles and all this other stuff you won't get about it fighting about it on social media it's never going to come that way amen it's going to come through the word in the simplicity of the holy spirit revealing himself to you amen how did paul not get hurt by that serpent brother brahm said the reason it hurts you is because you get scared he says don't be scared if you can get a perfect love of god in your heart that knows that this is the truth and god is your father and he's taking care of you there's nothing can harm you i'll give them power they'll tread on serpents and so forth and nothing and no i shall harm them so if you want to get close to god just get close to love he says just love god with all your heart all your soul all your mind with all your strength now listen to this he says just wrap yourself in a bundle of love don't worry about the guy next to you don't worry about the sister next to you wrap yourself in a bundle of love and watch that man that you didn't like like you he didn't say wrap them in a bundle up he said wrap you in a bundle of love the only person you can influence or correct is yourself that's the only person you can do with absolute certainty you can apply to yourself you can't force anybody to take it but he says watch that man that you didn't like like you i love that because he's taking us way beyond human love he's taken us way beyond a point where you say well i'm going to decide to love that brother or that sister he's not even necessarily talking about a brother or sister here he said that man he didn't say that christian man he said watch that man love you that didn't like you come back and love you like you all over again why because you're so surrounded with the love of god that everything that they've got just bounces off of you why you're not scared that he's going to hurt you you're not scared that she's going to hurt you you're not scared of the words they're going to say that it's somehow going to deprive you or take away from who you are what you're so wrapped up in his love that nothing else bothers you amen he said the world is dying today for love christians today we got fine scholarly churches wonderful buildings but we've got weak pulpits there's something wrong the congregation don't feel to one another like they used to there's something missing the world is looking to that christians what we need today is a baptism of love for one another by this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other and no man has greater love than that he will lay down his life for your friends he says you're no better than anybody else and whenever you think you're better than somebody else then you're nothing that you ought to be the scripture says see how come you have faith when you're expecting honor one from another scorches you must prefer one another always that's the life of christ to prefer your brother and sister and if they're wrong that's all right write that on your fridge and if they're wrong it's all right you get to influence you you get to change you god gets to change them and if they're wrong that's all right you'll never make them any better by kicking them around put an arm around and pick them up i like this old time of religion i'll tell you what it'll do it'll make a tuxedo suit sit by a pair of overalls and put an arm around one another and call each other brother amen amanda i want to take this idea of perfect love casts out fear to another angle and brother branham says this he says god projects his love and his love makes you what you are amen you're the product of love he says oh there's many things we could say about it i'm just going to let my collar down as it was for a few minutes and tell you my canadian friends some of the inside so this is just for us if you'll excuse it as a personal testimony i want you to know something on the inside of my life that i found because it seems very fitted right at this time many people wonders what takes place think it's some sort of a mystic he says it isn't it's love he's talking about the gift on the platform he says that's the main thing is loving christ not just saying you do but from your heart love him i've seen the cruelest of devils conquered i've seen wild animals floor themselves in the presence of god's love because love casted the fear away we read that that verse and said perfect love casts out fear and you say well it casts out fear me brother brown says it doesn't just cast out fear and you it casts out fear and they'll love it when you project love to somebody else when you're projecting love to somebody else then they don't worry there's no torment now guess what you ever have a dog or or a cat or a pet and they've got something wrong and you're trying to fix it maybe they've got a thorn dug into them or something and and you have to pull it out and guess what if that animal knows you love them it'll sit there and it'll let you pull that thing out even though it hurts like the dickens why because they trust you and they know that you're doing it out of love they know that you're doing it to them because you have to not because you enjoy it right it casts out the fear they're sitting there it hurts they might be quaking because it doesn't feel good but they'll let you do it because they know you love them brother brown says the same thing he says when you're dealing with somebody and they know that you love them they'll let you say things they wouldn't let anybody say they'll let you do things they wouldn't let anybody else do because they're trusting that whatever you're saying or doing is for their good and not for your good it's to make their life better it's to restore them not to make your life better or to lift you up or make you some kind of an overseer or anything amen when you love somebody and they know it you can do just about anything to them and they'll let you do it if they trust you the other thing is this if you love somebody then you'll let them do just about anything to you as well sometimes for their good you'll take the hurt and you'll see that in pastors so many times as they'll take it from people that maybe they are not to take it from they'll they'll let somebody be wrong and they'll let them go at them and they'll let them push them a little bit why because they they care for that person enough that they'll let them take out some of their hurts or offenses on them and just absorb it because they know that that person just needs to let some things out and they need to let them do that not because they're in the right just because they're human and they'll take that sort of a beating i remember i sat and literally watched a man berate a pastor many years ago and this man was just angry he was upset he was just going going going to this pastor and that man i knew without a shadowed out was flat wrong in what he was talking about he was 100 wrong there was not a single iota of truth to what he was saying or what he was he was he was pointing at that pastor and that pastor sat there and sat there and took it and took it and took it you know why because that man had a family and he wanted that man and his family to still be able to come to church he didn't want that family to pay for what that man was saying and doing and guess what after that was all said and done that pastor even apologized to that brother for for causing him any offense or hurt and that man stayed in church and his family stayed in church now i'll tell you what that man's still paying for what he did because he didn't learn his lesson and he's still paying today and his family has paid a price but the pastor was not the one that made him pay the price right god takes care of his own all he said was he he said brother basically what he's saying is i'll take the abuse i'll take the abuse if it'll keep you in fellowship i'll let you think what you want i'll let you say what you want doesn't matter to me i know i can't prove i'm right i can't prove you're wrong you won't accept it i'll let you say what you want just so you can stay in fellowship that's what he told me after he says that's why i did it because his family needs to stay in fellowship he does too he just doesn't know it because he was ready to go he's ready to go and that pastor took that abuse why because he loved the sheep and he was willing to take the hits for the sheep hey the pastor's got to smell like the sheep he's got to be out with the sheep he's got to lay in the door he's got to block anything from going out but guess what he's also got to block him in right he's trying to keep him in there he's not wanting him to go out where the wolves and the bears are and whatnot amen what that man did it can't go on forever and by no means are we saying that you get to abuse the ministry but they'll take abuse from time to time for the sake of your soul rather than for their ego amen brother brown says if you really love and you're if you really in your heart love people they know it you can't fool people they're not that dumb you can make out like you do they can tell you're only putting on and satan can tell when you're putting on but he knows when it's real you might impersonate it you might make a whole lot of things look like it but you'll never get the job done until you come into christ that's right perfect consecrated godly love sold out lock stock and barrel come to christ that's it friends look true look it's refreshed it's like i said last time remember now if you're dealing with a spiritual child you're dealing with a child they don't know that love has many sides they think love is only the hugging and the kissing and the tucking them into bed but we know love has a whole lot of sides if you're a parent amen it includes discipline it includes spaking it it includes saying no and all these different things and they don't recognize it until they're usually well past their teenage years how much you truly love them and how much abuse you put up with and how many bad attitudes you put up with and how many snarky comments you put up with because they thought that you weren't loving them but all along you were loving them and guess what you got to have grace for a spiritually immature christian the same way you do your own children and that's to say look i'm going to look past your your attitude i'm going to look past your response i'm going to look past the way you're doing things because i love you and i'm going to let god mature you and i'm just going to give you the love that i need to it doesn't mean you stop doing the spankings just because your kid doesn't recognize that doesn't recognize that you love them when you spank them doesn't mean you stop doing spankings amen but you're not out there trying to do it all the time either you don't enjoy it if you enjoy spankings you ought not to be spanking your kids i know a good friend of mine was talking to a preacher and he said he said uh you know he's talking about the the preacher said well sometimes you've got to be hard on the church he said yes but you don't have to enjoy it and that and the preacher said you're right i shouldn't we're not supposed to enjoy straighten people out or saying things hard over the pulpit that's not a joy for a minister that's not a joy for a minister by any means amen and then we might have to give some tough love from time to time but we can't make a ministry out of tough love and then we got to have a balanced ministry in these things he says did you ever sorry did you ever go out of the morning like i said that refreshing feeling the dew's fallen now did you ever go to the rose garden now it also puts blossoms out aaron's rod did and that aroma that fragrance of the flower early in the morning why everything is still and every seed that goes into the ground the dew is what makes it lives again it refreshes the dirt he said and you take the seed of god and put it into a real good flexible heart that's not prejudiced and indifferent just a nice humble heart and put that seed of god in there and let it go to groin going growing and let it get alone to itself and the dew drops of glory go to falling on the soul you'll see the sweetest meekest humblest christian in your neighborhood that you've ever seen he says that's right can i put it this way when you're dry people suffer when you're dry people suffer and when you're not refreshed how in the world can you be refreshing and then you've got to have to give you've got to receive to pass along to somebody else amen and that refreshing is what it's the overcoming of your stubborn nature so that something else can come to life amen it's putting aside the carnality and letting the spirituality come out amen the goodness of god listen i'm in grump i'm inclined to grumpiness and stubbornness that's the way i can be so guess what i got to be refreshed on a regular basis otherwise i get stubborn and grumpy so guess what if john's been stubborn and grumpy you know that he probably hasn't spent too much time lately with god right i've got to tell and guess what most of us have a tell it's our dry thing we go back to carnality that's how you know you're dry as you're going back to your carnality you go back to the way you are you were before you ever got saved many times brother braham said the bible said that he that overcometh i'll give him a new name i'll put my spirit in him he says watch there's an overcoming first you've got to overcome these things in order to be in christ that's where the church is failing in one place overcoming overcoming temper overcoming differences overcoming church prejudice overcoming hatred many people tonight who shout and speak with tongues and run up and down the aisle and hate their neighbor he says brother you're lost yet that's hard to say but that's the truth right overcome amen he says you can only overcome when you say i'm eating manna glory to god yes but look from one day to the other you get the missed meal cramps come on in where the man is fresh all the time in other words he says you get cramps because you eat something from the day before and man is only good for a day and then it spoiled and went to worm so if you ate the manna from yesterday you were eating worms and that's definitely going to cause you stomach problems he says you've got to come in to where the man is fresh he says whether your neighbor treats you right or not you'll love him anyhow that's how you know you're eating fresh manna that's right whether he agrees with you or not you love him anyhow that's the way you got to do it that's the hidden life that's that consecrated life and you're shut off from the things of the world you only live in christ remember he talked about the believer has to shut off christ to get out of his presence he's got to willingly walk out and he says this is what happens he says when you turn on christ it shuts out the things of the world it's a tap and you can have good or bad come in he wants you he's saying turn it on to christ so that you get the good things out he says you see what i mean church i don't want to hurt your feelings but i've got to stand with you at judgment someday i'm responsible for not telling the truth if i know it that's right he says oh i believe in all the shouting i believe in speaking in tongues and i believe in these things but brother that's not all that goes with it no it isn't that's just one of the attributes of it that's right he says have the real thing first and it'll produce the rest of this many will come to me in that day and say lord have i not done this and cast out devils and done all these things in your name he'd say depart from me you workers of iniquity i didn't even know you see be careful remember you try and seek after gifts instead of seeking the giver was what the problem was i mean he was pulling people out of the pentecostal experience and saying you got to go beyond it and they were happy with the pentecostal experience because it's super exciting to be a pentecostal very exciting to be a pentecostal every service is amazing right and that's what you can seek but you'll see later brother brown says he gets into a service and everybody's at the altar and they're weeping and crying he's saying we need more of these right we need to get serious we need to get real we need to get down to where god is working in our lives not just hooping and hollering in the church now brother branham he's telling this is a continuation of this quote and he's telling the story of the bull that he startled in the field he said notice in this bull as he rushed on towards me and i'm standing there i said now i won't bother you and you go lay down and he run with him five feet and he stopped and looked so depleted he looked one way and then the other turned around and walked over and laid down and i walked within 10 foot of that bull right across the field he never moved again and i went over and after i got across the field and stood there i come to myself and i thought what happened he says then i began to weep and raise up my hands and praise god what had happened with that bull when he says mr bole i'm sorry i'm on his i'm on his mission i'm on his purpose i didn't mean to bother you that wasn't brother branham this was beyond the humanity this was beyond the carnality this was beyond him just being a prophet he says i came to myself and i began to weep and praise god why because god spoke out of a man there and he said i'm sorry but he says but you need to go lay down. that's what happened there was brother branham got raised to a new level of love that he'd never experienced before because he wasn't mad and he wasn't scared he was sorry and apologetic but he loved that animal he loved it enough to say i'm sorry but he said but you need to go lay down because i'm on his i'm on his mission i'm on his will i'm on his purpose so you got to get out of my way but i'm sorry that takes a profit that takes a real experience to say i'm sorry but you're going to have to back down to an animal we won't even do it to a human half the time and he did it to an animal he said i was cutting my yard last summer and i was going through with the power mower how many knows what a horn it is then that lays that big nest there's a bunch of them that made a nest out there in the corner of the fence in a little bush like and i was running this paramour through there and in the backyard nobody seen me i took off my shirt and i was just mowing away and i hit this fence and all of a sudden i forgot those hornets were there and i was covered all over in a few minutes with hornets and those great big fellows and no shirt on he says well at first it scared me but then it happened again something and i thought poor little fellow over there in that nest and here i he says they weren't bothering me i disturbed them he says i wish i know what it was but it's something that happens what is it this is a new experience for him this is beyond anything he's ever experienced this is beyond him experiencing things in the meetings and great signs and wonders this is a whole new experience in christ that he's getting here where he says i felt sorry for them poor little fellas how many times would we say to a bee or a hornet poor little fella i disturbed you and that's why you're coming after me he says at first i was scared but then i thought oh poor little fellas and i thought poor little fellas and here's what i said i said now you little creatures of god god created you i'm god's servant and i gotta hurry with this yard because he said he keep trying to do the lawn and then somebody come to be prayed for and any back and forth and the lawn would never get done so he was rushing out there to just get it done finally he says now you're little creatures of god god created you i'm god's servant i got to hurry with this yard and they were just the buzzing around and i wasn't afraid of them and i said now you run right back into your nest in the name of the lord jesus because i got to hurry him all this yard i won't bother you no more because god's servants are waiting to be prayed for and brother i'll meet you at the judgment they circled around me a few times and one took the lead and the whole bunch of them went right back into the nest and quieted down he said atmosphere god that's right there's something about it look at his response now he was fearful but he says then something rose up he says and then i wasn't scared anymore perfect love cast out his fear and it caused them to lose their fear and go back to where they needed to be that's an amazing thing when you think about it amen what is it when you do that i've said it before when you act in love it makes the other person drop their sword because they see you're not holding a sword of love that's not what we're holding with that amen love conquers all but it doesn't do it by blunt force trauma man doesn't do it by beating them over the head what does it do it lets them see that you're there for them not there for yourself because when you go in for yourself you're not loving them you're loving yourself more than them right but when they see that you're not in it for you you're in it for them then they start to drop their weapon they start to lower their guard and they start to realize okay this isn't what i thought and then their fear drop starts to drop and then trust starts to come in and then love starts to come in and all of a sudden you can sort things out right what is it you're just doing what you need to do and if they're in the way listen sometimes we step into people's hearts sometimes we step into people's old offenses sometimes we step into their old history and we don't have a clue listen i came from a place where there were landmines buried everywhere due to church splits and ministerial issues and all that guess what i stepped on a lot of landmines stepped on a lot of landmines and you don't even know why people are reacting the way you do and you can't take it personally you stepped on their tail so to speak right you step on a dog he's going to nip you usually sometimes we step on people's tails and they nip us and we get all worked up but listen if we're walking in love them when they get worked up we don't rile back we don't get worked up back just because they're mad doesn't make us mad just because their hurt doesn't make us hurt just because they're offended doesn't cause us to become offended right what is it at first we might be hurt at first we might be scared but something's supposed to rise up and say whoa this reaction is way more than what i just did i have no idea what caused it but this isn't obviously isn't about me so i'm just gonna back away sorry didn't mean to do it don't know what i did but i love you let's move on right and hopefully they'll drop their sword amen what is it brother braham said atmosphere god that's what you're looking for is atmosphere god in your situation we need oxygen to breathe right atmosphere oxygen our atmosphere ought to be the love of christ in our lives every single day amen what is it we talked about that gushing that overflowing and we're going to get to it a little bit amen what is it that's flowing out and it suppresses all of your humanity all of your instinct they say humans are the only ones that can stop and choose their reaction animals can't do it animals act out of instinct you bite an animal that's going to whip around and bite you or charge you or do anything but a human if brother bob came up and he whacked me on the shoulder guess what i wouldn't automatically whack him back because i'm not an animal we have the ability to stop and choose our reaction and if you're a believer then your reaction ought to be love and christ every single time amen now listen this doesn't happen overnight i'm almost 43 years old and this is not the way i do it every time and i've talked to the slightly older people in the church and they they assure me that this is not the way they react every time right this is something that happens over time and it's a constant work in our life amen this kind of love listen the prophet i mean when he's preaching that is is 1955 so i mean he's well into his ministry and he's just starting to experience things like this and that's a prophet that's a man that's completely set aside dedicated has a specific call in his life and then he's not a mere christian the way some of us are in those things god was doing something in him what was it it was a first fruit it was a waving of the sheaf so that we could see what we were coming to in our life as well brother braham says he's talking about the purifying of gold and he says and now they cook that and then they skim it all off all the all the dross and they just keep cooking it and cooking it until it's pure going gold boiled down to nothing but 100 gold it's not 100 gold the first time you don't have 100 of god you're not pure christian the first time around and then there are many many many circles around this wagon and then we're going to go around and around and around him and there's a lot of cooking and cooking and cooking that happens for the believer he says what and that's the way god does it in his church he pours the holy spirit on it and cooks down in there till he throws out all the worldliness and the differences and the selfishness and all this until he just boils it out of every individual that will come to him amen so what does that tell me that tells me this isn't a church affair he doesn't boil it out of a church he boils it out of every individual that will come to him and submit themselves to it now it happens at church it happens through the preaching of the word it happens under the atmosphere of the holy spirit but it happens to individuals that will open themselves up to it that will willingly submit themselves to the working hand of god in their lives amen doesn't mean we don't have love if you're not 100 doesn't mean you have it just means that you're going to have it in certain areas of your life and you'll be able to handle certain situations and as you grow and mature then you'll get to a higher and higher level to where somebody can do just about anything where the scripture says that you know if he slaps your face on one side then turn the cheek to the other not many of us can do that we don't get slapped very often but we get slapped verbally don't we we get slapped by people's emotions we get slapped by situations and how many times can we say try it on the other side now that's what we're looking for man is that ability to just stop and say lord where's your love going to do what's it going to do in this situation i know what i want to do in my flesh in my mind i know what i want to do but that doesn't seem very christian let's see what your love can do in this situation now i want to transition over to grace here because brother braham said when love projects grace goes to work i'm paraphrasing but basically god's love produces grace that has an effect on the believer i would say this that god's love produces grace that produces a believer right because by faith through what grace we're saved so that love goes forth and then when that love goes forth it projects grace and when grace projects it produces the object brother branham would say we don't exist outside of god's grace we're under a grace covenant if you go outside of the grace covenant now you're under law and you don't want to be under law there's no covering for law anymore law's done law is fulfilled if you choose to go back to law all you find is judgment there's no grace back there but second corinthians 9 this is the effect of grace in the believer's life and it says and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound in every good work there's a lot of abounding and there's a lot of all in there and anytime god says all i like to pay attention because all is everything if he says all then that's a good thing there's no limit to what he's talking about he's saying i'll give you everything when he says all amen so he says god extends all of his grace to you and it abounds that word abound means overflow so if he said he's saying if you got the grace of god then it overflows your life and if it overflows that means it's going to have an effect on somebody else because it's flowing out of you to someplace else it's got to go to somebody else so that means if you've experienced god's grace if you're experiencing god's grace then there shall be an overflow in your life of that grace and it should go to somebody else the scripture says that the grace of god gives you all sufficiency in all things so that you can abound in every good work so you have a certain amount all and it makes you abound in every good work amen it's a work of god this grace it's all from him there's nothing we've done to warrant it as we've covered it before there are no performance metrics for a christian if you reach you know a 70 score on your christianity then you get to go to heaven that's not what we're talking about anymore that is done you have christ righteousness you have 100 on the test regardless of what you do you're there because he took your pace and he paid your price amen grace is undeserved it's unmerited by definition therefore you cannot do anything to receive it it's given to you regardless of what you do now listen to this brother brahm says sovereign grace is from a sovereign one sovereign what can it do sovereign can do whatever it wants to listen to this now sovereign grace can only be given by one that's sovereign and god is sovereign so he can give sovereign grace therefore being sovereign grace don't have to ask anybody it doesn't have to it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful sovereign grace doesn't answer to the pastor he doesn't answer to the ministry doesn't answer to the laity it doesn't answer to the deacons sovereign grace answers to no one but the one that gives it and he chooses whom he will choose the scripture says he'll have mercy who will have mercy on right it does it and it doesn't have to ask questions that's a wonderful kind of grace listen when you extend grace to somebody you don't answer to anybody else when you extend god's grace to somebody else you don't have to answer to somebody else why are you letting them get away with it why aren't you doing listen i'm extending grace i don't have to answer there is no reason for grace except to give grace that's all there's no reason you can't explain it you're just saying i'm giving it it's sovereign to you you get to choose just like god does you want to express grace you give it you don't have to answer to anybody else for it he says isn't that wonderful it doesn't have to ask can i do this or shall i do this can i must i will i doesn't do it it does it itself grace is sovereign therefore listen the effect of this sovereign grace he can save the vilest he can save the worst he can save the impurist he can save the immoralist he can save the sickest hallelujah amen amen paul says i was the worst among you i was the chiefest of sinners and it saved him so it can definitely save us he says he can save a wretch like me and he did what is it it's grace william branham a drunkard's son that don't make any difference the grace of god saved me me i'm a woman's daughter there was no good don't make any difference the grace of god saved you it's sovereign it has to ask nobody nothing amen i'm so glad of that hallelujah can take the vilest sinner and make him white as snow and don't have to ask anybody about it oh it can do it because it's sovereign you say well i'm completely overcome i'm drowning satan's got a hold on me doesn't matter his grace is all sufficient for you amen you say there's you look at your loved ones they're so far gone sometimes we say what they're too far gone listen if he can save rahab he can save your daughter she was as far gone as we'd ever want our daughters to go if he could save rahab he can save your daughter you say well they're stuck in denominations they've left the message listen if he can save saul and turn him into paul the prophet of the age who is stuck in his nose and books from a from a youngest age and was the greatest of all denominational believers he can save our lost ones that have gone out into the denominations or left the message amen grace doesn't answer to anybody except the one that gives it and it can do anything anything there's no limit to grace because there's no reason to do it so there's no limit to it brother branham i didn't put it in here for the sake of time but he talked about that that that boy that killed the king's son remember and he went to the boy and he said why'd you do it he said i don't know i just did it i wasn't in my right mind he says i'm so sorry i didn't mean to do it i'm sorry for the pain i caused he says i know i've got to die and i'm willing to die says i just want you to know i'm sorry and the king said he opened it up he said pardon him put my son's robe on him he's my son now and he took him out and he presented them to the people that's what grace can do you're crazy king doesn't matter it's my grace to give and i give it to him right he was sorry i gave it to him doesn't have to answer to anybody amen what does this grace look like in our life paul says it has an effect and he says it gives us all sufficiency in all things amen all sufficiency in all things that sufficiency means a perfect condition of life in which no aid or support is needed sufficiency of the necessities of life and a mind contented with its lot that's the sufficiency we're talking about brother bryan would say this he says i'm just as i said this morning my whole makeup is grace a lot of people say now you scratch my back and i'll scratch yours yeah you do something for me and i'll do something for you that's not grace grace is if your back is itching i'll scratch it anyhow whether you scratch mine or not you can slap me on the face and say my back needs scratching i'll scratch it it's one thing to say i'll scratch yours even if you don't scratch mine but he says if you slap my face and then say i have a need he says i'll meet your need that's the kind of grace he's talking about see that's it do something i don't believe in works i believe that works is love works is the manifestation that grace has taken place he says i don't live true to my wife because i believe she divorced me if i didn't i live true to her because i love her i don't preach the gospel because i think i go to hell if i didn't i preach the gospel because i love him certainly he says you think i'd cross these stormy seas and then planes diving back and forth and lightning flashing around and everything else and almost any minute and everybody's screaming and hail mary's going on through the plane and everything then people swinging in them safety belts and the pilot saying we've got enough gas left last 15 minutes longer and don't know where we're at he says do you think i'd do that just for the fun of doing it huh do you think i'd get back out there in the jungle where german soldiers had to put their arms around me like this each night and take me in and out of the meeting until the holy spirit began to perform miracles he had to be surrounded by men so he wouldn't get shot he says communist setting out there with knight scopes to shoot me a mile away do you think i do that just for the fun of it he says it's because something in me loves they're humans that christ died for paul said i'm not only willing to go up to jerusalem but i'm going up there to be crucified i'm going up to die i'm going up there to die for the cause of the lord it's something love that constrains you that makes you that's exactly right he says that you would have all sufficiency to abound in all things what he's saying is that he'll give you everything you need to take you where he wants you to go amen and it'll take you into places you don't want to go take you to places you don't want to be dealing with situations you don't want to deal with and people you don't particularly like why because you're there to express grace you're there to express love paul says that by this grace you have all you need in every aspect of life and you're content with what you've been given so in other words what god has called you to do he equips you for it whatever you need he says you're going to bound to every good work every good work can only be the working of the kingdom of god everything you need to do in the kingdom of god he says god's grace has already provided it for you to get the job done that's what we're talking about here all sufficiency in all things man if we'd only realized that if we'd only accept that what he's called me to do he's gonna give me everything i need to get to the finish line with it amen now that doesn't mean you look at your natural traits and say well this is what he's equipped me with therefore this is what i am or this is what i'm supposed to do listen just because you can speak doesn't make you a minister just because you can sing doesn't make you a song leader right you have to a lot of times learn to lay it down and humble yourself and get taught and mature a bit and maybe he'll use it but guess what maybe he'll tell you to lay it down as well maybe you have to do something else and he's going to have to grow you up in those places and you're really going to need faith because you don't naturally have it you know paul didn't paul wasn't a good speaker you know that paul wasn't a good speaker they said speech is mean it's not it's not he's not polished he's not a good speaker utica fell asleep listening to paul that's how bad he was right but yet he was the prophet of the age he was called the speaker he was called the right he was called to do all of these things right but don't rest on your natural traits and say well that's the automatic you know alignment with what god wants me to do no no no we don't do that he said times may be hard god has not promised a flowery bed of ease but he has promised grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you that's right he says yes indeed grace is sufficient now he's on a flowery bed not he's on a flowery bed of ease but he promised grace to overcome in every temptation and when a cross gets heavy christ promised to be with you that's what we were talking about paul said that we would abound to every good work amen we want to live in the overflow and it starts with grace for ourselves so that we can give grace to those that come up around us amen we're pouring out we're bubbling out we've got a spring of living water inside of us like the scripture talks about amen so that what nothing can quench it and nothing can restrain it listen you fill a pipe up and you keep putting pressure on it it's going to blow eventually i don't care how big you make it i don't care how strong you make it you put enough pressure behind it it's going to blow and that's the way the christian life is you put enough god behind you it's going to overflow eventually you can put all sorts of of whatever you want on top of it but it's going to blow eventually i mean if you've got it inside you it's going to let go he says that's the way people do today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of duty listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light and having fellowship with god and with his people and the holy spirit is upon you and you meet an obstacle right in the path of duty don't stop just keep pressing on god will make a way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see god when i can't get over it can't get under it can't get around it or anyway god opens up a way and i go through it somehow or another his grace is sufficient to carry us through it now for us when we would say sufficient you know if i said i want a full glass and i was to put it up here we'd say sufficient would be to fill it to the top we'd say that's sufficient or we'd say i want enough to quench my thirst and so we'd fill it up exactly as the deacons had you know what god's sufficiency looks like overflowing more than you need that's what god's sufficiency looks like more than you could ask more than you could ever need it not only meets the need but it goes beyond the need and it helps somebody else's need as well that's the kind of sufficiency we're talking about it's not just enough for you but it's enough for the people around you as well because they're feeding off of the grace and the love that's coming out of your life as well amen so the question is brother braham says what if you're walking in the light having fellowship with god the holy spirit's upon you the question is what kind of work are we doing with it if we're supposed to abound in every good work are we doing good work or are we doing satan's work what are we putting our time and energy into because if we're doing it it's going to be abounding it's going to be growing it's going to be expressing itself it's going to be coming out into good things for the kingdom of god not for myself not for my ministry not for my ego not for my reputation but it's going to be doing good things for the kingdom of god and it'll be jonathan curlett minimum and it'll be god maximum every single time right but it's got to abound to a good work amen an overflow of god cannot benefit satan's kingdom if your overflow is benefiting satan's kingdom then you're under a wrong anointing and if you're if your overflow is leading you to mess around with satan's kingdom then you're definitely not in the overflow of the holy spirit it can't be he says brother god gave the holy spirit god's love to control the church not smart educated but love gifts go in the church but it doesn't control the church love controls the church god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son his love constrained him to do it and when a love is constrained then sovereign grace projects its object may i say that again when divine love is projected grace produces its object and god so loved the world so much till sovereign grace projected a savior to the world yes indeed and when you love god so much sovereign grace will project you to the baptism of the holy ghost to do what make you live and love and be a real christian amen amen grace projects when you receive god's love is what he says he says and god's love will bring you right to the holy ghost but then what are you going to do after that because it's got to be a chain he gives it to you so we can't give somebody the holy ghost but we can show them the holy ghost that they can desire we can show them the life of a real christian amen like brother branham when he had that guy we talked about last service where he was talking about that man that that just ripped him to shreds but at the end the guy said i'll tell you one thing you got the spirit of christ brother brown says well then which spirit am i of if i got the spirit of christ then i can't be wrong here right and people get into a paradox where they say yeah it's a real christian but he's wrong well you can't have that that doesn't make any sense right have you got the spirit of christ it's going to show around you right amen amen but grace doesn't always feel good at least god's grace god's grace includes conviction god's grace includes correction because he says you're a bastard if he doesn't do it right but it also includes what the pat on the back the encouragement includes the love all of these different things amen grace tells us the truth even when we don't want to hear it right because the world doesn't do that they say i'm living my truth or accept my truth listen that's not the grace of god the grace of god tells you the truth regardless of whether or not you want to hear it but it's always done in love amen that grace is sufficient to meet the need amen it has nothing to do with where the other person's at if you're overflowing it has nothing to do with them does it right the overflow in you has nothing to do with where they're at that's why you can give it is because it has nothing to do with them it's just coming out of you naturally brother brown would say think of it love and grace are sisters twin sisters you can't have grace without having love they're twin sisters exactly right and before you can have grace you have to have love before you can actually sow somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't see love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all we can't see one without the other for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he shed his grace and brought it in our hearts through the holy ghost see there's just nothing you can do without working one with the other the grace the grace of god is what saves us amen and that's not something you just receive once amen the grace of god is every single day every single day his mercies are new every day that tells me his grace is new every day right his goodness is new every day and all these things so this is grace that's continuously coming out of him what to come to us and then it goes to us and it comes out and it goes and it helps the person next to you and helps your neighbor and your your brother and your sister in these different things amen we see these shirts today that say only god can judge me has anybody seen those it's very popular today only god can judge me it's a meme on social media and these different things listen you don't want to be there judgment is takes you out of the ju the covenant of grace and it puts you right back under the law and guess what every single one died under the law except for that blood and guess what when you say only god can judge me you're saying i don't even want his blood you're saying i'm going to stand on my merits and i'm going to convince him that i'm right you can't convince god you're right there's only one right you can live your entire life right and you'll still be wrong because you're born and sin shaped in iniquity amen you cannot do it yourself amen but what is it grace will look at somebody and say what i've been down that road don't go down that road you know they have what do they call them gateway drugs you've heard of gateway drugs great gateway drugs are a minor drug that leads to a greater dependency and heavier drugs you know oftentimes what we do is we look at somebody and we say what you're doing is a gateway drug what you're doing is going to take you down a path and it's going to take you to here if you don't stop it up front you got to stop it now otherwise you're not going to help it because guess what once you're addicted to a drug there's no going back and so they have and i don't know anything about these drugs or whatever but they say there's gateway drugs that are cheaper and easier to get and what they do is they get you hooked and then you need more and more and more and it takes you to the heavier and harder stuff until you're completely destroyed in your body and in your mind and these different things grace tells us that's a gateway drug brother brother that's a gateway drug sister don't go there don't do that i've been there i've seen people go there you don't want to go down that path that's grace when we talk to our brothers and sisters like that amen what is it otherwise you're saying only god can judge me that's why we have a body we have a body to help that's why we have elders that's why you have experienced christians is to warn us about these things say you don't want to go there you don't want to go there because all that's there is it's heartache and failure and pain and suffering and these different things we talked about last time you can never lose your soul if you're a child of god but you can lose your reward and you'll see people do that and they get caught up in something and they go all the way down they destroy their christian reputation and they'll just end up half the time nothing they end up walking away and god has to take them it's a dangerous place to be brother says we're walking in the light as he is in the light see we're moving up the king's highway and the farther it comes more grace is given praise the lord more power is given and more supernatural is given and there we are this is the hour where the holy spirit has come down in the form of a light like he was at the beginning a pillar of fire and has manifested himself doing the very same things he did when he was on earth brother abraham says the further you go with god the more grace you're going to need not only the more grace you're going to need the more grace you're going to get amen amen praise the lord he didn't just say you need it he says there's going to be more and with more grace will come more power and with that will come more supernatural but he says you're going to need more grace to move on with god so the thing is this if you're further with god you ought to be more gracious if you've received more than you're going to be giving more if you're closer to god and you're moving further with god and you're getting less gracious then guess what chances are you're on the wrong path you're not walking as closely with god as you think it is brother brown says the further you go the more grace is given and the more you're given the more you'll give amen i want to be in that place i want to be in that place where more grace is given where the natural response is grace amen the bride's the bride's ministry is mercy because while we're here there's mercy there's blood on the mercy seat as long as we're here but once we go it's gone we take mercy with us so we want to be mercy we want to be grace we want to be the one that'll take the hit for the sake of the other person's soul amen the scripture says if he gives more grace what says what he giveth more grace we read it last time amen if he gives more grace then what ought we to do we ought to give more grace the further we go the closer we get to the rapture the more gracious we ought to be as a people amen our attitude ought to be more gracious that's for sure amen or do we what just sit there we cross our arms and we say not me not me no we ought to be the first one to say my brother my sister my friend my neighbor i'll love you i'll show you the grace you need to get you through this amen what did the king do to esther remember the king he decided all if he reached out the scepter it was grace and if he didn't reach it it was automatic death and the king himself only decided who that was whether he would reach it out and esther went in he was happy to see her but guess what christ didn't just reach out to the ones he was happy to see the ones that came in with the right attitude and the right spirit the ones that came in with the the right approach and that looked right and dressed right and said the right words listen he gave grace to all he offered grace to all amen the closer we get that's the kind of grace we ought to do is regardless of how they come it ought to be grace grace grace grace romans 5 says for as by one man's disobedient many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offenses might abound but where sin abounded where sin overflowed grace did much more abound grace did much more overflow remember we said that what fervent love covers a multitude of sins right what is it it extends mercy grace unmerited favor beyond the issue and it covers it all amen it looks past the fault to the need as the song says he says that as sin reigneth reigned unto death even so grace even so my grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord that grace of his takes us all the way to eternal life to the experience of it we have it in our souls by the holy spirit but it takes us all the way to the reality of it beyond this curtain of time brother brahms says annette and we pray father that as the poet said the forlorn and the shipwrecked brother seeing our steadiness on keel seeing it shall take heart again or take courage again and try again and know that the all-sufficient god if we stumble or fall his great hand is there to help us his grace is sufficient amen that's his attitude to us if he stumble if we stumble or fall he'll pick us up every single time every single time what will we do to each other will we pick each other up every single time will we left up somebody that's been stepped on or will we just say had that coming saw that one coming a mile away knew it was coming told him didn't listen told her she didn't listen now she's there no no no that's not where we want to be amen sir is them right tried to help they didn't listen that's a self-righteous attitude and we need to repent of it and then sometimes our grace runs out when we've tried to help and the person hasn't listened and then they're in the mess grace looks beyond the fault grace looks beyond the the refused message beyond the refused advice and says i'll help you up regardless and it never says i told you so never says i told you so amen grace keeps you in his presence grace ought to restore them to his presence as well amen and then i want to close with just a couple of quotes here and one of them's very familiar and it's where brother batman's giving his testimony beyond the curtain of time and and brother branham was changed after he did that that was that was back in 1961 sometime i think and that changed brother branham he just he knew he says you know he talked about he says whatever you do don't miss it whatever you do don't miss he says it's beyond anything you could ever imagine it's beyond anything you ever think anything you've ever dreamed he says what's waiting for us over there is greater than anything we could ever imagine but i want you to catch this because he says after this hope my first wife hugged me and said my precious brother then another young woman hugged me and hope turned and hugged the young woman and i said i don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love i don't want to go back to that old body on the bed then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it now that's one of the deepest things i've ever read but guess what i didn't realize it until yesterday because i've been listening to questions and answers and at the end of it listen god is perfect in his timing listen i can study till my eyeballs fall out and there'll still be a question there or there'll be something lingering and he'll come in and out of the middle of nowhere he'll drop something in and like boom there you go and it's the key that unlocks the sermon it's the thing that finishes it it's the one that gives you the rest that you need about it okay so we're talking about this is what the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it they sent a question they said paul said to covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show iu a more excellent way please explain what the more excellent way is brother braham says love first corinthians see but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as i also as also i am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity now you start to tie that together where he says this is what you preach the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it and what's he saying he's saying he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw people that weren't identified by their natural relationships they weren't identified by their country of origin they weren't identified by their social status by the color of their skin by the amount of money that was in their bank account they weren't identified by the ministry they were under they weren't identified by the size of the church they were in they weren't identified by the gifts that they had none of that was present when he went over there those are childish things those are things we look to in this flesh but that is not the perfection we're seeking amen and those are things that we fixate on and we we and paul said you're seeking the gifts but he says that's not where you want to go you want to go beyond the gifts because there's a more perfect way there's a more excellent way for this and he says what is it it's love love is the more excellent way but on the other side he says you'll see what love is because the other side is grace personified when love projects grace produces the object of that love right the other side is the object of what love was going to seek that's what he's talking about here hebrews 11 says and these all having obtained a good report through faith remember faith hope charity they had hope and faith he says having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise why because they went to a waiting area they didn't receive it they went to a waiting area and then christ goes and he takes them out of prison and he takes them up into a place where they could what rest but that's not it they didn't have it he says god having provided some better thing for us a more excellent way that they without us should not be made perfect so remember divine love has an objective and grace goes out to achieve that effective what was brother branham seeing on the other side then the objectives the objects of the love of god amen god's love went out and grace abounded and it went through the ministry of a prophet and it went through the ministry of of all these men and women throughout throughout the ages and brother branham was up there and perhaps he thought it was about him perhaps he thought it was about his lineage because he's seen hope and he's seen sharon rose and all these different things right but over there they weren't his loved ones they were just loved ones they weren't his there was no relationship there when they hugged him he didn't feel a stirring of any sort he didn't his hormones didn't kick in this wasn't a love like he had for hope when she was down here amen that relationship with brother branham is not what got them there what brought them there was way beyond brother branham amen maybe brother branham thought that he brought them there and certainly god used him to do these different things but what was it god projected grace through love through grace and what did it do it helped them come to their real family because over there it's it's not collins and curletts and coffees and katukas and colombos and lushes and sharps that doesn't exist over there you know what exists over there my precious brother my precious sister my precious brother my precious sister he's going over there and he's saying this and the voice says this is what the holy ghost is my precious brother my precious sister now it's what by one spirit we're baptized into one body and there's the body there's the body that's what we're going for all this for is not to to just do signs and wonders here to make people look at us but it's to be one in that body over there the holy ghost is the object personified over there now you're in the body of christ now it's not about who you're married to now it's not about what ministry you're under or what you do here it's that you're back in one together again this is what the holy ghost is is each and every one of us with all the humanity stripped away all the carnality stripped away and all you're left with is the object of his perfect love grace personified on the other side amen this was a love connection that passed anything he'd ever experienced here even that with the ball and this and that and the other thing because it took us out of these the the this horrible flesh that we're in and it took us into a perfect place where it couldn't hold us back amen love has that purpose and grace achieved that purpose and he got to go see it that was the holy ghost personified right there was christ in us together in a body in a way that we couldn't what is it god gives me the holy ghost gives you the holy ghost to take us all the way to the other side where we can finally recognize who and what we really are and how we fit into this body amen what it takes us out of our worldly affiliations it takes us out of our carnality takes us out of our way of thinking and it brings us to a place where we only have the mind and the relationship of christ amen over there blanca corletta is no more the wife of jonathan curlette she's my precious sister and she's my precious sister to brother mark as much as she is to me i have no hold on her i have no claim on her why because now we're refined now we're in the perfect object of the grace that comes by love amen amen that's what we're fighting for today is to get past being a coffee to get past being a curlette to get past being a colombo to get past being a sharp a collins a lush to get past that and say i'll give you grace because i believe that in the end we're all one and the same and we're going to be over there and we're going to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder and sing amazing grace that's what we're looking for why wait over there to sing amazing grace with your brothers and sisters why wait over there to say amazing grace or show amazing grace to our neighbors and to those we run into at work and these different things amen we want to we want to say well i'll blame it on the body listen let's not use that as an excuse brother you know paul said i'd die daily i'd rather confess i'm dying daily than the body's winning let that be our confession amen that the grace is winning that the love is winning and it's not just winning where for me it's winning in other people's lives as well as we close and the musicians come i want to read a prayer that brother branham is doing and this is in questions and answers a different one he says i'm only going by the way your word said to the best of my knowledge and by the witness of the holy spirit that lives in my heart to me it's perfect and i pray god that it will become perfect to this church that this church may become perfected in the love of christ that this will be a place where people will come from around the world to come in here and see the glorious operation and harmony of the spirit for gifts and manifestations till when sinners walk in the building the holy spirit will be so dominating in here till they'll weep and walk up to the altar and give their lives to thee amen let's stand together if we would is that your desire that when people listen they don't have to come into church they just need to be around you and not dismissive and not looking down your nose but your love is there and your grace is there and all you're wanting to do is show christ amen all you're trying to do is get them to see him and you right that's all you're looking to do and so the judgment falls away then the judgment falls away whether they're living in sin whether the you know alternative lifestyles or all the craziness that goes on wrapped up in hollywood and that so where they talk you talk to them and they're not they're not judged because of your attitude their conscience is pricked because of your attitude and then you're not putting them down you're not turning them into a second-class citizen you're not turning them into cannon fodder but you're drawing them into what the overflow of the grace and love that's in your life and we ought to be able to do that with our blo our brothers and sisters in here but it ought to be beyond that amen you ought to be able to take the slap in the face from time to time and say that's not i'm not going to respond the way you want me to and that'll get them more often than anything you might say or say or do say is is when you can respond in a way that they're not expecting and you look past what they're doing and you're looking to the heart and soul them and saying what christ died for them listen he knows his own we don't know his own do we we don't know so we got to give it to everyone we don't get to pick and choose we don't get to say you don't go to our ministry you don't go to our church you don't no no no we've got to offer it to all because we never know it could be the the saul that's persecuting us that's coming in or it could be our own children you know we just don't know what it's going to be but amen we want him to be able to say that's a real christian and i want the christ that he has right i want what he has i see something there i don't see in everybody else and that's what i want amen not perfect but there's a grace and there's a love there that's calling to me and says you need to come and get what he's got you need to come and get what she's got amen let's just bow our heads together lord god we are so thankful for your grace tonight amen lord that we can look back over our lives and we can see the many things you've done lord the many things you've looked past our faults and failures lord our petty attitudes our little isms lord are huffing and puffing at times lord our our fear our disgust lord our shame whatever it might be lord you look beyond that you always look to the need lord and your grace always allows us a path to restore us into fellowship again and lord we want to be able to do that with each other lord that if there's any schism lord if there's any hindrance in the body if there's any breaks lord lord we want your grace to overflow out of us lord that it would cast out all fear lord that we would wrap ourselves in love as the prophet said lord so that it would let that other person actually come around to us again amen lord we ask your great sword that we will be ministers of that grace lord each and every one lord that in our witness and testimony of our everyday life lord that people would see a christ that would draw them to him lord we ask your grace to go out with us now we pray lord bless this fellowship we ask in
