[43:01] maybe he'll
[43:03] do and so forward to that I also
[43:06] received a number of books when brother
[43:08] George Smith was here of course he's he
[43:10] he helps run Believers
[43:14] International books out there on the uh
[43:17] the shelves out there and these
[43:18] reformatted versions that have been
[43:20] cleaned up and grammar IED a bit and
[43:22] made a little uh easier then we have as
[43:25] well um so the church ages we haven't
[43:28] put out the Seven Seals ones we have but
[43:30] we have plenty of the church age books
[43:32] if you're looking for the newer ones and
[43:33] the Beautiful leather covers and whatnot
[43:35] um I've been going through it some
[43:37] others I know are going through it and
[43:38] it's just a wonderful wonderful thing
[43:40] for a Believer we encourage that have um
[43:43] the book on music and that uh there's
[43:46] enough I think for one per family so if
[43:49] you want that take it we have a healing
[43:52] thoughts so they're there for if you
[43:53] want them they're not assigned to
[43:55] anybody once you're done with it maybe
[43:56] you could bring back since we only have
[43:58] a few and then there lots of witnessing
[43:59] tracks there as well on baptism and
[44:01] these different things
[44:03] if them
[44:05] out of the church and whatnot which is
[44:07] nice because the church age books big
[44:09] and thick and expensive resume of the
[44:12] church ages if they like that then you
[44:13] can give them the full Church age book
[44:15] later or something like
[44:16] that as well for the children and uh
[44:19] sister Blanca and and sister Priscilla
[44:21] will probably manage handing those out
[44:23] as well but by all means take what you
[44:25] want they're there to be used and
[44:28] to others that might be interested in
[44:30] this end time message amen God bless you
[44:32] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[44:35] three I feel like we've read Ephesians
[44:37] so many times and
[44:39] so it's the Joshua of the New Testament
[44:43] and it's our book amen that's the it's
[44:45] the book for those that were sitting
[44:47] directly under the prophet's message
[44:49] this was Paul's Church in Ephesian uh
[44:51] the in Ephesus and and this was his body
[44:54] of Believers and we see they're the
[44:55] greatest of all of them if you want to
[44:57] compare the descriptions between the
[44:59] Corinthians and the Hebrews and these
[45:01] different things the Ephesians were the
[45:02] best of the best and they're they're put
[45:05] in alignment and and all the things of
[45:07] God are are discussed with the Ephesian
[45:09] Church age so this is our amen this is a
[45:11] a portion that's dedicated certainly the
[45:13] elect it's it's to the Saints it's not
[45:16] those that are out and those that are in
[45:18] no it's it's for those that are hidden
[45:20] in Christ I want us to really focus on
[45:22] that this evening and in verse three it
[45:24] says blessed be the God and Father of
[45:28] who blessed us with all spiritual
[45:30] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[45:33] according as he had chosen Us in him
[45:35] before the foundation of the world that
[45:37] we should be holy and Without Blame
[45:40] before him in love having predestinated
[45:42] us unto the adoption of children by
[45:45] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[45:47] good pleasure of his will we're going to
[45:50] be speaking on how do I find God's will
[45:51] for my life here's God's will for your
[45:53] life the adoption of children by his
[45:56] good pleasure amen it says to the praise
[45:59] of the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[46:01] made us accepted in the Beloved in whom
[46:04] we have Redemption through his
[46:06] blood of sins according to the riches of
[46:09] his grace wherein he had abounded toward
[46:11] us in all wisdom and Prudence having
[46:14] made known unto us the mystery of his
[46:17] will according to his good pleasure
[46:20] which he had purposed in himself that in
[46:23] the dispensation of the fullness of
[46:25] times that's when it's all wrapped up he
[46:27] might gather together in one all things
[46:29] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[46:32] which are in Earth even in him so we see
[46:34] that his will leads us into full
[46:36] Redemption full restoration and relation
[46:39] with him so if you want to know what is
[46:41] the mystery of God's will is this it
[46:43] will bring you in closer relationship
[46:45] with him and his people time that is the
[46:48] purpose of God it's to bring us back
[46:50] into what we have before the foundation
[46:52] of the world Amen God bless you you can
[46:53] have your seats this evening and I'm
[46:56] taking the next few Services as I said I
[46:57] want to just entitle this how do I find
[47:00] God's will for my life and this is a
[47:02] massive top Johnson and Calgary like
[47:05] nine services in on this and he hasn't
[47:07] finished it yet and take I think one or
[47:10] or two Services probably on it and so we
[47:13] we we won't hit the depths of it
[47:15] certainly but we want to pre in the in
[47:17] the perspective of adoption because we
[47:20] can look at adoption and the placing of
[47:22] children we say well what's the will of
[47:24] God have to do with that the will of God
[47:25] has everything to do with adoption
[47:27] in fact you cannot come into adoption
[47:29] unless you learn how to find the will of
[47:31] God that's what is that's what makes
[47:32] known an adopted child is when they can
[47:34] find the will of God and they can stay
[47:36] stay in it amen so we've got to be able
[47:38] to find God's will for our lives and we
[47:40] see here even as we've read we're going
[47:42] to talk tonight about the general the
[47:44] big picture the prophetic view if you
[47:46] want to look at it this way and then on
[47:47] Sunday Lord willing down to where the
[47:49] rubber meets the road and our day-to-day
[47:52] lives but we see here that Paul talks
[47:54] about the revealing of the mystery of
[47:55] God and in verse five he talked about
[47:57] adoption and then now he down into verse
[48:00] 9 he says having made known unto us the
[48:02] mystery of his will according to his
[48:04] good pleasure where he already told us
[48:05] what that was he says having
[48:07] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[48:09] children according to the good pleasure
[48:10] of his will his will is to bring us into
[48:13] spiritual maturity amen John would say
[48:15] in third John he said that what I would
[48:17] that thou wouldest prosper and be in
[48:19] good health even as what even as thy
[48:22] soul prospers amen the the purpose of
[48:25] God is to bring us to spiritual maturity
[48:27] it is to bring us into what we are
[48:29] supposed to be as children of God as
[48:31] Sons and Daughters of God and so in
[48:33] doing that we've got to be able to find
[48:35] God's will adoption hinges on finding
[48:37] God's purpose and God's will for our
[48:39] lives and so we've got to be able to
[48:40] find it we've got to learn how do I find
[48:42] God's Will and then when we find it
[48:44] we've got to learn how to stick with it
[48:46] amen we've got to learn that once God
[48:47] shows us what he wants done we don't
[48:49] move off that for anybody though Paul
[48:51] said remember though any like to have
[48:53] been there with him wouldn't you now he
[48:55] said he has made known to us a mystery
[48:58] remember it cannot be taught in any
[49:00] Seminary it's a mystery you cannot by
[49:04] theology you cannot know it just by good
[49:06] message teaching if I could put it that
[49:08] way but it's a personal revelation to
[49:11] you of what God wants done in your life
[49:13] he says it's a mystery that's been
[49:15] hidden since the foundation of the world
[49:17] waiting for the manifestation of the
[49:20] sons of God so the mystery of God's will
[49:23] is dependent upon us coming into
[49:25] maturity it's all all tied together
[49:27] adoption and his will because his will
[49:29] is for us to come into adoption and in
[49:31] there we start to do the Greater Works
[49:33] which is the Fulfillment of Christ uh
[49:36] Christ's Ministry in this day then he
[49:39] says now tell me my brother tell me my
[49:41] sister when was the time that the sons
[49:44] of God were ever to be manifested
[49:46] outside of this time now when was there
[49:48] ever a time in history they were to
[49:50] manifest the time to deliver all Nature
[49:52] Nature Nature itself is groaning waiting
[49:55] for the time of manifest station why
[49:57] before the atona was made before the
[49:59] Holy Ghost was ever poured out before
[50:01] all the Old Testament on down there
[50:03] there couldn't have been manifestations
[50:06] they couldn't have the full
[50:07] manifestation of the sons of God in
[50:09] those days he says it had to wait till
[50:12] this time you're in a very special time
[50:16] tonight Church you're in a time when God
[50:18] is looking to fulfill the totality of
[50:20] his word to the Gentile
[50:22] bride he says now all things have been
[50:25] brought coming shaping up to a headstone
[50:28] to the manifestation of sons of God
[50:30] coming back and the spirit of God coming
[50:32] into these men so perfectly until their
[50:36] ministry will be so close like Christ
[50:40] till it will join him and his church
[50:43] together now catch that says their
[50:45] ministry will be so close what a
[50:47] statement what a promise their Ministry
[50:50] this is a multi-member bride he's
[50:52] talking about it's not just a prophet
[50:55] it's not just the men that are in the
[50:57] fivefold ministry but this is the
[50:59] complete Ministry of the Bride in this
[51:01] age that he's talking about but we can
[51:04] take something like that and we can look
[51:05] at it and we can stare at it and we can
[51:07] make it so big that it becomes Pie in
[51:10] the Sky for us it's unobtainable it's
[51:13] unachievable how in the world could we
[51:15] ever have a Ministry you mothers you
[51:18] sisters maybe say how can I have a
[51:20] Ministry like Christ I'm not even a man
[51:23] but he says their ministry will be so
[51:25] close like Christ till it will join him
[51:27] and his church together amen it's a body
[51:30] of Believers coming into Union with
[51:33] Christ but we can put these things so
[51:35] high that they that that we can't even
[51:37] comprehend how we get into that but if
[51:39] we want to look at us continuing the
[51:41] works of Christ we have to look at what
[51:43] the works of Christ were and remember we
[51:46] talked about this earlier so I'm not
[51:48] going to dwell on it too much today but
[51:50] his Works were to fulfill the word of
[51:52] God that were written about him that's
[51:55] what it means to continue the work of
[51:56] Christ is not to go out and do what he
[51:58] did he turned the water into wine he
[52:01] raised the dead yes he healed the sick
[52:03] he walked on water he did all of these
[52:05] things but that's what was written of
[52:07] him that's what was shown to him that's
[52:09] what was revealed to him so it was for
[52:11] him to do that doesn't mean that's for
[52:14] me to do there are elements of that that
[52:16] as a minister I'm told to do and that
[52:19] means it's part of God's will for my
[52:20] life but God has not called me to walk
[52:22] on the water but if he does call me to
[52:25] walk on the water he'll get Give Me
[52:26] Faith to do it and he'll change all of
[52:28] nature to make it happen because he
[52:30] obligates himself to his word and he
[52:32] will not give you his will without a
[52:34] means to Pro to to fulfill his will he's
[52:36] not a God that leaves us hanging amen
[52:39] he'll provide a way for us to do these
[52:41] things Jesus was ordained to do one
[52:43] thing we're ordained to do something and
[52:45] his was to show the potential of God in
[52:48] flesh but it was the full potential
[52:51] there was no limitation on him I've only
[52:52] got a portion you've only got a portion
[52:54] and the works are commensurate with the
[52:56] portion he's given and the role that
[52:58] he's given us amen but his purpose was
[53:01] to do the father's will that was what he
[53:04] was there to do that's the key if you're
[53:06] going to have a Ministry like Jesus
[53:08] Christ you've got to be able to find the
[53:10] will of God for your life that's all of
[53:13] this amen but I want to set a General
[53:15] tone this morning because the the will
[53:18] of God is first and foremost to have the
[53:20] preeminence in his bride remember
[53:22] brother Bram in the Christ is the
[53:24] mystery of God revealed he said it was
[53:25] Christ to reveal or God to reveal
[53:27] himself in Christ and then to have the
[53:29] preeminence as in his bride and then to
[53:32] restore us to our un condition his will
[53:34] for this age is for him to have the
[53:36] preeminence in my life and in your life
[53:38] that's what he's trying to do is get the
[53:40] preeminence amen and the that means that
[53:42] the littlest the youngest the weakest
[53:45] Christian in here can have a Ministry
[53:47] just like Jesus Christ purely by finding
[53:49] the will of God for their life that's
[53:51] what it comes down to it doesn't have to
[53:54] be rocket science if you can find the
[53:56] will of God you can walk in confidence
[53:58] because what's going to happen is every
[54:00] time that we come up to something when
[54:02] we stand on the will of God Satan comes
[54:04] behind it to try and knock us off our
[54:06] pins try to take us off our foundation
[54:08] and we've got to be able to stand there
[54:10] and say I know that this is his will
[54:12] because when the storm comes up you've
[54:13] got to have an anchor and the anchor is
[54:15] I'm standing on his will which is his
[54:17] word
[54:19] amen now brother brandham will continue
[54:21] in this adoption number four series and
[54:24] he does something really strange because
[54:25] he's talking about the mystery of God
[54:28] being revealed to the children of God
[54:30] and then he just takes his corner and he
[54:31] turns and he starts talking about
[54:33] melchisedek and Abraham and and he jumps
[54:35] into David and it just seems like it's
[54:37] unrelated but I want to read it as we we
[54:39] set a tone here this evening and then he
[54:42] says now that's Abraham returning now
[54:44] from the slaughter of the kings came
[54:46] back on his rad back bringing back lot
[54:50] all the people that have been taken away
[54:52] and he says
[54:53] all because a child of God in their
[54:56] position is all about souls it's all
[54:58] about preservation of life amen
[55:00] Abraham's not just running around with
[55:02] blessings for himself but being under
[55:04] the blessings of God it gets extended to
[55:06] those that are under Abraham's care and
[55:09] concern amen he says like David what did
[55:12] David do he took the little slingshot
[55:14] went out and grabbed this little lamb
[55:16] out of the lion's mouth think of a
[55:17] slingshot going after a lamb who in the
[55:20] world would do that he says tell me what
[55:22] man in here will do and raise up your
[55:23] hand I'll tell you right quick you're
[55:25] wrong you don't put mine up no I
[55:27] wouldn't go after him with a 30 out 6
[55:29] hardly he wouldn't go after him with a
[55:30] high-powered rifle line but he says
[55:32] David went out with a
[55:34] slingshot he says but he went after him
[55:37] with a slingshot a little piece of
[55:38] leather two strings on it wind it around
[55:42] and when it come time for Goliath to
[55:43] make his boast he went after Goliath and
[55:46] said the god of Heaven has led me
[55:48] deliver a lamb out of the mouth of a
[55:49] lion and out of the mouth of a bear he
[55:52] knew it wasn't a
[55:54] slingshot see we're talking about
[55:56] adoption in the mystery of his will
[55:58] we've got to realize this is not about
[56:00] me this is not in my strength this is
[56:03] not in my power it's not in my intellect
[56:05] it's not in my study but it's in
[56:08] something and it's a revelation that I'm
[56:10] with God and therefore God is with me he
[56:12] says it wasn't the slingshot it was the
[56:15] power of God that went with him he was
[56:19] the one that brought the land back it
[56:21] wasn't David that got that land back it
[56:23] was Christ working through David that
[56:25] brought that land back then then that
[56:27] went and killed that lion that killed
[56:28] that bear when it turned on him he says
[56:31] that's what we say today God's got David
[56:34] sticking around yes sir that's feeding
[56:36] the father's sheep and once in a while a
[56:38] tumor will come or a cancer will come or
[56:40] something and jump Plum out of the hands
[56:42] of the doctor that won't stop that David
[56:45] he'll go right on out there after that
[56:46] fellow with a little slingshot of ask
[56:49] anything in my name and it shall be
[56:51] given I don't care the doctors can laugh
[56:54] everyone can make fun of him he'll go go
[56:56] after him anyhow and bring that sheep
[56:58] back to the fold yes sir he'll say he's
[57:00] God's child take your hand off of him
[57:03] knock this lion down then the lion rose
[57:05] up and he grabbed him by the beard and
[57:07] killed him a little bitty Ruddy boy
[57:10] probably weighed 80 or 90 lbs what's the
[57:13] point he's making it's not about how big
[57:16] you are it's not about how great you are
[57:18] it's not about everything you've done
[57:20] but it's whether or not you're in the
[57:21] will of God Amen if you stay there then
[57:24] it's not about you it's the behind you
[57:26] that's going to make the difference in
[57:28] these things he says notice this MDC as
[57:31] soon as he met Abraham coming from the
[57:32] slaughter of the Kings he says the
[57:35] mystery of God now being made known who
[57:38] was he nobody they can't find any
[57:40] history of him because he didn't have
[57:41] any father he didn't have any mother he
[57:44] never never had any time he began he
[57:46] never had any time he'd ever die so
[57:48] whoever he was is still alive he never
[57:51] did have a beginning so he couldn't have
[57:53] been nobody else but L El him
[57:56] self-existing self abiding almighty God
[58:00] God came to Abraham and met him on the
[58:02] road he said Jesus had a father Jesus
[58:05] had a mother Jesus had a beginning of
[58:07] days Jesus had an ending of Earthly life
[58:09] but this man had neither father nor
[58:11] mother amen no father or mother Jesus
[58:14] had both father and mother this man had
[58:16] neither amen and what did he do after
[58:18] the battle was over after Abraham had
[58:21] took his
[58:23] position we're talking about the mystery
[58:25] of his as well we're talking about
[58:27] adoption he says after the church takes
[58:29] its position we're called to the
[58:31] adoption of sons by the Holy
[58:35] Spirit he says and when each man takes
[58:38] his position what God has called him to
[58:42] do and stand to the end of the road
[58:46] going after the
[58:48] Lost adoption is about souls it's about
[58:52] preservation of life it's about putting
[58:54] the Dominion of God over the Dominion of
[58:56] Satan it's taking back what belonged to
[59:00] you that's what this is about and he
[59:02] says when he stands in his position and
[59:05] he's not standing out there saying I'm
[59:07] blessed of God I've got all this money
[59:09] I've got all these sheep I've got all
[59:10] these cattle lot made a bad decision
[59:13] it's on him no he took all of his
[59:15] servants and he said let's go get lot
[59:17] lot can't help himself let's go help lot
[59:20] let's preserve his life peradventure he
[59:22] will come back around to what he needs
[59:24] to believe amen put himself out there
[59:27] for that and then brother R steps into
[59:29] this beautiful quote he says now this
[59:31] may just choke you to death he says but
[59:34] did you know that men that are sons of
[59:37] God are amateur
[59:39] Gods Hallelujah this evening you're an
[59:42] amateure God if you are a child of God
[59:44] that's born of the Holy Spirit he says
[59:46] how many know that Jesus said so Jesus
[59:48] said did not your law say itself that
[59:50] you are gods and if you call them Gods
[59:52] who the word came to is what it means he
[59:54] says when God said in Genesis 2 that
[59:56] they were Gods because they were they
[59:59] had full domain over the Dominion of the
[1:00:01] world he gave them dominion over all
[1:00:03] things but he lost his godship he lost
[1:00:06] his sunship he lost his domain and Satan
[1:00:09] took it over God's will is for us to
[1:00:11] take it back that's what he's talking
[1:00:14] about here he says but brother we are
[1:00:16] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:00:18] sons of God who will come back and take
[1:00:21] it over again waiting for the fullness
[1:00:23] of time when the pyramid gets up to to
[1:00:26] the top when the false sons of God will
[1:00:28] be manifested when the power of God will
[1:00:31] walk out and will take every Power that
[1:00:34] Satan's got away from him he says yes
[1:00:38] sir it belongs to him it belongs to you
[1:00:42] brother it belongs to you sister is what
[1:00:44] he's saying God gave it to you in the
[1:00:46] beginning and in this end time in the
[1:00:48] wrap up of the dispensation of the
[1:00:51] Gentile Church he's giving it back to
[1:00:53] his bride to take spiritual dominion
[1:00:55] over Satan we do not take control of the
[1:00:58] Earth this is a spiritual
[1:01:01] warfare we're not going to take over
[1:01:03] politics it doesn't matter who gets in
[1:01:06] as prime minister it doesn't matter who
[1:01:07] wins the US election that is not our
[1:01:10] battle but our battle is to take back
[1:01:12] that which we have lost by Satan that's
[1:01:15] what we're looking for amen he says go
[1:01:18] right back to Genesis to the original
[1:01:20] what is it now the world and nature is
[1:01:22] groaning crying everything's moving what
[1:01:25] for for the manifestation of the sons of
[1:01:28] God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons
[1:01:33] speak and their word is backed he says I
[1:01:36] believe we're on the border of it right
[1:01:38] now yes sir say to this mountain let it
[1:01:41] be so now I want to be very careful here
[1:01:44] as we read this next quote he says
[1:01:46] brother I desire so and so a certain
[1:01:49] thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus
[1:01:52] Christ and he says I give it to you in
[1:01:54] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:56] there's a manifestation oh brother my
[1:01:59] crops are burning up out yonder I
[1:02:01] haven't had any rain I'll send you a
[1:02:03] raining in the name of the Lord and
[1:02:04] there shall come oh waiting groaning all
[1:02:07] nature waiting for the manifestation of
[1:02:09] the sons of God God ordained it at the
[1:02:12] beginning and he gave man the domain but
[1:02:15] see this is where we trip up sometime
[1:02:17] because there's this is an amazing quote
[1:02:19] and and we have a real tendency to dwell
[1:02:22] on this portion of it amen you preach
[1:02:24] that in any convention and people will
[1:02:26] be running and hooping and
[1:02:27] hollering but the problem is is after
[1:02:30] they go out then they start speaking and
[1:02:32] nothing happens and then they get
[1:02:33] disappointed and then they fall away and
[1:02:36] then they start to B doubt their
[1:02:37] relationship they start to doubt their
[1:02:39] experience and they say but the brother
[1:02:41] said if I say it then God will back it
[1:02:43] up this is why I've said in recent
[1:02:46] Services we do not make this message an
[1:02:49] absolute we do not make brother Bram an
[1:02:50] absolute because if you take this quote
[1:02:52] out of context you'll get into a place
[1:02:55] where God won't back you
[1:02:56] up because you've got to take it to the
[1:02:59] absolute and the absolute will put it
[1:03:01] into perfect context so that you can
[1:03:02] take this quote and you can stand on it
[1:03:04] because the word puts it right where it
[1:03:06] needs to be amen that's what the word is
[1:03:09] there to do let's take it back to the
[1:03:11] word because if what happens if people
[1:03:13] won't read the entire message they'll
[1:03:15] take just quotes of it they'll fail time
[1:03:17] and time again because they won't run it
[1:03:19] through the filter of Genesis to
[1:03:20] Revelation what did John say he says
[1:03:23] this is the confidence that we have in
[1:03:26] him how many want to be confident when
[1:03:28] you ask God for something he says here's
[1:03:31] the confidence that if we ask anything
[1:03:34] he heareth
[1:03:36] us no see you got to take everything he
[1:03:40] says Jesus said if you ask anything in
[1:03:43] my name I'll give it to you but you run
[1:03:44] that now through 1 John 5:14 that's a
[1:03:46] very different scripture Now isn't it
[1:03:48] and it cannot contradict you got to take
[1:03:51] it all together and that gives you the
[1:03:53] full recipe to come out with a son and
[1:03:55] daughter of God that's been adopted he
[1:03:57] says if you ask anything according to
[1:04:00] his will he heareth
[1:04:04] us that means he'll listen and then it
[1:04:07] says and if and if we know that he hear
[1:04:10] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[1:04:13] have the petitions that we desired of
[1:04:16] him we have to tie this quote of brother
[1:04:18] Brams back to scripture amen we can't
[1:04:20] take that quote and run with it but we
[1:04:21] run it through this and now we can say
[1:04:24] what is God's will for me
[1:04:27] cuz listen God will put hard times on us
[1:04:29] at times God will use these things to
[1:04:32] produce a certain effect in our life to
[1:04:34] draw us closer to him to show himself
[1:04:37] great to show himself Mighty but also to
[1:04:39] bring us back into line sometimes we've
[1:04:42] got to know what we're doing with these
[1:04:43] things amen what is the key that makes
[1:04:46] that quote from Brother brandham
[1:04:47] absolute the key is if it's according to
[1:04:50] his will that is always what it's going
[1:04:53] to be as if it's according to his will
[1:04:55] because remember what uh Jesus said ask
[1:04:58] abundantly that your joy may be full but
[1:05:00] the thing is to seek what that would
[1:05:02] look like don't limit God by your
[1:05:06] request that's what we do so many times
[1:05:09] Lord I want this certain car Lord I want
[1:05:11] this and that say Lord give me a car and
[1:05:14] whatever he gives you will be the best
[1:05:16] that he could give you sometimes we say
[1:05:18] I want this I want that say Lord this is
[1:05:20] my need would you provide it that's how
[1:05:23] you get above and beyond is because he
[1:05:24] wants to do above Beyond and sometimes
[1:05:26] our request limits him rather than it
[1:05:28] opens him up to do whatever he wants to
[1:05:30] do amen the key to the confidence in
[1:05:34] your prayers and asking God for things
[1:05:36] is in seeking his will first and
[1:05:39] spending that time in doing it amen that
[1:05:41] takes time that takes waiting on God
[1:05:43] that takes that takes putting yourself
[1:05:46] uh aside it takes humbling ourselves it
[1:05:48] takes patience amen when you look at the
[1:05:51] scripture how many times do people have
[1:05:53] to wait for an answer from God time and
[1:05:56] time again time and time again and
[1:06:00] sometimes they've got the promise and
[1:06:01] then they've got to wait on that they
[1:06:02] get the answer but the answer doesn't
[1:06:04] necessarily come into full manifestation
[1:06:06] right then amen it takes dying out to
[1:06:09] self to wait on God that's what it does
[1:06:12] because we're time bound creatures and
[1:06:14] especially in this day and age with all
[1:06:16] the technology we have everything is now
[1:06:18] now now and God says my time my time my
[1:06:20] time that's the way that God works on
[1:06:22] these things amen the greatest thing we
[1:06:25] can ask for is the will of God that is
[1:06:27] the best thing that you can ever ask for
[1:06:29] and if you can sit there and wait on
[1:06:31] that then you'll learn real fast that's
[1:06:33] the way to go through life is in his
[1:06:35] perfect will amen otherwise we get into
[1:06:38] what permissive will and that's balam's
[1:06:40] way permissive will is not the way we
[1:06:42] want to walk we want to find his perfect
[1:06:43] will and stay
[1:06:45] there brother Bram continues and he says
[1:06:49] he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it
[1:06:51] in his name with this assurance ask the
[1:06:54] father anything in my name
[1:06:56] and I'll do it he says it's waiting for
[1:06:58] the manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:07:00] position the church as I said the book
[1:07:03] of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua and
[1:07:06] Joshua is placing the people where they
[1:07:08] belong now if they wouldn't stand still
[1:07:10] and he put Ephraim here and over on
[1:07:12] manasseh's land and this one would come
[1:07:14] back fussing and stewing how they ever
[1:07:16] going to get along when one is saying
[1:07:18] I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a
[1:07:20] Pentecostal I'm Oneness I'm tunist I'm
[1:07:23] thus so and so now we say that doesn't
[1:07:25] apply us well what about when we say
[1:07:27] well I'm brother I go to brother so- and
[1:07:28] so's Church we've got it all this man is
[1:07:32] the best in the business this is the
[1:07:33] greatest preacher in the message this
[1:07:35] one's that it's the same denominational
[1:07:38] attitude it's a body of Believers it's a
[1:07:41] fivefold Ministry and that means there's
[1:07:43] at least five ministers out there that
[1:07:45] have what we need because there's five
[1:07:47] roles you got brother Bram you got four
[1:07:49] others so that means there's got to be
[1:07:50] four god-ordained men out there at the
[1:07:52] very minimum but listen it's a bunch
[1:07:54] there's a bunch of out there most of
[1:07:56] them are just little nobodies and that's
[1:07:58] who God's using in these
[1:08:00] situations he says how are you going to
[1:08:02] do it how are you ever going to get
[1:08:04] along how are you going to ever come
[1:08:06] into this place of adoption how are you
[1:08:07] ever going to come into God's will he
[1:08:09] says stand
[1:08:11] still God is wanting to place his church
[1:08:14] the Sons and Daughters of God he says
[1:08:17] God let me live to live to see it is my
[1:08:19] prayer so close till I can just feel it
[1:08:21] with my hands almost look like it's
[1:08:24] right there he says that's what I've
[1:08:26] longed to see waiting for the time when
[1:08:28] they walk down the street and there lays
[1:08:30] a laying there from his mother
[1:08:31] wombs mother's womb and he says Silver
[1:08:34] and Gold Have I
[1:08:35] None he says oh we're waiting for the
[1:08:38] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:08:40] hallelujah when God will make himself
[1:08:42] known when they'll stop sickness they'll
[1:08:44] stop cancer and they'll stop
[1:08:47] diseases stand still don't run around
[1:08:49] don't chase the latest Doctrine don't
[1:08:51] chase the latest
[1:08:53] fad stand still and look at what has
[1:08:55] been
[1:08:56] proven look at what has been stable
[1:08:59] through all of this how many times I'm
[1:09:01] young in the message but I'm sure
[1:09:02] brother Jerald and brother Mark and
[1:09:04] brother Bob could probably point to
[1:09:06] things that went through you know you
[1:09:07] had the Thunders movement you had the
[1:09:09] two Souls movement you had the this
[1:09:10] movement and that movement and we got
[1:09:12] them
[1:09:13] today and the funny thing is the
[1:09:15] old-timers say that's already been
[1:09:16] through once and it didn't
[1:09:18] work there's nothing new Under the Sun
[1:09:22] but stand and sit on that perfect word
[1:09:25] don't get drawn by emotion don't get
[1:09:27] drawn by movements but stay with what
[1:09:29] has worked with what you've seen stick
[1:09:31] with people through their entire life
[1:09:34] that's why we have older people in this
[1:09:35] church that can show us the consistency
[1:09:37] of staying with the Simplicity of the
[1:09:39] gospel of Christ amen you know I was I
[1:09:43] was thinking his brother Jim was talking
[1:09:45] about this and you know he was talking
[1:09:48] about that that road and you know what
[1:09:50] this place of the will of God is a
[1:09:51] narrow road I had already been studying
[1:09:54] on this and as he was talking you know
[1:09:56] it struck me that that narrow road is a
[1:09:58] separated road because as he read the
[1:10:00] Scripture it says it it it's narrow and
[1:10:02] few there be that find it but wide is
[1:10:05] the way that leadth to destruction all
[1:10:07] the all the traffic's on the way to
[1:10:09] destruction but there's just one here
[1:10:11] and one there that you meet that's on
[1:10:12] that narrow road and why are they there
[1:10:14] it says they find it they're looking for
[1:10:17] it they're seeking it and the scripture
[1:10:19] says seek and you will find knock and
[1:10:21] it'll be open to you it's those people
[1:10:23] that are looking for the will of God and
[1:10:25] for the word of God for their day that's
[1:10:27] the ones that are going to find it cuz
[1:10:28] there's a deep that's calling to the
[1:10:30] deep inside of them that won't be
[1:10:31] satisfied on the wide easy roads amen
[1:10:34] it's not an easy road walking in the
[1:10:36] will of God it's not an easy road
[1:10:37] walking in the word of God but it works
[1:10:39] and it takes you to your destination
[1:10:41] Amen brother BR would say this he says
[1:10:44] you know the easy Road's not always the
[1:10:46] best road the best road is find the will
[1:10:50] of God and then travel
[1:10:52] it he says amen that's right find the
[1:10:54] will of God no matter how hard it is
[1:10:57] just raise up your hand and say I'll
[1:10:58] take the way with the Lord's despised
[1:11:01] few started in with Jesus now Lord I'm
[1:11:04] going through he's repeating that song
[1:11:06] you know Abraham got into trouble when
[1:11:08] he left what God told him to do it was a
[1:11:11] hard Road he left when there was a
[1:11:13] famine he left when there wasn't water
[1:11:14] he left when there was fighting and all
[1:11:16] he had to do was stay with what God told
[1:11:19] him to do and God would have taken care
[1:11:20] of him God blessed Abraham in a place
[1:11:23] where everybody else wasn't having the
[1:11:24] same BL blessings he prospered when
[1:11:26] nobody else was prospering and yet he
[1:11:28] walked away when circumstances got bad
[1:11:30] and every problem we have in the Middle
[1:11:32] East comes from Abraham trying to get
[1:11:34] out of God's will not trying to get out
[1:11:35] of will but actually getting out of it
[1:11:38] trying to make it happen himself trying
[1:11:39] to take care of himself it's not an easy
[1:11:42] road but it's a road that leads you to a
[1:11:43] promised destination
[1:11:45] amen God said walk around in the land
[1:11:48] I've given to you see what it's all
[1:11:50] about Abraham this is what I've given to
[1:11:51] you it's for your children stay there
[1:11:53] stay there until I give you the promise
[1:11:55] child and he dart out and then he come
[1:11:56] back in he dart out and get in trouble
[1:11:58] and then come back in stay with the path
[1:12:01] that God has shown you so we've read all
[1:12:04] this to set up the question what is
[1:12:06] God's will for us today and we're
[1:12:08] talking big picture God's will for us
[1:12:10] today is comeing to a place of adoption
[1:12:12] Amen to manifest the word Christ in our
[1:12:15] daytoday lives it's a day-by-day walk
[1:12:18] it's a day-by-day victory it's to
[1:12:20] overcome the age Rin it's to hold on to
[1:12:22] the word that we've been given hold fast
[1:12:24] to that which we've been given amen and
[1:12:26] to give God the preeminence in our
[1:12:29] lives but then within that we each have
[1:12:31] a role as Holy Ghost filled Believers
[1:12:33] and that's our day-to-day job it's it's
[1:12:35] the responsibility it's the authority
[1:12:37] we've been given in the body of Christ
[1:12:39] and your adopted position as we've
[1:12:40] talked about may be as a mother it may
[1:12:43] be as a wife it may be as a minister it
[1:12:45] may be as a song leader it may be as a
[1:12:47] help it may be to have one of the gifts
[1:12:49] of the Spirit in the local body it may
[1:12:51] be Outreach it may be inreach it may be
[1:12:53] Hospitality all all these things but in
[1:12:57] it there's a a leading that has to
[1:12:59] happen this is one thing that my mom
[1:13:02] taught me my mom is generous she's a
[1:13:04] giver and she taught me that you don't
[1:13:06] just give because there's a need you
[1:13:08] don't just do because you can but you're
[1:13:10] to be led in how you do it and when you
[1:13:12] do it and to whom you do it amen and I
[1:13:15] think the older ones here probably know
[1:13:16] that better than some of us younger ones
[1:13:17] we're still learning these things amen
[1:13:19] but how we spend our time our actions
[1:13:21] how we spend our money where we go the
[1:13:23] Ministries we sit under the Ministries
[1:13:25] we bring in who our friends are what
[1:13:27] relationships we have what we say what
[1:13:29] we don't say that's a dayby day
[1:13:31] overcoming and it's a day byday seeking
[1:13:33] of the will of God for our lives
[1:13:37] amen Paul would say this he says ye are
[1:13:41] bought with a price therefore glorify
[1:13:44] God in your body and in your spirit
[1:13:47] which are Gods we can't do that in our
[1:13:50] own self the carnal thoughts the carnal
[1:13:53] nature that's here to find the will of
[1:13:55] God it will never match up with those
[1:13:57] but if we can seek and say Lord I know
[1:13:59] your way is the best way and we can
[1:14:01] daily put this aside and say Lord I want
[1:14:04] your will I want your way today and keep
[1:14:06] that in the front of our mind then
[1:14:08] that's when God can work with us amen
[1:14:11] why because we've learned to trust that
[1:14:13] his way is the best way for our lives
[1:14:15] amen David would say this in Psalms show
[1:14:18] me thy ways oh Lord teach me thy paths
[1:14:22] Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for
[1:14:25] thou art the god of my salvation on thee
[1:14:28] do I wait all the
[1:14:35] day I wait on
[1:14:38] him half the struggle is the wait isn't
[1:14:42] it if you've ever sought God and had to
[1:14:44] wait you know that's the trial of your
[1:14:45] faith is the waiting period he says but
[1:14:48] I'll wait on the all day he says the
[1:14:50] meek will he guide in judgment and the
[1:14:53] meek will he teach his way all the paths
[1:14:56] of the Lord are mercy and
[1:14:59] truth it's a good path mercy and Truth
[1:15:03] unto such as keep his Covenant and his
[1:15:06] testimony you know I was thinking about
[1:15:07] that and I thought sometimes the truth
[1:15:09] hurts we think because it's God it's
[1:15:11] always going to be good in a lovey-dovey
[1:15:14] Feelgood way but we are talking about
[1:15:16] this at the supper table today that
[1:15:18] sometimes the mercy and the and the love
[1:15:20] of God and the truth of God is that he
[1:15:21] opens our eyes to our present condition
[1:15:25] amen how many times reading my Bible and
[1:15:28] devotions and I read something and I say
[1:15:31] oh my goodness Lord that's me that's my
[1:15:35] attitude that's the way I'm thinking
[1:15:38] come on now come on you can sit there
[1:15:41] and
[1:15:42] you when you read your Bible if all you
[1:15:45] can think about is somebody else in that
[1:15:47] scripture then you're reading your Bible
[1:15:48] wrong amen amen the we are changed by
[1:15:53] the washing of the water of the word me
[1:15:55] reading the word doesn't change somebody
[1:15:57] else it changes me and I've got a
[1:16:00] serious attitude problem if all I can
[1:16:02] think about is somebody else whenever I
[1:16:03] read my Bible this is supposed to be
[1:16:06] changing me it's supposed to be aligning
[1:16:08] me it's supposed to be bringing me into
[1:16:10] a reflection of Christ in my day-to-day
[1:16:12] life
[1:16:13] amen and so I say God forgive me amen
[1:16:17] that's there's a repentance that comes
[1:16:19] with reading this book because when I
[1:16:20] compare the carnality that I have with
[1:16:23] this it falls short so many times and so
[1:16:25] there's a daily repentance when I come
[1:16:27] in and read my Bible because I say Lord
[1:16:29] I don't see that right now in certain
[1:16:31] areas of my life don't get buried in
[1:16:34] that cuz Satan will do that to you but
[1:16:35] amen when we see that say Lord lift me
[1:16:37] up and let me stand a higher plane than
[1:16:40] I found to to date in my in my
[1:16:42] relationship with Christ amen David was
[1:16:44] all about finding the will of God and he
[1:16:47] was known for perfect leadership and
[1:16:50] it's because he went in and he didn't
[1:16:52] leave until he found the will of God and
[1:16:54] he would not move until he knew what God
[1:16:56] wanted him to do amen David wasn't just
[1:16:58] a a a battle Warrior he was a prayer
[1:17:00] Warrior and that's what made him a great
[1:17:02] warrior when it came to battles amen he
[1:17:04] didn't just wait on God to come to him
[1:17:06] he sought
[1:17:08] God sometimes we're waiting for God to
[1:17:10] come to us no let's seek him cuz when we
[1:17:12] seek him that's when we find him and
[1:17:14] when we're knocking that's when he opens
[1:17:16] up the door of his will amen why was
[1:17:18] David always in prayer because the
[1:17:21] situations that look so similar are
[1:17:23] often completely different the root
[1:17:25] issue the underlying problem the thing
[1:17:28] that's going on there is so different
[1:17:30] many times you run up against one person
[1:17:32] with a temper you can't treat them the
[1:17:33] same as the next one with a temper one
[1:17:35] of them might be hormones the next one
[1:17:37] might be family issues the next one
[1:17:39] might be Financial issues the next one
[1:17:40] might be just they cold and bitter
[1:17:42] because they haven't had time in the
[1:17:43] Lord's
[1:17:44] presence and you got to treat every
[1:17:46] single one of those people differently
[1:17:48] and that comes by prayer that comes by
[1:17:49] seeking and we see this in 2 Samuel when
[1:17:52] David's dealing with the Philistines
[1:17:53] David's anointed to kill Philistines
[1:17:55] Church there's no doubt we're anointed
[1:17:57] to overcome Satan's Dominion but how we
[1:18:00] do it comes by
[1:18:03] leadership and listen to this it says
[1:18:05] when the Philistines heard that they had
[1:18:06] anointed David King over Israel all the
[1:18:08] Philistines came up to seek David and
[1:18:11] David heard of it and went down to the
[1:18:12] hold the Philistines also came and
[1:18:14] spread themselves in the valley of reim
[1:18:17] and David inquired of the Lord saying
[1:18:19] shall I go up to the Philistines and
[1:18:22] wilt thou deliver them under mine hand
[1:18:24] see David's checking
[1:18:27] up David's saying God are you with
[1:18:30] me David had moments where God wasn't
[1:18:33] with them remember when he numbered the
[1:18:35] people when he's down in
[1:18:37] fisa and he's got to pretend to be he a
[1:18:40] crazy man to get away from that it's
[1:18:42] God's grace he got out but it wasn't
[1:18:44] God's will he was in when he did those
[1:18:45] things David's learned I got to check up
[1:18:48] yes I'm I'm anointed for my position but
[1:18:50] I've got to stay close to God and sayl
[1:18:52] are you with me in this
[1:18:56] we cannot
[1:18:57] presume say Lord are you with me it
[1:19:00] said' and the Lord said unto David go up
[1:19:02] for I will doubtless deliver the
[1:19:04] Philistines into thine hand and David
[1:19:07] came to B peris them and David smote
[1:19:09] them there this was a straight up battle
[1:19:11] two armies head-to-head standard Warfare
[1:19:14] and he beats them and David said the
[1:19:16] Lord ha broken forth upon mine enemies
[1:19:18] before me as the breach of waters like a
[1:19:20] dam burst he says it just destroy them
[1:19:23] blew them away in front of me he says
[1:19:25] therefore he called the name of that
[1:19:26] place Bel parison it says and there they
[1:19:29] left their images and David and his men
[1:19:31] burned them then the Philistines came up
[1:19:34] yet again and spread themselves in the
[1:19:35] valley of reim church it's the exact
[1:19:38] same enemy in the exact same place doing
[1:19:41] the exact same thing now we would say
[1:19:44] David go up you've been here before
[1:19:46] God's With You Go destroy them no
[1:19:48] David's a Son of God what does he do he
[1:19:52] says sons of God are led by the spirit
[1:19:53] of God God I'm going to check with you
[1:19:56] I'm not going to presume I'm not going
[1:19:57] to assume it's the same as last time
[1:20:00] amen it's easier to find God's will than
[1:20:02] to learn afterwards that you paid a
[1:20:03] price you didn't have
[1:20:05] to he says and when David inquired of
[1:20:08] the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up
[1:20:11] don't do it the way you did it before in
[1:20:13] other words you got to fight this battle
[1:20:15] differently he says but fetch a compass
[1:20:17] behind them and come upon them over
[1:20:19] against the mulberry trees God tells
[1:20:21] them to set an ambush and hide in the
[1:20:23] mulberry trees he says and let it be
[1:20:25] when thou hearest the sound of a Goin In
[1:20:27] the tops of the mulberry trees that thou
[1:20:29] shalt bester thyself for then for then
[1:20:32] and only then shall God go out before
[1:20:34] thee to Smite the host of the
[1:20:36] Philistines David's got to wait for a
[1:20:38] sound of marching and stirring in the
[1:20:40] trees and then when he hears that then
[1:20:41] he's supposed to go out and Ambush them
[1:20:43] and God will God will give the enemy
[1:20:44] over to him in battle it says and David
[1:20:47] did so as the Lord had commanded him and
[1:20:50] he smot the Philistines from giba until
[1:20:52] Thou come to
[1:20:53] gazer see the first time he destroyed
[1:20:55] them there the next one he not only
[1:20:57] destroys them but he chases them right
[1:20:58] back into their own
[1:20:59] country same people same enemy same
[1:21:03] place different tactics different result
[1:21:06] a victory but a greater Victory why
[1:21:08] because he sought God's
[1:21:10] leadership
[1:21:13] amen we can't presume based on our
[1:21:16] experience that we know what to do every
[1:21:18] time amen it's that day toay checking up
[1:21:22] with God to ask for his provision to ask
[1:21:24] ask for his guidance to ask for his
[1:21:26] Direction his leadership ask for his
[1:21:28] attitude am me how hard is it every day
[1:21:32] my wife shared a story and I won't share
[1:21:33] it because I don't you know I didn't ask
[1:21:35] her permission beforehand but how hard
[1:21:37] is it sometimes to project that right
[1:21:39] attitude in a
[1:21:40] situation when you know you're going
[1:21:42] into potential conflict when you know
[1:21:45] that you're going to have a certain
[1:21:47] conversation say Lord help me to speak
[1:21:49] with your love and your attitude and
[1:21:51] bring your approach to this situation
[1:21:54] cuz with some people you have to be firm
[1:21:55] and stand your ground and with some
[1:21:58] people You' got to be soft and
[1:22:01] meek and then there's all sorts of a
[1:22:03] spectrum in between those things amen
[1:22:05] but like I said earlier when you make a
[1:22:07] Godly decision Satan's going to come
[1:22:08] after you with guns blazing and so you
[1:22:11] got to be prepared in the Lord for how
[1:22:13] you're going to defeat him because
[1:22:14] remember we wrestle not against flesh
[1:22:16] and blood this is spiritual warfare and
[1:22:19] we can't go at it the way our friends do
[1:22:21] it we can't go do it the way that people
[1:22:23] at work do we can't do it the way that a
[1:22:25] psychologist
[1:22:27] would you ever have somebody try
[1:22:29] psychology on you it just makes you more
[1:22:31] mad if you know what they're trying to
[1:22:33] do but when you can approach it the way
[1:22:35] that God knows to do it comes out right
[1:22:37] every time amen and you can walk away
[1:22:40] saying Lord I did your will otherwise
[1:22:42] what you don't have faith in where
[1:22:43] you're standing and you just get run
[1:22:45] Pillar To Post and they run you right
[1:22:46] out of the room we've got to find his
[1:22:49] will but look what Jesus key was we
[1:22:51] talked about this and we're going to
[1:22:52] settle down here for the last quarter of
[1:22:54] the service he says I can of my own self
[1:22:56] do nothing he said but as I hear I
[1:23:02] judge my judgment is just he says why
[1:23:07] because I seek not mine own will but the
[1:23:09] will of the Father which has sent me
[1:23:13] Jesus Faith was in knowing that he had
[1:23:15] found the father's will for each and
[1:23:17] every situation and he says I'm
[1:23:19] confident in what I'm saying I'm
[1:23:21] confident in my judgment I'm confident
[1:23:23] in my actions I'm confident in my
[1:23:24] reactions I'm confident in the things I
[1:23:27] do and say why because I took the time
[1:23:29] to seek and find God's will amen he
[1:23:33] didn't seek to inject himself into the
[1:23:35] situation I'm the Son of God I should
[1:23:37] just do this I no no no this was flesh
[1:23:40] and subjection to the spirit of God and
[1:23:42] it's no different than you and I it's
[1:23:44] flesh in subjection to the spirit of God
[1:23:47] we just have the sinful part that he
[1:23:48] didn't amen but he was seeking the will
[1:23:50] of God for him every day you know we
[1:23:52] Face tough situations and and if we let
[1:23:54] it happen we can get our backs up and we
[1:23:57] can get pushy and we can get prickly and
[1:23:59] we can get defensive and we can get run
[1:24:02] all over the place amen but if we can
[1:24:04] set ourselves aside and say God this is
[1:24:06] in your hands I'm your child I'm walking
[1:24:10] in your will day by day as best I know
[1:24:12] how and so my life is in your hands this
[1:24:14] circumstance this conversation whatever
[1:24:17] it is that we're seeking lord it's in
[1:24:20] your hands and stand there and just
[1:24:22] project his love
[1:24:25] every time amen what that gives us a
[1:24:28] supernatural confidence when you know
[1:24:31] that you're walking with him it ought to
[1:24:32] give us confidence that no matter what
[1:24:34] the situation is there's a victory to be
[1:24:36] won and there's a testimony to be given
[1:24:39] amen he doesn't bring us in to lose he
[1:24:41] brings us in to win but remember what we
[1:24:43] said before winning is not about you
[1:24:46] it's about the soul it's about what
[1:24:48] bringing that person into a place where
[1:24:50] they could potentially receive eternal
[1:24:52] life but you know the other thing I was
[1:24:54] thinking on this sometimes that tough
[1:24:56] situation is Temptation and the
[1:24:57] Temptation is to make ourselves
[1:25:00] something and I speak this as a minister
[1:25:02] maybe this evening there's that
[1:25:04] temptation to make ourselves spiritual
[1:25:06] to try and make something happen to to
[1:25:08] to make it look like we're a child of
[1:25:10] God to make it look like this because
[1:25:12] there's times I can say this as a
[1:25:13] minister I see situations and you want
[1:25:16] to go over and you just want to take
[1:25:17] care of the situation remember what
[1:25:19] brother BR would say he says I can't
[1:25:20] heal you if I could heal you I'd just go
[1:25:22] out and I'd heal everyone' because our
[1:25:24] human nature is to try and resolve
[1:25:27] situations but God sees all things and
[1:25:30] he has a purpose and a plan and he sees
[1:25:32] the root of the issue and sometimes the
[1:25:34] root of the issue is not the sickness
[1:25:36] it's not the depression it's not the
[1:25:38] lack of money but there's a spiritual
[1:25:40] issue that he's trying to produce in
[1:25:42] that person's he's trying to get rid of
[1:25:44] and he's trying to bring them to a place
[1:25:45] where they're closer to him and they can
[1:25:47] he can deliver them from that thing
[1:25:48] that's causing them those issues the
[1:25:50] issue sometimes is not sickness it's a
[1:25:51] heart issue it's a spirit issue
[1:25:55] been there done that still getting it
[1:25:57] done to me Church the issue is not that
[1:25:59] I need an answer to my prayer the answer
[1:26:00] is I need Deliverance first and then
[1:26:02] he'll give me what I have need
[1:26:04] of anden I'll pray for anyone anytime
[1:26:07] but it's like I said before my prayer
[1:26:09] may be a little different than what you
[1:26:10] were expecting because I've got to
[1:26:12] follow the leadership of God in those
[1:26:15] situations and until I do I can only
[1:26:17] pray with a certain level of faith and
[1:26:18] confidence I can commit you to him but
[1:26:21] there's a difference between committing
[1:26:22] you to him and speaking the word and
[1:26:24] that takes very very tight leadership
[1:26:26] amen you know sometimes the temptation
[1:26:28] as a believe as a minister is to get the
[1:26:30] people worked up to bring a message
[1:26:32] that'll just do something for the
[1:26:33] congregation to get those quiet new
[1:26:35] finlanders to finally shout and dance
[1:26:37] and run
[1:26:39] around now I'm not a dynamic
[1:26:41] preacher but here's the thing a message
[1:26:43] has to have substance not
[1:26:46] volume come on right it's not about how
[1:26:49] much I yell I was telling brother Mark
[1:26:51] the other day I feel like I'm yelling a
[1:26:52] lot more I'm speaking more and I don't
[1:26:54] know what it is because I used to be so
[1:26:55] relaxed behind the pulpit now it's it's
[1:26:58] not so relaxed you know but I'm not
[1:27:00] yelling for the sake of yelling I'm
[1:27:02] yelling because there's something in me
[1:27:03] that makes me
[1:27:04] yell amen but here's the thing if I
[1:27:08] preach a message that makes you feel
[1:27:09] good then what's going to happen
[1:27:11] tomorrow is Satan's going to preach you
[1:27:12] a message that makes you feel bad and
[1:27:14] he'll take the victory right out from
[1:27:15] under you amen but what we have to do is
[1:27:17] preach something that will actually do
[1:27:19] something for you and in you and that
[1:27:21] comes by inspired preaching of the the
[1:27:24] word of God Amen brother Bram dealt with
[1:27:27] this he says now you can imagine the
[1:27:29] responsibility to speak to a group that
[1:27:31] would lay on to every word you say and
[1:27:34] then you'll have to answer for what you
[1:27:35] told them at the day of judgment brother
[1:27:37] randam could say go out and wear a
[1:27:39] purple pants the rest of your life and
[1:27:41] there's people would do
[1:27:42] it CU he was their
[1:27:45] absolute they wouldn't go look at the
[1:27:47] word and say where is that they do
[1:27:49] whatever he said there's a an authority
[1:27:52] that comes with the ministry that we
[1:27:53] have to be so careful not to abuse
[1:27:56] absolutely because souls are hanging on
[1:27:58] it and when I start to use it for my
[1:28:00] benefit rather than yours it's
[1:28:03] satanic that's hard but it's true I'm
[1:28:05] here to serve above all things he says
[1:28:09] because through that little humble
[1:28:11] Ministry it gives people Faith to know
[1:28:13] that a human being cannot do these
[1:28:15] things he says it has to come from God
[1:28:17] therefore that they lay on to every word
[1:28:19] that you say so I never try to build
[1:28:22] something thinking or writing down
[1:28:23] script scriptures and notes that it
[1:28:25] would be something that would I that
[1:28:26] would make the people all elated he's
[1:28:29] saying I don't bring a message to work
[1:28:32] the people
[1:28:33] up he says see I try to pray and to
[1:28:37] think of something that would be
[1:28:39] constructive to you that would help you
[1:28:43] cuz remember what was his problem with
[1:28:45] Pentecost is whatever they get they blew
[1:28:47] out of their Smoke Stack during the
[1:28:48] service and when they walked out they
[1:28:49] had no Victory the rest of the week you
[1:28:51] need something to dwell on you need
[1:28:53] something to chew on you need something
[1:28:54] that's got some real protein in it not
[1:28:57] just the feeling of the word but you
[1:28:58] need the reality of the word amen I
[1:29:01] can't preach for reaction I need to
[1:29:02] preach for Revelation that's really what
[1:29:04] we're talking about amen we got to be so
[1:29:07] careful how we do that I can't focus on
[1:29:11] response how you talk how you might
[1:29:14] shout or stand up or Bellow amen or
[1:29:16] hallelujah or something that's not what
[1:29:18] we're looking for we're looking for a
[1:29:20] settled heart on the word of God that's
[1:29:23] what we need because that's what's going
[1:29:24] to hold you tomorrow when the feeling of
[1:29:26] your salvation when the when the joy of
[1:29:28] it walks away when Satan's knocking on
[1:29:30] your door with sickness or Temptation or
[1:29:32] torment or these things you need
[1:29:34] something that's been settled in your
[1:29:35] heart not something that's been settled
[1:29:37] in your emotions amen you know I was
[1:29:40] talking to a brother and he's one of the
[1:29:42] best known ministers and one of the
[1:29:43] greatest preachers in this message I do
[1:29:45] believe very popular and he said I've
[1:29:48] got to be careful how I preach because I
[1:29:50] know how to get the people worked up
[1:29:55] he says but that won't do the job I have
[1:29:59] to give them a solid foundation for
[1:30:01] their response because that's what's
[1:30:04] going to do the work is the solid
[1:30:05] foundation of the word of God he says
[1:30:07] and when they respond to the word by the
[1:30:09] Holy Spirit that's something that's
[1:30:11] going to hold them throughout the week I
[1:30:12] had so much respect for him admitting
[1:30:14] that he could do it and then saying and
[1:30:17] I've got to guard against
[1:30:18] it amen because why we're preaching for
[1:30:22] response rather than revelation we can't
[1:30:25] do
[1:30:26] it you know I was I've read through the
[1:30:30] the
[1:30:31] scriptures and we're looking to when we
[1:30:33] see the preaching of the word what's it
[1:30:35] supposed to do Faith cometh by hearing
[1:30:38] we're trying to instill faith in the
[1:30:40] people of God that's the purpose I come
[1:30:42] in here every service and preach is to
[1:30:45] put faith in your heart to inspire the
[1:30:47] word to your life so that you'll take it
[1:30:49] but you know you look at all sorts of
[1:30:51] preachers in the Bible and what I love
[1:30:52] is we have all sorts of them with Moses
[1:30:55] Moses
[1:30:56] stuttered Moses needed somebody else to
[1:30:58] preach for him that's how bad a preacher
[1:31:01] he was and yet the word of God was
[1:31:03] behind him and God he he he was the the
[1:31:05] the the blueprint for Jesus Christ a
[1:31:09] prophet like unto
[1:31:10] Moses and yet he stuttered then you go
[1:31:13] to Jonah the disobedient Prophet but
[1:31:16] such power in his ministry that he
[1:31:18] brought an entire city to
[1:31:20] repentance then you go over to to to
[1:31:23] Peter and John ignorant and
[1:31:27] unlearned their hints and their
[1:31:29] ains amen a great six education from k a
[1:31:33] kid from Kentucky and yet what the power
[1:31:36] of God was behind them in everything
[1:31:38] they said and
[1:31:39] did you look at Jesus the greatest
[1:31:43] anointing ever on a man in this earth
[1:31:46] and he sat down and precious words
[1:31:48] proceeded out of his
[1:31:49] mouth then you look at Paul I just read
[1:31:52] this in in in the Bible this morning and
[1:31:55] he said my words are weighty and
[1:31:59] Powerful Paul was a tremendous
[1:32:02] writer he could have been a
[1:32:06] copywriter and then he says but my
[1:32:10] delivery my preaching and my appearance
[1:32:13] in person is weak and
[1:32:16] contemptible Paul wasn't a good preacher
[1:32:18] in terms of his delivery he was weak and
[1:32:21] contemptible
[1:32:25] then you have Steven powerful convicting
[1:32:29] Fearless to the point that he would
[1:32:31] preach all the way to his dying breath
[1:32:35] you have a whole spectrum of deliveries
[1:32:37] but what's the commonality the spirit of
[1:32:40] God is behind that man that's what makes
[1:32:42] the difference I'd love to be Mr Dynamic
[1:32:45] I truly would but that's never going to
[1:32:48] do the
[1:32:49] job it's finding the will of God for the
[1:32:52] people and him coming behind it and
[1:32:54] vindicating it that's going to do the
[1:32:55] job amen nothing about me
[1:32:58] amen the resting place has to be the
[1:33:00] word of God you can't rest even on my
[1:33:03] experience you got to rest on your own
[1:33:05] experience and then what God's done in
[1:33:07] your life he says
[1:33:10] this okay he says without faith it's
[1:33:14] impossible to please him for he that
[1:33:17] cometh to God Must Believe first that he
[1:33:19] is and you do that by
[1:33:22] experience that you've tasted and seen
[1:33:24] that the Lord is good that you've taken
[1:33:27] him at his word and you see that he
[1:33:29] responds to it and he and he fulfills it
[1:33:31] he says we must believe that he is and
[1:33:34] that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:33:36] diligently seek Him in other words he
[1:33:38] makes it worth your while to seek him
[1:33:39] out it's better to seek him than it is
[1:33:41] to not seek him what you get when you
[1:33:43] seek Him is better than what you get if
[1:33:45] you don't seek him see faith has to have
[1:33:47] a resting place brother brandham said it
[1:33:49] has to have an absolute it has to have a
[1:33:51] foundation and the foundation is not the
[1:33:53] gift of men it's not the the delivery of
[1:33:55] the ministry it's it's not the
[1:33:57] experience of those men but it's solidly
[1:33:59] on that word of God that when they
[1:34:01] preach that word in Simplicity it
[1:34:03] anchors in your heart and deep calls to
[1:34:05] the deep and the Holy Spirit anoints it
[1:34:07] and all of a sudden you've got faith to
[1:34:08] move in your life brother B puts it this
[1:34:11] way he says the son can do nothing in
[1:34:12] himself but what he sees the father
[1:34:14] doing he says it doesn't lay in man to
[1:34:18] do these
[1:34:19] things so don't try and do it in
[1:34:22] yourself he says it's saying God Alone
[1:34:25] can do it and not what men does oh you
[1:34:28] can be mentally worked up you can be in
[1:34:31] Emotion but I'm not talking about that
[1:34:33] I'm talking about a faith that was once
[1:34:35] delivered to the saints that settled
[1:34:37] something no matter how you felt or what
[1:34:40] sensation you have you have any or have
[1:34:42] none it's settled on God's Eternal Word
[1:34:46] he says that's the faith that was once
[1:34:47] delivered to the Saints now catch this
[1:34:50] he says not that that brother this
[1:34:53] brother prayed for me and this one cast
[1:34:55] The Devil out and this done that and the
[1:34:56] other he says mental emotions can do
[1:34:59] that he says but when the real genuine
[1:35:02] faith that God spoke the truth it's
[1:35:04] settled in the person's heart it's
[1:35:06] Eternal feeling has nothing to do with
[1:35:09] it no more God said so then that faith
[1:35:11] is stabled and no matter what takes
[1:35:14] place how you feel whether you get sick
[1:35:18] or whether you do or not that has
[1:35:20] nothing to do with it he says it's that
[1:35:22] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:35:24] saints that they believe that's what
[1:35:27] we're looking for that's what the
[1:35:28] ministry is looking for is a people that
[1:35:30] will rest on the word of God and the
[1:35:32] word of God Alone Brothers let me talk
[1:35:35] to you we've got to be men of God we've
[1:35:38] got to be led by the spirit first and
[1:35:39] foremost amen here's the here's the
[1:35:41] thing we can't become spiritual when the
[1:35:44] moment
[1:35:45] comes we need a daily experience in the
[1:35:49] presence of God we need to know where
[1:35:51] we're standing remember what brother
[1:35:52] Bram said about David I read the quote a
[1:35:54] couple Services ago he said David was
[1:35:56] prayed up when the situation arose David
[1:35:59] didn't have to go make it right David
[1:36:01] didn't have to check him with God he
[1:36:02] knew his anointing he knew he was called
[1:36:04] and he stepped into the breach and he
[1:36:06] took care of the situation we can't get
[1:36:09] spiritual when sickness hits we need to
[1:36:11] be spiritual before it hits so we know
[1:36:12] what to do with it when the Tormentor
[1:36:14] comes when he starts to try and put his
[1:36:16] claws and his hooks into somebody in our
[1:36:18] family when he's knocking on the door
[1:36:19] we've got to open that door with a heart
[1:36:21] of faith that says you have no right
[1:36:23] here out you go we cannot act spiritual
[1:36:26] we have to be spiritual it has to be a
[1:36:29] day-by-day experience why because we've
[1:36:31] got to be able to say I'm in his will
[1:36:33] and I'm in his presence therefore I know
[1:36:35] he's got my back why because I put him
[1:36:38] in preeminence in my life I put him at
[1:36:40] the Forefront therefore I know he's with
[1:36:43] me David will put this this way
[1:36:46] wherewith all shall a young man cleanse
[1:36:48] his way in other words how can he be
[1:36:50] right with God how can he walk pure
[1:36:51] before God David says by taking heed
[1:36:54] thereto according to Thy Word with my
[1:36:57] whole heart have I sought thee we're
[1:37:01] talking about how do I find the will of
[1:37:02] God in my life how do I know I'm in the
[1:37:04] will of God he says with my whole heart
[1:37:06] have I sought thee oh let me not Wander
[1:37:08] from thy Commandments Thy word have I
[1:37:11] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[1:37:13] against
[1:37:14] thee Samson such a a sad character and
[1:37:18] I've just been reading in judges and I
[1:37:20] just finished up with Samson and Samson
[1:37:23] had that
[1:37:24] moral failure of being caught up in
[1:37:26] women but what a man he was what a man
[1:37:30] he was what a judge he was and for 20
[1:37:32] years he judged Israel Faithfully he got
[1:37:34] caught up in these little things and
[1:37:36] it's because he didn't have a whole
[1:37:37] heart of seeking God he let himself get
[1:37:40] LED
[1:37:41] away brother Braham says Samson had
[1:37:43] stood in that place one time himself and
[1:37:46] he knew the power of God but now he had
[1:37:48] been shaven of those privileges he was
[1:37:51] just as big as he ever was but God
[1:37:53] wasn't there he says we've got a lot of
[1:37:55] that today it's too bad we have it but
[1:37:57] we have it but it doesn't bring back the
[1:38:00] spirit of God he says now the thing of
[1:38:02] it is the people are not willing to pay
[1:38:04] the price to get back to
[1:38:07] that
[1:38:08] am You' got to have it to know you've
[1:38:11] never that you've lost it sometimes
[1:38:13] we've lost it and we aren't willing to
[1:38:15] pay the price to get back to where we
[1:38:16] stood before and continue on with God he
[1:38:19] says I believe that God just Remains the
[1:38:21] Same as he ever was but the thing of it
[1:38:23] is the people have got so wound up into
[1:38:25] the world and the world and them till
[1:38:28] they got just God enough just religion
[1:38:30] to make them miserable he says not
[1:38:33] enough to really turn loose to God and
[1:38:36] give your whole heart unto him he says
[1:38:40] but enough yeah I go to church certainly
[1:38:42] I enjoy good singing and clapping hands
[1:38:45] yeah I love that see what a church
[1:38:47] experience but not a god
[1:38:51] experience he says they're not willing
[1:38:53] to pay the price and put everything
[1:38:54] they've got into it he says you got to
[1:38:56] stay right with the word and believe it
[1:38:59] not just slip over here this way and
[1:39:01] that way and say I'll Peck and try what
[1:39:03] tentative half in half out not committed
[1:39:07] not
[1:39:08] uncommitted like a buffet I'll take a
[1:39:11] little bit a little but you won't sit
[1:39:12] down and just
[1:39:13] eat I'll try it see if I like it see if
[1:39:16] it works he says you don't do that no no
[1:39:19] you've got to come with a whole heart
[1:39:21] it's your word Lord I believe it he says
[1:39:24] God will make it it'll go to work right
[1:39:28] there we're going to get into this in
[1:39:30] more detail on Sunday Lord willing but
[1:39:32] how do you find God's will for your life
[1:39:34] seek
[1:39:35] it seek it with your whole heart give it
[1:39:39] everything you got amen don't seek to
[1:39:41] confirm
[1:39:42] yourself that's the greatest danger of a
[1:39:46] of a of a Believer is that you're trying
[1:39:48] to
[1:39:49] confirm rather than get his will see we
[1:39:53] we seek permission rather than
[1:39:55] submission that's really what it is
[1:39:57] we're not yielding oursel we're saying
[1:39:59] Lord am I right rather than saying Lord
[1:40:02] what is your will because sometimes we
[1:40:04] haven't even thought of what we need to
[1:40:06] do and we're so busy getting
[1:40:07] confirmation that we can't hear the
[1:40:09] direction that he's looking for amen
[1:40:11] don't seek permission seek submission
[1:40:13] and how do you do that read your Bible
[1:40:15] every day pray every day stay in his
[1:40:19] presence stay in his word and Things
[1:40:22] become strangely clear clear when you
[1:40:24] start reading your Bible and the more
[1:40:26] you read the more you
[1:40:28] understand and if you can take the word
[1:40:30] and you can place it clearly into your
[1:40:33] situation then you don't have to wait
[1:40:35] around that's the joy of having an
[1:40:39] absolute is that you can place it if you
[1:40:41] can place your situation perfectly into
[1:40:43] it then you don't have to wait around
[1:40:45] you can say thus sayeth the Lord because
[1:40:46] thus sayeth the Lord you've got it right
[1:40:49] there you know it's so easy to just say
[1:40:51] well I had my devotions and I prayed
[1:40:52] today and that's it no we've got to take
[1:40:55] it we've got to take what we've read
[1:40:58] we've got to take what we've heard we've
[1:40:59] got to stay in a place of prayer until
[1:41:01] he comes and he meets us and that takes
[1:41:04] time and what is the last thing that we
[1:41:05] have these days time quiet time it is so
[1:41:11] hard it is so hard to get that quiet
[1:41:13] time I force myself to get it in the
[1:41:16] mornings meaning I force people to stay
[1:41:18] away I go down in the mornings I've got
[1:41:19] my earplugs to put in that do almost
[1:41:21] nothing to keep the sound of the boys
[1:41:23] fighting above my head regularly but I
[1:41:25] do everything I can to get that quiet
[1:41:27] time but sometimes it means we may need
[1:41:28] to just walk off somewhere and just
[1:41:30] spend some time with God turn the music
[1:41:32] off in the car spend some time with
[1:41:36] God Amen not just a token prayer so we
[1:41:40] can say I prayed about
[1:41:43] it not just a token yeah yeah I asked
[1:41:46] the Lord about it and I feel this is his
[1:41:47] will no seek Him truly seek him and say
[1:41:51] Lord I want your will I want your way
[1:41:54] and not let go until we get it
[1:41:58] amen as we close brother says you want
[1:42:01] to belong to heaven in heaven he says
[1:42:04] that's where your affections ought to be
[1:42:06] on things above Jesus said set your
[1:42:09] affections on things above not on the
[1:42:10] things of the earth they're going to
[1:42:12] fail stay with God stay with realities
[1:42:16] God is a god of reality he has always
[1:42:20] been in all ages and any time that man
[1:42:23] ever walked with God God became a
[1:42:25] reality that performed signs and wonders
[1:42:28] and miracles with his people he says
[1:42:30] it's God's purpose to do so surrender
[1:42:34] all amen God bless you let's Stand
[1:42:39] Together am man the nice thing about
[1:42:40] having lots of notes is you can break it
[1:42:42] up so as not to tire out the
[1:42:47] people this is the way the Lord's
[1:42:49] leading me on some of these things and I
[1:42:51] was telling someone before service we're
[1:42:53] going to do some more services like this
[1:42:54] on how do I this and how do I that and
[1:42:57] and and some of the rubber meets the
[1:42:58] road and Lord willing on Sunday we'll
[1:43:00] get into this about okay brother John
[1:43:02] you told us he wants to bring us to a
[1:43:04] place of spiritual maturity he wants to
[1:43:05] bring us to a place of adoption but how
[1:43:08] do I actually do it and then how do I
[1:43:11] know when I found it and that's a that's
[1:43:14] a challenge I know for I think it's a
[1:43:15] challenge for all of us but especially
[1:43:17] for our young people is how do I know
[1:43:19] what God's will is for my
[1:43:21] life because we got all sorts of
[1:43:23] different personalities we've got boys
[1:43:24] we've got girls we've got all sorts of
[1:43:26] families and and different things and
[1:43:29] histories and how do I know what's God's
[1:43:31] will for my life do I follow in Mom's
[1:43:33] footsteps do I follow in Dad's footsteps
[1:43:34] do I follow in this one or that one Lord
[1:43:36] what is your will for my life and to be
[1:43:39] able to go to him and find confidence in
[1:43:41] the answer that he gives one to get an
[1:43:43] answer and then two to have confidence
[1:43:45] in it because if we lack confidence then
[1:43:47] Satan's got a he's got access to us
[1:43:49] that's the in the armor that's the
[1:43:50] the thing that puts a hole and and
[1:43:52] allows him to get through amen so I want
[1:43:54] to do this with the church over the next
[1:43:56] couple services and certainly over the
[1:43:57] next couple of months as we start to
[1:43:59] wrap up this adoption Series so maybe in
[1:44:01] in in July or August we'll start to do
[1:44:03] this but to to come to a place where we
[1:44:05] we say how do I do this what does this
[1:44:07] walk look
[1:44:09] like what does it look like day by day
[1:44:11] and and what do I do and how do I feed
[1:44:13] my relationship with God and how do I
[1:44:15] know I've got the Holy Ghost how do I
[1:44:16] get the Holy Ghost how do I know what
[1:44:18] it's going to do in my
[1:44:19] life all these sorts of things so I ask
[1:44:22] you to keep in prayer as we go into some
[1:44:24] of these things and yes we'll do some
[1:44:25] doctrinal teaching and these things but
[1:44:28] I really want to get down to where we
[1:44:30] live because what good is a God that
[1:44:32] isn't in our day-to-day lives anden he
[1:44:34] wants to be he's seeking to be in our
[1:44:37] day-to-day lives the greatest thing that
[1:44:39] God could do is come down into our life
[1:44:41] on a daily basis to know that he's with
[1:44:43] us to know that he's leading us to know
[1:44:45] that he's guiding us to know you've been
[1:44:47] sealed to know that you're full of the
[1:44:49] Holy Ghost and you're you're settled and
[1:44:51] you're sealed to your Eternal Destin
[1:44:53] ination with him what a wonderful place
[1:44:55] to walk in confidence every single day
[1:44:57] to know that he hears your prayer and
[1:44:59] that you're walking in his will day by
[1:45:01] day amen so you keep that in prayer and
[1:45:03] if you've got questions by all means
[1:45:05] send it out send me an email or
[1:45:07] something and say brother John I've
[1:45:08] always wondered about this and could you
[1:45:10] do that and maybe it's something quick
[1:45:11] and easy I can just send you an answer
[1:45:13] but if it's a bigger one then I'm more
[1:45:14] than willing to take a service and do
[1:45:16] that because I know it would benefit you
[1:45:18] know brother Mark did a lot of teaching
[1:45:19] in Sunday school and he covered a lot of
[1:45:21] things and brother Gerald was quite a
[1:45:22] teacher in his early days as as well and
[1:45:24] so I know the benefit of of a solid
[1:45:27] bible-based teaching where you can go to
[1:45:29] your your Bible and you can say I know
[1:45:31] what I believe and I know why I believe
[1:45:33] it amen so let's keep that in prayer
[1:45:35] over the coming weeks and months
[1:45:36] certainly that the Lord would lead me
[1:45:38] and guide me in those things but you
[1:45:40] take your need you take your need and
[1:45:42] say God would you just answer it show me
[1:45:45] as I'm reading the Bible it doesn't have
[1:45:47] to come from this Pulpit amen God wants
[1:45:49] a personal relationship with each and
[1:45:51] every person in this church and that
[1:45:53] comes by reading his word because he
[1:45:56] identifies himself in and through his
[1:45:58] word amen and when you start to lay hold
[1:46:00] of that you'll start to find that other
[1:46:01] things come into place as well amen
[1:46:04] let's just bow our heads Heavenly
[1:46:07] Father Lord we're hungry people Lord
[1:46:10] we're hungry for your presence Lord
[1:46:13] we're hungry for your touch Lord we're
[1:46:15] hungry for your promises each one and so
[1:46:18] Lord I'm asking Lord as we preach on
[1:46:20] this Lord not just today Lord but as we
[1:46:22] preached it Lord but on Sunday and as we
[1:46:24] move forward Lord that you would just
[1:46:26] move in your people's midst Lord you see
[1:46:29] the needs you see the hearts Lord you
[1:46:30] see the lives you see the questions Lord
[1:46:33] and I pray that your spirit would just
[1:46:34] move to discern these things Lord it
[1:46:37] would answer questions that it would
[1:46:38] settle doubts Lord that it would cast
[1:46:40] out fears Lord that your love would fill
[1:46:42] every Poe and every Lord portion of our
[1:46:45] being each one Heavenly Father Lord I
[1:46:47] pray that we'd be of people that seeks
[1:46:49] your will Lord and in our seeking Lord
[1:46:51] we'd have the promise that we would find
[1:46:53] it Lord that if we call on your name
[1:46:55] that you'd answer Lord and if we knock
[1:46:57] that you'd open the windows of heaven
[1:46:59] and pour out a blessing Lord that we
[1:47:00] can't contain Lord I pray you bless your
[1:47:03] people this night Lord be with us
[1:47:04] throughout the rest of the week Lord I
[1:47:06] pray your ministering Grace to each
[1:47:08] heart and soul that's here in Jesus
[1:47:10] Christ's name we ask it
[1:47:15] amen show me your way 11:57
