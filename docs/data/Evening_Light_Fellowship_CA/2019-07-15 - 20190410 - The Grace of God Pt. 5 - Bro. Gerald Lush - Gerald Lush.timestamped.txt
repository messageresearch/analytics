[43:15] a man praise the Lord trust you feel
[43:19] that way a man by the grace of God and
[43:23] it is Grace
[43:25] everything is Grace a man from the blade
[43:29] a were born to the day we go it is Grace
[43:32] they met we're depending on the grace of
[43:35] God and tonight the Lord will you want
[43:37] to bring those are the thoughts to a
[43:39] conclusion regarding grace you can never
[43:41] you can never never really finish it
[43:43] amen because it's all grace amen
[43:46] every every second of the day that we
[43:49] are here it is the grace of God amen so
[43:52] pray the grace of God to continue with
[43:55] the saints of their need and the prayer
[43:57] requests that went over the pulpit today
[43:58] or whatever's on your heart and also I
[44:02] don't know if it was mentioned or not
[44:04] but I assume that brother Bob got it was
[44:11] a prayer request from India and it was
[44:13] from a to me it's a brother Samuel and I
[44:18] would not be able to say brother vice
[44:21] world would but I would not be able to
[44:23] say is is his actual name that comes
[44:28] upon the email but he always signs it
[44:31] with brother Samuel a man but he s sent
[44:35] a quite a number of email to me and it's
[44:39] and it's usually contains scriptures and
[44:43] quotes for the Prophet and and I've got
[44:46] to say it's good a man he God has
[44:48] blessed that brother with a revelation
[44:50] of the message now where he is in India
[44:54] I do not know hey maybe brother Basha
[44:57] would know once he saw the name but he
[45:01] did send an email he was today or
[45:04] yesterday concerning a prayer request
[45:07] also like brother Leo it was for his
[45:10] mother a man and she also is an elderly
[45:13] woman but he sprained the grace of God
[45:15] to his mother so he asked us to remember
[45:18] her in prayer
[45:19] so tonight not only while you're sitting
[45:23] in the in the pews here but when you go
[45:25] home to remember brother Lee
[45:27] and his need but also to remember this
[45:30] brother Samuel in India and and he's
[45:33] made also for his mother and their
[45:36] mothers of course our elderly and our
[45:39] brother Leo said his mother's in her 90s
[45:41] and for sister Dunford that with sister
[45:46] Betty's mother and she was 95 almost 96
[45:50] when the Lord called her home but she
[45:52] was compared to compared to others in in
[45:56] their 40s or 50s she was young that is
[45:59] that's the truth that's the absolute
[46:01] truth she was she she did not manifest
[46:05] old age I don't think she believed in it
[46:10] her faith her faith was youth a man she
[46:15] had the faith of a young person that's
[46:16] the truth she said she was oh she lost
[46:19] she loved just to just to get him to the
[46:22] service get into the church and the sing
[46:24] in the praise the Lord Amen that was
[46:27] sister Dunford a man and so I trust that
[46:31] we maintain that that youthfulness if
[46:34] the Lord tarries and if he doesn't try
[46:36] we're gonna get it just think sister
[46:39] daughter went went from here to there
[46:41] you where she went she's a young woman a
[46:44] man but she's used to that the Lord was
[46:50] making our use of that ear there's not
[46:51] many like that all the time but but
[46:54] there are a few ear and there who wage
[46:56] and are very very young a man in what
[47:00] they do and how they do it as I said she
[47:02] would have been 96 just shortly before
[47:05] the Lord called her all a man and as I
[47:08] said she never complained and we knew
[47:12] there was something wrong but she would
[47:13] never admit it and you know of course
[47:16] when we praise the Lord God give us
[47:20] faith a man brother
[47:22] faith but season to get faith you got to
[47:25] recognize grace a man and it's like I
[47:29] said and most everyone would and in fact
[47:31] they did laugh at her in the hospital
[47:33] when they asked her why she why she came
[47:36] to the hospital we took her to the
[47:38] emergency and they said why are you here
[47:41] and she wouldn't even tell them she said
[47:44] because they brought me a man so it's so
[47:48] oh so the nurse the nurse laughed at her
[47:51] oh she said that's why you're here yes
[47:53] she said and so they sent her home again
[47:57] and that would that was out of Saturday
[47:59] on a Tuesday
[48:00] she went into a stroke they mad but you
[48:03] know what no not a Saturday he was done
[48:05] a another day Monday yeah on Tuesdays
[48:09] one's a stroke but was on the Saturday
[48:12] before that Monday she she was she was
[48:18] conscious of eternity she was conscious
[48:20] that she was going somewhere because
[48:23] it's on a Saturday she called us into
[48:25] the into the room the living room and
[48:29] she asked forgiveness for have any where
[48:33] she said I have offended jizz anywhere
[48:35] I've been a problem to you she said I
[48:39] want you to forgive me
[48:40] she says and she wanted to settle all
[48:43] that all those issues because she lived
[48:45] with us for 28 years and we of course
[48:48] were were helped to them even to mr.
[48:52] Dunford a man so she did that she was
[48:56] getting right with God a man on a
[48:58] Saturday she cleared everything out and
[49:01] then on Tuesday shared the stroke and
[49:03] ten days later she the Lord took her
[49:06] home but she was ready to go she greeted
[49:09] and him it anybody that came into the
[49:11] hospital of course she she she she could
[49:15] wave one hand the other one was
[49:17] paralyzed but the other one she she
[49:20] would smile and she's take your hand she
[49:22] squeezed your hand and another time I
[49:25] went in with a tape and I let her hear
[49:28] the tape of old the old compassion
[49:30] gospel hymns and she loved it oh you

[49:34] countenance changed when I when I put
[49:37] the earphones in her ear and played the
[49:40] these these hymns oh she loved it a man
[49:43] all time with the peace of God I knew
[49:46] she wasn't afraid no she was ready you

[1:03:59] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:04:05] which are in Christ Jesus
[1:04:08] amazing absolutely amazing to them that
[1:04:12] are in Christ Jesus not with him but in
[1:04:15] him and it says who walk not after the
[1:04:19] flesh to many believers are walking
[1:04:22] after the flesh amen
[1:04:24] they're living after the flesh amen
[1:04:27] they're controlled by the flesh but the
[1:04:30] sons of God the daughters of God they
[1:04:33] walk after the spirit and it says who
[1:04:36] walk not after the flesh you can't be in
[1:04:38] Christ and walk after the flesh amen it
[1:04:42] says but after the spirit for the law of
[1:04:46] the spirit of life in Christ Jesus and
[1:04:49] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:04:54] death amen
[1:04:56] they can condemn us organs
[1:04:59] it's the Holy Ghost in control for what
[1:05:04] the law could not do in that it was weak
[1:05:06] through the flesh Amen God sending his
[1:05:11] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:05:14] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[1:05:19] the grace of God that the righteousness
[1:05:23] of the law amen the righteousness of the
[1:05:28] law may be fulfilled in us who walk not
[1:05:31] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:05:35] verse 14 for as many as are led by the
[1:05:40] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:47] God's gracious those that are led by the
[1:05:50] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:05:53] not by the Spirit of the devil they are
[1:05:58] the sons of God led by the Spirit of God
[1:06:00] and a person can be led by the Spirit of
[1:06:03] the devil and think that he's led by the
[1:06:06] Spirit of God because it is so closer we
[1:06:09] deceive the very elect if possible for
[1:06:14] ye have not received the spirit of
[1:06:16] bondage again to fear thank God for that
[1:06:20] grace but he have received the spirit of
[1:06:24] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen
[1:06:32] the spirit and that's the life of the
[1:06:36] blood the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:06:40] with our spirit then we are the children
[1:06:46] of God amen
[1:06:49] trust you have that confirmation in your
[1:06:51] experience in your life the Holy Ghost
[1:06:55] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[1:06:57] than we are the children of God a man
[1:07:02] having the nature of God and if children
[1:07:06] then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs
[1:07:12] with
[1:07:12] I told Lorie if she'll be that we suffer
[1:07:18] with him if so be that we suffer with
[1:07:23] him god help us we think that
[1:07:28] Christianity Oh everything is going to
[1:07:29] be good
[1:07:30] God is going to make it all easy for me
[1:07:32] I'm gonna have no worries none of
[1:07:33] there's none of that no suffering it's
[1:07:36] the beginning a man because we come into
[1:07:40] the trial of our faith better and the
[1:07:44] trial of our confession and if children
[1:07:47] then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with
[1:07:49] Christ and if so be that we suffer with
[1:07:53] him that we may be also glorified
[1:07:57] together a million this is the grace of
[1:08:02] God amen for I reckon that the
[1:08:06] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:08:08] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:08:12] which shall be revealed in us by the
[1:08:15] images on the glory the revelation of
[1:08:18] eternity and eternal life not on the
[1:08:21] suffering a man for the earnest
[1:08:24] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:08:27] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:08:30] amen for the creature was made subject
[1:08:34] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:08:38] him who has subjected the same in hope
[1:08:41] and that's the hope with expectation of
[1:08:45] fulfillment because the creature itself
[1:08:48] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:08:51] of corruption hallelujah hallelujah into
[1:08:56] the glorious liberty of the children of
[1:08:58] God for we know that the whole creation
[1:09:02] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[1:09:06] until now and not only they but

[1:14:48] ministry that he had a merit show this
[1:14:51] way and he went to his disciples and

[1:18:33] turn with me to Philippians chapter 3 in
[1:18:46] the in the Christian walk there's no no
[1:18:51] way no time with that without suffering
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:57] if you're going to really take your
[1:18:58] stand as a Christian for the Gospels
[1:19:01] sake and for Jesus sake amen there's
[1:19:03] something you got to endure a man
[1:19:05] because not the whole world is not is
[1:19:08] not going to believe not going to accept
[1:19:10] your testimony they're going to consider
[1:19:12] you to be a fanatic and brother Brent
[1:19:15] has challenged us for being a fanatic
[1:19:16] for Jesus and a fanatic for the gospel
[1:19:19] of fanatic for the revelation of the
[1:19:22] word in this our brother all down
[1:19:23] through the ages those that stood for
[1:19:25] guard will consider fanatics amen summer
[1:19:28] consider fanatics bye-bye believers
[1:19:31] summer consider fanatics by other
[1:19:33] Christians a million but they didn't
[1:19:35] care they took their stand for the
[1:19:36] gospel that they're staying for the
[1:19:38] revelation of the word amen
[1:19:41] for what God was doing in their day and
[1:19:43] in their hour and brother that was the
[1:19:45] grace of God in their lives
[1:19:47] brother there's there's there's some
[1:19:50] sauce right here that I that I had in a
[1:19:52] message the night that I went through
[1:19:53] some years ago and I believe that when I
[1:19:56] finished this message I asked these
[1:19:58] questions and just let me go and run run
[1:20:01] through it and I said who are you
[1:20:03] a man who are you why are you under the
[1:20:08] grace of God or under the under the
[1:20:11] judgment of God and I said who are you
[1:20:13] are you Adam or are you Eid
[1:20:16] a man are you able or you came a man
[1:20:24] remember there although that are
[1:20:26] concerning these right here that they're
[1:20:28] all religious they all had the
[1:20:31] revelation of God they all knew then
[1:20:34] there was a car they all knew that God
[1:20:36] was God and there was one gone
[1:20:38] a man it is not like this world believes
[1:20:42] in three gods when it comes to a Trinity
[1:20:44] but that's alright if it was back some
[1:20:47] years ago but not in this day and in
[1:20:49] this hour because God has revealed
[1:20:51] himself as as the one true Living God by
[1:20:54] brothers sister back here through the
[1:20:57] scriptures this one believed God that
[1:20:59] wouldn't believe God but but again the
[1:21:01] only this one had the grace of God and
[1:21:04] the other one didn't one came under the
[1:21:07] grace of God and received the grace of
[1:21:09] God and the mercy of God whereas the
[1:21:11] other one experienced the gentleman of
[1:21:13] God a man sir are we Adam or are we Eve
[1:21:16] are we able or where we came a man
[1:21:22] remember again over I'm not saying that
[1:21:24] I go to church I thought I came because
[1:21:27] I'm religious was so Biscayne came when
[1:21:30] the church came was religious a man and
[1:21:34] so are we able or are we came oh but I
[1:21:38] prefer I prefer as I preached the gate a
[1:21:40] and by our having you some years ago
[1:21:43] what church would you go to would you go
[1:21:45] to a way to go to able church or change
[1:21:47] search now remember they had a church
[1:21:52] and most would go to go to Cannes Church
[1:21:56] because Cain church wasn't it was nice
[1:21:58] and brother if you want to see Cain
[1:22:01] church you wait for Thanksgiving Day a
[1:22:04] man right and you wait for the
[1:22:07] Thanksgiving Day and you go to this
[1:22:08] church and that person this church with
[1:22:10] that church oh my and the altars are
[1:22:12] filled with with with fruits and
[1:22:15] vegetables and I get some flowers as
[1:22:17] well and brother that was exactly what
[1:22:20] Cain was offering on his altar to the
[1:22:22] Lord it was what he had grown over there
[1:22:25] what he had done are there but Abel
[1:22:28] never offered that hey will never win
[1:22:30] Cadence's cane would you will you give
[1:22:32] me alternative what cane I'll give you
[1:22:34] some sheep or some lambs and you give me
[1:22:36] some of the vegetables are grown for me
[1:22:39] to put on the altar to God no he didn't
[1:22:41] do that but rather he went out by faith
[1:22:43] and he had the more excellent paint now
[1:22:47] again it's understand that there there
[1:22:49] is excellent faith and there is more
[1:22:51] excellent faith a man by the Bible says
[1:22:56] he had a more excellent faith well if he
[1:22:59] had more excellent Cana excellent amen
[1:23:02] oh that was good King you and I don't
[1:23:04] you sacrifice all of this to give to the
[1:23:07] Lord but God refused it a man by the air
[1:23:11] but ere is Cain are able rather and
[1:23:13] eagle's head he takes a lamb and he
[1:23:15] kills it
[1:23:16] amen and maybe slicing the lad the Lambs
[1:23:19] throat and they let all the blood come
[1:23:21] out on the altar and no doubt he led the
[1:23:23] blood come out upon him because he knew
[1:23:26] that this was where this was redemption
[1:23:28] was would would be in the blood but that
[1:23:31] blood only covered his sin he never took
[1:23:33] away you seen a man because the life of
[1:23:37] the land could not come into him he was
[1:23:40] a human being and the lamb was an animal
[1:23:42] a Maya and that was one long effort here
[1:23:45] every had another life so that's why
[1:23:48] they were waiting on the promise of God
[1:23:50] to come and said that perfect sinless
[1:23:53] blood that He shed in Jesus Christ so
[1:23:56] the life of that individual Jesus could
[1:23:59] come back on you and me and not only
[1:24:01] come back on us but to come back in us
[1:24:03] hey man praise the Lord
[1:24:05] so that he would put his life in honest
[1:24:07] I'll be with you even in you he said
[1:24:10] till the end of the age praise the name
[1:24:12] of the Lord hallelujah so again as I say
[1:24:15] where which church with would they go to
[1:24:17] most are going to cane Church but there
[1:24:20] are very few that are going to able
[1:24:22] search there are very few that are
[1:24:24] identifying a man with the blood of the
[1:24:27] Lord Jesus Christ and how to identify
[1:24:29] with the blood of Christ not just to say
[1:24:31] I believe that he said is about 2000
[1:24:34] years ago no you got the evidence you
[1:24:36] got the Holy Ghost you got the life of
[1:24:39] the bloody you a man this is the
[1:24:41] evidence
[1:24:42] that blood was shed for you because the
[1:24:45] life of that leg comes back to the true
[1:24:47] believer the life of that blood blood
[1:24:49] comes back to the seat of God a babe oh
[1:24:52] I pray God tonight that that era this
[1:24:55] assembly and those representing this
[1:24:57] assembly that they have the life of the
[1:25:00] blood in their a man brothers not just
[1:25:03] the revelation of the intellectual
[1:25:04] message in your head it's the life of
[1:25:07] the blood in your heart a man is God
[1:25:10] living out the message is God living of
[1:25:13] the word it's God by grace in you

[1:25:30] the third pole and in the OB of the word
[1:25:33] it was to bring us to perfect faith he
[1:25:35] said for the rapture and he said we had
[1:25:38] to come to this for the rapture amen by
[1:25:41] the grace of Almighty God hallelujah
[1:25:43] brother and we were going to turn
[1:25:46] ourselves over we want to we want to be

[1:28:08] Judas that tried to control the word oh
[1:28:10] yeah and he because why as I mentioned I
[1:28:15] have to wonder brethren that because
[1:28:17] Judas won't what a a wonder force Jesus
[1:28:20] you know to deliver the Jewish wrong the
[1:28:23] ruling of their of the Romans nation and
[1:28:27] so on brother as it was back then
[1:28:29] they're going to come under the same the
[1:28:32] same control even in this hour it was a
[1:28:35] political Roman back then and in this
[1:28:37] hour is going to be political and
[1:28:39] religious amen movement powers that will
[1:28:44] control the world Jesus came there to
[1:28:46] deliver them from their sheds amen and
[1:28:49] Jesus came to deliver us on our sins and
[1:28:52] get us back to eternity that's whether
[1:28:54] just what the Jews needed that's what
[1:28:56] you and and but Jesus came to the
[1:28:58] Gentiles to provoke Israel to jealousy
[1:29:00] brother our children is just tremendous
[1:29:02] things going on in Israel all brother is
[1:29:06] more going on in Israel
[1:29:08] we really realize hey man you can see a
[1:29:11] lot when it comes to the internet and
[1:29:13] what's going on in Israel even and I
[1:29:16] understand that then maybe that
[1:29:18] Netanyahu who has been a was the the
[1:29:22] leader of Israel for ten years that
[1:29:24] apparently he's been voted in for
[1:29:26] another five years a man but in this in
[1:29:30] this part of his reign in Israel there
[1:29:33] there apparently there there's what's
[1:29:35] going to take control or what's going to
[1:29:37] partly influenced what he does and
[1:29:39] doesn't do he spirit something spiritual
[1:29:41] and again I saw that somewhere on you
[1:29:44] know in an email that I received amen
[1:29:47] but this brother because why because
[1:29:50] Israel and more and more they're
[1:29:52] beginning to want to focus on Messiah

[1:34:25] than that
[1:34:26] hey man it goes deeper than that and we
[1:34:29] think grace began in Genesis after the
[1:34:33] fall of Adam and Eve grace goes back
[1:34:35] before Genesis amen
[1:34:37] as I explained that a grace was there
[1:34:40] when Noah found grace in the eyes of the
[1:34:42] Lord in Revelation there the light the
[1:34:44] last verse grace amen brother
[1:34:48] His grace comes in grace takes us out
[1:34:51] and we go in amen
[1:34:54] there was a prayer of God's character
[1:34:56] spread of ours a man praised the name of
[1:34:59] the Lord but it's eternal it's eternal
[1:35:02] brother brother sister so what church
[1:35:05] play as I said would you prefer to go
[1:35:07] cane or evil most are in Cain's church
[1:35:10] they don't realize it but during Cain's
[1:35:12] search that's the truth they're offering
[1:35:16] their sovereign that but I'm reoffer in
[1:35:18] their lives
[1:35:19] I don't they don't lay their lives down
[1:35:20] as Jesus ladies down however many are
[1:35:23] suffering brother Gospels sake as Jesus
[1:35:25] suffered and the slower in the last days
[1:35:29] because the prophet of God brother he
[1:35:32] considered the last days you know what
[1:35:34] he thought he thought he was losing his
[1:35:36] mind that's right and he also thought he
[1:35:40] said I thought there I felt like I'll
[1:35:42] have to go to a doctor and get some anti
[1:35:44] dip
[1:35:45] oh yeah he felt that way yeah he went to
[1:35:49] brother Jack more each time I losing my
[1:35:51] mind
[1:35:52] he went doing winter sister Branham and
[1:35:54] and if anybody would it would help
[1:35:56] helping donors Devon will be his wife
[1:35:58] and he said am I losing my mind because
[1:36:03] he was so caught up with the word any
[1:36:05] man the word of God and he saw so much
[1:36:08] when it comes to the negative things
[1:36:09] that was contrary to the word and was
[1:36:11] getting worse and worse and worse a
[1:36:13] night not just that into the world but
[1:36:16] even in his own church because as I say
[1:36:19] in that message how can I overcome and
[1:36:21] he preached embrace the bridge and I
[1:36:23] quoted where he said they said where
[1:36:25] brother BAM I'm nights more you're gonna
[1:36:26] preach this he thought he preached it
[1:36:28] until you stop doing it and that was his
[1:36:31] own church what we as I said and let me
[1:36:35] say the game anyway by the grace of God
[1:36:39] to say this they put us on our guard
[1:36:41] brothers are profitable to come back he
[1:36:43] wouldn't he wouldn't be he wouldn't be
[1:36:45] focusing on that O'Dare religion he be
[1:36:47] focusing on the message that's right
[1:36:51] repaired repaired repaired because every
[1:36:54] time God sent the Prophet he sent him
[1:36:56] with a message of repentance he made
[1:36:59] every time they came to Israel brickhead
[1:37:01] and that's what Ava was doing repenting
[1:37:04] but King wouldn't do it
[1:37:07] Cain was gonna blame God everybody and
[1:37:12] brother that's what the devil was trying
[1:37:13] to go to do with Adam and Eve had to do
[1:37:15] this and do this now oh he was saying he
[1:37:18] was he was accusing God of lying and B
[1:37:22] not being honest with that of a need
[1:37:24] that's the truth and that the old
[1:37:27] brother sisters don't listen to the
[1:37:28] devil listen to God every man you try to
[1:37:32] get P even believers today the thing
[1:37:35] that God has being dishonest God has not
[1:37:37] been honest God's not being right with
[1:37:38] me and so on he won't tell me this won't
[1:37:40] tell me that amen brother sister that's
[1:37:43] where they he said all he said to eat
[1:37:46] always the yes God saying but what abuts
[1:37:53] belong to
[1:37:54] goats they but the sheep don't but they
[1:38:01] man brothers sister he but but he said I
[1:38:05] say unto you he didn't say they wouldn't
[1:38:08] die he said thou shall not surely die
[1:38:12] but he said you shall be as God's
[1:38:15] knowing good and evil
[1:38:19] that they didn't need to know because
[1:38:23] the grace of God is gonna take us back
[1:38:24] to where we don't we only know good amen
[1:38:28] there will be no knowledge of sin amen
[1:38:31] because the atmosphere is gonna be
[1:38:33] totally righteous this is grace brother
[1:38:35] all brothers sister God Elvis I realize
[1:38:38] that is not just grace
[1:38:40] two thousand years ago when Jesus died
[1:38:42] and now we're preaching the were saved
[1:38:44] by grace now you got a I am oh yes
[1:38:47] you're saved by grace amen it's the
[1:38:50] grace of God because Jesus did this and
[1:38:52] Jesus did that yeah but what about how
[1:38:54] do i how do I get what Jesus did I know
[1:38:58] I become a part of what Jesus did well
[1:39:00] by the grace of God you repent
[1:39:03] yeah well that right what do you mean
[1:39:07] not many repenting today
[1:39:11] that's right brother sister many are
[1:39:14] repenting of their repentance sorry I
[1:39:19] didn't have to do that all I do is say I
[1:39:22] believe I believe that that's it that's
[1:39:26] right David Lee oh I believe God I
[1:39:29] believe what Jesus did and thank you
[1:39:30] Lord and then go on and do us right in
[1:39:32] their own eyes amen that's what is for
[1:39:36] day that it was right in their own eyes
[1:39:38] in the wilderness but how many was was I

[1:39:50] but again listen oh my god allow allowed
[1:39:53] that in what they saw in the land God
[1:39:56] allowed it amen
[1:39:58] though when it comes to the the Giants
[1:40:01] and the big cities and in the walled
[1:40:03] cities and everything else brother a guy
[1:40:06] got it out

[1:40:32] and they come out said no we can't go in
[1:40:34] because of this Joshua and Caleb said oh
[1:40:36] yes we can go in and God be for us who

[1:40:58] believed god this is it is by grace
[1:41:01] through faith that they went in possess
[1:41:04] the land but the others rejected that
[1:41:09] grace they never a acknowledge that
[1:41:11] grace and to receive the faith that that
[1:41:13] grace would give them not realizing I
[1:41:16] think they ain't not thinking that I

[1:41:21] I'm going to just trust the Lord and I'm
[1:41:23] gonna depend on God amen oh they didn't

[1:42:30] work in our souls
[1:42:31] maybe we repent and we're baptized and
[1:42:33] God receives our faith and gives us the
[1:42:35] Holy Ghost brothers now on us is heinous
[1:42:38] amen brother but the devil is there and
[1:42:41] he's going to each going to work on us

[1:43:41] hallelujah
[1:43:42] it is the grace of God in you it is the
[1:43:45] grace of God within his word it is the
[1:43:47] grace of God revealing his will and
[1:43:50] brother sister let's understand this
[1:43:52] that when it comes to God Rivini ins
[1:43:54] will by grace revealed as well it's not
[1:43:57] just spiritual the revelation of the
[1:44:01] will of God in your life is to control
[1:44:03] your life the will of God in your life
[1:44:06] the revelation of it in your soul is to
[1:44:08] give you victory over the devil
[1:44:10] amen you got Satan is going to work on
[1:44:13] your senses and he'll come down through
[1:44:15] your Satan and your senses and your
[1:44:17] flesh and into your human spirit amen
[1:44:19] but then if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:44:21] Satan begins to move with the word and
[1:44:23] he and he'll move from the soul with the
[1:44:26] revelation of the word into your spirit
[1:44:28] and rate and he and he forces the devil
[1:44:32] back into your mind
[1:44:33] a man and to neutralize what the devil
[1:44:35] is trying to get you to believe amen
[1:44:38] that's what the pilot of God said he
[1:44:40] said as if this is the battle we're in a
[1:44:43] war we are in a war and brother it's not
[1:44:46] just a war with what's going on out
[1:44:48] there in the world it's the war what's
[1:44:50] going on right here in this flesh ain't
[1:44:55] meaning there's too many believers
[1:44:57] brother too many things
[1:44:58] oh I'm fighting against that out there I
[1:45:00] got a you know when I go to work I gotta
[1:45:02] fight those spirits and when I go when I
[1:45:03] go out shopping I gotta fight those
[1:45:05] spirits when I eat sometimes even ate
[1:45:07] with family I gotta fight those spirits
[1:45:09] yeah but the greatest battle you got is
[1:45:11] within this flesh within your flesh
[1:45:15] because the enemy is attacking yo
[1:45:17] brother right here with your census oh
[1:45:20] yeah and more and more giving into
[1:45:23] Satan's census oh yeah there and there
[1:45:28] living to please the flesh there living
[1:45:31] to satisfy the flesh but brother I pray
[1:45:33] grace that we're going to have the faith
[1:45:35] that Abel had that by the grace of God
[1:45:38] it brother oh by faith able to dis by
[1:45:40] faith Enoch did this by faith Noah did
[1:45:43] this amen but it's the grace of God hey
[1:45:47] man brother sister again just just just
[1:45:50] to prove it amen
[1:45:55] it says Noah walked with God
[1:45:58] but again Noah found grace in the eyes
[1:46:01] of the Lord brother if Noah found grace
[1:46:04] in the eyes of the Lord walked with God
[1:46:06] he knocked on grace in the eyes of Lord
[1:46:08] and anybody and look at the faith that
[1:46:11] that grace gave him the other faith my
[1:46:16] brother by grace that he had that God
[1:46:18] showed her you know and any what with
[1:46:21] God and walk with God while with God and
[1:46:23] he just lived for garden then for God
[1:46:25] and no doubt no doubt he had a lot of a
[1:46:29] lot of people they're kinda accusing him
[1:46:31] of being a fanatic why because he went
[1:46:34] and did what he had to do for his family
[1:46:35] but then he concentrated on God on God
[1:46:39] on God Oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord and he
[1:46:42] knew what had happened no doubt in the
[1:46:43] Garden of Eden you know and so on and
[1:46:46] and where that it all started with the
[1:46:49] racism of God and the and the love of
[1:46:51] God
[1:46:52] oh praise the name of the Lord he walked
[1:46:55] with God and it says that no matter what
[1:46:57] he did he said God was in control
[1:47:00] amen he didn't go out and do this
[1:47:03] because his mind see in his mind in his
[1:47:05] mind no it was the Spirit of God leading
[1:47:08] him he knew that he want whatever he
[1:47:10] wanted whatever he did he wanted to
[1:47:12] please God
[1:47:13] whatever he did he want to give God the
[1:47:15] preeminence he wanted to give God the
[1:47:17] glory a man do it all for the grant for
[1:47:20] the great glory of God amen
[1:47:22] that was the grace of God in Enochs life
[1:47:25] grace and he walked with God was not
[1:47:28] because God took him a man and Greg and
[1:47:31] Noah and Noah found grace in the eyes of
[1:47:33] the Lord and he walked with God
[1:47:35] hey man and God delivered him and we
[1:47:38] find grace in the eyes of God will walk
[1:47:40] with God but to walk with God you got to
[1:47:43] give God pre evidence and sometimes
[1:47:45] God's gonna do things that that you that
[1:47:48] physically is all that's foolish you
[1:47:51] don't have to do that God don't want you
[1:47:52] to do that oh yes God does this want to
[1:47:55] do that to bring out something else
[1:47:57] amen to test you here to test you there
[1:48:00] tester somewhere else see he got got
[1:48:03] nowhere to do this to bring out what was
[1:48:05] in the rest of the world hey come out
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:10] and he brought it what was in Noah
[1:48:12] brothers sister hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:14] hallelujah amen
[1:48:16] it had never rained on the earth before
[1:48:18] and here he was here is God coming down
[1:48:21] and giving by faith giving no of this
[1:48:24] revelation there was going to it was
[1:48:26] gonna rain and I just rained but it was
[1:48:29] gonna rain so much that God was going to
[1:48:31] flood the earth
[1:48:32] a man named me and the brothers sister
[1:48:35] to the mountains or whatever amen
[1:48:38] everything was gonna be covered right no
[1:48:42] you're crazy yeah he was in the eyes of
[1:48:46] the world oh we don't maybe because why
[1:48:50] it's just they didn't they felt they
[1:48:53] didn't need rain that they'd never had
[1:48:55] rain so brother Noah where'd you get
[1:48:58] that idea to
[1:48:59] i've ever seen a film one time and
[1:49:02] Noah's wife said 200 she said yeah no I
[1:49:08] was just thinking when the flood comes
[1:49:12] what are we gonna do to protect our
[1:49:15] house to keep it from leaking and that
[1:49:22] was just something they put in the film
[1:49:23] it well they got our attention to the
[1:49:26] reality of the flood a man to bring to
[1:49:29] do - to confirm Noah's testimony to
[1:49:33] confirm is faith by the gray suit by the
[1:49:37] grace of God all brother god help us is
[1:49:40] my prayer so are we are we a diverter
[1:49:45] eat are we able Akane
[1:49:48] I'll be Enoch or Noah are we able him or
[1:49:54] a lot are we Isaac or Ishmael are we
[1:50:00] Jacob or Esau that's tremendous because
[1:50:07] in the eyes of the world they would love
[1:50:10] Jacob Esau oh he saw was good he was
[1:50:13] good to his father oh my he went out
[1:50:17] hunting Andrey would bring food back to
[1:50:18] them
[1:50:19] and feed the family but Jacob didn't but
[1:50:25] Jacob had something in his heart all he
[1:50:28] wanted the birthright yes but what was
[1:50:30] in the birthrate it wasn't just
[1:50:34] possessions because in the birthright he
[1:50:39] didn't he wasn't just responsible for
[1:50:41] the land and the houses and and and and
[1:50:44] any if they had any money or whatever
[1:50:46] they oh no no he was to be God's
[1:50:49] representative oh yeah he would answer
[1:50:54] to God he would have to enforce this
[1:50:56] spiritually and so on amen they but but
[1:51:02] he saw he was the spiritual he was
[1:51:06] caught up with the natural things of
[1:51:07] life by God
[1:51:15] it's a generation that's caught up with
[1:51:18] the natural things god help us rather be
[1:51:25] needing a cutout with their spiritual
[1:51:27] then there are such things they're not
[1:51:29] going to rapture us but the spiritual
[1:51:32] will that's why we need to get caught up
[1:51:35] with that and it'll catch us in the
[1:51:38] glory it is by grace through faith my
[1:51:41] God have mercy on us amen
[1:51:45] again as we called in someone has called
[1:51:49] it back to me tender a cottage why
[1:51:50] should I care
[1:51:52] they're building a mansion for me over
[1:51:55] there God have mercy on us brother
[1:51:58] because I'll tell you it's a world that
[1:51:59] it's a world that wants this and wants
[1:52:01] that and wants something else they wants
[1:52:04] the things of the world more than they
[1:52:05] want the things of God god help us
[1:52:12] brothers sister are we Jacob or Esau
[1:52:19] amen
[1:52:21] it was the grace of God in Jacobs life
[1:52:23] brother old grace oh yeah because he
[1:52:27] wrestled with the angel God got oh my
[1:52:32] praise the name of the Lord my lord my
[1:52:34] lord God's ways are not our ways as well
[1:52:37] as well we got to make the sacrifice hey
[1:52:40] man it takes a sacrifice brother because
[1:52:46] god oh the God allowed this to happen
[1:52:48] with Jacob and Esau Garlin honor to
[1:52:51] heaven why because Jacob had to leave
[1:52:56] and Jacob had to go down there and
[1:52:57] that's where his wife force amen and
[1:53:01] through that woman he would have those
[1:53:04] sons Isaac that's doing amen
[1:53:11] by the grace of Almighty God and brother
[1:53:14] then then God would reveal this to him
[1:53:16] and he would on his way back but what
[1:53:19] did he do he met God he and he fought
[1:53:21] with the
[1:53:25] God brings God allows things in your
[1:53:27] life sometimes but then you end up
[1:53:29] fighting fighting the good fight of
[1:53:31] faith
[1:53:34] amen amen
[1:53:36] and joshua fought have fought and fought
[1:53:38] because he was afraid of esau he was
[1:53:42] afraid that he saw was going to attack

[1:58:46] acknowledging the greatness of it
[1:58:48] there's the sincerity of it the
[1:58:49] righteousness of it not exalted not
[1:58:54] acknowledging the royalty of it because
[1:58:57] why it's a part of the character of the
[1:58:59] king of kings and Lord of lords amen
[1:59:03] gracious just not some either oh it came
[1:59:06] when when God when it went at him and he
[1:59:08] sitting in the garden so God grace no
[1:59:13] the grace was there before God came
[1:59:15] Grace was there before rather out of a
[1:59:18] need deep what they did hey man it was
[1:59:23] the grace of God do you know you mean to
[1:59:24] tell me you think that God didn't know
[1:59:26] we're out of it Eve was they met God
[1:59:32] every day and fellowship with him till
[1:59:34] this day they didn't so God began God
[1:59:36] went down to the garden no doubt he was
[1:59:39] ever theophany of Jesus Christ because
[1:59:44] they saw him they saw and it was this
[1:59:49] theophany body that he would later come
[1:59:51] in flesh
[1:59:52] and lay down his life force so they
[1:59:54] softened they said where are you Adam
[1:59:56] any bro but they had wrapped themselves
[2:00:00] into the branches and got into the trees
[2:00:02] and hid themselves brother God knew
[2:00:07] where they were no way of hiding from
[2:00:12] God you were there is your thought your
[2:00:15] words your deeds you can't hide it from
[2:00:17] God God sees your thoughts God's it
[2:00:21] here's your words and God sees your
[2:00:24] deeds God hears and sees what you don't
[2:00:28] hear and see what you think is good God
[2:00:32] thinks is bad amen God's looking for
[2:00:36] grace through faith in the life you live
[2:00:40] grace shall say whether it's in your job
[2:00:43] whether it's in your school no matter
[2:00:44] where it is among your family your
[2:00:46] friends your neighbors you're gonna live
[2:00:49] out the life you are in Jesus no matter
[2:00:51] where he was he stated the word
[2:00:55] sometimes he didn't say much but they
[2:00:58] knew who he was but he wasn't afraid to
[2:01:01] speak the truth
[2:01:02] he was the truth and you are the truth
[2:01:09] you know if there's Christ in you then
[2:01:11] you're the truth as a part of God
[2:01:14] brought out in that message we heard
[2:01:15] that tape he says your gods your gods to
[2:01:20] whom the word of God has come amen the
[2:01:23] Word of God in you and Christ in you
[2:01:25] makes you a son of God daughter of God
[2:01:27] we are the sons and daughters of God by
[2:01:30] the grace of God grace I wanted I'm I'm
[2:01:35] trying to get it across to you to
[2:01:37] understand that grace is not just or
[2:01:39] grace - it just started it and that's it
[2:01:40] that's fine I don't have to worry about
[2:01:42] it no more no no grace is twenty-four
[2:01:44] hours a day
[2:01:46] grace come from eternity brings eternity
[2:01:50] in us takes us back to eternity by the
[2:01:53] grace of God it is great because I feel
[2:01:57] that too often people people that just
[2:02:01] take grace for a moment that's winning
[2:02:03] when they get saved or when they get
[2:02:05] baptized
[2:02:05] and some who believed in the experience
[2:02:08] of the baptism of the holy ghost and so
[2:02:11] on or that's it and I go down and they
[2:02:14] do what's right in their own eyes no no
[2:02:16] now you're gonna live for Jesus live for
[2:02:18] god you're going to you're going to
[2:02:20] endure for the Gospels sake suffering
[2:02:23] well brother I mean he really would want
[2:02:25] to do it not many because they think
[2:02:28] Jesus did it all so I don't have to do
[2:02:30] it that's not according to the word
[2:02:34] that's a lie of the devil how many want
[2:02:40] to suffer for the gospel see I tell you
[2:02:43] brother
[2:02:44] down through the ages when God moved and
[2:02:47] they stayed with God and did what God
[2:02:49] wanted to do where he wanted them to do
[2:02:51] it how he wanted them to do it they
[2:02:53] suffered they endured grace in Ephesians
[2:03:00] chapter 3 sorry oh gosh and in verse 7
[2:03:12] no I'm sorry
[2:03:13] Philippians 3 Philippians chapter 3
[2:03:21] after Ephesians and verse 7 what things
[2:03:25] were gain to me those I counted loss for
[2:03:30] Christ we all got it in our minds must
[2:03:35] gain what we want we want more of this
[2:03:37] more of this more of this more of that
[2:03:38] no no we want the will of God a man and
[2:03:43] what things were gain to me those I
[2:03:45] counted loss for Christ and yeah
[2:03:48] doubtless I count all things but loss
[2:03:51] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[2:03:54] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[2:03:57] suffered the loss of all things
[2:04:01] what have we suffered in taking our
[2:04:05] stand for the truth and he said I do
[2:04:10] count them but dung what Oh should think
[2:04:16] that
[2:04:17] well it is when you consider the light
[2:04:22] of God and hold my the glory of God and
[2:04:25] what's going on in this world
[2:04:27] what's going on this world is dumb he
[2:04:33] said for whom I have suffered the loss
[2:04:35] of all things food he suffered a loss
[2:04:38] for Christ and he said I did camp them
[2:04:42] but down today they don't want to count
[2:04:46] that down oh no no that's too good I
[2:04:48] like that
[2:04:49] I want that well as far as God is
[2:04:54] concerned you can have the dog and I'll
[2:04:57] cast you out with the dome he said that
[2:05:02] I may win Christ amen look II gotta do
[2:05:07] to win Christ look what you got to do oh
[2:05:11] my oh my the disappointments in the
[2:05:14] Judgment surprise who made it surprise I
[2:05:18] didn't make it because why the ones that
[2:05:22] didn't make it wasn't willing to pay the
[2:05:24] price wasn't willing to forsake all
[2:05:26] things for Jesus sake considering what
[2:05:29] he did they weren't willing they weren't
[2:05:33] willing to do what he did they weren't
[2:05:36] willing to sort of match it now he
[2:05:39] wasn't the soft did lay down their lives
[2:05:41] as I said 68 million during the Dark
[2:05:44] Ages lay down their lives but how many
[2:05:46] gonna lay down their lives naturally
[2:05:48] when it comes to the world the things of
[2:05:50] the world because remember again the
[2:05:52] Bible says if you love the world the
[2:05:54] order of the world and the things of the
[2:05:59] world the love of God not in you and it
[2:06:03] comes to loving the world doesn't
[2:06:05] necessarily mean the sinful things of
[2:06:07] the world but the things that is gonna
[2:06:09] distract you from the things of God
[2:06:18] what's more important this life of the
[2:06:20] world who would this world of the world
[2:06:21] at home or eternity most are satisfied
[2:06:29] with living in this world but you got
[2:06:32] the Holy Ghost they knew had the
[2:06:34] attitude Jesus said how long should I be
[2:06:37] in this world why he said no matters to
[2:06:43] send it up but he that came down even
[2:06:44] those on a man who is who is than heaven
[2:06:51] where are you are you there
[2:06:54] well Jesus said he was there he said I
[2:06:58] have no more in the world
[2:06:59] he said I come down and I and he said
[2:07:03] I'm up there and so on well he had Yetta
[2:07:07] Yetta theophany there we got our
[2:07:10] theophany there at the Alvin II body hey
[2:07:14] man I trust you do it we do they may and
[2:07:17] that we're not we're not going like like
[2:07:20] the rich man did he went and he lifted
[2:07:22] up his eyes in hell being in torment but
[2:07:25] at Lazarus lifted up his eyes at the
[2:07:27] bosom of a brain as I said I told that
[2:07:29] to her sister one time but what happens
[2:07:31] after you after you dies physically did
[2:07:34] if she didn't believe that that you you
[2:07:36] were conscious of anything and I said
[2:07:39] well this happened to this one this
[2:07:40] happened to that one day I went into the
[2:07:42] light but let the bosom of Abraham oh
[2:07:44] she said hey bread must have some big
[2:07:46] bosom I said yeah he does I said there's
[2:07:51] room therefore for every seat of God a
[2:07:53] man a man could the bloom of Abram was
[2:07:57] referring to the was what was in his
[2:07:59] heart and his soul in his spirit made
[2:08:02] man not his physical bosom no god help
[2:08:07] us brother it's his faith amen so what
[2:08:11] things were gain to me those I counted a
[2:08:14] loss for Christ did you and do you the
[2:08:19] things that this flesh wants more and
[2:08:20] more do you have that loss for Christ
[2:08:23] I give their glory and the preeminence
[2:08:26] to Christ not to that
[2:08:29] yay Dulles I count all things but loss
[2:08:32] for the excellency I count all things
[2:08:36] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[2:08:39] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[2:08:46] suffered the loss of all things now for
[2:08:49] the excellency of the knowledge or will
[2:08:52] that one interfere with my knowledge you
[2:08:53] said well you would think on that morn
[2:08:56] you think on Jesus and he said to count
[2:09:00] that they said but dung that I may win
[2:09:02] Christ and be found in him not any might
[2:09:07] own righteousness which is of the law
[2:09:09] but that which is through the faith of
[2:09:11] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[2:09:14] by faith amen verse 10 that I may know
[2:09:23] him do you know him that I may know him
[2:09:28] and the power of his resurrection don't
[2:09:33] stop there as I bill to be legen he's
[2:09:37] gone on as he I heard preach on one time
[2:09:41] and he said when we were in Pentecost he
[2:09:45] said we just read the first part of it
[2:09:47] period but he said when we got out we
[2:09:51] went on beyond that he said in Pentecost
[2:09:55] we wanted to know him in the power of
[2:09:56] his resurrection where there's a lot of
[2:09:59] message believers like that and they
[2:10:00] stopped there but he said go on and he
[2:10:04] said to know him in the power of his
[2:10:06] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[2:10:09] sufferings hmm and then II want that
[2:10:16] because if you're going to be into the
[2:10:18] word and stay with the word take your
[2:10:20] stand with a word you're going to suffer
[2:10:21] oh yeah the things you're gonna suffer
[2:10:25] the more you stand and I tell you the
[2:10:28] closer we get to the end the more you're
[2:10:29] gonna suffer because the hour is coming
[2:10:32] when when they'll take take those Bibles

[2:10:52] it in Quebec yeah and it's like one time
[2:10:59] in in in in the United States they
[2:11:01] they're in one school they were having a
[2:11:03] problem with thieves and they were
[2:11:06] stealing listed they said what in the
[2:11:07] world we're gonna do

[2:11:10] said once your buddy sign there thou
[2:11:13] shalt not steal but they're not gonna do
[2:11:17] that because it's the scripture it's the
[2:11:21] Bible is a commandment oh you want to
[2:11:25] stop this put that sign there that was
[2:11:27] your now or it is written they'll say
[2:11:32] the Lord nope not gonna have it getting
[2:11:37] less and less spiritual as I said
[2:11:39] churches are getting smaller and smaller
[2:11:40] smaller yeah the numbers are going down
[2:11:45] down down god help us
[2:11:47] but brother the true elect a man no
[2:11:51] wonder the pot Oh God said he said there

[2:11:55] on the earth to go in the rapture living
[2:11:57] Saints living Saints Oh what about a
[2:12:03] number that no man can number where
[2:12:04] they're already gone on and they're
[2:12:07] waiting on us
[2:12:08] and there's gonna be very very few
[2:12:10] living Saints through interruption
[2:12:12] didn't want had to faith they're
[2:12:14] refusing the third pole
[2:12:16] - that's ordained to bring us to the
[2:12:19] revelation of rapturing faith to get us
[2:12:23] to get out of here and go out remember
[2:12:27] Jesus laid down his life voluntarily and
[2:12:31] picked it up again now he's in us so we
[2:12:34] can pick it up but we gotta lay down
[2:12:37] their lives are in this world
[2:12:43] we got to put the rapture and give the
[2:12:44] rapture more preeminence than this life
[2:12:48] if you want to go you got to give
[2:12:51] preeminence to it oh but it's just going
[2:12:54] to happen no no no you you you prophet
[2:12:58] of God said God's waiting on us let's go
[2:13:03] let's go in the rapture grace of God so
[2:13:09] he said that I may know him in the power
[2:13:11] of his resurrection there rather that I
[2:13:15] may know him know him
[2:13:17] there's three things know him and the
[2:13:22] power is resurrection and the Fellowship
[2:13:24] of his sufferings being made conformable
[2:13:27] unto his death that's tremendous know
[2:13:33] him and the power of his resurrection
[2:13:35] and the Fellowship of his sufferings
[2:13:38] being made conformable unto his death if
[2:13:41] by any means I might attain under the
[2:13:44] resurrection of the Dead amen and he
[2:13:50] said not as I'd already attained either
[2:13:52] already perfect but I follow after that
[2:13:55] if that I may apprehend that for which
[2:13:59] also I am apprehended of Christ and
[2:14:02] brethren I count not myself to have
[2:14:05] apprehended but this one thing I do
[2:14:07] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:14:09] and reaching forth unto those things
[2:14:11] which are before I press toward the mark
[2:14:14] for the prize of the high calling of God
[2:14:17] in Christ Jesus and brother were
[2:14:21] reaching forth unto those things which
[2:14:22] are it says before but there's a center
[2:14:30] reference there and it says we're
[2:14:32] reaching for those things that are up
[2:14:34] upward the rapture the resurrection by
[2:14:40] the grace of God I press toward the mark
[2:14:44] for the prize of the high calling of God
[2:14:47] in Christ Jesus you have the press
[2:14:50] toward the mark
[2:14:51] by the grace of God grace the unmerited
[2:14:57] but freely given love and favor of God
[2:15:00] toward man brother don't forget that it
[2:15:04] includes the love of God and man is
[2:15:08] undeserving and unworthy of it in his
[2:15:11] flesh but God is looking at the art by
[2:15:17] grace amen let me finish with a quote of
[2:15:25] the Prophet and it was the message where
[2:15:35] I think Pentecost failed well there's
[2:15:41] many a believer failing and it says when
[2:15:47] you get over to heaven and you want to
[2:15:51] look me up I'll tell you where to find
[2:15:56] me they may he said there's a river of
[2:16:00] life
[2:16:01] running along there you see and there's
[2:16:05] some evergreen trees standing there and
[2:16:07] he said you know and they take the
[2:16:10] leaves off of them to heal the nation's
[2:16:12] and this was the devotion I think for
[2:16:15] today in brother Tim dodgiest brother

[2:20:16] made flesh and dwelt among us amen
[2:20:23] he went back to eternity a man then come
