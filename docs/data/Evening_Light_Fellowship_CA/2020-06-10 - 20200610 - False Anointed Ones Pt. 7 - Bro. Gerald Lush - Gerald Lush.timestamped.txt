[47:43] that
[47:44] attention by the grace of God so the
[47:46] Lord bless
[47:48] you and it's again it's uh oh it's
[47:53] amazing that we have so many here
[47:56] amen as brother Bob said they're all on
[47:58] one
[48:00] side but well we trust that that it's is
[48:03] representing our stand for the
[48:05] gospel amen we're not divided we're
[48:08] we're United by the grace of God so it's
[48:12] amazing that we have so many here it's
[48:14] usually five or 10 but now we I think
[48:17] we're allowed 20 amen so I trust soon
[48:20] that we will be allowed all the rest as
[48:22] well to come because uh we we have
[48:26] something like 30 or 30 OD or more here
[48:29] in uh in St John's and again there's
[48:32] there's a number online of course
[48:35] outside the city and it's amazing too
[48:38] not just in not just in Newland there
[48:40] are those outside the province outside
[48:43] Newland that are that are watching our
[48:45] service so we thank the Lord for that
[48:48] and I bring uh greetings from Brother
[48:52] Mondo he called today and and also
[48:56] brother John kades and uh Brother Martin
[49:01] Warner and I believe it was today that I
[49:03] spoke to all three of them amen so I
[49:06] thank the Lord for that and uh brother
[49:09] Manda wanted me to send his greetings to
[49:11] all the saints here and uh that he's in
[49:14] prayer for us and it's been a while
[49:16] since he's been in church up there uh
[49:19] because of what's going on in
[49:22] Canada and uh well really it's around
[49:25] the world
[49:26] because according to our brother John
[49:27] Kadesh this is also influencing the
[49:30] churches in in Africa and in the condo
[49:34] of course where his his father pastors
[49:37] the church but again practically all the
[49:40] churches are closed in the condo and uh
[49:43] and also uh the churches there on
[49:48] Congo and uh the churches are are rather
[49:52] uh yeah churches are closed in in Ghana
[49:54] and and you Uganda and other parts of
[49:57] Africa as well I've had email from uh
[50:00] some of the Brethren there and it's it's
[50:02] it's striking them hard when they
[50:04] consider you know that they're not not
[50:07] not allowed to get together and
[50:09] sometimes they will try to get together
[50:10] maybe in a home for a cottage meeting so
[50:13] we pray the grace of God be with the
[50:15] Saints around the world Amen so uh it's
[50:19] it's I trust listen it's not easy and
[50:22] it's not easy for the ministry so I
[50:24] trust it's not easy for the Believers as
[50:27] well you know that you you feel the
[50:29] pressure you feel the dist stress of
[50:31] being kept out of church and not not not
[50:34] allowed to to get together as the
[50:36] scriptures forsake not the Assembly of
[50:38] yourselves together don't forsake it but
[50:41] there are a lot of believers who have
[50:42] forsaken it and there's going to be more
[50:44] believers who will forsake it but I
[50:46] trust we're numbered with those who who
[50:48] want that we're going to be numbered
[50:50] with those who who Jesus is looking for
[50:52] when he comes those amen those that he
[50:56] has gathered together in his name and
[50:58] that he is in he is in the midst by the
[51:00] grace of God so again the grace of God
[51:04] to our brother Mondo and to his family
[51:07] in Ontario and Au brother John Kadesh of
[51:11] course right now he's living in Quebec
[51:13] but he's right on the border with
[51:15] Ontario and near near hotal because
[51:18] that's where he is I think where he
[51:19] works usually is in Ottawa and where his
[51:23] uh education is is in Ottawa but of
[51:26] course because of what's going on he's
[51:28] he's not involved with any of that right
[51:30] now so we pray the grace of God to
[51:32] Brother John Kadesh and he also he sends
[51:35] his greetings to the Saints here amen
[51:38] and of course there are times when he
[51:39] feels that he wish he was back in
[51:42] Newland but again it might be another
[51:44] few months now because of what's going
[51:47] on before that he'll be able to get back
[51:49] to newf land so God bless brother John
[51:52] Kadesh and brother martin
[51:56] Warner he called twice I didn't get his
[51:59] first call but the uh but the second
[52:03] time I talk he called again so I I
[52:04] returned his call and uh he wants to
[52:08] send his greetings to the Saints here
[52:11] and he wanted to thank me for what we
[52:14] ministered on during the last service on
[52:18] Sunday and he said brother he said that
[52:20] was good and he said I was blessed he
[52:23] said and and he found that it was spirit
[52:25] spiritual food for him he said I really
[52:27] appreciated it so he said thank you
[52:30] brother and he highlighted a number of
[52:31] things that I had brought out and I that
[52:33] I had mentioned he said good he said
[52:36] that was a blessing and so he said thank
[52:38] you brother and he said of course he's
[52:41] with brother Jerry Fury in Ontario or in
[52:45] in Alberta rather and uh he does
[52:48] minister at times for brother Jerry and
[52:52] the Lord willing he'll be ministering
[52:53] for brother Jerry on Sunday so we pray
[52:56] God bless our brother martin Warner amen
[53:00] and uh he would like he said to be able
[53:03] to make a trip to Newland sometime and
[53:06] there is a apparently a couple that did
[53:09] visit here some years ago and I
[53:11] understood they stayed with our brother
[53:13] Matthew sister Amberg and man and his
[53:16] wife and uh they had told Brother Martin
[53:19] about their trip to Newland and
[53:21] apparently they're in the same church
[53:23] and uh that if they come to new land
[53:25] again brother martin is open that him
[53:27] and his wife can come with him amen and
[53:31] fellowship with us amen so God bless
[53:34] those saints that are viewing Us online

[1:06:37] pray the grace of God and and the mercy
[1:06:40] of God to his family that are no doubt
[1:06:42] mourning the loss and mourning what
[1:06:43] happened to this gentleman but again we
[1:06:46] know that when it has a worldwide effect
[1:06:49] surely somewhere God knew that it was
[1:06:51] going to happen and God permitted it to
[1:06:53] happen amen so it's for a reason
[1:06:56] considering the the the last days we are
[1:06:58] living in the last days so brother it's
[1:07:01] going to be in the Bible the Bible tells
[1:07:03] us what we're what the world is going to
[1:07:05] be experiencing in the last days and
[1:07:07] it's again it's in the scripture that
[1:07:09] brother bam brother Brown used his text
[1:07:11] for the message on the anointed ones at
[1:07:13] the end time and he and he took his text
[1:07:16] from Matthew 24 concerning the false
[1:07:20] Christ and the false prophets but also
[1:07:23] in in scripture it says concerning
[1:07:26] what's going to happen and happen and
[1:07:28] going on and going on and leading down
[1:07:30] to the end of all things it says all
[1:07:33] these are the beginning of Sorrows so
[1:07:36] what's going on in the world now and and
[1:07:38] no doubt maybe other things that may
[1:07:40] happen it's all going to be the as it
[1:07:42] were the beginning of Sorrows but
[1:07:44] somewhere in the midst of all of that
[1:07:46] God is going to resurrect and Rapture is
[1:07:49] is bright amen and we're going to be
[1:07:51] caught away into Eternity for the
[1:07:53] marriage supper of the Lamb we might be
[1:07:56] taken as as physical marriage spiritual
[1:07:58] marriage supper now and there's many
[1:08:00] that feel that that's what we're doing
[1:08:02] there there's many Believers that that
[1:08:04] are that are preaching that this is the
[1:08:06] marriage supper of the Lamb the re the
[1:08:08] revelation of the word the message of
[1:08:10] the hour well brother I believe that
[1:08:12] we're going to go to a real real meal
[1:08:15] with Jesus amen we're going to sit with
[1:08:18] him at not just in his throne but sit
[1:08:20] with him at the table by the grace of
[1:08:23] almighty God God Amen and again as I
[1:08:26] said that I was in a home somewhere one
[1:08:28] time and somebody highlighted the fact
[1:08:31] that uh they saw me get up and I was
[1:08:34] leaving or doing something and I was
[1:08:36] focusing on a picture that was on the
[1:08:39] wall in that house and it was a picture
[1:08:42] of Jesus sitting at the table and and
[1:08:45] and with with with the bride with all
[1:08:47] these Believers and they were eaing and
[1:08:49] I said well praise the Lord we're going
[1:08:51] to have a wonderful time H yeah and a
[1:08:54] brother that was there he went he went
[1:08:56] and began to spread the word oh you
[1:08:58] don't you don't know this but brother
[1:09:00] jural believes there's going to be a
[1:09:01] real marriage supper yeah he said
[1:09:04] because he said in the house he said he
[1:09:05] was looking at the picture of the
[1:09:07] marriage supper and and he and he said
[1:09:09] he praise the Lord for it and and oh
[1:09:12] yeah they started to spread this word
[1:09:13] around brother jural agrees with that
[1:09:15] brother jural believes that they didn't
[1:09:17] believe it they didn't believe in in
[1:09:19] they believe that we are having a
[1:09:20] marriage supper now in the hearing of
[1:09:22] the word but be honest with you the
[1:09:24] brother that that that spread that
[1:09:26] around he doesn't believe the message
[1:09:27] anymore so he's not eating he's not
[1:09:31] eating the word spiritually he won't be
[1:09:33] there physically amen so I pray the
[1:09:35] grace of God to help us brother amen
[1:09:38] let's believe brother when and God lays
[1:09:41] lays this out lays that out to get us to
[1:09:43] look look then and don't look this way
[1:09:46] don't look that way you just keep your
[1:09:47] keep your eyes on the promise keep your
[1:09:49] heart on the promise amen keep looking
[1:09:51] for the Fulfillment of that word by the
[1:09:53] grace of almighty God Amen so the Lord
[1:09:56] help us is my
[1:09:58] prayer as we get into the word and
[1:10:01] brother when we see all this happening
[1:10:03] and there a time of sorrow and
[1:10:04] everything is coming upon the earth oh
[1:10:06] brother I pray that we're not going to
[1:10:08] get caught up with that we're going to
[1:10:10] get caught up with what God has done not
[1:10:12] what what he's allowing the enemy to do
[1:10:15] and the devil out there amen cuz Satan
[1:10:17] is come down with great wrath knowing
[1:10:19] his time is short so God's going to let
[1:10:21] him do a lot of things but again he he
[1:10:23] can't do he can only do what God will
[1:10:25] allow him to do and God will per permit
[1:10:28] this for a reason that for a reason and
[1:10:30] like I said what's going on now is it
[1:10:32] well is it God or is it the devil well
[1:10:34] is God is over over it all and God can
[1:10:38] stop it God can Ender it God can God can
[1:10:40] just do this and not let it happen at
[1:10:42] all but God he permits this and he
[1:10:45] permits that so there's nothing that the
[1:10:47] devil can do without God's permission
[1:10:49] amen so brother God permitted him to do
[1:10:52] what he did in the Garden of Eden amen
[1:10:54] KN only that God permitted him to do
[1:10:56] what he did before time and we'll get
[1:10:59] into that scripture amen concerning what
[1:11:02] a God allowed in eternity and again
[1:11:05] we'll understand amen that the anointed
[1:11:07] ones is not is not just here the
[1:11:09] anointing on is not just in in the last
[1:11:11] days but brother brah is violating that
[1:11:14] that spirit in the last days he said now
[1:11:16] he said I want to talk about the
[1:11:18] anointed ones at the end time right but
[1:11:20] again whether there anointed ones from
[1:11:22] eternity down true time amen and on back
[1:11:26] to Eternity that's right by the grace of
[1:11:29] almighty God and we'll show you
[1:11:31] according to the scriptures amen that
[1:11:33] God permitted this to begin in eternity
[1:11:37] God allowed it to begin in eternity God
[1:11:39] said well he said I I created this and I
[1:11:42] created that he said so God is taking
[1:11:44] the responsibility for it exactly
[1:11:46] because he's God because he's God Amen
[1:11:50] and he is all knowing and brother God
[1:11:53] knew this was going to happen God knew
[1:11:55] that was going to happen brother there's
[1:11:56] nothing hid from him there are things
[1:11:58] that are HID from the devil and there's
[1:12:00] things that are HID from the seat of
[1:12:02] from the devil's seat and sometimes God
[1:12:04] hides things from it from his own seat
[1:12:06] and he reveal to him just what he wants
[1:12:08] them to believe just what he wants them
[1:12:11] to know amen because if God revealed
[1:12:13] everything about himself to us in in
[1:12:16] this in the flesh that we are in there's
[1:12:18] a lot of things we wouldn't understand
[1:12:20] that's true my ways he said are not your
[1:12:23] ways my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:12:25] as I as the heaven is above the Earth so
[1:12:27] are my ways and my thoughts above yours
[1:12:29] amen because why because we've been born
[1:12:32] in sin and shaped in iniquity as it were
[1:12:35] amen amen but brother when we get back
[1:12:37] to Eternity there's things that that we
[1:12:39] don't know now that we'll know then
[1:12:41] things that we don't realize now will
[1:12:43] realize then amen because we're getting
[1:12:46] back into into our godship amen because
[1:12:51] Sons and Daughters of God are gods
[1:12:54] amen proba of God said don't you know
[1:12:56] that he said if if you're a Son of God
[1:12:59] you're a God
[1:13:01] Amen you're you're you're a daughter of
[1:13:03] God you're a God so brother God help us
[1:13:06] to to have realize and have the
[1:13:08] revelation of who we are amen let's be
[1:13:12] careful oh brother let's me let me ask
[1:13:14] you a
[1:13:15] question and when he got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:19] and brother what evidence do you have
[1:13:21] that you got the Holy Ghost how do you
[1:13:23] know
[1:13:23] that you got the Holy Ghost amen come on
[1:13:28] you you you ought to have the evidence
[1:13:30] you ought to have the oh yeah oh I got
[1:13:31] no worries Lord I Thank you for giving
[1:13:33] me the Holy Ghost I thank you not
[1:13:35] because you're giving me the Holy Ghost
[1:13:37] but I thank you for baptizing me with
[1:13:38] the Holy Ghost because why it's the new
[1:13:41] birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:44] Christ in you the whole of Glory so how
[1:13:46] do you know you got Christ in you how
[1:13:49] you know you got the Holy Ghost In You
[1:13:52] amen I've tried to explain it something
[1:13:54] about see something in your heart
[1:13:57] something on the inside of the inside
[1:13:58] something in your soul Amen brother like
[1:14:01] I said it's getting to a place where one
[1:14:03] time we would feel the anointing in the
[1:14:05] atmosphere in a church we feel
[1:14:07] especially in a church but you also feel
[1:14:10] the anointing even even outside the
[1:14:12] church you feel the anointing when you
[1:14:13] when you walk here you go there you go
[1:14:15] somewhere else you feel that anointing
[1:14:17] but now it's got to the place where you
[1:14:19] where I don't feel the anointing in the
[1:14:21] atmosphere like I felt no of years ago
[1:14:24] no not by any means what I the
[1:14:26] atmosphere that was there when I was
[1:14:28] just just a young boy or the atmosphere
[1:14:30] that was there when I was a teenager the
[1:14:32] atmosphere was there when I first came
[1:14:33] to the message brother that that
[1:14:35] atmosphere is not there no more no not
[1:14:38] by any ma brother it's it's it's in me
[1:14:41] but it's not out there it is in the
[1:14:43] bride but it's not out there one time
[1:14:45] brother that anointing was was so
[1:14:47] powerful brother and so much in control
[1:14:49] of the bride and there were so many
[1:14:51] Believers brother that that when
[1:14:53] wherever you went you felt the power of
[1:14:54] God you felt the presence of God you
[1:14:56] felt the anointing of God and brother
[1:14:58] you could go into a believer's home and
[1:15:00] on one the anointing was there oh yeah
[1:15:02] you said praise the Lord Allelujah thank
[1:15:05] you Jesus for your presence amen we
[1:15:08] couldn't forget him we couldn't ignore
[1:15:09] him amen but the atmosphere is so bad
[1:15:12] now Amen brother that that is very there
[1:15:16] very very very few that are spiritual
[1:15:19] amen oh I pray God help us that we be
[1:15:22] spiritually minded amen by the grace of
[1:15:25] almighty God and as evidence of what's
[1:15:28] on the inside of the inside amen so what
[1:15:31] evidence do you have that's up to you
[1:15:34] you you can look in the mirror of of the
[1:15:36] word of God and say well I believe I got
[1:15:38] the Holy Ghost because this because of
[1:15:40] this because not just say I believe the
[1:15:43] message or I see this or I see that
[1:15:45] because the devil sees it oh yeah and
[1:15:47] the devil knows that it's the message he
[1:15:50] knows that it's the word but brother you
[1:15:53] got to you got to have that confirmation
[1:15:55] in your heart and in your soul believest
[1:15:58] thou this but in your heart amen not in
[1:16:01] your head there's too many with it in
[1:16:03] their heads but how do you know you got
[1:16:05] the Holy Ghost I pray you got the
[1:16:06] confirmation in your heart amen you feel
[1:16:09] that burning in your soul amen it's not
[1:16:12] out there in the atmosphere but it now
[1:16:15] it's narrowing down narrowing down to
[1:16:17] just in the bride not not just in the
[1:16:20] bride and out around the bride amen
[1:16:22] because why because the anointing was
[1:16:24] there and there were a lot more people
[1:16:26] with with the anointing and wherever
[1:16:27] they went oh that anointing was there oh
[1:16:30] yeah like I said I've gone into homes
[1:16:32] and felt the anointing I met Believers
[1:16:34] and I felt the anointing amen around
[1:16:36] them and so on it it was in them and
[1:16:38] around them but now it's getting fewer
[1:16:40] and fewer and fewer amen so the grace of
[1:16:44] God be with us brother and sister help
[1:16:46] us amen we need the help of God we what
[1:16:51] I tell you it's coming down to Faith
[1:16:54] amen oh I feel this I know got nothing
[1:16:56] to do what you feel now it's what you
[1:16:58] believe and believe it in your heart and
[1:17:00] in your soul amen not only that it
[1:17:02] controls you amen and you're living it
[1:17:05] out by the grace of God don't tell me
[1:17:09] show me amen and God is goddess wants
[1:17:12] the same thing don't tell me oh I
[1:17:15] believe this show me you what you
[1:17:17] believe God knows whether it's in your
[1:17:20] heart or in your head there's too many
[1:17:23] got in their heads and that's why we
[1:17:24] don't feel that anointing as I said in
[1:17:26] the atmosphere like we did it's and like
[1:17:29] the prophet of God said when he comes he
[1:17:31] said he said he he might get get a few
[1:17:35] here and a few there oh I believe that
[1:17:37] Believers are getting fewer and fewer
[1:17:39] and fewer I mean true Holy Ghost
[1:17:42] Believers amen don't ignore what Luther
[1:17:46] had don't ignore what Wesley had or the
[1:17:48] Pentecostals amen because God wants all
[1:17:51] of that plus what he's done in this hour
[1:17:54] for the bride the crown brother he's
[1:17:56] going to Crown he's going to Crown those
[1:17:59] that got Luther Wesley Pentecost and the
[1:18:01] others he going to oh yeah they get the
[1:18:03] crown Hallelujah as the bride of Christ
[1:18:07] grace of God to us brother it is
[1:18:10] serious amen so let's read in Revelation
[1:18:14] chapter
[1:18:17] 16 again being led by the spirit to say
[1:18:19] what he wants me to say and thank God
[1:18:23] that Believers have been blessed online
[1:18:26] with certain Revelations that God has
[1:18:28] brought out but in Revelation chapter 16
[1:18:31] and verse 12 and the sixth Angel poured
[1:18:34] out his vial upon the great river
[1:18:37] Euphrates and the water thereof was
[1:18:39] dried up that the way of the kings of
[1:18:44] the East might be
[1:18:46] prepared amen and I saw three unclean
[1:18:51] spirits like fogs come out of the mouth
[1:18:55] of the
[1:18:56] Dragon God permitting it for a
[1:18:59] reason and out of the mouth of the Beast
[1:19:03] and out of the mouth of the false
[1:19:05] prophet
[1:19:07] amen God permitting the true prophet and
[1:19:10] God permitting false prophets to rise on
[1:19:13] the scene just think they are they they
[1:19:15] profess to be
[1:19:17] prophets but there there is a true
[1:19:20] prophet and then there are false
[1:19:21] prophets
[1:19:23] and it says for they are the spirits of
[1:19:27] devils Grace that we're not under the
[1:19:29] spirit of a devil but under the spirit
[1:19:31] of God not under the spirit of the devil
[1:19:34] but we're under the spirit of Jesus Amen
[1:19:39] but he said these here the false
[1:19:40] prophets the Beast the dragon amen the
[1:19:43] unclean spirits he said they are the
[1:19:46] spirits of devils but look working
[1:19:50] miracles no one of the prophets
[1:19:53] highlighted concerning the anointed ones
[1:19:55] at the end time false Christ he said
[1:19:57] false anointed ones but they're true
[1:19:59] anointed ones but he said with false
[1:20:01] teaching yeah God help us don't don't go
[1:20:05] by the anointing go by the teaching amen
[1:20:09] are they staying with the word are they
[1:20:11] encouraging you to stay with the word
[1:20:13] are they laying out the word to get you
[1:20:15] to line up with this line up with that
[1:20:17] amen it's not to get you excited and
[1:20:20] emotional oh we believe the message We
[1:20:22] Believe there's going to be a
[1:20:23] resurrection there's going to be a
[1:20:25] Rapture that's good but we got to have
[1:20:26] the experience in US amen the

[1:20:57] up into a Heavenly place in Christ Amen
[1:21:00] brother and again what's going on in
[1:21:03] Heavenly places he said that's where the
[1:21:05] word's revealed praise the Lord and why
[1:21:08] why why is that it is to give us more
[1:21:10] faith it is to give us a greater Faith

[1:23:27] Grace brother I'll let you sit down in a
[1:23:29] moment but as I heard a brother preacher
[1:23:32] said one time listen he said I I I've
[1:23:34] been preaching I've been standing here
[1:23:36] for so long and he said you've been only
[1:23:38] standing for a short while so he said
[1:23:40] I'll let you sit down eventually amen
[1:23:44] there's a brother from the states
[1:23:45] somewhere I believe
[1:23:47] amen so brother we see all these Spirits
[1:23:50] working and he said and again as I said
[1:23:54] there devils working miracles he said
[1:23:57] which go forth onto the kings of the
[1:23:59] earth and of the whole world to gather
[1:24:03] them to the battle of the great day of
[1:24:05] God Almighty concerning the battle of
[1:24:07] Armageddon I trust we're not going to be
[1:24:09] here for that no not by any means if we
[1:24:13] I trust if we see it we're going to come
[1:24:14] down with him at the end of it
[1:24:17] amen the old I come he said as a
[1:24:21] thief
[1:24:23] and blessed is he that WTH and keepeth
[1:24:26] his garments lest he walk naked and they
[1:24:29] see his shame amen and he gathered them
[1:24:33] together into a place called in the
[1:24:35] Hebrew tongue Armageddon God bless his
[1:24:38] word you may be
[1:24:40] seated amen so praying the grace of God
[1:24:44] concerning the anointed ones in the in
[1:24:45] the last days and brother as he been F
[1:24:50] focusing on it in Matthew chapter 24
[1:24:53] and brother it's it's prophesied again I
[1:24:55] believe it might be highlighted in
[1:24:56] Thessalonians and now in the Book of
[1:24:59] Revelation concerning the last days
[1:25:02] brother the false anointed ones and
[1:25:05] you're going to and it says these are
[1:25:07] the
[1:25:08] spirits like like frogs out of the mouth
[1:25:11] of a dragon he said of the mouth of a
[1:25:13] beast and out of the mouth of a false
[1:25:16] prophet oh we're going to we're going to
[1:25:18] recognize unclean spirits and we're
[1:25:20] going to recognize oh yeah the dragons
[1:25:22] and the beasts but what about the false
[1:25:25] prophets amen because according to what
[1:25:28] the prophet of God brings out here he
[1:25:30] said the false prophets he said are
[1:25:32] going to be under the anointing of a
[1:25:34] true Prophet as well but he said the
[1:25:36] only difference he said is their
[1:25:37] teaching and he said the false prophet
[1:25:39] is going the true Prophet staying with
[1:25:42] the word and he is iighting the word the
[1:25:44] word of God the word of God and the
[1:25:46] whole truth and nothing but the truth
[1:25:48] but he a false prophet he say it's going
[1:25:49] to add a word here and take away a word
[1:25:52] amen and he said yet he said he is he is
[1:25:55] identified in the word he is identified
[1:25:57] by the scriptures as being a prophet a
[1:26:01] amen as an anointed one amen and they
[1:26:04] are anointed and brother we've and I've
[1:26:06] experienced down through the years
[1:26:08] Ministries that have been anointed but
[1:26:10] brother it's not yeah it's a true
[1:26:12] anointing and is the anointing of God
[1:26:14] because why it is God anointing his word
[1:26:17] but again what what it is is that when
[1:26:19] when God is is is putting the word in
[1:26:21] the en is there to influence and add a
[1:26:23] word and the enemy is there to influence
[1:26:25] and take away a word amen yes that is
[1:26:28] the truth and yet but God is permitting
[1:26:30] it for a reason God is permitting it
[1:26:33] because he's going to bring out the seed
[1:26:34] of God and he's going to manifest the
[1:26:37] the seed of the serpent oh yeah because
[1:26:40] again there is a truth there and they're
[1:26:43] and they're both feeding on the word as
[1:26:45] it was in the Garden of Eden God has
[1:26:47] said and then again the enemy comes in
[1:26:49] and the serpent seed comes in and says
[1:26:51] yeah God said but so he's they're going
[1:26:55] to they're going to stay with the word
[1:26:56] as a word but add a word and they'll
[1:26:58] stay with a word and take away a word
[1:27:00] amen but they're under a false anointing
[1:27:03] not a false anointing no a true
[1:27:05] anointing but a false teaching amen
[1:27:08] because it was through the true
[1:27:09] anointing that they got the word the
[1:27:11] true anointing that they know what God
[1:27:12] has said amen but it's the enemy comes
[1:27:16] in with a false teaching to get them to
[1:27:18] add a word or take away a word Amen
[1:27:21] brother that's exactly what the enemy
[1:27:23] was using in the Book of Genesis and I
[1:27:25] tell you this we can go back to Eternity
[1:27:27] and we'll find out that the enemy was in
[1:27:30] eternity amen and brother he was
[1:27:32] injecting his thoughts Amen to well yeah
[1:27:36] he was an angel but again the the enemy
[1:27:39] that angel was injecting his thoughts to
[1:27:41] the other Angels amen and brother to the
[1:27:44] to the effect that to the effect that
[1:27:46] that he influenced thousands of angels
[1:27:48] so that when he was cast out those
[1:27:50] angels went with him and amen just think
[1:27:53] of that oh my brother sister oh my what
[1:27:57] an hour that there is a deception of
[1:28:00] angels amen out there in the presence of
[1:28:03] almighty God are there in the presence
[1:28:05] of Elohim amen that he was the one that
[1:28:08] created all things he was the one that
[1:28:10] created the Angels amen and I don't know
[1:28:14] how many may be thousands or millions of
[1:28:15] years that they might have been there
[1:28:17] amen Experiencing God Amen and then find
[1:28:22] that the devil's influence was going to
[1:28:24] influence those angels amen and when
[1:28:27] then when when he was cast out brother
[1:28:29] and sister tell listen those angels were
[1:28:31] cast out with them oh my God have mercy
[1:28:34] on us Lord have mercy on us that we're
[1:28:37] not going to be deceived brother it was
[1:28:40] that close oh it said no wonder he said
[1:28:42] so close would deceive the very elect if
[1:28:45] possible amen so close that it was in
[1:28:48] heaven so close that it that it deceived
[1:28:50] the Angels amen man brother if the if
[1:28:54] all those angels were deceived brother
[1:28:56] what about the word what about the the
[1:28:58] the the the the human being that God
[1:29:01] created on the earth and put in flesh
[1:29:04] amen and brother the angels are up here
[1:29:07] but man is down here amen and brother
[1:29:11] the only way you're not going to be
[1:29:12] deceived is you'd have to be the true
[1:29:13] seed of God Amen you have absolutely
[1:29:16] have the seat of God in your soul the
[1:29:20] seat of God on the inside of the inside
[1:29:23] in Your Heart by the grace of God Amen
[1:29:26] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:29:28] might not sin against thee amen because
[1:29:31] why because that's where the seed is
[1:29:33] it's in the heart amen we amen so can
[1:29:37] you say that I'm born again because I'm
[1:29:39] a new creature in my heart amen and I
[1:29:42] believe the word and I believe the whole
[1:29:44] truth nothing but the truth and I'm not
[1:29:46] going to head to it I'm not going to
[1:29:48] take from it and I'm not going to weaken
[1:29:49] the word amen by make an excuse excuse
[1:29:52] for this excuse for that amen many are
[1:29:55] are going to weaken the word by making
[1:29:56] excuses for the weakness of their flesh
[1:30:00] amen the weakness of their thoughts the
[1:30:02] weakness of their brain the weakness of
[1:30:04] of this these feelings amen no no if

[1:30:22] don't do that he said get the beyond me
[1:30:25] Satan amen because he knew that Satan
[1:30:28] was there to prevent the the word being
[1:30:31] made flesh and Satan is here to prevent
[1:30:35] the word for this hour for this age
[1:30:37] being made flesh in you and me amen that
[1:30:41] what God wants to do in US brother Satan
[1:30:43] is there to prevent that God Satan knows
[1:30:45] what's going on because the Bible says
[1:30:47] he has come down knowing his time is
[1:30:50] short so and if he knows his time is

[1:30:55] I pray Grace that we're seeing what God

[1:31:25] deceive them more and more and more but
[1:31:27] hading more taken away more from the
[1:31:29] truth what for it weakens and weakens
[1:31:32] and weakens Faith amen but the True

[1:32:12] our souls we're going to be there and
[1:32:14] we're going to do as as the word did in
[1:32:16] flesh 2,000 years ago when the enemy
[1:32:19] came in in this person and the enemy
[1:32:21] came in that person trying to deceive
[1:32:23] Jesus trying to persuade Jesus don't do
[1:32:25] this don't do that no oh was the enemy
[1:32:29] tried and if he tried in Jesus he's
[1:32:31] going to try in you and me amen amen
[1:32:35] amen to get what for to divert us from
[1:32:37] what God is doing to divert us from what

[1:33:39] there in our minds to try to get us to
[1:33:41] disbelief the enemy is in our minds to
[1:33:43] get us to doubt amen but brother no
[1:33:47] matter what the enemy will say No Matter
[1:33:49] What feelings they give you you're going
[1:33:50] to come back as Jesus came back and said
[1:33:53] get thee Bey me Satan it is written amen
[1:33:57] thus said the Lord amen we're not going
[1:34:00] by feelings Jesus wasn't going by
[1:34:02] feelings he was going by faith amen if
[1:34:05] he was going by feelings he would have
[1:34:07] maybe listened to Peter and not went to
[1:34:09] Jerusalem if he was going by feelings
[1:34:11] and our faith he would have avoided
[1:34:13] Jerusalem and just did this and just did
[1:34:15] that amen but no he knew that he had to
[1:34:18] do it to redeem us right he had to do it

[1:34:45] amen oh we're dealing with the devil
[1:34:47] we're dealing with this oh yeah but
[1:34:49] brother's nothing compared to what Jesus
[1:34:51] dealt with
[1:34:52] and all the demons he was dealing with
[1:34:54] all the spirits that he was dealing with
[1:34:56] amen not only that Jesus being the word
[1:34:59] of God in flesh he was more conscious of

[1:35:04] conscious of those demons than we are oh
[1:35:06] yeah his presence with with me and his
[1:35:09] presence in US brother is making us

[1:57:16] they're not
[1:57:17] saved oh brother and yet their Believers
[1:57:20] think oh we're just Believers we're
[1:57:22] Believers and they're going to hell and
[1:57:24] we're going to heaven no you got that
[1:57:27] attitude you're going to hell and
[1:57:28] they're going to heaven amen don't don't
[1:57:30] have that attitude brother because why
[1:57:33] we we believe that God has called us out
[1:57:35] yes amen but why why is he celebrating
[1:57:38] us to that extent because we're bride
[1:57:42] and I said to bride's going to sit with
[1:57:44] him in his throne the bride's going to
[1:57:46] sit with the married supper of the Lamb
[1:57:49] amen
[1:57:50] but the others I said she's in the city
[1:57:52] but the others are outside the
[1:57:54] city oh wonderful he said brother oh
[1:57:58] thank you praise the Lord he said
[1:58:00] brother that encourages me because he
[1:58:02] said some years ago he said I had this I
[1:58:04] took this stand and I took that stand
[1:58:06] and and I was wondered about this one
[1:58:08] and wondered about that one oh and he
[1:58:10] felt bad about this one or that one if
[1:58:12] if he felt that they were going to go to
[1:58:13] hell or didn't believe the message I
[1:58:16] said no brother they're not going to
[1:58:17] hell I said keep your attitude right
[1:58:20] keep your spirit right because they
[1:58:21] could be outside the city oh wonderful
[1:58:24] Hallelujah he said praise the Lord he so
[1:58:27] they'll come into the City and meet me I
[1:58:29] said yes I said then they'll go again so
[1:58:33] brother keep your at as I said I told
[1:58:35] you and many times I when I first come
[1:58:38] to the message my first sermon was about
[1:58:41] that yeah because when I when I came
[1:58:43] from the message first I met so many
[1:58:45] Believers oh my they had they had such a
[1:58:48] self-righteous attitude and they look
[1:58:51] down their noses on everyone outside the
[1:58:55] message oh yeah they did oh yeah they
[1:58:57] condemn them because they went there
[1:58:59] condemn them because they went to that
[1:59:00] church or that church I said look be
[1:59:02] careful I said you better leave them I
[1:59:05] said because God says some of them are
[1:59:07] his children like that woman that
[1:59:09] brother Brown was condemning because oh
[1:59:11] he condemned the woman and he condemn
[1:59:13] this person because of the way they
[1:59:14] dress because of the way they were
[1:59:16] living and the angel said don't do that
[1:59:18] you can condemn and that that but don't
[1:59:20] condemn them because he says some of
[1:59:22] them are my children amen so brother
[1:59:25] let's keep our attitude right our
[1:59:26] Spirits right whether it's to family or
[1:59:28] friends or neighbors amen because some
[1:59:31] of them are God's
[1:59:32] children hallelujah oh that's
[1:59:35] encouraging oh it's encouraging he said
[1:59:39] brother because he had been under maybe
[1:59:42] sometimes you you hear Ministries and
[1:59:44] they're condemning anyone and everyone
[1:59:45] outside the message that's not right no
[1:59:49] no don't thank God for what he got you
[1:59:52] given you to be the bride but remember
[1:59:55] you're pleading the token for them and
[1:59:57] the prophet of God said he said as long
[1:59:59] as the bride is on the earth there's
[2:00:02] Grace amen Grace well what I experienced
[2:00:07] when I first come to this word and this
[2:00:09] message it wasn't Grace only have Grace
[2:00:12] to one another but they never had no and
[2:00:14] they didn't have Grace for everyone and
[2:00:16] but then but they had no Grace for those
[2:00:18] outside
[2:00:19] but you got to have
[2:00:22] Grace got to have Grace because again
[2:00:25] what God what he said to the prophet

[2:00:41] didn't make it amen oh yeah you was
[2:00:45] surprised who made it to be the bride

[2:01:11] by the grace of God Amen so brother keep
[2:01:14] your attitude rate your spirit rate amen
[2:01:18] so brother understanding this too that
[2:01:21] we're experiencing the the the the
[2:01:24] dealing with the devil we're
[2:01:26] experiencing the anointing of the Holy
[2:01:27] Ghost with us and in us and trusting
[2:01:29] that he's got control of us in our
[2:01:32] souls make sure you're in this message
[2:01:36] because the message is in
[2:01:37] you and it's in your soul controlling
[2:01:40] you amen it's in your soul controlling
[2:01:43] your thoughts controlling your words
[2:01:45] controlling your days controlling your
[2:01:47] actions and reactions I don't care where
[2:01:49] it is not just in church and not just in
[2:01:52] your home but it's it's your whole
[2:01:56] life yeah morning noon and night no
[2:01:59] matter where you are no matter who
[2:02:00] you're dealing with you're going to be
[2:02:02] Jesus in flesh you're going to be the
[2:02:04] word and flesh you're going to have a
[2:02:06] right spirit and a right attitude by the
[2:02:08] grace of God or you'll take your stand
[2:02:10] for what's right or you will yeah but
[2:02:12] again you got to have a right spirit and
[2:02:15] right attitude you're not going to
[2:02:16] condemn this and condemn people you you
[2:02:19] condemn like the prophet like God told
[2:02:20] the prophet you can condemn what that
[2:02:22] woman is wearing but don't condemn
[2:02:24] her you can condemn what this one does
[2:02:27] and that one does don't do whatever but
[2:02:29] don't condemn
[2:02:31] them just pray the grace of God be with
[2:02:34] them
[2:02:35] amen so he's concerning the devil see
[2:02:39] Satan was in heaven he walked him down
[2:02:42] in the coals of
[2:02:43] fire but yet we know that somewhere
[2:02:46] somehow God permitted it God created
[2:02:50] him oh yeah and and and it brings out
[2:02:53] ear concerning concerning what what what
[2:02:56] struck Satan and while called Satan to
[2:02:58] do what he
[2:02:59] did oh
[2:03:01] yeah it was something that was in his
[2:03:04] heart and God permitted
[2:03:10] it that's why
[2:03:13] God in the New Birth brother he takes
[2:03:15] control of our
[2:03:17] hearts not our flesh not our minds but
[2:03:20] the heart from the inside out so what so
[2:03:24] that he can control us soul body and
[2:03:28] spirit
[2:03:30] amen so notice this was in heaven and
[2:03:33] brother when God created man he
[2:03:36] permitted it to come down to the Earth
[2:03:38] the enemy oh yeah God allowed
[2:03:42] it and God permitted it for a reason and
[2:03:46] sometimes he'll reveal what it why and
[2:03:48] other times he won't
[2:03:49] but brother it is to bring out what is
[2:03:51] it what war it is to bring out our faith
[2:03:54] that we believe God that we trust God
[2:03:58] and we love God because why we believe
[2:04:01] that regardless of what God permitted
[2:04:03] and what God allows it's all for a
[2:04:05] purpose and a reason that's
[2:04:08] right that's why God told us that's why
[2:04:11] God warned us that his thoughts are
[2:04:13] above ours and his ways are above ours
[2:04:17] cuz there are things that God would do
[2:04:19] there are things that God would permit
[2:04:21] amen that we would not understand but it
[2:04:25] will be a trial of our faith to believe
[2:04:27] God a tri of our faith that we're just
[2:04:30] trusting God Amen Lord we believe you
[2:04:33] and we believe your motive is right and
[2:04:36] your objective is right that whatever
[2:04:37] reason Lord that you're allowing this
[2:04:39] and allowing that we believe Lord you've
[2:04:41] got an eternal purpose amen amen a right
[2:04:46] motive a right objective amen Lord help
[2:04:49] us to go forth with that right motive
[2:04:50] and right objective hallelujah
[2:04:53] hallelujah and God is permitting it
[2:04:55] brother hallelujah what for God is not
[2:04:57] willing that any should
[2:05:00] perish see his attitude is right his
[2:05:02] spirit is right but he's not willing
[2:05:04] that any should perish so brother we're
[2:05:07] not willing that any should perish so we
[2:05:09] want to plead the token for family
[2:05:11] friends and
[2:05:12] neighbors oh yeah again be surprised who
[2:05:16] made it and who didn't make it keep your
[2:05:18] attitude right amen believe God I tell
[2:05:22] you anyone that don't make it it's just
[2:05:24] that their heart is against God Amen
[2:05:28] they're just going to be just totally
[2:05:30] don't not not into the truth I tell you
[2:05:32] if a person's heart is right and their
[2:05:34] attitude is right the spirit is right
[2:05:35] God's not going to kill kill them God's
[2:05:37] not going to send them away no God sees
[2:05:41] that God recognizes that he's not
[2:05:43] willing that any should perish so
[2:05:46] brother he'll honor that and and he and
[2:05:48] he allow them to come in oh yeah and he
[2:05:52] he'll give them a white
[2:05:54] robe the bride possesses a white
[2:05:58] robe yeah we got white robes from the
[2:06:01] inside out but they're going to be given
[2:06:03] white robes and that'll be that'll be
[2:06:05] the Judgment the prophet of God said
[2:06:08] that after the Great Tribulation there
[2:06:10] and after after the manal rain and he
[2:06:12] said he'll gather them all together and
[2:06:14] he said this one will come up and that
[2:06:16] one is gone to Hell CU why it's there
[2:06:18] spirit and their
[2:06:20] attitude yeah it's their spirit and
[2:06:22] their attitude in their
[2:06:25] hearts and there there are people that
[2:06:27] we meet sometimes and and sometimes we
[2:06:29] do know it sometime we don't know it and
[2:06:31] that is their spirit and their
[2:06:33] attitude and there are those they just
[2:06:35] don't have an attitude nothing they
[2:06:37] don't care about goodness or
[2:06:38] righteousness or anything like that
[2:06:40] nothing spiritual they're just caught up
[2:06:42] with the Natural Things of life and and
[2:06:45] and not not just in your heads but it's
[2:06:47] really a the spirit in their
[2:06:49] hearts if it's only in their heads God
[2:06:52] God knows what the heart is see God's
[2:06:55] looking at your heart
[2:06:56] yes your spirit your
[2:06:59] soul yeah and well of course he knows
[2:07:02] the bride is going to have a right
[2:07:03] attitude right spirit in in the heart
[2:07:05] and the soul and so on and and she just
[2:07:08] surrenders to the word but then there
[2:07:10] are others out there too they have a
[2:07:12] right attitude right Spirit oh yeah oh
[2:07:15] yeah so God God will honor them
[2:07:19] amen God knows God knows the heart God
[2:07:23] knows their thoughts God knows their
[2:07:25] motives and objectives he he sees their
[2:07:27] actions and their reactions amen but
[2:07:30] brother as the prophet of God said we
[2:07:32] can't get the truth he said to this
[2:07:34] message to everyone no he says this is
[2:07:37] only to the
[2:07:38] bride again trying to explain that to to
[2:07:41] Believers brother don't condemn those
[2:07:43] outside the
[2:07:44] message this is this is the calling of
[2:07:47] the Bride this is for the elect
[2:07:49] amen and brother it's not only the bride
[2:07:51] that's going to heaven the bride is
[2:07:53] going to be in the city but then there's
[2:07:55] going to be those outside the city amen
[2:07:57] there are those that are that are going
[2:07:59] to be witnessing the the the the the the
[2:08:01] union of the Bride the Heavenly brid and
[2:08:03] the Earthly bride they'll witness that
[2:08:06] amen but then they'll then they'll go
[2:08:08] back
[2:08:09] but after the great after the millennial
[2:08:12] Reign amen he's going to he's going to
[2:08:14] call them forth and give them white
[2:08:16] robes why because they respected him and
[2:08:19] they respected his bride he knows their
[2:08:22] heart oh yeah by the grace of
[2:08:25] God
[2:08:27] but just to remind you that the evil
[2:08:30] that we're dealing with come from
[2:08:33] eternity down through time but it goes
[2:08:37] back to Eternity but
[2:08:40] destroyed God created it God destroys it
[2:08:45] yeah oh what he's Eternal no no
[2:08:48] in the beginning God created the heavens
[2:08:50] and the Earth God created angels amen or
[2:08:54] they say was only this is going to die
[2:08:56] no even angels come under the Judgment
[2:08:59] of
[2:09:00] God and not only that they were put out
[2:09:02] of
[2:09:03] Eternity and really they they came down
[2:09:06] from heaven and they got subject to time
[2:09:10] and it's going to go a long time they
[2:09:12] been thousands of years oh yeah but
[2:09:15] they're going to
[2:09:16] die they're going to go into and they'll
[2:09:19] have their part or their time in the
[2:09:22] lake that burneth with fire and
[2:09:25] brimstone oh yes not not Eternal no no
[2:09:29] they'll have their
[2:09:30] time and and I thank our brother leil
[2:09:34] brought out some of those things
[2:09:35] concerning the original scripture he
[2:09:38] said people think he said they'll have
[2:09:40] their part in the Eternal fire and so on
[2:09:43] no he said they'll have their time in
[2:09:45] the lake that burth with fire and
[2:09:46] brimstone he how long it's going to be
[2:09:48] he said we don't know but he said he
[2:09:50] said after after a certain period of
[2:09:52] time he said they'll be gone they'll be
[2:09:54] totally G destroyed yeah and not only
[2:09:58] that then of course after the millennial
[2:10:00] Reign then God's going to give the the
[2:10:03] righteous of white robe and the others
[2:10:06] their heart was not right is there in I
[2:10:08] believe it Revelation 20 or 21 and he
[2:10:12] said you know cast him into the Lake of
[2:10:14] Fire oh yeah the others white Rob the
[2:10:18] other one Lake of Fire why God is
[2:10:22] looking at their hearts and their heart
[2:10:24] their spirit and their heart is not
[2:10:27] right God knows your
[2:10:29] spirit God knows your
[2:10:31] heart oh yeah and you get and and again
[2:10:35] unfortunately over the years I've met
[2:10:37] Believers their Spirit wasn't right and
[2:10:39] the No I said Lord their heart is not
[2:10:42] right because their attitude toward this
[2:10:44] one their attitude toward that one their
[2:10:46] attitude toward this that see oh my
[2:10:48] I'll tell
[2:10:50] you the the attribute of your spirit and
[2:10:52] your soul and your heart

[2:11:00] going around with the word the message
[2:11:02] and condemning everybody condemning this

[2:11:15] he said as long as the bride is here

[2:12:31] is there to help you you're there to
[2:12:33] help them amen grace of God be with
[2:12:38] us so brother identifying
[2:12:42] Satan where he come from he said thou
[2:12:45] has been in Eden the Garden of God every
[2:12:48] precious stone was thy covering and he
[2:12:51] highlights the
[2:12:53] stones and he said prepared in thee in
[2:12:56] the day that thou was created in verse
[2:12:58] 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[2:13:03] coverthe and the prophet is preaching on
[2:13:06] the anointed ones at the end
[2:13:08] time and brother Satan was an anointed
[2:13:12] cherb
[2:13:15] amen and I have set thee
[2:13:19] thou was upon the holy mountain of God
[2:13:22] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[2:13:24] of the stones of fire thou was perfect
[2:13:28] in thy ways from the day that thou was
[2:13:32] created he was perfect until iniquity
[2:13:35] was bound in him
[2:13:38] amen and by the multitude of thy mercies
[2:13:42] or merchandise thou have filled the
[2:13:45] midst of thee with violence they have
[2:13:47] filled fill the midst of thee with
[2:13:49] violence
[2:13:50] amen and thou has sinned therefore will
[2:13:54] I cast thee as profane out of the
[2:13:58] Mountain of God and I will destroy thee
[2:14:01] Oh covering
[2:14:03] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[2:14:06] fire thine heart was lifted up because
[2:14:11] of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy
[2:14:15] wisdom by reason of thy
[2:14:19] brightness I will cast thee to the
[2:14:21] ground I will lay thee before kings that
[2:14:24] they may behold thee amen Satan brother
[2:14:29] was lifted up with pride because of his
[2:14:32] Beauty amen and he became a seed of
[2:14:37] discrepancy in heaven and he was cast
[2:14:41] out and the angels with him amen and he
[2:14:44] became a seat of discrepancy in the
[2:14:46] Garden of Eden he became a seed of
[2:14:49] discrepancy all the way down through
[2:14:51] time even in this day in this hour
[2:14:54] wherein we are warned of false Christ
[2:14:57] and false prophets
[2:15:00] amen
[2:15:01] again Satan expressing the true
[2:15:04] anointing
[2:15:06] amen but a false
[2:15:09] teaching that's what he did in the
[2:15:11] Garden of Eden that's what he has done
[2:15:12] down through the down Through the Ages
[2:15:14] down through the prophets that's what he
[2:15:16] has done down through the church ages
[2:15:18] amen that he had amen that he had a true
[2:15:21] anointing but then there was a spirit in
[2:15:23] the church ages amen adding to what God
[2:15:27] had revealed taking away from what God
[2:15:29] had revealed making a denomination out
[2:15:32] of what God had done amen and again I
[2:15:37] don't have the time to get into the Book
[2:15:38] of Revelation Chapter 2 2 and three
[2:15:40] there showing you the spirit of the
[2:15:43] enemy Amen brother all my talk with the
[2:15:47] Church ages and brother than the church
[2:15:50] ages it was God oh yeah God was there
[2:15:53] that's the weight but then it was
[2:15:55] Satan's influence and that's what they
[2:15:58] put the black there for and we know that
[2:16:00] when the prophet of God was preaching
[2:16:02] this that the pillar of fire came into
[2:16:05] Brenham Tabernacle and it went over on
[2:16:08] the side of the church amen and it this
[2:16:11] is what it drew
[2:16:13] out oh yeah it what yeah the pillar of
[2:16:16] fire came in and Drew it out on the wall
[2:16:18] there and and the those that were there
[2:16:22] they could they could see it yeah but
[2:16:24] the prophet of God said notice this he
[2:16:27] said that one was absolutely black but
[2:16:31] he said I he said I put that little bit
[2:16:34] of weight there to represent the bride
[2:16:36] the bride age yeah he amen praise the
[2:16:40] Lord why because he said when the angel
[2:16:43] when the pillar of fire drew it he said
[2:16:45] it was total
[2:16:46] darkness be on our
[2:16:49] guard because we're going to be here
[2:16:52] until everything goes into total
[2:16:54] darkness we're going to be here until
[2:16:57] every most everybody on the Earth is
[2:17:00] going to go into the letter of the word
[2:17:01] but not the
[2:17:03] spirit there's going to be fewer and
[2:17:05] fewer and fewer that will have the Holy
[2:17:09] Ghost they'll have the letter of the
[2:17:11] message they'll be in the message but
[2:17:14] the message is not in them again this is
[2:17:16] what the prophet brings out in the
[2:17:19] anointed ones at the end time they're in
[2:17:21] the message they're experiencing the
[2:17:23] anointing but the teaching is
[2:17:26] false amen they got the anointing
[2:17:29] outward but not in the soul because that
[2:17:32] stays with the word and
[2:17:36] again
[2:17:37] brother as as somebody said if God told
[2:17:40] you to pick out the
[2:17:43] bride in this age he said what would you
[2:17:46] do he said I wouldn't want to do it it
[2:17:48] he said I might find a dozen
[2:17:51] what yeah I might find a dozen and again
[2:17:55] you go to that message how can I
[2:17:59] overcome and I believe I told you just
[2:18:01] second just the second page but no it's
[2:18:04] not the second page I think it's page 31
[2:18:06] in the book and you just see what the
[2:18:09] prophets got to say there concerning
[2:18:13] Believers and what what they're doing
[2:18:16] and what and the Temptation that that
[2:18:17] that they are subject to the Temptation
[2:18:21] Of The Devil in these last days that's
[2:18:23] influencing them if the problem of God
[2:18:26] saw it about 50 years ago what would he
[2:18:28] see
[2:18:29] today exactly brother it'd be a lot
[2:18:34] worse yeah that's like he said if God
[2:18:37] asked me to pick out the bride and he
[2:18:40] said I doubt if I if I'll find a dozen
[2:18:43] what a dozen yeah and another time he
[2:18:47] said
[2:18:51] well
[2:18:52] yeah all due respect he said there might
[2:18:55] be a dozen he Out of
[2:18:58] Africa yeah maybe brother Joshua was
[2:19:01] numbered with them and that's why the
[2:19:03] Lord brought him here amen so he said it
[2:19:07] might be a dozen Out of Africa but if
[2:19:09] there's only a dozen Out of Africa there
[2:19:11] there's less out of
[2:19:13] Canada there's less out of
[2:19:16] America Grace of God be with us brother
[2:19:19] and help
[2:19:21] us it is serious so I pray Grace brother
[2:19:26] that we'll not ignore the
[2:19:29] Revelation that what we're experiencing
[2:19:32] began in heaven and brother it's all the
[2:19:34] way down through
[2:19:35] time yes at the gate that's leading us
[2:19:39] back into Glory the grace of God be with
[2:19:44] us amen bear with me and I'll finish
[2:19:51] my let's
[2:19:54] see I've read this before
[2:19:58] but as Peter said we're forgetful
[2:20:01] ears so God help us bring it to our
[2:20:06] remembrance and he read the scripture of
[2:20:08] Matthew chapter 24 and he said listen
[2:20:11] close while I reread this again oh never
[2:20:17] notice that he re he reread it no I'm
[2:20:20] going to reread it
[2:20:22] amen this again like I said this was in
[2:20:25] 1965 he said listen close he said while
[2:20:29] I reread this
[2:20:31] again
[2:20:34] yeah he
[2:20:37] said there shall arise false
[2:20:42] Christ and false
[2:20:45] prophets and shall show great signs and
[2:20:51] wonders brother we're going to be
[2:20:53] impressed by the
[2:20:54] word we thank God for the signs and
[2:20:57] wonders but what about the word that
[2:20:59] follows
[2:21:00] it amen in so much that if it were
[2:21:05] possible they shall deceive the very
[2:21:10] elect now he said for a subject this
[2:21:14] morning I want to take the anointed ones
[2:21:17] at the end
[2:21:20] time and he said I believe that we are
[2:21:23] living in the end time and I think most
[2:21:27] anyone the scripture reader even a
[2:21:30] believer knows that we are now at the
[2:21:33] end of the history of the
[2:21:37] world well over 50 years ago yeah but
[2:21:41] that's nothing in the eyes of God if a
[2:21:44] year is a thousand or one or a day is a
[2:21:47] thousand years and so
[2:21:50] on with the Lord so we're at the end of
[2:21:54] the history of the world I believe we're
[2:21:55] at the end and you and I have been
[2:21:58] experiencing
[2:21:59] it
[2:22:01] yeah there will be no use of writing it
[2:22:06] because there won't be anybody to read
[2:22:08] it it's at the end of the time yeah and
[2:22:13] everything is getting
[2:22:16] so lack of spiritual or
[2:22:21] spirituality there's a little bit of
[2:22:23] religion but not
[2:22:25] much I think brother Mark brought out
[2:22:27] something about people don't know what
[2:22:29] Christian is or Christianity and so on
[2:22:32] yeah it's getting worse and worse and
[2:22:35] worse
[2:22:38] yeah that when he
[2:22:40] comes he won't find Christians
[2:22:45] Christlike the church like some of them
[2:22:48] and that's getting less and less and
[2:22:50] less oh yeah God help
[2:22:54] us to be Christlike are you Christlike
[2:22:58] in your home are you Christlike in your
[2:23:01] job or in your
[2:23:03] school
[2:23:06] yeah by the grace of
[2:23:08] God please that you reflect Jesus
[2:23:13] amen yeah it's not not necessarily being
[2:23:16] religious
[2:23:17] I remember one time that in the school I
[2:23:20] went to was religious
[2:23:22] school church
[2:23:25] school and I was late for the Bible
[2:23:28] class the religious religion
[2:23:32] class that's when the teacher there
[2:23:34] would teach you certain things from the
[2:23:37] Bible and I was late getting there and I
[2:23:41] walked in and sat
[2:23:43] down and the teacher and he's he's still
[2:23:45] alive today he I said he'd be in his
[2:23:48] 90s and uh and he said Mr
[2:23:52] Lush he said uh do you know he said that
[2:23:56] you'll be late for the
[2:23:58] Judgment because I was late for the
[2:24:01] class and everybody laughed and I said I
[2:24:04] hope
[2:24:05] so he said okay and then he read a
[2:24:10] scripture
[2:24:11] amazing and he asked a
[2:24:14] question he said what Church age are we
[2:24:19] living
[2:24:20] in I was
[2:24:22] surprised what but I wouldn't answer
[2:24:26] first and he said well nobody answered
[2:24:30] and he said raise your hand if you know
[2:24:33] so he answer he asked the question again
[2:24:36] two or three times and he said what
[2:24:38] church age are we in does anybody know
[2:24:41] so I was waiting for somebody else to
[2:24:42] answer to finally I rais my
[2:24:45] hand okay he said said Mr L she said
[2:24:47] what church age are we in I said I
[2:24:50] believe I said that we are in the
[2:24:52] loudest in church
[2:24:54] age yes he said you're right he said
[2:24:58] you're absolutely right he said let me
[2:25:01] read it and he read Revelation
[2:25:04] 3 yeah even they knew that back there
[2:25:08] amen so we'll give the glory to God oh
[2:25:12] yeah and again they they recognize me as
[2:25:16] being a
[2:25:18] Christian but not a
[2:25:22] denomination they knew that and not only
[2:25:24] that the teacher that same teacher felt
[2:25:27] that brother jural Lush was going to be
[2:25:30] a
[2:25:32] judge yeah he said cuz he asked a Bible
[2:25:36] question again in another class and he
[2:25:39] asked this one to answer what's your
[2:25:41] answer what's your answer what's your
[2:25:43] and several gave answers Some Gave no
[2:25:45] answers till he came to me Mr Lush
[2:25:50] what's your
[2:25:51] answer and I gave the
[2:25:55] answer just very brief and he said oh Mr
[2:26:00] Lush he said do you know he said you are
[2:26:03] going to be a
[2:26:05] judge I said I don't know but I
[2:26:09] am yeah because God is judging us by his
[2:26:14] word yeah that's going over the
[2:26:18] pulpit
[2:26:20] exactly why he judging your faith
[2:26:23] judging your nature your character is it
[2:26:25] in your heart or in your head that's
[2:26:28] what God's looking
[2:26:29] for
[2:26:34] amen you see we at the end of the
[2:26:36] history of the
[2:26:38] world and just when I do not know he
[2:26:41] should just how long it will be not even
[2:26:42] the angels of heaven knows that minute
[2:26:45] or hour but we been told by the Lord
[2:26:49] Jesus that when these things that we see
[2:26:52] now begin to come to pass then to lift
[2:26:54] up our heads for Redemption is drawing
[2:26:58] nigh now he said what drawing nigh means
[2:27:01] I do not know but it's drawing nigh and
[2:27:05] he said it's cracked all the way around
[2:27:08] concerning California and the prophecy
[2:27:11] that he made concerning
[2:27:12] California and he says cracked all the
[2:27:15] way around but he didn't know exactly
[2:27:17] when it was going to go under but we
[2:27:19] know the California is going down
[2:27:23] now because as I said before there are
[2:27:26] many in California that are putting up
[2:27:28] brick walls behind their houses because
[2:27:31] the water is rising and the water is not
[2:27:33] necessarily Rising it's California
[2:27:35] sinking yeah so the grace of
[2:27:39] God I pray that every elected
[2:27:42] predestinated seed will flee amen amen
[2:27:49] just bear with
[2:27:52] me he
[2:27:54] said there's an accumulation of evidence
[2:27:58] that the hour that we now live in I
[2:28:01] think it's good thing to rehearse these
[2:28:03] things and to draw them out since the
[2:28:05] seals has been open and find out the
[2:28:09] truth of these things as God has been so
[2:28:11] loyal to us with his grace to show us
[2:28:15] these things thank God for Grace you're
[2:28:16] still getting the word it's the grace of
[2:28:19] God to
[2:28:21] us I want you to notice here in Matthew
[2:28:24] 24 Jesus used the term
[2:28:27] Christ not Christ but plural
[2:28:32] Christ and he said therefore the word me
[2:28:35] Christ means the anointed
[2:28:37] one and he said if the anointed one
[2:28:39] there will be not only one but many
[2:28:43] anointed ones it's not a false Christ
[2:28:46] but a false false false Christ
[2:28:50] plural and there shall arise false
[2:28:52] anointed ones in the last days that
[2:28:55] seems almost impossible the terms
[2:28:58] anointed but notice the very next words
[2:29:01] and false prophets
[2:29:04] plural and the anointed one is one with
[2:29:07] a message and the only way the message
[2:29:10] can be brought out he said is by one
[2:29:12] that's anointed and he said that would
[2:29:15] be a prophet anointed but there shall
[2:29:18] arise false anointed
[2:29:20] teachers a prophet teaches what his
[2:29:23] message
[2:29:25] is he said anointed teachers but
[2:29:28] anointed people with false
[2:29:32] teaching he said anointed ones
[2:29:36] plural and he said it's a Sunday school
[2:29:39] lesson he said we want to try he said to
[2:29:41] bring this to a real Showdown by the
[2:29:44] scriptures not by what someone one else
[2:29:47] has said about it but just reading the
[2:29:49] scriptures you may say how can this be
[2:29:53] what were they Christ plural anointed
[2:29:56] Christ false prophets anointed ones but
[2:30:00] false prophets and Jesus said that the
[2:30:03] rain falls on the just and the
[2:30:06] unjust do you believe that the anointing
[2:30:09] on those people means that it's the
[2:30:11] anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir he
[2:30:15] said the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon
[2:30:17] a person yet they are false yet they
[2:30:21] have a true
[2:30:22] anointing yeah but it's not in their
[2:30:25] hearts it's not in their soul they're
[2:30:27] experiencing the anointing and there's
[2:30:29] many a Believer experiences the
[2:30:30] anointing of the revealed word but it's
[2:30:32] not in their
[2:30:33] souls yeah they can line up
[2:30:36] intellectually but again eventually
[2:30:38] compromise a little here compromise a
[2:30:40] little there and still Proclaim they
[2:30:42] believe the message and again and now
[2:30:45] can I overcome page 31 the prophet is
[2:30:47] bringing out that spirit that he was
[2:30:49] dealing with in his own
[2:30:51] church oh yeah they were believing the
[2:30:53] message but now there was a spirit among
[2:30:56] them to
[2:30:58] compromise yeah and he said I'm going to
[2:31:01] preach it to you stop doing
[2:31:04] it amen well brother if if that was so
[2:31:08] then he would if he was still here today
[2:31:10] he'd be still preaching
[2:31:11] it but he'd be over 100 years
[2:31:14] old yeah God help
[2:31:19] us Isa the anointing one Isa that means
[2:31:22] the people means that it's anointing of
[2:31:23] the Holy Spirit yes sir it is the
[2:31:26] genuine holy spirit of God upon a person
[2:31:28] and yet they are false now listen close
[2:31:31] and see what he said and they shall show
[2:31:34] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[2:31:36] were possible they would deceive the
[2:31:38] very elected and he said they are
[2:31:41] anointed with this genuine Holy Spirit I
[2:31:44] know that sounds very foolish but we're
[2:31:47] going to take time and explain it by the
[2:31:49] word of God that it is absolutely thus
[2:31:52] sayeth the Lord the truth amen and the
[2:31:55] Lord willing we'll get more and more
[2:31:57] into
[2:31:58] it maybe the next service we'll see what
[2:32:01] the Lord will do but again he sends his
[2:32:04] Reign on the just and the unjust and he
[2:32:06] makes his son to rise on the evil and on
[2:32:10] the good God help us let's make sure
[2:32:14] that we're in the truth in our heart
[2:32:16] hearts in our souls not intellectually
[2:32:19] in our heads where we're going to
[2:32:21] compromise a little here and compromise
[2:32:23] a little there we'll add a word take
[2:32:24] away a word well I believe it means this
[2:32:26] I believe it means that it means it the
[2:32:28] way God said it yeah don't add to it
[2:32:31] don't take from it and brother let's pay
[2:32:34] attention to the leadership of the Holy
[2:32:36] Ghost by the grace of God Amen God help
[2:32:41] us in this
[2:32:43] hour of anointed ones at the end time
[2:32:47] that we'll stay with the true anointing
[2:32:49] the true teaching not a false teaching
[2:32:53] amen it's not what we feel it's what's
[2:32:57] revealed and where it's revealed in our
[2:33:00] hearts grace of God be with us Lord
