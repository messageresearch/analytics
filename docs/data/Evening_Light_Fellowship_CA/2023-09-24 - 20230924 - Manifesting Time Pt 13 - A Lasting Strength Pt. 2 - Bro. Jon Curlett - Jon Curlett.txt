bless us now each one we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you amen wonderful song service this morning and then certainly appreciate that brother Josh and just trusting the leading it's a perfect setup for where we are this morning certainly in the service and very thankful for that it also always helps the ministry men when the song search just seems to be right right where it needs to be that said I think we should sing Our God is tremendous every single service amen what a wonderful song Amen that's a bride song I do believe amen excited for the word this morning been studying hard and just feel like the Lord has brought us right to this place right on time so let's read if we would second Peter 1 5 as we started this with the same same scripture from last service amen second Peter 1 5. Peter would say this he says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue amen God bless you can have your seats this morning may God bless the reading of his word and we're continuing our series on manifesting time we're on part 13 and we're going to take a second service and as far as I know this will be the last one but we want to speak on a lasting strength and we're going to be speaking on virtue this morning and I want to do a quick recap I know a number of us weren't here on on Wednesday and and if you didn't hear it and if you weren't able to stream that I definitely recommend you go back and do it because we're building and if you miss a step then you usually miss something critical and you know as we go through this we'll see that there's no jumping to the good things of God God doesn't just take us from from nothing to something he doesn't just take us from a nothing into the positions of Authority or power or recognition or any of these things but God builds us up bit by bit and if we try and jump then what happens is we fall because our character and our development doesn't match where we are and so we've got to go through this process God has a way of doing things to to create a bride and draw a bride out and and make her into what he wants her to be amen but we saw this this word Virtue with last service and and it that Peter uses and it was that that Greek word erity and it means moral goodness or Excellence of good moral character uprightness and the examples they had there were modesty and Purity and we we saw that this word virtues only used five times there's another word Virtue that's used almost exclusively through the scripture but this one is only used five times and Peter uses it the most and we spent the majority of our service last last uh last Wednesday on this scripture in First Peter 2 9 that says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises that word praise there is virtue that you should show forth the virtue of him who hath called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light and we spent literally an entire service last time talking about what what kind of life this sort of virtue looks like this Heritage virtue and it's a it's a life that's reflect or a virtue that's reflected in our day-to-day walk amen it's a life that that shows that we're separated out to God and it's chosen our worship and it shows in our clothes and it shows in our conversation in our words and our worship and all of these things and even our approach to God is defined by this sort of virtue amen why because we're being built up to be a temple fit for the dwelling place of God and God expects us to live by the word that he's given us God expects obedience out of his children that's the the nature of a child that's going to be adopted is first of all that they are obedient and if you can't be a b you can't be adopted and many of you can't be obedient then you can't be placed in the position of responsibility because you're just like a shotgun you might go anywhere amen he's looking for somebody that'll hit the mark every single time but we see that this is a this virtue that we're talking about here is a separated life It's A Life That's dedicated to the word of God and it means that we live our lives according to the word of God now Peter would say you have to add to your faith virtue and we spend some time with Abraham last service and we showed that that virtue separated him from unbelief so obedience will separate you from unbelief because obedience will bring you into faith and then Faith brings you into virtue but what it did with Abraham was it put him in a place where God could reveal himself in a greater way because God revealed himself to Abraham as a I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and it was this great God above him that was revealing it but we see now as we're going to go in through this service that God is going to reveal himself in a different way to Abraham and he's going to reveal himself in two completely different ways as Abraham comes into more and more obedience as Abraham does What God Says then God shows the next step so often that's the problem with us is we're trying to see three steps ahead and God's saying just Do the step I've showed you follow in my Wills following my words should do what I've showed you to do and when you get there you'll get the next bit there's been things that I've been studying and I was trying and I'm looking ahead and I'm saying how do I get there and God's saying just preach what I put in front of you and as soon as I preach that then the door opens to the next one and the next one and the next one and you start to see things in a greater way I've got to have faith for this step and when I get to the next step then he gives me the next one and the next one and the next one the light is only promised as we walk with him in the light amen I can't say where we going God I've just got to say God where are you and stay with him and the light will reveal where I need to be and what I'm supposed to do as it comes this way amen but as I said last service and brother Bob told me he listened to this just finished listening to the Statue of a perfect man you'll know that what I preached last service brother Branham literally gives one line to that and I'm going to read the quote for it but brother bran jumps immediately to a different type of virtue and says this is what we're talking about but brother Brandon has preached on the other sort of virtue all through the message it's not that he just didn't touch on in Statue of a perfect man but he jumps to it and we're going to talk about that this morning we're going to talk about this virtue this Apex virtue if I would call it it's the fullness of virtue I think it would be the way to put it and the brother man would say this he says first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith he says this is the next column first pour your foundation Faith then to your faith at virtue now listen to this he says now right there knocks a lot of us down when a prophet of God says that I listen it means that there's a pro there's a potential problem here there's something that causes issues in the Christian walk he says yes sir add virtue to your faith now that doesn't just mean living a virgin life you know like the woman or a man and so forth that's what we spent all our service on program says it doesn't this virtue doesn't mean just doing that but it's a part of it so you can't skip it but he says that's not the B al-nendable that's not the fullness of virtue and he says that doesn't have nothing to do with that he says this virtue we're getting to this there's more to it than all of this he's not dismissing it but he's saying that's not where virtue ends he says the Bible said we read over here in the Book of Luke Luke where it said virtue went out of him he says that right he says if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like it so if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue but look look at what this virtue looks like he says I've got to have virtue and a pass in other words a means of accessing it or transmitting it or sharing it I've gotta have a pass that it can pass forward from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people he says virtue and listen to this before you can let it out you've got to have it first before you can let it out you've got to have it first if you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out we spoke last service about that virtue and how we get it but that was a ver that was a the virtue of clean living and we said that was a conscious Choice Abraham chose to obey the word of God you've got to make a decision that start a virtue starts up here and that's the greatest battle ever fought is you decide to obey the word of God it has to start in the mind and then that changes your attitude it changes your words it changes your confession and all of these things and Abraham consciously chose to separate himself and live according to the word of God but that just set him up for the next stage of God revealing himself to him amen now remember what Jesus said in John he said Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words period well colon but you understand what I'm saying you've got to obey you can't disobey God and say you love him and you can't move into the greater things of God and being disobedient to God's word you can't do it right he says and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our bowl with him now you can tie that right back to the late Asian Church age this scripture in John 14. you can tie that promise right back into that because those that hear the word of it of God are accepting Christ the word himself you accept the word you accept the person of the word and that person of the word comes into our lives amen and we've got to accept him as he reveals himself Noah had a revealing of God Moses had a revealing of God Daniel had a revealing of God David had a revealing of God Samuel had a revealing to God we've got a revealing of God as well and we've got to accept him as he reveals himself and not stay in the glare of another ages brother Brandon would say you can't throw that away you've got to take it but you've got to keep moving as God does Amen so each one of us has a word for our day and in Revelation 3 we have a word for our day when he speaks to the laodicean church and at the end of that he says this behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door you've got to hear the voice and you've got to open the door amen how do you do that you obey the word I was talking with with somebody this week and I said you notice here that it says if any he says I'm knocking but the knock that you hear is a voice he never says I'm calling but the knocking on your heart is a voice and what is it it's the messenger for that age that's bringing what the spirit says unto the churches so when that spirit's Knocking On Your Heart by a seven Church age messenger you open it and then who comes through the door not the messenger the one that sent the message because he says what I will come into him so he's going to come into our house he's going to come into our life he's going to come into our situations and he's going to have a meal with us but then he says and I will sup with him I will come into him and sup with him but then he says and he with me that's a separate thing that's a resurrection that's a Rapture that's a marriage supper he says you let me in to your life and I'll deal with your life I'll bring you to a place I'll feed you but then I'm going to take you to a different meal and that's one that's reserved only for the bride of Christ why because you heard the word for your day and you accepted it and you accepted Christ the word into your life he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne how do you overcome in this age you recognize the message for your day and you act on it it's that simple it's always been that way that's it was the way it was in Noah's day it was a way it wasn't no Moses say it's the same thing in our day we recognize our day and its message and we receive it and that is Christ the word revealing himself to us that's what we have to do but it's continually unfolding that's the thing we have to realize is it's continually unfolding because he's unfolding us to bring us to a greater and greater place in him he's drawing us up into a higher place than him that says he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith under the churches the spirit spoke expressly through those Church age Messengers it's the only place of Refuge that we have is within that message that he's he brought us amen but we're talking about a higher virtue a higher level of virtue here and you'll notice the prophet says you can't give it if you don't get it so this is something you have to take in before you can give it up because we we can get to this place where we're thinking well I've got to have virtue and we think we've got to produce it no you've got to get it to give it it's not something you produce it's something you get it's something that's given it's something that's put into you that you take a hold of and then from there God can use you because the goal of God is to get us to the place where he's not working on us but he's working through US amen so he's trying to do things with our life and this is what the statue of a perfect man is he's trying to get you straightened out he's trying to get you strengthened up he's trying to get you built up so that you're in a place where now all he's got to do is hone you a little bit he stopped chiseling you he stopped hammering on you he stopped doing the heavy work all that's done and now all he's doing is trying to fit you into the body and now he can work through you and give something to those that are around you so you can edify them and help them come into the body of Christ as well amen honing brother Matt knows this when you're honing you're just taking the lightest of things off you're in a near perfect condition and all there is is just little tiny spots and you don't use a lot of pressure for honing you don't use really abrasive anything it's really fine really smooth and it's just really nice doesn't hurt doesn't do anything and it just takes off the tiniest little micro micro bumps if you could call it that that's what honing does but there's a difference in this virtue that we're talking about and brother Brown would say the virtue that we're talking about is the virtue that came out of Jesus and I want us to go back there this morning so we can see this this morning it says in a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which has spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment brother Brannon would say she used him she initiated contact he didn't initiate contact he just was present it was up to her to make the touch it was up to him to be there so she initiated the contact and brother Byron would say well we'll see as we get into this she he didn't use his gift he had a gift he had power he had Authority he had all of these things he didn't use his gift but rather she drew it out of him and he'd know it'd cause him to notice something it says and immediately her issue of blood was done she was healed immediately as soon as she touched him and Jesus said who touched me and when all denied Peter and them that were with him said Master the multitude thronged the impressedly and say so who touched me they said Jesus everyone's touching you goes to show it matters how you touch him matters your approach it matters what's in your heart and Jesus said but somebody had touched me for I perceived that virtue has gone out of me so everybody's touching them but then one person touches him in a particular way and Jesus got weak we saw that in the ministry of a prophet when that strength went out of him when he was under that anointing when the people were drawing it out of him then he would get progressively weaker and weaker until they had to just drag him out of the meeting right so we're seeing that this virtue is not just a virtue to get but it's a virtue to give but you look at this woman and this is this virtue that she received this is not that irritated virtue this is not the the moral living that we are talking about this but this this virtue is called dunamis and it means power strength ability Mighty work Miracle moral power and Excellence of Soul remember it's not just living a virgin clean life but it's part of it power and resources arising from large numbers and power resting in armies or forces this is what we're supposed to have let me ask you a question did that woman get virtue or did she have virtue to get her healing she had to get virtue she had to go to the one that had the mighty Force the power the strength the miracle working power the ability the power resting in an army she had to go to get it before she could get the results of it amen so I want you to to step back because we see this story a couple times in the gospels and I want to look at the starting point for this virtue because when we go to Matthew 9 this is the starting point for her virtue remember Peter said add to your faith virtue look at what she did she it says for she said within herself if I may but touch His Garment I shall be whole so here's her faith being expressed she says within herself if I can touch him I know that I'll be healed if I can get through to him then I'm going to be healed and listen she fought her way to get to him she had to fight the crowd to get to Christ he was on his way to Jairus he had a mission he had a plan he had a purpose he was just going and the people thronged him they surrounded him and everybody was touching and calling out to him so she has to fight everybody else that's trying to get a hold of him but the difference is is she's not just coming there for his celebrity but she's coming there because she knows who she is and she knows that if she can touch him she'll get something from him and it's a virtue that'll change her body that'll change her life amen but she persevered until she could touch him and all she got was the Hem of His garments Church how do you Touch the Hem of a man's garment did she reach up touch him up here she struggled so hard to all she could do was this she humbled herself she got knocked down perhaps she struggled and stroven in the end the only way she could get him was to go underneath but yet she persevered because her faith said if I can but touch him then I'll be healed amen it says but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made the whole and the woman was made whole from that hour so now we see this cycle start to build up that faith is the starting point where Peter said add to your faith virtue and then we get to the place and we think well I'm just having to produce it no you've got to go find the source of virtue before you can deliver it before you come can give it out to somebody else you have to get it and what we see here is a fountain being poured in so that a fountain can be poured out something's pouring into your life so that you can pour it into somebody else's life but if nothing's pouring in then guess what you can tilt the cup all day long nothing will come out you've got to be continuously pouring in you've got to get to that Source amen and brother Brian would say here's where a lot of us get knocked down what we don't get poured into so that we can pour out of we're going to talk about this in in quite some depth this morning amen simple fact is you can't pay a a bill from an empty bank account you can pretend all day long you can say all day long you can have faith all day long but if the money ain't there the bill ain't getting paid and all you do is you rack up what penalties somebody pays a price amen but this former Woman by faith she laid hold of the person of virtue it's a person amen it's a reality it's a manifested one amen and he had the power and he had the strength and he had the miracle working power and when she touched him then she received the virtue that she have needed for her for her body to change him and it healed her of her condition it changed her body it brought her body subject to her faith a man had brought her body subject to her faith and now she had a testimony now she had something to share now she had a witness that she could give of what it meant to touch Jesus amen but the question is how do we get it how do we get this great virtue we've talked about the the moral aspects and The Obedience and the conscious decision we make for that virtue but there's a way that we can get it and brother Branham talks about it and you look at it when he talks about virtue in the Statue of perfect man he gives us like four or five paragraphs and that's it he spends almost no time on this but here's what he did say he said in the spiritual man okay so this is a spiritual aspect a spiritual man growing need something to eat on that's the word of God I believe every word of it God has a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people coming down he's repeating the words of the song with his matahida's feet he supplies her every needle it's sweet to sup with Jesus all the time that's right yes sir he's got it the church has it the Church of the Living God that's built up into this perfect man of the knowledge of Christ now you must have virtue I said then the first thing you know there's somebody loves to smell the odor that's a weird thing to say and stick with me as he explains it he says he isn't selfish he's got older this is good odor not bad odor this isn't stinky sweat but this is a sweet smelling fragrance before he can give out odor he has to have it before he can give out honey he has to have it before he can give out Beauty he has to have it what is it it's a royal priesthood offering acceptable sacrifices to God a sweet smelling Savor to him Paul was saying II Corinthians he says for we are unto God a sweet savior of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish in other words he says the things that come out of our life this virtue that comes out of our life is a sweet fragrance to those that are saved and to those that are perishing it's discernible discernible by all anyone shot to be able to come into our life and perceive that there's something that they can get from us amen but the prophet would say a spiritual man growing needs something to eat on so in other words he needs to get his vitamins and his nutrients and his minerals he needs something substantial not to maintain him where he is but to grow him every day we're supposed to be growing in Christ you know you get to to a place in in health and and these different things and and we call it maintaining and all you're trying to do is maintain your your muscles maintain your weight maintain your figure you're not trying to get bigger you're not trying to get smaller you're not trying to get small you know stronger you're just trying to hold what you have that is never the place for a Christian we are always pushing growing striving pressing maturing always it never stops it never stops amen but the growing Son of God can't just eat something to hold him where he's at but he's got to take something that's good for the journey remember when Elijah is about to go on the journey and the angel comes and he makes a meal for him and Elijah eats all he wants and the angel says no keep eating because you got a long journey ahead so keep eating and keep eating and keep eating because you're not going to get food for a long time when we've got time to eat we've got to eat because when we need the energy that's not the time to be eating that's the time to have the energy in you already it's time to have the virtue inside of you already but let's go to Sarah here in Hebrews 11 it says through faith also Sarah herself received strength that word is virtue and it's the same word dunamis as The Virtue that went out of Christ so Sarah got us say the hold of the same virtue that that woman with the blood issue did it's the exact same power it says she receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful add to your faith virtue she judged him faithful who had promised she wasn't looking at her strength she was looking at the strength of him who had made the promise and she found strength from him to produce the word in her life therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as dead as many as the stars of the sky was in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable but I want to say you know Hebrews 11 gives us two verses but I want you to go back and I want us to go back this morning to see how God does these things because we're going to see a great revealing a progressive revelation of God and his work in a child of God to bring them to the place to produce the word we see all these types and shadows as we go through the Old Testament it's why they're there for our ammunition so we can recognize the pattern of God Genesis 17 says this and when Abraham Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord now in English we just have this word Lord and we say Well it means the same thing time and time again but it doesn't in the scriptures that word Lord has so many different aspects to it and the word Lord here means or or in this one the the word Lord is actually El Shaddai it says and and it says when Abram was 19 years old and nine El Shaddai appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect Now That Word Perfect means whole complete entire and sound so God's telling Abraham to live the way I told you to live and produce the word that I told you to produce that's a burden that's a burden for her for Abram because he's sitting there he's 99 years old he's an old man his seat is dried up he can't do anything about it and God's saying fulfill the word Abram but I want you to see how God revealed himself to him he says I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly God's saying the time for the promises now you've been waiting for 24 years Now's the Time I gave the promise the present promise hasn't changed I haven't changed you've changed but I haven't changed the promise hasn't changed and now I've come down to tell you you're in the season of promise you're in the season of change you're in the season for the word to be manifested in your life the word is about to become flesh Abram and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but by thy name Shall be Called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee so catch us now God changes Abram's name to Abraham and it's a reflection of the word of God it's a reflection of the promise of God for him personally so Abraham's name now embodies the promise of God and he's got to wear that promise every day with the name he's identified as the promise of God Amen but it's before the promise has been manifested so again there's a bird in there there's a potential criticism there's a chance for people to laugh and make fun of him amen but the name change prepares the way for the body change the name change prepares the way for the word of God to come forth amen the name prepares the way for the word to be manifested the name changes the part is part of the expectation he says and I will make the exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of Thee now that's all for Abraham but watch what he says verse 7 I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their Generations so there's a similar Covenant there's a same Covenant for every single Seed of Abraham that comes behind him we preach the whole series remember on the Royal seed we're a part of this verse 7 is our covenant verse 7 is our identification with the Covenant of Abraham amen so every one of us has to realize our place and he says it's for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee church let me say this way you've got to see yourself in the Covenant you've got to see it as a personal Covenant to you that he is your healer he is your deliverer he is your provider he is your guide he is your Shepherd because if you can only see it in somebody else's life what is what good is it going to do for you but if you can put yourself in there and say he's mine he's my God he's my shepherd he's my deliverer he's my provider now he's got something to work with because you've placed yourself where you ought to be he's your strength and your shielding man God comes down with Abram and he gives him a name change that seems nonsensical it makes no sense it reminds me when the angel came to Mary how can these things be it doesn't make any sense and Abraham becomes the father of many nations in terms of his name and he's literally wearing the promise of God and nothing has changed nothing's changed same as he was before the conversation with god nothing has changed in Abraham he's still 99 years old he's still an old man he still can't father a child he's still wrinkled he's still tired nothing has changed except his name he's still got a hold on he's still got to have faith amen he can't do a thing and yet he's got a name change we face circumstances so many times and we can't change it and yet we look in the word and we've got a promise of a God that changes changes circumstances I mean that knocks down walls that opens doors that sets people free that saves that heals it delivers that protects that guides that provides and yet sometimes it seems we're holding on so long and then what happens he lets us know who we are changes it remember brother Brown would say he would say I no longer call you Church I call you bride because there's a difference between a church and a bride and you sit here and you say how can these things be Brother John what's the bride's name Mrs Jesus Christ how can it be Brother John the name change precedes the manifestation of the word he's got to let you know who you are so you know what's coming your way and so you can start looking for it you can start believing for it in a way knowing that you're in the season of becoming the very thing that he's named you that's why God sent us a prophet to let us know it's changing time it's manifesting time it's word producing time it's Resurrection time it's Rapture time it's going home time amen so get ready for it because your name's been changed that means the promise is coming right behind it listen our name declares what God is doing Hebrews 13 8 brother Brown would say time and time again my message is to declare him that he's here Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ that's our name our name is Jesus Christ the same the same yesterday today and forever what is it when your Christ when Christ is in you then the same nature the same attributes the same works are all supposed to flow through this body the exact same thing and you sit there and say brother John it's been so long it's been so long and we've seen it in part and yes we've been kept safe and yes we've been provided for and yes we've seen this and yes we've seen that and we praise the Lord for but where is the promise of his coming where is he be an expectation you've got the name change that means it's just right around the corner amen what is it it's a name that walks in the virtue of obedience on a foundation of Faith until it comes to the place where virtue becomes strength and power because the word is being produced through you on a foundation of Faith until the virtue comes now watch now Abraham has to Bear all this scrutiny and laughter and I'm sure as he's walking around people you know Christians we like to testify don't we I'm sure Abraham had testified and now he's saying by the way don't call me Abram call me Abraham and they're saying 99 Abraham Abraham walking around father of many nations call me now big laughingstock scripture says their face stag or not we ought to be able to testify in the face of our circumstances in the face of our own body in the face of our own health in the face of our own flaws and failures amen but look Abraham doesn't cower in a corner Abraham doesn't fight it he doesn't hide it but watch this progression because we're answering the question how do I get this kind of virtue he said we read where he said the lord El Shaddai appeared to him and brother Brian would say this he says now we find here he appears in the name of El Shaddai the almighty really the Hebrew word Shad means breast like a woman's breast and he appeared to him in the name of al-shaddai which is the plural breasted I am the breasted God Abraham 99 years old walk before me he says be perfect what does it mean to be perfect brother John believe my word and Just Keep On Believing I promise that 75 here it is been 24 years now since I made you the promise and what a comfort it ought to have been to an old man 99 years old and his strength all gone and God hear God stand before him and said I'm El Shaddai I'm the breasted God Amen he says draw your strength from me I am your strength he says like the all-new and Old Testament breast of God what is it you've got to pull from the whole word don't just pick the new and you can't stay in the old but pull it all together he says I am the breasted God draw your strength for me like a little baby when it's sick and fretting sick weak it leans upon its mother's breasts and nurses his strength back from the mother in other words Abram you're nothing but it's baby to me 99 years old he says it hasn't been no time his life you say brother John it's been so long since I actually believed since I laid hold of the promise since I claimed it since I stood on your word and you're speaking to God not to me and you're saying what's taking so long God why are you waiting it's like that to God and he says your faith will hold in the meantime because he won't test you more than you're able to bear their faith grew as time went on God help us that our faith will grow as time goes on rather than weaken as time would go on Amen you've got to get it before you give it is what he's saying amen here's what's happening God comes to Abram before the promise is going to be produced he changes his name and he's saying Abram now just to get you over the hump there's one more Hill there's one more climb you ever been hiking and you go over and you think this is it you get over the hill then it turns a corner and you realize you got one more Hill and you're like no no no no no no one more hump one more Hill one more trial one more period of waiting what you need just draw from me get close to me and you'll get the strength that you need scriptures will say lay hold of eternal life get a hold of God get in his presence and see what happens amen sometimes we act so grown up church but the simple fact is when we're out of strength we're out of strength when you're done you're done when you're out you're out when you're finished you're finished and you have to be mature enough mature enough to say God I'm done not I'm done walking I'm done believing I'm done obeying no God I've got nothing left and so I need you to fill me up fill my cup Lord to go back and say I've run out listen our faith declares we haven't run out of faith but we've run out of strength to keep acting on that Faith the belief doesn't change but the strength to keep going amen remember you're a spiritual person brother Brown said growing and so you need to get it before you can give it brother I'm gonna put it this way he says he is still El Shaddai he's still the breast of God knew an Old Testament just draw your strength from it oh everything you have need of the baby he is helpless he has to pull his strength from his mother that's the only way he can get his strength he says that's the only way a Believer can get his strength is pull it from the word of God that's his strength is what God's promises to him stand by it he says and believe it and not only is the little baby here represented when it's sick it's fretting the mother can put it to her breast and he goes to nursing its strength back it's satisfied while it's nursing and that's the way with the real child of God no matter what the skeptic says what it believes if you truly believe it Jesus can't lie you're satisfied that it's revealed to you you've got the promise and nothing's going to stop it on this rock I build my church see it's spiritual the revealed word of Truth now you mothers know and your parents know that when a baby is hungry and you go to nurse it what does it do it latches and it just starts going because it's so hungry it's so eager for strength and it's just going and going and going and it's hilarious to watch usually the mom is trying to push it away but whoa slow down that hurts God doesn't tell you to slow down and you can't hurt him and you can't take it away from them you can't take it all you can it is an inexhaustible fountain amen but that baby you see him and and he just gets going and going and going and they just are sucking and sucking and sucking because they're so intent on getting what they need and they know that milk is what they need they're saying give it to me don't hold back don't meter the flow don't turn the valve down give me everything you got right if it's sick nursing settles it if it's tired nursing puts it to sleep if it's hungry nursing satisfies it just the simple Act of nursing being in the presence of the mother drawing strength and food from the mother amen you have to get your virtue from the same place you've got to go to the god that has the virtue there and it'll settle you and strengthen you listen have you ever seen a baby get settled by a quick drink it's got to fill its tummy when his tummy's full that's when he's satisfied and so often what we're doing is we're trying to grab a moment with God here and a moment with God there and a moment with God here and a moment with God there and we've got seven minutes throughout the day with God and we're thinking we can do it that's not sitting and nursing it's not sitting and drawing it's not getting in there and saying fill it up Lord you ever touch a baby's tummy when it's done drinking it's like a drum it's completely full it's protruding out it doesn't stop until it's full yet so often we're going for a sip here and a sip there and a sip here and a sip there he says no no you got to take time and set it aside to draw strength amen you've got to settle in and feed on the word of God you've got to settle in and get in the presence of God and let it do of work for you and give you strength to press through the day Jesus would talk about this Mark 6 he says in the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught in other words they said here's what we've been doing and he said unto them Come Ye yourselves apart into a desert place and do what rest a while he says for they were there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat they hadn't even had time to eat church sometimes as Believers were so busy doing the work of God we don't have time to feed on the word of God that can't be God's will to burn us out to stress us out to run us ragged to get us to the point where we get to the end of the day and we've lost our Christianity amen there's got to be a time and a place for this amen our life a Christian life is to give always this world is preaching self-love and it's satanic okay the world is saying you've got to show yourself love you've got to take care of yourself first you've got to do this and you've got to do that but they've turned it into a self-worship where you're of no good to anybody or 90 of your time is for yourself and 10 for everyone else that's never the ratio for a Christian but you do have to have self-care you've got to take care of yourself amen Jesus said it's okay to back away from your called Ministry and get a bite to eat go to kilmory for a while it's okay to go to kilmori listen the church can get by without a musician without a song leader without a preacher sometimes we can survive it and then every one of us has a Ministry husbands and fathers that's a Ministry wives mothers that's a Ministry song leaders deacons trustees it's a Ministry the ministers ourselves the preachers it's a Ministry Sunday school teachers all of us have these things and we can get ourselves till we're running ragged to fulfill it and nothing to fill it and what happens is we literally start to get so tired out that we start to resent the ministry that we're called to why because we're not filling in as much as we're pouring out what we have to realize is we have to be ministered to as much as we are ministerine because if we don't pour in we can't pour out so as much as is going out has to be filled up some other way and that means we've got to go back to Christ amen you know what there's a minister we've got a chat of ministers and there's a brother talking a while ago and he said Brothers he said you're working too hard because you think that being busy is what God's expecting God's not expecting us to be busy God's expecting us to be in his will we think well I'm a servant I'm a minister yes so you've got to be ready to serve when he tells you to serve but that doesn't mean you got to look busy or be busy all the time I'm saying this for myself as well as for everyone else you're allowed to lay it down sometimes to recharge you're allowed to lay it down so you can get filled up again amen we've got to be able to come come away a little bit and just draw some virtue back into our lives we've had how many ministers have we had in in the last two or three years with heart attacks and heart attacks and strokes and this and that and the other thing why because they're not taking care of themselves because they're so busy doing the work of God not realizing that if they die they can't do the work very well and if they're in a hospital bed they can't do it very well what they're starting to realize and that's what this this and this was a senior Minister saying this he's saying Brothers slow down stop take a break exercise Eat Right spend some time with your family do some things you enjoy rather than just work work work work work because it's a grind everything's a grind mothers It's a Grind I've said it over this public many times I don't want to be a mom because it always is ongoing you don't get a break but yet we have to take breaks and it's okay to get a Little Caesar's Pizza time and time again just to give yourself a break may not taste the best it may not be the most nutritious thing you can get but it can give you a break we set these expectations and there are expectations not the words expectations go with what the word says give yourself a break brothers and sisters give yourselves a break say he's not trying to kill us with service but he is trying to bring his word through us and so we've got to be able to draw virtue and strength amen we can guess what so tired and weary that we even start to question the very thing we believe we get jaded and if you're feeling jaded it means you haven't taken time aside to just get some strength to just get filled up again get your love tank filled if I could put it that way but it's a strength tank and it can only come with being in the presence of God listen to this he says while waiting there's a time of waiting resting in your faith that's what waiting looks like resting in your faith he says take God's promise that's the virtue he says I believe you Lord you promised to give me the baptism of the spirit I'm resting in your in faith my faith that I have in you I'm drawing from my resource for my resource so you have to get it to give it you have to draw from one resource that's your resource to give which is your internal resource you draw from one to give out he says I'm drawing from my resource for my resource for my health from your resource the word The man shall not live by bread alone but out of the bosom of God shall he nurse his strength every word that comes out of the mouth of God shall he receive his strength as he comes from the mouth of God the word he says like Abraham Abraham was resting now he had lived with Sarah since she was a little girl it was his half-sister he was living with her and married her she was Barren she had no children but here she is now she's 89 years old he says but Abraham rest in the faith of my word I'll promise you I'll do it I am El Shaddai I am the breasted God for my children that believe if you don't want a nurse well then don't say no more about it you see he's saying don't blame me if you don't nurse I'm here I'm available so don't blame me if you don't have it because it's your choice not to nurse because I'm here to provide he says but if you are a child you are nursing you are resting he says every promise he says notice real Faith rests upon the solid rock of the promise of God's word it doesn't shift the real faith is anchored like in the North Star the North Star is a typos to every shipmaster the compass points him only to that North Star and God the word is every Christians nor star if you're lost and the Holy Spirit is what points you to it it won't point to nothing else all other isms and so forth and Christianity mixed up on it whatever it may be it's like the world shifting it changes those stars but it can't change the North Star neither can anyone change the word of God he says anchor to it stay with it what's he saying he's saying Christ the word is our source of strength it's a fountain of virtue a power of Might to produce the word of God it's a mighty Army it's a mighty Army but God puts a burden on Abraham by giving him a name that declares the promise and yet the promise hasn't been fulfilled and then God reveals himself as the breasted one what so that Abraham can rest and draw strength to move into the final stage the revealing of God reflects the need of Abraham you'll find that God comes to you in the way that you need him he didn't come to him as Elohim he came to him as El Shaddai because that's what he needed was strength to just get him through the next year he just had one more year left and then it was all going to be okay before the promised son arrived amen God knows how to work it out church God knows how to bring himself to you in the situations you're in in the time of life you're in where the struggles and trials are and he reveals himself to meet that need in Genesis 17 he gives the name change in the burden of the promise of be thou perfect we're supposed to be in the Statue of a perfect man we have the same burden but Genesis 17 when he does is a spiritual Revelation it's a spiritual conversation with god it's God above us God's just revealing himself as above it all amen but then we come to Genesis 18 and watch how God changes because it says here and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent or In the Heat of the day now this word Lord we just say well that's Lord no no no here in Genesis 17 it was El Shaddai it was it was the breast that one The Virtue giving the life-giving strength giving God it was a Heavenly visitation it was a Heavenly conversation but in Genesis 18 God Appears again and this time the word is Lord but it's Elohim it's Elohim and it's a physical visitation what is it God came from above us now it's God With Us and it's Elohim and Birdman would say this he says now we know we realize that in this he was called Elohim the word also in the translation here means Elohim and Elohim is the all-sufficient one he is El Shaddai Elohim the breast of God the all-sufficient one he needs nothing from nobody else he is your all-sufficiency so in person now he comes and he says I'm the one that's going to do this I'm the one that's going to produce it I am the person of the promise and I'm meeting with you personally to let you know now is the time of your word now is the time for the manifestation and I'm coming down in person to you I'm having a personal revealing to you a personal conversation with you he reveals himself as El Shaddai he manifests himself as Elohim the all-sufficient one what is it God With Us when God spoke as El Shaddai he was what recognizing Abraham's need for strength he recognizes Sarah's need for strength his reveal he met the need and who he was at the moment was exactly what they needed they've been waiting for so long they've been faithful they've lived the right life they'd separated themselves they'd obeyed his word but now they needed some strength to get over that last hump and then God comes now as the all-sufficient one he says he doesn't he needs nobody nothing from nobody else you can't add to this you can't produce it you can't do anything to make it happen he is coming to do it it's a one-way Road it's a one-sided Covenant it's a complete Covenant that you have nothing to do with except that you receive it all God was doing was keeping Abraham alive so that God could do the work that's what God's doing with us he's keeping us alive so he can do the work until he can get us to the place where we're supposed to be God was letting Abraham no I got this I started it with a promise then I confirmed it with a covenant and now I'm here in person to let you know it's the season of the body change it's the season for the promised son to come forth it's the season of the word to be born in your flesh brother Bible say this notice after the appearing in this name of almighty God and it was revealed to him that he was the all-sufficient one he had no helpers he didn't need any secretaries he was God alone and he appeared to Abraham in this name and while he appeared to him in this name and Abraham recognized who he was that's key you got to recognize him as he's revealing himself because that's the answer to your need see what happens when we come and we say God meet my need this way as you miss the revealing of God it's because you've said God here's how you have to reveal yourself no no no no no he Reveals His himself according to the need you have you don't get to tell him how he does it he says Abraham recognize who he was and he changed Abraham's name now listen to this he says now he's come to the fullness of believing now the fullness of believing now see where the church has come I hope you can read between the lines we've come to the place where he's revealed to him who he was then he changed Abraham's name so that the promise could be fulfilled he says he's he's come to the fullness of believing now there's a time for believing in the simple fact is in that time nothing happens or nothing appears to be happening and that has nothing to do with whether you believe or not let me say that again the fact that nothing's happening does not mean you don't have faith it has nothing to do with your lack of faith it has everything to do with the timing of God Amen but the delay of the promise of God does not have anything to do with our faith and only to do with the timing and the plan of God that's his Sovereign portion and we can't change it but just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean you don't have faith doesn't mean you don't believe doesn't mean you're not a believer but it means God's moving and it's in his side of things Abraham could not have sped up the promise of God if he tried more faith would not have quickened Isaac's arrival see we we get human in this we get human and we say well if I could only then no God's got it it's his Covenant it's his Covenant and he's building us up perfectly to be in time with his word he's an on-time God and he's got an on-time bride trust in that amen but at near the end of this thing there's a fullness of believing now in other words the things going to come together you put it all on the line you've held fast what God has said you you've lived your life by it you confessed it and God says now what he's saying is we're in the season of The Promise we're in the time of fulfillment now is the time where Faith becomes sight now your virtue won't just hold you but your virtue will produce it'll bring out something that you couldn't do yourself why because the all-sufficient has visited you and when he does it it's a perfect work it's an on-time work and everything you have need of is found in his visitation brother I would say it this way he says notice he changed his name there from Abram to Abraham which means father of Nations he added to ham Abraham so he did this so that the complete promise could be fulfilled see what we have to realize is that the whole journey is part of the promise Abraham's separation Abraham's walking Abraham's living intense Abraham going to a new land was all a part of the promise of Isaac we keep looking for the end and saying that's all we need no everything in between is all part of the promise that's what he's saying here he did this so that the complete promise could be fulfilled some of it had already been fulfilled he says and and the son now that had been promised so long could be seen or otherwise be revealed when he changed his name and after he recognized who he was he might have thought that there was a party of them remember three men came he says but he recognized that he was Elohim God alone but when he did that and then he changed his name he said now Abraham you're no more to be called Abram but Abraham for a father of Nations I made you Abraham now he's in condition now he's in condition after revelation of who he is he is now in condition to see the sun revealed Abraham's body hasn't been changed and brother but I'm saying he's in condition now why because virtue has been given he's been nursing he's been dwelling on the work of God he's been dwelling on that experience when God does something for you feed on it hold on to it and when God came down to Abraham and said now is the time Abraham started drawing strength from that and it put him in a condition to where the results could start coming out of his life what was it what was the event that started this Final Countdown to the birth of Isaac it was virtue being drawn from God under the revelation of who God was to him El Shaddai the breast of one that he could nurse from what it is it sparked a supernatural revelation what is it body change time for the birth time for the word to come forth so if we go back to Hebrews 11 and read it again we'll close on this thought says through faith also Sarah herself receives strength she received virtue to conceive seed that's as dunamis this is the very virtue of Christ and was delivered of a child when she was passage because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as dead as many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable Sarah herself got a personal visitation now God's covenant was with Abram with Abraham and he comes and he speaks with Abraham and she's just eavesdropping through the tent but as so she wasn't a part of the conversation but as soon as he catches her thought he engages her and he corrects her and in that correction she receives strength and she recognizes who that man is because he says at according to the time of life I I she recognizes this is God himself she didn't believe it at first but when he discerned the thoughts and intents of her heart now she believed and it struck something and all of a sudden she receives virtue she receives strength she she recognizes what's going on she went from doubting the promise to nurturing the promise what a change church you've got to have a personal experience with Christ it'll change the way you think it'll change the way you live it'll change the way you wait it'll change your attitude it'll change your approach and it'll give you faith and it'll give you strength trust God until his time he comes around him and what it'll do it'll bring your body subject to the word of God bring your body subject to the word of God that's all the Rapture is is your body letting go of the last little bit of strength it has and defeating gravity and it gets glorified and off you go it's just the last step of what's been going on all along that's why I said you've got to see that the entire thing is the promise not just the rapture it's all a rapture if you can ever realize God's speaking to you it may be over this pulpit it may be a service you stream it being maybe a message you listen to it may be the word that you're reading it could be fellowship with a brother or sister it could be a donkey it could be a worldly person I've had God speak to a worldly person before but if you can recognize it's God and take strength from the fact that he's come down to let you know it'll give you strength it'll give you virtue to keep pressing on Amen until we have that we'll struggle we'll fight we'll fuss we'll Wonder we'll doubt we'll get jaded all of those things but when we realize that he is the one that's talking to us and he's sorting out our issues and he's dealing with what's going on then we start to get strength amen why because he says it's me I'm God and I'm here to talk to you today I'm here to get into your situation what is it it's God With Us but what kind of virtue did Sarah receive it says she received virtue she receives strength to conceive went from God with her to God in her it was a supernatural event right it wasn't just a repaired body you know they do these makeovers now where they take somebody that just looks all frumpy and old and tired out and then they doll them all up and they push and they poke and they do this and that and the other thing and then they bring them out and everybody goes wow that was all underneath that well still underneath that as soon as she takes a shower it's going to be all back but that's what they do is they push and poke and prod and get everything all glammed up to make you think that that person's a new person and they're not the same person's there the the the 24 hours of the week of work that they did on that poor woman did not change her she still is old and still as worn out as she ever was but they painted everything on but this is not what happened to Sarah Sarah didn't get a makeover Sarah got a new body what was it it was the third revealing of God and it was in her and Abraham's bodies brother Brown says this he says we know that God had to do something to the womb anyhow of Sarah didn't he she'd been bearing all these years nearly a hundred years old and was Barren in order to do something to make this he had to recreate something in that woman's womb to make it fertile is that right in order to do that he had to stimulate her heart because she couldn't go in labor like that a woman 100 years old is that right couldn't do it all right another thing what about the milk veins he says God doesn't patch up anything God doesn't patch up anything he made Sarah a new woman he made her a young beautiful woman again and he made Abraham a young man again he just turned them back to show what he's going to do in the Rapture with us I've spoken on this many times and it still makes me laugh he says abimelech fell in love with her can you imagine if he wasn't a king the razzing he'd get for falling in love with an 89 year old laughs old grandma little bitty hat on top of her head and you know and said oh you're fair to look upon dear you're fair to look upon yeah nonsense he made her a beautiful young woman sure he did what's he going to do to us old people one of these days change us back Hallelujah all the days of my full time said job I'll wait till my time comes amen when my change will summon yes sir will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and be caught up together with them resurrected ones to meet the Lord in the air and be forever and forever be with them he says oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them might have think of that no matter what happens here on Earth that has nothing to do with it I'll Fly Away one of these mornings I talked about this last service how that word virtuous is only mentioned four times in scripture and every single time it's about a woman it's always about a woman first one we said was Ruth and listen Ruth didn't have a history anybody will be proud of she didn't have a reputation yet scripture calls her virtuous and then other three are all in the Book of Proverbs and every single one of them refer to a wife remember we read with that virtue that dunamis is but see virtue is a noun it's something but virtue has to become a person so if we look at what that word dunamis means come back in my notes here real quick the word dunamis means power strength ability Mighty work Miracle power and resources arising from large numbers power resting in armies or forces it's a noun it's a thing but now it becomes an attribute and that's what Peter was getting at is it has to not just be a thing but it has to be an attribute it has to be a living virtue and that word virtuous means strong Mighty able efficient wealthy forceful an army that's what the bride of Christ is when she has this kind of virtue but remember brother Brown said here's where so many get knocked down we've got to get it before we give it you got to nurture and draw strength you've got to feed on the word daily you got to set aside time for yourself daily this is simple this is Christianity 101 Church and yet brother Brown says so many get knocked down right here they try to give without taking they don't draw from the one that has it and so they set themselves up for failure because the end of the day comes and they've run out of Christianity they've run out of strength they've run out of patience they've run out of all these things amen I'm talking to us all now not just our sisters but I think our sisters have it the worst many times some of our brothers are putting in more time than others and trying to get ahead but these mothers and wives is 24 7 job it seems like you've got to put that time in and husbands we've got to be able to let them do it can sit back and say no no you just have to squeeze it in no we've got to take up some of that load so they can get that time amen amen Brothers can't just leave it on their shoulders and say fit it in that's your Christian Duty how about it's our Christian duty to share the load amen preaching to myself and then we can't run dry before the day's over gotta be able to sit down say I actually need something you know what that takes humility takes honesty it takes a hard look to say you know what the attitude is not what it ought to be and that means I'm running dry on something there's only one person can give it and that's Christ amen don't go on your phone don't go on your phone or your computer your tablet don't go read Lucy mob Montgomery sit down and have a chat with Elohim but thou Shaddai amen with a manual talk to him about your situation talk to him about your problems talk to him about your frustrations but don't leave it as those things draw strength from the word that resolves every one of those things amen get in there and feed on it musicians I'm going to have you come I want to read just a couple quotes before we go you've got to get to a place where you can have a conversation and God fills you up church is a part of it we come in for strength you know what my friend Roy that comes in and he was saying you know I come in to get strength that's a good thing for encouragement but that's only a couple hours a week two days a week we've got to have a source and it can't just be over this Pulpit amen but I just want to share two quotes with you I was listening to this the other day and it was at the very end of a message and it just struck me beautifully how Peter said add to your faith virtue and we say what does that look like brother John we've looked at it with Sarah Abram but I want to show you something in our time because it's it's our sign because remember scripture says as it was in the days of Noah as the days of as it was in days of Sodom and Gomorrah so it's going to be in our day God above us God With Us God in us and we've got to see a revealing of that we've got to see that here and we saw it through a son of man ministry didn't we but remember it can't just stop with the son of man there has to be a woman that brings forth life there's got to be a word that's produced amen brother Brown would say that same Jesus lives today and the Bible says in the New Testament the book of Hebrews that he now is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities do you all believe that do you believe it he says how is it then touch him not touch the pastor not touch the Evangelist but touch Christ he has got to act the same that he did then and if he doesn't then we're serving another Christ who is only similar to the one that was the Bible said he is the same Jesus the Same power so it isn't the virtue of some man's hands it isn't he says listen to this it's the virtue of your own faith in the resurrected Christ that you believe Hebrews 13 8. my brethren I have nothing wrong with laying on hands anointing the sick anything you want to do but the real thing is to believe him that he's raised from the dead and he's present to manifest himself and every Power that he ever did he is the same yesterday today and forever amen what does that look like brother John listen to this here's a little woman laying here on the stretcher let's stand together if we would here's a little woman laying out here on the stretcher can you hear me lady laying on that stretcher he says yeah I cannot heal you I know nothing about you you're just a stranger to me but do you believe that Jesus Christ can reveal to me what your trouble is would that help you it would if you lay there you're going to die you only have one chance to live that's except Christ he says you have cancer that is right you believe that God will make you well now you do raise up your hand if you believe it all right she's laying on a stretcher Church she has no strength so he says do what you can he says you have he says raise up your hand if you believe it all right she's laying flat on a stretcher and she does the one thing that most of us can do she says Lord I believe he says in your place the only thing that you could do would be rise up out of that bed and take up what you're laying on and go home claiming your faith in God as the Seed of Abraham he says Rise Up In The Name of Jesus now watch this progression you can hear more as you listen on the tape and I encourage you to go listen to it he says see she raises up to take her promise in God now watch now her faith in the word has caused her to sit up in the bed so she's gone from flat on her back to sitting up but he says you got to get out of the stretcher she's too weak she had strength to raise her hand her faith gave her strength to sit up he says but you got to get out of that stretcher now watch what brother Branham does he says how many the rest of you believe with all your heart now there's virtue in Fellowship there's virtue in having Believers around you what is it the body adds their faith to hers they're believing with her he says stand up he says you got strength you have some strength he says God will give you strength what is it God will give you the level raised raise it up to where you need to walk he says Rise up to your feet and there's a space of time and then he says there she is up up off of the stretcher see we want to say boom it's done I'm out no no no remember Paul looking on a man perceived that he had faith brother I'm looking at that woman perceived she had Faith but she need a virtue but her faith got her to the place where she could say I believe and that I added some virtue to her enough to where she could sit up but that wasn't enough and then he said let's all pull let's all do this together let's encourage our sister how many are believing now and then what is it it's God and his people and faith comes in and pours into that virtue and that woman sits up and then she stands up and she walks away off of her stretcher we need each other we need each other but we need him Above All Else amen amen God's grace to us heavenly it's just you can't too much you can't take too much but you got to take you have to receive before you can give and there's a source of strength we have and it is only through Christ the word amen take your time take your time to get away take your time to settle in take your time to say Lord the road's law sometimes it's steep but I'm coming to you and I'm going to give you the time I'm going to show my faith because I'm coming to you and you alone and in that I'm expecting The Virtue the strength I need to continue on in this walk amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord your word is so wonderful Lord the revealing of your word Lord the greatest thing that we
