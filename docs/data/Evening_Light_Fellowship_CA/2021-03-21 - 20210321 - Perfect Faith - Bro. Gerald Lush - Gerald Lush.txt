be the glory amen and we need god to speak to us praise the lord and trust not only here no but those online amen i trust they're awake and out of their beds but we we pray the lord is going to change this situation maybe back to normal for a while but didn't get all of this what's going on it's just a test of our faith that's true god's allowing it oh god's doing that allowing that to out there in the world yeah for them for them for them but yeah but he's looking for something in us too amen whatever he does to bring up what's in them is going to bring out what's in you and me amen they're going not going by faith but we're going by faith by the grace of god and that's some of the thoughts that we want to share with you this this morning in that we just went through a message on perfect faith and our brother jonathan expressed appreciation for it he said it's a message that he felt maybe that we should be hearing every week you know at least once a week we should be hearing this message on perfect faith why because we need to be kept mindful amen of what god is looking for in your heart and in mind amen and not and again perfect faith it's a faith faith that begins a faith that ends it's a faith that's totally absolutely complete amen in all that god's looking for we have that faith amen all that god has done and is doing and will do we have it in our faith praise the lord and we're moving on to follow his leadership so that's the truth brother brother brown highlighted it perfect faith and it's therefore it's there yet for our salvation it's good oh i'm saved you know in my heart and my soul but again we're looking for our salvation in our flesh to be to be redeemed amen a new body like unto his glorious body so brother i trust that we got the faith oh i'm saved yeah good but what's going on in your life what's going on amen is he still working in you with you or are you just going by the faith of what he did but you don't have the faith of what he's doing and maybe we don't have the faith of what he's going to do amen well i tell you the world is not living by that kind of faith no no and a lot of the churches out there it's just the faith of what god has done and if he did it for me he did this he did this what's he doing he did that but what's he doing now amen so there's many that see god in the in the past but not very many are identifying with god in the present tense amen and believing all what he's going to do well yeah there's still others out there that mark that's the faith that jesus brought out in martha amen when he talked about lazarus rising from the dead yeah oh yeah she said he's going to rise in the resurrection up the road jesus said i am the resurrection and the life believeth out of this so he amen he was challenging her faith amen and he's challenging our faith now amen do you believe over well the word the world is getting to a place where it's it's all going down down down it's going it's going to be judged and it's going to be destroyed yeah that's that's right that's good but are we going to be destroyed or are we with our faith in jesus getting ready amen to go from this dimension to another dimension i talked about it i'm thinking about it this last couple of days you're certainly all look up because your redemption draws near and i say yes lord i know we have to look up but i said we got to get out of this dimension and into that one first and we don't have to look up for that dimension amen it's just right here amen this is absolutely amazing so we thank god for that revelation amen so we're going to step out of this at a time and into eternity and then look up because the prophet of god did highlight when it comes to the resurrection and the rapture he lightly highlighted that the dead in crisis can appear to the living saints amen and then he said we're going to be changed instantly into a glorified body and get and go into that dimension with them and fellowship with them and he did say we want to fellowship for just uh well we're into eternity but if you're in time you say was fellowship with a short space and then he said all of a sudden then he said we're in that dimension then we're going to look up and then he says there's jesus amen coming in the clouds and and then and uh oh yes it's jesus because he you know he's with us now in the pillar of fire and so on and we with us in our hearts and our souls amen but in that time oh brother and he gets us into that dimension then he goes up to get the body that he died in the body that he he redeemed us in by grace you go up why because the prophet said the body is is right next to the throne of god as a testimony amen that is were redeemed christ has been paid by the grace of god and now the pillar fire goes back to that body and now he's going to come down and receive us onto himself at the end of the ages so it is a tremendous hour that we are living we are living in the end time praise the lord that's good and we see tremendous things happening in the world but i pray the grace of god that the resurrection of the rapture is more precious to us amen then what's going on out there in the world god help us brother that we're going to focus on what he is doing or he's going to do this brother i tell you a lot of what god is doing the people most of the this generation there is looking for god to do it but he's doing it amen it's already in the progress amen but they miss it they fail it so god help us by grace brother that we're going to we believe it we have the faith all right let's go and show we have the faith amen are you going to live that faith are you going to walk that faith are you going to talk that faith amen so brother out again it's just not talking it you got to live it and walk it amen it's got to reflect in your lives amen what you do what you don't do what you want to do and what god wants you to do amen brother this is what we're this is the life we're living you're not living on uh oh my i know that it's going to be very few like that because when he comes will he find that faith amen will he find that faith on the earth and jesus himself is questioning it so he does does he find that faith in you is he finding that faith in me amen praise the lord what for the resurrection the rapture the change by the grace of god amen brother we we got the alpha revelation of god now we're getting into the omega revelation of god amen praise the lord everybody recognize the beginning but there's few acknowledging the end amen the alpha revelation and the omega revelation of god to god be the glory grace to us amen lord bless you let's let's stand and uh i'll leave that to those those who are at home if they want to stand they can stand amen but let's let's be in the spirit whether we're here or whether at home be in the spirit amen and again it's good to see our brother matthew's family amen and sister ambra and and the family god bless you so the grace said oh levi oh i wonder where he was well thank god and and our boy our sister brenda and brother bob amen i trust he's trying to help our elder husband amen during the song service to god be the glory and i was expecting to see brother mark amen i just i'll see him in my mind or in my heart amen god bless him so the grace of god be with us and we're going to sing only believe

of our lord jesus christ help us to believe and help us to believe with a complete belief lord i believe there's something in the future but lord let us believe that it's going on right now amen that we truly have the revelation that it is christ in me the hope of glory it is christ in me the resurrection it is christ in me the rapture hallelujah it is christ in me hallelujah going from time to eternity hallelujah for the glory of almighty god be with us we pray and lord grace said we're going to keep focusing more and more and more on the spiritual focusing more and more and more on eternal amen promise of god lord not just looking for something to go ahead maybe lord oh after we've died after we've done this after we did that lordless believe it's in the progress now amen praise the lord hallelujah that there was a resurrection and there is a resurrection and there was a rapture and there is a rapture and lord help us to get into the revelation the faith of the resurrection the faith of the rapture amen truly lord that faith will take us from time to eternity for your glory your honor your praise i trust lord that we're getting more and more conscious of eternity the lord

christ's name hallelujah now i believe [Music] things are possible now i believe now i'd be [Music] all things are possible now now amen trusting that by grace our lord is recognizing the present tense of our faith praise the lord and that he's working on us through the present tense of our faith not a past tense not the future but the present tense amen if we can get into the present tense brother as god wants us to we'll be we will not be denied the future tense amen see that the past tense is going to force our focus to get us to focus on the present tense and the present tense is moving us to the future praise the lord so i pray god that we have the faith that pleases him that we have the perfect faith well what god has given to us we believe it that's perfect faith what god gave luther and wesley was perfect faith because it was from the lord and it was what they needed for the hour that they were living in amen they were hungry and thirsting for that amen justification argument thirsting for sanctification amen the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit and i tell you brother there was an hour there was a time in that revival when they hungered and they thirsted amen morning noon and night amen whether they walked the street whether they were in church where they were in prayer privately or personally amen that's what they were hungry for thirsting for more of the holy ghost amen it was so powerful and such a wonderful experience to to have god in in them and god with them and amen and have access to the gifts of the spirit oh morning noon and night hallelujah they're focusing on the gift of tongues morning new tonight they're focusing on the gifts of healing and salvation redemption amen other things that god was doing in their hearts and their souls but again let's understand god we did what he did in luther to get him ready for wesley he did what he did in wesley to get him ready for the pentecostal revival amen that's the truth amen it's amazing that if we go in and study it and you go in and search out some of the teachings of even william branham or not william brandon by william booth a man of the salvation army amen and now that he was focusing on the pentecostal revival amen why no one and again it proves it proved what the prophet said yeah god he said raised up william booth with red on salvation he said he said because the methodists had organized so quickly amen so willing booth went on without that organization but nearing the end of his ministry amen why praise the lord he brother he had a revelation he must have had some revelation god had god was dealing with him and revealing those things to him he was preaching by wesley preached justin and luther and justification sanctification jesus has done this jesus has done that amen but then also our brother william booth and as i said his wife catherine that they were they were focusing on the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen the the revival that god gave on the day of pentecost amen well yeah because i remember even within booth and his wife in some of their preachings and teachings there that i can remember whether they were appointing the the people in that generation to pentecost and they oh yeah they were oh yes these william buddha said oh he said you know what we need now we need what they had on the day of pentecost amen you're talking about god in control that was god amen that wasn't man that wasn't lutheran control was in control within moving control no that was god amen because and what was it it was all the scripture it was the word amen god was doing this god was doing that now god wanted to do this and brother he put that he put that revelation in the heart of william boo amen and then the real real real old-fashioned salvationists amen and that's what he was pointing to and not long after that of course not long after god took william booth off the scene amen the pentecostal revival came amen brother and and again i thank god for it praise the lord and now the pentecostal revival has been focusing on the bride revival oh yeah well you you you think that pentecost you know is going to do this going to do that well i tell you there were pentecostals that believed that the pentecostal message was going to move us onto the resurrection and the rapture well yeah they they felt that the climax of what's going on now the pentecostal revival what's going to happen next oh it's got to be the resurrection it's going to be the rapture amen see oh praise the lord thank god brothers for the revelation that we can look back through history and we can see what god has done down true down through the ages that it wasn't man it was god amen brother we thought maybe man did this a man did that oh this was this was the william booth this was martin luther and this was the south and john wesley and and those in the pentecostal revival no it was god it wasn't me and it was god god had given them a revelation and then they believed that amen brother i tell you this they had a perfect faith for the hour that they were living so i trust we got perfect faith in the hour that we're living amen and brother william booth had that had that perfect faith it was what is what that age needed oh brother i tell you it stirred them up and they moved on and john wesley the same thing the per the faith of sanctification oh it stirred them up and they moved on by the grace of god amen and the salvation army came in to take it on amen take it on and on and on amen and point them to the pentecostal revival praise the lord and of course they had it and they that's what god was doing brother now what is god doing i pray the grace of god brother we're not ignoring what he's done and we'll pray grace that we're not going to miss what he's doing amen because i'll brother amen brother don't you see it when it comes to history and the messengers that god has used down through the church ages amen brother right here it's in the scripture this again this is the perfect book this is the perfect bible this is the perfect revelation of the will of god amen this is the perfect revelation of god's plan purpose and pattern amen that in the beginning he created the heaven and the earth period amen praise the name of the lord but then he started to bring out what he was going to do amen this is why he did it amen and this is why he's doing this and this is what he's going to do amen brother thank god amen brother that we can look at look at this book and we can see what god did and we can see what god is doing amen praise the name of the lord brother praise the lord that we we thank god for genesis and right on through the old testament and what god did but thank god for the revelation of what he's doing amen under the new covenant amen and not just not just for us now the gentiles down to the churches but to jews well brother praise the lord amen there are few that see the plan amen that's right that's the truth they read they read the bible and they focus on this focus on that but they they're not bringing out the revelation of the plan of god amen oh just it's just that this happened and god had to do this and this happened and god had to do that well god predestinated it god prophesied it god said i'm this is what's going to happen amen praise the lord and brother one was one was amen he's looking to see what god did and what god was doing and he was giving the people the faith to move on to what he was going to do amen he did it in in the old testament he's doing it in the new testament he did it done it down through the chapter seven church ages amen amen giving us the revelation of what he's doing a greater and a greater and a greater revelation of god a great understanding of god a greater understanding of his plan and his purpose praise the lord hallelujah so we can identify with what he's doing in this day and in this age amen thank god for what he did in luther thank god for what he did in west street and thank god for what he did in the salvation army and the pentecostals but brother what's he doing now amen we want to be part of what he's doing now and when we when we recognize what's and see what's going on out there in the world brother we need to get more and more into the faith of what god is doing for the bride what god is doing for is elect so that we're not going to be caught up with what's going on out there amen brother sister grace so that we're not going to be numbered with those who says where's the rapture it happened and you didn't know it amen i pray god that we know it i pray god that we're a part of it amen i pray god that we're amen that the revelation of the rapture is in us amen praise the lord and i'll tell you if it's there it's going to pull us further and further away from the world and we're going to get less and less caught up with the world on what's going on there amen and we're going to get more and more caught up with the spiritual with what god is doing by the grace of god amen because brother that's what happened to luther at wesley i tell you this what happened to the salvation army and amen in the early days of the revival amen brother they just got caught up with what god was doing praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus and the way and the william booth just pointed to oh he's going to do this he's going to do that he's got to do it amen we need it praise the lord but brother let's not stay with pentecost let's move on amen brother god god oh yeah god's looking for justification in me sanctification in you amen the baptism of the holy ghost access to the gifts of the spirit amen but now he's looking for resurrection and rapturing faith is that what we're believing is that what we're going to preach on focus on amen brother whatever god's doing that's what we'll focus on by grace amen so the lord bless you and turn with me to james chapter 2 praise the lord james chapter 2 and let's begin to read at verse 14. praise the lord and as i said i want to share with you some thoughts of the prophet in the message works is faith expressed amen and i'm reading the scriptures that brother random read before he got into the message on works his faith expressed and to understand also that the prophet of god as he when he got up behind the pulpit the anointing must have struck him concerning that what god was doing in his ministry amen what god was doing in the bride and this message was preached november the 26th 1965 and that's about three or four weeks before god called him home amen but he was he was identifying with something that god had done in his in his his ministry that god had done in his life and what god had done in others amen and then yet there was still a mystery because we know that it was god was bringing forth the resurrection god was bringing forth the rapture god was doing this and god was doing that amen and he talked about having a dream but he said again he said i don't dream i don't have dreams because he had visions but the lord showed him a dream amen and brother and he and he basically was showing him the revelation of the rapture the revelation of the resurrection amen and brother he was screaming in the dream to to warn this one to warn that one to one another one and this one was lining up and that one was going going on and going on but then he said he all of a sudden he cried he called out the name of a certain brother amen that to do this to do this to do that and he he never got any response from that brother and that's one of the concerns that he is mentioning in the first part of this message here is he shares those experiences and and he tried to get that brother's attention but he couldn't do it the brother never responded and brother brown was wondering what's going on you know and so on and uh and he also shared shared the dream with that brother amen and i a brother that that most of us all know and not what i mean is that we know him through the message we've heard the problem of god mention his name a number of times a man but in this dream and brothers are one of the last experiences that the prophet of god had before god took him off the scene amen but as i said that brother did not respond to the prophet and he couldn't hear him and he i don't know if he could see him or not but he just trying he was screaming out to him to do this to do this to do this but no no response and of course that brother is he's gone on now for quite a number of years and uh his wife of course is still with us and she's still working at the voice of god so but we pray the grace of god that our brother that brother brown was looking for would rest in rest in peace amen that he did that he didn't miss it but by grace somewhere that amen some reason that that he never responded to the prophet in that dream so god had mercy on us brother sister listen we ought to take it serious amen not nothing that's not emotion it's not sensation it's not feeling it is faith amen and so again go back and listen to the message perfect faith and the message works is faith expressed amen and again he preached this one in november just before the lord took him off the earth he knew his time was coming because at the beginning of 1965 he was preaching somewhere up in northern united states and he said here i am and he said i see my end coming at six at 56 years old amen that's what he said praise the lord god had a reason amen and again let's very rem remember what he said that what was in his heart he said i'll take it it'll be in my heart when i go when he went to his grave and it was there's a lot of things he wouldn't tell he wouldn't reveal but brother i believe that we're seeing a lot of it i pray grace that we have spiritual revelation amen to know what's going on amen spiritual revelation by the grace of god perfect faith by the grace of god and again faith is a revelation perfect faith is the perfect revelation of god in the hour we're living god help us amen in james chapter 2 and verse 14 what doth it prophet my brethren thou a man say he hath faith and have not works amen god help us he said can faith save him it's a living faith yes it was a dead faith no if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit and he said even so he said faith if it hath not works is dead amen being alone oh i believe this and i believe that yeah but if you truly believe it in your heart it's going to reflect in your life your faith amen so even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou hast faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i will show thee my faith by my works amen thou believers say there is one god thou do as well the devils also believe and tremble amen but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead they got faith they got the revelation of this message oh i believe this and i believe this this is what god has done i believe what god is doing amen grace but brother is a controlling you or influencing your life what you do how you do it how you live what you talk and how you talk and so on amen is it influencing your conversation amen perfect faith with the perfect anointing amen there are those with faith but it's a dead work amen praise the lord and it says well thou know vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar amazing talk about perfect faith while his faith without work without the works wasn't would be dead but just think what god asked abraham to do and he's going to do it how much will we do how far will we go amen brother i trust we got the leadership of the holy ghost and not just a religious spirit amen so he said was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar right see thou out faith brought with his works and by works was faith made perfect amen and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god hallelujah yeah ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only amen likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and it sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also god bless his word you may be seated amen you have faith show me your faith don't tell me your faith show me your faith amen and that's what god's looking for a faith that controls the life you live amen a faith that influences the life you live what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it amen because it has to be for the glory of god amen turn with me to genesis chapter 22 and again to remind you that this that the prophet read i think it was four scriptures before going into the message works is faith express and in genesis chapter 22 and verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of my this is amazing god was going to ask him to sacrifice his son not a sheep not a lamb not even a goat but sacrifice his son amen and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went on to the place of which god had told him and then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye ear with the with the ass and i that i am the lad will go beyond go yonder and worship and come again to you well he didn't lie oh but he was going to kill isaac yes but he but he had his faith not only believed in the death his faith believed in the resurrection amen he had that faith in their faith that he he could sacrifice isaac and amen and that god would raise him again from the dead amazing what is our faith what is our faith we want to do this we want to do that do this do this do this do what god wants you to do amen amen and again isaac speak unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together amen and they came to the place which god had told him off and abraham built an altar there and laid wood on in order and bound isaac his son and laid him upon the altar upon the wood amen praise the lord pray grace lord abraham didn't stop and wait no no he just knew that there was something god god was moving in his in his life god was moving in isaac's life and so on because god had promised that he was going to have that child isaac and so on and through isaac this would happen and that would happen so on so he knew that if he if he did what god wanted him to do and sacrificed his son he knew that god would have to raise him up from the dead amen to do what he said he would do through isaac amen praise the name of the lord what faith do we have amen see our faith is only in the present tense what's going on this is going on that's going on but god wants you to do this and then then he'll change that by grace amen you got to take your stand for god amen praise the name of the lord for in the midst and in in the presence of family friends and neighbors you got to give god the preeminence amen amen they're not going to take god's place they're not going to get your attention amen more than god god got your attention what does god want you to do amen see works is faith expressed abraham had the faith and he went and did what god wanted him to do amen at least he did it all and got ready for it amen made the altar and even put isaac on the altar and he had raised the the the knife that he that he was going to use amen praise the lord amen say god let it go right on and on and on and on amen right to the almost to the end of it amen but when he raised his hand with the knife the angel stopped them praise the name of the lord hallelujah and sometimes god is looking for that same faith in you and me god wants you to move on move on move on and brother if and it brought forward to manifest your faith amen because works is faith express he wants you to show the works amen not just talk it walk it amen by the grace of god go and do it lord i'm doing this for your glory your honor and praise because i believe you i believe that you're with me i believe that you're going to do this you're going to do that amen so lord help me that i'm going to have the works of the faith that you've given me praise the lord if god has given faith god's going to look for the works amen why because you're going to testify of god amen testify of your faith amen god help us to believe genesis no and uh the next scripture is romans chapter four the prophet reads a number of scriptures romans chapter four praise the lord and verse 1. what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh as found and if abraham were justified by works he hath wear off to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture because why because script because the works had to be motivated by the by faith amen it's just not your idea to do this your idea do that oh i just want to do this for the lord brother what does your faith tell you amen brother you've got to yes your wife because what you do has got to be an expression of your faith works is faith expressed but make sure it's the works that please god amen it's the works that god wants you to do and verse 2 says that if abraham were justified by works he had we're off to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness amen that he had such faith in god amen there was no doubt whatsoever whatever god said abram believed it he never doubted he never questioned it he just know he knew it was god and he moved on amen and god recognized that faith amen and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of depth amen but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly amen his faith is counted for righteousness amen how righteous are we in the presence of god through our lord jesus christ how does god recognize your faith not in your head but in your heart amen that you love the lord that you love god you love his word you love his sons and daughters amen praise the name of the lord you love what god has done what god is doing you love what he's going to do amen and you're always expressing appreciation thank you lord hallelujah that you brought me in thank you lord that you you brought made me a part of what you're doing i'll give you the glory lord i'll give you the honor i'll give you the praise and lord i'll go forth and show the works of the faith you've given me amen is not doing the works that we oh i trust the lord be pleased with the works i'm doing brother god is god's got to see your faith amen that the works you're doing is the result of the faith he's given you amen it's not oh it's not your religious ideas and religious thoughts and you're going to go and do this and do this and god don't recognize it if it's not connected with the faith that he gave you it was not motivated by the faith that he has given you amen and again by grace through faith are you saved and that not of yourself it is the gift of god amen and god gives you the faith that he wants you to have it gives you the faith that he knows is going to bring you to perfection amen it gives you the faith that will line you up with his will amen by the grace of god by grace through faith amen brother all down through it's been faith you take the book of hebrews and chapter 11 amen by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice by faith they did this by faith they did that oh yeah enoch was translated it was by faith what a faith he had amen and by faith abraham did this by faith they did that amen because that's what god recognizes and that's what god will acknowledge in your life is faith amen brother oh what but works yeah but it's god goes back beyond the works to see what what motivated those works why did you do it why are you doing it why why have you taken your stand that you are taking for the lord amen is it works is it the letter of the word or the spiritual revelation amen is it faith real faith there's too many that are going and that's all they have is religion amen they're controlled by religion they're governed by religion amen oh our religion is this our religion is that what about your faith to what you believe amen and believe in your heart by the grace of god not in your head many have got religion and in their heads but they don't have that faith in their hearts that's the truth i've met many many people over the years amen some are just religious and others are spiritual oh yeah i admit i just like i've already mentioned and gave testimony of it anglicans a couple of anchors that i met one time and they were spiritual amen it's like the animal man that came to my home a couple of times and like i said he gave me the tithes and he thanked me i thank you he said for you know what what you've done and you spiritually and and just encouraged me and so on and again and when i went somewhere to uh my i might have been the senior citizens home the glenbrook lodge at the time and this one of the men that was always in the chapel when i was there he was anglican that's the truth and he was right there worshiping and praising the lord and again one day i went there and he wasn't he didn't come to the chapel but then that's when the nurse come in and says pastor this this gentleman wants to see you he's in his room and he's sick and like i said i went off and he had his bible there and he had on things underlined in his bible and so on and and he said just well he said pastor thank you i just want you to have a word of prayer for me and uh but he knew that he was go he was dying he's i'm going and like i said he even showed me the scripture and he said that's i'm with that group right there he said and i said i believe it i said you're going to be there by the grace and he was anglican oh yeah and again like i said i i've been blessed by by the testimony of other roman catholics even oh yes and sometimes they'll bring things more more spiritual than what the protestants would bring out that's the truth praise the lord like i said that woman that was a neighbor to me one time some years ago and she's gone on and she just come out and she said excuse me what about this and i explained it oh she said that's right she said i believe that thank you yeah she be hallelujah amen god was was was vindicating her faith god was bringing out manifesting her faith amen at least to me and she's going on now and i think she was in her 90s when when the lord took her home amen so i i pray you grace you see and like i said keep your spirit right keep your attitude right toward everybody amen because there's some of the bride but others again like i said they're they're of god's calling but not not the chosen bride so they're going to be outside the city amen to god be the glory and again oh praise the lord i think it's a revelation we need amen to believe what god has done in this hour and he's doing in you and me amen that's the problem god said we want to reach everyone with this message no but he said bride because the message is the calling of the bride but but there's going to be others out there they're going to be saved so we pray the grace of god to them concerning what god is doing and what's what god is has done and what god is doing in these last days and i'll tell you that there are even even in denominational churches there are still those out there that brother they're spiritual amen they're not and again they're not not not everybody but many of them are spiritual in their hearts they see what's going on and they believe god and and they just say lord just just help us to keep believing help us to keep pressing on lord now they're not bright if they're bride they be in the message but they're definitely not bright saying yet it's been a mistake and a misunderstanding among a lot of believers thinking that we've got a witness of this message to everyone everyone everyone no no you should you just follow the leadership of god amen as the prophet of god said and he's if you're talking to a farmer i think it was and he said and he said you and he said something comes up it's spiritual and he said you can mention something with the lord and if you feel anything he said they're coming back at you he said change the conversation just go on talking about farming or if he's a car salesman he said you can speak something spiritual and if they resist it he said just keep on talking about cars see keep your attitude right and your spirit right amen because i tell you we are not self-righteous we're righteous amen we are righteous through our lord jesus christ amen so keep your attitude right and your spirit right amen these are those that are ordained to go in the resurrection and the rapture amen for to be the bride of the lord jesus christ amen we are we are united with him it is the as the prophet said we are experiencing the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly body amen so are we are do we have the faith of the bride of christ and do we have the works amen of the bride of christ amen by the grace of god in genesis again romans chapter 4 and verse 1 again what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath we're off to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god amen grace that we believe god amen oh well i believe the message so does the devil amen do we believe god that we have that faith in god amen god help us that we we believe him we we love him we trust him we respect him we respect his word and we respect his it's his sons and daughters amen so he said for what saith the scripture abraham believed god you believe god do you believe what he said do you believe what he's what he's what he did you believe what he's doing you believe what he's going to do amen for abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness so how righteous are we yeah but does god recognize that righteousness and the only way that god's going to recognize that righteousness is the faith that's in your heart amen there's too many of there they got the message in their heads but they're not righteous before god because they're not in their hearts amen because i i've met so-called believers and they're just that their spirit and their attitude is not spiritual no it's more religious than spiritual they're just religious got religious spirits oh yeah they read the message yeah but you can meet the devil and you tell you the same thing i believe the message and sometimes the devil is more enthused and excited over all these things what's going on than so-called believers amen god help us brother so again verse 4 not to now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of death and he said to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness amen but brother it's a faith but it's a faith with works you do god gives you the faith and you go and you live it and you walk it and you can talk it amen not just talk it but you live it and you walk it god help me have mercy amen that we go forth today amen with the righteousness of our faith amen that god is god was with me to bring me in here god's going to with me to go out and god's going to be with me when i do this when i go here when i go there there's nowhere you can go and leave god out there's nothing you can do and and forget the lord no no you want god in it all as i said in regards to the work that i did i wanted to do it in the name of the lord regardless of the work that i did i i just wanted god's leadership and god's anointing to god help me to do it amen and that's why it's like i said they said oh brother you do this you do this this is wonderful this is wonderful no it's not me it's jesus amen he's with me to help me he gives me the wisdom he gives me the understanding amen he's given me this leadership by the grace of god amen and brother again oh my well we think well no no and god's not in that you're in the department store there yes god's in it god's helping me amen brother and they asked me one time just how you do this how do you do that now do you do that and why do you do this what i said well i said i don't want to leave god out of it and i said oh because they said you're doing something this is good and that's good oh my and you get the results of this and results of that oh my this is amazing and you had no experience in that and i said no i never had no experience in that but i said i thank the lord i said he's with me and he's helping me and he's given me the wisdom that i need oh they said this is good why because when i would go to do work here and do the work there they just thought i was really experienced but it wasn't me it was god amen yes don't be afraid don't be ashamed of him don't be afraid to confess that i'm a christian amen and and the lord's with me and the lord is helping me and and regarding you or whatever i'll pray for you amen again as i said it's just like that that woman that that i met at that funeral two or three years ago and she looked older woman and then she said you don't know me no brother she said thank the lord she said she said i work with you and she said and it was in that department store and she said also she said she said i was having a child and she said they they figured child was going to be dead or no they had a child and child was sick and they expected to die and she said and you told me i told you and you told me you're going to pray for me and you did she said and his child lived and he's healthy and now and i just this is amazing amen brothers years later when i get the phone call and i was living in here and moved in here and this and this person called me on the phone and says brother oh i want you to pray for me she said you prayed for me and i lived and she said i've got children of my own now she said and one of them is very sick and she said if the lord don't do something she said the child would die so she says i want you to pray for me and pray for for my child well i said okay i'll do that god bless you and i did and again it was a number of years later a few years later not very many i just said out in a supermarket out there we were walking and we're getting ready to go down or just came up the the the bridge or the steps and this i said i just noticed this woman there two or three women and and three or four children and one of them came right over to me amazing they they knew me but i didn't know them and she came over to me and she said expect oh you're a pastor lost i said yes i am oh she said thank you she said i want to remind you she said i called and i asked you to pray for this child she said there it is and the child was growing up oh she said and the lord answered prayer i said hallelujah amen amen that was tremendous so brother is giving god the glory amen and god was expressing appreciation well i said thank the lord i said that's wonderful yes she said thank you for praying for brother who's going to be next will it be another child i said another grandchild or great-grandchild amen but i'll tell you this i believe it's gonna that testimony go right on into eternity oh yeah praise the lord so i pray grace that we're gonna live in the spirit walk in the spirit amen as i said no matter what i did everything was spiritual spiritual and at one point there when i was in the in a in the area where i worked there and one of the management come out and says excuse me i said yes they said do you preach i said yes you do i said oh yes i said we have we have a cottage meeting i said not far from here and they said oh you preach oh oh that's good they said thank you and he said i i and you did this and and and this is this is going to happen and so on i said oh yeah always a good thank you thank you and they'd be glad because what it was a spiritual and i was trusting the lord amen so god oh brother i pray in the name of jesus that we'll be spiritual in our homes spiritually in our hearts spiritually in our jobs amen spiritual in our association with friends amen not religious now but spiritual amen and there are sometimes that others won't they won't they won't respect when it comes to religion but if you're spiritual they're respected amen how many times that people know that maybe you some of you might have experienced it how many times about the experience you're in fellowship with this one fellowship with that one and they're talking then all of a sudden they'll they will curse or swear oh i'm sorry i'm sorry forgive me i i didn't mean to do that that it said i know you're a christian and they said we don't i wouldn't do that oh and again again i was asked how come you do this how come you do that you know and you know when to do this you know when to do that well i said i usually pray about it and i follow god's leadership oh you do oh well that's why those things are working out i said yes oh this after a while they come they said listen we wanted we want you to do this we want you to do that amen they wouldn't get somebody else to do it did they get me to do it too but but i want to give the glory to god amen others are going around giving oh to just constantly talking about those things but just once in a while i give that with that witness and that testimony god's have mercy on us let's be spiritual thought word indeed spiritual not just in church but at home let's be spiritual not just at home at work amen be spiritual amen so that those people that you're working with and working with you they're not working with this one or that one they're working with jesus amen that's right they're working with jesus they come to your home to come to visit jesus by the grace of god amen thank the lord praise the lord sorry romans chapter 4 yeah we we read it listen again abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him for righteousness amen because he believed in his heart you're righteous if you're righteous god recognize your faith in your heart not your head amen god recognizes truly that you're born again from the inside out amen and verse 5 again of chapter 4 to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness amen god give us faith trust the lord amen even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works alleluia saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin amen and one more scripture genesis 15 amen praise the lord and in genesis chapter 15 just a couple of verses after these things verse 1 the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abraham said lord god will thou what will thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazar of damascus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall be thine thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be shall be thine air amen and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars and if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness praise the lord he believed he didn't question god he believed god he didn't know god he trusted god amen praise the name of the lord and after having read all these scriptures the prophet of god said now he said paul justified abraham by what god saw in abraham but he said james justified abraham by what man saw in abraham so we're justified not by what man sees but by what god sees amen so he said abraham believe god and that's what god saw in him he believed it but then when he went to acting as though it was already done that's what man saw in abraham amen praise the lord hallelujah do we have that absolute faith in the resurrection that absolute faith in the rapture that we're not looking for for this to improve out here we're looking for our faith to improve we're looking for our faith to grow and increase amen so that oh but there's too many just still looking for god to change that out there no he's got to start here amen when it comes to the changing of the world he's got to start with you and me in our hearts and our souls amen so do we believe god as abraham believed god amen and if we believe god as abraham believed god we're going to go forth with the works of faith amen oh yeah you're going to reflect your faith in the works you do in what you do and how you do it amen are we going to do it as god wants us to do it are we just going to do this oh i just want to impress god and all you impress god by what he wants you to do amen not by what you want to do and if we're born again and we have the faith the true faith that pleases god we're going to do what god wants us to do we're going to do what pleases god again as jesus said not my will but thine be done praise the lord amen and there are religious people and there's oh yeah there's so many a believer they wanted they feel to do this they feel to do that oh they oh i'm a believer so i'm going to do this for god i'm going to do that for god but does god want you to do it amen brother we can do this and do that brother and it's and again it's not by faith it's by sight oh yeah it's our feelings not our faith so brother what god the the life that god is looking for us to live is the life that's that's controlled by faith amen we're doing this we're doing that because this is what i feel god wants me to do amen but oh my it can get right down to our personal lives amen brother that's where it starts our personal lives amen are you doing what god wants you to do amen is god in control of your thoughts your words your deeds is god in control of your spirit and your attitude amen are you reflecting god in your everyday living are reflecting the love of god the grace of god the mercy of god amen are you reflecting the righteousness of god amen because this is this is what faith is considered amen righteousness abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness amazing and if we believe god is accounted to us for righteousness amen it is the righteousness that's imputed to us by faith amen holy ghost faith amen you can be religious and you can believe this believe this believe that in your head but it's not righteous in the eyes of god you're just religious amen but you believe it in your heart oh god looks down and he sees the righteousness of god in in you amen why because what you believe is the revelation of the word in your soul redemption salvation amen he's there to help you amen and you're there to let him do what he wants to do through you amen amen you go out as a witness for him you're going to testify of him testify of his grace testify of his mercy and his love testify of his redemption amen praise the name of the lord testify amen of the planned purpose and the pattern of god to oh you're going to give the glory to god most definitely amen if you're redeemed if you're if you feel that you're saved you've had an experience with god amen you're going to give the glory to him thank you lord for this thank you you did this thank you did that lord keep me in the spirit lord amen so i'm going to be led by the spirit sons and daughters of god led by the spirit of god amen by the grace of god by the grace of god amen is his spirit in control of you from your heart praise the name of the lord amen and again the prophet said he said see he said abraham believed god and that's what god saw in him he believed it but then he said when he went to acting as though it was already done that's what man saw in him yeah god saw sees the faith that motivates you why you live the way you live and act the way you act oh it's not because of something in your head no it's it's it's a it's the new life in your heart ah you're born again not not out here not there you're born again in on the inside the inside amen praise the lord but that's what god sees that's what god's looking for what's on the inside of the inside amen man is going to see what you're doing outside well why do you do this why do you do that well it's just the nature of god i guess i i've had an experience with the lord and he's in control amen i'm just going to do what he wants me to do by the grace of god amen so he said god saw his faith but man saw his works praise the lord amen and that's the same as it is to us because our works express what faith we have all right is the life you live at home and at work is the life you live expressing what god sees in you amen praise the lord and that's the same as it is to us because our works express what faith we have but if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it amen sister that's right praise the lord if we're afraid to act on it or uh they'll think i'm religious regard it doesn't make it then what they think what does god think do it for the glory of god amen you're not going to do it to impress anybody amen do it for to be be oh my god hidden and god revealed in simplicity in your life amen praise that you're just yeah you're not you're not showing off as if you're overly spiritual and you're this and you're that no no brother i tell you jesus didn't go and live that kind of life it was god in simplicity amen and then but the thing of the thing of it is that his his life was was was simple his life was humble amen and of course that if you went along with jesus before you knew that he was he was united with god amen praise the name of the lord brother god help us it's not it's not they recognize oh they recognize your faith because oh on wednesday you're going to go to church or sunday you got to go to church well yeah they're religious that's what most people think when you go to church you're religious but there are others who will watch your life and see your see your life more personal and what you're doing and how you do it and the visitors that are coming to you and so on oh yeah they'll recognize oh they're spiritual or they must be christian not this church or that church or that church no you're a christian see a christian is not church like a christian is christ-like amen praise the lord and there's too many church-like there's too many like this and like that and like that amen people can identify him and connect them with maybe with even william branham and they'll connect you with this and connect you with that that's church or that church or their pentecost pentecost no plenty cross yeah brother no no we're spiritual we're christian again as i said that and it's for the glory of god as that elderly man came to me one time when i was working there somewhere and he was older much older than i was then amen and he just said just want to let you know he said that i know you're a christian oh okay thank you oh he said just want to let you know what he said and i don't know what told him or how he i just what what led him to believe that but he said i just just want to thank you yeah amazing to god be the glory how many feel that with you if they meet you brother let's see that you're a christian not you know because of your spirit because of your attitude because of your actions because of your reaction not because it that you as a sister got long hair you as a sister are dressed this way in that way no you're different people recognize you as a christian that's part of it but again it's discerning your spirit and your attitude you know the way you talk the way you do this the way you do that you're not boasting in no one but jesus amen not gonna boast in yourself or we believe this we believe that and so on no see it's just like again there's a lady online i said that there was a gentleman online that's preached for a hour and a half and why he left the brand of message and there's a lady there online and she's she's just talking maybe a half hour or so and you know why she left the brenham message yeah a lady well we call her a lady yeah and she's there and she she's just sitting down and she's just talking talking talking talking why that she was born a man she was born and raised around the message yeah and then as she got older she began to question the message she began to question this and questioned that yeah and they said oh they believed this and they believed that and she felt it wasn't it wasn't right to have that kind of a faith or that kind of religion and but i noticed i said oh i said she's not a believer now i said because i noticed that her hair was down to her shoulders but it was it was cut it was all cut and so on and uh so it's tremendous she was born and raised in the message but she wasn't born again she needed to be born again let me encourage you the the young people around this assembly here good you're in the word but make make your calling and election sure that you're born again make sure that you've got an experience with jesus amen you

jesus amen amen you're going to live the life that's witnessing to others of god and of his word amen you're going to show that you're really really really a different person you got a different attitude a different spirit different motives different objectives by the grace of god amen brother sister again i pray grace that even though you're born and raised in the message i trust the message

our young people that they'll continue to do it amen grow in grace amen and in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen brother if anything that redemption and faith gives us his absolute relationship with jesus a personal relationship with jesus we know him and he knows us amen we know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering amen and we're more than willing amen to suffer yes as jesus suffered amen more than willing to take our stand for the word amen and brother it's not william branham it's not brother gerald amen it's not mom and dad it's

believe in denominations and so on and i was praying and praying and praying and i remember i got down on my knees and still didn't feel enough there and so i got down on my back and i and i started to pull myself under the bed oh yeah i pulled myself under the bed right under the bed and i was holding on to the the bottom part of that bed and i was crying and crying and crying and praying and praying i said lord have mercy have mercy and mercy i need your help amen and then another and then i got out and i walked out the hallway and as i said i looked oh my i passed my my parents room and there there was my mother on her knees yeah and she had her hands up and she was looking up her eyes were closed and she was crying out to god for mercy lord we need you help us lord amen i said well i said praise the lord that's wonderful amen to god be the glory amen so brother see one thing to have faith but let let the life you live and the works you do express your faith yeah oh yeah even as even as a young person you got you go forth let your works express your faith amen let me say sorry to one more again the prophet said because our works express what faith we have okay so how much does your work how much faith does your works express amen place if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it you've got to believe it amen works has faith expressed but brother sister you've got to believe the word in your heart and and i'll tell you if it's in your heart you're not going to force yourself to work it out it'll just automatically oh yeah no matter what you're doing now you're doing what you say it's going to just be spiritual because you're born again you're born again you've got a new nature amen and you're going to live that new nature you're going to talk that little new nature new new nature you're going to go out and it's going to control you in your home it's going to control you in your job that new nature not the old one praise god amen because if we got the right nature we got a right motive and a right objective amen so do you have a right motive for living the way you live but objective for living the way you live doing what you do you've got to got to be for the glory of god whatever we do in word or deed let's do it for the glory of god amen abraham's works was expressing his faith he had in god's promise yeah amen god promised the son through the son he was going to be blessed and now god asked him to sacrifice his son amen but he believed oh i'll do it lord oh what faith never questioned god amen never questioned god he just was going to do it oh my went out and he told the others to stay down there and he and him and him and izzy went up to the to the mountain and he built the altar amen the fire and everything and he put but isaac maybe oh my what was isaac's faith amen what did isaac feel about that amen when i told the brother he must have had the same faith as his father amen believing that amen that god was able to raise him from the dead amen so brother he didn't run away from his father he didn't fight his father and abraham laid him up there on the altar amen no doubt maybe spoke to the lord and he's there lord i'm gonna gonna offer my sacrifice hear this and there was an angel there i pray grace amen that god honors and respects our our experience with him amen so that there's an angel there amen god help us help us lord that that we're not going to be forgetful that the angels of god encamp around about those that fear the lord they're there to protect you i believe that amen grace brother grace the angels are with our young people the angels of the word mom and dad amen if you've got a if you've got a faith in god oh my the angel is there to protect you grace of god help us to be conscious that no matter where we go no matter what we're doing i pray that'll be a conviction that there's an angel there with you amen and there's a picture and where it is now and i think i do have it on my computer it comes online there in a screensaver and there's a it's an accident a vehicle accident and somebody was killed and they were christian and someone took a picture and when they took the picture they noticed that in front of the vehicle was a like the form of a of a human in light standing and they said this is this is that it was a lady i think that was killed and he said this is that sister's theophany body that we believe that she's gone from there to there yeah amazing if the offending body is there your angel is there by the grace of god amen brother i pray grace that we that we won't be able to do anything without the consciousness that there's an angel with me amen that we've been born again lord we'll never ignore it we'll never forget it you want help call on the lord he'll help you he's there amen keep your motives right keep your objectives right live for god do what god wants you to do when he wants you to do it how and where he wants you to do it just follow his leadership not my will thine be done amen grace to us he said abraham's works was expressing his faith that he ending god's promise all right is your works expressing your faith i should say is our works expressing our faith amen what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it is it expressing your faith what you believe amen i tell you is anything that god's requiring in these last days and not just requiring it but he's giving us the faith that will do it and that is a total separation unto the lord amen that we're living not for the world we're living for jesus amen we believe we're in the end time we believe amen that the resurrection and the rapture is going on amen and that soon we're going to be cut off by the grace of god remember again the prophecy the rapture is already going on it's been going on for a while amen grace of god the grace that you feel the pull you feel the pull of the world or do you feel the pull of god you feel the pull of the world or the pull of heaven and it's just right there oh but i'm going to we got to go up we got to go up well we got to get in there first and then go up get in that dimension and then we'll rise to meet him amen so test your faith what is your faith doing it's not just oh i believe this and i believe that that's my faith you know you you believe what do you believe in in the resurrection do you believe in the rapture do you believe that this is going on that's going on you believe that your theophany is right there next to you as the prophet of god said he's not he's not 12 feet from you at any given time and he said the only thing the reason that he'll leave and he says sometimes if you sin or you're doing something you shouldn't have done or maybe you think you're thinking something you shouldn't think and so on and he says he'll pull away you know what that does it brings conviction yeah you're convicted amen and then when you repent and say lord forgive me he comes near you again praise the lord why because we're moving into the time of the resurrection and the rapture when you and the theophany become one amen grace of god god help us to believe it amen grace of god as i said lord help us to have the revelation of the resurrection again not like that picture i told you about that somebody painted of the resurrection and of a cemetery and you know in the in the in the painting in the painting they said oh and there was jesus coming down and and oh there was these babies coming out of their graves and there was these little young children coming out of their graves teenagers coming at their graves and grandma and grandpa coming out of their graves white hair you know and old looking and so on and they're like they're coming at their graves and going off to meet jesus and i said lord i said there's not an infant of days nor no old man that doesn't fulfill his days in in heaven no no because we're all young we're being transferred back to around 20 years old by the grace of god amen god is pulling us into that dimension for the glory of god amen so brother is your works expressing your faith what you do in this world what you do day in and day out is there is expressing your faith and again let me challenge the parents to mothers the fathers to grandmother grandfathers does does your children or your grandchildren see the reflection of god in you oh my mom and my dad my grandma and grandpa they're christians oh they they act like christians they talk like christians oh yeah they they're always they always they're always there thinking about jesus they're very conscious of his presence yeah yeah and and you know that but as as parents and as grandparents you're there to encourage your children and grandchildren talk to the lord about it i'll pray for you i'll pray for this and so on grace of god oh yeah amen and if you're and if you're a son and daughter and you're spiritual oh yeah they're gonna you're gonna reflect that to mom and dad well mom well dad i i just want to know what the will of the lord is so pray for me and pray with me for this and for that god help us spiritual amen and again like i said thank i thank the lord that i was raised in a spiritual home by the grace of god praise the lord and it says abraham remember he was 90 years old 100 years old sarah was 90 years old and now they were well stricken in age past childbearing have been many many many years and they had lived together as husband and wife since they were young and no children but yet god told him when he was 75 years old and sarah 65 god said you're going to have a baby and he believed god's promise do we believe the promise of god amen for the resurrection rapture as much as abraham believed what god promised sarah to have a son yeah amen do we believe as much as abraham believed that god would raise isaac from the dead if he sacrificed him amazing rochelle abraham brother sir he must he lived in another dimension oh he lived in faith walked in faith he just lived for god amen he just wanted to give god the glory give god the attention lord what did you want me to do lord thy will not be done not mine grace or if we could only live that way you here in this congregation and those online amen grace that we have faith but grace that we have works that express our faith amen and it's just like i said it's not it's not just water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ but it's the life you live every day amen showing that you are one with god showing that you have met god and god has met you amen showing that god has recognized your faith and give you the true baptism of the holy ghost born again i'm a new creature amen and again let's give god the glory but as i said this is another issue that when i was working in that department store many many years ago and then i noticed that a gentleman cam comes in and he had three or four children with him and then i i was near and i said oh i said good day he said yes thank you thank you and i said what's wrong with this one oh he said she's sick she's not well and they said that but they don't think that she'll ever make it to go to school i said what i said i'll pray for her oh he said good thank you and so what did i do i left the that area and i walked on into the the the other area where they go to take their breaks and so on and then i went beyond that amen to where i was i was alone and i bowed my head and prayed for the grace of god to that child amen praise the lord and i came out and he said thank you yes that's good amen and the child was looking better and feeling better oh i said wonderful praise the lord he said thank you amen and i assume that child is going on now amen maybe serving the lord that's right and again in that in another place it was a supermarket and we were there and at groceries and i came out and we were all lined up and right in front of me was a child in a in that cart and it was sick oh she said yes the mother said she's sick and i just moved closer and i prayed i said lord in the name of jesus i pray grace to heal this child amen and the lord undertook by the grace of god so brother sister what testimony are we going to leave with the people amen amen listen let's think spiritual there's too much we're taking too much natural things oh yes that's got our intentions natural natural natural natural death this this this let's talk spiritual amen amen let our works express our faith and let our faith be manifested in our works by grace amen and the angel they told a god told abraham and sarah said they're going to have a baby and he believed god's promise amen we're going into a resurrection rapture do we believe the resurrection are we really looking for the resurrection are we looking for the rapture he said see he made every he made ready everything for this baby yeah and see that's what god saw when he believed god and man saw what he did to express what he believed man sees you what you do to express the faith of the resurrection and rapture amen and that's the same thing that works tonight the same way it is with us amen it had been revealed to him so he believed it and was acting as though it had already took place and he said listen just a minute sometimes he said we misunderstand it and people gets emotion and they try to work on emotion that won't work amen what god is looking for is faith that you believe it in your heart not emotion not sensation not failings but faith amen trying to skip some of this he's talking about a problem with a boy and he said little boy that never walked would try to walk down this aisle again he would fall down a dozen times and be wore out before he got there but anybody who knows how to walk an athlete would walk right down that aisle and never even notice doing it well he had that to start with and that's what he is now he said well that's the way with preaching divine healing and he said as you go along you begin to learn and if you don't learn there's something wrong he said you've got to learn amen surely you've learned something from the ministry through the preaching of the word amen pray the grace of god that's through the ministry of our brother jonathan that we're we're learning and we're hallelujah we're getting a greater and a greater revelation of faith amen faith and he says you've got to learn how to accept god and what it really means you got to learn how to accept yes salvation redemption the healing amen the resurrection the rapture amen get into the word to know what it means amen and that's the thing that that will control your thoughts your words your deeds everything you're living looking for the rapture looking for the resurrection oh lord in the name of jesus bring the resurrection see we gotta be calling for it as luther was calling for justification then they called for sanctification amen the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost so what are we calling for we're calling for the resurrection we're calling for the rapture because that's the next thing in line for god amen grace to us amen he says the same way with preaching divine healing and he said as you go along you begin to learn again we what are we learning not not doctrine oh i learned this doctrine the the the the of the godhead and the doctrine of water baptism the doctrine of this the doctrine of that brother we need to get more and more into the revelation of the resurrection we need to think think more and more about the resurrection think more and more with the rapture i'll tell you if we're if we got the baptism of the holy ghost that we won't we won't in our hearts we won't forget it there's no way that we'll be able to live a day without thinking about the resurrection of rapture no no they couldn't luther couldn't forget justification the others couldn't forget saying the the pentecostals they couldn't forget it the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit morning noon and night that's all they were praying for calling on the lord screaming out amen worshiping amen to find a lot of them began to speak with tongs and this and that that and again there's nothing wrong with that like brother brown said that god didn't take the gift of thumbs away he said he just laid it on the shelf so he says there he said if you if you need it it's there if you want it and so on and so brother now it's moving on what are we calling for and but again that was my luther's revival john wesley's revival the salvation army revival the pentecostal revival oh my but then there's a bride revival but the prophet of god said it's not he said well he said the broad revival is not going to be like that like the methodists like the lutherans no no or like the pentecostal no now the bride revive is going to be different it's not feelings it's faith amen it's not god oh my god doing this god doing that always god changing us from time to eternity amen getting our attention away from the flesh and into the spirit by the grace of god oh yeah brother the prophet said he said the bride revival is not going to be like these revivals no no he said the people are going to wander you know or think oh it should be like this you'd be like that no no bright revival it's not like that be still and know that i am god amen be still and experience the resurrection be stale and experience the rapture amen god was moving all the others down through the ages he was moving them on move on move on move on no now stop look up your redemption draweth not oh oh so oh we're not going on no no we're not going on go back to eternity it's the end go back where you come from amen that's what jesus did amen he went on and on and on until he came to that time in his ministry in his life not my will father thou be done because he knew to get back he said no man has ascended up only he that came down from heaven even the son of man who is in heaven that was him amen so it's theophany body that he had there it was still there and jesus was going to go back to that amen or he's going to have he's going to have that body because he got a fellowship with you and me and it was the body of jesus amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah so break grace of god that he that was it it was the end of his ministry like that he knew the price he'd have to pay to get back he'd had to lay down his life and pick it up again he had to suffer and endure much i i don't think many believers are with jesus and the fellowship of his suffering now can we stop and really consider what jesus did to redeem us what he experienced to redeem us the pain the agony the sorrow that jesus had and that he experienced in the flesh and it wasn't just for me it wasn't just for us brother it was for millions that he did it millions yeah of those that were born in sin grace of god to us thank you jesus for what you did brother if we consider what he did uh he it will humble us amen consider what he suffered for you it'll humble you god help us amen that will as he lays down for us that we're going to lay down our lives for one another amen by the grace of god amen a gift is a wonderful but you can't base your eternal destination on gifts he said you cannot major on a minor and the gift is a minor and satan can impersonate any gift that god's got and you can make something just exactly like it and he said therefore he said we got to watch it like sometimes i express that about shouting and i've been i've seen demons shout speak in tongues i've seen demons speak in tongues amen sure he impersonates it and it's a genuine but it's impersonates it if either you see it makes it looks like it's real and people sometimes he said who don't know the difference declares this to be a real when it isn't real amen is satan impersonating is satan impersonating christians impersonating believers yeah yeah he's got he's got him out there and drawing is a 19. yeah grace of god drawdry is influenced and people who sometimes don't know the difference and declare this to be real when it's not real and the same thing they do about divine healing he said they think well it's ocus pocus or something like that it isn't it's a genuine all adulterated fate in what god said to be the truth amen and when it anchors he said there's nothing going to move it it's going to stay there i tell you it didn't move abraham's faith no siree he believed god at 75 years old he believed god at 100 years old oh yeah his faith in god brother he lived for god and amen when he was 75 he lived for god when he was a hundred he listened to god when he was 75 he listened to god when he was a hundred i pray grace that we keep listening to the lord and we become more and more spiritual i'll have to finish right here somewhere he said faith is a revelation from god and faith is a revelation there's where i want to stay just a moment he said it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you never have you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of god yeah you got faith faith for salvation faith for healing faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture god give it to us amen and god reveals it to you and therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon the revelation amen brother is is not natural in our heads or in our natural ears lit in that earth an ear one here it's in your soul hear what the spirit is saying to the churches hear what spirit is saying to you amen praise the lord that's like in the ministry of the word those that are they're using these ears oh they hear this they hear that but then there's the one led into death in the ear oh did you hear this hear what oh hear this oh i didn't know if he said that oh yes i caught i caught the revelation when he said it yeah where's the person that's just listening to the ears they don't catch it but if they listen to the ear of the soul or they'll catch it well they'll see what the others don't see they hear what the others don't hear amen by the grace of god amen because why it's spiritual by the grace of god amen and he goes back to start with abel by faith abel by faith revelation amen remember there was no bible written in those days but he said able by faith believed god had given him a revelation of redemption just thinking cain refused it cain didn't think he had to go do it that way oh yeah that's like there are those that looking maybe some that believe in a resurrection believe in a rapture but they don't think that we got to go this way to get the rapturing faith and the resurrection faith they don't think that we got to leave denominational churches and we got to do this we got to find the prophet and and hear his message and believe the message to get resurrection right no no they don't think that they think well god's going to do it yeah but they don't recognize what god's doing or the way he's going to do it all god will give us is god to give us that yeah and he's done it through the prophet no we don't believe that he wasn't the truth they feel he wasn't the true prophet oh my the negative things that are on on the internet concerning william branham oh he couldn't preach he couldn't do this he couldn't do that no maybe they felt jesus the same way yeah but look what he did he conquered death hell in the grave amen and not only that praise the name of the lord william bradley come and look what he did the victory that jesus purchased paid for was manifested giving us victory over the world the flesh the devil amen over death hell and the grave because we need it now we need it amen they didn't need it in luther's day wesley's day they had that faith to take them on on on into glory or into into that dimension when they died but now there is a generation that needs the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture amen god help us to believe and he said by faith abel it was revelation and there was no bible written in those days by abel by faith offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that which came which god testified he was righteous and how he said god testified by faith it was his faith was his righteousness that god saw amen and abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to him that it wasn't the fruits of the field it was the blood amen that caused the fall and blood would redeem us amen oh yes it was blood blood was shed amen considering what what eve did oh yeah she shed blood grace of god and this woman that's on the internet there and talking about she was raised in in william brown's message and raised this way in the church and she left it and she talked about the oh yeah she said oh they tried to tell us that oh there's no such thing as a trinity well we're not denying the trinity we're denying the personage of the trinity they're trying to say it's three persons no no it's just one person yeah and he he came in in in the father he came in the son they came in the holy ghost but it's just one person by the grace of god but she she was finding fought with this finding fault with that oh yeah they teach this they teach that and so on yeah and she highlighted the trinity and she liked it just maybe a few other things oh yeah concerning what happened in the garden of eden and she laughed at it she tried to teach she said this is what happened in the garden of eden and she was laughing one day god laugh at her yeah because her spirit is not right please let's have respect for god let's have respect for the message amen just have respect for what god is doing in our lives by the grace of god amen grace he says he said by faith and he said how is that by revelation abel offered the more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to him that it wasn't the fruits of the field it was the blood amen it's revealed to us that it's not denominations no it's the reveal word by the holy ghost amen and that's why he said some people can believe it and some cannot believe it he said some try to make believe it god help us and he said there's some that's trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it and all others he said it's just by grace given to them and there is a difference and he said that's the real revelation because faith is a revelation from god and it must be revealed first amen praise the name of the lord amen god help us that we have a true holy ghost faith by the grace of god amen and faith we manifest that faith through our works and in our world the life we live is a reflection of the faith that god has given us it's not religion it's not something the church gives us it's something that god has given us by the grace of god help us lord to go on by faith amen go on keep moving as god reveals it keep doing it amen stay in the spirit by the grace of god amen god bless us let's stand and let's sing my father's house 261 for brother matthew and we'll turn to our brother bob so grace again to understand that it is god's looking for faith that's right but god's looking for a real genuine faith that is going to be reflected in the works we do that's going to control the works we do going to control the life we live amen so you're going to be spiritual like i said you're going to be spiritual in your home spiritual in your job spiritually you're with family friends or neighbors be spiritual by the grace
