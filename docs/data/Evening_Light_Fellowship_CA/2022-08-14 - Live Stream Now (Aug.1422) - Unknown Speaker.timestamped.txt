[52:35] and we consider that it was in 1948 when
[52:39] the angel of god appeared to the prophet
[52:42] and commissioned him he was ordained to
[52:44] do this he's ordained to do that and so
[52:46] on
[52:47] brother and what for it was to the
[52:49] calling out of that gentile bride by the
[52:52] grace of god but finally everything
[52:54] would go back to the jews amen
[52:58] it would leave the prophet leave the
[53:00] gentiles
[53:01] and go back to the jews when god is
[53:03] finished with you and me god is finished
[53:05] with us and just saying 1948 that's when
[53:08] the angel came down to the prophet it
[53:10] was in 1948 was was that the world was
[53:13] beginning to recognize that
[53:15] the the the jewish nation
[53:17] amen
[53:18] israel oh yes
[53:20] so brothers just show that it was god
[53:22] with the prophet it was god yes god with
[53:25] the gentiles it was god with the jews
[53:27] god with the gentiles he was ordaining a
[53:29] prophet amen to bring forth and restore
[53:33] what god had ordained amen in the
[53:35] scriptures to give us the faith to get
[53:37] out of here amen and also
[53:40] god promised to go back to the jews amen
[53:43] and restore the jews to god be the glory
[53:46] so it's like somebody one time and there
[53:49] was a certain church they belong to
[53:51] denominational church
[53:53] but recognizing my ministry and and some
[53:57] of the things that we were preaching and
[53:58] teaching
[53:59] and he just said brother i just want to
[54:02] ask you a question concerning israel
[54:04] and he said what is god doing with
[54:08] israel
[54:09] and why is this happening to israel why
[54:11] is that happening to israel and so on
[54:14] they said you wanted to understand you
[54:17] know would the jews come to the
[54:18] revelation of jesus come to the
[54:20] revelation of of christianity and so on
[54:23] and i said oh yes i said god's going to
[54:25] close down the gentiles gentiles and
[54:28] he's going back to the jews and brothers
[54:30] 1948 when god ordained a prophet to come
[54:34] to the gentiles with the revealed word
[54:37] to give us the faith we need for the
[54:39] resurrection for the rapture amen at the
[54:42] time brother god was restoring israel
[54:44] back
[54:46] amen to get the world to recognize
[54:49] israel
[54:50] by the grace of god amen
[54:52] so there's things that we could get in
[54:54] there and show you what god was doing in
[54:56] 1948 among some certain jews and show
[54:59] you what god was doing in 1948 among the
[55:02] gentiles amen god was getting to close
[55:04] down the gentile dispensation amen he
[55:07] was getting to renew the jewish
[55:09] dispensation amen praise the name of the
[55:12] lord because hey brother it's all
[55:14] promises here in the word of god well
[55:16] yeah this the bible says god's going to
[55:18] do this god's going to do that brother c
[55:20] this is this wonderful book thank god
[55:23] for the revelation amen of genesis to
[55:26] revelation but in the beginning god
[55:29] started his plan
[55:30] he had a plan he had a purpose and he
[55:33] had a pattern amen it's not just
[55:36] accidental oh
[55:38] well i created man but the devil got in
[55:41] there and oh it caused me in the fall
[55:44] well if i tell you this he the devil
[55:46] wouldn't have done it without god god
[55:47] allowing it
[55:48] amen but god created this great created
[55:52] this but he knew what was going to
[55:53] happen so he permitted it
[55:55] because he wanted to reveal himself
[55:58] amen reveal his nature reveal his
[56:01] character amen and also to bring out
[56:03] your nature and your character amen to
[56:06] really love him
[56:08] for himself amen not to just say oh
[56:12] i want jesus because he uh i was a
[56:14] sinner he saved me no no it's gotta be
[56:16] based on love
[56:18] love is thou me more than these
[56:21] amen so i pray the grace of god amen
[56:24] that's what god's bringing it in your
[56:25] heart considering what god has done for
[56:27] you and is doing for you and what god
[56:29] will do brother what's to do what's it
[56:32] bringing out it's bringing out a
[56:33] relationship of love
[56:35] amen you love him
[56:37] he loves you by the grace of god
[56:40] see god in the genesis when he in the
[56:43] beginning god created this created that
[56:46] he had a purpose he had a pattern he had
[56:48] a plan
[56:49] nothing is accidental just god did it oh
[56:52] that old devil he got in there look what
[56:54] he did look what i got to do now well
[56:56] god knew that before it happened
[56:59] god god god was going to permit it he
[57:02] knew when he when he created man when he
[57:04] created the heaven and the earth and he
[57:06] created even when he created the angels
[57:08] oh yeah in heaven the devil was one of
[57:11] them
[57:12] and god knew what the devil would do
[57:15] because the bible says because satan he
[57:17] said you walked up and down in the coals
[57:19] of fire
[57:20] you walked there you walked there oh
[57:22] yeah he was one of those covering
[57:23] cherubs
[57:24] in glory amen but again he fell
[57:28] and again god permitted it for a reason
[57:32] and now brother that was the beginning
[57:34] but now we're in the end amen and
[57:38] like i said considering the word of god
[57:41] faith comes by hearing the word amen
[57:43] amen
[57:44] by hearing the word of god and i said
[57:47] well look at the faith that the word
[57:48] gave to the devil
[57:50] so what's what kind of faith has it
[57:51] given you
[57:53] we gave the devil faith yeah because the
[57:55] bible says satan has come down with
[57:57] great wrath knowing
[58:00] and i already know it by the word
[58:03] knowing his time is short
[58:05] well brother if he's coming up with
[58:07] great wrath we ought to look up with
[58:09] great love
[58:10] amen knowing that we're we've come to
[58:13] the end of time amen and we're moving on
[58:16] into the resurrection the rapture amen
[58:18] praise the lord brothers and sisters
[58:20] understand this
[58:22] again
[58:24] don't think that oh well all those evil
[58:27] ones are going to be put into the lake
[58:28] of fire and they're going to be there
[58:30] for eternity no they're going to spend
[58:32] their time
[58:34] in the lake that burneth with fire and
[58:36] brimstone amen oh yeah
[58:39] so again we were all we were for years
[58:41] we were understood that hell was eternal
[58:44] well no no l is not eternal
[58:47] no
[58:47] there's going to be an end to it and the
[58:49] scriptures there to prove that
[58:51] oh yeah or they'll have their time
[58:55] and their time in the lake that burns
[58:57] with fire and brimstone
[58:59] amen
[59:00] brother so but by the grace of god the
[59:03] seed of god or they're not going there
[59:05] they're going to eternity we could go to
[59:07] revel the book of revelation and bring
[59:09] out those things
[59:10] amen thank god praise the lord brother
[59:14] there when it comes to his sons and his
[59:16] daughters now there's none of them going
[59:18] to be lost
[59:19] no
[59:20] and why because god the bible says god's
[59:22] not willing that any should perish
[59:24] amen it's because god what god give a
[59:27] good man a choice in the beginning god's
[59:29] given us a choice right on down through
[59:31] the ages
[59:32] choose you this day whom you will serve
[59:35] amen
[59:36] i was going to bring some thoughts on
[59:38] leadership so choose this day
[59:41] who will lead you
[59:44] yeah choose this day the anointing that
[59:46] will lead you
[59:47] choose this day concerning the thoughts
[59:49] and the ideas that's going to lead you
[59:51] and control you brother because i tell
[59:54] you there's not one of the earth but
[59:56] amen there's some power there's some
[59:58] anointing there's some thoughts that are
[1:00:00] that that's that's leading them
[1:00:03] why are you doing what you do today why
[1:00:05] are you here today it's a choice and you
[1:00:08] why you're oh well i made a choice to do
[1:00:10] this yes but it was leadership
[1:00:13] amen
[1:00:14] is either god's leadership or the
[1:00:16] devil's leadership
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:19] and remember again satan is religious
[1:00:21] but he's not spiritual
[1:00:23] amen so we pray the grace of god we're
[1:00:25] spiritual and following god's leadership
[1:00:28] amen not satan's leadership but god's
[1:00:30] leadership
[1:00:31] amen so the lord bless us as we get into
[1:00:34] the word and pray the grace of god be
[1:00:36] with us and give us a greater and
[1:00:38] greater understanding concerning
[1:00:40] leadership amen
[1:00:42] and oh yes let's make our calling and
[1:00:45] election sure
[1:00:46] to make your calling election sure
[1:00:48] you've got to make sure the leadership
[1:00:50] you're under
[1:00:51] amen praise the name of the lord so what
[1:00:54] leadership brought you here oh well i
[1:00:57] believe god brought me here i hope it
[1:00:59] was
[1:00:59] if your motive is right your objective
[1:01:01] is right god brought you here amen but
[1:01:04] your motive is not exactly the way it
[1:01:06] should be and your objectives are not in
[1:01:08] life and not the way that it should be
[1:01:11] it's not god it's satan
[1:01:13] oh
[1:01:14] just don't because why
[1:01:16] because
[1:01:17] i tell you this there's there's three
[1:01:19] kinds of believers
[1:01:21] there's the unbeliever the main believer
[1:01:24] and the believer
[1:01:25] and the prophet of god said there he
[1:01:27] said they're in the same church
[1:01:30] he said it when he said when the doors
[1:01:32] were open he said that
[1:01:34] he said they're coming to the church
[1:01:37] so i pray god we're believers
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:40] not make believers
[1:01:42] definitely not unbelievers so god help
[1:01:44] us to be true holy ghost filled
[1:01:46] believers amen believing the word
[1:01:49] believing the promise of god believing
[1:01:51] the oh yes we believe the plan of god
[1:01:54] the pattern of god and the purpose of
[1:01:56] god
[1:01:56] so is god working out his purpose in
[1:01:59] your life
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:02] now satan oh yeah satan can you he'll
[1:02:05] bring you to religion and bring religion
[1:02:07] to you
[1:02:09] and he'll make you feel that you're
[1:02:10] you're you're you're good and you're
[1:02:12] religious and so on no we want to be
[1:02:14] spiritual
[1:02:16] we want we want to have a relationship
[1:02:17] with god
[1:02:18] amen we want to express our love for god
[1:02:21] and we want to experience god's love for
[1:02:23] us
[1:02:24] by the grace of god amen so the lord
[1:02:26] help us as we go into the word again
[1:02:28] today concerning leadership and trusting
[1:02:30] that we're under god's leadership not
[1:02:33] satan's leadership
[1:02:34] because satan can deceive you to the
[1:02:36] point you think make you believe you're
[1:02:38] under god's leadership but you're under
[1:02:40] what well you're under god all right but
[1:02:42] not the god not not our heavenly father
[1:02:46] but the god of this world
[1:02:48] and that's the devil
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:51] why because satan is satan god is
[1:02:54] influencing the churches satan is
[1:02:56] influencing government satan is
[1:02:57] influencing man yes exactly that's why
[1:03:00] they can go over and they live this and
[1:03:02] do this oreo and still think they're
[1:03:04] christians but not consider
[1:03:06] lining up with the word

[1:03:10] so does the devil
[1:03:12] oh i believe in jesus so does the devil
[1:03:15] oh yeah so much said who was the one
[1:03:18] that met jesus on the mountain it was
[1:03:20] satan
[1:03:21] oh yeah he tempted him
[1:03:23] do this do this do this
[1:03:25] amen he knew that jesus could do it
[1:03:28] but he knew it wasn't it wasn't the will
[1:03:30] of god he was tempting jesus to do
[1:03:33] something contrary to the will of god
[1:03:35] and brothers he works on he works on
[1:03:37] many today amen and he works on you
[1:03:40] works on me what for they get us to do
[1:03:43] something that's contrary to the will of
[1:03:44] god
[1:03:45] oh yeah we'll still believe we're
[1:03:47] christian still we believe that oh we're
[1:03:49] the seed of god and so on but then go
[1:03:52] over and do this go to do that and it's

[1:14:15] so that ye should earnestly contend
[1:14:18] for the faith
[1:14:21] which was once delivered unto the saints
[1:14:24] not a form of godliness amen not by any
[1:14:27] means

[1:14:40] not just thinking well well just wait in
[1:14:42] the lord to do this the lord do that no

[1:14:50] going to thirst for the things of god
[1:14:53] and you will be filled amen amen
[1:14:56] and it says for there are certain men
[1:14:59] crept in unawares
[1:15:01] who were before of old ordained to this
[1:15:06] condemnation
[1:15:08] ungodly men
[1:15:10] turning the grace of our god into
[1:15:13] lasciviousness
[1:15:14] and denying the only lord god and our
[1:15:18] lord jesus christ
[1:15:20] amen
[1:15:21] religious but yet not spiritual
[1:15:24] amen we want to be spiritual
[1:15:27] amen if you've got a religious spirit
[1:15:29] let's move on till we become more and
[1:15:31] more spiritual in our relationship with
[1:15:33] god
[1:15:34] more and more spiritual in our
[1:15:36] relationship with one another amen
[1:15:39] so we're not dealing with religious
[1:15:41] people we're dealing with spiritual
[1:15:43] sons and daughters of god
[1:15:45] and it says turning it says turning the
[1:15:47] grace of our god into retributiousness
[1:15:50] and denying the only lord god and our
[1:15:53] lord jesus christ
[1:15:54] amen this is make believers
[1:15:57] and he said i will therefore
[1:15:59] put you in remembrance
[1:16:02] though ye once knew this
[1:16:05] now that the lord having saved the
[1:16:07] people
[1:16:08] out of the land of egypt
[1:16:10] afterward
[1:16:12] destroyed them that believe not
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:16] thinking maybe that god would save them
[1:16:18] all
[1:16:19] but brother he brought them out
[1:16:22] yes
[1:16:24] and in the wilderness he proved who was
[1:16:26] sincere
[1:16:28] he proved he was true seed and who was
[1:16:30] not true seed amen
[1:16:33] and after he brought them out
[1:16:36] he destroyed them that believed not
[1:16:39] but brother he brought out their
[1:16:41] unbelief before he destroyed them
[1:16:44] god's not going to bring you up just
[1:16:45] just kill you no no no no god's going to
[1:16:48] bring out what's in you
[1:16:49] he's going to put you to the test and
[1:16:51] he's you're you're going to go through
[1:16:53] this test you're going to go through
[1:16:54] that test amen in the life that you live
[1:16:57] praise the lord brother i tell you this
[1:16:59] when i first came to the to the lord as
[1:17:02] i said it was in a in a salvation army
[1:17:04] church in my hometown of gamble and as i
[1:17:07] said i was i was sitting in in in a pew
[1:17:10] and there was
[1:17:12] some sisters behind me and one of them
[1:17:13] was my mother and uh of course she was a
[1:17:16] christian and there was also another
[1:17:17] sister there and i always remember her
[1:17:20] amen and of course she looked down and
[1:17:23] she saw me and she and she sensed that i
[1:17:26] was i was crying a man i was just a
[1:17:29] young boy and i was crying and and oh
[1:17:32] just crawling and calling on the lord
[1:17:33] and i remember now that she just reached
[1:17:35] down and she touched me on the shoulder
[1:17:38] and and then i i thought maybe it might
[1:17:40] have been my mother i turned around it
[1:17:41] was her and she said gerald i said yes
[1:17:44] she said son she said go to the altar
[1:17:48] she said you need to go to the altar
[1:17:50] i said thank you okay amen i went to the
[1:17:53] altar amen and i laid down there by the
[1:17:56] altar and i cried and i prayed and cried
[1:17:58] and prayed amen oh yeah and and the
[1:18:01] audience in the congregation everywhere
[1:18:03] they were singing and singing and
[1:18:04] singing praising the lord amen until
[1:18:07] finally i got up and i stood there and
[1:18:09] with my hands raised and the clergy
[1:18:11] looked down he said son he said what
[1:18:13] happened to you he said what did you do
[1:18:16] i said thank god he said i said brother
[1:18:18] i said thank god i said i'm saved and he
[1:18:20] said wonderful he said praise the lord
[1:18:22] amen and they all began to worship and
[1:18:24] praise the lord amen so that was many
[1:18:27] many many years ago i guess it might it
[1:18:30] might have been maybe uh yes over 60
[1:18:32] years ago it was that long i said yes
[1:18:35] that long amen because at that time we
[1:18:38] were still living in that in that town
[1:18:39] of gamble amen it was in 1960 that we
[1:18:42] moved out and moved in here to st john's
[1:18:45] the family and so on so by ever since
[1:18:48] i've been growing and maturing sure i've
[1:18:50] fallen i've got up again and moved on
[1:18:53] fall and get up again amen but you're
[1:18:55] getting closer to the lord
[1:18:57] amen amen amen amen as it is in natural
[1:19:01] relationships with children and parents
[1:19:03] amen well yeah
[1:19:05] oh yeah if the mom and dad is going to
[1:19:07] correct you you're going to get closer
[1:19:08] not further away
[1:19:10] oh it brings you together amen because
[1:19:12] mom and dad is concerned and they want
[1:19:14] you to do this they want you to do that
[1:19:16] because why they they're concerned they
[1:19:18] they want you to to be good amen amen
[1:19:22] and knowing that if you did this did
[1:19:24] this god bless you amen through god be
[1:19:27] the glory
[1:19:28] praise the lord amen so it's a long time
[1:19:31] ago over 60 years ago but i gave god the
[1:19:34] glory that i'm still here
[1:19:36] after all this time that brother journal
[1:19:39] would be still here and then maybe the i
[1:19:41] guess i'd assume i'm the oldest here in
[1:19:42] this assembly
[1:19:44] hard to believe
[1:19:46] yeah it is hard to believe because i
[1:19:47] always thought that
[1:19:49] that brother over there was the oldest
[1:19:50] that when i s in central newfoundland
[1:19:53] oh brother cater
[1:19:55] he's the oldest no or brother emmanuel

[1:20:05] amen where am i now brother let's let's
[1:20:08] look up
[1:20:10] amen i tell you even it's hard to

[1:20:15] ones that i minister to as young boys
[1:20:17] and girls amen you're getting old now
[1:20:20] yeah
[1:20:21] sorry
[1:20:23] but that's it's a reality you've got to
[1:20:24] face where's our brother jonathan here
[1:20:27] like i said when he was two years old
[1:20:28] sitting on that chair in in the church
[1:20:30] and i was preaching to him amen or or
[1:20:33] our brother matthew here and and and oh
[1:20:35] my just consider the the children here
[1:20:38] that i dedicated

[1:20:43] time
[1:20:44] well let's tell you this we're getting
[1:20:45] out of time into eternity
[1:20:48] please in the name of jesus don't take
[1:20:50] your don't take your age for granted
[1:20:52] thank god
[1:20:54] amen thank god that you're here thank
[1:20:56] god you're believing the word amen thank
[1:20:59] god that we have these young people here
[1:21:00] and like i said i bet we've had an uh
[1:21:02] sometimes a number of visiting ministers
[1:21:05] they come and minister for us and and
[1:21:07] they're they were surprised to see these
[1:21:09] young people here oh yeah and they they
[1:21:12] reminded me of it this is this is
[1:21:14] amazing he said to see this many young
[1:21:16] people in this church said yeah well he
[1:21:18] said thank the lord he said amen because
[1:21:22] those preachers have been to many
[1:21:23] churches and maybe even big churches and
[1:21:25] and not even not see very many young
[1:21:27] people amen but thank god for what he's
[1:21:29] done in their arts and what he's doing
[1:21:31] in their lives amen
[1:21:34] to god be the glory that he'll keep
[1:21:35] working through the ministry that he'll
[1:21:37] keep working through mom and dad and
[1:21:38] grandma grandpa amen to god be the glory
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:43] god help us brother
[1:21:46] that by the grace of god he god as he
[1:21:48] did when it comes to in israel and egypt
[1:21:50] he brought him out but destroyed them
[1:21:52] that believe not brother
[1:21:55] and i know that over the years there's
[1:21:56] many as that many started out
[1:21:59] but went back
[1:22:01] yeah
[1:22:02] they went back as i said when i was in a
[1:22:04] in a church an altar call was made and
[1:22:07] then there was a lot came up to the
[1:22:09] church
[1:22:10] and i noticed this elderly couple there
[1:22:12] and it was to two sisters and i said oh
[1:22:14] lord i said i said they need they need
[1:22:17] the holy ghost they don't have the holy
[1:22:18] spirit
[1:22:20] i said lord they don't get the holy
[1:22:21] spirit i said that they're not to stay
[1:22:23] with the word and they didn't
[1:22:25] they went back to the world
[1:22:27] all at the time they might have been
[1:22:29] maybe in their 30s or maybe 40s they're
[1:22:31] not sure how old they were
[1:22:32] but they did go back to the world
[1:22:35] so i pray god that we have the holy
[1:22:36] ghost the holy ghost brings us to the
[1:22:39] word the holy ghost keeps us in the word
[1:22:41] and the holy ghost is there to make the
[1:22:43] make us one with the word
[1:22:44] amen amen that's why the bible tells us
[1:22:48] that sons and daughters of god are led
[1:22:50] by the spirit of god amen sorry to keep
[1:22:53] you standing
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:55] but verse 6 and the angels which kept
[1:22:58] not their first estate
[1:23:00] amen but left their own habitation he
[1:23:02] has reserved in everlasting chains under
[1:23:05] darkness under the judgment of the great
[1:23:08] day amen
[1:23:10] even as sodom and gomorrah and the
[1:23:12] cities above them in the in like manner
[1:23:15] giving themselves over to fornication
[1:23:17] and going after strange flesh and sent
[1:23:20] forth for an example
[1:23:22] suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
[1:23:25] amazing
[1:23:27] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:23:30] defile the flesh despise dominion and
[1:23:33] speak evil
[1:23:35] of dignities or the glorified ones
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:40] grace
[1:23:41] and yet michael the archangel when
[1:23:43] contending with the devil
[1:23:45] he disputed about the body of moses
[1:23:48] durst not bring against him a rallying
[1:23:50] accusation but said the lord rebuked
[1:23:53] thee
[1:23:54] but these
[1:23:56] speak evil of those things which they
[1:23:58] know not
[1:23:59] but what they know naturally as brute
[1:24:02] beasts in those things they corrupt
[1:24:04] themselves
[1:24:06] grace to us
[1:24:07] amen and woe unto them for they have
[1:24:11] gone in the way of cain
[1:24:13] and ran greedily after the heir of
[1:24:15] balaam
[1:24:17] for reward
[1:24:18] and perished in the gain saying of cora
[1:24:22] god bless his word you may be seated
[1:24:36] what is the way of cain
[1:24:40] the way of cain is religious but not
[1:24:42] spiritual
[1:24:44] because remember he offered he offered
[1:24:46] unto god as well as like abel offered
[1:24:49] offered us unto god a sacrifice
[1:24:52] and cain offered sacrifice but
[1:24:56] abel's was well pleasing to the lord
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] but not cain
[1:25:02] why
[1:25:03] because abel offered the lamb a bleeding
[1:25:05] lamb just think but king just offered
[1:25:08] the fruits of the field the things that
[1:25:09] he grew
[1:25:11] so
[1:25:12] one was based on religion and the other
[1:25:14] one was based on the holy spirit
[1:25:16] amen one was based on you know religious
[1:25:19] ideas intellect whereas the other one
[1:25:21] was based on spiritual revelation
[1:25:24] because the bible says it is by faith
[1:25:26] that abel offered unto god a more
[1:25:28] excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:25:30] amen by faith
[1:25:33] amen it was revealed to abel why because
[1:25:35] this is why abel well where did he get
[1:25:37] to
[1:25:38] maybe
[1:25:39] maybe adam and eve when they came out of
[1:25:41] the garden maybe they just told
[1:25:43] cain and abel exactly later on as they
[1:25:46] got older maybe they told them exactly
[1:25:48] what what what happened they were in the
[1:25:50] garden and this happened and god put him
[1:25:52] out of the garden but based on something
[1:25:55] that that abel had the faith that
[1:25:57] pleased god
[1:25:59] and he offered unto god a more excellent
[1:26:01] sacrifice and it was based on faith amen
[1:26:05] it was based on a revelation that god
[1:26:07] gave abel and abel believed it and abel
[1:26:11] obeyed it but
[1:26:13] cain
[1:26:14] well
[1:26:15] cain had out of faith but exactly he
[1:26:17] never had the perfect faith
[1:26:19] oh yeah because they according according
[1:26:21] to the faith that cain had he went and
[1:26:24] offered he went and offered the
[1:26:25] sacrifice of what he had grown in the
[1:26:26] garden amen and he felt that was an
[1:26:29] excellent sacrifice but brother when he
[1:26:31] went over and saw and he saw what abel
[1:26:34] had offered this is absolutely amazing
[1:26:37] this is absolutely amazing but not only
[1:26:39] that abel offered this but god honored
[1:26:41] it and god respected it amen but he
[1:26:45] didn't honor and he didn't respect canes
[1:26:48] and then brother it it caused cain and
[1:26:51] abel to get into it get into a fuss
[1:26:54] there and it was really it was cain
[1:26:56] fussy with abel amen but ava was taking
[1:26:59] his stand for what he did abel was
[1:27:01] taking his stand for the for the
[1:27:03] sacrifice that he made without a doubt
[1:27:05] he had some revelation there because
[1:27:07] brother just consider why cain and abel
[1:27:11] really really got into that argument and
[1:27:13] really began to frustrate one another as
[1:27:15] it were and mainly
[1:27:16] it was maybe cain for fighting the evil
[1:27:20] not able fighting cain
[1:27:21] because why because abel offered the
[1:27:23] right sacrifice and god accepted it amen
[1:27:26] and god honored it but cain oh he got
[1:27:29] really upset why in the world would god
[1:27:32] take this sacrifice of a slain lamb amen
[1:27:35] and a bleeding lamb there on the altar
[1:27:37] and here's it here's what cain offered
[1:27:39] on the altar and maybe you know
[1:27:41] well just abel just had a small altar
[1:27:44] with his lamb and here's king with a
[1:27:46] maybe a larger altar and all that a
[1:27:49] portion of all that he had grown in the
[1:27:51] field so why should the lord turn that
[1:27:54] down but received abel
[1:27:57] why because amen because one was based
[1:28:00] on faith and spirit but the other one
[1:28:03] was based on religion
[1:28:04] amen it was just based on the anointing
[1:28:07] oil the the k knew that something
[1:28:10] happened cain knew that they they were
[1:28:12] like adam and eve there but outside the
[1:28:14] garden and and oh well
[1:28:17] and adam and eve did something in and
[1:28:19] god put him out of the garden amen and
[1:28:21] man went from righteousness to
[1:28:22] unrighteousness and man went from
[1:28:25] being the holy sons and daughters of god
[1:28:27] to sinners
[1:28:28] amen and abel was responding amen
[1:28:32] responding because he knew that he
[1:28:34] needed to get back to god
[1:28:36] amen he knew he knew he needed
[1:28:38] redemption
[1:28:40] just think
[1:28:41] when you consider adam and eve and what
[1:28:43] god did for adam and eve when how god
[1:28:45] treated adam and eve and how the the
[1:28:47] fellowship that god that adam and eve
[1:28:49] had with god amen the bible says that
[1:28:51] they would gather together every in the
[1:28:53] cool of the day every evening and have
[1:28:55] fellowship with god amen until they
[1:28:58] sinned
[1:29:00] amen where was god
[1:29:02] god came looking for them
[1:29:05] where were they
[1:29:06] amen but they would based on their faith
[1:29:09] and based on on their love for god and
[1:29:11] the relationship they would god they
[1:29:13] would go and they they know they knew
[1:29:15] they knew that they would meet god there
[1:29:16] they they would have fellowship with god
[1:29:18] there and so on but
[1:29:20] amen but after sin that god wasn't there
[1:29:25] amen and then they realized oh my
[1:29:28] they realized they were naked
[1:29:30] they realized that they had sinned
[1:29:33] and they hid themselves from the lord
[1:29:35] god come looking for them
[1:29:37] amen brother god came looking for us
[1:29:40] through our lord jesus christ
[1:29:42] praise the name of the lord
[1:29:45] so brother grace i pray in the name of
[1:29:47] jesus that we're going to offer the
[1:29:49] right sacrifice
[1:29:50] onto the lord
[1:29:52] amen
[1:29:54] and brother it's not just religious
[1:29:56] because cain was religious
[1:29:58] but abel was spiritual
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:01] abel's
[1:30:02] able sacrifice was based on a spiritual
[1:30:04] revelation amen of what god had done
[1:30:07] what god was doing and what god wanted
[1:30:09] him to do amen but brother keynes was
[1:30:12] based on religion oh yes he was
[1:30:14] religious sure he was he would have been
[1:30:17] considered a very religious person and
[1:30:18] no doubt you're going you could go into
[1:30:20] other churches today and you would think
[1:30:22] maybe this church or that church oh
[1:30:23] they're very religious there and they're
[1:30:25] doing this they're doing that but is it
[1:30:26] what god requires
[1:30:29] what about what god has done what about
[1:30:30] what god is doing amen
[1:30:33] but
[1:30:34] cain rejected what god did
[1:30:37] and what god was doing in abel
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:42] yeah cain rejected that but god rejected
[1:30:45] cain
[1:30:46] so brother sister there are those that
[1:30:48] reject what god is doing in your life
[1:30:50] and they reject what god is doing in
[1:30:51] your faith amen
[1:30:54] that's the truth they'll reject that but
[1:30:57] brother sister the grace of god to show
[1:30:59] you this that god's rejecting them
[1:31:03] god never rejected what i trust by grace
[1:31:06] god's not rejecting you rejecting
[1:31:08] me and i'm rejecting our sacrifice amen
[1:31:11] that we come to offer to god today
[1:31:14] amen by the grace of almighty god
[1:31:16] amen but yet there's gonna there's gonna
[1:31:19] be millions and millions and millions
[1:31:20] out there amen that they're gathering
[1:31:22] today in in churches they're gathering
[1:31:25] in this they're gathering this way in
[1:31:26] that way amen they want to offer this
[1:31:28] sacrifice to the lord but god is
[1:31:30] rejecting it why because it's not
[1:31:33] according to his word
[1:31:35] amen is not justifying amen or what god
[1:31:39] has done what god is doing and what god
[1:31:41] will do
[1:31:42] because i tell you what what able offer
[1:31:45] testified of what god was going to do
[1:31:48] he would offer a blood sacrifice
[1:31:51] he would be made flesh and shed blood
[1:31:54] to redeem
[1:31:56] yes to redeem able back
[1:31:58] to redeem us back
[1:32:00] amen
[1:32:02] brother sister because all the way down
[1:32:04] through the old testament and they were
[1:32:05] offering the sacrifice of sacrifice of
[1:32:08] lambs and so on
[1:32:10] amen they were what they were appointing
[1:32:11] to jesus
[1:32:13] amen the sacrifice of god to redeem us
[1:32:16] back
[1:32:17] not oh yes that was just a covering for
[1:32:19] sin
[1:32:20] but what jesus did took sin away
[1:32:24] amen hallelujah just think what abel did
[1:32:28] you even that was just a covering for
[1:32:29] sin
[1:32:30] amen and what he did what they did all
[1:32:33] the way down through the jewish faith
[1:32:34] there and
[1:32:36] their faith amen their sacrifices
[1:32:39] covered their sins covered their sins
[1:32:41] but then jesus came and shedding of his
[1:32:43] blood took away sin
[1:32:45] amen hallelujah
[1:32:47] brother thank god for such a sacrifice
[1:32:51] amen do you have that sacrifice in your
[1:32:53] heart in your soul
[1:32:55] the sacrifice of the life of our lord
[1:32:57] jesus christ testifying that he laid his
[1:33:00] life down he picked it up again come
[1:33:02] back and share that life with you and me
[1:33:04] amen
[1:33:06] see now when it comes to the old
[1:33:07] testament they could lay the life of a
[1:33:09] lamb down but that the life of that lamb
[1:33:11] wouldn't come back to you
[1:33:13] no no god would honor you and respect
[1:33:15] you amen for what you did amen but
[1:33:18] giving you more faith to keep pressing
[1:33:20] on
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:22] because when when god
[1:33:24] made his sacrifice in our lord jesus
[1:33:26] christ he amen he shed his blood he laid
[1:33:29] his life down and he called josiah and
[1:33:32] he and and he came back to share the
[1:33:33] life with
[1:33:34] you hallelujah
[1:33:37] oh hallelujah see by the holy ghost you
[1:33:40] you've got and we've got the life of the
[1:33:42] sacrifice
[1:33:44] amen he's there to bear witness
[1:33:47] the price is paid
[1:33:49] he's there to bear witness the blood was
[1:33:51] shed
[1:33:52] amen it was perfect blood it was shed
[1:33:56] brother and not just to cover our sins
[1:33:58] take away our sin
[1:34:00] oh
[1:34:01] amen take away our sin to the extent
[1:34:04] that the bible says that god doesn't
[1:34:05] know anything about it
[1:34:07] oh glory
[1:34:08] oh this is tremendous that brother
[1:34:10] according to your faith that god can
[1:34:12] look down and the devil will say look
[1:34:14] they did this they did that god said
[1:34:16] what i don't see nothing what
[1:34:19] no i don't see anything
[1:34:22] not not in that one no he sees you as a
[1:34:24] perfect son and daughter of god
[1:34:27] oh god give us that faith
[1:34:29] please lord increase our faith amen
[1:34:32] brother sister listen we got to have
[1:34:33] that faith to get out of time and into
[1:34:35] eternity
[1:34:36] we got to have that faith to get back
[1:34:38] home
[1:34:39] amen to be with the lord to be with the
[1:34:41] saints of god amen that are gone on and
[1:34:44] they're waiting for us amen and again
[1:34:47] this is why the product of god said he
[1:34:49] said they are waiting on us and god is
[1:34:51] waiting on us for the resurrection and
[1:34:53] the rapture what for to come to that
[1:34:56] faith oh yeah brother the saints of god
[1:34:58] all done through the ages as it were and
[1:35:01] after our lord jesus christ for the last
[1:35:03] 2000 years brother they laid down their
[1:35:05] lives believing in the resurrection
[1:35:08] we're going to lay our life down but
[1:35:09] praise the lord we're going to he's
[1:35:11] going to raise us back up
[1:35:13] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:18] brother that's what they believe
[1:35:20] but then there's another generation
[1:35:22] rising that god has given us to pay
[1:35:24] for the rapture
[1:35:26] and the dead in christ are waiting for
[1:35:29] us to come to that faith
[1:35:31] the dead in christ are waiting for us
[1:35:33] what for why because when we get that
[1:35:35] faith of the resurrection and we get
[1:35:37] that faith in the rapture amen in the
[1:35:39] hour that we're living
[1:35:41] brother as i said back down through the
[1:35:43] ages
[1:35:45] as they went through with justification
[1:35:48] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:50] and so on and to finally write it right
[1:35:52] at the end amen today was the revealed
[1:35:55] word to give us resurrection and
[1:35:56] rapturing faith amen they had the faith
[1:35:59] for justification sanctification the
[1:36:01] baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of
[1:36:03] the spirit amen to finally we're going
[1:36:05] on to eternity
[1:36:07] well praise the lord hallelujah say
[1:36:09] brother see that's why god started with
[1:36:11] eternity as it were but man sin put us
[1:36:14] in time god we got we got trapped in
[1:36:16] time amen but god
[1:36:19] had provided the plan of redemption
[1:36:22] amen to get us out of time back to
[1:36:24] eternity and brother when our lord jesus
[1:36:27] christ came what was he doing hallelujah
[1:36:30] he was hallelujah he what what he what
[1:36:33] he worked out he worked in
[1:36:36] amen praise the lord and now what he
[1:36:39] worked in he's working out
[1:36:41] to return to eternal life
[1:36:44] praise the lord amen god got a plan god
[1:36:47] got a purpose god got a pattern so
[1:36:49] brother through our lord jesus christ he
[1:36:51] began this to bring us back
[1:36:53] oh yeah after the fall in the garden oh
[1:36:56] well we're getting further and further
[1:36:57] and further away but then jesus came and
[1:37:00] we're getting closer
[1:37:02] getting closer back
[1:37:03] back to god back to the nature of god
[1:37:06] back from time to eternity
[1:37:09] oh we know a lot about time but whether
[1:37:11] it's getting to a place where we we
[1:37:12] won't even consider time
[1:37:15] time what time is it no
[1:37:20] matthew would have to worry there'll be
[1:37:21] no clocks
[1:37:23] no no
[1:37:24] there'll be no clocks
[1:37:26] like there's time whenever brother
[1:37:27] matthew would take the clock down
[1:37:29] yeah when we get visiting preachers here
[1:37:31] so that pressure don't have to worry
[1:37:32] about time
[1:37:36] why because he's preaching the eternal
[1:37:38] word
[1:37:42] amen oh yeah sometimes we we oh yeah
[1:37:45] we're narrowed down and narrowed down
[1:37:46] and narrowed down oh yeah so finally got
[1:37:49] to the place you know where they where
[1:37:50] they got away from the holy spirit oh my
[1:37:53] and they just had religion
[1:37:56] and to finally get into into religion
[1:37:58] and the preacher preached for a few
[1:37:59] minutes that was it
[1:38:00] yeah
[1:38:01] but i tell you every time then god sent
[1:38:03] a revival
[1:38:06] he didn't preach for a few minutes
[1:38:08] oh no
[1:38:10] he'd go on and on and on and on and on
[1:38:12] and then the next revival when they got
[1:38:14] religion and they organized oh yeah they
[1:38:16] just got down to preaching for a few
[1:38:18] minutes or half an hour or whatever and
[1:38:20] that was it but when god sent a revival
[1:38:22] come on just think
[1:38:24] that john wesley preached five times a
[1:38:26] day
[1:38:28] he did
[1:38:29] five times
[1:38:31] yeah this time when he would go to go to
[1:38:33] the mine
[1:38:34] where where the where the men were
[1:38:35] working
[1:38:36] and brother he'd be outside the mine and
[1:38:39] he preached to those that would that
[1:38:40] would that were coming to go into the
[1:38:41] mine and after after they after he
[1:38:44] preached to them and they went in then
[1:38:45] the others came out and then he preached
[1:38:47] to them
[1:38:49] oh yeah and i guess i said there's
[1:38:51] another time when he when he would go to
[1:38:53] he couldn't go into the church because
[1:38:55] the church wasn't big enough
[1:38:57] and as i said recently and what did he
[1:38:59] do to preach he he go into the he go
[1:39:01] into the the cemetery
[1:39:03] and they all gather around in the
[1:39:04] cemetery and and john wesley would stand
[1:39:07] upon upon a tombstone and preach
[1:39:10] well and he will preach for maybe a
[1:39:12] couple of hours
[1:39:14] and they all standing there
[1:39:16] praising the lord
[1:39:17] amen he did john wesley did that john
[1:39:20] wesley did it
[1:39:22] amen
[1:39:23] oh
[1:39:24] yes and again even even our even our
[1:39:27] brother william booth the the founder of
[1:39:29] the the salvation army
[1:39:32] when he was preaching and there was a
[1:39:33] time when they went and picked him up
[1:39:35] and and then
[1:39:36] they and he was he was blind
[1:39:40] physically blind
[1:39:41] and and somebody wouldn't pick no one
[1:39:43] says oh he said brother he said
[1:39:45] and he said where where have i got to go
[1:39:47] oh he said brother i got to take you
[1:39:49] over here somewhere and wherever it was
[1:39:51] and he says you got to preach he said
[1:39:52] what i got to preach
[1:39:55] yes he said they want you to minister
[1:40:00] did he study
[1:40:01] he was blind
[1:40:03] he couldn't he couldn't see physically
[1:40:06] no so they took him and they let him
[1:40:08] out to where they wanted to preach oh
[1:40:10] yeah and
[1:40:12] and he preached and preached and
[1:40:13] preached
[1:40:14] and one time he preached and he said oh
[1:40:16] and he started he started to count and
[1:40:19] he said 5 10 15 20 25 30.
[1:40:22] oh 30 30 pieces of silver he said judas
[1:40:25] sold the lord he said what have you sold
[1:40:27] them for amen
[1:40:29] he said what have you sold him for
[1:40:31] i pray god you're not going to sell
[1:40:33] jesus preeminence in your life
[1:40:37] for something that you want to do
[1:40:39] you got to follow what he wants you to
[1:40:41] do
[1:40:42] amen
[1:40:44] and brother he preached and he had again
[1:40:45] he was blind and he preached a priest
[1:40:47] and when he made an altar call like that
[1:40:49] oh
[1:40:51] he had he had maybe hundreds and
[1:40:52] hundreds in in in that building
[1:40:55] he was in and then then others would
[1:40:57] look down and say
[1:40:59] what what what's going on here
[1:41:02] why
[1:41:03] because those in the bulb in the in in
[1:41:05] in the balcony
[1:41:06] at the back
[1:41:08] they didn't go down the steps they
[1:41:10] jumped down
[1:41:11] why
[1:41:12] oh yes they just got out of their seat
[1:41:14] and they just went went to the front
[1:41:16] part there of the of the balcony and
[1:41:18] they jumped over and jumped down and ran
[1:41:20] to the altar
[1:41:22] yeah
[1:41:23] such was the conviction
[1:41:25] of the word
[1:41:27] in william booth
[1:41:29] in that hour
[1:41:33] how many of us are willing to jump down
[1:41:36] oh yeah
[1:41:40] i do
[1:41:41] say
[1:41:44] grace of god to us
[1:41:46] i remember what it was like
[1:41:50] when i was just a young boy in the
[1:41:51] salvation army
[1:41:54] oh yeah and i was under the conviction
[1:41:55] there was a time i was sitting in the
[1:41:57] front
[1:41:58] pew ran the front seat of course right
[1:42:02] right in front of me was the altar
[1:42:04] and then all of a sudden they were they
[1:42:06] were in in the the part the final part
[1:42:08] of the service and they were worshiping
[1:42:09] and praising the lord oh hallelujah
[1:42:12] praise the lord then then they begin the
[1:42:14] jericho march
[1:42:16] march
[1:42:17] they did oh yeah they all all those that
[1:42:20] they first they all gathered around the
[1:42:22] altar praising the lord their hands i
[1:42:24] can't see him now and their hands were
[1:42:26] raised up hallelujah hell yeah even from
[1:42:29] the youngest to the oldest
[1:42:31] christians that were there
[1:42:33] then
[1:42:34] then all of a sudden something does
[1:42:36] happen and then they stayed lined up
[1:42:39] and they started they started to march
[1:42:41] march
[1:42:42] oh yeah they started the march oh yeah
[1:42:45] they went went around they all
[1:42:46] went across and up up by the wall they
[1:42:49] went on out into the porch because they
[1:42:51] the porch was so big they had two two
[1:42:54] two doors
[1:42:55] and two or two aisles
[1:42:57] that you could come in to the church
[1:42:59] because it was not just these these two
[1:43:01] here there was three
[1:43:03] three sets of pews
[1:43:05] and two altars
[1:43:06] not two altars but two two aisles
[1:43:09] that and so they would they would go
[1:43:10] right down by the window and go on out

[1:43:17] on going around and around and around
[1:43:20] and singing onward christian soldiers

[1:46:26] yeah
[1:46:28] praise the lord
[1:46:34] says woe to them
[1:46:36] that have gone in the way of cain
[1:46:44] they think they're
[1:46:45] gone in the way of cain
[1:46:47] are you kane or abel
[1:46:50] oh well
[1:46:51] i'm a believer so was king
[1:46:54] cain believed god
[1:46:55] not only that
[1:46:57] cain believed god to the extent
[1:47:00] that he talked with god amen
[1:47:05] he talked with him
[1:47:07] he had fellowship with him
[1:47:11] and not only that you know he did
[1:47:14] he said oh lord
[1:47:16] he said oh you said this you said that
[1:47:18] they said oh if i go this way now
[1:47:19] they're going to kill me.
[1:47:22] and he's afraid of this afraid that the
[1:47:23] lord said it's all right i'll set a mark
[1:47:25] on you so that nobody will kill you
[1:47:29] keep your attitude right
[1:47:31] keep your spirit right toward them
[1:47:34] but that don't mean they're saved
[1:47:37] amen why you're reflecting the right
[1:47:39] attitude the right spirit but he didn't
[1:47:40] do it
[1:47:42] he didn't have the right attitude my
[1:47:43] spiritual ward abel
[1:47:46] he killed him
[1:47:48] i believe abel had a right attitude and
[1:47:50] right spirit toward kane
[1:47:54] yeah

[1:48:02] and you're under the right leadership
[1:48:05] make sure you're under holy spirit

[1:48:14] eden see
[1:48:17] god said to adam and eve this this this
[1:48:20] this
[1:48:21] and the and the enemy came and like i
[1:48:23] said the devil was the first evangelist
[1:48:29] he was oh yes he went into he went there
[1:48:32] to the garden of eden and he started to
[1:48:34] preach to adam and eve
[1:48:37] preach
[1:48:38] yes
[1:48:40] what did he say
[1:48:42] oh he said to eve he says yea as god
[1:48:45] said amen
[1:48:47] amen
[1:48:49] brother
[1:48:50] make sure you're going to preach the
[1:48:51] truth
[1:48:53] because the enemy is going to preach it
[1:48:54] and he'll head to it
[1:48:57] yes god said
[1:48:59] but forget the butts
[1:49:02] again i'll always remember brother
[1:49:05] fulcher
[1:49:06] when brother fulcher preached there
[1:49:08] and he referred to the butts
[1:49:10] he said the butts are only for goats
[1:49:14] he says for goats
[1:49:16] yeah as god said he said but
[1:49:20] now he added to the word
[1:49:23] he added to what god said
[1:49:25] and he just added one word amen
[1:49:31] and it caused the fall
[1:49:32] don't let the enemy add anything to the
[1:49:34] word that god has revealed to you in
[1:49:36] your heart
[1:49:38] amen leave it the way god said it
[1:49:41] believe it the way god said it amen take
[1:49:43] your stand for the way that god said it
[1:49:46] amen don't add to it don't take away
[1:49:48] from it don't change it just so that you
[1:49:50] you'll feel religious but you you take
[1:49:53] away the conviction
[1:49:55] yeah no no
[1:49:57] let the word convict you let the word
[1:49:58] lead you
[1:50:01] amen
[1:50:04] so again
[1:50:05] bear with me
[1:50:06] well unto them for they have gone in the
[1:50:08] way of cain
[1:50:10] and they have ran greedily after the
[1:50:12] error of balaam
[1:50:14] human reasoning
[1:50:16] is the heir of balaam
[1:50:20] doing
[1:50:22] doing it your way not god's way
[1:50:26] yeah
[1:50:28] god would say this god said that to to
[1:50:31] balaam and balaam says oh well
[1:50:33] yes but
[1:50:35] forget the butts
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:40] what is god's will for your life
[1:50:44] do what god wants you to do not what you
[1:50:45] want to do
[1:50:47] and you can be you can be religious
[1:50:49] and you can feel well well lord i don't
[1:50:52] think you'll mind this i don't think
[1:50:53] you'll mind that
[1:50:54] do you mind the lord
[1:50:58] i see it
[1:51:01] do you mind what god wants to do
[1:51:03] but the enemy is there if if if you're
[1:51:06] if you feel physically you don't want to
[1:51:08] do this or
[1:51:09] i trust the lord won't want me to do
[1:51:10] this i trust the lord won't want me to
[1:51:12] go here go do this i go there
[1:51:14] not my will thing be done
[1:51:18] how many i tell you brother
[1:51:21] how many are going to come to that place
[1:51:22] jesus came to
[1:51:24] how many under the stress and the
[1:51:26] pressure of life are going to humble
[1:51:28] themselves and say what jesus said amen
[1:51:31] oh
[1:51:32] yes just consider
[1:51:36] the choice that he had to make
[1:51:39] to lay down his life
[1:51:42] or to avoid it
[1:51:45] oh yeah
[1:51:47] he knew what he had to do
[1:51:49] when he came in flesh he knew what he
[1:51:50] had to do to redeem you and me
[1:51:54] and that's why he went when he prayed
[1:51:56] and he went back to the disciples they
[1:51:58] were dozing
[1:52:01] partly as late
[1:52:03] and he went back to them again and then
[1:52:05] finally oh yeah they were asleep he says
[1:52:08] sleep on
[1:52:09] take your rest
[1:52:11] yeah
[1:52:13] and jesus went back to the garden
[1:52:15] and he fell down and he said lord not my
[1:52:17] will thine be done
[1:52:20] if you get to go to israel sometime
[1:52:25] i trust you'll get to go up to that
[1:52:27] mountain where jesus was praying
[1:52:32] myself sister betty were there we did we
[1:52:34] go we went up
[1:52:37] to the mountain
[1:52:38] and of course there's a there's a fence
[1:52:40] there and you
[1:52:41] you're not allowed to go out around
[1:52:45] those
[1:52:46] olive trees that jesus
[1:52:48] preached
[1:52:49] by
[1:52:50] are not preached prayed
[1:52:53] yeah and one of the
[1:52:57] tour guides
[1:52:58] highlighted to say see this see these
[1:53:00] trees there yeah
[1:53:02] they said they were there when jesus was
[1:53:04] in the garden praying
[1:53:08] i said they were there oh yes he said
[1:53:12] he said they've been
[1:53:15] they've been looked after he said ever
[1:53:16] ever since
[1:53:19] and for years and years and years he
[1:53:21] said they're constantly keeping them
[1:53:24] oh yeah it's amazing
[1:53:26] but you're not allowed to go behind the
[1:53:28] fence and walk around it
[1:53:30] you can just stand by the fence and look
[1:53:32] look at it
[1:53:33] it's amazing
[1:53:37] and that's where he humbled himself not
[1:53:38] my will time be done
[1:53:40] is that your prayer
[1:53:43] is that your prayer today
[1:53:45] will that be your prayer tonight will
[1:53:46] that be your prayer tomorrow lord
[1:53:49] for the remainder of this day not my
[1:53:51] will lord thyme be done
[1:53:54] for tomorrow lord not my will thine be
[1:53:56] done
[1:53:58] amen
[1:54:02] does not mean he wants the will of god
[1:54:07] they say again i had to deal with
[1:54:10] a certain believer back years ago
[1:54:14] they were really upset
[1:54:16] concerning certain situations in their
[1:54:18] life
[1:54:19] they were only that person was only
[1:54:21] young
[1:54:24] and consulted and wanted me to pray
[1:54:27] and find the will of god i said brother
[1:54:30] i said maybe this is the will of god i
[1:54:31] said do you want that
[1:54:33] no he didn't want it
[1:54:36] i said maybe you maybe that's the will
[1:54:38] of god because you don't want it
[1:54:40] god's testing your faith
[1:54:44] to see if you humble yourself not my
[1:54:46] will father thing be done
[1:54:49] it has something to do with his job
[1:54:52] and he felt that he wouldn't it wouldn't
[1:54:54] be
[1:54:55] as prosperous if he if he could go do
[1:54:57] this and go do that it'd just be better
[1:55:00] i said well maybe the lord wants to test
[1:55:01] you with this
[1:55:05] i said are you willing to say not my
[1:55:06] will thing be done no he
[1:55:09] he didn't want that
[1:55:11] see we got our ideas
[1:55:16] but are they god's ideas
[1:55:19] is it the will of god for your life
[1:55:22] is it what god wants you to do
[1:55:27] it's like the brother said one time i
[1:55:29] maybe got it on tape somewhere where he
[1:55:30] was preaching some years ago
[1:55:33] and he said the biggest lies told are
[1:55:35] told in church
[1:55:38] by the hymns they sing
[1:55:41] and he highlighted
[1:55:43] the song a tent or a cottage why should
[1:55:45] i care
[1:55:47] they're building a mansion for me over
[1:55:49] there
[1:55:50] he said but they do care
[1:55:54] he said there's not many want the tent
[1:55:58] and they want the best they want the
[1:56:00] best cottage
[1:56:02] they want the best homes
[1:56:04] what's the will of god
[1:56:08] they want the best jobs they want this
[1:56:09] they want that what's the will of god
[1:56:12] there's things that i've had to deal
[1:56:14] with for years
[1:56:20] because
[1:56:21] as i
[1:56:23] have witnessed beginning your walk with
[1:56:26] god when you're young
[1:56:28] and
[1:56:29] regardless
[1:56:31] of what you what your choice is you you
[1:56:33] got to walk do this you got to do that
[1:56:35] what's the will of god i'll tell you
[1:56:37] there's not many young people consider
[1:56:39] the will of god
[1:56:42] when they're growing up
[1:56:44] they don't consider the will of god
[1:56:47] for their everyday living lord what is
[1:56:49] your will for their friendship
[1:56:51] and for this and for that what is your
[1:56:53] will lord
[1:56:56] well i'll thank god for that grace in my
[1:56:58] life
[1:57:02] no matter what it was the jobs that i've
[1:57:05] had
[1:57:07] lord what is your will
[1:57:10] and i'll let to be honest i didn't i
[1:57:12] turned to me i didn't go do this do this
[1:57:14] i and make this make that no no it was
[1:57:18] god's will
[1:57:24] well brother you you were this and you
[1:57:26] were that and it comes out there in the
[1:57:28] business world yes but again that wasn't
[1:57:30] me that was the lord
[1:57:36] and i started down here but if you if
[1:57:38] you stay humble
[1:57:39] he'll raise you up
[1:57:42] but stay humble you raise you up if you
[1:57:44] don't he'll put you back down
[1:57:51] so a tender cottage do you care
[1:57:54] i tell you this if you're if you're a
[1:57:56] christian you don't care
[1:57:59] lord is your will not mine
[1:58:03] they're building a mansion for me over
[1:58:04] there
[1:58:06] you just keep on going that and
[1:58:08] and god will bless you you say lord i
[1:58:10] didn't plan this thank you
[1:58:12] lord i didn't i didn't i didn't do this
[1:58:15] i didn't do it and there's those that
[1:58:16] are oh my they're the ones that are
[1:58:18] making the plans they're the ones that
[1:58:19] are trying to increase their money
[1:58:20] during their learning try to increase
[1:58:22] this increase that oh they want to want
[1:58:24] the best world and to live best
[1:58:27] no
[1:58:28] just take it one day at a time let god
[1:58:30] lead
[1:58:31] and god bless you
[1:58:33] oh yeah
[1:58:34] not my will thine be done
[1:58:39] probably god brought that out
[1:58:42] one time he was talking about certain
[1:58:44] brethren
[1:58:46] that they they wanted
[1:58:49] to do this they wanted to do that you
[1:58:50] know and uh
[1:58:52] to some that were real humble
[1:58:54] and that they just did this and did that
[1:58:56] and after a while god blessed them they
[1:58:58] said my how did you do this no i said i
[1:59:00] didn't do i didn't do it he said the
[1:59:01] lord did it
[1:59:02] the lord blessed me
[1:59:04] and yet though somebody else would start
[1:59:05] this and they had their plans they
[1:59:08] wanted to do this to make more money
[1:59:10] they wanted to do this get more popular
[1:59:12] and so on oh yeah
[1:59:16] and it went so far and then everything
[1:59:18] collapsed
[1:59:20] why
[1:59:21] because their motive and objective
[1:59:23] wasn't right
[1:59:27] you're more object you got
[1:59:28] what's your right motive right objective
[1:59:30] for the glory of god
[1:59:34] no matter what you experience in life
[1:59:36] lord i want it for your glory
[1:59:39] amen amen
[1:59:41] lord
[1:59:42] i'm doing this but lord if you want to
[1:59:43] bless me
[1:59:44] i thank you for it to god be the glory
[1:59:49] and again
[1:59:50] it's like again when i was
[1:59:52] partly in management in department store
[1:59:55] and
[1:59:55] i was assistant manager and the manager
[1:59:58] came out and he said except me and he
[2:00:00] said
[2:00:01] this this this how do you do this well
[2:00:04] no i said that's not me i said i leave
[2:00:07] that with the lord what
[2:00:10] i said yes i just leave with the lord
[2:00:13] because they figured out that because i
[2:00:15] want to get higher and higher and higher
[2:00:17] you know in in in a position that i
[2:00:20] would do this and i would fight for this
[2:00:22] i would put this there and do this and
[2:00:24] so no no i said i just leave that with
[2:00:25] the lord
[2:00:27] but they knew that i was there
[2:00:31] oh yeah they knew that they would trust
[2:00:33] me
[2:00:35] and that's why they would get me to do
[2:00:36] this and get me to do that get me do
[2:00:38] that i said well i said don't make a
[2:00:40] difference to me i said it's up to you
[2:00:42] oh yes he said we know but we want you
[2:00:44] to do it
[2:00:45] well i said i don't have to do it if you
[2:00:46] want to get somebody else to do it and
[2:00:48] pay them extra that's fine
[2:00:50] as you don't have to pay me
[2:00:53] oh yes he said we we want to do it i
[2:00:55] said well i'll leave it with you
[2:00:57] i should thank the lord
[2:01:01] you dealt like that with people that you
[2:01:03] work with oh yes i did
[2:01:11] yeah
[2:01:13] and
[2:01:14] i won't say that i'll leave that to to
[2:01:16] the lord
[2:01:20] grace brother sister
[2:01:25] let's not go in the way of king
[2:01:28] being religious but not spiritual
[2:01:32] let's not go on the error of balaam
[2:01:36] using human reasoning
[2:01:38] do it our way but not god's way
[2:01:42] not giving god the preeminence
[2:01:44] give god the preeminence in what you do
[2:01:47] whether it's in your home or in your job
[2:01:50] no matter what it is where it is
[2:01:52] give god preeminence
[2:01:55] see
[2:01:56] it prove
[2:01:58] you prove it that it's not me living
[2:02:00] it's jesus living in me
[2:02:04] yeah is jesus in control
[2:02:06] whether it's you in education
[2:02:09] and again as i said when i went to a
[2:02:11] school
[2:02:16] they knew
[2:02:17] that that i would only do so much
[2:02:19] and that's why they would only approach
[2:02:21] me and search certain things to get
[2:02:23] involved with with the rest of the
[2:02:24] students for this for this for that they
[2:02:26] knew
[2:02:27] that well he's he's religious and he
[2:02:30] this is what they felt that he won't do
[2:02:32] this and he won't do that you know
[2:02:34] until finally as i said one of the
[2:02:36] teachers that
[2:02:38] came to me and says excuse me
[2:02:40] i know you're going to be a pastor
[2:02:42] i said you do i said i don't know oh yes
[2:02:45] he said i think you're going to be a
[2:02:46] pastor
[2:02:50] a teacher
[2:02:53] yeah
[2:02:55] and again one time i went into a
[2:02:56] classroom
[2:02:59] and i was a bit late
[2:03:01] arriving
[2:03:03] and
[2:03:05] and the teacher said
[2:03:07] oh
[2:03:09] mr lush
[2:03:10] welcome
[2:03:12] he said just a reminder he said you're
[2:03:14] going to be late for the judgment
[2:03:16] i said i hope so
[2:03:19] but again he knew
[2:03:20] my spiritual stand
[2:03:24] that i took and i was just a student in
[2:03:25] the school
[2:03:27] but but he applied everything everything
[2:03:29] in in whatever i did he
[2:03:31] sort of applied it in a spiritual way
[2:03:35] even in school
[2:03:36] i said well thank the lord
[2:03:39] so i said i hope so and of course
[2:03:42] everybody laughed
[2:03:44] yeah
[2:03:45] and again another time
[2:03:47] it was in a religious class and that
[2:03:49] teacher was talking and talking and he
[2:03:51] asked the different ideas this idea what
[2:03:54] do you think of this what do you think
[2:03:55] of that what do you think and so he said
[2:03:56] all right
[2:03:58] i would like mr lush i would like you to
[2:04:00] what do you feel i was just one of the
[2:04:01] students there
[2:04:03] and i explained it
[2:04:04] oh
[2:04:06] thank you
[2:04:08] he said do you know
[2:04:09] he said that you're going to be a judge
[2:04:12] oh i don't know
[2:04:14] oh yes he said you're going to be a
[2:04:15] judge
[2:04:16] he said that was excellent thank you
[2:04:19] because it was a religious religious
[2:04:21] class
[2:04:22] and he had a religious question that he
[2:04:24] wanted an answer for
[2:04:25] and different and he this one gave an
[2:04:27] answer that one gave an answer and this
[2:04:29] one so on to finally i gave an answer
[2:04:31] now
[2:04:32] oh he said good thank you
[2:04:34] if you're going to be a judge
[2:04:37] to god be the glory
[2:04:41] so brother
[2:04:46] again we're
[2:04:47] exhorted to be on our guard
[2:04:49] when it comes to
[2:04:50] leadership so that we're not going to go
[2:04:53] in the way of cain and be religious but
[2:04:55] not spiritual
[2:04:56] and the error of balaam
[2:04:58] and use human reasoning
[2:05:01] do it our way but not god's way
[2:05:04] and the gain saying of korah
[2:05:08] denying god's
[2:05:09] absolute authority
[2:05:13] in the revealed word
[2:05:16] amen
[2:05:17] korah denied god's absolute authority in
[2:05:20] moses and aaron
[2:05:22] there are those that deny god's absolute
[2:05:24] authority in the ministry today and in
[2:05:27] the prophetic ministry of william
[2:05:28] branham
[2:05:30] god help us
[2:05:33] to have his leadership to follow his
[2:05:35] leadership amen
[2:05:40] turn with me to
[2:05:45] there's a number of other scriptures
[2:05:46] that i had here but i'll try to
[2:05:50] bring it to a close
[2:05:52] exodus chapter 13.
[2:05:56] exodus chapter 13.
[2:06:09] and beginning to read at verse 17.
[2:06:16] and it came to pass when pharaoh had let
[2:06:18] the people go
[2:06:20] that god led them
[2:06:22] not through the way of the land of the
[2:06:24] philistines
[2:06:26] although that was near for god said lest
[2:06:30] per adventure the people repent
[2:06:32] when they see war
[2:06:34] and they return to egypt
[2:06:39] but god led the people about
[2:06:42] through the way of wilderness of the red
[2:06:44] sea
[2:06:45] and the children of israel went up
[2:06:47] earnest
[2:06:49] out of the land of egypt
[2:06:51] and moses took the bones of joseph with
[2:06:53] him
[2:06:54] for he had straightly sworn the children
[2:06:57] of israel
[2:06:58] saying god will surely visit you and ye
[2:07:01] shall carry up my bones away ants with
[2:07:04] you
[2:07:05] and they took their journey
[2:07:09] amen
[2:07:13] from success
[2:07:14] and encamped in
[2:07:16] etham in the edge of the wilderness
[2:07:19] and the lord went before them by day in
[2:07:22] a pillar of a cloud
[2:07:24] to lead them the way amen god's
[2:07:27] leadership
[2:07:28] and by night in a pillar of fire
[2:07:32] he said to give them light
[2:07:34] to go by day
[2:07:36] and night
[2:07:38] and he took not away the pillar of the
[2:07:40] cloud
[2:07:41] by day nor the pillar of fire by night
[2:07:45] from before the people
[2:07:47] god's leadership by the cloud god's
[2:07:49] leadership by the pillar of fire
[2:07:51] amen
[2:07:53] in which we can identify
[2:07:55] god's leadership today
[2:07:57] in the cloud of angels and in the pillar
[2:08:00] of fire
[2:08:01] praise the name of the lord
[2:08:05] the cloud of angels and the pillar of
[2:08:07] fire
[2:08:10] as the the prophet said there he is he
[2:08:12] said looking down at us
[2:08:14] referring to jesus christ in the cloud
[2:08:17] amen
[2:08:18] and the pillar of fire
[2:08:21] amen and again as the problem god did
[2:08:23] say he said anybody looks at that
[2:08:26] picture
[2:08:27] and he said
[2:08:28] if you don't if you only see the pillar
[2:08:30] of fire it's if you don't if you see
[2:08:32] anything other than the pillow fires
[2:08:33] you're not you're not seeing the picture
[2:08:35] right
[2:08:38] yeah
[2:08:39] so he said if you look at it and all you
[2:08:41] see is the bill of fire you're seeing
[2:08:43] the picture right don't notice he said
[2:08:45] him william branham but i should see the
[2:08:48] pillar of fire
[2:08:49] amen and it was number of years ago now
[2:08:52] that the man that took this picture
[2:08:54] right here
[2:08:55] of the pillar of fire on brother brown's
[2:08:56] shoulder outside a church door
[2:08:59] that he contacted me by email requesting
[2:09:02] a copy of the picture
[2:09:05] and he said brother he said i took the
[2:09:07] picture
[2:09:08] and he said i would appreciate a copy
[2:09:10] and apparently he had tried to get a
[2:09:12] copy from other places but they couldn't
[2:09:14] get him so he said i was just wondering
[2:09:15] if you could provide it and i did amen
[2:09:18] there's a gentleman that took the
[2:09:20] picture amen he said william bannon was
[2:09:22] preaching
[2:09:24] and ministering and he said he left and
[2:09:25] he went out the back door and he said i
[2:09:27] went out and i went around and he said
[2:09:30] took his picture
[2:09:31] when he came out the back door
[2:09:33] amen and it was the pillar of fire on
[2:09:35] his shoulder
[2:09:36] praise the lord
[2:09:38] praise the name of the lord and of
[2:09:40] course here is the altar of fire
[2:09:42] around the prophet
[2:09:44] and as i said he
[2:09:46] when it when someone showed the picture
[2:09:47] he said well he said
[2:09:49] he said that's not me there
[2:09:52] he said i'm right here
[2:09:54] and he is
[2:09:56] right there
[2:09:58] praise the lord
[2:10:00] brother i trust we're going to see god
[2:10:03] amen let's follow the leadership of god
[2:10:05] not the leadership of william branham
[2:10:06] but the leadership of god by the grace
[2:10:09] of god
[2:10:11] amen
[2:10:14] see
[2:10:16] turn with me to
[2:10:23] romans chapter
[2:10:24] 8.
[2:10:36] romans chapter 8 and
[2:10:46] it says verse 10
[2:10:48] if christ be in you
[2:10:52] the body is dead because of sin
[2:10:55] but the spirit is life because of
[2:10:58] righteousness
[2:11:00] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[2:11:02] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[2:11:05] raised up christ from the dead shall
[2:11:06] also quicken your mortal bodies by is
[2:11:10] spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:11:12] i trust you have the spirit of christ in
[2:11:14] you
[2:11:15] i trust jesus is in our young brothers
[2:11:17] and sisters i trust jesus as in yes even
[2:11:20] to grandma and grandpa
[2:11:26] not in your head but in your heart
[2:11:30] amen
[2:11:34] so verse 11 again if the spirit of him
[2:11:36] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[2:11:39] in you he that raised up christ from the
[2:11:42] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[2:11:44] bodies
[2:11:45] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:11:48] now if your if your spirit is not in you
[2:11:50] he won't quicken you
[2:11:53] no
[2:11:56] but if your spirit is in you you'll
[2:11:57] quicken you unto eternal life
[2:12:02] therefore brethren we are debtors
[2:12:04] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[2:12:07] for if we live after the flesh ye shall
[2:12:10] die
[2:12:11] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[2:12:14] the deeds of the body ye shall live
[2:12:18] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[2:12:21] god
[2:12:22] they are the sons of god
[2:12:24] so are you led by the spirit in what you
[2:12:27] do today
[2:12:28] are you led by the spirit and what you
[2:12:30] did yesterday
[2:12:31] are you led by the spirit in what you
[2:12:33] will do tomorrow
[2:12:35] or the remainder of this day
[2:12:42] what are your plans for the day
[2:12:45] is it your plans or god's plans
[2:12:50] how many of us
[2:12:51] through the day in all decisions how
[2:12:54] many of us say lord
[2:12:56] what's your will
[2:12:58] i don't care what the choice is i don't
[2:13:00] care what you're trying to make a
[2:13:01] decision on you you if you're spiritual
[2:13:05] if you're a son and daughter of god
[2:13:07] you you'll be consulting the lord in
[2:13:08] your heart
[2:13:10] or most definitely
[2:13:12] it doesn't make a difference what your
[2:13:13] choice is what you want to do lord i
[2:13:16] want i want your leadership
[2:13:18] amen
[2:13:20] when you start your day
[2:13:22] you want god's leadership
[2:13:25] oh yeah
[2:13:27] but we we think oh well i don't need to
[2:13:30] talk to the lord about this i don't need
[2:13:32] to see what the lord's will is you know
[2:13:34] this is just normal
[2:13:36] it makes no difference
[2:13:37] it's not you that lives is christ living
[2:13:41] in you
[2:13:42] and brother this christ in you no matter
[2:13:44] what you do it's him
[2:13:47] just think
[2:13:49] i'll tell you this not many have that
[2:13:52] consciousness or that awareness of being
[2:13:54] a christian
[2:13:58] and it's not just being a christian
[2:14:00] wednesdays and sundays
[2:14:03] or in church
[2:14:05] it's being a christian 24 7.
[2:14:11] yeah
[2:14:13] by the grace of god
[2:14:17] you know
[2:14:18] and what about when we
[2:14:20] gather sometimes that brother
[2:14:24] mark's
[2:14:24] place sometimes we gather here and then
[2:14:27] we'll go to brother marks for fellowship
[2:14:29] and that brother what about is it
[2:14:31] spiritual
[2:14:32] it ought to be
[2:14:35] when we sing
[2:14:37] and praise the lord we're spiritual
[2:14:40] yeah it's not just entertainment
[2:14:43] too often too often
[2:14:45] certain ones are entertained
[2:14:47] no
[2:14:48] spiritual
[2:14:49] it's just your name if you've got the
[2:14:51] holy ghost and the christ in you it's
[2:14:53] just your nature
[2:14:54] just say praise the lord amen thank you
[2:14:57] lord and it's not just singing the oh
[2:14:59] the oh we'll sing this one right here
[2:15:01] yeah that's just the words

[2:15:04] it's revelation
[2:15:06] oh yeah it's spiritual
[2:15:08] hallelujah thank you jesus amen
[2:15:12] amen
[2:15:13] so we're singing it as unto the lord
[2:15:17] see
[2:15:17] again it's 24
[2:15:20] 7. not wednesday and sunday
[2:15:24] not just say lord be with us through the
[2:15:25] day now lord we watch and go on that's
[2:15:28] it no no
[2:15:29] no no
[2:15:30] sons and daughters of god are led by the
[2:15:33] spirit of god
[2:15:35] amen
[2:15:37] and it says as many as are led by the
[2:15:39] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[2:15:41] amen
[2:15:42] so you you're led by the spirit in your
[2:15:44] job you're led by the spirit in what
[2:15:46] you're doing in your home you're led by
[2:15:48] the spirit of what you do in church led
[2:15:50] by the spirit of what you're doing in
[2:15:52] fellowship oh yeah
[2:15:55] it's god in control
[2:15:57] by the grace of god
[2:16:01] for ye have not received the spirit of
[2:16:03] bondage again to fear but ye have
[2:16:05] received the spirit of adoption
[2:16:08] whereby we cry abba father
[2:16:11] amen
[2:16:15] and the spirit itself bears witness with
[2:16:17] our spirit that we are the children of
[2:16:21] god
[2:16:23] by the grace of god
[2:16:25] amen
[2:16:28] all right just one more scripture
[2:16:29] matthew chapter 15.
[2:16:35] matthew 15
[2:16:38] let's see
[2:16:48] praise the lord for his word
[2:16:53] matthew 15
[2:16:56] and verse 5
[2:16:59] but ye say whosoever shall say to his
[2:17:02] father or his mother
[2:17:04] it is a gift by whatsoever thou
[2:17:08] mightest be profited by me
[2:17:10] and honor not his father or his
[2:17:13] mother
[2:17:15] he shall be free
[2:17:18] thus have ye made the commandment of god
[2:17:20] of none effect by your tradition
[2:17:24] you leave it the way god said it
[2:17:27] don't add to it don't take from it
[2:17:30] amen
[2:17:33] says ye hypocrites
[2:17:35] well did isaiah the prophet prophesy of
[2:17:37] you saying
[2:17:38] this people draw nigh unto me with their
[2:17:41] mouth
[2:17:43] honor me with their lips
[2:17:46] but their heart is far from me
[2:17:51] amen
[2:17:54] it's serious
[2:17:57] so brother sister if you draw nigh to
[2:18:00] god with your mouth let it be out of
[2:18:01] your heart
[2:18:03] and you honor god with your lips let it
[2:18:05] be out of your heart
[2:18:07] so that your heart is not far from god
[2:18:10] but rather god is in your heart
[2:18:14] and he called or rather
[2:18:17] verse 9 but in vain they do worship me
[2:18:20] in vain
[2:18:21] they do worship me teaching for
[2:18:24] doctrines
[2:18:26] the commandments of men
[2:18:29] and he called the multitude and said
[2:18:30] unto them hear and understand
[2:18:34] not that which goeth into the mouth
[2:18:36] defile of the man but that which cometh
[2:18:38] out of the mouth this defile of the man
[2:18:41] and then came his disciples and said
[2:18:43] unto him knowest thou that the pharisees
[2:18:46] were offended
[2:18:48] after they heard this same
[2:18:50] but he answered and said every plant
[2:18:53] which my heavenly father hath not
[2:18:55] planted shall be rooted up
[2:18:59] let them alone
[2:19:00] they be blind leaders of the blind
[2:19:04] amen blind leaders
[2:19:07] of the blind
[2:19:09] and if the blind lead the blind both
[2:19:12] shall fall into the ditch
[2:19:15] grace
[2:19:16] that we're not following a blind leader
[2:19:19] but a leader with
[2:19:21] perfect vision
[2:19:23] by the grace of god
[2:19:25] amen
[2:19:30] and concerning this message on
[2:19:32] leadership
[2:19:34] when william branham preached this in
[2:19:35] december 1965
[2:19:38] he said i have a message
[2:19:40] i feel from god
[2:19:42] it's a little odd to some people
[2:19:45] amen
[2:19:46] he said i don't mean to be different
[2:19:48] he said i'm living at a changing time
[2:19:52] and as long as you're building the wall
[2:19:54] one straight way he said it's all fine
[2:19:57] he said the brick layers can go right
[2:19:59] down the road but when you have to turn
[2:20:02] a corner
[2:20:03] brother we've got to turn corners
[2:20:09] too many take the message and just keep
[2:20:10] on going down the line
[2:20:12] building a wall
[2:20:14] but he said
[2:20:16] he said we're not building a wall we are
[2:20:18] building a house
[2:20:21] so he said these turns as to come
[2:20:24] either they come in the age of martin
[2:20:26] luther john wesley the pentecostal age
[2:20:29] and now it's here again
[2:20:31] but he said it's hard to turn the
[2:20:33] corners
[2:20:34] but he said god even though how rough
[2:20:37] it's been
[2:20:38] the people has responded 100
[2:20:41] so we're very grateful
[2:20:43] he said thank each one of you
[2:20:45] turning the corner
[2:20:48] by the grace of god
[2:20:50] amen
[2:21:01] just
[2:21:02] okay go ahead
[2:21:05] he said we've got to channel ourselves
[2:21:07] into god's provided channel and god's
[2:21:10] way of doing it
[2:21:13] no matter how much we think it's right
[2:21:15] it's got to be according to the word of
[2:21:17] the lord or it's in vain
[2:21:21] no matter what you feel
[2:21:23] it's got to be according to the word
[2:21:26] amen
[2:21:27] he said cain
[2:21:29] worshipped
[2:21:30] but it wasn't according to the word of
[2:21:32] the lord
[2:21:34] abel did
[2:21:35] and it was according to the word of god
[2:21:38] the pharisees worship
[2:21:40] but not according to the word of the
[2:21:43] lord
[2:21:45] and he said the word of the lord
[2:21:46] sometimes you have to put
[2:21:49] put it in the right place or is not the
[2:21:52] will of god
[2:21:53] amen
[2:21:54] so concerning the word of god that will
[2:21:57] let's make sure it's in the right place
[2:22:00] to keep us in the will of god
[2:22:03] concerning this day and this hour that
[2:22:04] we're living in
[2:22:06] and brother concerning this day this
[2:22:09] hour that we're living in what is the
[2:22:10] will of god
[2:22:14] what's god looking for in you and me
[2:22:17] i tell you what god's looking for in you
[2:22:18] and me now is resurrection and rapturing
[2:22:21] faith
[2:22:24] what was god looking for in the
[2:22:30] in luther's age
[2:22:33] justification
[2:22:35] amen the message of justification
[2:22:39] amen the faith of justification
[2:22:42] amen
[2:22:44] and wesley sanctification
[2:22:47] and of course under the
[2:22:49] brotherly kindness the loud to see him
[2:22:51] pentecostals the gifts of the baptism of
[2:22:54] the holy ghost and the gifts of the
[2:22:56] spirit
[2:22:57] but make sure you got the baptism in
[2:22:58] your soul
[2:23:00] not just in your flesh
[2:23:02] because you can have the gifts in your
[2:23:04] flesh you can experience it in your
[2:23:06] flesh
[2:23:07] and still not be in your soul as i've
[2:23:09] said you can have the holy ghost in your
[2:23:11] flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell
[2:23:14] amen but god works out of your soul
[2:23:18] amen
[2:23:19] to change us from creatures of time to
[2:23:22] creatures of eternity
[2:23:24] amen
[2:23:25] so make sure it's in the right place
[2:23:27] in your soul and make sure it's the will
[2:23:29] of god not your will not what you want
[2:23:32] it's what god wants
[2:23:34] well brother
[2:23:35] how can i make sure that what i want is
[2:23:37] the will of god
[2:23:39] judge it by the word
[2:23:42] this is the will of god
[2:23:44] amen
[2:23:45] what what did they do when god moved in
[2:23:48] abel
[2:23:48] praise the lord what was the will of god
[2:23:51] in that in that time
[2:23:53] well
[2:23:54] was cain in the will of god or abel in
[2:23:56] the will of god
[2:23:58] it was able not cain
[2:24:01] yeah
[2:24:03] so and it all down true
[2:24:05] see who was in the will of god and he
[2:24:07] was doing their own will
[2:24:10] amen god had to deal with the jews
[2:24:12] then all through eventually god had to
[2:24:14] deal with the christians and the
[2:24:15] gentiles
[2:24:17] amen
[2:24:18] because the god is there to reveal his
[2:24:21] will but the enemy is there to get you
[2:24:23] to do your will
[2:24:24] human will
[2:24:26] the devil's will oh yeah still be
[2:24:28] religious
[2:24:30] and still think you're christian
[2:24:31] but just do it this way do it that way
[2:24:34] because that's what man did all down
[2:24:36] through the all the way through the ages
[2:24:37] when when god moved
[2:24:39] all the devil moved only us why not
[2:24:41] again i don't have the time to do it to
[2:24:42] go into the book of revelation to show
[2:24:44] you that when the spirit of god went and
[2:24:46] did this
[2:24:47] god said oh yeah that was good i
[2:24:49] appreciated your faith but then the
[2:24:51] enemy got in and influenced him to do
[2:24:52] this
[2:24:53] amen whether it's the first age the
[2:24:56] enemy got in and the and oh yeah they
[2:24:58] got away from the holy ghost and got
[2:25:01] under the control of man man's
[2:25:02] leadership not god's leadership
[2:25:05] but the anointing would come down come
[2:25:07] down come down so the anointing came
[2:25:09] down again luther's age and men man
[2:25:11] followed god's leadership with the
[2:25:13] message of justification god's
[2:25:15] leadership the message of sanctification
[2:25:18] god's leadership the baptism of the holy
[2:25:20] ghost the gifts of the spirit amen and
[2:25:23] now it's god's leadership in the
[2:25:24] revealed word to give us resurrection
[2:25:27] and rapturing faith amen
[2:25:29] they had the faith to do what god was
[2:25:31] doing there and believe what god was
[2:25:33] doing do we have the faith to believe
[2:25:35] what god is doing now
[2:25:37] amen oh yes thank god for for for luther
[2:25:40] and wesley and pentecost thank god for
[2:25:43] the others
[2:25:44] but
[2:25:45] amen

[2:25:48] done and what god's doing to give us
