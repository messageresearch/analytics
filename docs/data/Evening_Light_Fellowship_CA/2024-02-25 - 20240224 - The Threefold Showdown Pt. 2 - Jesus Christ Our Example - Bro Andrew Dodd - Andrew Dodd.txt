asking abundantly tonight oh God we ask Lord that you would move in all of us Lord tonight we commit it into your hands Lord in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen amen let's take our Bibles together to the Book of Luke Luke Chapter 2 amen it's good to see every one of you here I thank you brother Josh for the song service tonight I appreciate that the special sister Priscilla God bless you I love the way the Lord moves don't you amen I love it just a simple humble song and just an atmosphere that comes in behind it amen he's worthy of all our praise he's worthy of all our worship he's got angels that worship Him holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty constantly day and night before his throne and there is no night there they just worship and worship but there's something about the redeemed when the bride of Christ becomes gathering in and we come together and bring our licks of fire when we begin to sing a song that Angels cannot sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound when we begin to sing of how he redeemed Us and how he brought us through our trials when we begin to thank him for that Angels don't know what that's like they have to be quiet in our presence when we begin to sing God puts you in a place CU he loves you amen he died on the cross for you the Bible says he with joy he endured the suffering for the joy that was set before him he willingly endured the cross amen let's take our Bibles here to Luke Chapter 2 I want to carry on tonight into The three-fold Showdown but I would take for a subtitle tonight Christ our example Christ our example in Luke chapter 2 verse 49 amen we certainly enjoyed the brother's breakfast this morning that all that could make it I asked brother Jensen on the way to church did you enjoy it he said yes so we enjoyed the the brother's breakfast thank you for the fellowship each one God bless you richly amen lukee chapter 2: 49 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wish you not that I must be about my father's business and they understood not that saying that he spoke unto them and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man amen may the Lord is Blessing to the word you may have your seats amen as I said we're still speaking tonight on the on The three-fold Showdown and the first Showdown that we went into last night was Mount Carmel and and and how that every believer needs to come to a Mount Carmel in their life in order to understand and have a revelation that God is God God is Sovereign God is able to do whatever he will God is will perform his purpose he will perform what he desires to do what he has laid out before the foundation of the world to do the question is are you a part of it amen are you willing to say the Lord he is is God Amen it outlines so well in that Showdown the pressures around it leading up to each Showdown but God proves himself in every dispensation because a showdown is to prove who God is in that dispensation and he proves himself in every dispensation of his three-fold purpose of just who he is and how he's showing himself and what his Veil is and he proved that day on the mountain of Mount Carmel that God is God and now tonight if we could come into the second Showdown brother Bram would talk about and pick up your pen and write being three showdowns of Mount Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration and Mount Zion tonight as we could go into Mount Zion or Mount Transfiguration a little bit and look at Christ our example we begin to get a pristine look into the life of the Son of God leading up to that Showdown which was not a public show this one was not the first one was showing that he's God and that that that nothing is greater than he is but now in this second Showdown as he begin to come to prove who he is in that dispensation it became a private Showdown where he had three Heavenly Witnesses and three Earthly Witnesses and that was all he did it before and God does not take these things lightly God does not do these things just to do them amen God does not move in our midst just to move in our midst we ought never to come to church and God move and say well wasn't that nice no God when he moves it's always for a purpose he's got a reason behind him coming into our midst amen God uh doesn't do anything new he knew everything he's omniscient he knows all things he knew that you would be here he knew that God would bring you here he knew where you would sit brother man would talk about how he knows every hair that's on your head he knows the length of your fingernails he knows exactly where you're at he knows your thoughts he knows the intents of your heart he understands exactly what you're going through he knows the trials he knows what you went through today to get here so let's leave that in the past now and let's focus on what he has for us tonight because God knows all about that and he's able to take care of it amen and the first dispensation of his of his three-fold purpose was to prove that God is God and now in the mount Transfiguration it was to prove that Jesus is God and and and and Matthew 5:1 17 he would say think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets but I am not come to destroy but to fulfill amen and as he would speak about it he'd say in other words I am not come to destroy the law but I am what the law was meant to produce the all that the law was it was meant to bring something to this magnitude something to this Perfection but without the Holy Spirit no man could do it it had to take God to come down and show that he could live it and that he would be perfect and that he could die for our sins and that he could give us his spirit so we could live the law Hallelujah now in order to understand this we have to go all the way back to the beginning of the process of adoption to understand the example of whose image exactly we're being formed into as we are being formed into the image of Christ Jesus as Christians not into the image of William brandham we're not being formed into the image of any man we're being formed into the image of God Amen and I want to just take if I could if we could focus a little bit tonight what I'll largely be focusing on is is for the young people so this is largely for you and then if if if some of the older ones that maybe don't think they're young people get something out of it God bless you but we're all young people in heart somewhere inside even no matter how old you are there's a little 19-year-old boy or girl just waiting for a body change amen waiting to put on immortality waiting to go back and desires to do all of the things that you once could do amen I know you don't get a lot of amens when you talk like that because the old people don't want to identify themselves that's all right but Mary thought brother Bram would talk about in the message uh God hiding himself in Simplicity he says what what Mary thought he says altogether no matter what the outside thought she pondered on all of the things as we said as she as Jesus said to her know ye not that I must be about my father's business the scripture records Mary hid all of these things in her heart amen and it says that no matter what anyone on the outside thought she pondered on these things within herself she hid them in her heart they know they couldn't say nothing bad against it once the word of God Jesus Christ once he spoke and said know you not I must be about my father's business they didn't retort they didn't come back to say well I'm your father I no they knew I can't say anything against that they just pondered it in their heart it became a reality and Joseph even knew different he knew whose baby that was Mary knew who the baby belonged to Jesus knew who his father was that's why he could say know you not I must be about my father's business and he wasn't down in the carpenter shop sawing wood he was about his father's business amen when the mother said can't you understand he says it's time that I be about my father's business now they thought this little cracked up child any illegitimate child is kind of an odd Curious Thing anyhow and there you are see but God hiding himself listen God hiding himself in what in what was thought of by the world as filth and Corruption and illegitimate but God HD himself in that the world looked at it one way and but all of those outside thinking brother BR would say Mary didn't care care about all that outside thought and all the Whispers that went around that it was filthy that it was corruption that it was illegitimate that it was something else but rather she pondered all of these things in her heart and as God hid himself in this look God hiding himself in the corruption of a dead sea to bring forth life oh praise be to God Christ our example God hiding himself in a dead sea to bring forth life God hides himself he says in a simple little washwoman or an ordinary man with his dinner under his arm and kisses wife and children goodbye and go out there maybe hide himself in that no man to in that no in that man to God would hide himself in that man to do something that the Archbishop would know nothing about you don't hear him blow no horns or sent out about it God just gets the glory that's all just simple hear it and and are glad God hides himself in simple people in Simplicity that's somebody that just maybe they just have they're the father of a home and they just take their lunch kit under their arm and they just kiss their wife and children goodbye and they head off to work and they begin witnessing and pretty soon there becomes a new believer in church and another new believer and the Pastor's going what's going on who's doing this but just somebody so simple just living a Godly life and God begins to move in such a way amen we just had a couple baptisms back at end time message Tabernacle in Emon of a couple men that they came from Ju Just backgrounds and and and and and and it was just from a a man in our church a brother in our church that just flew up to Fort McMurray every week every other week and he would just witness for the Lord he was there at work and every time he'd see somebody he witnessed for God and he'd be in the lunch reading a message book and witnessing to everybody he could just sharing the gospel you never heard about it until here comes a couple young men saying I need to get baptized I need to get right with God what was it what was it the fruit of just a Godly life that was lived God hiding himself in Simplicity amen it may not even be say I'm not even a father brother Andrew I don't have much you might just be a young person a young girl or a young boy that says I just go to school God hides himself in that he desires to have a testimony in the school in the home amongst your friends wherever you would go the simple day-to-day jobs that you would do that you would pick up here and there God wants to live his life through you Hallelujah God hides himself in in the Simplicity of a baby hiding himself in the Simplicity of a common family and the ecclesiastical and the great man and the minds and the genius and all of them and the herods and so forth of that day and the neros they just overlooked it God in Simplicity God has always moved that way don't never be discouraged when you look at the church and say it's so simple it's so small why isn't it bigger if this is really the truth why is why doesn't everybody believe this why why is it they're just booming here and booming there and people coming in and rushing in because God hides himself in Simplicity he reveals it to babes such as would learn hides it from the eyes of the wise and the prudent those that ought to know better but they won't re says now watch what God did when his son was born he let him go for 30 years testing him trying him for 30 years we come up we know a little bit about the birth of Jesus and then it jumps over till when he's 2 years old and they run down to Egypt then it jumps over when he's 12 years old and and he's there in the temple then we don't hear much about him for another 18 years till he's 30 years old and he's there getting baptized John the Baptist and everything going on but in that space of 18 years you don't hear much about it but the scripture gives us that little bit of insight into it where he says in in Luke 2:52 which says and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man and I want to just dwell on this a little bit because there's there's such an example to us especially as young people as what God desires for us to do and that it wasn't that there was great Miracles and things that were going on but there was something that Jesus was doing that he was growing in favor God was Finding favor in him men were finding favor in him he was becoming to a place where people would begin to look at him and say something's different about him I like that man I like that boy I like the way they are I like the way they carry themselves I like the way they talk I like the way they dress why something about what he was doing was causing him to have pleasure with God and now if we could if we could look at Galatians chter 4 and verse one it says now that the air as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen and we're talking about Christ our example and I know uh as we get into this it'll be along the lines of adoption and as he begins to talk and Paul begins to lay out a certain principle he says but under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so Jesus even went through a time in his life there from 12 all the way up until he was uh 30 years old that that he was under a time that he was learning that he was he had subjected himself to his own natural uh I'll say guardians or parents to Mary and to Joseph as as their own son he subjected himself to them that they could raise him in the nurture and admonition of the Lord I believe that was Mary and Joseph's desire as they brought up their children to raise them right but even so the scripture goes on in verse three says even so we when we were children were in bondage bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that are under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons that it wasn't just for Jesus Christ but it was also for us and because you are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father as we said last night God is in the business of turning hearts and he's able to send his Spirit of his son into the hearts of men whereby we would even begin to cry Abba Father or father father and he says wherefore art thou no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen as we can pick up where brother Brandon would talk about you didn't become sons of God you always were a Son of God you always were because you could only be born of God if you were a part of God if you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world that's what Redemption story is redeem means to bring back in other words it had to be somewhere first in order to bring it back to there amen it it wasn't just a purchase but it was a Redemption to bring you back to what you always were meant to be so you always were by predestination the sons of God but we we had to go through a process because we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity we come into this world speaking lies the part of us that was a Son of God was the seed Gene of God that he put within our hearts that he put in our souls our flesh is not that our spirit is not that it needs to be trained it needs to come under subjection as as the scripture says in Romans 8:11 if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it will bring even your mortal bodies even this flesh Hallelujah it will Quicken your mortal body that's what the scripture says which means it will bring it into subjection to the spirit that is within that's how powerful the spirit of God is that it is able to bring your flesh into subjection oh praise God we could preach on that a whole lot longer but I want to just focus in on the tutor and then and and and to learn of the of the tutor because really the purpose of a tutor is to have you learn the knowledge and the wisdom of the tutor the tutor is bringing you knowledge and wisdom from the father to bring it down to you so that you could learn it so that you could operate under the authority of the father or by the authority of the Father the tutor is there to enable you to learn the knowledge and the wisdom because wisdom really is the ability to apply the knowledge in your everyday life and we need the wisdom of God it's not just knowledge unfortunately there's many theologians that have a whole lot of knowledge but no wisdom they have a lot of knowledge in the scripture and they could talk you this way and that way and this way and that way but they don't have a clue how to apply it in everyday life they needed a tutor they rejected the tutor of the Holy Ghost which is what God sent to bring us to the adoption of sons are you with me this this morning praise God how about this evening are you with me this evening amen amen so really the the the purpose of the tutor then is to bring us to a place to increase Us in knowledge and in wisdom to enable us to operate by the authority of the father so that we know an adopted son brother Bron would talk about an adopted son where he'd say then your name on the check is as good as your father's check check or as your father's name on the check that whatever you say it's the same as him saying it but it's not some great thing but rather it's just a molding process that God wants to bring you through to bring you to a place of maturity to bring you to a place where you can handle the word of God in a mature way where he can trust you with his word are you with me and God operates by faith Hallelujah God operates by by faith and faith is a revelation of the will of God so what is it he reveals himself to you and that gives you faith in what to do and he reveals himself to you more and now as we can pick it up in John chap 16:12 we're going to get into that I don't want to get too far ahead of myself so forgive me John 16:12 says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the Spirit of Truth is come that's our tutor he will guide you into all Truth for he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come Hallelujah he will begin to speak to you and the Holy Ghost is what makes the word of God a reality to you why is it that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the mystery of God should be finished and yet how many believe it in other words how many is it a revelation to just a very few but yet he's revealed it he's shown it to you he's shown it to the world he went around the world seven times preaching the message of the hour he showed it with signs and wonders following he exactly fulfilled Malachi chapter 4 and God revealed all of the mysteries of God and yet so many people look at it and go I don't believe it because it has to be a revelation God himself by the spirit of God has to make it real to you personally I would say even even as a young person because when we often speak about adoption it becomes a big scary thing because we we look at Mount Transfiguration brother Bram says that was the adoption ceremony for for the Lord Jesus Christ and as we look at that and we will tonight Lord willing look farther into that but we look at it as a big scary thing as well he was got up on a mountain and he was transfigured into the the glorified body and the Lord God sha through him as the sun and it was just a wonderful experience and the cloud overshadowed and it began to speak out this is my beloved Son I'll never attain to that you will but it won't be just like that are you with me it won't look just like that he's not looking to bring you and through your buddies up on a mountain and do just what he did but he's looking to have sons and daughters who will live the Revelation that he gives them he's looking to have young people that will live the Revelation that he gives you he's looking to have old people that will live the revelation God gives to you he's looking to have fathers that will live the revelation God gives the father he's looking to have mothers that will live by the Revelation that God gives them when he gives a mother a revelation that she ought to be a keeper at home and she ought to be taking care of those children he's looking to see that she'll live by that Revelation and not always trying to be running here and running there and got to get a job and got to work and got to do this why he saying I gave you something to live by and instead you looked at the things of the world and wanted to live by it amen he looked at the fathers and he's trying to get to you through this message a revelation of what it is to be a high priest of the home are you with me now fathers he laid it out in the message of exactly what it is that you're the high priest of your home you're able to apply the token and apply the blood of Jesus Christ over your own home you're able to cast The Devils out of your own home you're able to have God in your home you're able to be an example to your children and he says I'm giving you that Revelation what are you going to do with it are you going to live by it or say you know what I mean my wife does a good job I think I'll go hang out with my buddies he says I gave you Revelation I'm looking for you to come to a place of maturity in what I've given you then I could give you more but I can't give you more until you live what I've already given you Hallelujah that's why these showdowns are so important when the first Showdown comes God is God until you get the Revelation that God is Sovereign and he is God and he is able to do what he will and he will perform his purpose one way or another until you get that Revelation he cannot go further with you well that got quiet he's not going to show you the intricate Secrets if you don't even know who he is my wife goes home with me she knows me she's my wife I share with her everything but she knows who I am I could talk to somebody else who doesn't know me I could say how many kids do I have and they go I don't know I could just come right down here let me just make this very plain how y'all doing tonight brother what's your name brother Chad pleasure to meet you God bless you what do I do for work I do no what do I do he's sharp that's part of what I do how many kids do I have no he doesn't know me we've met we shook hands your brother Chad God bless you I'm brother Andrew pleasure to meet you but he doesn't know me how many have met the Lord Jesus Christ and all of a sudden they want well I want great Revelations I met him I had a feeling I had an altar call I went through a prayer line I I I was in my prayer closet I met him but do you know him are you really in his word do you meditate upon it day and night is it something that that you just came can't help but consume your mind with I was just I went for a walk today it was a lot longer than ID hoped for but I quite enjoyed it to be honest with you and as I be to walk and I my wife was there and sister Blanca was our guide and she she brought us out and as we were walking and I just lag behind and Le behind and I was thinking on the Lord the whole time and God began to come down in such a sovereign way actually rearranged my whole notes for tonight and begin to show me exactly what to speak and exactly how to speak it and how to address it to the young people how to make sure it's a reality to you why I begin to meditate upon the word of God I'm not lifting myself up I'm just saying that's the way a Christian lives get get yourself aside to God begin to meditate on him David said I write your word upon my bed post I meditate upon it day and night I do all these things why do I do it why because there's something about God when he could come in and you might not know the answer to a question there's been so many times CU I'm a plumber by day by by the way and as as I would be there and plumbing and I there'd be questions that I would have and something that I couldn't figure out something that just I remember laying on my side one time and trying to fix a sister's hot water tank the drain had broken and I went to go unscrew it and thing just cracked oh it's full of water and it's her H it's a sister's house I wasn't charging her very much because I just for the parts because I thought man I just do her do her quick something and favor and now it's going to leak all over her house maybe flood it and I just prayed I said God I don't I don't want to flood this sister's house help me out and somehow I managed to thread on a hose and that little plastic drain 3/4 of the way around it was cracked it held on to drain the entire tank and then I was able to take it off and I had to lay on my side between a little little hacksaw and cut a little piece of plastic out of there and then slowly unthread it the whole time praying Lord I hope this works I don't want to have to go upstairs and tell the sister you need need a new tank you know that $50 part you needed well now you need $1,000 part I was just praying Lord don't let that be the case and God allowed at all to work out right well God's a real present help in a time of trouble no matter how great or no matter how small the need is he cares if it matters to you it matters to the master Satan is a very good way very good at throwing distractions our way and throwing thoughts at us to make us distracted I was telling a couple the other day as we were talking and they said you know I find it amazing you'll go on Facebook and you'll just use Facebook for something good you know sisters they like Facebook they can look up recipes and they can scroll through recipes they can scroll through buy and sell and you know I said why don't you ask God about recipes then because Satan will put a thought in your mind you're not even thinking about cooking anything but all of a sudden he's like what about this recipe you're like oh and he'll he knows he's got you down the road it ain't sinful looking up recipes Brothers is not sinful but he's got you going down a road where all of a sudden you've end you've become to an endless scroll for two hours and now you're exhausted and you're going to bed Brothers he's got you doing the same thing you get talking about something and all of a sudden I wonder if there's somebody could show me how to use that tree stand I was thinking about getting in the next thing you know you're watching hunting videos for hours on end and you're watching we were talking about the other day woodwork and videos and different things that we just as men it's not sinful it's not evil things that we're doing but what's sinful about it is the time Satan is just putting something in front of you just to distract you he knows he doesn't have to get you to go out and commit adultery he's just got to get you away from God and so why don't you and why don't I I'm preaching myself here too why don't we go to God lord I was thinking about a recipe today I always get so quiet when you talk like that oh brother we ought to only pray great spiritual prayers oh then we are of most men most miserable when he's a friend that sticks closer than a brother he cares about the things that matter to you whether they be big whether they be small whether you're thinking this morning I I'd like to go out and get myself a moose whether you're thinking I'd like to bake a nice dessert whether you thinking I I'd just like to know about if there's a dress Lord I just maybe get on my knees first and say Lord I don't want to waste two hours looking maybe I could spend some time with you first and talk to you cuz pretty soon you'll find out when you get that first layer off that those first thoughts of the recipe the first thoughts of the dress the first thoughts of the hunting you'll find there's a whole lot down underneath there that God begins to pull out of you and you begin to enter into another place of prayer something that you don't even know as the spirit says in Romans chap as the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 you don't even know how to properly even make utterance for but the spirit of God begins to make utterance on your behalf it begins to pray for you why all it took was you getting on your knees and just worship worship isn't always raising your hands and it's time spent with somebody it's a life lived for somebody it's all a form of worship amen so we could look at it then and realize there's there's different levels then of adoption there's different levels of adoption because God's not going to give a 9-year-old boy the same responsibility he gives his dad right God's not going to reveal himself in the same way Jesus at 12 years old even he wasn't realizing what was going to happen at 30 see he was God he knew all things but the fullness of the godhead came into him at that day when the spirit came down in the form of a dove and God emptied himself into him there that was when the anointing came before that he was a son he was perfect he was born but he didn't know all things and he was walking according to the word that he had he knew he was born right he knew he was the the Son of God he knew that he was born for a purpose he knew his flesh was perfect he knew all these things but he didn't live frivolously no he gained favor with God and with men other words he was not cocky about it Cockiness doesn't gain you favor with men I know he wasn't that way but rather he was humble he lived with the spirit of God in him humble as we can look at it and go to Lamentations chapter 3 verse 26 said it is good for a man that it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Lord wait for the Salvation of the Lord it is good for the man to Bear the Yoke in his youth young people it's good for you to be in service to God in your youth you don't have to wait to a certain age and just wonder when but just quietly quietly wait on the salvation of the Lord quietly serve God quietly bear the Yoke you don't have to be up and say well I I've got a gift to play the piano sister Marine you should move over I think I can play the piano now I got it from here I'm 14 years old I've got it no quietly serve and say hey if there's anything I can do just let me know is's there any way I can help God's looking to bring you to a place of adoption even as a young person to live in a mature way in his word it doesn't mean you can't be a young person how did you understand that doesn't mean you can't be a young person and have fun young people sometimes like to stay up half the night and talk and go out and have fun and if I talk about the young guys where I come from they like to step half the night and have pillow fights and I heard later on Belt fights and all kinds of thing that they just boys being boys and out there just having fun but God's saying you don't you don't have to be a 60-year-old man and just come to church and go to bed at 7 and wake up at 6 and everything's okay no you're still a young person you're still young enjoy let no man despise thy youth the scripture says but rather you can still be a young person and be mature in the word that pertains to you Hallelujah nobody who's really led by the spirit of God is going to come to a young sister and talk about where Timothy talks about pastors so you really ought to be in control of your own home and you really ought to no that's not for you that's for the pastor that's his level of adoption to come to as a young person you've got a different level to come to I know I'm just taking it real slow tonight I hope it's all right Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 30 would say even the youths faint and be weary and the young man shall utterly fall that sounds horrible but what it's saying is God knew that you would fall flat on your face God knew as a young man you would fall in your God knew as a young woman that you would make mistakes where you would be down on your face going God I am not even a Christian anymore I've definitely lost it but he says I know it you'll get weary you'll get faint you will utterly fall down on your face he says but they that wait on the Lord shall renew do their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen he's saying there is a way to get back up on your feet wait quietly upon the salvation of the lord it's good in your youth to Bear the Yoke it's good to be in service to God and recognize you're going to make mistakes and that is okay Hallelujah we all say that together I'm going to make mistakes and that's okay Hallelujah let's go on though but I'll wait on the Lord and He will renew my strength oh Hallelujah we don't have to stay there it'll happen but we don't have to stay there man of God even will fall on their face and make mistakes but they don't need to stay there blessed be the name of the Lord 1 Timothy 4:12 says let no man despise thy youth but be th an example of the Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and in Purity another words a young person can even not only this this actually has a two full meaning to it it says that you can be an example and that you should follow after the examples that have gone before you that you should follow after the example of the Believers in word and conversation in charity in spirit in faith in Purity it's not just that old Crank that sits on the pew next to you no it's an example of God it's somebody that has been through some experiences in life and the word of God even says let the older sisters teach the younger sisters Amen Let the older men let them begin to to to to to teach that wisdom to the younger men we need to be able to teach one another we need to be able to exhort one another amen I this is just how God laid it out to me this afternoon so I hope you're with me he says that you can even be a young person could even come to to a place where they can be an example Hallelujah an example not a dictator not look I've got to figure it out just do what I do no an example lives and other people see it says till I come and give attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine he says neglect not the gift that is in thee he's still talking to a young man named Timothy that's to you young people see well I'm not like Timothy I'm not called to be a pastor I'm not called to be a preacher but you have a gift of God unto everyone Ephesians 4 would say is given a measure of Grace according to the gift of God that's within them neglect not the gift that is within thee which is given thee by Prophecy with the laying on of hands and of a preser meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that they that thy profiting may appear to all Hallelujah you want people to notice what God you're doing for God just give yourself to God In God's Time others will see hey he really serves good hey she really serves good take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee as a young person you can have an effect on all those around you you can create an atmosphere in the home you might be just a young boy or young girl how old are you 9 years old 10 years old 11 years old you can create an atmosphere in the home it's not all about squabbling with brothers and sisters and they took my toy and I took their toy and we got these got the toy I want and I want to do this and they're after me and they pull my hair and and he's buing me and but she's doing this to me you can create an atmosphere in the home Hallelujah 2 Timothy 2: 211 says if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work flee youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart Hallelujah but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender Strife let's go to Matthew chapter 4 I got have to turn to it Matthew chapter 4 and verse one as we look at our example here in the Lord Jesus Christ I've taken way too much time already I think I'm still on page one so forgive me Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 it says then was Jesus led of the spirit now we're talking about Born Again Believers once again don't put that off to somebody else say well I'm only 14 years old I'm only 16 I'm only 18 no you're going to receive the new birth very young and God begin to child train you sometimes that's the fault of the oldest generation we look down at young people and go they ain't born again because they ain't like me no they're not going to be like you because they're 16 you're however old you are 60 70 80 32 that's that's how old you are you're going to act like that they're going to act like a 16-year-old an 18-year-old a 20-year-old that's how they're going to be we need to see God manifesting himself in our individual lives according to the measure of Grace he gives us and in Matthew chapter 4 now he begins to write this way Jesus led up the spirit now Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil oh that sounds amazing every Christian's dream let's go out in the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil the spirit of God will lead you to do things sometimes that you're going to sit there by day two and go what am I doing here God's got you there for a reason the next verse says and when he was fasted 40 days and 40 nights oh praise God this is getting better first he's led up by the spirit for purpose to be tempted of the devil and now he says now you're going to wait 40 days and 40 nights don't eat nothing but it was the spirit leading him well the says the only way you can do a spirit a fast like that is if it's the spirit of God that's LED you to do that don't ever try and do that on your own it'll it'll drive you crazy you'll lose your mind but he says it was the spirit of God that led him out there and he says and afterwards he was 100 and then and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made of bread and he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god notice after 40 days after 40 nights he knew the purpose of him being out there was to be tempted but God had to get him to such a place so that we could know that even the weakest of Christians could defeat the enemy with the word of God Amen and he got him right out there onto the backside of the desert for all of this time and took all of his strength out of him till he could not rely upon the human flesh though it was perfect though it was born right though it didn't have any flaws he still said you cannot rely upon that whatsoever because I've got Sons and Daughters coming that you are going to be their high priest and you need to be able to be touched by the feeling of their infirmities you need to be tempted in all manner like they are that when you and I are in our weakest condition we can still overcome Hallelujah the word of God my my my it showed that the weakest Christian can defeat Satan just with the words Jesus had powers he could have smoked Satan he had the power of the Holy Ghost within him but the way any way that he wanted to he could have done it but he didn't use it he just took the word and defeated him with it is written it is written the word of God will defeat the Devil any time any place anywhere under any circumstances the word of God will defeat the Devil it is it it is able to defeat him under any circumstances and I'm going to say it this way with or without the New Birth the word of God does not lose its power but rather if you'll have faith in the word of God and come against the enemy with the word that is the kind of faith that God will recognize and fill with his spirit because the spirit always comes to the word hallelujah how do I get born again just stay with the word of God and have faith in it and continually produce that to the devil and God will recognize that oh blessed be the name of the Lord and you can't just say one word unless God you can't just say you can't say one word to God unless he knows it the weakest of saints makes the devil tremble praise be to God and you're his children you have fully when you have fully with all of your hearts each one of you fully laid your life before God and said God mold me and make me the kind of Christian that's been talked about here tonight and I want to give my life that way just take all things out of my life that's wrong that's the way I want to be by your grace Lord I'll live every day for you watching for my life to pattern right up with the Bible requirements that's the way we ought to come to the Waters of baptism that's the way we ought to come to repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost that's a promise if we could come that way and say Lord I want my whole life to be pattern and I'm going to stay right behind the word until you come and back it up Hallelujah that's exactly what Jesus was doing here he was saying he had all kinds of power but he said I'm not going to use it it is also written Hallelujah the devil taking him up then on a into the holy city Seth him on the Pinnacle of the temple and he said if thou be the Son of God and he began to quote to him more of the word cast thyself down for it is written if the angels are given charge over thee and and and and and and in in their hands they will bear thee up lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone but he said it is also written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God hallelujah even in his weakest State he knew who he was even in his weakest State he had faith in what the word of God said about him saints of God ought to be such an encouragement to us that even in our weakest condition no matter how weak we are how downtrod and how depressed and how horrible it gets we ought to have faith in what the word of God says we are Moses was able to have faith in what the word of God said about him even when he come up to the Red Sea and he's sitting there two million people around him murmuring and complaining saying Moses you brought us up here to die we got a water before us mountains on the sides we got the Egyptians on their back wasn't there enough graves in Egypt why did you bring us out here all of that going on and he realized God I'm the deliverer what did he say to the people before he ever even prayed to God if you look it up in the scripture when you go home before he ever even prayed to God and said Lord what must I do he turned to the people and he said be still this day you will see the salvation of the Lord he had confidence in what the word had told him to do he didn't understand understand how because he immediately turned right back around and said Lord what do I do and God said why are you crying unto me speak and go forward lift up the rod and stretch out your hand and part The Waters from east to west and walk across I told you to meet me on the mountain meet me on the mountain Hallelujah when God gives you Revelation he expects you to live it he gives you Grace to fulfill it and we know that Satan tempted him again in all the these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me he offered to forfeit all of the kingdoms of the earth to him then he saith Jesus saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou worship and the devil leaveth him and behold the Angels Came and ministered unto him God will put you through trial and through Temptations through moldings that sometimes see unbearable but he won't give you more than you can bear go with me to Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 verse 38 scri the scripture in Hebrews chapter 11 talks about The Heroes of Faith and all the things that they've been through and how they stood by faith in God says in verse 38 of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith they obtained favor with God but Reed not the promise for God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect Hallelujah in other words complete that word there they could not be complete without us coming this way God didn't put you on this Earth too late you might say I'm just a young person you might be just a young child the rapture's coming any day God didn't put you on this Earth too late you're here and he put you in a home to give you the best chance for you to receive him he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it and he doesn't care how you get it Oh my he doesn't care as long as you get it we ought not to care so I just it's got to be at a pray it's got to be a certain brother it's got to be a certain this it's got to be a certain that no get that out of our minds the carnality of it say no it's got to be Jesus and me that's the common denominator but how you get it whether it's at an altar praise God whether it's in the quiet of your prayer closet whether you're out for a walk around a riverbed and you find come down to your knes of God and God comes and meets you there wherever it may be it might be on the job working you might be working wherever you need to work and God comes on the scene and you just begin to think about him I got to work but I got God on my mind and you begin to just think on him let him draw nigh Hebrews chapter 12 to carry on it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with such a greater cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin with th so easy easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus he is our example looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher Hallelujah it wasn't just that it was something he started he's able to finish what he started he's the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him inured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of God in other words he has full power and Authority for considering him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds other words consider what he went through he was tempted in all manner like we are tempted consider what he went through consider the contradiction of Sinners consider the things that he had to go through being perfect and yet he took all sin upon himself and took it back onto the devil lest you be wearied and faint in your minds ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord now we're coming back to the tutor despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he lets them do whatsoever they please is that what it says no he says for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth Hallelujah if ye endure chastening God then dealth with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof are all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons other words if you refuse the chastening of the Lord he can't deal with you as a son he cannot give you any more Revelation he cannot show you anymore he cannot bring you any higher in Heights with him he can't show you any more love if you won't accept what he sends you he says for as much furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not WAP rather in the be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live we've all been there as sons and as daughters we gave our fathers reverence and we respected them when they corrected us and when they spanked us and when they grounded us and when they put us in our rooms and when they did all these things to us that we thought man it's so hard I'm not enjoying this but it was for a purpose it made you out to be who you are today the kind of person that helped to mold your character in The Natural but he says how much more to the one who's able to mold your character in the spirit how much more to the father of the spirits that could bring you life Everlasting for verily for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that he that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the presentence seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yith Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby amen there's a scripture that says that the the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared with the joy that shall be re with the glory that shall be revealed in US amen and I just want to say this to you that does not diminish the sufferings you're going through that doesn't diminish the hardness of the trials those trials are still difficult those trials are still hard the things that you're going through it's still difficult I think a brother now and going for for knee surgery that's not easy that's hard that's something that's difficult to go through but that even isn't worthy to be compared with the fact that God has a glory that he desires to reveal in you that is so great that the former things will not even come into mind Hallelujah the chastisement of this current time this the this 70 years and then it's Grace after that is not even worthy to be compared with what God has in store for you Jesus was born a perfect birth if we could take a step back here for a minute his flesh was not born by sexual desire he it was completely God God created himself in the womb of Mary you can go ahead and read the message book called The revelation of Jesus Christ it's at the beginning of the church age book he says that God created himself in the womb of in the womb of a woman and overshadowed her just as he overshadowed his first creation and brought it to brought to pass the spoken words so did he there with the Lord Jesus Christ but even in that Perfection God put him through a testing period because the spirit that was in him the Holy Spirit Jesus did not need to be born again are you with me Jesus did not need to be born again he was born right the first time but still his baptism was was a washing was like a washing of the sacrifice it was not like the baptism of Acts chapter 2 where he had to repent he was perfect but furthermore the spirit that came down on the on the on that baptism was the anointing of the fullness of the attribute of God as even brother Bram says questions and answers 1964 he says now the pillar of fire is the logos that went out of God the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God when God become come into the form where he could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that that went forth its condescending coming down God the Father the logos that was up over Israel he was holy he could not bear the sin there was there had to be a blood offering right there in Eden then that logos become flesh and dwelt Among Us and where this logos dwelt in a human body which that body was the sacrifice are you with me still when man was when man was made in the image of God and when man come when God come down in the image of man to redeem man and brought man and God together and Heaven and Earth hugged and kissed each other God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship when the Loos became flesh and dwelt Among Us when was it that God came down and spoke and said this is my beloved Son it was that day on the Riverside when after he' been baptized and he come out and he stood there and the fullness of God the attribute of the fullness of of God came down and rested on him then he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell that was after years of testing years of making sure years of trying years of proving brother goes on that same quote where he says God for 30 years proved him then he says then he gave him three years of hard trial that's largely what we have recorded in the gospels 3 years of hard trial then at the end of that hard trial when he seen that his son was about the father's business then Mount Transfiguration he took Peter James and John the witnesses went up on the top of the mountain there God performed the law of adoption they looked up they saw Jesus and his clothes shining his lightning and the cloud overshadowed him a voice come out of the cloud and said this is my beloved Son now it wasn't just in whom I'm pleased to dwell it said hear ye him Hallelujah there was a pillar of fire let me ask you this where was the pillar of fire we could actually read it in Matthew chapter 7 17 maybe we won't just to save time but Matthew chapter 17 it talks about this this occasion where now Jesus is brought up on the mountain and they come and his he was transfigured before them and Moses and Elijah appeared and his face is said sha like the sun and and and and his rements were shining as well and as as he was there and and we know Peter spoke up and said let's make three Tabernacles one for Elijah one for John and one for G or one for Moses and one for Jesus let's make ourselves three Tabernacles and let's have a wonderful let's make a denomination out of this really is what he's saying let's let's make sure everybody knows but then when they looked up again when the voice spoke and they fell on their face and when they looked up again they saw one it was Jesus and over him overshadow ing him was a cloud that was there as there was a cloud that had over overshadowed him and behold the voice spoke out of the cloud and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him other words there it was at The Showdown just like it was in the first Showdown where there was a pillar of fire that came down and consumed the sacrifice and there was a cloud about the size of the man hand now you have again you have a pillar of fire and you have a cloud you say but where was the pillar of fire brother Andrew it was in him in him was the fullness of the attribute of God and what's the lust the pillar of fire what's the pillar of fire it's the fullness of the attribute of God the attribute of the fullness of God sorry it was right there remember Colossians chap 1: 19 says for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell it was in him it was shining out so that even his face Shone as the glory of the sun if we go to John chapter 16 are you still with me is this okay if we take a few more minutes tonight if you ever need to stand up and Shake Yourself you won't bother me I'll just take it as you're praising God John chapter 16:1 15 says all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall SW it unto you a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith a little while remember if you go back I know I didn't read it but if you go go back to Matthew chapter 17 you find out Jesus told them don't tell anybody this who was there Peter James John don't tell anybody this there was something the three of them that they recognized when he's saying yet a little while I go away and yet a little while I'll come back he began to recognize I I I think I'm understanding what you're talking about they seen him glorified God had revealed something to them but to the rest of them they're wondering what's he talking about God will reveal himself to you in the right time in the right season it wasn't the time for the rest of them to know but it was time for Peter James and John to know in John chapter 6 and verse 63 he says it is the spirit that quickeneth and the flesh profiteth nothing amen the spirit quickeneth but the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so Jesus begins to lay out as as as we we were speaking on earlier stay and have faith in the word the spirit will come to that because it's my words that I'm speaking unto you they are spirit and they are life in Christ the Myster of God reveal he says but by Revelation that God has revealed his word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses himself through you hallelujah it's not us trying to express the word but rather it's God trying to express himself through you John 14:23 says Jesus answered and said unto them if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and he will come unto him and make and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him if you'll do what the word says we will love you he's saying and I will come and make my Abode with you he that loveth me not and keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father which sent me Hallelujah see I I don't speak anything this this now this is John chapter 14 John chapter 16 this is after Mount Transfiguration this is after he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him he's saying listen the words that I'm speaking they're not my words but it's the father that's speaking hear the words of the father hear what he's speaking unto you he's saying but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and he will bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you amen peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid if you go down into John 16: 27 he says for the father himself loveth you because you love me and have believed that I come out from God I come forth from the father I am and am come into the world and again I leave the world and go to the father he say listen you you you you you love me you love you love what you see in me because you love me the father loves you because he's he's beginning to express exactly who he is and recognizing that the mount Transfiguration it was a showdown it was something that was happening it was God proving himself God only brings it to a showdown to prove who he is not to prove who you are and who this person is and lift up somebody but God wants to prove himself God wants to perform brother brandham would say he wants to perform his word in you he wants to bring it to pass and now he's coming to a place where he's beginning to express to his disciple Christ being our example saying listen I and the father are one well the words that I speak are the father's words this is what it is to be an adopted son this is what it is to have the spirit of God living and walking and express pring itself through you cuz he's not saying this is just for me no he says when the Holy Ghost is come he will also bring to remembrance all the things that I spoke to you what did he speak to you just the letters and red no the whole thing that was the word of God and then he bring in our day through a prophet and brought the word of God for our day and he says I'll bring that to your remembrance by the Holy Ghost how could I ever remember I got 12200 tapes approximately and I've listened listen to them over and over but how will I ever remember all that you don't have to it's there in the Eternal Realms of God and when you need it he'll bring it back to your remembrance and cause you to say something that all of a sudden you're left going that wasn't me oh praise be to God why because it's him in you Christ the hope of glory he says when you have when you can present the token with your prayer what's the token the token today is the spirit of God it's the life that was in the blood amen back in the Old Testament it was the blood of the Lamb that was upon the doorpost upon the lentil but today it's not the blood because we don't have any of the literal blood but it's the life that was in the blood it's the Holy Spirit when that is in your life he says when you have the token to present with your prayer it shows that you have fully come into obedience to the whole word of God you cannot look at that carnally cuz as soon as you look at that carnally you're going to look at this and say but I don't know the whole word of God but all that he's revealed to me I've come into obedience to that's the token and you present that with your prayer he says then then you and the world word what's the word Christ you and the word are one you're only asking for the thing that you are when you begin when you and the word become one when you can present the token with your prayer and you could pray Lord I know that by your stripes I'm Healed you're only asking for what you are heal when you're asking and saying Lord I desire peace in my home you're only asking for what you are when you're asking for your family you're only asking for what you are when you're asking for Revelation you're only asking for what's already in you he says then when you and the word becomes one every promise glory to God every every promise is yours then he makes these three word statements he says it obeys you the promises obey you says then you want to watch what you want to do you shouldn't put your hand in a fire and just saywell see me do it oh no see but if there's something in that fire I got to reach for it'll obey me Hallelujah in other words don't be tricked by all the firew walking and going on that's just the devil's show but he says you don't just put your hand in there God's not a show he's not interested in just out there for somebody's entertainment but if something fell in the fire just like Paul an adopt his son he gets out there on the on that island can't remember what the island was called The Malta but he's out there and they're getting a fire going and he gets go goes out and picks up sticks and he comes back he throws the sticks in the fire and a Viper comes out and latches onto his hand what does he do he just shakes it off and goes and picks up more sticks and they start going this guy he's a witch he's something else that thing didn't affect him but then when the word begin to come out of his mouth they to realize this man ain't no witch this is a Son of God this is somebody that has power and his body has been brought into subjection by The Same Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead that it didn't matter how much venom that thing pumped into him he said even if serpent bite thee it won't harm you even if I drink any deadly thing it won't harm you are you with me he says watch the inspiration then he says that's the way it strikes you if you're sick that's the way it strikes you if you're Afflicted something that's revealed to you and you see it that it's been revealed then you speak up if you're sick and all of a sudden God reveals to you you're healed then you speak up and you jump up and say I'm Healed he says then God tells you what to do rise up and start walking amen that's that's it it's all over then you can do it that way that's the way God does it when you see God manifested through yourself other words it ain't you doing it it's not based on your ability but rather when the Holy Ghost In You latches a hold of the word of God and begins to realize I don't have to live the way I've been living I don't have to walk the way I've been walking it doesn't matter how many years this has gone on God's word says I'm Healed it's over Hallelujah we got a wonderful example of a man named John Ryan who went for months and months proclaiming after the prophet of pray for him going out saying praise God I can see praise God I can see praise God I'm Healed praise God I can see extra extra Read All About It praise God I'm Healed blind as could be but one day Hallelujah sitting there in the barber chair it becomes such a reality in his heart as the barber was trying to mock him and make fun of of him God brought it to a showdown to show it was God not just John Ryan it was God in a man saying I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed and he jumped out of that barber chair and went running out shaving cream all down his face Barber's frock on him saying praise the Lord I can see oh hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we're too afraid that maybe it won't happen too afraid that maybe something won't happen God begins to spark something in our heart we begin to put water on it and push it down and push it down because we're too afraid it won't happen it didn't happen last time it won't happen this time if God's trying to show you something stand up in the name of the Lord amen if you're feeding on the word faith comes by hearing see it depends on what you're feeding on that will give you the faith to rise up and claim What the Lord Has for you Jesus had 18 years to feed on the right things yeah he had 18 years silent years from 12 to 30 years old what was he doing he found pleasure with God God was pleased with him he grew in favor with God and we find why why would that be because he was feeding on the right things he was meditating on the word he was making sure that he was he was feeding on what was right and praying and staying in touch with the Lord oh my you and I have received a portion of God in this in the seed form by pred destination but when he fills you with his Spirit which is the tutor that comes into you he wants to teach you so he can anoint you for the job he has for you because adoption of sons is to be positionally placed in Christ Jesus so what's the tutor doing then he's teaching he's trying to mold you for the purpose that God has for you we know that to be born again that's the minimum requirements to go in a Rapture but that's the minimum requirements God has a purpose for you God has a purpose for you in this life and God has a purpose for you beyond this life let me tell you this Saints don't ever be scared oh my sometimes it becomes such a place in our age in our day especially for young people where you get the feeling I don't have a purpose who am I the church has a pastor there's a piano player there's a guitar player there's a bass player there's there's a deacon there's a trustee there's a sound tech I don't do anything for God I'm I'm I'm not made for anything God has a purpose for you and it might not be playing and and and and and singing and doing certain things you might say I can't even sing I couldn't hold a tune in a bucket brother Andrew I don't know anything about a bumblebee in a jar I don't know nothing about that I can't make any good sounds like that but we find that God has a purpose for you because he said know ye not that the saint shall judge the Earth God has a purpose for you to be his bride God has a purpose for you to rule Ru and reign with him God has a purpose for you to be there as his bride adoring for her husband coming down on of Heaven God has a place for you maybe your purpose isn't really on this side very much but on the other side we got the parable of the 11th Hour worker there was some that came early in the day some that came in the midday some that came in at the 11th hour and they they all got the same pay but the the early ones being to complain hey these people that didn't do very much they got the same pay what's up with this we should get more or they should get less something like this because they didn't do as much as we did but the master said no is it not lawful for me you agreed to a wage what's what's what's the parable we agreed to a wage I will give you eternal life the promise was to them in there back there in Ephesus the promise is to us today the promise is to you whether you've been serving the lord for your whole entire life and you've gone on and labored and labored and labored and seems like I just can't go on anymore or whether you were just born and God comes in a Rapture and you're gone in the Rapture oh praise be to God it doesn't matter God says whether you're the first hour worker or the 11th Hour worker the the the the payment is the same oh praise be to God Jesus had to feed on the right thing sometimes we're so afraid of saying the wrong thing that we filter everything coming out of our mouth so that's not a bad thing brother Andrew the Bible says that a man that can har that can a man that can Bridle his tongue is perfect in all of his ways didn't Jesus say that it's not what goes into a man that defiles a man that what comes out of a man that defiles him therefore we ought to be really careful what we say we ought to be really careful what goes out of us what's in the outlet and sometimes we get so bound up in what's going on the outlet that we forget to filter the inlet I want to just say this to you tonight I want to encourage you sometimes we got to take the filter off of the outlet and put it on the inlet stop trying to filter everything going out if you'd filter what came in if what was coming in was clean if what was coming in was God if what was coming in was the word then what was going out would be God what was going out would be the word why because it's what comes in and what makes you what you are and what goes out will be just that but if it's coming in all kinds of junk and all kinds of internet and all kinds of other things that just wasting our time and all of a sudden we get around the saints of God and they're talking about God and we're struggling to try and think of the right thing to say because there's all kinds of garbage in our brains why because we're filtering the outlet we're trying to legalistically live the word but instead if we try and filter the inlet say God I just want to feed on your word just want to meditate on that day and night what will come out will be easy you can't help but talk about God when all you're thinking about is God you can't help but talk about the message when all you're listening to is the message you can't help but talk about the Bible when all you're reading is the Bible I saying you can't read other books and you can't listen to other things there's good things out there that'll help you help you understand and apply in daily life but let it come into continuity with the word would help us just be able to let go let go and let God have his way I just need to skip over some things here God told Moses that he gave him the land we love preaching on this every place the soul of your foot would tread I give it you right praise God every place every promise in the book is yours every chapter every verse every line praise be to God ah what's a promise wasn't feeding on it I don't really know what the promises are can't think of one off the top of my head we like that right every promise in the book is mine wherever The Souls of your feet shall tread well then that means you got to walk around in the word that means you got to be in the word that means you got to read it that means you got to pray about it means you got to seek God for it every place they had to fight for every inch of it it's not going to be easy Saints you'll have have to fight for every inch of it praise God I'm Healed now you got to fight for every inch of it so do we have to fight for V of it it isn't something to be babied and petted and around like that and say well I'll take you over there see what you think about it and you just pass your opinion that's no way to come he says come with a determination come that you're going to stay there till it's over stay there till God answers and vindicates a man that believes in God can see the presence of God feel the presence of God sense the presence of God and know that he's there this is in God's provided way for this day he says he he can know that he's there he is here to answer everything that he made promis for in his day who can do that a man that believes in God that believes the word in other words someone that receives what God sends he says they cry then cry till you get it hold on to him don't leave if you have to stay day and night God won't want his children to listen to intellectual speeches I hope I haven't been an intellectual speech tonight God doesn't want his children to listen intellectual speeches he says he wants them to cry out for it till the promise is Vindicated praise be to God God wants to give you the Holy Ghost God wants you to cry out until you get it Israel at one point in time was fighting battles outside of the promised land Israel at one point in time they were wondering in the wilderness right they wandered for 40 years down there in the wilderness because of their sin because of their lack of of faith that they couldn't have faith in the word of God the 10 spies brought back an evil report God said fine I'll let you all die off here and as they wandered around the Wilderness there came up against one by the name of aab Bashan and he was a great the the the biggest man that ever lived in the Bible and he had a great big army and he had all these things and he began to afflict them but they were able to overcome them because they could look at Moses and they could see that as long as the word of God was there as long as the prophet of the age was there the word for their day they could overcome by the word without the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah they weren't in the promised land yet they were in the wilderness they hadn't received the promised land is a type of the Holy Ghost they hadn't received that yet they were still out wondering and getting Sanctified and washing the water of the word was still going on but as long as they could see the word as long as they stayed with that Prophet they were victorious it was the time when they said we don't need you anymore Moses we're going to go take the land ourselves what happened they were horribly defeated because they got out from behind the word but as long as they had the word for their day there with them they were victorious when the amalekites came against them they were victorious and you might even tonight be looking saying brother Andrew I don't think I'm born again I don't think I'm there yet let me encourage you you're able to defeat Giants without the Holy Ghost oh that gets quiet but that's the truth because that is the power of the word of God if you could just stay with the message and stay with the word and say it might not be a reality to me but God made it real and he will one day bring me to it and those giants can't bother you aab Basham was in the wilderness and he was a giant sometimes we underestimate the power of God do we really have a revelation that God is God do we really have a revelation that Jesus is God that he's the one Hallelujah that he's able to defeat the enemy if we'll just have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ he cleanses you from all sin sometimes we try and put it off way off in something mystical and something way up there yonder in the stars and it's got to be some wonderful birth and God's going to take me up and put me off somewhere no it's right down in a simple common family that God hides himself oh praise be to God I hope you're catching what I'm preaching tonight but when they got into canaan's land when they crossed the river Jordan the reason for their fight changed it changed their whole purpose of being it renewed their strength there was a will Beyond themselves that they could fight longer even than a day because it was their their their inheritance that they were fighting for it wasn't them fighting anymore but now it was there them in the Holy Ghost that was fighting it was them in the promised land they were in the land flowing with milk and honey they could fight and not be wary Joshua was given the promise saying you won't lose one so when he lost one he said something's wrong they're sit in the camp Hallelujah we ought not to lose one if we're losing them something's wrong there's unbelief somewhere Hallelujah and if it takes we got to get it out we got to get it out but we need to get right with God oh my it changed their whole purpose of being it changed they wasn't fighting for themselves anymore they weren't just fighting to survive they were Overcomers an 80-year-old man could say give me the most difficult Mountain and that Amaze you I trust you know your Bible very well as they would go there and they would take it and they all of them would come to the promised land Caleb would come to Joshua 80 years old and say I want Mount Hein the Land of the Giants give me my Mountain maybe Joshua look at him and say oh well we'll give you some men to fight with you we'll let you have this well you know you sure you want that let's give you some easier land maybe no Jay Caleb said I don't want nothing easier I want my Mountain cuz my soul The Souls of my feet have tread upon that mountain don't you remember Joshua that's where we got in the valley of Esa we got those big grapes right down there by Mount heon we were right there and we were right oh we I want those grapes again I want to know what it's like I want to live in that land praise be to God you might have had the Holy Ghost on your flesh you might have had the Holy Ghost on your spirit but if you get that kind of an attitude like Caleb say I don't care what it takes I want to live in that land I want to live in a land that flows with milk and I want a taste of the promises of God I want it so that those promises obey me so whatever I say come on church it's not about your fighting abilities it's about the Holy Ghost in you it's not about what you can do for God it's about what he's already done for you amen it's the word of God that defeats the enemy and the Holy Spirit In You changes what you're fighting for it changes your whole desires it changes your whole purpose of being you might be fighting something else tonight but inside the promised land you're not a Survivor you're an overcomer you're more than an overcomer because he said I have be of good cheer he says in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world that makes you more than an overcomer oh praise be to God he says I think I've that that we've made many mistakes by looking into the word and say God said this and we fail to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program think about that he says this is where the church has made so many mistakes they look into the world and said God said this and God said that but we fail to find the direct Revelation for our life to fit that program and when we find that then it's going to happen oh praise be to God when you find yourself in the world what is it a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you then it's going to happen for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed into the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren we look at Christ our example and all the things he had to go through and all of the trying and the 30 years and the three years of hard testing to finally get up there to mount Transfiguration but it wasn't so that he could stand there alone it was so that he could be the firstborn among many Brethren so that you could be conformed Into His Image so that you could come into his likeness brother B would say but the predestinated will will hear and will be ready for the Rapture the Royal Seed of Abraham like with like Faith to Abraham's will hold to the word with him for they are predestinated together Hallelujah you're predestinated together as we said that Loos that came down out of heaven and dwelt in Christ Jesus the fullness of the attribute of the attribute of the fullness of God this logos that was in him which was the the spirit of God the anointing this is from questions and answerers 64 he says the anointing though the S through through the Sanctified Grace of the blood has brought many sons of God which is Anointed with the same logos oh praise be to God that in Christ the fullness of God dwelt but we know that the brother BR would say but all that was in Christ he poured into the church that there on in Acts chapter 2 when they came in the day of Pentecost was fully come that same logos that was in its fullness in Christ came down and broke itself into many pieces and went by part but what Christ had in fullness you have in part so let me ask you this God is an infinite God is that right he's an infinite God in other words there is no ending there is no beginning he's Eternal he's infinite he knows all things he's all powerful so let me ask you this if you have a portion of infinite what exactly do you have it's infinite half of infinite is infinite a tenth of infinite is infinite a millionth of infinite is infinite a billionth of infinite is infinite a trillionth infinite a quadrillionth googillion of infinite is still infinite it's still infinite no matter how many times you divide it up you divide it up that's why he could take just Five Loaves and two fish and just start breaking it was infinite it would have never failed that's why he could stand there and say how many squirrels do you have need of today I have need of three then tell me exactly where they'll come you speak whatever you say why because he'd come through the testing and through the trying and it wasn't something fantastic he was just out hunting he was just trying to get back to Camp one day trying to get back before the snowstorm snowed him in he thought I'm not going to make it there in time but something touched him on the shoulder and said turn around and come and walk with me he said Lord maybe this is my end and he be to walk with the Lord that way it wasn't some great big meeting and something where happened it was just the Simplicity it wasn't a Simplicity of a common folk named Haddy Wright that was sat there one day and he's being to tell her about the squirrels being spoken into existence and she said that is nothing but the truth and he said the she said the right thing and the Simplicity of that humble home with her boy snickering over in the other room and the Holy Spirit come down and said say whatever you will it'll happen in the Simplicity of common people God hides himself that same logos that was in Christ it's in you if we could ever just get the revelation of exact ly what we are brother Bron would say when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace comes on the scene and brings to pass the projection of the Divine love that's what we are made to be we're made to be projectors of God's love that God there's three Greek words I'll just close with this agapo love Agape Love Is God God's Own love agapo love is when that love is projected and God projected his love the projection of God's love was Jesus Christ that in him that that that that that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son was it was a projection of the love of God and it brought Sovereign Grace on the scene what is it by faith you are saved through Grace it brought the grace of God that one projection of Love Brought thousands of years of Grace to anyone that would believe the power of the love of God and now he says I've put that same love in you because if you've got the Holy Ghost if you've got the lust that little portion of God in you you've got a portion of agapo love the word agapetos is the adjective of that same word word that means that is the the recipient or the object of that love projected that's why he could say beloved that word beloved is agapetos beloved you are now the sons of God other words I have projected my love down to the world and it came out as his attributes in Sons and Daughters of God you are the very object of God's love and you are to be a reflection or an expression of the love of God we're not to do the work God's going to do the work because when Divine love is projected it brings Sovereign Grace on the scene not one of us has anything to do with Sovereign Grace it's him he's the one that has Sovereign Grace unmar Grace but that we could project love to our children project love to our brother and sister project love to a sinner and it brings the grace of God on the scene to bring to pass the object of that love Christ was our example of that that he desired that he was sent forth into the world so I didn't come here to destroy I came to save I didn't come here to do away with the law I came here to fulfill the law I came here so that you could be saved to give my life for you that's our example let's have the musicians come if we know that song by The Power of your love you know that song sister love always is looking for something to be to be projected to he would say the same holy ghost that saved the lutherans the same holy ghost that Sanctified the methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave and there'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we live in another day under this tomorrow Lord will we want to speak on Mount Zion what is it you are com under Mount Zion that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things than the blood of Abel the blood of abble brought condemnation but the blood of Jesus Christ brought salvation because there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus let's stand to our feet Lord I come to you let my heart be [Music] changed renew flowing from the gra that I found [Music] in and Lord I've come to know the witnesses I see in me will be Stripped Away by the power of [Music] Lord let [Applause] your to your as I wa I Rise and I will you your spirit

lot to think on knowing there'd be a service in the morning bringing you all the way through the Life of Christ showing you the example that he was to us whether you're a young person or an old person whether you're middle-aged or wherever you consider yourself to be that's irrelevant to God what's relevant is that in you is a seed in you is a desire to serve God in you is a desire for more of God maybe tonight the Lord's been speaking to you and you've realized I need more I need a closer walk with God I need a new birth I need adoption I need to come more in more in tune with with the Lord I need to be more in touch I need to spend more time in prayer I need to allow God to move in my life and you just want to raise your hands to him and say Lord I'm sorry that I've been so distracted I'm

Lord Redemption by Blood his Precious [Music] Blood is the greatest story for Redemption that's what seven8 angs in a cloud they testify my redeemer is no longer dead he's risen and he's coming back for you and [Applause] me amen that was wonderful and I'm only going to talk about one thing it was near the end and he was talking about in the wilderness and I'd already written it and then he wrote it and then he said it and in the wilderness they were surviving why because they weren't in the land of promise he said I'll take you there I'll get you there safe so all they were doing they were walking on other people's territory it didn't belong to them and God tried to make peace all the way through he said you'll pay your way you'll do what's right by them but if they come after you I'll take you through and he did it time and time again but I'll tell you what it set him up for an appetite to not just survive but to start overcoming amen that the things that have been bothering them they got to see a day where those were no longer there and he showed it with the Egyptians but then he said the amorites the jebusites the moabites there's battles they won and then they went later and they finished the job you started it we're going to finish it and you know sometimes the problem is that we're surviving because we're not in the land of promise we're in a place of our own choosing we're in a place of our own thinking we're in a place of our own doing amen and he says if you can get into the word if you can find your place that's what brother Andrew said if you can find your place in the word that's when every promise is yours and that's when it will happen amen he said how can God move you forward if you're not living with what he's given you amen it's a good time to check up this evening Amen to say am I surviving because I'm just on the way or am in am I in a position to overcome because I'm in the land of promise and that only comes by the Holy Ghost anden if you have the Holy Ghost every promise in the book is yours amen let's just sing that song this evening but you know what he said more of you let's sing more of you amen because the answer answer is always more of him less of me says I've had it all tried it all done it all thought it all that didn't work but when he comes on the scene when he's in the house when his word has preeminence things work out amen and so the answer is never fight more it's get more of him get more of his will more of his word more of his way more of his character more of his thoughts more of his nature amen and let the rest of it fall Away by the wayside amen let's just sing this as a prayer this evening amen we've heard the word it was wonderful I could preach an hour and never touch the high points of what we we heard tonight but it's got to be in here and me you take what he said tonight what the word has said what the Holy Spirit has spoken to our lives and each one may be something different but you say Lord I want that I want what I've heard whether as he said you're 60 and you've had a a relationship with God for 40 years or whether you're 14 and you're seeking a greater relationship I love what he said it's one thing to meet it's another thing to know amen I want to know him more and more and more and that means I need more of him I need more time with him amen let's sing this together
