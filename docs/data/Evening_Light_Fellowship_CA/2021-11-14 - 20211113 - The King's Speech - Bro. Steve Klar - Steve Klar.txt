that you've got something wonderful going and happening here in the house of god when things get tough and you know you see the same brothers preach all the time to you and it seems a time of monotony and whatever else don't forget that this is a special place for worship we've been a few places and and you know something where this it's not always the same it's different everywhere you go but you

drive a nice car we gain it all looks great on the outside but then we lose our soul friends we got to make it amen i'm not against it friends if you have it all but let me tell you we've got to make it put christ first in your life amen praise the lord let's stand together and i want to read from john's gospel john chapter 8 amen praise the lord amen amen praise the lord hallelujah john chapter 8 and we're going to read from verse 42. amen john chapter 8 verse 42 and jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would have you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i from myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my speech even because he cannot hear my word amen ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father he will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you conceiveth me of sin and if i see the truth why do ye not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god lord bless the reading of his word we can have our seats amen now you're all wondering what brother steve what exactly are you going to preach today [Laughter] praise the name of the lord in matthew chapter 11 verse 15 it says he that hath an ear let him hear now friends today i know we're sitting together and we have uh hearing and we can hear god's voice but i want to i want to speak to you around the thought the king's speech the king speech now as i prayed earlier i want you to put on a spiritual mind this evening and i desire that you take the word of god and place it in your life personally i don't want it just to be words i want it to be words that can be applied to our very individual lives and and so the word of god it is the king's speech to you and i you know god has got a language can you say amen and the bible is written in a code it's written in a language and as you study the scriptures you begin to realize it has symbols and it has numbers and there's parables jesus talks many parables but we realize very quickly that there's only one way that we can understand the scriptures or we can have faith to believe the scriptures and that has to be by the decoding of the holy spirit in our lives can you say amen with all without the holy spirit in our lives we can study it many great men before us have studied theologians in fact the bible is the number one seller on the market this is a book to read there are many commentaries and and there's many men that are standing before people even this evening and they're declaring a gospel but it the word of god can only be revealed to those that have his own nature his own spirit his own likeness and so today in this hour we are a privileged people and i want you to look at one another because sometimes we get calming to one another i want you to notice to one another you are a prize you are the botan uh prize the one that has been bought by the blood of jesus christ so never neglect one another or treat not one another blindly because the life of jesus christ is on the inside of each and every one of you and it takes that life that is inside us being able to study the word of god to begin to read it and understand it you remember in the scriptures there there was uh you know there's peter and the disciples around jesus and and they begin to to to uh talk with jesus and finally jesus said to him who do men say that i am now that's a question that i believe that jesus is asking every single one of us who do you say that i am and you know many had interpretations of who jesus was some said he was elias and they begin to talk about other prophets and the different things that was declared but peter he begot under inspiration and remember it was not peter's inspiration it was a special anointing friends it was something that burnt within his bosom and he said these words thou art the christ the son of the living gods now those were words and the disciples around me and over with peter they said whoa that those are strong words but the lord jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but your father which is in heaven and this evening it has got to be our father who is in heaven we we give him that name our father who is in heaven who begins to reveal to us the scriptural truths begins to show us now the words that brother branham preached to us would be just letters on a page from a fellow from kentucky if the word of god would not have shown us the truth for the hour if the lord had not you know showed us that it was the very word of revelations chapter 1 that one that stood there and gave the word to us who was that christ jesus and so the symbols and and the things that we read in the scriptures we we study them not with human understanding we study them with supernatural understanding when you're reading the message it is as by supernatural understanding you begin to see your place in the scriptures brother brano brought us a message so that we could see our place in the scriptures and when we read it it's not a textbook it's not something we put to memory you know it's good to do memory verses but it's not just something that we do in memory so that we can be like others and spout off interesting truths know it's something we put to our heart and we begin to live by it's not something we just analyze people like to analyze but not message believers not those that are born by the spirit of god they don't sit to analyze they put it to work in their lives precept upon priests line upon line they begin to live this gospel what good is this gospel what good would all of god done for us if we cannot live out what we've been hearing what we've been listening to when we're in our jobs and we're in the markets and and we're in the schools what good would all of god ever done for us if we're not living out what he set forth and so friends today i i just want to catch just a a a a word or a thought i want to catch the thoughts of god behind the words in the message approach to god in 1955 brother branham says this amen i i've enjoyed preaching tonight yesterday i was i was stranger today i'm a friend and praise the lord i've enjoyed myself tonight he says this so just polishing and joining church and reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of books and authors and so forth doesn't mean you're converted just because you sleep in the garage doesn't mean you're a car and just because you come to church and you sit here and you listen to brothers talk doesn't mean that you're a christian and reading again brother brahma says because you have an intellectual mind that makes you have a mental conception that there is a god somewhere still you're not a christian yet until actually you become personal in contact with christ do you see how important it is we need to have that personal contact with christ that changes your heart and nature then you become a child of god the all things has passed away and all things become new again hallelujah with that spirit the nature of christ inside of us we need friends the holy spirit more than ever in this hour if you don't got it you've got to get it amen we were talking this morning about coming you know through justification getting clean all up and through sanctification and getting all washed and filled you know all clean like a bird and a bird bath but friends you've got to come all the way in christ and receive the free gift of the holy spirit in your life it's because the holy spirit is what quickens if the same spirit that you dwelt in jesus christ it caused him to rise from the dead it must dwell in you the same way in order for us to have the quickening life and and have that rapture in our life in the message hear ye him brother branham says this so what we need today is an inspiration over us amen god sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that is it might inspire us to quicken us and awaken us to his word i'm praying tonight for an awakening in our hearts i don't want to stay the same from it from the pulpit to the last piercing in the pew i don't want to stay the same i want to leave here quicken i want to leave here as brother brahman says awakened by his word and then the word begins begin brought into the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen but it takes the quickening power the revelation of the word to bring about that miracle and the things take place because the two becomes together so father i pray oh god that our hearts might be inspired today quick and made anew made alive in christ jesus this very evening in our text we were reading and jesus is speaking here and i want you to notice what jesus is speaking it's bringing a lot of controversy he's standing amongst a lot of a real religious peaceful the scribes and the pharisees many are sitting together and you know in a meeting brother branham tells us there's three types of believers and you know oftentimes we look around and we're we're you know a smaller group today but but you know some there is a true believer and i want to focus on the believer i don't want to give so much time to the make believer and the underbeliever no i want to talk to you those that are believers and so we say how many believers are here tonight we all shout amen but with jesus he was speaking friends there was three types of believers there and and i want you to notice the words that he was speaking were very controversy many would say jesus you're not being very nice well he just told them if you're not hearing my words you're not of me amen right he just he just told them you're of your father the devil now you know something that's a little that strikes a little hard right if the preacher get up here and say if you know an inspiration to say if you're not listening to the word that i'm speaking tonight you're of the devil we'd all say are you crazy man right well i want you to notice jesus didn't bring a very good reputation with him people didn't look at him they thought well maybe he had some you know we heard moses said there would be a prophet like unto him and but they didn't quite see him as the prophet there was 12 that walked with him and saw what he was doing and and seen the messiah signs and and they said you know like peter said well our father taught us this and we wouldn't see a messiah and there's different ones that rallied around and and jesus there was many coming to him and then he said you know accept a man eat and drink eat my flesh and drink my blood and all of a sudden they begin to leave them why because it was controversial words they misunderstood what he had to say and then in this same time in the same hour there has been many that has misunderstood and have left the word for their day on on on being offended and i say friends let's not allow the word to offend us okay you know when the word is spoken and it's especially spoken from the from the the podium if it's christ speaking through a man and you know it's the word of god let's not be offended let's take that word and eat that word oh it sometimes it puts stripes on our backs and it makes us not feel so good and we feel like saying oh woe is me but you know something in the pew bow your head and say lord be it unto me according to your word that man doesn't want to hurt me that man has no desire to put stripes upon my back i know this platform is not a whipping post but your word has come to me it is it is positive truth to me it's something to me and i want to take it lord with that attitude god can change us but these people they looked at this and this was this was this word was controversy and it wasn't very nice and they would say jesus i i don't like your tone of voice and and jesus used these words he said now i want you to notice this word this little two two letter word if he says it with rebuke he says if god was your father you would love me now now you listen to that and you think to yourself if if you would if you it's a very much of an argument of statement if you know i'm going to give you a little illustration you know uh when i when i was growing up in and my dad is a seasoned man of the gospel and we worked together and you know as i was as i was growing in in the ministry and you know you you don't you don't you don't grow in the ministry with the talents all of a sudden to preach okay hey and so you develop a thought and you're studying it and you you think you got something really good and i was smart enough to you know to run it past my dad before i got in the pulpit you know i knew that hey you know something that i better run with this but not run too far and so i get there and i get in his office and and uh he would talk with me and i would share my heart and i would preach my thought to him and tell him what i thought what it was all about and you know sometimes we didn't always agree and he used to use these words well son if you read the message you know that you'll be way off balance if you read your bible properly if those words and you know something i'm telling you as a human being when he said if it brought anger it brought that feeling was an argument of statement if what do you mean if i read the message i study the message like you do but you know something humbleness of hearts a change of attitude begins to realize that you know what if we were in the truth if we would abide in his word then the revelation of his word will come to us and jesus is saying here and i'll get to in just a moment i'm speeding ahead but he's telling them something specifically if you would understand me if you would hear my words then you would be of my father so he says his why why why don't you understand my speech and jesus then he says with answers his own question he says because you cannot hear my word now remember we read in our to one of our text readings he that hath an ear let him hear and so to be a child of god to understand the king's speech we have to be able to hear the word of god and why can some people not hear because they're not listening to a certain sound they're listening to another voice you've got to be careful what voice you're listening to amen you've got to be able to hear the word of god now if you're not hearing the word of god then you're listening to another voice and there's only two voices it's either god's voice is our satan's voice and remember this is satan's eating and he's trying to pump his voice through loudspeakers okay he's trying to get it out and we're talking about advertisement today he's trying to advertise his gospel and you know there are distractions out there for all of us what in the world are we taking in in our daily lives he's got his billboards they're distracting us with his words when god is calling and wooing us carefully come unto me amen all ye that are weak and heavy lady i'll give you rest where is the rest the rest is in the holy spirit it's not in a sabbath day it's in christ jesus who is the lord of the sabbath and so what is he saying jesus says why can you not catch my thoughts and why can't you hear my voice the reason why you cannot catch my thoughts or hear my voice is because you're not of god now that's pretty dreary it sounds pretty hopeless does it not but i want to flip the coin because every coin has got two sides and i want to speak to you today there's an opposite of this if you can hear you can hear the voice of god and i believe today we are hearing the voice of god amen we're not of our father the devil that he is not my father i've got a father that is wisdom and truth amen i don't have a father he spends his own lives and we can read it through scripture and we can look exactly what he's done satan is not my father i am born by the spirit of god we are washed by the blood and we have ears to hear sometimes though we got to pull the cauliflower out of our ears sometimes we've stuffed it with our own thoughts and our own understandings and our own feelings we go by feelings rather than going by the word of god and we go by our own interpretations and you'll hear in just a moment god interprets his own words so let's not you know let's not focus on these five senses or or our our channels within our spirit but let's listen to the one that's in the control tower and that's god our heavenly father so jesus is saying if you are seed you cannot help but hear the thoughts of god it's his thoughts they're not your thoughts it's his thoughts and so his thoughts are you his thoughts are all about you right from the start adam and eve were walking in the cool with the lord and they fell and i want you to notice when they fell our lord our god he went through the garden calling adam adam adam where are you now it wasn't that god was lost it wasn't god that god was not all seen that he couldn't find at him he knew exactly where adam was but the voice of god was speaking directly to the inward being added saying where have you gone to adam how far have you you didn't listen to my voice you didn't listen to what i speaking and you have fallen and because you have fallen that day you shall die but i know it should notice in order for god to show forth all his attributes of his word he needed to allow man to come into a permissive will through free moral agency you've got a choice what you want to hear you chose tonight to hear the word of god some years ago you know you're walking you maybe thought that you know you walked into a church or you stumbled into somebody it was you're doing it was never your doing at any of the time you just came in because god was wooing you and that's all part of election we'll get maybe into it in just a moment so his thoughts are of you okay make this personal everybody make this person personal because this is a personal god and we said yesterday god has no grandchildren so when you realize that down from his glory he came for it with the thoughts and intentions for you he died on the cross for you he paid those prices for you for your sickness for your pain for all of your struggles all your depressions anything you're going through he's already paid it all the strikes were upon his back this he did for you and he has foundational thoughts about you before the world was ever created before he said let there be light and there was light before you know there's anything that was created upon there's he had a thought about you in ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 it says he hath chosen us in him and i like to underline that and you know this very well but he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy okay not just you know 16 elements or blobs walking on this earth and just you know fulfilling our earthly desires no we're chosen in him that we are holy and without blame before him in love it's his desire that we have a love relationship it's a husband-and-wife relationship it's an intimate relationship between a man and his wife the two shall become one and they shall bring forth fruit you see this is what god desires of us it's the thoughts of god that he's seen of us in colossians chapter 1 verse 27 it says to whom now he's speaking directly to us make it personal to whom god would make known what is the glory and riches of the riches and glory of his mystery who is he revealing his mystery to to us now this this scripture was written a way long time ago but it took the eyes of a prophet amos 3 7 says that the word of god comes to a prophet and we need this prophet to point this out to us who he's speaking to us this is the voice of god to us it's the king's speech to us it's to you he wants to declare a mystery unto you he wants to show something to you we are gentiles we're not jews we're gentiles and he desires to show a mystery to us now remember when jesus was here on earth he came to his own there was the jewish brethren and they received him not but to as many as he would seem that he gave the power to become sons of god and we see peter after the death of our lord we see peter up there and he's he's he's sleeping and he has a v or and he comes and he has a vision and we see that basket of unclean animals and the voices kill and eat he says oh that's unclean he says don't call and clean that which is clean and it was a vision it was a a a voice spoken so that we could see as gentiles that we're going to receive truth for the hour for the day that they were living in and that truth to the gentiles is the same truth that we're receiving today it's picked up through the eyes of a prophet and brought to us to show us who we are that there's a mystery to us gentiles that we must receive in this hour paul preached the foundational truth he gave them the word for their time and they were ready for the season for rapture in their time but them without us were not perfect we needed to come so i'm speaking to you tonight that god sees you you are the people that god sees and he says you know what i want to do i want you to recognize this mystery it's christ in you you've got to recognize it's christ in you the hope of glory it's got to be more than words that's why i'm trying to express it to you don't let this three words on the page you've got to see that in your heart that you are the receiving set in this hour this day that we're you are that receiving set your heart has been cleansed by the blood of jesus christ and since that time you have become a receiving set for the sending set amen amen right now now our young people you know most of them don't know what it means to have or to see a television with rabbit ears right well there was this box let me explain to you it was a bog and on this box it had some bulbs and some things and you had it was a receiving set and there were some antennas and the signals were transferred back and forth and sometimes things were really fuzzy you you would turn the channel and you'd want to watch something and it was it was fuzzy and then somebody had to go up there and adjust adjust the antennas the rabbit ears and uh stop stop stop stop it's clear right and then you'd hold still and hope that it you know hey in this hour okay we're not talking about televisions now in this hour god has had a prophet to make all things clear for us he was pretty fuzzy oh we could see it now they went through the dark ages and those dark ages were really dim it was pretty fuzzy and all of a sudden luther came and a little bit more light came and the fuzz came out of the receiving set just a little the just shall live by faith oh my goodness that was reforming reformer now we were just a little more and wesley picked that up and he said now you know it's not just the judge shall live by faith but now you need to be cleansed you need to be washed you can't live the way you're living and they walked forward and in 1906 all of a sudden all of a sudden began to move and also the power of god began to fall i always have a start of a pentecostal age and all of some people wow the things oh god is present this is amazing what's happened but all the while god was preparing a man that was born for the season i want you to notice the prophet is born for the season amen and he's born at the time and all then all of a sudden he was that one that was able to through the mind of god to just the set so that we could see the thoughts of god so we become the receiving set you see it's christ in us and that's what the prophet did he introduced us to jesus christ he showed us christ that you could enter into the holy so holy yourself and you could speak to him you're not walking in darkness trying to get through man's ideas and no you could live and soar in the realms of an eagle anointing this is the prophet's message you're not walking in darkness no more it's amazingly clear okay brother brown talks about the god and he says you know it's like taking the binoculars the looking glasses and you know if they're out of focus and you look way up in the mountain you see that elk and if it's not just perfectly toned in what are you going to see you're going to see three alk but really up there when you tune it in and you begin to focus it prophet properly he says what is it it's back to one elk and friends that's the prize of a prophet he zoomed in hallelujah the old testament the new testament all god had for us and he brought it all together so we could see one picture and what was that picture christ in you oh friends we we've studied the church ages and we studied the seals and we've read about our future home and we've got all these things but all of it the point of it is christ wants to be in you he wants to show his glory in you and the testimony of his glory is written in the church ages the testimony of what he's done is in the seals and how he's broken for us and we ought to study it and meditate about those things but the purpose is he wants to be in fellowship he wants to recognize that you are his thoughts amen hallelujah and so what did he do he cleansed your heart by his blood and since that time you've become that receiving set from the sending set and you need to be able to find and know it from that time you see every man and every woman has to have an experience of god to know from that time amen i want you to recognize now many people say well and and i agree 100 it's not by sensation it's by the word that you recognize from that time but i want you to notice in type that when abraham was circumcised he realized he was circumcised and circumcision in the scripture all right this is a is a is a symbol this is a type of receiving the holy ghost except we receive it by the circumcision of our heart so if abraham realized and understood that he had been circumcised then you and i also have to come a place in our life where we see a change of our nature now this was written in my notes friends a long time before we had breakfast this morning we got to recognize that we're children of god how by a life change our lives are up and down the staying power is the holy spirit he's the one that reveals things to us and causes us to recognize that we have a change of nature we are all beasts walking around and after our own lusts and our own desires but when god came in our lives there was a difference i don't care if you were the rank a sinner and you came in and you recognize that you're cleansed or you're the purest young person that sits on the bench you will recognize what god has done for you personally and you will not be able to really share your experience with somebody else because somebody else has their own experience you see as human beings we always want to clump our experiences together oh i was the guy that ran around the tree did you have a run around tree experience shouting hot dog well no i didn't know and we all want to be that guy that has these experiences but god sometimes supernaturally comes in your life and speaks to you quietly it's not in the wind it's not in the thunders it can be but it's not always there and he comes and he says to you i love you amen and i change your nature amen and all of a sudden you say thank you lord you know what you do you confess it he came to me when i could not come he came to me and he said i love you and i take away your sin and i take all that you've ever done and i accept and i take it all and put in the sea of my forgetfulness and i want to fill you with my life and all you have to say yes lord yes lord surrender yes lord and then what you do begin you read his word you can't live unless you eat yeah how many you ate today absolutely we ate i ate dinner i ate butter chicken it was awesome okay that's giving me strength right now to preach the gospel to you friends you got to eat of the word of god to live if you don't eat you get anorexic you know the folks that are now i'm off my notes now friends there's people that are anorexic right and uh you know if you've ever been in an area in psychiatry you begin to get these lovely people who come and they're skinny like a rail you can see every bone in their body but when they look in the mirror they see themselves fat they got cloudy vision you know it didn't start there it started with a perverted thought it started somewhere in their minds somebody said something they started there it became a pervertify and what happened all of a sudden something in their selves clicked off and they begin to see unclearly but i want you to notice if you keep your mind in the word of god and look upon the mirror of the word friends it's always going to tell you the truth [Music] it's going to make you walk in truth and abide in truth it's not going to lie to you and your senses will remain in the truth of his word and in check it's important to remain in check but it's the word of god now if you take a different looking glass and you look at yourself according to what satan sees upon you he'll lie to you he's the father of lies he's going to tell you things and before you know it you're going to end up with your face in the gutter lost your family or or in a place you don't ever want to be backslidden let's look into the mirror that god has for us amen i wonder if you can say in your hearts from that time i remember from that time i remember that time when i had experience with god from that time now if you've never had an experience with god today you can meet him amen he's here with us this evening and i believe without you just have to say lord come my way that's right you got to press through the crowd you got to push in and say it's my turn remember the woman with the blood issue you know i want you to recognize that one that woman was unclean she had a blood issue and during jewish times if you had a bleeding problem like she she had you had to stay outside the camp you were filthy you were dirty nobody wanted to be around you and no doubt when she pressed in friends when she pressed in they looked in and said oh my goodness that woman's coming into the city and maybe whisper whisper but she didn't care she had to get to jesus and she pushed and she pushed and she pushed and she touched the hem of his garment and we know the end of the story where she went from jesus and he recognized who but she was but i want you to recognize her attitude she was willing beyond all costs to receive her healing for that sickness now that blood issue that she was going through was a symbol of sin and she was willing to push that her sin would be omitted and that she would receive virtue which is power due to his life power in her very being to change your situation how about your situation today are you willing to reach out and push through the crowd no matter what anybody thinks and get a hold of his garment that power from on high might cleanse you and change you into this being that god has thoughts of you on [Music] i challenge you tonight in the name of the lord to find a statement in your heart from this time [Music] brother branham says in 1964 he says yeah and and who do you say this is he says i got a little receiving set in here and i believe if he was preaching he'd be pointing to his heart here he says i've got a little receiving set in here a little thing that lights up in my heart i know it reflects him you see that word is a reflector and it reflects in the heart of the believer and then brother brown says in revelations chapter four number three in 1961 he says now the lamps reflecting the words the true word reflects what what would this lamp if it was getting its reflection from the shekinah glory it would reflect the shekinah glory now in our lives if we're feeding upon the word of god what would it reflect amen it would reflect the word it would perfect his life now i want to point in just a moment to the attention there to those moons that are on their through the seven church ages and i want you to remember that brother branham says that the bride is that type of that moon and the sun the s-o-n is that one that is shining upon the moon and if you look in there in the first age of ephesus there was a lot of light and a little bit of darkness the church was reflecting in its in its pureness but as time progressed what humanism progressed and they began to listen to the wrong voice and man started to take over and the things that were happening is you read the church ages and finally we get to a place of laodicea and i want you to notice that brother adam he said now the moon was darkened but but but i knew that the bride was here so i put a little bit of light in there and i want you to notice that light is you and i that's the thoughts of god that's who you are friends this whole world would be dark unless there was something lighting up in the hearts of god's children unless there was people that were reflecting the word reflecting the shining kind of glory the nature of christ for today brother brown says in harvest time he says but jesus when he was when the spirit of truth has come see he will bring these things that i have taught to your memory the word and he will also show you things to come there is the real spirit-filled church now stays with the word reflects the word god on earth i read this to you so that you know that i'm right in the word of god and i'm in the middle of the road it's god in you friends it's god here upon earth the reason that there's still blood here the still blood and i want to tell you today there's blood on the mercy seat and why is your blood on the mercy set because you're still here oh thank you lord oh praise the lord but one day when the bride is taken from this earth there will be no more mercy friends we don't want to be there on that time when there's no more mercy let me tell you if you see the prophets of revelations of moses and elijah here upon the earth it's time for you to be frightened i do not want to be here to see those prophets you say oh no brother steve no because i know the tribulation is on the bride is gone and i am not a foolish virgin and i don't want to pay attention to the foolish virgin i am that virgin that has got oil in their lamp and i'm going out to meet the bridegroom now if you've got to go buy oil that'll begin your problem but right now he said that i could have the oil and i could have that oil living through me speaking through me acting through me because i am the literal thoughts of god i am that reflection of that light hallelujah and shining upon the earth friends but friends who i'm warning us this one day if we don't have that light the bride room will call and you'll be searching for oil and you don't want to be that foolish virgin at that time it's god on earth he says reading again he says it doesn't mean any theologian causes this word is has no private interpretation he interprets his own word i'm so thankful for that i'm the word for the hour and god is speaking about who i am are you the word for the hour right the word has become part of us amen oh well i haven't written here further in my notes and i'll skip in a moment because i want to share right now we are called messiahs brother branham says we are gods with a small g oh those are strong words and many have left because of but the bride rejoices because we are sons and daughters of god born by the spirit of god our natures are changed we're no longer of this world oh that makes us gods now when i want to tell you not my notes now when you speak it's god speaking be mindful of your words what you speak whatever you speak will bind in earth and it will bind in heaven friends it's your word speak the truth speak god's word if there's any sick amongst us tonight speak the word listen your body has to hear the word of god look at yourself in that mirror and say body in the name of jesus christ behave yourself well what's nature's inside you it's christ he's in that soul being he's governing your spirit if you've got a spiritual problem conscience memory reason whatever it might be speak to it and say hey spirit of depression that's coming against my reasoning and coming against my memories in the name of jesus christ satan you are bound which be restored in jesus name you have the voice of the word inside of you you are the thoughts of god he interprets his own word by vindicating and proving it it to be the truth when you walk in the supermarket he is proving it it's the proof in the pudding when you are a child of god with a smile on your face you know that we should never walk around with a frown because the joy of the lord is our strength it makes no difference our situation does you know you can have minus 350 in the bank account makes no difference you know why because god is our provider you bring that number to zero and you still have money on your our food on your table and and some place to cover your head he didn't promise that us to drive a mercedes brother gerald with one of those seat belts that comes across like we were talking today he didn't promise that to us but he promised he would care for us that he would look after us and that we would not have to go hungry he wasn't going to see his children begging for breads that's the god we serve that's the one who wrote his name upon our heart the white stone of our heart he has put his name in there you think mrs jesus christ is going to starve you think she's going to wander her she's going to die of covet friends come on who are we oh you say brother that people have died yeah they die but it's only by god's choosing no man can die unless god calls no disease no cancers no friends man satan can't take your life look at job he had to go to god for permission just to test him and god said okay test him he's my he's my son he's gonna come up proven but he can't you can't take his life and all through the troubles he took his children's life he you know he took us all different things from him but he could not touch job because god said no we give the devil too much credit oh the devil's going to take our life with such and such no no no you might have died with sunshine your friends had died but don't friends think one moment that god has not made the decision for you he's allowed satan to afflict you and the and your faith the faith has been weak but has nothing to do with your salvation god has taken you to be at his side blessed be the name of the lord at that point it's a win-win situation if you stay here on the earth well when you get to stay with your family if you die you have a coronation day you enter into the presence of god no more to suffer come on no more pain right you see your loved ones and to you it's like a vacation time before your other family shows up right one day with god is the thought has a thousand here right what what is it to god where are my i've lived with what my loved one and listen it's painful i don't make any stories up or make it light it's painful here on earth when we lose somebody but our joy is the lord and we recognize that friends is just a moment a blink of time before we see our heavenly father but only if we have his life right it takes his life yeah we want to go to the right place now too are you okay all right to a non-seed there's no effect nothing is inside too quick in that they go on in life but to a believer there's effect the word has spoken to them it's quickened in their life and brother brown says in the trial he says this a grain of seed laying on the desk will never grow a harvest a grain of course uh corn on the blue stone will will do nothing a grain of corn has got to fall in the ground and be fertilized for the grain of corn or it will not grow and god said that his word is the seed and that the sower sowed and it must fall in the right kind of soil amen praise the lord oh heavenly father prepare our soil make sure our soil is good ground now i want you to know sometimes a hard ground will produce some life but and it will start growing but let me tell you when the when the storms of life and and temper change changes happen and people walk along the path what happens that thing gets destroyed and it cannot live and we've seen many many people like that in the message come on as a boy growing all the way up to where i am today i've seen people that have stood in the pulpit people have sat in the pew they were great people we thought they were amazing people but they had no quickening life inside of them they had not prepared the soil for god's seed to be planted they sat year after year time after time we thought they had the holy ghost they pretended to have the holy ghost they didn't go all the way with god and what happened today we see them and they're rebuking they're spitting upon the very word that brings life what was it it was soil that was not ready for the seed they didn't soften themselves before the god amen we're all of our choice you're going to remember now predestination comes involved there but when it starts and stands here friends we all have a choice let me not have deaf ears oh god to hear your word for the time in the season hallelujah it must fall in the right kind of soil that soil is faith it's a seed and it must fall into the ground or it cannot be quickened brother brahma says quickly minks means to be made alive it's words the holy spirit defend with the defenselessness says here he can't even come to it and f until it falls into the right ground don't let it just be words to you tonight love this word that's why i keep on saying let it be personal okay let it drop into your heart amen and jesus is saying to us can you hear my thoughts now to hear means to understand what is being said and you know sometimes you can hear someone speak but you really don't understand what they're saying how many has ever come to that spawn now you know there's some very intellectual people and very people have such good understanding now you know if you sat together with you know some doctor friends of mine and and they're describing a surgery to you and they're using all kinds of medical terms and you don't know what those medical terms what happens you hear the voice but you don't understand what it's saying but you know after some time you know you work with the fellows and they begin to teach you and point and tell you and show you and you all of a sudden gain the revelation of what they're saying and all of a sudden it becomes clear and then you get involved i've been involved in some surgeries and before you know it you know the the the the things that they're telling are now become clear to me i've experienced them they come become part of who i am you can't take that away i can go through a belly surgery with you and i can tell you how it all goes and i tell you where where it all sits and how it looks it has become part of me right because it's become a revelation to me and it's the same thing with the word of god many times it sounds like greek the preacher is preaching and all of a sudden we're talking about the revelations and also in our minds go shoop they turn them off right come on now how many has ever sat am i the only guy okay lord bless brother lonnie sitting in the presence of god just now but there's many times that brother lonnie's been praying has preached in times past and he went way deep and i and i wasn't quite ready for that mystery understanding and i sat there and went [Music] he didn't speak very long anyways but this is really good right right because you don't understand but you know something you get into the presence of god say lord i don't understand i don't understand the verbiage i don't understand what he's speaking but father would you show me to me you know you know i i know brother berry coffee he's just preaching the word to me he's just giving me just nuggets of real truth and i just don't get it lord could you open my eyes you hang around that long enough and all of a sudden god begins to show you and not only does he show you all of a sudden it becomes a part of you and it becomes an action of you and before you know it now it's not something that anybody can take away from you if they explained it to you and you took it intellectually what happens oh that's really cool and then you start talking to somebody else and before they you know i don't really see it the same way those brothers preach it so this is what i think and you're like oh okay and then you start adding things together and before you know you've got the cow in the tree right and everything's all upside down why because something other than the holy ghost has given you the truth has given you the word and you know so sometimes we we hear something we speak but we have to say and humble ourself before god and say lord you teach me you show me you'd let me tell you what what help me to understand what you're saying another illustration of this you know us husbands have selected hearing and i'm proud of it the only thing i respond to and always respond to is honey time for dinner but you know and she says honey i got a honeydew list you know some i got selective hearing right oh or children where are they they also have this problem you know go clean up your room for the 150th time they don't want to hear that but you know you say hey let's go shopping right everybody's in the car right selective hearing let's not have selected hearing we do that all the time the spirit of god wants us to take the whole picture you can always sit and i'm just like the rest of you you know it's times and seasons we're in places of our life preachers pray chaining or we're listening to a tape and we're like oh that's really good for no that's for that guy right and we start doing the pitchfork religion i already heard that before hey we all have done it right we're preaching real hard i even seen it this evening in someone's eye i'm preaching about something all of a sudden somebody looked at the corner of their eye to somebody else and i just said praise the lord i'm going to get on pitchforge uh religion because that's what we do right we're sitting there hey hey listen we're we're we're good people i sit there like this and all of a sudden the word's being preached to me and we know it's for somebody else and we're not taking it's somebody else's problem right look at this hoping he gets it right and when they go this year's like praise the lord hallelujah right it's a vision for somebody else god doesn't want us to do that right if you're looking at the corner of your eye to somebody else more chances than not it's for you right take it apart of your life and allow it to live and jesus says do you hear what i has been said now the word speech all right that spirit speech is it's vocalization a thought a word being expressed so i'm expressing through vocalization a thought to you and jesus is saying why do you not understand my thoughts expressed think about now the word now spiritual minds thoughts express now let's tie that back to what the prophet has to say thoughts express you know what that is he's talking about the logos look at the word logos for a moment the greek word logos means it's often translated brother branham says the english to the word the meaning word but it also means a thought speech meaning reason he says john 1 in the beginning was the word the root of which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept it has a double meaning a thought and a speech now a thought expressed is a word or words it isn't a isn't that wonderful it's beautiful so the locus of god is thoughts expressed okay i read that all to you so that you can see it again and i'm on the middle of the road brother brown says the logos of god is his thoughts expressed so how does that pertain to me all right let's read it so adam was formed of the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by god and adam became god's thoughts expressed god had a thought there was a spiritual being and then god created an adam the thought of god took manifestation took form and those eternal thoughts were now manifested and down through the centuries we could go we find moses and jeremiah john the baptist and each one of these are god's eternal express thoughts expressed in its season okay so every season god had some thoughts that were expressed then they come to jesus the logos he was perfect and complete and the complete thought expressed and he became known as the words right in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word became flesh and the word dwelt upon us amongst us now that was the fullness of god upon the earth at that time god's thoughts expressed for the time of the season he wanted to dwell amongst his people to be re savior to re-redeem her to manifest his characteristics and he all of his virtues his natures he wanted to show it to the people but did it all end when he died on the cross no because he said i'm going to send the comforter to you [Music] he said he's going to send himself he was going to come back in a different form in a different manifestation the same god in a different office he's going to dwell again amongst the people but he's going to do it in a different way when jesus was upon the earth it was the fullness of god it was all of god and jesus but now he wanted to dwell individually in you and us amen he wanted his thoughts to be expressed not just in a one but in a multi-membered bride oh in acts chapter two i love these words and you know somebody just labeled me late recently as a pentecostal and i i clicked my heels 100 i'm not a denominational pentecostal by any stretch of the imagination in fact that denomination has ruined it just as in this day and this hour has ruined the rainbow come on get my thoughts i love the rainbows and it's god's promise to the people that he would never destroy it by water again but satan picked that thing up and he ruined the whole meaning behind it and satan has picked up that word pentecost and he was ruined it by denomination we are pentecostal from the top with experience not just with but the life of god what happened on the day of pentecost and the day of pentecost was fully come and they were all in one accord in one place and suddenly there came from a sound from heaven as a mighty rushing wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloves a tongue like of a fire oh we get lost in the wind we get lost in the noise we get lost in the speaking in tongues and we get lost in the interpretation but i want you to know that fire fell upon each one of them so they could always this is where i get in here they all receive the power of god even so much to peter who was a fisherman that was unlearned couldn't hardly speak he stood up and he began to speak words of life to the people so friends let's not worry about those words pentecost we're pentecostal according to the word of god that means the life of god is living on the inside of us and will it make you act differently it will change you absolutely and how you act it's up between you and god it has nothing to do with me amen amen we have our own experience with god our own talk with god our own telling with god but people get so afraid brother branham says i speak in tongues right he talked to he said you know i have words from god all these things that we're going let's not be afraid about the the gift okay i love the gifts but i want the gift giver come on there's a balance yeah brother gerald amen we want the gift giver and if the gift giver comes amongst us and shares a gift we'll apply it and give it the word test amen amen i'm not afraid of the gift we'll give it a word test we'll prove it by the word of god and if somebody comes up here saying thus saith the lord friends and it's not the truth there's a lot of men of god here to lay their hands out and rebuke the devil right so we don't have to be afraid we're mature we're not babes anymore we're not just sitting there drinking milk and not knowing how to apply the word of god we've been down the road with the word of god teaching us a tutor teaching us showing us the way how to live how to respond and showing us what we live by and it's not by sensations but it's by the word of god so we have nothing to fear anymore but you know if you're a teenager and a teenager you get frayed you know who what's that that's happening over there no let's not be afraid we're mature believers in christ jesus so there we see what happened on the day of pentecost and out of the day of pentecost the church was birthed the feast and church age and there paul began to lay the foundation and they begin to walk and pretty soon there was samarina and pergamus and thyroid tyra and sardis in philadelphia and he came to a place god revealing himself more of the word oh you went through the dark ages let me tell you god still was revealing himself where was the life it was in the roots but let me tell you when it was the time the season for the the the bride tree to put forth a another little spigot of life it came forth according to god one how he wanted to do it was her caterpillars and oh and locusts and and and those those great that great army did it come against the church yes it did and god allowed it but he allowed his life to stay in the roots his life never changed and it was hooked into the river of water friends it was christ hooked into christ just the same one that was walking through the candlesticks and sharing with the and sharing with the seven messengers friends it's the same god throughout all of it it's the same god it's the same anointing it's the same oil that's in that candlestick it's all of god so what are we afraid of what's going on no we're not afraid we're basking in his presence right we're under his anointing the very place the spirit of god is coming out we are basking in his presence we're enjoying what god has for us and we're living in laodicea oh how does that work it's lukewarm age because we're not part of lucia the thoughts of god you manifested for this age you're not part of laissez you may be walking here but you're not part of him brother brown tells us we're not in heaven yet and we don't belong here we're somewhere in between and we're in this place where god is feeding us content and encouraging us to tell us who we are and one day friends we're going to hear the stage coach come in and it's going to pull up and what's going to happen it's going to take his bride home every promise that he said he will fulfill it and be manifested it'll come to truth amen but his spirit is amongst us now amen that mighty angel that's his spirit that spoke to the voice of the prophets it is here right now it didn't just disappear after 63. once the cloud you know came and then and brother branham noticed there was somebody you know that that looked a little different than others and he recognized who that was that was that mighty angel there was others you know the other angels in the cloud but there was one that looked different than all the others friends that was the mighty angel and he didn't just disappear he's here but friends he did promise a physical coming so he has come but he is coming what is he doing right now for the bride he's establishing us telling us hey hey hey it's you that i'm looking at it's you i put all all the eggs in my basket for you you are my thoughts you are my very expression yes sir so we live in late but we're not part of it right i want nothing to do with legacy it's a lukewarm world and jesus is saying to us today can you hear my thoughts can you hear those words come out of her my people right oh that's for denomination no come out of the world man come out of the things that don't be distracted right don't let some girl out there young people or some boy out there distract you from the word of who he wants you to be don't be some fashions or some something you know that the devil's showing on on on your tablets or your phone someplace don't let that distract you the bible and the scriptures have called to us come out of here my people it's time from separate for separation from all unbelief amen i like to underline that all unbelief you know if you if you know we read in the scripture that faith right is a mustard seed it's really small and if you have faith like a mustard seed you can remove mountain or move mountains you know but on the flip side of that coin if you have doubt okay like a mustard seed what happens your entire life is failing so we can't have any doubt according to god's word if we don't understand that's one thing but doubt is another so you say it before god lord i don't doubt your word your word is the truth i just don't understand it reveal it to me amen call us out of all unbelief amen you know you got to be aware today that you are the word made flesh as i said you are the very thoughts of god and you've got to have your receiving set on to be tuned to hear what he has to say i wish you could say with me today yes lord i'll tune to your word i'll tune to your word you know i struggle many times hearing people's thoughts and their meanings but i never struggle with god's thoughts when he anoints my heart now we said last evening you've got to you've got to meditate you've got to pray prayer changes things yeah yes that's right it's an atomic power and you know something you take god's word and you read it and it and you hear it and then you go to prayer over it all of a sudden god begins to reveal the picture to you and something that had no connection all of a sudden there is a connection connections to you and so friends today i want to encourage you don't disconnect you know what's the most annoying thing is when uh you don't have wi-fi you know i i've got you know this thing called shawn go and here on the island i have no wi-fi and i'm like are you serious i got to get hold of brother jonathan i got no this connection is not working right it is so annoying when you disconnect from god you know how frustrating that is when you've heard the voice of god and you know the voice of god and there's a disconnect brother brown talks about sometimes when he displeased god and there was a small disconnect for a short term time and how frustrating it was for him and the turmoil he went through he had a connection with god that i'll never have he's the prophet of this age but in my small connection with god you know how frustrating it is and you feel you know it's not the time to pull back you know the guy you know the guy does when he has no wifi [Music] you you can smile my brother i've seen i'm sure you do the same right here we go we get on top the highest mountain right looking for wifi and people think we're nuts and they look at oh no wi-fi right desperation can't we do that with our lives when you recognize you know what you know your wi-fi is not working with god can't you realize that you need to get to a higher place can't you really realize that the higher place comes from a lower place on your knees humbling yourself before god get out get in there put you know put yourself in like to say and say lord plug yourself and say lord reconnect me i need a reconnection we want a connection from god brother brown said in 1954 he says that god made with his people i'm not interested here to look at i'm not here to represent uh i i'm here to sorry he says i'm not here to be looked at i'm here to represent my blessed redeemer and can we say amen jesus christ i'm not here with swelling words i don't know any you know when guys get up and they want to you and hey you can see in the crowd they want to explain you swelling words hey that's not the spirit of christ the prophet could have done it better than anybody you know what he did he humbled himself he said i'm not here i'm here to represent christ i'm not here to do swelling words i don't know any i don't care to know any the only thing the biggest word that i know is he spells it j-e-s-u-s why could he say that because he was so connected with j-u-s-u-s he says here we can't we find we can't find him in a fine lecture because if we par if we find people who could stand up and can explain the word in such a way that it's breathtaking but when we find it it's still in when we find it it's still just a lecture see just a lecture it's mechanics and when we find the entertainer who can go all through all the actions and so forth but still isn't it it isn't what we're looking for so i take away from that we're not looking for an intellectual man we're not looking for entertainers what we're looking for is the thoughts of god expressed and how is that expressed it takes he says the mechanics and the dynamics in his word in his spirit that they're one together living on a life so i take away from all of this that you are the mechanics in dynamics well we always want to say wow the word has got to present it yes it's mechanics and dynamics yes and i got a quote for you just said we got the power of the holy ghost and as it come to feed the machine it needs to be mechanics and dynamics but hang on a sec if you are the thoughts of god if you are the word express if you're the logos for the hour okay then you are the mechanics and dynamics then you have the word in its fullness in you and out presenting to the people then you carry the king's sword amen okay then you have the adoption ring upon your finger we always want to no then you're ready for the rapture oh brother steve i don't know it's time for us to get into rapture condition and if you're skipping communion you're not ready that's right oh the churches get thin on communion now nowadays you know it's taking it it used to take a solid hour and a half to get through people and communion and foot washing now it's just so fast we just do it because people aren't sure they're ready anymore right and they don't want it more than you know every four months because there's a challenge to their life are you ready well i'm not sure i just watched that movie i just listened to that music i just read that book i just desired to have that outfit that wasn't godly and all of a sudden we begin to realize oh my goodness i'm not ready well that's not the time okay to get weak no that's the time to run before god again and say lord look i i'm just sorry that's all god wants to hear from you he loves you remember what brother branham said there's more pressure in that pipe okay he have his desire of love for you than all of the world right the all the waters of the world and that how big of a pipe did he see that small little pipe he put all the all the waters in that word i imagine the pressure he has more desire for you than all that pressure yeah amen do you think he doesn't want to forgive you absolutely he wants to forgive you that's why he gave you that desire for him okay to see where you're wrong and that you could come before him so that you can once again become that reflection that he desires you to be so don't don't the satan that confuses you satan that speaks to you satan that desires you to keep you out of fellowship don't stay out of fellowship get into fellowship when a sheep goes by itself it is singled out and then and the wolves and the lions and the bears can destroy the sheep but if the sheep stay together amen then nothing can come against them and then the great shepherd takes care if you're running today that great shepherd will leave the 99 and find you and let me tell you what he does once he finds you he loves you but you know what he does in love he breaks your leg and then he mends your leg he puts you around his shoulders and carries you feeds you personally until you get such a love for that great shepherd that when he puts you down again you'll never leave the full but you know what it's pain so let me tell you right now don't you don't have to go through that process you don't have to come through this thing of broken-heartedness no get into christ amen yield right say lord be it unto me according to your word whatever you ask i will fulfill it because i desire to be the word the thoughts of god made manifest for this time and this season so everybody is receiving a knock on their door tonight and we're closing them amen the scripture says behold i stand at the door and i know if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come unto him yeah so that's the promise i'm knocking if you open the door i'll come in and i'll sup with you i've dinner with you i i'll care for you i'll talk with you yes amen and he will sup with me to him that overcomer i will cometh i will grant with me in to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i'm set down in my father's throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches and i want to say today he that hath an ear let him hear what he's speaking directly to you he's saying why don't you understand what i'm saying if you were mine you'd hear my thoughts and you would recognize that you are the word made flesh today you will recognize exactly what what i have for you exactly that that all of the atonement was for you you would recognize that you would speak the word hey why are you crying like a baby moses like moses okay now hang on a second it's not time for you to cry right you've got the king sword amen the prophet gave us the word that's right what is the word the two-edged sword it's the king's sword you have it in your possession it's part of you that's who you are it's tied to you right why are you crying use the word of god amen you were elected you were predestinated chosen for this hour you couldn't come in and luther's time yeah you couldn't come in wesley's time you had to come for this time yeah because you are a special bird okay you could receive all of the truth in luther's time they could only receive the bride for that day had to walk in the light for they all they could receive is the just shall live by faith couldn't receive anything else listen luther wrote all kinds of documents but what they needed to receive was the just shall live by faith but friends you are living by the justified you are just and you're living by faith but you couldn't live just in that hour it wasn't enough you couldn't live in just wesley's day you couldn't just live in the start of 1906 in the time of and the starting of pentecost that wasn't enough for you it was start of good things but you needed and you were birthed in an hour to live out the word for today [Music] the whole word it was chosen for you for that book to become part of you god sent this whole message malachi 4 minutes message for you so that you could sit here and be the expressed thoughts of god now the question i have for you can you hear the king's speech towards you amen do you have that ear to recognize who you are if you are and you can hear you're of god amen if you can't hear well that's another story amen but let's not dwell on the other story amen because we have ears to ear and eyes to see we can see what god thinks about us and we're going to stand when we leave this place we'll be one step better to showing the rest of this world wherever our world is the thoughts of god because we can understand the king's speech heavenly father lord i trust that your people would have heard your thoughts to them today amen lord through the foolishness of preaching we encourage one another and we show one another by the word and but lord it's you trying to express your thoughts to us you're everything to me that's what you're trying to tell us your words to us is son daughter you are everything to me i came to this earth word made flesh i died for you for everything every sickness everything that's bombarding you everything that needed to be covered i covered with my blood amen and if you receive that atonement for sin then i just didn't leave you comfortless i didn't leave you alone i promised rest i promised that your yoke would be easy and and my yoke was easy and you know and if you lived in me your burden would be light you gave us this promise lord so you sent us the comforter and your spirit has been here and working in our lives and showing and influencing jesus and all through the churches as lord you've been but here in this special time lord you begin to not just now just express yourself and but you came yourself to speak to this generation and and lord a manifestation of you standing there and with a rainbow above your head above the head and you speaking through the voice of a of a seventh angel amen we've recognized that angel lord yes lord oh that appearing it was glorious but lord it's just not an event this is something that's real that's living in me amen the word has become part of me i recognize you did this for me so you could live in me and that i could be an express thought i could be that reflection that i could that i could when brother brown as she is him lord i could stand up and say that is me mama that's me yes i've become that she has become him you're no longer church no but your bride you're not just a girlfriend no your wife oh god these words are amazing to me and and it gives me confidence lord because just down the road i i have heard the voice and and the shoulder's gone forth and and the bridegroom is coming and lord i want to stand there ready with my robe white yes jesus ready oh god to step us so to speak into that carriage and be carried home with you help me to recognize that open my eyes lord that i might see lord today lord there's young people here there's older ones here and we all know our walk with you we all lord know exactly exactly where we're at and can't hide ourselves in your presence and for the sake of the people lord i'm not going to ask anybody to raise their hands or come forward because i just want this to be real personal i i i don't want people at the moment to feel exposed i want them just to really yield father so father some have never never come into that understanding that you're living inside their life would they speak to you today and ask you to come in lord they've asked you they've been they've been forgiven all their sins lord and they've been baptized and received your name entered the watergate that's not where we stop lord we want to receive that gift free gift of your life inside of us not just a blessing not just an outpouring upon us our beings lord but a full nature change so father if there be someone here today that lord they don't know they don't know whether or not their nature has changed i pray father that you would open their eyes and reveal it to them this tonight lord amen i'd like to give them the opportunity just to as we all begin to pray lord to really speak to you [Music] hallelujah this is your opportunity to touch his head you push in now i i'm not pushing the gate for you you do it for yourself you say lord i i need your virtue to flow in me there's some of us that our experience has been a bit cool we know what it means to have his life we have this life but you know what we've been distracted and the enemy has caused us distracted in and we've just not been our first love is not the same is it has it always been tonight i'm challenging in the name of the lord to reach out to and get a hold of his garment and allow the life to reflow fill up the bucket again friends it's raining out there and

i come to church bless the lord amen brother stephen said it was something that really struck me said our lives are are up and our lives are down sometimes that's very true but the holy ghost is a

pressure really comes down you're just having a really bad time you don't know where to turn and that's something just like brother brandon talked about he said sometimes he'll let you go all the way down down and down until you reach out and then god reaches it reaches out to touch you too and it lifts you up it's uh it's just you know he allows that right just to show you that he's there and he cares and you know and he cares about the small things that bother us as much as he does the big things you know and i i know brendan i talked about that before you know she had she had something you don't want me to say but she she she had a you know a burden she had a problem and she needed uh she needed an answer and it was just something some something you know just a prayer just a short prayer say lord i need this and you know i need this and i was outside the house and and i came in there she was in tears because god answered her right there on the spot right and you know you'd look at it and say well you know it wasn't a big thing but it was a big thing to god our little things sometimes are big things to god right and we'll just humble ourselves and let god just just talk to god about it and and you just be amazed at what he'll do for you right you know we sing that song count your blessings right and and sometimes it's a real blessing to be able to count your blessings just to sit back you know you kind of remind me of it there a minute ago when you said you look at christ you look at each other and you see christ right you're our blessings we are each other's blessing right think about it that's how close we need to be direct to recognize that i just wanted to say that for the glory of god you know he cares about the big things but he also cares he cares about what we care about right 12 42. i just want to thank you lord amen let's start with the chorus right [Music] i just want to thank you [Music] i just wanna thank you for always being there

you know once for breakfast but you know we uh we want to thank the lord and uh for all that he's done for us and we can't thank him enough anders i can tell you that now so let's sing just a chorus and uh i'll try to close but uh this is up to the lord he's i watched him manipulate a lot of my songs around tonight i just put him right in place put him right in place right and uh i've seen them do that before to me and i said to brenda on the way home last night i said i don't even know why i write so write down songs at the end for the end of the song very i'm sorry for after the service after printing uh preaching i'll get it right begins with a p but i wonder i wonder sometimes why i do it and i guess in my own mind it's you know just some backup if i need it right but uh very seldom do i sing them because because god lays songs on my heart while the ministry is preaching and it takes me a total different direction sometimes it doesn't happen all the time but it takes me totally away from that and when i get home and i look at the songs i got written down and said well they do that for okay because god is the song leader it's got nothing to do with me i'm just up here you know somebody got to call the numbers up but that's that's you know it's this is god this whole message this whole christian life it's not about us it's about god it's god alpha god omega it's all about him and everything in between we're the the cast members in this play and he's just moving us around he knows the end from the beginning right and and you know he's just in control of this whole thing so forget it if you think you're making the decisions he's got it all made he's all got it all done bless the lord i just think it's wonderful so when we sing 983 matt put that up there you
