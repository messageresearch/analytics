[44:02] always be under the revelation of grace
[44:05] a man we live by grace we walk by grace
[44:08] we talk by grace a man we believe by
[44:12] grace a man it's all grace a man praise
[44:15] the name of the Lord in Romans chapter 5
[44:20] and verse 1 then pray the grace of God
[44:29] to sister Amber tonight I was sort of
[44:37] shocked when I heard the prayer request
[44:40] so we pray grace to her a man that the
[44:45] Jesus that's here is there a man so we
[44:49] pray the grace of God for the promise
[44:52] that we these stripes she was healed a
[44:54] man and for our brother Jeremiah and
[44:58] sisterly and the family a man going out
[45:01] of course and thank God that are going
[45:02] to a Christian doctor a man because God
[45:06] the Father God said one time he said God
[45:09] heals through medicine
[45:12] he said God heals you know through uses
[45:14] doctors and he said God heals through
[45:17] love and God heals through his word a
[45:18] man and that's the truth that's the
[45:21] absolute truth so we thank God for our
[45:24] brother Columbo we pray the grace of God
[45:27] in our brothers heart as he does surgery
[45:31] for our brother Jeremiah and any others
[45:34] that are sick we pray the grace of God
[45:36] Elvis Lord Elvis to believe with a
[45:39] complete belief and you know what that
[45:41] is as a statement of the faith of the
[45:43] Jews and it says they believe with a
[45:46] complete belief
[45:47] and they there's no room for any
[45:49] question or doubt a man no questions no
[45:52] doubt why they believe thus saith the
[45:56] Lord they believe the Word of God sir
[45:58] brother sister is serious it's getting
[46:02] more serious because the prophet of God
[46:06] did tell us and it's a challenge I pray
[46:10] that we face it as a challenge don't let
[46:13] the devil take it away from us or
[46:15] undermined its its significance that
[46:18] it's your talents and not just a thought
[46:21] that winner Branham experienced when he
[46:23] said if he's if you don't don't believe
[46:25] for divine healing he said are you gonna
[46:27] believe for the rapture a man you can't
[46:30] hear you believe for the heat of the
[46:31] body how you gonna believe for the
[46:32] change of the body a man because it's
[46:36] all by faith brother through our Lord
[46:38] Jesus Christ so uh it's a challenge
[46:41] no wonder the price he's dead the
[46:43] prophecy he said he says you're gonna be
[46:46] surprised who made it and who didn't
[46:47] make it cuz we think this one's gonna
[46:50] make it we think Don was gonna make it
[46:51] brother and they come to find out it
[46:54] than ever that's right and brother it's
[46:57] only by the grace of God we'll make it
[47:00] but again you got to have that attitude
[47:02] you got to have that right attitude you
[47:05] got to be conscious of that humbling
[47:08] yourself in the presence of God
[47:09] constantly amen and believe in God just
[47:12] believe God believe the word believe
[47:14] Jesus but listen stop the nonsense of
[47:16] the devil of reasoning saying you the
[47:19] devil is here to get you to reason but
[47:21] gods to come let us reason together
[47:23] though your sins be as scarlet they
[47:25] should be as white as snow and so on so
[47:27] grace by grace through faith he was
[47:30] giving us a faith amen to take away
[47:33] reasoning natural reasoning amen brother
[47:35] we need to get get rid of the natural
[47:38] reasoning and the natural thinking and
[47:41] all these things and become more
[47:43] spiritual by the grace of God it is
[47:46] serious
[47:47] a man so brothers sister please God help
[47:51] us but seem like the people are not not
[47:54] rising to the challenge to believe for
[47:57] healing they want to heal themselves
[48:00] they want to do this do you want to do
[48:02] that I can do this I can do that that's
[48:04] the devil oh do this do that you don't
[48:07] have to do this
[48:08] no God wants you to do it because like I
[48:11] said there's only one way of healing and
[48:14] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:17] probably God said as did that germ
[48:19] warfare is going to come up on all
[48:21] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:24] amen
[48:26] grace of God to his brother I pray make
[48:29] sure you got the baptism and make sure
[48:31] you got it in your soul not in your head
[48:33] make sure you got it in your soul not in
[48:36] your flesh amen because if it's in your
[48:39] soul it's gonna it got to manifest it in
[48:42] your flesh by the grace of God you'll
[48:45] bring it out
[48:46] amen so god help us is my prayer Romans
[48:52] 5 and verse 1 therefore being justified
[48:53] by faith we have peace with God through
[48:59] our Lord Jesus Christ thank God by whom
[49:05] also we have access by faith into this
[49:10] grace wherein we stand and rejoice in
[49:15] out of the glory of God
[49:18] and not only so but we glory in
[49:22] tribulations also Oh tribulation I mean
[49:31] our glory and tribulation and it says
[49:34] knowing that tribulation worketh
[49:37] patience and patience experience the
[49:42] Bible says through much tribulation we
[49:44] enter the kingdom much and patience
[49:48] experience and experience hope with
[49:52] expectation of fulfillment and hope
[49:56] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[50:00] God is she'd abroad in our hearts by the
[50:04] Holy Ghost
[50:05] Alleluia the love of God bear this in
[50:10] mind the Lord willing we'll get to a
[50:12] quote
[50:13] the Prophet emphasizes the love of God
[50:18] and what the love of God is amen and it
[50:24] says an old Megan not ashamed because
[50:27] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[50:29] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[50:33] unto us a man they shed abroad in your
[50:37] heart by the Holy Ghost there's no way
[50:39] of hiding it there's no way of holding
[50:43] it back
[50:44] it's a it'll automatically manifest
[50:48] itself and as for when we were yet
[50:51] without strength in due time Christ died
[50:55] for the ungodly a man thank you Jesus
[51:00] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[51:04] one died yet peradventure for a good man
[51:08] some would even dare to die but God
[51:13] commendeth his love toward us in that
[51:15] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[51:21] for us
[51:22] thank God amen this is our Redemption
[51:27] this is our salvation this is the grace
[51:29] of God that Christ died for us much more
[51:35] then being now justified by his blood we
[51:40] shall be saved from wrath through him
[51:45] god bless his word you may be seated
[51:51] just a reminder that the items that we
[51:57] plan to get into regarding the messages
[52:02] that brother Matthew had sent us the
[52:04] link to on YouTube that her brother
[52:07] preached 40 years ago we'll get into
[52:10] that and also into the one that brother
[52:12] Alec reference to us hopefully after
[52:17] this Sunday by the grace of God because
[52:21] Sunday the Lord willing we I would like
[52:22] to have the communion service and
[52:26] because for that again to remind you
[52:29] that we should have communion service as
[52:31] the prophet of God said to our brother
[52:33] in Africa there he said maybe the post
[52:35] materials are more better than or better
[52:38] than we are because they have communion
[52:40] each and every Sunday and he's the wheel
[52:42] or every week we only have it once a
[52:44] week once a month rather he said and so
[52:47] on so and again I know that there are
[52:50] those around the message there some they
[52:52] don't believe in taking communion they
[52:54] feel that we don't we have a spiritual
[52:57] communion but we don't have to do the
[52:58] natural one but I like it you all know
[53:01] what I've said that as long as we're in
[53:03] this flesh we need to take the communion
[53:05] amen and brother when we get out of this
[53:08] flash into a glorified body we won't
[53:10] need it a man by the grace of God that
[53:14] we're going to take the communion as
[53:15] representing the shed blood and the
[53:17] broken body that by grace was laid down
[53:20] for us that we would be able to share we
[53:24] will be able to partake of the life of
[53:26] his blood eternal life by the grace of
[53:29] God amen
[53:30] so being prayer that the Lord will be
[53:33] with us on Sunday for the communion
[53:35] service and also to as we go through the
[53:39] other items that sometime in the near
[53:44] future we were going to have our brother
[53:47] Matthew give his testimony and also
[53:49] offer the time to our brother Craig to
[53:53] give a personal testimony and well some
[53:58] feel that we don't need that but again
[54:01] the problem of God did do away in in his
[54:06] Tabernacle in his church he did away
[54:08] with the testimony meetings because for
[54:12] many years ago that they had testimony
[54:17] meetings in most denominational churches
[54:20] I know that they used to have testimony
[54:22] meetings in even in the United Church
[54:24] their testimony meetings and they still
[54:27] do I wouldn't doubt but they still do
[54:29] maybe in the Salvation Army and the
[54:31] Pentecostal church and then and then
[54:35] after the testimony meeting they they
[54:38] they call on the preacher to preach and
[54:41] I know that even in the Salvation Army
[54:44] I remember the testimony said they had
[54:46] there it was tremendous the power of God
[54:49] the anointing was there and in the
[54:51] Pentecostal church the power of God the
[54:52] anointing was there as a brother or
[54:55] sister got up to testify a man they knee
[54:58] in between they would just sing sing
[55:00] courses but it was getting in the in
[55:04] Brenham chair and I who was getting out
[55:05] of order because they were a brethren
[55:08] that would get up to testifying but
[55:12] really they were preaching and I've
[55:15] experienced that as well in when in the
[55:18] early days of the message in the church
[55:20] in central Newfoundland and we
[55:23] eventually had to stop testimony
[55:25] meetings there because brethren would
[55:27] get up and go on and on and on and on
[55:30] and as I've said I have seen the pastor
[55:33] sit on the platform with his Bible in
[55:36] his notes for maybe three wait for maybe
[55:38] almost three hours a man that's the
[55:41] truth three hours before he could get up
[55:43] and preach a man so and brother Bannon
[55:47] was having a problem with that
[55:48] in Brenham tabernacle and no doubt
[55:50] brother Neville and and not only that it
[55:53] was also the gifts that they were
[55:55] manifesting in speaking in tongues and
[55:57] interpreting and the prophet of God
[55:59] preached church order because he said
[56:02] that the he did to bring our brother did
[56:05] bring it out to our pastor my former
[56:08] pastor and he brought it out and said
[56:10] that that many of the gifts that were
[56:13] being being used was not genuine a man
[56:18] it was a false anointing the gifts of
[56:21] the speaking in tongues and
[56:22] interpretation he said it wasn't God a
[56:24] man and again also is because of the
[56:29] testimonies that the people were giving
[56:31] and they were they were preaching not
[56:33] testifying so that's why he said you're
[56:36] going to have the meat he said when it
[56:39] comes to the gifts meet in the room
[56:40] before the service and let somebody
[56:43] judge the messages they came forth in
[56:45] tongues interpretation and when it comes
[56:49] to testimonies he said
[56:50] we're not going to add the testimony
[56:52] meetings he said if you've got a
[56:54] testimony just go and speak he said to
[56:57] to the pastor or let this one or that
[57:00] one know that you want to testify that
[57:02] God did something for you and you want
[57:05] to share it with the people and again
[57:07] they were limited to just a few minutes
[57:09] not for a 20 minutes for a half hour or
[57:12] 45 minutes so that again that we believe
[57:18] in testimonies and I'm willing to offer
[57:20] the brothers or even a sister if they
[57:23] had a testimony if they wanted to come
[57:25] out and testify for you know a half hour
[57:27] or 45 minutes or an hour we will it will
[57:31] allow that so as the Lord leads we will
[57:35] get our a couple of our brothers to give
[57:37] their testimonies and if Latin and if
[57:40] there's a sister they got a testimony or
[57:43] our brother got a testimony they'd like
[57:45] to share with the church you all feel
[57:47] free just let us know
[57:48] a man by the grace of God so grace to us
[57:52] a man let's do it let's do it God's Way
[57:56] let's get God the preeminence we're not
[57:59] going to try to give ourselves
[58:00] preeminence but give God two preeminence
[58:03] amen
[58:04] and let's do it for the glory of God and
[58:06] let's have the wisdom of God amen and
[58:10] the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[58:13] god bless you so again in Romans chapter
[58:17] 5 we read in verse 1 therefore being
[58:21] justified by faith we have peace with
[58:24] God through our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[58:28] whom also we have access by faith into
[58:30] this grace we have access by faith into
[58:35] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[58:40] in oak of the glory of God we have
[58:44] access by grace or by faith rather into
[58:48] grace because it is my it is my it is of
[58:51] great by grace through faith that we are
[58:54] saved a man so faith is going to is a
[58:57] reminder of grace if God reveals
[59:00] anything as a testimony of the grace of
[59:02] God to you
[59:04] as the testimony of the grace of God to
[59:06] me if God showed me this God showed me
[59:08] that Amen by faith
[59:11] a revelation that is a testimony of
[59:14] grace and grace and the prophet of God
[59:17] will will mention this and grace is a
[59:19] testimony of the love of God a man so
[59:23] let's not just say we say bye I'm saved
[59:26] by grace no you got to say by grace
[59:29] through faith but then you got to go
[59:30] back to the love of God that projected
[59:33] that grace a man because there are so
[59:37] few today that are thinking of or
[59:39] emphasizing the love of God amen or
[59:42] appreciating the love of God and they're
[59:46] not even appreciating really the grace
[59:48] of God they think is really what God did
[59:50] this and God did that and and so now I'm
[59:54] saved and so on but where's our
[59:57] appreciation a man where is our where is
[1:00:00] our love for him for doing what he has
[1:00:03] done for us and are we gonna are we
[1:00:06] gonna do for him what he has done for us
[1:00:09] are we gonna do for him what he is doing
[1:00:11] for us a man by the grace of God in that
[1:00:14] he lay down his life for us are we gonna
[1:00:16] lay down our lives for him a man and I
[1:00:19] turn to this brother this is the only
[1:00:21] way that we enter in to God's true
[1:00:23] Sabbath by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:26] is the only way that we enter into the -
[1:00:29] to the God's God's rest saying again and
[1:00:33] we know that there are those are there
[1:00:34] they feel that they they've got to keep
[1:00:36] they got to keep a Saturday or they got
[1:00:38] to keep a Sunday know you got to keep
[1:00:39] every day a man is not one day it is
[1:00:43] seven days you see from your did works
[1:00:46] of sin seven days a week and you enter
[1:00:49] into God's eternal rest a man this is
[1:00:52] this is God's Sabbath
[1:00:53] it is our Lord Jesus Christ a man and
[1:00:56] the and the other which was but a tight
[1:00:59] and as I have I know it struck them I
[1:01:02] knew that by the way that there the look
[1:01:04] on their face those that believe in a
[1:01:07] Saturday Sabbath and I and I and I've
[1:01:09] challenged him I said well I said wasn't
[1:01:11] Jesus crucified I said for breaking the
[1:01:14] Sabbath day
[1:01:16] as I said according to the law and it
[1:01:20] shook them because they knew they were
[1:01:23] holding that against Jesus because he
[1:01:26] would bring he would do this on the
[1:01:27] Sabbath he would do that on the Sabbath
[1:01:29] and and throughout in Jesus challenged
[1:01:32] them Jesus because why because Jesus was
[1:01:35] God's Sabbath and Jesus was point what
[1:01:39] was moving them away from the natural
[1:01:40] Sabbath to God's spiritual salmon amen
[1:01:44] not focusing on a day but focusing on
[1:01:46] Christ amen not focusing on a day but
[1:01:49] focusing on the revelation of God by the
[1:01:52] grace of Almighty God Amen praise the
[1:01:55] name of the Lord and then again as I
[1:01:58] said before we got that online in our
[1:02:01] own page and I have received a number of
[1:02:04] emails from around the world
[1:02:07] a man from brothers and sisters that
[1:02:09] said thank you thank you thank you
[1:02:12] brother
[1:02:13] old brother I thank you for that
[1:02:16] revelation for that understanding of
[1:02:18] God's Sabbath because I was under the
[1:02:21] influence of this individual or that
[1:02:23] individual and they were trying to get
[1:02:25] me to keep Saturday Sabbath but when I
[1:02:28] when I read what you had written in your
[1:02:31] home page
[1:02:32] I entered into God's Sabbath amen and I
[1:02:35] want to thank you for that a van before
[1:02:38] we thank the Lord for the revelation
[1:02:40] that God has given a million in this day
[1:02:43] and in this hour
[1:02:44] Amen for brother I tell you this all due
[1:02:46] respect and God will honored God
[1:02:48] respects it
[1:02:50] there there was a time when when twist
[1:02:53] ins they they believe that that Sabbath
[1:02:55] was Sunday amen and they believed that
[1:02:58] we had to keep sunday in the
[1:03:00] Christianity as the Jews kept Saturday
[1:03:03] that's the truth and that's why they
[1:03:05] kept Sunday for for almost 2,000 years
[1:03:08] and of course they're still keeping a
[1:03:10] Sunday for almost 2,000 years
[1:03:12] but God in this hour in this age is
[1:03:15] revealed the truth and he has given us
[1:03:18] the light of God's true Sabbath a man
[1:03:20] that it is not a day it is an experience
[1:03:24] in our Lord Jesus Christ we go from
[1:03:27] natural rasa
[1:03:29] lujah we're going to lay down this old
[1:03:31] body nem and ever and we're gonna pick
[1:03:34] up a glorified body but the grace of God
[1:03:36] in our rest in our true Sabbath in
[1:03:39] Christ a man I had brother type of Wrath
[1:03:42] we don't we don't get rest the rest we
[1:03:45] want the rest we are honoring for the
[1:03:47] rest were thirsting for we don't get
[1:03:49] that by keeping a Saturday or a Sunday
[1:03:51] brother we're going to get that when we
[1:03:54] are entering to an experience with Jesus
[1:03:55] we repent we're baptized into in the
[1:03:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God
[1:04:00] gives us the Sabbath God gives us the
[1:04:03] Holy Ghost amen and again as I said I'll
[1:04:07] reference it to you and you want to read
[1:04:09] it in Hebrews chapter 4 read Hebrews 4
[1:04:12] and you'll get the true revelation of
[1:04:14] God's true Sabbath by the group and it's
[1:04:18] by the grace of God amen so it's been
[1:04:21] the grace of God all the way down
[1:04:23] through the grace of God on the day or
[1:04:25] well right right right from the
[1:04:27] beginning as I have already ministered I
[1:04:29] believe in in the last sermon it was the
[1:04:31] grace of God in Genesis the grace of God
[1:04:34] in the in the in the in the Old Covenant
[1:04:36] it is the grace of God in the New
[1:04:38] Covenant and it was the grace of God as
[1:04:40] I said in the book of Revelation that
[1:04:42] the last line was the great I pray the
[1:04:46] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[1:04:48] you all Amen that's that's that's
[1:04:51] amazing thank God a man that he's
[1:04:55] serving John prayed that prayer at the
[1:04:58] end of the Book of Revelations amen that
[1:05:01] John prayed that prayer at the end of
[1:05:03] time amen hallelujah so it is grace that
[1:05:07] has brought us it is Grace that keeps us
[1:05:09] it is grace that's taking us on in His
[1:05:12] graciousness moving us from time to
[1:05:13] eternity by the grace of God amen
[1:05:16] hallelujah so I pray the grace of God to
[1:05:19] help us in order to recognize the the
[1:05:23] revelation that that pleases God the
[1:05:25] faith that pleases God and the grace of
[1:05:28] God is going to help us what is going to
[1:05:30] give us a greater and a greater
[1:05:32] revelation of the love of God amen
[1:05:35] because we're gonna trace work we're
[1:05:37] going to trace the faith points us back
[1:05:40] to Grace because they had brother
[1:05:43] the gray outside of grades there there's
[1:05:46] not going to be any faith that pleases
[1:05:48] God there is no way but it is by grace
[1:05:52] through faith so faith I go back and say
[1:05:55] thank you Lord for the grace that you
[1:05:57] have given me so that I have this faith
[1:06:00] a man and brother and again it is the
[1:06:03] love of God that is testified of the
[1:06:05] grace of God amen so brother love and
[1:06:10] faith is going to meet under grace by
[1:06:13] the group amen
[1:06:14] where new creatures in Christ by the
[1:06:17] grace of God anyway it is the love of
[1:06:20] God and it is the faith of God amen and
[1:06:23] it and it is it is revealed to us may
[1:06:26] the grace of God amen amen
[1:06:29] thank God for grace so brother by whom
[1:06:33] also we have access by faith into this
[1:06:36] grace we have access by faith into this
[1:06:41] grace wherein we stand and rejoice in
[1:06:44] hope of the glory of God amen
[1:06:47] and in verse 15 it says but now not as
[1:06:52] the new offense so also is the free gift
[1:06:57] for if through the offence of one many
[1:07:01] be dead after the offence of one many be
[1:07:06] dead much more the grace of God and the
[1:07:09] gift of grace by grace which is by one
[1:07:13] man Jesus Christ as abounded unto many a
[1:07:18] man it is the grace of God brother from
[1:07:21] Genesis to Revelation that's why I bound
[1:07:24] it unto many is not just grace in the
[1:07:26] New Testament it was grace all the way
[1:07:29] down through a man it was grace in the
[1:07:32] Garden of Eden it was greater the days
[1:07:34] of Abel it was grace in the days of
[1:07:36] Enoch it was grace in the days of Noah
[1:07:39] amen it was grace of God to Israel
[1:07:42] through the through Abraham it was the
[1:07:45] grace of God to Israel
[1:07:46] Alleluia through the prophets amen
[1:07:49] and through the law answer the sacrifice
[1:07:52] that God
[1:07:54] had given them to do sacrifice these
[1:07:56] lambs sacrificed this sacrifice that and
[1:08:00] it became what he may in praise the name
[1:08:02] of the Lord what was that for
[1:08:04] it was a covering for their sin amen by
[1:08:08] the grace of God by God by goodbye baby
[1:08:11] by his love with strand projecting Grace
[1:08:13] and grace was going to project a man not
[1:08:16] just the covering for sin but he was
[1:08:18] going to project a man a sacrifice that
[1:08:22] would take away sin a man they would
[1:08:25] wash it away that had been lost a man
[1:08:27] lost lost in the sea of God's
[1:08:30] forgetfulness a man by the grace of
[1:08:32] Almighty God this is tremendous mother's
[1:08:35] sister a man named when we ate any any
[1:08:38] reason brother that we're loving God is
[1:08:40] because of grace Amen praise the name of
[1:08:43] the Lord and again the public God said
[1:08:46] this is why God has permitted all that
[1:08:48] he is permitted this is why God has
[1:08:50] allowed all that he is loud in the

[1:17:48] man yeah you can even preach yeah you
[1:17:53] can do anything I still go to hell yeah
[1:17:57] still go to hell why because it's all
[1:18:01] outward it's all in the flesh and in the
[1:18:04] mind but not in the soul yeah God of
[1:18:09] grace help us brother amen
[1:18:12] nor we need your unmerited favor what
[1:18:15] about brother sister mother's way if
[1:18:17] you're if you're a predestinated seed of
[1:18:19] God from the foundation of the world
[1:18:21] it's like that Pentecostal pastors to
[1:18:23] ask said to me he said brother would you
[1:18:26] explain predestination and I say well
[1:18:31] what's your problem because I heard in a
[1:18:36] church up here I heard a Pentecostal
[1:18:38] preacher get up and he blasted the
[1:18:40] predestination he didn't believe it
[1:18:42] he said they get out there and say God
[1:18:44] has predestinated this predestiny of
[1:18:46] that and he made light of it and so on
[1:18:49] and I said oh god I said forgiven and
[1:18:52] then this this other brother that was a
[1:18:54] Pentecostal pastor and he just said well
[1:18:57] predestination what I want to know is
[1:19:00] said God he said predestinate this one
[1:19:02] to go to hell and that one to that one
[1:19:04] that one to go to heaven and so on I
[1:19:06] said yes he should you mean God decided
[1:19:11] to send that one to hell
[1:19:12] I said no I said predestination I said
[1:19:15] is based on foreknowledge
[1:19:17] I say why and then they said
[1:19:21] foreknowledge I said yeah I said God
[1:19:23] foreknew all things before the
[1:19:25] foundation of the world
[1:19:26] I said he knew he knew he knew the end
[1:19:28] from the beginning and I said he knew
[1:19:30] what this one was going to do and what
[1:19:32] that one was gonna do and I said this
[1:19:34] one was free destinated Amen unto
[1:19:36] eternal life and that was for destinated
[1:19:38] to hell and again I said they that is
[1:19:41] their choice a man because God does
[1:19:44] Charlie Ximena and God wants them to
[1:19:46] make the choice and he knows what it's
[1:19:48] bringing out his seed and who's not who
[1:19:51] is the seed of God and who's the
[1:19:53] Serpent's eat anybody
[1:19:55] the seed of God I can respond to God and

[1:19:59] regardless of what a what the price they
[1:20:01] gonna pay amen regardless of the
[1:20:03] separation that is gonna cost him a man
[1:20:06] no matter what they got to do or or they

[1:20:11] gonna do it for the glory of God if they
[1:20:14] are the seed of God amen
[1:20:16] and I tell you this God's God's for new
[1:20:19] when the word went for hallelujah praise
[1:20:23] the name of the Lord when the word went
[1:20:25] forth brother God saw this one was just
[1:20:28] took while some rejected it others took
[1:20:33] just parts of it and made religion out
[1:20:35] of it
[1:20:35] but the seed of God took it and went on
[1:20:37] down in the middle of the road amen

[1:28:36] individuals have said oh you must be a
[1:28:38] Christian amen they knew Jesus was
[1:28:42] different and listen if his Jesus in you
[1:28:46] as different as he was to the Jews 2,000
[1:28:49] years ago
[1:28:49] so are you going to be as different to
[1:28:51] others around you a man he's gonna live
[1:28:55] his life he's going to express things
[1:28:57] the way he that that did he expressed it
[1:28:59] back there a man it's gonna be the word
[1:29:01] the word the word a man you never say no
[1:29:04] it's really it's written or thus saith
[1:29:06] the Lord
[1:29:06] you just expressed it this way no no I
[1:29:09] feel that this is this is what we should
[1:29:11] do and how we should do it oh you feel
[1:29:15] like that you believe that yes I believe
[1:29:16] it or you must be a Christian
[1:29:24] brother says if by one man's offense
[1:29:30] death reigned unto one much more they
[1:29:33] which receive the abundance of grace
[1:29:35] abundance of grace thank God
[1:29:37] oh my it's our only hope brother is
[1:29:40] Grace oh but it's the message but where
[1:29:44] is it grace amen is it is it the
[1:29:49] dynamics of the love of God the grace of
[1:29:52] God or is it just the mechanics of the
[1:29:55] letter of the word is Amen if it's
[1:30:02] Christ in you then it's a you're living
[1:30:05] a different life amen
[1:30:09] your spirit is different your attitude
[1:30:12] is different oh yeah Oh most definitely
[1:30:15] your characters different its Christ
[1:30:20] living out through you they oh yeah
[1:30:26] well Pete it was whoa that was Peter it
[1:30:30] was Jesus and Peter it was Jesus in the
[1:30:33] Apostles it was Jesus in in the
[1:30:35] believers down through the ages hey man
[1:30:37] it's Christ in me the hope of glory and
[1:30:40] so on I tell you there's a lot of
[1:30:43] believers they they can they can know
[1:30:47] the message inside upside down but they
[1:30:49] don't know they don't know Jesus that's
[1:30:52] the truth
[1:30:52] they don't know Jesus amen
[1:30:56] brother you can have it you can have the
[1:30:58] word but it what about the mechanics of
[1:31:01] the word oh yeah but do you have the
[1:31:04] dynamics that's the life of Christ in
[1:31:06] you the dynamics is the life of pricing
[1:31:10] ami and your are you a new creature I
[1:31:16] mean it now are you a new creature of
[1:31:18] Christ do you do it when you when you or
[1:31:21] when you repented and got baptized and
[1:31:23] so on did and you an experience with God
[1:31:25] did you feel like a new creature in
[1:31:27] Christ going different now oh yeah I all
[1:31:31] praise the Lord God's got preeminence
[1:31:33] now Jesus got preeminence now hallelujah
[1:31:36] oh I'm in it to me
[1:31:37] to the word and the love of God and all
[1:31:39] praise the Lord man do you have that
[1:31:45] experience yeah as I said before I've
[1:31:51] preached the congregation's and like I
[1:31:54] told you about the but the man that was
[1:31:58] a bit noisy but and I said Lord I said
[1:32:04] tell them to quiet the others now others
[1:32:08] were praising the Lord worshiping but he
[1:32:12] was right there he stood out and I said
[1:32:15] Lord there's something wrong with him I
[1:32:17] said the what's lacking in his praise I
[1:32:22] said is the anointing
[1:32:23] I said praise the Lord because like I
[1:32:28] said they that was the same service I
[1:32:31] started my silenced them but then when I
[1:32:33] got into the word they all started to
[1:32:34] praise the Lord but they for them it was
[1:32:38] the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:40] but for that brother I looked at him I
[1:32:44] saw this like a spirit around him I said
[1:32:47] or something wrong with him I said the
[1:32:50] others I said I don't notice on the
[1:32:52] others but him and I like I said it was
[1:32:57] just two or three nights later when we
[1:32:59] had fellowship and when he left he said
[1:33:03] pray for me
[1:33:04] I said why he said because sometimes he
[1:33:09] said I think I got a religious spirit
[1:33:15] I said yes brother I'll pray for you
[1:33:19] it was a confirmation of what the Lord
[1:33:22] was revealing amen so brother sister
[1:33:26] let's be in the spirit when you come
[1:33:28] come in the spirit everybody when you
[1:33:32] come make sure Jesus are with you not
[1:33:35] that not just with you but he's in you
[1:33:37] amen by the grace of God Alleluia old
[1:33:41] brother he gives he gives her he makes
[1:33:42] us new creatures new attitudes they man
[1:33:46] Alleluia praise the name of the Lord you
[1:33:49] got a different character a man you got
[1:33:52] a different nature actions reactions I
[1:33:55] will Lou you you see things differently
[1:33:58] you express yourself differently a man
[1:34:00] praise the Lord sure brothers sister we
[1:34:06] have received the abundance of grace and
[1:34:08] of the gift of righteousness shall reign
[1:34:12] in life by one Jesus Christ isn't he is
[1:34:17] is the Holy Ghost in control of you that
[1:34:23] if he is Denys Christ living in you if
[1:34:26] he's not then all you got is two
[1:34:29] mechanics not the dynamics god help us
[1:34:35] if that's serious and again in verse 20
[1:34:40] he said moreover the law entered that
[1:34:43] the offence might abound but where sin
[1:34:46] abounded grace did much more about
[1:34:48] hallelujah brother and in this world
[1:34:52] that we're living in now
[1:34:53] sin is abounding and grace is abounding
[1:34:57] much more for the few elected
[1:35:01] predestinated seed of god but you gotta
[1:35:06] want it you've gotta want it that's why
[1:35:12] it's abounding because the seed wants it
[1:35:14] the sons and daughters of God wanted and
[1:35:16] God is going to have it there for them
[1:35:18] amen and it says that as sin had reigned
[1:35:24] unto death even so my grace reigned
[1:35:28] through the righteousness on to eternal
[1:35:31] life
[1:35:31] by Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:35:35] so brother grace as to reign in your
[1:35:39] life be in control of your life by the
[1:35:42] grace of God amen
[1:35:46] bear with me allow me to share with you
[1:35:53] some thoughts and again no doubt maybe
[1:35:55] you heard the message on of grace but
[1:36:02] please hear the word don't hear brother
[1:36:05] Jerome hear the word you got to look
[1:36:10] beyond me hear the word Amen by the
[1:36:17] grace of God look beyond the pre church
[1:36:22] to the to Christ amen
[1:36:27] and he's the Lord and bear this in mind
[1:36:32] the poverty God said this is God's
[1:36:35] judgment seat and he said it's going
[1:36:39] over the pulpit that's right and he said
[1:36:44] by the preacher of the word he said the
[1:36:45] minister is casting out spirits amazing
[1:36:52] but but again if the spirit goes out the
[1:36:55] person's got to recognize it and thank
[1:36:57] God for deliverance thank you Jesus that
[1:37:02] you're helping me thank you Jesus you're
[1:37:05] making me more in your likeness amen
[1:37:09] praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:11] her brother his serious faith comes by
[1:37:16] hearing hearing by the word and it's not
[1:37:20] just what's written in this book it's by
[1:37:24] the it's by the ministry that God has
[1:37:25] said in the church and God and and you
[1:37:29] go through it and again there are those
[1:37:31] that don't believe in the ministry no no
[1:37:36] but Bibles gotcha the Bible says that
[1:37:39] God has set them in the church for the
[1:37:41] perfecting of the saints
[1:37:45] god Elvis for the work of the ministry
[1:37:49] and to build us up in the most holy
[1:37:51] faith and so on by the ministry is there
[1:37:54] to take us on to perfection and on to
[1:37:58] eternity well through the preaching of
[1:38:01] the word but there are those that feel
[1:38:05] that they can do it just by reading the
[1:38:07] Bible they can do it just by reading the
[1:38:09] message book no no no probably God did
[1:38:13] say you won't go no further than the
[1:38:16] pastor and he said he's ordained to lead
[1:38:19] you through and he said you won't live
[1:38:22] any higher than the pastor amen
[1:38:25] grace of God and but again don't you got
[1:38:32] to be careful you know when it comes to
[1:38:34] going to snifter this church that church
[1:38:36] that's a prophet of God said you got to
[1:38:38] go to a church where the pastor's
[1:38:39] anointed by the Holy Ghost cuz he said
[1:38:41] sometimes he said people go to a church
[1:38:43] he said and they just get the spirit of
[1:38:44] the pastor and not the Holy Spirit amen
[1:38:48] grace and in this message on the message
[1:38:54] of grace he did read the scripture that
[1:38:59] we have already read in Zachariah when
[1:39:02] we started this where he said we're at
[1:39:05] that old great mountain before
[1:39:06] zerubabbel and thou shalt become a plane
[1:39:09] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:39:10] there I was shouting crying grace grace
[1:39:14] unto it grace grace unto it amen he said
[1:39:20] but now according to the prophecy there
[1:39:23] will come the headstone and I want you
[1:39:25] to notice that when the headstone comes
[1:39:27] the prints that's going to cry out the
[1:39:30] message will cry grace grace he suffered
[1:39:35] by four hits my grace are we saved and
[1:39:38] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:39:41] and the message of grace has been
[1:39:44] tramped under the feet of men until it's
[1:39:48] become a disgrace and even around the
[1:39:51] message Grace has become a disgrace
[1:39:55] because many a church has become a
[1:39:59] yeah god help us
[1:40:04] and he said some of them runs out into
[1:40:08] eternity eternal security some runs out
[1:40:11] into everything but the true message of
[1:40:13] grace remains the same and he said and
[1:40:18] there's there's where Satan tries to
[1:40:22] knock it out from the church but it's
[1:40:24] the grace of God that we're all saved by
[1:40:28] so in the deity of Jesus Christ the Lord
[1:40:32] God he said could come there and confirm
[1:40:35] that that if that is the truth not only
[1:40:37] that but by his word he confirms it's
[1:40:40] the truth by signs and wonders he
[1:40:43] confirms it's the truth there then also
[1:40:45] grace is the truth then he said they
[1:40:49] could anyone anyone criticize say that
[1:40:52] grace is wrong and he said we're saved
[1:40:55] by works we are saved by grace and
[1:40:58] that's the truth but where the grace
[1:41:01] come from or a dog no come from God's
[1:41:05] love divine love projected grace grace
[1:41:12] thing and brother if we got the faith we
[1:41:16] got the grace of God in our hearts our
[1:41:19] souls we got the love of God in our
[1:41:21] hearts they met we are saved by grace
[1:41:26] and that through faith not by works work
[1:41:29] show that you have been saved but what
[1:41:32] saves you is the grace of God grace
[1:41:36] saves you grace is what God does for you
[1:41:39] works is what you do for God to show
[1:41:41] appreciation of what God did for you but
[1:41:46] by grace are you saved
[1:41:49] amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:41:57] he said listen he said Jesus he took a
[1:42:01] fisherman who were poor and walked the
[1:42:04] common life and that he revealed himself
[1:42:07] and said follow me and I will make you
[1:42:11] fishers of men
[1:42:12] and he should show that His grace still
[1:42:15] reached down even from the Jews to the
[1:42:18] Gentiles to call the people for his name
[1:42:20] in this last days a man and has not
[1:42:25] fishers of men it's the resurrection of
[1:42:30] the rapture amen brother it's a
[1:42:41] revelation that that the folks who
[1:42:45] started the message a new flame didn't
[1:42:47] have you know what their their ministry
[1:42:50] was you know what the revelation was
[1:42:52] that they had and that they preached for
[1:42:56] years under God took him home they
[1:43:01] preached that God had sent a prophet and
[1:43:04] that God's through the Prophet had
[1:43:06] opened the seven seals the mystery of
[1:43:09] God and that was the that was the extent
[1:43:13] of the revelation that they had but they
[1:43:17] didn't go beyond that to realize that in
[1:43:20] those seven seals the third pole was
[1:43:22] rapturing faith a man and that God did
[1:43:28] what he did to give us rapturing faith
[1:43:31] to raise a generation that would get
[1:43:34] that revelation that the hour come for
[1:43:37] the resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:43:40] so we've gone beyond God has sent a
[1:43:43] prophet into the third pole of the
[1:43:48] Resurrection and the rapture amen and
[1:43:52] the prophet of God did I like the fact
[1:43:54] that there were five times that God
[1:44:00] manifested resurrection in his ministry
[1:44:04] amen
[1:44:06] five times that the dead was raised amen
[1:44:14] and it was it was a vindication Amen
[1:44:18] that the ministry was pointing to the
[1:44:20] resurrection and the rapture that the
[1:44:23] ministry would listen saints please in
[1:44:25] the name of Jesus Lutheran and went on
[1:44:28] to justification and made a denomination
[1:44:30] and like I said the others went on to
[1:44:32] sanctification made a denomination and
[1:44:34] the Pentecost was the gifts and the
[1:44:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost and so on and
[1:44:39] they made the nomination out of that but
[1:44:43] the spirit moved on into the prophetic
[1:44:46] ministry of William Branham and the only
[1:44:49] of the word now where do we go from here
[1:44:52] our faith is being challenged where do
[1:44:57] we go from here
[1:44:58] they went on in the faith that God gave
[1:45:01] them in previous ages and they went on
[1:45:03] and on and on and usually the prophet of
[1:45:06] God said after the third or fourth
[1:45:07] generation
[1:45:08] he said they denominated and now more
[1:45:11] and more people are becoming denominated
[1:45:13] around the message they're making
[1:45:16] denominations in over this doctrine over
[1:45:18] this theology over that theology but the
[1:45:22] bride is going to stay separated unto
[1:45:25] the Lord for the resurrection and the
[1:45:27] rapture we're not gonna make a
[1:45:29] denomination out of it not by any means
[1:45:33] no we're gonna keep calling for the
[1:45:36] resurrection we're gonna keep calling
[1:45:38] for the rapture yes is there anything
[1:45:40] that the bride wants brother is the
[1:45:43] resurrection rapture as I said we need a
[1:45:45] greater hunger in our souls than the
[1:45:48] hunger in our flesh there there are
[1:45:52] believers today who hunger in their
[1:45:55] flesh is greater than the hunger in
[1:45:56] their souls why are they hungry for the
[1:45:59] army for the natural things of life
[1:46:01] they're longing for the natural things
[1:46:03] of life where those that are hungry and
[1:46:07] their souls are hungry for eternity they
[1:46:10] want to get out of here see just like
[1:46:14] the Troma of Israel that came out of
[1:46:16] Egypt
[1:46:17] Joshua Kayla wanted to go in they wanted
[1:46:21] to go and they were listen they took
[1:46:23] such a stand now listen
[1:46:25] they took such a stand to go in they
[1:46:29] were they wanted to force him to go in
[1:46:31] then they go in go in come on we gotta
[1:46:33] go in we got to get in they stood there
[1:46:36] and they end and no doubt they preached
[1:46:37] and preached and preached it under
[1:46:39] finally brother that the Jews took up
[1:46:42] stones to stone them what Moses brought
[1:46:47] them out to go in the prophet of God and
[1:46:51] God in the Providence brought us out to
[1:46:54] go in but how many wants to go Eve
[1:47:00] they're gonna fight and stone those that
[1:47:05] are trying to get the people to just
[1:47:07] just believe for the rapture believe for
[1:47:08] the resurrection come on we got to get
[1:47:10] in and we got to get in no dirt why
[1:47:12] because they have a greater hunger for
[1:47:14] the natural things of life than they do
[1:47:16] the spiritual whether this is real
[1:47:25] do we believe it or don't believe it do
[1:47:28] we believe what God has done and what
[1:47:30] God is doing or don't we believe what
[1:47:32] God was about God is doing is this the
[1:47:35] hour for the resurrection in the rapture
[1:47:37] or what is it we can we consider what's
[1:47:40] going on in the world and around the
[1:47:42] world brother
[1:47:43] the world is insane the world gone crazy
[1:47:49] this is this is not the world we lived
[1:47:51] in a year ago everything is changing so
[1:47:56] quickly no matter where you go ever
[1:47:58] there's nothing nothing normal no more
[1:48:02] that's right brother sister Utah why
[1:48:08] they're eating of the tree of knowledge
[1:48:09] of good and evil it's controlling the
[1:48:12] world the Internet what
[1:48:16] yes it's controlling the world in fact
[1:48:18] as I was telling some brother there last
[1:48:21] few days said that there's certain
[1:48:23] governments in countries over there in
[1:48:25] the in Asia somewhere or Europe and and
[1:48:28] they're trying to stop the young people
[1:48:30] from getting involved with cell phones
[1:48:34] and the Internet why because there's
[1:48:39] changing the way they think it's
[1:48:41] changing the way they act because now is
[1:48:44] part because that cell phone and their
[1:48:46] contact with the internet now is putting
[1:48:47] them in contact with with the Western
[1:48:49] world with America and with Canada and
[1:48:51] with other than their other other
[1:48:53] Western nations and so on and so they
[1:48:56] don't think like like like they were
[1:48:58] thought might be used on like blood like
[1:49:01] they were trained and raised up as Arabs
[1:49:03] and so on no no everything's changing
[1:49:08] and that's why certain government
[1:49:10] severus are trying to get them away from
[1:49:14] from that internet yeah it's
[1:49:18] accomplishing one thing there is a
[1:49:20] company's in another in the Western
[1:49:22] world people are becoming less and less
[1:49:26] spiritual and it might be religious but
[1:49:29] they're not spiritual god help us
[1:49:37] you should remember the first judgement
[1:49:40] seat was upon the earth and it was in
[1:49:42] the Garden of Eden and the last
[1:49:44] judgement seat will be upon the earth at
[1:49:46] the end time the white throne brother
[1:49:49] ray in that hour now
[1:50:00] he said the grace of God reached over
[1:50:02] there to him through them in Noah's time
[1:50:05] he said grace saved Noah not his works
[1:50:09] but grace and it also saved his family
[1:50:14] he said God spoke to him by grace not
[1:50:18] her Abraham he said God spoke to Abraham
[1:50:22] by grace not because he was different
[1:50:25] not because he was a better man but by
[1:50:28] grace God called him and he said the
[1:50:31] Bible clearly makes that known o Abraham
[1:50:33] now Abraham tested God's patience and
[1:50:38] told him and said Abraham stay in the
[1:50:41] land don't you go out of it but as soon
[1:50:44] as famine come in Adam or Abraham run
[1:50:48] yeah god help us they were not going to
[1:50:54] get out of the land of the revealed word
[1:50:57] Abram spoke of us God took Abraham by
[1:51:01] grace and saved him and that's how he
[1:51:03] takes you by grace and how we do test
[1:51:06] his patience that's the truth today

[1:51:18] tomorrow the tummyache comes and we
[1:51:21] don't know whether we believe it or not
[1:51:23] that's true but yet in the midst of all
[1:51:29] of that God wants us to stay put but he
[1:51:33] saves us anyhow if it wasn't the grace
[1:51:36] of God we'd all be gone

[1:52:51] my commentary is written my obituary
[1:52:54] that it won't be read out that I made
[1:52:57] mistakes and done wrong but he'll only
[1:53:00] see the things that I tried to do for
[1:53:02] him amen thank God a man he said he'll
[1:53:07] take the grace of God that I believe in
[1:53:10] and that's where I'm solely trusting for
[1:53:13] upon my own merits I could do no more
[1:53:15] than go in then none of the rest but he
[1:53:19] said upon the grace of God I'm depending
[1:53:22] yes it's grace that i'm depending on he
[1:53:27] said it was grace to David he was grace
[1:53:31] to Moses he goes on explains what
[1:53:34] happened in their lives and the grace of
[1:53:35] God that oh that took over for them he

[1:54:21] dead in Christ rise first then we which
[1:54:23] are alive remaining gonna be caught up
[1:54:24] caught up with them brothers sister
[1:54:30] resurrection and Ralphie faith is not up
[1:54:32] there it's right here and it should be
[1:54:36] in air just as you know like I said
[1:54:40] Luther just all he just rejoiced and
[1:54:44] praise God hallelujah
[1:54:45] Alleluia justification justification I'm
[1:54:47] just a a man he went on for a year after
[1:54:51] year after year I'm justified
[1:54:53] praise the Lord and as the others you
[1:54:56] know when the Pentecostals went off for
[1:54:58] years years and years and years praising
[1:55:01] God and and and talking about the gifts
[1:55:03] of the Spirit of speaking in tongues and
[1:55:05] so on amen
[1:55:07] but then they cool down they made the
[1:55:11] spirit and left of a moved on so brother
[1:55:14] that's what was in them and they moved
[1:55:18] and it moved them that was her faith so
[1:55:20] what's in us what are we believing for
[1:55:23] that was that age that age that age that
[1:55:26] age and what about this age amen her
[1:55:31] brother it ought to be in us now praise
[1:55:33] the Lord we're we're about to go in the
[1:55:36] rapture oh praise the Lord we're about
[1:55:38] to be changed
[1:55:39] I'm when to my entire fide body a man
[1:55:43] well how do you know that well brother
[1:55:45] sister according to the according to the
[1:55:46] Bible we're at the end of all things
[1:55:49] according to the Bible he's finishing
[1:55:50] with the Gentiles he's going back to the
[1:55:52] Jews
[1:55:53] hey man hallelujah amen oh that's right
[1:55:57] but you got to believe it you got to
[1:56:02] believe it Luther had to believe what he
[1:56:03] read concerning justification Pennock
[1:56:06] all said to believe what they read about
[1:56:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:56:11] gift a man hallelujah and as like I said
[1:56:15] that black man that God that God used
[1:56:18] that Pentecostal revival in in the
[1:56:22] United States there like I said he he
[1:56:25] stood the pulpit he put a box over his
[1:56:28] head and pray
[1:56:31] because he didn't want to be disturbed
[1:56:34] amen oh yeah they are they did that I I
[1:56:38] have the the history of the book of it
[1:56:40] and they said he would even grow their
[1:56:42] time after time service after service
[1:56:44] and they ended pray and he get up and he
[1:56:47] put the box over his head and pray and
[1:56:51] pray and pray over they call him for the
[1:56:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gift
[1:56:56] of the Spirit and that's where God
[1:56:59] started that revival they a man he he
[1:57:05] knew this is what God was wanted to do
[1:57:07] and he was hungry and thirsty for and
[1:57:11] God did it
[1:57:14] praise the Lord
[1:57:16] my brother your hunger god I'm good
[1:57:19] Joshua Caleb longer the thirst to get
[1:57:22] him to the promised land God took him in
[1:57:25] and not only that Joshua had the faith
[1:57:29] to stop the SU in and we know that
[1:57:33] Lazarus there in the end or one of the
[1:57:36] not Lazarus but one of the believers in
[1:57:40] the New Testament he stopped he stopped
[1:57:42] the som with his faith yeah Jesus stops
[1:57:47] it who's that and it was the blind man
[1:57:51] they wanted lot of Jesus the healer he
[1:57:55] says your faith is your faith has saved
[1:57:57] you say Amen he said go your way it's
[1:58:02] wrong so II stopped the Esso him but
[1:58:05] Joshua Caleb or judgment stopped the
[1:58:07] issuing because he was having problems
[1:58:10] we went out there he said Lord he said
[1:58:12] to defeat the enemies and we need more
[1:58:14] time he said the day needs to be longer
[1:58:17] hey man
[1:58:18] and so even though he took heed spoke to
[1:58:21] the son to stay still the issue in and
[1:58:25] it stopped
[1:58:28] for almost a day but science knew that
[1:58:37] there was something going on even even
[1:58:39] in modern science and so on but they
[1:58:42] could go back and find the answer at the
[1:58:43] bottle what should be a day and it was
[1:58:47] Joshua was almost today but it was the
[1:58:50] Prophet that prophesied the did did the
[1:58:53] death of a king amen and and as a sign
[1:58:58] he also stopped it and it was G but it
[1:59:02] was only H for a short time so that time
[1:59:05] and Joshua's time made the 24 hours yeah
[1:59:10] that's for that's true oh yes that's
[1:59:13] true science indicates it Sciences yeah
[1:59:16] we agree they thought - it was off
[1:59:20] because of Joshua first but then when
[1:59:23] they when somebody brought in a boat
[1:59:24] that both the Prophet and the King in
[1:59:26] Israel
[1:59:27] oh yeah there was different he made God
[1:59:32] made the full day God is perfect brother
[1:59:36] and God knows what he's doing
[1:59:39] brother you don't you don't have to
[1:59:41] worry about God you don't have to think
[1:59:44] that God made a mistake here made a
[1:59:45] mistake there nothing tough God's made
[1:59:47] no mistakes we make mistakes
[1:59:50] God don't praise the Lord amen
[1:59:59] oh he should think of love and grace
[2:00:08] I'll had the bring it to a conclusion he
[2:00:13] should think of love and grace as
[2:00:15] sisters twin sisters he says you can't
[2:00:20] have grace without having love amen do
[2:00:32] you have love
[2:00:37] yeah
[2:00:39] divine law oh yeah I got I got love yeah
[2:00:45] lovest thou me more than these something
[2:00:51] you got love what do you love who do you
[2:00:54] love
[2:00:56] Amen God Elvis
[2:01:07] grace
[2:01:12] do you love the body of Christ and I'm
[2:01:18] not talking about this I'm talking with
[2:01:22] the many membered body hallelujah the
[2:01:27] sons and daughters of God a man the
[2:01:31] brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ and
[2:01:34] now the Bride of Christ you know just
[2:01:40] like the bread the man one time was
[2:01:42] interviewed when the prophet of God was
[2:01:43] God took him home and the interviewed a
[2:01:47] certain individual in a certain
[2:01:50] denominational Church Catholic Church I
[2:01:55] have the newspaper home and they said
[2:01:58] and he was explaining about William
[2:02:00] Brennan he said listen he said the one
[2:02:04] thing about William Branham he said I'll
[2:02:06] never forget he said I knew it was
[2:02:10] anything that he had and he felt toward
[2:02:15] Jesus it was love he said you only had
[2:02:18] to talk to him and you knew he loved you
[2:02:21] I said well I said he won't lose his
[2:02:25] reward not for that testimony they may
[2:02:30] just think he recognized that praise the
[2:02:33] Lord so he said think of love and grace
[2:02:36] as sisters twin sisters you can't have
[2:02:41] grace without having love and before you
[2:02:45] can have grace you have to have love and
[2:02:48] before you can actually show some
[2:02:50] somebody a favor
[2:02:52] you love them right or wrong you have to
[2:02:56] love them amen knowing that did you love
[2:03:01] them you'll show that love God brought
[2:03:03] grace into our lives by his love for us
[2:03:08] amen and that's the truth
[2:03:14] he said I am nothing until charity comes
[2:03:18] in which is love love listen love is
[2:03:22] grace the grace of God that does all
[2:03:27] God's grace cannot be bargained for
[2:03:31] he said it is Sovereign Grace nothing in
[2:03:36] my arms I bring simply to thy cross I
[2:03:39] cling amen just as I am amen
[2:03:46] the grace of God while the diminish
[2:04:01] they're with me that's grace
[2:04:13] he said we speak when the Holy Ghost
[2:04:15] speaks and we only let that come three
[2:04:19] times and he said two can't be while I'm
[2:04:23] preaching or in order because the spirit
[2:04:25] of the prophets is subject to the
[2:04:26] Prophet
[2:04:27] a man he said there's five offices in
[2:04:35] the church apostles prophets teachers
[2:04:39] evangelists pastors that's ordained

[2:05:35] hand of the Majesty on I ever living to

[2:05:40] man he is the high priest making
[2:05:44] intercession upon our confession and he
[2:05:49] can't do nothing until first we confess
[2:05:52] then he's done it a man your faith
[2:05:56] because you believe you're a Christian

[2:06:01] now and he said if you want to raise a
[2:06:03] little higher just to have more faith
[2:06:06] because it's unlimited Jesus Christ
[2:06:09] dwells in his people we'll finish that
[2:06:15] there it is the message of grace and all
[2:06:19] the way through it the prophet of God is
[2:06:21] highlighting the grace of God in the
[2:06:23] lives of those in the scriptures and in
