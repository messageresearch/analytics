[56:45] the grace of God be with us be in prayer
[56:47] amen
[56:49] praying the grace of God be with our
[56:51] brother Paul the grace of God be with us
[56:53] a man the minister what we have need of
[56:56] a man and there's not just anything not
[57:00] just the message when it comes to the
[57:02] doctrine but rather we got to focus on
[57:04] why God did it and and are we focusing
[57:08] on it the resurrection and the rapture
[57:09] to give us the faith that we need in
[57:12] this hour as God gave as I we we
[57:14] repeated it so often but God gave a new
[57:18] third the faith that he needed and the
[57:19] Lutheran's and the Methodists the faith
[57:21] that they needed for the take them
[57:23] through that age a man and the
[57:25] Pentecostals it takes him through that
[57:27] age but now he's thinking he's giving us
[57:29] a faith to go through the bright age a
[57:31] man by the grace of God
[57:33] this is tremendous let's get me on again
[57:35] the the ideas of loud Asiya and let's
[57:39] get into the bride age let's have the
[57:42] revelation of the bride age and brother
[57:44] I tell you I pray that we're going to
[57:46] have the bride revival and brother what
[57:48] is a revival how does a revival manifest
[57:52] itself it has a zeal and an enthusiasm
[57:54] for what God is doing amen
[57:57] that's right so it's not the past but
[58:00] it's the present we're caught up with
[58:01] what God is doing today
[58:03] amen what God is doing in us by the
[58:06] grace of God for these last song about
[58:08] 40 years amen so what has God
[58:11] accomplished in us in the last 40 years
[58:14] we
[58:15] got a comedy scene you since you were
[58:17] baptized you know in the name of the
[58:19] Lord Jesus Christ since you received
[58:21] acknowledge that this is God a man that
[58:25] is not man it is God so the grace of God
[58:28] brothers sister that we're going to get
[58:30] caught up a man in the revelation of the
[58:33] bride revival we're going to have the
[58:35] zeal and the enthusiasm of the bride
[58:37] revival now the Pentecostals not the
[58:40] others but the bride a man and brother
[58:42] it's the revelation that God gives us in
[58:45] this hour the mystery that God reveals
[58:47] in this hour that gives us that zeal and
[58:49] that enthusiasm you got you've got to
[58:51] have a revelation a main way what makes
[58:53] your zealous what what and watch the
[58:56] enthusiasm for a man what it what are
[59:00] you jealous for what are you enthused
[59:01] for about a man and further for the
[59:04] Pentecostals it was the gifts from the
[59:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost but for the
[59:07] right it's the resurrection rapture a
[59:09] man so buddy and brother a lot of you
[59:12] are still there just basically
[59:14] Pentecostals and and you did waiting for
[59:16] those waiting for that well we're into
[59:18] the revelation of it we're into the
[59:20] mystery of God revealing it a man the
[59:22] resurrection and the rapture to the many
[59:25] consoles it was up there
[59:26] to us it's here a man that's the truth
[59:29] the Pentecostals believe that the
[59:31] Pentecostal message was going to take
[59:33] them on to the resurrection rapture but
[59:36] they did but they never recognized what
[59:38] God was going to do and how God was
[59:39] going to do it amen
[59:41] the crown has that were of the
[59:43] Pentecostal message a man so I pray
[59:46] grace God help us to believe God help us
[59:49] to recognize what you are doing and Lord
[59:51] that it's going to and if we really
[59:53] recognize it if we really got the
[59:54] revelation of it and we're going to have
[59:56] the zeal and the enthusiasm of the bride
[59:59] revival a man neither zeal in the
[1:00:02] enthusiasm of Pentecost or he or even a
[1:00:05] goddess and a prophet no no now it's a
[1:00:08] it's the coming of the son of man a man
[1:00:10] is the son of man here to catch his
[1:00:13] bride away by the grace of God and
[1:00:15] that's where our zeal and enthusiasm is
[1:00:18] by the grace of God amen and all down
[1:00:22] through the word on through the
[1:00:23] scriptures all down through history the
[1:00:25] saints of God have been caught up with
[1:00:27] zeal and enthusiasm
[1:00:28] and what God was doing in their day and
[1:00:31] in their age what God had revealed to
[1:00:34] them amen
[1:00:35] that's what they were living for if
[1:00:37] that's what they died for that's what
[1:00:39] give him the faith that they needed a
[1:00:41] man so let's consider the faith that God
[1:00:43] has given us in this hour that we might
[1:00:46] truly honestly and sincerely be
[1:00:48] overcomers a man so we're going to try
[1:00:51] to bring that stat series that message
[1:00:53] to a conclusion on how can I overcome
[1:00:56] the proverb pres I said the father
[1:00:58] preached it because he knew that they
[1:01:00] needed this revelation and brother they
[1:01:03] needed it then we need it now a man by
[1:01:06] the grace of God and in the Book of
[1:01:09] Daniel this River st. and Dan but Daniel
[1:01:17] purposed in his heart that he would not
[1:01:19] defile himself with the portion of the
[1:01:22] Kings meat you've got to determine that
[1:01:25] in your heart you gotta be led by the
[1:01:27] Holy Ghost and he said with the portion
[1:01:30] of the Kings meat nor with the wine
[1:01:32] which he drank therefore he requested of
[1:01:35] the Prince of the eunuchs that he might
[1:01:39] not defile himself a man now he said God
[1:01:43] and brought Daniel into favor and tender
[1:01:46] love with the Prince of the eunuchs and
[1:01:50] the Prince of the eunuchs said unto
[1:01:52] Daniel I fear my lord the king who has
[1:01:56] appointed your meat and your drink for
[1:01:58] why should he see your faces worse
[1:02:01] liking than the children which are of
[1:02:04] your sort and then shall he make me
[1:02:08] endanger my head to the King a man they
[1:02:12] wanted Daniel and the three but children
[1:02:14] a man to two to give up while they
[1:02:19] believed to compromise on what they
[1:02:21] believe compromise on their faith amen
[1:02:24] and that's a challenge that you and I
[1:02:26] are facing today is the compromise on
[1:02:28] our faith to compromise on what we
[1:02:31] believe compromise on what God yes has
[1:02:33] done but what God is doing by the grace
[1:02:36] of God a man is tremendous so I pray God
[1:02:39] we're gonna believe the word we're going
[1:02:41] to
[1:02:41] the message the whole truth and nothing
[1:02:43] but the truth and I just believe this
[1:02:45] doctrine that doctrine but believe all
[1:02:46] that the prophets of to get us in line
[1:02:49] for the resurrection and the rapture to
[1:02:51] get us ready for the resurrection and
[1:02:53] the rapture
[1:02:53] not just to get us out of systems but to
[1:02:56] get us into the word amen to get us into
[1:02:58] the revelation of the resurrection
[1:03:00] rapture again not like that that person
[1:03:03] has said that kneel to me beside me at
[1:03:05] that and that all four years ago all
[1:03:07] thank you Lord for bringing us out of
[1:03:08] denominations now we don't have to be
[1:03:10] serving to any man I said Lord Ashley
[1:03:12] she needs your help
[1:03:14] a man to give her a right attitude and a
[1:03:16] right spirit and to give her the
[1:03:17] revelation of what you have done and
[1:03:20] what you are doing a man to God be the
[1:03:23] glory
[1:03:23] so brother God had brought Daniel into
[1:03:26] favour and tender love with the princess
[1:03:28] of the eunuch and the Prince of the
[1:03:30] eunuchs said unto Daniel I fear the Lord
[1:03:33] my lord the king who has appointed you
[1:03:36] meat and your drink for why should he
[1:03:40] see your faces worse liking then the
[1:03:43] children which are of your sort a man
[1:03:46] other Jews did is they that as they were
[1:03:50] supposed to eat and drink and whatever
[1:03:52] in Babylon but Daniel in the three but
[1:03:56] children amen they maintained their
[1:03:58] stand they mean their name their faith
[1:04:00] for God and they weren't going to
[1:04:02] compromise not even for the King a man
[1:04:04] grace to us we're not going to
[1:04:06] compromise or nobody and no nothing amen
[1:04:09] we're going to stay with the Lord by the
[1:04:12] grace of God amen that's the ones that
[1:04:15] are ordained for the resurrection
[1:04:16] ordained by the rapture brother boy it
[1:04:20] takes that uncompromising attitude
[1:04:22] uncompromising spirit to get the faith
[1:04:25] for the resurrection and rapture amen
[1:04:27] if there's any compromise God cannot go
[1:04:30] all the way with you amen
[1:04:32] nor can we go all the way with God but
[1:04:35] Daniel and the three were children
[1:04:36] wanted to go all the way with God and
[1:04:39] they were not going to compromise they
[1:04:42] were going to be overcomers
[1:04:43] amen amen overcome the world overcome
[1:04:47] the flesh overcome the devil overcome
[1:04:49] the threats a man that was being given
[1:04:52] to them amen
[1:04:54] are we going to endure in this hour and
[1:04:57] in this age what they endured in Babylon
[1:04:59] a man by his tremendous well they they
[1:05:03] they were Jesus weren't Willie oh they
[1:05:05] could have went through the motions of
[1:05:06] it they could have got down and bowed
[1:05:07] down to that image read the King inmate
[1:05:09] Daniel could have do it just goes
[1:05:11] through the motions well I don't really
[1:05:12] do it but I I don't really believe it
[1:05:14] but I'll do it you know just for their
[1:05:16] sake no no one of them for God's sake
[1:05:19] God has got an preeminence in your life
[1:05:21] God have preeminence in my life amen
[1:05:24] not my will father thine be done
[1:05:27] ain't man so you got to stop thinking
[1:05:30] you got to start believing a man you got
[1:05:32] to lay inside your thoughts a man
[1:05:34] because it's the devil in your thoughts
[1:05:36] a man so let's believe the Word of God
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:40] thus said the Lord regardless of the
[1:05:43] place we got to pay a man believe God
[1:05:45] believe the word and that's what Daniel
[1:05:50] any man that's the test why we have
[1:05:52] their testimony in this book today is
[1:05:53] because they were over commerce they
[1:05:56] overcome the world the flesh and the
[1:05:58] devil in the end up and the country they
[1:06:00] lived in in Babylon and even the even
[1:06:03] they are the rules and regulations and
[1:06:05] laws new laws that the King had laid
[1:06:07] laid out yeah you had to do this you had
[1:06:10] to do this you gotta worship this image
[1:06:11] and so on and no way they said we're
[1:06:14] gonna work for God a man they maintained
[1:06:17] their faith and he said for why should
[1:06:20] he see your face it's worse liking than
[1:06:23] the children which are of your sort
[1:06:25] those that were compromising and then
[1:06:28] showed he make me endanger my head to
[1:06:31] the king then said Daniel to melzar whom
[1:06:34] the Prince of the eunuchs had set over
[1:06:37] Daniel Ananias Mishael and Azariah
[1:06:41] Azariah proved thy servants I beseech
[1:06:45] thee 10 days and let them give us pulse
[1:06:49] to eat water to drink and then that our
[1:06:52] countenance be looked upon before thee
[1:06:55] and the candidates of the children that
[1:06:57] eat of the portion of the Kings meat and
[1:07:00] as I see us deal with I servants amen
[1:07:04] praise the name of the Lord so he
[1:07:07] consented to
[1:07:08] them in this matter and he proved them
[1:07:11] ten days God is proving us a man he most
[1:07:17] definitely is proving us are we going to
[1:07:19] stay with the with the read with the
[1:07:21] written word how are we going to stay
[1:07:23] with the revealed word a man by the
[1:07:25] grace of God God is testing us God is
[1:07:28] proving us amen
[1:07:29] bringing out the resurrection and
[1:07:31] rapture in faith they made the take us
[1:07:33] off the earth and at the end of ten days
[1:07:36] their countenances appeared fairer and
[1:07:41] fatter in flesh than all the children
[1:07:44] which did eat the portion of the Kings
[1:07:47] meat amen
[1:07:49] we're going to say and eat they eat the
[1:07:51] Kings meat now we're going to be more
[1:07:53] healthy than they were than the others
[1:07:55] we're going stronger than the others
[1:07:57] we're going to have the faith that
[1:07:58] pleases God we're gonna have the greater
[1:08:00] revelation of the resurrection and the
[1:08:02] rapture amen
[1:08:03] we're going to be overcomers a man and
[1:08:07] it says then mel SAR took away the
[1:08:09] portion of their meat and the wine that
[1:08:12] they should drink and gave them pulse
[1:08:14] and as for these four children God gave
[1:08:18] them knowledge and skill in all learning
[1:08:22] and wisdom and Daniel had understanding
[1:08:25] in all visions and dreams amen so we're
[1:08:32] going to say with the word God's going
[1:08:34] to bless us with the revelation we need
[1:08:36] God is going to bless us with it with
[1:08:39] the encouragement that we need God is
[1:08:41] gonna bless us with the zeal and the
[1:08:43] enthusiasm that he is looking for in the
[1:08:46] bright praise the name of the Lord and
[1:08:48] it says now at the end of the days that
[1:08:51] the king of cedi should bring them in
[1:08:53] then the princess of the eunuchs brought
[1:08:55] them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the
[1:08:58] King commune with him and among them all
[1:09:00] was found none like Daniel and Aniyah
[1:09:05] and Mishael and Azariah therefore stood
[1:09:09] they before the king and in all matters
[1:09:13] of wisdom and understanding that the
[1:09:17] King inquired of them he found them ten
[1:09:19] times better
[1:09:21] than all the magicians and astrologers
[1:09:24] that were in all Israel and Daniel
[1:09:29] continued even under the first year of
[1:09:32] King Cyrus god bless his word you may be
[1:09:36] seated
[1:09:37] and as they continued in the word they
[1:09:40] may maintain their a man their power
[1:09:42] over the world their power over the
[1:09:44] flesh and over the devil a man now in
[1:09:47] this case God did give them favor with
[1:09:50] the king
[1:09:51] but eventually they would lose that
[1:09:53] favor amen eventually God was going to
[1:09:56] bring them out and send them back to the
[1:09:58] promised land send them back to the
[1:10:00] Jerusalem the old Jerusalem a man and
[1:10:03] they would rebuild that Jerusalem they
[1:10:06] were over commerce so brother and sister
[1:10:09] God looking for that that spirit of
[1:10:11] overcoming in us in you and in me god
[1:10:15] help us amen
[1:10:17] so that we are over and then the thing
[1:10:18] you have to overcome alternative mother
[1:10:21] number one is yourself
[1:10:23] Amen man when it comes to the witness
[1:10:26] brought out here in the message how can
[1:10:27] I overcome the prophet of God also
[1:10:30] highlights the fact that you have to
[1:10:31] humble yourself it's over you know the
[1:10:35] victory overcoming it begins with
[1:10:37] humility you got a home of yourself you
[1:10:39] want to overcome then you got to humble
[1:10:41] yourself but easy but you got to humble
[1:10:42] yourself to God you're gonna owe me
[1:10:44] herself to the will of God amen not my
[1:10:47] will thine be done
[1:10:48] you're gonna home by yourself and have
[1:10:50] that same spirit and that same attitude
[1:10:52] that God had when he was in place
[1:10:54] remember he was your example and not was
[1:10:57] he is he is our example even now he was
[1:11:01] Luther's example Wesley's example the
[1:11:03] Pentecostal example other other saints
[1:11:05] of God that took their stand for him a
[1:11:07] man that they would be overcomers in
[1:11:10] their day and in their age they would
[1:11:12] overcome the world they would overcome
[1:11:14] their flesh and they would overcome the
[1:11:16] devil a man so the devil wasn't going to
[1:11:19] get victory over them that's through the
[1:11:22] influence of the world the victory
[1:11:23] wasn't going to get influence over them
[1:11:25] for the influence of their flesh a man
[1:11:28] and certainly not the devil himself be a
[1:11:30] man because like like Daniel and the
[1:11:33] three Hebrew children the
[1:11:34] they believe God they believe the Word
[1:11:36] of God they had a revelation of the word
[1:11:38] what a revelation they had to take the
[1:11:41] stand that they took brother it wasn't a
[1:11:44] knowledge in their heads but there was
[1:11:46] something that they had in their hearts
[1:11:47] or in their souls amen by the grace of
[1:11:50] Almighty God amen - for them to take the
[1:11:53] standard they took when they were faced
[1:11:55] with what the world was going to do to
[1:11:57] them what the king was going to do and
[1:11:59] what the government was in Babylon was
[1:12:01] going to do with the three bo children a
[1:12:03] man is going to throw them into a
[1:12:05] furnace of fire a man there was no
[1:12:07] hesitation a man none whatsoever why
[1:12:10] because they had the spirit of an
[1:12:12] overcomer a man and the overcomers not
[1:12:15] going to compromise the overcomers not
[1:12:17] going to do this and do that I'll do it
[1:12:19] this way I'll do that we know you've got
[1:12:20] to do it the right way a man you got to
[1:12:22] do it God's Way any man and they knew
[1:12:25] that and they had that revelation of the
[1:12:27] other of the other children of Israel
[1:12:30] that was in Babylon they never had that
[1:12:32] faith they may say I know they get
[1:12:34] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:12:36] way and few there be that find it a man
[1:12:38] whether it's in Israel whether it's
[1:12:41] whether it's here among the Gentiles and
[1:12:43] when it comes to all those that don't
[1:12:45] believe it don't see it don't understand
[1:12:47] it
[1:12:48] Amen they're multitudes but again
[1:12:51] they're the ones that God has called and
[1:12:53] chosen Amen they're gonna be very very
[1:12:55] few in number compared to the others
[1:12:57] even as we're going to get less and less
[1:12:59] when it comes to believing God and
[1:13:01] having zeal and enthusiasm with the
[1:13:03] resurrection and rapture
[1:13:05] we're gonna be very very very few that's
[1:13:07] why there's going to be so few caught up
[1:13:10] in the rapture to meet the Lord in the
[1:13:11] air
[1:13:12] amen because why they're not nigh they
[1:13:14] turned they don't believe God sent a
[1:13:16] prophet not they don't believe that God
[1:13:18] opened the seven seals but they haven't
[1:13:20] entered into the revelation of what God
[1:13:22] has done and why God did it a man
[1:13:24] there's a reason why God did this is the
[1:13:27] reason why God did that a man and his
[1:13:29] children went forth and lived according
[1:13:32] and their lives based on why God did
[1:13:35] this why God did that
[1:13:36] what was God expecting from them amen
[1:13:39] this is what they witness from God now
[1:13:41] what is God looking for in them there we
[1:13:44] look for their God to do this God to do
[1:13:46] that and the father did
[1:13:48] he said that's not a problem he said we
[1:13:50] all want God to do this God do that God
[1:13:52] do that what are you gonna do any man
[1:13:54] for the Lord
[1:13:55] it's either my against the Bible says in
[1:13:58] all thy ways acknowledge him and he will
[1:14:01] direct your advances a man you have to
[1:14:03] acknowledge him in all areas of your
[1:14:05] life in every every decision you got to
[1:14:08] make you're going to consult the Lord
[1:14:09] amen not my real father thine be done
[1:14:12] what is your will in this what is your
[1:14:14] will in that amen so the grace of God
[1:14:17] brother that we're going to find the
[1:14:18] will of God stay in the will of God and
[1:14:20] we're going to live out the will of God
[1:14:22] we're going to stand for the will of God
[1:14:24] a man now a when it comes to
[1:14:27] intellectual knowledge and the wisdom of
[1:14:30] man all the way I will do this you and
[1:14:32] you should do this as Satan's influence
[1:14:33] a man as Satan's influence because again
[1:14:37] brother sister or mine as the enemy to
[1:14:44] see them in the Garden of Eden and what
[1:14:46] he gave them the word but he had it or
[1:14:50] to it he's a saint he said God yeah as
[1:14:53] God said but forget the what's a man and
[1:14:57] he made them to believe that it was good
[1:15:00] he made them to believe that it was for
[1:15:03] their benefit he made him with a believe
[1:15:05] that they oh they were going to prosper
[1:15:06] they were going to be like they say
[1:15:08] they're gonna be like God or God's a man
[1:15:11] and that's the truth because the woman
[1:15:14] went in told Adam and she said yeah he
[1:15:16] said she said they it's good for food
[1:15:18] and it is pleasant to the eyes and
[1:15:20] desired to make one wise a man he was
[1:15:23] appealing to the human nature a man
[1:15:26] benign to the Holy Ghost nature nigh to
[1:15:29] their spiritual nature and the son and a
[1:15:32] daughter of Almighty God amen brother
[1:15:35] sister so we got ahead of that nature in
[1:15:36] us that nature is going to be in control
[1:15:38] that nature has gotta be our leadership
[1:15:40] a man not my wield I will Lord amen
[1:15:44] what does God feel what does God think
[1:15:46] and what would God do what would Jesus
[1:15:48] do a man a man show everybody he didn't
[1:15:51] didn't take that a man this is amazing
[1:15:54] they wouldn't believe the whole truth
[1:15:56] nothing but the truth
[1:15:57] they believe the truth but they added
[1:16:00] it but they interpreted it they they're
[1:16:03] their own ideas to it under Satan's
[1:16:05] influence a man and there are many a
[1:16:08] message believer today they're stating
[1:16:09] their own ideas to the message and to
[1:16:12] the Word of God into what God has done
[1:16:13] and what God is doing
[1:16:14] Amen it's the influence of the devil you
[1:16:17] know do this do this is good for food
[1:16:19] it's good for this is pleasant to the
[1:16:20] eyes so you go this way that's the way
[1:16:22] God wants you to go God wants you to go
[1:16:24] his way
[1:16:25] amen and to us it may not seem like good
[1:16:28] food it may not seem too pleasant to the
[1:16:31] natural man amen
[1:16:32] no not indeed and it may not it may not
[1:16:36] be with them when it because you all
[1:16:38] that now there's something wrong there
[1:16:40] but it is the wisdom of God now there is
[1:16:43] no man by the wisdom of God so what
[1:16:46] wisdom governs your life while you
[1:16:48] wisdom controls you it is your natural
[1:16:51] human wisdom or as it is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:53] wisdom a man according to the Word of
[1:16:56] God because I'm sure that they didn't
[1:16:58] think that Jesus was very wise a man but
[1:17:01] he was the King and Lord of wisdom a man
[1:17:04] but if they didn't think he was wise
[1:17:06] because of what he did and how he did
[1:17:08] and so on a man but but see again when
[1:17:12] it comes to the wisdom of God the wisdom
[1:17:13] of God is so contrary to the ways of man
[1:17:16] and so country the ways of the devil
[1:17:18] ain't man brother we've got it we got to
[1:17:21] learn to se it's faith it's revealed now
[1:17:24] God is asking you to walk in it it's
[1:17:26] revealed so God allows you to believe it
[1:17:28] God's asking you to stay with it amen
[1:17:30] the enemy is there to get us to
[1:17:31] compromise the enemy is there to get us
[1:17:33] to reason but we got a cast on reasoning
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:37] we gotta have as I said that that
[1:17:39] perfect faith that believes and know
[1:17:41] knowing that there's no room for
[1:17:42] questions no room for doubt amen by the
[1:17:45] grace of God and as it is as where the
[1:17:48] the faith of the Jews so it was with
[1:17:50] Daniel so was with the three more
[1:17:52] children a man there's no question they
[1:17:55] had no doubt whatsoever a man the king
[1:17:57] and the others were trying to get trying
[1:18:01] to get the three Burchill under to
[1:18:02] wrestle with it and a reason and and oh
[1:18:05] you need to use some wheel you know
[1:18:07] wisdom oh you know not only goes with
[1:18:10] somebody even wisdom amen why because
[1:18:12] they when they show them the fire
[1:18:14] the fiery furnace they wound up Alamein
[1:18:16] a man and they said another well you
[1:18:19] either bow down or we will cast you down
[1:18:21] here a man there was no hesitation in
[1:18:24] their faith
[1:18:25] brother that's a dare overcomers it was
[1:18:29] so natural with them a man when it comes
[1:18:31] to that nature to believe God a man God
[1:18:34] Elvis to have that nature god help us to
[1:18:37] have that and overcome 'edit overcoming
[1:18:39] spirit a man not even listen to the
[1:18:41] flesh not listen to the devil no matter
[1:18:44] what the circumstances no matter what

[1:18:55] said you'd never leave me nor forsake me
[1:18:57] you'll be with me even in me to the end
[1:18:59] of the age amen
[1:19:00] so Lord it's not me that leaves us crazy
[1:19:02] I live within me amen and Lord you lay
[1:19:04] down your life you picked it up again
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:07] so you're and you're more than a
[1:19:08] conqueror and you make us more than
[1:19:10] conquerors amen the victory that you won
[1:19:13] Lord you give it to us amen
[1:19:15] he was an overcomer and brother talk
[1:19:17] about overcoming he overcome the world
[1:19:19] all right he overcome the flesh and he
[1:19:21] overcome the devil amen and went and got
[1:19:24] the keys of death l of the grave and and
[1:19:26] brought it back amen to give it to you
[1:19:28] in me
[1:19:29] amen by the grace of Almighty God so
[1:19:32] brother I pray the grace of God we're
[1:19:33] going to be overcomers as Christ was an
[1:19:35] overcomer Annie Annie Annie came back
[1:19:38] into his elect so as to make his elect
[1:19:40] over comers that even as he overcome now
[1:19:44] we're going to overcome and again we
[1:19:46] know that it's not me it's Christ in me
[1:19:48] hey man so brother sister I trust that
[1:19:51] your life and your attitude and your
[1:19:53] spirit is going to reflect what Christ
[1:19:56] in you and it's not you this talking is
[1:19:58] not you this acting is not you that's
[1:20:00] reacting it is Christ in you a man by
[1:20:03] the grace of God showing that you are in
[1:20:05] overcomer
[1:20:06] you have overcome the world the flesh
[1:20:08] the devil and again understanding that
[1:20:10] the prophet of God preached this because
[1:20:12] he was ministering to those in his own
[1:20:14] church that were not overcomers a man
[1:20:17] and as it was with Eve so it was with a
[1:20:21] number in his own church though it was
[1:20:24] good too good for food
[1:20:26] the ice thing to be desired to make one
[1:20:28] wise and so on and they were being
[1:20:30] caught up with those things and they
[1:20:33] were getting away from the zeal and the
[1:20:35] enthusiasm of the relevant word a man
[1:20:38] see brother/sister that as long as the
[1:20:40] problem was there with the first and the
[1:20:42] second Pole they were enthusiastic oh
[1:20:44] they were zealous they were imposed a
[1:20:47] man over the ministry of the prophet of
[1:20:49] god amen amen but again it gives a
[1:20:52] reason and since get the people to
[1:20:54] believe by those signs are only their
[1:20:57] attention ain't man and once they got
[1:21:00] their attention he would go to the third
[1:21:02] Pole the word a man bring out bring out
[1:21:05] what was really in them do they believe
[1:21:06] the word amen
[1:21:08] do they really believe it brother for
[1:21:10] the angel said now brother around stop
[1:21:12] using those signs because they're
[1:21:14] leaning on a sign folks and again a lot
[1:21:17] of a lot of those that profess to
[1:21:18] believe brother Brown they were leaning
[1:21:20] on the same post and when he stopped
[1:21:22] using the signs and started to get into
[1:21:24] the word and then the word the word for
[1:21:26] the resurrection for the rapture and the
[1:21:28] emphasis on on what God was doing to get
[1:21:30] us out of here
[1:21:31] amen they were losing their zeal and
[1:21:33] their enthusiasm brother I tell you
[1:21:35] there's more zeal and enthusiasm over
[1:21:37] doctrines and today and over this idea
[1:21:41] this theology that theology than it is
[1:21:43] over the resurrection and the rapture
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:46] oh they're still contained or we're
[1:21:48] going to believe this we believe that oh
[1:21:50] this dis doctrine is wonderful this this
[1:21:53] this doctrine is tremendous a man but
[1:21:56] what is it doing for you
[1:21:57] any man whatever what is God revealing
[1:22:00] to you through all of these things a man
[1:22:02] the very thing that God has done proves
[1:22:06] what God is doing it'll point of what
[1:22:08] God is doing a man that's why he stopped
[1:22:11] the signs and wonders so they get a bit
[1:22:13] of focus unwell well where's William
[1:22:17] Branham where's the signs and the
[1:22:18] wonders we had gone from that to the
[1:22:21] word a man even our Lord in his ministry
[1:22:25] 2000 years ago and he went from the
[1:22:27] signs and the wonders to the word
[1:22:29] a man he went to what to fulfill the
[1:22:32] scripture that he was at Ely was made
[1:22:34] flesh to fulfill and now brother and
[1:22:37] sister you and I are moving on in the
[1:22:39] world
[1:22:39] so the to fulfill the scripture that God
[1:22:42] has ordained for us to be fulfilled in a
[1:22:44] man brother and it's Mandir it's more
[1:22:48] than what Wesleyan is more than what the
[1:22:50] other said amen
[1:22:52] this is the resurrection and the rapture
[1:22:54] a man and brother just just Wesley's
[1:22:57] faith is not going to do it just the
[1:22:59] Methodist Raider the Pentecostal faith
[1:23:00] is not going to do it no way amen God
[1:23:04] had to reveal this mystery that mystery
[1:23:06] the beginning the end eternity down
[1:23:08] through time and back to eternity a man
[1:23:10] to give us the revelation of God in the
[1:23:12] beginning to give us the revelation of
[1:23:14] God in in in in time and to give us a
[1:23:17] revelation of God going back to eternity

[1:23:29] your life and mine a million brother God

[1:23:34] doctrines and theologies for the Bride

[1:23:38] but I'm not talking about the others are
[1:23:41] the the many of their that are called by
[1:23:43] talking about those that are chosen and
[1:23:44] that is the Bride of Christ as I

[1:23:52] for the bride the message is only for
[1:23:55] the bride amen
[1:23:56] that's why yeah that's why you got to
[1:23:58] have God's leadership ain't man that's
[1:24:00] why the ministry needs God's leadership

[1:24:41] the life if you want to be a witness to
[1:24:44] them let your life be the witness a man
[1:24:47] but when it comes to getting into this
[1:24:49] doctrine this doctor of that doctrine
[1:24:51] brother it's hoarding and
[1:24:52] destinated for the bride a man-god for a
[1:24:56] dame the revelation of the mystery of
[1:24:57] God amen the only of the seven seals
[1:25:00] before day those Saints whether that's
[1:25:02] the trumpets a man is for ordained for
[1:25:05] the bride for the resurrection for the
[1:25:07] rapture
[1:25:08] for the Lord Himself said descend from
[1:25:10] heaven with a shout and the voice of the
[1:25:12] Archangel and the Trump of God and the
[1:25:14] dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:25:17] amen amen brother as a man it's the
[1:25:22] elect it seems like when Jesus came the
[1:25:24] first time any-any when he laid down his
[1:25:27] life and he picked it up again in
[1:25:28] resurrection power amen the Bible says
[1:25:31] that not not all not all the data they
[1:25:34] are under under the Old Covenant not all
[1:25:36] of them raised amen no but it says many
[1:25:39] many of them many of the graves opened
[1:25:42] up and they came forth and went into the
[1:25:44] city and appeared unto many a man many
[1:25:48] of them but not all of them for there
[1:25:50] any gains of singing with the rapture
[1:25:52] brothers a bride has gone into rapture
[1:25:54] but not all that not all so-called
[1:25:55] Christians not all so-called believers a
[1:25:58] man because the Bible said you were a
[1:26:00] one oneness prophecy there concerning
[1:26:04] what was going to happen and the dating
[1:26:07] Christ was going to witness a man
[1:26:09] the dead are going to witness the union
[1:26:11] of the bride and the bridegroom the the
[1:26:14] early bride in the heavenly bridegroom a
[1:26:16] man but it says and the rest of the day
[1:26:19] they have not again for a thousand years
[1:26:21] a man praise the name of the Lord do not
[1:26:23] lost no way praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:26] because even in the judgment are given
[1:26:28] white robes praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:31] and says go this way go this way and
[1:26:33] brother who's there in the German is the
[1:26:35] bridegroom and the bride a man and right
[1:26:38] in the last book of the Bible says in
[1:26:40] the spirit and the bride a man will
[1:26:43] praise the Lord what a position she's in
[1:26:46] the spirit of the bride say come
[1:26:49] amen and drink of the water of life
[1:26:51] freely but he's somebody but again the
[1:26:54] warning is there don't add to don't take
[1:26:56] away a man stay with the word for the
[1:27:00] old god help us Lord to believe that was
[1:27:03] man-boy water what a position to be in
[1:27:06] brother listen ashore our loaf of the
[1:27:08] Lord let sure our thankfulness to the
[1:27:11] Lord a man for bringing us to that place
[1:27:14] a man for making us the bride happy no
[1:27:18] sir said with him in in his throat and
[1:27:20] again to highlight the promise and not
[1:27:22] on the throne but in the throne a man
[1:27:25] and as it is in the word by the grace of
[1:27:28] God amen
[1:27:30] because you're going to judge by the
[1:27:31] word amen because the Bible said the
[1:27:34] book was open and the books were opened
[1:27:37] and again the prophet Agartha what is
[1:27:39] the book it is the Word of God it is the
[1:27:41] book of life the Word of God and the
[1:27:43] books he said are the books of the life
[1:27:46] of the individuals that are being judged
[1:27:48] amen to what extent does their life let
[1:27:51] measure up and line up with what's in
[1:27:54] the book a man there there are those
[1:27:57] that didn't light up at all amen and
[1:28:00] then they're cast into the lake of fire
[1:28:01] and they should have their part or their
[1:28:03] time in the lake that burns with fire
[1:28:05] and brimstone but again there are others
[1:28:07] a man that Ana testimony that please God
[1:28:10] and they're given white robes to enter
[1:28:12] into glory amen
[1:28:14] they're going to be there ain't made by
[1:28:16] the grace of Almighty God again is a
[1:28:18] prophecy Julie surprise who made it and
[1:28:20] who did not make it ain't man let's make
[1:28:23] sure our colony election sure let's make
[1:28:26] sure that we're making it a man and that
[1:28:28] we are going before all the rest amen
[1:28:31] the Gentile bride is going before the
[1:28:33] rest a man we know the dead in Christ
[1:28:36] are going to arise first and then we're
[1:28:38] going to come up with anything to meet
[1:28:39] the Lord in the air a man just think the
[1:28:41] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:28:44] which are alive remain Amen but notice
[1:28:49] what's involved in the resurrection
[1:28:51] what's involved in the rapture amen and
[1:28:54] he said the Lord himself shall descend
[1:28:56] from heaven with a shout amen
[1:29:00] the lord has descended with a shout and
[1:29:03] he said the voice of the Archangel and
[1:29:05] with the Trump of God amen brother it
[1:29:10] was to get the attention of the bride he
[1:29:13] was to give the bride the faith that she
[1:29:14] needed and
[1:29:15] the revelation she needed to know what
[1:29:17] God was doing amen
[1:29:19] to know that they are the resurrection
[1:29:21] was upon us they are their answer is
[1:29:23] upon us amen
[1:29:25] old brother sister where are we are
[1:29:27] closer we to the resurrection how close
[1:29:29] are we to the rapture how close are we
[1:29:31] to the change amen are we caught up more
[1:29:34] with that that revelation than we are
[1:29:37] with the rest of the religion the rest
[1:29:39] of the message we got to be cut out with
[1:29:41] this it when I caught up with a
[1:29:43] revelation of the resurrection the
[1:29:44] rapture then we're not going to be
[1:29:46] caught up in the resurrection rapture
[1:29:48] hey man we got to come up with that
[1:29:51] revelation amen and the dead in Christ
[1:29:54] shall rise first and there then he said
[1:29:57] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:29:59] caught up together with them in the
[1:30:01] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:30:04] shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore
[1:30:07] he said comfort one another with these
[1:30:09] words
[1:30:10] covered one another with the revelation
[1:30:12] of the resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:30:15] and not just the comfort one another
[1:30:17] with this doctrine or that diverter
[1:30:19] there's one of that one no with the
[1:30:20] revelation of the resurrection of
[1:30:22] rapture amen God did what he did
[1:30:26] amen to bring forth the revelation of a
[1:30:30] resurrection God did what he did to give
[1:30:32] us a read the faith of the resurrection
[1:30:35] and the rapture amen
[1:30:36] nadiak along with with is like pentecost
[1:30:40] or was what they had and was and so on
[1:30:43] but what God has done for us in this
[1:30:45] hour this age Amen brother again that's
[1:30:49] why many walked away from the Prophet
[1:30:51] because he was moving from signs and
[1:30:53] wonders he was moving to the revealed
[1:30:55] word he was moving to the sign of the
[1:30:57] Resurrection moving to the sign of the
[1:30:59] rapture Amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:31:02] so god help us brother he's my prayer
[1:31:05] that has over Commerce overcoming the
[1:31:09] world the flesh the devil overcoming the

[1:49:31] changing as it was in the days of Noah
[1:49:34] so shall be in the days of the coming of
[1:49:37] the Son of Man and the power of God
[1:49:40] highlights it in this message the
[1:49:42] flashing red light of his coming he said
[1:49:47] what was it like in the days of Noah he
[1:49:50] said that's what it's like now maybe
[1:49:55] highlight that some time for you yeah
[1:49:58] the flashing red light of his coming
[1:49:59] June 1963 and he and he explains as it
[1:50:08] was in the days of Noah what they did
[1:50:11] now he said they're doing the same now
[1:50:14] yeah and all the respect but he
[1:50:20] highlights the influence of the women
[1:50:24] yeah he said that's what happened in the
[1:50:27] days of Noah
[1:50:28] he said the sons of God saw the
[1:50:31] daughters of man he said Cain's seed and
[1:50:37] he said they took unto themselves

[1:51:22] now we're living in that day now as it
[1:51:25] was in the days of no
[1:51:26] so it isn't this day and that's what he
[1:51:29] explains here in this book the flashing
[1:51:32] red light of is coming he said my it's
[1:51:37] over with it's finished now we see he
[1:51:40] said that that these signs are
[1:51:42] testifying of becoming a battle of the
[1:51:45] Lord and one of the big signs in the
[1:51:49] days of Noah again is common-law
[1:51:51] relationships amen and people are taking
[1:51:57] it so lightly oh yeah common-law
[1:52:01] relations did don't matter no more again
[1:52:04] I've took my stand on that even within
[1:52:08] my own family and so on no wait yeah and
[1:52:13] there's a time there a certain relative
[1:52:16] of mine and common law you're gonna get
[1:52:19] married married in a church I said I
[1:52:22] won't be there all due respect I said
[1:52:24] but we won't be there but he never held
[1:52:27] it against us
[1:52:28] no no so we didn't go though it was a
[1:52:33] close relative at the time he would have
[1:52:37] nothing to do with it amen
[1:52:42] so brother how many are gonna take their
[1:52:44] stand like the three will children
[1:52:46] how many gonna take their stand like
[1:52:48] Daniel take their stand like the others
[1:52:51] down through the ages say again what
[1:52:55] happened to Moses when God stopped
[1:52:58] dealing with Moses it's because he
[1:52:59] brought his father out of the land with
[1:53:01] him Todd told him to leave lead them all
[1:53:06] behind but he brought his father out and
[1:53:08] he says and he he was in the desert
[1:53:10] there outside the promised land and God
[1:53:13] never spoke to him for five years after
[1:53:16] five years his father died
[1:53:18] then the Lord came and spoke to Abraham
[1:53:20] again yeah sometimes you can do things
[1:53:25] brother and God won't talk to you God
[1:53:30] won't deal with you gotta move away from
[1:53:32] you
[1:53:33] oh yeah Lord why did why this why that
[1:53:37] why I'm waiting for you to separate
[1:53:41] under the Lord and yet as I told you
[1:53:45] before there's even even a message
[1:53:47] believer was telling me regarding
[1:53:49] common-law relationships always said
[1:53:51] that's there's nothing wrong with that
[1:53:52] he said that you're still husband and
[1:53:55] wife no no that grieves grieves God and
[1:54:03] God's water God say when when the sons
[1:54:06] of God did that he said my spirit will
[1:54:09] not always strive with man yeah
[1:54:15] poverty God brings it out he's a sea he
[1:54:18] said because they did it the Spirit of
[1:54:20] God ceased to strive and judgment came
[1:54:26] but Aaron there's too many believers
[1:54:29] brother justifying common-law
[1:54:31] relationships you know why they're more
[1:54:36] they're more caught up with this natural
[1:54:37] life than they are spiritual more cut
[1:54:40] out with themselves and the natural
[1:54:42] things than they are Christ and the
[1:54:44] spiritual amen you got to take your
[1:54:50] stand grace rather
[1:55:01] the princess and the governor saw these
[1:55:03] men upon whom the bodies of fire had no
[1:55:05] power and was an air of there is neither
[1:55:11] was there an air of their head sings
[1:55:13] neither was their coach change nor the
[1:55:16] smell of fire had passed on them hmm
[1:55:19] they were totally separated they were
[1:55:22] absolute overcomers absolute overcomers
[1:55:26] but it had that fire if I had absolutely
[1:55:30] no influence on brother
[1:55:32] just think of that they were so such
[1:55:37] overcomers no influence even like Daniel
[1:55:40] in the lion's den that the Lions would
[1:55:44] just moved away why they had no
[1:55:47] influence over Daniel Daniel had the
[1:55:49] influence over them okay Daniel was the
[1:55:52] overcomer and when they threatened
[1:55:55] Daniel and he because he was praying to
[1:55:57] God he opened the window
[1:56:01] any-any faced Jerusalem and he prayed
[1:56:03] treati
[1:56:04] three times a day and he prayed and he
[1:56:06] prayed and he prayed and and the
[1:56:08] officers from the king there oh they saw
[1:56:11] him and they wouldn't report to the king
[1:56:12] and he was told told to throw him into
[1:56:14] the fire into the lion's den but Daniel
[1:56:20] was an overcomer he was not change are
[1:56:24] we overcomers like Daniel and the three
[1:56:26] Hebrew children to the extent overcoming
[1:56:30] to the extent that we take our stand as
[1:56:32] they did faced the challenge that they
[1:56:36] face I tended not many believers taking
[1:56:40] this day they take their stand for a
[1:56:43] doctrine but not for the life of Christ
[1:56:47] no this doctrine this doctrine is doctor
[1:56:51] baptism Trinity so on but they want to
[1:56:55] inter stand for Christ in everyday
[1:57:00] living
[1:57:02] kada Alvis
[1:57:05] and it says then Nebuchadnezzar speakin
[1:57:08] say blessed be the god of Shadrach
[1:57:10] Meshach and Abednego who has sent His
[1:57:13] angels and delivered his servants that
[1:57:15] trusted in him and have changed the
[1:57:18] king's word and yielded their bodies
[1:57:20] that they might not serve nor worship
[1:57:23] any God except their own God amen
[1:57:28] therefore I make a decree that every
[1:57:31] people nation language which speak
[1:57:33] anything amiss against the god of
[1:57:36] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be
[1:57:38] cut in pieces and their houses shall be
[1:57:41] made a dunghill because there is no
[1:57:43] other god that can deliver after this
[1:57:46] sort no indeed and there's no other God
[1:57:49] that can deliver us with the
[1:57:50] resurrection in the rapture amen it's
[1:57:54] our Lord Jesus Christ let me read you
[1:57:57] one more scripture there in daniel 6
[1:58:05] daniel 6 and verse 16 then the king
[1:58:13] commanded and they brought Daniel and
[1:58:14] cast them into the den of lions now the
[1:58:18] King spake and said unto Daniel thy God
[1:58:21] whom thou service continually he will
[1:58:24] deliver thee and a stone was brought and
[1:58:27] laid upon the mouth of the den and the
[1:58:29] King seal it with his own signet and
[1:58:31] with the signet of his lords that the
[1:58:34] purpose might not be changed
[1:58:36] concerning Daniel then the King well
[1:58:41] probably refer to having friends of the
[1:58:43] right this one was a friend of Daniel's
[1:58:46] - as long as far as they could go as
[1:58:48] king and then the King went to his
[1:58:52] palace and passed the night fasting
[1:58:55] neither were instruments of music
[1:58:58] brought before him and his sleep went
[1:59:00] from him and then the King rose early in
[1:59:04] the morning and went in haste unto the
[1:59:06] den of lions and when he came to the day
[1:59:09] and he cried with a lamentable voice
[1:59:11] unto Daniel and the King spake and said
[1:59:14] to Daniel Daniel he's a servant of the
[1:59:17] living
[1:59:18] is my god him though service continually
[1:59:21] able to deliver thee from the Lions a
[1:59:23] man then said Daniel onto the King okay
[1:59:27] and live forever hey man is that to his
[1:59:31] right and his spirit was right keep your
[1:59:33] attitude right keep your spirit right
[1:59:35] everybody if you're an overcomer you'll
[1:59:38] always have a right attitude in the
[1:59:39] right spirit my god he said as cent is
[1:59:44] angel and as shut the Lions mouths a man
[1:59:50] as God sent his angel to you to shut the
[1:59:54] devil's mouth amen and he said that they
[2:00:01] have not heard me for as much as before
[2:00:04] him innocence he was found in me and
[2:00:07] also before thee O king have I done no
[2:00:10] hurt then was the King exceeding glad
[2:00:15] for him and commanded that they should
[2:00:17] take Daniel up out of the LA den so
[2:00:19] Daniel was taken up out of the den and
[2:00:22] no matter heard was found upon him
[2:00:24] because he believed in his God he was an
[2:00:29] overcomer
[2:00:30] he believed completely sincerely
[2:00:33] absolutely and the King took those that
[2:00:37] cast annua in the king went and got them
[2:00:40] and their families and cast in me god
[2:00:47] help us we need to plead the token life
[2:00:52] of the blood of Jesus for family and
[2:00:53] friends and neighbors yeah
[2:00:57] Daniel and the three would sure when
[2:01:00] we're under under the Covenant the Old
[2:01:01] Covenant of the law but they love God
[2:01:04] and they serve God and they were
[2:01:05] overcomers amen
[2:01:09] but after Daniel come out of the lion's
[2:01:12] den he may praise the Lord
[2:01:17] it wasn't like those that we saw on the
[2:01:20] film here the other night
[2:01:22] those two that went to Africa and called
[2:01:26] the lion that they raised oh yeah
[2:01:30] Daniel had no relationship with these
[2:01:32] lions but those two gentlemen there I
[2:01:35] think from America raised that lion but
[2:01:38] after a while to get back to Africa and
[2:01:39] of course they go every year and they go
[2:01:42] through the wilderness and call the name
[2:01:44] of the lion and the lion would come to
[2:01:45] them and we saw the lion jumping up on
[2:01:48] them and hugging them and maybe licking
[2:01:51] them yeah like a regular dog or a cat a
[2:01:54] man yeah cuz the the lion knew them a
[2:01:59] man they knew the lion oh brother what a
[2:02:04] relationship of course the lion is gone
[2:02:06] now so they assumed maybe he died or
[2:02:09] someone killed it because they can't
[2:02:10] they can't find it anymore hey man
[2:02:13] brother sister I pray that we have such
[2:02:15] a relationship with God amen that we are
[2:02:19] more than conquerors by the grace of God
[2:02:22] amen
[2:02:23] or there's so much more can be said
[2:02:25] concerning the lions remember the fourth
[2:02:30] beast in Revelation was like unto a lion
[2:02:35] amen
[2:02:37] by the grace of God so brother it says
[2:02:44] again verse 23 then was the King
[2:02:47] exceeding glad for him and commanded
[2:02:49] that they should take Daniel up out of
[2:02:51] the den so Daniel was taken up out of
[2:02:54] the den no matter no matter of hurt was
[2:02:57] found upon him because he believed in is
[2:03:01] God do we believe in our God and that
[2:03:05] brother the blessings that were
[2:03:06] experiencing that is not us it's God
[2:03:11] then if we never if we weren't
[2:03:14] overcomers and we had given ourselves to
[2:03:17] the Lord we would not experience these
[2:03:21] things grace of God that as he was with
[2:03:26] the three Hebrew children brought him
[2:03:28] out of the fiery furnace they weren't
[2:03:29] even burnt their clothes wasn't scorched
[2:03:31] nothing
[2:03:32] Daniel out of the Lions Den no problem
[2:03:35] grace
[2:03:39] and again a tremendous challenge to us
[2:03:41] through if you wanted to hear that tape
[2:03:43] sometime earlier that message the
[2:03:45] flashing red light of his right blight
[2:03:47] of the sign obvious coming June 23rd 63
[2:03:59] in the message how can I overcome was in
[2:04:03] the church that are the influence of the
[2:04:05] world and the things of the world yeah
[2:04:09] they were still under the influence of
[2:04:10] denominations and had denominational
[2:04:13] spirits as I said this is tremendous you
[2:04:16] think if they're under the ministry of
[2:04:18] the proper for so long that they would
[2:04:19] have believed the prophets day with the
[2:04:21] prophet and humbled themselves know that
[2:04:25] like I said when he preached church
[2:04:26] order after he preached search order a
[2:04:28] number of people left that church and
[2:04:32] they went and joined brother junior
[2:04:37] Jacksons church you know left Branham
[2:04:40] Tabernacle yes they left downtown
[2:04:42] Michael why because he had laid out the
[2:04:46] rules concerning the gifts he elated the
[2:04:49] rules concerning testimonies and so on
[2:04:52] yeah and they didn't agree with it just
[2:04:56] think you think if they believe them to
[2:04:58] be a prophet they would have stayed they
[2:05:02] would have sacrificed they would have
[2:05:04] they would have prayed not my will
[2:05:06] father time be done no and I don't doubt
[2:05:11] but after he preached this message
[2:05:12] others left Ram tabernacle
[2:05:17] you can accept the doctrine what about
[2:05:20] the life that's something else Nord you
[2:05:27] can teach me this and teach me that but
[2:05:30] you don't have control of my life
[2:05:32] no I want to do this I want to do that
[2:05:35] no you've got to lay down your life for
[2:05:39] him as he lay down his life for you the
[2:05:46] problem of God I think we concluded here
[2:05:49] on this in the previous service
[2:05:52] he said overcome he said means to
[2:05:59] recognize the devil at every one of his
[2:06:02] tricks amen
[2:06:05] don't let the devil trick you oh yes
[2:06:09] that's how he gets as though he gets to
[2:06:12] deceive believers he'll trick them into
[2:06:14] thinking what he's saying is all right
[2:06:17] and that God don't mind it so overcome
[2:06:22] means to recognize the devil and every
[2:06:24] one of his tricks and a lot of people
[2:06:27] says there is no devil it's just a
[2:06:29] thought don't you believe that he said
[2:06:31] there is a real devil and he's just as
[2:06:35] real as you are anybody a real devil and
[2:06:39] you must recognize him real you must
[2:06:42] know that he's a devil and overcome you
[2:06:46] must recognize that God the God in you
[2:06:49] is greater and mightier than the devil
[2:06:53] that the one that's in you has already
[2:06:55] overcome him and by His grace you're
[2:06:58] more than a match for the devil amen
[2:07:02] he said that these are there is real
[2:07:05] overcoming but he should remember
[2:07:08] greater is He that is in you than he
[2:07:11] that is in the world you must realize
[2:07:14] that the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[2:07:17] already overcome this thing and he is in
[2:07:20] you and you overcome your overcome by
[2:07:24] him amen
[2:07:26] Christ in us the hope of glory amen
[2:07:34] he said in a man that's in Christ knows
[2:07:37] that he's overcome the things of the
[2:07:38] world amen
[2:07:40] it has no more ties to you at all your
[2:07:43] free walk in the light as he is in the
[2:07:45] light and the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:07:47] cleanses us from all sin we have
[2:07:50] fellowship with one another forever
[2:07:52] there you are he that is in you greater
[2:07:55] Z than is it than he that is in the
[2:07:57] world and if you look back you're
[2:07:59] condemned look forward don't look back
[2:08:03] amen we got to look forward press on to
[2:08:07] the resurrection and rapture and he said
[2:08:11] I feel like a shouting Christian what
[2:08:15] was in there by God at the beginning it
[2:08:17] pressed its way through it overcome you
[2:08:21] know overcome the mud it overcome the
[2:08:23] waters and overcome everything and was
[2:08:25] over an overcomer and reflected the
[2:08:28] beauty and the glory of God amen that's
[2:08:33] the way every believer does that's the
[2:08:36] way that Noah did that's the way that
[2:08:38] lot did that look what a mess II was in
[2:08:41] that's the way Moses did that's the way
[2:08:43] Joshua did that's the way Daniel did
[2:08:46] that's the way Shadrach Meshach and
[2:08:48] Abednego did that's the way John the
[2:08:51] Baptist did Zacharias Elizabeth that's
[2:08:55] the way that Simon that's the way that
[2:08:58] Anna did every one of them they overcome
[2:09:00] the mud that was there was around them
[2:09:03] and packed into them and they stuck
[2:09:05] their head above the thing and shine
[2:09:07] forth the glory of God that's what a
[2:09:10] real Christian does you will reflect the
[2:09:13] glory of God he said look he showed us
[2:09:16] how it's done how did he do it by the
[2:09:19] word and that's how he done it was he
[2:09:22] was the word and Jesus said if you abide
[2:09:25] in me and my words abide in you you're
[2:09:29] back the word again the word of promise
[2:09:33] he said how do I overcome not me but the
[2:09:37] word that's in me the word is God and
[2:09:41] then I overcome the things of the world
[2:09:44] it's the word in me amen praise God he
[2:09:52] said in 40 days of temptation Satan made
[2:09:56] three major assaults upon Jesus in that
[2:09:59] temptation watch it's always in them
[2:10:04] trees but Jesus met those temptations
[2:10:08] with the word it is written a man but
[2:10:17] see how the devil gets the devil wants
[2:10:19] you to mine him and Satan also used what
[2:10:26] it's written and he say to Jesus he'll
[2:10:28] give the Angels Church to protect you
[2:10:33] but Jesus wasn't an attempt the father
[2:10:36] to do this or that just to please the
[2:10:39] devil no no no
[2:10:46] he said though he could have done it he
[2:10:49] never paid heed to Satan's propositions
[2:10:53] understand now we're dealing with two
[2:10:55] spirits Spirit of God spared the devil
[2:10:58] amen
[2:10:59] and as two probably won't be on your
[2:11:01] guard because the Prophet said they are
[2:11:03] twins in the same church it's amazing
[2:11:09] let's make sure you're following God's
[2:11:11] leadership not the devil Christ not the
[2:11:14] Antichrist yeah now here's a good thing
[2:11:20] see sometimes Satan can take you and
[2:11:22] when you think that you're doing the
[2:11:24] will of God and can make you a
[2:11:26] proposition and you'll fall for it yes
[2:11:29] sir
[2:11:30] he sure can now let's take for instance
[2:11:35] like our sisters and he said they're
[2:11:37] pretty and he can get you to a place
[2:11:39] that you let your hair grow out and you
[2:11:42] didn't realize it he said looks so nice
[2:11:44] on you and the first thing you know you
[2:11:46] get kind of feeling a little stuck up
[2:11:48] and a little above something else some
[2:11:51] of you main you know what I mean see you
[2:11:53] can take what that same thing and
[2:11:56] proposition it with you and so that's
[2:11:59] right you've got to overcome that just
[2:12:02] remember you're living for God and he
[2:12:05] said you had one objective and that's
[2:12:06] Jesus Christ outside of that there's
[2:12:09] nothing else counts except him he said
[2:12:13] there secondly for your family then
[2:12:15] thirdly for yourself but first God and
[2:12:18] Nick's for your family next for you
[2:12:21] you're number three that's the end of
[2:12:23] the road you put yourself last amen this
[2:12:29] is tremendous well the problem of God is
[2:12:32] instructing members of his own assembly
[2:12:34] what to do as overcomers and what
[2:12:38] they'll do if they are overcomers why
[2:12:43] because he was recognizing that many of
[2:12:45] them had not overcome self and the
[2:12:49] influence of the devil on cell
[2:12:57] he said though Jesus could have done
[2:12:59] this or that he never listened to
[2:13:01] Satan's proposition amen
[2:13:11] Satan was tempting Jesus to show off his
[2:13:15] power and he would be ashore and now the
[2:13:21] how does it hit God's servants to be
[2:13:24] show off to show what you can do
[2:13:26] no no servant of God is gonna be a shore
[2:13:30] he wants to give the glory to God he
[2:13:36] said no true servant of God ever does
[2:13:38] that you see a man show off his chest
[2:13:41] stuck out and all like that just
[2:13:43] remember there's something wrong there
[2:13:45] no servant of God is a show-off to
[2:13:47] himself and he said you remember when
[2:13:50] Moses did that and he said God give him
[2:13:53] power to do whatever he wanted to do and
[2:13:55] made him a prophet he walked down to
[2:13:57] that rock and he smote the rock the
[2:13:59] second time that was against God's will
[2:14:01] God said speak to the rock
[2:14:04] don't smite it again he said you'll
[2:14:07] break all the type ear so Moses went
[2:14:13] down and smote the rock he said come
[2:14:17] forth

[2:14:19] again and say come for they command you
[2:14:22] to come forth and the waters come and
[2:14:24] God said come up here he said you're
[2:14:27] glorified self you took my power instead
[2:14:30] of sanctifying me you sanctified
[2:14:32] yourself and not a preacher's take the
[2:14:36] glory to themselves oh yeah they're
[2:14:40] looking for that attention let's give
[2:14:41] him the attention now look for attention
[2:14:44] here for yourself give God the attention
[2:14:48] Amen I believe that they've this
[2:14:53] preacher get popular and this one is
[2:14:54] popular that one's popular that's the
[2:14:57] devil that's not God they're giving that
[2:15:01] they're taking the glory under
[2:15:02] themselves but not on to the Lord Amen
[2:15:05] if you're going to give the glory to God
[2:15:07] you're going to
[2:15:07] humble and anybody give you a good word
[2:15:12] oh that's alright there's just the grace
[2:15:14] of God in my life I've just served the
[2:15:17] Lord
[2:15:17] yeah you humble yourself to give him
[2:15:21] preeminence oh yeah Jesus said it's
[2:15:30] written
[2:15:30] don't tempt the LORD thy God amen are we
[2:15:39] willing this morning to take the route
[2:15:40] that Jesus took are we willing to die
[2:15:43] I'm willing to give up ourselves to God
[2:15:46] and forfeit all the world and the things
[2:15:48] for him to serve for him he should
[2:15:57] overcome the thing and how do you
[2:15:59] overcome he said by the word and what
[2:16:02] the word says you do it
[2:16:03] walk humble and live before Jesus
[2:16:08] brother I pray grace God give us Holy
[2:16:11] Ghost humility I led the finish
[2:16:25] again to me that the understanding that
[2:16:28] the Prophet is teaching his own people
[2:16:30] that they need to be overcomers
[2:16:32] and to be what God wants you to be you
[2:16:36] got to overcome self first so then it's
[2:16:40] not you that lives as Christ never
[2:16:41] didn't you
[2:16:42] you're not influenced by what's going on
[2:16:43] out there you're not influenced by other
[2:16:45] churches not influenced by other others
[2:16:48] other people no no you're controlled by
[2:16:50] the Lord and he said we're sometimes
[2:16:54] tempted to go back many of you just
[2:16:59] think he's talking to his own church
[2:17:01] tempted to go back to denominations he's
[2:17:07] attempted to go back to denominations go
[2:17:10] back and take up because all the world
[2:17:14] is saying what denomination you belong
[2:17:17] to what church are you affiliated with
[2:17:19] we're tempted to do that and all of us
[2:17:21] but our sisters are tempted to go back
[2:17:24] and join up some of the rest of the
[2:17:27] churches with the Assemblies or the
[2:17:29] Churches of God or some of them still be
[2:17:32] Pentecostal and let your hair cut off
[2:17:34] and dress just about any way you want to
[2:17:38] see you're tempted to do that go back
[2:17:42] and be popular with this wicked
[2:17:44] generation that we're living in yeah
[2:17:47] there's a lot of believers that are
[2:17:50] tempted and they're falling to the
[2:17:53] temptation just to be like the world
[2:17:54] again you know they want it it pleases
[2:17:59] them but doesn't please God
[2:18:03] yeah and he said let your hair cut off
[2:18:08] the dress just about any way you want to
[2:18:10] you're attempted to do that and go back
[2:18:12] and be popular with this wicked
[2:18:14] generation that we're living with see
[2:18:17] when this is the major sin of our day
[2:18:20] the major sin among our people is
[2:18:22] worldliness and I'm seeing a lot of more
[2:18:26] and more worldliness come among
[2:18:27] believers yeah they're not overcomers no
[2:18:34] no
[2:18:36] and he says the Bible said the loudest
[2:18:40] CNAs she's worldly rich need of nothing
[2:18:43] don't know that she's naked miserable
[2:18:45] Richard blind he said that's the sin of
[2:18:48] our day when you hear the word of God
[2:18:50] come out against it and call it against
[2:18:53] it then he said you take the other route
[2:18:55] he said you're unpopular with the world
[2:18:57] you are tempted to go back I know you
[2:19:00] keep saying to me he said I know you get
[2:19:05] tired of me harping on those things I
[2:19:09] get tired seeing you do it and he said
[2:19:13] this sin that I'm trying to tell you
[2:19:15] about say what are you harping on it for
[2:19:17] he said stop doing it then and he said
[2:19:21] trying to save your life by the word I
[2:19:25] get tired also so just straighten up
[2:19:29] this is a sin and you shouldn't be done
[2:19:33] yes sir if we are to overcome these
[2:19:36] things we expect to be tempted by them
[2:19:39] the world and if you love the world the
[2:19:42] things of the world the love of God is
[2:19:45] not in you a man so he said we'll just
[2:19:49] close in saying this there's a reward
[2:19:53] for the overcomer amen he was
[2:19:59] challenging his own people challenging
[2:20:01] believers a man he should look at
[2:20:04] yourself and see examine yourself in the
[2:20:07] spiritual looking-glass and see if you
[2:20:10] have overcome see if you've overcome
[2:20:13] yourself amen
[2:20:16] God's grace to us it's a challenge Lord
[2:20:19] to - to every every believer your
[2:20:22] including the ministry amen by the grace
[2:20:25] of Almighty God he said there's a reward
[2:20:28] for overcomers and he said press on he
[2:20:34] said like the lilies if it's in you lay
[2:20:37] aside the mud and everything else and
[2:20:39] pressed towards the top amen
[2:20:41] don't consider the mud around you press
[2:20:44] onto the top by the grace of God
[2:20:48] man and a man he said he overcome what
[2:20:56] the neighbors had to say he overcome
[2:20:57] what the church members
[2:20:59] Bildad and all them had to say he
[2:21:01] overcome the bishop and what he had to
[2:21:03] say he overcome the Cardinal and what he
[2:21:05] had to say
[2:21:06] he overcome the denomination and what
[2:21:08] they had to say and he stayed with the
[2:21:11] justification of the word a man yet it
[2:21:13] cost him everything he had even his
[2:21:15] children and he scraped the boils with a
[2:21:18] piece of crop setting on ashes yet job
[2:21:22] overcome and he did he overcome to the
[2:21:26] extent that God said told thee is he so
[2:21:30] called comforters he said make a
[2:21:32] sacrifice get job to offer it for you
[2:21:35] get job to pray amen praise the Lord I
[2:21:41] preached out that one time in some years
[2:21:44] ago now in improv I believe four
[2:21:48] approaches to the message yeah
[2:21:54] what are the four approaches to the
[2:21:56] message wells to three comforters that
[2:21:58] Jesus that came to Judas and one had
[2:22:01] this EEE bases his argument on this
[2:22:04] another one based it on that another one
[2:22:06] based it on that but then the other one
[2:22:11] came what was his name Eli Oh
[2:22:15] thank you sister Brenda did I she's
[2:22:18] fulfilling her calling
[2:22:21] amen that's where Eli you came and he
[2:22:25] did he didn't do it personally
[2:22:27] he punted Jesus to to God yeah he said
[2:22:31] always said Joe what have you done
[2:22:34] you've justified yourself he said what
[2:22:37] what about God a man and he was the
[2:22:41] mediator between Joel and God a man but
[2:22:45] joe by that faith I know my redeemer
[2:22:47] liveth and amen Oh God said where were
[2:22:53] you job when I laid the foundation of

[2:22:58] when the sons of God and the money stars
[2:23:00] is all Satan together we were there yeah
[2:23:04] and all and he got to the thought so
[2:23:08] humble that he he bowed himself down
[2:23:11] before the Lord and he wouldn't say
[2:23:12] anything
[2:23:13] why forgive me Lord forgive me he
[2:23:18] humbled himself

[2:23:43] the way along hide me in the grave keep
[2:23:46] me in the secret place he kept on
[2:23:49] pressing and he said I wish I know I
[2:23:52] wish I know where I could go to to a man
[2:23:55] that could put his hands on me a holy
[2:23:59] God and talk to him for me

[2:40:57] recently the things I've heard
[2:41:00] especially when yet when you listen to
[2:41:02] Paul a prisoner of Christ he had to give
[2:41:07] himself away he had to humble himself
[2:41:09] but a general talking about this morning
[2:41:10] but not on our side so I give myself
[2:41:14] away and think about what does it mean
[2:41:17] to give myself away to give yourself
[2:41:19] away
[2:41:21] it's a lot to it but God is there to
[2:41:24] help us through and we will buy great

[2:49:13] we're trying in ourselves depending on
[2:49:15] our own abilities and so forth we will
[2:49:18] do nothing but when we get to a place
[2:49:20] where we know we are nothing then God
[2:49:23] can use a give herself away
[2:49:26] let him have control amen
[2:49:29] I'm loving you more every day brother
[2:49:32] David you come a close in prayer and
[2:49:36] dismiss us with God's blessings and may
[2:49:39] just remember the services of course and
[2:49:42] the other needs mentioned and just
[2:49:44] remind you to pray for for Daniel today
[2:49:47] as he goes through the baptism and adam
[2:49:53] said that he was really under a lot of
[2:49:55] conviction and he was really resisting
[2:49:57] but once he made the decision to give
[2:49:59] his heart to God and saying a real peace
[2:50:03] came over him and he's been like that
[2:50:05] ever since and so I just thank the Lord
[2:50:09] and I believe it's gone and I really
[2:50:11] believe it's prayer answered by his
[2:50:15] parents by grandparents for sure and so
[2:50:20] we pray not only for Daniel but we pray
[2:50:22] for all of our loved ones
[2:50:23] amen
