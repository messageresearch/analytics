my way i yield to thee if there's anything he's looking for in your life is your will amen your way turned over to him not my will thine be done praise the lord so god bless us amen and we certainly welcome again our brother jonathan and brother joseph's family back from the trip that they took amen we missed him amen so we're thankful that the lord has brought him back amen and trust him with a blessing amen and also appreciate the fact of the the saints that our brother jonathan and his family visited amen while he was across the island and there's there is quite a few saints there uh and factors i'm not sure exactly maybe 17 or 18 out there that are supporting supporting the ministry and the assembly here so we pray the grace of god bless them amen and let us by grace keep them in prayer amen so the lord bless us and again we want to uh to eventually just turn everything over to our brother dooley amen we thank the lord for bringing our brother to newfoundland amen we thank the lord for giving our brother the opportunity to minister to the word to us amen and again we know again it's not not totally in this is control it's god in control praise the lord not exactly that the brother wants to do it but the problem of god said if you want to do it he said you're not called to do it amen because i i've maybe over the years met a lot of people felt oh they they were called they're called their call to the ministry and i said and they wanted to do it they wanted the attention they wanted the preeminence i said lord they're not called and that's the truth so again we pray the grace of god to be with our brother dooley amen as he comes to minister the word praise the lord and again not exactly oh well he he mentioned that maybe there's somebody else could minister oh yeah maybe there is but he didn't want to minister as it well maybe he's called to minister amen to us he was a blessing and he can and he will be a blessing and again again it's not it's not him it's the lord amen and against the same thing whether i trust by grace whether whether it's our brother jonathan or brother mark or whoever our brother's earl whoever's ministering amen that i trust that it's not them that is the holy ghost in them it is god in control amen turn yourself over to the lord amen just knowing this lord without you i can do nothing but with you all things are possible by the grace of god amen so be in prayer for our brother and a brother i just want to say again we appreciate your fellowship we appreciate your presence we appreciate the ministry that god's been giving through you and again he doesn't feel like he's called to minister as a as a preacher evangelist pastor or apostle a man but again even as a deacon sometimes god does bless deacons with with the ability to exhort amen or bless believers with the with the with the blessing and the anointing to exhort the brothers and sisters in the faith amen so we thank god for again for the anointing in our brother dooley amen brother take our blessings back to the saints by the grace of god we appreciate it so lord bless us let's stand and let's listen only believe all things are possible only believe amen and we'll turn it to our brother they just think again that only believe where it came from why it was written written for the prophet preceding the the ministry of the word amen so praise the lord to god be the glory so be in prayer for the minister of the word going forth through our brother and be in prayer for the receiving of the word in your soul amen that you're going to receive the word amen by the grace of god not just the letter of it in your head and the power of god he knew there there were many that were listening to the prophet but they only got it in their heads but they never got it in their souls amen so i trust the word will go beyond your mind down into your spirit and beyond your spirit into your soul by the grace of god amen don't don't let it because why because if if he is in control of your soul if you are truly born again and amen he is in the throne of your life he's controlling your life but he's not going to do it from your head he's not doing it from your spirit he's doing it from your soul amen by the grace of god because out of the soul comes the new nature of the born-again creature amen controlling your spirit and through the spirit controlling the the senses of our of our flesh amen hallelujah brother we're born naturally we go forth naturally reflecting mom and dad and grandpa and grandma and so on reflecting other relatives but if we're born again brother he comes in he takes control of that old nature amen so we're not going to reflect mom and dad if we're going to reflect jesus amen because he is our he is our father he is he is our mother amen so the grace of god that christ has got control of you your heart your soul your spirit amen give god the glory amen only believe all things are possible only billy amen oh [Music] all things are possible the resurrection [Music] praise the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus is here jesus [Music] jesus is he jesus is he [Music] [Applause] [Music] can we sing lord i believe lord i believe and make it the gospel personal to you tonight amen amen we want his holy spirit because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen we want his holy spirit to come by our way tonight i want to minister to me i want to minister to you to each one that's here amen because he's a very present help in time of need amen i don't want to i don't want to paddle my canoe by myself tonight i want him to to be here amen to expound to us what he would have us to hear tonight lord i believe [Music] all things [Music] lord i believe all things [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen let's just bow our heads and we'll just pray our grace is lord we are so thankful tonight lord amen that we can be set aside at this time lord lord to honor you lord to honor the resurrection lord to honor the resurrection lord of your holy spirit in our lives lord do you to say yea and amen lord for it's good for us to be here lord we thank you tonight lord each one that has come tonight lord that would have needs lord and we all do father we have our needs lord we have our times lord we don't know from a to z lord what exactly the answers would be lord but we know lord if we would lay ourselves aside for a moment or two lord that you would come by our way lord lord you would be the one that would make the quicker crooked way straight lord for our lives for our decisions oh god for our families lord lord for our church here lord jesus lord as everything would move forward lord and we see the day approaching oh god when the catching away of your little bride lord is just so much insight lord and we just waiting for that moment oh god when mortality will put on immortality lord and we shall be changed lord and we thank you father lord just speak to us tonight for a few moments oh god we ask lord lord just give us what we have need of tonight lord jesus feed us lord father we want to give you the honor and glory lord for your work of grace in our lives lord you that have called us out of darkness lord into your marvelous light lord we thank you tonight of all now we bless your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen we'll just read a verse of scripture two verses of scripture while we're standing romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god praise the lord amen you may be seated may the lord have his blessings amen god's power to transform we can say we can say amen because we've we've had that experience in our life amen where our lives have been transformed amen our minds have been changed they've been renewed amen we're thankful tonight amen god's power to transform is the message we're reading from first start here he said after the scripture was writ was read he says it's an old familiar text that many of your pastors has uh used down through your time it's been used since it was written but yet one thing about the word of god it never grows old it never grows old because it's god it never grows old though every generation through every generation now for pretty near about 2 800 years or better this word of god has been read by man priests and so forth and never does it grow old he says i've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time i read it i find something new amen because it's eternal brothers and sisters it's eternal god's word rain it says that i looked over the first time i find something new that i looked over the first time because it is inspired it is god in letter form see it's the attributes of god speaking forth speaking for and is placed on paper right many times man well a man wrote the bible the bible says itself that god wrote the bible it is the word of god and it can never fail jesus said heaven and earth will will fail pass away but my word shall never fail and it cannot fail and being god because it's part of him amen because there is no failure there is no failure there is no thought of failure there is no thought of change amen in god what god said in the beginning he will say in the end or in the middle wherever it may be his word never changes amen praise the lord see hallelujah and he says it can never fail it can never fail heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail and it cannot fail and being god because it's part of him and then you being a son and daughter you are part of it see and that makes you a part of him i mean a part of god amen and we read it there and we mentioned the scripture in john 1 and a couple sundays ago when i was here in the beginning was the word and the word was god the word was with god and the word was god and that word was made manifest to us amen so uh god was manifested to us excuse me and he says you being a son or daughter you are part of it so that makes you part of him amen so that's why we we why we come to fellowship together around the word of god amen it's not church entity it's not any of these things brothers and sisters it's the word of god that brings the fruit amen amen he said let this mind be in you that was in christ amen who thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the servant excuse me he says the word transformed something that has changed see made different that's what it was its character has been changed in it and we know that our characters our character has been changed amen we're not what we used to be right we don't think what we used to think we don't do what we used to do amen the desires that we used to have in our flesh we don't have those desires we're not in bondage to those desires anymore you may think of all the things that whenever went on in in in the world before we knew knew christ but there's no desire that desire is gone amen we have a new desire which is for the word of god see and he said this word transformed it says something that's changed it's to be changed transformed made different than what it was it's been its character and everything has been changed in it see to transform and i think this morning in genesis 1 he says the world was without form so we're talking about being transformed he said the world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the earth [Music] nothing but a complete chaos he says and when this world was in that condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water amen no different than what happened with you and i personally brothers and sisters we were in chaos whether we were in religion or in the bar don't much matter right it doesn't much matter right chaos but the spirit of god moved upon us the spirit of god came by our way one time right we realized right that we're not the son and or daughter of i'm not the son of jim dooley anymore i'm just i'm the son of god now amen praise the lord see spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of eden condition talking about the world he says that is transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it god's transforming power amen god's transforming power brothers and sisters we have to give merit to god's transforming power in our lives god wants to be worshipped amen god wants to be worshiped there's no better way to worship god than to honor his word you have your own you have your own time in your own prayer clauses where you or you make contact with your your savior amen but the word of god the word of god is is uh is just so important to us you know we we have to have that word of god in our lives that is transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it amen he can take a was not and and make it a make it something he can take your life and he can take my life and he can change us in the inner man amen and that seed when it comes alive in us that seed that was there before the foundation of the world was ever laid amen that seed was gone was there and god watered that seed and that seed which has everything in it amen whether it's an oak tree or a spruce tree or whatever kind of a tree whether it's a human being what the god seed is in it god's seed is in it and that life that's in that seed will bring forth that majestic design that god so desired to have in that tree or that person see and we understand by the reading of scripture he says he says that god was 6 000 years in making this preparation for this eden now he might not have been that long but just presuming and taking it from the scriptures where it said one day with god is a thousand years on earth that it is god if god should count time and say it was 6 000 years he had it he had been making the earth and he had planted upon the earth all good seed see there was just everything was perfect he says but if we would just notice for a moment before we get into our text here that moses saw the vision see and god spoke to him god spoke to moses face to face lift to ear now he never spoke to any other man like that as he did moses see moses was was a great one of the greatest of all the prophets he was the type of a type of christ and now god can speak he says god can speak he spoke to moses and i i know and i was reading back in genesis you know where that account of moses when he was walking along the trail there and and and he saw the burning bush right moses saw the burning bush and he and he looked at it god was in the burning bush and his servant was here looking at the burning bush and moses the bible tells us in genesis pardon me i think exodus three uh that moses turned aside to see that phenomena of the burning bush that wasn't consumed see and it was then that god spoke to moses and told him don't come any closer you know take your shoes off your feet for the ground you're standing on this holy ground right and i think you know the jews if you if you read the book of acts the jews in berea they said the bible says that they were more noble than the jews of thessalonica and now when they heard this revealed word for their day they took and studied the scrolls they studied everything to see what's this word all about amen just like brother mark he come into contact with a newspaper i believe back in 1979 was there someplace back there sometime back there you know and something attracted his attention to that right something attracted his attention something there was something burning he had to get to the bottom of it see and the bottom of it was the revealed word of god for this hour right and look at the fruits of that you know when you turn aside or when i turn aside and we and we and we look to see what god is doing in our day brothers and sisters what he has revealed to us the price that he paid for yours and my salvation the price that he paid that you and i today can stand here and sit here and we can enjoy the wonderful word of god that's been given to us through the mouth of his vindicated prophet in our day praise god he said see god can speak he has a voice he says it's been heard god can speak and god can write god wrote the ten commandments with his own finger he wrote it on the walls of babylon once many many tackle you you herpson i believe this says the art weighed into balance and found wanting to nebuchadnezzar you know god wants to get our attention brothers and sisters there's nothing out of his reach if he wants to get our attention or if he wants to get somebody's attention what he'll do amen he said there is no other he said he wrote it on the walls of babylon once with his finger he he stooped down and wrote in the sand one time with his finger god can speak god can read and god can write he says god is the fountain of all grace and power and of all excuse me and of all divine wisdom is in god so therefore knowing that he is the only creator there is pardon me there is no other creator but god satan cannot create see he only perverts what's been created but god god is the only creator amen hallelujah amen amen he created you he created me amen when uh when the earth when the earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the earth you know all the seeds that were ever went into the ground that was ever going to be manifested to the glory of god god knew all those seeds god planted all those seeds by his spoken word every last one see we find that there is pardon me therefore he created by his word he sent his word so all the seeds that he had placed upon the earth he formed those seeds by his own word for there was no nothing else for to to make the seed out of see he had placed them and they were beneath the water water he just said let there be this and let there be that now we find many times it looks like that bible repeating itself or something and so on he says in genesis we find that god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and then he goes on and many things happened upon the earth and he says then we come to find out that there was no man to till the soil no man to till the soil then god created man out of the dust of the earth that was a different man he says and he breathes the spirit of life into him and he became a living soul he said the first man was in the image of god which is spirit john 4 says god is a spirit and dead and worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth but god is a spirit and the first man that he created was spirit man see and he was in the image and in the likeness of god and then he put this man in flesh and man fell so then god came down and became in the image of man that he might redeem that fallen man god came down see he says that's the real gospel story to my in my opinion to my opinion you know and all that all the time when god the seven days that god was making everything to his liking all that going on and on on the seventh day he was all done and then god's rested and it was good in his sight right it was good in his sight you know and before sin ever came into the world brothers and sisters he had adam there he had adam's beautiful little wife there in the garden and every day god came by in the cool of the evening and they had fellowship and they had perfect fellowship because there was no sin in the garden at the time there was no sin just think of it i don't know how many years that condition went on for maybe nobody knows that i don't know but you know for however many years god had that perfect event happening every day where he came down in the cool of the evening and he fellowship with adam and eve and he fellowship with all his creation amen amen what got lost a lot got lost death death came after sin came in the garden amen now god in 6 000 years had planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word it shall be this way this tree shall be this this shall be everything was perfect it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they would be they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that was the word of god had spoken in them should be see it was an if it was an oak tree or or to bring forth of an oak it was a palm tree was to bring forth a palm he says because the great creator had just sent forth his word he had sent forth his word see and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed the word seed was there before the real the before the real seed was ever formed and the word formed the seed see he made the world out of things that does not appear see he made the world by his word god spoke everything into existence amen and being god the creator speaking all things into existence it must have been a perfect world not like we have today right but this is only a season this world is only a season brothers and sisters soon soon there won't be any old people hey we have that to look forward to praise the lord the shortest time of misery in our life and the only time of misery in our life is this walk that we have right now it won't be any more misery after mortality puts on immortality amen we should rejoice i can't help but rejoice because god changed me you know i've been changed in my atoms right something happened back there 45 years ago praise the lord and it's still holding on or he's still holding on to me however we want to see it amen it was a beautiful place it was a real genuine paradise here on the earth now as every place has to have a headquarters somewhere and he says this convention he's preaching to the full gospel men here in phoenix and this chapter has a headquarters and and a church has a headquarters and god has a headquarters and so in this great place this great nation of america that we live in it's got a headquarters and so this great eden has had a headquarters and its headquarters was headed up in the garden of eden or in eden east of in the garden and god placed over this to rule of his great creation here on earth his son and his son's wife our son's bride adam and eve god was the father of adam adam was the son of god according to the scriptures he was the son of god amen and you and i according to the scriptures if we read you who were sometimes darkness we were sometimes darkness we were sometimes in chaos we were sometimes void of understanding we were void of anything that was good but god one day you know we we wonder how can god save us sinner we we think the wrong way sometimes god came to save sinners right greet saul in the book of acts you know high up on his horror high horse down the road charge saul right the pharisee of the pharisees the most zealous of them all but a fall in the dust and the pillar of fire made him humble as can be we can warn out god turned them about and set him in christ to stay hallelujah amen that's what he did to us amen that's right amen praise the lord that's what he did to us and you're not here for a moment you're not here for a while you're here for eternity eternity soon eternity will unfold amen the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet him in the air amen hallelujah god made him a helpmate out of his own body perhaps a rib over his heart he says so she would be close to him and made him a helpmate he says it really wasn't his wife as yet no more than it was man as yet he had just spoke it and there is where the trouble comes see satan found her before adam did so it was just his word he had spoken he said i don't want to spend too much time on it but some of you might get confused especially some of the people out of the south seem to find such a little confusing out of the message that i have from god today to the people of that about uh serpent seat see and i'm going to go home the lord willing one of these days to jeffersonville i want to want to better make about a six-hour message and straighten that all out i don't think he ever got around to doing that but it's all there it's all in the church ages it's all in the seals it's all been revealed it just wasn't put into a one sermon you know brother branham in december 1965 which is when he went off the scene he's still out there on the field with the full gospel businessmen go into all the world and preach the gospel jesus went wherever he was invited even into simon's house think about it that prophet of god sitting in the back room and preachers out at the pulpit saying brother branham can come tonight and there he is right there he was a humble man he went he went through the fiery furnace like everyone else has to go test and tried god's people will always be tested and tried we don't ever have to worry about that it's going to happen amen see thank you he says if somebody would come to to me something contrary with something contrary i would kind of misunderstand it maybe myself i wouldn't want to criticize what anyone else says see we're not to criticize each other i'm not guilty of doing that he says i thank the lord i have criticized sin and unbelief but no individual person see i don't it says we are brothers and sisters striving we are coming down to where sister florence came yesterday morning say she passed away we all got to come that way and it's not it's not my purpose to to try to criticize a brother or sister that wouldn't agree with you see no it's be far from me to do that he says i don't think you'll ever find a tape that i ever called anybody's name on which i have felt that many times the person may be wrong but that's between them and god but what is wrong is the way of sin and misunderstanding sometimes is not even sin it's just a misunderstanding of people sometimes it's not sin it's just a misunderstanding of people and i think each of us has a right to express ourselves to our understanding now this great creator had placed his created son [Music] now adam was his first created son jesus was his only begotten son see he was begotten by a woman but adam was right straight from the hand of god in the creation now the headquarters with his son and his son's bride overall it looks so perfect there was a man ahead of it all his own son and his bride and every seed s-e-e-d was perfect the palms the oaks the grass the birds the animals and everything was in perfect order with the commandment of god don't change your nature he says bring forth of its kind see it doesn't change in nature bring forth of his kind every seed see oak don't you never be perverted into a pawpaw tree see palm don't you ever be perverted into something else but every seed after his kind right and that's what god doesn't want us to do he's made us his sons and daughters right and he's brought his word to us through the scriptures through the revealing of the son of man the son of man in our day he's brought that all forward that we can walk in the light as he is in the light amen because he is the light of the world and the light of the world my brothers and sisters is the message of the hour for us right it may not be somebody else's but it's ours we were called for this yes we were called to fulfill this role and he said he had spoken his word his great creating power had formed those things that came up and even the man and the woman and they were head because they were super to all the other races and he put them also under a care of the same thing that he put trees animals and so forth his word his word everything was under his word see that must never never by no means break that word they must never must never never break that word they must stay there don't never take anything from it or add anything to it see you must live by that word by this word and as long as this creation would have existed like that he says as long as this creation in the perfect eden in the perfect garden is as long as it would have existed like that sister chakarian would have wouldn't have had to have went this morning as long as it would have stayed that way god's great economy is what we believe that we're headed back to see we're going back to that spot we're going back to that spot that place he says where he says that seventh morning when god looked upon it all and he said it's good i am pleased with it yes i am glad i did it and it's all now under control and i have put trust in my son and his wife that they will and make them head of it all of it all that they will watch over it all that it's all right that everything will bring forth of its kind now he has the power to do that god then said well if it's all good and it can't be anything else because it's my own desire hallelujah praise the lord it's my own desire it's the way i want it and i have spoken that way and my words has brought it just exactly the way i wanted it and there it is it's all good so the bible said god rested the seventh day from all of his work set back i wrote down sat back and admired what the word what his word had produced amen you know it's not it wouldn't be proud or it wouldn't be boastful it wouldn't be those things if you would take a look at yourself in the mirror i mean there's lots of reasons for looking in the mirror sometimes we don't want to look in the mirror but if we can look into the mirror of god's word amen and see and realize and appreciate what god has done in our lives brothers and sisters the world that we live in if you were to compare that to the world that we live in i went and visited my family they live in a totally different world than a world i live in amen although we're on the same earth but we're in a different world totally different he says and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring to bring when he put the seed in the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it see to transform it from a seed to a plant it's amazing you know that little small seed and you plant it and then you next summer and you see a little small tree this big coming out here and then five years later if you're in bc well it's probably the height of the pulpit you know depending on what you know vegetation is there for it and what minerals are in the ground but they grow and and everything that was in that seed everything that was in that seed the life that was in that seed is that great big oak tree from that one little seed wow right we are the word made flesh today this is what the scripture says our names are seen redeemed i don't know the whole song i'd need music to sing that redeemed and perfect without sin yes we are anointed and inspired the original seed the original word is what i believe the original life the original life amen not the new life the original life that produced a new life the original seed that produced a new life how's that he said everything under control to bring forth of its kind i read some of that already he says when he put the seed in the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power his transforming power now god put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be as long as it stayed in its right category see it would be just exactly what god said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his channel see in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do cannot move from there see it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then god said it's all good amen amen it's all good amen amen we tell our wives we have a your wife serve you that perfect meal oh it's so good honey it's so good i got to go back and get seconds and sometimes i got to go back and get thirds right and that's all right she feels good when i go get thirds and i feel good and then i go take a nap after thirds praise god he said it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then god said it's all good so i'll just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that i desire it to be see that's what it must be because i have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make it of itself exactly what i want it to be amen some are deacons some are preachers some are pastors some are prophets some are congregation some are helpers but all god's seed with different gifts god has never changed just the same today as he was then god is determined to do something he'll do it nothing is going to stop him he'll do it amen god has never changed i just read that now after all it after it's all so well and set in order god feel sure that this would be all right and then when he did then came the enemy god gave power to transform and i'm going and he says i'm going to call this fellow with power uh he had power to deform not transform but to deform now anything's deformed is taken away from its original state there is something that's gone wrong with it the way of the world today because of that see and we're still in the image of god but some are so deformed as sons of god that walk contrary to his word and and in the way that he had us and provided for us to walk see setting something the world twists us out of the way pulls us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted us in to be sons and daughters of god sin has done this evil thing to the sons and daughters of god amen amen so he said the deformer i know this seems to be rather strange to speak it this way to deform but that's what he was he deformed or perverted perverted means to be changed over and made something different and deform is the same thing that that has been brought over and deformed and made in another way yet it's still the same seed but it's deformed see back there a page or so back he was talking about the corn that grew up amongst the twisters and so on and how it got deformed see but it was still corn but it was deformed corn amen and we're not we're not deformed we're we're the the [Music] the seed that's planted on the good ground brought bring forth much fruit amen in its season that's what we want to be and he goes on here and i'm skipping some pages here some some paragraphs he says now it's hard to say this it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way i do and the way i have been for so many years but since the opening of those seven seals of them angels just behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book it's the things that's been hid is being revealed as god promised in revelation 10. see he would do it and we are the privileged people that god has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things amen might see and understand these things where would we be i mean we would be so confused we'd be like that bouncing ball in the bingo thing you know what i mean where all those balls are bouncing up and down right unless god did something for us bring bring the word back to the faith of the apostles what they had back then unless god restored us back brothers and sisters we were toast amen praise jesus we are the privileged people that god has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of god made manifest proving that is right proven not by science but by god that is right god as i have said before in the message god doesn't need anyone to interpret his word he is his own interpreter he says says it'll happen and it'll happen he confirms it that interprets it praise god i'm just going to stop there god bless you we can sing a little choruses there we'll walk in the light i like that little chorus the beautiful light come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright amen do drops of mercy shine all around us [Music] by day and by night jesus the light of the world that's what we walk in today we walk in the light because of god's transforming power in our lives never underestimate that my brother sister never underestimate the power that god has to transform our lives or transform our condition or transform every need that we have in our life god by his infinite grace and mercy is here to meet each and every need that we would have and we would desire god to come on the scene tonight you know to meet your needs whether you got a physical need you got a spiritual need you got a financial need whatever your need is you need direction you need some kind of support whatever it may be god amen amen god is here to meet each need [Music] let's sing that little chorus center [Music] jesus the light of the world we'll walk in the light we'll walk in [Applause] the beauty [Music] [Applause] [Applause] shine all around [Music] amen can we sing there is the land of milk and honey there is the land where we don't need money you know that one you're involved there is a land of milk and honey there is a land where we won't need money there is a land shining with jasper there we shall see our blessed savior and that's the reason why we shout hallelujah praising our king across the river that shining river we're the saints will gather there we shall see our blessed redeemed [Music] sorry about that those words are all mixed up amen okay elijah has come i like that one elijah has come he has done his work already am i singing that wrong as john has said his bride has made ready and now we are waiting for the coming of jesus for that blessed day when the lamb shall take us and that's the reason why we shout hallelujah praising our king across the river that shining river where the saints will gather there we shall see our blessed messiah our hopes are bright our lamps all burning and day by day our hearts are yearning this is the evening he will come in the morning then we shall wait until the dawning and that's the reason why we shout hallelujah praising our king across the river that shining river where the saints will gather there we shall see our blessed messiah [Music] amen little girl god bless you i head back over to ontario tomorrow to see one more brother i have there and then head home around the third or fourth of september so it's been a real uh privilege to be with you folks and and to uh i just wanted to come and sit there and do that part but you've got schemers here they scheme me in here anyways i i certainly enjoyed it and i don't feel i don't i don't feel worthy to be able to stand here brother gerald at all uh there's a good minister there's one sitting right back there one right here and not sure who else ministers here but you know god bless you and uh it's been a real it's been a real joy to be with you amen hallelujah yes amen praise the lord amen so brother jonathan brother mark for the journal my brother jim amen but after after the day he brother jim won't be here amen so we just wait on the lord to see who else he will sin amen to minister to us of force and of course again it's not not too long in the future we'll have to have again our brother jonathan and maybe our brother mark and for the journal to minister amen but we thank the lord for the word brother i tell you that this again to many this is just a bible but to the bride it's the word hallelujah well they think well yeah god ordained them to write this god ordained to write that and so on to a lot of them it's just history it's a history book but for us it's not it is the revelation of god his his plan his purpose and his pattern oh my this is why that we're here tonight and and and well the believers are getting fewer and fewer and fewer and that's why that that jesus said when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth why because the faith comes by the by the word but to them it's just a a bible and the bible is just a history book well that's that's the truth they think it's a history of what god did in genesis and on down you know the old testament and the new testament it's just god did this god did that and god said this and god said that but they they they they failed to recognize and realize wow it's the god that did it there it's the same god that's that's that's revealing it here amen praise the lord oh brother just think that this that we come from eternity and it goes back to eternity praise the lord our brother was bringing it out to but we were with god in the beginning amen we come from god in the beginning we come from eternity and brother by the grace of god by the word of god we're going back to eternity hallelujah and many just don't recognize it or they recognize oh well you know jesus did this and we're saved so we just we believe what the bible said well but again it's just the bible it's just a religious book but not the word of god and brother again oh well i got faith my brother without this you can't have faith no faith comes by hearing hearing by the word amen and without that faith it's impossible to please him oh brother it's got to be according to the the will of god and the purpose of god amen again as i said that god challenged cain and and because why cain he had faith because look look at the sacrifice here he offered oh my maybe it may be a greater sacrifice than most of us would you know when it comes to what cain offered oh my he had a large sacrifice and not only that it looked nice but but abel as i said abel oh hey what did he have he had a sacrifice and what it was his heartbeat it was it was a dead lamb you killed the lamb abel what'd you do that for you know just and again as i said about uh solomon i preached it here a number of years ago and and i remember that all of the corettes were there and i know that brother lanny was there uh our brother jonathan's father and and he had two or three visitors with him and i was preaching and i was talking about solomon and now he rebuilt the temple and he redid this redid that and i and he and he had this many thousand lambs this many thousand sacrifices and this many for this and for that and i said well when i read it i said thank the lord i said that there was what was that group greenpeace i said thank the lord i said greenpeace wasn't there i said because i said solomon wouldn't wouldn't be able to do what he did i said they would they wouldn't want solomon to kill all those thousands of lambs all those thousands of sheep and all this and all that not by any means because they're the greenpeace with even we're doing what they're out there trying to trying to stop the fishery don't do this don't do that and and the seals and all of that oh brother what would they do if they were back here of the old testament whether they they would be legalists but certainly they wouldn't they would go with the word amen and and that struck the her brother lanny and the two or three visitors that he had with him and and they they never heard that before when it comes to the word amen oh yeah but i don't think they'll ever forget it and again it's like i said too i preached it years ago and i and i talked about i said cain's church versus the abel's church and i said which church would you go to i said most would go to cain's church i said because that's what they do i said on thanksgiving day you know i said oh they'll lay everything on the altar lay this on the altar thank god for this thank god for that but brother what about god's altar not yours but god's amen and brother as abel the bloody lamb right cain didn't like it but again brother i tell you this god came down and laid down his life and shed his blood amen we've got to preach the same thing by the grace of god amen because it is by grace through faith we're saved grace grace on merited favor as i said it struck me a little while ago i was thinking about grace grace grace all mine yes i said lord i'm merited favor brother and brother yes look into the mirror of the word and you see you you were you were you were not me you were unmerited amen oh yes definitely you were born in sin you were born with this nature you're born of that nature you wanted this you want that you're living for this living for that oh i said lord oh when i considered it all i said lord yes lord i said thank you i said that you anointed that brother to write that hymn amazing grace and lord not just grace but it's amazing when i consider what you did to save me it is amazing amen when we consider what god has done and what god's doing brother for all these years father is still working with us still still ministering to us his word to give us the faith that you and i need see it is the gift of god why because i need it you need it brother i pray grace that we recognize it and we receive it amen why the faith and it is my grace amen too many think well i got faith i got faith what about grace humble yes brother it almost us our brother bring it out again concerning humility and and we're humbled brother when you consider where we come from what happened and what god did to come back bring us back it's humility oh yeah he did it because we were his sons and his daughters but yet consider who we are what we are and our nature yeah well he did he did it in such a way so as to get us back to his nature so brother let it keep us humble by the grace of god as long as we're in this flesh it ought to humble us praise the lord thank god for the word amen thank god for the ministry of the word through our brother to tonight amen oh after all those years we still need the ministry of the word oh yeah why why because brother it says from the beginning right on down to now it says god has used the same thing to give us the faith that pleases him so i trust by grace that it was giving us faith tonight more and more faith increasing our faith and strengthening our faith by the grace of god hallelujah so that brother through the hearing of the word as we heard tonight it encourages us to keep pressing on lord we're going to keep moving thank you jesus for encouraging us thank you lord for revealing these things highlighting this highlighting that amen by the grace of god amen and we're moving on to that till we get to that faith that perfect perfect perfect faith that's going to take us out of time and into eternity it's going to change us from creatures of time to creatures of eternity amen that's true that faith gave gave it was faith that gave abel the revelation what god required of him amen sure but cain never read that faith it was by faith that abel offered the more excellent sacrifice amen but cain his sacrifice was excellent oh yeah it's excellent it was a sacrifice and sometimes we can make sacrifices excellent but it's not more excellent amen brother see we we can lay like cane we could fill the altar oh cain all this is you've done good that's wonderful look what you're sacrificing and then abel abel you killed the lamb huh you killed a lamb and now that you're the blood is all over the place and the brothers all over you yeah well abel had a greater revelation a greater faith than cain amen because it in the eyes of god abel sacrifice was more excellent i trust by grace that our sacrifice amen is more excellent by the grace of god amen brother of reflecting our faith we i pray that we'll go forth tonight reflect the faith that god gave us through the word amen oh yes and increase our hunger and our thirst more and more for the will of god amen lord we want to stay with you stay with the word amen stay with the body of christ stay with the bride of christ amen we want to lay our lives down as you did we'll lay our lives out for you as you laid it down oh yes thank you brother for the scripture romans 12 amen amen for the romans oh i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god oh yeah that you present your bodies a living sacrifice praise the lord wonderful he laid down his life for you now you lay down your life for him and you're laying on your life for one another by the grace of god amen holy amen present your bodies a living living sacrifice wonderful holy acceptable unto god which is mine reasonable which is your reasonable service amazing reasonable lord just it's too much oh you require too much i don't think you should require this lord well this is your reason considering what he did amen and again why did he do it because he loved you well this is wonderful that that has struck me and never never will leave me lord you did what you did because you loved us and why did you love us because we were your sons and daughters amen and you did this to get us back praise the lord god help us that we'll amen present your body a living sacrifice for god for the word for the resurrection for the rapture amen for the body of christ for one another amen and for as he laid down his life for us we lay down our lives for him by grace god bless thank god for the word amen and god bless our brother jim brother thank god wonderful as i said i now i remember it struck me that are not that's that our brother was there two or three years ago whenever a visiting family but it goes back to me many years ago when we were in the palliative care at the sinclair's hospital and sister betty's father my father-in-law mr dunford was passing away and i and our brother jim cave i remember i can remember that we stood around the bed and i asked our brother to pray for him and i remember that now so many years ago it struck me when he was here that now not the last time he was here but but when he was here during this this trip oh i was thinking about his visits his visits then i went back and oh and i can see him now standing by the bed laying his hands on mr dumford and praying for him yeah so thank the lord amen so i pray god that mr doctor is god has rest in his soul amen hallelujah so god bless our brother julie and god give him a safe trip back home and take our greetings to the saints brother amen thank god for the word let's stand and we're going to sing amazing grace amen and turn to our brother bob and again be in prayer and we'll see who's going to minister on sunday either me or brother jonathan not sure or brother mark we'll see as the lord leads god bless you amen also amazing grace we know that only believe was written for the prophet for his ministry for the word and when it comes to amazing grace it's one of the prophets favorite hymns and he said when you get to heaven and he said you're you'll hit you're going to hear either going to hear somebody he said you'll hear somebody singing amazing grace and if you look down he said you'll see me see william branham who said he said sitting under a tree and he said singing amazing grace amen so brother even the prophet with the ministry that he had wouldn't deny grace he acknowledged his need of grace amen so brother if a prophet of god with the ministry that he had brother he needed grace we need grace amen let's give the glory to god and sing of this absolute it is amazing when you consider who you are what you are and and the nature and you know all that you're doing
