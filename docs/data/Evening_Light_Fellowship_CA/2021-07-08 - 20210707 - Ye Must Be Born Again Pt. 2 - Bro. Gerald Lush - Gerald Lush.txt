experience amen that your redeemer is faithful and true amen he's proven he's proven himself to us amen so we just now he's looking for that and you and me amen again this is why why did god do this why did god allow that well right from the beginning brother god allowed it he knew it was going to happen it's for years and years and years professing believers those that believe oh they believed the bible they believed god so on and they just they just felt you know what happened in genesis was accidental oh no it wasn't accidental or just because god did this for the devil come well god knew he was going to come god knew the devil was going to be there god knew what the devil was going to do when god in the beginning created the heaven and the earth when god in the beginning created adam and eve he knew what satan was going to do when he created the serpent he knew the part he was going to play yes why god and god allowed it because god wanted to show his love amen to the seed that's right the product of god said this is what god wanted to do this is why he permitted it and allowed a man to get down amen on as it were on his way to hell but jesus came down to redeem us he did this god did this god did that it was a reflection of the love of god amen to bring us to a man to bring us to a new birth a spiritual birth born again by the grace of god so that we would love him for himself amen god's revealing himself revealing his nature be revealing his character oh oh this is god god did this god did that yes but what what why did he do it it was love amen it was and and again what he did that what for to bring out the love in his sons and daughters so that you would love him for himself now i'm gonna i'm gonna do that i'm gonna love god because look what he did look what he did no you love him for himself because why you come to know god you know his nature you know his character oh oh praise the lord god is love amen and and brother if god is love and god's in you and me your love amen you got the nature of love the character of love by the grace of god real genuine holy ghost love amen so the lord bless you let's stand and sing only believe as we go to the

number of things that i want to share with you tonight and and the lord willing if i can conclude uh with the message that the problem of god preached uh in 1961 uh and it was a new it was a new year's message and uh he preached it december the 31st 1961. ye must be born again amen and brother for salvation you must be born again for the resurrection and rapture you must be born again amen so make your calling election sure make amen make sure that you are born again make sure that you are indeed a new creature in christ praise the lord amen and in john chapter 14 and beginning to read at verse 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me amen in my father's house are many mansions or theophanies and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you he's not gone to create it he's going to prepare it and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again amen and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also praise the lord and whether i go ye know and the way ye know thomas saith unto him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me amen such a relationship that we have with jesus hallelujah pray grace that we know jesus amen and if we know him trusting by grace he knows us amen so again verse 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way and i am the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me and if ye had known me ye should have known my father also amen and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him and philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me philip praise the lord brother if you know jesus you know god if you know jesus you know the father and the son and the holy ghost amen and again verse 9 jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet as thou not known me philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou show us the father believers thou not that i am in the father and the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works i trust with christ in us that we have the same testimony amen that we do not speak of ourselves but of christ amen amen and that dwelleth in us e do doeth the works it is christ living the life amen we cannot live the christian life without christ in us the grace of god to help us having a right spirit having a right attitude right motives right objectives is christ in me can you really truly say from your heart father it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me amen brother is christ reflected in your thoughts your words your deeds is christ reflected in your attitude and your motives and your objectives oh brother what a tremendous testimony amen for the believer who really confess that they are born again amen if you're born again who are you born by what well the nature you're going to reflect approves your birth are you living by your natural birth or your new your new birth oh brother god have predestinated god for ordained that new birth what for to bring us in contact with his nature amen amen to create in us the hunger and the thirst we really need to get back to him amen not the hunger and the thirst just just to satisfy natural parents no no it's a hunger and thirst to satisfy our spiritual parent amen god hallelujah and again verse 11 believe me that i am in the father the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the word is tremendous the works that i do shall he do also amen oh brother they're believers oh my they're just so-called christians and they're saying oh i'm a christian i'm this i'm a believer but again it's like the prophet of god said he said you're in the message but the message is not in you and just think he was challenging his own church with that statement yeah random tabernacle he said you're in the message but the message is not in you amen brother he could prove that with and he did prove it when he preached church order amen when when a lot of the people in bradham tabernacle they got up and they left amen went to another church brother did they believe him to be the prophet if it's the prophet is god speaking through the prophet amen and they'll be subject to it but no they just disagree with it and moved on amen they got to that place where the prophet of god even had to stop testimony meetings in blatant tabernacle i've told i've told a certain pastor that one time i said brother you need to stop testimony means in this church why because the same as it was then so it was in that church amen there were those that get up and testify and they go on and on and on and on for maybe 45 minutes or an hour they were preaching amen oh yeah and not only that i i got to the place where i had to tell the brother that was doing it i said brother look in in you know out there having open air services i said please i said don't have testimony meeting why because even those out there they would come up to the microphone during the open air service and they would talk and talk for maybe 30 minutes or 40 minutes oh yeah and this one get up and talk this one get up and talk and then i would notice again of those that had gathered to hear the air the the meeting amen oh this one would leave that would lead a few more would leave yeah and i said brother i said stop those testimonies i said you can you can get somebody to read something or give us give a brief statement here and there but i said don't let them do that amen that's not the will of god amen sure brother we guess what it is important to reflect christ amen brother by the grace of god and brother for reflecting christ will reflect his wisdom amen brother you have the wisdom holy ghost wisdom that's one of the gifts amen and then anything believers need is wisdom amen and wisdom not just no don't do this don't do they don't do this sometimes it's wisdom to do this with them to do that and and again remember just to remind you because i had to remind somebody just during the last two or three days uh not not a believer as far as i know but to remind them i said well i said i just preached on this i said going to hell i said not because of what you did is what you didn't do oh yeah and another brother contacted me oh my brother he said that's true that's the truth he said i'm going to preach on that oh yeah and he's in western canada he said i'm going to pray china i said well praise the lord oh brother i've never heard that before but but it's right and he said now that not only just saying it right he said it's scripture he said jesus said it amen jesus said it and as much you didn't do it unto me did do it unto the least of these my brethren he said you didn't do it to me and he said go to hell boy he knew their heart he knew their soul he knew their spirit i'm right see not because of what they did what they didn't do amen and brother make sure what you're what you're doing is god's will amex don't don't don't be found not doing this not doing that because may god god wants you to do this god wants you as a believer as the bride of christ he wants you to go and live this kind of life be this kind of a believer amen and do this so that you're you're there instant in season out of season to do his will by grace amen because if you don't oh i don't i don't have to do this i don't have to do that or you better make sure does god want you to do it jesus wants you to do it brother whatever jesus is doing he's doing it through you and me so brother give him control amen let god have control amen and brother eventually that that pastor also stopped testimony means he had to because even even i've been there and i've swatched it and that pastor was sitting on the platform on a chair there or on a seat and he holding his bible amen and he wait and wait and wait and wait yeah or four wait till the testimony means over three get up and preach the word oh yeah and he maybe had to wait three hours and again it's like like one of the brothers i think the ministry brother that we had here once years ago but i think he's gone on now and uh and he got up one time he went he also waited in a certain church oh and after he got up he said all right he said i'm going to preach as long as i had to wait he said i waited i waited and waited for you to finish for you to stop this stop that now he said i'm going to preach the same length of time he says so as i have patience for you you're going to have patience for me amen so he said he's going to preach for how and i have amen so brother just beyond beyond your god amen so verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go to my father amen and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name this is tremendous that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and what is asking in his name is asking according to the will of god amen and if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it and if you love me keep my commandments god bless this word you may be seated so i want to share a number of things with you this evening and lord willing to get to the message he must be born again and to share with you some thoughts that the prophet has highlighted amen and i just want to begin with some things that i have shared with the church here uh maybe a number of times over over the last 40 odd years and as i said we've been here for a long time so just think uh the older ones were younger then amen but oh yeah brother jonathan was only two years old i think amen and again our brother bob here and brother mark oh where did they get their weight hair yeah and back then they they their hair was all a different color and they were they were different and i've seen old pictures and i said well my my my what's happened to them yeah yeah what's happened to them i said is that the one that i'm preaching to when i when i saw the pictures that when they were very very young amen 40 years ago amen surprise everybody and then to see the babies that i dedicated the babies are dedicated and now why now they're they're sitting there now they're they're they're up up some of them married you know not gonna dedicate their children this is amazing so brother how much longer yeah i've been thinking about that and i said lord i'm much longer so i said lord i said we've been gone on and gone on and gone on and i said believing and preaching the word of god believing and and preaching what you have done lord and what you and preaching basically what you're doing but i mean i know there's a lot around the message that are just preaching god's not a prophet god sent a prophet no no no no you could that's all right there's a time to preach that but then you got to go beyond gosh and a prophet you know what did he do go beyond what god is doing not what he did god sent the prophet and he did this and he did that but what's god now doing the prophet is gone amen since 1965. so brother and i know yes and for years preachers around the world basically preached god sent a prophet god has sent a prophet but it was in 1971 or 72 that's when uh one of the when the certain of the brethren began to get into what god did through the prophet amen and he was trying to encourage the ministry now i said let's move on he said we have preached god sent a prophet around the world but now he said we need to get into what what god did through the prophet amen and to get into the message he said by the grace of god again the problem of god said you're in the message but it's the message in you and again there's still believers around the world that are in the message but the message is not in them because if the message is in you god is god is using you to reflect the word god's re using you to reflect what he's doing amen and god is in you to give you a hunger and a thirst for what he wants to do amen so brother we thank god for what he did and we appreciate what he's doing and we're getting more and more into what he what he's doing in in in maturing us in the word of god and hallelujah and to give us the faith that that that god revealed the seals to give us to give us the faith that god sent the messenger to give us amen brother he sent he said he sent luther martin luther to give them the faith that he required of them in that day and he said john wesley to give them the faith that that god wanted in that hour and of course we know that he said the pentecostal revival amen to give the the pentecostals the faith that he was looking for a hundred years ago amen in the pentecostal revival by the grace of god but brother what is god looking for now but god sent a prophet in the in the last days amen and brother and again it's not just to put us back under pentecost no we we believe pentecost we were that's right it was god and we and we got an experience with god amen god justified us god sanctified us god baptizes with the holy ghost amen gave us access to to the lord access to the gifts amen healing salvation and right on right on right on but now brother he's increasing our faith to believe amen not just for the gifts of the spirit but to believe for the change of our bodies amen brother now god's required yes brother we're not going to do away with what god revealed but where god is adding to his word amen multiplying his word increasing his word and begins with faith and he brings it on up till he can crown it in your life and crown it in my life with the with the genuine anointing of divine love amen that i love him and he loves me amen that i know who i am praise the lord praise the lord he knows who i am but it brother through the word he's got to give you a revelation of to you of who you are amen do you know who you are amen and brother if you know who you are then you know what god's requiring of you so brother what is god doing now in these last days but again thank god for what he did but what's he doing amen where is god now the prophet is gone and many of the messengers there are not messengers of many of the the brethren that took their stand for the word back then they're gone and again it was confirming what the prophet said to brother level that he said the older ones around the message he said would not be in the rapture then when it comes to to live to be in the rapture but he still go on and they'll be they'll be identified with the resurrection amen but but i trust by the grace of god that we're here to experience the rapture amen and brother i tell you this as we go on in in what into the word and what god has revealed what god has done it ought to give us more and more rapturing faith yes pray praise the lord and again god is waiting on you and god is waiting on me what for to get into rapturing faith amen god's looking for that it's not god gonna god has already done it but now he's looking on our response he's looking on our attitude toward what he's done amen brother it's unfortunate that so many years the problem of god said it was around three years after the after the messenger i guess left a scene or after yes or after the the revival that they went into a denomination but three years after god brought the the lutheran revival brother what happened they went they went back into a denomination and he said the same thing happened to wesley eventually he said they went back and organized it and became a denomination and brother there's many are reading around the message brother just there's no more no more than the denomination oh yeah the way they act the way they live the way they worship and and and they they feel you know i'm a believer i'll do this i do that well yeah but they're just living for what they want to do you know when it comes to the natural the not not the spiritual brother the attitude of most believers i tell you this the the attitude and the anointing that we experience first when we come to this word brother the believers are not into that now there's not many believers into that anointing it's not many believers feel that that moving of the spirit of god in their hearts amen oh there was it was tremendous when god gave the the revelation to luther it was tremendous when god gave the revelation to wesley and the pentecostals and was getting more and more and more excited amen they're getting more and more spiritual oh yes amen why because they were coming more and more into fellowship with god amen they're getting more and more into a personal relationship with god amen god revealed himself and he in in luther oh yeah by the grace of god he gave ruth of the revelation justification then sanctification then the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit and brother as oh yeah the more that god began to reveal the more the more excited the people begin to get amen oh yeah i'll tell you this when he struck oh yeah even the old-fashioned salvation army and again as the brother asked me in in a certain brother's home in ontario and he said brother he said brother gerald he said what did what did william branham say about the salvation army and i thought because he was much older than i was he's going on now and he said did he say anything about the salvation army i said yes he did and he said well what did he say because he was wondering what part the salvation army was playing in what god had done and what god was doing and i well i said he said that he said the methodists he said it organized so quickly he said that god had to raise up william booth with red-on salvation amen he said to take the message on he said to the pentecostals amen and they did brother and and they preached it and they preached it and they preached it and we and we know both brother nearing the end of his ministry yeah during the end of that revival william booth and yes even his wife because she preached also and they were preaching and and exhorting the people what that we need this is what they were preaching and i've read it and i got those sermon sermons in in a book form and they said listen what what what do we need now and william booth preached it and his wife preached and they said we need now is what they had on the day of pentecost amen they said we need the anointing of the holy ghost we need the baptism of the holy ghost so they're getting so that god is taking more and more and more control of us amen they recognize that amen they were going on with wesley's message but brother as they went on and on and on and brother and the anointing was there and they felt a greater and a greater anointing in their hearts in their souls amen with their message amen they went on and they were appointing us to pentecost he said they they were pointing us to pentecost yes i said we'll move with preaching it we need the baptism of the holy ghost we need the gifts of the spirit he was preaching it we need what they had on the day of pentecost amen so brother sister we got what luther had wesley had the pentecostal saying amen so what do we need now so no brother don't look back and say well we need this we need that no we got it well at least we're supposed to have it when we are justified and praise the lord and we are sanctified we are baptized with the holy ghost amen we have we had that experience with god and it's not me that lives is god living in me it's god living in you by the grace of god amen praise the lord so what's the next thing he's going to do praise the lord brother let's not look back let's look ahead amen let's keep on marching because i've heard the prophet of god preach it amen he said they started looking at the door and he said from from back there two thousand years ago and he said the door is still open amen what door is it is the door into glory amen is the door to the kingdom of god it's the door of the resurrection and the rapture amen and it's still open and he said we keep going on looking at the door amen and they went off from john from martin luther john wesley and the the old fashioned salvation army and on into the pentecost amen oh the door's open that's right amen but the penta but the brother of god said he said pentecost doesn't recognize their message pentecost doesn't recognize what god is doing amen oh yeah the others went on and on and on and on they weren't going to fall back in into any denomination they were going to go on with god as god revealed it praise the lord we'll go amen oh brother and again oh well thank you god no no no don't don't add to the word no god's not adding to it god's revealing it amen god god didn't add to it in luther's day wesley's day or not all down true but what was needed was the revelation because it was in the word the word is the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah so brother christ says i'm the same yesterday today and forever brother and the word which is which is reflecting christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother you don't change it because it's the plan of god in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and you go right on to the end of revel the book of revelation amen it's still god amen god in his word then god in his word now god in his word tomorrow by the grace of god amen but god started this amen god did this god is doing this amen for what reason amen what did he what did he do started to deal with luther why did he start to deal with the others amen amen because in the word he was bringing us on to the resurrection and rapture amen now he didn't give that to luther he didn't get that to wesley they just went down amen and god took them off the earth but they believed in it amen they were they were they knew that down the road there's going to be a resurrection down the road there's going to be a rapture by the grace of almighty god amen i trust by grace that we're entering into the revelation of what god is doing amen brother we're not saying god do this god do this god brother god's doing it amen oh yes again like i said not waiting on why the prophet of god said god's waiting on you amazing he said god is waiting on us and not only god he said but the dead in christ are waiting on us witty what's what's what's what's the dead in christ waiting and expecting to find in you the resurrection jesus said i am the resurrection and the life amen and that's in the bride he's one with the bride the prophet of god said this is what i want to tell you he said he said christ he said that was the word in flesh he said two thousand years ago now he said the words in flesh and the bride that was jesus christ he said this is mrs jesus christ amen i pray god great grace to give us the revelation to the extent that we need it give us a revelation to the extent that it's giving us the faith that pleases god amen and what is the faith that pleases god now oh luther no no no no you know you got that that's right here you go on amen but not not even and all the faith that pleases god pentecostals oh yeah but he's looking for something more amen well what's he looking for well well the brother sister of the faith he gave luther he went and did that and he and it was preached and went around the world amen wesley the pentecostals amen she's getting more and more and more powerful amen oh yeah because luther luther spent just hours and hours and hours ministering and he even when he even the brother when he when they when they put took luther up before the church oh you got and he got to answer for this and answer for that why do you believe this why do you believe that you know because he was he was preaching now you don't have to do this you don't have to do that he said by faith we are ju they are justified amen in jesus he did it it's done hallelujah he said praise the lord amen oh they were they would have they would have killed them but he said he said here i can stand and he said i can do no other amen and he believed it oh yeah and when he when he left and went out there there was a group of military individuals there that went and they got him and they said listen we're going to take you away somewhere because they're going if not they'll kill you oh yeah so they took them away and they hit him somewhere in the forest amen but he believed here i can stand i can do no other i believe this amen brother here we are we stand i can do no other it's the end amen god has done it and god is waiting for me to surrender amen and let him amen use me so he's going to he's going to use your heart your soul your spirit amen hallelujah luther went for justified justify justified amen and we're going for praise the lord resurrected raptured amen by the anointing of the holy ghost in us sure it was justification sanctification the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost amen but brother we're moving on higher now pentecost experienced that praise the lord amen but brother now the bride has got that anointing that or the baptism of the holy ghost to the extent that it's bringing us into the open word amen amen and to give us the faith of what god is doing amen by the grace of god and again i'm not going to go to the scripture there in in the book of revelation but it's tremendous revelation 21 amen brother we come to the place where it says the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride say come and take up the water of life amen life eternal life praise the lord what what a position for the bride to be in amen i pray grace god help us god love us to believe god help us right really yeah if you believe you'll have the faith oh yeah it's not all believe and then i then i'll go get the faith know what god's asking you to believe gives you the faith faith comes by hearing the word amen by the grace of god so brother in hearing what we have heard over the years amen brother are we getting the faith that god has been working on oh what faith what are you talking about what what faith should we have now i'll tell you it's the faith that that's you believe in your heart amen oh yeah what is not the past but the present the present tense amen oh well i believe god sent a prophet well that's good so does the devil he believes that oh i believe god did this god did that yeah so does the devil amen and you know the devil knows that we're in the hour of the resurrection of the rapture he does yes that's why the bible says he's come down with great wrath why because he knows he knows his time is short amen brother if he's coming out of a great wrath we ought to be going up with great faith oh praise the lord amen to get out of here praise the name of the lord brother don't let this hinder you don't let that into you amen let's let's let's believe oh praise i feel i feel like i'm being caught up i feel like i i'm moving out of this dimension into another one oh yeah keep keep that faith keep believing what god has said and what god has done in the opening of the word praise the name of the lord that's tremendous amen we could go to those scriptures i'm sure of revelation 10 and even revelation 21 and 22 concerning what god has done and what god is doing brother it's like coming to the climax yeah it's coming to the climax of what god's done amen it's coming to the climax of what god is doing praise the lord brother it's where there was a cl there was there was a climax that we come to amen that's why we're here what was the climax it was to accept or reject the messenger oh yeah was he the messenger or wasn't he amen so you come to a climax in your experience in god dealing with you amen god wants you to god wants you to believe the messenger and god god will bring it out oh yeah then you're going to stay with it you're going to confess it you're going to believe it amen you're going to accept the messenger and god leads us on to a greater climax are you going to accept the message amen accept or reject the message amen so brother we we can grow and mature in the message but it comes brother as we mature god is looking for us to accept what he's revealing oh because part of that faith is god sent the prophet god set the prophet malachi 4 malachi 4 amen that's right but now let's are you going on and maturing and growing amen as a son and daughter of god amen that god is reflecting in you now what he did through the prophet by the grace of god amen to believe yet to believe what god did through that prophet to believe what the prophet said amen brother god help us amen to believe in our hearts the message amen remember god took the prophet off the sea amazing 1965. why well brother bram said that one time he said you know when it comes to the resurrection rapture he said when it come you consider what god has done he said oh he said it'll just take he said some some man or woman he said brother sister or he said might take a child he said you know he said they'll stand there he said a child he said they'll stand there and raise their hands and say lord i'm coming home and he said it'll trigger the rapture oh yeah amen brother how real is the message to us how real is the revelation of what god has done to us amen brother luther had justification and god made it real to him amen and brother luther john wesley as i said he was in a lutheran college meeting oh yeah john wesley yes there was there was a brother there that believed believed in luther believed what he preached believe what he was teaching and brother they had cottage means back then 500 years ago i guess and and all they were doing this and they're doing that praising the lord for what justification justification answered john wesley amen god was dealing with john wesley and he went to one of those one of those cottage meetings that they were having and his brother was preaching the the the revelation and the message that god had given through martin luther and john wesley was there and brother and they were stood up and they were worshiping and his and john wesley raised his hands and closed his eyes and he was getting into the spirit amen oh and it struck john wesley oh i'm strength to fight by faith amen because john martin luther thought he had to get up and do this and do this and do this to be to be justified oh yeah we had to go here and go there and do and do all these things he should be justified in the presence of god but no god gave him the revelation jesus justified him amen and then john wesley brother i tell you this john wesley and they got up you know and very very very early in the morning and spent so many hours in prayer and then then john wesley would go down to the to go down to the mines where they were they were mining the certain things there and the workers that came out he preached to then he would preach to the workers that were going to go in yeah amen believe that he had to do this and he had to do that amen but when he was in that meeting and that brother was preaching martin luther's message the revelation of sanctification struck john wesley oh yeah then he knew oh i didn't have to do this jesus has done it we're sanctified through our lord jesus christ amen and it struck john wesley and he went out with that revelation by the grace of god amen the pentecostals went out with the revelation what god had done in them praise the lord hallelujah oh yes amen how many realize that what you want to come to the pentecostal message the pentecostal revival and how that started and and it was a brother god used it was a black brother i believe somewhere somewhere down in southern united states there amen oh yeah and he was having prayer and he was praying for what god did on the day of pentecost and he believed oh we're going to go on to something greater greater greater greater god did this god did that amen lord what we're looking for now lord what you did here and he was calling for the pentecostal anointing amen the baptism of the holy ghost oh yeah and and i've read proportions where they they said to that brother and he he would get there in the pulpit to pray and he'd have he'd have a box a cardboard box and he put it over his head and he just stayed there put the box over his head and he started to pray amen and nobody was to disturb him praying honest they wanted to pray with him amen and brother it was it was through that that hour through that anointing through that anger and that thirst that god set down the baptism of the holy ghost amen in our brother through our brother but again where where are we now amen god wanted that any amen and praise the lord the father of god said he said god always sends the holy ghost ahead he said to create in the heart is it a hunger for what god wants to do amen praise the lord and god that god has sent the holy ghost ahead created luther amen a hunger for justification amen a hunger for sanctification and wesley a hunger for the baptism of the holy ghost and gifts of the spirit and pentecost amen getting more and more and more spiritual and coming more and more in contact with god amen god was dealing with them in their hearts and in their souls praise the lord and yet yes yes back then pentecost they believed oh concerning what god had done and what god was doing back there they felt oh this must this might be going to take us on to the coming of the lord some pentecostals believed it not all but some did amen and the thing that they failed to recognize was the message amen the messenger and the message that would give them resurrection and rapturing faith amen by the grace of god so brother is the message giving you resurrection and rapturing faith god help us to believe god god allow us to trust god amen that we're not going to get caught up with with the devil because he wants to get caught up with the natural things yeah in this world and in your life there's too many believers caught up with natural but how many are caught up with the spiritual amen oh you're again don't be religious be spiritual amen there's too many believers just religious to go to church some don't go to church amen there's a lot of believers feel that they don't need a pastor they don't need the ministry and so on and yet as i i said listen i said those people they need to go and listen to the the questions and answers on the seals why because they asked the father of god in questions and answers on the seals amen does the bride have a ministry he said yes she said he said she's at it he said since since the day of pentecost right on through and she still got it now he said amen what was that he said oh it's just a vibe full ministry in the bride amen and yet there are those that didn't deny it feeling that we don't have that need a pastor we don't need this we don't need that as i said brother it struck me when i when i when i was in the church and and we all went around the altar and knelt down and prayed and by the uh after after the main part of the service was over after the you know the sermon was over and everybody was getting to praise the lord and worship the lord and we come to the altar and knelt down to pray and others were standing behind us aren't just still praying amen and yet as i said there was that sister that knelt down next to me and she started to pray and she said she said oh i thank you lord for the message amen for bringing us to the message and bringing bringing the message to us amen and and now she said we don't have to come under any the authority of any man i said lord i said please convict her i said she needs to come under the authority of a ministry amen not that i don't not that i was in the ministry then that i knew of i didn't know amen and as i said the first time i preached was was in that church amen and i was only maybe 18 or 19 years old and i i don't i don't recall exactly how old i was but again like i said amen i preached and then again because why to 45 minutes you know you're wishing that now maybe no amen well although because we all got together in the church there and because we're going brother cater god bless him and he was going to show us the films of brother branham and it was so far back then that that the the projector that he was using of course the films was a big round oh that's that's what it was like on the machine he was using amen and back then not like now back then you had to wait till it got dark amen when the sun went down and and everything got dark then we could show the show the film but uh because because it would it was too light you would you wouldn't see the film like as you should amen so that's why the pastor said all right he said why well we wait for it to get dark he said i'm going to ask our brother brother geraldo she said from saint john's he said to come up and and and just uh minister to us for a while amen so i did go out and minister for about 45 minutes i wasn't expecting to have to do it you know but he just he just said all right brother you can come up now not that i wanted to but but but he wanted me and again as i said after i finish then that brother rose up to give his testimony there and brother burns and he spoke in tongues and brother bill agat interpreted and god confirmed what i said yeah and i i was sitting at the back seat or not sitting standing and i cried and cried and cried to the extent that i looked down and i could see the the tears were leaving stains on the floor and uh but the lord says it was my word not not the brother's word amen and so on and he confirmed it this way confirmed it that way amen so brother and sister big why because i i was ministering against the spirits i saw among the people yeah so i thank god for that for that anointing i thank god for that for that gift and i know even the pastor got upset thank you brother he said he said i i was wondering he said what you meant when you wrote me that letter and uh he said now i know thank you amen so brother god help us then we're going to get in the spirit of what god has done and what god is doing amen brother is god using you to move on to the rapture is god using you to get us more and more into a resurrection faith and i know there's a lot they think god's going to do it god's going to do it no he's waiting on you brother he's give us the word to give us the faith to do it amen so god help us that we're going to believe the word believe what god has done but brother what is god doing let's believe what god's doing he's working on you he's giving you more and more and more of that word to give you the faith that that is going to fulfill what what he's promised in these last days what's what's next thing in order well they're not going back to luther we're not going back wesley not going back to the pentecostals and you know we're not going back to william branham he was the prophet and we thank god for what he did through him amen but then he said he he had to go he knew he was going oh yeah he he mentioned that on tape that he knew he was gone so brother why because there's another generation rising to believe the word for the rapture are you going to be so in the spirit that when you're walking somewhere and and you look and you see somebody there and there's somebody that came that rose from the dead or do we have that kind of faith amen do we have that kind of faith to believe in the resurrection really looking for the resurrection really experiencing the resurrection if sister coffee appeared to you would you recognize her she'd be young it's like i said a few times i've been in maybe a shopping mall and i saw this person saw that one i said who's that and i was thinking oh lord that's not brother stones was it it's not sister sonzo no no because well if it is it's the prophet god said they're going to appear to us and we're going to change and go into a dimension with them and we're going to have fellowship with them for for certain we call it time certain period and so on and then he said alleluia then he said we're going to look up and there's jesus he said in the cloud praise the lord amen please please let's not let's not ignore it let's not forget it the promise listen when it comes to what god promised god's done this god's done that god has fulfilled this fulfill that and right on down to the end we can say oh my we're at the end of the bible now so what's the next thing well we've got to recognize what god has done for the gentiles and that is sending the prophet of god and the opening of the word oh yes like i said he had those three signs and he's the first and the second and the third was to get the people to believe yeah he had the sign in the hand he had the discernment that god gave him and so on it was god with him god in him doing it and he had that sign in the hand then he had the discernment he said what was god what why was he given that why did he have to do that and that was to get their your attention and to get you to believe because the angel said get the people get them to believe amen and what was it to believe believe the message it was to believe what god was doing amen is to point them to the resurrection the rapture and believe god is waiting on us to surrender to that faith right amen he told me to say it that way god's waiting on us to surrender to that faith it's there oh yeah we're not looking for it it's there it's not looking for us it's there amen but he's waiting for us to surren we've been oh we believe in the resurrection yeah but let's not believe up it's here amen jesus said i am the resurrection and the light amen the bride is christ in us the bride is the resurrection and the life amen my lord i pray grace help us to believe it help us lord to believe not to what's going on in this whole world oh my we're so conscious of what's going on around the world now with this coven 19 issues brother um how much where should we be uh conscious of what god is doing spiritually not in the judgment that all that's a part of judgment around the world what about the grace of god to the bride to get us out let's worship him amen and brother the more more though the more that those things are happening in the world and around the world and in this whole earth the more that the bride is going into glory getting closer and closer and closer to the reality of the resurrection and the rapture but as i said if the problem of god said it's you know there's only going to be this number going to resurrection going to rapture brother what about hog again all the people around the message that are going to be left behind brother oh well god's done this god done that god done it yeah but what what have you done and what are you doing what effect is that having on you is it controlling your life is it changing the way you think is it changing the way you act so that you're controlled by by the word you're controlled by by by the the by the message of the hour you're controlled by all the promise of god oh yeah see god is going to make the word flesh in you and if if anything god's word that is making flesh in you is is the resurrection and the rapture yeah oh grace to us amen brother by the grace of god god help us to believe that the resurrection and the rapture is with us the resurrection rapture is in us yeah speak the word why cry speak unfortunately there's going to be too many left behind to cry because they missed it oh thought to mr a rapture it already happened and you didn't know it what didn't know it after all god did and after all god revealed to his elect and we and we knew that it was going to there was will be a resurrection rapture but it was just part of a religion it's unfortunate that the message is no more than a religion to a lot of people they got these cree and oh yeah as i said now now the different things in the message are just just creeds boy this message that message it's just a creed well i believe this i believe that oh yeah this message there on the seals this message of the church ages oh yeah to a lot of people it's just a doctrine and just just the oil a part part of the creed that makes of their their religion they're denominated but i tell you if it it is the holy ghost in you the word living in you the word made flesh in you i'll tell you this brother you're you're going to be spiritual and conscious of resurrection rapture 24 hours a day morning noon and night every day you won't be able to live without thinking about it you won't be able to live without arguing and thirsting for it oh lord we're getting closer to the resurrection lord i feel it lord i want to let go and let you have your way in in me amen but it's too many people too many believers that are more caught up with this world and what's going on in this world the natural things than they are with the spiritual satan is there to deceive them brother let me share with you some other things he did say he said now he said my subject this morning i trust that god will reveal this and each time he said if you who take the tapes and listen and i hope and trust that you have had spiritual understanding yeah not religious spiritual amen you have had spiritual understanding of what god has been trying to get over to the church is he getting it to you then he got the revelation oh god's not a prophet oh yeah he revealed the mysteries this mystery this mystery that mystery but they'll just jump over the mystery of the resurrection the mystery of the rapture brother the prophet said what god has done is to give us rapturing faith amen brother what god will reveal in the luther gave him justification faith and the others sanctification faith the pentecostals the gifts of the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit that faith that brought them into into that revelation yeah and that word was made flesh in them now god is bringing us into the revelation of resurrection rapture amen pray the grace of god that he'll make it real in us what's got more control of you malachi 4 just that god sent a prophet or is it the message and what god has done what god is doing amen so he said i hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what god has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out yeah it's with the prophet he's been doing this saying it this way doing it that way amen but he said yeah god says this but come i want to show you what god's doing oh god said this yes but look what he's doing amen god said this but he's doing this amen so he said but being trying to get over to the church without saying it right out see he said we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out yeah it does some to leave some to ponder over amen grace and he said but that's done purposely and it must be done that way amen and some would say you mean god would purposely do a thing like that he said he certainly did and he does it yet today well when did he say that 1964. yeah what was the message the unveiling of god and it was page 5 paragraph 22 amen grace to us another quote he said the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval amen neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved and he said his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah does he love us he says yes he loves us but how shall we know that he loves us he said we shall know because he said so amen and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit amen hallelujah is sharing his life with us hallelujah praise the lord he he loves us and he's sharing his life with us amen the the nature of his nature of his life he's sharing with you amen and he's sharing his love with you and his life with you to the extent oh yeah you're going to act like him you're going to talk like him you're going to live like him you're going to have his nature where'd this come from oh you've had an experience with jesus oh yes i've had experience with jesus i love him yeah he loves you amen you don't love him because he did this because he did that you love him because it's just you it's just the nature amen because you're related amen in the new birth as the prophet preached on you must be born again amen amen so you're not you're not subject to the natural birth you've got the nature of your parents the nature of your grandparents in the natural birth but if you're born again you've got the nature of your heavenly father amen and that's there to control the old nature amen some of it it'll take away and it'll it'll kill it amen but others there just control it oh yeah so great we got to live in the spirit walk in the spirit so the spirit is in control amen wonderful so again he said does he love us yes how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen do we believe god see god said this and and the devil quoted it to eve remember he was the first evangelist and he said yea god said he quoted the word yeah but i say unto you but you shall not surely die god said you shall surely die he said but you shall not surely die he just put in a word god said you shall surely die the devil said you shall not amen he wasn't denying the absolute the all the word no no he wasn't denying what god said he was just going to go to get her to think different about it amen is going to just just get her to have a different idea oh oh yes yes jeff right oh yes because it was so close to the truth she believed it she believed it and there's believers today brother god said this god said that got you oh my the lord wants to do this the lord wants to do that in their life but they must want to just relax a little and do this do that and something else family friends neighbors no no stay with the word amen stay as separated as god wants you to stay separated yeah oh yes and and there's there's not many that are willing to let go and let god have that way they don't want to do this they want to do that and sometimes that's where god is testing you your faith amen so how extremity does god want you to be amen so god help us see again that's like family and i know that hurts a lot of people when it comes to separation from natural family but like brother branham said to his brothers his natural sibling brothers after after after their mother died yeah and he said oh he said okay he said we want we won't see one another now as much as we did he said we would see one another coming back to visit mom but she's gone so he said he says we won't see each other very much why because they never read anything in common that would draw them together yeah to god be the glory amen so brother what what what kind of a separation are you willing to take what kind of separation are you willing to endure grace to us now be careful you got to control it don't let the devil control it yeah you got to keep it on your guard amen what is the will of god yeah well there's times when god with god to separate you from this this relative and he he wouldn't have you do anything with that one and there's others maybe the lord will allow you to just have fellowship with that one because that one got a right spirit and right attitude oh yeah if they got the right spirit right at you the lord will allow you a lot of that fellowship but it's radically not right the spirit's not right now yeah so god help us brother let jesus control you let jesus lead amen amen just do what the lord wants you to do just and keep your spirit right and keep your attitude right by the grace of god amen yeah because uh i know that my natural parents one time did strike me because they said oh because when we go when we went out to that area we'd always go down to brother and sister barnes and we did occasionally drop in to see my natural parents you know and just to say hello or something you know and but once one time we met there and they they really blasted me you know oh you you come and you always bypass us and you go down there and uh to to that house yeah because we were there for fellowship but we again there's a number of times we'd always drop in to to greet my natural parents and say hello to them well thank the lord because that we still manifested the right attitude because they even in in their house and in their living room they had the pictures they had pictures of brother branham and the pillow fire on the wall yeah they had two or three of those pictures and another time i went in there and i was looking around oh and i noticed that they had some message books and i don't know if i gave them to give the book message books to them or not oh yeah and in the library there was the message books yeah and they were marked yeah so i said amazing so brother you got to be led by the spirit amen so but again like i said that doesn't bother me if they they didn't like this or didn't like that and i just leave that with the lord and pray for them oh yeah you pray for them amen so brother jesus brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit amen remember he said the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval and he said neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval no everything going for everything looks good so god of god's approving what i'm doing no that doesn't mean that and he says his approval of any of us is only in the beloved he said his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes how shall we know and he said we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and he gave us of his spirit amen placing us as sons how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass in your life amen that's god's approval well we think oh if god's god's god's approval everything's going to go good everything's going to be nice everything's going to be he's going to let this work out no no no no god doesn't necessarily do that no as the prophet of god said you know there's just time from the cloudy skies and storms of life it says are no signs of god's disapproval no and neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his approval no because sometimes god allows us to go through the rough times to bring out our faith and to keep our faith strong give us you know strength in our faith amen he's trying us testing us and making us a witness to family friends and neighbors the grace of god so brother grace brother i tell you this we must be born again to bring out the life that god's looking for requires a new birth by the grace of god amen my sorry it takes so long it'd be before coming to a close here we're born again by by the grace of god to bring us to a living faith not a dead letter but a living faith amen representing the kingdom of god amen not representing the natural things of this whole world but representing the eternal by the grace of god now yesterday afternoon a brother called me on the phone am i he was delighted oh he was so happy he was oh right there oh god bless you brother wonderful praise the lord and it was our brother alec cater a man in nova scotia and he said and he was on my mind and i was praying for him and praying the grace of god amen to bless him and and and to you know to help him and what he's doing in in halifax and or in that area and he said oh brother i just felt the call you said just dissolved my heart in my soul he said just one wanted to talk to you and i said oh brother good i said because he was on my heart as well and like i said he was a few months here before he went to nova scotia and he apparently i'm not sure the exact time but he was he's still open to get back here again even again this year so he says so we're going to keep praying for our brother alec and the grace of god be with him and he wanted to share with me just uh three quotes that it was a blessing to him he said brother keep preaching he said don't stop he said just keep laying in that word and keep preaching this keep preaching that and i said okay brother because he he wanted us to let me know he's oh brother i was really blessed he said but what you ministered on sunday he says thank the lord amen oh he was he was he was i guess in a sense i said lord if he's here he said he'd be jumping up and down you know because he was that happy sounded that happy on the phone so he shared these three quotes of the prophet on the subject of prayer and he said prayer in the message expectation 1961. he said prayer is the most powerful weapon that ever was put in the control of human beings yeah prayer why because it's it's coming into a real contact with jesus and he said there is listen he said there is no atomic bomb and no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer your prayers can accomplish more than the bombs amen and he said prayer will change the mind of god did you know that he said it did ethan in the scriptures and in the message my angel shall go before thee 1953. he said now he said he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that weapon he said his prayer amen prayer is what changes things he said the christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty god in the name of jesus christ and he said he doesn't realize what power that is and brother oh my through the baptism of the holy ghost through prayer we've been put out given access to such power such anointing amen no wonder that god has given us the power over all the power of the world over the world the flesh and the devil yeah who's controlling you the world the nature of the world or is it your flesh or is it the devil grace and he said again 1961 in the message of greater than solomon is here now he said we want you to remember that prayer is the most mighty force that there is in the world prayer even changes the mind of god he said how many know that he said that's right god told a prophet one day go up and tell a king hezekiah say go tell him to set his house in order because he's going to die but lived if he set his house in order amen god's looking for obedience by the grace of god amen shall the lord help us of my prayer brother grace in the name of jesus we'll get to the maybe the lord willing we'll try to get to him you must be born again on wednesday or on sunday and uh after sunday we're hoping to get our brother jonathan to minister again by the grace of god amen so be in prayer in the message perfect faith brother brown said jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person are you odd to the world and he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god and it says if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world and that's true the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit and what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you'd not do and then the people begin to save and you'll be a mystic person to them he said that's the way it is to all believers they are mystics and the people that don't understand because they live in a world to themselves and he said jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him and when he spoke to them they say this and then they said why you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see there wasn't in the world that he lived in and they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him amen and brother if we are living christ living in us the world don't understand us why do we do this why we leave that out why we're going to do this why we're going to act this way say this or whatever yeah brother they don't understand the total separation from unbelief grace to us so he said when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ he said there now you're getting into bright material and you're getting into a rapturing condition amen so are we in dried material and a rapturing condition by the way we live act and talk amen and react what's it reflecting is it reflecting your old nature your new nature is it reflecting all just time or is reflecting our faith in eternity grace amen you walk by faith getting into a rapturing condition bright material amen he said that means for each of us not just the pastor not just the deacons trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone and you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody he said in there but you and god amen god's dealing with you god's leading you amen god's encouraging you amen again it's not you that lives is christ that liveth in you i pray this grace for our young people amen that you have the experience that you're living for jesus and jesus has lived for you amen and he's sharing his life with you and in you oh praise god grace in the name of jesus yeah even to our young brothers and sisters here as i said i was very very young and and i look back and see things that happened that was even a mystery to me but i go back with that revelation that it was god with me god in me and he was using me and i i didn't know that that they that you know even family or friends and neighbors thought this about gerald lush you thought that about you know and i i didn't consider myself to be religious or spiritual not back then not when i was that young you know but they did and that's why they tested me and they were tempting me you know like i said the one time they were trying to get cheryl lost to swear you know and they they're kind of gerald yeah say this what say that no what am i going to say that for it was a swear word and and just my friends you know my age or a little older than me and oh because apparently they knew that i would seem to see like they knew something about me that i didn't know and i i didn't think about that young and the same thing again as i said when my uncle died and my mother's brother and oh she was really upset and all down and out because of it and so they didn't know what to do and and when they got the flowers for him and to take up to see him and that's when the were saying oh uh gerald they said would you write something on a note just a note and write something so that we can attach to the flowers and i said oh okay you know i didn't uh not that i said that i didn't think well i said why in the world did they ask me so then why didn't my mother do it why didn't my father do it so on now so anyway i went and did it oh they said good good so they went and took it and attached it to the flower so again it was it's god it's christ so he's with you as he was with me and he as he is with me he was with you amen of course again i didn't know that i was being going to be called to preach to pastor because sister byron said brother because she said when they come to the message i'll tell you there was a there was another sister in control of the of the cottage meetings and she basically that sister basically preached and did this controlled everything and finally when they come to the message they said oh well we've got to get a brother and so they contacted me and said brother we want you to take control of the cottage meetings i said oh no i don't want to do that i said let brother burns do it and i said or this other brother i said you know i said they're older than i am they said no no no they said we want you to do it i said no i don't want to do it. they said we feel that you are called to do it brother and i said oh i'm not called to preach she said yes you are she said we know that although i was only there occasionally in a college meeting and there's a little fellowship with them here and there they said no brother we feel that we thank the lord for that amen so we i we had to have a meeting and the sister pulled back for me to move in to to control the cottage meetings well thank the lord brother it was god in control not me so i pray god's in control of your life amen yes siree it's even like our brother jonathan this is and if if if he's called god won't let it won't let him go no no got to be there be there be there to do this to do this this would be a burden to him to do this so thank the lord he's with us to minister amen praise the name of the lord to god be the glory i never thought about that when he was just the two-year-old it's hard to believe that he was two years old sitting in academy on a chair yeah but again he had the respect amen and as i said he kept he kept looking straight ahead amen so i oh yeah i'd like to see another one there jonathan jr he's looking straight ahead amen so i pray the grace of god be continue to be with our brother jonathan amen that he's there to minister for us to help us so brother what is it it's faith it is faith god's working on faith amen yeah oh yeah and god god is testing our faith god's working on your faith god's testing your faith god is god is there to to increase your faith to strengthen your faith praise the lord amen god is there to bring it to a place where your faith the faith is in control amen we live by faith walk by faith the grace of god amen so brother brother brown said a man lives by faith a man lives walks by faith and i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ amen there now you're getting into bride material and you're getting into a rapturing condition amen he said that means for each one of us not just pastors deacons trustees that means for laity every individual walks in a world with god alone and you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders you packed them out and whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on and if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it amen praise the lord exactly amen you're gonna if god wants you to do this god wants you to do that amen nobody can talk you out of it i'm gonna do it there's just decisions that we've had to make over the years oh oh don't do this don't do this don't do this i said well but the lord wants me to do grace so he said if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same and you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails amen god gave us that kind of faith amen amen we need it brother so you're not led by the devil you're led by jesus you're led by god amen you're not led by your doubts and your unbelief you're led by faith amen that is not me that lives is christ that live within me brother and again that you've really got to have that basic revelation to please god and to do what god wants you to do amen did you you could say as as they said not me that lives is christ living in me can you say that can you say amen to that is that the life you live you sisters you brothers or the life i live amen is christ living in me amen i'm doing what god wants me to do grace from god to us amen so remember jesus was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others and he said we just we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us to resist is to just simply turn him down amen just walk away from him god said a certain thing and no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to the devil he said your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says amen and he said to he that has an ear that listens see what the spirit saith unto the churches the one that's got the listening post amen that catches what the spirit says to the churches amen grace amen grace of god i just finished with this quote here listen so is it with the church today we've got too many people we've got too many of them that's ashamed to go into complete relationship with god to a new life and a new birth if we're the bride of christ then we can't we go into relationship then why can't we go into the relationship then all the shameness and backwardness and all that's gone from us if we come into a complete relationship we've been born again and he said the president of the united states could be standing on the street and you shout hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah you don't care because you're coming to a relationship you're born again you're a new child of god and we are in a shekinah glory with god fellowshipping with god and what we need today brother is a worship under the blood a worship in complete relationship to die out amen for the glory of god praise the lord god help us that we are bride material amen and the bright material is the word praise the lord in questions and answers on the seals i referred to this it said would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture sure he said that's what's going on right now certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ amen praise the lord sure she's got a ministry a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour and it will be so humble amen praise the
