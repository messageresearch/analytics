[36:40] a matte praise the name of the Lord God
[36:52] bless yes just before we get into the
[36:57] word we're going to sing only believe
[36:59] again and but just to pass on greetings
[37:03] from our brother Willie McGowan he's the
[37:09] pastor in Whitehorse in the Yukon I
[37:13] spoke with him last night on the phone
[37:15] and I mean we we spoke and talked for
[37:20] over an hour and I guess we're
[37:24] administering and preaching one to the
[37:26] other that's why we were so long but he
[37:31] sends his greetings for the st. cyr and
[37:35] so I did ask you to pass on greetings to
[37:38] our sister Susan and brother Phillip
[37:41] power and of course the brother Dwayne
[37:44] that is his song leader in Whitehorse
[37:47] because brother Dwayne was here for a
[37:50] month I believe was this year two years
[37:54] ago I can't recall but he was he was a
[37:58] fine brother nice spirit a man so the
[38:02] grace of God to him now our brother
[38:05] Willie
[38:06] you know he's pastoring a small assembly
[38:09] and much smaller than the one that we're
[38:13] here in tonight so we pray the grace of
[38:16] God to him as he ministers to them and I
[38:20] am also familiar with the pastor that
[38:24] was there before him and brother Don and
[38:29] what was the last name sister Betty
[38:32] phablets
[38:34] brother Don Bab let's write and he was
[38:38] the brother that I met in in brother ro
[38:42] Hildebrand's convention in 1988 and I
[38:48] was moving on at the time through the
[38:51] vestibule we're we're in a universe
[38:53] the building and a room there and but he
[38:59] caught up with me and he said brothers
[39:02] just want to share some thoughts with
[39:04] you and he said and to thank you and the
[39:08] brothers and and the Assembly in st.
[39:10] John's for what you've done and it was a
[39:14] brother dawn that informed me he said I
[39:16] don't know if you're aware of it or not
[39:18] but he said as a result of what you
[39:21] brethren have done and the material that
[39:23] we printed and sent overseas and it was
[39:27] quite quite a bit of that we printed and
[39:31] at one point there we did the Brethren
[39:33] did print and I believe brother Mark
[39:35] typed it and into the language to get
[39:39] the kiss Wally is a Swahili Swahili in
[39:45] the Swahili language and there was we
[39:48] there was three different booklets and
[39:50] we they did I think brother mark typed
[39:54] in I saw him one time in the basement of
[39:57] his mother's and father's old house and
[40:00] he was typing it in in the in that
[40:03] language amazing and we printed three
[40:07] ten thousand of each so that was thirty
[40:10] thousand in Swahili and he said brethren
[40:14] and not only that those books because in
[40:18] 1997 her brother met me at the
[40:20] convention in in Phoenix and thank me
[40:24] thank me for it and because of he said
[40:28] it's still going those books and he said
[40:31] no only that it was it was the first
[40:33] message material he said in our language
[40:35] so that's encouraging to the brothers
[40:38] and I drove to our brother mark here for
[40:40] sure for taking the time to do what he
[40:43] did amazing and but our brother Don said
[40:47] brother as a result of what you've done
[40:49] and all the Missouri who printed and
[40:51] sent overseas
[40:52] he said you brethren have started over
[40:55] three hundred churches he said in Africa
[40:59] and he said they're still growing that
[41:02] was in nineteen eighty eight so I would
[41:05] imagine there's a lot
[41:07] a lot more churches there now amen so
[41:10] god bless the Saints in Africa and we
[41:12] pray God rests our brother Don balances
[41:14] soul because he was in Africa and he was
[41:18] either ministering or he was they called
[41:21] him off the pray I'm not sure and he
[41:24] died in the pulpit he had a heart attack
[41:28] so we pray God rest his soul and put it
[41:32] this way I would believe by the grace of
[41:35] God that he's in he's he's got more joy
[41:37] now than we do or not yeah we've got
[41:42] we've got a measure of the joy that he's
[41:44] experiencing without measurement a man
[41:46] so God God rest his soul
[41:49] so our brother really is is ministering
[41:52] and pastoring in that area now as our
[41:55] brother Don did many years ago so he
[41:58] sends his greetings and we enjoyed the
[42:01] fellowship one to another and and thank
[42:03] the Lord the quote a quote there was a
[42:08] quote that I was looking for regarding
[42:11] the rapture and the resurrection and
[42:14] that I just couldn't find it I knew I
[42:17] had it somewhere but I couldn't didn't
[42:20] know where it was well I mentioned it to
[42:23] our brother Willie and started the quote
[42:26] he finished it and and he sent me down
[42:29] by email after he sent me down to a copy
[42:33] of the quote and where it was so
[42:35] sometimes might want to share that with
[42:36] you because it has to do with the
[42:38] rapture and the resurrection and I'm not
[42:43] what a blow be it will be the actual
[42:46] resurrection and the actual rapture
[42:48] itself and some comments said the
[42:50] prophet of God made and concerning how
[42:54] it's going to happen what's going to be
[42:56] happening
[42:56] you know regarding the living Saints and
[42:59] those that are gone on and Jesus and I
[43:02] said oh I oh I said I've been in the
[43:05] last few years I've been trying to
[43:06] remember where that was and that quote
[43:10] and I believe it was the quote was in
[43:13] questions and answers 1964 in
[43:17] Jeffersonville so I would share that
[43:19] with you some
[43:21] other time by the grace of God and some
[43:23] other thoughts as well on the rapture
[43:26] because it is serious but it comes to
[43:29] the when it comes to the rapture listen
[43:32] God's not requiring of us just what he
[43:35] what he in a sense he is but but he's
[43:38] required more of us than he did of any
[43:40] other age because he is revealed more to
[43:44] us than than any other age we got where
[43:47] he's requiring what they had plus what
[43:50] he has given us in this hour and in this
[43:52] age a man
[43:54] it is the progressive revelation of God
[43:56] right from Genesis to Revelation and
[43:59] right from the first church age right
[44:01] down down to the to the Lord of C&H and
[44:03] to the bride age by the grace of God so
[44:07] brother it's tremendous it is the faith
[44:10] that pleases God when we when we get the
[44:13] revelation of who we are and where we
[44:15] are in God's plan amen
[44:18] so you and brother sister God reveals it
[44:22] to the beginning and God reveals it to
[44:24] the end there's the Alpha
[44:26] there's the Omega the Omega but the
[44:28] others that the others they're just
[44:29] going on by faith as God reveals the
[44:32] word they did go on and witness for the
[44:34] word witness for the word witness for
[44:36] the word because that's what God
[44:37] required of them I'm going to reveal
[44:39] this to you I want you to go out and be
[44:41] a witness for it amen and but now there
[44:44] comes a generation that he reveals the
[44:46] word and brother now what are we get
[44:49] what are we doing were its to give us
[44:51] the faith for the resurrection and the
[44:53] rapture amen
[44:55] it to get out of here to finish it true
[44:59] brothers sister so more is required of
[45:02] us than was required of the others all
[45:05] they had plus a man so it's a tremendous
[45:09] responsibility a man so brothers nots
[45:13] and please in the name of the Lord don't
[45:16] take it lightly whatever you do you need
[45:19] to be and if you do if you're taking
[45:22] lately and you and you just take the
[45:24] same attitude that they had in Luther's
[45:26] day Wesley's day the Pentecostal day
[45:28] well you're gonna miss the rapture
[45:29] you're gonna miss the resurrection
[45:32] most definitely
[45:34] because why because they believed and
[45:36] went on and breached amen we got to
[45:38] believe and go on and bring the
[45:40] resurrection in the rapture into
[45:43] manifestation that's our believing for
[45:46] the change of their body amen praise the
[45:48] name of the Lord so I'll bring in more
[45:51] thoughts on that regarding regarding us
[45:54] getting together with the Saints that
[45:56] are that are gone on a man and that's
[46:00] the quote that I was looking for and
[46:02] again it is in in the questions than
[46:04] answers 1964 a man but I want to tonight
[46:08] by the grace of God to try and get into
[46:11] the message on the leadership and to
[46:15] finish it because there's other things
[46:17] we want to do regarding something that
[46:19] brother Alec and read highlighted on the
[46:21] internet and something brother Matthew
[46:23] had highlighted also on the Internet
[46:25] I want to get bring those things in and
[46:28] I have also I mentioned to a while ago
[46:31] that we wanted our brother Chad to
[46:33] finish his testimony amen and so I don't
[46:38] know if one service would be enough for
[46:40] him but we'll see
[46:41] so keep keep our brother Chad in prayer
[46:43] a man
[46:44] so by the grace of God so the Lord
[46:47] blesses and I showed this to you a
[46:50] number of years ago but I guess some of
[46:53] you didn't didn't see it or didn't
[46:54] notice it and this is dated December the
[46:58] 29th 1965 and this was the evening news
[47:03] and the front page was dealing with a
[47:07] memorial for William Branham and
[47:11] remember this that he the Winterbottom
[47:13] just he physically died in the in the
[47:17] vehicle accident just just a few days
[47:19] before this and this was the gathering
[47:22] in Batam tavern Akal and it said it is
[47:25] the final respects paid to it says
[47:30] reverent Branham and in the evenin this
[47:34] there's an interview with a Roman
[47:36] Catholic bishop a man who spoke very
[47:39] highly of William Branham and of wet
[47:42] winter Browns attitude and William
[47:44] Branham spirit and he said if just
[47:46] anyone
[47:47] you met and talked to and knew that they
[47:50] had love he said it was william branham
[47:52] he said he said it's just it was just
[47:55] his spirit it was just his nature
[47:57] it was his character he had divine love
[48:00] that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[48:02] in him a man so brother they spoke more
[48:06] and more I guess the better of him with
[48:08] a better attitude in the spirit then
[48:10] then even some Pentecostals a man
[48:14] because you know why because there's a
[48:17] lot of Pentecostals and
[48:20] nondenominational interdenominational
[48:22] they felt that William Branham was taken
[48:25] off the scene because of what he
[48:28] preached they felt that his ministry was
[48:31] was of God the the signs and the wonders
[48:33] that he had the gifts that he had the
[48:36] discernment of the thoughts and intents
[48:37] of the heart and now remember not just
[48:40] present tense but past future past and
[48:43] future tense amen
[48:44] he God revealed this country of that and
[48:46] of course you know about the sign he had
[48:48] in his hand and and many people saw that
[48:51] and but they believed it was God because
[48:54] he would take he would take your hand
[48:56] into his your left hand and and and he
[49:00] would things would happen on his hand
[49:02] and it was shown and revealed to other
[49:04] Branham what was wrong with that person
[49:06] and he would pray for them and when they
[49:09] were healed what was going on on his aim
[49:11] would be gone
[49:13] his aim would go back to normal amen so
[49:16] they believe that the gifts were of God
[49:18] they believe the ministry that ministry
[49:21] was of God but they were refused to
[49:23] accept his teaching a man and
[49:26] remembering of course as I had mentioned
[49:28] to you before that that a very popular
[49:31] and well-known evangelist did tell
[49:33] William Branham to stop preaching what
[49:36] he was preaching and and a prophet of
[49:39] God told the Evangelist he said brother
[49:41] somebody got to preach at the pastor's
[49:43] not doing it so he said I got to do it a
[49:45] man and so on but that that evangelist
[49:49] didn't agree with William Branham and
[49:51] what he was teaching and most
[49:53] evangelists didn't agree with William
[49:54] Branham and what he was teaching well I
[49:56] do thank God for and some of us do know
[49:59] and maybe if you got a man
[50:01] Marie our brother TL Osborn now I must
[50:04] say he had he had respect for brother
[50:07] Branham he did not agree with brother
[50:09] ran around a lot of things but he had
[50:11] respect for him a man so we I believe
[50:15] God will reward the brother for that for
[50:17] sure
[50:18] a man so the so thank God
[50:21] brother this is history for to a lot of
[50:24] people a man is history to us but thank
[50:27] God the word is not history the word
[50:30] what God did through this man is still
[50:32] in the present tense and what God is
[50:34] doing is still in the present tense
[50:36] because God is what God is dealing with
[50:39] his bride a man through what he did for
[50:43] true William Branham a man and there are
[50:47] there's many in the congregation here of
[50:49] course the building is full and there's
[50:51] many there of course that that I would
[50:54] maybe recognize if I look at them long
[50:56] enough that were preachers and
[50:59] evangelists back there in that day so
[51:02] thank God for the prophet a man and and
[51:06] remember again he his ministry was to
[51:10] the bride and also remember this he said
[51:14] we won't reach everyone with this
[51:16] message
[51:17] he said only the bride exactly but God
[51:23] has got others out there to preach to
[51:25] declare the word to the whole world
[51:27] because the bar business is going to go
[51:29] around the world they would receive a
[51:30] witness of the truth around the world
[51:32] and that's why it's in those magazines
[51:34] and on the radios and the televisions
[51:36] the talking about Jesus talking about
[51:39] this in the Bible that in the Bible
[51:41] talking about the Bible as well amen so
[51:44] it's the witness going around the world
[51:46] but the message and the messenger of the
[51:49] Malachi four it's only to the bride so
[51:52] you've got to be led by the time with
[51:54] leadership you got to be led by the
[51:56] Spirit regarding to whom you witness to
[51:59] a man you just adjust to the seat of God
[52:02] the elect of God Jesus didn't witness to
[52:05] everyone he just witnessed to the elect
[52:07] in his day a man and brother your sister
[52:09] you and I are witnessing to the election
[52:11] our day and especially of this age
[52:13] because
[52:14] he's going to climax with the
[52:16] resurrection and the rapture a man thank

[1:01:48] preacher instead of inspiration well we

[1:01:54] Amen praise the Lord
[1:01:57] so in 2nd Kurt in 2nd Timothy chapter 3
[1:02:01] and verse 1 familiar Scripture but it
[1:02:07] says this know also that in the last
[1:02:10] days perilous times shall come
[1:02:15] so we need only goes leadership in these
[1:02:21] perilous times for men it says shall be
[1:02:26] lovers of their own selves a man and
[1:02:30] they are their lovers are their own
[1:02:32] selves and their own knowledge and their
[1:02:34] own revelation oh there they they they
[1:02:38] are they'll lift themselves up they'll
[1:02:40] exalt themselves but brother if we got
[1:02:43] it in our hearts not in our heads we'll
[1:02:46] humble ourselves for men shall be lovers
[1:02:49] of their own selves covetous boasters
[1:02:53] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:03:00] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:03:06] affection trucebreakers false accusers
[1:03:11] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[1:03:19] that are good
[1:03:21] this is absolutely brother
[1:03:24] sister the description of the of this
[1:03:27] generation in this age a mayor it's not
[1:03:32] like it used to be this is the end it is
[1:03:37] finished and we'll give you another
[1:03:39] scripture to show you why that it's in
[1:03:42] this condition and it says traitors
[1:03:46] heady highminded lovers of pleasures
[1:03:52] more than lovers of God professing a
[1:03:57] love for God but they're lovers of
[1:04:00] pleasure more than lovers of God
[1:04:03] religious but not spiritual a man and it
[1:04:08] says they have a form of godliness a man
[1:04:13] but denying the power thereof many a
[1:04:18] believer as a form of godliness and
[1:04:20] denying the power of the Resurrection
[1:04:23] the power of the rapture a man that's
[1:04:26] why there's only going to be a few
[1:04:28] living Saints that will go in the
[1:04:31] rapture amen
[1:04:33] because they have a form of godliness
[1:04:35] but they are denying the power anything
[1:04:38] their brothers do you don't do is don't
[1:04:40] deny the power we need the power of the
[1:04:43] blood of Jesus that's the Holy Ghost by
[1:04:47] the grace of Almighty God repent and be
[1:04:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:04:55] the Holy Ghost a man by the very few
[1:04:58] that are truly repenting they have a
[1:05:02] form of godliness and they might go to a
[1:05:05] church a Mayan and but most today will
[1:05:08] stay away from the church and and just
[1:05:10] just going under the internet a man and
[1:05:13] try to use that as a as a as a
[1:05:15] justification for their faith a man the
[1:05:19] proto God's in no way he said in and III
[1:05:23] may be sure that quote with you to
[1:05:24] sometime
[1:05:25] if I can find it and he said he said
[1:05:28] we're don't care where you are and he
[1:05:30] said on a Sunday he said you don't go
[1:05:33] out a fish you don't go out and do this
[1:05:34] you don't go out and do
[1:05:35] that he said go to church he said
[1:05:38] wherever you are
[1:05:39] amen and then again you got believers
[1:05:42] that are allegedly almost same
[1:05:43] everywhere all over the Western world
[1:05:46] and maybe even even in the even in
[1:05:48] Africa or the other countries and and
[1:05:51] they and them one bother to go to church
[1:05:53] they don't have that burden they don't
[1:05:54] have that cry they don't have that
[1:05:56] hunger they don't have that search a man
[1:05:58] but if you're the seat of God and you
[1:06:00] got the Holy Ghost in your heart you
[1:06:02] want it a menu you want you wanna you
[1:06:05] want to go to church you want the
[1:06:07] fellowship you want to hear the word a
[1:06:08] man for the grace of God brother help us
[1:06:11] not just to have a form of godliness and
[1:06:14] deny the power but will be led by the
[1:06:17] power and you guys you got the Holy
[1:06:19] Ghost in your heart you're gonna be
[1:06:21] hanging and he's leading he's gonna need
[1:06:23] you to church he's gonna live avi a may
[1:06:26] not be a church all together might be a
[1:06:27] cottage meeting but well you will you're
[1:06:30] gonna you're gonna find out wherever you

[1:06:38] believers anymore if there's anything
[1:06:41] better that the see of God wants it
[1:06:44] wants fellowship anything the feet of
[1:06:46] God wants anyway want stir once wants to
[1:06:48] get any into worship and we're with
[1:06:51] believers talk about the Lord table the
[1:06:52] things of God a may rejoice over the
[1:06:55] over the resurrection and the render
[1:06:57] rapture a man what God has done and what
[1:07:01] God is doing hey man listen saints of
[1:07:03] God and we're ordained for the
[1:07:05] resurrection rapture we are we ought to
[1:07:07] be experiencing God every day in our
[1:07:08] lives
[1:07:09] amen praise the name of the Lord God in
[1:07:12] our minds God in our thoughts God in our
[1:07:14] souls God in our spirits oh thank you
[1:07:17] Jesus thank you Jesus a man you'll drop
[1:07:19] this song here drop that thought amen oh

[1:07:33] with you a man to fellowship he come
[1:07:36] with you sure there watch to bring us
[1:07:38] into the spirit of worship and it says
[1:07:41] in the last days concerning the perilous
[1:07:43] times they'll have a form of godliness
[1:07:45] but denying the power their love and it
[1:07:48] says
[1:07:49] such turn away no from such turn away
[1:07:55] the bride will be separated on to the
[1:07:58] Lord amen
[1:08:01] before the resurrection for the rapture
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:05] and it says again verse 6 for of this
[1:08:08] sort are they which crept into houses
[1:08:11] and led captive silly women laden with
[1:08:16] sins led away with divers lusts amen no
[1:08:22] wonder the Bible aghasura is a woman's
[1:08:24] world and what the women are like that's
[1:08:26] where the churches are like a man
[1:08:28] because the church is that the women
[1:08:30] train type the church that's right
[1:08:33] because we're out of it again he Jesus
[1:08:36] calls his brain a man and the and the
[1:08:40] earthly bride is going to be easy as
[1:08:42] United with the heavenly bridegroom a
[1:08:44] man from this sort are they which crept

[1:10:23] it says they are verse 7 they are ever
[1:10:26] learning and never able to come to the
[1:10:29] knowledge of the truth hey man the Bible
[1:10:33] says give wisdom but get understanding a
[1:10:35] man ever learning but never able to come
[1:10:39] to the knowledge of the truth ever
[1:10:42] learning they're learning what spiritual
[1:10:45] things religious things but not getting
[1:10:47] to the truth what God wants into to
[1:10:50] believe amazing brother we're living in
[1:10:54] that day we live in a tower ever
[1:10:56] learning never able to come to the
[1:10:58] knowledge and it's the correct and vital
[1:11:00] knowledge of the truth not just not a
[1:11:04] indolent electoral knowledge the correct
[1:11:06] and vital knowledge spiritual and as
[1:11:09] Janus and dreamers withstood Moses so do
[1:11:13] these also resist the truth medical up
[1:11:17] nines reprobate concerning the faith god
[1:11:22] bless his words you may be seated and
[1:11:24] those and maintained second Timothy
[1:11:27] chapter four and understanding that
[1:11:31] Janus and Jambres were Jews but they
[1:11:33] were withstood Moses amen and they were
[1:11:38] doing what was right in their own eyes
[1:11:40] but not following the leadership of God
[1:11:42] in the prophet Moses a man and there are
[1:11:46] those again today that are doing what's
[1:11:47] right in their own eyes but they're not
[1:11:49] following the leadership of God through
[1:11:51] them through the messenger of this hour
[1:11:53] and of this age and they're not
[1:11:55] following the leadership of gods for the
[1:11:56] fire the true rifle ministry there is a
[1:11:59] false rifle ministry and there is a true
[1:12:02] fifl ministry a my answers make sure
[1:12:05] that we're under a member of the true
[1:12:07] faithful ministry that is pointing us to
[1:12:10] the word getting us into the word to
[1:12:13] strain with the word
[1:12:14] and what is it it is the revelation that
[1:12:17] he that is going to be focused on the
[1:12:20] resurrection and the rapture as Luther's
[1:12:23] was focused on justification Wesley was
[1:12:25] focused on sanctification and then the
[1:12:28] Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:30] Ghost and the games but now we're
[1:12:32] focused on the resurrection and the
[1:12:34] rapture amen and as nigel being focused
[1:12:37] on this doctrine or the doctrine the
[1:12:39] Surrency or the other oneness of the god
[1:12:42] it and because they put the emphasis on
[1:12:44] that and they preach it and they preach
[1:12:46] it and they preach it but brother that's
[1:12:48] judge that's just getting us from here
[1:12:50] to there that's getting us out of the
[1:12:52] church how do they out of a
[1:12:53] denominational real world because Lola
[1:12:56] they're false and they have false
[1:12:58] teachings and they are false this and
[1:13:00] false that but you know the prophet of
[1:13:02] God had the truth and they will come out
[1:13:04] and go to a church this preaching the
[1:13:06] message of the Prophet amen
[1:13:08] but they're all there do all they're
[1:13:10] doing is they're learning the letter of
[1:13:12] the word but they're not getting into
[1:13:14] the faith of the word then I get into
[1:13:16] the revelation the faith that God has
[1:13:18] ordained in the message of the hour and
[1:13:21] it is to give us resurrection and

[1:22:11] the the Bible they don't believe the
[1:22:14] truth the whole truth and nothing but
[1:22:15] the truth
[1:22:16] anybody they'll believe this and believe
[1:22:19] that Plus and they'll add to it and
[1:22:23] they'll still explain it this way
[1:22:24] they'll interpret it this way amen but
[1:22:27] not all of it brother sister because
[1:22:30] they're there they'll they'll read the
[1:22:31] Bible
[1:22:32] skip that and they'll skip that oh you
[1:22:35] know I like that they're that rich
[1:22:37] Psalms but I mean they're going to read
[1:22:39] The Book of Daniel
[1:22:40] amen by the sister and oh yeah yeah
[1:22:45] they'll do they might read proverbs but
[1:22:47] not the book of that not not Isaiah and
[1:22:50] there might be another book that they'll
[1:22:52] read there but they're not going to not
[1:22:54] going to not going to read The Book of
[1:22:55] Jeremiah the weeping prophet amen
[1:23:00] and they'll skip this and skip that and
[1:23:03] brother the same thing with the revealed
[1:23:05] word and again we know that we got to
[1:23:07] take this and put it in air
[1:23:08] Amen so that it blends with look with
[1:23:11] the word of God the original trim amen
[1:23:14] and again as I said I said I might say
[1:23:18] you know a lot of believers
[1:23:19] you know when the one day when they got
[1:23:21] to get a book what they should do is
[1:23:22] that you started I have the last page
[1:23:24] yeah yeah because all they're interested
[1:23:28] in is signs and wonders so they'll start
[1:23:30] with it with the prayer line you know
[1:23:32] this one was the only discerned this he
[1:23:34] discerned that and so on or and then
[1:23:36] again there's a lot of the so-called
[1:23:38] believers that they were getting a read
[1:23:40] they'll read they are there that
[1:23:42] paragraph then they'll just I like the
[1:23:45] other one they'll skip that but it's not
[1:23:48] being registered in their heart anyway
[1:23:51] today they're getting they're getting
[1:23:53] the thoughts of it and the ideas of it
[1:23:55] in their minds but it's not as not going
[1:23:57] into the heart to give them the pain
[1:23:59] that God is looking for a man it gives
[1:24:02] them the faith to bring them out of the
[1:24:04] nomination condemned the nomination a
[1:24:06] man but again as the Prophet said you
[1:24:08] can be how do it and still a part of it
[1:24:11] because you've got to save the spirit of
[1:24:12] it
[1:24:13] amen I pray God in the name of the Lord
[1:24:16] that we don't have the spirit of what we
[1:24:19] come out of a man that we got the Holy
[1:24:22] Spirit we got the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:24:26] the emphasis is going to be the word the
[1:24:28] word the word the word they're going to
[1:24:30] forget what you come out of when it
[1:24:32] comes to the teaching any man and we're
[1:24:35] going to let God give you the new
[1:24:36] thoughts on the word the revealed word
[1:24:39] anybody they comes by hearing the word
[1:24:44] by hearing hearing by the word by the
[1:24:48] grace of God amen
[1:24:50] saying I that's how God leads us that's
[1:24:53] how a little Luther
[1:24:54] that's how he led Wesley that's how he
[1:24:56] laid all the others down through the
[1:24:58] ages amen
[1:24:59] you know the story of Luther going in
[1:25:01] and opened the Bible and it's all that
[1:25:03] one verse to just shall live by faith
[1:25:04] and he and he wrote down alone or only
[1:25:10] on the side I'm Dominic in E in the side
[1:25:13] of the Bible
[1:25:14] yeah amazing but you know what there was
[1:25:17] a time to do it and he took and he took
[1:25:20] such a stand for that day justification
[1:25:23] by faith that they were going to kill
[1:25:25] him oh yeah
[1:25:27] he was brought up before the council in
[1:25:30] the church there and and he said he said
[1:25:34] he's there I stand I can do no other and
[1:25:36] he said that he said the word says god
[1:25:38] said jesus said this is the word and I
[1:25:40] can do no other but believe the word
[1:25:42] anybody and they were going to kill him
[1:25:45] that's right but God had somebody there
[1:25:48] to take him and hide him away hey man
[1:25:51] praise the Lord but he but it didn't
[1:25:53] change his faith he still had the joy of
[1:25:55] justification Wesley had the joy of
[1:25:59] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:26:02] Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen
[1:26:07] they don't have that joy today the day
[1:26:09] they had back then not by any means now
[1:26:12] they're just cold and religious and it's
[1:26:17] your your wretched miserable and naked
[1:26:21] and so on and he said you say you're
[1:26:23] rich and increased with Goods than that

[1:27:56] she felt she could do it the Father God
[1:27:59] said no you can not dare because he knew
[1:28:01] what she didn't know a man because she

[1:29:10] on going and she was fighting to keep
[1:29:12] her balance hey man
[1:29:14] under Valley because of watch two shoes
[1:29:17] she was wearing she lost her balance and
[1:29:19] the prophet saw her fall over into the

[1:31:35] what he did 2,000 years ago
[1:31:37] anyway and that's why when he come back
[1:31:41] he kept asking Peter
[1:31:42] lovest thou me lovest thou me and twice
[1:31:45] he said agape love divine love and once
[1:31:48] when at the third time he said figlio

[1:32:05] love he got the raptures of of Agape

[1:34:36] life of Christ himself brother god help
[1:34:39] us
[1:34:39] amen by the grace of God not to have a
[1:34:43] form of godliness and deny the power to

[1:39:13] no power ever learning but never able to
[1:39:18] come to the knowledge of the truth the
[1:39:22] correct and vital knowledge of the truth
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:25] is because of the leadership anointing
[1:39:28] that they're under and in 2nd Timothy
[1:39:32] chapter 4 verse 1 I charge thee
[1:39:35] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[1:39:38] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[1:39:41] dead at his appearing and his kingdom

[1:40:19] your feelings go by your faith a man oh
[1:40:24] I don't feel like this I don't feel like
[1:40:26] that what you're not going by feeling
[1:40:29] you're going by faith hey man that's why
[1:40:33] you got to walk in the spirit live in
[1:40:37] the spirit so that it's the Holy Ghost
[1:40:39] controlling you and not your feelings
[1:40:41] and or your senses hey man that's right
[1:40:44] but there's too many brother you just
[1:40:47] watch how they act and react to this and
[1:40:50] this and this all that shows that that
[1:40:53] shows that dirt dirt dirt you're walking
[1:40:54] by they're by the flesh but they're not
[1:40:57] walking in the spirit he not led by the
[1:41:00] spirit see it's like it's like the man
[1:41:03] one time that the prophet of God I know
[1:41:05] elderly man and he was talking to him
[1:41:07] about certain thing and he wasn't a
[1:41:10] Christian at the time but the prophet of
[1:41:12] God was bringing out some things there
[1:41:14] to him and it wasn't very I Lee what we
[1:41:19] call spiritual but the prodigal was
[1:41:21] challenging him concerning what he
[1:41:24] believed and how he believed anyway what
[1:41:27] it did was he became a Christian he
[1:41:30] humbled himself acknowledging his need
[1:41:32] of Jesus oh whatever the Prophet said to
[1:41:37] him he realized on a sinner in need of
[1:41:41] salvation and he got saved and some time
[1:41:47] later the prophet of God met a woman I
[1:41:49] don't know if it is his wife for a
[1:41:51] daughter and she what she said she said
[1:41:54] you're William Branham yes he said oh
[1:41:57] I've got something to tell you she said
[1:42:00] about this man and so on all she said
[1:42:03] he's gone to be with the Lord but I
[1:42:05] wanted to tell you she said that when he
[1:42:08] was dying he raised his hands and he
[1:42:11] praised the Lord and he was worshiping
[1:42:13] God and he said right to the end the
[1:42:18] problem God's had always said that's
[1:42:20] exactly
[1:42:21] what should be anybody so that's the way
[1:42:24] it should be
[1:42:25] hey man brother if you got your
[1:42:28] consciousness let's let's give God the
[1:42:30] glory a man to God be the glory

[1:49:57] getting closer to it brother if we don't
[1:49:59] go soon we're going to be caught up into
[1:50:03] in the Great Tribulation because why
[1:50:06] we're bringing it might be here in this
[1:50:08] scripture right here yeah what's going
[1:50:11] on right now we're going with Jesus and
[1:50:14] the and the rest of the world is going
[1:50:17] with the devil you know it's coming
[1:50:21] under his control why because the devil
[1:50:24] comes down with great wrath knowing his
[1:50:27] time is short and that's that's into the
[1:50:30] Great Tribulation oh yeah he knows his
[1:50:35] time is short and the bride knows her
[1:50:38] time is short god help us
[1:50:43] I charge thee therefore before God in
[1:50:46] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge
[1:50:48] the quick and the dead at his appearing
[1:50:50] and his kingdom a man and we know that
[1:50:55] when he comes down she comes down with
[1:50:57] him his bride
[1:50:59] it's in the book of Revelation and it
[1:51:01] says preach the word preach the word be
[1:51:05] instant in season out of season reprove
[1:51:11] rebuke exhort with all long-suffering
[1:51:14] and doctrine amen for the time will come
[1:51:20] when they will not endure sound doctrine
[1:51:25] and that's the truth they want doctrine
[1:51:29] but not sound doctrine that's going to
[1:51:31] control them for the time will come when
[1:51:35] they will not endure sound doctrine but
[1:51:37] after their own last show they to
[1:51:39] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:51:43] amazing the devil's influence they're
[1:51:48] going to be led not by the true ministry
[1:51:50] but by a false ministry but God gave
[1:51:54] gave the promise in his words just bear
[1:51:57] with me I'll try not to be too much
[1:52:00] longer amen there's a reference here to
[1:52:08] the death yes when it comes to the
[1:52:16] ministry that God sits in among the
[1:52:19] people
[1:52:26] but it is not exactly the correct one
[1:52:29] that I had there they see where God
[1:52:38] promised a promise to Israel he said I
[1:52:41] will give you pastors after my own heart
[1:52:43] he said that will teach you knowledge
[1:52:45] and understanding a man pastors to teach
[1:52:50] you knowledge and understanding so it's
[1:52:55] not enough to get wisdom and to get
[1:52:57] knowledge get understanding so do you
[1:53:00] understand who you are do you understand
[1:53:02] what God has done and what God is doing
[1:53:03] now in your life amen it's more than
[1:53:06] coming in and just hear somebody talk
[1:53:09] about this and talk about that no
[1:53:11] brothers sister it's God talking to us
[1:53:15] through the ministry it's not the
[1:53:17] ministry it's God and I trust this the
[1:53:20] Lord not the devil but that were worn
[1:53:22] right here that the enemy the enemy also
[1:53:25] comes down in East preaching amen he
[1:53:28] said the time will come when they will
[1:53:29] not endure sound doctrine but after
[1:53:32] their own lusts shall they heap to
[1:53:33] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:53:37] a man and they shall turn away their
[1:53:41] ears from the truth and shall be turned
[1:53:44] unto fables amazing amazing so close it
[1:53:53] is they would deceive the very elect if
[1:53:55] possible it's what Jesus said but watch
[1:54:00] thou in all things endure afflictions
[1:54:05] amen we think because we're Christians
[1:54:08] oh we want had to put up with this one
[1:54:12] had to put up with that well all the way
[1:54:15] through scripture believers have to
[1:54:18] suffer and endure much tribulation amen
[1:54:24] God out but if you're to if you take
[1:54:26] your stand tribulation is going to
[1:54:29] follow god help us
[1:54:33] and it says we'll watch thou in all
[1:54:35] things endure afflictions do the work of
[1:54:40] an evangelist make full proof of thy
[1:54:42] ministry take your stand for the gospel
[1:54:45] for Christ amen don't go there preaching
[1:54:51] just to impress the people if you want
[1:54:55] to gloat impress anyone impress the Lord
[1:54:59] amen
[1:55:00] go there and preach the police Jesus not
[1:55:04] necessarily the people grace make full
[1:55:08] proof of thy ministry for I am now ready
[1:55:12] to be offered and the time of my
[1:55:14] departure II said is a tan a man he knew
[1:55:19] his time was coming amen
[1:55:22] turn with me to Revelation 12 and I'll
[1:55:36] try to bring it to a conclusion no I
[1:55:40] thought for sure I'd finish it but no
[1:55:44] not when you're getting to the scripture
[1:55:46] because you're going on and on and on
[1:55:48] this is just notes it's different but we
[1:55:52] want to follow the leadership of the
[1:55:53] Holy Ghost in Revelation chapter 12 and
[1:55:59] verse 10 and I heard a loud voice saying
[1:56:09] in heaven now is come salvation and
[1:56:13] strength and the Kingdom of our God and
[1:56:17] the power of his Christ for the accuser
[1:56:22] of our brethren is cast down the devil
[1:56:26] when we go up the devil comes down when
[1:56:32] the bride goes up and the bridegroom
[1:56:34] goes up the devil comes down in the
[1:56:37] Great Tribulation
[1:56:40] he said for the accuser of our brethren
[1:56:42] is cast down which accused them before
[1:56:45] our God day and night amen
[1:56:51] but it is finished amen
[1:56:55] Jesus on the cross that it is finished
[1:56:57] and it is in his Omega ministry it comes
[1:57:01] to a place in the bride it is finished
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:05] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:57:08] the Lamb and by the word of their
[1:57:10] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:57:12] unto death grace to us therefore rejoice
[1:57:19] ye heavens and ye that dwell in them
[1:57:24] wall to the inhabiters of the earth and
[1:57:27] of the sea for the devil is come down
[1:57:30] unto you having great wrath because he
[1:57:34] knoweth that he had but a short time and
[1:57:37] that's why that we are exceeding and
[1:57:40] experiencing in the world now perilous
[1:57:43] times and it's going to get worse
[1:57:46] because even talking to unbelievers they
[1:57:49] acknowledge that family is not like it
[1:57:52] used to be no no the relationship is
[1:57:57] just not there the love is not there
[1:57:58] like it used to be no why because the
[1:58:03] devil has come down with great wrath
[1:58:04] knowing his time is short that's why as
[1:58:09] the Bible says that they have a form of
[1:58:11] godliness and deny the power thereof a
[1:58:15] form of godliness the power is the devil
[1:58:18] but they're not they're denying the real
[1:58:21] true Holy Ghost power of Jesus but it's
[1:58:25] Jesus and Satan it's the bride and the
[1:58:28] church Jesus comes down to take the
[1:58:31] bride up into the rapture Satan is
[1:58:34] coming down a man to the Great
[1:58:37] Tribulation and the church is going to
[1:58:41] be martyred they lay down their lives in
[1:58:45] the Great Tribulation praise the name of
[1:58:49] the Lord that was the time in Revelation
[1:58:54] under the Somerton Church age where
[1:59:00] God's not to surrender Jade no it was
[1:59:03] the Philadelphia naitch and God said
[1:59:05] there's a time coming upon the earth
[1:59:07] that's gonna try try try those on the
[1:59:10] earth but he said I'll not he said but
[1:59:12] he said you won't go down for that he
[1:59:15] said yeah I won't cause you to do to
[1:59:17] witness that I won't cause you to
[1:59:19] experience that that's why he was going
[1:59:22] to he was going to take them into a
[1:59:23] resurrection rapture
[1:59:24] amen they elect the elect of God in
[1:59:27] every age are going into rapture they're
[1:59:31] going to be resurrected and and their
[1:59:33] loss in the bright age is gonna be right
[1:59:35] raptured with them by the grace of God
[1:59:38] always tremendous amen
[1:59:42] grace to us in this hour when the enemy
[1:59:45] has come down with great wrath and
[1:59:49] brother if there's anything we're
[1:59:50] witnessing is the great wrath of the
[1:59:53] devil but I trust that we have the
[1:59:57] revelation of the love of God the love
[2:00:01] of the bridegroom for his bride amen
[2:00:05] that we're going by the grace of God
[2:00:08] we're under his leadership the
[2:00:11] leadership of God not the leadership of
[2:00:13] the devil it's amazing that's that the
[2:00:16] world is under the leadership of Satan
[2:00:18] it's amazing that so many out there are
[2:00:21] following Satan's thoughts
[2:00:23] Satan's ideas but they want do one
[2:00:26] accept the ideas of our Lord Jesus
[2:00:28] Christ amen because it calls for a total
[2:00:33] separation from unbelief and they don't
[2:00:38] want that total separation there's a lot
[2:00:41] of professing believers today don't want
[2:00:43] that total separation no they feel they
[2:00:49] want friends they want company they want
[2:00:51] this they want that
[2:00:52] well the believers want Jesus he meant
[2:00:56] he's the one that comforts comforts the
[2:00:58] believers
[2:01:01] they finished with a couple of quotes
[2:01:03] here he said it was a time as in all
[2:01:12] times the people has never wanted God to
[2:01:16] lead them they want their own way of
[2:01:21] leadership and we're fighting that
[2:01:26] evening even and around the message you
[2:01:30] know how many are willing to say not my
[2:01:34] will father time be done God has
[2:01:37] ordained the ministry to lead you oh
[2:01:39] yeah prophet of God said you won't go
[2:01:42] any further than your pastor
[2:01:43] he said he's ordained to lead you
[2:01:45] through that's right
[2:01:49] you won't live any higher than your
[2:01:51] pastor the grace of God so he said as in
[2:01:56] all times that people he said never want
[2:01:59] a god to lead them they want their own
[2:02:02] way of leadership whether that was
[2:02:04] Cain's problem Cain says Satan Erica or
[2:02:08] God said Satan or Cain if you do what's
[2:02:11] right one won't you be accepted he
[2:02:14] wouldn't do it talking to God
[2:02:19] and he wouldn't do it and always he's
[2:02:25] gonna do this God said I'll set a mark
[2:02:26] on you that no man who killed you
[2:02:28] because he was afraid then after
[2:02:30] rejecting the word that he was going to
[2:02:32] be killed and God said I'll set a mark
[2:02:35] on you that no man will kill you a man
[2:02:38] how would the grace of God but again it
[2:02:41] was for a reason got a God at it for our
[2:02:44] purpose a man he said they want their
[2:02:49] own way of leadership that's right and
[2:02:52] this story this morning it was during
[2:02:55] this time he's in of the days of Samuel
[2:02:58] the man of God the Prophet and he had
[2:03:01] been a just man a good man honorable
[2:03:04] reputable true honest with the people
[2:03:07] never deceiving them and telling them
[2:03:09] nothing but straight thus saith the Lord
[2:03:13] they
[2:03:15] he said but the people that come to a
[2:03:18] place where they wanted to change this
[2:03:20] program and now they want to change the
[2:03:23] message that it's not just this and this
[2:03:29] now they're interpreting doctrines and
[2:03:31] they're turning this into a cult that
[2:03:33] into a cult and so on right and he said
[2:03:41] they had looked upon the Philistines the
[2:03:43] Amalekites the ammonites the Hittites
[2:03:45] and the other nations of the world they
[2:03:48] had seen that they had Kings that rule
[2:03:50] over them govern them guided them fought
[2:03:53] their battles and it seemed to be that
[2:03:55] Israel wanted to pattern themselves like
[2:03:58] these kings and these people God had
[2:04:02] Israel under the leadership of his
[2:04:03] prophets but Israel looking at the other
[2:04:06] nations wanted to be under the
[2:04:08] leadership of a key of a of a human King
[2:04:12] strain God God give them a king he said
[2:04:17] I'll let you choose the king and they
[2:04:20] did choose Saul yeah but again he he was
[2:04:27] gonna do what they wanted to him to do
[2:04:29] not what God wanted to do God told go do
[2:04:32] this go do this go do this but he feared
[2:04:36] the people and you got same thing today
[2:04:39] you got preachers that fear the people
[2:04:41] more than they fear God that's right
[2:04:44] god help us and the people want that
[2:04:49] people don't want that kind of that kind
[2:04:51] of a ministry just as Israel didn't want
[2:04:54] them to be led by the prophets Oh
[2:04:58] brothers sister got Elvis and he said
[2:05:02] this seems to be that Israel wanted to
[2:05:04] pattern themselves like these kings and
[2:05:07] like these people but he said it has
[2:05:10] never been in any age God's intention
[2:05:12] for his people to act like the people of
[2:05:14] the world or to be governing controlled
[2:05:17] like the people of the world God's
[2:05:19] people as always has been a peculiar
[2:05:22] people different people I called out a
[2:05:25] separated people and altogether
[2:05:27] different
[2:05:28] their actions different in their ways
[2:05:31] different in their manner of living than
[2:05:33] what the people of the world as they're
[2:05:36] advertised for the things and all that
[2:05:39] their makeup is is has been always
[2:05:41] contrary to the things that the people
[2:05:44] of the world desire and that is the
[2:05:47] absolute truth a man they don't he said
[2:05:52] they don't want to be separated they
[2:05:54] don't want to be peculiar or different
[2:05:59] in their actions their ways their manner
[2:06:02] of living no they want to be able to go
[2:06:05] nak like them and you know be friends
[2:06:08] with them and so on no no let's be let's
[2:06:12] be a friend of Jesus amen we pray grace
[2:06:19] by the grace of God will not do is Judas
[2:06:22] where Jesus who talked about betraying
[2:06:26] your friend and so on grace to us
[2:06:29] brother sister we'll get more of the of
[2:06:32] these things in in the next message amen
[2:06:35] the Lord willing and because again I
[2:06:38] wanted to finish this to continue with
[2:06:41] to do what brother Alec had suggested
[2:06:44] and to do what brother Matthew suggested
[2:06:46] and also for brother Matthew to have a
[2:06:48] testimony and our brother Chad as well
[2:06:51] so be in prayer that the Lord will help
[2:06:54] us amen well we just don't have enough
[2:06:58] time well maybe maybe we'll be at a time
[2:07:01] before we before before I finish it but
[2:07:04] I keep pointing you to an eternity a man
[2:07:07] so we don't need another message to
[2:07:10] point us to eternity we got that amen
[2:07:13] but just to highlight and and to break
[2:07:16] down some of the things that God has
[2:07:17] done and God is doing to what for what
[2:07:20] are we doing what are we here for now
[2:07:23] and hearing the word to is to increase
[2:07:25] our faith amen is to establish our faith
[2:07:29] so that we were firmly grounded in the
[2:07:32] revealed Word of God amen that we're
[2:07:35] firmly believing for the resurrection
[2:07:38] and the rapture amen
[2:07:41] and again let me tell you I understand
[2:07:44] they don't think you're gonna get you're
[2:07:47] gonna be cut up here in this dimension
[2:07:49] no no no we're gonna be cut into that
[2:07:52] other dimension and then all of us gonna
[2:07:55] be raptured up just with Jesus to meet
[2:07:58] the Lord in the air by the grace of God
[2:08:01] amen yeah what you talk about we're
[2:08:04] going the people are gonna want know
[2:08:07] there's going to be a rapture there's
[2:08:08] going to be that few goal they want know
[2:08:11] there that there was a rapture why
[2:08:13] because because it's just Oh
[2:08:17] in a moment between people die you're
[2:08:19] gonna be in this dimension then you're
[2:08:21] gonna be in theophany and the other
[2:08:23] dimension and then when you're in
[2:08:25] theophany and the other dimension with
[2:08:27] all the other saints that are gone on Oh
[2:08:28] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:08:31] you'll be changed into a glorified body
[2:08:33] and then the prophet of God said after a
[2:08:36] while he suggested that maybe we'll
[2:08:38] fellowship with one another then after a
[2:08:41] while and we look up and he'll be coming
[2:08:44] down and we'll and we are well then

[2:09:11] because there was a quote that I was
[2:09:14] going to share with you can what the
