[52:25] in a cave or whether we're gathered
[52:27] together virtually like this we are

[1:03:15] strange y'all looking at me up here and
[1:03:17] be looking at y'all out there but what I
[1:03:19] love is the Word of God is the same
[1:03:21] everywhere you go brother I made the
[1:03:23] statement like this he said the Word of
[1:03:25] God will defeat the devil any place any
[1:03:28] time under any circumstances and under
[1:03:31] these circumstances we can sir say amen
[1:03:33] to that and and I believe that with all
[1:03:35] of my heart now I want to say quickly
[1:03:37] before we turn in the Bible how much I
[1:03:39] enjoyed all that singing and Priscilla
[1:03:41] and a virgin and all y'all just gonna
[1:03:44] really enjoy the songs and enjoy
[1:03:46] listening I I turned my camera off and
[1:03:49] my mic off kindly almost to put myself
[1:03:51] in the back room in a way of looking at
[1:03:54] things but I've sure enjoyed the service
[1:03:56] thus far looking forward to what the
[1:03:58] Lord will speak to us here tonight
[1:04:00] hey man let's turn in the Bible if you
[1:04:01] got your Bible now let's go to Galatians
[1:04:03] chapter 4 and I want to pick up verse 1
[1:04:06] through 6 now was everybody listening
[1:04:10] online last night everybody get to hear
[1:04:12] the message last night all right
[1:04:14] wonderful well then we're gonna pick up
[1:04:17] a little bit on what we talked about
[1:04:18] last night and I want to use tonight for
[1:04:22] a subject and this is really kindly a
[1:04:24] part 2 or a follow-up to what I was
[1:04:26] bringing last night but I want to talk
[1:04:28] about sons of God with full power
[1:04:29] tonight and I want to talk about how all
[1:04:32] of this comes together now for a title I
[1:04:34] want to try to use if we can what is the
[1:04:38] Sun what is a Sun what is these Sun and
[1:04:41] we know that there is a V son who has
[1:04:43] brought forth many sons of God and we
[1:04:47] want to talk about that for a little
[1:04:48] while and bring together a little bit of
[1:04:50] understanding about what a son of God is
[1:04:52] now as I mentioned to you last night
[1:04:55] we're going to pick up in the book of
[1:04:57] Galatians so let's look now in Galatians
[1:05:00] chapter 4 verse 1 now let's read down
[1:05:03] through verse 6 if we can't just catch
[1:05:05] them 6 verses and then
[1:05:06] pray and ask the Lord to help us and
[1:05:08] then get right into the message quickly
[1:05:09] as we can hear now I say that at the air
[1:05:12] as long as he is a child differeth
[1:05:16] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:05:20] of all but is under tutors and governors
[1:05:23] until the time appointed of the Father
[1:05:27] now once you really notice that until
[1:05:29] the time appointed of the Father even so
[1:05:34] we now watch now when we were children
[1:05:37] were in bondage under the elements of
[1:05:40] the world but when the fullness of the
[1:05:44] time was come now you remember that last
[1:05:46] night in Ephesians chapter 1 that he
[1:05:48] said in the fullness of time God said
[1:05:50] forth a son all right not just a son but
[1:05:53] the son of course and then God sent
[1:05:55] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:05:59] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:06:02] the law that we might receive the
[1:06:05] adoption of sons and now here's the main
[1:06:09] thing we were driving that last night I
[1:06:11] want to pick it up again tonight and
[1:06:12] because she our sons all right God has
[1:06:15] made you sons God has sent forth the
[1:06:18] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:06:20] crying Abba Father in that wonderful
[1:06:23] let's let's pray over the word for just
[1:06:25] a moment if we can Heavenly Father we
[1:06:27] thank you now for the reading of the
[1:06:29] Bible we thank you for the saints of God
[1:06:32] in attendance Lord may you bless each
[1:06:34] one of them now that have come and
[1:06:36] gathered here over the Internet they've
[1:06:39] gathered at the church house different
[1:06:40] ones swapping out taking turns no doubt
[1:06:43] giving each one an opportunity to be in
[1:06:45] the house of the Lord
[1:06:46] gather there in the place where brother
[1:06:48] brems said angels of God dwell in those
[1:06:51] places and walk up down the aisles and
[1:06:52] one more and Lord we know sitting here
[1:06:55] whether we're in our living rooms or in
[1:06:57] our offices or wherever we might be we
[1:06:59] know that the presence of the Lord is
[1:07:01] here with us because you promised that
[1:07:03] you'd be here gathered around your word
[1:07:05] and around your children and even the
[1:07:07] angels of God are encamped about those
[1:07:09] that fear them so we don't have to worry
[1:07:11] Lord about whether we're in a church or
[1:07:13] out of a church you promised you'd be
[1:07:15] here and here you are now lord I pray
[1:07:17] you take your word so
[1:07:18] and that you would anoint me to speak
[1:07:20] that which you'd want to be delivered to
[1:07:22] the children of God tonight and that
[1:07:24] you'd open up every heart that they'd be
[1:07:26] able to receive that which was spoken
[1:07:28] unto them tonight and all the things
[1:07:30] that you'll say to us we want to commit
[1:07:32] this service and all the remainder of it
[1:07:35] I want to thank you for what's been
[1:07:37] accomplished thus far and thank you for
[1:07:38] what you've done
[1:07:39] amen in the singing and all the other
[1:07:41] little parts Lord that we are so
[1:07:43] grateful to you about we pray the Holy
[1:07:46] Spirit will come tonight now and anoint
[1:07:48] this word that we can receive it as we
[1:07:51] commit it to your Lord both speaker and
[1:07:53] listener in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:07:55] all the saints of God said amen amen
[1:07:57] hallelujah glory to God praise the Lord
[1:07:59] and thank you Jesus amen if you can get
[1:08:01] all that in good for you amen god bless
[1:08:03] you you could be seated
[1:08:04] amen greetings to the invisible audience
[1:08:06] tonight those that are hooked up by the
[1:08:08] way of the stream and greetings to the
[1:08:10] Saints I'm looking at several of you now
[1:08:12] and I'm going to have to be careful with
[1:08:14] this son's preaching I'm looking at a
[1:08:16] lot of daughters sitting in that room
[1:08:17] right there tonight and thankful for the
[1:08:21] daughters of God and I want you to
[1:08:22] remember that when we talk about sons
[1:08:24] we're also preaching about the daughters
[1:08:27] of God as well but now the Bible always
[1:08:29] has a tendency to address sons as we
[1:08:32] know the male is always identified first
[1:08:37] in the way that he puts it because Adam
[1:08:40] of course is the head over the woman so
[1:08:42] a lot of times the Bible to adjust the
[1:08:44] male but that doesn't exclude the female
[1:08:46] but it just just God's way of addressing
[1:08:49] the church he always speaks to the
[1:08:51] leaders of the church and then the
[1:08:52] leaders are to communicate that vision
[1:08:53] on down amen to the family to the wives
[1:08:57] to the sisters and want more so this
[1:08:59] puts you right in there with us sis on
[1:09:01] this whole thing that we're talking
[1:09:02] about here tonight now I've got a lot of
[1:09:05] hay on the fork and I'm not going to get
[1:09:06] no hurry tonight and you're settled in
[1:09:08] with me and I got books and things
[1:09:09] laying here all over my little office
[1:09:11] desk and chair and all this around here
[1:09:13] and I'm just thankful to God in one way
[1:09:17] that I'm not there tonight because I
[1:09:19] guarantee you ain't got enough room for
[1:09:20] me to preach up here with all I got with
[1:09:22] all this here
[1:09:22] amen right there tonight but I've made
[1:09:25] myself a little Pentecostal shopping
[1:09:27] room here tonight so I'm a little less
[1:09:28] crampin when I was last night and
[1:09:30] ready to go so we're thankful for that
[1:09:32] now and reading this in Galatians now I
[1:09:35] want you to kind of get a picture in
[1:09:36] your mind if you can about what Paul is
[1:09:38] trying to describe to us because now
[1:09:40] remember Paul is the messenger that is
[1:09:43] going to take the Old Testament he's
[1:09:46] going to take all of the laws and the
[1:09:49] washing of the pots and the pans that we
[1:09:51] talked about last night and now he's
[1:09:52] going to try to bridge the gap between
[1:09:54] this old and this new and being that
[1:09:57] he's the first messenger of God for the
[1:09:59] Gentile people now he's going to try to
[1:10:01] take all of those good things that God
[1:10:03] wants to remain from the past and bring
[1:10:05] them and position them over here now
[1:10:08] there's going to be certain things
[1:10:09] that's gonna come to it's expiration
[1:10:11] date and there's gonna be certain things
[1:10:13] it's going to go so far and then God's
[1:10:15] gonna cut it off for example the
[1:10:17] sacrifice will be cut off once and once
[1:10:20] and for all in the sacrifice of the Lord
[1:10:22] Jesus Christ and now that the Lord Jesus
[1:10:24] has been crucified the blood has run out
[1:10:27] of his body and separated his earthly
[1:10:29] life now death burial and resurrection
[1:10:31] now there is no more need for a lamb or
[1:10:34] a bullock or a ram or any of these other
[1:10:36] things as a matter of fact when Israel
[1:10:39] receives their atonement coming up here
[1:10:41] in a little while they will not receive
[1:10:43] the atonement by the red heifer or by
[1:10:45] the blood sacrifices of animals but the
[1:10:48] true hundred and forty-four thousand
[1:10:50] will realize that the true atonement was
[1:10:53] the death of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:55] remember what he said in Zechariah he'll
[1:10:57] present himself to them and they'll ask
[1:10:59] where did you get them scars in the
[1:11:01] house of my friends then they'll realize
[1:11:02] after Moses and Elijah preached it to
[1:11:05] them for a little while about what took
[1:11:07] place and what the real true sacrifice
[1:11:09] is now we know what they're going to do
[1:11:11] they're going to set up a temple and
[1:11:12] they're going to do all these other
[1:11:13] things and have the red heifer and all
[1:11:15] of that but the heifer is not their true
[1:11:17] atonement the Lord Jesus is their true
[1:11:19] atonement and when they recognize that
[1:11:22] then they will recognize what it means
[1:11:24] to be then a born-again Christian and
[1:11:27] remember they'll be sealed in one hour
[1:11:30] now Paul is trying to get all of this
[1:11:32] over from the old end of the New
[1:11:34] Testament and it's going to take about
[1:11:36] 2,000 years or more to be able to get
[1:11:39] the entire Gentile body position to get
[1:11:42] every Son of God in their rightful place
[1:11:43] to get the entire Gentile mystery
[1:11:46] expressed in the opening of the seven
[1:11:48] seals and then the as we'd say the icing
[1:11:51] on the cake with Israel coming into
[1:11:52] their position at the end so Paul has a
[1:11:55] very important job and that job is to
[1:11:58] establish for the people of God what
[1:12:00] that is going to look like what a son is
[1:12:03] supposed to look like all right now if
[1:12:05] you got your Bible there let's let's go
[1:12:08] back now and I just want to look at
[1:12:09] first Corinthians chapter three let's
[1:12:11] pick up verse 21 and I just want to read
[1:12:14] just backtrack just a little tiny
[1:12:16] itty-bitty bit just to catch a word or
[1:12:18] two of some of the things we left off
[1:12:20] with last night and and brother Matt
[1:12:23] just checking in we're doing all right
[1:12:24] with sound and everything correct
[1:12:26] everything looking all right all right
[1:12:27] just I've got my phone here if you need
[1:12:29] to contact me holler at me right real
[1:12:31] quickly and we'll make sure that we get
[1:12:33] everything just exactly where you can
[1:12:35] hear the message because that's the main
[1:12:37] thing even if this camera shuts off and
[1:12:39] and and you don't see me no more amen if
[1:12:42] it went completely black hear the
[1:12:44] message don't look at the messenger of
[1:12:45] anyway that's not the main thing look at
[1:12:47] the message alright first Corinthians
[1:12:49] chapter 3 verse 21 now 21 22 23 now
[1:12:53] remember what we read last night that
[1:12:55] God wants to put all things into the
[1:12:58] hands of sons members sister I'm talking
[1:13:00] to y'all as well
[1:13:01] amen he said therefore let no man glory
[1:13:03] in men for all things hour yours see
[1:13:08] hour yours whether Paul Apollo's Cephas
[1:13:12] or the world or life of death of things
[1:13:15] present or things to come all are yours
[1:13:19] and ye are Christ's and Christ is God's
[1:13:24] now he's identifying that the sons and
[1:13:27] the daughters as well now but the sons
[1:13:29] are in full possession of everything God
[1:13:32] is now let's use a little remark it
[1:13:34] brother Branham made to bring that in a
[1:13:36] little bit clearer
[1:13:37] remember the prophets said all that God
[1:13:39] was he poured it into Christ and all
[1:13:41] that Christ was huh then he poured it
[1:13:44] into the church so everything God was
[1:13:46] everything God had was then poured into
[1:13:49] the body of Jesus Christ who was the
[1:13:51] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:13:53] and now
[1:13:54] all of that is being poured into you and
[1:13:56] I now if we are then to come into full
[1:14:00] possession of everything that God wants
[1:14:03] for us then all right what's the process
[1:14:05] how are we supposed to get there Here I
[1:14:07] am at point a and I need to be at point
[1:14:09] B well how am I supposed to get there
[1:14:11] all right now Paul begins to identify
[1:14:13] for us there in Galatians again that he
[1:14:16] said we are as a pair if you look in
[1:14:19] there Galatians 4:1 that as an air as
[1:14:21] long as he is a child now watch this now
[1:14:24] he differs nothing from a servant though
[1:14:28] he be Lord of all now why is that
[1:14:31] because the Apostle Paul is telling us
[1:14:33] that there's gonna have to be some
[1:14:36] training involved in order for this son
[1:14:39] to be able to take it all he has to
[1:14:42] prove himself to be of the right kind of
[1:14:45] seed all that understand that say Amen
[1:14:47] one time even you and the invisible
[1:14:49] audience you you say Amen as well
[1:14:51] sitting there in your living room
[1:14:52] everywhere you are amen and and allow
[1:14:54] yourself to just kind of absorb that
[1:14:56] thought for just a moment so in order
[1:14:58] for him to prove he's the seed it's
[1:15:00] going to take some time anybody ever
[1:15:02] plant a garden put your seeds in the
[1:15:04] ground take a look at those seeds laying
[1:15:07] in there and and say well praise the
[1:15:09] Lord I got tomatoes potentially you do
[1:15:11] praise the Lord I got carrots coming
[1:15:13] potentially you do but you really don't
[1:15:16] know what they are until it's some time
[1:15:18] has passed and they've grown up and now
[1:15:20] they're beginning to express what they
[1:15:22] are for those of you that are Facebook
[1:15:25] buddies with me I I we planted some
[1:15:28] carrots last year they never come up and
[1:15:30] would you know at the beginning of the
[1:15:32] growing season this year you probably
[1:15:33] saw the picture of it that we got great
[1:15:35] big old bunches of purple carrots that
[1:15:37] had come up right at the growing season
[1:15:39] and those carrots had laid in that
[1:15:41] ground all through summer last year all
[1:15:43] through fall all through winter through
[1:15:45] almost the beginning of the of spring
[1:15:48] nearly and all of a sudden we went out
[1:15:49] there to pull weeds and when we got out
[1:15:51] there to pull the weeds there was a big
[1:15:53] bunch of carrot heads sticking right out
[1:15:54] of the carrot top sticking right out of
[1:15:55] the ground now that seed took some time
[1:15:58] to prove what it was so we say that were
[1:16:02] sons of God we say that were daughters
[1:16:04] of God but remember
[1:16:05] my friends it takes time to prove what
[1:16:09] it is it's laying inside of you hey man
[1:16:11] stay with me just a little while and
[1:16:12] let's look at a couple of things now
[1:16:14] watch your again he said though he'd be
[1:16:16] a child he differs nothing from a
[1:16:19] servant in other words he's got to prove
[1:16:21] exactly what is all about
[1:16:24] he is under tutors and governors until
[1:16:27] the time appointed of the Father now we
[1:16:29] all aware of what brother bream said and
[1:16:31] how he said that when it come to these
[1:16:34] type of things like this he talked about
[1:16:36] how that a tutor would be set over that
[1:16:38] son remember the adoption when he
[1:16:40] started talking about the behavior of
[1:16:41] that boy and he'd say how would he act
[1:16:43] and how would he do and and if he did
[1:16:45] right then he was a chip off the old
[1:16:47] block and if he didn't the father would
[1:16:49] hang his head and disappointment and
[1:16:50] hang his head in shame well now we find
[1:16:53] the same thing taking place for you and
[1:16:56] I as children of God now we say were
[1:16:59] bribed we say were the elect we say were
[1:17:02] mrs. Jesus Christ but I want you to
[1:17:04] listen to me church it's gonna take some
[1:17:06] time to prove that that don't come right
[1:17:09] away when you first get saved and you
[1:17:12] first give your heart to the Lord you
[1:17:14] got to give it some time to let the seed
[1:17:16] begin to develop a little bit to produce
[1:17:18] exactly what it's supposed to produce to
[1:17:21] show what it's all about now I want to
[1:17:25] read to you from spoken words original
[1:17:26] seed here and I'm picking up page 23
[1:17:29] here now listen what brother Branham
[1:17:30] said and I I like this I don't usually
[1:17:32] get to pack my books around with me when
[1:17:34] I travel but I'm getting a read out of a
[1:17:36] book tonight this is old fashioned young
[1:17:38] people you may not this is called a book
[1:17:39] I don't know if you ever seen one before
[1:17:40] but a mint they used to be popular how
[1:17:43] to hook you
[1:17:43] hallelujah you can't swipe him now and
[1:17:45] they don't swipe it you got to turn the
[1:17:47] page and everything but anyhow that's
[1:17:49] how that goes now watch her brother been
[1:17:51] sitting on the most start page 22 and
[1:17:53] then come over a little bit brother BAM
[1:17:54] said Jesus now watch Jesus is the word
[1:17:57] made manifest he and the word is one in
[1:18:01] the same this is paragraph 144 if you'd
[1:18:03] like to look at later and that's why it
[1:18:05] was so manifest in him so perfectly now
[1:18:08] that's the reason God manifested so
[1:18:12] perfectly in Jesus because he was the
[1:18:16] seed word the germ were
[1:18:18] itself oh I like that they meant the
[1:18:21] German word itself the germ that's
[1:18:23] inside the seed the life that's in the
[1:18:26] seed who said you get it he said he was
[1:18:28] the germ word of God and the germ is the
[1:18:31] spirit the germ is the water and Jesus
[1:18:35] had to be broken open there in order for
[1:18:38] that seed to let forth its life the
[1:18:40] water other seed that was coming oh my
[1:18:42] don't you see it the congregation said a
[1:18:44] man he said even other sheep that's not
[1:18:47] of this fold I have jesus said they're
[1:18:49] gonna see that see they're gonna get
[1:18:51] that word and stay right with it I hope
[1:18:53] that's what me and you were doing right
[1:18:54] now we're making this quote live I hope
[1:18:56] and believe in trust that we're getting
[1:18:58] it we're getting that word and staying
[1:19:00] right with it he said I'm sending forth
[1:19:02] the spirit to water it and it will
[1:19:05] produce just exactly watch now it'll
[1:19:08] produce miracles it'll produce the power
[1:19:10] of God it'll produce and it will not
[1:19:13] deny anything because it's a kindred
[1:19:16] seed with the sea amen so then we see
[1:19:20] that Jesus was the seed of God made
[1:19:23] manifest and made reference to Galatians
[1:19:25] again last night where Paul said that
[1:19:27] Jesus was the seed remember talking
[1:19:30] about the bond woman she had a son and
[1:19:32] Ishmael which was a wild man a bush man
[1:19:36] and just even today the Arabs over there
[1:19:38] you can't tame them you can't do nothing
[1:19:40] with them amen and then you have Isaac's
[1:19:42] line which was not the true seed
[1:19:44] promised of God but it was the natural
[1:19:46] seed promised remember
[1:19:48] neither one shall be heir to the other
[1:19:51] but then the spiritual seed of Abraham
[1:19:54] remember there were three sons Ishmael
[1:19:56] Isaac and Jesus Jesus was the spiritual
[1:20:00] son that was promised to Abraham not of
[1:20:04] seeds plural Paul said but a sea in
[1:20:07] other words he was the true German word
[1:20:10] see now we hear people talking about the
[1:20:13] seed of God inside of them and I'm born
[1:20:15] with a seed and all this now I believe
[1:20:17] in that to an extent but what we have to
[1:20:18] be careful of is we have to be sure that
[1:20:21] when we're saying such things that were
[1:20:23] not saying it incorrectly I do believe
[1:20:25] that God plays a germ of life inside
[1:20:28] every believer that will come to eternal
[1:20:31] life
[1:20:32] that but that seed now watch now was not
[1:20:34] placed in your flesh it was not placed
[1:20:37] in your bloodstream it was not placed in
[1:20:39] your genetics or your DNA or your
[1:20:41] genetic code but that seed was in Jesus
[1:20:44] Christ laying there dormant waiting for
[1:20:47] manifestation until you took the breath
[1:20:50] of life and came to the saving knowledge
[1:20:51] of Jesus Christ and received the baptism
[1:20:53] of the holy ghost that seed word was in
[1:20:57] Christ will you say he dropped it into
[1:20:58] me might have done it I won't disagree
[1:21:00] that when you was a baby crawling on the
[1:21:02] floor that there was a life hiding in
[1:21:04] there somewhere but remember that seed
[1:21:06] what in your flesh because if it was in
[1:21:08] flesh if it come by the genetic code if
[1:21:11] it come by passing of grandfathers and
[1:21:13] grandmothers and all that amen now we're
[1:21:15] talking about a natural seed line but
[1:21:17] remember Christ was not after the
[1:21:19] natural line but after the spiritual
[1:21:22] line I'll ask you a question who was the
[1:21:24] father of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:26] God was his father amen and God is a
[1:21:28] spirit and we must worship Him in spirit
[1:21:31] and truth somebody running around saying
[1:21:33] glory to god i'm predestinated the seat
[1:21:35] of gods placed in me yeah but what
[1:21:37] they're talking about is they're talking
[1:21:39] about something inside their flesh that
[1:21:41] makes them superior to somebody else I
[1:21:43] Got News for You friends
[1:21:45] this old tabernacle that you live in
[1:21:47] this whole body that you live in it is
[1:21:49] just as sinful as every other person
[1:21:51] walking on the face of this planet
[1:21:52] that's not the thing that makes you
[1:21:55] predestinated this is why brother
[1:21:57] Branham said that it isn't the person
[1:21:59] that comes predestinated by God but it
[1:22:02] is that life or that seed or that germ
[1:22:05] that is in Jesus Christ that is
[1:22:08] predestinated to be what it is amen am i
[1:22:11] preaching that faster you listen in that
[1:22:12] slow which one is it Amen all right now
[1:22:14] now I'm gonna pack it all in and don't
[1:22:16] forget you know when we bring these
[1:22:18] things in you can understand why the
[1:22:20] Bible taught us that it was one Sun
[1:22:23] bringing many sons into repentance all
[1:22:28] right let me just let me just stop right
[1:22:29] there for just a moment one Sun bringing
[1:22:33] many sons and repentance all right look
[1:22:34] here at a good type of this when you
[1:22:36] pick this up in First Samuel chapter 16
[1:22:38] verse 11 if you want to write this down
[1:22:40] it's 11 12 and 13
[1:22:42] so first same as 16 11 through 13 Samuel
[1:22:45] said to Jesse
[1:22:46] and here are all my children of course
[1:22:48] he's looking for David to come don't
[1:22:49] know he's looking for David but he's
[1:22:51] looking for David he said there remains
[1:22:52] the youngest and he keeps the Sheep and
[1:22:54] Samuel said to Jesse fetch you alright
[1:22:57] he said when he brought him in he was
[1:22:58] ruddy and with a love a beauty count
[1:23:00] countenance and goodly to look at in
[1:23:02] other words he was handsome amen and and
[1:23:05] the Lord said arise anoint him for this
[1:23:09] is he then Samuel takes the Horn of oil
[1:23:11] and he anoints David in the midst of his
[1:23:15] brethren now watch the Spirit of the
[1:23:17] Lord came upon David from that day forth
[1:23:20] now watch how brother Brandon types this
[1:23:23] anointing upon David this is the message
[1:23:25] called the great warrior David in 1955
[1:23:27] he said now what does the oil represent
[1:23:29] in the Bible the Holy Spirit he said
[1:23:31] when he poured that oil upon him he
[1:23:34] baptized him with the Holy Spirit in
[1:23:36] semble form he said oh I hope you get
[1:23:39] that that come fresh he poured the oil
[1:23:41] upon him and it went all over him the
[1:23:43] whole Horn of oil full of it not
[1:23:45] sparingly he said that's the way God
[1:23:47] pours the Holy Spirit on man not
[1:23:50] sparingly just baptizes him into it
[1:23:53] anointing him with the spirit he said
[1:23:56] notice he right then when that anointing
[1:23:58] struck him he was positionally placed as
[1:24:02] a king alright don't fail that now you
[1:24:06] are / you are placed positionally in
[1:24:09] Christ Jesus as kings and priests he
[1:24:12] says that right the moment you receive
[1:24:14] the Holy Spirit
[1:24:15] God places you in the kingdom and air
[1:24:19] what a beautiful picture there you are
[1:24:21] see God placed you in the kingdom as an
[1:24:24] heir that's right
[1:24:25] remember if you pick up Psalm chapter 1
[1:24:27] now and you go to look at what he said
[1:24:29] about that tree planted by the rivers of
[1:24:31] living water
[1:24:32] remember that seed was positionally
[1:24:34] placed by the rivers of living water but
[1:24:37] in order for that seed to become a full
[1:24:40] heir of everything that laid inside of
[1:24:43] it it took time it took time for it to
[1:24:45] grow it took time for it to develop so
[1:24:48] then Paul tells us we are placed under
[1:24:50] tutors under governors those that can
[1:24:53] train us those that can teach us those
[1:24:55] that can instruct us glory to God until
[1:24:58] can come into the full inheritance of
[1:25:00] the sons of God oh it's the perfect you
[1:25:04] got your shouting shoes on tonight I
[1:25:05] hope so because well we getting in some
[1:25:07] deep water here and you may need to
[1:25:08] shout a little bit
[1:25:09] amen amen to wait on through it alright
[1:25:12] now if he was positionally placed then
[1:25:14] as the king remember at the very moment
[1:25:17] that that anointing oil falls on David
[1:25:19] remember he is not the king of Israel at
[1:25:22] that moment but as far as God is
[1:25:25] concerned all of the potentials is
[1:25:27] laying right there and David right at
[1:25:29] that very moment oh it's just as perfect
[1:25:33] as it can be alright now watch it again
[1:25:34] in adoption where the man said now
[1:25:36] little David he said what did he do he
[1:25:38] took that slingshot
[1:25:39] he said grab that little lion now the
[1:25:41] lion's mouth he said think of it went
[1:25:43] after that lion and got the lamb he said
[1:25:46] who in the world would do that tell me a
[1:25:48] man in here that would do that raise up
[1:25:49] your hand East I'll tell you quick your
[1:25:51] home is they didn't see me put mine up
[1:25:53] he said I wouldn't he said I wouldn't go
[1:25:55] after him with a 36 army but he went
[1:25:58] after him with the slingshot little
[1:25:59] piece of leather like at two strings
[1:26:01] around it winding around
[1:26:03] he said because when it come time for
[1:26:04] Goliath to make his boast he went after
[1:26:06] Goliath he said the God of heaven has
[1:26:08] let me deliver out of the mouth of the
[1:26:10] lion out of the mouth of the bear all
[1:26:12] right it was the power of God that went
[1:26:15] with him amen are you catching that it
[1:26:19] was the power of God that went with him
[1:26:21] all right let's refer to last night just
[1:26:23] a moment why was the anointing on David
[1:26:26] why was the anointing oil on him in the
[1:26:29] first place as a king because he was a
[1:26:32] son oh don't miss that church don't miss
[1:26:36] that little bride because he was a son a
[1:26:39] chosen son he the anointing could fall
[1:26:43] upon him to produce these powerful acts
[1:26:47] of God
[1:26:48] because he was the son why do you think
[1:26:51] healing and miracles and all these great
[1:26:53] things accompanied the people of God it
[1:26:55] is because they are the bride of Jesus
[1:26:58] Christ and because they are the bride
[1:27:00] then it can accompany their walk with
[1:27:03] God see and that's what we see today we
[1:27:06] God's got some David sticking around he
[1:27:09] said yes sir this feed and father's
[1:27:10] sheep
[1:27:11] once in awhile or two
[1:27:12] a cancer something will Chuck plum out
[1:27:14] of the hands of the doctor that won't
[1:27:16] stop that David he'll go right out there
[1:27:18] after that big fellow with a slingshot
[1:27:19] ask me anything in my name it would be
[1:27:21] given I don't care you said doctors can
[1:27:23] laugh everybody else could make fun him
[1:27:25] he'll go after him anyhow bringing that
[1:27:27] sheet back to the fold yes sir it's
[1:27:29] God's child take your hand off of it he
[1:27:32] said that's right knock this line down
[1:27:33] line rows up he grabbed you by the beard
[1:27:35] and killed him a little bit you're ready
[1:27:36] boy probably paid weighed rather 80 or
[1:27:40] 90 pounds just a little bitty old fella
[1:27:43] but why did these things happen why were
[1:27:46] they taking place what was the purpose
[1:27:48] of it because David was an anointed son
[1:27:52] don't miss that out there amen and you
[1:27:55] that are listening online out there in
[1:27:57] this submissive alliance I want you to
[1:27:58] make you a note write it down each one
[1:28:00] of you write it down the reason God is
[1:28:02] gonna bless me is because I am his son
[1:28:06] the reason the anointing of the hour
[1:28:09] follows me is because I am his child you
[1:28:12] ought to write that down and read that
[1:28:14] to yourself every morning afternoon and
[1:28:16] night at least 3 or 400 times a day the
[1:28:19] reason I can be a concur the reason I'll
[1:28:22] have victory glory is because I am a
[1:28:26] child of God oh I hope that lays right
[1:28:29] in your lap naplan how could you say bad
[1:28:32] things happen sure they're gonna happen
[1:28:34] this David was anointed but he still had
[1:28:36] lions in his life and depending on how
[1:28:40] deep south you get that line kind of
[1:28:42] sounds like a lion ly ing you still got
[1:28:47] some of them kind of things in your life
[1:28:48] sure you will lion bandes well we just
[1:28:51] say I've been waiting all this time sure
[1:28:53] but keep on waiting you're an anointed
[1:28:55] child you're an anointed child how do
[1:28:57] you know these things aren't given for a
[1:28:59] purpose behind oh you sets a good
[1:29:01] cop-out yes I know yes I know it's easy
[1:29:03] to say well troubles gonna come it comes
[1:29:06] to the center that's true but the
[1:29:08] difference between a child of God going
[1:29:09] through problems and a sinner going
[1:29:11] through problems is the center is not
[1:29:13] anointed to overcoming
[1:29:16] they're not anoint the Whippet and you
[1:29:20] don't always have to necessarily be free
[1:29:22] from it to overcome it I want you to
[1:29:24] think about something just a moment
[1:29:26] whatever David sat there in that pasture
[1:29:29] out there watching his father's sheep he
[1:29:31] might have killed one line but there was
[1:29:32] hundreds of them that was roaming around
[1:29:33] all the time the threat was constantly
[1:29:37] looming over faith responsibility
[1:29:42] he was constantly dealing with an issue
[1:29:45] constantly dealing with the problem he
[1:29:47] had to be on his toes and wide-awake
[1:29:49] every hour of his life but how do we
[1:29:52] know David was anointed to fight to win
[1:29:55] because every time something showed up
[1:29:57] in his pathway no matter how difficult a
[1:29:59] hard it was he just pressed right on
[1:30:02] through that trial and that trouble in
[1:30:03] that battle he press right on through it
[1:30:06] until he was able to come out on the
[1:30:07] other side with his hands raised saying
[1:30:09] thank God Almighty he brought me through
[1:30:10] another another hard time another trial
[1:30:12] another battle none of this none of that
[1:30:14] friend don't be deceived some people are
[1:30:16] putting a gun in their mouth some people
[1:30:17] are walking off and committing suicide
[1:30:19] and and and leaving their families and
[1:30:21] leaving God and leaving Church and given
[1:30:23] up on life and living their life out of
[1:30:25] a bottle and at the other end of a of a
[1:30:28] marijuana cigarette or shooting some
[1:30:30] kind of a dope in their vein or some
[1:30:31] that they've given up on life because
[1:30:33] there's no anointing hallelujah to keep
[1:30:36] him in the battle let me tell you what a
[1:30:40] fighter looks like a fighter is a
[1:30:41] fighter when he's in a fight oh yeah
[1:30:47] that should have got a real big
[1:30:48] hallelujah day man out there you don't
[1:30:51] call him a fighter if he's sitting in
[1:30:53] the corner twiddle his thumbs anybody
[1:30:57] ever seen a boxing match anybody put
[1:30:59] your hand up you ever seen a boxing
[1:31:00] match I didn't ask if you wanted to but
[1:31:02] I asking if you saw it you see them boys
[1:31:07] out there with their gloves on their
[1:31:08] hands and they're throwing and swinging
[1:31:10] and sweating and going back and forth
[1:31:12] like that but you look after and say
[1:31:13] wonder what they're doing you identify
[1:31:16] what they're doing they're fighting
[1:31:17] they're in a fight that's why they call
[1:31:20] them fighters amen if they were sleepers
[1:31:23] they had to look a whole lot different
[1:31:24] than that wasn't it
[1:31:26] they'd be laying in the van right Eider
[1:31:30] is known by his behavior no matter how
[1:31:34] much anointing lays on the bride well
[1:31:37] listen she is in order to overcome even
[1:31:41] though the fight may come every single
[1:31:43] day you wake up every afternoon every
[1:31:47] night throughout the middle and it's
[1:31:51] sunup sundown there's a fight somewhere
[1:31:54] and the fights coming but how do you
[1:31:56] know you are a child of God you're
[1:31:58] anointed to take the fight that's right
[1:32:03] and you win you will win oh you said I
[1:32:05] don't feel like I'm winning too much no
[1:32:07] maybe not but there's there's a winning
[1:32:09] side all of that if you're not getting
[1:32:11] up you're still winning and now they
[1:32:15] right he said the doctors can say
[1:32:17] anything they want to say but it doesn't
[1:32:19] matter he said he goes right on out
[1:32:21] there and fights anyhow alright now
[1:32:22] watch down Psalm one that was verse 3
[1:32:25] blessed is the man that walketh not the
[1:32:27] counsel of the ungodly stanways sinners
[1:32:29] see the scornful so and so forth he
[1:32:30] shall be like a tree planted so he's
[1:32:33] persistently placed in Jesus Christ but
[1:32:37] you said oh brother man we're talking
[1:32:38] about adoption so we are and how is the
[1:32:41] bride going to get to adoption how are
[1:32:42] we going to get to a place of adoption
[1:32:45] if in that place of adoption there's no
[1:32:48] growth remember when you get born again
[1:32:52] you don't become an adopted son of God
[1:32:54] right at that exact moment your
[1:32:57] positionally placed in Jesus Christ as a
[1:32:59] seed as a seed and say watch down
[1:33:04] restoration the bride see brother Brent
[1:33:05] said David saw this tree he said a long
[1:33:08] time ago what tree was a Tom at you you
[1:33:14] and you and you and you and you and you
[1:33:15] and you and you and you knew the bride
[1:33:18] tree that's what David saw he said in
[1:33:23] the writing of the songs for something
[1:33:25] joyful he said he saw this tree planted
[1:33:27] by the rivers of living water
[1:33:28] God's tree amen that's what you are whoo
[1:33:33] Laurie planted where by the rivers
[1:33:35] plural see the rivers of water
[1:33:39] plural the water singular seeing again
[1:33:42] putting on the whole armor of God it

[1:33:46] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:33:47] forever the bride tree it come up at
[1:33:50] Pentecost there's a tree that David saw
[1:33:53] planted by the rivers of water one river
[1:33:56] the Holy Spirit and all these waters
[1:33:58] flowing into it give spiritual gifts
[1:34:00] flowing into it
[1:34:01] it's leaves cat with her it'll bring
[1:34:03] forth its fruit he says right remember
[1:34:04] it'll bring forth its fruit in its
[1:34:06] season why the germ the life the water
[1:34:10] the seed all of it was inside that seed
[1:34:13] whenever it was planted in the ground
[1:34:16] and then remembered Paul said but you
[1:34:19] differ nothing from a servant until when
[1:34:21] after a period of time under tutors and
[1:34:23] governors you begin to put forth that
[1:34:25] you are a son you think like a son you
[1:34:28] speak like a son you behave like a son
[1:34:30] your action is son like are you with me
[1:34:34] see now watch here and got this people
[1:34:37] brought them said the bloom don't come
[1:34:39] out of the air the bloom don't come up
[1:34:41] through the ground the bloom is already
[1:34:42] in the tree
[1:34:46] what's that bloom doing in there anyways
[1:34:49] huh
[1:34:51] he said the apples already in it what's
[1:34:54] that Apple doing that inside of it
[1:34:56] because that's what kind of seed it is
[1:34:59] he said how do I know I'm an overcomer
[1:35:02] what kind of seeds in you how do I know
[1:35:07] I'm a conqueror what kind of seeds in
[1:35:08] there if the seed word is on the inside
[1:35:12] because you are a son everything is
[1:35:15] already planted in you at the baptism of
[1:35:18] the Holy Ghost you said all it has to do
[1:35:20] is drink drink more than its portion
[1:35:22] it'll spread out and then it'll bring
[1:35:24] these elements now I want to read to you
[1:35:27] just a little bit now from another place
[1:35:30] here I want to grab the invisible Union
[1:35:31] the Bride of a camp for just a moment I
[1:35:33] want to reach is something else here
[1:35:34] brother Brandon talked about on this
[1:35:36] thing of the seed and I want you to
[1:35:38] listen to this
[1:35:39] what brother brems said talking about
[1:35:41] this branch and he said the bridegroom
[1:35:44] talked about the bride and the
[1:35:45] bridegroom he said you were deceived by
[1:35:48] your first marriage time not when you
[1:35:50] come out through mother Eve
[1:35:52] now he said of course he said you said a
[1:35:55] real born-again Christian a real servant
[1:35:57] of God to hear that word he said he'll
[1:35:59] come right out through every
[1:36:00] denomination to that real fertile ground
[1:36:03] by the word the bedding ground he'll
[1:36:06] just do it I don't know how he does it
[1:36:08] God has ordained it to be done that's
[1:36:10] right he said Noah was vindicated for
[1:36:12] the word of his day he said his message
[1:36:14] won't work today
[1:36:15] Moses was vindicated he said but his
[1:36:18] message won't work for today
[1:36:19] John was vindicated said you believe
[1:36:22] that but it wouldn't work in the days of
[1:36:23] Jesus he said certainly not the law and
[1:36:25] the prophets were until John he said
[1:36:27] since then the kingdom of heaven but the
[1:36:29] Apostles them who set forth the Bible
[1:36:31] Luther come out the Reformation his
[1:36:34] words and his church that won't work
[1:36:36] today Wesley and Pentecost had worked in
[1:36:38] their day but it's another day he said
[1:36:40] this is the opening of the seven seals
[1:36:43] all right now watch he said I know it
[1:36:45] sounds strange to you but God has
[1:36:48] vindicated it so perfectly amen
[1:36:52] he said I had scattering that to the
[1:36:54] local assembly here I'm speaking to the
[1:36:55] people out across the nation see do what
[1:36:58] you wish to said but now notice the
[1:36:59] anointed word of his day of which you
[1:37:02] are a part by predestination you
[1:37:05] immediately like knew when you heard you
[1:37:09] knew right quick that she was an eagle
[1:37:11] you also realize she wasn't a
[1:37:13] denominational chicken to begin with you
[1:37:16] know there's something wrong in there
[1:37:18] something wrong he said that's right you
[1:37:20] were trapped into it at the beginning
[1:37:22] but then he said he the bridegroom took
[1:37:25] away your shame and put it in the sea of
[1:37:27] God's forgiveness by washing it with the
[1:37:29] water of the word and the blood of life
[1:37:33] alleluia alleluia
[1:37:35] how did you know that you was an eagle
[1:37:39] the seed declared it what was on the
[1:37:43] inside of you declared something is
[1:37:45] greater than what I'm sitting here like
[1:37:49] this
[1:37:49] yeah something see Luther's message
[1:37:54] won't work for today a certain
[1:37:57] individual that left the message number
[1:37:59] years ago so well I'm a little depressed
[1:38:00] a'f occasion justification won't work
[1:38:02] for today
[1:38:04] that won't work some other fella said
[1:38:06] well the problem in the message is we
[1:38:08] need to get everybody's sanctified
[1:38:09] sanctification alone Walt that's not the
[1:38:11] message it'll bring you in and some
[1:38:15] preachers are stuck in that every time
[1:38:16] they come to church they they looking at
[1:38:18] the sisters and try to see how long has
[1:38:20] their hair or how short is the dress or
[1:38:22] how high is the healer yeah I believe in
[1:38:27] holiness you all know I do but
[1:38:29] sanctification alone won't bring you to
[1:38:31] the fullness of what you're supposed to
[1:38:33] be that message alone won't work our
[1:38:38] couple justification was sanctification
[1:38:39] now you get a little somewhere now tie
[1:38:43] those two in with the restoration of
[1:38:45] these spiritual gifts of God now you're
[1:38:48] getting down the road a little bit all
[1:38:49] right what about the restoration of
[1:38:50] malachi 4 where the word and the power
[1:38:54] has to be restored well if the word and
[1:38:56] the power has to be restored and the son
[1:38:59] was the word then don't the son have to
[1:39:04] be restored right with that word I hope
[1:39:10] you're getting it out there you see it
[1:39:14] if the word has to be restored
[1:39:17] so does that Sun because the Sun is a
[1:39:20] part of that word right you said that
[1:39:23] anointed said now this today is the
[1:39:25] opening of the seven seals now I don't
[1:39:29] mean no harm in this but dancing across
[1:39:32] the front of the pulpit and kicking your
[1:39:33] shoe around and jumping up and down and
[1:39:35] Hollow where the bride and we got power
[1:39:37] and glory to God we're on the way out of
[1:39:38] here interruption all that that's good
[1:39:40] preaching that'll make you holler amen
[1:39:41] and praise the Lord but it don't
[1:39:43] establish you as a son look I believe in
[1:39:47] emotion I believe we need it I believe
[1:39:49] we need to worship God I believe in
[1:39:50] tongues I believe in gifts
[1:39:52] I believe in prophecies I believe in all
[1:39:53] of that I'm not by no means what I want
[1:39:56] to leave you with the impression that I
[1:39:58] don't believe in supernatural acts of
[1:40:00] God nor do I want you to think that it's
[1:40:02] all just of what we say quote unquote
[1:40:03] the word because the letter kills but
[1:40:07] the Spirit gives it life so some of
[1:40:08] these folks that are quote unquote in
[1:40:10] the word there's dead as midnight I
[1:40:13] wouldn't know what shouting looks like
[1:40:15] slapped him on the back of the head
[1:40:16] hello somebody can you see me you could
[1:40:21] holler a man and it gonna hurt you
[1:40:22] though huh right all the glory to God
[1:40:27] we're in the word all right well notify
[1:40:29] your face cuz your face don't look like
[1:40:30] it's in anything but misery you
[1:40:35] understand and yet in the opening of the
[1:40:38] word the opening of these seven seals
[1:40:40] when the greatest power is supposed to
[1:40:43] position the bride yet these two schools
[1:40:46] of thought are laying right there before
[1:40:47] the church all the time
[1:40:48] you got the one group over there that's
[1:40:50] trying to pull them right back into
[1:40:51] these old ways look friends I believe in
[1:40:55] altar calls but an altar call is nothing
[1:40:58] more than a traditional thing yes Sunday
[1:41:03] School
[1:41:03] Dwight moody started that as traditions
[1:41:06] we do it we believe in those things they
[1:41:10] help our young people some of the great
[1:41:13] lessons I learned about God was sitting
[1:41:15] in a Sunday school some old mother
[1:41:16] reading me out of the Bible or something
[1:41:18] like that
[1:41:18] I'm not against these things but what
[1:41:21] I'm trying to tell you is that if we're
[1:41:22] going to get positioned as a son we got
[1:41:25] to have the right food the right
[1:41:26] vitamins the right message to get us in
[1:41:29] that right position and just walking
[1:41:33] around preaching we got a message we got
[1:41:34] a message we got a message to me that's
[1:41:36] just as bad as some people 20 years ago
[1:41:38] 30 years ago walk around how we got a
[1:41:40] prophet we got a property we got a
[1:41:41] prophet and until some of you brethren
[1:41:44] might remember but the Martin but the
[1:41:46] Gerald and some of you brother might
[1:41:47] remember when they used to do this stuff
[1:41:48] years ago we got a prophet brother brems
[1:41:50] a prophet we got a prophet malachi for
[1:41:52] amount of cardboard and somebody finally
[1:41:53] stood up and said hey what do you say
[1:41:56] well my question denied to us is the
[1:41:59] elect of God is yes we've got a message
[1:42:01] but what does the message do for us come
[1:42:06] on somebody it should position us
[1:42:09] hallelujah to show us what we are to
[1:42:15] identify what kind of power lays inside
[1:42:17] of us don't you get tired of wandering
[1:42:20] around with your head in the clouds not
[1:42:21] knowing what tomorrow holds come on just
[1:42:25] be honest with me don't you don't you
[1:42:27] get tired of one
[1:42:28] around wandering around wonder wonder
[1:42:30] wonder wonder wonder are we ever going
[1:42:32] to come to the spot to where we take
[1:42:34] possession of what God promised us and
[1:42:35] say you know what today is my day as of
[1:42:39] right now I'm gonna take possession of
[1:42:41] what God promised me and I'm not gonna
[1:42:43] wonder a guess or be clueless anymore
[1:42:45] I'm gonna put my feet on this word and
[1:42:47] I'm gonna walk forward into God whatever
[1:42:49] you want me to do I'm stepping right
[1:42:51] into that vision no matter what anybody
[1:42:53] else says about it they don't that sound
[1:42:56] nice well in order to get there then
[1:42:59] you're gonna have to follow the right
[1:43:01] message of what it needs to be
[1:43:03] understand every time you come to church
[1:43:06] now this is some few years back I come
[1:43:08] to the church I preached on the Holy
[1:43:10] Ghost and we had some people give their
[1:43:13] hearts to God Jenna and some of them
[1:43:15] give their hearts to the Lord and Abby
[1:43:17] and some of them you know and and and
[1:43:18] and how wonderful it was to see that but
[1:43:23] brother I'm gonna tell you something if
[1:43:24] every time I showed up in Newfoundland
[1:43:25] whether on this camera or whether in
[1:43:27] physical presence if all I had to preach
[1:43:29] you is get born again get born again get
[1:43:31] born again get the Holy Ghost get the
[1:43:32] Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost to me if
[1:43:34] it look like brother bin you need to get
[1:43:35] into the message the church has to
[1:43:40] progress from where they start after
[1:43:43] they've been positionally placed then
[1:43:45] the church has to grow beyond where that
[1:43:48] initial way was remember I quoted to you
[1:43:50] Hebrews 6 last night where Paul said
[1:43:52] this will do if God permit but let us go
[1:43:54] on to perfection
[1:43:56] 1 to maturity all right so what am I
[1:43:59] trying to say I'm trying to say that if
[1:44:01] the seed word is laying inside of you
[1:44:03] look at brother brems trying to say this
[1:44:05] he said is the message of the hour the
[1:44:07] opening of the seven seals
[1:44:08] do you understand not probably 10 people
[1:44:11] understood what that prophet was even
[1:44:12] trying to say and I'm being very
[1:44:13] generous they probably had no idea what
[1:44:17] brother branham was trying to tell them
[1:44:19] he got people sitting there from every
[1:44:22] denominational walk of life Pentecostals
[1:44:25] and everything and he's trying to tell
[1:44:28] them about the opening of the seven
[1:44:29] seals and there's they're sitting there
[1:44:30] looking at him about like something
[1:44:32] y'all looking at me right now
[1:44:36] Oh what is it supposed to mean well that
[1:44:39] that's that's what we're gonna drive a
[1:44:40] little bit tonight all right
[1:44:41] now notice he said this is another day
[1:44:44] it's the opening of the seven seals now
[1:44:47] what did the seals bring to you and I
[1:44:51] night-night now get it out of your mind
[1:44:53] that the only thing them seven seals
[1:44:55] done was told us who them horse riders
[1:44:57] was get out of your mind that all it did
[1:45:00] was position Israel and tell us what was
[1:45:02] laying underneath that fish seal that
[1:45:03] the seals was a whole lot more than that
[1:45:05] that was the part that was written when
[1:45:08] you read that school book and you
[1:45:10] understand who the first horse rider is
[1:45:12] understand that was the part that was
[1:45:14] written because remember when you looked
[1:45:17] at the seal there was a written part on
[1:45:19] that seal remember let's let's catch it
[1:45:23] just a moment just because I'm gonna go
[1:45:25] into the explanation of this just
[1:45:26] briefly but pick it up revelation five I
[1:45:28] got my Bible right here let me just pull
[1:45:30] it open all right now see I saw on the
[1:45:38] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:45:43] see a book written that's revelation 5:1
[1:45:47] a book written within and on the
[1:45:53] backside sealed with seven seals now
[1:46:00] there was a mystery in that in that seal
[1:46:04] and there was a written part on the
[1:46:08] backside it was sealed with a seal so
[1:46:11] when you looked at it say why horse
[1:46:13] rider but once the seal broke there was
[1:46:17] a mystery underneath that all right now
[1:46:21] once you listen the mystery of God if
[1:46:23] you can understand it the mystery of God
[1:46:25] behind that first horse rider was
[1:46:28] Satan's whole scheme of hiding in
[1:46:31] religion what that white horse rider is
[1:46:36] now if all the seal is to you and I as
[1:46:39] well just the white horse rider well
[1:46:41] praise the Lord that's wonderful you got
[1:46:43] that much of it but you got to look
[1:46:44] deeper than that
[1:46:45] if Satan is
[1:46:46] hiding in religion where is the devil
[1:46:49] hiding today people he's hiding right
[1:46:54] here in the message of the hour people
[1:46:57] packing these books quoting these quotes
[1:47:00] set in our pews that's where the devil
[1:47:02] is hiding today and I'm awed and say
[1:47:06] something I hope you're ready for it but
[1:47:08] standing in the pulpit to don't thank
[1:47:12] everything that walks behind that sacred
[1:47:14] desk out yonder has got the baptism of
[1:47:16] the Holy Ghost not every one of them had
[1:47:18] the right seat on the inside of them so
[1:47:22] the seal declares to us that there's a
[1:47:24] white horse rider that's the written
[1:47:26] part that's the part we can read right
[1:47:28] here in the Bible but what is the
[1:47:31] mystery of it all right so then what is
[1:47:33] the revelation of the seven seals to us
[1:47:35] the potential of everything you are was
[1:47:40] hiding underneath those seven seals you
[1:47:44] see when the angel of the Lord comes and
[1:47:45] that book has been opened up in his hand
[1:47:47] remember he takes that book gives it to
[1:47:49] the seventh angel the seventh angel
[1:47:50] breaks that mystery to the people and
[1:47:53] then John says now give me that book
[1:47:57] because once the mystery is declared now
[1:48:01] John says give it to me
[1:48:03] who's that type out that types out the
[1:48:06] bride of Jesus Christ standing there
[1:48:08] waiting on the revelation to come from
[1:48:11] Christ down to her about what that she's
[1:48:18] a son as she's a daughter and all the
[1:48:22] potentials that lay in her as a son and
[1:48:24] daughter now if you watch this in the
[1:48:27] adoption brother brems said now what is
[1:48:28] a seal a seal the first thing it shows
[1:48:32] is the work has been completed so them
[1:48:39] seven seals they declare to us that the
[1:48:42] work has already been completed see in
[1:48:45] your mind you might think well I'm gonna
[1:48:46] get there one day in God's mind it's
[1:48:48] already done
[1:48:50] yes sir he just waiting on you to match
[1:48:52] the vision of what he prophesied in his
[1:48:55] own mind right another thing he said it
[1:48:59] shows ownership the next thing it shows
[1:49:02] security they talked about the Boxcar he
[1:49:07] said they went through and got
[1:49:08] everything set just right and said once
[1:49:10] they had everything put in there he'd
[1:49:12] make an inspection over it and then
[1:49:13] they'd put a seal on the outside it
[1:49:15] shows a completed work it shows
[1:49:17] ownership and it shows security so
[1:49:19] here's brother branham telling us we are
[1:49:21] living in the time of the breaking of
[1:49:24] them seven seals the revelation of them
[1:49:26] seals shows what to you and I ownership
[1:49:29] security and a completed work oh praise
[1:49:35] the Lord and hallelujah and amen
[1:49:38] don't you realize you can't be some
[1:49:40] little googoo gah-gah baby down playing
[1:49:42] around on the floor and your son I don't
[1:49:48] know if I'll make it today and tomorrow
[1:49:50] I'm still not sure and the next day I'm
[1:49:51] really I'm not with it no no if you're a
[1:49:55] son there's a completed work in there
[1:49:58] there's a security that lays in there
[1:50:01] you see folks running around I don't
[1:50:02] even know if I'm saved well I'm sure
[1:50:04] they don't know but if they come on up
[1:50:08] into the time of the opening of the word
[1:50:10] if they step into the position of the
[1:50:13] opening of the word no more
[1:50:14] justification meaning that every time
[1:50:16] you come to church you're not running to
[1:50:17] the altar trying to get saved again not
[1:50:22] now I'm gonna say something please don't
[1:50:23] think I'm thrown off on camps but that's
[1:50:26] one of my biggest pet peeves about youth
[1:50:28] camps and it seemed like every time they
[1:50:30] get to be young people there they want
[1:50:31] to run them into the altar get them
[1:50:33] saved anything wrong with that no but
[1:50:35] what about them ones that are sitting
[1:50:37] there that's already give their heart to
[1:50:38] the Lord five camps in a row huh why is
[1:50:44] it we call it young people's meetings
[1:50:46] but what we mean is get him the altar
[1:50:48] and let him cry and holler and snot and
[1:50:50] carry on meetings see those kind of
[1:50:56] things is just as dangerous as going
[1:50:59] into a place and just preaching holiness
[1:51:01] holiness holiness all and watch your
[1:51:02] dress watch your hair what
[1:51:04] this watch of that watch watch watch
[1:51:05] watch watch watch don't wear a watch
[1:51:06] while you're at it watch much much it
[1:51:11] doesn't produce anything self-made
[1:51:12] holiness like that produces zero guru
[1:51:15] sake nothing nada now if that's the
[1:51:20] message and that's what we're supposed
[1:51:22] to do let me ask you how can we ever
[1:51:24] come into our full position if those are
[1:51:27] the things that we feed on you
[1:51:31] understand this is why preachers have
[1:51:33] got to be diligent to feed to us the
[1:51:36] Word of God of where we're at now if
[1:51:39] it's a seal of righteousness as Paul
[1:51:41] makes reference in Romans chapter 4
[1:51:43] verse 11 he calls it the seal of
[1:51:45] righteousness of that of faith then that
[1:51:48] seal of righteousness is also Matthew 21
[1:51:51] 42 it is the stone which the builders
[1:51:54] rejected so that stone then seals
[1:52:00] together all of God's potentials on the
[1:52:04] inside of you alright I'm seeing
[1:52:08] twinkles in your eyes I'm getting I'm
[1:52:10] getting the deer in the headlight look
[1:52:11] I'm I'm getting a little deep for some
[1:52:12] of you I'm sure but that's all right
[1:52:13] stay with me just a moment I'm taking
[1:52:15] you somewhere but I I'm taking it slow
[1:52:17] because I don't want to just jump right
[1:52:19] into this thing and because you get too
[1:52:21] far down and certain things and you
[1:52:23] start missing the point of it and then
[1:52:25] what good does that do you if you don't
[1:52:26] understand it so my Walker does say boy
[1:52:27] he was deep yes did you understand a
[1:52:29] word he said not a word he said but it
[1:52:31] was deep sure hallelujah Amen don't do
[1:52:35] you no good that way all right now if
[1:52:38] you'll notice the bridegroom then the
[1:52:41] bridegroom is bringing in a pure
[1:52:43] unadulterated
[1:52:45] bride word that he washes with the water
[1:52:49] of his own blood see that she might
[1:52:52] become flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:52:55] his bone and then brother Branham said
[1:52:56] like this whatever you are this is page
[1:52:59] 36 invisible Union you are servants of
[1:53:01] God whatever God wants you to do where
[1:53:03] your place is God placed in the church
[1:53:06] some apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:53:08] he placed that by the virtue of his own
[1:53:11] predestination and you were that
[1:53:14] to begin with but like I'm looking
[1:53:21] tonight at amber Priscilla all right did
[1:53:22] you all know when you as a little girl
[1:53:24] you'd be married two coffees you
[1:53:28] probably drank a lot of coffee but you'd
[1:53:29] know you'd be married to a coffee
[1:53:30] shorter but the potential was that you
[1:53:36] was already a bride when he was playing
[1:53:39] with baby dolls wherever whatever he was
[1:53:43] doing you know how girls do I got three
[1:53:46] of them and they put ribbons in your
[1:53:48] hair and all kinds of stuff I keep
[1:53:49] trying to remind my girls I am NOT a
[1:53:51] girl I'm a boy I've had enough perfume
[1:53:55] and ribbons in my hair last me a
[1:53:56] lifetime I love you but all of that was
[1:54:01] laying inside of you the potential was
[1:54:03] there
[1:54:04] whatever you was preacher housewife
[1:54:09] actor worker whatever you was see now
[1:54:13] watch he said we all know the modern
[1:54:16] church in his present state is in no
[1:54:18] condition to finish up the Great
[1:54:19] Commission that God gave the church for
[1:54:21] this day he said now how many
[1:54:23] Pentecostal can say amen to that he said
[1:54:25] oneness Tunas three just any other fuss
[1:54:27] and fight one this one that in the other
[1:54:29] everyone I'm afraid to face the word
[1:54:32] right down to the test you tell them
[1:54:35] about this I can't help but I can't
[1:54:36] believe that he said see it shows what
[1:54:38] your what mammy and Pappy you have you
[1:54:40] might be a state president or someday
[1:54:42] you might be this or that you better be
[1:54:43] a son of God now we know that the church
[1:54:46] could not the Pentecostal church could
[1:54:49] by no means carry out the last day
[1:54:51] message but it's going to be the elected
[1:54:56] people that's elected for it all right
[1:54:58] what is the last day message be careful
[1:55:03] be careful because other ministry in
[1:55:05] this truth will lead you to believe that
[1:55:07] to carry out the last day message is to
[1:55:10] learn how to be a parent and say brother
[1:55:12] brems said brother Branham said brother
[1:55:13] Branham said brother Branham said
[1:55:14] brother BAM said brother bream soon that
[1:55:17] just proves you got the ability to read
[1:55:21] but what is the last day message that's
[1:55:25] what I'm asking you tonight I want you
[1:55:27] think about it dis minute what is the
[1:55:30] last day message all right he comes on
[1:55:34] down see not aftershock and he said to
[1:55:36] vindicate Luke 1730 vindicate Malachi 4
[1:55:42] vindicate Luke 17 revelation 10 C to
[1:55:49] vindicate all of these promises now what
[1:55:52] does that mean to vindicate in other
[1:55:53] words when we say vindicate what we're
[1:55:55] talking about is make it live manifest
[1:55:59] all right now how many of you tonight in
[1:56:06] your own mind would say to yourself well
[1:56:10] brother bit I'm pretty far off now I'm
[1:56:13] nowhere near where I need to be
[1:56:16] how many feels that way yeah all right I
[1:56:20] figured as much
[1:56:23] but I'm gonna take this the last little
[1:56:25] bit of my time here because we've been
[1:56:28] going right now this just over two hours
[1:56:30] the whole thing from start to finish
[1:56:32] from that half hour of silence to right
[1:56:33] now than going a couple hours but if in
[1:56:38] your mind you think well I'm not too
[1:56:40] close all right I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:56:41] challenge you tonight to think what are
[1:56:44] you looking for if the final inspection
[1:56:51] if when the inspector comes by to look
[1:56:54] and see what qualities is on the inside
[1:56:56] of you if he does the final inspection
[1:56:59] what is he looking for all right now be
[1:57:04] careful when you think of this the last
[1:57:06] day truth what does that mean well glory
[1:57:09] to God it means I can explain the seven
[1:57:11] thunders it means I can explain you know
[1:57:14] going beyond the cab I can explain
[1:57:16] marriage and divorce that just proves
[1:57:18] you can read but I'm asking you what is
[1:57:21] he looking for is he looking for someone
[1:57:26] that can raise the dead be careful huh
[1:57:31] is he looking for someone that
[1:57:34] inspection that he's gonna do on us is
[1:57:35] he looking for someone that can manifest
[1:57:39] all nine spiritual gifts be careful now
[1:57:41] be careful how you answer I'm just
[1:57:43] giving you a little heads-up not at all
[1:57:47] as a matter of fact when he puts the
[1:57:49] seal on he's not looking for one gift
[1:57:53] he's not looking for one supernatural
[1:57:55] act he's not looking for one
[1:57:57] supernatural manifestation none of that
[1:57:59] is in consideration to whether or not
[1:58:02] you were a son or a daughter now you can
[1:58:07] look back there on that board right
[1:58:08] there and you see that that pyramid
[1:58:09] there within virtues on it now when you
[1:58:14] look at faith virtue knowledge
[1:58:15] temperance patience all that do you see
[1:58:18] speaking squirrels in that I mean it's
[1:58:22] connected to it but I mean when you read
[1:58:24] the word virtue power of God what do I
[1:58:29] see in that well you say power of God
[1:58:31] that's creating squirrels okay but can't
[1:58:36] anybody with faith believing the Word of
[1:58:38] God can't they go out there and do
[1:58:39] supernatural acts of God mmm sure faith
[1:58:44] will do all kinds of things but does
[1:58:47] that mean when the in final inspection
[1:58:49] comes that God will see that in them and
[1:58:50] say ah chip off the old block what is
[1:58:57] real power I got one for you being able
[1:59:01] to turn your cheek to your enemy being
[1:59:06] able to love those that hate you now if
[1:59:11] the master is going to do is final
[1:59:13] inspection to see if this son is in a
[1:59:17] position to where you can inherit all
[1:59:18] things what's he looking for
[1:59:20] I mean does it matter if the son is
[1:59:24] good-looking
[1:59:25] [Laughter]
[1:59:29] remember sisters it's just as easy to
[1:59:31] say Amen to a rich one as it is to an
[1:59:33] ugly one to whatever
[1:59:39] you'd be handsome or ugly whichever one
[1:59:41] you can say man to boat but is that the
[1:59:47] criteria think about it now what's he
[1:59:53] looking for
[1:59:54] if he's inspecting us you say but I've
[2:00:00] never raised the dead sister she carrion
[2:00:02] was said for the bream I fasted and
[2:00:04] prayed fasted and prayed fasted and
[2:00:05] prayed to cast out Devils and I still
[2:00:07] can't cast out Devils he said you
[2:00:08] wouldn't call to cast out Devils you
[2:00:10] recall to pray for those who can
[2:00:13] that's a supernatural act of God
[2:00:16] wouldn't you agree but is that what he's
[2:00:19] looking for now in our minds when we
[2:00:22] think oh I'm farther I'm so far away
[2:00:25] from what I really need to be are you
[2:00:27] look at your love for God look at your
[2:00:32] love for your enemy do you want I'm sure
[2:00:37] ya make a few little mistakes but how
[2:00:40] long does it last it not long you get
[2:00:44] angry at somebody you might struggle for
[2:00:46] a few weeks maybe even a couple years or
[2:00:48] some kind of thing but it's not a
[2:00:49] struggle like what the world has as you
[2:00:53] pray through it you're constantly
[2:00:54] praying about it you're praying and
[2:00:56] asking the Lord to help you in it and on
[2:00:58] and on and on so when he's doing the
[2:01:01] inspection inside of your heart don't
[2:01:05] forget he's not looking for some great
[2:01:07] supernatural speak the word control
[2:01:09] control storms and do supernatural
[2:01:11] things see we look at brother Brennan
[2:01:13] when we say brother Branham had those
[2:01:15] qualities in him ergo I must be like
[2:01:18] brother branham wrong wrong wrong wrong
[2:01:24] brother Branham was given a ministry to
[2:01:26] catch the attention of the entire world
[2:01:29] and the supernatural glory that shone
[2:01:33] through brother branham's ministry that
[2:01:35] was given for a purpose
[2:01:38] Alleluia and praise the Lord some 65
[2:01:42] years later that even the critics can't
[2:01:44] shut up about him they built websites
[2:01:45] and everything talking about him that's
[2:01:47] the kind of influence he had on
[2:01:51] he had to demonstrate powers of God so
[2:01:54] great that it would catch the attention
[2:01:57] of the entire world so is that what the
[2:02:01] inspector is looking for if you're a son
[2:02:03] a daughter is he looking down inside of
[2:02:06] your life and saying all right
[2:02:07] all right I want to see that spoken word
[2:02:09] creative power
[2:02:13] where is he looking for sincerity
[2:02:16] submission humility a desire to be right
[2:02:21] how many desires to be right like you're
[2:02:24] 3/4 of the way down the road you just
[2:02:26] didn't realize you are see what we've
[2:02:30] done is we've taken these terms message
[2:02:32] of the our last a truth and we've spun
[2:02:35] them in a direction of believing that in
[2:02:37] order for us to be last day bribed
[2:02:39] people that when we walk into Walley
[2:02:42] world down there and we step into the
[2:02:44] front as brother Carl always said
[2:02:46] looking for a rubber dinky a man I found
[2:02:47] out that's a rubber boat it took me a
[2:02:55] long while to figure out what that
[2:02:56] rubber dinky was all about but I got her
[2:02:58] down when I step in the Walmart
[2:03:04] lightning bolt does not beam in
[2:03:06] lightning does not need to be shooting
[2:03:08] from my eye sockets to be spiritual all
[2:03:13] right thank now the group that has that
[2:03:16] opinion are the ones that meets Jesus at
[2:03:18] judgment and says I preached I
[2:03:20] prophesied have done great things and he
[2:03:22] says I didn't even know you so if in our
[2:03:26] mind I remember brother Brown was like
[2:03:28] the wave sheep and God exampled life to
[2:03:30] him that's true but what kind of man was
[2:03:32] brother Brennan I'd take away all the
[2:03:34] miracles take away all the supernatural
[2:03:37] I'm talking about discernment of spirit
[2:03:38] and taking the hand and take away all of
[2:03:42] that from brother Branham what kind of
[2:03:44] man was brother Branham hang on
[2:03:47] everybody
[2:03:48] and don't Matthew don't let nobody touch
[2:03:52] that X button over there and X me out
[2:03:54] you keep me on for at least 10 more
[2:03:55] seconds here
[2:03:57] and don't you miss this what kinda man
[2:04:01] was brother Renan he liked to laugh
[2:04:05] brother Brennan got discouraged after
[2:04:10] the greatest movement of his life seven
[2:04:14] seals come open God catches him up in a
[2:04:15] constellation sends him back to
[2:04:17] Jeffersonville to open up some truths
[2:04:19] that brother brems waited on his entire
[2:04:21] life and not more than six months after
[2:04:24] that he has to drive through the parking
[2:04:26] lot and look at all of the different
[2:04:27] license plates trying to find
[2:04:29] encouragement because he thought nobody
[2:04:30] wanted to hear his message anymore just
[2:04:32] a few months after the opening of the
[2:04:33] seals anybody ever been there how many
[2:04:39] in here would I would believe that
[2:04:40] brother Branham was a manifested son of
[2:04:41] God put your hand up come on come on put
[2:04:43] him up oh you're kind of slow to raise
[2:04:46] them hands you know where I'm heading

[2:04:55] take away all the miracles now take away
[2:04:59] being on the hunting trip the reason you

[2:05:06] your eyes are going bad you're going
[2:05:07] blind thus saith the Lord take all that
[2:05:10] away what kind of man was brother

[2:05:57] standing right there we're gonna have to
[2:05:58] get the elders together get a ballpark

[2:06:02] Lord concerning this he's still trying
[2:06:06] to manifest the tenth vision he don't

[2:06:09] fulfilled himself

[2:06:34] and doing his job he's down by the river
[2:06:35] fishing and he thought to himself why I
[2:06:38] shouldn't be doing this I'm ratting
[2:06:40] around he called it that his old
[2:06:41] southern Express from Enid being lazy
[2:06:44] playing hooky I'm ratting around on the
[2:06:47] job he said he'd come out of it and woke
[2:06:49] up that morning and got to praying after
[2:06:51] he was troubled and he said to the Lord
[2:06:53] it's not that job I've been ratting
[2:06:55] around on it's your job I've been
[2:06:57] ratting around on anybody want to do the
[2:07:00] math on how long it was before God took
[2:07:02] the man's life how many believes brother
[2:07:07] Brown was a manifested son of God and
[2:07:13] yet here he is struggling and fighting
[2:07:16] with himself take away all the miracles
[2:07:20] take away all the supernatural take away
[2:07:23] all the discernments before the doctor
[2:07:26] touches you me t that tumor thus saith
[2:07:28] the Lord of go away no tumor found take
[2:07:30] away every bit of that what kind of man
[2:07:33] was brother branham do you believe he's
[2:07:37] a benefits the son of God
[2:07:38] sure was standing up there on the
[2:07:40] mountains sword comes into his hand this
[2:07:42] is the sword of the king he was trained
[2:07:47] the been positioned placed all of the
[2:07:51] expression of God was coming out of that
[2:07:53] prophet as being a son of God I mean his
[2:07:55] character not the fullness of course but
[2:07:57] the character God was in brother Branham
[2:08:00] he's standing there and standing in the
[2:08:02] gap and he's telling them pray for me I
[2:08:04] built up a complex and I'm gonna have to
[2:08:06] leave the field for a little while
[2:08:07] because I'm in an awful fix and I got to
[2:08:10] get myself right all right here we go
[2:08:14] anybody ever felt that way
[2:08:19] recently anybody ever felt that way and
[2:08:24] yet you believe Milgram was a manifested
[2:08:26] son of God
[2:08:29] what I'm trying to tell you children of
[2:08:31] God we're not as far away as we think we
[2:08:33] are because when we look at what the
[2:08:36] manifestation of the seed is remember
[2:08:40] the seed will produce all kinds of
[2:08:42] supernatural things short will but
[2:08:44] that's not what the inspector is looking
[2:08:47] for that's just a comfort immense that
[2:08:52] come to this
[2:08:52] it's those are things that accompany our
[2:08:55] salvation and I'm seeing a few heads go
[2:09:01] this way so I'm getting I'm beginning to
[2:09:03] break daylight a little bit huh all but
[2:09:12] brother Ben I'm so far what do you mean
[2:09:13] when you say that because you look at
[2:09:16] some of these things and you think if I
[2:09:18] am the seed Word of God if I am planted
[2:09:21] in Jesus Christ in other words I'm not
[2:09:24] supposed to have no trouble let me ask
[2:09:26] you again did David have his troubles
[2:09:28] was he an anointed king so he was the
[2:09:37] Horn of the anointed all had been pulled
[2:09:39] right on him allowed to fight lions he
[2:09:47] still had to fight bears he still had to
[2:09:51] fight Goliath all right here comes I'm
[2:09:56] gonna I'm gonna unload all of it on you
[2:09:58] right now this is the Whammy but if I'm
[2:10:02] a manifested son of God that means I
[2:10:04] will overcome everything there is to
[2:10:06] overcome overcome yes but fight is an
[2:10:10] entirely different thing than overcoming
[2:10:13] it doesn't mean that you won't fight
[2:10:16] you'll wake up in the morning and
[2:10:18] perhaps looking in the mirror you might
[2:10:20] be hurting so bad you can't even always
[2:10:21] stand up your eyes might be giving your
[2:10:24] problems your back might be giving you
[2:10:25] issues you might have grief in your
[2:10:27] heart you might be battling depression
[2:10:29] the day of the
[2:10:30] sir then you get up looking a mirror at
[2:10:33] your medicine cabinet you pulled him
[2:10:34] back to cabinet so you can get your
[2:10:36] pills for the day for your heart
[2:10:38] wherever what it might be manifested son
[2:10:42] of God manifested daughter of God all
[2:10:47] but if I'm a manifested son there won't
[2:10:51] be no sickness in my body where did he
[2:10:53] say it I want quote verse chapter line
[2:10:57] page verse I'll just go ahead and save
[2:11:04] you the trouble I've done the quote
[2:11:06] search myself it ain't there the boy
[2:11:12] when we get ahold of this third pull
[2:11:14] missing limbs are gonna be restored yes
[2:11:20] but how many we don't know God could do
[2:11:24] it one time in a body that could make up
[2:11:28] ten thousand he could do it one time
[2:11:29] just to prove that there's spoken word
[2:11:33] power amongst the body of Jesus Christ
[2:11:37] manifest the Son of God brother Branham
[2:11:39] was a seed of God he manifested the
[2:11:43] promise of God he manifested the Word of
[2:11:45] God just like he said there the message

[2:12:46] everything is packed in good and tight
[2:12:48] full of the gospel and every word of God
[2:12:51] is good everything is perfect I believe
[2:12:53] every word of God you believe that God
[2:12:55] still heals amen
[2:12:57] you believe Jesus save me a saying for
[2:12:58] every man you believe the Holy Ghost as
[2:13:00] real as ever was a man you believe the
[2:13:02] same spirit though fell on Paul fell on
[2:13:04] us and a man you believe he does the
[2:13:07] same things he did on us that he did
[2:13:09] them and said AHA hey man I was she's
[2:13:11] getting tight nice like getting tight
[2:13:12] ready to close the door that's I'm
[2:13:17] asking you what's he looking for now if
[2:13:21] in our mind we've got this idea that to
[2:13:23] be a manifested son of God means that
[2:13:25] every time we set our feet on our
[2:13:27] bedside the devil starts going oh be
[2:13:34] careful that ain't your flesh the
[2:13:35] devil's afraid of Church what he's
[2:13:39] afraid of is a surrendered life and if
[2:13:45] there's any fear in the devil at all
[2:13:46] it's not because of you and this right
[2:13:49] here it's because of that promise word
[2:13:52] and because of what material is on the
[2:13:55] inside of you love joy peace
[2:13:57] longsuffering let me ask you a question
[2:14:00] has anybody ever been sad on the outside
[2:14:03] but been happy on the inside I'm gonna
[2:14:05] put my hand out you ever been crying but
[2:14:12] yet on the inside had peace you ever
[2:14:16] been so angry you feel like biting a
[2:14:17] head off a chicken or some kind of thing
[2:14:19] but yet there's something on the inside
[2:14:20] of you and I forgive them Lord I forgive
[2:14:22] them I'd like to kill them but I forgive
[2:14:23] them now I'm just being honest that's
[2:14:28] flesh stuff but that's something on the
[2:14:31] inside that's the material that the
[2:14:33] inspectors focusing on so if we are a
[2:14:37] seed of God then then the seed has
[2:14:40] nothing to do with whether we got great
[2:14:42] manifestations in our life again scale
[2:14:44] back everything that brother Adam did in
[2:14:47] the supernatural what kind of man was
[2:14:49] brother Brennan I got news for these
[2:14:50] bergen's and Collins's and the rest of
[2:14:52] these criticizers and the ones that
[2:14:54] throw off on brother brand
[2:14:55] websites and all that that little
[2:14:57] prophet of God could teach some of them
[2:14:59] bullheads a little bit about being a
[2:15:00] gentleman because take back all the
[2:15:04] miracles and scale back every good thing
[2:15:06] brother Branham ever did in the way of
[2:15:08] preaching brother Branham was a
[2:15:09] gentleman you know how to talk to people
[2:15:12] he knew how to treat people well they
[2:15:17] got me here about two or three months
[2:15:18] ago I ended up on their website I got my
[2:15:20] street cred now so I'm you know my ten
[2:15:25] minutes of fame Amen or whatever it was
[2:15:27] it took they had to agree with me a
[2:15:31] little bit so we understand what the
[2:15:32] minister's trying to say I said praise
[2:15:34] God we must be finally making progress
[2:15:35] with them but that's the way a goat does
[2:15:39] but-but-but-but-but
[2:15:40] sheep say a man goats just but at the
[2:15:43] word but what's he looking for friends
[2:15:49] you see I'm convinced that in our mind
[2:15:52] when we think manifested sons we
[2:15:55] identify the sonship part with some
[2:15:59] great manifestation of supernatural out
[2:16:02] there and let me tell you something
[2:16:03] friends no greater supernatural can be
[2:16:06] demonstrated in your life then bringing
[2:16:09] your life subject to the Lord Jesus
[2:16:11] Christ every single day of your life
[2:16:12] fighting your temper fighting your
[2:16:15] impatience making yourself pray all of
[2:16:18] them characteristics is what Christ
[2:16:21] positioned in you when you receive the
[2:16:24] Holy Ghost so I'm here to tell you
[2:16:26] you're not as far off as you think you
[2:16:29] are
[2:16:30] now how many feels like you're a little
[2:16:32] further down the road than what you did
[2:16:34] for a generation and the first time
[2:16:37] that's right you see and brother I'm not
[2:16:40] trying to be critical my friends I'm not
[2:16:43] trying to sound ugly about brother
[2:16:44] Branham and none of these things that
[2:16:45] other brothers have preached but we have
[2:16:47] gotten into a fantastical type way of
[2:16:50] preaching this message there has been
[2:16:53] such a can I say neglect when it comes
[2:17:01] to preaching the practicality of this
[2:17:03] message brother Branham was a practical
[2:17:07] human being did you
[2:17:09] that if brother branham couldn't take
[2:17:12] the gospel truth and fix it in his heart
[2:17:16] and fix it up in his heart where he
[2:17:17] could love somebody that hated him too
[2:17:19] brother branham it was worthless if he
[2:17:23] couldn't take the truth and the things
[2:17:25] that God showed him and fix it in his
[2:17:27] heart where he could absolutely project
[2:17:29] a love and so much that bees and bulls
[2:17:33] and everything else could normally get
[2:17:35] after him brother Branham looked for the
[2:17:38] practical application of how to live in
[2:17:42] Jesus Christ
[2:17:44] now sister you sitting there with your
[2:17:46] children all like that let's face facts
[2:17:47] you're probably never gonna speak to
[2:17:49] Arizona storms or Colorado storms or
[2:17:52] Ohio storms or any other storm for that
[2:17:55] matter but maybe your storm would be
[2:17:58] knowing how to go in when your kids are
[2:18:00] fussing and to be able to go right in
[2:18:03] the middle of that tornado and if you
[2:18:07] got young uns and they're going at it at
[2:18:08] all you know what I'm talking about the
[2:18:11] step right in the middle of that
[2:18:12] whirlwind and know how to handle that
[2:18:14] situation with such love in such grace
[2:18:16] that rather than ignite it like throwing
[2:18:18] gasoline on a burning fire already you
[2:18:21] can go in there with such love in such
[2:18:22] discipline and such steadfastness that
[2:18:24] you go right in the middle of a bunch of
[2:18:26] fussing kids and settle every one of
[2:18:27] them down and find peace in the
[2:18:29] situation that is more effective than
[2:18:33] being able to speak a storm out of
[2:18:35] existence so what are we looking for
[2:18:40] what's the inspector looking for now
[2:18:43] let's tie this together with Jesus who
[2:18:45] was the son what was God his father
[2:18:49] looking for in Jesus all right was it
[2:18:52] the lame leap like a heart was that the
[2:18:54] blinded eyes come open know all them
[2:18:56] things was just a fulfillment of the
[2:18:58] supernatural part that came with his
[2:18:59] ministry but scale all of that back and
[2:19:03] he did at Calvary when it comes to
[2:19:07] Calvary there's no healing there's no
[2:19:10] salvation there's no blinded eyes
[2:19:12] there's no resurrection none of that has
[2:19:13] taken place except for Jesus hanging on
[2:19:18] Calvary his own character
[2:19:22] manifested out of him when they're
[2:19:24] pulling his beard out of his face and
[2:19:25] hitting him and saying tell us who
[2:19:27] struck you and what more like that
[2:19:28] Father forgive them and that's what God
[2:19:33] his father was looking for in the
[2:19:35] character of Jesus Christ because don't
[2:19:38] forget God is a supernatural God
[2:19:40] supernatural follows God 100% faith will
[2:19:44] do supernatural things but what is the
[2:19:47] inspector looking for he's looking to
[2:19:49] see are we positioned in Christ and then
[2:19:52] after some time that these elements and
[2:19:54] that's why I preached this this way to
[2:19:56] try to show you these things were
[2:19:58] talking about that we feel like we're so
[2:20:00] far away from it's just gonna take some
[2:20:02] time for the tree to grow up a little
[2:20:04] bit for these things to manifest out of
[2:20:06] us so if you find in your life that
[2:20:09] you're still battling your temper well
[2:20:10] that's all right just keep drinking
[2:20:13] because eventually you'll push out and
[2:20:15] grow until you'll get over coming power
[2:20:17] over them things yes sir it takes us a
[2:20:21] little time just a little time but we're
[2:20:25] not too far off after all are we are we
[2:20:30] not as bad as we thought we was hey man
[2:20:34] now let me read you one more little
[2:20:37] place and we're gonna quit all right now
[2:20:38] this is Christ as the mystery page 44
[2:20:44] I'm in the old book here and that
[2:20:46] probably matters when you come to the
[2:20:47] new one there are a few pages off there
[2:20:51] listen brother Brian talked about like
[2:20:53] this he said he said their organizations
[2:20:57] and scruples proved that it's not their
[2:21:01] time at the word the words never been
[2:21:02] correctly vindicated just only in its
[2:21:06] strength seeds denominations and they
[2:21:08] make they make denomination they put old
[2:21:11] gypsum weed seeds in with a genuine
[2:21:13] wheat and it dies right out he said
[2:21:17] briars and nettles and everything you
[2:21:19] said she went right back on died out he
[2:21:22] said but they planted some real seeds
[2:21:26] and some of them come out and that what
[2:21:30] he called gypsum seed in other words
[2:21:31] just old tear it choked out that real
[2:21:33] life but God's
[2:21:34] the last days he'd bring a people washed
[2:21:36] in the blood that were predestinated to
[2:21:39] be there in other words as a people
[2:21:43] coming that can't be choked out if you
[2:21:47] can understand what brother Bram is
[2:21:48] saying here and every age they planted
[2:21:50] seed but it got choked out by
[2:21:51] denomination but in the last hour in the
[2:21:54] message of the hour in the time of the
[2:21:56] revelation of the seals there's coming a
[2:21:58] seed that can't get choked out I'm gonna
[2:22:03] let you know something friends if you
[2:22:05] can continue marching on no matter what
[2:22:07] lays in front of you no matter what
[2:22:09] battle lays in front of you no matter
[2:22:10] what trial is laying in front of you if
[2:22:12] you can get up the next day and keep
[2:22:14] putting one foot in front of another and
[2:22:15] you refuse to be choked out that is
[2:22:21] proof
[2:22:21] that's your farther down the road than
[2:22:25] what you think you are hallelujah well
[2:22:33] god bless you here we are two hours 37
[2:22:38] minutes and 19 seconds and counting but
[2:22:42] I think you understand what we're
[2:22:44] talking about now take these things and
[2:22:48] really like Mary ponder them in your
[2:22:50] hearts you know and say to yourself tell
[2:22:56] yourself I'm not as far as I think I am
[2:23:00] because in our mind we see the
[2:23:02] supernatural we see the great powers of
[2:23:04] God I think that's where we make our
[2:23:06] gravest mistake if I don't see that
[2:23:10] power living out of my life you may
[2:23:11] never do it you may be nothing more than
[2:23:16] a spiritual doormat mmm thank of it
[2:23:23] David said he wanted he said I'd be a
[2:23:25] doormat at the house of God have you
[2:23:26] ever seen a doormat doing anything
[2:23:28] supernatural have you ever seen a
[2:23:32] doormat do anything extraordinary the
[2:23:34] doormat spends its entire life semi
[2:23:36] wiping its dirty feet on them
[2:23:39] but they serve a purpose I'm not saying
[2:23:44] you're doormats now but I want you to
[2:23:47] think it in your mind when we say
[2:23:50] manifestation of the sons of God what
[2:23:53] are we looking for because when we say
[2:23:57] manifestation we're thinking
[2:23:58] supernatural but look at your love look
[2:24:02] at your patience look at what you used
[2:24:04] to be before you got saved look how you
[2:24:07] get mad at the drop of a hat well you
[2:24:09] say that's just aged by the bend you
[2:24:11] just grow out of them thanks Oh No
[2:24:13] I've counseled men in their 80s that are
[2:24:16] just like some twelve-year-old kid that
[2:24:17] ain't never been whipped yet just in the
[2:24:19] right way age ain't got nothing to do
[2:24:24] with it look at your character of what
[2:24:25] you used to be and where you are now how
[2:24:28] you progressed how you love how you're
[2:24:30] more patient how you've grown in wisdom
[2:24:33] and grace of God oh you said well that's
[2:24:34] just age and learning oh don't be naive
[2:24:37] the Bible said all good things come from
[2:24:41] the Father of lights in whom there is no
[2:24:43] variableness that's right so when the
[2:24:48] inspector comes he's looking for this
[2:24:51] pureness inside of your heart that's
[2:24:54] what he's looking for
[2:24:55] now if the supernatural comes along this
[2:24:56] will do if God permit sure if God
[2:25:00] permits it hey sickness gets in our way
[2:25:02] trouble getting our way Satan take your
[2:25:04] hand off it shore line comes up
[2:25:07] get away whatever whatever it is we'll
[2:25:11] let the Holy Spirit do what he wants to
[2:25:12] do this will do if God permit but that's
[2:25:14] not the thing because remember friends
[2:25:16] when we are changed and our bodies are
[2:25:18] changed and we're walking streets of
[2:25:19] gold remember you will have no need to
[2:25:22] speak to storms or heal the sick or
[2:25:24] raise the dead those are things that are
[2:25:29] given to us on this side but once this
[2:25:33] life is over and we cross this divide
[2:25:35] and come right back here to this earth
[2:25:37] to celebrate for eternity the total
[2:25:41] victory of the elect of God you won't
[2:25:43] have one need to cast out a devil once
[2:25:45] that new city sets on this earth
[2:25:48] so all those that cast out Devils praise
[2:25:51] God for them but that alone will come to
[2:25:53] a place that will cease didn't Paul say
[2:25:55] that where there's tongues will cease
[2:25:56] prophecy they'll cease this will cease
[2:25:58] that it will cease they said I've got
[2:26:01] love well that's a capstone ownership
[2:26:04] security and a completed work so you're
[2:26:10] not as far off as you think you are
[2:26:12] amen god bless you
[2:26:15] all right let's stand together let's
[2:26:18] have a word of Prayer
[2:26:19] and if you'd like to come to the piano
