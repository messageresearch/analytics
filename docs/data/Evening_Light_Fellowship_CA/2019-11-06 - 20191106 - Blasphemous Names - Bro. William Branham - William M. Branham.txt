[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the trust for seeking the truth a man the truth for us not abandon what is written as reference tear is going on in your life and going down and Maile a man beyond the sacred page I seek the Lord that's going beyond this into the manifestation of a man not just the letter of the word but the spirit of the word a man so that we're going to have whether bottle of God refers to tonight and that is a spiritual faith a man but his to many said just got an intellectual faint they got a faint by the letter of the word but not the spirit of a man so entrusted by the grace of God that we have Holy Ghost faith a man not intellectual not and not even in our heads but in our hearts because if God is looking for faith he's looking in your heart and that is the faith that pleases God it's not what's in your head it's what's in your heart so entrusted by the grace of God that we have their faith that pleases him amen by the grace of God so the Lord bless you we're going to go into a message by the prophet a man I could take it maybe take several certain sermons on it the problem of God is taking one sermon but as I had already mentioned on Sunday that somebody said to me you know well in our church when we have communion we just do the communion service and the foot washing but the proud of God would minister the problem of God would preach and not not just for a few minutes and in fact this radio is just before they have a communion service a man in Brenham tabernacle and he preaches for an hour and a half so by the grace of God according to the will of God we want we one here the how and a half but I've moved it forward so that maybe it'll be around an hour but he goes into an hour and a half he had not only that he didn't come to preach but rather brother Neville when brother Neville saw brother Branham back in Jeffersonville and had the tabernacle he he called on the Prophet to come up and and just talk for a little bit he said a little bit but again brother oh if he only knew that he was he was buddy the Prophet he was inviting God he was inviting Jesus to the pulpit a man and it was Justin but it wasn't for a little bit a man he went on for a whole night and he said I wish I had more time a man so brother I shall eternal it is God is not even when it comes to me just a few minutes here in a few minutes there no in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God a man and brother it took two thousand years for God to bring this to pass to two thousand years for God to write his word a man not just a few minutes not just what we would like just as quick as we can no no we will we'll follow his leadership Amen why because when we get into the word we're getting out of time and into eternity amen so brother in the nights right here and he said I know he said that some of you he said are hungry and he says you want to go get your dinner or supper whatever and he said don't do that because apparently some got up and left the Tabernacle before he said you left he said to go get your meal but he was putting more and more emphasis on the spiritual meal not your physical a man because brother there was a time when when believers just fasted and prayed fasted and pray and they would go on for days and not not eat anything a man they would drink water but they wouldn't eat natural food why because the emphasis was on the spiritual a man let's put the emphasis on the spiritual but the matthew was saying I hope by the journey you were going to preach me man well I said I'll preach and we're brother branham to a man so he will get it out of the mouth of two or three witnesses may be let it be established a man so the public of God is going to minister on this subject here and it is blasphemous names and it was in nineteen and sixty-two but he highlights the fact and it's it's amazing he highlights it that it that it the problem he cities Brenham tabernacle and he said this is your problem and this is what he wanted to highlight that what he felt was a problem with the Saints that he was dealing with a mayor just trying to find where that was okay right here and he should now get this lesson hey man let's get to listen we're not coming ears just hear this doctrine this theology and this theology no no we want to get the real faith that pleases God so he said get this listen eat less and he said why he said here is what's wrong with the Brenham Tabernacle what preaching blasphemous names he was just he was just the exhorting as far as he was concerned he wasn't preaching he was exhorting but he said this is what's wrong with the Branham Tabernacle and he said there's a two different kinds of faith and the rattled Tabernacle was manifesting the wrong time any event oh yeah the wrong kind of faith he says see it's not that it's this so I pray you will recognize that as beginning to the message on blasphemous names a man and then you're going to catch and a man then you'll make your calling your election sure make sure you got the right kind of faith amen so I pray the grace of God that we got God's feet I pray the grace of God we got it got it got the faith of the word amen and it's not in her heads it's in our hearts and I'm the Prophet is highlighting the fact that many have faith in their heads but they don't have it in their hearts amen and that's what God is looking for because brother if God is going to do it going to manifest his will and he's going to move according to his will he's gonna make his will flesh it's got to be faith in the heart a man he's gotta have somebody that believes in their heart there are many that believe in their head but how many believe in the heart many are believing the message in their heads but I'm here believing in the heart and as I said on Sunday it's a sad but it is true that made there's many a believer they just say well I'm a believer what do you mean well I mean the message oh yeah they act like it they talk like it Amen but they're not living like it and that I give you pre evidence to the message in their heart amen it's all the head but not the heart is their physical being is their feelings but not in the heart it is not faith so I pray the grace of God you know trait but I pray the grace of God it is the faith that peace is gone because without faith it is impossible to please him and it's got to be is faith it's gotta be what he reveals and how he reveals it and where he reveals it and brother and what does God do it and how does he do it where does he do it in the heart amen and it is by the Holy Ghost it's got to be a Holy Ghost State Amen not religious faith for spiritual faith by the grace of God and we'll get into that and just pray the grace of God brother he-man and to us as we go into the word tonight pray the grace of God as your pastor is going to highlight on some things and also keep in prayer our brother brother Jonathan that will be traveling this weekend and our brother John and we pray the grace of God to our brother John and the Lord will help him especially concerning the things that he has endured these last few hours are cooked 24 hours of two days amen so it and it is the situation's the circumstance that struck me when I was into the Internet and I in the news and they were highlighting what was happening on that street where our brother was living and where our brother John was working so I pray the grace of God to our brother John because of what he has witnessed and what he has experienced is not easy no indeed it is not easy a man because he witnessed he witnessed the injuries of an individual he witnessed the death of an individual and he was there of course - I believe he was there to carry out a blanket or a sheet to lay over him so we pray God whoever he is we pray God rest his soul a man and and pray the grace of God to the police who were investigating amen so grace grace to those that were responsible and I understand that after that somebody witnessed the fact that there was two or three people that came up came back to that area and one of them was crying they were crying because of what happened and of course then they saw somebody and they took off and they left again so they are they don't know so God knows who they are I pray God bring conviction in their hearts so the Lord help us and God's grace to our brother John as of course he deals with these and it's not going to be overnight it might be something that will come back and back and back to his memory of what he is witnessed they met one thing is certain he won't forget his trip to Newfoundland amen oh yeah brothers not only as fellowship with us but what he experienced out there in the world and brother again it's a sign that the world is insane the problem of God not whether Fright Night is going going to come to pass it has come to pass the father of God said many many years ago he said this world is going insane and you're good we're going to witness that insanity and we are witnessing it because what's going on and what we're witnessing almost every day one time with me maybe be a year so many years before something like that would happen in Newfoundland but now you don't know what the next day is going to bring forth because it's the end of all things so god help us is my prayer amen and god bless our brother john to deal with these issues no doubt they'll come to his memory many times and of course we still welcome our brother back to Newfoundland if the Lord let him let him that way if he filled it of the Lord if is the desire of his art to come back and fellowship with us we were certainly looking forward to it but being prayer for our brother as he travels on Monday a man and also prof course pray for our brother Jonathan as he would journey here and he will arrive on a late on a Friday night and and I understand he'd be leaving to go back to rich Colombia on a Wednesday so the Lord bless him and also god bless sister Blanca in her needs right now and the family amen also I was wondering if anybody else would have what I've been looking for and that is a picture of something that happened in the ministry of Woodham Branham I went through a folder of pictures that I had but I didn't find that picture I have seen that picture and I might have a copy of it somewhere else in my files but it's a picture of the prophet of God when he was ministering to the sick and deserting the thoughts and intents of the heart and praying for the sick and to finally he looked to his right and there was a sister sitting in the sin then one of the seats and she had a shadow over her and somebody went and the probably God I lighted it and somebody took a picture and sure enough there was the sister sitting there and the shadow was over her and I'm not sure maybe the Prophet had prayed for her and she was healed and then the shadow left a man so I've been looking for that picture I don't know if anybody else has got it or seen it the picture of that sister is sitting in the congregation with that shadow over her amen her brother's tremendous things that have happened in in the ministry of Malachi for a man and you know what all of it points to it all points to the coming of the Son of man not a son a man but the son of man and again reminding us of what the Prophet is saying he said I am NOT the son of man he said I am a son of man he said revealing or introducing the son of man a man and that's that is the truth if there's anyone that's been introduced in this hour in this age it is the son of man a man because it wasn't William Brennan doing what he did but it was it was Christ with us amen because that pillar of fire came down a man in 19 and 33 praise the name of the Lord amen and he begin to ministers through a prophet to reveal himself as he meant through John and brother was John didn't introduced him he didn't introduce himself it was the messenger that introduced him a man when John baptized him he came out of the water and he and John said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world a man sir John knew who he was that was the messenger who had to introduce him to the world and brother there was a messenger in this hour this age and again we know Malachi for speaks of 2 and as what he's pointing the father's to the children and is plenty the children back to the father's it was the it was the Jewish fathers pointed to the Pentecostal children now it's the Pentecostal fathers plenty of her and the children and putting us back to the Pentecostal father's and what God was doing on the day of Pentecost a man he was revealing himself as Lord and Savior and he's revealed himself in this hour again to the bright brace the name of the Lord and but as he was crucified then he's crucified now the word I pray God that we're not going to crucify the influence of the word in our lives amen we're going to let him go beyond our heads and into our hearts by the grace of Almighty God amen so pray God will speak to our hearts speak to our souls sure they're going forth of this word tonight concerning blasphemous names amen and as I said it wasn't he didn't come to preach the sermon he's just what the Lord laid on his heart amen when when brother Neville invited him out amen and so great the grace of God as we go into the word share a quote with you that I received that brother gave it's the other night and brother David had it framed and and on he's in his bedroom on one of the furniture and I said oh I think I should share that with the Saints so he said you could take it and it said this is from the search ages and he said the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval sometimes we feel bad things experience negative things in our lives is not a sign of God's disapproval a mayor he said neither our bright skies and still waters of his love and approval know a mayor it says his approval of any of us is only in the beloved and that's Christ amen we want approval we got to be in Christ amen Christ in us and not in our flesh but in our hearts and he said his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes but Alma out shall we know we shall know because he said so do we believe it and if we love he loves up we love him amen and he said we should know him because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and he gave us of his spirit placing us as sons are you a son of God we're either the children of the of God or the turn of the devil you're either seek the seed of God or serpent seed I pretty grace that we are not serpents eat my brother it's your attitude your spirit your motives your objectives actions and reactions that reveal what spirit you are under are we serpent seed or the seed of God oh my let's find out what the seed of God are they act that they talk what is their spirit what is their attitude do you have their spirit and attitude brother god help us anybody it is very serious and it's less and less and less in this world because jesus said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved grace of God to us amen he brought us to himself and he gave us his spirit now do you have his spirit or do you have the devil's spirit a man oh yeah there there's that pulse anointing so I prayed we got the true anointing and if it's true it'll be in our hearts and in our souls and how shall I prove my love to him it says by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that you're going to be thankful even for the trials thank you Lord you want to bring up what's in me you want to bring up my faith or lack of faith amen I trust he's bringing out it's your faith amen in him by the grace of God and let's make sure it's the Holy Ghost faith and the problem of God is bringing it out in this message blasphemous names amen the true faith and a false fee amen but they're going so close who deceive the very elect if possible a man so god help us brother is my prayer as we we will go into the word Lord bless you turn with me to st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 24 say Manya's Gospel chapter 24 praise the Lord so God's grace for the family of those that were involved in the Bond Street tragedy oh yeah we said oh that was this that was this yeah but if you're a father if you're a mother of your grandfather grandmother you're going to enter into the to the sorrow that they're going to feel and that they're going to send so now he that apparently like I said like that like those that came back after all that after the shooting that what and they were crying one of them was crying oh yeah so so maybe they felt bad about the tragedy so we pray the grace of God the conviction of the Holy Ghost in their hearts and souls amen and God comfort those that need his comfort and in Matthew 24 and beginning to read at verse 32 we'll start with verse 31 again when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him because they could have called twelve legions of angels our brother Dave was asking me a couple of nights ago or last night whenever no and he was asking me how many is in Allegiant well there was three five and six thousand in Allegiant and he could have called twelve legions yeah of angels and then they used the word Legion because during the days of Christ the the Legion of the Roman soldiers involved around 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers a mayor and Jesus referring to the twelve legions of angels he could have called thousands a man of angels and he said when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory amen Alleluia and yes sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats let's make sure that we're sheep and not goats amen and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left and then shall the King say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world Alleluia for I was an hungred and he gave me meat I was thirsting and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in did you I preached on that going to hell because not because of what you did because what you didn't do amen because jesus said in as much you didn't do it to these you didn't do the least you didn't do it to me he's talking about what they did but anyone on sin but you didn't do this and he set them to hell he caught why because then as much you didn't do it on to the least didn't do it to me they rejected him so brother I pray gracious that God's not going to judge us for rejecting him they thought we refused to help this one refused to help that one any man that we'd be refused to encourage this one or comfort this one a man to be there for those in need oh yeah if you're not there for those in need forget it you won't be there for him and you won't be in the resurrection that won't be in the rapture anybody because brother the Spirit we have here and manifest ear will heaven manifest there amen man brother it's got to be Christ it's crazy spirit crazy attitude crass actions and and the rear and the reactions of Christ if you've got the Holy Ghost you're born again that's what you're going to manifest amen again why is it true that it's not you the lives it's crazy that live within you I turn it and I can see it but you're not doing a man it's not Christ living in them it's the Antichrist living in them the spirit of the Antichrist oh just believe the message so come on do what you want to do live it everywhere you want to live no no you got to live for one another amen you get preeminence to one another god help us because that's getting less and less and less and again it's like he said when they when the rapture comes to be so few you won't even know that the raptures taking place you today when the Great Tribulation will break in on everybody and the bride will be gone amen god help us as I said brother Browns preach it now preaching and it says and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left and then sure the King say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was an hungred and he gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me we're going to identify with brother John and what he experienced and what he witnessed oh yeah you feel that burden you yo yeah not because you weren't there no because there was a one of the brothers in Christ was there a mansard the burden do they feel you feel and what did you begin to pray for you bu encouraging them by grace he said naked and ye clothed me I was sick and he visited me I was in prison and he came unto me amazing can we say yes brother amen that's what I did I did I did Amen Lord I did it for you not many can say a man about that today because you're not there living this world living for themselves amen they ensure the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungered and fed thee or thirsty and give thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or whom when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me not the one you look up to mister one sometimes you think it's down there that's the one Jesus is looking for you to minister to a man and then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed amazing they didn't do it into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels a man so they had the anointing of Satan on them even though they're religious remember like I said about Judas we don't hear nothing negative about Judas only when he betrayed Jesus and Jesus had more problems with with Peter then he did Judas because Peter was asking this they this this this oh yeah God's grace God give us Peter spirit like Judas is spirit oh yeah Judas was among the twelve when that did signs and wonders a man and there's no question about what he was saying this about Jesus that have been known no no Peter questioned Jesus Peter was trying to stop Jesus from we just stopped him from doing that he wouldn't even let Jesus wash his feet and so on oh yeah oh yeah Peter Peter had a problem and it took it took on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost to get to overcome himself amen but Judas we only was there he was chosen yeah we don't I heard nothing else about him until Jesus said what you do do quickly yeah one of you shall betray me Jesus said oh is it me is it me is it me well yeah they were they were wondering sometimes no not me no it's not me oh yes sometimes it isn't you and you don't know it you're blinded to it but this one was because the disciples asked is it me Jesus is it me Lord we love you a man so brothers sister make our calling election sure that were not serpent seed with the seed of God and and the King shall answer verse 14 say unto them verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least you're there to serve the least in the body of Christ he says you have done it unto me and then shall he say ons also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed oh yeah Judas was cursed because of what he did endure everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels I was a hungered and he gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not and then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then surely answer them saying verily I say unto you inasmuch as you did it on not to me to one of the least of these you did it not to me this is amazing I don't know that proves to me that the body of Christ is this less as fewer and fewer and fewer and fewer and the closer we get to the end it is you were and fewer and fewer real true Holy Ghost believers well he prophesied it that concerning the last days it's going to be very deceiving times you know and he went on oh they're gonna be religious but they're not gonna believe the word Amen religious but not believe the word God Elvis brother just go where Paul mentions that I believe in Ephesians there this is going to happen that's going to happen Seuss saw any and he warns us to take eat a mint stay with the word amen and the Father God is bringing out a man the baptism of the Holy Ghost you and Christ are one a man and he said these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal god bless his word pray grace for the anointing of the Holy Ghost in our hearts 290 of the Holy Ghost in our souls by the grace of God this day in 1963 and God in simplicity yeah all God is in this doctrine God is in that God is in that cause in simplicity in your life amen he said my opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days and it may come and you wouldn't know nothing about it see remember it's a secret catching away and he'll come in an hour that you think not we're gonna go in an hour we don't think that's right he's calm now it's going he's come to take us off amen so he said you won't know nothing about it she'll be gone but it be too late then he said you're at the end now when I don't know I'm looking for him today if he isn't here today I'm looking for him tomorrow if it isn't here tomorrow I'll be looking for him the next day and he isn't there Easter here this year I'll be looking for him I know he's coming I don't know the minute or the hour but I know everything is fulfilled ready for the rapture amen and he said the church is called out and it says it'll be a secret going just vanish and that will be all the world will go right on just the same people will be preaching people thinking they're getting saved just exactly like they did in the days of Noah a man and Noah entered the Ark and the people went right on the world turning just the same he turned just think of it he said eternally lost thinking they are saved in 64 he said after the bride is raptured somebody asked the question well any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they be lost he said no he said everything will be finished for the Gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth and the Spirit of God leaves the earth he this filthy is filthy still he that's righteous that's righteous do and he said Christ leaves the sanctuary and his day of mediatorial over the rapture comes he leaves the sanctuary he goes forth takes the book of Redemption and claims everything that he redeemed and he did say that the foolish virgin ghost the Great Tribulation lays down their lives amen for during the Great Tribulation he said what happens happens now grace to us in the name of Jesus amen so brother he said the time of calling may be already passed and he said I don't know I can't remember that can't say that the people he said went right on having meetings just to say after the crucifixion of Jesus and all the people he said they'll go on preaching and say they're getting saved but the world will continue on as it was they but it'll be too late then oh yeah there's come in an hour it'll be too late our gracious Heavenly Father we ask the grace of your presence your anointing to be with us the grace of your presence your anointing Lord in the going forth of your word and pray again Lord that the word be made flesh in us Lord that you're reflecting yourself in us in in our in your sons and daughters father I pray grace that that the baptism of the Holy Ghost for me for my brothers for my sisters it is Christ in me the hope of glory Lord it is the word in me made flesh or what you're doing Lord is in me is in my brothers and sisters the resurrection the rapture is in me it's in my brother and sisters because we have been resurrected we have been raptured and we are being resurrected and we are being raptured grace as we go into the word Lord to increase our faith make our calling and election sure according to the word we commit into your hands Jesus I pray that we'll ever and here not just ears but we live in here to hear what the Spirit is saying speak to us Lord as you spoke to Brennan Tabernacle father we pray that you speak to the evening late fellowship for your glory your honor your praise and for our absolute complete redemption in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ grace they may God bless you this morning I thought maybe that we would speak a little bit on something to encourage the church something that would give you a more what say yes doc if you will it might be good I want to use this shirt I had someone didn't have it to put on front last week so we he thought made it in it would give a little better for today I wanted to talk on it because it pertained to a dream a sister had I wonder his sister Shepherd is in the church this morning I met her the other night and the first time I'd seen the woman actually I didn't even know who she WA is I guess she's not yes would you mind would it be anything out of the way if I referred to that dream sister Shepherd you wouldn't mind would you all right sorry and before we approach that let's bow our heads now again gracious Heavenly Father to thee we give praise for all thy goodness and mercy and now quietness down Lord that we might study the word of the Living God as it comes to us through vision and is confirmed by the holy spirit backed up by the Bible so we pray that you'll give us understanding that we might know what to do in these last days as we see the evil powers settling around us now the battle the final battle is just about to be thought help us lord is real water strong let us keep the shield of faith up with a word of God the sword and move forward in Jesus name Amen now thinking of moving forward a battle like a battle set in a ray ready to go into action a real battle to fight the fight of faith sister Shepard here and brother Shepard who are very gracious friends of ours and who come to this Tabernacle and they are a precious children of God and and this sister Shepherd when I was picking up my mail the kind that Billy can answer just somebody say save me so many prayer clothes and I pray with him he just answers them back but when it's an individual letter I have to answer it myself you see so I picked up my individual mail and so I was taking it home and I was reading in there said from sister Shepherd and it was a dream that she had had some months ago and she never could get it just right until two or three Sundays ago when I taught all this this seven church ages and and the seven fruits second Peter how it takes the second Peter one to add to our faith the first foundationally is faith second add to your faith virtue to your virtue and knowledge from knowledge temperance temperance patience to patience godliness and from godless brotherly love brotherly kindness and then love being the capstone seven all those things seven Church ages see and seven stars of the church ages and all of it is tempered together by the Holy Spirit now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ Christ build this church in seven Church ages his bride a person woman Church seven ages constitute and make the bride some out of this age and some out of that agents some out of that ages all together and shaping it like a pyramid like Enoch you built the pyramids that we believe and the capstone never was put on top of them because the headstone was rejected and we taken out not as doctrine but as to understand just through the church here that these God makes his self perfect in three he makes yourself perfect and Father Son Holy Ghost three officers of one God he makes this self perfect and justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost come perfect works of grace he makes yourself perfected in three comings first time to redeem his bribes second times you receive his bride third time in the Millennium with his bride and everything is perfected in threes and seven is the worship number of God God is worshiped in seven completed now perfected and completed and the strange thing was not to bring this in but just to show you the last deer that I got had five points on one side and three on the other see grease and perfection now notice on this like Christ God wrote three Bibles the first Bible was in the sky called the zodiac now if you don't know the book of Job just forget about it call because job is the one explains it how that he looked up and he named those things in the sky and notice in the zodiac what you start off with the first thing in the zodiac is the Virgin the last thing in the zodiac is Leo the line the first coming of Christ through the verge of the second coming Leo the line the line of the tribe of Judah then deena completed in his day are back in that day appear me and of course you haven't got time to background it and show how that that pyramid come up through the chambers and so for this speaks right straight to the end time now they're in the King's Chamber now for the measurement but the headstone never was put on the pyramid and that's such perfect architecture ER or masonry until even a little thin razor blade and they don't know how they ever build don't understand could ever erase your brain slice along the sides where that martyr should be in the dough barter in it it just perfected tucked together so that's what it is what Christ and the church becomes one there's no mortar between there's nothing between just God and the person God Christ and the person now but the capstone they've never found it you know the stone scrolling heaven England the arty the Kings are two to crown him and so forth but the headstone notice on American dollar bill you'll see if on the American dollar bill on the one side the left side is the American seal an eagle with the spears in his hand on the second side this is called a seal of the United States but on the next side is the peer made and above it a great eye and under here says the Great Seal why would it be the Great Seal in this nation even above the seal of our nation see no matter what she ever did God makes us speak just the same see he makes the sinner speak out he makes the nation speak of it everything has to speak of you more to you you want to believe it or not it's right there now nor sees the eye and at the eye of God and because that the cap didn't come off the head seal because it was rejected which was the son of God the cornerstone of the building the head seal of the pyramids and all this now now I'm I don't like to sometimes they take these things and it gets out amongst brethren in churches of other churches and when they do that then the Brethren sometime gets a wrong impression that I'm saying something about brethren but I'm not I if you could just listen and understand see I am NOT speaking against any brother cause that's not becoming to rather to speak of each other we should speak far one another not against each other but when I speak sometime of certain organization like Presbyterian methodist or so forth they say CII's against it I'm not against the brother in there or the sister either the system is separating Brotherhood it's what my speak against God's children are one family and are not different groups and some of it I have nothing to do with it because that's Presbyterian I'm Methodist see now that isn't see that it's the system of that organization that breaks up that Brotherhood see now that like I said if you were going down the river and an old shaggy looking Bolton's go to try to make the fall and I know that that isn't going to work well then I'm not screaming a rebuking you I'm trying to get you how that boat see because it's the boat that's going to break up and and you'll be left sitting alone in the water so so it's not it's not the brother in the boat but I'll holler at the brother to show you what's fixing to happen while all these systems that man has made in their achievement has got to break up that's all we might have to come we have to come to unity to Brotherhood that's been my purpose of life is to try to unite and not break up an organization but then drop their ideas and be brother say every born-again Christian that's the idea that's where L stood well now if their brother would notice it ah many of our brethren even in our Full Gospel rank they do not believe that the Baptist and Methodist and the Lutheran and then have a chance but not they may be right but I don't agree with that I believe it's a age here of the Luther Age in this age here which was called obvi the Sardis age and then the Philadelphia age for the Methodists and then the Pentecostal layout see an age of these those are angels and God in each one of those ages TUC unelected people and in that if Hebrews 11 says that them without us has not made perfect and see but now the church has come from this coming in a minority all time so it's down into the 50 costal age now the reason I'm saying this that you might get an idea on what to assist your dreams and her dream is certainly comparison to what I've been teaching notice now here now all these Saints a first Peter the 6th and 7th verse tells it from by your faith that's first now I say that people claim to have these virtues without even being born again and I believe I've made a rude remark and says like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in himself and make yourself a peacock you can't do it there's to be a natural feather growth drumming the inside of nets put that feather out and always not always been accused to being hard on our sisters about wearing bobbed hair and manicure all over their faces tough I've always been accused being hard on our sisters it is that I got anything against that I don't say the woman isn't a good woman that she's some speak the halacha or something that isn't my attitude but it's this when she puts so much artificial on the outside shows as a lot of artificial on the inside think we're off to be filled up with because the outside always expresses what's on the inside by their fruits you know the anything and we're Christ or to be in there and to cure for the God and there's here for other things instead of so much artificial pumping you know green eyelids and unhuman looking and all that kind of stuff I just don't go for it and I don't be the Bible that's either so I like to be just what we are notice now if she hasn't got any fingernails and wants to put some on it she hasn't got any teeth and need some having got an arm and you need both haven't got hair and you need some you haven't got these things that's different but when you pull out you're a real good teeth because they're just not as bright as you should be and you don't know if you got red hair you won't black and you go down here you're colored black just because you're done wrong yeah I think so but the main thing is no scripture for that going to bother your hair there's scripture for that that plenty of that so there ain't we wanted I am sure that's right now now our sister in dreaming she dream that sheet well first she was disturbed what's the use of going on and trying to struggle through life if God requires us to receive the Holy Ghost and we don't have it now I don't think they may be taping this but the adult if they do it's for the church alone now if some brother would get a hold to this and you hear my voice brother on this remember I'm just teaching to my church you always before your congregation examine the the tapes and if you don't want your con Gatien here and don't let him here but I'm just trying to say to this a little group here that I as brother nevla knob of the Holy Spirit is trying to pastor ever and to teach them now there's some of these things that you might miserably disagree with so if there is just like I always said about eating fried chicken when you the bone you don't feel the chicken away he is still the bone away so Oh way to do that eat and cherry pie you're ready to seat you until the power you just fill the seat away so you do the same thing in listening to this now I believe that if the reason that there's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit it's not correctly topped I believe that the baptism is taught and you say the baptism but then the like you say automobile but now I've got several mechanics in this church and I don't know one thing about so if I make a mistake breath remember I'm not a mechanic there has to be Carl's and plugs and parts and vowels and everything else it makes the automobile and when you talk about the baptism the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that hmm see there's a lot goes with that and here's what I think that God is proving the holy spirit is sheer see our Peter said first faith I watch it real close now we're going to teach this for a few minutes faith now is your first and add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temperance to your temperance patience to your patience government irregardless brotherly love brotherly kindness and then love and anyone knows that love is God God is love see now that's then from this and that bringing it into the seven churches God is building in seven Church ages a bride for Christ amen through the Philadelphia Flatiron Ferguson sumerians emphasis a church agent Jesus said if the if the bridegroom come in the first watch are the seventh watch all these virgins awakened they were up there wolf the purchase of Elvis's Samaria Fergus cetera Cyrus Philadelphia and Leo seal did you notice that it was the seventh age that when he came and woke up those sleeping versions that brings him all the way back down to here c4 in this through the years ages he has built a bra board a bride begotten a bride order for Christ and the same way that he forgets this bride he has begot individuals now I'm back rounding this so that you will see when the sister's dream is being told now these failure absolutely must be in the Christian before the Holy Ghost ever seals them before this comes down on top and makes their complete unit now our sister Serena she was worried whether she had the Holy Ghost or not once she laid down across the doable where her husband was reading a paper and she's got little one says I had and they're always making the noise and things and so in this she fell asleep for approximately ten minutes or fifteen and she dreamed and she never could understand it or give it all together from a year ago almost until this message it was taught then while was teaching it all come back to her and she dreamed that she was praying she's walking the floor first before she dream and wringing her hands and thinking lord have I got the Holy Ghost can you prove to me some says because it and I shouted or some said because I hope it's him we believe it all that but I have a really God I believe in all those things those virtues speaking in tongues and shouting in all kinds of demonstrations I believe in every bit of it but if it's there without this there's nothing wrong ah see you got a share notice and she was worried tonight so she just laid down close to do a poll where her husband was reading and she went to sleep and she dreams she is up on a mountain and in this mountain the best I haven't got the paper before me but I think it's like this she dreamed that she saw a rock box like like a framework sitting right in top of this mountain and her husband but just behind her and she saw a large man standing there with work clothes long sleeves rolled up bathing the most pure water that she ever seen and pouring into this box this rock box sitting is top of the mountain and the rock box would not hold water and it rolled right out there and it's balled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there and boiling out and roll down the mountain and it rolled over her feet and she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her and and then she asked why the box didn't hold it and the man said that is not water that's the Holy Ghost and said nothing will hold it and said then he went back and got another big bucket and it was full of honey and poured the honey into there so no hole this and she thought that the boxer's a rock box is going to burst out and spill the honey but it isn't he finally stuck together and held it she turned and went down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped at the bottom of the mountain he looked back she saw five streams of this pure crystal water not contaminated by the things that didn't went through steel Puri clear coming swiftly then he slowed up then almost fading out and she was wondering would it ever reached the bottom of the mountain five stream and she woke up I think that's just about toast to being right in such a Shepherd now no more than I picked up the letter and open before I read it I saw a dream now dreams are interpretive now many of you come to me with dreams and say thanks to me about dreams I said wait a minute she never told it all think you go back and pick it up then if you can't tell what's your dream how you know the interpretations right or not see you've got the Hat you've got to see the dream a vision has to show the dream and when you see the dream that the person green they can tell them before they tell you then you know the interpreter philosophy that's in the scripture also Daniel one time what's that right said they're happy by just having to think of that thing see but you always see the dream now if its reputation drive a person to start telling your dream you can stop and say wait a minute and it was so and so while sewing salt plus so and so and then you say that's exactly right see a man the other day was trying to tell me a dream that he dream he said well he said I said nah brother whatta Julie about that as a coach he's the water report I said you dream that she threw a rock up in the air and I shot and got some mind he said that's exactly the truth brother man and they just picked the last part of it out yesterday mm-hm so there ya see why do you don't tell the truth of it but you see the always reveals back what tells you your dream what's your dream then you know it's right now here's interpretation of her dreams she was bothered about the holy spirit now it's the must-see scene the box on top of the mountain was the rock rock box is rock confession now like Jesus said in the scripture he said Peter said she said who does man say ah son of man am once at dark eyes Moses and so forth and he said but who do you say I am he said God - cries - son the Living God now some people saying of the Catholic Church says the Roman Catholic Church says that his can what the rock was that jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it they said it was upon Peter and Peter was that rock because Peter means little stone now on this little stone I'll build my church and upon teacher the apostolic succession they built the church then the Protestant church says that's wrong that it was up on himself he built the church now not to be disagreeable but up to my way of seeing it it's both wrong because he never filled up on Peter nearly did ability upon himself but it's up on Peters revelation of who he was see Judas man say I the Son of Man start Christ the Son of the Living God blessed art thou simon son of jonas flesh and blood has not revealed is you some similarity but my father which is in heaven has revealed to you darah Peter upon this rock of confession upon this revelation I'll build my church and that's been each church age has had that rock confession all up to this rock confession of the lady on SIA and now you cannot make a Holy Church there's no such a thing as a holy church or holy organization the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad Renegades indifferent and everything else so an organization will not hold your case a we got it no recip has no sir the Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals it's the individual so therefore the rock this latter-day Pentecostal church which has received the Holy Spirit they did at the first all rounds of the agents they receive the Holy Spirit but not in the measure that they have it now cause it's a restoration of the first as we take the candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they lift the first camel it went higher higher got dimmer dimmer and then come back again see first and last and so forth now but in this church age the message is being poured into but the church body itself in all together like this this Tabernacle will say that's where she comes to church this tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles there are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body of group therefore it runs out but what this man who was flooring the water the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was bawling out all the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Spirit does boils it up now now the honey represented brotherly love brotherly kindness which is this age I just got you telling see a brotherly kindness the age that we live in now now you might say look I sure don't like brother nails I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so-and-so and something like that but just let something happen to him come on your hearts broke and is here to kill you see we can't obtain brotherly kindness and feelings for one another see look the main pane and a group of people why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with your daughter as you will tonight you fellowship with you you shook his hands you worship with him he's your brother and you might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with cause you just kind of still wish you often to do but shun evil little but in the bottom of your heart or something happen to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister oh I'm an old man I was once young and I'm old I've seen it down to the age do that hear people say oh I just won't have the more to do with him and something happen to that man and then it kills you me thanks Oh God I'll let my precious brother go without making them friends with even singing thanks see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does the honey it's thick now in so much that she come from there down the hill to the bottom of the hill now this glorious life was gushing over Hills in five streams now five is a number of grace j esus f AR th gra cec-5 is a number of grace five streams was pouring from up here at the top down tear each one of these ages had that rock confession the saints are sleeping waiting waiting waiting wait and see onto this age but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come I will seal up the church then the church will be raptured it'll be a complete unit of God a bride for Christ who will be the head of all things you follow me now now she was wandering not in her dream she was wandering with this little stream with this little stream ever get to the bottom see it was drying up now being achiever self now here's what I want you to get you now she herself was wondering about her own self did she have the Holy Ghost now shouldn't say in this a few days ago thinking at the Church of these spiritual enough to catch it and maybe I'll go return this tape off right in half but of course I don't really get out amongst brethren but you could speak with tongues you could shop you could dance you could cast out devils do anything you want to instill not have the Holy Ghost did nun disciples come back rejoicing and shouting because the Devils are subject unto that and Jesus our mom was Judas then our Jesus Satan that day when he comes that many will company as they lured him out cast out devils and in your name done mighty works then I'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know yet those things are not indications of the Holy Spirit battle fruit you shall know hey now you say brother brandy we should we speak with tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them it makes us total block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God this has to be first then when you have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and Brotherhood up then the Holy Ghost come down and see you as a unit as soon as he steals the church ages as unit the way he makes this bride is the way you make this individual may our same material like Eve was made out of animal rib from the side here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be God said and God formed imitation only causes confusion it's like I said could you imagine seeing a buzzard sitting there with a dull feather stuck these wings they stammered up he's not a dog he's a buzzard vulture could you imagine a black Berber the peacock feather in his wings as they see that's coming he's sucking but it has to come from the inside out and produces Christianity God by the power of the Holy Spirit our sister had her feet wet when she got the bottom all of us know sister Sheppard to be a charitable her house is open her brother I don't care if it's a boom better water it is they'll feed him do anything they can to help him along Oh God accepted that her found nation part and here's not get decision here is what's wrong with the with the our journal for this here's what's wrong with a random camera you see there is two different kinds of fate there's two different times of virtue as I had the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance one thing just probation you got that is the kind of temperance that God's talking about that ungodly uncontrollable tipper you got me now that's time that's back but patience and so forth there's a mockery of it of pretending to be on nature giving faith on nature giving virtue there's a nature given difference all these things on nature given and the biggest part of our faith is mental thing by hearing the word we brings us to a mimic recognition of God but if this coming from above yeah oh brother if it ever strike this there is a godly spiritual peace then what does that face do that face recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the words with God and the Word was God and the words still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among it and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our middle faith becomes a spiritual revelation Oh a builder my church yeah not upon a middle conception of church joining a middle consecutive that but all their regulation when them streams of grace is pouring for that minimum fee that you've got oh this is spiritual relation how build my church there's a gates of hell can't prevent it against it mmm city this shows they would be against it but I'll never prevail oh what a glorious thing now seeing the faith these five streams I had a piece of chalk here but I guess you never brought it down but the five streams you see coming out through here tippers this together it's been the Holy Spirit that made the emphasis Church there's the Holy Spirit that's birth the Sumerian church the Holy Spirit that gives a pergamus Church and the thought Tyra Church in the dark ages it's a Holy Spirit that's built that it's pulled out of all the organization systems down through ages like then there's our elected a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy Spirit is called out of the Elain and spit the Holy Ghost in this a steady steady backpack that our two top Emma the Holy Spirit then I have been the individual sees virtues and your knowledge and tempers is added to our faith then when the caps don't come the Holy Spirit he meant sit together amen there's the Baptist of the Holy Spirit that's right your short today right let me see here I got some text row down here let's see I had a picture drawn here for her dream you can't see it from there now coming from the Holy Spirit why does Jung then he will give to you supernatural faith spiritual faith that here is the violence then sets spiritual faith recognizes only the water no matter what anybody else says they don't they don't do the good that only knows the word but somebody say the days of miracles is fast that faith only knows the word somebody says he no such name is the baptism the Holy Ghost that faith only knows or that's real spiritual thing you see that's right see it only knows the world name that was number one number one coming to you you're a middle page right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your middle faith make me the spiritual faith in the spiritual faith only recognizes the word now number two three then you have spiritual you be has a holy spirit and will seal all of these things into you as that only spirit covers this from your face up to the Holy Spirit filled you in with Christ and then you become Allah open your arms you become one see you and Christ Ava live together as that day you rolled it on in the father the father me I knew and you and me then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God now and then they are vindicated and placed when that time takes place they become vindicated sons and daughters of God do you remember over in the book of Matthew the 17th chapter the first to the fifth verse Jesus on that Transfiguration you've heard here you him that's serving I just here about a year ago freeze that comes to a popper here you him the placing of a son in Ephesians 1:5 also God has predestinated us not the adoption of son see a family when a son is born into it is man but that son had tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to the to be the right kind of a son he never become error but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positioning he'd become heir what the father had and that's what God was doing on my Transfiguration when he took his own son actually had been proven to be the right son he has stood all temptations he took him up on that Transfiguration and over shouting youth in the old testament they took his son resting in a nice pretty garment and setting out before the public and they had a ceremony of placing or we call it adopting and glaciers airplanes they call refer students adopting son yes now but placing a son ministers will understand and spiritual Bible readers a placing this son in other words the son was the son when he was born that's where our Pentecostal people made their mistakes being born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor even Sita if a man back in your age thought affirmed his son he wanted to be a right kind of son he got the best tutor he could find the best teacher because he wanted his son to come up to the artist and see so he got the right tutor now if a man were to think of the best tutor how about God our Father I he never got bishops and Cardinals and priests he got the Holy Ghost to be our tutor and the Holy Spirit is our teacher Haddy he's in the church and he takes message to the Father and then what if the father the tutor come up sit well father I ain't go to get some kind of tutor that wants a straw in his head - no offender we call it say aha tell the father something other little boys are renegade anyhow but if I tell the father the father will give me a raise that is the right attitude er a right kind of tutors asked tell the truth then the holy ghost tells the truth when he comes before God you up yeah so he comes up why do you think he'd blushed today to see your daughters are all cut their hair we control them hey your sons are so organized minded they just let the pc-12 the Heather Knutson and they're adopting this for this and this for that hi must blush but how that tutor would love to comes to old huh that sons a real son he's just like the father oh how I'd love to say that see then the father swell dot and pride says this is my son that's exactly what God's doing oh not Transfiguration hey no it's that fear opposes it elijah and fear all excited the supernatural has done the peter got excited status field three Tabernacles one for you and one for Moses one for a while he was yet speaking God shut up he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased cheri him see God put himself in the background and this is my son Moses represent the law the prophets rested represent is justice we could not realize lawful we cannot minimize justice I don't miss just as I want mercy I can't keep it all and I'll take me to justice but I need his mercy and God check those all if justice has been met in him he's here that's him that's the one now in the Old Testament well that son was adopted or placed into the family his name was just as good over check as his daddy's one huh yes sir they didn't have a head a ring and he's a science city and it spit on it place it that was a sickness that was justice he wore his daddy's dream his signet and that was just as good as his dead man now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus took our God places this is him now with the member is followed by the holy ghost into the family of God and it's proven the heavy right using the God can see virtue knowledge tempers patience brotherly kindness and godliness he then God feels he more places he ever there that's when you see the sons and daughters of God then Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption not some of you Baptists it won't you go on eternal security now if you come to that stage are staying with you to turn security if you'll come to that place but just to say anybody says hablo join the Baptist Church I'm a Presbyterian I got eternal securities that's wrong your own life proves you haven't got it let's go this is that thank God I did you and seals you by the Holy Ghost into East p.m. then there's no getting out of it I'm you are internally secured breathe grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby all you your godly virtues are sealed until the day of redemption I'll be there is a bride that's predestinated I leave God said he would have a church without spot or wrinkle I believe in predestination that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there I hope I'm with her yeah yeah see I'm with her no it's up to me to work out my own salvation of God until these things are approved or government sealed into the kingdom of God ever there's the Holy Spirit there's the genuine works of God it's stealing through the day of redemption that was her dream I thought it was beautiful now therefore when she does that when that church comes to this place are the individual the church is going to be there yeah let me say it real good so you get it the church is predestinated prabhu there I want to be with it but the only way I'll be with it is to be partnered how do I become part of it by being in it how do I get in it Bob baptism by a one Street first creatures twelve by one spirit we are all baptized into one body ever one body that's our vision but you can't stick these old things say ah stroke return I got it you go out here and hang Green Square and Carolyn that's peacock feathers enough yo J burger you see you can't do your a lot of proves that it's not but when these things are operating in you by God then your seal then there's no put on a balance you're just yourself that's when vision perfect Holy Spirit works of God everything is made manifest because why you and Christ become one a I hope that's understood you in Christ be come on I had something else a head roll down here I want to think of brings us to the place of life then you become have eternal life now got the Greek election unum the emphatic die Glocke I studied in the day of the word not in John 14 or John 3:16 we find more places have everlasting life another place that says have eternal life but in the Greek and the Greek version in the Hebrew it says life without end in the Greek word has a ah in AH a in almost like a on a on is a space that's heavy as a number that can't be number just beyond ministry opinion but this is a audience of time eternal and the English word part is we orders eternal a onion our life without in C and if you got life without you how can you perish you have become a part of the eternal and there's only one thing eternal sex is not eternal no he becomes Satan hell is not eternal hell was created is not eternal and these bodies are not eternal they were created but the Spirit of God is eternal it never had a beginning our it never has an end and the only way we could have eternal life from that Greek word Zoe which means God's own life we have read the company part of God when we become sons and daughters of God and we have a body enough so the positives us that recognizes this word from here to there that recognizes is a Audion life life without in it God yeah amen the other day on the trip I had a discussion did you hold a witness not no disregard anybody's believe we got plenty of em in convert sitting here from Jehovah Witness one of our trustees the Church of Jehovah Witness wasp and what saved him and his family's father was a reader from the woods and that all of us brothers and sisters now not always come in receive the Holy Ghost because of the visions of God tell them what they did and what they see had done it now but here Jehovah Witness in there look it says that the breath that you breathe in the soul now that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not solely if it is your your one time your one kind of soul next time you're somebody else's breathe that soul look where you be now the breath is wind and wind is what you breathe into your nostrils now they take the scripture from back and God breathe breath nostril and he became a living soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into man see what kind of bread is a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animal is a living soul cause they breathe a human soul in our soul in Oregon then Jesus wouldn't had to die their animal sacrifice of insufficient see so brother the argument don't stand but what God did he breathes a breath I'll teach her life a living soul a soul I can't die huh watch now we're gonna get into honey pump to your elbows hey don't breathe a breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul Oh God breathe not what nature done but what God did breathe a breath of life into his nostrils and he become a living soul then you say to me Adam died brother branham but remember before those who he foreknew he is call ya got a lamb Jerry demon he was a type and him fell then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils that become the breath of the eternal God and he become a living soul he was a son of God not his breath is the African word I don't know what the Greek word is at work right now but the African were to call amalia which means the winds an unseen force animal fries Amaya sinners dream a Moya then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the eternal soul breathes into us by breath while they'll be struggle for eternal life if that fire spread see hits can't do it but God specially upon Adam breathe the breath of eternal life and he become an eternal person with God yeah my god he was a a matured God he was golly oh my god in heaven now God in the air and Sunday the sons of God Lord can become gods jesus said so he's not written your law you're a god yes then G call those you can call God who God visited - you didn't Easter when I say I'm the son of God hey how we getting into something to eat now watch this when we drive it down now you're the are he is now a son of God but he makes a mistake he knows he's doing wrong I remember Adam was not deceived if I were said so first Timothy 3 Adam was not to see but the woman was be deceivers in the transgression Adam walked with ease because it was his wife say this Christ not receive our sins but walked into the death with the bride he went to be with the ride so he can redeem the church Adam no he was wrong so he just walked out with thee see but there was a land provided for them that they were redeemed and these lambs today that were four known by God and God is called there is a redeemer no man can come to me set my father draws him and all the father has given me will come to me that right so there is a provided lamb from the foundation Wow what her major put on the Lamb's Book of Life on lamb was provided to make a way of grace for everyone tickle your the resurrection provided lamb Adam's lamb now notice as Adam had a provided lamb now that's the church today I don't mean the the church you know what I don't say this to be sacrilegious and I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings I'm not here to do that because I've already explained myself I'm here to help but what I'm trying to do you know what Ashley these churches are not churches there's only one church these are lodges think they are largest I gotta finish all right but I want to prove that the appearance that there are merely lodges you belong to the Methodist Lodge to the presbyterian knowledge are to the Pentecostal lodges for hate your largest see you cannot see churches are actually largest where people with the same idea drift together but the church is one and you cannot join the church you're a Barden and when you're Barney remember of it just like my family I've been in the Branham family for 53 years they never asked me to join the family Wow I don't have to join the family I was Barda Branham and you're born in the church now these others are lodges you ever think of that yes sir one day I was mowing grass now it's thinking about well the great Holy Catholic Church they call it I stroll along I get more and something stopped me just a sip so don't call it that look Trina I'm sorry mourn on again you stopped me so don't call him that said they are a lodge like others they are not Church there's one church think they are members of a lodge cause you can join a lodge but you can't join the church the church you're a bard in it you become a member of it by new birth then a member of the family a brother or sister in it now let me just reach you out the emphatic dyg lot here something of revelation 17:3 and the apocalypse of the emphatic die got here and this watch this how this reads and how how beautiful just compares with it revelation 16 17 all right now let's read here just a minute listen to this real close revelation 17:3 and one of those seven angels having seven bowls came and spoke to me I'm reading out of the election having come I will show thee the judgment of that great who set us upon many waters and we all know that's the Vatican there we got our Sunday visitor in there and from the Catholic Church telling us exactly what it is see and this answer to said but wait a minute said there's been all kinds of name said we make 666 I said both just a minute said your name might make 600 I said I don't set on seven hills ruling the world oh I see they have to run and show their judgment the great it's set up on many waters waters revelation 17 15 as thickness and multitudes of people see with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication sinned in heaven saw the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication how long and he conducted me in the spirit into a desert the an Phatak die Glocke now see and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of blasphemy esteems now in the King James says full of names of blasphemy just a moment I get here in Revelations the third alright here it is alright revelation I meant to 17 not seven 17 now listen to third verse and he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy that's where the English get it but the original Greek from the die God reads it like this and revelation 17:3 listened and he conducted me in the spirit into a desert and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured Beast beast full of blasphemy esteems that's a lot different from names of blasphemy - blasphemous names what is it and we and I she was a mother of harlots we all know that what is it you don't have to be well that's right that would take the Roman Catholic Church but she's full of blaze steamiest names Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther and all calling themselves Churches of God yeah blasphemy esteems lot of difference between names the blaspheming and blasphemous names call themselves the Church of God represent himself before the world of card parties and drinking and carrying on the soup suppers and everything else and all kind of stuff there's only one church you're born into it you know coming there for your washing of blood of lamb is sealed away by the whole ego what a difference our being names the place teeny and blasphemous names yeah I caught that this morning when I was reading here they're coming down something just told me go into your room pick up the die Glocke no obedience that's all walk in I picked up revelation 17 so what do you want me read this part I start resi just struck it there it is I got a pencil II wrote it down after there it is now there are about me kicking against organization it's those blaspheme iya stains that call themself searches of God and Churches of Christ and churches of Methodist churches of his lodgings not searches why search that's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ and what is it the mystical body of Jesus Christ a population owners made up of a member of any of these congregations that would be a member of Christ's body you have to be born into it not joined into it and join in it is blasphemy esteems this woman this woman her power and you see right now or they're going to take all the people's got our ideas about religion ascend to Alaska you've seen that all of our advocate beliefs and what is it the council the World Council of Churches and the Catholic has their big gun to do going on in the Vatican now over there the word they're tying and all these bishops and so forth they're trying to come to an agreement to fight communism the world fighting communism and only joining up with Catholicism and it's just like it is today here we are as I said we're go we're almost bankrupt we're borrowing spending money now on taxes that will be paid fourteen years in today that's how far we are going who's got the money the world of Catholic Church how would it be long did you add States to keep you two back and whiskey companies and they surely Oh bar from when they do this sell their birthright right out to the Roman Catholic Church we consolidate watch this this plane planner read the newspaper here it is the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian so forth call themselves the Church of God Catholic and all that kind of stuff is this beast power for a blasphemy esteems calling yourself um I said I went to hospital you're not on boards go pray for a person I said we're going to is my mother I said we're going to have prayer for a mother and the lady said draw that curtain I said aren't you a Christian she said we're a Methodist I said thank you I hope maybe he was a believer not as Pullman yeah so if you're not a Christian that's different but we're a mess that's see so beef churches call churches they are not churches let me be sure that's on record they are not churches there are lodges people join them but you cannot join the Church of the Living God you're born into it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost how when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost these fetchers are sealed in you by the Holy Ghost and therefore he this born of God does not come out see who can write there you are oma we just talked all day couldn't the church is a mystical body of Christ born of the breath of God did you get the Church of God he is born of the breath of God God breathed breath and didn't not your spirit of Adam and he became a living soul did you know the Pentecostal to the true Pentecostal church it's born to the breath of God and let me read you something just in it it's something you see just a minute Saint John I'll be four I'm going to where it's light out where the Church of God is st. John CIB that's about 16 1920 alright y'all believe we'll have it right here alright let me read you and see whether the church has voted of the breath of God like Adam was in the beginning one and the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut and the disciples were symbol for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side were then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and Jesus and then said Jesus to them again peace be on you as my father has sent me so send I you but the father that's saying we're in I Jesus when he sends a disciple he goes in same $0.01 thought and when he had said this he brings no mouth and so receive ye the Holy Oh church bond of the breath of God paladin when this statue is moving itself a third condition God's breath breathes up on him they see the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born into the Church of the Living God buoyed by the breath of God God breathed upon them it said receive the Holy Ghost there you're not calm and giant put your name on there with your soup suppers and all goes with it you join a lodge you can join a Methodist lodged Baptist Lodge Presbyterian large Catholic lives or a Pentecostal Lodge and then you want to join but you're joining a lodge but when you become a child of God you're far by the breath of God baby a man but leave it alone right there alright God's life is also banned in you Jesus said just a minute jesus said I am the vine ye are the brain now what was her fuss with Jesus there first with Jesus because he was a man making himself God he will go God was in Christ see and he told him he said it don't look at me it's not me it's my father and he dwells in me see now David's looking at that to the body that was born to Mary see that wasn't God that was the son of God but God was in that body it was God he said if I do not to worship my father then condemn me but which one of you can leave me a sin unbelief for the word which word is God spoke hasn't been fulfilled in me sin is unbelief which one of you accuse me of see see there's unbelief show me if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the work smart though you can't believe me believe the works that I do for they testify otherwise the father is in me testifying of himself cause God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself you did oh now the same life that's in the bond is also in the branch I go to join that it can't I've seen a tree not all going brother share Jardin Arizona had nine different citrus fruit what was it it was a it was an orange stream a navel orange but it had a it had a lemon a tangerine a tangelo and a grapefruit it had all time I still have that tree looks I brush it can you tell me is that trees an orange tree sure how come I said I'd see grapefruit tangerine here tangelo here and lemon heard all these other priests how does it come he said well you see they're grafted in oh I said what I want to ask you something now you pick this grapefruit a lamb it off now I'm next year it will rot it will come forth then with a orange out that order said it come forth from the lemon see you can't do that you can't join in but he said every time that that tree gets a year old it puts out a new branch it comes worse as oranges if the vine itself puts out the bridge and what we've tried to do is the jon memmer's into him and we live on name of Christianity because we are as it's in a common way of saying we're the citrus fruit the Christian Church but when the vine itself puts forth the vine it'll be like the first body's put forth if the first vine is put forth they wrote a book of Acts behind it if it ever puts forth another one you'll write a book outside right so you're only joining lodges but when you're born out of line you got a fruit that's right you got a simple what do you do with it you have a form of godliness and deny the power their Holy Ghost you're not speaking in tongues you develop visions you do not prophesy you did not healing and yet call yourself a name no wonder the Holy Ghost said a power of a groups of people full of blasphemous names calling themselves Christian with forms of godliness but denying the power there are from such turn away for this as a sword that they'd silly women laden with divers lust all kinds of organizations the church is packing so much of this kind of society in that conversation what about the Society of Jesus Christ think we have all these other things and we burden the church down now there you are you never can join a church you join a lodge you're a member of a large of a group of people just like a lot of this we believe in this we have our orders we have our secrecy and so forth you do the same way on your honor so cultures but you cannot join church you join the lodge of members but not a church for you are born into that church and go by yourself down wait a minute Wow I'll close God can't we just ride together with that spirit yeah then it tapers in a vigil together with that hey man see then you were born into that Kingdom and there's a various life that was in this churches in that church and back back back and the variant life that was in the hall the vine Jesus isn't a member hey hey boy the same things I do hey there's the truth member of the know comedy testament of how the brain works for that individual proofs where he came there's life justifies what he is are you what never what body you belong to the body Christ well did you Jordan I didn't house before today hey I was born in it you don't have to tell him they know what's happened you're just how can you a lot of cameras put a bushel over he said no no when you're born into that kingdom of God then the life the very life that was in Jesus then you're interested in souls then you don't have to beg people come to the altar you don't have to beg for somebody come seek with those are at the on earth the faintest automatically flow because it's seer opinion hey you are a unit of God your seal with the Holy Ghost now do you know what the Holy Ghost means don't means I jumped up and shouted I had a strange feeling that was alright I've jumped up and shouted head strange feeling I spoke and on the topic the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues sure I've interpreted yes sir I believe that too but that even is that is what I'm talking about they can be a leak up here somewhere there could be a leak here in your patient that somebody smite you once on the face do you turn together but you said that dirty hypocrite then there's a leak somewhere scruffy all right but you know what I mean but when you're sealed you do the body of Christ and you're a spirit-filled and your son of God oh I thought for another two or three or four pages amen get the message goes on to page 46 45 sorry so we we finished up page 37 but again all I can continue on but the power of God said I'll be about 10 minutes but he went a little longer than 10 minutes I can understand that when you get into the end of the world amen and as a minister as a servant of God it's when you get into it it's hard to get out of it amen because the anointing is still there to keep moving on praise God for the word thank God for the revelation of the word I pray grace O Lord that you'll that it'll be seat on the inside and amen we water it with more of the word more the word amen and it's going to it's going to be man made flesh in you and in me so that that's good he said do you know what the Holy Ghost means it don't mean I jumped up and shouted I had a strange feeling that's all right he's I jumped up and shouted and had strange feelings I spoke in tongues I believe the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues I've interpreted and so on he said but that isn't what I'm talking about there can be a leak here somewhere there can be a leak there he said in your patience let somebody smite you on one side of the face do you turn the other amen it's a challenge you can have the gifts of the Spirit but still not have the life of the Spirit amen if you got the Holy Ghost in your soul you're going to turn the other cheek amen but if you don't have the Holy Ghost in your soul you can have it in your flesh as it were and if someone smoked you on the Wonder the right cheek you won't turn the other you'll smite them they met you you want to spite them and we get remembered again when I would naturally physically swipe beat somebody on the cheek it might be something you say about them and so on and to somebody else so and if they hear it well they could turn around say some of you oh no oh you're thinking so brother-sister we've got to have a right spirit and a right attitude and the right spirit and the right attitude is Holy Ghost they may and it's not just you know Nia again in our flesh and not the none in our heads but it's in our souls it's on the inside of the inside if God is dealing with any part of us it's a it's the soul a man and if you're born again you're born again on the inside of the insight not that this this robe of flesh shall drop and rice and sees the everlasting price and show while passing through the air farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer amen because we're going to that we're going to get rid of this old fleshly body and we're going to get a glorious body like unto his glorious body it's glorified body and brother Ram goes on and he said oh I wish I just had about 10 minutes to read something here he said would you bear with me he said for another 10 minutes and he went on and I assumed that they went on into the communion service after just think how in half preaching and then the communion but he referred reference description there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and the same came therefore to Jesus by night and said unto Him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher from come from God for no man can do these miracles that God be with him and he said see them sented rien courts they recognized that he was the son of God they knew it and here was their ruler right there telling him we know that you're a teacher from God and so on the very life of God is flowing through you we know that you your teaching is not of your own it's of God God is proving it the life of God flowing through it and jesus answered and said earlier I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God amen and that was a mystery to Nicodemus email and he said how can a man be born again he said well he entered the second time into his mother's womb no he said you're born of the flesh is flesh but you gotta be born of the Spirit born of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Baptist little ghost is a new birth a man and he said jesus said Marvel not that I said unto you ye must be born again and how many believers are born again how many believers got the new nature now in their souls controlling them controlling their their in their lives controlling their thoughts controlling their motives and their objectives it's the new nature now it's not the old nature as I said the old nature that is thinking in favor of the flesh well I got to do this I want to do this I want to do that because you feel it's going to be best for your for your physical being but no if you're born again you're going to do that which is missed where you spiritually amen what is the will of God Lord for me to do what do you want me to do where do you want me to go how do you want me to do it when do you want me to do it it's it's what God wants not my will father don't be done but again many so-called believers many so-called Christians they're out there to just doing what they feel to do to profit them spirit and then a spirit or a bus physically all this is this will be good for me physically this be good for me naturally this it could be good for me financially well they've got nothing to do with it what if what about your spiritual being a man you got it you go to make your calling and election sure but making sure you're in the spirit filled with the Holy Ghost baptized with the Holy Ghost in your soul you're not experiencing God in your flesh not experiencing God in your heads it's experiencing God in your soul on the inside of the inside a man you've got a lot of well the vast majority of Christians today and it's becoming that way around the message the vast majority of believers today they're living according to the to the flesh they're living according to or what they the physical person the the physical part of the field is the best and all this would be good for me this would be good for me but again your soul or your flesh are you looking for natural prosperity or spiritual prosperity a male if you're born again in your soul you're looking for spiritual prosperity and Lord attended college why should I care they're building a mansion for me over there built like that Briard that brothers say years ago and I no doubt I might have to tape somewhere where he preached and he said the biggest lies told are told in church and that's the truth and he mentioned that song he said a Tanner at college why should I care but he said most do what he said they're building a mansion for me over there cuz most want this they want that deny satisfy what a tender a cottage no no they don't have that attitude if you got the Holy Ghost you do you don't care whatever God wants that's that's fine with me it's fine with you by the grace of God oh yeah death to me those with that attitude and their spirit brother that's the ones that are ordained for the rapture that's right because they're focusing on the spiritual not the natural you're spoken focusing on the eternal not the temporal so brother I pray God that we're born by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the nature that controls us is the nature of God the nature that controls us the nature of Jesus Christ in us we're going to do what he wants us to do when when he wants us to do it ow he wants us to do it where he wants us to do it it's all we want to glorify him give him the glory the honor and the praise to God be the glory so he said Marvel not that I said unto you you must be born again the wind blows where it listed and he said the winds he said thou canst not hear the sound thereof cannot tell whence it came where it goin he says so is everyone that's born of the Spirit you don't live the a life to this understanding to those over there no I thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I thank God for the time when I was born again a man and you went out and you put the end of Sunday as the emphases on that and and people even even Christians looked at you what are you doing that for what are you doing this one why did you why did you do this why don't you do this no I said whatever God wants me to do that's what I want to do and wherever God wants me to be it's what I asked was but I want a man not my will father don't be done most to say that spiritually to believe this doctrine and that doctrine but I'm many going to say that for their for their for the life thing God wants them to live for the job well God wants you to have for the education God wants you to have are you govern are you governed by the Lord and the Holy Ghost or is it is it your own natural physical desires god help us amen so brother Nicodemus did say to him how can these things be and jesus said unto Him art thou a master of Israel and don't know these things and he said verily I say unto you he said we speak that we do know and testify that which we have seen and you receive not our witness you can receive the word you're gonna believe the word is is preached or just filtered out filter out yes well I don't agree with it I don't really filter that him no they golf he'll throw your life hey not you filtering not you but let God do it a man he say I've told you earthly things and you believe not how sure you believe if I tell you evidently things amen and if you're a Christian you focus more under heavenly and less under earthly more on the spiritual unless under natural amen so he said if I told you earthly things you believe not I was are you sure you believe if I tell you evenly things he said figure that out he should you know one time what think you of Christ a new son is he and they said the son of David and so on so he goes on to challenge the fate of random tavern echo and is challenging the faith of all believers Amen or do we have intellectual faith do we have the faith in our heads or is it faith in our souls if it's faith in our heads we control the faith if it's faith in our souls the faith controls us amen so I pray God that we have faith in our souls but but have you in the decisions you have made and you consulted the Lord in the decisions you make do you talk to the Lord about a purse nor what's your will what do you want me to do lord I don't care what it is in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your paths no most people make their own decisions for this especially natural things they make their own decisions they don't consult the Lord grace to us that's why there's gonna be very very few going the rapture that there's not many not many consulting the Lord giving preimage to the Lord because brother if we're going to give premise to the natural person we're gonna miss the rapture because the rapture the rapture is getting pre MS to the spiritual the new creature in Christ by the grace of God amen so are we are we are you do you feel that you're a new creature of Christ do you feel that you're born again a son daughter of God amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that totally now in my heart my soul my mind everything I I just consult the Lord I put everything in the hands of God Lord not my will dine me never an hour the bright will come to that place it's this hour amen for the resurrection and the rapture and there'll be nobody else going only those that are going to pray that prayer not my will don't be done oh yes it's going to be it's going to be difficult for us to a certain extent but he'll send his angel to encourage us to strengthen us oh yeah the angel came and ministered to Jesus just think of that angel came to minister that flesh to encourage it and he cried out not my will thine be done so the angel comes and I believe God sent his angel to encourage us in the revealed Word a man so god help us brothers to stay with the word give preeminence to the word there with me and he said but let me give you this first climax where does all these things come from that I have showed you and he said I said here they are they are in the Word of God it is thus saith the Lord and I said all you bear bear me record witness this that my commission is stay with the word and I said what's the matter with all of you can't you understand the word you must understand the word and he said I put the climax to them and told them that the things that they have seen me do is found in the word every bit of it in the word because I am commissioned to do those things he said all background it on the word then this great marvelous climax grace brothers bringing the bride to a climax of eternity amen he said the shadows are closer to end he said be on your gird for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears amen they turn from the truth unto fables we're living in that hour and he said all man has turned against me there's no man with me he said Paul said even demas has forsaken me loving this present world a man and many a believers going to forsake that the true Ministry because they love this present world amen let me finish with I'll just read a few verses from 2nd Timothy 3 and he said this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come you and I are dealing with perilous times beyond your car be on your guard amen like I said it's so closer we deceive the very elect if possible and they didn't say that they're not lovers of God but they're lovers of their own selves that's true most everybody caught up with themselves and what they want to do how they want to do it when and where no it's got to be the Lord Easter they are covetous they are boasters they are proud they are blasphemers amen well blasphemous names they're blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy well last we missed names well that's the churches out there yeah but it's also doctrine people that I cut off with this cut up with that kind of was something else around the message to just get caught up with the message and not not just of us in the message that the message being you amen so I said disobedient to parents unthankful unholy amazing without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good yeah god help us keep the right attitude in the right spirit they're going to despise those that are determined to stay with the world amen that despise those that are going out there and their spiritual they're not natural they're not religious they're spiritual they won't like them and since they are trade traders they are a heady there I minded know what that this is the truth if there's ever an hour of an age of people that our traders they're heading their high-minded and their lovers of pleasure more didn't say didn't not love God but their lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they're giving preeminence to the natural things and less to the spiritual so it says they have a form of godliness amazing they have a form of godliness but they're denying the power thereof the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and it says from such turn away amazing for of this sort are they which are crept into houses led captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts and again when it comes to the loss she lust after the things of the world I'm not just talking about sexual these things the Bible's not just talking about that but lusting after the world and the things of the world oh we want to we want to break it down to just physical sexual losses and so on no no God looks at what you're hungry for what you're thirsting for naturally and there's many that are lusting after this part of the world that part of the world that part of the world yeah was why the prophet of God said you're gonna be surprised who made it who didn't make it you condemned that person out there oh they do this they do that or doing this they're doing that yeah their attitude might be better than our hours than yours and that's what gals looking at their heart so let's keep her attitude raiding our spirit around definitely and it says they are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth never able to come to the revelation that God is pointing us to in the message of the hour and it's the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture and brother we got to let take the emphasis away from the natural put it more and more and more on the spiritual amen just think ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth so we're learning this we're learning that you've learned other things tonight through the Prophet but are we coming to the knowledge the correct and vital knowledge of the truth by the grace of God and as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses duties also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and Iconium and what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me and he said yea and all that lived will live godly will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution a man Paul want the Lord to take this and take that but God said Paul my grace is sufficient for you Paul want the Lord to to improve his sight and so on because he was getting blind physically blind you know he says see with large letters I've written what because he couldn't see with the small letters we large letters I've written unto you and so on and he prayed to the Lord the Lord said Paul my grace is sufficient so the Lord never healed him of his of the veil his vision you didn't go on amen by the grace of God so brother we want God to do this we want God to do that no no not my real father don't be done Amen Lord if I'm going to endure this in all things be thankful all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution amen so this let's let's go forth living godly let's go for maybe living out the word and if we're persecuted to God be the glory amen oh brother like I said it's coming to a place where you want you're going to have nothing yeah because if you don't if you don't join this one and join that group doing that group eventually governments are gonna take your take all you got yeah you're gonna lose alone because like I said they'll try to force us to join this group or that group or another group you know because there's too many nonprofit organizations god Elvis then we're gonna stay with the word Lord bless you listening we're gonna sing blessed assurance amen so this be in prayer for our brother Jonathan again as he ministers comes to Minister on the weekend and I also remember our brother John that'll be

there and Jesus had compassion yeah he had compassion how many of us got Holy Ghost compassion for this person for that person that you that your heart goes out to them that you pray for them you're thinking about this and that and there's a lot of people brother after what happened last night love him would even in a bubble forget it oh that's just the world well Jesus heart went out and he went over and played he stands on the under on the stretcher where they had the body laid raised from the dead a man what was it not necessary saying that they were seen but he had compassion [Music] yeah when you have the gifts of the Holy Ghost do you have the attributes of the Holy Ghost the nature of the Holy Ghost you got the nature of the Holy Ghost got the nature of God yeah God's not willing
