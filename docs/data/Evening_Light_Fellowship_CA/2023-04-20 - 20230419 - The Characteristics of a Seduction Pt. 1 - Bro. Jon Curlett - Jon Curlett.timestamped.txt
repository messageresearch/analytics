[18:40] blessing upon each one remembering also
[18:42] sister Delfina and remember of course
[18:45] sister Betty of course continue to pray
[18:48] for her and brother Gerald so
[18:52] they're certainly a native of our
[18:55] prayers and also uh brother Brandon
[18:59] kesser uh many of us know brother
[19:01] Brandon he's just uh having a
[19:06] vote of sickness right now it's more of

[43:12] Holy Spirit Come to as you wish
[43:18] we are changed as we move in our midst
[43:29] father
[43:30] Lord surely that's our prayer and our
[43:33] desire this evening Lord is that as we
[43:34] come into your midst Lord as we come
[43:36] into your presence Lord we're changed
[43:38] Lord we don't want to go out the same
[43:40] way we've come in Lord but we want to be
[43:43] lifted to a higher plane Lord a higher
[43:45] Revelation Lord a higher plane of
[43:47] Victory Lord a higher Dimension Lord
[43:50] where there's more of you and less of us
[43:52] Lord God
[43:53] so Lord I'm asking you once again to
[43:55] speak to your people this evening Lord
[43:57] that you would Minister into our lives
[43:59] Lord that you would touch the hearts and
[44:01] souls Lord that Lord you would speak to
[44:03] things that have I have no idea of even
[44:05] Lord God Lord but that you discern the
[44:08] thoughts and intents of the hearts Lord
[44:09] Lord and that your Holy Spirit would
[44:11] have free reign amongst us we pray Lord
[44:14] remembering especially again brother
[44:15] stride in the hospital Lord praying your
[44:18] grace to him Lord praying for sister
[44:19] Betty also not here brother Gerald Lord
[44:22] pray in your ministry and power your
[44:24] healing touch to them we pray
[44:26] in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it
[44:30] thank you musicians that'll be it
[44:33] I meant turn if you would in your
[44:35] scriptures to Second Corinthians chapter
[44:37] 11 I'm still not anywhere close to 100
[44:40] percent of the sickness has really been
[44:42] dragging on me and my Energy's not there
[44:44] my sleep's not there yet so certainly
[44:47] covet your prayers my voice isn't a
[44:48] hundred percent either but I'm good
[44:51] enough to preach amen so
[44:53] so I appreciate that amen it's good to
[44:55] be back here I certainly appreciate the
[44:56] confidence of the vote of the church and
[44:58] the pastorship and
[45:00] I talked to my dad and and he said he
[45:02] was going to wear the black armband of
[45:04] mourning for me
[45:05] not because he disagrees with what I'm
[45:07] doing or what I believe but he knows the
[45:09] burden that comes with it and he knows
[45:11] the sacrifice and the responsibility and
[45:13] how that can weigh on a man
[45:15] and I talked to Mom and she said I'll be
[45:17] praying for you and congratulations at
[45:19] the same time so brother John Andy said
[45:21] the same thing so it is a big
[45:23] responsibility amen it's it's not just
[45:25] me that gets called into this my wife
[45:27] gets called into it and my family pays a
[45:29] price for it as well and so we
[45:31] appreciate your grace amen I'm not
[45:33] perfect I won't be perfect I'll make
[45:35] mistakes
[45:36] but trust that you'll see my heart
[45:40] and it all in when I trip up and when I
[45:42] fail then
[45:43] you'll grant me Grace for that and and
[45:46] that the Lord would give me Grace in
[45:47] your sight that he'd be able to use me
[45:48] for your benefit amen
[45:51] amen God bless you there's no other
[45:52] place I'd rather be
[45:54] amen I was telling my wife I said and
[45:56] one of the deacons I said there's no
[45:57] other place I'd rather be I trust the
[45:59] hearts of the people I trust the
[46:00] experience of the people here you have
[46:02] to be a hearty Christian to live in
[46:04] Newfoundland because we don't get all
[46:06] the people rolling through we don't have
[46:07] big churches and tons of friends so
[46:09] guess what we got to make do with each
[46:11] other no matter what and through the
[46:13] years we've not just made do but we've
[46:15] learned to come to love and appreciate
[46:17] one another amen and I believe that's a
[46:19] legacy that we want to keep going on the
[46:21] scripture says that by your loved one
[46:23] for another all men will know you amen
[46:26] so that's what we want in our midst is
[46:27] certainly the love of Christ
[46:30] amen
[46:31] second Corinthians chapter 11 we're
[46:33] taking a different direction I'm going
[46:35] in a in a different way for the next few
[46:37] services
[46:38] second Corinthians 11 verse 1 says wood
[46:40] to God you would bear with me a little
[46:42] in my Folly and indeed bear with me for
[46:45] I am jealous over you with Godly
[46:47] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[46:49] husband that I may present you as a
[46:52] chaste virgin to Christ but I Fearless
[46:55] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[46:57] through his subtlety so your mind should
[47:00] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[47:02] in Christ for of he that cometh
[47:05] preacheth another Jesus whom we have not
[47:07] preached or if ye receive another Spirit
[47:09] which ye have not received or another
[47:11] gospel which ye have not accepted ye
[47:14] might well bear with him amen God bless
[47:17] you you can take your seats this evening
[47:19] amen and I I listen this this little
[47:23] mini series it's going to be maybe two
[47:25] maybe three services Lord knows I
[47:27] certainly got notes enough for one more
[47:29] maybe two more services but this has
[47:31] been laying on my heart for quite a
[47:33] while and I talked to my wife about it
[47:34] as I often do about just things that are
[47:37] going and Weighing on my heart and I
[47:38] said I'm going to preach on seduction
[47:41] and she she gave me the startled look
[47:43] that sister Maureen just gave me and I
[47:45] said no it's not on you know that that's
[47:47] that's that's the the modern world you
[47:49] know as everything is is centralized in
[47:51] these different things but I said we I
[47:53] want to preach on the seduction of the
[47:54] Bride because that's what Satan is
[47:56] trying to doing and so trying to do and
[47:58] so I want to take a series uh just a
[48:01] like I said two or three services maybe
[48:02] on the characteristics of a seduction
[48:05] amen and and I I just want to to maybe
[48:08] say that this is more of a public
[48:10] awareness campaign you know this is
[48:12] something that we need to be aware of is
[48:13] that Satan is is coming in and his
[48:16] approach is a seduction it is not
[48:19] obvious it is not always uh the angle
[48:21] that we're expecting in these things and
[48:23] if we're not on guard against seduction
[48:25] we're easily seduced we'll find Eve if
[48:27] you remember as it was was the first one
[48:29] that was seduced and I believe a great
[48:31] deal of that was because she wasn't
[48:33] aware that it was possible to even be
[48:34] seduced she didn't know that there was
[48:36] somebody out there that might have a a
[48:38] different idea or a different purpose or
[48:41] a different motive in their conversation
[48:43] or fellowship with her and she fell for
[48:45] it so if that's what Satan did with the
[48:47] first Eve then believe me he's going to
[48:49] be trying to do the same thing with the
[48:50] seconde he's going to be trying to
[48:52] seduce the bride amen and Satan is not
[48:55] obvious
[48:56] and I say that because so often what
[48:58] happens is we go through life and
[48:59] nothing seems to be happening bad and we
[49:01] think we're doing well and sometimes
[49:03] that's the greatest uh the greatest
[49:05] thing that will alert you that maybe
[49:07] something is happening that you need to
[49:09] stop and take a closer look because
[49:10] Satan is Relentless in his attacks he's
[49:13] just not always obvious so if we're not
[49:14] realizing we're under attack chances are
[49:16] he's gotten one over on us at least a
[49:18] little bit in our life and he's wormed
[49:20] something in that we weren't expecting
[49:21] and then he's had two thousand or six
[49:23] thousand years of practice
[49:25] in terms of humanity as we know it and
[49:28] he's been doing it for a long time and
[49:30] the best of us have 70 to 75 years of
[49:32] resisting him so it's something we want
[49:34] to be aware of is that we are not always
[49:35] we're not a people that engages in
[49:38] seduction and so it means that we often
[49:40] don't recognize it when it hits our path
[49:43] but if we go back to our opening
[49:44] scripture and Paul says I'm jealous over
[49:46] you with Godly jealousy for I have
[49:49] espoused you to one husband that I may
[49:51] present you as a Chase virgin to Christ
[49:53] meaning you've never been touched by
[49:55] another man you've never been embraced
[49:57] by another man you've never been
[49:59] intimate with another man he says I'm
[50:01] trying to take you to Christ in a way
[50:03] that is pure and I want you to arrive to
[50:05] your destination pure and untouched
[50:07] because he knows by history that Eve did
[50:09] not come back to her husband untouched
[50:11] he says but I fear lest by any means as
[50:14] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[50:17] subtlety so your mind should be
[50:19] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[50:22] Christ so the seduction of Eve's body
[50:24] started with her mind if he could get
[50:26] her mind to accept his seduction then he
[50:29] could have access to her body and Paul
[50:31] is saying that in this day I'm worried
[50:33] that the church the bride of Christ is
[50:35] going to be seduced in the exact same
[50:37] way that Eve was and should be found
[50:39] with child not of God that shall have a
[50:42] life inside of her that is not a holy
[50:44] life that is not by the Holy Spirit and
[50:47] brother Branham talked about this
[50:48] beguiling hundreds and hundreds of times
[50:51] in the in the message and and when we
[50:53] took that word beguiling back to the
[50:55] original Greek it says it's to seduce
[50:57] holy
[51:00] w-h-o-l-l-y not in a holy way but
[51:02] completely to completely seduce to
[51:04] deceive or to manipulate or to create a
[51:08] false illusion by way of deception so
[51:11] this is not something that's going to be
[51:12] obvious and then he says he beguiled her
[51:15] he seduced her completely through
[51:17] subtlety and that means through
[51:19] craftiness through cunning through false
[51:21] wisdom so when I say Satan is tricky and
[51:23] not obvious I'm just repeating what Paul
[51:25] is saying and that's that if he's not
[51:27] obvious that means that you're going to
[51:29] have to be on the lookout for him
[51:31] because he's not going to hit you from
[51:32] the front Satan does not come in with
[51:34] blunt force he's not a big bully in that
[51:38] way many times and and so often we look
[51:40] at the things that go on in in our life
[51:42] and we think the things of the world and
[51:44] the Temptations of the world that Satan
[51:45] trying to seduce us and it is in a way
[51:47] but those are the obvious ones and we're
[51:49] well taught enough that we ought to be
[51:50] able to turn those things down
[51:52] because they're obviously not of the
[51:54] word they're not obviously they're
[51:55] obviously not of God but when we look at
[51:57] this the scene between Eve and the
[51:59] serpent we see that the seduction of an
[52:01] eve was subject was it was centered
[52:04] around the word of God
[52:06] so that he the Eve's approach from the
[52:09] serpent the way he took her on was he
[52:11] approached her through the word he
[52:13] approached her through the promises of
[52:15] God he approached her through the
[52:16] guidance of God and from there he
[52:19] applied slow and gentle pressure to get
[52:21] her to the place where she would believe
[52:23] a lie that was 180 degrees from what God
[52:26] had told her she went from thou shall
[52:28] not to Thou shalt
[52:30] and that didn't happen over time and
[52:32] we're not told in scripture how long
[52:34] that is but her commission was to be
[52:36] fruitful and multiply
[52:39] and I you'll have to bear with me this
[52:40] evening because this is this is me
[52:42] speaking it's the scripture is silent
[52:44] but I believe that what happened was Eve
[52:46] started to get tired of waiting
[52:49] that God had told her to do something
[52:51] that God had told her to bring forth
[52:52] life and nothing was happening no matter
[52:55] how hard she believed how faithful she
[52:57] was yet nothing was changing and so when
[53:00] another voice came her way that seemed
[53:02] to have some input on how to be fruitful
[53:04] and multiply something turned her ear
[53:07] just for a moment and she was willing to
[53:09] listen to a different voice a different
[53:11] opinion a different message than that
[53:13] which she first received
[53:15] something Twisted her something changed
[53:18] her and it was Satan coming in under the
[53:20] false pretense of helping her to do what
[53:23] Manifesto produced the word of God in
[53:25] her life
[53:26] that's how tricky he is he came in
[53:28] trying to help her in her Christian walk
[53:30] we could say trying to help her produce
[53:33] or be what God said she was supposed to
[53:34] be be but we know that this took a while
[53:37] because God doesn't just walk out of our
[53:40] lives that way and we don't just go into
[53:42] a backslidden conditioner we don't go
[53:43] into a fallen condition just at the drop
[53:45] of a hat but in the end Satan's
[53:47] seduction was so complete that he
[53:49] convinced her that her best course of
[53:51] action was completely contrary to the
[53:54] word of God that's how effective Satan
[53:56] is as he will get you to say no where
[53:58] God said yes and he'll get you to say
[54:00] yes where God said no if we're not
[54:02] careful in these things
[54:04] listen that doesn't happen overnight
[54:06] it doesn't happen overnight this is the
[54:08] process of days and hours and weeks and
[54:11] these different things because Satan has
[54:13] nothing but time
[54:15] his only goal is to get us off the word
[54:17] and so he's patient and he's Relentless
[54:19] and all he's looking for is a little bit
[54:21] of ground every day in our lives the
[54:23] prophet of God would say this he said
[54:25] Satan is the best of that there is for
[54:27] he is deceived Eve by that way saying
[54:30] them same things and the biggest lie was
[54:32] ever told had a lot of Truth in it
[54:35] and that's the way Satan approaches us
[54:37] is he'll get us close to what the word
[54:39] says but he won't give us the full word
[54:41] he'll give us three quarters of it but
[54:43] he won't give us the full thing
[54:44] brother Brian would say in knowing this
[54:46] that Satan is making his last punch at
[54:48] the church he'll never be able to do it
[54:51] after this age she'll be safely under
[54:53] the wing of her lover after this time
[54:55] and where he realized that he's
[54:57] impersonating in the way of religion
[55:02] so that means he's going to take a word
[55:04] based approach it just won't be the full
[55:07] word he says he's doing all kinds of
[55:09] things and the Bible said he'd be like a
[55:11] roaring lion devouring what he would
[55:13] he'd be so shrewd and cunning that he
[55:16] would deceive the very left if possible
[55:18] and then he repeats if possible we ought
[55:21] to take hope tonight that it's not
[55:23] possible for him to fully deceive the
[55:24] bride amen because by Grace God has said
[55:27] we're going to make it by Grace he said
[55:29] we'll be spotless we'll be pure we'll be
[55:31] a virgin bride to him but that doesn't
[55:33] stop Satan from trying
[55:35] he says but oh Lord Thou Art the
[55:37] protection of those who flee to thy
[55:40] bosom for a refuge amen there is a place
[55:42] to go when Satan comes in amen and it is
[55:45] to the lover that we have it is to our
[55:47] husband it is to our headship amen but
[55:50] listen what he's saying there he's
[55:51] saying that he's impersonating in the
[55:53] way of religion that's why I say it's
[55:55] not that Satan won't tempt our young
[55:57] people and even our middle-aged people
[55:59] with careers and with with entertainment
[56:01] and with money and with popularity and
[56:04] all of these different things influence
[56:05] and whatnot he's going to do that but by
[56:07] God's grace I believe we're well taught
[56:09] enough to recognize those almost
[56:11] immediately
[56:13] we ought to be able to recognize when
[56:15] it's something of the world and
[56:16] something that's of God up front when
[56:18] those things so we ought to be able to
[56:20] make the right call on those things but
[56:22] when we start talking now about a
[56:23] religious seduction about a religious
[56:26] deceit about coming from a religious
[56:27] Angle now we've got to be really careful
[56:30] we've got to know what the word says
[56:31] about every aspect of our life
[56:34] there is nothing in our lives that can't
[56:36] be reflected in the word of God and so
[56:39] we've all we've got to be able to bring
[56:40] it back to the word every single time in
[56:42] our decisions in our lives and our
[56:44] priorities and how we respond to things
[56:46] we've got to come back to the word
[56:48] because otherwise Satan will take an
[56:50] angle that gets us to tie the word Plus
[56:53] and that's his seduction is the word
[56:54] Plus
[56:56] brother Branham says Satan is not some
[56:59] big brute with a forked tail and forked
[57:01] hoofs he's a spirit and the Bible said
[57:04] he's so cunning that he would deceive
[57:06] the very elected if possible he is
[57:10] religious
[57:12] he's religious that means he can be in
[57:14] our midst
[57:16] and you not necessarily recognize him
[57:18] right away
[57:20] that means he can be in your life and
[57:21] you not recognize him immediately listen
[57:24] we look at Eve's motive we look at what
[57:27] brought Eve to the place where she would
[57:28] even listen to The Serpent and I believe
[57:30] Eve's motive was good to be fruitful and
[57:32] multiply to get to the place that God
[57:35] had told her to get and to get to the
[57:37] place where God could say Well done you
[57:38] did what I asked you to do you fulfilled
[57:41] the word and you stayed obedient to me I
[57:43] believe she had a great motive amen what
[57:46] turned her away
[57:47] we don't know but all I can say is
[57:49] something turned her away and she
[57:51] decided that there might be a different
[57:53] route and something got a hold of her
[57:55] ear and she got away from her headship
[57:57] she got away from her first love she got
[58:00] away from her husband she got away from
[58:02] her protection and when she did that now
[58:04] she was open to anybody who walked
[58:06] across her path
[58:08] listen all she needed was just a moment
[58:10] away and that serpent had a chance to
[58:12] have a talk with her and listen we may
[58:15] walk away from fellowship we may walk
[58:17] away from church we may walk away from
[58:18] the word once and nothing happens but if
[58:21] you keep doing it then Satan is watching
[58:23] and those demons are watching and the
[58:25] spirits of of his kingdom are watching
[58:26] and they're going to come and approach
[58:28] you at some point
[58:29] it's going to happen if you step away
[58:31] from your protection then something's
[58:34] going to happen
[58:35] prophet of God would say this he says
[58:37] Eve never just simply walked out
[58:39] willfully and said I don't believe in
[58:41] God
[58:43] he said no it was an error she believed
[58:48] Satan never come out and said oh well
[58:50] that's not even the word of God he
[58:52] admitted it was the word of God but he
[58:54] put his own interpretation to it
[58:58] which God plainly told them not to do it
[59:01] what does this do he says it makes a
[59:04] strong delusion for the people to
[59:06] believe a lie and be damned by it so
[59:09] we're talking about the characteristics
[59:11] of a seduction but I want you to
[59:13] understand that the condition that has
[59:15] first has to be met is you have to get
[59:17] away from the word you have to get away
[59:19] from your first love you have to get
[59:21] away from your protection and the minute
[59:23] you do that then you're fair game
[59:25] that's why you stay with the word at all
[59:27] times you don't make excuses for
[59:29] yourself you don't make excuses for the
[59:31] other person you stay with the word at
[59:34] all times you Brothers can you imagine
[59:36] if a man tried to sweet talk your wife
[59:39] while you were standing there what would
[59:40] you do
[59:42] you would punch him in the nose in
[59:44] Christian love
[59:45] you would not allow a man to sweet talk
[59:48] your wife in front of you
[59:50] and listen if Adam had stayed close to
[59:52] Eve if he had cleaved to her completely
[59:54] then that serpent would have never had
[59:56] the opportunity
[59:58] so wives or daughters don't walk away
[1:00:01] from your headship but I'm talking to
[1:00:03] husbands and and fathers tonight it's up
[1:00:05] to us to guard our homes it's up to us
[1:00:08] to guard our wives it's up to us to
[1:00:09] guard our children amen because we are
[1:00:12] the first line of defense between them
[1:00:14] and everything that Satan's going to
[1:00:15] throw what we let into our homes we
[1:00:17] answer for
[1:00:18] listen if we let our kids do things we
[1:00:20] answer for we let our wife do it we
[1:00:22] answer for it they don't answer for it
[1:00:24] but they pay the price
[1:00:26] they pay the price but we answer for it
[1:00:28] so we answer to him but guess what the
[1:00:30] effects the fruit of what we allow they
[1:00:33] they have to deal with that and
[1:00:34] sometimes the complexes they get and
[1:00:36] sometimes the the addictions they get go
[1:00:38] back completely to us as husbands and as
[1:00:40] as fathers because we've let down the
[1:00:43] bars because we haven't what held
[1:00:46] against that seducing spirit that says
[1:00:48] it's okay we've got it under control
[1:00:50] a seducing Spirit lets you think you're
[1:00:52] the one that's making the move lets you
[1:00:54] think that you're the one that's
[1:00:55] controlling the pace but they've got an
[1:00:56] ulterior motive at all times amen
[1:00:59] so brother Brandon is saying here that
[1:01:01] Eve didn't walk out looking to disobey
[1:01:03] God
[1:01:04] even look out go out looking for a
[1:01:06] different voice but guess what when you
[1:01:08] walk away a different voice will come to
[1:01:10] you eventually and you've got to decide
[1:01:12] if that's of God or if it's somebody
[1:01:13] else because when you're alone you're a
[1:01:15] target for the enemy I know I said last
[1:01:17] service that there's only one definition
[1:01:19] in the scripture for a sheep by itself
[1:01:20] and that is lost
[1:01:22] it's lost it's lost it's lost and your
[1:01:25] only protection is with the shepherd
[1:01:27] that's Christ
[1:01:29] and with the other sheep and that's the
[1:01:30] body of Christ amen we are of protection
[1:01:33] to each other listen even a herd of
[1:01:35] wolves can't get into a flock of sheep
[1:01:36] if they band together and just face
[1:01:38] outwardly they can't get at them when we
[1:01:41] stick together that's when our
[1:01:42] protection is amen and like I said you
[1:01:44] might not get attacked the first time
[1:01:46] you go out but given enough time a
[1:01:48] predator will come across your Trail and
[1:01:49] he'll track you down and he'll attack
[1:01:51] you and then you're going to be on your
[1:01:52] own and you're going to have to trust
[1:01:53] that a Shepherd is going to come grab
[1:01:54] you out of where you've gotten yourself
[1:01:56] listen it's interesting as a as a deacon
[1:02:00] for the many years that I did it when I
[1:02:01] was in in other places the first thing I
[1:02:03] notice is that when Satan got a hold of
[1:02:05] somebody they stopped coming to church
[1:02:07] it's the first thing you see dropping
[1:02:09] off is they don't make it to church
[1:02:11] where they did before and when we don't
[1:02:13] track Church attendance here and I'm not
[1:02:14] talking about that but I'm saying when
[1:02:16] somebody regularly attends and then
[1:02:17] stops attending even occasionally it's
[1:02:20] indicative of what a seducing spirit
[1:02:22] that has pulled them away from The
[1:02:23] Fellowship of the Saints
[1:02:25] brother Brown would say this he said
[1:02:27] then just as sure as Church time comes
[1:02:29] you just can't keep from coming to
[1:02:31] church that ought to be our testimony
[1:02:33] he says see you're just going to go up
[1:02:36] if you have to hobble by hook or by
[1:02:38] crook you're going to make it to church
[1:02:39] he says you're going to church because
[1:02:42] the spirit itself Bears record of
[1:02:45] gathering together in Christ Jesus why
[1:02:47] because you can't be in Christ and out
[1:02:49] of fellowship with the bride of Christ
[1:02:51] that's the simple truth
[1:02:53] amen that's the only way that you're
[1:02:54] going to be in this body is to be in
[1:02:56] this body and it's a mystical body and
[1:02:58] it's not just this church but it's a
[1:03:00] global group of Believers of like
[1:03:02] Precious faith that have the Holy Spirit
[1:03:04] that are gathered together for the
[1:03:06] hearing of the word amen you don't have
[1:03:08] to attend this church you don't have to
[1:03:09] hear air me preach you don't have to
[1:03:11] have me as your pastor but you need to
[1:03:13] have a church and you need to have a
[1:03:14] pastor even the rest of the fivefold
[1:03:16] ministry needs to have a pastor amen
[1:03:19] we're there to support one another we're
[1:03:20] there to put our shoulder to the wheel
[1:03:22] and when Satan can pull you away from
[1:03:24] being a servant then guess what happens
[1:03:26] you get really selfish and you get
[1:03:28] introspective and you get egocentric and
[1:03:31] it means you're all in it for you and
[1:03:32] you're not in it for anybody else and
[1:03:34] not only are you hurting them but you
[1:03:35] lost their help for you as well and
[1:03:37] nobody wins and everybody loses
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:41] listen I've seen it
[1:03:44] and what happens is if you actually
[1:03:45] survive out there you survive because
[1:03:48] you take on a goat nature
[1:03:50] why your ornery you're hard to be around
[1:03:54] and you hit anything that comes your way
[1:03:56] because that's what a goat does a go to
[1:03:58] go after anything that comes around it
[1:04:00] and that's the thing that survives is it
[1:04:02] just goes on the attack all the time and
[1:04:04] what happens is they can't get along
[1:04:05] with the people in the church and then
[1:04:06] they can't get along with their spouse
[1:04:07] and pretty soon they can't even get
[1:04:09] along with themselves
[1:04:10] and they're just grumpy and alone and
[1:04:12] they don't know why and then you go back
[1:04:14] to them and you ask what happened and
[1:04:15] they Point like Adam and Eve did to the
[1:04:17] one that was next to them well brother
[1:04:19] so-and-so did this her sister so and did
[1:04:21] this this or my past and we what is it
[1:04:24] everybody's looking at everybody else
[1:04:25] and nobody wants to look in the mirror
[1:04:27] and realize you made a decision
[1:04:30] you make a decision every single time
[1:04:33] how you're going to respond to
[1:04:34] situations and in the end whether we're
[1:04:36] in or whether we're out is our decision
[1:04:38] and we have to stand up and say that was
[1:04:41] my decision I am where I am because I
[1:04:43] chose to walk this path amen listen
[1:04:45] Church isn't always easy to attend
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] it's not always easy to attend the
[1:04:52] preaching isn't always to our liking
[1:04:55] listen I struggle sometimes with the
[1:04:57] things I say up here not just because
[1:04:59] sometimes they're hard but because then
[1:05:00] I have to not only say them but I have
[1:05:02] to apply them to my own life as well I
[1:05:04] get a double spanking
[1:05:07] and so and you know my nature that
[1:05:10] Germanic side listen I don't need a ton
[1:05:12] of encouragement I just need somebody to
[1:05:13] tell me what to do and I'll go do it
[1:05:15] whether it feels good or not that's my
[1:05:16] nature I appreciate the encouragement
[1:05:18] don't stop encouraging me but I'll do it
[1:05:21] whether you encourage me or not because
[1:05:22] that's the way I'm built
[1:05:24] but I have to really balance that and
[1:05:26] this is me speaking just just personally
[1:05:28] now I've got to find that balance in my
[1:05:30] preaching where I'm not just telling you
[1:05:31] to do it but I'm encouraging you how to
[1:05:33] do it and why you do it in these
[1:05:34] different things so that's where you
[1:05:36] need Grace with me because my nature is
[1:05:38] to just lay it in your lap and never
[1:05:39] encourage not never encourage but less
[1:05:42] often because I'm Duty driven I'm high
[1:05:44] performance driven and so that's all
[1:05:45] that works for me
[1:05:47] but I I ran across this quote I was I
[1:05:49] was trying to find something else and I
[1:05:51] thought I'd include it here because it
[1:05:52] it starts off feeling a little harsh and
[1:05:54] then brother Brown just just wraps it in
[1:05:56] such a beautiful little picture he says
[1:05:59] and that's what we come to church for
[1:06:01] is what
[1:06:03] to find out where our faults is
[1:06:06] and the things we might better ourselves
[1:06:08] by
[1:06:09] oh
[1:06:10] no
[1:06:14] he says if we come to church for any
[1:06:16] other objective than this I'm afraid we
[1:06:19] won't get much out of coming to church
[1:06:22] oh man the start of brother John's
[1:06:25] pastorship and this is what he's reading
[1:06:26] to us
[1:06:28] listen to this next line though he says
[1:06:30] we must come to find our weaknesses
[1:06:35] find our bad places
[1:06:38] and see how little we are
[1:06:41] but don't stop there
[1:06:44] because he says and put our trust in
[1:06:49] somebody that's strong Hallelujah that's
[1:06:53] why I come is not to know just where I'm
[1:06:56] wrong not to just know where I'm weak
[1:06:58] but to know that where I am weak Thou
[1:07:01] Art strong when I can't do it you can do
[1:07:04] it when I don't want to do it there's
[1:07:06] something inside of me that says do it
[1:07:08] anyhow
[1:07:09] that's why I'm here is the growing grace
[1:07:12] and it's his grace that tells me to
[1:07:15] change it's his grace that tells me you
[1:07:18] can't stay in that condition it's his
[1:07:20] grace that says you've got to come up
[1:07:22] higher son you've got to come up higher
[1:07:24] daughter you cannot stay here and go in
[1:07:27] a rapture
[1:07:28] that's why we come to church it is not
[1:07:31] to be just rubbed up and down and told
[1:07:33] we're amazing but it is to be told a son
[1:07:36] and a daughter of God does not live that
[1:07:38] way and there's a higher plane for you
[1:07:40] tonight
[1:07:41] that is why I come to church that is why
[1:07:43] I preach the way I do because that's
[1:07:46] what he's doing with me and my personal
[1:07:47] life you cannot stay in that condition
[1:07:50] and walk this road with me you got to
[1:07:53] come up a little higher and you got to
[1:07:55] lay it down you've got to die you've got
[1:07:57] to surrender you've got to give
[1:07:58] everything you've got and lay it aside
[1:08:00] and let the power of the Holy Ghost work
[1:08:02] through you that's why we come to church
[1:08:05] this is not a place for people that are
[1:08:07] perfect it is people that are called to
[1:08:09] be perfect before him
[1:08:11] amen I'm here because I'm called I don't
[1:08:13] come here to get actually accolades and
[1:08:16] and pats on the back but he gives it
[1:08:19] he does he lets us know we're doing good
[1:08:21] he gives us encouragement how many times
[1:08:23] have we sat in the pews and and
[1:08:26] something comes over the pulpit and
[1:08:27] we're able to say Thank You Lord that's
[1:08:29] what I did and that's how I did it and
[1:08:32] he encourages us but at the same time
[1:08:34] his love is always corrective and
[1:08:36] corrective means he'll tell you the
[1:08:37] right way to go he'll tell you the way
[1:08:39] to be he'll tell you the things to do in
[1:08:41] your life amen
[1:08:45] we're talking about the characteristics
[1:08:47] of Seduction and I'm starting with our
[1:08:49] part today because we have to get to a
[1:08:51] place where we can be seduced for Satan
[1:08:53] to ever have an effect in our life and
[1:08:55] so I'm talking about what we have to get
[1:08:57] out of so that he gets in and if we can
[1:09:00] stay where we're supposed to be if we
[1:09:01] can do what we're supposed to do then
[1:09:03] Satan has no access to you
[1:09:05] listen there's nobody going to seduce my
[1:09:07] wife if I'm constantly beside her
[1:09:10] only a stupid man
[1:09:11] would do that or a very very big mean
[1:09:14] man
[1:09:16] but nobody's going to do it all you have
[1:09:17] to do is say that's my wife and they'll
[1:09:19] walk away
[1:09:21] sometimes all we have to do is say
[1:09:24] I'd like you to meet my husband the word
[1:09:27] have you met Jesus Christ
[1:09:31] and Satan doesn't like that
[1:09:34] when you say can I introduce you to two
[1:09:36] or three Witnesses in Scripture
[1:09:38] that say that you're a liar
[1:09:40] then he backs away real quick but when
[1:09:42] we'll stop and listen for a while that's
[1:09:44] when he's got some he's got an effect
[1:09:46] amen that's why I say fathers watch your
[1:09:49] sons and daughters we are the first line
[1:09:50] of defense
[1:09:52] and listen the Holy Spirit does not
[1:09:53] compromise and it's in in in in what it
[1:09:56] tells us to do it does not compromise on
[1:09:59] the word of God and if our answer to the
[1:10:01] situation compromises on the word of God
[1:10:03] it's not the Holy Ghost
[1:10:05] it cannot be the Holy Ghost because the
[1:10:07] Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of
[1:10:09] God and it won't give us anything that's
[1:10:11] contrary to it amen listen we don't just
[1:10:14] need discernment as parents to see the
[1:10:15] effects but we need to see what the root
[1:10:18] cause of it listen we're coming into
[1:10:19] dandelion season hopefully in the next
[1:10:21] three to four months
[1:10:23] dandelions the bane of every man that
[1:10:27] wants to have a nice lawn or woman I
[1:10:29] guess
[1:10:30] what is it about dandelions that they
[1:10:33] grow faster than anything I know in the
[1:10:35] world because you see a dandelion and
[1:10:37] you reach down and you pluck the flower
[1:10:39] and two days later it has grown back
[1:10:42] completely and flowered and shedded
[1:10:45] seeds all over your lawn in two or three
[1:10:47] days
[1:10:48] why because you address the symptom of
[1:10:50] the dandelion rather than rooting it out
[1:10:53] and so you have to go to Canadian Tire
[1:10:55] you have to go get a steak knife and you
[1:10:57] get a machine or or something and you go
[1:10:59] in and you dig that thing out by the
[1:11:00] roots and you realize that a dandelion
[1:11:02] that's this tall has sometimes a root
[1:11:04] that's this deep and it's got a bunch of
[1:11:05] them stuck down inside of your lawn most
[1:11:08] of our grass is showing now and we
[1:11:10] walked over it the other day and I said
[1:11:11] to my wife I said look at all those
[1:11:13] little divots in our lawn it's from all
[1:11:15] the dandelions I pulled out that haven't
[1:11:16] grown back again
[1:11:18] sometimes it leaves holes in our lives
[1:11:20] when we dig things out
[1:11:21] and we've got to be okay and give give
[1:11:23] enough time for them to grow back and
[1:11:25] and produce what they're supposed to do
[1:11:27] but we've got to get to the root cause
[1:11:29] and that means parents we've got to be
[1:11:30] praying
[1:11:31] for each and every one of the situations
[1:11:34] we deal with with our children with our
[1:11:36] spouses these different things we've got
[1:11:38] to be praying parents because the answer
[1:11:39] for one is not always the answer for
[1:11:41] another the root cause for one is not
[1:11:43] always the root cause for another and so
[1:11:44] we've got to be able to go and find our
[1:11:46] answers for each child amen
[1:11:52] look at this
[1:11:54] brother Brian says Abraham trusted in
[1:11:56] God's word
[1:11:57] and we're children of Abraham today
[1:11:59] because we trust in God's word We
[1:12:01] Believe regardless of what people says
[1:12:04] and what the theologians say what
[1:12:07] Educators say science says if it's
[1:12:09] contrary to the word Every Man's word is
[1:12:11] a lie and God's is true it's the way I
[1:12:14] believe it and no matter how strange it
[1:12:16] may seem I believe it to be true anyhow
[1:12:19] listen in the way that is called heresy
[1:12:21] worship we today
[1:12:22] and don't ever expect the world to ever
[1:12:25] understand or acknowledge that the way
[1:12:27] we're doing things is going to be right
[1:12:28] fair or reasonable or have a good effect
[1:12:31] they just won't do it we're going to
[1:12:33] have to be able to stand and be counted
[1:12:35] Prophet God says this now it behooves us
[1:12:38] to stay spiritual
[1:12:39] now the problem with this is that we all
[1:12:41] have an idea of what spiritual means but
[1:12:43] can we let the prophet identify what
[1:12:45] spiritual means he says let us it
[1:12:47] behooves us to stay spiritual read the
[1:12:50] word
[1:12:52] that's where it starts because we can
[1:12:54] have gifts and we can have what we call
[1:12:55] leadership and we can have unctions and
[1:12:57] we can have visions and dreams and all
[1:12:59] these things but if it doesn't pull
[1:13:00] through the word then it can't be God so
[1:13:03] to be spiritual you have to know the
[1:13:04] word you have to know the scriptures he
[1:13:07] says and anything anything that rises
[1:13:10] outside contrary to that word then cast
[1:13:12] it aside you know what happens we get
[1:13:15] problems when spiritual people aren't
[1:13:18] actually living by the word they've got
[1:13:19] gifts they've got dreams they've got
[1:13:21] ideas they have all these things but
[1:13:23] they don't pull it through the word and
[1:13:24] all of a sudden they're off in this
[1:13:25] weird direction and you don't know why
[1:13:27] they're going that way and it's because
[1:13:28] they're spiritual but they're not
[1:13:30] reading their Bible
[1:13:31] really what that means is they're too
[1:13:33] lazy to go in and get the answer that
[1:13:34] God gave them and so they come up with a
[1:13:36] dream or a vision or this or that the
[1:13:38] other thing I don't believe we see those
[1:13:39] things in our church but it's out there
[1:13:42] I was commenting to my wife the other
[1:13:43] day and she shared a few things with me
[1:13:45] over time and I'm seeing this among
[1:13:47] professing message Believers and
[1:13:49] professing Christians and the repeating
[1:13:51] things and they're sharing things on
[1:13:52] social media that are completely
[1:13:54] contrary to scripture
[1:13:57] completely contrary to scripture
[1:13:59] completely contrary to what a prophet of
[1:14:01] God came and told us and yet because it
[1:14:03] sounds good
[1:14:04] or it looks good or it responds to a
[1:14:07] situation in a way they think it should
[1:14:09] they'll post it and they'll repeat it
[1:14:11] and you look at that and you say oh my
[1:14:13] goodness what are you thinking
[1:14:15] what is it because it appealed to their
[1:14:17] senses they were seduced enough that
[1:14:20] they would repost it and share with a
[1:14:21] bunch of people now listen it's one
[1:14:23] thing if if all your friends are message
[1:14:25] Believers and they kind of just say oh
[1:14:27] whatever I know where she's coming from
[1:14:28] where he's coming from but if you've got
[1:14:30] an unbelieving friend or a
[1:14:31] bible-believing friend that reads their
[1:14:32] Bible and they see you posting something
[1:14:34] that's completely off the scripture what
[1:14:36] does that do for our testimony
[1:14:39] because they say I thought that they
[1:14:40] were a Christian and then they're
[1:14:41] posting something and even I know better
[1:14:43] than that and they always tell me they
[1:14:44] know so much and they've got this
[1:14:46] Revelation that Revelation and then they
[1:14:48] look at that and they can't even see the
[1:14:49] falseness behind it because it's always
[1:14:51] just a little bit off
[1:14:52] it's rarely completely off it's just
[1:14:54] that little tinge in it and you stop and
[1:14:56] you say that's not quite right there
[1:14:58] ought to be a check in US
[1:15:00] that'll be a balance in us that says hey
[1:15:02] I better check that with the word before
[1:15:03] I share these things
[1:15:04] listen it's it's a seducing spirit that
[1:15:07] makes people want to sound great and
[1:15:09] sound good rather than actually be in
[1:15:11] line with the word
[1:15:12] and that's what's pulling people into it
[1:15:14] social media is all about image it's all
[1:15:15] about appearance and these people aren't
[1:15:17] actively trying to leave the word
[1:15:18] they're just not applying it in this
[1:15:21] part of their life and so people are
[1:15:23] looking at that and your testimony gets
[1:15:24] smeared because you didn't take the time
[1:15:25] to check it with the word of God
[1:15:29] Paul warns us about this he says in
[1:15:31] second Timothy 3 says this know also
[1:15:33] that in the last days perilous times
[1:15:36] shall come
[1:15:37] listen we're in the last day so that
[1:15:39] means we're in perilous times right now
[1:15:41] that means it's dangerous for your
[1:15:42] Christian walk it's dangerous for your
[1:15:44] Christian testimony it's dangerous for
[1:15:46] our young people it's dangerous for our
[1:15:47] families it's dangerous for the church
[1:15:49] body today
[1:15:51] because he says this is when the most
[1:15:52] perilous times are going to come and
[1:15:55] Satan is only looking sometimes just to
[1:15:57] put a smear on your testimony
[1:15:59] just to take away your influence just to
[1:16:02] take away that thing that people admired
[1:16:04] enough so that they turn away he's just
[1:16:06] looking to get a little bit of dirt on
[1:16:07] you
[1:16:08] that's it just a just a whiff of
[1:16:11] something is enough to sometimes turn
[1:16:13] people away
[1:16:14] he says why for men shall be lovers of
[1:16:16] their own selves Covetous bolsters proud
[1:16:19] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:16:22] unthankful and Unholy I've got to go to
[1:16:24] work two days a week these days and I'll
[1:16:26] tell you the hardest thing for me to
[1:16:28] take is the cursing and The Taking of
[1:16:30] God's name in vain everybody does it men
[1:16:33] and women alike
[1:16:34] and it's horrible it is rampant it's
[1:16:38] amazing if you spend time around worldly
[1:16:40] adults almost every other sentence is a
[1:16:42] curse word it's just built into them
[1:16:45] it's a sign of the end times
[1:16:47] listen everybody's doing it it says
[1:16:49] without natural affection truce Breakers
[1:16:52] false accusers incontinent that word
[1:16:54] incontinent means no self-control unable
[1:16:58] to tame their emotions or base nature or
[1:17:01] desires
[1:17:04] it says they'll be fierce
[1:17:06] listen social media has turned people
[1:17:08] crazy they're willing to fight over
[1:17:09] anything or nothing at the drop of a hat
[1:17:12] they're willing to fight somebody else's
[1:17:13] fight for them having never known that
[1:17:15] person never actually knowing what's
[1:17:16] right or wrong they'll just jump in and
[1:17:18] wait in and fight for somebody else it's
[1:17:20] a big mess it's a dog's breakfast as
[1:17:22] they say
[1:17:23] despisers of those that are good listen
[1:17:25] you can't even do anything right anymore
[1:17:27] with somebody without somebody coming
[1:17:28] and criticizing it brother Brown would
[1:17:31] say they call you Holy Rollers even
[1:17:33] within the Christian ranks
[1:17:35] Traders heady high-minded lovers of
[1:17:39] pleasure more than lovers of self now
[1:17:41] cash is because we would say these are
[1:17:42] people in the world these are sinners
[1:17:44] these are unbelievers that Paul is
[1:17:46] talking about
[1:17:47] look at the next scripture verse 5 he
[1:17:50] says having a form of godliness but
[1:17:53] denying the power thereof Church These
[1:17:55] are professing Christians these are
[1:17:56] professing believers that have these
[1:17:58] characteristics
[1:17:59] how did they get there
[1:18:02] it doesn't happen overnight
[1:18:05] but something turned them and in the end
[1:18:07] their last condition is worse than their
[1:18:10] first they're too full full more a child
[1:18:12] of Hell than when they started and yet
[1:18:14] they are religious they're under a
[1:18:15] different anointing they're under a
[1:18:17] different Spirit than they think amen
[1:18:19] listen these are people that are
[1:18:20] baptized these are people that attend
[1:18:22] church Faithfully that pay their tithes
[1:18:24] these are supposed faithful Christians
[1:18:26] and yet they're completely off the word
[1:18:28] why because they'd rather believe a lie
[1:18:31] than the truth that hurts because they
[1:18:33] want affirmation rather than correction
[1:18:36] and in the end that's why you'll break
[1:18:38] your promise and that's why you won't
[1:18:39] hold yourself to anything you don't hold
[1:18:41] yourself to a word standard you don't
[1:18:42] hold yourself responsible to the local
[1:18:44] body you don't do anything you're just
[1:18:46] Rogue you're just running around doing
[1:18:47] your own thing
[1:18:49] that's it
[1:18:51] listen it says from such turn away
[1:18:56] that means it can be in our midst
[1:18:58] that means Satan's trying to get this on
[1:19:00] me
[1:19:01] and this on you every single day he's
[1:19:04] trying to get you to the place where
[1:19:05] Paul would would have this very same
[1:19:06] description of us Prophet God says oh my
[1:19:09] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:19:12] the power thereof from such turn away he
[1:19:15] says get away from it and stay away from
[1:19:17] it
[1:19:19] sometimes you've got to move and then
[1:19:21] you've got to stay moved
[1:19:23] he says get out to God and pray through
[1:19:26] to God and stay right with God he says
[1:19:29] live for God but I feel the time has
[1:19:32] come friends when something's got to be
[1:19:34] said he says and Friends turn away from
[1:19:36] your ways there is no halfway Christians
[1:19:39] you're just fooling yourself see you're
[1:19:42] either a Christian or a sinner as I said
[1:19:44] you never did see a drunk sober man
[1:19:46] you're either drunk or sober he's saying
[1:19:49] what get in or get out but don't pretend
[1:19:52] you're both at the same time because you
[1:19:54] can't be both at the same time
[1:19:57] listen if you're on the fence the fence
[1:19:58] belongs to Satan
[1:20:00] there is no neutral ground because those
[1:20:01] that aren't for us are against us Christ
[1:20:03] said
[1:20:05] brother Brian would say the social
[1:20:06] gospel
[1:20:08] denying the blood
[1:20:11] denying the need for the blood
[1:20:13] denying the power denying the Holy Ghost
[1:20:17] and all he says but thank God there is
[1:20:20] some who does believe it listen church
[1:20:22] this message we believe is not a social
[1:20:24] gospel this is not a community this is
[1:20:27] not group think this is not something
[1:20:29] we've come up with on our own this is
[1:20:31] life this is not a life this is life
[1:20:35] itself this is the very Source within us
[1:20:37] that drives us day in and day out this
[1:20:39] is a day in and day out experience
[1:20:41] that's supposed to be bubbling out of us
[1:20:43] it's that unquenchable fire that we've
[1:20:45] talked about it's not a social gospel
[1:20:47] amen this must Rule and reign in our
[1:20:49] hearts
[1:20:51] it's got to it's got to otherwise we're
[1:20:54] half in and half out and that means
[1:20:56] we're out
[1:20:58] it's time to decide am I in or am I out
[1:21:01] because listen time is running short
[1:21:05] brother Graham says puts in mind of the
[1:21:07] church no matter how much you substitute
[1:21:09] how big a congregation you get how well
[1:21:11] you sing your songs how good your
[1:21:13] congregation dresses how much you got
[1:21:15] this that or the other you could strike
[1:21:17] or feel or whatever it'll never take the
[1:21:19] place of life until Christ comes down in
[1:21:22] the form of the Holy Ghost into that
[1:21:25] church and gives it a new experience of
[1:21:27] being born again it'll never take the
[1:21:30] place of God's word God's word stands
[1:21:33] alone
[1:21:35] listen we're talking about our condition
[1:21:37] and where we have to be and where we
[1:21:38] have to stay in order to keep from
[1:21:40] giving Satan access to us but as part of
[1:21:42] that protection we have to realize that
[1:21:44] this is first and foremost an individual
[1:21:46] affair
[1:21:48] we do not get into our rapture we do not
[1:21:50] get married to Christ as a base on the
[1:21:53] basis of who's sitting next to us in our
[1:21:55] pews it has to be one-on-one amen you
[1:21:58] walk with God Amen your first step is
[1:22:00] with Christ and then your second is
[1:22:02] you're baptized into that body
[1:22:03] amen first is with him and second it's
[1:22:05] with the rest of us and we're all United
[1:22:07] and we work together amen but there's an
[1:22:09] individual Affair and you've got to be
[1:22:11] led you've got to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:22:13] your life you've got to be able to hear
[1:22:15] that still Small Voice that we were
[1:22:16] singing about so much in the service
[1:22:18] before I came up here this morning or
[1:22:20] this afternoon amen listen You'll never
[1:22:22] be able to work effectively until you've
[1:22:24] settled in your heart I've got the Holy
[1:22:26] Ghost and I've got a new birth and I
[1:22:28] know that I've been changed from what I
[1:22:30] was to what I am here today
[1:22:32] brother Brown would continue he would
[1:22:33] say having a form of godliness but
[1:22:35] denying the power thereof the power that
[1:22:38] can deliver you from this haunt this
[1:22:41] present World System he says from such
[1:22:43] turn away don't care what the rest of
[1:22:45] the people says it's you as an
[1:22:47] individual before God you've got to
[1:22:51] answer
[1:22:52] no matter what this woman does or that
[1:22:54] woman does or this man does or that man
[1:22:57] does or this preacher says or that
[1:22:58] preacher says it's you and God he says
[1:23:01] having a form after tradition but
[1:23:04] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:23:06] away he says are we living in that day
[1:23:09] we sure are
[1:23:11] I I was looking up that that phrase
[1:23:14] denying the power thereof and brother
[1:23:16] Branham hits it well over a hundred
[1:23:18] times and most of the time when he talks
[1:23:20] about it he says that means to deny that
[1:23:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:23:25] and forever
[1:23:27] and how do we do it we make it about
[1:23:29] Doctrine
[1:23:31] we make it about what church we attend
[1:23:33] we make it about what Ministry we sit
[1:23:34] under we make it about how we dress and
[1:23:36] all of these different things and he
[1:23:38] says no it's the word being manifested
[1:23:41] in your life that's what the power is
[1:23:44] I was talking to brother Ed
[1:23:46] hammermeister and he said we're we're
[1:23:47] seeing a real transition in the message
[1:23:50] to where people are less focused on on
[1:23:52] individuals and Ministries and these
[1:23:54] things and they're focused on
[1:23:55] manifesting the word of God
[1:23:58] we've had so many powerful Ministries
[1:24:00] and we've had so many uh celebrities and
[1:24:02] these things and I'm not saying it's bad
[1:24:03] but that was really through the we saw
[1:24:05] in the 70s and 80s you know really
[1:24:07] keeping the church together and guarding
[1:24:09] them and very powerful men very powerful
[1:24:11] Ministries but what we're seeing now is
[1:24:13] what it's breaking into smaller groups
[1:24:15] and it's breaking into nobodies but it's
[1:24:17] now breaking into the ranks of the
[1:24:18] people where they realize that what
[1:24:20] they've got the Holy Ghost just the way
[1:24:22] the ministry does not in the same
[1:24:24] anointing and not with the same purpose
[1:24:25] but it's no less the Holy Ghost in their
[1:24:27] life and they're supposed to be
[1:24:28] something happening in the laity's life
[1:24:30] not just in the ministry's life these
[1:24:33] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:24:34] listen that's why when sister Betty came
[1:24:36] up it wasn't just me praying and it
[1:24:39] wasn't just the elders praying it was
[1:24:40] the whole church praying because there
[1:24:42] is power when the body is Unified in
[1:24:44] prayer and when we ask something of God
[1:24:46] together that means it's got to be all
[1:24:48] of us together pulling the load here
[1:24:50] it's not just me it's not just the
[1:24:52] ministry it's not just the the elected
[1:24:54] officers it's everybody coming in on
[1:24:56] this and that's when we see the results
[1:24:57] the Great results
[1:25:00] how much Faith do I have it's it is what
[1:25:02] it is but when we all add it together I
[1:25:04] guarantee all of us together have more
[1:25:05] than I do by myself
[1:25:07] and that's why we want these things
[1:25:08] that's why we want the people to see
[1:25:10] that as an individual you have power
[1:25:12] with God and through God through the
[1:25:14] Holy Spirit that's in your life
[1:25:15] quickening the word to you and through
[1:25:17] you each and every one of us young and
[1:25:20] old men and women alike God is working
[1:25:22] through his bride each and every one
[1:25:26] world religions will say they'll say as
[1:25:28] long as you've accepted Christ as your
[1:25:29] savior then that's all you have to worry
[1:25:31] about can you imagine how miserable it
[1:25:33] is if that's the only place we get to
[1:25:35] where we accept the free work of Grace
[1:25:37] but yet we never change
[1:25:38] we stay the same nothing ever moves we
[1:25:41] never give Victory listen it's not just
[1:25:43] a life that that that that that takes
[1:25:45] away our sins our blood that covers amen
[1:25:47] but it's a life that changes us from a
[1:25:50] fallen son and daughter into a
[1:25:52] manifested son and daughter of God Amen
[1:25:54] it's a life that not only separates us
[1:25:56] and cleanses the effects of rock and
[1:25:58] roll and drugs and alcohol and and all
[1:26:01] these different things that are in the
[1:26:02] world but it's a life that takes the
[1:26:03] very desire for those things out of us
[1:26:05] so that we now have a desire to do
[1:26:07] something else in our life so that
[1:26:09] instead of fighting what sin wants us to
[1:26:11] do now we're fighting to do what God
[1:26:12] wants us to do that there's something in
[1:26:14] us that's driving us forward and that's
[1:26:16] the life that we're looking for is
[1:26:18] something that that pushes us forward I
[1:26:20] was listening to Brother John Andes and
[1:26:22] and he preached a sermon a long time ago
[1:26:24] called come and then this last this last
[1:26:26] weekend he preached one called go
[1:26:28] come and get the change that you need
[1:26:30] and then go and do something with it and
[1:26:32] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[1:26:33] is we come and we get what we need but
[1:26:35] then we come to a place and it's
[1:26:37] adoption where God says now it's time
[1:26:39] for you to start working for me child
[1:26:40] and that's where we'll go when we get
[1:26:42] back to our our Redemption series amen
[1:26:45] but I want you to understand that these
[1:26:46] things that Paul talked about in heady
[1:26:48] and high-minded and Traders and all
[1:26:50] these things that is not a place where
[1:26:51] you can grow in God
[1:26:53] if that spirit's got you in a hold in a
[1:26:55] headlock you're not going anywhere
[1:26:57] you've got to break that Spirit you've
[1:26:59] got to break that effect you've got to
[1:27:00] break that influence before you can ever
[1:27:01] go anywhere because otherwise you're
[1:27:03] going to be internally focused and
[1:27:05] that'll never make you the kind of
[1:27:06] Christian that God wants us to be
[1:27:09] listen if Satan think of this if Satan
[1:27:11] can get us to stand still he's one
[1:27:14] that's all he's trying to do remember
[1:27:16] the prophet said footsteps is possession
[1:27:18] and I've said this many times all you're
[1:27:21] trying to do is get one step a day
[1:27:23] get one step more into your property
[1:27:25] give one more step that you haven't
[1:27:26] taken before and Satan's objective is to
[1:27:28] keep you from moving forward and if he
[1:27:31] can hold you steady then he is one
[1:27:34] because why you're supposed to be
[1:27:35] progressing you're supposed to be mature
[1:27:37] and you're supposed to be changing
[1:27:38] so keep fighting for that one step if
[1:27:40] only it's one step a day get that one
[1:27:42] step a day get that one Victory a day
[1:27:44] move forward and press the battle just a
[1:27:46] little bit more
[1:27:49] Paul continues in second Timothy he says
[1:27:51] for this of this sort these type of
[1:27:54] people are they which creep into houses
[1:27:56] and Lead captive silly women laid him
[1:27:59] with sins LED away with diver's lusts
[1:28:02] notice this is a seducing spirit it's a
[1:28:05] man going into a woman's house and she
[1:28:07] ain't his wife and he ain't her husband
[1:28:09] it's a seducing Spirit that's doing
[1:28:11] these things and we know that as Eve was
[1:28:13] seduced in Genesis the churches are
[1:28:15] being seduced by Satan today to the
[1:28:17] point where he can sit in the
[1:28:18] congregation being worshiped as God and
[1:28:19] they don't know it that's what the
[1:28:21] scripture says amen but watch now
[1:28:23] because he's talking about women being
[1:28:25] Laden with sins and led away and the
[1:28:27] these men come into their lives and it's
[1:28:29] not talking about women it's talking
[1:28:31] about churches
[1:28:34] it's talking about organizations it's
[1:28:35] talking about groups of people that get
[1:28:37] what they get under this this need for a
[1:28:40] certain type of thing and they're LED
[1:28:42] Away by their own desires and what
[1:28:43] happens is they end up
[1:28:45] what unmarried
[1:28:47] but soiled and nobody wants them anymore
[1:28:51] he says what ever learning and never
[1:28:54] able to come to the knowledge of The
[1:28:55] Truth Listen a man that'll do that he'll
[1:28:58] say anything you want him to say to stay
[1:29:00] in influence and stay in power and take
[1:29:02] your money and all these different
[1:29:03] things
[1:29:04] so first sign of seducing spirit is that
[1:29:06] it'll tell you whatever you want to hear
[1:29:11] I want to stop here because we see a
[1:29:12] trend
[1:29:14] and Paul's pointing to this seduction he
[1:29:16] and he points to the women falling for
[1:29:17] it and we don't look at our women and
[1:29:19] say there you go sisters look out
[1:29:21] because we're all a part of the bride of
[1:29:23] Christ
[1:29:24] we're all a part of the bride of Christ
[1:29:25] listen we are typed as a bride in the
[1:29:27] scripture so that means all of us are
[1:29:29] under a nature that can be seduced
[1:29:31] Naturally Speaking
[1:29:33] that means that we are the target
[1:29:36] he's not trying to seduce Christ he
[1:29:37] already tried that and it didn't work so
[1:29:39] now he's coming to seduce us and each
[1:29:41] and every one of us is potentially
[1:29:43] susceptible to this seduction
[1:29:45] and it's a spirit that'll tell us what
[1:29:47] we want to hear because what does any
[1:29:49] time if you've ever talked to somebody
[1:29:51] that's Fallen by seduction that's that's
[1:29:52] cheated on somebody or or let a man take
[1:29:55] advantage of them what do they say that
[1:29:56] man did the first thing he did was tell
[1:29:58] them whatever they wanted to hear
[1:30:00] whatever they wanted to talk about they
[1:30:02] talked about it whatever issue they had
[1:30:04] they sat there and they commiserated
[1:30:06] listen sometimes women just want an
[1:30:08] agreeable listening ear
[1:30:10] that's all they want they want somebody
[1:30:12] to say you're right you're right you're
[1:30:13] so right yes absolutely
[1:30:16] and never challenge them in any way and
[1:30:18] just agree with them and you do that and
[1:30:20] they feel validated and they feel
[1:30:22] supported and they feel all these things
[1:30:23] and they'll get to the point now where
[1:30:25] they're they're putty in your hand
[1:30:26] they'll do whatever you want because you
[1:30:28] you you you approved of them where
[1:30:30] they're at and what they're saying in
[1:30:32] these different things I dropped in just
[1:30:34] for like five minutes to listen to
[1:30:35] brother Donnie Reagan the other day and
[1:30:37] he said this thing he said Satan will
[1:30:39] convince you of his sincerity and his
[1:30:42] concern about your situation or
[1:30:44] condition
[1:30:45] that's the seducing Spirit that's what
[1:30:47] he was doing with Eve oh Eve you're
[1:30:50] trying to be fruitful and multiply
[1:30:53] it's tough isn't it
[1:30:55] have you what about this tree of
[1:30:57] knowledge of Good and Evil have you ever
[1:30:59] ever considered that
[1:31:01] what did God say about that well he said
[1:31:02] don't touch it
[1:31:04] oh yeah but
[1:31:05] why do you think he said that
[1:31:08] do you think that maybe God's got a
[1:31:09] motive here that maybe isn't good
[1:31:13] sounds silly the god of love the god
[1:31:16] that created them the god that that gave
[1:31:17] them everything they had would somehow
[1:31:19] withhold something that would keep them
[1:31:20] from fulfilling his word but in the end
[1:31:22] he he got into her head
[1:31:25] and he got her to the point where she
[1:31:26] said you know what
[1:31:27] you're right
[1:31:29] God's got it out for me this is the way
[1:31:31] to go God's been holding me back
[1:31:34] she got to the place where she literally
[1:31:35] thought that God was holding her back
[1:31:37] listen I want to put it this way
[1:31:39] a seducing spirit is an echo chamber
[1:31:43] it repeats back what you say without a
[1:31:46] challenge
[1:31:48] without any sort of a a pushback it just
[1:31:52] says exactly what you say and repeats it
[1:31:54] back and validates you where you're at
[1:31:56] that's a seducing spirit
[1:31:58] listen as friends you'll know somebody's
[1:32:01] your real friend the first time they say
[1:32:03] all right when you say something that's
[1:32:05] off the word
[1:32:07] up till then it's just friendship
[1:32:10] but when you get into Fellowship now we
[1:32:12] can talk
[1:32:13] and you can say sorry brother John
[1:32:16] I don't think you're quite right on that
[1:32:18] because
[1:32:20] not because I feel
[1:32:22] not because I think
[1:32:24] but because thus say at the word and
[1:32:26] you'll point me back to the word every
[1:32:28] time you're not an echo chamber listen
[1:32:30] it's wonderful when we have fellowship
[1:32:32] and we're all in agreement isn't it
[1:32:34] but sometimes Fellowship means we have
[1:32:35] to correct as well
[1:32:37] and we have to tighten things up a
[1:32:38] little bit as iron sharpness iron the
[1:32:40] scripture says that's half the reason
[1:32:42] why we're in a body is because what we
[1:32:44] need that sharpening
[1:32:46] listen we've been around Church long
[1:32:48] enough to know that guess what sometimes
[1:32:50] it's not always fun being in the body
[1:32:52] and listen the bad things that happen to
[1:32:55] us in church are just as important as
[1:32:56] the good things because what it does is
[1:32:58] it shapes us and it molds us into better
[1:33:01] Christians that are more reflective of
[1:33:03] the word of God and the love of Christ
[1:33:05] the good and the bad are equally
[1:33:06] important in a body like this that
[1:33:08] friction sometimes is what some of the
[1:33:10] best things we can have because it
[1:33:11] proves Who You Are
[1:33:13] I'll tell you one of the one of the the
[1:33:15] neatest things I had happen in this
[1:33:17] church
[1:33:18] was a brother called me and said I
[1:33:21] messed up and I need help on figuring
[1:33:23] out how to make it right had nothing to
[1:33:25] do with me or anything like that and
[1:33:26] that's all I say about it that to me
[1:33:30] I was like wow
[1:33:33] wow
[1:33:34] when somebody can humble themselves and
[1:33:36] say I messed up and I need your help to
[1:33:38] make it right
[1:33:39] I'm like that is a believer
[1:33:43] because they're not all about ego
[1:33:44] they're all they're not about the front
[1:33:46] they put up they're not about their
[1:33:47] reputation they're about getting things
[1:33:49] made right
[1:33:51] and it absolutely amazed me and I was so
[1:33:54] so proud I don't know why I'd be proud
[1:33:56] of it but I was just like wow that's the
[1:33:58] caliber of people we have in this
[1:33:59] congregation
[1:34:00] and it's happened many times with
[1:34:02] different people where they'll come up
[1:34:03] and they'll say either I think
[1:34:05] something's off or I did something off
[1:34:07] and they make it right
[1:34:09] and I've had people come to me and say
[1:34:11] you are off
[1:34:12] and you need to make it right and guess
[1:34:14] what that's got to be okay as well
[1:34:15] that's what happens inside of a body is
[1:34:17] we're sharpening each other we're
[1:34:19] actually making each other better and we
[1:34:20] don't get that in an echo chamber a
[1:34:22] seducing Spirit never improves you it
[1:34:25] says you're great just the way you are
[1:34:26] and that's why you don't try moving
[1:34:28] forward because you think you're good
[1:34:29] enough where you're at why would you
[1:34:31] change if you're already great
[1:34:34] listen the holy spirit will always point
[1:34:36] us back to the word
[1:34:38] both as confirmation
[1:34:40] and correction
[1:34:41] so if you're right the holy spirit will
[1:34:43] say you're right because the word says
[1:34:46] and if you're wrong the holy spirit will
[1:34:48] say you're wrong because the word says
[1:34:50] but the Holy Spirit doesn't just tell us
[1:34:52] to do things it points us back to the
[1:34:54] word because that's where our foundation
[1:34:56] is that's where our absolute is
[1:34:58] and so if we're making decisions and we
[1:35:00] have no word for it I would recommend
[1:35:02] this stay until you get the word for it
[1:35:05] I'm not saying you're wrong I'm saying
[1:35:07] stay until you get the word for your
[1:35:09] decision because now you've got an
[1:35:10] anchor now you've got a foundation now
[1:35:12] you've got something sure to go back to
[1:35:14] and you can say Lord this is what I'm
[1:35:16] basing my decision on Lord this is what
[1:35:18] I'm basing my leadership on because your
[1:35:20] word says and it doesn't just say it
[1:35:22] once but it says it from Genesis to
[1:35:24] Revelation don't take one take two or
[1:35:26] three that's what the scripture says a
[1:35:27] Witnesses out of the mouth the two or
[1:35:29] three Witnesses out of the mouth of two
[1:35:30] or three scriptures get your foundation
[1:35:32] and then Satan can trip you up because
[1:35:35] remember with Jesus he tried one
[1:35:36] scripture at a time
[1:35:39] but if he would have read the ones
[1:35:40] before and the ones after then it
[1:35:41] wouldn't have worked so he only pulled
[1:35:43] out the one and that's what he'll do is
[1:35:44] he'll give you one scripture but you've
[1:35:46] got to get it in context and you've got
[1:35:48] to read it from Genesis to Revelation
[1:35:49] you've got to get aligned gun sites you
[1:35:51] got to have at least two
[1:35:53] otherwise it could mean anything you can
[1:35:55] make it mean anything
[1:35:56] brother Brown put it this way he says
[1:35:58] look so many people are listening to
[1:36:00] enticing Spirits instead of taking the
[1:36:03] word of God
[1:36:04] Spirits there in the world they're
[1:36:06] demons and they go out into places and
[1:36:08] they get amongst men and ministers
[1:36:11] guess what I gotta look out doubly so
[1:36:16] because if he can get me off then I can
[1:36:18] spread that to an entire church
[1:36:20] husbands fathers if he can get us off he
[1:36:22] can spread it to our entire families
[1:36:25] he says they go out into places and they
[1:36:27] get amongst men ministers they get
[1:36:29] amongst church members they get amongst
[1:36:31] good people
[1:36:33] and they cause them to come into to an
[1:36:37] illusion and they say things and do
[1:36:40] things and teach things and practice
[1:36:43] things that's contrary to the word of
[1:36:46] God what's an illusion
[1:36:49] something that appears real but isn't
[1:36:52] it's a pretense it's a fake it has no
[1:36:54] substance and that's the great letdown
[1:36:56] at the end of a seduction is that you
[1:36:58] realize it wasn't real in the first
[1:36:59] place that man didn't really love me
[1:37:02] that person isn't really my friend
[1:37:05] why because they were in it for
[1:37:07] themselves not for you and when that
[1:37:09] whole facade crumbles it hurts
[1:37:12] listen I have been hurt by Ministries
[1:37:15] I've been hurt by Believers I've been
[1:37:16] hurt by church people I've been hurt by
[1:37:18] family I've been in had so many
[1:37:21] disappointments and on the flip side
[1:37:23] I've caused disappointments to people
[1:37:25] I've caused disappointments to ministers
[1:37:27] I've caused disappointments to family
[1:37:28] I've been on both sides of it and that
[1:37:30] is sometimes the hardest thing to handle
[1:37:32] is when it crumbles and you're not what
[1:37:34] you thought they thought you were and
[1:37:36] they're not what you thought they were
[1:37:38] and often what happens is the letdown is
[1:37:41] so sharp because we put them in a place
[1:37:43] that we ought not to have
[1:37:46] I appreciate each and every one here but
[1:37:48] if I get you two lifted up or you get me
[1:37:49] too lifted up God's Gonna Knock us down
[1:37:51] a little bit because he won't share his
[1:37:53] glory with anyone and then he wants to
[1:37:55] work through you he doesn't want you to
[1:37:56] take his place
[1:37:58] and these things listen anything
[1:38:01] that points you to a man is a seducing
[1:38:04] spirit
[1:38:05] 100 percent
[1:38:07] so if a Ministry keeps pointing you to
[1:38:08] him or his church that man's under a
[1:38:10] seducing spirit and anybody that points
[1:38:13] you to a man anyone that says I've got
[1:38:14] all the answers this one has this and no
[1:38:16] no no that's a seducing spirit because
[1:38:18] that belongs to God and God Alone
[1:38:21] Paul would say this
[1:38:23] and I Brethren when I came to you came
[1:38:25] not with Excellency of speech or of
[1:38:27] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:38:29] of God listen when I when I hear Paul
[1:38:31] talk about himself I sometimes wonder if
[1:38:33] we'd even have him preached in our
[1:38:34] churches
[1:38:36] Paul was not a good speaker listen Paul
[1:38:38] put eudicus to sleep
[1:38:42] Paul was not a big Dynamic minister
[1:38:45] we wouldn't say he had a gift
[1:38:48] as an or-raider
[1:38:51] that people will be drawn by the way he
[1:38:52] spoke his sermons
[1:38:55] listen uticus literally fell asleep
[1:38:57] while Paul was droning on and on and on
[1:38:59] Not only was Paul a bad speaker but he
[1:39:01] was a long-winded bad speaker
[1:39:03] how many of us would have Paul in our
[1:39:05] church based on that
[1:39:07] and yet you look at what he said
[1:39:10] I mean amazing the things that he said
[1:39:13] but he says I didn't come to you with
[1:39:15] Excellency of speech or wisdom
[1:39:17] Paul didn't have a
[1:39:19] a big following because of his
[1:39:21] dynamicism
[1:39:23] he says for I determined not to know
[1:39:26] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[1:39:29] him crucified
[1:39:30] and I was with you in weakness and in
[1:39:32] fear and much trembling and my speech
[1:39:35] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:39:37] words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:39:39] demonstration of the power of the spirit
[1:39:41] and the power listen Paul might have put
[1:39:43] uticus to sleep so that he fell out of
[1:39:45] the window and died
[1:39:47] but then Paul had power to raise him up
[1:39:49] again that's the kind of preacher Paul
[1:39:51] was he might put you to sleep with his
[1:39:52] preaching but he always made sure you
[1:39:54] wake up in the end
[1:39:55] I'll take that preacher anytime
[1:39:57] somebody that's got what the real life
[1:39:59] of God inside of him and isn't just a
[1:40:01] bag of wind
[1:40:02] he says why why did I do it that way he
[1:40:05] says that your faith should not stand in
[1:40:07] the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:40:10] God what was it Paul didn't want
[1:40:11] people's eyes on him
[1:40:13] before Paul got saved all he cared about
[1:40:16] was his image he talked about it
[1:40:18] remember he says earlier he says bear
[1:40:20] with me and my Folly but you think you
[1:40:22] were great I was greater you think you
[1:40:24] were from a great place I was from a
[1:40:25] greater family you think you were this
[1:40:27] well I was better he said bear with me
[1:40:29] and my Folly now this is how I used to
[1:40:30] think whatever you think you're good at
[1:40:32] I was better
[1:40:34] and yet now Paul says now I don't want
[1:40:36] anything to do with me
[1:40:37] I don't want you to look at me in any
[1:40:39] way but I want you to only know Jesus
[1:40:41] Christ and him crucified and raised
[1:40:43] again and see the power of him in my
[1:40:45] life
[1:40:47] brother Brown will put it this way he
[1:40:48] says now watch what for Paul why'd you
[1:40:51] do this why did you come this way he
[1:40:53] says power that your faith should not
[1:40:55] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:40:57] power of God he says oh what a preacher
[1:41:00] that great man who he sought God and he
[1:41:03] said God I am weak and I don't know what
[1:41:05] to do I just pray you God to strengthen
[1:41:08] me and take my affirmities away from me
[1:41:10] and these things so I can be stronger
[1:41:13] that's a wonderful prayer
[1:41:16] that's a great thing Lord take away my
[1:41:18] weaknesses so I can be better in your
[1:41:20] service
[1:41:21] watch what he says
[1:41:23] God spoke back to him Paul my strength
[1:41:27] is made perfect in your weakness
[1:41:29] then Paul said when I am weak then I am
[1:41:31] strong yes he said I will glory in my
[1:41:34] infirmities of my weaknesses and so
[1:41:36] forth I'm thanking God that I got all of
[1:41:38] it out of me and when I get everything
[1:41:40] out of me then God can come in but as
[1:41:43] long as long as I got some of myself
[1:41:46] there God can't get in he says there
[1:41:49] that's it we smother him out from the
[1:41:52] poorest of us to the richest of us from
[1:41:54] the least to the greatest we keep God
[1:41:57] out of our Lives because of our own
[1:41:59] selves a seducing spirit will say you're
[1:42:02] capable
[1:42:03] you can do it you got the gifts you got
[1:42:06] the the anointing you got this that and
[1:42:08] the other thing listen you better make
[1:42:09] sure you're truly subject to the word
[1:42:11] when you do that
[1:42:13] otherwise you do a lot of damage
[1:42:15] I don't have the quote in here but
[1:42:17] brother Brown says the greatest damage
[1:42:18] he says is a true gift operated wrongly
[1:42:21] greatest damage happens in the Church
[1:42:22] the true gift operated wrongly what when
[1:42:26] we get our fingers in the pie
[1:42:29] he says we keep God out of our Lives
[1:42:31] because of our own selves I've often
[1:42:33] said the greatest enemy I got is William
[1:42:35] Branham he's the one that gets in God's
[1:42:37] way he's the one that gets lazy seventh
[1:42:40] angel Prophet to the age
[1:42:42] gets in the way and he's lazy
[1:42:45] he's the one that gets to a place
[1:42:47] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[1:42:48] something about it and when he does that
[1:42:51] shoves God right out of the picture
[1:42:55] if that's the prophet of the age saying
[1:42:57] that then what does that mean for us
[1:43:00] he says but
[1:43:01] when I can get rid of that guy when I
[1:43:04] can get to a place where he is out of
[1:43:06] the way then God can come over and do
[1:43:09] things that William Branham knows
[1:43:11] nothing about
[1:43:12] that's when God can use you that's when
[1:43:15] he can use any of you
[1:43:18] he can use
[1:43:22] anybody
[1:43:24] even a nobody
[1:43:26] especially a nobody he can use anybody
[1:43:29] when we get out of the way but as long
[1:43:32] as we get ourselves in the way he says
[1:43:34] then we cannot
[1:43:36] listen we have a word that has all the
[1:43:38] answers we need I believe that with all
[1:43:40] my heart
[1:43:41] everything you have need of is right
[1:43:42] here
[1:43:44] listen but he gave a five-fold Ministry
[1:43:46] and sometimes we can rely on that so
[1:43:47] heavily that we forget that we've got a
[1:43:49] relationship with God that can give us
[1:43:51] answers too
[1:43:52] that's why I'm not meant to have every
[1:43:54] answer
[1:43:55] for the congregation
[1:43:58] so when you ask me to pray about things
[1:43:59] I'll pray about them but my prayer is
[1:44:02] always that God will move on your life
[1:44:04] to give you the unction and give you the
[1:44:06] leadership not to give me the leadership
[1:44:08] because if I get it and I tell you then
[1:44:10] you're going to come back to me if
[1:44:11] things go wrong
[1:44:13] and it may or may not be my fault
[1:44:16] but if you go and you get your answer
[1:44:18] then he answers for it
[1:44:20] and now you've got a one-way you've got
[1:44:22] a two-way connection with him that
[1:44:24] doesn't have to run through a man
[1:44:25] there's no mediator between you and
[1:44:26] Christ
[1:44:27] it's just you in Christ that's what he's
[1:44:29] there for
[1:44:30] so I'm there to pray for you but I'm not
[1:44:32] always there to get an answer now
[1:44:34] sometimes God will use that sometimes
[1:44:35] God will use a pastor God will use a
[1:44:37] minister to give you an answer I believe
[1:44:38] that wholeheartedly we've seen it many
[1:44:40] many times but that doesn't mean that
[1:44:42] every answer you're going to get has to
[1:44:43] come from a minister
[1:44:44] you're supposed to be able to go in your
[1:44:46] prayer closet and get your answers for
[1:44:47] yourself
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:50] listen you're marrying Christ not me
[1:44:53] go to your husband that's where your
[1:44:55] safety is that's where your safety net
[1:44:56] is that's where you can't be seduced
[1:44:58] down another path I can mislead you but
[1:45:00] Christ can't
[1:45:01] we're speaking on the characteristics of
[1:45:03] a seduction and listen Satan's aim is to
[1:45:06] get us to rely on Humanity rather than
[1:45:08] the Holy Spirit quickening the word to
[1:45:10] our lives if he can get us away from
[1:45:12] that and get us dependent on each other
[1:45:13] for everything then he's got us licked
[1:45:16] because in the end we will fail each
[1:45:17] other we're only human we can only do so
[1:45:19] much but that Holy Spirit has no lack of
[1:45:22] energy
[1:45:23] doesn't have to go to sleep but doesn't
[1:45:25] have to leave and come back in these
[1:45:26] different things but it's an
[1:45:27] ever-present help in a time of trouble
[1:45:29] it's always got an answer for us if
[1:45:31] we'll wait for him to show us amen
[1:45:35] Paul continues in second Timothy he says
[1:45:37] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:45:39] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:45:43] deceived listen it's one thing when
[1:45:44] somebody knows they're wrong but when
[1:45:46] somebody doesn't know they're wrong and
[1:45:47] they're convinced they're right then
[1:45:48] they're even more effective in
[1:45:50] convincing others of it as well
[1:45:52] so the one that is self-deceived is the
[1:45:54] greatest deceived of all and when they
[1:45:56] don't realize they're deceived and they
[1:45:57] go certain they start to tell other
[1:45:58] people what they think or believe guess
[1:46:00] what they're all the more effective
[1:46:01] because there's no doubt
[1:46:03] they're they're a deceiver with faith in
[1:46:05] their deception because they have no
[1:46:07] idea that they're wrong in these things
[1:46:09] he says how do we counteract this
[1:46:12] how do you keep from falling into this
[1:46:14] trap he says but continue thou in the
[1:46:17] things which thou Hast learned and has
[1:46:19] been assured of knowing of whom thou
[1:46:22] Hast learned them in other words stick
[1:46:24] with what's come from a proven Source
[1:46:26] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[1:46:29] as long as you've seen the works of
[1:46:31] Christ in my life follow me and heed the
[1:46:33] things that I tell you led me to that
[1:46:34] place and if not
[1:46:36] he says look out because that's just a
[1:46:38] good talker you've got to have a proven
[1:46:40] source for these things it's got to be
[1:46:42] proven by what the word and the life of
[1:46:44] the speaker that's giving you that word
[1:46:46] you've got to be very careful who you're
[1:46:48] listening to
[1:46:49] verse 15 says in that from a child thou
[1:46:52] Hast known the holy scriptures which are
[1:46:54] able to make thee wise unto salvation
[1:46:56] through faith which is in Christ Jesus
[1:46:58] he says all scripture is given by
[1:47:02] inspiration of God
[1:47:03] and it is profitable for Doctrine
[1:47:06] forever proof
[1:47:08] for correction and for instruction in
[1:47:12] righteousness
[1:47:13] with what angle with what purpose
[1:47:16] he says that the man of God may be
[1:47:18] perfect
[1:47:19] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[1:47:23] thoroughly furnished under all good
[1:47:24] works in ed in other words everything
[1:47:27] you need for your life is found right
[1:47:29] here
[1:47:30] the inspiration you need is right here
[1:47:33] and all you need is something to Quicken
[1:47:34] it as we spoke about in the last service
[1:47:36] amen how do you know a seducing spirit
[1:47:39] keeps you away from this
[1:47:42] every time it keeps you away from this
[1:47:44] it'll give you a little bit here and it
[1:47:45] might give you a little bit there but
[1:47:46] it'll never give you the full word
[1:47:51] I'm going to close with these two quotes
[1:47:52] and brother Branham is talking about
[1:47:53] that Vision he had of the bride at the
[1:47:56] end
[1:47:58] and he says then I heard something like
[1:48:00] all more Christian Soldiers I looked and
[1:48:03] here come that sainted bunch of little
[1:48:04] girls just exactly the way they was all
[1:48:07] correctly dressed their hair hanging
[1:48:09] down way down on their back smooth clean
[1:48:12] marching like this to the step of the
[1:48:14] Gospel he says she was the word
[1:48:18] they look like one out of every nation I
[1:48:21] was looking at it as they passed by and
[1:48:24] seen them pass by by appearance they
[1:48:26] were perfect
[1:48:28] but Watch What Happens
[1:48:31] he says instead of going down they
[1:48:33] started going up remember he had seen
[1:48:34] the different brides and he saw the
[1:48:36] bride from America and he said she was
[1:48:37] walking to that rock and roll she was
[1:48:39] marching the rock and roll beat she was
[1:48:41] Boogie and she was swaying her hips and
[1:48:43] he says what happened was they started
[1:48:44] what going down down down until they
[1:48:46] fell into what hell
[1:48:49] he says but this one everyone else was
[1:48:51] going down he says and instead of going
[1:48:52] down now this one started going up she
[1:48:55] was dressed right she was acting right
[1:48:56] she looked it right by appearance by
[1:48:58] walk by all of these things she was
[1:49:00] perfect she was headed in the right
[1:49:01] direction
[1:49:02] they're headed for heaven he says but
[1:49:04] then I noticed one of them trying two or
[1:49:07] three of them trying getting out of line
[1:49:09] and I screamed stay in line
[1:49:12] and if you hear him and he's preaching
[1:49:13] this and he screams it out stay in line
[1:49:16] why because he knows that something got
[1:49:19] a hold of their ear and was pulling them
[1:49:21] away from the Tree of Life
[1:49:23] he said the holy spirit is here to drive
[1:49:25] us to the tree of life and there's
[1:49:27] something now Satan he says is trying to
[1:49:29] hold us back he says what happens
[1:49:31] something pulled him away he says and I
[1:49:33] was stand the vision left me and I was
[1:49:35] standing in the room screaming stay in
[1:49:37] line
[1:49:38] it so moved him it so overtook him what
[1:49:41] he saw happening there that all he was
[1:49:43] left to do was scream stay in line don't
[1:49:47] move away from what's been proven
[1:49:50] hold fast to that which you've been
[1:49:51] taught taught knowing who taught it to
[1:49:54] you knowing who brought it to you
[1:49:56] stick with what is proven don't get out
[1:49:58] of line
[1:49:59] he says I wonder could it already be
[1:50:02] passed could the bride already be called
[1:50:04] is that what we're going through today
[1:50:07] she has to be molded and made into the
[1:50:10] image of Christ
[1:50:12] and Christ is the word amen God bless
[1:50:15] you the musicians would come
[1:50:24] it's perilous times
[1:50:26] we can stand together it's perilous
[1:50:27] times
[1:50:28] we know Satan's going around like a
[1:50:31] roaring lion he's trying to get us out
[1:50:32] of line he's trying to get us off the
[1:50:33] Mark he's trying to get us discontented
[1:50:36] he's trying to get us mad he's trying to
[1:50:37] get us sad he's trying to get us in any
[1:50:39] way he can to get our eyes off of the
[1:50:41] word of God Amen
[1:50:43] the last one the last services that was
[1:50:45] the message the Rapture that was just 21
[1:50:47] days before brother Branham died and
[1:50:50] what was he doing he was saying stay in
[1:50:51] line stay with the Simplicity that is in
[1:50:54] Christ
[1:50:56] stay with what has been proven to work
[1:50:58] we saw a chief offering we saw a wave
[1:51:00] offering that went before us and it
[1:51:02] proved what this message is capable of
[1:51:03] doing when it takes us back to that word
[1:51:05] and that word is quickened to us
[1:51:07] and he's saying don't be seduced by
[1:51:10] quick results
[1:51:11] by promises
[1:51:13] by Echo chambers that just tell you
[1:51:15] everything you say and think is right
[1:51:16] that don't ever challenge you but stick
[1:51:18] with the word of God and take the lumps
[1:51:21] take the lumps because that's what means
[1:51:23] you're growing
[1:51:24] The Growing Pains that come with
[1:51:25] sticking with the word they don't always
[1:51:27] feel so good but it shows that
[1:51:28] something's happening amen we can't get
[1:51:30] lazy
[1:51:31] we can't get tied down but we've got to
[1:51:33] be quick to keep moving with what the
[1:51:35] word of God is trying to do in our lives
[1:51:37] amen
[1:51:38] don't get drawn away by a fancy message
[1:51:42] by a dynamic gift stick with the
[1:51:44] simplicity
[1:51:46] and you'll be right
[1:51:47] you'll do just fine amen
[1:51:50] stay humble
[1:51:52] stay surrendered
[1:51:54] and stay close to Christ
[1:51:56] and you won't have to worry about it
[1:51:57] amen
[1:51:58] let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[1:52:03] Lord It's a warning we've received
[1:52:04] tonight
[1:52:07] Lord and I think sometimes we forget
[1:52:11] the battle's not over until we're out of
[1:52:13] here
[1:52:14] and Lord it's not always obvious
[1:52:18] Lord sometimes it's embarrassing the
[1:52:19] things that we let in
[1:52:21] and we look back and we wonder how we
[1:52:23] got there
[1:52:24] but Lord God I'm asking your grace to
[1:52:26] come in tonight
[1:52:27] Lord that you'd help us to look in the
[1:52:29] mirror of your word
[1:52:31] Lord that you'd help us to say I'm not
[1:52:33] where I need to be in this
[1:52:35] something's got in and it wasn't the
[1:52:37] holy spirit in my life and it's pulling
[1:52:39] me away and it's hindering me and I
[1:52:41] can't have any hindrances because it's
[1:52:42] time to get going
[1:52:44] Lord God I pray each one of us old and
[1:52:46] young alike or from the front to the
[1:52:49] back lord may we take Lord inventory of
[1:52:51] our life
[1:52:53] Lord if it seems like we've been winning
[1:52:54] all the time
[1:52:56] Lord let's take a closer look to see if
[1:52:58] maybe something snuck through
[1:52:59] what if we've opened a loophole Lord if
[1:53:01] we've opened a window in our home Lord
[1:53:03] that's let Satan in
[1:53:05] order we're just starting to see some
[1:53:07] effects
[1:53:08] Lord help us to stay close to that word
[1:53:10] Lord help us to read your word every
[1:53:13] single day Lord that we would know it
[1:53:14] Lord like the back of our hand Lord that
[1:53:17] it would be the first thing that comes
[1:53:18] to our mind and the first thing that
[1:53:19] comes out of our lips heavenly father is
[1:53:22] it is written though because your word
[1:53:24] says that's what defeats him
[1:53:26] Lord we live by every word
[1:53:29] Lord help us to stay with it we pray
[1:53:31] Lord keep us simple keep us humble
[1:53:34] Lord let us not get lifted up but may we
[1:53:36] just Trust You Lord trust your grace
[1:53:38] trust your plan trust your process each
[1:53:40] one we pray

[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:24] amen
[2:09:25] praise the Lord I've often said that the
[2:09:27] songs we sing sometimes are prayers and
[2:09:29] sometimes they're commitments so if
[2:09:32] we're serious about that Jesus draw me
[2:09:34] close and we get to be
[2:09:36] obviously the opposite of that it's a
[2:09:39] we're closer to him We're farther away
[2:09:40] from the world and we don't want the
[2:09:42] world right right by grace
[2:09:44] I see nothing out in the world anymore
[2:09:46] that really really attracts me
[2:09:49] it's a
[2:09:51] it's just it's just gone
[2:09:54] I don't know what else I could say it's
[2:09:56] just gone you know that's why I don't
[2:09:58] listen to the news anymore
[2:10:00] it just I can't take it
[2:10:03] just can't take it
[2:10:04] so what I'm saying is that in order to
[2:10:07] get closer to God we had to surrender
[2:10:10] 750 we're going to sing 756.
[2:10:13] you know I this is the more that I
[2:10:16] Surrender

[2:10:21] look at the right page the morning I
[2:10:22] Surrender the lighter is my load right
[2:10:25] because there's less than less of the
[2:10:27] world so let's let's just sing this and
[2:10:30] has been admonished from the pulpit
[2:10:33] before
[2:10:34] be careful what you commit yourself to
[2:10:36] because God requires it of us
[2:10:39] that's how serious it is
[2:10:43] the more
[2:10:45] [Music]
[2:10:47] surrender
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:50] the
[2:10:52] lighter

[2:14:37] brother random said who would you rather
