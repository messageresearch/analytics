that you've spoken every word that you've written Lord it won't Lord it it's got to come to pass Lord one jot and one tit won't fail Lord but everything you've said Lord It's got to happen and Lord we're resting on that our trust is in that word Lord that you've given us Lord that you bound yourself to that Covenant Lord that you've given us Lord that you'd never leave us you'd never forsake us Lord but you'd see us through to the End of the Age Lord we're here saying we believe it this morning Lord we're confessing with our lips Lord with our lives Lord that we believe that word Lord that we're dedicating ourselves to that word Lord that you've given us Lord that it would have the effect in us that it's promised Lord I pray you bless us us once again this morning Lord those that aren't here that are sick and working and studying these things Lord we pray a special Grace to them each one Heavenly Father Lord but trusting your presence to be amongst us once again Lord Just Have Your Way in this service we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen man God bless you turn if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 once again amen certainly appreciate having our deacons back from a successful hunting trip appreciate brother Dale stepping up to help out while they were gone kind of holding the fort amen glad to have able-bodied people here that can do that and certainly appreciate brother Paul taking the service on Wednesday and had some good feedback on it and I was able to listen in for most of it so thankful for that amen I also met with Brother Carmen Mills while I was in New Brunswick and and so looking forward to maybe having him come up uh later this year or maybe next year sometime but uh good to connect with him after 20 years of not seen him so it's good to see God blessing them there and then spoke with brother David Nash also this week and he's excited to come up here he'll arrive late Thursday night and of course we've got Services Friday Saturday and Sunday and he doesn't leave till Tuesday afternoon but just praying that the Lord will bless us in that keep them in prayer amen we've got a a missionary gift coming and that's one thing I don't think we've had here yet I guess brother George Smith would maybe be called a bit of a missionary but I'm just praying that the Lord will bless us amen with what he comes to bring and the stories and the testimonies of how we've supported it we can't all be preachers and we certainly can't all be missionaries but we can put our shoulder to the wheel amen and we can support men that that go out and do those things and it's attributed to us not just to them amen but those that support get the same reward as the one that goes in and does the work so we're thankful for that amen certainly want to remember those that aren't here brother Chad and brother Grant and sister Morin and those different ones brother Kingsley just praying the Lord will be with them amen second Peter 1 ver4 says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the Divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning and as you can imagine we're continuing our series on manifesting time and we're going to be speaking on brotherly kindness Tom morning but I want to have a title of a higher kindness and before we go into this you know it's it's interesting as you if you've ever listened to or read the message statue of a perfect man some of these attributes brother Bram spends very little time on it on brotherly kindness he gives us two paragraphs and that's it and I'm supposed to make a service out of two paragraphs but we're going to do it amen by God's grace this morning but you know I wanted to kind of have a bit of a just a preamble this morning on these things and talking with different ones you know as we're preaching these attributes they're great attributes and they're Christian attributes and the expectation is that it's in each and every every one of us and the simple fact is it is in every one of us whether we believe it or not it's in there because we're children of God and those those attributes those Natures are in there and yet when we preach these because remember as brother Brandon preaches these he doesn't preach them at the low level he preaches them at the high level he preaches them at the peak he shows what the epitome what the the the Mastery of of this attribute would look like and we look at those things and like I I said a couple Services ago it's hard to preach about Joseph and Abraham and these different ones that had faith for decades before the promise came through because we can look at these things and we think well I can't even go a week and yet you're preaching about 25 years of waiting around for the promise of God but you know it can be daunting and and we can look at these things and say honestly I don't have it yet I don't maybe have what Abraham had I don't have what Joseph had or Daniel had or or these different ones and I say join the crowd join the crowd because amen we're preaching these at the Pinnacle but don't think that for a second you don't have it because you don't have necessarily what Abraham did or these different ones amen but the proving of you having these is done at the level where you're at and that's more the point I want to make if if you're just a young person and you're going to school then your trial of patience is different than your mom and dad's trial of patience is different than the elders trial of patience because this is a process remember we're going through Redemption we're going through something that's bringing us back to what we were in the eyes of God and so all these things are going on through your entire life you don't just get Faith once and then that's it but you get Faith on top of faith and you get patience on top of patience and you get virtue on top of virtue and these things grow and it's the work of the Lord throughout your entire life that's going to bring out the the the full manifestation of the attributes of God in your life and we'll see that even you can't have the full attributes until you get the Holy Ghost and that's really where we go on the next one but but you don't just have enough patience and enough faith and virtue to get you to the Holy Ghost because we look at the Holy Ghost as the be all and end all but I've said this before that getting the Holy Ghost is really the start of your true Christian walk and impact all of these things that we're doing now they're because you're a child of God but when you get the Holy Ghost that's power for service amen and it's supposed to do more than just develop you now but it's to help develop others it's to help make you more effective in the in in the kingdom of God and we've preached before how in Acts 2 you know they're in the upper room and the Holy Ghost comes down and they get that infilling of the Holy Ghost and two chapters later in Acts 4 they get a greater infilling than they had before and what was it it was so that they could continue in service so that they would have the courage so that they would have the strength to go on and continue to do what Christ had told them to do brother B will put it this way he says we should be unfolding we don't look at unfolding the same way they used to but remember in the old days you had Scrolls and and when you would unfold a scroll you would unroll it a bit and you'd read that portion and then you'd roll up the next bit and unroll the next bit and you'd see more and then you go more and more and more he says we're supposed to be like those Scrolls just a constant unfolding a constant revealing of what's written in our lives of the The Godly DNA if I could put it that way that's inside of us but this is a continuous revealing and it's the holy spirit's work inside of us he says we should be unfolding God's spirit pouring out not just pouring out on you but God's spirit pouring out from you so that you can have an effect on those that are around you to bring them to the same gospel that you've received he says not just one little user not one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation of the just shall live by faith or sanctification of the gifts of the Spirit but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory he says why we ought to be way up the road ready for the translation and we're lingering back down in the old things and saying well he says we keep going back he says let's go forward I love it when people come to me and they tell me what God's doing rather than what God did you know why that shows that they're growing it shows that they're maturing it shows that they're stepping into this that there's a revelation after Revelation there's a glory after Glory line upon line word upon word is being built up in their life I've said it before it doesn't have as much impact today because our ships aren't D don't you sail so much but a a ship doesn't Sail on yesterday's wind and a Christian doesn't grow on yesterday's experience we build on it but that is not our growth we have to grow day by day and it's a Contin ous working of God in our lives that's doing this so we need new revelation we need new molding we need new shaping we need new sanctification we need God working daily in our lives we need a greater experience in the Holy Ghost every single day we need a greater experience in the word I love how I can read my Bible and it is something new every single day something every single day brother Brandon would continue he says but if you constantly they lay there before God all the time not just Sundays not just in services not just when you get a moment but every day all the time he says with baptism after baptism striking you something's got to take place brother Brown was talking about speaking in tongues in this this actual place and he was saying don't stop there don't stop with speaking in tongues because so remember so many of the Pentecostals all they wanted to do was speak in tongues because that was their evidence he says no you got to go on from that that's not the be all and end all and it's the same in this message where you're accepting a prophet of Malachi 4 and and and knowing that a message is here is not it you've got to move on from that and you've got to receive the person of the message you've got to receive the life of the message you've got to meet the god that sent the messenger because he says behold I sent you Elijah the prophet the key is that he sent him not who he sent he's trying to get you to see who God is amen so we've got to move on day by day by day and so I don't want you to be listening to these Services we preached on the Statue of a perfect man and just walk away dejected because brother John's preaching on something that I don't have brother John's preaching on some things that he doesn't have and it's okay because it's up to God to draw out of me what he needs and it's up to God to put in what I need as well that's a work of his hands that's doing these things we look at Abraham Abraham was a man of great patience and a man of great faith and yet Abraham was subject to emotion he was subject to to Family Ties and that's what held him back for a while do you know the promise was held back perhaps from Abraham because he didn't separate himself as quickly maybe if he separated quickly he might have got it more quickly I don't know the scriptures silent on it but some of this was Abraham literally holding back things because of his own Humanity because of his own relationships his wife got him off the path many times told him what to do and and it went against what God had told him was going to happen and then Abraham gets caught up in circumstances and he becomes a liar a half liar right half Li are still a liar but but but don't look at it and just say well Abraham was a man of great faith but recognize there's Humanity Blended in this remember he says that Elijah was and Elisha were men of like passions as we were so there's got to be growth through all of these things amen I'm not giving that us a license now to just do whatever we want and and just stay where we are but I'm saying it's a growth that's happening it's a maturing that's happening and these these things so but the thing you'll notice with a child of God is when push comes to shove they make the right decision and it's attributed to Abraham for righteousness and it's the same thing for us because through the blood he doesn't see our faults he only sees our faith and that's a beautiful thing that we get and that's only available now under the New Covenant under the blood of Jesus Christ but brother watch how he says this he says a man says I can't live the life he says that little girl the other day that was converted she said I can't live it he said that was reasoning reasoning looks in here rather than up here it looks in here rather than in here and he says that little girl that said I can't live it he says that was reasoning but when it struck her soul something became a reality then brother van would say time and time again when that light of the word strikes your soul it quickens it and all of a sudden it starts to grow but until you get a personal revelation of Christ nothing's going to grow and you can't live it and you won't live it and you'll frustrate yourself if you think you can he says it's not reasoning anymore it's taking God at his word amen notice when you get reasonings Cast Away the soul will answer clear that's why I can't convince you into this and I can't convince you out of it it's because you've heard a voice and that's the voice you're listening to and that's the voice you're responding to and if I can get your eyes on God if I can get your eyes on his word on his promise and that'll solidify you in every aspect of of your life as you bring it subject to that word amen I said it before I'll repeat it until the day I day day I die the simplest thing you can do as a Christian is read your Bible every single day some of us read differently you know I was talking to a brother a while ago and he said I just read the same verse or the same chapter over and over again until I feel like I've got it that's okay there's no law behind how we do it I like to read a chapter across four different places every single day but the key is to get something out of what you're reading and what I do is I write it down in a book and that's the thing that I take with me for that day and you meditate on it and you grab onto it and you dwell on it and you apply it until it anchors in your soul and what happens is it starts to change your attitude it starts to change your approach it starts to change your reaction to life and all of a sudden you realize I'm maturing I'm growing and it's just from the Simplicity of reading your Bible just something so simple amen amen but God will test us now at the level he'll prove us at the level that we're at and if you're capable of a harder test he'll give it I remember when I was in elementary school and I was pretty bored and so they started giving me higher level classes to test me at a higher level and all of a sudden I wasn't getting everything right I was making mistakes but they knew that I was capable of doing more and so they tested me at a higher level to do it and here's the thing God knows where you're at better than you do you're his child remember he's getting a a a tutor that talks back to him and lets him know what's going on and so he'll test you at the level where you're at and he's the one that knows where you're at man you you look at at something like the the three Hebrew children and they were only in their teens as far as we know and he brings them to the fiery furnace trial they didn't know perhaps how much Faith they had until they got in the trial but all of a sudden they're in the trial and their faith is not wavering and there's they're not backing off but they're walking towards final judgment on this Earth and yet something keeps holding them and something keeps pushing them and then they realize we've got this this is a part of me I can't turn back there's something inside of me and they realized they were passing the test no doubt and it proved what they had and like I've said before I don't believe you could ever scare the Hebrew children after that if there was any fear in them it went out when they went into a fire and came out with the only thing being destroyed with their bonds and having an experience with the Son of God Paul would say this as a comfort and 1 Corinthians 10 he says there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to men you know what that means it means you haven't gone through anything that no one else hasn't gone through that others have gone through it before you he says but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able that means he's not going to give you a test that you can't pass he's not going to put you through a trial that you can't survive he's not going to put you in a hole that you can't get out of he says he but but he but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it now if you take his way you can bear it if you take your way you'll fail and the key is to recognize what his way is rather than what your way is now I read this these next two scriptures a while back but before we get to our real message this morning I wanted to just fit it in here as we're doing this little short short beginning here on on settling us a bit and Paul said this for when we were come to Macedonia our flag had no rest you ever had a month or a week or a year seems like every seven years almost you get one of those years and it's just like nothing goes right well Macedonia was Paul's experience of that he says our flesh had no rest maybe they were sick maybe they were tired maybe they were getting chased out of every town stressed out nobody was whatever it was he says we had no rest but we were troubled on every side without we're fightings within we're fears things going on around us things going on inside of us fightings fears he says nevertheless God that comforteth those that are cast down doesn't mean anything if you're cast down what matters is what happens when you're cast down he says he comforted Us by the coming of Titus sometimes God's provision for you is another believer sometimes your down in the dump sometimes you're in despair sometimes you're depressed sometimes you're stressed you're tired and what does God do he sends an angel your way in the form of a brother or sister and sometimes it's physical support they come in they give you a meal they clean your house they take your kids for a while and sometimes it's spiritual support where they come in and they just give you a word in due season don't forget that sometimes you're God's answer you're the word that he sends to to help in the situation he'll send the word and flesh to meet us sometimes amen then Paul and this was after the next scripture I'm going to read but Paul would say for we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of Life the Amplified says for we do not want you to be uninformed Brethren about the Affliction and oppressing distress which befell US in Asia how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down and crushed that we despaired even of life itself the great Apostle Paul the the greatest prophet of that age says I was utterly weighed down unbearably weighed down crushed I despaired of life I had no idea what was going to happen greatest man of his age and he's sitting there and he's so human the question is not are you going to be unbearably crushed or are you going to have despair it's are you going to stay there amen CU that's a choice and what you do in the situation will determine whether you stay in the situation or you come into a rock a strong a place a strong place of shelter that Christ gives us in the word amen Paul didn't stay in the feeling of loss and defeat and weariness watch what he says he says we had the sentence of death in ourselves why that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raises the Dead the Amplified says indeed we felt within ourselves that we had receed received the very sentence of death this is going to kill me I'm not going to make it through I can't take it anymore it's gone further than it's ever gone before it's taking longer than it's ever taken before and I don't know where to go or what to do he says but that was to keep us from trusting and depending on ourselves instead of on God who raises the dead what was Paul saying about this he says I learned a lesson in this and the lesson is my life is in God's hands your life is in in God's hands nothing can touch our health nothing can touch our families our marriage our finances our job our children whatever it is nothing can touch US unless God allows it and he said the the situation we were in was to teach us that it's God that protects us it's God that keeps us it's God's power inside of us that keeps us in all of these things amen that that song we sing on Christ the solid rock I stand my his oath his Covenant his blood support me in the whelming flood when all around my soul Soul gives way he then is All My Hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand amen the greatest thing you can realize is that you are built on Bedrock you're built on a solid foundation and sometimes we've got to be stripped and broken down to realize that the thing that is holding us up is what we're built on and not ourselves but look at the finishing of this Paul gives us hope he says who delivered us Paul's giving a testimony here and then he says from so great a death that's all past tense he says and do deliver That's The Great I Am that's the god of every day that's the god of every moment the everpresent god that's with us he is a god of Deliverance he says and he does deliver he says in whom we trust right now that he will yet he says Deliver Us what future tends to Deliver Us from a present problem Paul says he delivered us he will deliver us and he is delivering us he didn't say I see it he didn't say I understand it but he said he's a god of Deliverance amen we Face things day to day and sometimes it just seems like like things just drop on us and it crushes us and it seems like we've done everything right and we've done what we ought to do and then something drops on us and we think that's one more thing to Bear day by day just recognize God delivers God knows what you can carry God knows what you can bear amen amen but let's get back to our message for this morning and and if we look at the the attributes here and this is the way that it's drawn out traditionally by brother brandom is is this pyramid and we can see the changing intention of these attributes here because we look at the starting point of faith and faith is firstly for you when you have faith to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior that's for you it's not for anybody else but then you start to have virtue and that virtue is strength and that's firstly strength for you but it starts to turn to strength for others as well to draw from you and we go from there and we add knowledge and remember brother Bram says that's knowledge that the word of God is true and again that's for you not necessarily for somebody else now if if it's if you're a father or you're a mother or a husband or a wife or these different things then obviously that has an impact but again these first three things are primarily for you but then you step into Temperance and while Temperance benefits me because it keeps me from blowing up it's really for the person on the other side and so you see that it starts to transition now to start to focus on other people rather than yourself as you get higher up the pyramid in these attributes amen and these things the thing with Temperance is that it it gives people a blessing instead of the curse they really deserve and we see that with patience and these different things but brother BR would talk about this and how you get closer to the top it gets narrower and narrower and he says that's because less and less people have these different things the higher you get see the less it's about you and the more it's about others and that's where we all naturally tend to struggle isn't it is when it's for the other person and you're turning now from selfishness to sacrifice to service because we're supposed to be servants amen not just Masters and as you get higher and higher and higher these things become more and more difficult for the carnal nature because it starts to turn away from yourself and to the benefit of others and we see people that have these things remember the quote I read at the beginning of of this series where brother Bram says people have some of these things naturally and they're not even Christians they have these benefit they have these attributes but nobody has them all unless they're a child of God that's the other thing you'll see but I met people that have the patience of Job and they don't even know who Christ is absolutely they just have it but what happens is they'll come to the next stage or another stage and they won't move past it because they don't have it naturally and because they're not a child of God God's not working to draw them through it and so they just stagnate they stop they fall away whatever it might be but with a child of God God's always working with us to bring us through these entire stages amen otherwise people just get hurt they get tired they get disappointed they get weary and they fall away but the child of God keeps pressing through because they're a child of God and he's pulling us through he's going to make us produce what's inside of us amen now I'm not saying that we don't get weary or tired we do Believers we feel all those things amen but what do we do when we feel those things that's the thing that defines us is not what the what the situation we're in but it's what we do in those situations that tell us who and what we are remember I read that quote where brother BR says cross a Christian up one time and you'll find out if he's really a Christian or she's really a Christian Paul would say this he says we are troubled on every side anybody had a lot of trouble recently where it seems like everything's going wrong here's a scripture for you he says yet not distressed you're in trouble you feel troubled you you're you're worried you're uncertain about where things are going he says but we're not distressed we're perplexed we don't have understanding we don't have Insight he says but we're not in despair we're persecuted but we're not forsaken that's a revelation that God's with you no matter what he says and we're cast down but not destroyed remember a righteous man falls down seven times but he gets up again and again and again it's not that we're never cast down it's not that we don't fall down it's that it doesn't destroy us it doesn't take us out of the path that God's called us for amen a Believer is allowed to feel that's a part of our Humanity you'll never hear me say you're not allowed to feel but the believer doesn't rest on their feelings you'll never see emotion in the attributes of a Believer there's no emotion here patience like we're talking about is not an emotion love like we're talking about is not an emotion brotherly kindness is not an emotion it's an attribute these are actions not feelings amen so we go through these things and and so the the the Believers allowed to feel but the Believers are not allowed to rest on their feelings amen and so we come to something like patience and and remember brother Brown says the first thing to do is have patience with God and that's for your benefit but then he says and then have patience with others and that's for their benefit and as you grow these B these attributes are starting to turn outwardly rather than inwardly and the great Mark of a or an attribute of a Christian is that they act the same no matter how other people act there's a constancy there's a there's a a Simplicity a straightness to our walk and it has nothing to do with what the other person does or says we ought to walk the same way no matter what we come to Godliness and we know that's to act and live and receive the word of God and we know there's a price to pay for Godly living there's a price to pay for these things and we've got to be able to understand the sacrifice that comes with having Christ live in your life and we've got to be ready for those things and then we come to brotherly kindness and that's the seventh attribute and that's the crowning attribute that we have in us as children of God I want to explain that because and brother BR would go into it and he'd say seven means completion he says and brotherly kindness is as far as you can go you're built with this you're born with this because you're a child of God and and and and that's as far as we can go but there's a Capstone that has to be external to us to come down and solidify this and make it all work and that's where God truly steps in and he starts working inside of our life amen but Brotherly Love is as far as we can go brotherly kindness we can't go to charity without him but all of these other things are built into us to be able to work this way brother Brian would say this he says then let's add Brotherly Love brotherly kindness he says when we get to that brother ly kindness what does it mean he says put yourself in his place on the matter my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day Jesus said 70 times seven see brotherly kindness he says now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see be kind to him and go anyhow now we're getting to the peak now we're getting narrow because the closer you'll see with the other things that so many of them are applicable to to people outside but when we get to brotherly kindness we're dealing now with Believers primarily I've said it before the people that can hurt us disappoint us disillusion us the greatest are those that that confess Jesus Christ as their lord and savior the same as us we've got a greater expectation of these but he's saying that brotherly kindness seeks to understand rather than judge or condemn and that's a hard thing to do sometimes especially when it's personal to us it's very hard to do amen but understanding where a person is or where they're coming from doesn't excuse their actions that's not what Brotherly Love does or brotherly kindness does but rather it explains their actions and allows you to approach it from a place of understanding rather than condemnation or judgment that's a tough thing to do especially like I said when it's personal now the greatest deception the world has today is because I understand it's right and we see that we see that with all these alternative Lifestyles and we see it with the choices people are making and people say yeah I can see why you're doing that therefore it's okay no that's not the way it works understanding doesn't ever cause us to compromise on the word of God ever ever ever ever I can understand why you're doing it but that doesn't make it right and and as a minister many times the people will come and they'll talk to you about situations and you sit there and it's a great tale of Woe but what you say in the end is you say I understand but then you have to say but the word says because brotherly kindness will take us back and restore or introduce somebody to the word of God that's what we do is we understand where they're coming from but we're seeking to bring them to where they need to be and that understanding gives us patience it gives us love it gives us concern for them and it raises their well-being above ours and so we sacrifice our position so that we can draw them to where they need to be amen but it never causes us to compromise on the word of God like I said people will will come in and they're fearful and they're worried about things and that worry drives them to a decision rather than the word of God we can't do that we can't let time press us to make a decision without the word of God to support us and people will C fall back on that and say I don't have time I don't have time you've always got time there's nothing that requires us to go outside of the word of God there's no situation so desperate that would cause us to compromise and then compromis is the Devil's Playground I believe is the saying amen but these things ought to drive us to God not drive us to a decision and so we don't give ground because of what's happening around us we don't give ground because of what's going on around us but we stay with the word of God and having done all to stand Paul said stand stay there and wait and let God move in these things because otherwise what happens is we take the road of our own understanding our own reason our own logic our own fear how can God be using fear God never used remember perfect love casts out fear fear God cannot use worry God cannot use fear to drive us to a word-based Godly decision he cannot do it amen he just can't do it remember this scripture in Proverbs it says there's a way that seeth right unto a man but the way thereof the end thereof are the ways of death don't let Satan sway you with your emotions don't let him pull on these things emotions aren't bad we have emotional Services we have emotional marriages we have emotional relationships we are creatures of emotion God didn't give us emotions so that we wouldn't ever use them or enjoy them but they're supposed to be brought subject to the word of God because emotions aren't Sanctified emotions aren't converted and so we've got to bring them subject to the word of God every every every time like I said emotion's not in that pyramid of Christian attributes that's just an attribute of you as a human amen but then we jump to the other side and you come to where I tend to be which is that place of cold hard logic and reason and we can look as logical people look down on those that are emotional because it's just two sides of the same con same coin cuz we're trying to bring whatever it is we're using subject to the word of God if you're emotional you got to bring your your emotion subject to the word of God if you're a deep thinker and very logical you've got to bring your thoughts subject to the word of God remember what Paul said he says for though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh so flesh can be logic and flesh can be reason and emotion it can be all of these things he says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations that word means arguments theories and reasonings so theological German must be equally uh subject to the word of God as the weepy crying lovey-dovey emotional person I've got to bring what I Am Naturally subject to the word as much as somebody that's highly emotional he says and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of God of Christ every thought has to be brought obedient to Christ to the word brother M says this he says what we need is an old-fashioned Backwoods sky blue sin killing religion what we need is Gun Barrel straight something that'll preach the gospel without compromise and let the chips fall wherever they wish to and chop into it he says we need men of God stain with power get the church back into the place where it ought to be if you've ever fired a gun and there's something wrong with the barrel it's it where the bullet lands is always indiscriminate one minute it's high and right the next minute it's down and left and the next minute it's right in the middle and there's no Rhyme or Reason why cuz your gun Barrel's messed up it's got to be straightened it's got to be free of obstruction brother Bram says we got to preach the word straight not compromis because of what somebody says what somebody feels how hard the situation is it it's this understanding of Brotherly Love is such a trap because we know how it feels to be in situations and the longer you live the more you understand where people are and what they're doing and why they're doing these things amen but this idea is to seek with the intention of restoring them not to just empathize empathy doesn't help anybody it helps them in the moment but it doesn't help them move down the road every day we make choices and our walk with God is choices and we have these areas of great strength and and we tend to rest in those areas but there areas where we have yet to prove God and that's where brotherly kindness is required of me for you and you for me because there's areas in my life that maybe I haven't been tested in yet or God hasn't proven himself in a particular way and when I come up to that area I may fall or you may fall there are some things you look at you know you'll see this especially with children you may only deal with a particular situation with your child once in their life or twice in their life as they become teenagers we've got to make decisions about how we raise them we've got to make decisions about what we allow in our home we've got to make decisions like Joshua said as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord and you may only have to make that decision once but you're going to have to make it and different children respond different ways and we see family relationships that we've had to give up and these different things and we've got to decide are we going to let those things Slide by compromise or are we going to hold fast to the word of God because you know what our feelings say our feelings say I'm going to keep our my children close to me so that I can impact them and in the meanwhile we're compromising on the word of God you're keeping them close to compromise that doesn't make any sense God can't use it my wife was telling me of a of of a family she she knows or we know down in California they're professing Christians and and and you know good people good H good father and and mother and and they've got this this this young daughter and she's got one child out of wedlock last I heard now she's got two children out of woodlock and she lives in their home with them cuz her the the girl's boyfriend is away much of the time but when he comes back he stays in their house with her they're allowing fornication in their home for the sake of having their daughter close to them how can God bless it God can't bless that God can't bless that there's no there's no price that she's paying for her decisions and so she gets to stay there and reap the benefits of a Christian home without having the word actually held accountable in her life God can't bless that God can never take you out of his word by his will it's impossible brother Bram said his word is his will you can't say God told me to do it and it's contrary to his will it doesn't work that way anden if you've never seen God provide for your finances you'll work your fingers to the Bone trying to get money you know I in my life I've had good years and I've had bad years and what I found is that God is faithful no matter what some of the best years I've had I made the least money and I think it was God showing me that my finances are in his hands not in mine because it seems like the more you make then the more you spend or the you get things fail on you you you have you know high cost for this or that and the other thing you get to the end of the year and say I made all that money and I've got less to show for it next year you make $30,000 less and You' got more to show for it why it's God showing you that it's not what you do it's what he does remember way he said he says he says you know try me prove me he says and see if I won't pour out a blessing do what's right seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you scripture says except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it and whether it's our finances our health our marriage whatever it might be our businesses unless the Lord builds it it's all going to crumble anyways because here's the thing we might think we're getting ahead in one area but we're destroying in another area you know I I remember in Texas there for a while they had a special project they assigned to me and I was spending an extra 2 hours a day at work and you know what that did that gave me a bonus that got me employee of the year that got me a big raise and it hurt my marriage and all I could see was the benefits on this side not realizing that I was destroying something on the other destroy marriage destroy Fellowship destroy Church attendance whatever it might be we've got to be able to see that God's got to keep us on the straight and narrow with these things and he keeps us in Bound bance for what we need for each and every one of our Lives amen but here's the thing we're talking about brotherly love what happens when you see me doing that what happens when I see you doing it what do we what do we do then we apply brotherly kindness that's what we do it's a place of understanding because guess what each one of us have been in that place in some form or fashion in our life we've been there we've done it we've come up to the test and we failed or we've come up to the test and we've passed and no matter what it ought to give us an understanding or an appreciation for where that person's at and what it takes sometimes to make the right decision because when you get into tight spots the the right decision is the hard decision and it can be so difficult to step out in faith and say Lord I'm going to trust your word rather than trust what everybody else would tell me to do because a Christian's action or reaction is never the same as the world's ever and so unless you're in the right circle of Fellowship unless you're in the word you're going to be drawn to make the wrong decision time and time again but yet God brings us through it David would say this in Psalms he says because thy loving kindness is better than life he says my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live and I will lift up my hands in thy name remember Jesus said freely you've received freely give his loving kindness we can all testify to it I believe when we got something and he brought us around and he got us to the right place even even maybe we made the wrong decision even maybe we went the wrong way and then his loving kindness comes around and it restores us back to the word so we can have our feet on a secure path and then we can come back and we can Praise Him and thank him for those things and then you see me do it get out of the line or you get out of the line what do we do do we go to restore or do we go to condemn and judge brother Bram says this he says Jesus said if you just do favors for those that do favors for you while the publicans do the same thing but see you must be kind to those that are unkind to you do good for those that would do evil to you always remember that keep that before you that God is watching you rem remember God was good to you when you were evil to him while you were yet sinners Christ died for you our approach ought to be one of understanding of experience of I've been there but here's the beauty of being a mature Christian is with that experience we ought to have a testimony of the faithfulness of God God to his word I me sometimes all people need is that testimony to help them make the right decision remember when brother Dwayne was here and he was talking about tithing and offerings I've never heard somebody get a blessing out of tithes and offerings the way brother Dwayne Fair did nobody's ever given me a vehicle like that but him spending his life on the road hundreds of thousands of kilometers driving his Vehicles into the ground he does the right thing and God gives him exactly what he needs in the exact spec and color that he needs it in that Suburban he had a testimony of the faithfulness of God we have testimony after testimony if you're an entrepreneur we've got brother Joe here we got brother Chad brother Chad's a new entrepreneur and this sort of thing and he's blowing the socks off of it why the goodness of God that's not brother Chad it's not brother Joe it's the goodness of God proving his word so that you can have faith when your situation comes up St that's similar to theirs we've had it for health we've had it for finances we've had it for provision we've had it for deliverance we've had it for healing and yours might take longer than mine and mine might take longer for yours but that testimony is to help and edify the believer next to you through brotherly kindness to say I understand but let me tell you about a God who answers prayer let me tell you about a God who heals let me tell you about a God who provides let me tell you about a God who shows you where you can go and what you can do let me tell you about a God that answers prayer that's what we're here for that brotherly kindness says I understand now let me show you what happens when you follow the word of God let me show you what happens when you make a decision for Christ above yourself let me tell you what happens when you're patient instead of rushing through let me tell you what happens when you cast worry out and fear out and you step into the love of God brother Braham says this he says the hardest thing in the world is somebody being taught one thing and then happen to see something that turns them all the way around when you think you're going right and you somebody preaches something that says you're wrong that's the hardest thing for us to recognize or believe is that I am completely wrong that's the hardest thing that's the most humbling thing is to recognize that in our sincerity in our good intentions we still have done wrong brother says it's the hardest thing he says and that's what's the matter with the Jews that rejected Jesus they've been taught one thing the rabbi said we can't CH that but yet scripturally Jesus was rightly the Messiah but they had it set up some other way he says and today isn't it just as true that we have our own ideas set up he says when God works in wondrous ways his wonders to perform my ways aren't wondrous and as good as you might be your ways aren't wondrous either he says we set it up our way we have a plan you know in boxing they say Everybody's Got A Plan until they get punched this is the approach this is how I'm going to beat this guy I've studied him this is the move he makes I've got him all figured out and then you get punched in the nose and all of a sudden you know where the plan goes right down on the floor with the blood dripping out of your nose we've got our own ways he says but God has wondrous ways and his wondrous ways are tied to his word he says God works in wondrous ways his wonders to perform he works many ways he says and we have it just the way we want it but God will send it to us his provided way for us he says receive it and be rejoicing this brotherly kindness is a recognition that this is a process and that where you're at may not be where somebody else is at and they've got to grow the same way you had to grow to get where you are it's an understanding that we're in a restoring process we're in a redeeming process and it's the washing of Water by the word and listen there's things that God had to deal with me on early that he may never get around to dealing with you because it just doesn't impact your position in the body of Christ and you can do things and say things and have things and and be things that I can't because I'm in a different position than you and then you can do the same thing with me God will deal with you and he doesn't have to deal with that on me because it's not a problem in my life or in my position and we have to be okay with that we have to be okay with those gray areas where somebody's tight and somebody's not but regardless in all these things we've got areas are going to be common we all have health needs we all have financial needs we all have relational needs we all have job needs we all have child needs and all these different things and so we come up to those things and we've got to realize that not everybody's mature as we are mature and sometimes we're not as mature as we think we are either amen but because we see clearly now doesn't mean we always saw clearly and because we make the right decision now doesn't mean we always made it and brotherly kindness reminds us of what we used to be so we can understand where somebody's at and we can work now to draw them up rather than to push them down and condemn them amen that'll temper our attitude towards people if we remember where we came from amen amazing grace Amazing Grace amen Paul said this in Galatians he says Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness he says considering thyself lest thou also be tempted you say brother John I'm not tempted in that I would never do that you don't know what you do until God put you in the Press you don't know what You' do until God puts you in that place and we can sit here in our Ivory tires and say I would never do that you'd be surprised what You' do if you get a little bit weak if God pulls away his hand of grace and mercy you'd be surprised what you'd do David was ready to kill a man because he wouldn't give him some sheep and yet he wouldn't kill Saul David was ready to be a murderer in the heat of passion David took another man's wife when he got away from being where he ought to be don't tell me you'd never do it it's only by God's grace we wouldn't do it and you get so high and proud and hottie and I would never do it and look at them and can't they just get it right listen God will put you in a situation and humble you because Pride goes before a fall and you get proud because you're not where somebody else is look out that is the the opposite of what Christianity ought to be doing or saying he says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ sometimes our burden is to bear bear with somebody else's weakness with without blowing up in understanding being patient with that person's shortcoming until they come to the place of maturity and as mature Believers this is the peak of our of our of our attributes remember this is the seventh one the highest level is to Bear somebody else's burden somebody else's weakness somebody else's maturity until they come to a place where they ought to be and we pay the price for their lack and we do it willingly it's sacrificial he says for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceives himself remember this he said such were some of you he says but ye are washed ye are Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God look at brother brandham he's a seventh Church a messenger he's a word prophet and he comes down he has uh spoken word Authority he's an adopted son of God he's got signs of Wonders that have been unparalleled since Christ was here and he comes down and he goes to the denominations and they love the signs and wonders they love the discernment they love the third pole they love all these things but they refuse his Doctrine and it's just like Christ and watch what he says here he says somebody said not long ago and how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and Oneness and all the rest cuz he's preaching it and they're rejecting him and the doors are closing this is almost at the end of 1962 the doors have been closing for a while now and brother R's been squeezed and squeezed into where they'll actually receive his message he says then put see brotherly kindness hoping someday see it keeps you doing it he says patient with him see temperate enduring with him well I've told them 73 times I've preached it and I preached it and I've taught it and I've told them and they still don't do it temper it he says knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is he says virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness not with frustration not with anger not with offense and hurt he says Let it go out with kindness he says meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in he says see brotherly kindness the seventh thing that's the only two paragraphs he gives us in stature of a perfect man he says put yourself in the other person's place so you can understand where they come from he says and act in a way that shows God you believe that God will bring that person higher that's giving them the benefit of a doubt listen we don't know who our brother and sister is until they are our brother and sister and listen we've still got false brothers and sisters as well so we're supposed to treat each one equally Saul was not a brother until he became Paul but he was a brother all along they just didn't know it cuz he wasn't acting like it amen but remember God tells ananas he says go and pray for Saul he says Lord he's been killing us he's been giving us a hard time we shouldn't be messing with this guy and God says he is a chosen vessel can you imagine if ananas said Lord get yourself another man I ain't doing it he's been he's been bothering us he's been putting us in jail I know somebody he killed just last week no ananas in brotherly kindness you went you ever read your Bible he says brother Saul brother Saul he says the Lord came to me told me to come pray for you that you'll receive your sight and then he went out and baptized him and Paul got the Holy Ghost and he never looked back brother Saul the accuser of the Brethren the Jailer the Tormentor brother Saul we look around this church and we see people from across Canada we've got people from across the Western Hemisphere and we've got people from across the globe we've got black people white people brown people we've got different cultures we've got people from different religions we've we got people from no religions we've got people from all walks of life we've got people that have only been in this church all their life and we've got people that have been in multiple churches all their life amen we've got different ways of response we've got different ways of worship we've got different ways of reacting to things and that's sometimes what causes us the greatest test of Brotherly kindness somebody's different than you are and you know what it is tradition it's culture so many of the things that causes friction have nothing nothing to do with the actual word of God we tend to believe exactly on Doctrine be somebody does it this way or they don't do it that way and all of a sudden we get up and arms about it why tradition and culture and it has nothing to do with who we are amen I've been around the world there's remember brother Bram said there's a national spirit I went to Russia and Russia is somber and kind of sad and Melancholy I could never live in Russia it felt depressing to me but that's their Natural Spirit then you go to America America and America's louder and more boisterous and more joyous and more very outward then you go to Africa they worship like nobody else can worship you go to South America and they've got a a calmer more contented a more peaceful type of nature very happy with life in general very very content in in in the Simplicity of their life and yet you go to every single one of those places and you meet people and you immediately connect because they're a part part of the family of God but you know what would happen if I stuck around long enough I'd find places of friction because their Traditions are different than mine and their culture is different than mine but that's not what makes us Believers that's not what makes us part of the body of Christ what makes us a part of the body of Christ is the holy spirit in your life and the Holy Spirit In My Life by One Spirit we're baptized into this body not by One Pastor not by one church not by one tradition not by one culture it's by one spirit and I have been to all of those places and I have met Believers and I knew without a shadow of a doubt we were we were part of the same body and God accepts their worship the same as mine whether it's a what I would say a higher level or a lower level it did not matter God accepts it because that's how he's made them and he works with them in that way but we'll sit there and we'll say no that can't be it why tradition and culture sometimes these things like I said clash and they cause misunderstanding and like I said it's not spiritual it's not scriptural it's just the way that we've been raised in these things it has nothing to do and it's just a tradition or preference of the way we look at these things and that happens and all of a sudden you know what God's doing rubbing the bumps off of us those little lumps of humanity and you know what you've got them and I've got them and it's brotherly kindness that Smooths those things out where we don't look at those things and say well they're not in the message they just need a new birth no we need to grow and they do too probably amen what do we do we've got people I've run into many now and they'll smile to your face and stab you in the back when you walk away they'll talk good to your face they'll talk bad about you when they go out amen the they'll say one thing they'll do another and it's fellow Believers fellow professing Believers and what do we do in those situations so often the Temptation is to gather the scriptures and gather the quotes to build a castle of defense that puts them in their place that's what we tend to do we're talking on brotherly kindness now but the natural inclination is to fortify yourself as to why you're allowed to be hurt as to why you're allowed to be offended as to why you're allowed to separate from fellowship as to why you're allowed to not support that person as to why you'll never have them over again and we build up all the quotes about what they did wrong and all the scriptures about how they're off the word of God and you know what we don't do go read every bit of the word that tells us how we're supposed to react and we sit there on the side of the road in the Ivory Tower of our hurt and offense because we've got a word reason for it all and you know what's happening is Satan is coming in and we've got a root of bitterness in in our lives and and it just takes us completely it takes the joy out of our life it kicks the holy spirit away and we just get bitter and we get worn out in these different things why cuz it's way easier for me to read about why brother brother Bob is wrong than it is for how I ought to respond to brother Bob for taking my water in the service where I was speaking to him so nicely right it's way easier to put the burden on the other person than ourselves brotherly kindness says I'm going to take it to me and react the way the word tells me to react rather than try and correct them because if you can respond rightly now then you can invite them to come to the right place but if you blow up if you withdraw them what do they have they've got nobody to help them out they may not even realize where they're at they may not even realize where the weakness is they may not even realize where they're immature and if you don't give the right answer they don't have the word but if you can respond rightly in meekness remember what Paul says and you can come in meekness then maybe perhaps God will use you to help them out but if we stand in this Castle we built of our right to not engage and to be hurt we can't help anybody I'm sitting on the sidelines and guess what I'll stagnate with that root of bitterness that root of frustration that offense for the rest of my life until I make it right with God and go back and actually make it right with that brother or sister I'll stagnate see this is outward looking but it does benefit us inwardly when we do these things if we've really got it remember we're supposed to act independent of the person we do what the word says regardless of whether they do it forgiveness is as much for me as for the other person if I don't forgive God won't even hear my prayer and if God doesn't hear my prayer church I don't know where I'd be but it's real lonely and it's real cold and it's real formal and it's real starchy when I can't forgive so these things are for my benefit not for theirs but in the end they benefit the most because it gives them an opportunity to come to a higher plane amen Paul would say this in Ephesians 4 as we start to close this is the last thing that Paul says in his stature of a perfect Man chapter he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor I love that word clamor you know what clamor means getting worked up getting all up in arms getting riled up the world is completely Bound by clamor these days they'll take the smallest thing and they'll blow it up into the biggest issue it's an overreaction time and time again Paul says get that out of your life he says and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind to one another what does that look like brother John well brother Paul says it means tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you you'll see that kindness brotherly kindness is tied to forgiveness remember brother brandham said when that couple was making out he said I forgive you don't do it again but the first words out of his mouth were I forgive you and and you'll see that it's tied the same thing in brotherly kindness is that we forgive even if they don't ask for forgiveness that's the key to brotherly kindness is that you can forgive you can look past you can ignore their actions and you just come through and do the right thing for their sake not for your sake it'll benefit you but it's primarily for them not for you brother Braham says that's why I want to put all my life for the Lord Jesus he says everything that I can do for him he says and I can only serve him as I serve his people you can only love him as you love each other I can only love him as I love you and you love me and together we love God and we become his children in that I serve you and you serve me and that's how we're serving God Jesus said in so much as you've done it unto the least of these little ones you've did it unto me he says if we want a blessing let's be a blessing to somebody else and a blessing will return like casting your bread upon the Water it'll return and that's true in all walks of life you'll find that you usually reap just as you show so he says so let's do good talk good good and be kind and people talk about us we'll say good things and kind things and good things will come our way if we'll give them out easy to read hard to do he says how you will you know how will the world know that you love Jesus when we love one another he says that's how the world see God sees your faith the world sees your actions you know what that means actions really do matter because the world can listen to your words but they're going to judge you by your actions so you can have all the good intentions in your heart and you can have all the right doctrines and you can have the word but if you don't act upon it then the world is going to call you a hypocrite rightly so he says the world sees your actions love one another now be kind to one another talk with one another be patient with one another I highlighted that talk with one another because so many times that's the biggest issue when we're coming to brotherly love because we talk about one another rather than talk with one another we talk about the situation rather than addressing the situation and what happens is we make it bigger we magnify the issue rather than minimize the issue now the hardest thing to do is have a hard conversation with somebody you go to somebody remember I told you about that brother that I defended and I didn't know it and he was treating me differently and I didn't know it because I'm clueless that way and he called me aside before remember and he said I need to talk to you and then he told me that I'd said something that hurt him and I cried and I I said I was sorry and I asked his forgiveness and we hugged and we made up and everything was good after that but I had no idea I'd hurt that brother until he came and told me but he didn't go tell everyone else brother John heard him he came to me and he sorted it out and that took courage that took courage because as men we don't like to say you hurt me we don't like to go to somebody and say what you did there I feel that was wrong but having the conversation what it does is it allows you to get to the the the motive and the objective rather than just the impact if somebody comes to me and says brother John you hurt me I'll say I'm sorry no matter if what I did was right or wrong because I am sorry I hurt you that doesn't mean I'm sorry for what I did but I'm sorry I hurt you and we always ought to be able to to apologize for the impact of our actions not the intent remember brother Brown talks about the Shepherd that breaks the the Sheep's leg keeps wandering away keeps wandering away he breaks the leg so that he has to carry it all the time so that the Sheep becomes dependent and wants to be around the shepherd sometimes we do things that are hard and it hurts people and we can say I'm sorry it hurt you even though it was the right thing to do but we focus on their hurt rather than it's the right thing to do brother says this so then you see what he did let that be your example in the house here that we want to be a house that he'll be honored in with everything every office every place that there be no taking back there be gentleness and sweetness and kindness he says but just straight on the line every man at his post a duty you can stay tight with the word and not be a jerk you can stay tight with the word and not intentionally be offensive you can do it with sweetness with gentl with kindness he says every man at his post of Duty see that's the way he wants it he never slagged when it came time to say and call what was what he called it right we don't back down remember we don't compromise on emotion we don't compromise because we understand he says but when it come time to show gentleness then he showed gentleness he was sweet kind understanding but Stern and everything was right to the dot with him and he did that for your example amen amen let's stand together if the musicians would come brotherly kindness the toughest of all of these because it puts us squarely in the position of showing not just by words but by actions how much we value the other person rather than ourselves and that's the toughest thing to do this is we're getting to the place of sacrifice and it's only the holy ghost that really is a higher level of sacrifice than this but when we in love gentleness can point to them the way they ought to go rather than standing in that that that castle we built of our hurts and offensive offenses amen it seeks restoration listen to this it seeks restoration rather than Reformation because remember brother Bron would say you talk about you know people in jail and people doing thing wrong he says we're not reformers we're here to convert you not reform you I don't want you to act right because I tell you I want you to act right because God's working in your life and that's what we're doing is we're restoring we're trying to bring them back to the word of God not back to where I feel comfortable or where I feel better or where I'm not hurt we're trying to bring them back to their position in Christ amen and so it seeks to elevate them from where they are to where the word wants them to be amen and by a right response we limit the damage to them that's caused by a poor response I I I if you do the wrong thing and I respond poorly there's no hope for that situation but if you do poorly and I do correctly There's Hope hope because now you're not offended by my reaction and I can potentially work with you and if I do something wrong and you react very nicely to me you know what it'll usually shame me and I'll realize hey I stepped out of line there and it makes it easier for me to come back and be restored in those things as well and all it is is we're giving each other the opportunity to grow as God grows us not at the rate that I want listen as a pastor I want everyone to grow overnight that's the that's what we would love wouldn't we love our children to just basically be born and within the first 3 years just have everything worked out that would be our desire but that's not the way it works and so that that that brotherly kindness that patience with where people are at helps them grow in a real way rather than a forced way and allows God to work with them rather than us amen it's tough it's tough like I said this is the highest this is this is the the the high point you can go as a Christian before you get the Holy Ghost and God's testing us and he tries us you take young people you go to school and somebody does you wrong somebody says something about you sisters you know they make fun of your clothes or your hair they don't do this and they don't do that and the boys won't look at this and they won't talk about that and they don't like the jokes and they make fun of you that's your test of Brotherly kindness but then as you get older it comes into the church and maybe somebody in the church hurts you and what do you do do we shut him down do we put him away do we dechristianize him or do we respond in love amen considering ourselves that we could just as easily fall into the same thing if God pulled his hand of Grace away from us amen man it gives us grace and patience for the person next to us I say God help us amen the next thing is the Holy Ghost and he's got to build this Temple Before He'll take us to that place amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what a challenge you've placed in front of us and Lord looking in the reflection of the word Lord seeing my own weaknesses many times Lord we get frustrated we get tired we get weary and then Satan will inject something in Lord God I pray that you'd raise up a standard in our life Lord Jesus Lord I pray that the word would cast it out Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would guard us Lord that there would be a hedge of protection about us Lord that when Satan would try and separate us Lord when Satan would try and cause Cal conflict or misunderstanding Lord that brotherly kindness would raise up Lord that there be no no friction Lord that there be no Schism between us Lord but that we would cleave one to another that we be United in bonds of Love Lord that we would look for the word in each other rather than the world Lord and that our hearts would be gracious Lord that the mercy and love that you've shown us Lord would flow out from our lives to those that are around us Lord I pray you lift us higher Lord give us strength Lord for the day Lord strength for the trial and the test Lord I pray you help us to just keep the faith Lord to look to you as the author and finisher of these things Lord bless your people now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen let's sing that song Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary you know that 525 Lord prepare me to be a [Music] sanctuary pure
