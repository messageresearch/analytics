their lives we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen and amen thank you musicians that'll be it this morning if you turn your scriptures to numbers 21 numbers 21. i mean i was just talking to brother joe there before service and and i said who's preaching there this morning he said brother tim and i said you're probably ready to sit back and take a break i said my voice still hasn't recovered and i didn't even preach this weekend so uh he he had mentioned that his voice was going on wednesday and i'm pretty sure it was a joke but i'm not sure actually he he anyways he got up and he preached and we thanked the lord for it amen so certainly he was very happy to be here he's very complimentary of the church he was so thankful for the fellowship for the kindness of the people and uh i from my heart i want to say thank you to those all of us amen it's not a work of one or two it's not the work of the minister amen it's the work of a people that will unite and pull together and do their part so we have people that host it we have people that sang specials we have people that practice with different ones and we had people that you know asked for fellowship and and did all these things and and that's what makes a service like that happen it's not just the one man coming amen but it's each one of us getting in and putting our our shoulder to the wheel and i do apologize we had a lot of requests for fellowship and meetings with brother jones sister jessica and unfortunately there was only so much time and so i kind of did it on a first come first serve basis but uh i know that a lot of people want him to come back at some point and he wants to come back so we'll see when that is but certainly we would trust that he'll be back at some point amen but so thankful for that and you know it's funny because god has a timing for everything and i talked to brother joe back before november i guess it would have been september october and said you know we'd like to have you come up and and he said i want to come up and then he came back he said but i don't think i can come up my my wife doesn't have her vaccinations and she doesn't have an up-to-date passport it's just too tight it's just too tight maybe we could put it off so we put it off till the spring we gave him the winter off so that they wouldn't die of exposure up here and uh and we find the timing was perfect all that called it in september was get him ready and then to get him prepared so that when the time for when god's time came along then he could come and he could meet the need exactly when the need was was was was there and when people were ready to accept him amen there's a time for all of these things and there's a season for it and so we trust god that that no matter what's happening amen if it looks like maybe it's not going quite the way we want it or or someone's not here when we want them to do or the sermon wasn't just what we want to trust that it's coming in god's timing and when you have the need and you're ready to receive it god will send the answer your way amen amen i want to preach this morning on a service a title called nothing less than total victory i want to kind of pick up where brother joe left off and in numbers 21 verse 1 it says and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against israel and took some of them prisoners and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into mine hand then i will utterly destroy their cities and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place horma amen god bless you you can have your seats this morning amen i want to perhaps take a couple services over the next few weeks uh we're leaving on vacation blanco will be leaving on the 11th and i'm leaving on the 21st for a couple of weeks but in those times as brother gerald would have me minister i kind of want to finish out that that last series on authority to believe and and kind of do just a clincher maybe of the services we had this weekend and and kind of kind of just finish them out a little bit so as i said i want to take a title here of nothing less than total victory and as i was just praying about this and and just dwelling on these things that the phrase that kept coming to my mind was utterly destroy and men utterly destroy and we see that in the scriptures that the utterly destroyed phrases used so much in the old testament it's when the israelites were going into the land of canaan and god said utterly destroy he said leave nothing in your wake don't leave anything alive don't leave any women or children or anything like that utterly destroy everything that's on your property because i've given it to you and anything you leave alive is going to cause you problems down the road so he was saying what have a total victory amen make sure that what you you're you're claiming is totally clean of everything on it that would try and get it back amen amen we've had a number of service and when we have a number of services and the spirit of god is moving so strongly the holy spirit's moving in lives you know it it's wonderful it's a wonderful thing now it's a wonderful thing when it's moving but you know what's more wonderful is when we can recognize what's going on and we can step into that channel and we can receive what god has for us amen it's nice to sit there and raise your hands and worship but it's even more wonderful when you're there to receive something amen when it's not just somebody else that raises their hands or gets the victory but when you get the victory amen when you get a blessing when you get an answer to prayer that's really where we want to be in those sorts of services but then the special meetings are over and some poor schmuck has to come up and take the first service after that amen it's the hardest service to preach is the one right after the special services and everything's been going so good so brother gerald threw me under the bus this morning i feel no not really it's okay brother jail amen but what happens is what the local ministry is left to carry on the battle amen and we've sometimes got to go back to to the old manner you know the mana that we normally get rather than the honey and the and the and the the quail and all these different things amen it's okay to smile like brother ellie's smiling at me and then it's nice to have a change isn't it but we still end up going back to the to the same old don't we we've got to just carry on bit by bit those services are a lot of times it's not just one step you take but it's two or three or five or ten and it gets you moving quickly but then you've got to keep stepping on and then you can't just stay in that one experience and and i love what brother chad said this morning he says we've got the same opportunity this morning don't we it's not it doesn't have to be a shouting sermon we le service we love those we love the worship we love the praise but the point is to keep moving on and then we god is not the limiting factor in these services god is never the limiting factor the limiting factor is us and our expectation and our pull and and whether we're going to come in and put our shoulder to the wheel amen amen whatever it is that we got we got to step in the right direction i believe this weekend you know but that doesn't mean the battle is over i think for many of us what we'll realize over the next week and month is is that we've really just joined the battle you know we've really just stepped into the battle the the first battle was to take courage and to step forward and ask something of god or accept something of god as the case may be to receive something but now the battle has just been joined in many ways amen if you've got healing guess what satan's going to come behind he's going to try and take your healing if you've gotten deliverance he's going to come back and try and put the very thing that you were delivered from back on you whatever it is that you claimed whatever it is that you received satan's going to come back he's going to try and knock holes in that faith isn't he he's going to come back he's trying he's going to try and get you to overthink things he's going to try and get you to dwell on what happened rather than accept it and move on in the will of god in the word of god amen amen satan's going to try and take back whatever it is that you took from him this weekend amen but we don't want to let him to do that brother branham would say this he'd say that that's people today if you'd only see when i tell you about divine healing you'd say well brother branham look i was prayed for last night and i can't move my hand anymore he's saying you can't move it more than you did the day before that don't have one thing to do with it not a thing it's yours go get it sure god give it to you them israelites god didn't just get up there and take his bush and sweep all of them out all the canaanites out he said now come in here here you are sit down never did god do that we see the sovereign work of god so many times and you know you look at jericho their first major vic their first victory when they crossed over it was a sovereign work of god but everything after that they had to do the hard way right and we see that enough times in special services you see a sovereign work of god and now you got to get into the battle now you got to start doing the work now you got to start fighting to take your land and this is what bradley brown is saying he's saying god never went in and swept out the canaanites because the promised land belonged to the israelites he said now you got to go in and do it you got to take me at my word you got to put your sword to the test you got to put your life on the line you got to put your faith on the line and when you do that then you'll see them move out but i'm done here i'll back you up but now you got to take my word and move forward with it he says you show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works he's quoting james see you've got to go do it and you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the spirit of god knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground and toe the mark with satan that toe the mark we don't understand that these days but in the old days when you're having a boxy match they draw a line in the middle of the sand they didn't even fight in a ring the way we used to they do it on dirt and they draw a line in the sand right here and to start the match you had to come up and toe the line if you couldn't get your strength together if you couldn't get off off the ground if you didn't have the the the unction to come to that line and toe the line then the match was over and the other guy won before you could fight you had to toe the line and then when you told the line that signaled that you were ready to fight and the match would go until somebody got knocked down then they go back to their corners and then you had to come out and told the line again and again and again you had to tow the line to keep battling brother brown says every inch of ground you've got you've got to toe the line and say i'm in here to win i'm in here to fight amen i'm in here to take what's mine but he says you got to come up and toe the line you got to signify that you're going to be in this for the long haul he says every inch of ground you've got to toe the mark with satan isn't that right friends this is not a picnic this is a battleground see we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle amen we're in a battle this is not a sit back at your ease and let god do everything but he says you're gonna have to fight satan for everything that you're going to get everything god's given you satan's camped out on it and he's just trusting like the land that i have below me that you'll ignore the signs and say well that doesn't belong to me you're going to have to fight for it now i read that opening scripture of the israelites on the way to the promised land for a reason because they haven't claimed the land here they're just going through they've sent the spies and the canaanites here they send spy so they attack them and what happens is they've been walking and they've been led by that cloud of uh uh uh the pillar of cloud by day in the fire night but uh cloud of fire by night is the columbus and the catooka song over the weekend and then they've been led by this and they get into a fight and it wasn't of their own choosing because they weren't in the land but the canaanites come out and they grab somebody and they take them in battle and they take prisoners now you notice they don't kill the prisoners you know what sometimes we'd be easier off if they just killed them because we wouldn't have to worry about them too much what's done is done we'd say but it's it's that lingering uh worry it's that lingering fear when they've got somebody you love and you don't know what they're going to do and you don't know if they'll kill them if you attack you know if you should hold back if you should negotiate these things these were hostages basically and israel's seeing they're saying what are we going to do you know what are we going to do but they didn't let it hold them back they went to god because guess what they had the pillar of cloud by day and they had the pillar fire by night they had the presence of the lord in the camp they had the shout of the king and the camp so they went to that king and they said look we need to get our people back they we need to get our people back they belong to us it doesn't matter what caused them to be taken over there we need them back right we got to get them back they're a part of us and as long as they're alive we're going to keep fighting amen we're not going to let satan take him we're not going to let satan have the victory over them we're going to go back in and we're going to take him and they made a promise to god and it said and israel vow to vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities they didn't say if you'll give us the people then we'll be very happy for it we'll give you the praise of glory the honor but they said if you'll give us the the prisoners back then we'll destroy every bit of the enemy that took them amen we will not leave anything left for them to attack us in the future we'll take care of business so that we don't have to do it in the future we're going to deal with the situation right now amen will destroy their families their homes their wealth their seat of power their fortresses everything that they've used to to uh set themselves up to attack us we'll destroy and level every single bit of it amen god only needs one man he only needs one woman that's dedicated to his purpose but when he gets a group of people that are committed to those one things that god wants done then look out because nothing can stop them remember in the the tower of babel what did they say god said look at the men they're so united that if they stay this way nobody's going to be able to stop them and so he had to stop it at the beginning he had to break them up by giving them different languages because when men are united when women are united in a common goal nothing can stop them and israel comes and they says we're united on this one thing god if you'll give it to us we'll finish the job we're not just going to get them back but we'll erase those canaanites completely out of there it says in the lord hearken to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them in their cities and he called the name of the place horma now brother braham says now you see we are not a divided people if we're divided then we got to make sure we we do what we wrap it up in bonds of love and then love overcomes that's what we're looking for is a love that overcomes every break in every every division that's amongst us he says we're not a divided people we've got to be in unity why listen to this because each one of us is holding a part of god and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sits together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of god is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again so when someone is missing from our ranks whether it's because they're sick because they're working or for whatever reason what happens is what we're missing a part of the body we're missing a part of the pillar of fire in this service you notice this weekend and i said it to a number of people this is the first set of special meetings we've had in over two years where every single one of us was able to make it do you think it made a difference absolutely it made a difference why because every lick of fire was here every lick of fire was united with the purpose of god every lick of fire was here pulling on the words so that it could have an effect in our lives amen we didn't come here for some saying or some minister to tell us beautiful words we came to see the power of god moving in our midst and changing lives and we saw it didn't we why every single one of us was unified in purpose amen amen if you're unified god can't stop us it's when we're divided that we get into trouble isn't it you look at these israelites and we don't get the ones that were captured and made prisoner we don't get any details as to what happened maybe they were rookies maybe they were rookies and they just weren't good enough and they got overpowered you know maybe they got out of line somewhere maybe they said oh we can flank them this way and they got into trouble and they got captured but israel didn't say ah look every battle we gotta lose a couple it's the end time we know that everything that's gonna be shaken will be shaken those are some that got shaken no no no they said look not a one of us has to lose a life in these battles not a one of us has to be taken prisoner and if we're taking prisoner none of one of us has to stay in prison amen it doesn't matter what caused them to be taken prisoner whether it was their fault or our fault we're going to go and we're going to bring them back and we're going to make sure that they're restored to our ranks amen and they wouldn't stop until they had the family back and the enemy totally and completely destroyed and we know that after that there was a lot of war after they went into the the land of canaan there was a lot of war and it went on for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and it's only under the reign of david that we see that that is finally put to an end david was a man of blood and what he was doing was he was setting up for the millennial reign with solomon wasn't he he was doing all the work beforehand so that solomon could sit there and he could reign in peace that's right right and that was a type for us amen is that in the in the millennial reign we don't fight anymore that's right right satan is is completely thwarted he has nobody to work in and that's what thwarts me man that's what will thwart him in this church today is when he can't touch one of us amen when we turn him down at every opportunity and we say not on my watch amen not in my life not in my family not in my mind not in my emotions whatever it might be when we turn him down flat amen but under solomon brother branham talks about the people were in unity not just with one another but they were in unity with god because remember when they did the the temple then the presence of god came down so much that they couldn't even speak that's how powerful it was i was talking to brother john anders one time i said brother john i said what would you do if you're in a service i said the presence of god was so strong you couldn't speak he said that would be the perfect service he says because god's speaking not me he says that's god speaking perfectly to the people he's moving in lives if the minister is silent that means that god's speaking to hearts and individuals amen that would be a wonderful place if we could get if we could get me out of the way so much that it would be god speaking directly to you amen amen but he's still speaking he's still speaking regardless of what we think amen but brother brahms talking of solomon's reign he says all the nations feared israel and instead of trying to make war with them they brought in peace offerings it says they were not afraid so much of their men they were afraid of that god that they were all in unity with amen amen when we can put our differences aside because what we're all serving the same god i'm not talking about it we'll align with denominations in these things because we're serving the same god but i'm saying we're under the same message we're under the same umbrella we're going to the same place let's make sure we have unity amongst us amen he says if you'd only look up unity comes from god and the power of god when the believer the creation here on earth that god has created is united with god then there comes a unity and it gives faith and when a man sees that he's persistent and nobody's going to shake him i want you to just take a moment this morning to think about what it is that satan has taken from you or maybe something that he took and you got back amen where has your struggle been and what impact has it had on you over the past past few weeks or months or years i want you to look at what it was like and then look at what it what it is like this morning amen maybe you didn't get something back maybe you're still fighting for maybe you didn't get the victory this weekend that you were looking for maybe you don't have proof of proof positive of the promise in your life yet amen some of us maybe we were sleeping on duty and we got woken up a bit some of us were tired out and guess what he gave us a couple days of rest and and a couple nights of good sleep so to speak and and a couple of you know good meals to get us refreshed and then some of us we got pulled into the battle for the first time maybe we've been sitting back and letting others do it but whatever it was that happened amen all that we can say is that satan's going to be persistent to try and take it back from you amen if there's one thing we can say about him brother bram said say good things about everyone he says one good thing about satan he's a good enemy yeah he's good at doing what he does doesn't he's persistent he doesn't give up amen he's never stopped harassing you know nagging or sniping at believers in all of his life he never lets he never sits back he never sits back he never rests he never takes a break right he's always there he's always trying to get at us amen i'm not trying to quench your enthusiasm this morning i'm trying to say take what you've got and move forward with it brother brother joe preached on what what next and he says move on and i'm telling you what does that move on look like this morning we're going to go into that a little bit this morning amen i'm letting you know the battle's going to continue you've won a victory let's keep winning victories amen let's keep practicing let's keep our sword sharp let's keep our our shield of faith up let's keep that armor of the of god on us so that we know that when he comes we're going to be prepared for these things amen amen it can't just be a weekend of services for us amen that daily experience with god is what's going to keep you and sustain you as you go amen and you've got to put everything you've got on the line amen you've got to put everything you've got on the line to hold on to what he's given and to press forward and man give it your all give it your all is what we're talking about now brother brown would say this he said unless you are deeply sincere and you can't be sincere until you're positive and you understand if you're presuming or guessing or hoping so then there cannot be a depth of sincerity that god requires it faith is not a hope so or it could be right it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's your absolute it's a thing you're tied to see you have come to your ultimate that it is the truth it's nothing but the truth and it must be thus he says and then when you realize that in your mind then you've got to approach it with your whole life soul body all that's in you just completely sell out everything to it that's how you know somebody is convinced is when they give everything they've got to it amen when you put everything you've got to it when you put everything on the line that's when you know that you really believe what you're talking about he says jesus as jesus so graciously taught us in the man buying pearls and he found that one pearl of great price and he sold all his others to get to it all the truths and everything he had though they were good pearls this one meant all to him amen you can't be casual to this he's saying you got to be committed you got to be focused you got to take it seriously and you've got to look and fight for it with all that you have he says and when you find god's ultimate his word a promise upon a certain thing you must know first that it is god's word that the thing that you're seeing being done is god amen you've got to realize that whatever happened to you in those services was god it was not brother joe adams it was not sister jessica adams it was not somebody singing specials it was not somebody leading songs it was not just an atmosphere but it was almighty god moving in your life and if you don't believe that it will not hold it will not stay and satan will snatch it right out of your grasp very easily amen he says when you find god's ultimate his word a promise upon a certain thing you must know that first that it is god's word that the thing that you're seeing being done is god there's no maybe so it could be it looks like it might be he says it is god then when you get to that spot then that's the pearl of great price what it is god that's your pearl of great price when you are convinced that it is god you must get away then from anything that anybody else tells you contrary to it you must not look to what man has achieved you must look to what god has said and what he promised and see him to do it then that's your ultimate right there then everything that you are everything that you was everything that you hope to be must be placed upon this just as though it was death and life to you at that moment amen i talked to many of you after the services and and throughout the week afterwards there were many minis there were many things that were ministered to people there are many testimonies of people in many different ways that god touched amen and there was ones that had different problems different thoughts conditions situations and spirits and discernment was going forth to tell you about those things amen but what happened there is that people said what if i recognize that the spirit of the lord is here he doesn't just come for no reason because the scripture says where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom so if the spirit of the lord is here to discern what my problem is then that means the spirit of the lord is here to give me freedom from the situation that i'm in from the problem that i have from whatever it might have been that was holding you back or binding you or causing you issues the spirit of the lord is not there just to tell you about it but the spirit of the lord is there to give you a total freedom from that thing amen it is not there to just say god is here but it's there to say god wants to move and act in your life amen amen what is he saying when that spirit is moving what does he want what is what he wants you to do is jump in and say lord touch me amen i know things that are going on this church in people's lives because you've told me about them and i pray about them and you share them you say brother john pray for this or remember this or remember that so when i'm listening to what's going on there and i'm saying lord you're speaking help them to catch it amen as a minister i'm not just listening for myself but i'm listening for the needs in the congregation and when you hear it going forth i can't tell you how many times i just started to grin and that's in that seat back there because i said lord you're hitting it and he doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't have a clue and he got off his notes plenty of times if you were wondering he didn't know what was going on amen but what is it when god's getting personal with us it's a signal to get on board because he's wanting to do something in our lives and it's the hardest thing sometimes when it hurts when it hurts and you say ah really god really but what is it when he's getting personal with you it's because he wants to stay personal with you and then all he's doing is he's saying come up child come up son come up donner not necessarily come up for prayer but come up a little higher amen when i call your name come up a little higher and let's have a walk and let's move past this together amen amen he cares enough to call your name do you care enough to respond i mean that's what we're looking for in these situations brother brahm says you cannot work until you know the will of god a promise in the bible that tells you a certain thing that's god's word then he sends his spirit back into the church and gifts to manifest himself just to comb out the little differences and so forth to make himself real amongst us oh what how could we ask for anything different see than when he comes to us and makes himself so known so personalized himself god amongst his people what more could you ask for than when he gets personal with you amen that's the god we want as a personal god so if he's personal to clear out your problems and guess what he's going to add on top of that he's going to build line upon line and word upon word he doesn't just want it to be a weekend of meetings but he wants it to be a life of meetings with him that are personal between you and him amen amen as the services were progressing and i saw that word going forth i said to brother joe i said brother joe i can't tell you what's going on but i can tell you to keep speaking and then keep preaching keep going in the direction you're going take heart even if you don't know what's going on but the spirit of the lord is speaking to people in this church and into situations about which you have no knowledge amen and after it's all said done then i say as brother brahm did what more could we ask except that he came in and was personal to us amen what is it you got reset you got back to your pulse of duty you got energized you got saved you got aligned you got healed now what are you going to do with it are you just going to say i'm healed are you going to move on with your healing are you going to move on with your testimony are you going to move on into the good things that god hath has with you i mean what are you going to do with your personal god now what are you going to do with your personal god it can't just be for this time it's got to be a continuation of that amen because what satan would love nothing better than for us to stop and say that was a weekend of great meetings and leave it in the past that's exactly what he wants us he wants it to be a thing of the past amen and that we would try and praise the lord and live off that experience for three or four months that is not the way god works we do not live off of a past experience amen we don't sail by yesterday's wind amen we need a day by day experience with him a living god that's with us each and every day amen so satan would love it if we just held on to that until it peters out to nothing and then we're let left sitting there dry on the side of the road wondering where god is and then we've got to water that experience we've got to water that ex that event that was in our lives amen israel didn't stop with just getting one person back they didn't stop with getting all the prisoners back they went until they had a total and complete victory and they had utterly destroyed amen and the enemy was never going to come back amen and then once the enemy got on the run they kept him on the run they say the hardest thing to turn around is an enemy that's on their own an enemy that thinks they've been defeated and they're running is the hardest one to turn around because they've lost every bit of will to fight they don't think they can do it they don't believe they can do it they don't trust the people around them to help them do it and so if you can keep them running when they're running then you'll get the victory far more easily amen don't give them a place to set up and set it make a stand to try and hold you back and turn you back amen israel always got into trouble when they didn't go all the way that was that was that was their besetting sin was they never went all the way amen god told them over and over again he said utterly destroy whatever's in your path don't leave anything don't leave anything don't leave anything i don't care how good it looks how cute it looks i can't imagine being a soldier in that army and you're going and you're seeing a little baby maybe in the crib and guess what you got to kill it why because what satan offers you in the beginning will look cute it'll look attractive it'll look easy it'll be i can change this i can use this to my benefit i can control it yeah right what could this baby do but guess what that baby's going to grow into a big moabite one day and he's going to remember what you did to his mom and his papa and he's going to want revenge isn't he it didn't matter how nice it looked you had to kill it right then and there i can't imagine the ptsd that maybe they dwelt with over those time brutal but guess what and maybe that was their thing was they said you know what i just can't do it and they had to pay for it each and every time every time it came back and it bit them amen amen amen you better know you're up against an army and no matter how small it is today one day it's going to grow into a big demon you got to recognize it as a demon up front you got to recognize it as a satanic influence up front or it's going to destroy you bit by bit by bit and then you've got to kill it while you've got power over it brother brown says this and every man and woman could be as persistent as samson was as long as you can feel that power of promise around you of god what is that power promise here is the word the word said so he says and you can be perseverant as long as you know that you've got that promise in your heart that faith that told you while you were sitting here now that faith says i'm healed i'm healed see you feel that just keep walking on brother god will take care of the philistines don't you worry did you ever think how samson with that old jawbone of the mule you know how thick those helmets were some of them was an inch or an inch and a half of solid brass you could take a two-handed sword and hit him on the head and it wouldn't hurt him he says and samson took that old dry dry jawbone of the mule and picked it up and beat down a thousand of them why the first lick on top of one of them heads that jawbone would have went to a million pieces dried out bone doesn't hold up long especially against tempered brass he says why the first lick on top of one of them had that jawbone would have went to a million pieces but see the miracle was in the jawbone the same as in samson it doesn't matter what you're holding as long as god has blessed it amen amen you say draw your sword i don't have a sword what do you have what do you say to moses moses what do you have in your hand a staff good i'll use the staff then and then if god puts it in your hand if god makes a provision for you he's going to make sure that it lasts all the way to the full victory amen and and samson felt if i can feel that promise there where in the jawbone he said then bring them on and brother he began to knock philistines right and left why he was persistent until the last philistine was laying on the ground amen he says what did he have not very much you say brother john i don't have very much i've just started on this path i just got a single touch that doesn't seem like much all samson had was a dried-up jawbone and he went up against a thousand armored philistines and killed every single one of them he said he had a mule's jaw to fight against swords and spears and trained men but he had the power of god on him amen you got to know that you've got the power of god on you if you've got the holy spirit inside of you you notice the power of god came upon him first what was the first thing that the power of god did for him freedom freed him to what fight that's what's happened to you you've been freed to fight because when an anointed son or daughter of god picks up a weapon and their anointed that weapon becomes anointed as well that's what he's talking about here it freed him to fight and then when he started fighting the power of god kept him until he destroyed every enemy he said oh brother fight till every symptom's gone hallelujah fight till every doubt is gone say well my case is different take that jawbone and knock it out of there this one said but you know i'm just a little different i'm getting too old knock it out abraham was a hundred go on old folks no excuses young folks no excuses middle-aged married single man woman it matters not it matters not we see an evidence of faith in every single believer in the bible and we see it whether they were big or small they was a 15 year old right and then you got abraham was a hundred right pick your poison doesn't matter we've got an example for every single thing amen you don't have any excuse anymore the power of god is on you if you've got the holy spirit he says use it to defeat your enemy amen don't ignore the words of the holy spirit don't look at it as brother joe look at it as the speaking of the holy spirit into your lives personally amen don't go halfway with it don't just think about it think about it by all means meditate on it we're supposed to meditate on the things of god amen but act on it act on it step forward with it put it into your life put it on your lips put it into your testimony amen move forward don't stand on that experience but move forward with that experience and grow it into more amen i mean i believe brother paul spoke on watering your experience with the young people what feeding what god has done so it'll grow into something even bigger amen what is it as brother brahms talk about there he's saying let that power of god flow through you to burn out whatever it is that you have need of in you if it's inside of you let it burn that but let it come out of you too because guess what we don't always go around with the jawbone sometimes we got to go around with what love we got to beat it with love sometimes we're going in we're trying to beat it with strength and calling it out and this and that the other no no sometimes you just gotta love your way through it like i talked about that bull with brother branham so many of us would have said well i'm the prophet of god get out of my way i'm coming in his name and he said i'm so sorry didn't mean to disturb you i was so intent on the work that i was doing that i didn't realize you were here and i disturb you he says i'm apologize i'm sorry for that now he says go lay down because i've gone i'm on service for the king sometimes that's what we got to do i'm sorry right i didn't mean to do it i'm not going to call you out i'm not going to call you down i'm not going to pin you down i love you i gotta keep moving maybe you can come with me you know it's sometimes so simple we don't have to get up and all in arms we just have to love somebody sometimes you know restore them back amen amen let it burn up that sickness that pain that besetting sin you've got in your life amen let it keep burning and moving through you brother hebrews 3 says take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god you experience a living god he says what then there be an evil heart of unbelief that would take you away from that experience and not keep you moving forward but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sins what does he say absorb one another encourage one another that's why we have fellowship that's why we pick the people we spend time with it's because they're supposed to be people that can exhort us and encourage us and guess what exhortation is not always lovey-dovey is it sometimes you got to be a little bit what direct with somebody why because you're trying to keep them on the straight and narrow but it also says encourage don't just be an exhorter be an encourager as well and then don't always be sharp but be the one that brings what the bomb of gilead behind it to keep them going amen he says what don't get hardened through what the deceitfulness of sin the deceitfulness of unbelief amen growing grace with each other and pull each other along is what he's talking about he says for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end there's a beginning of our confidence in christ and that's when you first what accept him at his word and you you repent and you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for remission of sins and you receive the holy ghost that's the first thing but that has to go all the way to the end and what is that a resurrection or a rapture he says don't stop with the beginning he says but hold that and be steadfast and be confident in that thing and take it all the way to fruition don't just start but finish it out amen stick with it keep going keep going amen he says what don't get hardened don't get hard into the moving of god don't get hard into the word of god don't get hearted to the moving of the holy spirit listen church is supposed to be specific and personal we are not supposed to be up here preaching generic sermons to to to make you feel good we're here to encourage you we're here to correct you we're here to strengthen you we're here to break down barriers we're here to cast out demons we're here to bring healing all of those things but guess what personal hurts a lot of times doesn't it amen but if it's the spirit of god and you could recognize the spirit of god he says don't get hardened to it don't get hardened by unbelief amen what accept it and say lord that's for me i accept your word amen sin is deceitful why because it's trying to trick you and the greatest trick that satan has is getting you to believe you've gone far enough or you don't have to go all the way that here is enough you've done enough you're good enough and you can stay here and guess what that's a denominational attitude you just only have to go this far guess what we go all the way and until you're in a rapture you haven't gone all the way that's what we're looking for isn't it a resurrection and a rapture listen to what the prophet said remember he said we read that quote where he said halfway is the most miserable place to be because you're not where you ought to be and you're not where you should be and you don't believe one of them enough to just go with it so you're sitting there and you're straddling the fence and guess what it hurts to straddle the fence if you've ever straddled a fence it's not a place to be he says now the devil is not like some people think he's mean and everything but he's deceitful now catch us he says the devil makes you think that you're right in other words you don't need to change you don't need to grow you don't need to mature you don't need to move anyplace you can stay right where you're at he says that's the deceit of satan is that he makes you think you're okay right where you are he says but when you disagree with the word that shows that it isn't the spirit of god because the holy spirit wrote the bible what is it you've got to go all the way to your end the start of your confidence is faith in the word to step out and do what acts 2 38 says but it's got to go all the way to the reality the manifestation and that's the infilling of the holy spirit to the point where it's working in your life to change you not just make you say amen but it's working to change you amen keep your confidence in him and press towards the finish line that's what paul's been saying second john 1 7 says for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ has come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist now they said he didn't come back then but what do they say today he's not here anymore here's the thing they might acknowledge that he was in brother branham but how many will acknowledge he's here today amen starting with brother mark in the corner and going all the way back to brother weissel in the far corner he's here today in the flesh they say what they are antichrist if they say that christ is not here today why because he's in you and me we've got to know it we've got to believe it we've got to act like it but he is here today he is here today the same as he was then except for the corporal body that's right amen yes sir he says look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward that which we have wrought the things we've accomplished the things we've done the progress we've made he's saying what don't lose that because if you lose that you don't get to go all the way to the full reward he says hold on to what you've got but keep going because that's a partial reward you've got to go all the way to the full reward there's something waiting for you at the end that's greater than anything you've gotten so far so he says keep going keep going keep going when you've done something build on it when you've done something build on it and then keep building building building like we say line up online word upon word experience upon experience right keep moving forward with god why otherwise you're going to lose the full reward you know what the full reward is remember if you look in scriptures in revelation it says you know that that men will come forward in that day and what's going to be tried their works he says and if their works don't hold up they'll be destroyed but that man's soul won't be lost but the full reward is if you can keep what you've worked for and your soul what is it you work for what are the jewels in your crown the souls that you've brought to christ the things you've done that did what built up the kingdom of god that's the stuff that will stand what does the song say only what's dumb for christ will stand what is it that's what we want to build not with hay and stubble and these things but we want to build something that'll take the fire of the holy spirit and it'll come out and it'll be pure and it'll stand in the day of judgment amen amen will you stop with an experience or will you move on to a perfect and complete reality amen john points out that we work and we achieve things in christ that are good but he says look out that you don't lose what you have and it keeps you from going all the way to that full reward amen don't settle for a halfway victory that's what he's saying don't settle for knowing god spoke to you don't settle for knowing god called you out keep going to the full reward keep going until god hasn't just spoken to you but he's spoken through you till god just hasn't been expressed to you but he's been expressed in you amen that's the fullness that we're looking for amen don't leave him as the god of special meetings with special ministers amen don't leave him of a god of of church right how many times do we see in scripture that where they got where they needed to go not in a church service but in what the privacy of their own prayer closet where they got into a room with god and god alone and they said lord here i am don't know what to do don't know where to go don't know how to get what i need i know i have a need but lord i i need you to come right the service is here for great victories but guess what you got little victories you're going to need all through that week and that only comes with getting personal with god in your own way you need that quiet time and that's the hardest thing to get these days is quiet time isn't it amen you might only have an earnest right now keep going and then you've got a down payment but go all the way until you get the full payment go all the way till you get the full victory amen go until he's not just an experience but he's you're all in all right that's what we're looking for amen stick with it until you have the complete purchase that christ has already paid for brother bob says this and when you come forth to be prayed for if you want salvation if you want divine healing no matter what it is if you are a believer you're an heir of every promise i don't see any exceptions there if you're a believer a true believer you've been filled with the holy spirit you are an heir of every single promise amen so lay your faith upon the promise and march forward and tell satan give it back give it back it's mine don't let him bluff you stand right there on the line he'll give it back god said he would so he has to do it that's your authority that's right you're the heir of all things if you've never received the holy ghost as yet don't know nothing about it and something in your heart's telling you you want it you stay right there that's eternal life that's what you're heir to stay right there and look satan right in the face and say you are the robber you're the one i've come to you're the one i've come to possess what jesus christ died for me to have now hand it back and get out of my way he says then the first thing you know the holy spirit will pour upon you then something happens something will happen what is it god vindicated he keeps his word that's just exactly then see after you see the word is vindicated to you that you are saved you do have the holy ghost then what amen he says abraham had won the victory and here he come marching back he was going down with his faith laying on the word that he could bring it back what he had lost and here he come back with it marching the victor's march that's the same thing you can do if you don't have eternal life ask god confess your sins believe on the son of god accept the baptism of the holy ghost and say i got god i come for it i'm here to receive it then you come back the victor's march you got it amen just shining my the birds sing different and everybody you're in love with everybody then that old hatred malice strife is done gone love everybody oh you're just having a great time singing shouting praising god don't care what anybody says about you it's all right sure on the victor's march amen you know when you get the holy ghost because life changes life changes as we said before you don't even you may not even want to change it'll change you and people will know remember scripture said of the apostles that they knew that they had been with jesus you get the holy ghost people will know you've been with jesus that's for sure he says oh his word will become something new to you whenever you once get the baptism of the holy ghost oh my you say i can't see these things i don't believe in shouting i don't believe in speaking in tongues i don't believe in divine healing it just shows you've never got the victory that's right but one time you get the victory then you've got it he says then you have it yes sir then you can shout like i said satan has won if he convinced you you've gone far enough you want to know when you've gone far enough you go on a rapture you know when you've gone far enough when he has come and he's knocked on your door and he's tried to get you to do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and you turn him down so many times that he doesn't come to your door on that situation anymore when he doesn't come around that's when you know you've gone far enough amen but go until he doesn't even want to have a conversation with you go and tell he doesn't want to even talk to you about it much less throw a temptation your way go until he has disappeared from that area of your life completely amen amen amen that's when you know you've won the victories when he stops trying because what he is so completely thwarted so completely powerless in your life in that area that he doesn't even want to have a chat about it anymore he says he's got me he's got me and then what does he do he goes for an easier target doesn't he and then when he stops fighting you that's when you know amen but as long as you're as you're wondering and kind of wanting and not too sure keep pressing because you don't have it remember brother brown says when you get the victory you'll know it amen you'll walk different you'll talk different he says now he ascended on high and gave gifts back to men what was it swords he put swords in their hand the words see to conquer oh my he gave them swords what for the word to conquer what sickness sins superstitions evil to bring every living creature that wants to live to bring every one of them to the realization that because i live you live also do you want to live if you want to live he says then he's here to make you live if you don't want to live then it's not for you but if you want to live he says then he's here to bring you to the realization that because i live you live also it's a new kind of living isn't it if you've gotten it it's a new kind of living if you know what you are and you know what you are you know it's a different kind of life he's saying if you want to live that kind of life there's a man here that can do it for you he says we have the fight of faith let us complete our victory for our complete victory is positive it's sure it's got to be we have the first fruits of it often that's what you get in special means is the first fruits of it by saying you got to go until you have what the full harvest we have the evidence in our heart now because we've already got the first battle behind us we have been able to conquer through the faith of jesus christ we had a v-day how many had a v-day amen he's saying keep going that's one get another get another get another get another until you have the total victory first john 5 4 says for whatsoever is born of god over cometh the world this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith you've got to be born of god and when you're born of god it's what the holy spirit in you it's the very life and faith of jesus christ acting in you to give you the victory and overcome the world amen i've said it so many times over the last year i feel and that said you've got to receive the holy spirit you've got to receive god personally not just a message doctrine not just the idea of a prophet came to us but you need the person of the word in your life and that is the living holy spirit in your heart and soul amen and what is it you got to come on that altar and you say lord i'm dead i'm not just dying i'm dead i'm giving up i'm laying it all on the altar i'm putting it all aside so that you can take a hold of me and live through me because until you do that you're just holding them back amen you won't get closer to god by doctrines and truths pharisees and sadducees had it guess what you can go on denominations and find plenty of that stuff i can go on facebook and instagram find lots of memes and great little thoughts and ideas that's not what's going to do it you got to have god inside of you and that's the real new birth amen you've got to accept christ the word into your life brother brown says it this way he says you ain't ready to live till you get the holy ghost and then when you get the holy ghost then you're just fit to live you wasn't fit to live before that seed but now you're just fit to lift after you live after you got the holy ghost see just getting you ready see people say well i got to get ready to die my i'm getting ready to live amen the thing of it is get ready to live and live in christ victorious life over sin death hell i already have the victory he's my victory and i'm his evidence and i'm an evidence of his victory amen that's it how do you know you got it he says i got it why because i'm an evidence of victory because i know what i was and i know what i am i am what a pro token of his victory i'm the evidence of victory he says he gave it to me by his grace i feel it i know it i see it working in my life it changed me but according to this book here he said that i had eternal life and would not be able to come to the judgment but i passed from death unto life because he took my judgment for me and if he paid the price don't try and bring me to any judgment listen don't try and bring yourself to any judgment sometimes we're the hardest on ourselves i'm hard on myself when i trip up however small or however big i'm hard on myself he says don't bring me to the judgment i'm telling you today don't bring yourself to the judgment don't say i need to pay for this i need to pay for that he paid for you he paid the price so you didn't have to pay the price so don't bring yourself to the judgment lay yourself at calvary say lord i'm sorry help me not to do it again and move forward in total justification you never did it in the first place don't go to judgment go to grace at the cross amen glory he says what i've passed from death into life because he took my judgment for me and if he paid the price don't bring me to any judgment he done took it for me and i accepted it yes sir the prophet would tell us he'd say don't have a conversation with satan he knocks don't talk about it don't debate you know who had a debate eve and we're still paying for that debate we're still paying for that conversation today amen brother brown said turn him down and walk away you know who you need to have a conversation with god don't have a conversation with satan have a conversation with god amen he speaks through his word first and foremost amen have a conversation with god and see what he's saying about you and then satan doesn't have any time to get in a conversation with you if we're in such close fellowship with god satan can't even get an edge in there he can't even get a point and he can't get anything into our life because we're so tied into that thing amen what is it keep walking towards the promise amen keep your conversation with god and the things of god and the people of god brother brown put it this way he says and a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome now he's not saying until he completely overcomes he says until he personally is completely overcome what when i've laid everything down when jonathan collette is completely overcome when that is put aside and it's only christ living in me that's when he's got the victory and if we look in our lives so often that's a work of time i didn't have the victory over everything potentially i did but god's we're creatures of time and god works with us as creatures of time and so he'll work with us in aspects of our life and guess what he'll start with brother paul in a different place than he starts with me sometimes we'll look at somebody's life we'll say well how come they haven't got over that because they don't need to get over that to keep moving on it was it was a stronghold in your life it has a greater effect on you and god has to get that out of your life it's not a big deal to them remember paul says he says some can eat meats and this and that the other and someone can only eat you know the only vegetables and these different things he says the stronger ones the one that can eat those things and just keep moving on it has no effect it doesn't hinder them there's something we have hindrances and in my life that maybe would not hinder you and so god has to deal with them but you look at them and say well they're worldly or they're this they need no no it just doesn't affect them the way it affects you you've got weaknesses you've got you've got chinks in your arm remember brother branham said that that uh satan's always got one punch coming you got one area of weakness that we got to keep covered in in prayer on these different things we've got to remember that amen that he works with each one of us differently amen amen so what i've got to be overcome completely overcome and that's when we get the total victory so whether it's my finances whether it's my career whether it's my ministry whether it's my family my marriage whatever it might be he's got to get the victory he's got to completely overcome me so that he can have victory now through me he says who himself that's the biggest enemy you've got is yourself that's the reason we can't rise up in faith is because you've got intellectuality there your intellectual part says well this or that it's a reasoning he says we want to cast down reasonings the bible tells us that's what satan comes to you with his reasonings right don't have the conversation with reasonings the word has no rhyme or reason brother bram says i can't tell you how god heals i can't tell you how god delivers i can't tell you how he does it all i know is that he does it right and i believe he does it and i'll keep believing he does it and i'll keep moving moving forward with that solution amen so it is if you're healed keep walking and healing if you're delivered keep walking in freedom if you're restored flourish and grow i love what he was saying there he says if you're here it's because god wants you here so while you're here grow if he takes you away praise the lord but while you're here grow don't be stagnant where you are and then i learned that in bc where it seemed like nothing was happening yet i had to realize there was a purpose there in it and i grew in that situation three and a half years backside of the desert it felt like but yet i grew because god had a purpose and when you recognize the purpose you'll grow where you are no matter what's going on amen what is it use it as momentum use it as an impetus amen to keep moving into the word of god feed the seed otherwise it's going to wither remember you look at the parable of the sower the word fell on a lot of ground but only on good ground did it did it flourish and bring forth something amen some it started it started but then when what the heat came and the sun came or it got around the wrong people then it choked out that experience and then you got to be around the right kind of people you got to be around the right kind of atmosphere very familiar scripture matthew 12 43 says when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none when he's gone he goes looking for some place he says then he says i'll return into my house from once i came out and when he has come he finds it empty swept and garnished catch that the house was cleaned out the person was delivered amen the person got the victory the demon was evicted but then after a while he comes back and he found they just cleaned it up it says garnish they'd actually added some nice little decorations it was prepared for occupancy but there was nobody there he says then go with he so he comes in says there's nobody here then he says he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be unto this wicked generation i'm not trying to scare you i'm trying to tell you you've got room in your life now feel it feel it you got room you've been delivered you've been healed you've been whatever it is fill that space fill that void you've got to fill it with something and i'm saying fill it with the things of god fill it with the people of god fill it with the praise of god fill it with the music of god fill it with whatever it is that you can stuff in there so that when that thing comes back guess what answers the door the things of god the spirit of god the praise of god the worship of god the testimony of god the fellowship of god all these things he's saying fill that space because otherwise you're just making it even easier for them to come back and they're even more welcome the second time around amen amen but brahm says i believe that's the reason that people don't have the victory in their heart when they should have is because their thoughts are on other things let the meditation of my mind of my heart be acceptable unto thee o lord he says i believe if we'll think on him he will drive on to us i was reading it i had so many so many things here and i i really had to cut it down but brother brown was talking about mary and he says mary went and she had fellowship with somebody that had a similar belief and a similar experience right when the angel comes to her what does she do she goes and she spends time with elizabeth because why elizabeth had an angel too and she has a supernatural birth going on in her body as well and she went and she fed that experience she fed what had happened to her with somebody that could encourage her in that exact same thing that's what we need to do spend time with people that believe the same thing you do spend time with people that will encourage you along the path that you're walking on this morning amen amen i heard brother joe speak to many lives this weekend and a lot of you shared some things before and a lot of you have shared things after and many of you came up for prayer and that's between you him and god he doesn't tell me anything and that's why we have visiting ministers is so that it can be sovereign amen so that you don't have to worry about things you share coming back and these different things amen but when you uh whatever you felt to do whatever you felt to claim whatever you felt was given to you keep after it amen nobody's here talking about you badly there's a lot of victories and man when our sister jenna came up i thought the roof was going to come off this praise the lord you know that was a victory that was an amazing victory that was an out of the blue victory wasn't it sister jenna i don't think she came here thinking that was going to happen but it happened amen there are many things you know like i said i know what you guys have told me and it's wonderful but keep going on in it amen keep pressing the mark him and dwell on it what what's he saying here let the meditation of my mind of my heart be acceptable unto thee lord what do you want to do you want to feed that that event you want to feed it and move forward with it you want god to be pleased with where your mind's at in the days and weeks that come ahead amen brother brahms praying over the congregation here this is god hiding himself in simplicity he says they're seeking more life after hearing that the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests within them and that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost do you realize that's what's inside of you this morning creative power in your voice what are you going to create what are you going to create it's in you to create an atmosphere and what does an atmosphere bring results so create the right atmosphere talk about good things praise the lord testify surround yourself with fellowship dive into the pool when the water's stirring that's what they wanted to do get in the pool get in the pool and stay in the pool until you're fully and completely delivered amen he says the holy ghost is a creator he makes things comes to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes god in action so what are you speaking is it putting god in action or is it giving satan a door to come into your life speak god into action he says and lord i pray that you will send the holy ghost upon every one of them just now and deliver them lord in the power of the resurrection of christ the things that they're desiring in their heart now listen to this a better life the baptism of the spirit lord may it be so that this audience will be illuminated the hearts of the people will see the vision and be filled with the power of god amen god loves it when you'll ask him for his direction for his vision for his purpose and then you can see it and you can say lord i want that and you'll hold there until it manifests itself in your life amen amen we read a scripture a while ago and it says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him remember we read that quote where the prophet said that lifting up a standard was what pouring the holy spirit into your life what do we want we want a pouring out we want it till you're saturated until you're soaked isn't that what we want isn't that what we want is to be so saturated they they they there's that song that says saturate us with your presence devastate us devastate us with your glory what me jonathan corlett the carnality amen let it so soak in there that that's all that people see that so that when they squeeze me what do they get holy spirit response right not anger not temper not frustration but what holy ghost response each and every time so when i squeeze out it brings a refreshing to them not a rebuke amen god help us amen what is it we want to be so in tune with god that satan has no way to squeak in because we recognize him each and every time he's coming at us and he's going to come at us he's going to maybe he's already come at you amen recognize it and say we're not having this conversation i'm going to go spend some time with god i'm going to go spend some time with the people of god and i'm going to make sure that you don't have any time to get into my life amen amen if you're a true child of god once that life starts there's no coming back amen you can't do it you can't be lost there is an eternal salvation and when you get the holy ghost that's eternal because it can't die you've got a part of god in you and it seals your soul all the way to eternity brother brown says what god when god comes into a person or to persons into a congregation into a man or woman he vindicates his presence and god proves that he's there for when god comes supernatural signs begin to appear what is that supernatural sign he says this person becomes a changed person they're not no more like they used to be sin has vanished from their life fear and doubt has vanished frustration they are solid and stable live or die it's christ they don't care what comes or what goes nothing shakes them they move forward brothers i might need some more water here i said i want i've read the scripture before and i want to remind you of this word principle to keep fighting to keep striking while the iron's hot that's what you do when the iron's hot when the iron's hot it's malleable that's why they heat it up is because you can bend iron when it's when it's when it's when it's heated up to a high temperature once it's once it cools down it solidifies and you can't do anything with it right it's in second kings 13 it says now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness wherever he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof the prophet to them was the horseman and the chariot they knew if they had the prophet there and they were in god's will that nothing was going to overcome israel he was literally the protection of israel that's why he calls him that they weren't allowed to have horses and chariots in israel did you know that they were forbidden to have it because it was what something that they put their carnal strength into and they'd start believing we're winning because we have chariots and horses he called elisha the chariot and the horsemen of israel and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then elisha said shoot and he shot this guy's very obedient to the prophet you notice and he said the arrow of the lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians in affect until thou shalt thou have consumed them there's a prophecy going forth says you're going to beat them consume them that means you'll destroy them utterly and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed in other words he he struck the arrows three times into the ground and then he stopped and the man of god was wrath with him and said thou should have smitten five or six times then thou had smitten syria until thou had consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice good thing i don't have a lisp he says you should have kept going he says you stopped at three why did you stop at three you shouldn't have stopped you should have went five or six he says then you should have consumed him he's already prophesied they'll consume them and then the man doesn't strike enough and he says because of it you won't consume them the prophecy was given you had the promise but he says you didn't go far enough you didn't strike and strike and strike until you knew without a shadow of a doubt that they would be completely obliterated and he was mad at him and this was a good king he says you didn't go far enough he said what these arrows represent deliverance so strike and you'll get as much deliverance as you strike what you say will happen make sure you do enough amen and he says what are you doing three three three battles isn't going to destroy these kings three battles isn't going to do enough they've got enough of an army they've got enough of a population that they'll come back after three i sometimes wonder why joash only struck three times maybe he said you know what i don't want to be battling all the time even if we're winning it's a hard time maybe i don't want to do that i'm just going to go for three that'll keep them off my back as long as i'm alive and then somebody else can take it maybe i don't know but whatever it was did not rise up in him and say yeah let's get the job done he was satisfied to go most of the way amen what is it you're not supposed to keep satan at bay you're supposed to destroy his works right now keep him at bay not hold him up but you're supposed to destroy his works first john 3 says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteousness is righteous what is righteousness it's the will of god so he that does the will of god is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so that's our job now right christ destroyed the works of of the devil and that he got the keys to death and hell in the grave and he rose and he proved to us that he's alive and well but now he's in us to continue that work and it is to destroy not the devil because he's not destroyed till after the white throne judgment right then he's cast in and then he's finished completely but in the meantime we've got to destroy the works of the devil we've got to destroy the effects of the devil we've got to pull people back from the brink we've got to pull situations out of his hand and put him into the word of god we've got to destroy the effect of him in our life amen and you say how do i destroy the works of the devil what is it that's going to get satan out of my life what is it that's going to put satan on his heels what is it that's going to give me the victory over him should i ask for answers it's simple we heard it manifest christ remember listen the way brother brandon puts it he says oh my how we need thousands of lived voices lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler don't stop hollering but that's not what gets him running the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout don't stop jumping don't stop shouting that's part of worship but he says but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god listen to what this looks like in action say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil a holy sanctified life that doesn't react satan hates it when he can't get you to react to circumstances when you aren't looking at the circumstances but you're looking at the god of all circumstances did you know that you can't have anything come into your life except he allows it amen you can't have sickness unless he allows it you can't have loss of finances you can't have pain you can't have suffering none of these things can come to you that satan will put on you unless god gives him permission to do it in the first place amen so you know that if it's coming it's because god allowed it and all he's trying to do is get you to do what manifest christ in the situation how many times did we hear that over the weekend amen what is he looking for he's saying we want god to what put a choke hold on our carnality and let the holy spirit come through in each and every situation amen was he saying you can turn the cheek when somebody slaps you when somebody calls your name when somebody rips on your reputation when somebody dismisses you whatever it might be right when you'll keep fellowshipping when it doesn't when you don't feel like fellowshipping whatever it might be what is it satan's just trying to get you to react the holy spirit doesn't react that way right it's able to be calm he's able to sit back and say what's really going on here and react that way amen first corinthians 15 says but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain i want you to encourage you this morning to be steadfast right don't move from the promise of god don't move from the word of god don't move from the unction of the holy spirit healing sometimes hurts do you know that you ever been hurt bad guess what sometimes the healing works more hurts more than the injury because it's dragged out over time you ever try and pull a sliver out if it's got some little edges on there it it hurts doesn't it sometimes we'd rather leave the sliver in there but then what happens is it worms its way into your flesh and then it hurts even more to get it out later but it hurts i uh i was i was uh repairing the the do not trespass private property sign on the property that's not mine below me and when i was doing it it was a very windy cold day and my fingers were really numb and i was i was i was trying to put the screws in to repair the sign and as i went in the they're pretty long screws and the the drill tipped out of the way and it drove the head right into my thumb it went right in here and i had this this basically cross-shaped gouge right into it went deep and i bled like a stuck pig i mean it was bleeding bleeding bleeding and so i went home and i put a band-aid on it and guess what it bled for two days and so finally i said you know what covering it up is not what's going to bring the healing so i opened it up and i let the fresh air come around it and what happened was within just an hour it dried up and sealed itself what sometimes we think we got to cover it to let it heal sometimes we got to get out in the open but you know what happened it still hurts today so it's slowly closed up you know when you had you know little puss and infection and stuff in theirs it's healing and guess what it was tender to the touch for quite a while and even today this is probably a month and a half later if i press on that it hurts because it's not fully healed it looks healed but if i press on it i can still feel that scar tissue in there that's a little bit tender today but if i'd have left it it just festered over time wouldn't it the healing hurts and i've got a mark from healing there but it is healed today but it may never be the same again i don't know but it's healed today and i can use that thumb in a way that i couldn't do it before sometimes the healing hurts sometimes change hurts is what i'm saying sometimes taking that step it hurts and we've got to be willing to go through that amen so that we can get the benefit of all of that but paul's saying here he's saying abound in the work of the lord abound in it not just you know a little bit of this and a little bit of that but he says abound in it let it be a big thing the amplified puts it this way he says therefore my beloved brethren be firm steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the lord always being superior excelling doing more doing more than enough in the service of the lord give it everything don't just give it enough remember paul exhorted the servants he says don't if you're a slave don't try not to be a slave he says but work is unto the lord do it as unto the lord don't do it as unto men don't do it for the favor of men but do it as unto god and that's where the reward is right so he says here be superior excelling doing more than enough in the service of the lord why knowing and being continually aware that your labor in the lord is not futile in other words it is never wasted or to no purpose god never brings something into your life for no purpose amen amen so he doesn't waste your tears he doesn't waste your trials he doesn't waste your pain he doesn't waste your hurt he doesn't waste your your failures or your fault none of these things god uses all of those things to what to help you abound in the work of god amen we heard it this past week romans 8 28 and that's that all things work together for the good of them who are the called not just called but thee called the specific ones that he was looking for those are the ones that all things work together for good in their lives amen i thought it was beautiful what brother joe said in that last service lord i want to know your will manifest christ lord what do i do in this situation manifest christ lord what do i do manifest christ what about this what do i do manifest christ and he'll bring everything that you need your way amen i think sometimes we're we're so influenced by a prophetic ministry that we think we have to know what's coming we don't we don't know what's going we know what's coming a resurrection and a rapture amen everything else between that's up to him whether he gives it whether he doesn't amen how many times have we sought god and i thought just that answer manifest christ would be the answer to every single situation so often we do need specifics i'm not saying you don't look for that but manifest christ in whatever you're going to do amen every single part of it if you're focused on that i believe everything else you need will be added to you as we start to close he says man or a woman that takes god's word you got a hold of something your anchor holds within the veil the storms and gales may press and shake in every way but you're anchored she's coming right up onto the place you're persevering you're going to believe it noah believed it sure and he achieved god's purpose for his life do you want to achieve god's purpose in your life he says then be perseverant when you get the word hold on to it the promise it's yours he says abraham don't have to wander no more across the city seeking a country across the country seeking a city the sinner don't have to wonder anymore whether he can be saved or not the sick man doesn't have to wonder whether he can be healed or not the opening veil on that day at calvary revealed the way to the total victory what was it restored fellowship there was a remedy there was a covering there was a price paid that signified all of those things he said god gives us the powers of his spirit to live triumphantly over all these things he asks us only to believe it that happened on that day at calvary there never was a day like it there never will be one like it it's not necessary no more the price is paid and we are redeemed thanks be to god we are redeemed you're redeemed this morning may not look like it but you're redeemed he says there's no more you have to wonder about there's no more guessing about it it's all took away the veil pulled back the curtain and we're set on a highway not to wonder anymore but to believe and just walk right on we walk right in to god's very presence amen god bless you if you'd stand this morning amen i want to encourage you again keep pressing on amen keep acting on the word of god keep feeding and watering your experience with god amen be an expectation i love what he talked about i heard the story of you know that that that sister coming up and she was praying for her brother to get saved in 15 minutes he ran into his pajamas what you didn't know was that he thought the rapture had happened and he ran in there to see if they were still there and when they were there he was so relieved that he gave his heart to god amen amen sometimes it's just going to happen there will be no warning i remember when i got saved there was no warning my mom was there many others were there and they were praying and praying and praying and i had not made a move all weekend this was down louisiana camp i was 17 years old brother donny reagan brother berry coffee there and there they they had been running a prayer line for probably an hour and a half two hours and i hadn't moved a lick i was just sitting there sitting there sitting there then all of a sudden i got up and that was it and it was done and it was a finished work from that moment forward and that's all we need sometimes is to just wait for the one moment without a warning right we have no idea what's coming and then god just steps in and in a sovereign work he says now is the time now's the day now it's the moment of deliverance of healing a provision whatever it is and all we've got to do is hold on for that one moment where god says now is my time not what you want but what i've won and what i've ordained and when he ordains it it's got to come to pass amen when we can wait for his timing he does all things he says he makes all things beautiful in his time amen can we trust that this morning let's bow our heads if we would lord god lord how wonderful you are to us lord lord that you would encourage us lord that you would lift up our faith that you'd help us to step out on the promise of your word lord that under the unction and the discernment of the holy spirit lord that we would welcome you anew into our lives in a new and greater way but lord we don't want to stop with a moment we don't want to stop with an experience but lord we want you to just saturate our lives heavenly father with your word with your holy spirit lord that you would give us a lord a new heart a clean heart lord that you would repair the brokenness
