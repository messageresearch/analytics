[44:25] the scripture we focused on last service
[44:26] Lord willing will finish it this evening
[44:28] and Paul's speaking of Christ says from
[44:31] whom the whole body fitly joined
[44:33] together and compacted by that which
[44:35] every joint supplieth according to the
[44:38] effectual working and the measure of
[44:39] every part maketh increase of the body
[44:42] unto the edifying of itself in love amen
[44:46] God bless you you can have your seats
[44:47] this evening we're continuing on with
[44:49] our series of manifesting time and we're
[44:51] taking a second title a second series
[44:54] service on finding your position in this
[44:57] thought of adoption and finding our
[44:58] foreordained position and I want to take
[45:01] that scripture we open with and go back
[45:03] to the Amplified because it's a little
[45:05] easier I'm getting a bit of echo up here
[45:06] brother Matt if you can adjust that a
[45:08] bit amen Ephesians 4:16 from the
[45:10] Amplified says from him the whole body
[45:13] the church in all of its various parts
[45:16] joined and knitted firmly together by
[45:18] what every joint supplies when each part
[45:21] is working properly causes the body to
[45:24] grow and mature building itself up in
[45:27] love and we spent pretty much the last
[45:29] half of last service on that part that
[45:31] talks about being joined and fitted
[45:33] firmly together by what every joint
[45:36] supplies amen we aren't all the same we
[45:38] don't all provide the same thing we
[45:39] don't all have the same position and if
[45:41] we did then we'd be a freak body and I
[45:44] believe one thing is that the bride is
[45:45] not a freak body amen it is a perfectly
[45:48] formed and fitted body and every bits
[45:50] there that's supposed to be there and
[45:51] there's no extra and there's no there's
[45:53] no ones missing out that are supposed to
[45:55] be there amen and when we look at these
[45:57] things then we ought to be able to Value
[45:58] one another in those differences and and
[46:00] that you do one thing and I do something
[46:02] different and that doesn't make you
[46:04] better and me worse or me better and you
[46:06] worse but it just makes us different and
[46:08] God has made us that way and we
[46:09] appreciate it we accept it and we use
[46:11] each other in those things you know it's
[46:13] one thing to say well I accept you
[46:14] brother I accept you sister but will we
[46:16] use you will we trust you in that role
[46:18] amen that's how when we know when we've
[46:20] really been bonded and joined and
[46:21] knitted together is when we'll allow
[46:23] each other to do those things where
[46:25] we'll step aside and let somebody else
[46:26] do a job job amen and do a part in the
[46:28] body of Christ maybe that we would want
[46:30] to do ourselves but we know Satan is
[46:32] always trying to attack us amen he's
[46:34] always trying to get us out of position
[46:36] and he does it with two ways and we'll
[46:37] cover this a bit more in detail at the
[46:39] end but brother Brandon would talk about
[46:41] and he says first thing he'll do is
[46:42] he'll get us caught up in Pride amen and
[46:44] we see that throughout the scriptures
[46:45] time and time again he makes us think
[46:47] more of ourselves than we ought to or he
[46:49] makes us think more of ourselves in the
[46:51] gift than we ought to if we could put it
[46:53] that way amen and then when he when we
[46:55] get lifted up in Pride automatically
[46:56] what happens is we have to put somebody
[46:58] else down amen and God won't stand for
[47:00] that amen God doesn't we can sit here
[47:02] and we can say this one's more important
[47:04] than that one let me tell you you chop
[47:06] one little piece out of your body and
[47:07] see if it's
[47:09] important one little piece you take it
[47:11] out you take out that one little vein
[47:13] that one little blood vessel that one
[47:15] little organ that one little thing that
[47:17] you think has no effect you take it out
[47:19] and you watch what happens to the body
[47:21] it has an effect amen and when one
[47:23] part's missing the whole body suffers
[47:25] amen so we can't do that
[47:27] we we can't just build ourselves up and
[47:31] me I I ran across a funny quote and it
[47:34] was funny to me and it's a one it's one
[47:37] line brother BR said this he says
[47:39] there's too much wind and thunder and
[47:41] not enough still small voices amen that
[47:45] I I talk about that like that's the me
[47:47] monster me me me me me I I I I I amen
[47:51] that's what you see there all big things
[47:53] everything I do is great everything I do
[47:55] is worthy of Note Everything is we
[47:57] talking about that's not the son of Da
[47:59] that's not the son that's not the
[48:00] daughter of God that's talking that way
[48:02] but then we go to the other side of the
[48:03] coin and that's Satan trying to
[48:05] discourage us and he's trying to get us
[48:06] to think well I'm just little old me
[48:08] what do I have what do I bring to the
[48:10] table and then it's that comparative uh
[48:12] Christianity that we've talked about so
[48:14] many times that we start looking at
[48:16] others that are in similar positions or
[48:17] have similar gifts and and we say well
[48:20] I'm no good compared to them and
[48:21] therefore I'm just not going to do it at
[48:22] all and that's comparative Christianity
[48:24] and God doesn't have any part in that
[48:26] and ought not to have any part of that
[48:28] amen you look in the scriptures and
[48:30] almost every hero almost everyone that
[48:32] was used of God was just like you and I
[48:35] and by that I mean nothing special amen
[48:38] just people walking through life being
[48:41] faithful being humble living a simple
[48:44] overcoming life and then God comes down
[48:47] and he uses them in a special way it's
[48:49] not this some buildup of some big thing
[48:51] where we make ourselves into something
[48:53] by any means but it's just God coming
[48:55] down to vessels that will Sur surrender
[48:57] to him and he uses them and he does
[48:59] great things through them amen you know
[49:01] God chose us God elected us God ordained
[49:04] us what we need to do is start thinking
[49:06] his thoughts about us and see what he
[49:08] sees in US rather than what Satan starts
[49:09] to do amen all we've got to do is take
[49:12] what we've got and use it for his glory
[49:14] that's all he asks us to do all he does
[49:16] is he says be faithful in what you've
[49:18] got and I'll bless it and as soon as we
[49:20] can do that as soon as we can say Lord I
[49:22] don't have much remember that little boy
[49:25] that brought the two loaves in the the
[49:27] and and the this the five
[49:29] fishes that was nothing compared to the
[49:32] need but all he brought was what he had
[49:35] and he says I'll give what I have and
[49:37] God multiplied it God took it and he
[49:39] expanded it and he grew it and he fed
[49:41] 5,000 with what one little lad brought
[49:43] to that little special set of
[49:45] meetings young people don't think for a
[49:48] second you can't change the course of a
[49:49] meeting you can't change the course of a
[49:51] church you can't change the course of a
[49:52] body you bring what you have and you
[49:54] give it to God you bring your little bit
[49:55] of worship you bring your little bit of
[49:57] praise you bring your little lick of
[49:59] fire and you watch what God will do it
[50:01] only takes one to get lit that's all it
[50:03] takes is one person to come in humility
[50:05] somebody to come with a need somebody to
[50:07] come with desperation somebody to come
[50:09] with worship whatever it is they bring
[50:12] that one little thing and it can change
[50:13] the entire course of a service it can
[50:15] change the entire course of your own
[50:16] week or somebody else's even amen if
[50:19] we'll just give those things to God Amen
[50:21] we're individually gifted but we're
[50:23] placed and we're working together we
[50:25] read that quote where brother BR says
[50:26] we've got to we're placed to work
[50:28] together we've got to be able to do
[50:30] those things but I want to reach down
[50:31] into the the last two parts of of
[50:34] Ephesians 4:16 and and after it says
[50:36] we're joined and knitted firmly together
[50:38] by what every joint supplies he says
[50:40] when each part is working properly when
[50:43] each part is working properly that's
[50:45] when we're going to start making some
[50:47] progresses not when we're just in
[50:48] position but when we're working properly
[50:51] in those positions amen it's when we
[50:53] recognize our position and we're working
[50:55] correctly in that position cuz if we're
[50:57] not the body can't function and the body
[50:59] can't grow and if we're in position but
[51:01] not working properly then the body's not
[51:03] going to have any use out of us either
[51:05] you think about it you know I think of
[51:06] brother Nelson guy Jr sitting at home
[51:08] there and and he's had surgery on his
[51:10] knee now he had knees that worked but
[51:13] not worked great and now he's got a
[51:14] replacement in there but what does he
[51:16] have to do now he's got to take it and
[51:18] he's got to train it so that it will
[51:20] work properly because without it working
[51:23] properly he might have a knee but it's
[51:24] no good amen and we might have people in
[51:27] this congregation that are built that
[51:28] are ordained for something but until
[51:30] they're working properly they can't be
[51:32] any use they can't be they've got to
[51:34] know what they are and they've got to be
[51:36] uh set up for this and he says when each
[51:39] part is working properly there's a time
[51:41] element to this it's not that just
[51:42] because you're a knee you automatically
[51:44] work as a knee you got to grow you've
[51:45] got to be fitted in if you're a song
[51:47] leader you've got to be worked into that
[51:49] if you're a worshipper a musician a
[51:50] preacher a teacher a one of the helps
[51:53] whatever it might be we've got to be
[51:55] placed in position and then we've got to
[51:56] be brought to working properly so it
[51:59] means there's a time element to this
[52:00] amen and that's the question is will we
[52:03] come into position and learn how to
[52:05] operate properly will we straighten up
[52:07] will we let go of the things that would
[52:09] hold us back amen we've got to know our
[52:11] position and our role but we've got to
[52:12] know how to function inside of that as
[52:15] well you know I'm called to be a
[52:16] preacher I believe but if I focus on
[52:18] song leading I'll never be a great
[52:20] preacher and by that I mean an effective
[52:22] preacher not a great preacher an
[52:24] effective preacher because what I'm not
[52:25] learning how to to operate properly
[52:27] within the lane that I'm called to be in
[52:29] amen we've got to know and that's the
[52:31] first step where we're where we're
[52:32] supposed to be but the second step is to
[52:34] work properly amen we've got to be
[52:37] prepared for that position we've got to
[52:39] be taught we've got to be tested we've
[52:41] got to be trained amen because it's the
[52:42] preparation of the holy spirit that
[52:44] makes us effective and we know that God
[52:47] has placed us when he puts us in that
[52:48] role you say I don't know if I'm
[52:50] supposed to be where I'm supposed to be
[52:52] wherever you are God has called you to
[52:53] be there work in where you're at right
[52:55] now and if he's got more for you he'll
[52:57] bring you into that but in the in the
[52:59] meantime work and be faithful amen we
[53:01] can't force ourselves to be something we
[53:04] can't force ourselves the scripture says
[53:06] can any man by taking thought grow a
[53:08] cubit can he grow a foot and a half none
[53:10] of us can do it can any of us become
[53:11] anything greater in the kingdom of God
[53:13] by forcing it no we can't do it but we
[53:15] can stay faithful where we're at and God
[53:17] can do a work in our life amen even if
[53:19] we know what is our calling if we if we
[53:21] know what God intends for us if we got a
[53:23] revelation of those things then then
[53:25] we've got to wait on God's timing in
[53:27] God's preparation amen David and Moses
[53:29] are two great examples of men that tried
[53:31] to force and didn't force and the
[53:33] trouble that came out of it and the
[53:34] blessing that came out of it as the case
[53:36] may be because here's the thing Satan is
[53:38] always looking to try and get us to
[53:40] force the issue amen sons of God
[53:42] Daughters of God they know how to wait
[53:44] they know how to seek the will of God
[53:46] they know how to rest even when
[53:48] circumstances see Satan is the master of
[53:51] circumstances and faith is the master of
[53:54] circumstances anden Satan brings up up
[53:56] circumstan and he tries to force our
[53:58] hand he tries to get us into making a
[54:00] decision that we can control and we have
[54:03] to be able to sit there and say Lord
[54:05] what would you have your servant to do
[54:07] and wait on him and don't get pushed
[54:09] don't get forced amen it can wait it can
[54:12] wait we have to wait on God Amen but
[54:15] what is it that makes us work properly
[54:17] you say we're talking about when we can
[54:19] get to the place where every one of us
[54:21] is working properly then we're going to
[54:23] start coming into a rapturing condition
[54:25] then we're going to coming in com into
[54:26] the full power of God in the bride but
[54:28] what is it that makes us work properly
[54:30] we go back to 1 Corinthians 12 and I
[54:32] know we spent a lot of time on this but
[54:34] there's a key message here he says now
[54:36] there are diversities of gifts but the
[54:38] Same Spirit there are differences of
[54:41] administrations but the same Lord there
[54:43] are diversities of operations but it is
[54:45] the same God which worketh all and all
[54:47] it's the same Spirit Lord and God
[54:49] remember he says these three are one
[54:51] amen it's so same thing in all of them
[54:53] he says but the manifestation of the
[54:56] spirit is given to every man to profit
[54:58] with all in other words he says the
[55:00] expression the manifestation of the
[55:02] spirit what is that it's the word in
[55:04] flesh so in other words when the word
[55:06] becomes flesh it's given to every person
[55:09] to bring profit not to themselves to the
[55:12] body he says for to one is given by the
[55:16] spirit the word of wisdom to another the
[55:18] word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to
[55:21] another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[55:24] another the gifts of healing by the Same
[55:26] Spirit are you catching what he's saying
[55:28] amen he says to another the working of
[55:30] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[55:33] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[55:35] kinds of tongues to another the
[55:36] interpretation of s tongues he says but
[55:39] all these worketh that one and the
[55:42] selfsame spirit dividing to every man
[55:45] severly as he will notice he says all
[55:48] these worketh that one in the selfsame
[55:50] spirit in other words it's the holy
[55:52] spirit that works and operates those
[55:55] gifts amen you are a gift to the body of
[55:58] Christ you are a part in the body of
[55:59] Christ but it's the holy spirit all
[56:02] through there all we see is that same
[56:03] spirit that same spirit that same spirit
[56:06] that same Spirit what makes it operate
[56:08] Church it is the holy spirit that's what
[56:11] makes us work properly
[56:13] amen the Common Thread is the anointing
[56:17] of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives not on
[56:19] US in US amen we're going to get into
[56:23] the difference between those two things
[56:24] a little bit later amen but it has to be
[56:27] the same Spirit working in you as is
[56:29] working in me as is working in you as is
[56:31] working in you each and every one of us
[56:33] has to have that same thing flowing
[56:35] through us it's the common thread of the
[56:37] body of Christ because you can come to
[56:39] this church and say I believe this
[56:40] message and attend faithfully and pay
[56:42] your tithes and do all these things but
[56:44] in the end if you don't have the Holy
[56:46] Spirit you won't fit in
[56:48] here it won't worken we've got Collins
[56:52] and cetes and columbos and coffees here
[56:55] and we fit here not because we get along
[56:57] we fit here because we've all got the
[56:59] holy ghost that is what draws draws us
[57:02] each one together amen and I'm not
[57:03] saying that people that have left don't
[57:05] have the Holy Spirit by no means we are
[57:07] each are called to a sovereign local
[57:09] body I believe that and we have one but
[57:11] if you're going to stay here you got to
[57:14] have the Holy Ghost because that's the
[57:16] only thing that ties us together I mean
[57:17] we may sit here and we may look at each
[57:19] other and say Well we'd be friends if we
[57:21] were out in the world I'm here to tell
[57:22] you we would not be we are so different
[57:24] across this church that's what makes us
[57:27] Strong by the Holy Spirit but that would
[57:29] divide us and we if we were out in the
[57:31] world we think that we would be great
[57:33] friends but we are great friends because
[57:35] we are part of the same body and it's
[57:37] the Holy Ghost that's the great unifying
[57:39] Factor amongst us otherwise I wouldn't
[57:40] have anything to do with brother
[57:43] Paul no I would I would but we have some
[57:48] very different personalities in here let
[57:50] me put it this way we don't even get
[57:52] along with our own family that's not got
[57:54] the Holy Ghost amen now can we be honest
[57:57] not saying we don't love them but we
[57:59] don't have time to spend around them
[58:00] because they we don't see eye to eye
[58:02] there's no unifying Factor blood is
[58:04] thicker than water guess what the Holy
[58:06] Ghost is way thicker than all of that
[58:08] amen but if the you know if your
[58:10] family's got the Holy Ghost then that's
[58:11] a special thing but if they don't have
[58:13] the Holy Ghost guess what we can't
[58:15] really spend that much time around them
[58:17] we don't want to be in their homes we
[58:18] don't want to be spending time with
[58:20] their kids and these different things
[58:21] why because there's no
[58:24] connection we happen to be related but
[58:27] the thing that that makes me get along
[58:28] with you and you get along with me is
[58:30] you got the Holy Ghost and I got the
[58:31] Holy Ghost and that's why we can have
[58:33] brother Dale come all the way from
[58:34] Alberta and he fits right in as if he's
[58:36] always been here why he's got the Holy
[58:38] Ghost amen that's what makes the
[58:41] difference in all of these things amen
[58:43] otherwise what happens is Satan will
[58:45] take the differences and he'll magnify
[58:47] them and we have a church split and we
[58:49] have another church split and we have
[58:50] another church split and we have another
[58:51] church split till we got three people
[58:53] each and five people that ought not to
[58:55] be Ministry that's the way it works
[58:58] Satan magnifies the difference the holy
[59:00] ghost covers it with Grace and love and
[59:02] draws us together on the portion of
[59:03] Christ that's in each and every one of
[59:05] us
[59:06] amen without the Holy Spirit it doesn't
[59:09] matter what your calling is it doesn't
[59:10] matter what your purpose is doesn't
[59:11] matter what your gifts are your
[59:13] intelligence or any of those things
[59:14] because it'll just be you operating the
[59:16] gift and that always leads to
[59:18] destruction because in the end what
[59:20] happens is we start to turn towards
[59:21] self- serving rather than serving others
[59:24] and it becomes selfish rather than
[59:26] edifying and we know what that ends up
[59:28] in every time amen it's just me
[59:30] operating the gift it's just you
[59:31] operating the gift and it doesn't get us
[59:33] anywhere brother Braham says this he
[59:35] says instead of trying to be great we
[59:37] ought to be trying to find out how
[59:38] little we can get see he says then God
[59:41] can use us then and only then if I could
[59:43] put it that way I hope I'm not adding to
[59:45] the word this evening he says notice
[59:47] that it takes the weakest and the
[59:49] rejected and practically every hero God
[59:52] ever had on the front line was that type
[59:54] of person a person that that was
[59:56] rejected a person that thought he was
[59:59] insufficient thought he wasn't
[1:00:02] insufficient he thought he was
[1:00:04] insufficient a person that had no
[1:00:06] ability at all then that person's just
[1:00:08] in good shape so God can start using
[1:00:10] them he says that's right it's when they
[1:00:13] feel like they can't they haven't got
[1:00:16] nothing that's when God can take a hold
[1:00:18] of them and do something with them he
[1:00:20] says but when we're thinking that we are
[1:00:22] able to do it then God can't use us
[1:00:24] because we're wanting to do it ourselves
[1:00:27] see we can't have a false humility God
[1:00:29] sees right through that God sees right
[1:00:31] through that to the heart amen God has
[1:00:33] to see us in real humility where we know
[1:00:36] that we can't do it on our own you know
[1:00:38] how we usually figure that out we try it
[1:00:40] on our own amen we try it on our own and
[1:00:43] it doesn't work out it doesn't last the
[1:00:45] fruit of it is not what we expected and
[1:00:47] we say Okay that wasn't a good idea Lord
[1:00:50] maybe you could do it next time and all
[1:00:52] of a sudden we let go and we let God
[1:00:53] have his wonderful way and beautiful
[1:00:55] things come out otherwise we get sucked
[1:00:57] into what I love to call delusions of
[1:00:59] Competency and it gets us nowhere it
[1:01:01] gets us nowhere and God's got to use us
[1:01:05] but then we've got the other side
[1:01:06] remember we talked about pride and then
[1:01:08] discouragement and here's the other side
[1:01:10] he says and then the other side we get
[1:01:12] these
[1:01:13] feelings feelings not realities feelings
[1:01:18] Satan loves to work on our emotions
[1:01:19] doesn't he he loves to make us feel
[1:01:22] things he Lov to make us think things
[1:01:24] but we've got to know by Faith by the
[1:01:25] word he says then the other side we get
[1:01:27] these feelings and we think then that
[1:01:29] we're insufficient and we don't want to
[1:01:31] do it but then if we just what's the
[1:01:34] antidote church then if we just listen
[1:01:37] to the call of God that's the very thing
[1:01:40] that God wants us to get into that kind
[1:01:42] of a shape so he can when we're
[1:01:44] insufficient ourselves then we are
[1:01:47] subjects to yield to God's spirit see if
[1:01:49] I don't think I can do it then it's got
[1:01:51] to be God that's doing it in the first
[1:01:53] place he says as long as we think that
[1:01:56] we can do it then we can't do it but
[1:01:59] when we get to a place where we know we
[1:02:01] can't do it then we yield ourselves to
[1:02:04] God and he does it he says so then if us
[1:02:07] if it's us trying to do it we'll
[1:02:10] fail he says but if we'll just yield
[1:02:13] ourselves to God then God can't fail
[1:02:16] amen there's only one thing God cannot
[1:02:18] do and that's fail he can do anything
[1:02:21] else but fail he cannot fail so as long
[1:02:23] as we are trying in ourselves and
[1:02:25] depending on our own abilities and so
[1:02:27] forth well we'll do nothing he says but
[1:02:30] when we get to a place where we know
[1:02:32] we're nothing then God can use
[1:02:34] us now catch this he says the important
[1:02:37] thing one of the important things that
[1:02:39] you must Master he says now remember
[1:02:41] this and especially you young preachers
[1:02:43] and lay members
[1:02:45] alike he says there's one thing that
[1:02:47] we've got to master if we expect to
[1:02:49] fulfill God's desire in our life and
[1:02:51] that is we have to master the thought of
[1:02:55] human AB
[1:02:56] ability he says if we ever get to a spot
[1:02:59] where we think we can do it with our own
[1:03:01] intelligence and our own abilities we
[1:03:03] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:03:05] can get rid of the thing and lay it
[1:03:07] aside so that God can use us that's
[1:03:09] righten that's the greatest battle we've
[1:03:11] got a fight is to lay ourselves aside to
[1:03:13] lay ourselves down to lay our abilities
[1:03:15] our will our thoughts our opinions all
[1:03:17] of these different things he says and
[1:03:19] when you do that make a complete
[1:03:22] surrender
[1:03:24] we I cannot use one
[1:03:28] ability he says we've got to make a
[1:03:30] complete surrender and to come to God
[1:03:33] you've got to surrender to him both soul
[1:03:36] body and spirit am mean it's got to be
[1:03:39] all him or it's none of him amen it's
[1:03:42] got to be a full surrender everything
[1:03:44] that you are has to be surrendered to
[1:03:46] God in order that he can work his will
[1:03:49] in you and me see here's the thing skill
[1:03:51] is not what makes the difference in The
[1:03:53] Believer amen skill is not what won
[1:03:56] David over Goliath Goliath came and he
[1:03:58] had skill and what did David had David
[1:04:01] had faith in his calling and a Shepherd
[1:04:03] sling and guess who went down
[1:04:06] skill amen Jericho's walls had never
[1:04:09] been breached and a bunch of immigrants
[1:04:12] came in with trumpets and loud voices
[1:04:14] and guess what one the skill of
[1:04:16] Jericho's Engineers are those loud
[1:04:17] voices and trumpets it was the loud
[1:04:19] voices and trumpets amen skill is not
[1:04:22] what changes Souls it's not what changes
[1:04:24] lives it's not what wins battles in
[1:04:27] spiritual kingdoms and these things
[1:04:28] Pharaoh had all of the skill Pharaoh had
[1:04:30] all of the army and who beat him an old
[1:04:33] man with a Shepherd stick it's not skill
[1:04:36] that's going to make the difference amen
[1:04:38] look at Paul Paul before Saul when he
[1:04:41] before he comes Paul he's got all the
[1:04:42] skill in the world he could quote he
[1:04:45] knew all the quotes he knew all the
[1:04:48] scriptures his theology was sound he was
[1:04:51] well
[1:04:51] recognized he had everything that was
[1:04:54] required of a Believer and then he met
[1:04:56] Christ and he said I forsook it all I
[1:04:59] counted as dung nothing he had was worth
[1:05:03] taking in to the New Birth he laid every
[1:05:07] single bit of it down and God used him
[1:05:09] once he laid it all down God used him to
[1:05:12] write the majority of the New Testament
[1:05:13] and set the church in order for the next
[1:05:15] 2,000 years to bring her all the way
[1:05:18] into a resurrection and a Rapture what
[1:05:20] when he laid it all down and counted it
[1:05:22] as nothing counted it as dong David was
[1:05:25] called to be
[1:05:26] King David had no skill David was just a
[1:05:29] Shepherd boy but when he was called To
[1:05:31] Be a King God gave him a king anointing
[1:05:33] and Samuel came and he poured the oil
[1:05:35] over him at the age of maybe 13 or 14
[1:05:38] but David wasn't in a position he wasn't
[1:05:40] ready to be king yet but he had an
[1:05:41] anointing on him and that was key
[1:05:43] because what the anointing had the
[1:05:46] effect of preparing him for his
[1:05:48] role you say when I become a preacher
[1:05:50] I'll I'll have a preacher's anointing no
[1:05:52] you'll have a preacher's anointing
[1:05:53] before you ever step behind a Pulpit
[1:05:55] because God will use it to draw you into
[1:05:57] your purpose and his plan amen and
[1:05:59] here's the thing that anointing did for
[1:06:00] David it kept him from taking things
[1:06:02] into his own
[1:06:03] hands he wouldn't have even started out
[1:06:07] on the path to kingship without that
[1:06:08] anointing he was he was happy to just
[1:06:10] sit there and and and raise and protect
[1:06:12] the Sheep but God called him sovereignly
[1:06:16] anointed him with oil and put an
[1:06:18] anointing on him and all of a sudden
[1:06:19] David's life changed completely and he
[1:06:21] didn't have to do a thing it was The
[1:06:23] Sovereign work of God Amen a true
[1:06:25] anointing will always make you wait on
[1:06:27] God David was known for going out and
[1:06:29] coming in he'd go in and seek the Lord
[1:06:31] he'd come out he'd do what the Lord told
[1:06:32] him to do and he always came back with
[1:06:34] the men he went out with David never
[1:06:36] lost a battle when he sought the Lord
[1:06:39] never Joshua never lost a battle when he
[1:06:42] sought the Lord the key is to follow the
[1:06:45] anointing not to let your skill take the
[1:06:47] way amen David would never force himself
[1:06:50] into the throne he wouldn't kill Saul he
[1:06:52] wouldn't take matters into his own hands
[1:06:54] none of it had allowed him to wait on
[1:06:55] God and let God do the work now notice
[1:06:57] this he says notice David was called by
[1:07:00] election he was elected called anointed
[1:07:02] in place that was I think the first
[1:07:04] series I did here in Newan land was
[1:07:05] speaking on
[1:07:07] this he says he was elected by God
[1:07:11] called from sheep hurting to be the king
[1:07:13] anointed and positionally placed he says
[1:07:16] what does the oil represent in the Bible
[1:07:17] it's the Holy Spirit and when he poured
[1:07:20] the oil upon him he baptized him with
[1:07:23] the Holy Spirit in a symbol form he
[1:07:25] poured the oil upon him it just went all
[1:07:28] over him a whole horn full of it not
[1:07:30] sparingly he says and that's the way God
[1:07:33] pours the holy ghost on a man not
[1:07:36] sparingly he says he just baptizes him
[1:07:39] in it anointing him with the spirit in
[1:07:41] other words Church the lack is not in
[1:07:43] the anointing God is not holding back
[1:07:46] his anointing amen we are holding back
[1:07:48] the anointing if anybody's holding it
[1:07:50] back amen our own thoughts or ideas the
[1:07:52] things we're feeding on Amen the lack is
[1:07:54] not in God the lack is in what the
[1:07:56] people will recognize in the working of
[1:07:57] God in their lives God has poured out
[1:07:59] his Spirit abundantly amen he wants us
[1:08:02] to have life and that more abundantly
[1:08:03] the scripture says amen what's the lack
[1:08:05] the lack is our recognition it's our
[1:08:07] revelation of what God's done in our
[1:08:09] lives amen will we surrender to the holy
[1:08:12] spirit will we recognize what it is and
[1:08:14] then will we let it do what it's
[1:08:15] supposed to do he says notice he right
[1:08:19] then when that anointing struck him he
[1:08:22] was positionally placed as king am am
[1:08:25] men he says you are positionally placed
[1:08:27] in Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests is
[1:08:29] that right the moment you receive the
[1:08:31] Holy Spirit God places you in the
[1:08:33] Kingdom an heir he says what a beautiful
[1:08:35] picture there you are there you are he
[1:08:39] says now let me drop this on the side
[1:08:42] how many Hears justifi by faith
[1:08:44] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:08:46] says every one of you put your hands up
[1:08:48] is justified by faith is that right the
[1:08:50] scripture says those who he is called
[1:08:52] he's Justified those who he's Justified
[1:08:54] he's glorified amen he says in the
[1:08:56] presence of almighty God your name is
[1:08:59] indelibly wrote with the blood of Jesus
[1:09:01] Christ glorified in his presence
[1:09:04] positionally placed on Earth for a
[1:09:07] purpose to do the will of God he says do
[1:09:10] you see your position Christian amen we
[1:09:13] look at David and we say well that's a
[1:09:15] great man of God that's a great warrior
[1:09:17] that's a king that's an anointed one he
[1:09:19] says no this is for each and every one
[1:09:21] of us our names are written we're
[1:09:23] elected we're positioned we're placed
[1:09:26] were anointed he says do you see that
[1:09:29] you've got a place just like he does
[1:09:31] it's no different he says oh my those
[1:09:34] fellows up there couldn't understand it
[1:09:36] he's talking about when David Goes To
[1:09:37] Face
[1:09:38] Goliath he says but David had the
[1:09:41] anointing oil on him he knew where he
[1:09:44] was standing he says old Goliath stood
[1:09:47] out there and he said now look let's
[1:09:49] reason why there's no need of God's
[1:09:50] armies being defeated well look at that
[1:09:52] fellow standing out there with his big
[1:09:54] boast well we know did it but the days
[1:09:56] of Miracles was passed he says not for
[1:09:58] David he was
[1:10:01] anointed he knew where he was at
[1:10:04] positionally now we can look at this and
[1:10:06] brother bam keeps saying as soon as he
[1:10:08] was anointed he was positionally placed
[1:10:11] was David in the
[1:10:12] throne
[1:10:14] no David's still just a Shepherd
[1:10:18] boy David's nowhere near the throne he's
[1:10:20] got 15 years ahead of him at least
[1:10:23] before he gets the throne and brother
[1:10:24] Braham is saying yet he's positionally
[1:10:26] placed why two things God had declared
[1:10:29] by his prophet Samuel that David was
[1:10:31] going to be King David had thus saith
[1:10:34] the
[1:10:35] Lord David had thus sayith the Lord
[1:10:37] David had the word spoken over him and
[1:10:40] then what did God do God confirmed it by
[1:10:43] putting an anointing on David to be king
[1:10:47] see here's the thing God gives his word
[1:10:49] but then he sends his Spirit to anoint
[1:10:50] it in bodies he anoints it in flesh he
[1:10:52] anoints it in people and that is our
[1:10:54] confirmation that's our Earnest that's
[1:10:56] our down payment is that God gives the
[1:10:58] word he puts thus sayeth the Lord over a
[1:11:01] bride and then he sends his holy spirit
[1:11:02] to make it happen in our lives that's
[1:11:04] what's going on in this age amen as he's
[1:11:06] confirmed it to us God confirmed his
[1:11:09] word to David by his anointing now I
[1:11:12] know we've covered this before so I
[1:11:13] won't take much time tonight but it says
[1:11:15] then Samuel took the Horn of oil and
[1:11:17] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:11:18] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[1:11:21] Upon David from that day forward just a
[1:11:25] little boy maybe younger than my my
[1:11:28] oldest boy even 13 or 14 years old they
[1:11:31] think when this happened but watch what
[1:11:33] happens on the other side it says but
[1:11:35] the spirit of the Lord departed from
[1:11:37] Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord
[1:11:40] troubled him catch that now one man is
[1:11:42] in a king position but he doesn't have a
[1:11:44] king anointing and the other one has a
[1:11:46] king anointing but no King position and
[1:11:49] watch how the things change as they move
[1:11:50] forward as soon as that Spirit comes on
[1:11:53] David it has to have left Saul because
[1:11:55] God can't anoint two men for the same
[1:11:56] position cuz that would cause conflict
[1:11:59] amen it can't be that way and as soon as
[1:12:01] God's spirit's left then what's left
[1:12:03] church an evil spirit there's only two
[1:12:06] sides here and what happens after that
[1:12:08] is Saul is left to his own ends his own
[1:12:12] skill his own intelligence his own
[1:12:13] character his own morals all those
[1:12:16] things because before God made up for
[1:12:18] Saul's mistakes praise the Lord amen God
[1:12:21] made up for it because there was
[1:12:22] anointing on him but when that anointing
[1:12:24] leaves now now what happens is Saul goes
[1:12:27] downward and downward and downward
[1:12:28] because he can't take the pressure he
[1:12:31] can't take it with to to be lowered in
[1:12:33] the people's eyes he can't take push
[1:12:35] back he lacks the patience that's needed
[1:12:38] and what happens is Saul goes from being
[1:12:40] a persecutor of the enemies to a
[1:12:42] persecutor of his own
[1:12:44] people that's what he turns into Saul
[1:12:47] turns into what Saul who became Paul
[1:12:49] later was a persecutor of his own people
[1:12:53] that's what happens when the anointing
[1:12:54] leaves him
[1:12:55] David on the other hand steps right into
[1:12:57] King kingly acts and and character and
[1:12:59] position these
[1:13:02] things what's the key if God anoints you
[1:13:06] you'll act like a person in that role
[1:13:08] whether you have the role or not that's
[1:13:11] what we see with David as soon as David
[1:13:13] gets this anointing on him what does he
[1:13:15] do he goes right back and he goes back
[1:13:16] to his
[1:13:17] responsibilities he doesn't take it on
[1:13:19] himself to become a king because he
[1:13:21] didn't ask for it he didn't ask for it
[1:13:24] there is nothing about becom becoming
[1:13:25] king of Israel that has anything to do
[1:13:26] with David's preferences or desires and
[1:13:30] he goes right back out there but what do
[1:13:31] we see is he now has the anointing of a
[1:13:34] king on him and what is the anointing of
[1:13:35] a king it's not to be served it's to
[1:13:38] protect those that are under him and
[1:13:40] under that anointing he kills a lion he
[1:13:42] kills a bear right David starts to
[1:13:45] develop this reputation and we've
[1:13:47] preached on this before and so I won't
[1:13:48] Bel it tonight but four verses after
[1:13:51] this in 1st Samuel 16:18 it says they're
[1:13:54] talking about David and this is one of
[1:13:57] Saul's servants now talking about David
[1:13:59] four verses later I don't know how long
[1:14:01] that took I don't know what kind of a
[1:14:03] time periods here but this is what
[1:14:05] David's new reputation is it says then
[1:14:07] answer one of the servants and said
[1:14:09] behold I have seen a son of Jesse the
[1:14:11] bethlehemite that is cunning and playing
[1:14:14] a mighty Valiant man a man of war and
[1:14:17] prudent in matters and a comely person
[1:14:20] and the Lord is with him this is a young
[1:14:23] man that's 13 or 14 years old church and
[1:14:26] he's a man of war he's a courageous man
[1:14:29] he's a great musician he's a
[1:14:31] good-looking guy and the Lord is with
[1:14:33] him what is it that made the difference
[1:14:36] the anointing you say I'm just a little
[1:14:38] guy young people going to school going
[1:14:41] to your jobs I'm just little old me this
[1:14:43] is what the anointing can do it'll set
[1:14:46] you apart from everybody that's around
[1:14:48] you that doesn't have it it'll lift you
[1:14:50] up because you're different not because
[1:14:52] you desire to be different not because
[1:14:54] you want an name for yourself but it
[1:14:56] sets you apart that's what the church
[1:14:58] means is those that are called out and
[1:15:00] it what is it that calls us out it's the
[1:15:02] word and then the anointing comes and
[1:15:04] confirms it and it sets a difference
[1:15:05] between us and everybody
[1:15:08] else amen if it did it for David it'll
[1:15:10] do it for
[1:15:12] you amen it he only had it on him he had
[1:15:17] an anointing on him we have an anointing
[1:15:19] in US amen we the holy spirit is
[1:15:21] resident in our lives amen and so we
[1:15:24] know we talked about David David's
[1:15:26] acting like a king years before he ever
[1:15:28] becomes king you know how you know
[1:15:30] somebody's called to a role they're
[1:15:31] already doing it they're just not
[1:15:34] usurping Authority in when they're doing
[1:15:36] it that's it you'll see people that are
[1:15:38] are like that they're exhibiting the
[1:15:40] character the nature of the role that
[1:15:42] they're called to amen and what are they
[1:15:43] doing it's the anointing that's on them
[1:15:45] that's drawing them into that role and
[1:15:47] it's not by their desire or by anything
[1:15:49] that they want but it's just the pole of
[1:15:51] God in their life that's drawing them to
[1:15:53] where they're supposed to be look at our
[1:15:55] song leaders what's the purpose of a
[1:15:57] song leader to lead the people into
[1:15:59] worship to prepare them for the going
[1:16:01] forth of the word that's the role of a
[1:16:03] song leader you know how I know who's
[1:16:05] going to be her next song leader they're
[1:16:07] already song leading amen we're going to
[1:16:10] name some names tonight do you
[1:16:13] notice brother Bob in song service if
[1:16:17] he's not up here is he all sitting there
[1:16:19] all quiet barely get him to clap his
[1:16:23] hands no he's worshiping as much right
[1:16:26] there as he does right here amen there
[1:16:29] is no difference between his actions
[1:16:31] here and his actions right there why
[1:16:33] because the anointing of a song leader
[1:16:35] is on him and whether he's there or
[1:16:37] whether he's here he's going to lead in
[1:16:39] worship he's going to have his hands up
[1:16:41] he's going to be involved in the service
[1:16:43] because there's an anointing on him to
[1:16:45] do it whether or not he's behind this
[1:16:46] Pulpit if brother Josh was sitting back
[1:16:49] there in song service and wouldn't open
[1:16:51] his mouth he would never stand behind
[1:16:52] this Pulpit as a song leader because
[1:16:55] he's got to be able to worship there
[1:16:56] before he gets the role before he ever
[1:16:58] gets it here that's the way it works
[1:17:00] amen if you can't pull your weight in
[1:17:02] the Pew you can't you can't step behind
[1:17:03] here you can't step behind there you
[1:17:05] can't be anywhere because the anointing
[1:17:07] will make you do it whether or not
[1:17:09] you've got the role you can't help it
[1:17:11] you can't help it because if you're a
[1:17:14] knee and the anointing of a knee is on
[1:17:15] you you're going to do what knees do
[1:17:18] there's nothing can stop but it just
[1:17:19] comes out of you amen that's why brother
[1:17:21] Brandon we read that quote where that
[1:17:22] young man came to him and said I'm
[1:17:23] called to preach he said well preach
[1:17:25] what are you waiting for if there's an
[1:17:27] anointing on you to preach you'll preach
[1:17:29] no matter
[1:17:30] what I me you think of preaching itself
[1:17:34] before I ever got behind a Pulpit you
[1:17:36] know what I had to learn to do help
[1:17:38] somebody preach amen I can't sit there
[1:17:41] in that Pew and sit there like a bump on
[1:17:43] a log while a Minister's up here
[1:17:45] preaching and then say well when I get
[1:17:46] up there they better be loud with me no
[1:17:49] I need to be what the preacher needs
[1:17:51] before I can be a preacher I've got to
[1:17:52] serve I've got to pull on the word I've
[1:17:54] got to pull on that gift to what create
[1:17:56] an atmosphere so that the preaching can
[1:17:58] happen amen I can't do that I can't
[1:18:01] expect people to react to me and me not
[1:18:03] react to somebody else here's the thing
[1:18:05] if you're a real preacher when the word
[1:18:06] comes forth you can't stop yourself from
[1:18:08] getting involved Hallelujah listen I
[1:18:11] don't care who's preaching I don't care
[1:18:13] who is
[1:18:16] preaching I don't care who is
[1:18:20] preaching when they open this book and
[1:18:23] if you've got the anointing of a
[1:18:25] preacher on you I don't care who is up
[1:18:27] there it will spark something in your
[1:18:31] soul absolutely listen I've been sitting
[1:18:35] here when brother Gerald's preaching
[1:18:37] since I moved here and he will preach on
[1:18:40] something and I will have three pages of
[1:18:42] notes that have nothing to do with what
[1:18:44] he's preaching why because the same
[1:18:46] anointing that's on him is on me and
[1:18:48] when the word Goes Forth it Sparks
[1:18:49] something in my soul and it takes off
[1:18:51] running sometimes I'm with them and
[1:18:54] sometimes I'm gone in another Direction
[1:18:56] but the thing is I've got to feed on it
[1:18:57] before I can give it and when another
[1:18:59] man's up there I can't help but feed on
[1:19:01] it I can't help but pull on it because
[1:19:03] the anointing that's on me to give it
[1:19:04] has to be the same anointing that's got
[1:19:05] to feed on it amen I've got to be able
[1:19:08] to serve a minister before I can be a
[1:19:10] minister amen I've got to be a part of
[1:19:12] that the words quickened while we hear
[1:19:14] these things amen we got to help each
[1:19:16] other in these things that's why I look
[1:19:18] at a at the gifts in the body and I say
[1:19:20] if they're not doing it now then they
[1:19:21] don't need to be up
[1:19:23] here amen why because the anointing has
[1:19:26] to express itself one way or the other
[1:19:28] no matter what you look at
[1:19:30] deacons my wife and I were talking about
[1:19:32] this and I don't say this to raise
[1:19:34] myself up but I Deacon for a lot of
[1:19:36] years and even as a young man they were
[1:19:38] wanting me to be a deacon very early on
[1:19:41] because they saw something there that
[1:19:42] looked like a deacon I wasn't ready to
[1:19:45] be a deacon but they saw something there
[1:19:47] so like in Texas they have what they
[1:19:49] call Junior deacons and what do they do
[1:19:51] first they watch the doors they take
[1:19:53] people in to to set up them in the in
[1:19:55] their seats and whatnot and during
[1:19:57] special meetings they help control the
[1:19:59] crowds and these things just minor roles
[1:20:00] they don't have any real Spiritual
[1:20:02] Authority but they're there to just help
[1:20:04] and then from there then they can become
[1:20:06] a senior Deacon somebody that has the
[1:20:08] that would be voted on in those roles
[1:20:10] and these different things and so what
[1:20:11] is it they saw something there that they
[1:20:14] said that's a deacon I wasn't ready for
[1:20:17] it yet but they could see something was
[1:20:19] there why because of how I live my life
[1:20:22] here's the thing you'll already be
[1:20:23] living it before you ever get voted into
[1:20:25] to do it church that's a simple fact
[1:20:27] that's a simple fact listen if our
[1:20:29] deacons don't have their houses in order
[1:20:31] they're never going to be a deacon cuz
[1:20:33] they're being a deacon already in their
[1:20:34] own home amen they'll have the character
[1:20:37] they'll have the nature that's required
[1:20:38] to be in that role first why what's it
[1:20:41] it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:42] bringing us into our role and as we
[1:20:45] surrender as we yield as we humble
[1:20:46] ourselves then what comes out of it is
[1:20:48] the very nature of whatever we're
[1:20:50] supposed to be in that body it's the
[1:20:51] anointing that makes the difference
[1:20:52] that's what I keep saying amen
[1:20:55] just to finish this quote on David he
[1:20:57] says he said he knew where he was
[1:20:59] standing he says hallelujah there you
[1:21:01] are he knew where he was standing he was
[1:21:03] a man of Faith he believed God God was
[1:21:07] in him he knew he was
[1:21:10] anointed and then he says and you know
[1:21:13] the same thing church do you know it
[1:21:15] this evening do you know it do you know
[1:21:18] that you're no different than David that
[1:21:20] God is in you and that you're anointed
[1:21:23] that's what we're talking about this
[1:21:24] evening amen what a thought that God is
[1:21:26] in you and God is in me that's what the
[1:21:29] Holy Ghost is is Christ in me the hope
[1:21:31] of glory it is the residence of Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ inside of my body and yours as
[1:21:35] well amen he says you're Christians and
[1:21:39] if God hadn't elected you to be a
[1:21:40] Christian you would not be a Christian
[1:21:42] it's God choice not yours no man seeks
[1:21:45] God no man seeks God at any time you
[1:21:47] haven't sought God but God has sought
[1:21:49] you it wasn't you calling for God it was
[1:21:52] God calling for you and then when God
[1:21:54] called you it showed he elected you you
[1:21:57] accepted the call it was justification
[1:21:59] then you gave your heart to Christ and
[1:22:01] were filled with the Holy Spirit he says
[1:22:03] and now and now you're positionally
[1:22:06] placed in the body of Christ he says now
[1:22:08] if it made you quit your old mean habits
[1:22:11] and act like a Christian ought to if
[1:22:12] it'll do that for you it'll heal your
[1:22:14] body because it's a promise what we've
[1:22:17] got battles in this body too amen and
[1:22:21] that spirit is not just to overcome
[1:22:22] Goliath out there it's here to overcome
[1:22:24] Goliath right here as well what a shame
[1:22:27] I was listening to Benny Hinn's uh
[1:22:31] YouTube suggestion to me and I was like
[1:22:33] okay it's on this cessationism versus
[1:22:36] continu
[1:22:37] ISM does the Holy Spirit till act like
[1:22:40] it used to act or is it different now
[1:22:42] and of course almost every Church except
[1:22:43] for the Pentecostals believes that it
[1:22:45] doesn't do the things it used to do
[1:22:47] anymore but I thought what a shame what
[1:22:50] a shame and there was somebody said you
[1:22:52] can't deliver yourself and I don't
[1:22:54] believe I can deliver myself from
[1:22:55] anything but I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:22:56] inside of me that can deliver anything I
[1:22:58] need to be delivered from amen and what
[1:23:01] a shame that everything is put out and
[1:23:02] there's no power left in the gospel
[1:23:04] except this little wishy-washy whatever
[1:23:08] within science within the realm of no no
[1:23:10] no no there's a greater God in us than
[1:23:12] that amen amen he's not dead he's still
[1:23:14] alive in every one of us amen notice
[1:23:17] that anointing didn't put David on the
[1:23:18] throne immediately that anointing
[1:23:20] prepared him for the throne it got David
[1:23:23] in working order before he ever put him
[1:23:25] on the throne built him up tested him
[1:23:27] corrected him put him in position to act
[1:23:29] like a king without the consequences of
[1:23:31] a king to see what his decisions would
[1:23:33] look like and most of the time David
[1:23:35] passed but you know what sometimes David
[1:23:37] failed and you know what that anointing
[1:23:39] did it caused him to
[1:23:42] repent every single time the anointing
[1:23:46] caused David to repent remember Saul
[1:23:49] comes in to use the bathroom in the cave
[1:23:51] and they say to David he's he's alone
[1:23:53] he's vulnerable
[1:23:55] kill him and David creeps up and he cuts
[1:23:57] just a part of the skirt off of his of
[1:23:59] his clothing just a little bit and then
[1:24:02] he goes out and scripture says I believe
[1:24:04] that David's heart smoted him his
[1:24:06] conscience bothered him because he
[1:24:07] didn't even touch Saul he touched Saul's
[1:24:11] robe and that anointing struck him and
[1:24:13] he had to come out and confess his
[1:24:16] wrong possibly to the detriment of his
[1:24:20] life remember we said this in a couple
[1:24:22] Services ago sometimes the way we handle
[1:24:24] our wrongs is a greater proof of our
[1:24:26] anointing than the way we live day to
[1:24:28] day amen cuz the anointing will always
[1:24:32] humble you to the word every single time
[1:24:36] every single time the Zeal of this age
[1:24:38] this leoan age is to repent amen and if
[1:24:41] you got the Holy Ghost you will repent
[1:24:43] you will repent you will repent and you
[1:24:45] will make it right we talked about nabal
[1:24:47] David nearly killed nabal and his
[1:24:49] servants over some rude comments and
[1:24:51] dismissing David's help and it was the
[1:24:53] grace of God that Abigail Abel's wife
[1:24:55] came and what did she do she reminded
[1:24:57] David of who he
[1:24:59] was this is above you David this is
[1:25:02] below you you're higher than what you're
[1:25:03] acting because what happened was David
[1:25:05] took that anointing and he put it aside
[1:25:07] and he stood up on his own rights he
[1:25:09] stood up on his own morals he stood up
[1:25:11] on his own feelings and he said this guy
[1:25:13] is worthy of
[1:25:15] death and what was it God sent a woman
[1:25:18] to hold him back to preserve his
[1:25:22] kingdom David needed to pass that test
[1:25:24] test and he failed the test but God kept
[1:25:26] him from going through it but then we
[1:25:28] see many years
[1:25:30] later what would happen
[1:25:32] because what happened with nabal was
[1:25:35] that David acted like
[1:25:38] Saul that's what Saul would do Saul
[1:25:40] would preserve his face his
[1:25:42] reputation and David started acting like
[1:25:45] Saul what did he do he pushed that
[1:25:46] spirit away from him and he went in his
[1:25:48] own righteous anger and he went to act
[1:25:51] on it and he started acting just like
[1:25:52] Saul is that shows Church without that
[1:25:56] Holy Ghost we'll act just like every
[1:25:58] single person out there every single
[1:26:02] time every single time what get caught
[1:26:05] up in our own way of things our own
[1:26:07] rights our own works and he forgot that
[1:26:09] a king is about serving not about
[1:26:10] killing amen eventually God put David on
[1:26:13] the throne we know that and how do we
[1:26:15] know it David was working properly David
[1:26:19] was in his position he held to being a
[1:26:21] true Godly King and we see David many
[1:26:23] years later and he's fleeing Jerusalem
[1:26:25] because absam has taken the throne by
[1:26:27] force and when he's leaving this man
[1:26:29] called Shem comes out and he starts
[1:26:31] cursing at David and he starts throwing
[1:26:33] rocks at him this is basically the same
[1:26:36] as nabal but now it's personal now it's
[1:26:38] direct now David if he hadn't been tuned
[1:26:41] up by God if he hadn't been working
[1:26:42] properly he'd have gone over and killed
[1:26:44] that man
[1:26:45] himself what would we do if somebody was
[1:26:47] cursing at us and throwing rocks at us
[1:26:50] and we've got a men a bunch of men
[1:26:51] around us with swords and Spears
[1:26:54] you know we we wouldn't have even said a
[1:26:55] word we just
[1:26:57] pointed in our flesh and those men
[1:27:00] wouldn't need a command they'd know
[1:27:02] exactly because they'd be feeling the
[1:27:03] very things that we're feeling and they'
[1:27:05] want to act on them but that's what the
[1:27:07] anointings to do is bring those emotions
[1:27:09] under
[1:27:10] control watch this okay so Shem is out
[1:27:12] there and he's throwing rocks and he's
[1:27:14] calling David a dog and all these
[1:27:15] different things then said abashi the
[1:27:17] son of Zarah un the king why should this
[1:27:20] dead dog curse my Lord the king let me
[1:27:22] go over I pray thee and take off his
[1:27:25] head you know what sometimes people want
[1:27:28] to do a preacher's dirty work for
[1:27:30] him I've seen it preacher don't get your
[1:27:33] hands dirty we'll take care of this no
[1:27:35] no no let it
[1:27:39] be he says and the King said what have I
[1:27:41] to do with you you sons of
[1:27:43] Zariah abashi was joab's brother
[1:27:45] remember these are bloodthirsty men
[1:27:47] joab's the one that killed Abner right
[1:27:50] David didn't want to kill Abner David
[1:27:52] didn't want to ever take anything by
[1:27:54] force from his own people these sons of
[1:27:56] Zariah were constantly a plague they
[1:27:58] were a thorn in David's side they were
[1:27:59] Mighty Warriors tremendous men in battle
[1:28:02] but they had no real moral
[1:28:04] character he says so let him curse
[1:28:07] because the Lord ha said unto him curse
[1:28:09] David David says God told him to do it
[1:28:13] who then shall say wherefore hast thou
[1:28:14] done this he says who are we to say why
[1:28:16] are you doing it and David said to
[1:28:18] abashi and to all his servants behold my
[1:28:20] son which came forth of my bowels
[1:28:22] seeketh my life how much more now may
[1:28:24] this benjamite do it let him alone and
[1:28:26] let him curse for the Lord had bidden
[1:28:28] him he's a benjamite same as Saul right
[1:28:32] he's got old family wounds stirred up
[1:28:34] there now David's prospering and he was
[1:28:37] bitter that whole time now David's being
[1:28:39] taken out of out his King and he's going
[1:28:40] out there and he's gloating over
[1:28:42] it he says let him alone and let him
[1:28:44] curse for the Lord hath bidden him he
[1:28:47] says it may be that the Lord will look
[1:28:49] on mine Affliction and that the Lord
[1:28:50] will requite me good for his cursing
[1:28:52] this day DAV says we'll leave this in
[1:28:55] the Lord's hands he may turn this into
[1:28:57] good for me but regardless we're going
[1:29:00] to leave him alone he says and as David
[1:29:02] and his when men went by the way shemay
[1:29:05] went along on the hillside over against
[1:29:06] him and cursed as he went and threw
[1:29:08] stones at him and cast us he didn't let
[1:29:11] him go you've got to have a real problem
[1:29:13] to chase after a king that's got some
[1:29:15] angry warriors with him but this guy
[1:29:17] followed him the whole way out and
[1:29:19] constantly berated him through rocks at
[1:29:21] him through dust at him cursed at him
[1:29:23] and David didn't lift
[1:29:25] finger you know why David wasn't worried
[1:29:28] Church what put David on the throne the
[1:29:31] anointing when David's walking out of
[1:29:33] Jerusalem where's the anointing has it
[1:29:36] left him no the anointing is still with
[1:29:39] him because here's the thing if the
[1:29:41] anointing is not there David doesn't
[1:29:42] want the kingdom that's the simple truth
[1:29:46] you and you'll see that you know we've
[1:29:48] got people that have you know we've got
[1:29:50] brother Gerald that resigned last year
[1:29:51] and these different things and what is
[1:29:53] it it's the spirit of God moving
[1:29:55] back and it's okay because if it we're
[1:29:59] not anointed to do it why would we do it
[1:30:01] what's the point and David but David
[1:30:04] knows the anointing is still with me so
[1:30:06] I'm still in God's
[1:30:07] hands Saul knew when the anointing left
[1:30:10] him David would know when the anointing
[1:30:13] left him David knew what it meant to be
[1:30:15] in the presence of God David knew what
[1:30:17] it meant to be out of the will of God
[1:30:19] David's not feeling any of those things
[1:30:20] right here he says God's in it we're
[1:30:23] just going to go our way
[1:30:25] that's the character of the anointing in
[1:30:27] a person's life
[1:30:29] amen why David didn't take the throne
[1:30:32] God gave it to him so he said God gives
[1:30:35] God can take away God plac me in it God
[1:30:38] can pull me out it's all up to God this
[1:30:40] is not by my own choosing by any means
[1:30:42] what made David a Godly King and Saul
[1:30:44] not they both had the exact same
[1:30:48] anointing notice it left Saul and it
[1:30:50] went to David the exact same anointing
[1:30:53] what made the difference David was
[1:30:55] surrendered to it Saul just used it
[1:30:59] that's it Saul used it Saul used it for
[1:31:02] his benefit and all he did was built
[1:31:04] himself up in his own eyes and in the
[1:31:06] eyes of the people and David just
[1:31:07] surrendered to it David
[1:31:10] ran from it he ran from conflict he ran
[1:31:13] from trying to take it he ran from
[1:31:15] anybody that tried to influence him he
[1:31:17] wanted nothing to do it David just
[1:31:19] wanted to serve and he served as a
[1:31:21] captain he went in and out he went in
[1:31:22] and out and you know he had to go out
[1:31:24] and kill a bunch of Philistines to get
[1:31:26] Saul's daughter that was rightfully owed
[1:31:28] to him all these different things and he
[1:31:30] just stepped up to every Challenge and
[1:31:31] he beat it and he beat it and he beat it
[1:31:33] why he was anointed to do it but there's
[1:31:36] nothing in him that was crying out for
[1:31:37] these things he was just driven to do it
[1:31:39] by the anointing on him David was
[1:31:41] willing to be trained he was willing to
[1:31:43] wait that was the biggest thing with
[1:31:44] David he was willing to wait David was
[1:31:46] willing to wait to perform the work of
[1:31:48] God and Saul just wanted to get on with
[1:31:50] it as soon as it looked like he was
[1:31:51] going to lose the people then he
[1:31:52] crumbled and he went against what God
[1:31:54] had said and then he did it twice and
[1:31:56] after that God said I can't work with
[1:31:57] you you're too focused on yourself and
[1:32:00] not focused enough on what I want you to
[1:32:01] do David's greatest desire what did
[1:32:05] David say in the Psalms one thing have I
[1:32:08] desired that I may dwell in the house of
[1:32:10] the Lord forever all David wanted was to
[1:32:13] be in God's presence that's the only
[1:32:15] thing that mattered he's walking out of
[1:32:17] Jerusalem and he's left his his kingdom
[1:32:19] and his throne behind but he still got
[1:32:21] God and that's all he cared about he
[1:32:23] still got God
[1:32:24] we see what Moses did you know and he
[1:32:26] he's perhaps the greatest difference we
[1:32:28] see in the scriptures of an anointing
[1:32:29] because Moses knew he was a deliverer he
[1:32:32] knew his position ahead of time had'
[1:32:33] been prophesied had been told to him
[1:32:35] he'd been raised as a deliverer but
[1:32:37] without a commission and without an
[1:32:38] anointing brother says all he ended up
[1:32:40] with was one dead Egyptian but as soon
[1:32:42] as he goes out into that desert becomes
[1:32:45] a
[1:32:46] nothing develops a stutter says I can't
[1:32:49] do it now God meets him and puts an
[1:32:51] anointing on him and that makes all the
[1:32:52] difference he goes down brother Bram
[1:32:54] says he's an 80-year-old man with his
[1:32:55] big long Gray beard flowing behind him
[1:32:57] and he says I'm going to deliver the
[1:32:58] children of Israel a onean army that's
[1:33:01] the difference the anointing makes
[1:33:03] amen we've all got to go through that
[1:33:05] honing remember we talked about that
[1:33:07] last service there's a honing there's a
[1:33:08] placing but there's a honing that makes
[1:33:10] us fit just perfectly into the body for
[1:33:13] some of us it takes a little bit of time
[1:33:15] for some of us it takes a long time for
[1:33:17] Moses it took 40 Years of
[1:33:19] honing before God could use him brother
[1:33:23] Bram says this
[1:33:25] he says God has got a purpose of you
[1:33:27] being
[1:33:28] here God has a promise of you put your
[1:33:31] name there tonight see if you can only
[1:33:34] be get to that place how much trouble
[1:33:37] you save God and yourself too we look
[1:33:40] around don't we listen some of us fought
[1:33:43] Things Early in our life I look at
[1:33:44] myself I mean I fought God for seven
[1:33:47] years feeling called to to give my life
[1:33:49] to him what a waste of seven years what
[1:33:52] a waste
[1:33:54] he says just give up just let it go just
[1:33:58] give in to God he says how much trouble
[1:34:01] you save yourself and God now listen God
[1:34:05] God's not seeing things as trouble the
[1:34:06] way we do but it's a mess it's a mess
[1:34:10] and nobody likes a mess he says Moses
[1:34:13] born and then afterwards he was brought
[1:34:14] to the place where he was anointed he
[1:34:17] says and notice the seed laying there
[1:34:19] with an intellectual
[1:34:21] conception with all the the faith that
[1:34:24] he was born to deliver this people you
[1:34:27] say I've got all faith and I know my
[1:34:29] purpose that wasn't enough for
[1:34:32] Moses he says and yet it never came to
[1:34:35] life until that light from the burning
[1:34:37] light burning bush flashed across it
[1:34:40] until he saw not something he read about
[1:34:43] but something he seen with his eyes
[1:34:46] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:34:48] back to it he says oh how that did bring
[1:34:51] things to life now that's one thing I
[1:34:52] will say is that when I gave my heart to
[1:34:55] the Lord he spoke to me and I spoke back
[1:34:58] it's one thing to be under conviction
[1:34:59] it's another thing to hear your name
[1:35:01] called amen and when I gave my life that
[1:35:03] service with brother Barry and brother
[1:35:05] Donnie Reagan I heard my name called
[1:35:07] loud and clear it was my name it was not
[1:35:08] a general call it was Jonathan klet I'm
[1:35:11] calling you tonight under the Discerning
[1:35:13] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:35:15] amen that's what it takes for each and
[1:35:17] every one of us is a personal experience
[1:35:19] that's what the new birth is brother
[1:35:20] Brown says it's a personal experience of
[1:35:22] Jesus Christ to you it's real it's
[1:35:26] personal it's direct
[1:35:28] amen what is this intellectual
[1:35:32] conception we can read this all day long
[1:35:34] and don't stop reading it we can have
[1:35:38] faith but we've got to be anointed we've
[1:35:41] got to be anointed to make the
[1:35:43] difference what's the anointing the
[1:35:45] anointing is the Dynamics of God's Will
[1:35:46] and
[1:35:47] purpose that's what his word is his will
[1:35:49] and purpose amen the anointing is the
[1:35:51] Dynamics of God Amen it's the energy
[1:35:53] it's the motive it's the power it's the
[1:35:55] objective it's the purpose it's the will
[1:35:57] it's the life it's the love everything
[1:36:00] that's needed that's what's being pushed
[1:36:02] into Sons and Daughters of God Amen what
[1:36:04] is it it's Perfection flowing through us
[1:36:07] not performance it's Perfection what is
[1:36:11] perfection church for the believer to
[1:36:13] hit the mark That's What Perfection is
[1:36:16] see performance is eloquent words a
[1:36:19] perfectly delivered sermon a a a a song
[1:36:22] Some with perfect pitch
[1:36:24] no crying in
[1:36:27] it
[1:36:29] amen that's performance but Perfection
[1:36:33] is to hit the mark what God wants you to
[1:36:35] do in his time in his season his way by
[1:36:39] his leading that's what's flowing
[1:36:41] through us is perfection not performance
[1:36:43] amen the world has performance
[1:36:45] nailed they can perform like you would
[1:36:48] not believe remember I've talked about
[1:36:49] you know you even the song I shared with
[1:36:51] some of the the the the song leaders and
[1:36:53] the musicians to learn that we're going
[1:36:55] to be learning and you look at the
[1:36:56] voices and the sound systems what sound
[1:36:59] systems brother Matt what camera
[1:37:02] work what mixing what blending they have
[1:37:06] a full Orchestra there they've got
[1:37:08] performance
[1:37:10] nailed and you know what's written over
[1:37:12] the back of the church
[1:37:15] ikabod the glory of the Lord has
[1:37:17] departed amazing performance no
[1:37:20] Perfection it doesn't hit the mark
[1:37:24] amen it's the anointing that makes the
[1:37:26] difference it's the anointing that hits
[1:37:29] the mark what is a blessing Church a
[1:37:32] blessing is God is in
[1:37:36] it that's it when God is in it when it's
[1:37:39] God in us when the god when God is on
[1:37:41] our side that's what a blessing is
[1:37:44] that's what we're looking to be amen the
[1:37:46] anointing is the only thing that can
[1:37:47] take a person and make them a blessing
[1:37:50] it's the anointing because it's God in
[1:37:51] us amen the anointing is what makes us
[1:37:53] work properly we say well how can I do
[1:37:56] it can I do it brother John you're
[1:37:57] preaching some pretty heady
[1:38:00] stuff I'm just a a housewife sitting at
[1:38:03] home I just grade papers all day and I
[1:38:05] just make food and clean houses and wipe
[1:38:07] babies bottoms and try and be ready for
[1:38:10] my husband to come home how am I going
[1:38:12] to do this Brothers working 8 10 12
[1:38:16] maybe 4 hours a
[1:38:18] day how am I going to do it where am I
[1:38:20] going to get this time to do this how am
[1:38:22] I going to come to a higher
[1:38:24] level the
[1:38:26] anointing because the anointing is here
[1:38:29] the word has been spoken and the
[1:38:31] anointing goes out to bring the word to
[1:38:34] pass you're a child of God the anointing
[1:38:37] in you will make you a child of God
[1:38:39] whether you want to or not it'll bring
[1:38:42] the word to fruition amen how are we
[1:38:45] going to do it we'll do it because God
[1:38:46] said so and his word is backed up by his
[1:38:49] holy spirit to bring it to pass brother
[1:38:51] Brown says this he says the two spirits
[1:38:54] one of them God's holy spirit the other
[1:38:56] one the devil's Spirit working in
[1:38:58] deception the people of the world of the
[1:39:00] Earth are now making their choice the
[1:39:03] holy spirit's here calling out a bride
[1:39:05] for Christ he's doing it by vindicating
[1:39:07] his Word of Promise to her for this age
[1:39:10] showing that it is Christ now catch this
[1:39:13] how are we going to do it Church what's
[1:39:16] this working properly going to look like
[1:39:18] how are we going to get into position
[1:39:20] how are we going to get together how is
[1:39:21] this body going to do what it's supposed
[1:39:23] to do catch this he says if the finger
[1:39:27] is supposed to move in this age the
[1:39:29] finger will move he says if the foot is
[1:39:32] supposed to move in this age the foot
[1:39:35] will move if the eye is to see in this
[1:39:37] age the eye will see what's going to
[1:39:40] make it happen he says see the spirit of
[1:39:43] God as it's grown into the full stature
[1:39:47] of God is the age that we're now living
[1:39:52] in can I say it this way the spirit of
[1:39:54] God as it's what he's talking about the
[1:39:57] bride of Christ as the bride of Christ
[1:39:59] is grown into the full stature of God is
[1:40:02] the age that we're now living in he says
[1:40:04] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[1:40:07] message of the hour and the Holy Spirit
[1:40:10] is doing this so that the people that
[1:40:12] believe God will be called out of this
[1:40:15] chaos it is a mess out there the
[1:40:18] religious world I I've shared some of
[1:40:21] the things I've seen and I it's
[1:40:22] certainly open my eyes to the the one
[1:40:26] the fanaticism that's out there but two
[1:40:29] the absolute lack of biblical
[1:40:31] truth just the Simplicity of the full
[1:40:34] word is completely lacking out there you
[1:40:36] don't you don't have to go look at the
[1:40:37] world you just look at Christianity
[1:40:39] Today and you see the chaos that's there
[1:40:42] much less what the rest of the world has
[1:40:44] he says but the holy spirit's here so
[1:40:46] that we'll be called out of all of
[1:40:48] that catch this Moses said it's not just
[1:40:51] me going we're all going
[1:40:55] oh well what about the brothers have
[1:40:56] this because they don't get fooled as
[1:40:58] easily as us sisters and they get more
[1:41:00] time to spend in the word and they get
[1:41:02] to talk to the preachers and the way no
[1:41:03] no no no no we're all going if the eye
[1:41:07] is going to see it's going to see if the
[1:41:09] foot's got to move it's going to move if
[1:41:11] the hand's going to move it's going to
[1:41:12] move in this age if God has determined
[1:41:14] it's going to be it's going to be amen
[1:41:18] he says we all got something to do we've
[1:41:22] all got to be anointed amen we've all
[1:41:26] got to be anointed why because we're all
[1:41:27] going and we're all a part of the body
[1:41:29] and I can't leave until you're in and
[1:41:31] you can't leave until I'm in and working
[1:41:34] properly by the
[1:41:37] anointing we said what is a blessing a
[1:41:39] blessing is God in something what's a
[1:41:41] curse a curse is the absence of God you
[1:41:43] look at the the
[1:41:45] Israelites okay God would give them
[1:41:47] blessings and curses and he says I'll
[1:41:48] bless you if you follow my word and I'll
[1:41:50] curse you if you don't what was the
[1:41:52] difference between a blessing in a curse
[1:41:54] never the situation the situations were
[1:41:57] always the same Israel was always
[1:41:58] surrounded by armies they were
[1:42:00] surrounded by people that hated them
[1:42:02] people that wanted to land back people
[1:42:03] that wanted to kill them but the
[1:42:04] blessing was that God was with them the
[1:42:06] curse was when God removed his hand of
[1:42:07] protection because he wasn't
[1:42:09] there what am I getting at we're talking
[1:42:12] about the anointing we're talking about
[1:42:13] our places our positions our gifts our
[1:42:15] callings take our gifts and our
[1:42:17] callings and let God have them what do
[1:42:19] we have a blessing
[1:42:23] remove God from the equation and what is
[1:42:25] it a
[1:42:28] curse it can be a Godly gift it can be a
[1:42:31] Godly calling but if it's not anointed
[1:42:34] who's in
[1:42:35] control this
[1:42:37] guy and guess what this guy is always
[1:42:41] self-serving by
[1:42:43] nature and so it always leads to me
[1:42:45] being served rather than me serving amen
[1:42:48] by your fruits you know it amen and if I
[1:42:50] sow it of myself then I'm going to reap
[1:42:52] what I slded which is just Humanity
[1:42:55] Fallen condition failure amen one of the
[1:42:58] greatest deceptions in Christianity is a
[1:43:00] real gift operated by a man or a woman
[1:43:03] because it's a real gift it's there but
[1:43:06] what is it there's an intention in the
[1:43:07] heart that's not fully surrendered to
[1:43:09] the Holy Ghost and it can be a real gift
[1:43:11] and that person what do they eventually
[1:43:13] produce is they produce denomination
[1:43:15] they produce self they produce kingdoms
[1:43:17] they produce influence and all of these
[1:43:19] different things and it just leads them
[1:43:21] off into a ditch and they drag a bunch
[1:43:22] of people else with them amen the only
[1:43:25] way you know what's right and wrong is
[1:43:26] if it stays with the word that is always
[1:43:28] the test of every person of every gift
[1:43:31] of every Ministry whatever it is it
[1:43:33] stays with the word anybody here can say
[1:43:36] they've always stayed with the
[1:43:37] word a
[1:43:41] 100% well what does that mean brother
[1:43:43] John we can't be anointed if we made
[1:43:45] mistakes no the anointing will always
[1:43:47] restore you back to the word it'll bring
[1:43:49] you to repentance it'll humble you it'll
[1:43:52] correct you
[1:43:54] and it'll bring you back to the word
[1:43:56] Perfection is not what we're looking at
[1:43:57] here it's what's in our heart to do it's
[1:44:00] what's in our heart to do and the thing
[1:44:02] is we'll come back to that word every
[1:44:03] time the anointing caused David to
[1:44:05] repent the anointing on us causes us to
[1:44:07] repent when we get out of line when we
[1:44:09] get caught up in ourselves amen
[1:44:11] otherwise what happens is the gift
[1:44:12] continues in error and the fruits come
[1:44:15] out and what does it prove it proves
[1:44:17] that it was swn in error it was swn in
[1:44:19] the flesh Paul said this in Galatians he
[1:44:21] says be not deceived
[1:44:23] God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man
[1:44:26] sth that shall he also reap for he that
[1:44:28] sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[1:44:30] corruption how do you swow to your flesh
[1:44:33] act in the flesh Act without the
[1:44:36] anointing amen with the anointing that's
[1:44:39] god without the anointing it's flesh
[1:44:41] then we act in the flesh we Act of our
[1:44:43] own accord we Act of our own will our
[1:44:44] purpose benefit self- serving whatever
[1:44:46] it is that's always a curse amen so if
[1:44:49] we sow to the flesh we'll reap
[1:44:50] corruption but he that sth to the Spirit
[1:44:53] shall of the spirit reap life
[1:44:54] Everlasting so if we act by the spirit
[1:44:57] if we're anointed by the spirit then
[1:44:58] what comes out is
[1:45:00] eternal it's Eternal
[1:45:02] amen and we've seen that in our
[1:45:05] lives and here's the difficulty is
[1:45:08] always that we've got to see so much
[1:45:09] time so many times with spirit
[1:45:12] harvests and me we look at how we raise
[1:45:14] our children we look at how much we come
[1:45:16] to church we look at tithing we look at
[1:45:18] all these different things and it's
[1:45:19] always the long game with God God is not
[1:45:22] this person that just does this all the
[1:45:23] time that's Satan's kingdom Flash and
[1:45:26] quickness God is just nice and
[1:45:28] consistent all the way through and then
[1:45:30] in a moment he'll make a change but
[1:45:31] really he's been building up to it all
[1:45:33] along amen so what we see that it'll be
[1:45:36] worth it all
[1:45:38] someday but Satan's saying let's make it
[1:45:40] worthwhile
[1:45:41] today that immediacy of response to what
[1:45:44] we do that's when we start sewing to the
[1:45:46] flesh but scripture says God's not
[1:45:48] mocked God won't be made a fool of
[1:45:51] whatever you sow is what you'll reap
[1:45:53] and if you sow to the flesh you'll reap
[1:45:55] of the flesh but if you swow to the
[1:45:56] spirit you'll reap of the spirit amen
[1:45:58] why because when you swow to the spirit
[1:46:00] it's him that's planting it's not you
[1:46:01] and that means you get his Harvest not
[1:46:03] your
[1:46:04] Harvest amen Paul would say this in the
[1:46:07] in the in the previous chapter in
[1:46:08] Galatians 5 he says but the fruit of the
[1:46:10] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[1:46:14] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[1:46:16] Temperance against such there is no law
[1:46:19] and they that are Christ have crucified
[1:46:21] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[1:46:24] he says if we live in the spirit he
[1:46:26] other words he says if you're alive if
[1:46:28] you're strong by the spirit if the thing
[1:46:30] that keeps you going as a spirit he says
[1:46:32] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:46:34] walk in the spirit that word walk means
[1:46:36] let us order our days order our actions
[1:46:38] order our words let our day be ordered
[1:46:40] by it if we say we're living by the
[1:46:42] spirit then let's live by the spirit
[1:46:45] amen if our I I if our life of us is the
[1:46:47] spirit then let's let the life that's
[1:46:49] that comes out of it be the spirit also
[1:46:51] he says and let us not be desirous of
[1:46:53] vain Glory provoking one another and
[1:46:56] envying one another there's only one
[1:46:58] thing we're supposed to provoke each
[1:46:59] other too and that's good
[1:47:01] works amen that's the only thing we're
[1:47:04] supposed to provoke each other
[1:47:06] too not Desir us of vain Glory not
[1:47:09] desirous of people to give us attention
[1:47:12] recognition influence money whatever it
[1:47:16] might be no no no we're not seeking that
[1:47:18] we're seeking to edify always to edify
[1:47:21] always to serve brother BR says this he
[1:47:24] says so you see what we are we must
[1:47:26] remember that we are only what we are by
[1:47:29] the grace of God how can I be desirous
[1:47:31] of vain glory for something that has
[1:47:33] nothing to do with
[1:47:34] me I know what I am without
[1:47:38] him I didn't much like
[1:47:41] it
[1:47:42] amen how can I be desirous of vain Glory
[1:47:45] when it's his work that's made me what I
[1:47:46] am today amen and if there's anything
[1:47:50] bad it's because I've held back not cuz
[1:47:52] he he's held back why would I be
[1:47:54] desirous to to gain what he's what he's
[1:47:56] obviously done the work for gain the any
[1:48:00] recognition for it he says we must
[1:48:01] remember that we are only what we are by
[1:48:03] the grace of God and none of us can brag
[1:48:05] about it we can only bow in adoration
[1:48:08] and humility before God and give praise
[1:48:10] to him for his goodness
[1:48:14] amen as we
[1:48:16] close he says if we live in the spirit
[1:48:19] let us walk in the spirit if we sow to
[1:48:21] the spirit we'll have the spirit life
[1:48:23] Everlasting what's that Harvest that we
[1:48:24] re reap when it's all said and done when
[1:48:27] we're in our place when we're joined and
[1:48:29] knitted together when we're working
[1:48:30] properly Paul says that it causes the
[1:48:33] body to grow and mature building itself
[1:48:36] up in
[1:48:37] Love no there it says it causes it we
[1:48:41] talked about if you're anointed you
[1:48:42] can't help it well here's the thing if
[1:48:44] we're all anointed and we're all joined
[1:48:47] and we're all in our place and we're all
[1:48:49] working effectively and properly it
[1:48:51] causes the the body to grow and mature
[1:48:55] it can't help it it can't help it that's
[1:48:57] just the effect of a body that's healthy
[1:49:00] is it grows and it matures it gets
[1:49:01] better it gets stronger and what's
[1:49:03] happening is God's trying to get us to
[1:49:05] the place where we're all together that
[1:49:07] that head can come down and that'll be
[1:49:08] the final manifestation of the power of
[1:49:11] God that's the great ending that's
[1:49:13] that's the sudden bang at the end of the
[1:49:15] show you know when when we go to the
[1:49:17] fireworks and that they have all these
[1:49:18] things going off but at the end they
[1:49:20] have the grand finale don't they and
[1:49:22] that's what we're all waiting for is
[1:49:23] when they just give us three solid
[1:49:24] minutes
[1:49:26] of oh wow that's what's going to happen
[1:49:29] at the end is the whole body is knitted
[1:49:31] together and then Christ comes down and
[1:49:33] there's that quick short work to show
[1:49:35] this is
[1:49:35] she and then we're
[1:49:38] gone what does it take knowing your
[1:49:41] place being anointed and staying in it
[1:49:44] in love serving the body of
[1:49:47] Christ it's very simple so simple but
[1:49:52] can we do it
[1:49:54] what's full maturity it's Christ the
[1:49:57] word expressed in you and I that's it
[1:50:00] that's what full maturity is Christ the
[1:50:02] word expressed in the whole body I do my
[1:50:04] little bit you do your little bit you do
[1:50:07] your little bit you do your little bit
[1:50:08] and what is it it's now a whole
[1:50:10] revelation of Christ being shown once
[1:50:12] again to this world before he takes the
[1:50:13] bride off of this planet that's where
[1:50:16] the greater power comes in when you're
[1:50:18] in your place and I'm in my
[1:50:20] place he says every little gift that you
[1:50:22] have have don't use it to try and make
[1:50:24] it some great something for ourselves
[1:50:27] let's make it for the kingdom of God to
[1:50:29] work with everyone to try to uplift the
[1:50:31] cause of Jesus Christ for his coming is
[1:50:34] soon how soon is it my wife and I were
[1:50:38] talking about retirement
[1:50:40] plans and life insurance and all these
[1:50:44] different things you know I'm 44 and

[1:51:00] be old what are we going to be doing in
[1:51:02] these different things and through it

[1:52:05] ready to be led by the Holy Spirit mind
[1:52:09] him obey him do what you can for
[1:52:13] him see we look at it as such a big
[1:52:16] thing sons of God are led by the spirit
[1:52:18] of God what I have found and this is
[1:52:21] just me you you read this every day and
[1:52:24] serving him becomes quite
[1:52:26] simple it becomes very simple and you
[1:52:29] only have to look one day at a time
[1:52:31] that's the beauty of it you just sit
[1:52:33] there and say Lord what's coming my way
[1:52:35] today would you be in it that's all
[1:52:38] you're inviting him in you're saying
[1:52:40] Lord anoint me for whatever comes my way
[1:52:42] today he says when you see a place that
[1:52:45] you could be used let God use you in
[1:52:48] that listen if the door is open it's
[1:52:51] probably for
[1:52:54] you you're the only one standing there
[1:52:57] God doesn't open a door so that
[1:52:58] unbelievers walk through he opens a door
[1:53:00] so Believers can walk through it when
[1:53:02] you see a place where you could be used
[1:53:04] let God use you in that do you believe
[1:53:06] that he says if God LED you out here he
[1:53:08] brought you out for a purpose that was
[1:53:10] for something he could give to you he
[1:53:12] says now we've got the message in our
[1:53:14] hearts let's do something about it he
[1:53:17] says let's ask God tonight in Christ's
[1:53:19] name to fill our hearts a new and send
[1:53:21] us away from here with with a new vision
[1:53:24] with a new determination to being led by
[1:53:26] the Holy Ghost cased in and a wall on
[1:53:30] the outside separating us from the
[1:53:32] things of the world to be new creatures
[1:53:35] in Christ Jesus amen God bless you let's
[1:53:37] Stand Together amen I like that a new
[1:53:40] vision a new
[1:53:42] determination to be led by the Holy
[1:53:44] Ghost amen is that your desire this
[1:53:46] evening Lord I want to be led by the
[1:53:48] Holy Spirit listen you can't be led by
[1:53:50] it if you don't have it and amen we've
[1:53:52] got to seek and say Lord fill me fill me
[1:53:55] a new amen there's one there there's one
[1:53:58] baptism but there's many refilling if we
[1:54:00] could put it that way me sometimes we
[1:54:02] get dry sometimes we get crusty
[1:54:04] sometimes we get bitter sometimes we get
[1:54:06] tired anybody tired
[1:54:08] tonight we get tired you know what we
[1:54:11] need a
[1:54:12] refilling we need a refreshing because
[1:54:15] that's what a refilling is is a
[1:54:16] refreshing we haven't lost our Salvation
[1:54:18] we've lost the joy of our Salvation we
[1:54:21] haven't lost a God to worship we've just
[1:54:22] lost the worship that he deserves
[1:54:24] sometimes and say Lord fill me a new use
[1:54:27] me fill me overflow me and as the do
[1:54:32] open help me to walk through and just be
[1:54:33] what you want me to be you don't have to
[1:54:36] think about some what am I going to say
[1:54:38] what am I going to do just be you that's
[1:54:40] why God Made You just be you we're not
[1:54:43] here to break down the word and do some
[1:54:46] big sermon for somebody tell them what
[1:54:48] God's done for you share what God's done
[1:54:50] for you I had another meeting with a
[1:54:52] with a client this week and shared some
[1:54:54] things that God's been doing why you
[1:54:57] just throwing out a seed he said what
[1:54:59] are you doing this summer I said well we
[1:55:01] doing this and we're doing this and we
[1:55:03] got the church here and did you know we
[1:55:04] got that and and we're doing this and
[1:55:06] we're doing that he's like
[1:55:07] whoa and you never know maybe one night
[1:55:10] he'll walk through that that door just
[1:55:12] out of curiosity to see how is that guy
[1:55:14] a preacher and also doing the sort of
[1:55:16] work that he's doing what just walk
[1:55:18] through the little doors that God opens
[1:55:20] and it's up to him to water it it's up
[1:55:22] to him to make it grow into something
[1:55:25] amen we just have to be us I think
[1:55:27] that's the pressure and this is
[1:55:28] something I I'm well experienced with
[1:55:30] because you say well you're a preacher
[1:55:32] you're a pastor you know no I don't know
[1:55:34] anything half of the things I'm doing
[1:55:35] I'm doing for the first time these days
[1:55:38] but I've got to walk by faith that God
[1:55:40] has prepared me for whatever is coming
[1:55:42] my way and you're no different you're no
[1:55:44] different if you're faithful in those
[1:55:45] little things you'll find when the
[1:55:47] moment comes you've got everything that
[1:55:48] you need and just be you just be real
[1:55:51] and that's all God's looking for it's in
[1:55:53] his hands anyways it's not me that's
[1:55:55] doing it's the anointing that's on me
[1:55:57] that's the thing that we're trusting in
[1:55:58] amen God help us let's bow our heads
