walk Closer to You Lord as this word comes forth Lord may we look at ourselves in the mirror of your word Lord not look to the brother or sister to the left or the right Lord but may we squarely Lord just regard ourselves Lord and compare what we're hearing to what we're seeing Lord and where the Gap exists where the difference is Lord we say let your spirit have its effect in our life Lord that by the washing of the word we could reflect you to a dying generation Lord I pray you lift us higher be with us now we pray Lord remembering the many sick Lord remembering sister Becky Lord praying us special Grace to her Heavenly Father praying for brother Doug Gail Lord a touch on him Lord that the doctor's report would be perfect Lord your brother has served you Faithfully Lord he's faithful to you Lord we're trusting your word to be faithful to him Lord be with us now each one we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Matthew chapter 7 Matthew chapter 7 amen I want to thank the church we had a moment of Correction last Sunday this morning we want a moment of congratulation amen I drove up to the to the parking lot this morning with my family and I said whoo look at all the cars we were 9 minutes early and we were the last to arrive so God bless you God bless you each one for taking that to heart amen I appreciate it I know that the song leader appreciates it I know that the song the Sunday School Superintendent appreciates it and this morning do you see the difference do you see the difference when everyone's in and they're ready and they're on time and we can just enter into worship together it makes a difference in the service so God bless you each one for doing that amen we remember Sister Becky of course is has not been feeling well she's home sick this morning brother Doug Gail also wanted to bring another prayer request my friend Roy from that that I've dealt with through work um he's come he sits at the back you remember the east Indian young man he's in India now for a couple of months with his mother she's quite sick he hasn't shared with me the details he's he's quite personal about these things but he's over there trying to deal with that so we're asking God's grace I told him I would mention it I'd be praying but I bring it to the saints that God would move there not just in her life and her body but in his as well amen we want to remember also Martha Penney brother Mark and sister Morin's daughter who is supposed to be having a baby very soon it's been a couple days now since they've induced but uh we want to just remember her and her husband Chris that all will go well she's she's not a young chicken anymore that's for sure and so we want God to just grant Grace to her and to the baby as well amen amen Matthew 7:1 15 says this beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're continuing our service or our series on the Holy Spirit and I want to take a thought again of how do I know I have received the Holy Spirit and as you can imagine by our scripture this morning we're going to be focusing on the fruit of the spirit but not so much this this morning I want to set a foundation set an example in the word and then by God's grace next Wednesday we will go into the the fruit of the spirit itself but we covered a lot of ground last service um what is the evidence of the Holy Spirit and we said that it is to receive the word amen we spoke how that he will the Holy Spirit if you've received him will lead you into all truth he'll guide you into all truth but not just for the purpose of knowledge but for the it's for the purpose of manifestation it's so that you can be the word amen and it will cause you to grow and mature in Christ and we talked about how there's a word for a young Christian there's a word for a a a middle-aged Christian and then there's a word for an experienced Christian if we could put it that way and that's not based on your age in this world but it's based on how long you've been serving Christ and we talked about how Paul said to desire Peter said to desire the sincere milk of the word if you're early in your relationship with Christ if you've just received the Holy Spirit don't try and live above your experience get the things settled in your life you know and we talked about a a Sanctified life and getting your clothes right and getting your your your friendships right and getting your job right and and getting your priorities right and then after that God starts to work then on your your attitude and your motives and your objectives and your your nature and these different things and how we look at situations and so you take the principles and you learn those as you're early in your walk and then you start to apply them and they start to have a greater and greater effect in your life until your life is now being lived by the word and it's the word that starts to produce itself through you amen amen but we want to know that the word is our foundation it is everything we build on is on the word of God we don't don't build our Christian walk on an experience we don't build our Christian walk on a church or on a camp or what we did or what we didn't do amen if our experience lines up perfectly with the word of God then what do we do we place it on the word we don't we don't we don't place our life on our experience we place our life on the word so if our experience matches up with the word then we place it on there and we can build on that because it matches up but our resting place is not in the experience our resting place is that our word our life lines up with the word of God that's what we're trusting in now Paul would talk about this in the Corinthian Church and let me say this church if we want to stay humble I suggest we read the the books of Corinthians because that was the most problematic church that Paul had and you'll see the greatest correction comes through the Corinthians because they were a young church this wasn't Paul's Church Paul's church was Ephesus but we have Corinthians amongst us we're all we all have a little bit of Corinthian in us if I could say that this morning amen we all have a little bit of the Corinthian Church inside of us and that's because we're growing we're growing we're maturing we're not at the the Apex of our of our Christian walk yet we haven't gone in a resurrection in a Rapture and so we've got all a little bit of the Corinthian Church inside of us if I can put it that way whether we want to admit it or not and Paul says this he says for other Foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ it's amazing I've said before the Catholic church so many times that that they picked Peter as The Rock on which the church is built and and Paul comes along the prophet to the age and he says you can't lay any other Foundation except one and that's Jesus Christ the Revelation that we are basing our Christian walk on is the revelation of Jesus Christ and that's what Peter got who do you say that am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God that was the rock for Peter's Foundation that was the rock that the church was built on Amen and so we've got to be built on the word of God as it comes to us listen they had a revelation of Jesus Christ in Luther's day and they had to build on that then they had a greater one in Wesley's day and then when isusa Street came the Pentecostals had even another Revelation but then Malachi 4 came and he produced the full foundation so we could produce the full pyramid of the fruits of the spirit in the nature of Jesus Christ today that's what we've got to build on Amen as it comes as the Holy Spirit takes us into it that's what we build our lives on Paul says now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay and stubble now I want you to see something here that's a that's quite a variety of materials and guess who chooses what we build there you do he didn't say if God build he says if any man build so there's a choice here the foundation is chosen for us but what's placed on that is up to us to determine amen and I want you to see here we can build the wrong thing on the right foundation amen you can do the wrong thing for the right reason you can take the word and build a kingdom for yourself build influence build money uh whatever it might be and that doesn't make it right it just means the foundation's right but you'll see people that'll use the foundation of the world to build themselves up instead of Christ up but he says you can build this out of gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble stubble is just what's left in the field after the Harvest is you don't want to build anything out of stubble there's no strength in those sorts of things Paul's saying you can build whatever you want it's up to you but here's the catch verse 13 Every Man's work shall be made manifest in other words it's going to be shown what it really is it's going to shown if it's strong enough he says for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sord it is so there's a trying and a testing and a proving time for everything that we've done in this life and this test is going to prove if it's built to stand if it has Eternal value or if it has temporal value and what's going to test it Church the word it's always judged by the word of God Amen no one escapes this testing the bride doesn't escape this testing Every Man's work is going to go through this and every professing every professing Christians as well he says now in verse 14 if any man's work abide which he had built thereupon he shall receive a reward reward so if our life's work it it can stand the test of God's word then we receive a reward now I'll tell you this I don't this is just me you can take it or leave it I don't believe that that's based on church anity that's based on Church attendance but I believe it's Souls there's only one thing that's going over there church and that's souls and so our reward is those that we have brought to a place where they recognize I am a child of God that's our reward that's waiting for us over there God is interested in Souls Above All Else he says a soul is worth 10,000 worlds that tells me what our reward is going to be I believe is that it's those that we have brought to Christ but he says if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire if you're a child of God you can't be lost that's what he's saying here you cannot be lost but your work can be for nothing you can come to a place where everything you've done is destroyed and yet your soul is still saved you can waste this life even as a child of God what a shameful place I don't want to be found at that day having wasted my life and just gotten in by the skin of my teeth by predestination anden I want to do what God wants me to do here in this life I don't want to see it all crumble and fade away as that time draws near but that means we've got to check up with the word amen but I want you I want to kind of build a picture this morning because we can look at what Paul's saying here and we can say well that's works because he says if any man's work so we can focus on the idea of Works amen but the the question is what kind of work will stand and what kind of work will fall because I want a work that stands I don't want to go through and put a bunch of effort in and then find out that I did the wrong kind of work now we're preaching this morning on how do I know I've received the Holy Spirit but I want you to see the work that the Holy Spirit does in our lives we finish with this quote last service and I want to pick it up there as we start to paint a picture this morning brother Bram said for the and the word is supposed to transform you from what the things of the world are into the image of Sons and Daughters of God then if you accept that word it'll transform you from a son of the world a daughter of the world to a son and daughter of God he says look at you and here how many have had that experience every one of us we've had that experience because it was spoken God's what the spoken word is the Original Seed the word was spoken it was believed and the word came forth and fell into the bed of the heart and there it grew right out of it he says it's transforming yourself his holy spirit transform the seed word into its likeness like if a pear tree brings forth a pear an apple tree and apple things like that his word will bring forth Sons and Daughters of God that's what it's supposed to to do so the purpose of the holy spirit is to bring life to the seed word of God in every child of God Amen and when the word comes alive it has to produce itself it has to produce itself a pear tree doesn't produce apples a pear tree produces Pairs and so if the word is inside of you and it comes alive it's got to produce the word which will produce a child of God so what does it look like let's go back to our opening scripture and I I I started a bit deeper in it but I to take it from this point this morning a few verses before where we started and Jesus said enter ye in at the Straight Gate that word straight means narrow tight for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many be there be which go therein listen The Wider the door the more people are going to walk through he says because straight is the gate and narrow this word narrow here it means conflicting pressing troublesome if you were to go into the mall and there was a tiny little door and only one person can fit through would you go there and fight with everyone to go through it or would you go to the big broad doors our tendency is to go where life is easy the path of least resistance amen but he says but straight is the gate and narrow conflicting pressing Troublesome is the way which leadth unto life and few there be to that find it so the way to eternal life is narrow it's constricting it's Troublesome it's not easy amen as we walk with God we're going to face hard times and even the entrance to that path is a difficult one because it involves personal death it involves a dying out amen we can't expect to walk into heaven a waltz into heaven perhaps would be a better word on a bed of ease and luxury and comfort and entertainment and everything perfect that's not the way that God promises it he says no it is a tight way it is a narrow way it's a walk a road a journey and it's not a walk that's easy it's not for the faint of heart but it is a path of our own choosing we have so many choices to make and we have results to match our choices and I want to take this from a from a a Viewpoint that brother Bram brings of a quote about brother brandham and lot and he puts it this way we're talking about straight As the gate now he says you see when Abraham was sitting under his tent because he had made a choice lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom and Abraham is sitting in this tent we would look at that and say who's the greater man who's made the better decisions in life he says and that choice he says be because he had made a choice and that choice is brought before every person that's born in this world the tree of Good and Evil is setting before every person and when lot his nephew and their herdsman begin to argue about the grounds Abraham being a just man said to them just let there be no arguments Among Us you you just choose your way of going that place he says comes into every believer's life and it's before you this morning and it's before me he says lot didn't think that he was going to backslide he says but he went to looking towards Sodom where things were easy notice his intention is not to walk away from God the promises of God but his choice was tied to comfort not spiritual growth and lot valued certainty over the promise of God that's what he chose there he says and there are many times we look towards the easy way I'll join the certain certain church and you see nobody will say anything against it because it's the biggest church in the city listen lot was the most spiritual man in lot in Sodom L was the greatest believer there but lot was backslid in church being better than everyone else doesn't doesn't make you right L was still in a backsliding condition even though he was there and because he knew better he was in worse condition than they were because he was where he knew better than to be amen being better doesn't make us right we've got to stay with the word that's where we know that we can be right he says it's the easy way many times we do that when we're wrong that's flat we make the wrong choice he says and Abraham the only thing he could do was take second choice and sometimes second choice is better than first if it's taken like that notice it wasn't long when lot saw the big city but he didn't see his wife turning to a pillar of salt though and he didn't see the fire burning up the city see he couldn't see what was in the future because he was so B he was so focused on what he was going to get out of the deal he says but Abraham took the way with the Lord's despised few he stayed in the deserts he said remember if you follow Christ you'll be hated by people for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions and if you come to Christ you'll not come by any church or any denomination or any Creed we're talking about straight is the way and narrow as the gate he says you'll come by the blood that's the only Avenue in and you cannot bring anyone with you he says you'll come alone and stand on your own confession and your own faith you'll not ride on in on the pastor or on your mother's faith you'll come as an individual when you come to God he says and yet many times we make these foolish choices he says you'll never leave that door the same person you come in you can't do it you've got a choice to make make it for Christ this morning they thought everything that belonged to the church would be saved Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and but few there will be that will find it he says let me warn you this morning church be careful he says these words it takes time today in our self-righteous self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy that we're living in we've got to take the time to make sure we're on the right path and if everybody else is going this path let me tell you it's wrong Christ is is not found in the mainstream never has never will be it's few there be that will find it why is it a narrow gate because it's only one GH through at a time like he said I'm not going in cuz mama's going in I'm not going in with my pastor I'm not going in because I'm attending evening Light Fellowship I'm going in because I have accepted the work of Jesus Christ at Calvary by his blood my faith is in the finished work and I go through that gate to get into him that's the only way that we can come in amen we can't say well if you go I'll go remember I I've told this before when when uh I first asked to get baptized it was because Adam was getting baptized and Matt was getting baptized and then my brother Nate was getting baptized and I said I'm going to go in too cuz I was worried people will think I was a bad kid because I wasn't going to get baptized when they were you know what my parents did they said no that's not the reason to get baptized you're not going in because they're going in you got to go in because you want to go in amen so we don't go in because other people are going in we go in because there's something inside of us that says I've got to walk through that door there's a deep that's calling to the deep and though we may not go through the first time yet we'll keep coming back to that door because there's something beyond that door that's calling to our soul amen there's something inside of us that is being pulled to that door as hard as narrow as lonely as it is there's something that keeps coming back until we come to the place where we say I'll walk my way with the Lord's despised few like that song says though none go with me still I will follow I'm going to have to leave you guys I'm going on with Christ I'm going to go through the word Jesus continues he says now here's where we started beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves so notice the contrast the outside looks the same for everyone but inside is a destructive nature and there their Gain is based on your loss if they can take it away from you then they're going to benefit amen these are not people we want to have in in in a position of Authority or influence because they'll use it for themselves but how are we going to recognize them cuz they look just like you and I they act the same way you and I do it would seem Jesus gives us the answer verse 16 he says ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Gra of thorns or figs of thistles no if you wonder what the answer is there no nobody goes to to to Thorns to find a grape vine to find grapes it's not there he says even so every good true tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit and then he he he doubles down on it he says a good tree cannot cannnot it's impossible bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit amen it's an impossibility you can't remember the scripture says you can't have both sweet and salty water out of the same Fountain it's not the way it works it's going to be one or the other and this life is the same way and people are the same way what we have to do though is give it time to see if it's good fruit or bad fruit and and we can get caught up in this idea that they'll bring forth good fruit eventually that's as may be but don't eat from the fruit until it's good I have seen people and I know people and and they they'll take somebody and the the consistent fruit out of their life is bad and yet they'll keep trusting them they'll keep following them they'll keep listening to them church we have to be gracious but we also have to be honest we have to use our discernment and if the fruit that keeps coming out is bad I'm not saying that person is a bad tree I'm saying they may not have what you think they have yet there is a change that needs to happen amen if the fruit keeps being bad there's something wrong with the tree there's a problem with the tree he says every tree that bringeth forth not bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down it's cut down and is cast Into the Fire Jesus doesn't say just keep believing he says listen it's going to come to an end if it doesn't produce good fruit there's only one thing it's good for and that's firewood now now that's not for you and I to do we don't do the cutting down and we don't do the burning we don't put people in we don't pull them in and we don't push them out that's for sure that is the work and that's the sovereignty of God that will do that amen remember what Jesus said in the parable the wheat and the and the tears he says I'll send my laborers to gather the tears to be burned and the wheat into the burn now they don't do the burning they do the Gathering and how do we gather there's only one way a laborer Gathers by the word by the word I don't have to gather you in to a barn or for burning you'll do it alone based on your response to the word of God see I'm not here remember what the Book of Revelation says near the end it says the the spirit and the bride say one thing come so you'll either come or you won't but the Gathering is based on hearing the word and if you hear the word you'll come and if you don't hear the word you'll stay out there and you're gathered you'll do your own Gathering I don't have to do anything for it amen our message is always come but we have to be frank and honest about situations remember what Paul said Paul said Mark them which cause or beware of people that cause divisions and offenses in other words he says don't give them ammunition don't feed that but then Paul would also say mark them that live the kind of life that I live see we've got to be able to be Frank and honest about where we're at in our life and our pattern is Christ and Paul said follow me as I follow Christ if you see somebody that lives a Christian Life pattern after them and if you see somebody that doesn't then for Pete's sake don't pattern after them and don't feed the dragon pick let's let's pick who we're going to copy we've got good Christian examples in this church that have lived a life that is that is reflected the life of Jesus Christ let's pick those but not one of us is perfect not a one of you is perfect we pattern after our El elders but not a one of them is perfect but we ought to take their example Jesus continues he says wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them so how do we figure out who's a wolf and who's a sheep same way we do with trees by their fruits by the product of their life if I could put it that way now watch this because it's very deceptive not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but who will he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so a declaration that I have accepted Jesus Christ is not sufficient here that's not going to get me there I can even call him my Lord but if I don't do what he tells me then he's not my Lord he is my Lord in name but he's not my Lord inde deed remember the parable of the two sons where the father said go work in the fields and he says yes I'll go do it and he goes tells the other son go work the fields he says no but he says the one that said yes didn't go do it and the one that said no repented and went and worked later and he says which one really loved the father they said the one that went and worked he said no but then he went and did it the other one had he he could he could with his mouth confess his love but his life wouldn't do it amen so the proof of his being my Lord is that I do his will not my will the proof is not that I do good things the proof is that I do what he wants me to do amen and it doesn't always look carnal when we're doing our own things when we're doing our dead works it doesn't look carnal watch what Jesus said he says many shall say to me in that day here's what they did with their life Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name is that a good thing didn't we just read a couple Services ago where Paul said I would that every one of you prophesy more than speaking in tongues I want you to prophesy the greatest gift in the church would be prophecy because that's thus sayeth the Lord and they'll come in that day and they'll say didn't we bring a genuine thus sayeth the Lord and in thy name have cast out Devils well hallelujah what a work to cast out Devils to free somebody from the Dominion of Satan and in thy name done many wonderful works but as we've said before you can stick Judas in this group you can stick Caiaphas in this group that prophesied you can stick balam in this group that prophesied and yet they were not sons of God Amen they are out of God's Will and yet they have signs and wonders following they have good works they have all sorts of the supernatural showing in their life and they think they've done a lot for the kingdom of God but remember what I think ought to be done is not what he thinks cuz his ways are higher than my ways and his thoughts are higher than my thoughts and so they come and they've used what they have in a way that they think best but Christ is sitting there saying you didn't come talk to me about it you did what you wanted to do do doing wonderful Works does not make them good he says and then will I profess to them this is Christ's response I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity these were people that knew to do something and they didn't do it and they elected to do a different work with their life they built on the foundation but they built something of their own making and we find that their foundation's not even right as we come down to in a second what did they do Church they turn down the word and the next verse confirms it he says therefore whosoever heareth these says of mine whoever hears the word and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock as we said before Peter's not the rock Peter fell Peter made mistakes even after his conversion Peter's not it Jesus said if you hear and do what I tell you that's the rock that's the revelation of Jesus Christ not on a fallen man so whoever hears these sayings is is like a wise man who built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not it was founded for it was founded upon a Rock Church you'll notice as we go through these scriptures the difference between a Believer and unbeliever is not the storms being a child of God does not exclude us from Hard Times from storms of life from circumstances that are uncomfortable but what is different is how we come through those storms because they come through this storm a wise man that's founded on the revelation of Jesus Christ the word comes through the storm and nothing has happened to him the storm has had no effect the house is still strong but watch this and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not what's the difference between a child of God and a child of Darkness child of God will do the work he'll live by by the word he says whoever does him not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand now the sand is far more beautiful than the rock can you imagine building your house on a beautiful beach in Hawaii right down by the water you could build it so that at high tide it comes just a foot away from the house and you get up in the morning and the sun is shining the sun is rising and you step out with your cup of whatever hot beverage you prefer and you step out into the sand and the warm water it's a way better place to build than a rock visually it's a lot more satisfaction to building on the beach but he says then the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it Church you can't have a great fall if you didn't have a great building it's a big thing when these things fall these will be great Ministries outwardly speaking with signs and wonders and gifts of the Spirit but they will fall because they did not build on the correct Revelation they did not build on the word of Jesus Christ how many times have we seen people like this people with great enthusiasm people with great gifts great Ministries great knowledge even we would say great Revelation And yet when times come situations come storms rise in life what happens is they crash and they burn and you say where did that come from that man's been pastoring for 20 and 30 years and now he's gone where what what was he living for where was his experience how did it fall away so quickly and what do they do they step away from this path of Holiness and righteousness and they go back to what they came out of so long ago or else they go and wander in a Barren desert because they can't go fully back cuz they know too much but they're in a religious limbo because they can't stay where they were and so they wander around now in their Newfound freedom but they have no home because nobody's like them it's amazing that people that have left this message they know so much that they can't go back to denomination but they've Fallen they've fallen and so they're left in a place where what do they do they dabble in their freedom and they of all men most miserable they have nowhere that they fit great is the fall of their house the scripture says ministers song leaders deacons and their wives and children along with them people that gave Decades of their life to the gospel only to fall away why they didn't build on a right foundation that's it they built you can't say they didn't build Church they built they were faithful in their building but they built on the wrong thing and can I say it this way they were built on the revelation of a man not on the revelation of the son of man they were built on the revelation of a prophet of their pastor of a perfection that did not exist except in Christ and when men failed when this message failed according to them whatever it might be they fell with it because they weren't built on the strong Foundation they weren't built on a rock and everything came tumbling down around them people that were built on this idea that if you know the truth you're a Believer but remember it says the truth will set you free you shall know the truth and they said I know the truth but the truth has to set you free I remember a lady that walked away and she said all my life I've wanted a tattoo on my ankle she hadn't been set free and she'd harbored that all of her life and hid it while she was allegedly serving the lord all she wanted was a butterfly tattoo on her ankle what a horrible place to be sister Moren would you like a butterfly tattoo on your ankle have you been hiding something from us this morning she's back there laughing at me that's why I'm picking on her can you imagine why she hadn't experienced the freedom of the word she hadn't had her nature changed and she was miserable the whole time because why her house was not built on a foundation that wouldn't move we read this scripture last service actually that I'm about to read in Hebrews 6 but I'm going to read the part that I skipped over because the part I skipped over was for this service not for last service so it's where it belongs this morning I believe remember he read this he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection onto maturity we read that last last service where we said when you've when you've established the principles of the word when you've done what the word tells you to do now it's time to go into maturity it's not Doctrine now it's manifestation amen it's to become an adult in Christ not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards God the doctrine of baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit but he says this this is what we skipped he says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened once enlightened they're not now but they were and have tasted of the Heavenly gift they got a sampler but they didn't get the full meal and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come so they they've tasted Ted they've tried they've been a part of it but they aren't it it's external to them but they have an experience with just about everything that God has to offer if we could put it that way this morning they know what it's like to be in good meetings anointed preaching tremendous works of the spirit healing signs wonders tongues whatever you pick your your your whatever you want to say this morning amen they are witnesses of just about everything that God has to offer in terms of the feel and the emotion and the hearing and all of these different things he says it's impossible if they shall fall away to renew themselves again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame there's got to be somebody to fulfill this scripture church that's the sad part of it there's got to be somebody to fulfill it and who are these people he's not talking about Sons and Daughters of God these are not children of God Amen when youve received re the Holy Spirit you're you're sealed to the day of your Redemption you cannot be lost but he's saying these people can be lost amen the holy spirit is our token it's our proof that we pass from Death unto life the prophet of God would talk about these people and he says they are caral believers who go through the form of reformation the form not the process they don't actually receive the holy spirit in another place he calls them borderline Believers so they go through all all the doctrines they go through all the principles they know it they understand it but yet they haven't received it amen so they're doing everything they can to be a Christian but they're not they're doing everything they're they're doing everything by the book and in the end he says they've got to walk away because they haven't been sealed they haven't truly received him watch how this comes Now watch how deceiving it is brother Garfield did a study on Deception that that I referenced last service and the deception we face today is the anointing of the spirit on a person but Christ is not in the person remember in leoda they have everything were riched increased with Goods have need of nothing they have every gift every manifestation everything look at look at when they uh El Eleazar went to to get a bride for Isaac what did he come with he came with a message an invitation he came with gifts and he came with a means to get her back to Isaac but if she never went back to Isaac she could never produce the promise but she could have every gift of Isaac without having met Isaac and it's the same thing today you can have every aspect of Christ except Christ every benefit Every Blessing every gift you name it it's possible to have that but yet in in Revelations 3 it says he is outside the church knocking they have everything except him and he's knocking to come back into the church amen every feeling every every every aspect that he could offer except himself so that can include a Sanctified life that can include good preaching hey I've heard some of these Pentecostal Brothers preach they can preach absolutely but what is it their soul is still governed by self-will that's what a wolf is it's governed by self-will they have not surrendered to the word of God which is his will and therefore they are LED of their own desires and their own Wills amen that's who Jesus was talking about in earlier scriptures he says but watch this he says for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh down of upon it and brings forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God so rain is sent specifically for the good things so we plant vegetables we plant fruit trees we we plant Gardens we plant wheat and grains and these different things the rain is meant to produce that which helps us sustain our life and so he says the rain comes down and all of those good things they take it and they produce themselves but verse eight that which Bears thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh un cursing whose end is to be burned that same rain falls on the thorns and the Briars the exact same rain Church there is no difference there's no difference in the word or the anointing in the reality God doesn't just send his son on good people we all get the sun we don't get it much in Newan land but we get it and guess what it doesn't matter if you're a good person bad person good farmer bad farmer the Sun comes the rain definitely comes and it's it's indiscriminate amen but what they produce under that same benefit of God is thorns and briers why cuz they're thorns and Briars you can't be what you're not amen they can't help it the rain brings out what they are and that is that their end purpose is to be destroyed by fire now let's go back to Jesus I'm taking my time this morning to set a foundation really for Wednesday but I want you to understand from the scripture that being under the hearing of the word of God does not make you a Christian going to church doesn't make you a Christian being a good person doesn't make you a Christian it's Christ in you that makes you a Christian and there nothing else will do it amen you've got to have his spirit inside of you not just around you or near you or even working with you it has to be inside of you it has to seal you amen that's what the new birth is Jesus says this Matthew 5 but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you we're going to get real Down to Earth this morning this is pastoral preaching this is Jesus love your enem enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you usually when we pray for those that despitefully use us it's Lord Smite them let's be honest sometimes we're more like David but we're supposed to be the bride mercy and Grace he says that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the east evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and the unjust so God doesn't hold his His blessings back from bad people it's still it's still available if I could put it that way you can come into this church and never accept it and still receive many blessings from being here listen sitting under the preaching of the word and doing the basics will make you a better citizen it'll give you a better family it'll give you a better marriage there are all sorts of blessings here your kids will be better for having gone to church 100% but that's not Christ that's just the sun and the rain amen remember what Paul said these were people that were once enlightened they were sitting in the light of God's word they tasted of the Heavenly gift they were partakers of the Holy Ghost they had felt the presence of the Holy Spirit they had seen his work in their midst and they tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come these things were genuine Church they were sitting under the real rain they were sitting under the the real son amen it was God doing something but the problem is that they weren't wheat they were briers and Thorns they weren't children of God Amen and so though they could experience the pleasure and the benefits of God in their flesh and even in their Spirit their soul could never receive it and they could never get the new birth of a total change they could never surrender full control because they weren't a child of God he says so you see the same rain that makes the weak grow makes a cockle Burg grow and therefore I got the picture there's your carnal Confessor that's right in the church he might shout jump she let's be Equitable this morning she or he could jout shout jump dance speak with tongues but his fruits he's a Cocker and there's the other one they've got the same Spirit the Holy Spirit can drop right in a bunch of people and a hypocrite can Shout by the Holy Spirit just the same as a cockle Burg can live by the rain that sent that's what Paul's speaking of here but it's impossible for a cockle bur to become a wheat or a weat a Cocker he says it depends on what seed is sewed in your heart if you come to church just because you're afraid of hell if you join church because you don't want to go to hell you're still a cockle bur if you join church just to be popular you're still a cockle bur if you did all these formal things that's to be done and that's all you have he says you're still a Cocker there are formal things we need to do you need to repent you need to be baptized properly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen those are good we do them because the word tells us to but they are leading us to the New Birth they are not the new birth itself amen the new birth is when you receive Christ personally not just accept his work at Calvary accept him because he's savior but you need him as Lord Lord and that's where most people Falls they accept him as Savior but he doesn't come in as Lord why because I can't live this life if he's not living it through me it's the only way I'm going to do it and so that new birth takes us from acting like a Christian to being a Christian you don't have to act anymore we can live out the word of God by the spirit he says now catch this as we at the end here he says but a real genuine Christian presses towards perfection presses towards maturity that word Perfection is scary our Perfection is never sinless perfection in this flesh don't ever try for it don't ever think you're going to achieve it I don't care who says it we have no sinless Perfection Christ is our sinless Perfection that's why we needed him is because this can never do it but we're going to cover a bigger a bigger question on that in a later service but he says the real genuine Christian presses towards perfection until the world is dead and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus he says then it's impossible for that man to ever fall Hallelujah if God fills you with the Holy Spirit you can never fall in God's eyes listen this flesh will fail this flesh will fail every single day amen we're going to answer that question can you have the Holy Ghost in sin I'll tell you the answer is you can't sin but you can fail absolutely amen but what happens is God doesn't give you the Holy Spirit and then take it away but you can lose the feeling of it you can lose the joy of it you can use this lose the satisfaction the contentment the rest absolutely but your soul is sealed but you can't lose him amen why because our feelings are subject to so many influences if you're a woman your hormones alone what a battle you face sisters and then we have the emotions from work and we have the emotions from inter actions with people and we have the highs and lows of our finances and our health and all these different things that are playing in amen we can lose the feeling of the Holy Spirit but we can't lose the Holy Spirit if we've been sealed let's let the word speak to us again I hope you're with me because this should be a comfort this morning this should be a comfort that we've been sealed brother Braham says this he says I don't act clean and pure and holy to make myself a Christian but Christ in me lives that in me and I love him and if I do anything wrong it condemns me right there I'll say God forgive me now catch this every day I've got to ask forgiveness every day and you do too he says certainly you do now watch Paul's words as we're we're at the last third of this service this morning Paul says this in Ephesians 4 and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let me ask you a question this morning can a True Believer grieve the Holy Spirit absolutely absolutely we can not in a way that takes him out of your soul but in a way that takes his effect out of your life absolutely we can see the distinction because brother R says we make choices every day and we fail every day amen and what we choose whether it's to stay with the word or go with what somebody or something else says or influences us to do if we listen to the word or if we'll listen to our emotions or our flesh or our boss our employer whatever it might be if we make the wrong choice the Holy Spirit doesn't leave our soul it doesn't leave it the soul is sealed as we just read but now we're influenced by something else and so the effect of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives is gone out and now we're acting on our own so guess what when I lose his effect guess who loses power me because now I'm left with what I can bring to the table which is nothing my power is not effective in my Christian walk amen now I'm walking I don't have support I don't have encouragement I don't have strength I don't have Direction because it's got to come from me and that's going to fail real quick amen we have no power without the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen so when we grieve the Holy Spirit what do we lose we lose the feeling and the effect of his presence that's it amen that awareness of the anointing on you I if you're a Christian I believe you felt this by this time you can there there are times where you can feel his presence it is not always there at least it's not for me maybe somebody's there I don't always feel his presence but I know he's with me but but the feeling the sensing of his presence is what you lose when you grieving amen and with that go all the benefits of that feeling if I could put it that way all right that can fall away the feeling of his presence can fall away church and if you feel it that doesn't make you more saved and if you don't feel it that doesn't make you unsaved it has nothing to do with your salvation amen but what we do when we grieve him is we get cold let me put it this way we lose our heat you might be hot but you'll go to lukewarm you might still be better than 99% of the world but you're not where you ought to be and from there comes formality comes starchiness critical Spirits dismissive attitudes I speak by experience right when we let something come between us and his Fellowship all we're left with catch this is our own fellowship and guess what I'm a miserable cuz this self Rises up and that's never going to be a good thing when the only person I can fellowship with is me I'm of all men most miserable let me put it that way and you will be too if you come into my presence that way it takes Christ to make me worth being around think of even the gifts of the Holy Spirit the gifts of the holy spirit are meant for him to anoint us to do or say something you can have that gift without the Holy Spirit and it can operate by your will but when it operates by your will what happens Church it'll fail it'll fail because it's meant to be used by him not by us a gifted preacher a man that's got a gift to preach the word of God can come here this morning and he can preach a sermon and you know what it'll do if he's not anointed nothing oh it'll stimulate us intellectually it may make us shout but it won't have an eternal effect because the holy spirit's not in it if I'm not anointed this morning my words will fall right over this pulpit and go right there even if I have a gift he's got to be in it so the question is Brother John how do we grieve the Holy Spirit does anybody here want to grieve the Holy Spirit no so how do we not grieve it and how do we grieve it watch Paul's focus on this this is real living now we're getting down to the meat of this I'm a practical preacher and I love how Paul can take the greatest of mysteries and then he can come right down and he can put a finger right on my life and bring it down to where we live so we can look at the word and say am I there or am I not there how do we grieve the Holy Spirit we grieve it by succumbing to our nature our fleshly carnal nature rather than the spirit of Christ see when you really get down to it we backslide because we let something get between us and the word that's what it is and Satan then does a wonderful job of stirring up our flesh in our emotions to react to situations and circumstances and that's where we start to grieve the Holy Spirit watch what Paul says we're in Ephesians 4 now I'm taking this out of the Amplified just so we can really hit the mark this morning Paul says he says grieve not the Holy Spirit to do that we've got to get rid of some things he says let all bitter bitterness and indignation and wrath passion rage and bad temper we don't we don't we don't have that here this morning sister Priscilla and sister Leah both grinned you've been caught no surely surely not but do you have any of this in your house brother Bob no no it's a trick question resentment anger and animosity and quarreling we've got this in our house brawling absolutely you got boys you got this clamor contention and slander evil speaking abusive or Blasphemous language be banished from you along with or with all malice spite ill will or baseness of any kind oh my this is what Grieves the Holy Spirit and he says so get rid of all of this but you can't just get rid of things you got to bring something in behind it you got to fill the Gap you got to fill the void he says and become useful and helpful and kind to one another tenderhearted compassionate understanding oh I love this lovingheart God help us to be lovingheart forgiving one another readily and freely as God in Christ forgave you see we can focus so much on a Sanctified life to keep from grieving the Holy Spirit right and we should scripture says be ye holy for I am Holy I'm not saying don't do that but we ought to keep our life clean but we can live the cleanest of lives by the dos and don'ts if I could put it that way this morning and still grieve the Holy Spirit are you with me this morning Paul preached plenty about living a life that's pleasing to Christ in terms of our works and what we allow in our life but now he's coming to how we act our attitudes actions and reactions conversations suppressing the fleshly feelings so that Christ can come through brother brah says it this way he says we are not of this World Church that means we live by a different set of rules a different set uh principles of morals we're motivated differently we have different values and standards our life is different in every way cuz we're not out of this world we are different from the world we live a different life a separated life we're never to live the life of the world and be a Christian we're to live an outstanding life a different life not in such social ranks he says but I mean we are to live a life of genuine Holiness can we say Amen but what's the purpose purpose that the fruits of the spirit might be seen in US of meekness and gentleness and patience longsuffering Faith the fruits of the spirit so what's the the purpose of a life of Holiness is to contribute to the growth of the fruits of the spirit in our life it's to keep from hindering our spiritual growth and also getting us to a place where we can help others in their spiritual growth it's to keep us in the right attitude the right mindset so that the spirit of Christ can flow through us and make us a help a hindrance to the kingdom of God so when we when it comes to grieving the spirit what does Paul focus on he talks about our emotions he talks about our actions our reactions he talks about our conversations our offenses our hurts where we rub shoulders with whom right here this is where it matters this is the body of Christ amen Paul's saying don't let your interactions with each other grieve the Holy Spirit don't rest in the fact that we live a clean life if what follows that life is arguments and bitterness and resentment amen God's wanting a bride that has his nature not just his outward appearance cuz remember our outward appearance he says in Revelations 3 he says that take take on a what take on a white robe of his righteousness our appearance is in his righteousness not our own but the nature inside is supposed to be that of Christ Paul's saying your nature needs to line up with his and really yours needs to go away so that he can have the preeminence he says you ought to be the best of the best when it comes to dealing with each other with each other amen listen to this Ram says the other night when I was coming over here a few nights ago the Lord met me in the room there just a vision the same as I see here at the platform and said here's what's the matter with the church they've got so much selfishness everywhere he didn't just say this he says now who's he talking about the Church of the Living God he's not talking about make Believers he's not talking about denominations he's saying True Believers the Church of the Living God has got so many differences and so much this and that till they grieve the holy spirit away from them and that's just exactly what it is how do we fix it brother and brother and sister until we humble ourselves and become the lamb what's the nature of a lamb sacrificial lays down its life so the dove can light on us again and bring joy and peace and satisfaction and a burning desire in our hearts to see others saved and come to God we are simply fighting the winds what's he saying he's saying you've lost the joy the peace the satisfaction and a burning desire in your heart to see others saved because you've gotten selfish this flesh is very very selfish and that's what gets us in trouble it's unconverted it's unchanged it's unregenerated he says if you don't humble if we don't don't humble ourselves and become the lamb we are simply fighting the winds anybody ever tried to fight the winds does the wind care if you fight it or not we get up there would you say brother John you sure showed the wind there he'll never touch you again the wind doesn't care what I do when I move my hand it just comes right in and it Blends right back to where it was the air doesn't care what I do it just flows right back you can't beat the Wind Church he's saying all we're doing if we don't do this is we're fighting a battle we cannot win he says don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad everyone ever treats you or anything don't ever don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it'll grieve the holy spirit away from you it certainly will remember what brother Bram says you can't stop the birds from flying over you but you can stop them from building a nest amen when somebody's done me wrong when somebody's done you wrong you know how you get over what they've done wrong start thinking about what they did right and me I can look at every single person in this church and they've done wonderful things for me and I'm thankful for it so the minute that sister Lydia does something she shouldn't do to me you know what I'm going to think about all the time she's come up here and she's played faithfully and she's sat there faithfully and taking notes in the service Faithfully how she's played with the kids how she's been kind to the children not that she didn't shake my hand after service like she didn't on Wednesday I don't know if she did or not I go around and shake hands so if we missed it's my fault but my point is I can choose to remember what sister Lydia doesn't have or I can choose to remember what sister Lydia ads amen remember what Paul said whatsoever things are pure honest of a good report I want to think the best about sister Lydia because sister Lydia is a part of this body I hope you don't mind me picking on you this morning sister Lydia but you're sitting there so calmly and quietly I figure you're okay with it and you haven't started blushing yet so what do we do we want to focus on what is good because we're here for what we have not for what we don't you add nothing to the body with what you don't don't have so that means you're not here for what you don't have you're here for what you do have and I'm going to focus on what you've got rather than what you don't got whether you like it or not amen but you know what there's nobody can hurt you like another believer there's nobody can hurt us like another believer why because we've got expectations we've got expectations for how they'll Act how they'll talk how they'll support how they'll encourage and when they fail and we do it hurts us it hurts us amen and we all have our areas of weakness and Satan knows how to push those buttons Satan is a master of psychology he knows how to push our buttons amen and so he tries to orchestrate situations where your buttons are getting p push push push push push all day every day to get us in a tizzy amen you know how he does it he points out brother Bob's mistakes instead of my mistakes right that's what he does he gets me to look at him instead of me I'm going to lose the front row here pretty quick if I keep choosing the ones in the front I see sister Mor and brother Mark mov back they knew what was coming see I could take that as an insult sure I could you say brother John that to be childish Church get me in my flesh and I can match anybody for childishness and so can you amen I'm with you this morning this is not a preaching to you this is a preaching to us this is rubber meets the road Christianity this morning amen if God showing it ain't God that shows me brother Bob's problems except as a matter of prayer that's it that's it and if it's a big enough problem I'm going to go to brother Bob and say brother Bob you've got a problem and I'm telling you as a brother you've got a problem not cuz it affects me cuz it affects him I'm there to help him not to help me that's what the spirit of God does is it will help the other person the gift is for him not for me so if I go in selfishness to correct brother Bob you know what's going to happen nothing maybe his Christianity will help him to accept it but it's not God in it it's me in it it's me trying to do it the only person that can change in any situation is me I can't rely on you or you the entire group from left to right I can't rely on you to change because I don't even know if I'm right in the situation I don't even know if I've got the situation figured out if I'm entwined in it then I've got I've got a stake in it how do I know my vision's clear but what I've got to be able to do is go to the word and say Lord will you show me what I need to do because if I'm dealing with bitterness if I'm dealing with anger if I'm dealing with resentment if I'm dealing with a dislike toward my brother and sister that problem is mine not theirs it's mine to deal with amen so it's the word that can show me those things it's the word that can discern those things and it takes humility to back up and say Lord I'm not going to worry about what brother Bob did to me Lord what did I do how did I contribute and Lord if you'll talk to me if you'll show me my part by God's grace I'll try and change by Your Word by your spirit and here's the thing this is again I speak from experience I notice Trends and if I've got the same Trend guess who the common denominator is in every situation it's me I was talking to a man a while back been through three marriages I said are you going to get married again he said no I said why not he says I've realized that all of my marriages have failed he says and the common denominator is me that takes humility he's saying I ain't no good at marriage so I'm not going to put another woman in that position thank God but if we keep walking into the same issue the common denominator is me not the other people if I keep losing my job Church the problem's not the jobs the problem's me if I keep leaving churches the problem is not the churches the problem's me if I keep leaving marriages the problem's not the marriage the women in the marriage the problem is me that's where we've got to be able to see ourselves amen God needs to change me not the situation if he can change me then whether he changes it or not I'll be okay moving forward the moment we genuinely think I said this before CET trait we think we're right all the time yeah some of you may not have that cetes we have to deal with thinking we're right all the time and the minute I think that I've lost my humility and I'm on a path of getting knocked down because Pride go for Before Destruction and a hotty spirit before a fall I'm on the way down if I think you're the only one that needs to change two quotes as we close but B says now don't fuss I wrote in my notes if all you can do is fuss walk away why CU it's the flesh that's fussing it's the flesh that needs time to settle down and it's not immature to say I need to settle down before I move forward with this I've been in situations where if I had tried to press forward in the matter in the moment I'd have killed that person not literally but I'd have spoken out of turn I'd have expressed anger that shouldn't be expressed I'd have said things that should never have been said and so I've got to be able to back away and settle down and say I'm going to let this have a little bit of time to cool off why so the spirit of God can come out because we've all got flesh we've all got emotions amen remember I've said before don't spank your kids when you're angry why the purpose of a spanking is not to express anger it's to teach it's to show a consequence and if you add your anger to it you reduce the teaching to one of Retribution and revenge even don't do it in Anger likewise don't deal with your brother and sisters in Anger let the flesh get settled down so that the spirit of God can come out he says don't fuss temper breeds temper first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you and you'll be fussing back listen if somebody's fussing with me I've got to be able to say listen I don't think we're getting anywhere with this let's walk away and come back in a day or two we're allowed to do that but he says if you first thing you know you'll be fussing back see what happens is we take our license to act out because they're acting out well he got angry so I can get angry well she told on me so I'm going to tell on her well they didn't do this so I don't do that and what we're doing is we're reflecting the person rather than reflecting the word and that's not going to get anybody anywhere we think that two wrongs will make it right I'm allowed to be as childish as they are that's not the way it works if they don't apologize then we shouldn't have to apologize no that's not the way a Christian acts like I said I I I I didn't share the details but my son got scammed on a part off Facebook and my flesh went there and I'd figured out how to get let make that man lose his job and everything I'd figured it out but I didn't do it but what was it the flesh rose up the flesh rose up because I want Justice I want a man to act like a man rather than act like a child and he wouldn't do it what I had to do humble myself and say Lord that's that's the flesh that ain't me that ain't what I want to be and lay it down and walk away into God's grace I've never had an issue with it since but I had to let the flesh settle down he says then the Holy Spirit takes its flight temper breeds temper but he comes back with and love breeds love be full of love Jesus said by this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another that's the fruit of the holy spirit is love he says and did you know you're a little Creator yourself certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around we do don't we he says just that loving type of person just as kind you like to be around them how do they do it why are they like this they create that atmosphere oh you say they got a special gift he says by the life they live you need to live the right kind of Life by the way they talk uhoh how great a fire the tongue kindleth we'd all be better off without tongues fact Checkers right they create that atmosphere three ways the way they live sorry two the way they talk he says their conversation the more you talk about bad things the more those bad bad things will affect your life if you're dwelling on negativity Your Atmosphere will be negative if you're dwelling on positivity which is the word guess what you'll have a positive attitude not talking psychology here but there is a certain element of psychology listen if we're facing Str struggles and trials and tribulations and all we talk about is those things whoever got better talking about how bad things are going to get we don't that's psychology it we're never going to walk away feeling better because we talked about how bad things are going to be they create that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation he says then you've seen those that every time you shun them all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk talk about this man you just hate to get around them see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere now here he comes down we're going to walk away from the church this morning with this on our minds and the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about create un atmosphere amen God bless you let's stand together if we would this morning like I said we wanted to go into the fruits of the spirit but I had this kind of set up in my notes already and it kind of produces where we're going to go now cuz I want the fruit of the spirit I want love joy and peace and patience and kindness and these different things amen but he says listen you've got to set an atmosphere the things you think on the things you do your actions the things you talk about create an atmosphere you talk about the word you'll get a word result you talk about things that are bad you'll get a bad result and it'll Cloud your mind and it'll Cloud Your Atmosphere it'll cloud cloud your attitude and pretty soon nobody's going to want to be around me if all I talk about is a bad things listen Monday could be a real bad day for Canada economically who cares it's all going to burn it's all going to go I got a body change waiting I got a Rapture to make I got work to do this kind of work man we got to get out of here and let me tell you unless it gets hard we're probably not going to want to get out nearly so much things are going to come but I'm not going to dwell on it I'm going to dwell on that being a sign of the positive that's coming amen that as you see these things look up your Redemption draws nigh I'll focus on the Redemption not on the fact that it's going to hell in a hand basket we can do that same thing in amongst ourselves whether it's within the body outside of the body don't focus on what is not focus on what is by the word focus on the Promises listen when Abraham made his choice with lot what he chose did not look good compared to lot but his had a promise attached to it and he got his promise and lot lost his wife had an incestuous relationship with his daughters as a drunk he didn't see that coming but he chose that which had no promise attached we walk a narrow road a tight Road a pressing road but it's got a promise along it and it's got a promise at the end of it amen and that's what we want to dwell on as Believers amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord the last words I see on the notes before me say don't fuss Lord I pray you help me not to fuss not to pick pull poke chew things over and over lord God lord I pray you help me to take your word help us each one to dwell on those things which are good and right and pure and of a good report Lord to dwell on those things which have promise to dwell on those things which have healing Deliverance strength encouragement Lord and yes the correction that we need as well Lord I pray you help us to set a right atmosphere Lord your Prophet said the right attitude towards any promise of God can bring it to pass in your life Lord we need your promised word every single bit of it this morning Lord God help us to set the right atmosphere I pray Lord not looking to the others looking in your word let that be our yay and amen Lord give us patience one for another Lord we're all growing some are ahead of us some of us are behind Lord but give us patience one for another let us recognize each as a part of the body they have their place they have their purpose they have their value Lord and let us focus on that or for Jesus said by this shall all men know you're my disciples that you have love love one for another help us to love Lord unconditionally graciously mercifully Lord with a loving heart we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen I know I sing it a lot but pour your spirit out on me 12:21 Lord I Seek You help me find you how I need your touch find my dry end broken places
