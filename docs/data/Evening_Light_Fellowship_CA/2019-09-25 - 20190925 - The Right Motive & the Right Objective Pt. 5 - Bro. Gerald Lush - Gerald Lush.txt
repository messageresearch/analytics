[Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey man praise the Lord I trust it's a Amen to us a man that we believe it that we song the truth a man we did sing a lie we song the truth a man it's a confession of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ a man to God be the glory a man and invite us to be conscious of something that's going on right now and will take place in Israel a man the prophet of God preached the message in 1964 entitled the Feast of the trumpets a man and he said it's the seventh seal to the Gentile bride he said the seventh trumpet is to Israel what significance does a tell well there are some Christian Jews in Israel and they will be observing the Feast of Trumpets this this weekend a man on Sunday and the and they're going to is going to be like a prayer meeting but it's I understand it's going to be public a man and they're going to get together for the Feast of Trumpets and for the for praying for the seed of God around the world amen and it's they say the Messiah of Israel ministries will gather with others from all nations and we'll have a feast of trumpets for you in Jerusalem and it says beginning at 7 a.m. on to 4 p.m. Israel time a man on the 29th of September so brother we thank God for what he's done for us but it's the confirmation that God is moving and God is God is doing something in Israel and we know the problem of God warned us that God is going to move from the Gentiles back to the Jews a man and I believe we've come to that time and we've come to that prophecy brother sister we've seen it and we see it everywhere now man and and there's just less and less and less happening in among the Gentiles but there's there's there's a moving of the Spirit of God among the Jews a man that the Gentiles are having less and less experiences with God but the Jews are having more experiences with God because I've already told you about those that have gone beyond the curtain of time a man truth gone beyond the curtain of time and come back and they've told what they seen and not only that in just a little while ago maybe a couple years ago there they go to the I think it was the tomb of Elijah in Israel and there this particular time they had a rabbi there in a wheelchair and he was a very old man and they they wheeled him up pushed him up toward the tour to the tomb of Elijah a man and he reached out and he touched the tomb of Elijah and he prophesied a man he did there and he had never done it before but the anointing had struck him and has struck the others everybody was absolutely amazed and and in a sense of a fear of God a man because it was it was so sobering and any any smoke in the name of the Lord a man to warn the people concerning what God was going to do in Israel and I don't I don't I don't doubt but for a moment now that that may be the rabbi might be gone on himself a man to his reward a man but goddess goddess left left them without a not without a witness a man that he what he's doing in Israel a man so brother I tell you this if all what we have seen in the Gentile world is causing us to look up what he's doing in Israel ought to cause us to look up a man because I tell you if they're that close to receiving the anointing of the prophet Elijah and the prophet Moses and the witness of the prophet Elijah and the prophet Moses brother how close are we to the rapture of course are we to their to the Gentile resurrection of the Bride of Christ a man so it is more serious than we think and it and it is alternatives later than what we think a man it is much later so brother-sister let let's not let's not wait for this to happen that to happen it be too late but it definitely too late but let's believe it's what God has done let's believe that the prophecy is being fulfilled regarding what God has promised in these last days for the trilogy juice a man Revelation chapter 11 a man is is concerns llege in the juice revelation 10 in the OVA the seven seals as the gentiles but the sounding of the seven trumpets is the juice a man and it says that the Feast of Trumpets begins September the 29th at sundown Amen so brother the fact that they had they haven't highlighted this in in other years but just now this year their eye lighting it a man so I believe that it's it's it's significant and brother it's only the elect is going to recognize what God has done and the elect are gonna recognize what God is doing a man so brother let's be on our guard and let's be on our toes that were there brother were not going to miss the significance of the seals father praying grace that the Jews are not going to miss the significance of the Feast of Trumpets a man so the grace of God to us and the grace of God to Israel the grace of God to the 144,000 a man who God is going to call out during the Great Tribulation some brother if the Great Tribulation is that close how close is the resurrection how close is the rapture a man we better focus on that we better get out of here a man no wonder the prophet of God said that God is waiting on us a man there wondering maybe in Israel why this and why that and why something else but then there's a generation that does know God is waiting on the Gentile bright a man we're waiting on God we're not waiting on God to do this this is this because that'll be too late if we're we're here when he does that for the Jews but brother no doubt there might be somebody in Israel is waiting for God to finish with the Gentiles a man because this right area in the the word in the Old Testament where God promised to call out of the Gentiles a people for his name a man a bride for his name to provoke Israel to jealousy a man who I believe Israel is coming to that so brother listen there there there's confusion politically but God is straightening everything out spiritually a man and it's going to be according to his word according to the prophecy oh yeah we don't know what's going to happen politically because we know right now there there's a contention between the two the two that are that are that got a lot of votes but the one is one is opposing the other they're trying to get together they're trying to make an agreement that maybe they should we should form the government but there still haven't reached that agreement a man but we know that God is doing something spiritually praise the name of the Lord there's confusion politically but I tell you this God is sending everything in order spiritually he did it for us through the old me list of the of the fields he said it for us through the revealing of his word a man revelation 10 and he's doing it for the Gentiles the sounding of the seven trumpets a man so the grace of God to Israel a man from being prayer a man for the hundred and forty-four thousand the grace of God to the to the prophet Elijah and a blabbity Moses and the prophet of God said it could be those two prophets themselves coming back or he said it could be two men with their spirit now the proud of God did wanted well for a while he thought maybe that that God would use him to do that and he would go back go to the Jews but you know the the the story about the Prophet was landed in a certain place and he thought about changing his flight and going to Israel but the Lord called him aside and says no you stay out of Israel and he said because why because they're only going to relieve and receive and listen to a Jewish prophet a man and so the prophet of God wouldn't got back on his plate and went on to where he was going somewhere else a man so God had given him a revelation there so I pray God is giving us the revelation we need now a man and I know that there are Christians that go to Israel and and they think God is going to use them for this and use them for that and there are believed message believers and there are message preachers that that have ministered in Israel and I've seen them and they they have been at a church they started a church in Israel brothers sister that's contrary to the Word of God that is not God a man because they're only going to believe they're Jewish prophets a man he wouldn't let the Prophet go there so he's not going to let us go and minister to the Jews you're gonna live your life but when I when it comes through in in Israel but we're not ordained to go in and witness to the Jews because certainly Jesus witness witness witness no brother they got they got two prophets ordained to come and give them the revelation of the Messiah that they need a man so I pray God that we've received the revelation of the Messiah that we need a man and it is the water it is our is invisible union of the Gentile bride with with the heavenly bridegroom our Lord Jesus Christ amen God Elvis to believe it God Elvis in to see it you know what God is doing a man not what God has done what's God doing in your life hey man what's God doing in our life what's God doing in this church a man it is the you know it is the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride the Gentile bride by the grace of God amen were entered into a witness with our Lord Jesus Christ and that wellness is bringing the rid of the rug the revelation and the faith of the Resurrection and the faith of the rapture do we want to get out of here a man by the grace of God it's time to go amen but by the grace of God a man we're going to claim the promise amen so the God God's grace to us a man just and just so he going to the word before we going to the word to thank you for your prayers while myself and sister Betty was traveling to the barren Peninsula and again you know it sure certainly proves that uh as I have explained to a gentleman one time concerning it and I said a pastor I said it's not eight to four nine to five not by any means I said it's 24/7 I said because no matter what the hour what the time I said he's there I said ready to to answer ready to do this ready to do that a man and so he can be called on any time and and you I felt that as it were when we were fellowship me with different ones in our trip and the pool was their spiritual a man and the pastor was of course ready to give his his testimony and his witness even to aunt Betty's birthday she was celebrating their 95th birthday and I must say she was doing very good and she was very pleased that we were there and surprised that we were there she wasn't expecting us but I did witness to some of the other seniors concerning going from time to eternity because to them maybe this one their mate was gone that one the mate was gone somebody else was gone and to them it was up there in the graveyard no I said they're not in the graveyard I should they go from time to Eternity if they were there believe that faith and I and I would explain it to him and so on and so it was something that they never heard before and I remember that when I when I was ministering up to the Salvation Army Glenbrook Lodge to senior citizens and I was explaining certain things and after I finished I remember I went I was going through the home and this senior the elderly woman she was in her 90s I would say she's going on to her reward and she came over and she said excuse me she said I've got to thank you she said for what you said and what you explained she said I never heard that before but she said I believe it's the truth she says that's exactly she said according to the word a man so appraised the Lord it got a gave her the revelation she needed to go from time to eternity praise the Lord a man and as so others of course that I ministered to in viewers they they caught the revelation I think they believed it a man and God God blessed them and also to continue to pray for Aunt Betty and she's doing very good but her daughter Jessie was there but she didn't look too good and her daughter was with her Kimberly and Kimberly sort of kept her arms around her to keep her up and to keep her walking she had she had to have help so we pray the grace of God to Jesse and she said well she said yes she said I would like that you keep praying for it for me she said and I said we will and I said the church is praying for you to all she said thank you thank you so God's grace to Jesse at this time a man and when we visited her before we left in her home that she was lying down and she was still feeling the weakness and as I said before she's lost a hundred pounds and maybe looking at her you wouldn't think that but she was a very heavyset person and she did lose a hundred pounds so God's grace to her a man to make her call him and her election shore by grace amen and also to remember in prayer sister Betty's brother heard and his wife Jean and they have changed quite submit some since the last time that we had seen them about a year ago and it's totally two different people oh yeah they look totally different so the grace of God to her and the grace of God to Jean and even in our fellowship with them there was there were times when the spiritual came and I and I would say something just about the Lord and about the Word of God and also when we went again to our sister Betty's other brother Roy and his wife Phyllis and our conversation I must say was more spiritual with them than we have had at any time before yeah and so we pray the grace of God to bless them a man and I believe that they're they're focusing more and more on the Lord they're focusing more and more on the spiritual by the grace of God amen so I pray the anointing of the Holy Ghost be with them and give them his leadership amen and also to ask you to remember and keep in prayer sister Eileen's husband Heber and I did explained to brother Mark that we did we did visit the cemetery in Buren our cemetery there and of course there's only two buried their sister green and her daughter Eileen we had Eileen is heber's wife and apparently he had he had already just maybe recently maybe this year again painted the painted the fence for us and I didn't know that and he had painted the fence and he must have been keeping keeping the the ground mold and because the grass needed to be mowed again but it had been mowed down through the summer for sure amen because it wasn't wasn't all that high and so on so we thank the Lord for Ebers work we thank the Lord for the bird not only that we met his daughter we didn't meet Heber but we met his daughter and she told us that there are times when when her father goes to the cemetery and there's a bench he got a bench there and he'll sit on the bench for two or three hours yeah and and in no doubt he's meditating and so on so god bless you hey man now we haven't had much contact with him since our sister Eileen went on to be with the Lord well we pray the grace of God to Heber and God bless him for what he's doing amen praise the Lord Amen god bless let's say standards they only believe as we go to the word amen all [Music]

iniquities the chastisement of our peace live on you Lord and with your stripes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey Matt praise the lord god bless you turn with me to Romans chapter 1 amen the book of Romans chapter 1 praise the Lord God's grace to us brother sister amen beginning to read at verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ a man I trusted it's the truth for all for all of us not ashamed of the gospel not what's out there in a denomination but with the gospel that God has revealed to us through the Ministry of a prophet I am not ashamed of that gospel not ashamed of that revelation of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek a man it is the power of God unto the resurrection and the rapture 4 verse 17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith and we're going from faith to faith to faith God is leading his sons and daughters from faith to faith to faith this revelation that revelation that revelation till we come to the full and complete revelation of God a man in our Lord Jesus Christ the just shall live by that faith for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness amen that's not all it in unrighteousness but in the righteousness of God the revelation of the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ a man that has been imputed to us by grace because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God noted unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen a man we're seeing what the religious world doesn't see we're understanding where they don't understand we're hearing what they're not hearing amen it is the grace of God and it is the faith that pleases God for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead hallelujah amen even as eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God a man neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools god help us that we're going to be spiritual not just religious having this revelation that revelation this understanding that understanding a man brother and they become fools in the eyes of God amen and it says that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse a man for doing what they do and believe in what they believe in the way that they believer there without excuse a man because of the extent of the revelation that God has given them but they're doing what's right in their own eyes not the eyes of God by the eyes of man a man in verse again 21 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God they knew God Amen but they didn't glorify Him as God and today they know God but they don't glorify Him as God because it is in a church and in its this revelation that revelation this idea that idea this Creed or that dark that doctrine but it's a revelation of God they glorified him not as God my brother's sister is a challenge to our faith you know God that are you are you glorifying him as God are you gonna worship as God amen and it says neither we're thankful I meant a lot of believers that are not glorifying God is gone now worshiping God is gone and they are not thankful oh yeah well the Lord did is the Lord did that but lets ever ever grateful and a thankful heart a man that's ever grateful and thankful spirit for what God has done and what God is doing that by the grace of God we are here tonight there by the grace of God we are still looking and believing for the resurrection and the rapture amen that is the grace of God a man is not we're not over there like religion and and going into a church every every a you know every service and oh yeah I'll praise the Lord Amen you know thank you preach it again preach it again yeah but are you going over there and live in it are you going out there and and looking for it a man with the spirit of it what expecting the Resurrection expecting the rapture amen hey man but as they again they're in the early early church they were looking for the resurrection looking with a raptor even in that day even at that hour a man and the Bible tells us said that every day they got together a fellowship around the Word of God not foolishness the Word of God amen and there was their generation after generation of their generation brother than when God had a revival they did this we got in a rib eye where the people got together and fellowship not just in a church a man sometimes do it just in someone's house or go here go there and and so on but but the thing the important thing was that the Holy Ghost was in control God was in control amen and no matter where you met them how you made them no matter what it was that everything was spiritual their thoughts are spiritual their conversation was spiritual they were praising the Lord they will thankful to the Lord amen they loved the Lord amen amen and the anointing of God was there to bless them praise the name of the Lord brother and I and this is this is the anoint us on the bride in these last days and the father God mentioned these Saints and what it was like there with me and he was like but he said now he said I know he said it's not like it used to be but he sure there there are those here that know that and he said those here that don't know it it's because you haven't experienced it Amen that's right it's a J that you don't know but by their generation then and what it was like and the anointing that was there the power of God that was there and the pressures that was there amen but he said there are those here that do know it but he said you don't know it Amen the problem of God knew it and he said those that there that do know what he said we won't know and you will know but not not not experience it amen and I said oh lord thank you I said that's what I told the church just recently I saw that what the atmosphere was like but in that the atmosphere is not like that now you don't see you don't feel that anointing one time you did he invited us and it was there 50 years ago it was there 40 years ago when we first came to this word in this master a man and the anointing was with us as we gathered together but the anointing was also out there a man God was moving by his spirit out there but now because why they got more and more to religion or gone out of it why now the Spirit of God is only in the bright anybody and the only ones got any experience is the few that are the Bride of Christ that are going in a rat rapture by the grace of God amen this is why that we the world feels so dead because it is spiritually dead amen but by the grace of God the life is in the bright Amen brother they were dead in the days of Jesus and just think all that saw his miracles all they saw his signs and wonders and some maybe that even experience it amen and here they were saying crucify inclusive and it was pilot the political leader here he was he was saying listen he said I find no fault in him he said he said let me release our dear leader release him unto you a man no they certainly released this one a murderer oh yeah depositor what he hasn't done anything and even pilots wife sent that send that message to pilot she should have nothing to do with that just man for she suffered said things I've even had reamed through the night a man so don't do nothing with him Eddie and he didn't want to do any with him buddy certain but no I shouldn't have he we did what God wanted him to do really in a sense why because he was what he was predestinated to do what he was doing anyway because he had the lay down his life for you and me he volunteered and that's why when Pilate talk talk talk he wouldn't answer wouldn't say honey oh I didn't say nothing oh come on come on defend yourself defend your sensor for it amen and he wouldn't he just held his peace god help us brother hey man by the grace of God in this hour in this age that we're good we're not gonna miss it because brother Lee they crucified him now they're gonna crucify you and me no matter what you do I trust you're not going to compromise amen no not going to compromise because listen you compromise you're lost amen but as he laid down his life so we lay down our lives for the Gospels sake for Jesus sake amen grace of God be with us in this hour for the glory of God for therefore our salvation just think they knew God but they didn't worship Him as God they knew about him but the elders what do they do and Bible says they held the truth in unrighteousness a man either forms of godliness and they're saying and only that we won't read it on down but it all goes down to tell you the sin that comes in oh yeah and now that's that sinners come back into the churches oh yeah in fact no not not Jews only a few days ago that they said they'd they married two couples in a certain Church lesbians yeah yes another one went and went and went into a church Eddie was not long ago two days ago again and they went into a certain church yeah Christian's so-called Christian denominational Church and what to do married a gay couple what and that's that's the judgment of Christ because why because of their unrighteous faith amen because they said rather God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth they hold the truth in unrighteousness you better hold it in righteousness hey man I rights his attitude and a righteous spirit you're taking your stand for him amen again verse 24 the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse a man the world without his ghost in light of what God has revealed because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened brother they knew god they knew this they knew that but their heart was darkened they knew it in their heads but not in their heart professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things God blesses words you may be seated it's going back to the messages that we have been ministering on for the last number of weeks concerning hearing the thing airing the Word of God and hearing the revelation the way that God wants us to hear it and seeing the revelation the way that God wants us to see it a man they were hearing it but apparently not seated the way that that God wanted to see it and to get them to do what God wanted them to do brother it's the same thing with us in the hearing of the word in this hour God wants us to hear it in a certain way and God wants us to see it in a certain way because God is wanting us to do a certain thing amen and what God wants us to do in this hour is the resurrection and the rapture he wants us to have that faith that it's going to bring the resurrection and the rapture into a physical manifestation a man so that it is no longer just the promise in the Word of God but rather God is raising up a generation that is going to bring it into manifestation and that's why again he said that the dead in Christ are waiting on us a man what waiting on us not now waiting on God no the waiting on us the waiting for a generation to rise that's going to have the faith of the rapture a man and if we got the faith of the rapture we're going to have the faith of the Resurrection amen because Jesus he had the faith of the Resurrection and he had the faith of the rapture because he laid his life down and he picked it up again and the bride is laying her life down but she's picking it up again he made it is for the glory of God we're going to pick it up in resurrection and rapturing faint amen it's just not leaning it down for religion it's not just raining downward for this doctrine or that doctrine is leaning down for what for the purpose that God wants us to lay it down and to pick it up for the purpose that God wants us to pick it up what is it that God wants to do and again we've got are we going to recognize and believe and know that we are we are not back here in Luther's hour Luther's ager or even even in the age of the first church age no know what God did thing is one thing but what God is doing now is another and what God did in Luther's age Wesley sage and the end and the Pentecostal type and that was one thing but God that God is doing something else amen no go ahead as I have said God didn't do away with that no God God was adding to it God God took justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen but that's not that's not the end that's not the finish of it because why because God had a motive and objective in doing what he did he said I will restore say the Lord a man and he knew that in the indian day in the first church they said what he gave then the enemy came in and the enemy was going to head to it take away from it a man and the church went from one from the light into darkness a man and there are those Church ages where the darkness came in and the darkness came in by God said I'm going to restore saith the Lord and he and he brought and he brought the light through Luther Andrew Wesley and for the Pentecostals but again the public arts of the year here in this last stage he said it went into total darkness a man absolute total darkness and again it's like I said about when I was in there in the school that time and they do recognize you know the church ages they recognize this happened and that happened something else happened and but they don't recognize me about the church last Church age what you and I recognized as I said the teacher the Bible teacher said to me in the school and not me but to the students now he said what church age are we in he says anybody here know what church age we're in and nobody knew but me by the grace of God a man and so I wouldn't wouldn't answer I was just waiting for somebody else answer until he asked the question two or three times and finally I just raised my hand and he saw he said okay he said what church or what Serge's are we in and I said I said we're even allowed to see interchange it is the last row change all he said you were right he said exactly right but he recognized that and then there are others they would recognize that but they don't recognize the condition of the last sir change they don't recognize that they might go into the scripture there and read it but again it's not having the effect on them and no more than a the effect on those here in the in the book of Romans a man and he's got the revelation of God but you're not worshiping God you don't worship Him as God and you got this revelation but he said you're not doing this you got this revelation but you're not doing that exactly it was just just religion a man oh they believe this when they believe that so also in the in the last church age a man and it says concerning again the last 13 excuse me and he said oh they they three that tells you what they're thinking but it also gives you the revelation of what God knows amen because in the last search age they felt they were all right they believed that God was with them God was in them God was around them God was blessing them oh yeah because we got where we're rich and increased with Goods and we have need of nothing and brother don't you ever judge your life that way no way don't you say what I believe I believe everything is fine I am rich and increased with Goods and I've been blessed with this I've been blessed with that brother no no no you could have all of that because jesus said but but he said you don't know that you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked and the sad part he says you don't know it a man that's the spirit of the load of C&H a man the deception of the load of C&H they feel this but God by God has seen this brothers one thing to see there for you to see this but how does God see it one thing for you to think look at look at all my again looking to the mirror of the word a man and listen and the Bible says again that he looks into the mirror of the word but he forgets what he sees a man many have looked into the mirror of the word of the revealed word for this iron for this age but brother and you're first they did they saw themselves and they humble themselves oh I believe the message and so on but they came to the place where they forgot what they saw in the mirror amen they praise the name of the Lord for the grace of God to us who don't forget hey man they looked they saw and maybe they did this they did that or I'll get baptized and the sisters Allah let my hair grow and and all dressed you know the way I should dress and so on and the brothers go do this to do this to this but amen but after a while they forget every - every old my brother every generation every transience they looked into the mayor of the Word of God a man and there are those that remembered but there are those that forgot hey man those that remember their faith took upon the glory and those that forgot their faith took him on to hell amen like the rich young ruler lifted up his eyes in hell being in torment amen and remember he kept he kept all the commandments Jesus did this this and this he's I've done all that's in my youth oh no no as I said nobody here can say that knowing I'm a a teammate but see his motive and his objective wasn't right he'd ever had a Holy Ghost or a seat of God motive an objective no no he wanted for this reason for that reason he want to give the glory to himself but not the glory to Jesus amen yet Jesus loved him hey man anybody or God loves God loves God does this go two yards right but they don't mean you're saved you got to respond to his loss hey man you got to respond to the love of God you were responding to the call of God you got to respond to the Word of God the way that God wants you to respond amen brother it's the way it's the way that the seed of God are going to respond and when God knows that when he sends out his word is his seed his sons and his daughter are gonna respond this way amen by the grace of God but now if you're not seed of God now son the daughters of God you're not going to respond completely the way that God wants you to respond or respond completely the way seed of God is gonna respond no no you go so far but then you'll stop you want as he said right here you want glorify Him as God you want worship Him as God you're not gonna go forth and the right is righteousness no no not by any maids yeah and he said for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness brothers all the truth in the righteousness of the life of Christ Christ its Christ in me amen is this whole mind we were reading scripture in in devotion I believe it was last night or this or today and I said Oh Lord I said that as a confirmation absolute confirmation scripture after scripture verse after verse after verse what I said Lord is not me and not sister Betty as living as Christ living in us either because there's no way I said we could go for the manifest this and do this and do this I should add me you in us amen I can't do it Lord sister buddy can't do it but if you witness yeah and brother the scripture I don't know whether what the scripture was at the time right now and I need to go back to the devotional and then to see it busters thank the Lord hallelujah that is wonderful hey man lord I suggest your grace it's you it's you it's you it's hell I says not mean I said it's you I said I yes you you're confirming you're confirming what your servant said it's not me that lives is Christ that liveth hey man whether it is Paul in the Fed the believers of the first age or us right on down to this last age amen it's crazy live within me I can't do it he does it amen by the grace of Almighty God hey man so again by the grace of God let's not let's look into the mirror of the Word of God and let's not forget what we see that we are sinners saved by grace amen there's no when you're not gonna see none of your righteousness no you got none no no no all the rights as you see it's gonna be Jesus amen it's going to be Christ in us the hope of glory ain't man it's gonna be his righteous in this room and see it's crazy in the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul the baptism of they're going to love in your soul any man and what what divine love is projected back in Genesis that divine love is going to project in your life amen grace but you know it starts with know it starts with divine look Amen brother you love God and you love God God loves you did you love this one you love that one amen amen God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son amen that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life a merit and brother he manifested that love in the bright praise the name of the Lord I've been baptized with divine love you've been baptized with divine love amen your heart goes out to this one your heart is going out to that one to that one amen and you're going forth to witness Jesus Christ if you can't talk to them about it you want to live it amen that's the truth sometimes you maybe don't have the liberty or the freedom to talk or say this or say that but I'll tell you this if you keep doing what you're not in there from living it hey man you can't help it but live it amen so it's not you living it was Christ live with your attitude your spirit your motives your objectives it's all Jesus amen it's Christ in us brother why it truly truly if you truly been born in your soul on the inside of the inside a man now you got all the nature of God is in you this is absolutely amazing it is a challenge to our faith it is a chance to what we say we believe amen yeah it's not again if it's not me and leaves as Christ leave it in me that means I don't have my old nature there's God he put it out amen Jesus went in and washed it out with his word we even washed by the water of the word amen so that so that the old nature is gone now the new nature is in control and is Christ in us a man my brother is not again in your attitude when I see you I see Jesus amen this is this absolutely amazing amen when I slick and look at you I see Jesus a believer seeing it in another believer we see Jesus and brother we're respecting and not and loving Jesus yeah see we got we got to see beyond the natural person we got to see we are see that is Christ in my brother it's Christ in my sister amen or I know that they wouldn't have that attitude that they got they wouldn't have the spirit that they got they wouldn't have the motives and objectives they got amen they wouldn't say I have the understanding they got if it wasn't Jesus enough amen but they got this understanding this mode of this objective they they do this they live this way why yes Jesus anyway because if it wasn't Jesus in them they would live this way they would do this they would say this they would act this way no it's your total hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now you got a heavenly atmosphere in you hey man you got an Evelyn character you mean why the character that you're going to live out here brother that's the character you're going to live out in heaven in glory and here I don't have it here you won't ever there you won't be there hallelujah praise the name of the Lord brother sister God all of us that we're going to hear the way God wants us to hear now we are going to see the way God wants us to say it and then gonna produce in us the life that God looking for and God will recognize as his life as the life of Jesus amen this is tremendous this is absolutely tremendous brother why let's see ourselves as good not as we see ourselves when it comes to there man sees us religiously but see what God sees us amen I trust brother that we're going beyond what he was seeing here in the first church age or the last church age wretched miserable poor blind naked and they're probably God I lied to the fact and don't know it he says that that'd be pretty that had to be pretty well gone there that'd be pretty well insane to know a person out there and and and naked and don't know he's naked he's the same when we see that those things going on in the world out there that's insanity the Prophet said the world's gone insane and brother we've lived to see the insane world amen it is insane the way people think the way people act the way people dress it's insanity and what they're putting the emphasis on in this life it's insanity god help us amen that we're going to hear the word of God the way God wants us to hear it see it the way God wants us to see it amen and we'll live the life that Jesus lived he laid down his life for the gospel sake for the words sake what but for our sake yes but we were identified in the word amen the seed of God the sons and daughters of God amen so we lay down our lives for one another we're not living for ourselves there's so many believers they're just living for themselves that's all they just you just believe this and this it's just religion you know like in Romans chapter one there they got the religion and they they got there they got their righteousness but it's become hard righteousness because they're not they're not yielding to it there no no no oh they believe this but then oh I believe God yeah but they're not worshiping God and if you worship God you go to worship in the morning noon and night you're devoting your life to Him morning noon and night I don't know you god help us brother but he but a proves if you're not doing it it proves that you haven't heard it the way God here or is it ears that or the way that God wants you to hear it and you're not seeing it the way God wants you to see him you're maybe Herot the way that you want to hear it see it the way you want to see it or the way men want you to see it so they could say oh we got so many believe in this message some years ago they said oh yeah there's two million around the world that believes his message yeah I said they're believing in their heads I said how many are believing it in their hearts it's not going to be two million going to rapture a man no no but the more and more religious they got the more and more denominational they got the more and more people came to identify with the message but the probably God said again there might be weld he said 500 not even one time he said one or two hundred and they like this just like he told that sister and he said God asked me to or someone asked him the her sister about picking out so many people on the earths they were warming but how many people would be there for the rapture and that's when he told us history says sister if God asked me to pick out he would dozen or so something like that he said I'd be scared to death he said I'd have it be so hard to pick the fight number why because he was he was recognizing that even the old ones were losing their experience he said when I went our old brothers and sisters he said are losing their experience and and they're getting dry in their in their testimony he said it's serious yeah he was experiencing that and as I said he was experiencing that he even in his own church yeah yes because even this message right here in 1965 random tire Michael Wright and I have heard but now I see that was life Tabernacle but it was it was professing believers yeah and in 1965 I think was 65 that a brother branham had preached so many a couple of servants there first in Shreveport and was on the phone and many others were listening to it in other churches and after he fretted for these preachers that particular sermon they called brother more Jack more and they said brother he said don't let William Brennan preach tomorrow night he's don't let him bridge after he preached a certain message that it was so heard they couldn't take it no more and so brother Jack Moore went to the hotel looking for brother Branham I couldn't find him any but and I sure if that was the situation then but they had put brother Ram in a certain hotel and and it was an expensive hotel and he felt that it wasn't it wasn't right for a Christian to be in such an expensive hotel and so he he went and he got himself into another hotel yeah cheaper one I told her brother of the head and he even even went flying on a plane he said you don't fly off a rock he said the first-class issue fly down to the last class he says as a Christian he said you're not into the best he said you take the least yeah amazing absolutely amazing and the brother was shocked when I when I told that oh he's I never heard that before oh yes I said it's just sits there are the tapes I said that's what he mentioned and you know where he was if he was talking about that when he flew from India he was in India and he was flying from India and that's where he was sitting right at the back he said that's what Christian said amen the name of the Lord no Christmas today want the best Christmas today want number one Chris yesterday want upfront Chris yesterday he want recognition and so on all brother if price is living in you you don't want it hey man no no no you're gonna take you take the least brother and again if you're hearing it the way God wants you to hear it see it the way God wants you see it you'll have that attitude amen you'll have that spirit amen because the word is gonna produce that kind of a life in you as it was in Christ brother they were thinking that Messiah was going to come here mister I will come there to Messiah be there no no born born in a manger born in a bird yeah they thought maybe be born in with any in in a in one in a house of the priesthood in the temple no not by any means he was born in a barn oh but but they went to the hotel but there was no room there and surely God could have arranged for it if he wanted it oh yeah there's no problem no but they couldn't no can't get him okay that's where Joseph was going and Mary was going May they felt that way with God you know all well this the Lord so you know we should be in the best no you go into the scriptures more often than not he was down to lowest and he started with somebody up there he put him down there amen you talk about but but the Apostle Paul he started up there but he ended up down there amen he ended up in prison he laid down his life praise the name of the Lord where brother Jesus started the in the he started in the manger in the burn but he's the king of kings and Lord of lords everybody so brother Wiegel the same way we're not exalted here we're exalted in glory anyway we're gonna sit with him in his strong in glory by the grace of God but we sit with him in strong now the revealed word but I tell you this we're not going to be recognized we're not gonna be honored he wasn't so we want a man but we're going to glory by the grace of God so brother we got to hear it the way God wants us to hear it we gotta say it the way God wants us to see it amen and not only that but you got to have the right motive and the right objective in your heart amen for the glory of God yes for the salvation of our souls but for the glory of God amen the right motive and a right objective brother that revelation brother has said we know that Abel heard of the way God wanted him to hear saw the way God who wanted him to see it Amen but it cost him his life yeah he had a right motive and a right objective oh yeah he didn't he didn't compromise with Cain even when Cain was arguably then left out there in the garden somewhere amen Cain was arguing with with Abel way because Abel's sacrifice was accepted hey man I believe that the pillar far came down and he received his sacrifice and here's came there with all that he had there and he felt maybe you know the Lord should bless me for this McCall that I have done and all that and all that Abel did was Winona and got this lamb and killed it and shed blood everywhere even on himself amen but Cain fell to hold this I've got a good sacrifice here amen brother that's the sacrifice of most denominational churches after Thanksgiving Day you ever notice that you iive in a mini a church and brother on Thanksgiving Day oh they got all got their the altars lined we're fruit and vegetables everything else that they've grown and so on oh yeah I see that many years yeah that was I thought that was Cain's offering I said they need Abel's offering amen need to have that revelation your soul by the grace of God brother it's like Abel had the right motive and the right objective amen it wasn't just to please God no no it was to restore fellowship with God amen it's one thing the place God hey man and brother and again God came down and talked to came and and God said this the king this decane oh yeah II just think God talk to King amen but we have no record in anywhere that God was talking to Abel it was by faith that Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice now Cain at an excellent one and we can offer an excellent one but God's looking for the more excellent amen the one that God wants the one that God is looking for a man to show his influence in your life in your revelation in your faith amen so brother Abel laid down his life oh yeah thank the Lord and yet when when he went Cain went out there and argue with Abel Abel wasn't gonna compromise Abel knew that he had done what was right he done what what he needed what for and it wasn't it wasn't as I said just to please God but to restore his fellowship with God amen Abel repented and he offered the blood sacrifice because he wanted Rafael oshit restored a man and brother Christ came to restore that fellowship for you and me brother it's to establish it well what about it's not it's not to give us a relationship we got a relationship I'm born with it I'll come into this world seed of God sons and daughters of God but born in sin so the Redeemer came to bring us back into with the father whereby be old what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us whereby we can now say abba father father father father Amen hallelujah amen brother what the relationship is restored we were cut off by seeing a man but he knew that you were his son you knew that you were his daughter and he swear he brought the Redeemer down to a man that what for to shed the blood perfect blood to take away your seat not only that just thank God oh just say that that tracker bike was so perfect that God don't even remember your seeing God you know no we do the devil is gonna bring it back to your remembrance in your mind but I tell you no man can lay a charge against God's elect because why because Jesus through through what he did the sin was cast into the sea of forgetfulness oh we're not so forgetful but God is hallelujah he did it in such a way just think God he forgot it God don't remember my sin know if your feet if he recognizes your faith brother and your faith puts it into action in your life oh yeah hallelujah and now somebody say go to the Lord and say Lord he's guilty of this guilty guilty what what do you mean I don't see it you see one thing God sees another and it's based on that person's faith with brother I trust our faith will be as strong as that person as real as that person thank God they without faith it is impossible to please God amen God give us the faith that pleases him God give us the faith the brother for that we are sinners saved by grace we're saved not will be saved we are saved amen and that God has put all sin obvious seed in the sea of forgetfulness amen brother sister do you hear the word the message the way God wants you to hear do you see it the way God wants you to see it is it God or is it you in your head with a lot of so-called believers I tell you this it's all in her head yeah as I said one time when I was back years ago and I was ministry noon I'm not necessarily ministering but somebody else had ministered not me I wasn't ministering then and in another church and all I guess there was two or three hundred in the church church was practically full and of course there was an altar call and and usually back then at the end of the service everybody would come up around the altar and worship and worship and worship at the end of the after the sermon was preached and I remember I was on the platform there and I just I was on the side of the platform side of the bow pit and that the pastor at the time was still behind the pulpit and I was too here but everybody was worshiping worshiping worshiping and praising the Lord and and I remember opening my eyes and as I said I saw a couple of sisters there I said Oh Lord I said there's a problem I said they don't have the anointing of your spirit now they were worshiping they were praising God but there was something there at least the Lord was showing me and revealing to me Oh I said Lord I said they're not believers I said they're going back into the world what led you to believe that well it's just something the Lord revealed to me because they look like believers they activate believers they were dressed like believers but again I was in contact with a spirit yeah with that person's spirit and time fortune said but it was maybe I don't know maybe two or three four years later but they were ended up in the world and they might be gone on somewhere now they'd they'd be I guess as olds I am or older yeah but again I was just young man they're standing on the platform just worshiping you know to God be the glory it's not me it's not me it's the Lord and like I said just other things the Lord has revealed to me and showed me giving me the understanding God Ellis brother I want to keep hearing things the way God wants me to hear it I want to keep seeing it the way God wants me to see it and Lord by the grace of God I want the right motive and a right objective amen and basically what is the right motor and right objective no matter what you're doing it's all for the glory of God you know whatever you do is for the glory of God the life you live is for the glory of God amen what you're saying the witness you give that whatever you reflect it's for the glory of God the right motive and a right objective for God's glory you're giving God the preeminence amen they're not giving premise to this one this one this one give God the preeminence not my will Lord didin be done that's giving God the preeminence by the grace of God it is doing God a service according to his will not your will it's his will amen but it's a generation that's doing God a service without his will and this was the the message the Prophet preached on in 1965 again in Wrentham Tabernacle in July of 1965 doing God to service without his will amen so if you're going to hear it see it the way God wants you to do it and you're going to have the right motor but objective all for the glory of God giving God the preeminence amen you will do God a service according to his will amen you're not gonna do what you want to do you're gonna do what God wants you to do you're gonna follow God's leadership not your leadership you're gonna follow Holy Ghost leadership not human leadership don't go by your feelings no don't go by your intellect and your reasoning no no we're going by faith you got a-you cast down reasoning oh yeah you're going by faith what God reveals to you God want me to do this God want me to go there God want me to do this and so on oh yeah you're doing it's not and again it's not you the leaves as Christ that liveth in you amen and what would Jesus do this what would Jesus do if he was in control he would certainly come together with the Saints for he said where I have gathered two or three together my name there I am in the midst you know it says where two or three are gathered together in my name is where I am as the original where I have gathered them is not man gathering himself is Christ gathering them he says there am I in the midst by the grace of God amen so brothers sister are we doing this according to his will and for his glory for his honor for his phrase to give preeminence to him why are we doing it not only this coming to church but other things you do as I've said before even your job you got to have have the leadership of God in your job what is the will of God I'm doing the will of God oh yeah don't think seed and unfortunately we live in a world where intellectually people choose this job choose this job you know all because they're trained this way they're trained that way you don't go by that you go by Holy Ghost leadership yeah you know Lord you want me to do this you want me to do this you want me to do that yes yes son yeah it's not explained before the way all the way that God has made me this way this way and I wondered I I do she prayed and I talked to the Lord about it and said Lord is it do you want me to do this you know what's the purpose and so on now sometimes God would tell me to purpose other times he wouldn't I had to go on and follow his leadership yeah so brother let's make sure that we're gonna do God a service with his will not without his will according to the will of God not contrary to the will of God amen so we'll get more and more into this later but it let me just leave this quote these quotes with you again and he said we're in the end time and now the Lord bless you richly I get started on that and I and forget about time and we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity anyhow well he was talking about the length of his sermon he said when I get started on this he's I forget about time so does your pastor and I I got a I got a watch but I rarely look at it yeah and I did I I've looked at that one up there man but again we're dealing with eternal issues so brother don't lead time control you forget it as I said there was a time when oh yeah when the anointing was there he will ieave when I was in the Salvation Army that's a young man Oh on Sunday night not 9 o'clock no 12 o'clock yeah one o'clock yeah that's when the service would end oh yeah they go in worship praise the Lord of course they used to have testimony meetings and then they go preacher preach the message and and then and to get into altar call then people other people get up around the altar and praise and worship the Lord then they give maybe might sometimes I have a Jericho March and and as I told you I was sitting in the front seat in the in the pew there anyway end and and they would they would March they were march down they walk across the front of the foot in front of the altar they would go down the other aisle want open to the best of you will come around again and again and they were singing onward Christian soldiers marching as to why they go and go and go and I remember having to pull my legs in because I was sitting in the front seat I had to pull my legs in when they were going to went around the corner and so on so but again that was that was a that was a Sunday evening service and it would go on to 12:00 or 1:00 o'clock at night and again in the morning again they'd be there 10:30 for to pray for a half hour and the service start at 11:00 and the search will go on to maybe two o'clock yeah two o'clock and then we'd be go home and going to have a dinner and then we had to come back for Sunday school what yeah come back for Sunday school and then this Sunday school we would be in Sunday school until 4:00 4:30 we'd go home and get supper come back for a service and evening 6:30 yeah oh yeah it was all gone it was the Lord it was the Lord amen it was giving free MS to the Lord and they loved the Lord so brother they weren't considered a weren't thinking about time they were into eternity oh yes and he said work and he said he said I get started on that and forget about time he said we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity anyhow well your spirit is right and your attitude is right your motive is right your objective is right we're going into eternity amen so he said God is sovereign excuse me as we see here David Dunn in the scripture reading of a first chronicles 13 but do God does not give us merits on good intentions no no there's only one way to serve God and that's by doing his will at his command there's not your idea it's God's Amen not your intentions and he said you might have good intentions but he said God does not give us merits on good intentions now he said there's only one way to serve God that's by doing his will at his command and God being sovereign he said there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he said he does it the way he wants to do it and because he knows the right way to do it and that makes me feel good and not to make us all feel good and I'm sure it does for one would have it coming in this way and one whatever going that way and the other another way but one great thing about God he has not left us now without knowing what's the truth and how to do it he wouldn't be just he wouldn't be just to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how it was going to be done and then let us stumble into something he is not that kind of a god he's a God that speaks a word and expects his children to believe and therefore he knows what's the best and when to do it and how to do it and we have our ideas but God knows a man brother sister we had our ideas but sometimes our ideas are not right I'll finish with this old brother listen what time are we living him yeah we're seeing what he didn't see well he may have seen it but he didn't tell it he told some things but he also said when I go to my grave he said there's a lot of things he knew he said that he God has showed him revealed to him he said when I go to my grave it'll be in my heart he wouldn't tell us so brother what we're seeing I believe he saw oh yeah he saw it again I know that it's not doesn't have the effect on many a believer because they don't see it as even brother Jareau sees it because they don't they don't realize what it was like 50 years ago and what it's like now and our young generation right here our young sisters and brothers god bless him it's wonderful sisters to have you with us to be to have you they're paying attention to the word and so on but pray grace that God have give them the revelation of what the world was fifty years ago to what it is now and God gave them the revelation of how serious the world is now compared to what it used to be like I said this is not the world I lived in this is not the world my definitely my father lived in he wouldn't want to live in it and my grandmother grandfather no no it's like I said if they came back and saw this world they said let's go back again forget it we're not going to stay here no they wouldn't want to stay if they're in glory and they came back eating the fellowship with with saints and so on and they saw the world the way everything is going and even the way so-called churches are going and it so-called believers so-called Christians no they said we're going home goodbye and they'll go on back to glory they would they definitely wouldn't want to stay no wonder Jesus said how long shall I be with you see that's that's the confirmation that if Saints came from eternity they go they go back oh yeah Jesus I thought finally Jesus got the faith brother I trust and the brighter get that faith Jesus came to that revelation and he got that faith what faith with that he said I am no more in the world what no more in the world that was John 17 and yet what did he do because he was no more in the world he prayed for those that the father had given him who were still in the world he said I pray not for this and this and I pray for those that you have given me out of the world now why because he knew he was on his way out praise the Lord so the bride ought to have the same feeling oh yeah that you're sure you're more in touch with eternity than you are with time and because you are more in touch with eternity then you feel I am no more in the world hallelujah praise the Lord the resurrection of the rapture is getting more and more and more real to us by the grace of God a man is not oh this is going to happen tomorrow I've got to do this tomorrow gotta do that tomorrow or they're gonna do this no what's God going to do where we ought to be more conscious of what God's going to do not what man is doing praise the Lord God knows what's best God knows when to do it how to do it he said oh brother listen what time are we living in what's the age what's the hour that we're living it's not time for these things that we are that they are talking about that's past he said judgment is on hand now and you can see it breaking you remember the rock on the mountain judgment hour you remember the revelation or the vision of the bride just keep her instead don't let her get out of step and as I said in my visit to one of the malls and I saw her I thought it might have been a year after it since I was deeper there before but I said that last visit such different everything was different the people were different they were acting different they were looking different I said Lauren I said insanity has taken over oh I said Lord it wasn't like this when I was here a few months ago or a year oh my lord I said we're closer to the end and what people believe I said god help us God have mercy Lord I said I said and surely I said the resurrection the rapture is right right at hand amen like I said before that I've been walking sometimes who win among people and I've looked Oh who's that I thought it might be somebody that I fellowship with years ago and they were gone on why yeah and finally I would get close enough they all told us not there yeah but you got to be in the spirit to be able to recognize because the dating crisis the Prophet said the dead in Christ going to appear to the living Saints yeah but we got to have that faith to bring them on the scene well yeah the dead in Christ is going to appear to us that's right and then this is we're going to get caught right into into our theophany bodies and then all of us are going to caught up in the glorified bodies and we look up oh there's Jesus yeah there's Jesus we're going to rise to meet him it's gonna be real I pray copy we believe it is not a fairy tale definitely not a fairy tale it's real so I pray grace that we'll have that faith that we believe we believe the resurrection we believe the rapture so if somebody that you know appears to you will you recognize them that they come back from eternity they'll get out of that them as I said they're right there in that dimension and if we get to the faith they we get growing faith mature and faith and we get strong in faith to finally all they recognize it and all that they feel the pull from that dimension to this one all y'all don't feel the pull I trust we're gonna feel the pull they'll field of Vulcan and they'll appear to the living Saints amen praise the name of the Lord well when Jesus arose many of those that written that were gone they arose they went into the city appeared after many well when that when the saints of God come back from the grave not grave but from their dead in Christ not in the grave and it's in our Lord Jesus Christ and they come back and to appear to the living Saints I trust were going to have the spiritual revelation to recognize who they are as sons and daughters of God and cotton and chain and will be changed into glorified bodies God make it real to us amen so that nothing is going to distract us from it amen so when you grow it again and you're among a crowd of people just be on your guard because you might see somebody that you know and somebody that knows you amen but be in the spirit so you'll recognize them amen let's Stan praise the Lord amen let's sing my father's house hallelujah we'll come and go with me to my father's house amen where there is peace sweet peace as this King Jesus will be there there will be no sorrow there there'll be no parting there and I'm on my way out there well
