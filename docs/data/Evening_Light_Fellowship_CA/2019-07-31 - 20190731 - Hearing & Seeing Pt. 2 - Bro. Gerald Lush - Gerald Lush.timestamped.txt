[43:50] this is my crazy marching
[44:00] [Music]
[44:04] amen praise the Lord god bless you and
[44:09] we do welcome my brother Jim a man or
[44:12] bless your brother he meant and make you
[44:14] a blessing praise the Lord so God
[44:18] blessed us and we going to his word
[44:20] tonight
[44:21] be in prayer a man want to share with
[44:25] you what the Lord has laid on my heart
[44:28] and trusting that it's what we need here
[44:30] tonight trusting is what you need
[44:33] tonight and I do feel that it is needed
[44:36] so we pray the grace of God to be with
[44:39] us brother so that he will anoint me to
[44:43] give it buddy anoint you to take it hey
[44:46] man so you got the father God said when
[44:49] the minister is preaching you know you
[44:52] got to be pulling on it it's all depend
[44:55] on its it he said if the anointing is
[44:57] not in the assembly he said he said we
[45:00] might as well not preach if the
[45:02] anointing is not in the congregation he
[45:03] said he's because you got to be praying
[45:05] you got to be calling for it you got to
[45:07] be hungry and thirsting for it
[45:09] and he said then God is going to move on
[45:10] the scene and anoint the speaker he's
[45:13] going to anoint the breacher a man so
[45:16] brother sister remember God is depending
[45:18] on you a man and the preacher is
[45:22] depending on you a man there probably
[45:24] would depend on the people a man their
[45:27] hunger and their thirst for the Word of
[45:29] God and God is going to respond to that
[45:32] hunger God is going to respond to that
[45:34] thirst God's going to anoint the
[45:36] preacher to say what he wants him to say
[45:38] not what the preacher wants to say but
[45:40] what God wants him to say a man it's you
[45:43] can go so far with your notes but then
[45:46] you got to leave the rest with God a man
[45:48] as God wants to bypass the notes that's
[45:50] fine and if God gives you the notes but
[45:53] that's fine we'll we'll stick with that
[45:55] as the Lord leads so it's not my will
[45:58] father time be done by the grace of God
[46:01] amen
[46:02] so we're trusted Lords go to minister to
[46:05] each brother and sister here and maybe
[46:07] somebody online maybe somebody in DVD
[46:10] land we don't know but God knows so
[46:13] we're going to leave it with the Lord so
[46:14] I trust by the grace of God there
[46:17] we're gonna have the heart to receive it
[46:19] we're gonna do it as we as we've been
[46:21] ministering on during the last service
[46:22] concerning I have heard but now I see
[46:25] it's hearing what God wants you to hear
[46:27] it's hearing the wake I want you to hear
[46:30] then you're gonna see what God wants you
[46:32] to see a man as their part of God I like
[46:35] the fact that he said you can hear it
[46:36] with these ears but he said you're not
[46:38] going to see it the way God wants you to
[46:40] see it no no you see it may be the way
[46:42] the devil wants you to see it a man he's
[46:45] going to interpret it he's going to show
[46:47] you this he's going to show you that but
[46:49] God wants to show you something the
[46:50] devil is trying to keep from you
[46:52] a man so let's let's have the every ear
[46:55] of the soul it's not these ears it's the
[46:59] year a man and the Bible highlights that
[47:02] as I've already given you some
[47:04] scriptures on it and we'll give you more
[47:06] tonight concerning let him that hath an
[47:08] ear not ears we all got ears but again
[47:13] let him better than hear hear what the
[47:15] Spirit is saying to the church praise
[47:17] the Lord
[47:18] so I pray God that we got we got the ear
[47:20] of the soul we got the ear of the Holy
[47:22] Ghost amen
[47:23] we're going to hear what God is speaking
[47:26] and we're going to see it
[47:28] I have heard but now I see but if you
[47:31] hear it right you'll see it right by the
[47:33] grace of God amen so God be with us and
[47:36] we go further into the word let stand

[55:48] with me to the book of proverbs chapter
[55:50] 20 proverbs chapter 20 a man be in
[55:58] prayer praying the leadership of the
[56:02] Holy Ghost to leave me to do what he
[56:06] wants me to do say what he wants me to
[56:08] say a man so the grace of God that it
[56:13] will be what you need well I feel it's
[56:17] what we need or the Lord has laid on my
[56:19] heart I want to share it with you and it
[56:24] concerns the revealed Word and
[56:28] brother/sister we can fit it into we can
[56:30] fit it into into the into the written
[56:32] word a man and as I've said before this
[56:35] is what I saw brother Billy Paul
[56:38] explained concerning this and the
[56:41] written word and I saw him do it on on a
[56:43] film somewhere and and he said you got
[56:46] to take this he said this is the written
[56:48] word but he said you got to put it in
[56:50] here a man to get the balance of it he
[56:53] said it there to reveal word in the
[56:56] written word a man by the grace of God
[56:58] and I said Lord I said that's exactly
[57:00] the truth a man so that only this way
[57:03] are we going to hear it the way that God
[57:05] wants us to hear it and we're going to
[57:06] see it the way that God wants us to see
[57:08] it but we got to do it right we got to
[57:10] put we got to do as our brother said put
[57:12] it in here but there's too many taking
[57:14] this and going with it no no no you got
[57:17] to take it and lay it in here and go and
[57:19] you got to go with this a man man shall
[57:21] not live by bread alone but by every
[57:23] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[57:25] God and it's not just what God has
[57:27] revealed in this hour in this age
[57:29] brother we got to put it in and see how
[57:32] it fits with all the rest that God has
[57:34] done down through the ages from Genesis
[57:36] to Revelation there's too many of them
[57:38] when it comes to believers and they're
[57:40] only focusing on what God has done in
[57:42] this hour only what God has done in this
[57:44] age brother we're not going to see it
[57:46] the way we need to see it we're not
[57:47] going to hear the way we should hear it
[57:49] unless we see it in the
[57:51] playing the purpose and the pattern of
[57:53] God a man we got to be able to fit it in
[57:55] here somewhere and say oh yeah oh yes
[57:58] Lord that's you a man you you did this
[58:00] you started this you did this and then
[58:03] oh well there was a Luther and there was
[58:04] a Wesley and now now there's a
[58:06] melancholy for a man now we're getting
[58:09] into the eel or revelation or we're
[58:11] getting into the second coming of our
[58:13] Lord Jesus Christ we're getting into the
[58:15] revelation of the resurrection we're
[58:18] getting into the revelation of the
[58:19] rapture a man but how are we going to
[58:22] see it the way we should see it are we
[58:24] going to hear the way we should hear
[58:25] whether we got to put it in here amen
[58:28] it is it is a revealed word a man
[58:31] whether this is the revealed word but
[58:33] let's get back to the word and see what
[58:35] God is revealing a man to see the
[58:38] mystery of God in the scriptures it is
[58:40] written it is thus saith the lord a man
[58:43] it is not just all William Branham said
[58:46] this wheel in Wrentham said that and
[58:47] it's in this magic sereth in that
[58:49] message brother he kind of he takes us
[58:52] back to the word amen
[58:54] even in this message right here I have
[58:56] heard but now I see brother and he takes
[58:59] us back to Joel and brother that's not
[59:01] going back to the Jew you know in the
[59:03] middle of the Bible that book was
[59:04] written before any other book was
[59:06] written a man Joel was there before the
[59:09] book of Genesis was written a man what
[59:12] Joel be experienced in the revelation
[59:14] that God gave Joel became it was before
[59:16] Genesis a man that's hard for a lot of
[59:19] people to believe because all what the
[59:21] book of Joel was somewhere you know
[59:22] whether 1:30 waits for the Bible makes
[59:25] no difference
[59:26] a man got our data to be pretty what
[59:28] there ain't man but but God what job
[59:32] experience and what God was revealing
[59:34] fruit roll brother it was before the
[59:37] book of Genesis amen but God ordained it
[59:40] to be put in the Bible where he where it
[59:42] is why because after reading Genesis and
[59:46] and the Old Testament and the end the
[59:48] Old Covenant a man under the law there
[59:51] we needed to get into the book of Joel a
[59:53] mayor because I tell you this if there's
[59:56] anything that drove had it wasn't the
[59:58] law it was grace a man hallelujah
[1:00:01] because people were getting caught up
[1:00:03] with the law and there are people yet
[1:00:05] today are still under the under the
[1:00:07] influence of the law and the Old
[1:00:09] Covenant and trying to mix it with the
[1:00:11] New Covenant
[1:00:11] no no it's Grace and brother name we
[1:00:14] want to go back to the book of Joel that
[1:00:17] is to hear God the way we need to hear
[1:00:19] and to see the things of God we need to
[1:00:21] do a we need to see it amen and that's
[1:00:24] why god oh he was before Genesis though
[1:00:26] he's before Abraham there's before Moses
[1:00:29] a man he was before all the others a man
[1:00:33] blessed be the name of the Lord yet is
[1:00:36] it is a testimony of the grace of God
[1:00:38] amen and then and not only that Jesus
[1:00:42] played it back to Joel and he wanted to
[1:00:45] remember the patience of Joe he want to
[1:00:47] remember a job this and job that a man
[1:00:50] as her father God brings out in the
[1:00:52] message he said God is not correcting
[1:00:54] job he said God is purging job a man God
[1:00:59] is is it's just making job more and more
[1:01:01] and more righteous he's bringing out
[1:01:03] more and more faith in Joe hallelujah
[1:01:06] Joe oh my god was challenging Joe but a
[1:01:10] man he knew where job was maybe even
[1:01:12] before the book of Genesis and he said
[1:01:14] where were you when I laid the
[1:01:16] foundations of the earth hey when the
[1:01:18] son morning stars sang together the sons
[1:01:20] of God said of her joy ain't man and the
[1:01:23] morning star was the ministry and the
[1:01:25] sons of God the the seed the seed of God
[1:01:28] the children of God and he said so where
[1:01:30] were you when I did this hey man
[1:01:33] Joe we got a revelation hallelujah and
[1:01:35] him brother he was condemned by the
[1:01:37] world a man the bride to be condemned by
[1:01:40] the world a man they they they were
[1:01:42] crucifying Christ in Joel amen amen but
[1:01:46] God was given to how God was endeavoring
[1:01:48] to show ain't man to show you and me the
[1:01:51] revelation of Christ in Joel the
[1:01:53] revelation of the grace of God in Joel
[1:01:55] amen thank God brother which we look
[1:01:58] through the Old Testament over there
[1:02:00] that's
[1:02:00] that's the law no we go back here as
[1:02:03] grace a man brother if there's any other
[1:02:06] book that stands there I there's not not
[1:02:10] many I attended this the book of Job
[1:02:12] stands out a man because it is a
[1:02:15] testimony of the grace of God so God
[1:02:18] Elvis and we get into it to hear it the
[1:02:21] way we should hear it and see what God
[1:02:22] wants us to see it and see the way that
[1:02:25] God wants us to see it a man see they
[1:02:28] didn't they didn't all see Luther's
[1:02:29] message the way that or they didn't all
[1:02:31] hear it the way God wanted them to hear
[1:02:33] it they didn't all see it the way that
[1:02:34] God wanted to see it where there's
[1:02:36] Wesley or the Pentecostals or even the
[1:02:38] old fashioned Salvation Army and other
[1:02:41] revivals that God started no no no they
[1:02:44] got they they were caught up with
[1:02:45] emotion they were caught up with the
[1:02:47] with the flesh but they didn't get the
[1:02:49] revelation of the word in their hearts
[1:02:51] you got to hear it a man by they by the
[1:02:54] year of the soul a man you got to see it
[1:02:57] as God wants you to see it in your soul
[1:03:00] not in your mind no no no that's that's
[1:03:04] what the withers Wesley yeah even Wesley
[1:03:07] and Luther and the Pentecostals at the
[1:03:10] beginning they got into it and I and
[1:03:12] they was all flesh hey man there they
[1:03:15] were looking at it through there through
[1:03:16] the mind then they were sensing
[1:03:17] everything's true through the flesh they
[1:03:19] wanted this they wanted that and Wesley
[1:03:21] couldn't see it the way that God wanted
[1:03:23] him to see it
[1:03:23] he never heard it the way God wanted him
[1:03:25] to hear a man God let him go and do this
[1:03:28] and go do that go do something else
[1:03:30] amen God God proved all those sayings
[1:03:32] and that Joel that led to I let Luther
[1:03:35] know that none of that works amen you're
[1:03:39] not justified by works and I justified
[1:03:41] by this and I just thought I buy that
[1:03:42] you're justified by Christ amen he
[1:03:46] mentioned Jesus justified us Jesus
[1:03:49] sanctified us Jesus filters with the
[1:03:51] Holy Ghost amen jesus didn't law hey man
[1:03:54] it is not me going to do this it is God
[1:03:57] by grace through faith are we justified
[1:04:00] amen by grace or favor sanctified by
[1:04:03] grace or favor filled with the Holy
[1:04:05] Ghost and it is by grace through faith
[1:04:07] that we are resurrected and raptured
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] what is the faith
[1:04:12] it is the revelation of what God is
[1:04:14] doing and what God has done God show
[1:04:18] Luther you're justified amen how do you
[1:04:20] show them that he showed him in the word
[1:04:22] a man he was going here he was going
[1:04:26] there he was doing this doing that and
[1:04:27] to finally he couldn't go any more he
[1:04:30] couldn't do anything else I don't know
[1:04:31] how to do he said I know finally he open
[1:04:33] up the Bible and he opened a lot to that
[1:04:35] right word there and it struck his heart
[1:04:38] it struck his soul a man it wasn't
[1:04:41] something he was just reading with his
[1:04:42] natural eyes
[1:04:44] no he was reading with the eye of the
[1:04:46] heart amen hallelujah and God spoke to
[1:04:51] him Alleluia and he heard it with the
[1:04:53] year of his soul let him that hath been
[1:04:55] here hear what the Spirit is saying to
[1:04:57] Luther amen and he heard it
[1:05:00] hey man and he just read that one verse
[1:05:03] of scripture and he struck him and you
[1:05:05] know hallelujah praise the Lord and as I
[1:05:08] said he picked up the marker there and
[1:05:11] he wrote on that Bible in that church
[1:05:13] he wrote alone hey man the just shall
[1:05:16] live by faith alone hey man and Luther
[1:05:20] and Wesley discovered the same thing
[1:05:21] where'd he get it from
[1:05:23] he got it from Wesley's Luther's
[1:05:25] teaching he did oh you got a friend
[1:05:27] Luther's teaching and on down brother
[1:05:30] there was the pet there was the
[1:05:31] Salvation Army and and they were
[1:05:33] bridging the gap between the Methodists
[1:05:35] and the Pentecostals and then where did
[1:05:37] the Pentecostals get where they wasn't
[1:05:39] what God was giving them even from the
[1:05:41] Salvation Army why because when when
[1:05:43] they were prayed they were preaching
[1:05:45] near the end of their ministries they
[1:05:47] were preaching what would order we need
[1:05:48] he said we need what they had on the day
[1:05:50] of Pentecost hey man we need the power
[1:05:53] of the Holy Ghost we need the anointing
[1:05:55] of the Holy Ghost amen we need this we
[1:05:57] need that and yeah our brother will
[1:06:00] remove that even his wife we was
[1:06:01] preaching then they were preaching those
[1:06:03] things they were teaching the people
[1:06:05] this is what we need because we got big
[1:06:07] churches we got lots of money and we got
[1:06:09] lots of people what we need now is the
[1:06:11] Holy Ghost amen that's what they were
[1:06:14] teaching what would he do they were
[1:06:16] appointing the people to the to the
[1:06:17] pentecost revival a mayor and brother
[1:06:20] going on the pentecost revival water
[1:06:22] water
[1:06:23] we looking for one of them for the
[1:06:24] resurrection of the rapture amen
[1:06:27] there's nothing else we're just a
[1:06:29] resurrection and the rapture so god help
[1:06:31] us whether they get into it brother let
[1:06:33] me say it's very very serious hey man if
[1:06:36] not some of you gonna get into with your
[1:06:38] natural eyes your natural ears no it's
[1:06:40] got to be the Holy Ghost in you it's got
[1:06:43] to be a revelation in your heart by the
[1:06:45] great that's gonna strike you and
[1:06:46] there's got a man brothers go to oh it's
[1:06:48] gonna strike in a in a way that's gonna
[1:06:51] make you serious it's gonna make you an
[1:06:55] absolute different person amen
[1:06:58] it made a Luther a different person in a
[1:07:00] Wesley a different person it made the
[1:07:01] Pentecostals different hey may brother
[1:07:04] how much more is there going to make the
[1:07:05] bride that's getting ready for the
[1:07:07] rapture and the resurrection amen
[1:07:09] it's separated Lutheran separator the
[1:07:11] Bay the Methodist its separated the
[1:07:13] Pentecostals that much greater it says
[1:07:15] the separation of those that's gone in a
[1:07:17] resurrection rapture amen brother it's
[1:07:20] the same thing you know in the Ministry
[1:07:22] of our Lord Jesus Christ hey man so it's
[1:07:25] going to be in the Ministry of mrs.
[1:07:27] Jesus Christ in this hour Amen he was
[1:07:30] totally absolutely separated a man from
[1:07:32] the front those in his generation they
[1:07:35] never understood him they couldn't catch
[1:07:36] though the revelation of what was going
[1:07:39] on in his life and they'll not catch the
[1:07:41] revelation what's going on in the Indian
[1:07:43] the bride a man they'll think you're
[1:07:45] crazy
[1:07:46] the other thing you lose you're losing
[1:07:48] your mind and so oh yeah they they
[1:07:50] thought there's something gone wrong
[1:07:52] with Jesus because why because he laid
[1:07:54] aside his shrines and his wonders and
[1:07:57] brother he even stopped to stop
[1:07:59] preaching amen
[1:08:01] prior to this thing that happened in the
[1:08:04] ministry of Malachi for in this last
[1:08:06] hour these last days a man and he said
[1:08:09] era and he got to the place where he
[1:08:11] stopped preaching this was not preaching
[1:08:12] that and he said in 1963 here I go he
[1:08:16] said back into evangelism
[1:08:17] hey man because he knew that the first
[1:08:20] poll was done the second bullet was done
[1:08:22] and now the third poll was finished a
[1:08:24] man died who's waiting on God to do what
[1:08:27] God was going to do for the bride hey
[1:08:29] man
[1:08:30] and only realized that if God was going
[1:08:32] to take him off the scene amen because
[1:08:35] way the
[1:08:36] there wasn't striking them right then he
[1:08:39] said that I'll let you sit down in a
[1:08:40] moment but it wasn't striking him right
[1:08:42] he said I know it's not striking us
[1:08:44] right he says not strike he you right
[1:08:46] and he says not striking me right hey
[1:08:49] man because he knew if it struck us
[1:08:51] right we go in the resurrection than the
[1:08:52] rapture amen
[1:08:54] he knew that's what it was ordained to
[1:08:56] do in this hour the Serb Pope was
[1:08:58] rapturing faith Amen sir brother sister
[1:09:02] we better get serious with the Word of
[1:09:04] God we better get serious with the truth
[1:09:06] we better get serious with Jesus hey man
[1:09:08] we're very serious with the revealed
[1:09:10] Word ain't man we better be looking for
[1:09:13] what Luther was looking for
[1:09:14] justification he got it
[1:09:15] amen and he saw the way that he needed
[1:09:18] to see it he heard it and he saw the way
[1:09:21] needed to see it it was they both the
[1:09:23] voice of the Holy Ghost speaking through
[1:09:25] the word same request me chamber the
[1:09:27] Pentecostals amen by the grace of God

[1:09:35] bright age and brothers going to make us

[1:09:43] the things you got the things you're
[1:09:45] enjoying in this life the things you

[1:10:20] gone yes or the grace of God brother
[1:10:23] it's serious I want to share with you
[1:10:26] and I will see if we have the Lord
[1:10:27] willing when we get to the message again

[1:10:31] hearing and see but in the mean though I
[1:10:34] want to share with you these scriptures
[1:10:36] and there's a quote here that I was
[1:10:38] going through our brother marks notes
[1:10:39] then he that he ministered on I guess
[1:10:43] three or four weeks ago whenever it was
[1:10:45] and I was going to print it trying to
[1:10:47] get into a pamphlet form
[1:10:49] and sure with you and I was going
[1:10:52] through this quote city here there by
[1:10:54] those by the prophet of God and and this
[1:10:57] quote struck me a man because there was
[1:10:59] something that I experienced on Monday
[1:11:01] night or early Tuesday morning they also
[1:11:04] want to share with you a man it's
[1:11:06] serious
[1:11:07] it is absolutely serious brother so I

[1:11:14] to hear what God wants us to hear and
[1:11:16] how that God wants us to hear it and
[1:11:18] we're going to see it with the eye of
[1:11:19] the soul the way that God wants us to

[1:11:24] attitude change our spirit change our
[1:11:26] motives and objectives amen
[1:11:28] by the grace of Almighty God a man is a
[1:11:31] serious brother well it was serious in
[1:11:34] the days of Jesus and the disciples knew
[1:11:37] there was something different about
[1:11:39] Jesus different about his ministry and
[1:11:41] the world is going to recognize
[1:11:42] something different about the bright a
[1:11:43] man and no wonder again is the profit
[1:11:46] Center if they got asked to pick out a
[1:11:48] dozen he said IB he'd be shocked
[1:11:51] yeah if he had to figure out a dozen and
[1:11:53] he said there might be he said so many
[1:11:55] thousand and then he brought it down to
[1:11:58] several hundred and he brought it down
[1:11:59] to five hundred two hundred whatever you
[1:12:01] know and so many he said they're dead a
[1:12:03] living Saints on the earth that'll go in
[1:12:06] the rapture it's not gonna be many
[1:12:08] anyway how do you know that

[1:12:13] shorten time to be no flesh st. case of
[1:12:16] God to us don't you take don't pop
[1:12:19] yourself up you better puff Jesus up a
[1:12:22] man that's not all eight ourselves and
[1:12:24] think we're somebody we're nobody

[1:12:30] Jesus and tell of his love
[1:12:32] amen and His divine law I'm not not
[1:12:36] natural of divine love by the grace of
[1:12:39] God and you wanna know the evidence of
[1:12:41] the Holy Ghost
[1:12:42] divine love a man because the Bible says

[1:12:47] even understand the mysteries understand
[1:12:49] this a new come heaven faith to move
[1:12:50] mountains and he said but if you don't

[1:13:00] this I can do that yeah where's your do
[1:13:02] you
[1:13:02] divine law grace of God there's power
[1:13:07] divine love is powerful hey man
[1:13:11] why because God is not and he is divine
[1:13:16] huh
[1:13:17] amen god help us sir let's hear the word
[1:13:21] the way God wants us to hear tonight
[1:13:22] as we'll get into this quote that had
[1:13:25] that our brother Mark had highlighted
[1:13:26] and maybe when when he administered on
[1:13:28] on the message what was the title that
[1:13:36] our brother Mark Minister doc what was
[1:13:40] it brother oh you can't remember what
[1:13:54] keeps me a man he was reaching out what
[1:13:59] keeps me and he did bring bring this
[1:14:01] quote not shared with you and I want to
[1:14:04] highlight to some experience that I had
[1:14:06] on Monday night or Tuesday morning in
[1:14:12] proverbs chapter 20 beginning to read a
[1:14:18] verse five counsel in the heart of man
[1:14:23] is like deep water but a man of
[1:14:27] understanding will draw it out they'll
[1:14:30] take counsel when how many is going to
[1:14:33] take counsel today no no they feel that
[1:14:38] they know what to do when to do it how
[1:14:40] to do it they know they feel they don't
[1:14:41] need any counsel and it says most men
[1:14:46] will proclaim everyone is own goodness
[1:14:49] but a faithful man who can find and his
[1:14:54] faithfulness to the Lord a man in his
[1:14:58] favorite of God he be faithful to the
[1:15:00] body of Christ but it said the just man
[1:15:03] walketh in his only in his integrity and
[1:15:06] his children are blessed after him a
[1:15:11] king that sitteth in the throne of
[1:15:14] judgment scatter the way all
[1:15:16] evil with his eyes who can say I have
[1:15:21] made my heart clean I am pure from my
[1:15:25] sin divers weights and divers measures
[1:15:29] both of them are alike abomination to
[1:15:34] the Lord even a child is known by his
[1:15:37] doings whether his work be pure or
[1:15:40] whether it be right a man the hearing
[1:15:46] ear
[1:15:47] and the scene I the LORD have made even
[1:15:53] both of them a man the hearing ear and
[1:15:59] the scene I the Lord has made even both
[1:16:01] of them a man so we think it's on the
[1:16:04] inside of the inside us in your soul
[1:16:06] amen
[1:16:07] it is the seed of God predestinated to
[1:16:10] to hear what God wants him to hear the
[1:16:13] way he wants him to hear and to see what
[1:16:15] God wants you to see and to see it the
[1:16:17] way God wants you to see it a man there
[1:16:21] are many different ideas about the end
[1:16:23] at the end of the day all time a man in
[1:16:26] what's going on now even what God is
[1:16:28] buried some see it this way some see it
[1:16:30] that way some are hearing this I'm
[1:16:31] hearing that but the bride is hearing
[1:16:33] the truth God is bright is hearing the
[1:16:36] way God wants her to hear a man and
[1:16:39] there's many around the message that are
[1:16:40] not hearing it the way they should
[1:16:42] amen you're not seen it the way they
[1:16:44] should as I said there's too many there
[1:16:47] they just see a prophet you know or they
[1:16:50] see this book or they see a tape or
[1:16:52] whatever no brother sisters you got to
[1:16:53] see Christ amen well be with but bear
[1:16:59] with me we didn't play attention to the
[1:17:02] work amen
[1:17:04] none it's not the excitement of the
[1:17:06] above a preacher brother it's it's it's
[1:17:09] a complicity of the word God is hidden
[1:17:13] and God is revealed in simplicity any
[1:17:17] man you talk with the Lord's prayers God
[1:17:19] in simplicity hey man
[1:17:22] praise the name of the Lord and yet
[1:17:24] brother we would left the impression
[1:17:26] around this message what get the
[1:17:27] impression that all that there
[1:17:29] there are many Christians out there they
[1:17:31] say all those that believe the measure
[1:17:33] with a random is that they won't say the
[1:17:35] Lord's Prayer oh yeah they left that
[1:17:38] impression and there very few that will
[1:17:41] repeat the Lord's Prayer we thank God
[1:17:44] for brother Carson's influence in
[1:17:47] getting us started and those things by
[1:17:50] the grace of God amen
[1:17:52] god help us brother so again the hearing
[1:17:56] ear and the scene i the lord have made
[1:17:58] even both of them a man I trust God has
[1:18:03] made your ear and he's made your eye
[1:18:06] that's in your soul god bless you may be
[1:18:09] seated
[1:18:12] turn with me to first Corinthians
[1:18:15] chapter 2 first Corinthians chapter 2
[1:18:26] and beginning to read at verse 6 howbeit
[1:18:35] we speak wisdom among them that are
[1:18:39] perfect yet not the wisdom of this world
[1:18:42] nor of the princes of this world that
[1:18:45] come to naught but we speak the wisdom
[1:18:49] of God in a mystery even the hidden
[1:18:54] wisdom which God ordained before the
[1:18:58] world unto our glory a man which none of
[1:19:05] the princes of this world knew for had
[1:19:08] they known it they would not have
[1:19:10] crucified the Lord of glory they didn't
[1:19:14] know it because they didn't hear the
[1:19:15] word the way they needed to hear it they
[1:19:19] didn't see it the way they needed to see
[1:19:21] it they never recognized the Ministry of
[1:19:25] our Lord Jesus Christ as the Ministry of
[1:19:28] the Messiah to them he was false to them
[1:19:34] as I have violated to a number of people
[1:19:37] that are keeping Saturday Sabbath I
[1:19:39] should they crucified Jesus for breaking
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:43] a man but Jesus says I am the lord of
[1:19:47] the Sabbath and that he could do what he
[1:19:50] wanted on the Sabbath but they they had
[1:19:53] a day that Abra legalize down to the
[1:19:56] just to the letter of the word and there
[1:19:58] are many today that I got he got the
[1:19:59] message legalize down to the letter of
[1:20:01] the message a man but there's a
[1:20:03] spiritual revelation that God wants us
[1:20:06] to hear and there's a spiritual
[1:20:08] revelation what God has done and what
[1:20:10] God is doing and that's what God wants
[1:20:12] us to see that's what God wants us to
[1:20:14] recognize it is not a recognizing God's
[1:20:17] and a prophet it is not just to
[1:20:19] recognize they God through the Provident
[1:20:21] and the Ministry of the Prophet that
[1:20:23] there was the old many of the seven
[1:20:24] seals we got that we got to get the
[1:20:26] revelation of why God did what he did
[1:20:29] why God sent that prophet and why God
[1:20:32] should their provenance for that
[1:20:34] ministry a man opened the mystery of the
[1:20:37] seven seals to the elect of God in the
[1:20:39] last days a man why did he show the
[1:20:42] probably with a three pull ministry
[1:20:44] why did you should a prophet to do this
[1:20:46] and do that and then take it away from
[1:20:48] him and just to speak the word a man
[1:20:51] there was that there was a reason for
[1:20:53] that a man so I pray God that we're
[1:20:55] going to see what God did it as I said
[1:20:58] for many years that he did all that was
[1:21:00] preached once God has sent a prophet God
[1:21:02] has sent a prophet
[1:21:03] God has sent a prophet help under 19 and
[1:21:06] 19 1972 it began to change and by 1977
[1:21:11] it was changed and for the greater part
[1:21:13] there were ministries of not preaching
[1:21:17] God's and a prophet but they were
[1:21:19] preaching the prophesy amen and so our
[1:21:23] brother
[1:21:24] Paula Fontaine brought out he said any
[1:21:27] and he brought that quote out with a
[1:21:28] prophet said we got a goal from the
[1:21:30] Prophet to the prophecy and we got to go
[1:21:33] from the messenger to the message a man
[1:21:36] so it was in the 19 and 70 so we began
[1:21:39] to get get away from the emphasis on
[1:21:41] William Brown and begin to get into the
[1:21:43] emphasis on our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:46] where we're moving from the prophecy to
[1:21:48] the from the Prophet to the prophecy and
[1:21:50] moving from a man by the grace of
[1:21:53] Almighty God from the mess
[1:21:55] to the message so god help us by the
[1:21:58] sister that we are getting more and more
[1:22:00] into the message we're getting more and
[1:22:03] more into what God wants us to hear and
[1:22:05] what God wants us to see in the message
[1:22:08] and it's not again it's not just all the
[1:22:10] Prophet came and the Prophet did this
[1:22:12] and the Prophet did the head and the
[1:22:14] same and the mystery of the seven seals
[1:22:16] was revealed and now we know this and
[1:22:19] now we know they had this doctrine that
[1:22:20] doctrine yeah but why did God do what he
[1:22:24] did
[1:22:24] amen he had a reason for doing what he
[1:22:27] did in lugar in Wesley in the
[1:22:28] Pentecostals and he had a reason for
[1:22:31] doing what he has done in the Ministry
[1:22:33] of William Branham in the Ministry of
[1:22:35] Malachi for a man but the Bible says
[1:22:38] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[1:22:39] children back to the father's as he has
[1:22:41] he turned your hearts back to the faith
[1:22:44] of our for our forefathers a man as he
[1:22:46] turned our hearts back to the faith of
[1:22:48] those in the Pentecostal revival as he
[1:22:51] turned our hearts back to those in the
[1:22:52] in Wesley survival in the Methodist
[1:22:54] revival even to those I on the day of
[1:22:56] Pentecost a man by the grace of Almighty
[1:23:00] God so brother there's many that don't
[1:23:03] recognize that they don't realize this
[1:23:05] is what God is looking for in them in
[1:23:08] their lives in their testimony what
[1:23:10] they're saying in what they're doing hey
[1:23:12] man it is the reflection of the message
[1:23:15] it has given them the faith that God
[1:23:17] wants them to have in this hour the part
[1:23:20] of God say concerning they will be the
[1:23:22] seven seals he said that it's the third
[1:23:24] pole and he's in the third and in the
[1:23:26] third pole he said his rapture II faint
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:30] her brother here there there there was a
[1:23:32] ministry as they said that God finally
[1:23:35] revealed justification to Luther
[1:23:37] sanctification to Wesley the baptism of
[1:23:39] the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the
[1:23:41] Spirit to the Pentecostals but now
[1:23:43] brother it is the coming of the Lord to
[1:23:46] the bright bright amen
[1:23:48] and there is an invisible union of the
[1:23:50] heavenly bridegroom and the early bride
[1:23:53] amen that Ikki came he came they came to
[1:23:56] redeem the bride now he has come to get
[1:23:58] the bright a man he has come to enter
[1:24:01] into a union with his bride a man why
[1:24:04] for it is
[1:24:05] take her take her to the marriage supper
[1:24:07] of the Lamb by the grace of Almighty God
[1:24:10] amen brother closer we to the to the
[1:24:12] rapture how close will be to the
[1:24:14] resurrection how much longer is God
[1:24:17] gonna let it go on amen brother hey it's
[1:24:20] been over 50 years now since they're
[1:24:22] going to the prophet
[1:24:23] it's been almost 60 years since the
[1:24:25] Rivini of the seven seals amen
[1:24:28] since the old me of the mystery of God
[1:24:29] to give a give the bride right through
[1:24:32] faith and brother we've been we've been
[1:24:34] preaching and ministering about the
[1:24:35] Prophet and we've been preaching and
[1:24:37] ministering about the message of the
[1:24:38] hour
[1:24:39] amen for all of these years not brother
[1:24:42] where where is our faith as it has it
[1:24:45] improved our faith as it increased our
[1:24:48] faith as it made our faith stronger amen
[1:24:51] brother we're living in a world we're
[1:24:54] living in a realm now where people are
[1:24:55] putting more and more and more faith in
[1:24:58] the natural things of life and less than
[1:25:00] the spiritual anymore there are plenty
[1:25:02] more lenses on the natural things I left
[1:25:04] side the spiritual things I'll tell you
[1:25:07] this whether we're seed of God and we're
[1:25:10] the sons and daughters of God we're
[1:25:12] going to put more emphasis on the
[1:25:13] spiritual and less and less and less on
[1:25:15] the natural amen
[1:25:17] why because we know what we see out
[1:25:19] there in the world now we know that the
[1:25:21] natural things of life this too shall
[1:25:23] pass away a man Jesus recognized what
[1:25:27] was going on in his ministry he realized
[1:25:29] he was coming down to the end of his
[1:25:31] ministry he realized the change in
[1:25:33] administering a man he realized that he
[1:25:36] was gonna have to lay down his life what
[1:25:38] he knew what he was he came for he knew
[1:25:40] what he was gonna do he knew what he had
[1:25:42] to do a man because he promised that he
[1:25:45] was going to stay true to his own word
[1:25:47] amen he was going to lay down his life
[1:25:49] for you and me lay down his life to
[1:25:51] redeem all the seed of God amen that
[1:25:54] were born in sin Satan iniquity come to
[1:25:57] the world speak unless a man go sing he
[1:26:00] was 33 years old brother not much is
[1:26:04] that night night not not very old when
[1:26:06] it comes to a young man he even back
[1:26:09] then at 33 years old
[1:26:11] and he recognized that he was coming to
[1:26:14] the end of that of his natural life a
[1:26:16] man why what was it based on it was base
[1:26:19] word human face on the word he knew it
[1:26:23] was written it was written hey man that
[1:26:26] he had the lead on his life a man and
[1:26:28] then when he was getting closer and
[1:26:30] closer and closer to the third pole you
[1:26:32] know he was as I said he was saying how
[1:26:35] much longer will I be with you he wanted
[1:26:39] to go anyhow oh yeah because he couldn't
[1:26:42] stand this the sin he couldn't stand the
[1:26:45] unbelief he wanted to get out of this
[1:26:46] world
[1:26:47] hey man how much longer would I be with
[1:26:49] you because we even he was he was
[1:26:53] experiencing more and more and more
[1:26:54] unbelief and less less and less and less
[1:26:58] faith amen
[1:27:00] under finally he made the statement when
[1:27:03] he prayed for the disciples and he
[1:27:05] prayed for the seed of God he pray for
[1:27:07] you and me
[1:27:08] amen in John chapter 17 and who finally
[1:27:12] said I am no more in the world what
[1:27:15] that's amazing
[1:27:17] amen he recognized that he was
[1:27:20] approaching that third Pole amen and in
[1:27:23] the third pole he was going to lay down
[1:27:24] his light pick it out and he was going
[1:27:26] from time to eternity again he was going
[1:27:28] back to where he come from that's like I
[1:27:31] said you know the scripture let me say
[1:27:33] it again many and he said there no man
[1:27:36] has ascended up to heaven only he that
[1:27:37] came down from heaven even the Son of
[1:27:39] man who is in heaven

[1:33:38] I believe it's already already in
[1:33:40] progress and brother the rapture is all

[1:34:25] Pentecostal revival message the prophet
[1:34:27] of God said God didn't do away with it
[1:34:28] he said he just laid it on shelf
[1:34:31] he said the Pentecost anointed kind of
[1:34:33] cost the gifts he said they're still
[1:34:34] buried there on the shelf
[1:34:35] he said if we need them mister they're
[1:34:38] there though I know there's ministries
[1:34:40] around the message that are preaching Oh
[1:34:42] God God did away with it
[1:34:44] there's gone now well there brother if
[1:34:46] God did away with that God did away with
[1:34:47] Luther's justification he did away with
[1:34:50] Wesley's sanctification no no no see
[1:34:53] it's God said I will restore and what he
[1:34:56] restored he's not gonna do away with
[1:34:57] it's gonna stay there what for but why
[1:35:01] because it's God building us up in our
[1:35:04] faith you can't take you can take
[1:35:06] justification away what are you what are
[1:35:09] you gonna put this this revelation of
[1:35:10] the rapture our God is building us up in
[1:35:14] the most holy faith right on off just to
[1:35:16] fit your brother since we got to have
[1:35:18] the revelation of justification we gotta
[1:35:20] have the revelation of st. of vacation
[1:35:21] we gotta have the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:23] Ghost amen and the anointing even the
[1:35:25] revelation of the gifts yeah so that God
[1:35:29] is their God and God is God and God we
[1:35:31] got is still the healer goddess - is God
[1:35:34] still there to do this for me God is
[1:35:36] still there to help me with this help me
[1:35:37] with that a man brother and when it
[1:35:40] comes to the gifts don't do away with
[1:35:41] that there's like a you see this
[1:35:45] progressive revelation of God in his
[1:35:48] children and its sons and daughters
[1:35:51] hey man it's like you take it taking
[1:35:54] your children and putting upon them in
[1:35:55] the elementary school but and maybe the
[1:35:58] junior ah but don't let him go to the
[1:36:00] high school
[1:36:01] oh wait didn't I do that they they can
[1:36:05] talk they can write they can read so
[1:36:07] they don't need to go on to the hot to
[1:36:09] the high the high school oh yes they
[1:36:12] need more and more and more and more see
[1:36:18] well for to give us the revelation of
[1:36:21] the will of God for this hour for this
[1:36:24] age amen by the grace of God is like
[1:36:28] when I was in school one time and
[1:36:32] and like I said I only got a grade 9
[1:36:34] diploma but I did go on to grade 11 and
[1:36:36] I remember in one grade you I don't know
[1:36:38] what grade it was but the teacher had
[1:36:40] put something on the board and it was it
[1:36:42] was mathematics and I don't know it
[1:36:44] might have been algebra well what did
[1:36:48] you call it anyway so I was always he
[1:36:50] said now he said I want you to solve
[1:36:52] this just this problem right here he
[1:36:55] says see if you can get the head and get
[1:36:56] the right answer so I looked at it oh
[1:36:59] that's simple so I and we did it on
[1:37:04] paper and then the teacher went around
[1:37:06] and looking at every student yeah you
[1:37:10] got it you got it yeah
[1:37:12] right right and then he looked at mine
[1:37:14] oh that's wrong I said wrong I said the
[1:37:22] answer is right oh yes he said the
[1:37:25] answer is right but you did it wrong I
[1:37:27] said well if I got a right answer what
[1:37:31] difference does the way I mean I did it
[1:37:32] as long as I got the right answer I
[1:37:35] sister the way I saw it and this is the
[1:37:38] way I did it I said and so on me I said
[1:37:42] you explained it and I heard it and I
[1:37:45] did it but he didn't make a correction
[1:37:51] there he just marked an X I didn't make
[1:37:54] it
[1:37:55] yeah even though I had right answer a
[1:37:58] man got Elvis brother that we're gonna
[1:38:01] have the right answer with the right
[1:38:03] spirit and the right of 19
[1:38:05] amen with the right revelation of the
[1:38:08] word this is what God does God has got
[1:38:12] us building us up building us up
[1:38:13] building herself brother amen
[1:38:15] to what praise the name of the Lord till
[1:38:18] we're not back here in the beginning God
[1:38:20] created the heavens of the earth period
[1:38:22] let's go on to find out why he did it
[1:38:26] amen what was his purpose and what is
[1:38:29] his pattern a man so brother got it got
[1:38:32] it
[1:38:32] what for God is raising up raising us up
[1:38:35] as sons and daughters of God he's
[1:38:37] building us up in the faith so we got
[1:38:41] more and more and more faith we're doing
[1:38:44] more in this hour
[1:38:45] than they did in Luther's day God
[1:38:47] requires more of us than he did in
[1:38:49] Wesley's day or the Pentecostal age even
[1:38:51] amen and they had tremendous revival
[1:38:54] around the world the Pentecostals a man
[1:38:56] with the gifts of the Spirit a man but
[1:38:59] now gospel person not just the gifts
[1:39:02] God's looking for the resurrection and
[1:39:04] the rapture as he said the dead in
[1:39:07] Christ are waiting on us and he said God
[1:39:10] is waiting on us but back then it wasn't
[1:39:14] striking them right why because the hour
[1:39:16] wasn't there for the resurrection the
[1:39:18] other wasn't there for the rapture
[1:39:20] that's why I said isn't he said he's not
[1:39:22] even striking me right william branham
[1:39:25] yeah why he wanted he wanted to be here
[1:39:29] for the rapture but then then he it
[1:39:31] began to dawn on him that he felt the
[1:39:33] Lord was gonna take him before the
[1:39:35] rapture and he said that's the will of
[1:39:37] God then he saw him ready I'm willing to
[1:39:39] go amen
[1:39:41] we're brothers a generation rising
[1:39:43] that's supposed to be ready for the
[1:39:45] rapture and if I'll tell you this if
[1:39:49] you're your ordained and you're gonna be
[1:39:51] part of that bride and you're gonna be
[1:39:53] part of the rapture I tell you this
[1:39:55] you're gonna have a different anointing
[1:39:57] a different atmosphere
[1:39:58] you're gonna think different act
[1:39:59] different live different a man you're
[1:40:03] gonna be as the word so a lot of people
[1:40:04] think you're in a world of your own but
[1:40:08] it's you and Jesus they felt Jesus was
[1:40:11] there just in a world of his own as I
[1:40:13] said there were the scribes and
[1:40:14] Pharisees talked to the disciples
[1:40:16] because why because it seemed like they
[1:40:18] couldn't communicate with Jesus after a
[1:40:20] while there was a time when they
[1:40:22] couldn't communicate with him why
[1:40:24] because he had set is faced toward
[1:40:26] Jerusalem and he knew what was going to
[1:40:30] happen there when he got the Jerusalem
[1:40:32] he wept and cried over Jerusalem knowing
[1:40:36] what was going to happen yeah brother
[1:40:39] wait we're gonna set our faces toward
[1:40:41] the New Jerusalem and give God the glory
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:46] that we're gonna sit with him and he's
[1:40:47] strong so I pray God grace amen
[1:40:52] that we're going to get we're gonna be
[1:40:53] totally absolutely different totally
[1:40:55] separate unto the Lord celebrated what
[1:40:58] for the resurrect
[1:40:59] the rapture listen before God brought
[1:41:01] Israel out of Egypt he separated them
[1:41:04] they were separated on to the Lord in
[1:41:07] Goshen yeah he said now he said all he
[1:41:12] said and they're all under all under the
[1:41:14] token blood of the Lamb that was slain
[1:41:17] why death was coming through Egypt and
[1:41:20] death is coming through this world the
[1:41:24] spirit of death spiritual death amen and
[1:41:28] as many of course were laid the foolish
[1:41:31] virgin will lay down their lives for the
[1:41:35] gospel they don't have the extra oil of
[1:41:38] the revealed word for this hour
[1:41:41] revealing the word we're giving this
[1:41:42] Resurrection a rapturing faith and so on
[1:41:44] they don't they don't see that they
[1:41:46] don't catch that amen
[1:41:47] but again the foolish virgin the Prophet
[1:41:49] said they're virgins so they go to the
[1:41:51] Great Tribulation yeah so just keep your
[1:41:56] attitude right your spirit right brother
[1:41:58] toward them but you haven't got the
[1:42:00] right attitude right spirit toward them
[1:42:02] you haven't got the right attitude right
[1:42:03] spirit right toward Jesus that's right
[1:42:06] whether we come to the hour of the
[1:42:09] resurrection the rapture you know it's
[1:42:14] not the world won't recognize it because
[1:42:15] there's gonna be so few that are gonna
[1:42:19] be separated unto the Lord that Jesus
[1:42:21] was he wept over Jerusalem to finally
[1:42:24] went on and did this and when I did that
[1:42:26] the funny went to get so many hey man
[1:42:31] what poor it was the example for you and
[1:42:37] me to let us know that we got to come to
[1:42:41] that place that he came to that we got
[1:42:43] to say what he said what was it not my
[1:42:48] will father dying be done just think of
[1:42:53] what he suffered what are we gonna
[1:42:55] suffer he was going to lay down his life
[1:42:59] and pick it up again yes he said no man
[1:43:02] takes it from me he gave up the ghost
[1:43:05] they never took her from you give it up
[1:43:08] yeah praise the Lord
[1:43:11] but he picked it up again and shared it
[1:43:13] with you and me and now he's now the
[1:43:15] fullness of the Godhead body is in the
[1:43:17] bright for the rapture for the
[1:43:21] resurrection Jesus raised that raised
[1:43:24] that body up again and it was in a
[1:43:26] glorified condition and of course he
[1:43:28] raised the Old Testament Saints up not
[1:43:30] all of them but most of them he raised
[1:43:32] him up and and when he went up they went
[1:43:34] up there was a resurrection and a
[1:43:36] rapture now there's a resurrection a
[1:43:40] rapture now for the bride for the
[1:43:43] Gentiles but it's going to be a mystery
[1:43:47] to the world and even a mystery to a lot
[1:43:50] of so-called believers but to do this
[1:43:53] the anointing is going to be on the
[1:43:55] bride it was on Jesus the bridegroom now
[1:43:59] he's going to be on the bride as I said
[1:44:02] the Alpha now the Omega the Alpha he
[1:44:08] redeemed our souls this Omega is
[1:44:10] redeeming our bodies grace
[1:44:20] let's see bear with me I said first
[1:44:25] Corinthians - six again verse nine but
[1:44:38] as it is written the I have not seen nor
[1:44:40] the ear heard neither have entered into
[1:44:43] the heart of man the things which God
[1:44:44] has prepared for them that love him but
[1:44:49] our eye is seen and our and the ear is
[1:44:54] hearing what God has prepared for us for
[1:45:01] them that love him the resurrection the
[1:45:03] rapture but God has revealed them unto
[1:45:07] us by his Spirit thank God for the
[1:45:11] spirit searcheth all things yea the deep
[1:45:15] things of God for what man knoweth the
[1:45:19] things of a man save the spirit of Man
[1:45:21] which is in him even so the things of
[1:45:25] God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God
[1:45:28] you got to have the Holy Ghost in you
[1:45:33] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:45:36] the world but the Spirit which is of God
[1:45:39] that we might know the things that are
[1:45:42] freely given to us of God amen
[1:45:46] grace of God go with me to chapter 15
[1:45:51] chapter 15 I read it not too long ago
[1:46:01] let's hear it again faith comes by
[1:46:05] hearing the word and the word that God
[1:46:12] will reveal is the word that's ordained
[1:46:15] for the hour in which we lived in first
[1:46:18] Corinthians 15 and verse 45 and so it is
[1:46:23] written the first man Adam was made a
[1:46:25] living soul and the last Adam was made a
[1:46:28] quickening spirit howbeit that was not
[1:46:31] first which is spiritual
[1:46:33] but that which is natural and afterward
[1:46:36] that which is spiritual the first man is
[1:46:40] of the earth earthy the second man is
[1:46:42] the lord from evam as is the earthy such
[1:46:46] are they that are earthy and as is the
[1:46:49] heavenly such are they also that are
[1:46:51] heavenly grace that were in the heavenly
[1:46:55] realm with the heavenly anointing and as
[1:47:01] we have borne the image of the earthy we
[1:47:04] shall also bear the image of the
[1:47:06] heavenly now this I say brethren that
[1:47:09] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:47:12] kingdom of God and neither doth
[1:47:14] corruption inherit incorruption the old
[1:47:17] I show you a mystery but brother
[1:47:21] it's a revealed mystery to you and me
[1:47:23] he-man because this is the hour when God
[1:47:27] is bringing it to pass and it says we
[1:47:31] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:47:34] changed the grace of God in a moment in
[1:47:40] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:47:43] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[1:47:46] the dead shall be raised incorruptible
[1:47:48] and we shall be changed for this
[1:47:54] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[1:47:59] this mortal must put on immortality
[1:48:04] brother what God has ordained to give us
[1:48:09] that faith God has done let me share
[1:48:14] with you the quote again that I got from
[1:48:19] our brothers notes and it's questions
[1:48:25] and answers on the seven seals 1963 pay
[1:48:34] attention
[1:48:37] to what the profit is warning the people
[1:48:42] it's a warning if there's ever an hour
[1:48:47] never an age that we that we ought to
[1:48:50] catch what he's saying is this is this
[1:48:52] hour is this is this time maybe they
[1:48:56] didn't fully catch what he was saying
[1:48:57] then but we ought to catch it now
[1:49:02] because we're living in a more serious
[1:49:04] hour now than they did it was serious
[1:49:09] then a man but yet God was still moving
[1:49:14] by his spirit over the earth the
[1:49:17] anointing that was in the atmosphere
[1:49:19] back then not the same anointing that's
[1:49:24] here now
[1:49:25] back then you could sense the Holy
[1:49:27] Spirit in in the atmosphere oh yeah but
[1:49:31] now you you don't brother it's not there
[1:49:34] no more now it's made flesh and the
[1:49:38] bride the Provost said the fullness of
[1:49:41] the Godhead bodily is now in the bride
[1:49:43] God was moving by his spirit here he was
[1:49:46] moving by his Spirit there there
[1:49:48] everywhere you all the atmosphere was
[1:49:50] was was filled with the anointing around
[1:49:54] the world but now no matter where I go I
[1:49:57] don't sense that atmosphere I don't
[1:50:00] sense that the anointing out there like
[1:50:03] it used to be know why people are not
[1:50:08] going to church like they used to people
[1:50:10] people don't respect God like they used
[1:50:12] to
[1:50:12] he we don't respect Christians like they
[1:50:14] used to be we don't respect church like
[1:50:17] they used to as I've said I've looked at
[1:50:19] a window one time and in in in a house
[1:50:23] that I was in and look out and there was
[1:50:25] a clergy from a denomination there and
[1:50:27] he was he was standing on the road and
[1:50:30] he had his hands laid on a man and he
[1:50:32] was praying for him what outdoors yeah
[1:50:39] her doors he apparently he was walking
[1:50:43] one way and that person was walking
[1:50:44] another and and he met this person and
[1:50:47] to begin to talk and their conversation
[1:50:49] no doubt maybe he got spiritual
[1:50:51] and I'm personal and and that that that
[1:50:53] gentleman wanted prayer and the and the
[1:50:56] clergy just he didn't didn't take a
[1:50:57] little work we'll go over it to the
[1:50:59] church we'll go into your house no no he
[1:51:01] just he just stood in the middle of the
[1:51:04] road oh yeah stood in the middle of the
[1:51:08] road ladies hands on him both hands and
[1:51:11] prayed for him where you gonna find that
[1:51:15] today you already find that in in the
[1:51:19] church let alone outside the church yeah
[1:51:22] brother grace of God seated the Holy
[1:51:26] Ghost is is pulling away now and the
[1:51:29] only at one time the anointing was there
[1:51:31] the non he was there the anointing was
[1:51:32] there now the anointing is in the bride
[1:51:34] for the resurrection in the rapture and
[1:51:36] it's so few oh yeah
[1:51:38] it's so few that you you can't sense it
[1:51:40] like you used to the only ones are gonna
[1:51:42] sense it are those that are going in the
[1:51:44] rapture and going into resurrection and
[1:51:49] I know many of you don't don't catch
[1:51:52] what I'm saying in that because you
[1:51:53] haven't experienced it but at 71 years
[1:51:58] old I've experienced it yeah brother the
[1:52:04] prophet of God referred to even lap
[1:52:06] overs from one age to another because he
[1:52:10] referred to our brother brother Willard
[1:52:12] Collins and he said brother Collins
[1:52:14] he says you're concerned about your
[1:52:16] father yes he said brother Ram I am he
[1:52:19] said don't worry brother he said he's
[1:52:21] going to be there he said you're
[1:52:23] concerned because yeah he did he said he
[1:52:25] didn't know he don't believe the message
[1:52:26] and he said don't see this and he don't
[1:52:28] see that and brother bounce with no
[1:52:30] brother he doesn't he said because he is
[1:52:32] from the previous age another age and he
[1:52:35] said he's part of a lap over he said
[1:52:38] into this age and he said he's going to
[1:52:41] be there and I think he was he was a
[1:52:44] Presbyterian yeah that was back then
[1:52:47] many many years ago and so he said just
[1:52:50] leave him with the Lord and move on
[1:52:51] yourself by the grace of God a man so
[1:52:55] just all we can do brother is just leave
[1:52:57] it and it was lap overs back then and
[1:53:00] when we first come to the message to his
[1:53:02] lap overs I didn't look down on him just
[1:53:04] because he
[1:53:05] in a denomination or in this church or
[1:53:07] in that church because why I knew I knew
[1:53:09] that even the Spirit of God was still if
[1:53:11] I measure in that church the Spirit of
[1:53:13] God my measure was in that church I said
[1:53:15] I was sense the anointing with that
[1:53:17] person and with the other person a man
[1:53:18] but as time went on they got less and
[1:53:21] less and less and not only that brother
[1:53:24] there they there recognized it in
[1:53:25] themselves now because as that sister
[1:53:29] told me when she was in a certain
[1:53:31] denomination or church over there and
[1:53:32] not long there long ago and she's an old
[1:53:34] brother she said I was talking about
[1:53:36] water work what things were getting like
[1:53:37] yes he said you're right she said
[1:53:39] because she said there's there's I don't
[1:53:41] know if she says anybody in our church
[1:53:43] now she said less than 50 years old she
[1:53:46] said everybody is just seniors and
[1:53:48] getting older and so on but she said all
[1:53:50] the young people are not going or
[1:53:51] they're pulling away he said him well
[1:53:53] she said one time she saw used to even
[1:53:55] teach the Sunday School but she says no
[1:53:57] one there to teach now and a lot of
[1:54:01] churches are experiencing the same thing
[1:54:02] that the young people are pulling away
[1:54:04] not only that there's messy churches
[1:54:06] experiencing the same thing that there's
[1:54:08] less and less and less young people
[1:54:10] coming in and being a part of this and
[1:54:12] part of that so brother I pray the grace
[1:54:14] of God help us
[1:54:15] amen then when we see all these things
[1:54:18] happen brother we know that the
[1:54:20] anointing is the anointing is in the
[1:54:21] resurrection now in the rapture that's
[1:54:23] what God is looking for in you and me
[1:54:26] it's not all preach this doctrine preach
[1:54:28] this stuff preach that doctrine brother
[1:54:30] let's get in the resurrection let's get
[1:54:33] in the rapture it's not just did not not
[1:54:38] have a denomination of doctrines and
[1:54:40] doctrines and doctrines let's let's get
[1:54:42] and do what Jesus wants us to do or less
[1:54:45] yield ourselves for Jesus to do what he
[1:54:47] wants to do and that's the resurrection
[1:54:50] I show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:54:54] sleep but we should all be changed amen
[1:55:01] in questions and answers on the seals he
[1:55:08] said all of you are conscious and know
[1:55:12] that there's something mysterious
[1:55:14] happening and it is happening and he
[1:55:20] said I know what it is but they didn't
[1:55:26] and he said I'm not saying that it's the
[1:55:30] grace of God that lets me know what it
[1:55:33] is and it'll be the grace of God to let
[1:55:36] the bride know that the rapture and the
[1:55:40] resurrection is upon us and God is now
[1:55:44] requiring the rapture and the
[1:55:46] resurrection well don't wait for God to
[1:55:52] do it he's waiting for you to do it
[1:55:55] whether all that God has done is to give
[1:55:58] us that faith yeah he said the OB the
[1:56:04] Seventh Seal with the third pole rapture
[1:56:06] in faith and he said he said it's
[1:56:15] something that's tremendous and it's
[1:56:17] gone right now and there's not a way in
[1:56:21] the world for you to see it but so help
[1:56:25] me with the Bible in my hand he said I
[1:56:28] know what it is he knew but they didn't
[1:56:35] he may it's like he preached in
[1:56:39] jeffersonville how can I overcome
[1:56:42] because why because there are a lot of
[1:56:45] believers in his Tabernacle that were
[1:56:47] not overcomers they never had the faith
[1:56:51] that God was looking for oh you rebuke
[1:56:54] them and he said I'll keep preaching
[1:56:57] until you stop doing it he says so help
[1:57:01] me with this Bible in my hand I know
[1:57:04] what it is it's been told to you before
[1:57:08] so just don't try to put any
[1:57:10] interpretation but just believe me
[1:57:13] as your brother we're living in a great
[1:57:17] hour
[1:57:18] yeah because got what we need in this
[1:57:22] hour God was doing back here and that
[1:57:26] was the opening of the seven seals the
[1:57:28] Rivini of the mystery of God to give the
[1:57:30] bride rapturing faith a man to give us
[1:57:33] the revelation of what God was doing
[1:57:35] what God was focusing on now what we're
[1:57:38] focusing on the resurrection the rapture
[1:57:43] each then has been told you before so
[1:57:46] just don't try to put any interpretation
[1:57:48] but just believe me as your brother
[1:57:50] we're living in a great hour will you
[1:57:53] just be real humble be a Christian try
[1:57:57] to live for God and live honest with
[1:58:00] your fellow man and love those who don't
[1:58:05] love you he said you see you only may
[1:58:10] commit a mysterious something and missed
[1:58:13] a real program of you mess rather not
[1:58:16] miss it but any SS you messed a real
[1:58:19] program of God up brother I tell you
[1:58:22] there's a lot of people messing it all
[1:58:24] up it's going they're going on with this
[1:58:27] doctrines going with that doctrine
[1:58:29] leading the people astray here stray
[1:58:31] they're focusing on this focusing on
[1:58:33] that brother it's God in simplicity
[1:58:37] justification in Luther Wesley bad son
[1:58:39] sanctification name we know the gifts of
[1:58:42] the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:43] but what's next it's the resurrection in
[1:58:47] the rapture and as I said that simple
[1:58:52] detail when it comes to the mr. mystery
[1:58:55] is raised how God is doing it but it's
[1:58:58] going to be very very simple so simple
[1:59:00] people are going to miss it
[1:59:03] why am I tell you that the resurrection
[1:59:08] the rapture is gonna be such a simple
[1:59:10] thing
[1:59:15] it has come between you and God but you
[1:59:20] got to be sensitive to what God's doing
[1:59:23] you gotta be sensitive to the
[1:59:25] resurrection and rapturing faith you
[1:59:28] gotta be you got to grow more and more
[1:59:30] into resurrection or atrophy
[1:59:32] you've got become more and more
[1:59:34] conscious of the resurrection and of the
[1:59:36] rapture more and more conscious of
[1:59:38] eternity more and more conscious of the
[1:59:40] kingdom of God anybody you're gonna you
[1:59:42] you will if you're if you're spiritual
[1:59:44] and living in the spirit walking in the
[1:59:46] spirit by the grace of God you're just
[1:59:48] going to get a totally different
[1:59:49] atmosphere totally different feeling
[1:59:51] around you and in you that you are
[1:59:55] you'll be like Christ I am no more in
[1:59:57] the world Norah and now I know I'm more

[2:00:05] less and less effect on me less and less
[2:00:08] influence in my life Lord eternity is
[2:00:12] getting more influence that's gonna be
[2:00:15] the resurrection of rapture it's gonna
[2:00:19] be very simple it'll be the life you're
[2:00:21] living oh yes in reflecting the life
[2:00:25] that you're living he said just be a
[2:00:29] real humble be a Christian try to live
[2:00:32] for God and live honest with your fellow
[2:00:34] man I love those who don't love you hmm
[2:00:37] is this tremendous you see you only make
[2:00:42] it a mysterious something and mr. and
[2:00:45] miss the real program of God up and I'll
[2:00:48] tell you brother there's a lot of there
[2:00:49] that's messed up the message there
[2:00:52] because of the way they're teaching it
[2:00:54] and what and how they're teaching it and
[2:00:56] what they're putting the emphasis on and
[2:00:58] so on they've got it they're making a
[2:01:00] mess out of it he said yesterday
[2:01:04] afternoon something happened in my room
[2:01:06] that I'll never be able to leave it you
[2:01:11] see he said about two weeks ago
[2:01:13] something happened that'll never be able
[2:01:15] he says long as I live on this earth
[2:01:18] I'll never be able to get away from it
[2:01:24] well brothers for the preaching of the
[2:01:26] word
[2:01:27] and the mystery of God made flesh and
[2:01:30] the bride there's something gonna happen
[2:01:32] in your life you're not gonna be able to
[2:01:33] get away from it's going to take
[2:01:36] preeminence over over all the natural
[2:01:39] things of life yeah what you're putting
[2:01:45] the emphasis on really indicates whether
[2:01:49] your spiritual or not spiritual well
[2:01:54] brother no we can't do this can't do
[2:01:55] that oh yes this to comforted an African
[2:01:59] think this to just passed away
[2:02:01] god help us he said I'll never be able
[2:02:11] to get away from it
[2:02:12] and so the church you're not supposed to
[2:02:16] know these things so don't put no
[2:02:19] interpretation to anything you just go
[2:02:22] ahead and just remember what you're told
[2:02:24] live a Christian life go to your church
[2:02:29] yeah knobbly or sting kill they don't
[2:02:34] even go to church that's true they feel
[2:02:38] they don't have to go to church the
[2:02:40] Bible says forsake not the assembling of
[2:02:42] yourselves together and much more as she
[2:02:45] see the Day approaching man we would
[2:02:49] take a vote have served some Sunday
[2:02:51] night as well as Sunday morning as I
[2:02:55] said one time they would have services
[2:02:58] three or four times a week I think our
[2:03:03] brother car does well god bless them hey
[2:03:07] man yeah and now it's getting less and
[2:03:11] less and less oh yeah why because work
[2:03:16] more caught up with natural things than
[2:03:18] spiritual how many are willing to do as
[2:03:24] Jesus did lay down your life as he lay
[2:03:28] down as you lay down yours as he
[2:03:31] sacrifice what he sacrificed that our
[2:03:33] sacrifice
[2:03:38] how real is eternity great stress so he
[2:03:47] said go to your church be a real light
[2:03:51] wherever you are and just burn for
[2:03:55] Christ and tell the people how you love
[2:03:59] him and just let your testimony be with
[2:04:04] love all the time with the people hey
[2:04:07] man this is tremendous but this is the
[2:04:09] bride that's the right let your
[2:04:14] testimony be would love all the time
[2:04:16] with the people because if you don't you
[2:04:19] if you don't you twist yourself out into
[2:04:21] something there and he said then you're
[2:04:23] off the beaten track see every time you
[2:04:26] try to do it he said you've done that so
[2:04:30] just don't try to make no interpretation
[2:04:32] and especially tonight when that seal
[2:04:35] becomes up in front of you again they
[2:04:45] are interpreting the seals they're
[2:04:46] adding to the revelation of the seals
[2:04:48] they're taken away from the revelation
[2:04:50] of the seals leave it the way that it is
[2:04:56] don't make it bigger than what it is or
[2:04:58] smaller than what it is grace of God and
[2:05:05] that said that shield is referring to as
[2:05:07] the seventh seal so he said just don't
[2:05:10] try to interpret it just go ahead and
[2:05:13] just be humble and go right on with the
[2:05:16] same plain message hey plain there's a
[2:05:22] lot of preachers making it complicated
[2:05:24] it's not very plain it's not simple
[2:05:28] dietary this the prophet of God revealed
[2:05:31] the simplicity of what God was God has
[2:05:34] done and what God is doing amen brother
[2:05:40] the ministry couldn't explain it other
[2:05:43] ministries couldn't explain it but the
[2:05:45] prophet of God came with the revelation
[2:05:46] of God's plan and purpose and he showed
[2:05:49] us
[2:05:50] the seven seals are the seven churches
[2:05:52] and he showed us the seventh the seven
[2:05:56] seals and so on and the stature of a
[2:05:59] perfect man grace of God to us grace
[2:06:03] grace grace brother again you know the
[2:06:15] prophet of God said if you look at that
[2:06:17] picture and if you see anything more
[2:06:20] than that pillar of fire he said he said
[2:06:23] you're not seeing it right you're not
[2:06:26] looking at it right he said it why you
[2:06:29] got don't don't look at William Branham
[2:06:31] he said look at the pillar of fire amen
[2:06:35] as I said about that sister that was in
[2:06:37] the hospital and she had that picture on
[2:06:39] on the table next to her bed in hospital
[2:06:41] and she looked at it she was praying she
[2:06:44] looked at it
[2:06:44] and when she looked at it she looked at
[2:06:46] the pillar fire and the pillar of fire
[2:06:48] began to move from the picture to her
[2:06:51] and she was healed
[2:06:55] hey Mary but we got a look at not
[2:06:58] William Branham we got a look at Jesus
[2:07:00] Christ and not only that when he pointed
[2:07:02] to the clouds and the cloud of angels
[2:07:04] see he said there he is looking down at
[2:07:07] us he said in the cloud of angels but he
[2:07:10] said one the one the last message he
[2:07:12] preached he pointed the cloud ISA see
[2:07:14] there he is looking down at us and he's
[2:07:17] you can see his eyes there's his eye
[2:07:18] there as I there a main anise tea it's

[2:07:41] he said I was cut up cuz he is he was
[2:07:44] attracted to the seventh angel yeah
[2:07:50] is God in simplicity oh they're trying
[2:07:55] to figure out where did that cloud come
[2:07:58] from
[2:07:58] they said this it was too high to be a
[2:08:00] natural cloud and there was no planes or
[2:08:03] anybody anything that had gone by to
[2:08:05] make that cloud they said oh yeah I got
[2:08:09] I've got the scientists the science

[2:08:23] was no no no Club no no no planes no
[2:08:27] jets no nothing there and they said it's
[2:08:31] too high to be a natural cloud because
[2:08:33] they said it would you wouldn't be able
[2:08:35] to have the the moisture up there to
[2:08:37] make a cloud and so on so they don't
[2:08:39] know what it was and as I said maybe

[2:08:54] look at this cloud and they they got
[2:08:57] this and this in in the end in the
[2:08:59] magazine and as I said if you want to
[2:09:02] older magazine up that that page and
[2:09:05] when you look through the page what do
[2:09:07] you see on the other side a rainbow and
[2:09:11] they were and you opened it Oh rainbow
[2:09:15] yeah but again even that was a mystery
[2:09:19] why if a picture was taken in taken in
[2:09:23] Mexico at midnight and they said this is
[2:09:27] the this is the rainbow at midnight in
[2:09:30] Mexico and it's amazing that they
[2:09:34] printed that picture and that mystery on
[2:09:36] one side of the page and on the other
[2:09:39] side the page they printed the angels of
[2:09:41] God that wasn't that wasn't just
[2:09:46] accidental I think God ordained that a
[2:09:49] man why why if that brother that's
[2:09:54] revelation 10 because the mighty angel
[2:09:58] came down for the opening of the seven
[2:10:00] seals the mystery of the seven seals
[2:10:02] with a rainbow over easy
[2:10:07] revelation 10 old brother though do Tago
[2:10:11] a witness to the world the world the
[2:10:13] world's been witness to a man and the
[2:10:17] world has being witness to as I say
[2:10:19] concerning our the homepage that our
[2:10:25] brother Mark and myself did a mint with
[2:10:30] over 2 million hits and this banner
[2:10:33] that's been around the world I receive I
[2:10:36] received the emails from from even
[2:10:38] royalty yeah in certain countries I've
[2:10:43] received emails from other countries
[2:10:45] that are not Christian not allowed that
[2:10:46] Christians stopped and wanted to know if
[2:10:48] they could download and print the things
[2:10:51] on our homepage yeah so we the brethren
[2:10:58] through their printing I have ministered
[2:11:00] to over 62 countries yeah and I would
[2:11:05] say there's a lot more than that we
[2:11:07] don't know about that's the countries we
[2:11:09] know about and then and again as I said
[2:11:12] before that brother told us that that a
[2:11:14] 1988 as a result of printing that the
[2:11:17] Brethren did and that's before the home
[2:11:21] page as we saw the printing that we did
[2:11:23] then the brothers printed it I remember
[2:11:28] another mark typing it typing out of
[2:11:30] booklet or something pregnant and then
[2:11:33] the sisters sitting all around to
[2:11:35] collate the paid the booklets and so on
[2:11:38] and the brother told me that as a result
[2:11:40] of all of that that we had started at
[2:11:44] 1988 over 300 churches in Africa alone
[2:11:49] and he said brother they're still
[2:11:53] growing
[2:11:54] I said well praise the Lord to God be
[2:11:58] the glory
[2:11:59] this is tremendous brother so we thank
[2:12:03] God we don't not gonna take the glory to
[2:12:05] ourselves we'll give the glory to God
[2:12:08] amen so it was it was the Lord that was
[2:12:11] moving on our brother mark when he
[2:12:13] called me and asked me but putting the
[2:12:15] message on on
[2:12:17] that's right because back then there in
[2:12:20] 1995 there wasn't not one one answer to
[2:12:26] the to the name William Branham it was
[2:12:29] zero he got one he got one reply to the
[2:12:33] name Branham and that that had to do
[2:12:35] with some sort of a sport that something
[2:12:38] that I did there was a there was
[2:12:39] somebody there named Brent him and he
[2:12:41] was proud of a sport I'm not sure what
[2:12:43] the sport was and football I don't know
[2:12:45] what it was and so on but bolding okay
[2:12:51] no bowling so that's how it was so I
[2:12:56] said okay I said let's go I'm not just
[2:12:59] gonna cost and then we'll if we can do
[2:13:02] it we'll put it up so it's up that was
[2:13:06] the first reference to William Branham
[2:13:09] and the message thank God
[2:13:12] to God be the glory brother yeah brother
[2:13:21] god help us
[2:13:23] I believe it's finished now it's over
[2:13:27] with now he said just don't interpret
[2:13:33] nothing if God wants you to know
[2:13:35] anything you'll send it to you so just
[2:13:38] be real real solid now all still
[2:13:44] something has happened
[2:13:46] he said you understand what I mean don't
[2:13:49] you if you can't understand it he said
[2:13:53] this is that third pole he said you
[2:13:56] should have caught it the other day you
[2:13:59] remember there be no impersonation like
[2:14:03] there was of the other two poles he just
[2:14:07] said - but it's the two poles he's
[2:14:09] referring to a man and he said there be
[2:14:13] no one person there was impersonations
[2:14:15] of the other two poles but they couldn't
[2:14:18] impersonate this certain third Pole they
[2:14:21] condemned as
[2:14:24] I said and it's on the internet they
[2:14:26] said we don't brand I made these two
[2:14:27] signs he had these two two two two
[2:14:31] things that he did when it comes to the
[2:14:33] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[2:14:35] the heart and and the sign in his hand
[2:14:37] and so on but he said how do you
[2:14:39] reconcile somebody with those signs how
[2:14:42] can you reconcile that and the message
[2:14:45] that he preached they said this that's a
[2:14:49] mystery well it's a mystery that the
[2:14:51] bright understands they don't understand
[2:14:54] no because they think is his message was
[2:14:57] false and they can't reconcile it with
[2:15:00] with the signs that he had so thank God
[2:15:03] brother for what God has done and what
[2:15:06] God is doing he saw things that he
[2:15:10] wouldn't tell us he experienced things
[2:15:13] that he wouldn't tell us and he also
[2:15:14] said he said I got things in my heart he
[2:15:18] said that'll easily be there he said
[2:15:20] when I go he wouldn't tell us he saw
[2:15:24] things that that maybe we're seeing now
[2:15:28] and he saw things that we won't see but
[2:15:31] he saw it and it struck him he knew that
[2:15:36] we are we were at the end of the world
[2:15:39] surely we know we're at the end of the
[2:15:41] world surely we know that we're reaching
[2:15:43] the time of the resurrection and the
[2:15:45] rapture but I'll tell you that anointing
[2:15:48] it's going to bring us to a greater and
[2:15:50] greater separation it's going to cut us
[2:15:54] off more and more cut us off from the
[2:15:56] world and the things of the world it's
[2:16:01] like I said it was a dream that I had on
[2:16:07] Monday night or early Tuesday morning
[2:16:09] for me to explain it I can't do it but
[2:16:16] all I know is that it was the rapture
[2:16:22] yes they said the rapture yes they were
[2:16:27] difficult to explain it's something that
[2:16:31] I experienced in the dream and I saw my
[2:16:41] glorified body it was I was up there I
[2:16:48] can't I can't explain even in what I
[2:16:51] what I was sensing not feeling it's not
[2:16:53] feeling his it's faith and I was
[2:16:59] wondering what was going on what's going
[2:17:00] on what's going on moving here moving
[2:17:03] they're moving they're moving there and
[2:17:04] then then it's like I wasn't subject to
[2:17:07] to the to the dimension or or the
[2:17:10] atmosphere anything it's like you you
[2:17:13] were you were just floating around just
[2:17:17] floating around I said what's going on
[2:17:19] and then there was a revelation it's the
[2:17:23] rapture it's sir rapture there is your
[2:17:29] glorified body and I was looking looking
[2:17:34] looking looking reaching for but then I
[2:17:38] woke up I said oh lord I would lay back
[2:17:43] in on the bed and tried and trying to
[2:17:45] trying to get back into it again trying
[2:17:48] to get back into it again
[2:17:49] no it was gone I said oh oh Lord
[2:17:55] I'll share it with the people and let
[2:17:58] him know that we're approaching that
[2:18:01] hour they don't know that this is this
[2:18:05] is the time for them to reach out to
[2:18:07] their glorified bodies yeah see the dead

[2:18:14] prophets said they're going to appear to

[2:18:24] are but he said we're gonna go instantly

[2:18:28] said instantly we're gonna be changed
[2:18:30] not glorified by theophany bodies and
[2:18:32] instantly will be changed to glorified
[2:18:34] bodies and then he said they're being
[2:18:38] glorified bodies the dead in Christ and
[2:18:40] then he said we look up and he said oh
[2:18:44] that pillar of fire will have gone back
