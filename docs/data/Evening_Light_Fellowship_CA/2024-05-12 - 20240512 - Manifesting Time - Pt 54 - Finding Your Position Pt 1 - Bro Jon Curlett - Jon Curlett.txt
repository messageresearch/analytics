found in you Lord so we want to just say we love you this morning Lord we appreciate you Lord and we want our lives to glorify you day by day Lord help us to reflect you Lord that this world can see you we pray Lord just take this simple message this morning Lord may it just fill our hearts and souls Lord may you speak to your people we ask we're asking you in Jesus Christ's name this morning amen and amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and God bless you each one it's a typical New Finland spring day it's rainy and it's windy and it's blustery amen but I was just sitting in the office and I was saying Lord thank you for this solid building he's given us and people that'll come in and gather in and worship under his name amen we're gathered under the banner of his name this morning certainly want to wish the mothers a Happy Mother's Day and then I was reading brother Jason dear shared a quote this morning he was I'll summarize it quickly and brother Braham said Womanhood is the backbone of the nation not fatherhood motherhood motherhood is the backbone of the nation how did he Define Womanhood he said it is the fine virtue that God gave for a woman to be a mother Hallelujah sisters you are in rare rare company today amen that God would call you scripture says that a woman will be saved in childbearing if they continue in the faith you know we look at that and the world would scoff at that how how masculine is that that's a a malale dominated idea no that's a god idea Amen to express those things and you know I've talked about this many times with my wife and I believe it God gives her childbearing to save her from herself you look at that God gives us fatherhood to save us from ourselves Amen on fatherhood it takes the man out of that Beast nature and it commits him to one but that woman is temp tempted to be drawn away she's tempted to be drawn away as Eve was and so God gave her God made her God put a desire in her to produce and and bear and and raise children and it saves her from what this world will give her otherwise because this world takes women and it spits them up and chews them up and spits them out and turns them out and they're more like a man than half the men today and what a shame that is when they could be such wonderful woman so I'm thankful we have Godly mothers I'm thankful for my Godly mother my mother went through a lot she went through a lot and she stayed true to God and God stayed true to her and I'm so thankful for that this morning amen so God bless you richly man it's good to see brother Paul and brother Wesley back with us as well amen and I certainly appreciated our annual special from sister Amber amen God bless you it is just wonderful it is just wonderful I so appreciate that and sister Lydia as well there you are used to you sitting a bit left amen well done well done she's uh really coming forward in her plane and you can see the the practice and the effort that's gone in there so God bless you both for that amen I'm praying for the day when we get two or three or maybe even four a year but we know we know I'm I'm teasing her I know and she's smiling she's taking it graciously um for now but um you know those things have to be led they have to be led you we'll get into it a bit this afternoon maybe Lord willing but in all things we have to be led amen we can have a gift and some gifts are very evident but the gift has to be anointed that's it it's that simple and so we can get up and we can make a wonderful noise and people could say what a wonderful thing it is but if it's not anointed it is a tinkling symbol that's all it is amen so God bless you certainly appreciated that this morning Ephesians 4 Amen in verse 7 says but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're turning yet another page and I want to take a a title this morning of finding your position and we're going to spend at least a couple services on this we've been speaking on adoption and we know that in the biblical ense adop option is the placing of the children into their foreordained position in the body of Christ and that position is what gives us our purpose day by day amen we're not supposed to go through our lives just saying well I'm just going to live my life today no we ought to live our lives with purpose we ought to say this is the day that the Lord has made I'll rejoice in it I'm going to do what he's called me to do and what I'm doing more importantly is what he has called me to do amen our will ought to be what God to find the will of God in our daily lives and then if we do that then whatever happens our our life is in his hands we've committed our life into his hands we've laid ourselves at his feet and said Lord use me and so whatever comes then we say Lord that's you working in my life for purpose and with that we know with that position with that purpose comes responsibility comes power comes Authority comes expectations benefits promises and until we're fully in position we can't realize all of those things God's trying to build us up to the place where he can use us where God can flow through us we we sang that song or sister Amber sang that song you know flow through me Holy Spirit when we're fully in position and we're surrendered the Holy Spirit can flow through us in a special way and that's when we get the greatest blessings in our life and sometimes what all God's waiting for us to do is recognize that where we are and what we're doing is exactly our adopted position and what happens then is we start to realize that God has ordained us to be here that God is in the things that we're doing and all of a sudden we can invite God we can expect God we can believe God for things that perhaps we didn't believe before I want to remind of a quote I read just a couple Services ago about the children of Israel on the way to Canaan as we talk about finding your position he said you're bound for the promised land amen how many are bound for the promised land this morning amen what is the promised land brother Braham said the promised land is the Holy Ghost in action in The Believer that's what it is it's the fullness of the Holy Ghost in our lives he says like God said to Joshua a very type of the new ones coming out he said you've been on this mountain for 40 years wandering around and what did they do out there those 40 years did God curse them no he blessed them he says oh they married wives they grew good crops they raised babies they had a wonderful time he says God was with them but it still wasn't the promise they W went out there and they had no needs Church their clothes lasted 40 years I'm sure the sisters hated it cuz they never had to go get a new one the clothes never wore out the shoes never wore out the food was always there they had water when they needed it they had animals they had protection they had all of these things they had a cloud by day to keep the sun off of them they had a pillar of Fire by night to keep them safe so they could see all these things and yet they weren't living in the promise what's brother Braham saying he's saying you can be living a good clean Christian Life and not be in the promise you can be walking around and living to the best of your ability and you can have everything that this life needs but you may not be in the promise and when we don't just look at the provision of God in our day-to-day lives and say that's what makes me a Christian or that's what proves it because outside of Canaan God still met every need why because they were part of the family amen but they had to step up from being children to being adults they had to step into the promise they had to step into the inheritance and that's when you found out who really had it and who didn't who was just a part of the family and who was really going to live like they were a part of the family they were dead men walking they were living in a rut under the perfect blessing blessings of God but not the complete and full blessings Amen to live according to their full privileges they had to take the word of God and act on it that's what you'll see as we come into maturity as we come into adoption is we're acting on the word day by day you young people you can sit at home and you can sit there and Mom and Dad can pay for the roof over your house and they can pay for the food that you eat and you can sit there and you can relax and you can chill and everything's good but there's no satisfaction in that because what the nature of a child is to receive that's what children love they love gives my my youngest one is always telling me maybe we could buy me this maybe we could buy me that his latest one is a Lamborghini for the family maybe we could buy that for the family dad maybe we could do that this morning he said maybe we could buy a racing van with a spoiler on it a GT I said no no we're not going to do that well maybe we could get a blue one this is what he thinks everything is about getting and getting and getting and that's the childish nature amen but Jesus said it's more blessed to give than to receive amen and sometimes the issue is that we are sitting around and we are getting getting getting and we're never giving and then we wonder why life is not satisfying that's exactly the way it is you know sometimes the biggest problem with people trying to enjoy life is that they're trying to enjoy life the enjoyment comes from contrast it comes from giving and receiving it comes from doing and sitting still it comes from relaxing and working there's nothing more better at night than to lay your head down after having worked hard if we've sat around all day that's when we can't sleep when we're doing nothing we've got nothing to actually put us to sleep and most people are just trying to tick the next item on their bucket list and then they wonder why their life is empty it's because all they're doing is trying to get get get rather than to give give give that's some of the saddest most depressed people on the Earth you'll find is the ones that have everything there there's this this game out there and it's such a simple game it's all blocks called Minecraft the guy that sold it sold it for3 billion and they asked him they said how do you feel about this you know you're you're so wealthy he says I hate it he says because I can get anything I want and I don't have to wait for it he says and I can't trust people because they're after my money he says I don't have anticipation of anything because I know I can walk out and get it today if I really want it that's why you see amongst the the wealthy and the rich and the famous as they have issues with drugs they have issues with suicide they have issues with infidelity they have these massive public break down so many of the times why is because they're getting getting giving getting and there's no purpose in their giving it's all about themselves you know we don't want to just look at those things though we want to look at ourselves and you know sometimes we can look at our own lives and we can say I'm not satisfied as Christians you know what's not wrong sometimes that's God telling you there's more to life than what you're doing son there's more to doing what you're doing daughter that there's a higher plane there's a level that you can live at that will bring satisfaction into your life you you know we can have stability we can have Fellowship we can have a a nice church building we can have a pastor that shows up every service and all of these things but that is not the Christian walk that's the benefits of a Christian walk but that's not where our satisfaction is necessarily found it's something that we enjoy but it's not it amen we've got to step into purpose we've got to step into position to have that inner contentment we can look at it from a standpoint of internal hunger you know because there's something in me that calls out for certain things and what happens remember brother Bram says he says there's a there's an empty spot in your life that's meant for God Amen there's an empty spot that's meant for the Holy Spirit to dwell for God to dwell and he says and all the world is trying to satisfy that hunger and the only thing that will satisfy it is God but there's a hunger and there's a thirst constantly and that's why we see people going to such extremes today even within the confines of this message is they're seeking a satisfaction through Doctrine through Revelation through shouting through the next Revival through this and that and other and what is it they're seeking is really God to come live in their lives that's the satisfaction they need is when he's dwelling and living through them in these sort of things we can eat so much in this life and yet be unsatisfied amen it takes God to satisfy those things amen but there's a remedy for that hunger and Jesus said this and I'm going to use the Amplified a number of times today Jesus said this is after he spoke to the woman at the well he goes out of his way he climbs up to Samaria and he talks to this woman and the then the the the the disciples come up to them and they're talking to them and Jesus said to them I am fed in other words my Hunger is Satisfied by doing the will of the one who sent me and by completing his work by doing and completing that's why he's the author and the finisher of our faith because when he starts it he finishes it amen but he says I'm not just satisfied in doing it but I'm satisfied when the work is done anden there's a way that we have to go and I brother Mark with me some things that brother Paul Aon was talking about a while ago and he was saying how God's not just interested in starters he's interested in finishers Paul said you did run well what did hinder thee there's lots of people that start we read that parable of the s or a portion of it I believe last service where lots of people start with the word but how many produce it to its full benefit amen it's not just the starters account it's the finishers you know what I'm a horrible starter I am the king of I used to be the king of proc procrastination I can't do it anymore I don't have that Liberty anymore but I in by Nature I'm a horrible starter but you know what I'm the world's best finisher once I get started I don't stop there's no stopping me but it takes me a while to decide if what I'm going to start is worth the time and effort and that's the internal question is always is it worth it is it worth it but once I decide it's worth it my mind's made up and I'm going to go all the way to the Finish Line amen if we're seeking satisfaction sometimes what happens is we start and we never finish we've got to finish what we start and we've got to make sure that what we're starting is the leading of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen and then what happens then is even when you're tired even when you're worn out even when you're weary even when you got to go work in the salt mines yet again then what is it there's something inside of you that's feeding on God and it's driving you forward amen these days I get one night one night off of a week I work during the days and then Monday night I study Tuesday night I study Wednesday night I preach Thursday night I have a Bible study Friday night's my one night off and then Saturday I study and then Sunday's preaching again but in all of that I'm never more content than I've been these last few years why because there's a hunger to be found in purpose there's a hunger to be doing what God wants me to do and as long as I'm doing that that doesn't mean I don't like a break that doesn't mean I don't get tired that doesn't mean that I don't sometimes groan and say I've got to go sit in front of that computer for another 4 hours tonight absolutely Ely but that doesn't change a thing why because there's a satisfaction that comes out of it because the fruit of it is lives that are changed and I look at that and I say that ain't me that can't be me that's God and so I'm satisfied because he's using me that's the satisfaction is when we see something that he does that that nobody else can do and I know in myself I can't do it the world today is just looking to loaf through life isn't that living for the weekend work life balance chill relax that's what the world wants to do and what happens is they're not even happy all they want is more chill more relaxed not realizing that that's not where their satisfaction going to be that's satanic you all know how I know it's satanic because in the very beginning God put Adam on this Earth not to chill and relax he put them there to care and dress for the Garden of Eden even under Perfection under sinlessness we have work to do we're meant to do something for the kingdom of God for the kingdom of heaven amen so if we got if we've got to do that when we're in Perfection we definitely have to do it now because you know Idle Hands are Satan's playground God has something for us to do brother BR says this in the message faith is our Victory he says but let me tell you something tonight you're going to wind up at a destination one of these days and that's going to be in the Valley of the Shadows of death he said I would advise you at this hour to prepare to meet the god that will have to meet you at that hour now listen to this you'll either meet him as a master piece that he has worked on or a floating piece of Driftwood to go into your final destination he says so don't you use this life just to drift around and Float around get a better job and dress better get a new television or a better car life means more than that don't you try to just use it just to say well if the rest of them join church I will too he says we've got to have a purpose for something brother baham said this and for the sake of time I didn't put it there to read it but I'll paraphrase it he says we don't just go to church because there's a church there you know what happens so often and I'm seeing this more more message ranks is we go find a job and then we say is is there a church there oh there's a church there good I'm good and you know what happens is people go there and they find out the pastor's not to their liking they don't mix well with the people and then they got to go find another job and another church and another job and another church and they're moving from Pillar To Post because what they're seeking themselves first and then saying well all I need is a message Church no you need a god-ordained pastor that will feed you because I can't feed everyone and not every Pastor feeds everyone some people need a calmer quieter Pastor some need a fireball some need more of a teacher some need more of a Preacher some need a more Evangelical style but what happens is instead we say well I got what I want and then I'll just trust God that the church will work out no we seek God's will for our church first for where we're going to go do they line up listen you got to know who where you're going you got to know where going you might be walking into some place that's full of fanaticism that's full of cold formalism that's off on the uh on the right hand or the left side on Doctrine we've got to know these things we don't just go someplace because there's a message church we better know what we're walking into but I like what he says here because what he's saying is you can be a Christian and still be floating just going along well what is be what will be is what will be and I'm just going to float through life and whatever happens happens and he says no we're supposed to be a masterpiece we're supposed to be something that God is working on Amen and that happens by Revelation it happens by Revelation that what we're going through is not just happen stance that it's not just events and it's not just Karma or luck or these different things but God is working and shaping Us in everything that we're going through in our life and we allow him we allow him to work on us we learn from these things we grow from these things amen we got to know that we're in God's Will and we're going to take a service in the not too distant future on how I find God's will for my life because it's so much hinges on finding his will on prayerfully seeking his will but today we want to talk more on finding your position and let's go back to Ephesians 4 where we open the scriptures up he said but unto every one of us no exceptions he says unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so each one of us has a portion of the gift of Christ and it's by Grace we can't add to it we can't take away from it we have what we have and it's God that gave us to us amen every single one of us we can't force it we can't remove it it's all of God's choosing he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now he talks about the fivefold ministry in verse 11 he says he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers these men are gifts themselves and these men have gifts they have gifts and they are gifts he says what it's for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till when till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man a mature man a complete man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now we've preached on this many many times so we're not going to cover it in in depth this this morning but you know I was as I was studying these things I came across a quote that certainly helped me and I wanted to drop it in this morning because we can get very carinal about what it h what it means to preach the word of God and by that I mean we can say this is what it looks like this is what it sounds like this is the way it will be and it is completely carnal there is no one style to preach the gospel there is no one way of preaching the gospel there is no one preference for these things it is our own preferences that determine that and it is not necessarily A God if you look at the Scriptures it says we're not to seek after teachers that tell us what we want to hear and sometimes it's the way we want to hear it rather than what they're actually saying I've been in Services where the people are so worked up that the minister says something that doesn't literally mean a thing and people are jumping up and screaming and shouting you know what it tells me they're caught up in a spirit not under the spirit because they're not responding to the word they're responding to the emotion but I want you to talk I want us to look at this amen because we we've we've spoke about this before about when Jesus was was was reading Isaiah 61 and he said he that the spirit of the Lord is upon me to to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them are bruised that's a freedom sermon that's a liberty sermon that's a power of the Holy Ghost sermon and yet we know that what happened there when Jesus is preaching this is he's not running around like a man on fire but today we'd say if you're preaching that then that preacher better be going up and down and up and down the A and the people better be hooping and hollering cuz the holy spirit's here to set us free but remember what brother Braham said about this he says now we would think if such anointing was on him had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth he says that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion now I'm not here to say there's no emotion with the anointing that's Antichrist God gave us emotions amen God gave us feelings and that should be part and parcel of this but that is not the anointing because I feel something does not mean I am anointed and because you feel something doesn't mean you're anointed he says but the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how I want to ask you something when brother Brandon was praying over the people in the prayer lines is he shouting is he screaming is he yelling is he sweating profusely is he hollering is he taking his head and shoving them down to the floor 99.9% of the time he is just praying a simple humble prayer with authority why because he knew Devils aren't cast out cuz you shout healing isn't brought because we scream right people aren't delivered by shoving them down to the floor under the anointing what he knew what and how God wanted him to do and he simply spoke it we don't see Jesus listed as a screaming preacher that's not what he was known for he simply spoke and things happened amen it's not by shouting that things happen it's by the word anointed and quickened by the holy spirit that things happen amen I don't have a problem with screaming shouting preachers sometimes I wish I was more of a screaming shouting preacher because that's human nature is to like that for most of us but that's not the way it is and that's not what changes things it's the holy ghost that changes things under the Vindication of that word that's the only way that things happen it's when the word of God has quickened us that that's when things happen I wanted to share this quote that's coming up here now and this is that's not the one I was talking about it's this one I was talking about because we have a five-fold Ministry we've got prophets we've got Apostles we've got teachers evangelists and pastors and each one of them has a way of bringing things and even amongst each of those five categories they have different ways of presenting the word of God and yet if we insist on preachers being all the same way we lose out on the blessing we lose out on the blessing amen we've had preachers come here and and I hope you see that I don't just invite the the ones that are are loud and and running all the time and I don't always just bring the quiet ones but we've had it from one extreme to the other and we've had tremendous Services under men that just stand here and preach absolutely phenomenal and the Discerning of the Holy Spirit sometimes is even sharper in those meetings than they are when the man is running around screaming but through it all God has blessed us has he not why we're a mature church we take the gifts of God as they come to us and that's the way it ought to be now this quote I'm about to read to you brother Bram is talking about the experience of Portland Oregon where that crazy man came at him said I'm going to kill you I'm going to wreck you I'm going to destroy you I'm going to break up the meeting and brother brandom says and he says it wasn't me the holy spirit says because you have challenged who the Holy Spirit you will fall across my feet and when he did it that man charged towards him the Holy Spirit knocked him down at his feet pinned him to the floor and brother Bram said all the demons and all the sickness in that building left it was a complete and total healing of the entire people in the building because they Champion had been destroyed had been defeated they said but I want you to see read this because what would happen is I know ministers we want to have a Ministry just like brother Brams don't we sure why wouldn't we why wouldn't we want to have the most powerful Ministry the world has seen since Christ was here but we're not all called to that he's a prophet he's the prophet there's only one of him ain't nobody going to replicate him but in our carnal nature we would say we ought to be just like brother brandham listen to this you'll never find that in scripture the five-fold ministry is all varying types of different people he says Tommy hosb he he just told the story and he said Tommy osbor happened to be sitting looking at that he went home got a hammer nails and nailed the door open and said I I ain't coming out of here God till you do something for me he said I'm staying right here he saw that brother brandham had something he didn't have and he said God I'm not moving until you give it to me is God going to give it to him he said he prayed for several days he came down was sitting on the porch brother Bosworth was sitting with me and he said brother Tommy Osborne said brother Bram do you think God would answer my prayer now notice he said I'm not coming out of here until you do something for me but he came out eventually because God hadn't done something for him he said and brother Braham said now look brother osbor get started on the right foot he says now you can make a lot of noise or anything and people will follow you but remember your ministry you'll answer before God for it someday he says I said there sits an old oak tree on my porch referring to brother Bosworth I said who knows about Divine Healing crawl up under the tree and talk to him a little while the prophet of God did not say I can tell you he says go listen to that experienced man there he says he says I said if you've been called with a gift you'd have known it way back Yonder gifts and callings are without repentance you're at least a preacher and every preacher by general orders are to pray for the sick not only preachers but the deacons and the lay members he quotes scripture pray ye one for another every Christian in here has just as much right to pray for the sick as I brother Bosworth brother Baxter brother Roberts or any other man is notice what he's saying he he's saying brother you would already have it if God intended it for you in this way but he says go talk to brother Bosworth and he'll get you set straight on this but notice what he says he's saying it's not that these things can't follow you because you're authorized you're instructed to pray and when you pray things should happen but the gift of brother brandham was not just praying God was with him in a very special way he had a gift of healing he had a gift of faith in these things now catch what brother brandham says here now he's saying everybody's authorized to pray the prayer is not what makes me special prayer is not what's going to make you special he says and what do these men do all the ones he just listed himself brother Bosworth Baxter Roberts all these other ones he says the only thing they can do is preach the word of God so clear that you'd see it and accept it he say there's nothing in the man that would heal nothing in his prayer that would heal here stood a guy standing here maybe he's standing here an unbeliever and I could pray for him all night long with a toothache and never heal him he's got to have the faith it's that man he says it wasn't I could heal him but he's got to have the Faith of Christ to receive his healing he says see see what I mean notice the first thing he says they've got to preach the word of God so clear that you'd see it and accept it what is the word of God for the preaching of the word of God for faith faith cometh by hearing not just reading not just reading by hearing because God has anointed a five-fold Ministry to break these things down for the people amen he says so brother Osborne did just that he got with brother BOS and stayed with him for about a year or so I guess or something like that different places till he found all the techniques of how to use the scriptures he says I met him here not long ago in New York when he was standing in Cuba there different places the man had 20 or 30,000 people in the congregation and I said are you tired brother osbor he said I've never laid my hand on a person said what have I got to be tired about I just preach 30 minutes or go home and go home okay okay he's done exactly what brother brandham told him to do and brother Bram says how do you do it cuz brother bram's experience in Ministry is completely different from TL osburn's brother brandham goes through a meetings and he comes out just rung just completely so completely tired out of his mind half the time so worn out so overcome by what God was using him and then he goes to TL osbor TL osbor says what have I got to be tired about he says brother I stand out there and I take the word of God said now don't come talk about gifts and things like this the gift that I have is explaining the word of God he said and the word of God will defeat Satan he's saying I don't need gifts to destroy Satan I don't need gifts to defeat Satan all I need is the word of God he says and that's the truth it'll defeat Satan anywhere any place any time and he begins to explain and tell and just moves in the word like that till Satan is so well built in he can't move see we want the hype we want the emotion we want the excitement we want the buildup we want the dynamic delivery but that's what's not that's not promised that's possible but it's not promised but what look at Paul Paul put a guy to sleep Paul put a guy to sleep the prophet of the age put a man to sleep with his preaching Dynamic delivery is not guaranteed but what is Promised is when a real Holy Ghost filled God called man comes the word will expose Satan and it will show God in his power amen and brother bam saying what's happening here is that brother Bosworth can take the word and he can preach it until Satan can't move in your life he'll show you exactly where Satan is what he's doing what your rights are what your property is he says and now you don't have to do anything Satan is boxed in he's powerless as soon as Satan is exposed church he loses his power because it's obvious what he is what's the purpose of the preaching of the word to inspire faith in the people and so when you can expose Satan in their lives and show them what God has for them then Satan has to leave if they'll believe it that's the Simplicity of it amen when we preach that way then what happens is if you've got a demon in your life when he is exposed it's not about you then I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching to expose Satan and then he's exposed in your life and then you simply have a choice kick him out or hold on to him that's it but you will have to make a choice because the word will make it so clear that you have to make a choice that you understand what's going on in your life listen the emotions come and go emotions come and go we can have the world's best set of meetings and we can walk out and we can lose it all on Monday if if we don't have something in our lives day by day if we can rest on the word of God day by day not on the hype and the emotion of a special meetings or a great Minister that came through but if we can rest because the word is in our lives and that is our foundation then that's where we get the victory from amen listen too many people are coming to church for the preacher to put into them what they don't have themselves it doesn't work that way I can't give you the Holy Ghost I can't give you the word into your life I can present it to you like brother Gerald always used to say I lay it in their laps right brother Gerald lay it in your laps but you got to pick it up you got to take the sword in your hand you got to take the word and put it in your mouth you got to take the word and run it through your thoughts and you got to start fighting your own battles because when that preacher leaves when the pastor leaves the pulpit when this the the special Ministry that comes through is gone back to where they come from then you've got to live you've got to survive you've got to have Victory you've got to have overcoming power you've got to have Direction and leadership in your life that means you got to have more than that because what happens is your Victory is not here your Victory is in here you got to have victory in here cuz Victory is a life it's a person not just an event not just a set of meetings so brother braham's looking at TL OS saying how do you do this and brother TL's Osburn says I just preach until Satan's completely boxed in and he can't move that's his gift brother Bram says the audience sees it he said how many of you will believe and want to accept it they raise their hands like that he says come up here and test testify and brother osbor gets in a chair sits down listens for about 2 or 3 hours to them testify what the word has power the word has effect and they sit there and they hear them preach and they're delivered and then they come up and testify of it he says I don't even have to lay a hand on them he says listen to them testify say hallelujah and go on home come back the next night explain it again he says gets more done of the Lord what then if he was off seeking special gifts to try and have a Ministry like brother brandham he says the man is Right absolutely 100% you just sit there and box Satan in to expose Satan to make it to where he can't move that was his gift that was his ministry not laying on of hands not running prayer lines just simply explain the word in Clarity so the people can grab Faith he says no fundamentalists or nobody else could put a finger on it cuz that there there it is in the word of the Lord so when we're bringing ministers in when I'm deciding who to bring in I don't say Lord give me what we want by no means Lord Give me give us what we need and help us to accept it in the way it comes cuz some some preachers come in and they're like a a a punch to the face and sometimes we need that don't we I heard a couple Giggles sometimes we need somebody to just come in and let us have it CU what we've had it easy for a while and we've done nothing about it so God's got to come in and really hammer it and sometimes he just comes in in gentle sweet Simplicity of the preaching of the word amen all these different ways but if we're mature we'll we'll accept them as God brings them in Paul continues in Ephesians 4 here's the effect that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ then we have verse 16 I took this from the Amplified and this is where we're going to preach the last half of this service he says from him the whole body the church in all its various parts joined and knitted firmly together by what every joint supplies when each part is working properly causes the body to grow and mature building itself up in Love Now Paul says he gives three answers there and we're going to talk about one how does it happen how does it happen he says it's when we are joined and knitted firmly together by what every joint supplies in other words that happens when we get into position but not what when not just when we get into position but when we're connected see that's what matters if your muscles aren't tied together then your joints can't move everything can pivot like likely but You' got to have those joints you got to have those tendons you got to have those muscles there to make it work together and so each one of us individually brings that portion of Christ that portion of Grace that gift that purpose to the body but we can't just bring it we've got to be joined into the body we can't sit here and say well well I've got a gift of this if we're not working with somebody else if we're not connected with the body we're outside of the body then we're just an injection of some sort we're not a part of the body we might be a help but we're not a part of the body brother Braham says this in Jehovah Gyra he says we pray that you'll receive those tonight who raise their hands and may they receive Jehovah gyr's provided sacrifice for their sins tonight and each of them be taken into the kingdom peace Y and given eternal life now catch this he says and then baptized by the Holy Ghost into the Church of the Living God and positionally placed into the body as a position to work with whom with the members of the body of Christ so it doesn't R what what role you play it doesn't matter what role you play whether you're most outgoing person whether you're the most introverted person you've got to be able to work with others in the body of Christ amen there's no Rogue elements in the body that's not it we're all together that word joined and knitted the original word there is compacted in the scriptures and it means to intertwine ideas and gifts and to consider what the other person says and brings and put it together into its proper conclusion or place so in other words I don't have it all you don't have it all but together we can produce it all amen each one of us is is required amen I can't do it all you can't do it all but under the leadership of the Holy Spirit under the headship of Christ we can do what is needed for the body to do amen like I said there's there's no Rogue members you say well I'm an evangelist evangelists have to have a home Church Apostles have to have a home Church they may go out but they've got to be a part of the body and we would support them we would send them out we would give them the finances they need we'd help their family when they're gone in these things because you're not a lone unit the only description of a sheep itself is lost in the scriptures amen we're part of a family we're part of a body you imagine we had the world's best musician here but if they can't get along with other musicians what's the point can you imagine amen we get the best song leader but he's off we've got the best song leaders but if they go off in their own thing and it's all a show about them then what's the point that's not worship that's not benefiting the body that's just showing off their talents and their gifts that's not what it's there for even as a pastor this Church doesn't function if we all look to me and that's why we have officers of the church that's why we have helps in the church that's why we have people that we delegate things to is because I can't be all of those things I'm not meant to be all those things I'm not called to be all those things and so God sends gifts into this body to do those things amen not only just from a a lady standpoint but to bring other ministers in and to help and support I don't know it all brother Mark shared some things with me and I I responded by back to him and I said I'm glad you shared this with me because I didn't have that I needed that brother to fill in that gap for me I wasn't sure where to place that or what to do with it what is it they all help and support one another and it's not just this local body it's the global Body of Christ and we see how each one of those plays into those things that's why we bring in people from the outside Ministries from the outside is because we don't have it all here we need all of those different things so if we're doing it alone I'll tell you this you're not in position yet you're not in position because you got to be joined and knitted together and if you're by yourself you're not a part of the body you're just out there doing it your own but see here's the thing unities work isn't it it's hard to be United but when the people are united Satan's defeated that's the thing so that's the hard work is to get United to get close to the people that are around us watch what brother Braham says Jehovah gy says watch that pyramid as it shapes up he's talking about pyramid of statue of a perfect man which is the bride of Christ he says watch that pyramid as it shapes up in other words as it comes into what it's supposed to be the church justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he says and then that's got to be honed out what the whole pyramid has to be honed he says The Headstone never did come to the pyramid it was rejected just like the Cornerstone he's talking about the the Great Pyramid in Egypt which doesn't have a Capstone it's representing Christ being rejected he says now when that headstone comes when Christ comes down to what take full control of the body of Christ the bride he says I've been to the pyramid it's just so perfectly fit you couldn't run a razor blade between it where the mortar's at he says when the Christ comes to receive his church the church will have a Ministry just exactly like that and through that Grace will raise the whole thing then go the coming of The Headstone crying Grace unto the Lord but I want you to realize what he says he says until the headstone comes down the church has to be honed do you know what honing is brother Matt knows what honing is honing is the final stage of prep for a material see what happens is we can go in we can go in with a saw and we can rough cut it but when you do a saw and it's rough cut you got edges that are all crinkled up and stuff the edges aren't fine then you can go in and you can turn it you can machine it you can run it on a lathe and you'll get it even finer but then at the end when you hone it no you may even go to sandpaper next but then when you go to honing it's just a paste and a light buffing pad and what it's doing is it's putting that perfect mirror finish on it what so we can reflect Christ but that honing is what allows you to put things together and there isn't even an air gap they can do parts so fine now that literally there isn't even an air gap in there when you pull it out it goes it's so tight it's airtight because the parts are so perfectly fitted together brother Bram says when Christ comes down to put his full power in the church they have to be so perfectly honed and fitted together that there's no gaps God help us God help us you know what that means church is the little lumps and bumps and personal preferences and opinions they've all got to go because I've got to fit up next to you and opinions have no place when it comes to Unity the word is the only thing and that's why the word is a sword it cuts and it trims and it does it coming and going amen it cuts us to fit we don't cut ourselves and we don't cut the word to fit ourselves amen we want to be right all the time I want to be right all the time I strive to be right all the time simple fact is I'm not and if you haven't figured it out yet then just give me a little bit of time and I'll prove it okay I'm not right all the time but you know what is we act like we're right all the time but when you look at that word compacted joined and knitted together it means we've got to consider what everyone else is bringing to the table cuz guess what other people happen to know more than we do in certain things including the word of god listen brother Mark can correct me and I can correct him even though he's the Elder that doesn't mean he knows it all by no means by no means just cuz I'm the pastor doesn't mean somebody can't correct me absolutely people come in talk to me about things question me on it and sometimes I'm wrong and I've had to come up in this pulpit and make it right and sometimes I don't believe I'm wrong and so I don't do that but we've got to be able to come up to somebody by the word and say here's what I think and here's what I want but when it comes to a body we'll realize that not everything we do has to do with the word you know I was in part of a planning committee recently in the church and I didn't particularly agree with the way that everything was kind of going but if you remember what I said I said here's my vote but it's my vote as a member of the committee not as the pastor because when the pastor votes then that's it usually people just get in line no no no that's not what I wanted I said here's my opinion but we'll go with whatever the group decides why it wasn't a word problem it wasn't a word issue and half the time the things that's holding up Unity is not a word issue it's personal preferences and I spent a whole service talking about that so I trust I don't need to do it again this this afternoon but half the time the reason we're not at peace with people is because of personal preferences and opinions not a word issue not a word issue and if we'd sit down and focus on what really is the problem we'd realize how silly we're being we'd realize how silly we're being each one of us bring something to the body of Christ and Paul's saying don't throw that away don't throw that person away listen if God can use balam's donkey to speak he can use the little kid that's next to you amen I've had myself I've been corrected by my children at times in attitude and response absolutely not that they come up and say Dad you're wrong but their reaction corrects me and I know that I'm wrong amen we ought to be able to lay our pride down amen let those that are gifted let those that are strong in certain areas do those things amen but what happens is we turn it into spiritual issues and we've got a facade built up and so we say no I've I've got to be able to do that I've got to be able to do that and we're holding back gifts in the body people that can do it but the question then is how do we find our lane how do we find our spot we're talking about finding your position brother John how do I find my position in the body of Christ well let me tell you one thing where you are now that's your position fathers you're a father mothers you're a mother you don't have to have spiritual insight to see that but what you do need is a revelation that you're not just a father you're a Godly father you're a Godly mother and that the things that you do and say in there matter more than anybody else amen we've got to recognize those things but if you're going to take on a role outside of that if there's a place and a position for you outside of that in the body how do we figure out what that looks like how do you know whether you're in it right now or not luckily we had a prophet question to brother brandham how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ he says your position in Christ is revealed to you by the influence of your parents and pastor and the occasional visiting Minister that's the way it is usually but he says it's by the Holy Spirit but now listen he can use your parents he can use your pastor he can use the people around you but you need a revelation your parents don't need the Revelation and your pastor doesn't need the Revelation you need to have a revelation of what your role is in the the body of Christ otherwise what happens is the going gets tough and we Wilt why because it was somebody else's dream it was somebody else's Vision it was somebody else's concern it was somebody else's Revelation and so what happens is we fall apart he says your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit number one he says and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not see that's the big question well yes I believe that I'm supposed to do this he says then find out whether He blesses what you're doing or not cuz it's a if it's God inspires it then God will vindicate it he says and if he blesses it then that's him if he doesn't bless like someone said to me not long ago said the Lord called me to preach I said well then preach see brother brother brother Joe brother brandom could be rough sometimes he say if you're called to preach then preach what's stopping you he says I really think Satan if he can just get somebody to act like that and then deceive them that's just what he wants to do then the whole world points their finger right there somebody thinks they have a gift of speaking in tongues and interpretation some has a gift of Divine Healing some has these things he says sometimes they're mistaken in those things see he says and sometimes they think they haven't got it when they have so it's very tricky brother John you're not helping us at all you're saying it's got to be the Holy Spirit he's got to bless it but sometimes you think you got it and you don't and sometimes you have it and you don't and how do I figure it out we're going in circles here can I use myself as an example I'm going to show you the right way usually I use my example as the wrong way I'm going to give you the right one I'm a preacher I'm a pastor I believe God called me to that but here's the thing acting like a preacher and acting like a pastor doesn't make me a preacher and it doesn't make me a pastor that's not it that's not the way it works amen this isn't an act it's not a show the most serious thing you can do in this world is handle the word of God and you got to be ordained to do it that's not a place to pretend it's not a place to act okay and I remember I told you I've said this many times when God called me to the ministry I said God I don't think this is a good idea I don't I'm okay with it now but at the up front I said I don't think it's a good idea for a number of reasons but I want you to remember what Peter said Peter said wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fail now remember never fall rather remember what he's talking about before that is the statue of a perfect man add your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance and these different things and then he says when you've done all of that give diligence to make your calling election sure what in other words don't presume don't assume don't just say it is therefore it is no he says make proof of it Paul told Timothy make proof of your ministry don't just sit there and say I'm called to do this Peter said give diligence don't assume don't presume remember what brother Bram said he said I got the dictionary and looked up what the word presume actually meant Webster says it means to venture without actual Authority or to take for granted you can take for granted that you've heard from the Lord he says to do something before you are authorized to do it and without the actual author to do it before you're supposed to do it so timing matters you see that with Moses you see that with David see with Joseph timing matters he says and without the actual authority to do it that means leadership matters timing and Leadership God's time God's season so I took this to heart when I got called to the ministry I knew that my inclination was to rest on my study and my scholarship and my intellect and all of these different things that's where I knew that I was going to have a battle because that could allow me to act like a preacher but that's not what preaching is amen so what I did was two things when I started preaching I look to see does it have an effect on the people and that testimony is not from my side that has to come from the people I can't say I'm a great preacher the people have to say he's an effective preacher I can't force that I can't sit there in my mind and say oh my this is wonderful God no no no that's up to the people to testify of I couldn't come up with that on my own that had to come through the people amen and God proved himself very quickly there that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen God has proven that and you you yourself have proven that in this in me coming here in these different things but that's only one side of ministry remember the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word as it's preached is Discerning the need of the people and it'll go and it'll meet those things but the other thing I looked for was God to vindicate himself following my Ministry because you have the work over the pulpit and then you have the work that comes outside of the pulpit if I can put it that way because if you look in Mark 16 it says these signs shall follow them that believe and so what happened was I looked at that and I said God I can see you vindicating me on the on the discernment side but I don't see you vindicating me on the signs and wond side on the Mark 16 side and and I I was talking to a good friend of mine out west and I said I'm just not seeing it I said thee word says it but I said I'm not seeing it and so what did I do I went to the Lord and I said God there's a gap there's a gap between what your word says and what my Ministry is and then after that so I just started praying because here's the thing you can't act the minute you start acting Satan's got you you can't pretend you can't put on a facade Satan will Bluff you remember the seven sons of CA Paul I know Jesus I know who are you and he drove him out and stripped him naked ran him down the street That's what Satan does the pretends Pretenders but what happened after that and this was on my heart for months and months and months and then I went down to Louisiana we went down to visit Atlanta this was in uh 2018 I guess it was and brother Tim puit preached a message called The Calling of a Ministry and in there he confirmed everything that I been praying about and he preached about how that healing always follows the preaching of the word it always does and that's what I've been praying about and that's and different things and deliverance and these different things and so that was so Sovereign to me because I go to a completely different place where nobody knows anything I'm going through and God uses that minister to preach a service just to me and my wife even commented after that she said can you believe that he did that she said it was like he was just preaching to you the whole service and so what was it it was God confirming to me yes keep praying for it keep looking for it he didn't give it to me right there but he said I'm in this don't let go the word says it you don't have it keep looking for it I'm in this I'm in this trial I'm in this I'm in this test I'm in this time where you're deficient and you see it so I kept praying and I kept praying I kep kept praying and then shortly after that brother Gerald asked me to come preach to the services in 2018 at Easter now that that was a tremendous set of services if you remember I remember talking to brother Mark about it afterwards and he says that's only happened twice and what was it it was God answering my prayer while answering your prayer because it's not about me it's about the edification of the body it's not about what I want it's about what the word says and it's up to God then to vindicate those things and that was the one of the greatest moments of my life in my Ministry to date was when that happened because it was God answering a prayer in my heart that said Lord your word's here and my Ministry is here and he just brought me up that next step to where I needed to be amen church we can sit here all day and say we've got an end time rapturing message we know the prophet of the age we've got an open book but that's not what makes us anything having it doesn't make us an end time believer it's having it being it receiving it acting on it that's what makes us an end time believer and then we can't sit here and say I know it all how about I live it all how about I live it all because that's what Satan loves is people that know it all but can't live it that's his church that's his church is they live they they can talk about it but they can't live it but it takes the power of the Holy Ghost to make this end time message live that's for sure knowing it's it's not enough brother Bram continues he says so always do this Brethren whether you feel that you're supposed to do a thing he says first find out if it's scriptural for you to do it he says if it's in the scriptures now catch this don't we love this when you open your Bible and you read that one one scripture and you say that's it he's confirming he says not just wrode in one place but I mean completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to do it your position say if you being an evangelist Pastor teach your Prophet whatever God might have called you to be he says you see or if you have the gift of tongues gift of interpretation gift of any kind of the nine spiritual gifts in the church the four spiritual offices of the church any position he says first see if God called if you're a woman none of those offices are allowed scripture is clear on it there's no women priesthood you can't do it so a woman that comes up and says I'm called to preach I say you're not cuz the scripture says no and there's no debate about it but he says for everything else where it's not an absolute you got to make sure that you take it from Genesis to Revelation take it in all the types take it in all the Shadows take it in the purity of the New Testament if you will but you got to run it from start to finish not just pick that one thing that support you that's that's itching ears that's what that is now having done all that he says then usually I watch it for myself he says this is me I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift they're professing he says see God will work with his creature the way he's made him so in other words you can't have a job that your nature doesn't support he says it he says see if you see him real flighty going on he says the Lord called me to be a pastor he says now a pastor can't be a flighty person a pastor's solid sound see God called me to be a teacher then watch him how he interprets the word see he gets it all mixed up and everything then you can tell see then the thing to do your position position is usually known whether you can do it or not in other words he says the proof is in the pudding if you feel called to do it and when you do it it doesn't work you're not called to do it now that doesn't mean there isn't growth how many remembers the first time a preacher preaches it's usually a little bit painful cuz they're nervous they're just trying to get through it and they may say great things they may be anointed but they're just trying to settle themselves down and so usually painful you say well that was no good you got to give them a bit of time not everyone that steps into a role is going to get it right just from the get-go that's not the way it works we're still human we still got to grow we still got to mature we still got to develop character in these things what's he saying a pastor can't be flighty if you move into pastorship and the church falls apart people are leaving people aren't getting fed nothing's happening guess what you're not called the pastor the proof is in the pudding he says if you can you will now listen to him this is his personal testimony now he says now when God called me to be an evangelist I wanted to be a pastor so your desire has nothing to do with it prophet of God wanted to be a pastor he started that little church if you remember he says and I thought staying at home here would be just fine but the Lord called me and finally all the people got together says there's not a one of them left in here tonight that they cried and went out there on 1717 Spring Street and the lady Mrs Hawkins over here met me and said I'll allowance my children at the table if you'll only build a Tabernacle see and my calling was an evangelist he said the woman was saying I'll limit how much food I buy for my household to help Fe build a church if you'll stay and Pastor us how tempting is it when the people say that I'll give anything if you'll stay desire is not what it is it's got to be leadership he says laying right here at this Cornerstone if we could burst in there tonight you'll see a fly leaf off of my Bible where he told me to be an IST see he says I wasn't a successful Pastor prophet of God I wasn't a successful Pastor never would be because I haven't got the patience and what it takes to be a pastor the prophet of God greatest preacher since Christ and Paul Paul you have to go to the original I think but certainly the greatest modern preacher the greatest modern Ministry we've had likened unto Paul and he says I can't be a pastor I would never make a good pastor I don't have the patience I don't have what it takes see we put him on a pedestal his pedestal is profit it's not all in all it's not everything that's Christ's pedestal am man he's a man he's called to one thing that was to be a prophet and go out with signs and wonders and restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers by what the opening of the word that was his role not the pastor he says I never would be a good pastor he says I wasn't a successful Pastor he says so therefore if I tried to Pastor I would be just as far out as a pastor is trying to be an evangelist see what I mean you can see the way Lord calls you and what your position is in the body your Nature has to match up with it that's in questions and answers and now he moves forward and we're almost done here this morning he says when you're born again God vindicates you he says that's how God vindicates all of his nature what by their fruits and that's the way he vindicates his ministry all of his servants are Vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it's a peach tree because it brings peaches how do you know it's an apple tree it's bearing apples how do you know it's a Christian Christian signs bear from it Christian Life comes out of it what is it he confirms it he vindicates it by his anointing and the anointing is always life it's always life life it always brings fruit it doesn't bring death and it doesn't stay Barren remember he told the disciples that what you would have life and life more abundantly that your fruit would remain amen not just a flash in the pan but what it's a sustaining work it's a life work it's a continuing thing he he explains it he says how do you know he's a teacher the word comes from him he says in other words if you're a teacher you'll teach teach effectively and people will learn under your teaching if you learn and people go out if you teach and people go out more confused than they came in you're not a teacher here's the thing you know what they say the gift of teaching is to take complex things and make them simple and you know what we found so often is we have people that come in and they take simple things and they make them complex that is not teaching no that's head knowledge and usually you've missed out on something he says how do you know he's a the word comes through him Bears record Vindication it proves himself he says how does it become that how do you become one of those people he says when it dies and becomes one he says that's right when we die and become a new creature in Christ Jesus it gets us with our calling we stay with our calling the fruits of the spirit follow us when we are his servants when we are born again the fruits of Christ's life follows up notice that he says there when we get our calling we stay with our calling we aren't jumping around from pillar to pul this one to that one this church to that church this ministry to that Ministry try this try that listen we may try a few things before we figure out what sticks but if we can set back a little bit and say Lord what's your will we seek seek first see what happens is we try and then we fail we try and we fail we try and we fail and eventually we get there but if we can seek first and be led that takes a whole lot of the pain out of it a whole lot of the friction out of it cuz what's happening is the person that's meant to be there can't be there because you're trying to be it right but if we can just say Lord what's my place and hold back now don't let that turn us into lumps on the on the couch amen let's prayerfully seek and then having prayer check it with the word and if the word says it then go and do it and if the Lord blesses it then you found his will it's very simple amen I sure you've met people like this and no matter where they go they do one thing and they do it well and there's a brother I'm thinking of right now that does it and no matter where he goes he can't help it that's what he does and he doesn't force himself into it he just slides right into it what happens is he'll volunteer or usually what happens by now is he's got a reputation and somebody says brother so and so would you do this for us and he steps in and it is amazing why because that's his gift that's his calling and he's wonderful in it and everywhere he's been he's been able to use that gift in a particular way why would I try and force myself in on something like that there's already somebody there Lord I don't want brother Matt's job I want brother Matt to have brother Matt's job and I want me to have my job amen stay in our lane stay in our position recognize gifts sometimes that's the other thing is pride raises up and we don't want to recognize that somebody has something we don't maybe we look down on them a little bit and then they're going to take a position that has Authority or respect or influence no no we're all one in Christ there's no there's no big eyes here amen we're all sheep we all need a Shepherd amen we all need the Holy Ghost amen we all need personal leadership we all need sovereignty usually Pride's the only reason we try and take over somebody else's job I think I can do it better therefore I will listen if you can do it better God will place you but as long as you keep thinking it's about you God will never place you can't do it listen to this it's unscriptural for you or I to impersonate anyone else impersonate act like somebody else act like somebody you're not he says right so be what you are and be a good one listen there's only one person can be you and that's you and he says be a good you he says be what you are be a good one and fulfill your purpose so others can see you if you're a housewife be a real one see if you're a husband be a genuine see if you're a deacon be a genuine or a preacher whatever you are but don't try to take somebody else's place and then when the word calls you down on this he's saying I'm saying this now if you feel this he says if you do feel rebuked then repent that's all is get right that's the only thing to do sometimes we're trying to be something we're not he says don't do that he says and if your heart's pricked right now he says repent of it and stop being that way but I love what he says here he addresses you sisters it's Mother's Day let's talk to the sisters for a moment he says and don't try he says if you're going to be a housewife be a real one be the real you housewife don't try and be somebody else's housewife be your housewife you are sovereign in your own home under the headship of your husband under the word so what that means is sister Amber should not try and be the housewife that sister Blanc is Sister Blanca should not be the housewife that sister Nikki is Sister Nikki should not try and be the one that sister Kimberly is Sister Kimberly shouldn't be the one that sister relle is Sister relle shouldn't be the one that sister Leah is who shouldn't be the one that sister Brenda is who shouldn't be the one that sister Moren is each one of you is different and God has provided you with the Home Sister Priscilla I skipped over you you shouldn't try and be something you're not be the one God made you to be listen sister Amber makes amazing sourdough pizzas okay but you know what happens is you have your party for your boy and if you don't make the same sour or pizzas we think you order Little Caesars God forbid well I'm not the same I'm not I'm not a good of a a wife or mother or sister Amber doesn't have anything to do with anything amen comparisons get us nowhere we are sovereign to our own households and God has built us God has made us uniquely and specifically by his own hand to be where we are doing what we're doing and if you do it just be good at it according to what he's placed in you listen not all of us are going to have sparkling houses all the time not of us all of us are going to have three or four course meals every meal okay that's not it be who you are in the place that God has placed you and don't look around don't look around who cares if your husband is unsatisfied he'll let you know on a very brave day you answer to your husband you don't answer to the ministry you don't answer to other men you definitely don't answer to other women women God has made you sisters God has made you wonderfully for your family be a good one for your family God's provided let's not slap him in the face by trying to be another one amen brothers be yourselves you know what I don't need two brother Joe's for deacons I need a brother Joe and I need a brother Matt you know why because they are alike in certain ways and they are completely opposite in both in other ways and they bring balance and they bring contrast and they bring experience and they bring Insight different to each other and it brings a balance to decisions Amen brother mat can be real tempting to want to be like brother Joe sometimes and brother Jo can be real tempting to want to be like brother Matt when things go wrong but no we need both of them to be as they are under the leading of the Holy Ghost so that we have balance in this church yes we can grow yes we can mature listen if you're immature don't say God May immature that's not what we're talking about but we're saying your nature your nature the way you're built the way you look at things in these different things God can grow us but these differences bring balance brother B puts it this way he says Be Yourself act normal but what does normal mean he says natural people think more of you see sometimes our natural is actually a little bit weird it's a little bit different we're not supposed to to try and hide that that's the beauty of the garden is the thing that stands out and there's a place for the natural weirdness that we have as well it's not that we all have to be a certain way God does not have a cookie cutter up there just stamping out Believers we all have one thing the seed of God in us everything else is different from person to person to person amen don't conform to people's expectations that is the that is the epitome of Rel and that's where Satan rules he says don't try to act like somebody else you're not don't mimic Paul says follow me as I follow Christ I mean you're looking to the word not to be like Paul he says just be yourself he says but all that put on Pharisee acting like somebody else when you're not I don't like he says you never know how to take a fellow like that you don't know where you're standing with him see if they will say one thing to one person and they'll do it with another person a different way or they'll act one way around this person but different around that person you know what the problem is they're double-minded they're acting be yourself let your yay be yay your Nay be Nay it's okay to not like things that people like and it's okay to like things that people don't like be yourself he says he says you don't know where you're standing with that man he says he doesn't know where he's standing himself cuz he's something one in his heart and something else in his else in his mouth so he's an actor remember what Jesus said these are the people that he says they draw not to me with their mouth but their hearts far from me you can't be one thing here and one thing here different thing here out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks so he's saying if you're speaking two things your heart is confused you haven't settled something he said there's something else in his mouth so he's an actor he says I just don't like it it just seems to be too much of something that's not right putting on last quote he says oh my deliver me from being an actor amen he says be what you are God will bless you he says you even see sometimes ministers will do that they get in the pulpit and make their voice very big or deep God bless you this morning come on put on a show no no no he says they'll get in the pulpit and make their voice very big I have now receive my degree like it run Shivers over you he says I feel sorry for them people don't appreciate that just be yourself people will appreciate you more it'll do you good you won't put on what's he saying God made you the way you are be that and God can bless it amen you know how God blesses it he anoints it he anoints it in all of our little quirks and differences yet he anoints us amen let's stand together if we would he says be what you are God will bless you you know I look through this church and we've got coffees we've got cetes we've got grants we've got more coffees we've got columbos we've got lushes we've got Shaws we've got Walsh leggers we've got more coffees we've got collinses we' got more coffees again right and not a one of us is alike even amongst the coffee Clan not a one of the alike and I say praise the Lord praise the Lord that we have contrast that we have different backgrounds that we can bring different experiences to this church because our strength is in being different remember what Paul says can the you know and I don't know which ones he use you know can the eyes say to the to the mouth because I'm not a mouth I'm not a part of the body see we look at the things that are different say well I can't be a part of this body no no no that's not what it's about at all if we're all the same we're a freak right we have to be different even amongst our fingers you say I've got 10 fingers but not one of them is the same the index finger on both sides is different even every one of us is a has a difference and we bring it amen we bring something unique and special to this body and that's what we're supposed to be looking at is what God has anointed what God has blessed don't kick it out let God be God in these things and you know what the thing that challenged for us to do is to focus on the thing that God has blessed in our lives rather than the thing that God hasn't in put there see the human nature is to look at what the brother or sister doesn't have the god nature is to look at the Christ in that person and you know how we get that joining and knitting together amen we sit here under the preaching of the word this is not where the great joining happens We Gather here under one name the name of Jesus Christ under one Banner his word and we have Fellowship here one with another but the joining and knitting doesn't happen in here it happens out there amen when we spend time together when we do things together when we do things for each other when our sisters have babies and we bring meals over when somebody moves in and we help them find their stuff and we help them find a place and maybe we put them up for a while when somebody gets hurt when somebody loses a job when somebody needs help because the snowstorms are too big whatever it may be that's where the joining and the knitting comes is the real life in here we're all holy we're all perfect out there is where we prove it amen that's where those things happen amen we focus we ought to focus on the blessing that each one of our brothers and sisters is not the deficiencies cuz in the body you're there for your strengths not for your weaknesses amen what God has blessed amen you know what I've noticed we have a lot more grace for each other when we spend time together because you know what happens is when you step away from fellowship or they step away from you as the case may be then what happens is Satan's got all sorts of imaginations that he can work with see see I always knew that about that brother I always knew that about that sister see it's it's coming to it's coming ex no no no that's Satan driving in a wedge amen where's the intercessor and you know what the best thing we need to do sometimes get back in Fellowship you start thinking about someone the wrong way you start painting pictures in your mind you start having conversations with that person in your head you know what you need to do have them over have fellowship with them amen get knitted and joined together because something's pulled you apart when I hurt my shoulder you know what hurt you know what caused it to pull apart an impact what is it somebody says something somebody does something somebody doesn't say something somebody doesn't do something and what does it do it causes a tear it causes a stretching and all of a sudden things get loose and it starts to move around it doesn't work the way it's supposed to how do you get it you start working together with it again that's how I'm building my shoulder back together I'm working it in with the rest of the body sometimes the first thing we need to do one go to God in prayer and say God take away that attitude don't don't say Lord fix the brother say Lord fix me my attitude is the one I've got to live with and then say Lord help me to draw them in help me make them a part of my life in a way that Satan has no wedges that he can throw in between me and them that's how we get knitted and joined together amen what did Jesus say by this shall all men know that you are my disciples by your love one for another amen by your love one for another God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I believe if there's one thing the church wants Lord is that you would flow through US Lord that you would use us Lord that your Holy Spirit would have free reign in our lives Lord that we would bring souls to your kingdom Lord that we would surrender our lives so that you can have Lord your preeminence Lord so that you can fulfill your very promises through each and every one of us but Lord we know that comes by working with each other Lord Under The Authority Under the headship of you of the Holy Spirit Lord and by the the the truth of the word in our lives Lord God lord so many of these things are so simple Lord we're looking for victory and you give us such Simplicity and you say will you do it Lord I pray where there's anything Lord broken Lord where joints have come apart Lord where attitudes and ideas and imaginations have raised up Lord I pray you kill it even in this service this morning Lord let me esteem my brothers and sisters greater than myself Lord let me look at them for the Christ that's in them rather than the flesh that wants to flare up from time to time Lord I pray you help us keep each one under a a covering of Grace Lord of intercession Lord Of Love of forgiveness of Mercy day by day Lord May our hearts burn within us Lord to spend time with each other Lord because we know that when we're with each other Lord we're with a portion of you Lord help us not to look too highly on ourselves Lord but let's see the value Lord and the body Lord that's around us Lord from the youngest to the oldest from the smallest to the biggest Lord the men the women the children whatever it might be Lord Lord may you unifies us together under your spirit we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen do you know that song Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I live for you alone 10:19 this is my desire to honor you you
