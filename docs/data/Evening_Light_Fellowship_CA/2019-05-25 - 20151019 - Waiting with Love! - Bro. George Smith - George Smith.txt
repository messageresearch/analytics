to me gently as I close the door into focus on these were nice [Music] [Music] [Applause] a man praise the Lord thank Jesus for his presence with us tonight a man I believe that Jesus is here I trust that you believe he's here I trust you have the assurance that when you came he came a man that he was with you and that he is in you and that you are the word Christ made flesh a man it is Jesus walking in you it is Jesus talking in you it is Jesus bringing his word to pass in you by the grace of God and let's believe tonight that it is Jesus that will bring his word to pass in our brother George Smith and we want to thank our brother for traveling as far as he has and coming even beyond as I would say beyond Canada in the Newfoundland a man to bring the word and then to be able to go out to central new Flannan and minister to the Saints there and as we traveled of course to where to Deer Lake and and Cormack to see the Saints he was ministering in the Samuel brother guys assembly in st. John or in Grand Falls but little from what I heard god bless the people through the word amen and then the comments that I heard it was excellent they were faith feeding on what our brother George had to say and when myself and sister Betty said in the service of Friday night we were feeding on the word amen and I believe it is what it should be and in the ministry it should be God hidden and revealing simplicity a man as it was in the prophets so it is in the fifl ministry the word coming forth is God hidden and revealing himself in simplicity and those that will humble themselves are going to get the revelation of God in simplicity a man let's not make it as the father warned us in the seals he said don't make it any smaller than what it is and don't make it any bigger than what it is and he said don't try to figure it out and he said if you think you've got to figure it out he says you can be sure of one thing he says you're wrong a man is God in simplicity and work and we're going word by word by word we're going step by step by step trusting the Lord a man that's it and then it's God in the ministry and he did bring that quote out I believe either in the service or somewhere else where the prophet of God has someday asked the Prophet does the bride having ministry before the coming of the Lord and he should sure and has been going on he says since the day of Pentecost and is going on now and he said it's the fifl ministry it is the Holy Ghost in the Bible ministry Amen is a ministry that now recognizes the revealed Word in the prophetic ministry of Malachi for a man and that bride is going to stay with that word that bride is going to get the faith that God that pleases God in their word amen so I want you to be in prayer for our brother George Smith as he comes god bless him amen for taking the time to come to minister to those in central Newfoundland god bless they were taking the time to come back and to minister to us here in st. John's hey man we was here in 1984 I believe it was that was the first time he was there now he's there again and we trust by the grace of God he'll be hurricane of the Lord tarries a man so let's pay attention to the word I want you to pull on the word amen and and let God speak to you amen there's good answer there's going to be something there for you that's right tell me something there for this brother this sister that brother that sister amen is God dealing with us as individuals tonight in the word so I pray God you're going to have the the ear that it's going to hear what the Spirit is saying in your soul not in your head and we're going to go by the spirit of it not the latter of it a man because we gonna get that all mixed up by the Holy Ghost he's going to he's going to set it all in order amen by spiritual revelation so living in prayer for her brother George as he comes tonight amen just want to say that then we were very thankful for our brothers testimony we're very thankful for our brothers witness and the things that he that God has used him the two around the world and our brother George himself sister Rebekah and also the the believers international association with our brother William and his daughter Angela angel and in name name Tennessee so god bless them because they are continuing their moving on because they know and they know the hour is late so they're moving on to get out to the bride where they feel the right it needs in this hour a man so be in prayer for our brother George and be in prayer for for our brother William and his daughter II in Tennessee and the believers International a man so they they they'll be in the spirit they'll be there doing what God wants done to get the bride ready to go home a man through the revealed word of Malachi 4 so god bless you god bless his ministry here god bless his ministry as he continues to witness to the people around the world amen so I'm gonna ask you to stay and we're gonna sing only Billy all things are possible only believe as our brother George comes tonight amen so pray focus on the word his night was going on outside maybe Weathersby outside the building that's not going what's going on even outside your flesh it's what's in your heart amen so be in prayer that God will bless us and feed us and teach us amen only believe all things are possible only believe Oh but you got it Oh that looks really this.g because Jesus [Applause] James I believe [Music] Oh let's pray precious Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity to be here with this section this proportion of the Bride of Christ in st. John Newfoundland well you knew before the foundation of the world that we'd be here because with you there's no surprises there's no news for you and so you knew who all would be here will we be wearing what our attitude would be father we just pray that you'd bless your word now to your people let each one have their portion Lord there's something here for everyone and you've given it to me I want to give it out now help us we ask in Jesus name while you're standing turn to the second page of your Bible Genesis 1:27 now you'd be surprised that people start flipping looking for that Genesis 1:27 the Word of God says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him he may be seated he's privileged to be here and to see the growth and different faces that there were 30 years ago I barely remember being here myself but stayed in touch with brother Israel during these years and somehow we're still friends because we're going to the same heaven oh there's no it's not sectioned off like it is overhead cemetery heaven is one there's one heaven if you're going or you're not going so tonight we want to look at a subject what am i reflecting you are reflecting something all the time now Adam and Eve were there in the garden Adam was made in the image of God we just read that so we don't have to worry about what he looked like or how he was in the image of God sometime later in chapter 2 we have the fact that Eve was taken from Adams side now some of you are a lot smarter than I am so I'm not going to try to pretend like I know a lot of things but you know I do understand that the foot has 26 bones in it so now Adam could have missed one of those bones but you just crack one of those small bones one day find out that you can't walk so God could have taken a bone out of the foot to make Eve then he got a kicked her around like he kicked the cat you know he could have trampled her and despised her and he didn't take a piece from the head because then there'd be a matter of always overpowering you know you didn't take it from the hand slap her around that's our that's a princess you know that's that's too when the cooks not happy you got a lot of problems you got to keep the cook happy but he took from the rib which is closest to the heart so that Adam would love her and cherish her until death and beyond hey let's see the merge ceremony says till death do us part some people just can't wait till she dies move on to something better that's not the way it works now I've been in a few countries and I was in the Congo and over there they take Church very serious yeah when we when we finished Sunday School where they finished study school there was 4700 people present and only 250 Bibles so of course the American missionary gotta help these poor people the brother said look we got plenty of money we're building this church and they don't know what drywall is they know only reinforced concrete so they got plenty of money and they said they'd sell Bibles right over there the problem is these people can't read there's only 20 percent literacy at there in that place so they're doing fine and by the time church is over there's like 6,000 people there then you look outside and there's maybe five cars and maybe 400 motorcycles small motorcycles and 500 bicycles and everybody else walked but after the service the pastor jumps up and he says now we don't know when brother George is coming back so does anybody have any questions what were you bugs drove I needed six thousand people so the questions are in France and Lingala and then they come to me and then I give the answer so that took a while so the only question I remember was that one sister had passed up a question well since the Lord took your wife why are you still wearing the ring well I couldn't say scare away the women could I no but I said because my commitment to Rebecca was not just til death do us part but to Eternity you see and so that's the way that love should be amen there's a three ladies - okay so they were in the image of God and being an image of God they reflected the glory of God for a while now we don't know how long it might have been a long time they didn't have watches back then but it was every day every night a hundred percent and they reflected perfectly but they also reflected God in balance if you don't remember anything else remember that you can't build this church without one of these and God can't build character in you without you doing your best to stay in balance so just keep that in mind so everything was peaceful everything was in perfect harmony there was no sin there's no temptations it was nice no I think they eat whatever they wanted to eat they they camped out every night and how many people really like to camp out let's see your hand yeah let's melt like me I like hotel right there's clean sheets and hot water but these people had a perfect environment and they camped out every night they slept in a different place every night the animals were all there and so we can imagine that one day evoke up and and she said not Adam I love you but you know that that tree I can't see the mountain too well do you think he put up a fuss like we did like we would know he said well yes dear why wouldn't I think of that and he moved the tree you see now we would have to get a lot of expanse and help and machinery but men the sooner we learn to say yes dear the smoother your life is going to be now I didn't always do it but it does work okay that was free so they didn't have any temptations and so they they were in up a perfect environment but one day the most cunning and subtle of all the beasts of the field everything God had created he came along and began to speak to Eve they were communicating somehow now I wasn't there and neither would you but our prophet give us enough information to know that they communicated for a while wasn't just one encounter they've come around and so they became friends and one day after the confidence was very well-established he lied to her because she God had told him if you do these things here you're going to die and Satan says you're not gonna die surely not you know and he just changed one word and so Eve could have said really did she started listening and she started having more dialogue and well he may have a better idea it sounds good to me you know and where was Adam well he was over with the animal someplace so this is how things started and that's why we have sin in the world until today okay that's where it started and we still have it today because he had a better explanation she came out she was fortified behind the Word of God very simple it was only a few words in in English I think it's thirty nine words that she had for her little fortification and she came out from behind the fortification and double got her you see because she was listening to her new friend and from that moment till tonight we have these problems now they didn't have Ten Commandments they didn't have a Bible they couldn't read anyway you know they just had these thirty-nine words do this everything worked fine but they failed because of reasoning well I think and I believe in my thinking in my opinion we don't care we want to know what God says because this will not pass away see this is God in printed form now all the Bibles are going to burn one day but the Word of God will be here forever and we are part of that word now elijah says in the harvest time message God is a great sculptor he made man in His image to reflect him that's what we're here for and he is the word and what did he do he tried and Adam he failed Moses failed all the rest of them failed but there's one perfect one hallelujah what is it nothing less than God himself in flesh the word reflected in him brought the fullness of the Godhead bodily not a prophet yet he was a prophet not a man yet he was a man Jews don't try to claim him as yours or Americans or Africans or new foods new fees or whoever it's not belong to any one of us you know he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God so we'll just go with what the Prophet says not with what some of my good friends say and say well Jesus wasn't God well excuse me we have somebody that knows what they're talking about we'll listen to him instead so Jesus Christ was the last Adam see the Lord of Heaven to reflect perfectly and take care of the sin problem 1st Corinthians chapter 15 we have the song we probably sing here he paid a debt he didn't know I ordered it I couldn't pay I needed someone to wash my sins away you know and now I sing a brand-new song amazing grace for Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay Jesus is the Redeemer William Branham is the restoration prophet stay in balance I know a lot of people that are not in balance so the original couple reflected God very well until they listened to Satan incarnate in the Beast everything was fine there was no problems until they started listening that guy you see and it didn't sound so bad you know it wasn't evil it wasn't bad it wasn't ugly it sounded reasonable well he could be right how many times we heard that well it sounds ok it's it's kind of what the scriptures say no we want to know exactly what it says you see so at that point the reflection was interrupted they reflected God perfectly until then but then when they start listening to what could be right maybe what do you think huh and the reflection then was interrupted they couldn't see themself clearly in the mirror of God's Word as they did the day before you see so what happened words and then attitudes and actions came between them and the god of creation and they at that time were out of balance it only got worse it got worse and worse and worse ok now they were still God's children you're God's child you wouldn't be here if you weren't you see and so they were still God's children his marvelous creation but the fellowship was broken you see only the fellowship was broken not the relationship so when you go out and you listen to this other stuff and you listen to your Mormon friends or whoever you listen to you start going in that direction it's not the same fellowship you don't feel comfortable but you see you're still a child of God now if you're not he'll go over there and you'll feel comfortable and you'll keep going but if you're a child of God you will be uncomfortable he will bring you back you're gonna pay if you you know you're gonna pay a price but he will bring you back now of course we have a story of Jonah Peter and others that then there may be something here today in a similar condition similar situation you are a child of God just a little bit out of fellowship you need to get back into fellowship you see out of balance with the God of the Bible now in Luke chapter one we have the story of Zechariah and Elizabeth they were old by this time now as a Cariah had a job in the temple and he was doing his duty whatever he was doing there and an angel from heaven appeared on the right side of the pulpit on the platform there of the altar and he tells him hey your prayer has been heard you can have a son well Zachariah didn't didn't you know get ugly about it he just showed a little bit of hesitation just a little bit of unbelief see and that developed into an attitude problem so you don't have to do a being seen a bunch of stuff and and go to Las Vegas and go to all do these awful things only show a little bit of fear a little bit of unbelief both are contrary to God's Word and the fellowship is broken but not the relationship so there's still hope but we're here to tell you that this is infallible Word of God it's got in printed form and you need to be able to see your reflection now this mirror is always clean you don't have to clean it yeah but the ministry does is adjust it to where you can see yourself see now Daniel the prophet reflected God so perfectly one day and he hadn't obeyed these these you know religious laws they had because they said no look we can't have people worshipping other gods you will not do this and this and this he said well I don't care what y'all say I've got a my window and prayed to Jerusalem every day well they caught him and they threw him in the lines and others Lions then was full of hungry lions not like we have at the zoo that they feed him four times a day now these clans were hungry and either thing that fell in there it disappeared in ten minutes but when he fell in this this pit with all these hungry lions they saw a reflection of the god of creation they saw something oh that's the creator and they couldn't take a bite and in the king saw it and brought him out you know well the Lions were afraid now he had some friends and they gave him new names and we're not going to go over there and find all their names but anyway they called him Shadrach Meshach and Abednego see that was the heathen names they put on them and so they reflected God in such a powerful way one day that the fire could not burn them they were put in a white-hot fire and it didn't burn and just burned off the rope so they could worship God you see and they became indestructible and burnable but why were they in this predicament why were they in the fire now I know you've studied this in Sunday school but I'm only here today and tomorrow and so we're gonna try to just be real honest and show you God in simplicity it's okay I promise to come back for another 30 years I don't want to come over here and see brother Daryl on crutches you know but you see what happened back then they why they were in this predicament the king at that time was so in love with the prophet of God and so he loved him so much that's Daniel and he said now he told us his uh his craftsman said I want you guys to make a statue we're gonna big statue and and we're gonna when you get up there at the head we're gonna make it look like Daniel I'm sure some of you seen the picture of the statue of Christ in South America Christ the Redeemer it's 98 feet tall so it's about the same size as that but the the the the statute over here with Daniel was not concrete or plastic or wood or aluminum it was gold 90 feet tall and so they had this law that when the certain music sounded they would all have to bow on two knees towards the statue while the music's playing and that was the law but you see these two from these three friends of Daniel they knew better because in the scripture it says in Leviticus you shall make no idols nor graven image amen neither rule you up a standing image neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land or bow down to it for I am the Lord your God there's only one God see we reflect the god of glory but there's one God so when they did when the music sounded and these three guys didn't bow well the religious police came by and grabbed him brought him in to the king now the King loved them too because they were Daniel's friends so they brought him in there and they said I look Oh King live forever and these three guys you know they're foreigners in the first place but they're here and they didn't bow to the image now you know we have these laws so the King says no look boys I love you guys and you know I'm trying to understand this religion of yours but but hey I love Daniel and you love Daniel what's the problem so they quoted in the scripture from you know leviticus 26:1 and he said well I'll tell you what you go down on one knee and we'll call it even and they said note not one need not two knees we're not Allen well then we got to throw you in the fire Thor's in the fire we don't care our God is able to deliver us we believe that much you see so it was time for them to really believe well they wouldn't bow to the image of the prophet of God they wouldn't Bend in their Holy Ghost convictions and they would not burn in the horrible fire how those things are there for our admonition to see and neither will the elect lady God's bride she won't bow she won't Bend and she won't burn but only before you get too excited only a few qualify one-in-a-million ok brother Brendan says the Gentile age began with forced worship of a holy man and the Gentile age goes out the same way with forced worship of a holy man now God knows who's who I was just telling you what the word says but nowadays you know there's there's forces around well you either do it our way or we'll draw you out of the circle that's fine draw us out of the circle we're serving God not man and we will attempt to make your life miserable it's going on and it's happening in October of 2015 now some people reflect Satan and many of his attributes in full color because if you haven't noticed the newspapers or the television or the city sin is painted to be very beautiful Las Vegas and Atlantic City are beautiful it's not ugly you see and so following Satan you form addictions when you when you follow Satan you form addictions just like when you follow the word you have a time that you read a time that you pray a time that you listen now you want to call it a habit fine or an addiction but it's it's it's a habit that it takes you closer to God but if you're going to follow Satan you're gonna form addictions to television the movies the gambling etc and carrying spoken-word books at the same time it's happening we have all kinds of things that are going wrong today now it used to be the television well today we've got it all right here this is your personal branch of the tree of knowledge and depends where you put your fingers what kind of ugly things come up so be careful you're warned now don't be like some people I got this one friend he's got a cell phone he only turns it on when he's using it so I can't call him unless he happens to have it off it's probably good if you turn it on well anyway there's all kinds of addictions that you form when you follow it Satan and of course it's reasonable because well I'm not so bad that guy well there's worse there's always somebody worse than than you you see and these people never get enough now Satan is a bad bad boy now he will he will tempt you to go into the store and rob the store for your habit but while you're in there verse he he's outside on his cell phone calling the police on you that's how bad Satan is so the fruits the fruit of following Satan is death eternal separation and there's only two forces in the world today you might think there's a lot no there's different colors but it's only two forces you're either on God's side or on satan's side which one are you following which one are you reflecting now we do live in a apparently a very enlightened age we got these little guys we got nice lights we've got you know microphones got nice everything did anybody walk to church I don't think so no you know every we all got nice things but we live in dark Laodicea now when brother Branham was preaching in the islands of the Caribbean in 1959 there were some Americans with him and one of them asked him and there for our interview you said he had they sent a brother Brown why do you say so much about 1977 which was 18 years in the future right preach in the coming the Lord we don't know if we've been getting there so brother Brennan said well very simple when I was looking through the stream of time and of course prophets can do that they can see the years he said when I got to 77 it was so dark that I didn't see how any believer could live in such darkness and that's why I said what I said about 1977 well that's reasonable well anybody can figure out that we're a long ways from 77 now about 30-something years right so how dark is it it's very dark but there are going to be some people that are going to be victorious out of Laodicea and when you get to heaven they may give out a t-shirt I don't know but it's not gonna say survivor it's going to say overcomer we are the overcomers elata sia you know some some Christians reflect their pastor they can coughs just like the pastor they can walk like the pastor they can buy a car like the pastor you know that's all quite natural but the past are supposed to be pointing us to Jesus Christ the great Shepherd you see we follow the pastor as long as the pastor follows and reflects Christ so when the parent gets on a tantrum it starts blasting everybody didn't see it his way or whatever whether it's time to pick up beautiful things and move on you see but the pastor you have a parent has done a good job you know he's done a good job but the job of the minister is to make Christ real to the people that's it that's his only job you see otherwise he's wasting his time and your time now when Eleazar went to get Rebekah remember the story and the camels okay so Elly's just coming back with Maria back on these camels he was her pastor during the trip you see and but guess what he didn't molest her he didn't he didn't bother her he only told her the stories about where they're going they had a lot of questions and answers and that's the only wish you didn't have I pet it and have pictures and she would ask questions and he would give answers about Isaac and so he brought her safely to Isaac you see now there's people that reflect their church they're always on the defensive because their church is the best and their pastors the best and so forth but the the fact is that you can pretty much see these people when you go to town because they have they have an attitude about them their church is the best you know and then we have people that reflect a good moral family we have the story in where's it at in mark 10 I believe of the rich young ruler now this guy was very wealthy he had the best horse he had the best silver saddle he had everything nice in today's world he'd have he wouldn't be driving a little sorry $50,000 van no he never the Lamborghini didn't he really nice and so um so he had everything but something was missing any-any searched and he came running desperately and he bound to Jesus said what shall I do to inherit eternal life so first of all he had the correct attitude of approach he came in humility he didn't section off twenty ten minutes okay tell me what I need to do I gotta go no he came humbly to see what the answer would be and so of course humbly many much more than a lot of Christians but Jesus immediately said well you know what the commandments are because they discerned him right away he said you don't do this you know and the guy said yeah I know all that since I was a little boy you know I've been to church activities I know all the rules and but it was all ritual there was no life it was just plastic you know and he was very religious but he was only reflecting the church teaching this what we have here is a whole lot more than just church teaching it's immortal and then Gerald's preaching it's the Word of God and it'll live through you if you subject yourself to it the same so none of this was real to him it was just a bunch of quotations so forth and you know we all face difficulties in life nobody has an easy road the very rich people there have a lot of difficulties you know sure enough be or nothing no silver dollars roll away you know everybody's got problems you see and some when they have their problems in a church of course probably not here but some other place I've been they automatically blame the pastor oh it's got to be the pastor's fault that this happened you know well guess what it's not always the pastor's fault now God allows a pastor to have one or two really hard-headed sheep they're there for the pastor's perfection yeah you see so it all works together [Music] it was thinking later now in Psalm says I was shaped in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me in Psalm 58 they go straight as soon as they're born speaking lies that happens in the Smith family the Brandon family and all families those little guys are hard-wired to lie to protect theirself you know and so the scripture tells us also in Romans 3:23 for all have sinned no matter what your name is all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now we claim our children and it does work you see in mark 10 we have the story of you know Jesus and the children he took him up in his arms and he blessed him now what was the the mighty disciples doing they were trying to scare him away they hadn't learned yet that the kingdom of God is like a little child you got to be a little like a little child to get there you see because see the little children they were having this personal contact they're innocent they're trusting you know they have no guile they don't need a bunch of explanations so we got to say what we mean and mean what we say why because children are discerning these children are our offspring that are fruit of the Blessed union they're precious and they can tell when you're lying faith look right through you you know of course little children like a little sponge you know they're collected stuff all the time they don't collect everything you click but they collects if you know information and and they record all these things and then there's a time when it has to be manifest it's usually at Grandma's house or some embarrassing situation or it comes out you know but they're interested innocently reflecting what they are in the spirit world you see so no one was born right no one automatically reflects God you have a process that you come through but God has made a way he has a way to straighten everybody out and get him on the right path everybody has to come to repentance because Romans 6 says for the wages of sin is death and raised specifically but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord no there's no other path you see only through Jesus Christ sin looks really good it looks delicious but it pays really bad death eternal separation from God and there's only one form of eternal life now I've got four brothers that are Baptist preachers and they posed the question to their people every week where do you want to spend eternity with God or Satan well that's certainly not the choice because if you don't accept eternal life the way God print paints it for you then you're gonna be an eyelid you're gonna go to zero it's gonna be a lot of suffering so there's only one way by the way the cross okay now brother Brennan says I would rather have the wrong doctrine you don't misunderstand the Bible but have the right spirit then to have the perfect doctrine in a wrong spirit because the wrong the wrong spirit won't take you to the right doctrine the right doctrine might not take you to the right spirit you've got to have the right spirit to get anywhere you see you got to be balanced it's not an option now we've heard the gospel many times we're very educated in the prophetic message you've heard many explanations through the years but the question tonight for every one of us have we been born again that's not just Billy Graham Smith says it's our message they say is Christ real in your life or only in your mind in your imagination see we have to face that many on the planet haven't even heard of Jesus Christ Romans 10 tells us that somebody has to go preach to him somebody brought the gospel here and didn't come in parachute somebody came over here in a boat brought the gospel to this island you know and there's people out there that still need to hear so God calls ministers they're sent to preach and God does the work supernaturally in the human heart there's no guaranteed results if I preach this they're all going to repent it doesn't say that we spread the gospel the seed come to God you see so then it's not just an explanation you see now Billy Graham said it's on the wall down at his library he said I've had the privilege of preaching the gospel in every continent of the world and I found that when the gospel of Jesus Christ is presented with Authority quoting the very word of God he takes the message and supernaturally drives it into the human heart we can't do that we can only make Christ real to the people but they have to respond and so that's why it works the brother Branham says here did you know he says did you know God knew that we'd be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever founded did you know that he knew we'd be standing here the infinity of God knew every fly every gnat every cockroach every mosquito all those things that we kill in the summer time God knew all that and how many times each one would bat his eye and how much tattle that would produce that's quite a computer sin he knew all that before the world's ever formed so he says now you say well if he knows all that then why are you preaching that's part of God's program preaching is his program now there's something that a lot of people can't quote tomorrow morning because they have another idea of how the gospel should be preached the brother Brennan says preaching is his program when he looked upon the Apostles he looked upon the harvest he said the harvest is ripe and the laborers are few the only Dupree to the Lord of the harvest it will send laborers into his harvest and he says well why would they have to pray to the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest if the Lord of the harvest was standing there knowing how it would be done good question he says God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and me and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do were paralyzing his program but when the church moved by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing this program see then we're reflecting a God of glory then things can happen so after conversion then the obedient humble harmonious life begins to reflect the reality of Christ 24/7 excuse me did anybody notice that the pastor wasn't speaking quite right tonight I've got a bad throat well he's a lot better than it was three days ago he was preaching me all the way down there so you see they have people have to come to conversion then a harmonious life begins to reflect Christ now some grow faster than others now all of us have most of us have raised some children they're all different you don't have the same rules for the know they're all a little different so they grow differently you see but it's a process so your life is reflecting something every moment of the day while you're awake you're reflecting something now you own if you have a circle of influence I don't live here but you live here you got a circle of influence people that are looking at you they're watching you closely because they have a thirst to see something real now here you are saying your believer sometimes you carry in your Bible sometimes you're praying over your food they're watching that you see they're watching and they want to see a reality because there's been too much fantasy too much make-believe and too many explanations so your life should make others wonder and ask questions and you can't always take him to brother Gerald he's got it life too you need to have some of the answers you can't always take people to the pasture now we all know I should say we all because there's some people here again used to be believers they don't believe that there's five coming to Elijah but we do because the scripture says it so you if you've been in this church over six months you should be able to open your Bible and show the five comings of Elijah when somebody asks you or what do y'all believe so simple then after they start asking questions then maybe put a book in their hand or a tape or a DVD or something but first it's your life that's what the first thing is and we're not out proselytizing we don't want all this city in here what we're going to put them we only want the Eagles there's still some Eagles out there don't know their Eagles you see and so the non Eagles they don't care they don't respond now everybody knows that the current Pope is named Francis right right does anybody know what name his mother gave him when he was born aha gotcha she called him George but when he came to Rome he wanted to be real nice meek and humble so he takes on the name Francis because Francis lived about 900 years ago and he was the one that talked to the birds and so forth and so he wanted to be that well we know where the bread said Francis was a gospel preacher okay and among other things that Francis said back then he said preach always use words when necessary all but that's not our way we're North Americans we know it all look what we've got you know so we like to talk and talk and talk no you're wrong on this you're on it wait a minute all this talking eventually it doesn't you know square off with your it doesn't balance with your testimony even you've been tell them what great believer you're on William ran in a blah blah blah and then and then what about your testimony all these words so just live your message then if they if they ask a question you can give them an answer out of the Bible you see why do women wear long long hair because the Bible says so where there were long dresses because the Bible says so okay in John chapter 12 there were some Greeks that had heard about Jesus they saw the reflection in some people now they want to see the real one you see they want to see him and so brother Ram says these Greeks were not looking for a lecturer now some of you guys were school right you know what lectures are like pretty boring aren't they okay they were looking for a lecture they weren't looking for pulpit clowns y'all ever see the pulpit clown well maybe she ever get off the island you'll see him there down there we got him they weren't looking for that they were not looking for entertainers they wanted to see him the person Jesus Christ okay let's move ahead here now as parents what are we reflect into our children a minor already growing I got grandchildren bigger than I am so you know already come through all this now youth is beautiful but I don't want to live these 50 years over again see I'm only 20 years old a 50 years experience but you see what I'll be reflecting to our children they are young but they're not deaf they're not blind they're very discerning you see Jesus except you become like one of these if you're not going you see soap estimate pessimistic parents breed children with very low self-esteem attitudes begin with us we are the teacher we are the adult we give them love unconditionally we listen unbiased the door is always open come in and talk we trust them till they give us reason not to that's what I told my children I'm gonna trust you so I got good reason not to trust you you know we serve them unselfishly we honor them as little miracles from God and God that these children will imitate your actions much quicker than the words and your desires because they're watching us know what you say they're watching how you act see so we all want something better for our children we try to smooth out the way you know and let them not get hurt or face adversity but that's not always the best way you see remember what you're raising is your replacements these are your replacements okay so if you're critical rebuke or hypocritical children will be that way amen so you know that we send them to school or did you pick up that kind of stuff come home repeat and stuff you know so it's a vicious cycle but we have to be very careful how we have we raised them we instruct them in the scriptures and I did steal something out of your office for the drill this little paper here on Susanna Wesley how to raise children so everything with children starts at home you can't be living in your way come in here and expect them to be little angels it doesn't work that way they got to know how to act before they get here there's a couple over in Saskatchewan that they the kids play church you know at home can they they learn to sit still they learned to listen no way to get there real church sitting still now this is a couple I know down in North Carolina they got this little four year old you never sit still you just turn things up it's going to cost them dearly one of these days but it all starts at home parents are their first line of defense an instruction and training and molding reflecting the glory of God so as parents we have the awesome responsibility to be a friend to the child see we don't repeat conversations to others that's gossip where we can be a confidante you know the door is always open it stops right here and we must work with and not against these these kids are our friends to a certain extent but we're still the adult you save it and this begins at 12 months not at 12 years you see but we got to stay balanced that stay positive got to remember who the adult is okay so after receiving the Holy Ghost Peter reflected God in such a way that just his shadow passing over the people healed on me there was only a few days before that he was blasting and cutting the guy's ear off and done all kinds of things right lying and swearing won't got into Peter here he'd been operating these this gift and been following the master for these years and and and Jesus said and I've always seen him anybody got a weapon oh yeah we got two swords plant that's all we need so they go into the garden they're praying they're over there and and there's a place where they were sleeping they weren't sleeping under the trees and it was cold so anyway they're there and so here comes the the Pharisees and the Romans you know they're gonna take Jesus now he looked like everybody else he didn't have a halo it didn't they didn't know who he was Judas had to kiss him to know which one he was so all of a sudden when Jesus tell him he's telling the disciples my guys gonna get really tougher a little bit they're gonna come they're gonna give y'all no no I'm Peter they got to come to me first and Jesus said Peter you better just zip in and stop got to come through me now where was all the Earth's time they were back there Amen Peter you tell him and so and so when they when they got there and there they were there with the torches and things and Peter got all man well he got in the flesh real quick and you think he was aiming for the year that's pretty good slice isn't it he was aiming for here we missed he got the ear now there's that there's the ear laying on the ground oh wow this guy's bleedin and Jesus picks up the ear and puts it on perfect operation everybody should have been on their knees but they had such hate and such just venom it took him you know and so he's over there at Caiaphas house and that's the only night he spent in Jerusalem all the other places they went out but this night they got him in a prison in Jerusalem so he's a prisoner and Peter must have paid somebody somehow he got into the same yard and it was cold so they got this fire going he's over there warming his hands at the enemy's fire didn't bring his own fire and so he's warming his hands and so the girl comes by serving the tea and she when she gave it to him he said well thank you but see he was from Galilee it's like you guys say and thank you down in Georgia it's obviously you're not from there so when he spoke you're one of them never heard of him big swear word came out and so then another one came by hey I saw you at the meeting last week a you're one of them never heard of him that's just a few hours before that he was willing to fight for him and kill him and now he's just being this girl says you're one of them never heard of a big swear word comes out and when he did the third time the rooster crows a little bit late Peter but now that he's received the Holy Ghost now just the just shadow was him he's one of the spokesman for the big church going home you know so these were all normal people like us they weren't super humans but they all had an experience you see now Hebrews chapter six brother Brent says you may impersonate the right thing you may impersonate a Christian but by and by there will come a time when the strain will be put on then it'll show what you are when Christ the Son of God was put to the test it showed what he was when you're put the test it'll prove what you are your life always reflects what's on the inside by and by your sins will find you out jesus said in Saint John 5:24 he that heareth not he the shaketh there he the speaketh he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not shall never come into the judgment but has passed from death unto life you see now he says it's your faith and your faith confessed by your lips only makes manifest to the people that you can hear that still doesn't solve anything anybody can hear and repeat see that you can hear but your life is open to all so see like like back there with Francis is a fourth it doesn't matter what you say it's what you live see so no matter how much you try to act like this or that it'll never work it's got to be in you that's the real kernel of the whole story your personal faith and the resurrected Christ as your Savior that he's at the right hand of God acting in your place this morning as you're acting in his place down here as a witness okay the witness is to act instead of somebody stand for you as a witness and as your life reflects here what your testimony is in Christ it reflects their and it reflects here he is up there as what he is for you reflects both here and there so by your faith are you saved in that alone now there's something else here that says here okay so what are we reflecting in 2015 are we were infecting just just demand william branham I mean I know people they know he likes cherry pie and they know he likes to hunt squirrels and all these things but what about the word he preached what about the real meat of it you know you see so are we reflecting just churchianity or what you see if you're reflecting rock and roll music be careful it'll take you down you see let's see we got too many Pharisees too many actors now years ago and some of you can barely remember but we had a black telephone and had a dial okay then later they had push-button but they had the dial okay so in the phone rang you had to be nice because you had no clue who it was it might be the bank it might be mortgage company might be your mother-in-law we don't know so it could be real nice now that's an actor it's a Pharisee now today we got these nice little guys and and we know exactly who it is we can just I'm not here still actors brother Brennan says brother Brennan says I'm a Christian oh ho church he bought you there's only one I've been at Brandon 55 years and never did join the family I was born one that's how you're born in the kingdom of God and you're and your reflection of his word okay and the questions and answers 54 is real good what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here what's your celestial body is somewhere else it's what you're reflecting back here he says that three times here in the spirit land what you are it's what you are here if you're still vulgar minded and so forth it's all in Galatians five we're not going to go into it and so forth and the spirit land then your vulgar mind adhere see the Pharisees again if you're still got if you still got malice envy and strife you're in the spirit land with that and it reflects back here but if your whole innermost being has become cleansed and purged it shows that you've got a body out yonder waiting see and that's why the scripture says if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting to see so this isn't fantasy this is reality okay in the images of Christ he says brother I know it's called heresy it's called fanaticism but if I had a choice to make tonight my choice would be to be like him this is after many years preaching the gospel okay after 25 years of a world-shaking ministry he's saying things like this I want if anything in my life to reflect the image of the Lord Jesus in my life he says I'm going tomorrow night after this wedding I'm going out to the wilderness and I'm gonna stay there because way down in my soul I feel I need a closer walk with God Wow and not just a closer walk I want to walk right I tried to walk Mauri before him but I want to walk closer all the Branum Tabernacles hang a revival I want one myself I don't just happen in the building I want it to happen in me I want a closer walk I want more of the Holy Spirit in me to reflect Christ in me that would look good on the refrigerator wouldn't it I want to be like him I know that every true Christian wants to be like him that's my heart's desire to be like Jesus well he is the example of what I want to be and look it'll take the Holy Ghost to do that it's the only thing that can do it he says I'm not interested in cemeteries and what somebody's got to tell me I don't care about kissing a crucifix or pulling through on your heart or saying prayers to the Dead I'm interested in one thing that's more of the Holy Spirit to take over William Brown I'm not interested enjoying a greater Church so forth I want more of the Holy Ghost in my life to reflect Christ whom I love now I knew William Branham okay he's my father-in-law and he reflected Christ in such a way that some thought he was Jesus Christ so such it's such a marvelous way of handling things and the way he talked and everything he was such a yielded vessel and some tried to worship him some baptized in his name you see which is very wrong there's people tonight that are that are burning candles to William branham's picture in South America because they're Catholic to start with we still got a lot of Catholic people here too you see and so he reflected Christ in such a way or maybe that's him no it's not him he's the restoration prophet you see are we in hurry no let me just drop this in on June the 6th of 61 brother Branham had been gone for three weeks hunting missionary and up in Canada someplace anyway comes back and so all the pastor's back so everybody's in their places you know because when the pastor's not here it's time to go do things right so when the pastor came back everybody's in their places and and and so they're all attentive well guess what he comes in he preaches on June the 6th of 61 and that's when he let the bomb drop that there's people he said that are that are actually they have a card says William Brandon my lord so he he got to his attention that they were doing these things that they were that they were they were worshiping him he said this what's wrong you make me Antichrist well you went through all these details well prior to this Sunday Rebecca had plans to go home with some of these people because they had some kids for age so you know that plan was in motion so hey after church she goes home with these people and they lived in and out in a trailer park and I had to inference and exit so she goes home with these people and while she's there with the kids and everything she's listening to the adults well the adults are in the other room and they're really speaking against what he just said in the service that morning Wow did you see how how smooth that was well he really put those people off now we really know that it's him they're saying things like that and so she was very sensitive so she goes to the phone she was about 15 and 14 or 15 so she goes to the phone and she calls her dad dad you won't believe what they're doing over here well of course you would and she says they're crazy come get me and so he said well I'll come get you but I can't stop the car because they'll want me said that he wants for that other entrance and when you see the car coming in and you get out in the road and I'll slow down and he jump in we'll go so she did well so they're leaving this place and they're going down the road and he says now look I'm glad you called me he says one of these days all that's gonna look real good to y'all no dad no not not me no believe me it's gonna look good to you and so he he had a way of getting your attention he said I see see where we are there was a railroad crossing there 100 he said now you see this crossing okay I just remember I'm telling you today that one day it's gonna look good to you but don't you ever fall for that nonsense so he wasn't leaning towards that but he said the truth has a very sharp edge and some people on this side some people on this side know so just keep the balance Jesus Christ as a redeemer William Branham is the restoration prophet okay so what else we got here okay now when Jesus was here he went to a wedding one day remember now if you go look he went to Cana of Galilee which is little village they went over there to this wedding now Tuesday is the third day see Sunday is the first day Monday is second day Tuesday is the third day Tuesday is the favourite day for Jews to be married because in the creation if you read Genesis day one created these things it's good day to it's good but on day three you said it's good twice so they grab that day to be the marriage day well so when Jesus at this wedding and all these people were there and they ran out of wine remember all it and and they went to marry well she can do anything whatever he says so they lined up the six big pots of water and you know it was wine well there was an occasion in the Brandon Tabernacle when one of the members of the tabernacle who lived next door to a mr. Hill the mr. Hill belonged to the Church of Christ and so the member I don't know what their name was was always inviting mr. Hill to come to church at the brown tabernacle so one day mr. Hill said okay I'll go well I happened to be communion sunday so they have open community or Christian you've received the Lord Jesus then you can have the communion it's not closed like only us and so the people are standing in front of the altar there's mr. Hill and then the others and mr. Hill heard brother Neville say to brother Branham we're out of wine what should we do well it's a embarrassing situation she ran out of wine in the middle of the service you know and so brother Brandon says well just pray so brother Neville's holding the tray with his little cups in it and everybody's praying and we got their heads down but mr. Hill was the visitor so he kept one eye open see what's going on here so his testimony was that his brother Branham prayed little glasses filled up the wine well so he couldn't go back to church Christ if he had to stay but that was that was things like that happened brother Brian's life they never said a thing about he had such power with God you see so I knew him he was very humble man he spoke with great authority heaven backed up what he said you know and he knew where he stood and he reflected the glory of God he lived what he preached you see so in a prophet of God of course is a seer he was born a seer you see the scripture already had Malachi in their scriptures been the scripture forever but when brother bran was born he was born a seer but he had to come to the place where he yielded to the Lord Jesus for all this to come into effect you see that's what it started happening you see so a singer can look over the fence and see what's going on in here where we can't see but then his challenge is and how much of this do I tell him and what words do I use see that was his challenge and see like with Moses God had him write the first five books of the Bible in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth but was William Branham he goes farther back that goes back in the mind of God before the creation so his words are important in the tape this great servant Moses brother Brent says as Moses went with the judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is Jesus Christ if those Egyptians could ever got that little simple stick out of Moses hands they would had him quipped and when the devil could ever get the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ he's got the church quit now that it's one of those kind of things it's just kind of stuck in there he never says it again but guess what there's people today people that we know that are slowly removing the deity out of Jesus Christ out of the name of Jesus Christ that's what he says get the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ they're taking the dhih dhih attitudes Christ they're putting it over here in this organization this man in this and that and the church is powerless it looks good but it's not right you see then he covered it in the tape here you him God wants to see the reflection of himself and in his church reflecting the power and the glory to the world that's what we're here for in another place he says so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there's a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflected something here on the earth and we are only that reflection we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere now and for those that you know watching date since 1964 thank you he says if that isn't that way that I'm the worst deceived man in the world I've spent my life in vain but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's there that's why we're here there's a positive we're the negative we're going there now John chapter 13 says by this shall all men this whole city is going to know that you belong to Jesus Christ because you have a certain picture oh the way you love each other the way you treat each other that's just their sign you see so only a prophet could say this listen what he says do you know what God did he reached out with his hand and he stopped it he's holding time in his hand for the church to make itself ready there's a few more members yet to come in into the body of Christ maybe one of them's here today that's why I'm here that's why I'm led to be here that's why not to persuade you're not saying don't be Catholic don't be Memphis no but I want you to be filled with his spirit just remember I'll meet you at that day and these words will be witness against you it's all on God's tape-recording and with this great picture camera and you sitting there and walking away and leaving it you'll see your own self at that day in the mirror of God that's for sure so William Branham lived a balanced life okay he reflected the life of Jesus Christ and you can live a victorious life you can reflect Jesus Christ right here in the closing hours of lurid Asiya you see how by living your message in balance all the extremes are dangerous we've got people today knowledgeable of the message somewhere over here burning candles to wean brands picture others are saying it's all lies but you got to stay in balance you got to know where you're at it's your choice let's stand together Heavenly Father we thank you for this time together we thank you for the attention of your people Lord we just thank you that there's people that are still interested in the gospel people who want to live and reflect your glory and father was just glad to be here with pray that you'd bless your people give us the rest we need or just back at the appointed hour and father would just thank you for all things help us in Jesus name Amen amen I have been discouraged from Frank preaching after our brother finished [Applause] I've reached before he came so I'm not supposed to preach after he finishes but a man is hard to resist that that holy temptation amen to me a comment and a man I can say this that the thing that we are looking for the thing that we need to think God wants to but and the thing that our brothers emphasize tonight is balanced by the grace of God because the manna what God has done withers you where brother's starting the Garden of Eden the balance was broken between God and man song down through outside the garden the enemy kept again to attacking and breaking the balance he meant keeping us religious but we lose the balance and the balance is is staying with God in and revealing simplicity and if there's anything that our brother brought up tonight it was that revelation it was not in vain it was for a reason that a prophet of God preached God hidden and revealing simplicity before the opening of the seven seals a man and then warned us at the end not to try to figure it out but to let God do it as our brother administer night let God really letting their God live it out do you just give yourself over to God amen praise the Lord that's that's this way to keep the balance you got you got to get in the spirit of the word and what struck me I said he like hey if I can't preach I said I just want to comment on this yeah I something our brother was sane and concerning what happened in the Garden of Eden that's good praise the name of the Lord oh my god this scene was good I'm not talking about that I've gone about what happened after after a man fell after after they they put themselves under Satan's influence amen and our brother brought out this this this revelation he said the fellowship with God was broken but not our relationship that's good amen and the preaching of the word identifies what our relationship with God and those who are related to God those who are the sons and daughters of God those who are the seat of God Amen in your life and in your life God by the Holy Ghost is going to bring out his DNA a man physically we got physically we got mom and dad and Grandma and Grandpa's DNA but not when you're born again while the God's DNA takes control amen sons and daughters of God that we that were with him before the foundation of the world within those theophany bodies brother an is coming forth that DNA that attitude there those actions those reactions so it's not like Paul Paul when he was born again he dieter to the flash and become alive to God he says not me that lives now he said as Jesus lives in me praise the name of the Lord now God's DNA was in control and it was God's DNA it'll dovetail with this a man and our brother is bringing it out here here here here little by little to show us that that is that is not all you know way up there or you know a great big doctrine and all of a saint getting some getting real deep or real high you would cook down run god's level a man say was trying to as that's what he did to eat and he was trying to make he believed that she could go higher he was fighting they believed he believed that God would God put her to look and her sings that he was hiding from you and he and yeah yes God said bought but I say unto you I'm gonna give you something you know and you're gonna feel gonna be as gods she was to God a man and her brother mentioned had him moving the tree for Eve because the prophet of God said all he had to do was speak to work a man he didn't need an axe he didn't he aged groped and do this and do that with her to speak the word and it was gonna move by the grace of God but again and it's getting away from God hidden in revealing simplicity so brother what Satan did it wasn't keeping us under that revelation simplicity of God and what God wanted and what God wanted to do no no it make life complicated and getting more and more complicated in this hour that we're living in now god help us to live and reflect the life of God in and reveal and simplicity amen that's good as much be Christians and what is a Christian not a churchgoer the Christian is the church and a Christian is christ-like amen let's go ahead and be like Christ is not what you wanted to do what does Jesus want you to do you're not living no more as Christ living in you but the enemy is there working on your flesh to get you to do what the flesh wants but God is on the inside by the only goes to get you to do my god wants to reflect God his nature is character a man and yes brother a man you tired looking into the word and so on see yourself in the word the word in you look right look into the mirror what do you see hey man what do you see Paul says look into the mirror you look and you walk away and forget what you look forget what you saw but how can you forget it if you're seeing a reflection of Christ what who's that I like our brother Mike that was here said he he was shocked when he looked into the mirror and he and he could ruin the world is that old man he couldn't believe that was him a man but they're looking to the mirror of the word and let's see ourselves as the sons and daughters of God amen that's good listen to it again on the DVD and don't forget that the fellowship was broke broken but not the relationship make sure test your relationship with this word your relationship will come back to the word line up with the word and manifest the word unfortunately it was broken by sin in the garden and if you allow the flesh to interfere it'll break your relationship with God but not your it'll break your fellowship not your relationship that's why the John said if we see he said seeing probably God said thus in John referred to he said it's not going to is not going to break your relationship with God he said a little interfere with your fellowship a man he said you're born again if you stumbled and fell and sinned well he said though you're a theophany well back off and your fellowship is is stopped with God but now your repentance will restore it amen praise the name of the Lord that's good I pray God we got the revelation that we are the sons and daughters of God that we are not Satan Satan seat or serpent seat but the seat of God and the true seed see themselves yes what our brother said the true seed see themselves in the mirror of Lord we need to die more to ourselves die more to the flesh stop listening to your mind and let's start listening to the voice of God in our souls it's not what you want to do what does God wants you to do and what God wants you to do will be will bring you closer to him and reflect him and hide you by the grace of God it's got to be for the glory of God to the suceed see themselves in the mirror of the word good and it humbles them praise the Lord [Applause] the Lions could not eat Daniel thank Tamar the fire could not burn that's Reba children with the Lions eat you and are the lions of this world eating you and is the fire of this world devouring you how's grace tenth the purifiers with us as it was with Daniel God's grace that the Lord is with us as he was with the tribu children Amen thank God yes brother amen [Music] Satan was trying to force him to worship idolatry this this something of the flesh and word that's the beginning and at the end Satan is still trying to get us to worship pleasure of this world he's still trying to get us to worship the food of this world the fashions of this world the styles of this world the technology of this world he's trying to get us to worship the religion of this world don't it cut up with it don't you can don't you let it control you you control it remember it's not of God the father said in civilization and education of the devil and all these inventions he said that man make he said they profit for a season and then they become a curse but is far too many that are controlled by technology and science and education there are very few representing God hidden and revealed and simplicity caught up with a lot of things we don't need and the more your kind of everyday folks unless you want to go out of here because you're so satisfied with this world you're so pleased with this world how many want to as I've said before now let's go home I thought I would going back to your house all the comforts of the house and I got this and then we got this vehicle or that vehicle how many want to go to be with Jesus probably God said you'll go when you want to go I trust sure the preaching of the word and the Ministry of the word tonight it's increasing our hunger and thirst for eternity it's increasing our hunger and thirst to get get out of this body and into a glorified one to get out of time into eternity amen I pray the preaching of the word which is eternal it's going to make eternity more and more real to us amen we want to go in how Lord we want to go we want to go amen to be with Jesus praise the name of the Lord hallelujah what's that song brother praise the Lord praise the Lord [Applause] to God be the glory [Applause] number

eyes of educated man but in the eyes of those born again by the Holy Ghost man doesn't consider a great and a devil tried to tell Eve well I got something greater and that's what he's doing with the people today let's stay with the word I best my brother George thank your brother for the work I preached to him lost my voice now I'm praying that God well through his preaching restored my voice hey

of Prayer and pray for the service in the morning and again for the anointing of the Lord on our brother George hey man appreciated ministry you see his spirit preciate the work that AEI has done and is doing for the Lord amen and we pray the grace of God in for his will in our brother's life a man in all things you know even when he was coming here and his plane was delayed well I don't know when we're doing we would say hey is that the will of the Lord yes it was [Music] it was his flight was delayed maybe for a couple of hours because of the falling out of facts we maybe we want to blame it on the devil and then and the devil this devil that and everybody's God's timing this guy's planning there was God's predestinated will because of what he had predestinated to for me to do and were for something to happen at the airport while I was waiting for our brother George [Music] [Applause] [Music] I said well I said I'll have to go get gay gave myself a lunch I said it's going to be another Harold Hamm before that flight arrives so I went in and and as I was going out to the counter to get the lunch there was this gentleman there and he was sitting at a table and he had a small computer there he was working on and he he had a cell phone that he was talking to somebody on he was business doing his business but he sold me and I just passed by and and he saw me in and he kept waving for me to come and I just I just way back but no he said no and he kept you a kept talking so I went over and I waited for him to just finish this conversation and then he finished it within within a couple of minutes and and then he turned off his cell phone and and laid it down and and later say his computer aside [Applause] [Music] he sees your pasture lush I see yes I said but who are you don't know me no he's I was in your home I said I don't remember he said when he was in 1997 [Music] I said what yes he said I was looking for a Christian confident to do some work and for some reason I he got connected to us anyway when David was through I think maybe the the church where we were worshiping at the time and I said well I don't recognize you but I said maybe your name this is what God's looking for the name for some of you that may recognize the name and it was Chris Walsh and he's got a contracting business and he knew by the message we talked about the Lord we talked about the condition of the age the end of time he said I listen to brother Branham he said every week I said what yes he said and he took his computer and he and he moved it over and he showed me where were you it all he had to do was just click on this and all the sermons our brother man was listed yes he said I'm listening to a brother man Ami's and every week and he said what he's saying
