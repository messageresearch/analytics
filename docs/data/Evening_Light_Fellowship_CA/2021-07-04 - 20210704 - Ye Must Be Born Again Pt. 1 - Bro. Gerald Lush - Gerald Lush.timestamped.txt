[1:08:02] and in john chapter 3 and verse 1
[1:08:08] and there was a man of the pharisees
[1:08:09] named nicodemus
[1:08:11] a ruler of the jews the same came to

[1:14:13] ordained for him to do
[1:14:14] and brother oh my he was on his way out
[1:14:17] until finally brother the great pressure
[1:14:19] came on him amen
[1:14:21] that brother the bride is experiencing
[1:14:24] and what did jesus say not my will

[1:14:51] now amen brother we know what he what
[1:14:55] he's done oh brother
[1:14:56] in the ministry of malachi 4 brother if
[1:14:59] there's anything that
[1:15:00] revelation that we ought to have of
[1:15:01] jesus is that we are in the time of the
[1:15:04] resurrection the rapture
[1:15:05] amen it is amen it is the end of all
[1:15:08] things

[1:16:01] to
[1:16:02] eternity than time because what god has
[1:16:05] done and what god is doing is pulling us
[1:16:07] away from time
[1:16:08] and jesus was getting more and more away
[1:16:10] from time he was getting more and more
[1:16:12] conscious of eternity

[1:16:23] hit us

[1:16:28] resurrection we want to experience the
[1:16:30] rapture amen
[1:16:32] and we want to we want to truly
[1:16:34] experience jesus
[1:16:35] in glorified bodies amen not oh
[1:16:39] it's not just saying by faith by faith
[1:16:40] by faith yeah
[1:16:42] but that faith is to get press on press
[1:16:44] on
[1:16:45] press on amen if we're really getting
[1:16:47] into the faith
[1:16:48] that god is giving us through the
[1:16:50] revealed word we're getting less and
[1:16:52] less conscious of time
[1:16:54] and more conscious of eternity we're
[1:16:56] hungering less for time
[1:16:58] and what's going on in this whole world
[1:16:59] and we're hungry more and more and more
[1:17:02] for the resurrection and the rapture so
[1:17:04] god help us brother in the name of jesus

[1:20:13] grace
[1:20:13] that brother what god has done what god
[1:20:15] is doing that we know it
[1:20:17] amen so the amen
[1:20:20] well what's god done and there's not
[1:20:23] luther not wesley not pentecost
[1:20:25] no no it's the bride oh what's he done
[1:20:28] for the bride he's given he come and he
[1:20:30] opened his word
[1:20:31] he finished his mystery amen just think
[1:20:34] their god was going to come to god was
[1:20:36] that at a mystery
[1:20:37] in luther's age and wesley's age the
[1:20:39] pentecostal age
[1:20:41] and all them through the ages the
[1:20:42] mystery of god the mystery of god
[1:20:44] amen god wanted them to do this repent
[1:20:47] and be baptized repent and be baptized
[1:20:49] amen but brother he wanted us to repent
[1:20:52] be baptized but also move on to eternity
[1:20:54] that's right amen don't don't stop there
[1:20:58] oh yes there's one god and he gave us
[1:21:00] this revelation
[1:21:01] and this doctrine of this doctrine amen
[1:21:03] we repent and we get baptized in his
[1:21:05] name
[1:21:05] amen oh yeah but there's a faith now
[1:21:09] that the end of that that god's looking
[1:21:10] for
[1:21:11] luther and then went and do what they
[1:21:13] did or they repented
[1:21:15] and now that they had water baptism but
[1:21:17] it was all in the titles no doubt
[1:21:19] amen but yet god blessed them because
[1:21:21] they were emphasizing the revelation of
[1:21:24] justification
[1:21:25] amen and god never required of them
[1:21:28] what are they required of you and me oh
[1:21:30] yeah
[1:21:31] god never required of the wesley and the
[1:21:34] methodists
[1:21:34] god never required of the old-fashioned
[1:21:36] salvation army because the prophet of
[1:21:38] god said
[1:21:39] god raised up the salvation army or read
[1:21:41] william booth he said with red
[1:21:43] hot salvation he said to take the
[1:21:46] message on to
[1:21:47] the pentecostal revival amen praise the
[1:21:50] lord and then go
[1:21:51] and again lord brother sister god has
[1:21:54] given given us
[1:21:55] access to what luther had access to what
[1:21:58] what wesley had access to what the
[1:22:01] pentecostal agent
[1:22:03] and what god did in pentecost he gave us
[1:22:05] access to that but like he said god
[1:22:07] never took it away he said the gifts are
[1:22:08] just on the shelf
[1:22:10] that's all they're just right there amen
[1:22:12] but the bride is being moved on
[1:22:14] to the resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:22:17] so is the resurrection and the rapture
[1:22:19] more conscious to you than justification
[1:22:23] sanctification yes the baptism of the
[1:22:26] holy ghost
[1:22:27] because to me if you really got the
[1:22:29] revelation as you should
[1:22:31] of justification and god has given you
[1:22:33] sanctification
[1:22:34] amen and the gifts of the spirit the
[1:22:36] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:38] amen brother if you if you've
[1:22:40] experienced what god has done
[1:22:41] then brother you're experiencing what
[1:22:43] god is doing now because brother what's
[1:22:45] it doing it's going on and on and on and
[1:22:47] on and on
[1:22:48] to now he requires of us what he didn't
[1:22:50] require them
[1:22:51] amen it requires of us but he didn't
[1:22:53] require the of
[1:22:54] of the pentecostals amen amen
[1:22:58] oh yeah well what he was doing was was
[1:23:00] pointing us in the right direction
[1:23:02] he justified us sanctified us good lord
[1:23:05] let's move
[1:23:06] on okay come on my son and went on to
[1:23:08] the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts
[1:23:10] of the spirit
[1:23:10] amen wonderful lord your your more and
[1:23:13] more power is is revealed more and more
[1:23:16] power
[1:23:16] your power lord is being manifested lord
[1:23:19] what's next
[1:23:20] the resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:23:24] so brother and we we got this the faith
[1:23:26] of luther's age the faith of wesley's
[1:23:28] age
[1:23:29] the faith of the pentecostal age and
[1:23:31] brother
[1:23:32] brother brown said in 1965 he said
[1:23:35] pentecost don't realize this is the
[1:23:37] crowning
[1:23:37] of the pentecostal message amen
[1:23:40] and what is it now brother he did this
[1:23:43] he did it brother amen
[1:23:44] brother god knew what we needed and he
[1:23:47] provided it amen
[1:23:48] amen in luther wesley pentecost amen
[1:23:52] and then on down to the revealing of the
[1:23:54] bride by the grace of god
[1:23:56] amen to give the bride oh yeah
[1:23:59] pentecost went around the world with the
[1:24:00] gifts amen
[1:24:03] yeah but then god came down and they
[1:24:06] were amazed
[1:24:07] when it comes to william branham they
[1:24:09] wanted william branham they wanted
[1:24:10] william
[1:24:11] even pentecost why oh because of the
[1:24:13] gifts and god was healing god was doing
[1:24:15] this god was doing that
[1:24:17] yes but the problem of god said yeah he
[1:24:20] had the first
[1:24:21] move the second move into the third
[1:24:23] phase of his ministry
[1:24:24] he said get the people to believe amen
[1:24:27] why
[1:24:27] because the first two signs that he had
[1:24:30] was
[1:24:30] was to attract their attention show them
[1:24:32] god was living jesus was alive
[1:24:34] amen the same yesterday today and
[1:24:36] forever and then
[1:24:38] what about the third is he said now he
[1:24:40] said you get them to believe
[1:24:42] the third amendment amen and it'll give
[1:24:45] them the faith for the resurrection the
[1:24:47] faith for the rapture
[1:24:48] amen oh brother and that there's ever an
[1:24:51] hour
[1:24:51] that the bride ought to be crying and
[1:24:53] calling and believing for the
[1:24:55] resurrection is this
[1:24:57] when we consider what's going on in this
[1:25:00] world
[1:25:01] brother we want to get out of here amen
[1:25:04] because when when god experienced this
[1:25:06] in different ages
[1:25:07] he he came down and he brought judgment
[1:25:10] and then he moved on giving us a greater
[1:25:12] revelation
[1:25:13] then he brought judgment into that age
[1:25:15] amen and he moved moved us on and gave
[1:25:17] us a greater and greater revelation amen
[1:25:20] until he would give us the revelation of
[1:25:22] the rapture
[1:25:23] to get out of here to make an end to it
[1:25:25] by the grace of god
[1:25:27] so i pray grace brother that we are
[1:25:30] truly
[1:25:30] born again amen
[1:25:33] by the living word of the living god and
[1:25:36] we're truly born again
[1:25:37] and brother we're oh yeah we're
[1:25:39] conscious of god but brother not just
[1:25:41] the god of yesterday the god of today
[1:25:44] we're more and more conscious
[1:25:45] of what god is doing amen
[1:25:49] and god is reflecting what he's doing in
[1:25:51] your life
[1:25:53] in your attitude in your spirit amen
[1:25:56] amen so that he is in control
[1:26:00] and brother for the resurrection rapture
[1:26:01] he's got to be in control
[1:26:03] amen so again not you living it's jesus
[1:26:06] living in you
[1:26:07] amen is christ in in the flesh of his
[1:26:10] bride
[1:26:11] amen praise the lord in the flesh of the
[1:26:13] bread room look what he did
[1:26:14] well he's doing the same in the flesh of
[1:26:16] the bride amen
[1:26:18] changing us from time to eternity praise
[1:26:21] the
[1:26:22] name of the lord hallelujah
[1:26:26] so again in john chapter 3 verse 1 there
[1:26:28] was a man of the pharisees named
[1:26:30] nicodemus
[1:26:32] a ruler of the jews and the same
[1:26:36] came to jesus by night
[1:26:40] and said unto him rabbi we know that
[1:26:42] thou
[1:26:43] art a teacher come from god
[1:26:47] for no man can do these miracles that
[1:26:49] thou doest
[1:26:51] accept god be with him and jesus
[1:26:54] answered and said unto him verily
[1:26:56] verily i say unto thee except a man be
[1:27:01] born again he cannot see
[1:27:04] the kingdom of god without the new birth
[1:27:07] will not see what god is doing
[1:27:10] amen nicodemus saith unto him
[1:27:13] how can a man be born when he is old
[1:27:18] can he enter the second time into his
[1:27:20] mother's womb
[1:27:22] and be born jesus answered verily verily
[1:27:26] i say unto thee
[1:27:27] except a man be born of water
[1:27:31] the natural birth and of the spirit the
[1:27:34] spiritual birth
[1:27:35] he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:27:38] of god amen well we're all born of water
[1:27:43] amen but are we born of the spirit amen
[1:27:46] amen well if you're born of the spirit
[1:27:49] you have the nature of that spirit
[1:27:51] the holy ghost and are you really
[1:27:53] reflecting the nature of the holy ghost
[1:27:55] as jesus did amen in his day
[1:27:59] grace and he said that which is born of
[1:28:01] the flesh's flesh
[1:28:03] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:28:06] spirit and brother it's the holy spirit
[1:28:10] amen not just a human spirit it's the
[1:28:12] holy spirit
[1:28:14] hallelujah and marvel not that i
[1:28:18] said unto thee ye he must be born
[1:28:21] again and brother if god required the
[1:28:24] new birth then
[1:28:25] god required a new birthing wesley and
[1:28:28] lutheran the pentecostals
[1:28:30] god requires a new birth in you and me
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:33] because with the new birth here comes
[1:28:35] the new nature
[1:28:36] with the new birth you get a you get the
[1:28:38] revelation of that new nature
[1:28:40] you've got to get an understanding of
[1:28:42] that new nature and what god
[1:28:44] is doing amen not what
[1:28:48] the all you have the religious people
[1:28:49] are doing spiritual
[1:28:51] now there's too many people that are
[1:28:53] religious
[1:28:55] we got a lot of religious people around
[1:28:56] the message oh yeah
[1:28:58] that's right oh but how many are
[1:29:00] spiritual amen
[1:29:01] your religious ones oh god did this god
[1:29:04] did that thank you lord i believe it
[1:29:05] thank you thank you
[1:29:06] no god said what's up what am i doing
[1:29:08] that's what i did what am i doing
[1:29:11] amen again it's like i said when i was
[1:29:13] in
[1:29:14] a church years ago and many years ago
[1:29:17] and i was at i was on the platform and
[1:29:20] we did this and we did that there was a
[1:29:23] maybe an altar call
[1:29:24] or like i said it might have been people
[1:29:25] coming up around the altar back in that
[1:29:27] age
[1:29:28] you know in a service after the sermon
[1:29:30] oh they were
[1:29:31] waiting for the invitation waiting for
[1:29:32] the getting to the song service
[1:29:34] and believers would make it to the altar
[1:29:36] and start to pray
[1:29:37] and rededicate themselves to the lord
[1:29:39] and as i said i know right now
[1:29:41] that on my mind by my left there
[1:29:45] there was two sisters come up and they
[1:29:47] were standing there
[1:29:48] oh yeah they had their hands up and
[1:29:50] worshipping and i said oh lord
[1:29:53] i said something wrong with them amen i
[1:29:55] said they're not going to make it
[1:29:57] oh my lord have mercy yeah they went out
[1:30:01] but then they left the message and they
[1:30:02] went on into the world
[1:30:04] that's right why because because they
[1:30:07] they weren't in the holy ghost in their
[1:30:08] soul
[1:30:09] they had anointing in their flesh but
[1:30:11] not in the soul amen
[1:30:12] amen and probably god identified those
[1:30:15] things as well
[1:30:16] amen oh yeah he experienced those things
[1:30:20] he he he met people like that amen
[1:30:23] and brothers there's time that's why
[1:30:25] sometimes that when
[1:30:26] in the in the altar when he when he had
[1:30:28] a prayer line and so on
[1:30:30] and this one would come they said
[1:30:32] brother brown what did you do this for
[1:30:33] what you do that for you say oh you say
[1:30:35] uh okay sister okay brother okay yeah
[1:30:38] just go on
[1:30:39] and trust the lord because he knew they
[1:30:42] were gonna die
[1:30:44] or maybe he knew they were dead
[1:30:45] spiritually oh yeah they said that's why
[1:30:48] you did that yes
[1:30:49] that's why i did it he said that that
[1:30:52] god wasn't going to heal him
[1:30:53] god didn't heal them and they died and
[1:30:56] brother
[1:30:57] again like i said when i when i saw this
[1:30:59] one come and that one come
[1:31:01] i said oh lord i said they don't have
[1:31:02] the anointing
[1:31:04] that that you want us to have grace to
[1:31:06] us amen
[1:31:08] that's why the bible says let's make our
[1:31:10] calling
[1:31:11] and our election sure amen
[1:31:15] it's not you're not making it sure just
[1:31:16] become a church here amen
[1:31:18] it's in your personal relationship with
[1:31:20] jesus
[1:31:21] amen trust him by grace that we're here
[1:31:25] because it's the result of that personal
[1:31:27] relationship with jesus
[1:31:28] and he's leading me by grace amen
[1:31:32] to god be the glory brother let's make
[1:31:35] sure that we're born again
[1:31:37] brother is not not in the outside man
[1:31:40] but in the in the soul
[1:31:42] that's right if you're born in the soul
[1:31:44] then by the grace of god
[1:31:45] you're going to focus on the spiritual
[1:31:47] the spiritual the spiritual what god
[1:31:49] is doing thank you jesus for what you
[1:31:51] did the lord
[1:31:53] uh oh you're doing this i want to be a
[1:31:55] part of that don't let me miss it lord
[1:31:57] don't let me miss the resurrection don't
[1:31:59] let me miss the rapture
[1:32:01] yeah grace oh well
[1:32:04] well i i would say listen there's two
[1:32:07] about two million
[1:32:08] or more believers around the world for
[1:32:10] this message
[1:32:12] yeah and
[1:32:15] when the bride goes they won't know
[1:32:17] she's gone
[1:32:19] so if 2 million left we won't know
[1:32:22] but the probably god said there might be
[1:32:23] 200. yeah
[1:32:26] that'll go into rapture living saints oh
[1:32:28] yeah and
[1:32:29] even even narrowed it down to a dozen
[1:32:32] one time
[1:32:33] he said there might be a dozen because
[1:32:35] when the bride goes you won't know she's
[1:32:37] gone
[1:32:38] amen that's why that when god begins to
[1:32:41] move in the fulfillment of his word
[1:32:42] and this is happening and that's
[1:32:44] happening amen scripture is being
[1:32:45] fulfilled
[1:32:46] air here here amen and they'll say oh i
[1:32:49] thought there would be a rapture
[1:32:50] yeah it was because you missed it and
[1:32:53] you did you didn't know it it already
[1:32:54] happened since you didn't know
[1:32:56] i pray the grace of god that we're going
[1:32:58] to walk in the spirit live in the spirit
[1:33:00] so that why the holy ghost is keeping us
[1:33:02] conscious of spiritual things
[1:33:04] he's keeping the spirit conscious of
[1:33:05] what god is doing amen and brother what
[1:33:08] god has done
[1:33:09] by grace amen brother again
[1:33:13] they were looking for this looking for
[1:33:14] that jesus that i am
[1:33:16] amen amen there's a world looking for it
[1:33:19] i am amen what you're looking for i
[1:33:22] am amen the resurrection and the rapture
[1:33:26] amen what of the bride because he as
[1:33:29] he came to redeem us as i said
[1:33:31] spiritually
[1:33:32] and now he come back to redeem us
[1:33:34] physically oh he has to take us on to
[1:33:37] eternity amen amen amen
[1:33:41] don't want to miss that physical
[1:33:42] redemption that's right
[1:33:44] by the grace of god amen well oh i got
[1:33:47] an experience
[1:33:48] oh you can have it in your flesh as the
[1:33:50] prophet said you can have the holy ghost
[1:33:52] in your flesh
[1:33:52] 24 hours a day and go to hell amen
[1:33:56] amen we want it in our souls amen
[1:34:00] because god is working from the inside
[1:34:02] out by the grace of god
[1:34:04] he said the devil is working from the
[1:34:06] outside in
[1:34:07] amen he's working in our flesh he's
[1:34:09] working in our emotions he's working in
[1:34:11] our feelings and so on
[1:34:13] amen amen all this this again as the
[1:34:16] prophet said you can have it 24 hours a
[1:34:18] day go to hell
[1:34:19] amen that's right because the heart is
[1:34:21] not right
[1:34:23] amen oh oh in their flesh they might
[1:34:26] dress right
[1:34:27] and talk right and act right but
[1:34:30] in their hearts there's something wrong
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:34] well god see again god why is this one
[1:34:37] going to hell then well they're nice
[1:34:38] people
[1:34:39] but see we look at them and we see this
[1:34:42] what does god see
[1:34:43] amen amen god sees the heart
[1:34:47] amen amen oh you can you can make
[1:34:50] yourself
[1:34:50] oh yeah and elsa over there that brother
[1:34:52] is nice that sister is nice they got a
[1:34:54] nice attitude nice there's that
[1:34:56] god looks and says why there's
[1:34:59] there's serpent seed what
[1:35:02] oh but they're nice no he said i i see
[1:35:04] in the heart it's not so nice
[1:35:06] what god sees in your heart amen
[1:35:10] amen this is what god's looking at the
[1:35:12] inside of the inside
[1:35:14] amen and yet there are those that seem
[1:35:16] to be so good
[1:35:17] physically but they're miserable
[1:35:20] and oh yeah wicked spiritually
[1:35:25] oh yeah i've met people but they were so
[1:35:28] nice and they were good
[1:35:29] yeah but let the pressure come on them
[1:35:31] for the word
[1:35:33] see what they're going to do amen
[1:35:36] god help us brother the pressure's
[1:35:38] coming on us to believe
[1:35:40] amen that we've been born again the
[1:35:43] pressure's on us to believe
[1:35:44] that we are looking for the resurrection
[1:35:47] rapture
[1:35:49] how much longer is it going to go on how
[1:35:52] much longer
[1:35:53] are we going to endure this whole world
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:57] because i tell you the devil is getting
[1:35:59] more and more and more control
[1:36:02] oh yeah they're turning everything over
[1:36:04] this way doing this doing this
[1:36:06] yeah and yet it's going to be so close
[1:36:08] that would receive the very elective
[1:36:10] possible
[1:36:10] that's amazing what it's going to be so
[1:36:14] close to reality

[1:36:19] elect if possible
[1:36:21] amen wars brother sister we better be on

[1:37:18] now oh
[1:37:19] oh he brought me into the message yeah
[1:37:21] but what for
[1:37:22] yeah the devil also brings us to the
[1:37:24] message

[1:37:29] the first evangelist
[1:37:30] in the in the earth the devil was okay

[1:37:40] yeah yeah god said yes god said not the
[1:37:43] devil
[1:37:43] he was saying yeah yet god said amen
[1:37:46] and he was using the serpent there you
[1:37:48] know that creature back there then
[1:37:50] amen to deceive eve
[1:37:54] amen and well yeah he used the serpent
[1:37:58] and he was talking through the serpent
[1:38:00] and that is the missing link
[1:38:01] between man and beast because god cursed
[1:38:04] him
[1:38:05] oh yeah people think man man began as a
[1:38:08] monkey as this and as that
[1:38:09] no no the serpent was that was the

[1:38:17] close to the to each other
[1:38:20] oh yeah that in the relationship that
[1:38:23] eve had with the serpent
[1:38:25] she brought forth cain amen i don't
[1:38:28] think it's all spiritual no no there was
[1:38:30] a physical thing going on

[1:38:35] add the nature
[1:38:36] of the devil amen but
[1:38:40] she brought forth also after that she
[1:38:42] went and she showed a e
[1:38:44] adam this and out of that and of course
[1:38:46] then she bore a child for adam
[1:38:48] and he had the nature of adam and
[1:38:50] redemption
[1:38:52] praise the lord amen he did one thing
[1:38:55] k did another but they both worshipped
[1:38:59] they both worshipped god amen that's
[1:39:02] right amen
[1:39:03] oh brother and even today god's seed
[1:39:06] serpent's seed brother both worshiping

[1:39:53] this church
[1:39:53] oh my he had all the the fruit of the
[1:39:56] field that he grew this and grew this
[1:39:57] and in the vegetables maybe and they put

[1:40:32] and i thought oh covered blood i felt
[1:40:35] bad about it but then oh i said that's
[1:40:37] good
[1:40:38] i said as long as it's the blood of
[1:40:39] jesus amen
[1:40:42] to show the redemption for us oh yeah
[1:40:44] because he felt the oh bill joe preacher
[1:40:46] so hard

[1:40:54] on my right said he had
[1:40:55] the last pew there and oh so i never
[1:40:58] heard that again but he said
[1:40:59] it's the it's the truth oh yeah i don't
[1:41:02] know what what he believes or where he
[1:41:04] is now he might be gone on
[1:41:05] on on to his eternal reward somewhere
[1:41:07] pray god rest his soul
[1:41:09] if he's gone but he said oh brother
[1:41:11] that's the truth
[1:41:12] after the service he said i've never
[1:41:14] heard these things before but he said
[1:41:15] what you said

[1:43:43] believers that we're baptized today amen

[1:43:51] nurturing their relationship continue on
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:54] not just physically but spiritually amen
[1:43:57] if you let the spiritual part have
[1:43:59] control of you and your soul amen
[1:44:01] god will control you physically by grace
[1:44:06] make sure it's not god in your head it's
[1:44:07] god in your heart
[1:44:09] not god in your flesh god in your soul
[1:44:11] amen by the grace of god
[1:44:13] because brother branham even during the
[1:44:16] end of his ministry
[1:44:18] he found he was discovering that even
[1:44:19] those in his own church
[1:44:24] were not representing the word as they
[1:44:25] should oh yeah he preached he preached
[1:44:27] argument
[1:44:30] he preached church order that was one of
[1:44:32] the hard messages and he preached
[1:44:34] other messages and as our brother
[1:44:35] fulcher not by the foster brother
[1:44:37] brother lee vale asked brother branham
[1:44:42] and he said brother our brother brother
[1:44:44] emmanuel
[1:44:45] and he said brother manuel he said do
[1:44:47] you know why
[1:44:50] the prophet preached church order
[1:44:54] and the prophet said well i guess he
[1:44:56] just preached it or brother manuel
[1:44:57] said i guess he preached it just to just
[1:45:00] keep his church in line
[1:45:02] with the word you know in order and the
[1:45:05] right time for this the right time for
[1:45:06] that
[1:45:09] and he said well brother i'll be honest
[1:45:10] with you he said he preached church
[1:45:12] order
[1:45:14] he said because he said there was too
[1:45:15] many in the church
[1:45:17] with gifts but they were not true gifts
[1:45:19] of god
[1:45:20] amen he said so he said he had he was
[1:45:22] trying to bring
[1:45:23] bring a stop to it amen and bring it
[1:45:26] under control
[1:45:27] because sometimes that they would go
[1:45:29] into that church
[1:45:30] and for the for oh the prophet be
[1:45:33] waiting before he come to the pulpit
[1:45:34] or brother levail waiting till before he
[1:45:37] come to the pulpit
[1:45:38] so long it might be an hour two hours
[1:45:41] why because there were those in in the
[1:45:43] assembly there those in the audience
[1:45:45] there
[1:45:45] felt they had this gift and that gift
[1:45:48] and they were manifesting gifts they
[1:45:50] spoke and interpreted this spoken said
[1:45:52] this
[1:45:52] all they said oh thus saith the lord
[1:45:54] thus saith the lord oh yeah they were
[1:45:56] standing on their feet
[1:45:58] and brother neville said well brother he
[1:46:01] said
[1:46:01] brother brown knew that most of those
[1:46:03] gifts were false
[1:46:04] amen the result of false anointings and
[1:46:07] he said that's why he preached church
[1:46:09] order
[1:46:10] and he told him he said to to meet
[1:46:12] together
[1:46:14] before the service started to meet
[1:46:16] together somewhere in that room
[1:46:18] and he said and and let the lord speak
[1:46:20] and let the lord do this
[1:46:21] and he said let's let the brothers that
[1:46:24] that are also there
[1:46:25] some of the elders oh yeah write it down
[1:46:27] copy it
[1:46:28] and and if they feel it's the lord give
[1:46:30] it to the pastor to read
[1:46:32] yeah so he said brother that's why he
[1:46:34] did it because he said you bring under
[1:46:36] control the false anointings
[1:46:38] amen and the false gifts that were there
[1:46:41] oh yeah and again as i s i highlighted
[1:46:44] to it to you here

[1:46:48] certain message and i said look i want
[1:46:50] you to notice
[1:46:52] i said he's preaching it in branham

[1:47:02] said i want you to hear this oh you have
[1:47:04] three kinds of believers
[1:47:05] and he said listen he said remember he

[1:47:24] two sisters and they weren't
[1:47:26] they weren't real young and as i said
[1:47:29] they're in the message but the message

[1:47:52] controlling what you do
[1:47:54] what you say what you think amen see

[1:49:44] check and how will i prove it well
[1:49:48] compare your your life to the word of
[1:49:50] god
[1:49:52] the word of god in flesh look what it
[1:49:54] did is it doing that in you
[1:49:56] amen is he in control amen
[1:50:01] so it's first john chapter 5.
[1:50:08] amen
[1:50:13] oh god have mercy
[1:50:17] and let's start with verse 1.
[1:50:22] whosoever believeth that jesus is the
[1:50:25] christ
[1:50:26] is born of god amen
[1:50:31] jesus is the anointed one jesus is god
[1:50:34] we're not into a trinity amen
[1:50:39] and everyone that loveth him that beget
[1:50:43] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[1:50:46] amen praise the lord
[1:50:50] brother if anything is in the bride is
[1:50:52] love
[1:50:53] because god is love amen
[1:50:57] and again there's that catholic priest
[1:51:00] said to do
[1:51:01] regarding brother branham and when he
[1:51:02] when he was killed in the accident
[1:51:04] and they interviewed him about william
[1:51:06] branham and he knew william branham he
[1:51:08] had met william branham
[1:51:09] he had fellowship william branham and uh
[1:51:12] well while he's going to hell no
[1:51:16] as i said be careful what you say and
[1:51:19] compare what you think about those out
[1:51:21] there
[1:51:21] leave them with the lord and move on and
[1:51:23] you plead the token
[1:51:25] amen so and and why because i said
[1:51:28] listen
[1:51:28] they're not in the city but there's
[1:51:30] going to be many outside the city
[1:51:32] that's right and the only thing that's
[1:51:34] going to keep them keep them away
[1:51:36] is is the wrong spirit in their hearts
[1:51:39] amen the wrong thoughts and motives and
[1:51:41] objectives in their lives
[1:51:42] amen so we pray the grace of god to them
[1:51:47] but he said whosoever believeth that
[1:51:48] jesus is the christ is born of god
[1:51:51] and everyone that loveth him that beget
[1:51:53] love of them also that is begotten
[1:51:56] of him amen how can you have an
[1:51:58] experience with god are going to be born
[1:52:00] again
[1:52:01] with that anointing in your life and not
[1:52:03] have divine love
[1:52:05] in control amen
[1:52:08] again as that catholic man said he said
[1:52:10] if you knew anything about william
[1:52:12] branham
[1:52:13] when you when you met him he said you
[1:52:14] knew he loved you
[1:52:16] he said because he had that anointing he
[1:52:18] had that that within him
[1:52:20] and with him was divine love
[1:52:23] oh yeah that's what he said and that was
[1:52:25] that's recorded maybe in in the paper
[1:52:26] that uh
[1:52:27] the newspaper that i got that from the
[1:52:30] jeffersonville that time
[1:52:31] oh yeah i got to copy that newspaper and
[1:52:35] and the article is there concerning
[1:52:36] william branham's death and they
[1:52:38] interviewed this one interviewed that
[1:52:39] one and so on
[1:52:41] after the accident and brother
[1:52:44] again i think the ones that really
[1:52:48] fought against william branham will be
[1:52:50] the ones maybe
[1:52:51] mainly mainly pentecostal or something
[1:52:53] like that but brother
[1:52:56] to those that had a relationship with
[1:52:58] jesus no matter how
[1:52:59] a minor it was whatever i think they
[1:53:02] respected william branham because he
[1:53:04] respected
[1:53:04] them amen
[1:53:09] amen do we love them as as jesus loved
[1:53:12] us
[1:53:14] if you've got experience with jesus you
[1:53:16] have jesus spirit
[1:53:19] you have his attitude you have his
[1:53:20] anointing god help us
[1:53:22] amen
[1:53:25] so he said in verse 2 by this we know
[1:53:28] that we love the children of god
[1:53:30] when we love god and keep his
[1:53:33] commandments
[1:53:35] for this is the love of god that we keep
[1:53:38] his commandments and his commandments
[1:53:40] are not grievous
[1:53:42] no we love to stay with the word amen
[1:53:46] not not everybody will will love that
[1:53:49] your stand for the word
[1:53:51] yeah pray god recognizes it and
[1:53:54] appreciates it
[1:53:55] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[1:53:58] the world
[1:53:59] see if you're born again you've overcome
[1:54:02] the influence of the world the flesh
[1:54:04] the devil amen
[1:54:08] and he said this is the victory that
[1:54:10] overcometh the world
[1:54:11] even our faith amen
[1:54:14] we're going by faith not by sight amen
[1:54:18] no no don't go by your feelings don't go
[1:54:21] about what you're seeing
[1:54:22] no no you go by what you're believing in
[1:54:24] your heart
[1:54:26] that god is in control in your heart
[1:54:29] god's in control in your soul and again
[1:54:31] sons and daughters of god are led by the
[1:54:32] spirit of god
[1:54:33] amen and i tell you if you're lived by
[1:54:35] the spirit
[1:54:37] you line up with the word now if you
[1:54:40] live by the spirit
[1:54:41] it's the word that controls you oh yeah
[1:54:43] because the spirit is going to lead you
[1:54:45] according to
[1:54:46] the word amen amen amen
[1:54:50] praise the lord hallelujah trust him by
[1:54:53] grace that's why we're here
[1:54:55] and trusted by grace that's where young
[1:54:57] ones were baptized
[1:54:59] in water they were hungry and thirsting
[1:55:03] god was dealing with them they knew what
[1:55:05] the word said
[1:55:06] they said we'll do it amen
[1:55:09] thank god i pray god continue to deal
[1:55:12] with even the
[1:55:13] the other young ones amen because that
[1:55:16] all has to do with salvation
[1:55:19] and when it comes to being saved we have
[1:55:22] to be born again
[1:55:23] in a relationship with jesus
[1:55:26] if you got a real relationship with
[1:55:28] jesus he'll bring you to that new birth
[1:55:31] oh yeah so the grace of god jesus is
[1:55:34] controlling you
[1:55:35] you're not living for yourself no not by
[1:55:38] any means
[1:55:38] you're living for jesus amen it's jesus
[1:55:41] living in you
[1:55:43] amen and you're living for one another
[1:55:46] but not for yourself grace
[1:55:50] amen why because you want you want to
[1:55:53] please god
[1:55:54] amen so you lay down your life for him
[1:55:58] hallelujah to do what he wants you to do
[1:56:00] grace
[1:56:03] so by this we know that we love the
[1:56:05] children of god
[1:56:06] when we love god and keep
[1:56:09] his commandments so not just
[1:56:13] oh i got a relationship with god yeah
[1:56:14] but you you're going to be constantly
[1:56:16] lining up with the word
[1:56:18] amen no matter what you do when you do
[1:56:21] it how you do it where you do it
[1:56:23] you're led by the spirit amen you're
[1:56:26] doing it for the glory
[1:56:28] of god amen
[1:56:31] and said for this is the love of god
[1:56:34] that we keep
[1:56:34] his commandments and his commandments
[1:56:37] are not grievous
[1:56:38] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[1:56:41] the world
[1:56:42] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:56:45] the world
[1:56:46] even our faith amen
[1:56:50] who is he that overcometh the world but
[1:56:53] he that believeth that jesus
[1:56:56] is the son of god amen
[1:57:00] and this is he that came by water and
[1:57:02] blood
[1:57:03] even jesus christ not by water only
[1:57:07] no but by water and blood and it is the
[1:57:11] spirit that bears witness because the
[1:57:13] spirit
[1:57:14] is truth amen
[1:57:17] and there are three that bear record in
[1:57:20] heaven
[1:57:20] the father the word and the holy ghost
[1:57:24] and these three are one amen
[1:57:28] and brother there's that wonders there's
[1:57:29] that unity and brother if we got the
[1:57:31] holy ghost
[1:57:33] he's reflecting that oneness and that
[1:57:34] unity among believers
[1:57:37] oh yeah is one by the grace of god
[1:57:42] and there are three that bear witness in
[1:57:44] earth the spirit
[1:57:46] the water and the blood and these three
[1:57:49] agree in one amen
[1:57:53] and again he said if we receive the
[1:57:55] witness of men the witness of god is
[1:57:57] greater
[1:57:58] amen don't follow human relation
[1:58:01] leadership follow god's holy ghost
[1:58:03] leadership amen
[1:58:10] for this is the witness of god which has
[1:58:12] testified of his son
[1:58:14] and he that believeth on the son of god
[1:58:16] at the witness in himself
[1:58:18] he that believeth not god has made him a
[1:58:21] liar oh my lord grace
[1:58:23] please that we believe the word
[1:58:27] and we love god we're going to stay with
[1:58:29] god not my will father
[1:58:31] thine be done amen
[1:58:35] it says god has the witness in himself
[1:58:38] he that believeth not god has made him a
[1:58:40] liar
[1:58:40] because he believeth not the record that
[1:58:42] god gave
[1:58:44] of his son and this is the record that
[1:58:47] god hath given to us eternal life
[1:58:50] and the life is in his son and he that
[1:58:53] had the son hath life and he that hath
[1:58:55] not the son of god hath not life eternal
[1:58:58] life
[1:58:59] and these things have i written unto you
[1:59:02] that believe on the name
[1:59:03] of the son of god that ye may know that
[1:59:06] ye have eternal life
[1:59:08] and that ye may believe on the name of
[1:59:10] the son of god
[1:59:12] and this is the confidence that we have
[1:59:15] in him
[1:59:16] that if we ask anything according to
[1:59:19] his will he heareth us
[1:59:23] yeah not just anything but anything
[1:59:26] according to his will
[1:59:28] amen and if we know that he hear us
[1:59:33] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:59:35] the petitions that we desired
[1:59:37] of him amen
[1:59:45] under verse 18 says we know that
[1:59:47] whosoever is born of god
[1:59:48] sinneth not well some people say oh
[1:59:53] the least mistake you make you sin no no
[1:59:56] you don't sin
[1:59:58] habitually or the bible says if we sin
[2:00:02] we have an advocate amen
[2:00:05] that's right but again when we read when
[2:00:08] i
[2:00:08] studied the scripture there concerning
[2:00:10] sin and it says when it comes to sin
[2:00:12] among believers you're talking about
[2:00:14] habitual sin you do not commit habitual
[2:00:17] sin
[2:00:18] no no because you've been delivered from
[2:00:19] it the enemy might trick you into it
[2:00:22] but so as what he said if we sin we have
[2:00:24] an advocate
[2:00:25] with the father jesus christ the
[2:00:27] righteous
[2:00:28] he's there to defend us by the grace of
[2:00:31] god
[2:00:32] amen shoulder don't condemn the brother
[2:00:35] or sister for this for this
[2:00:36] pray for them and move on amen
[2:00:40] by the grace of god there goes you but
[2:00:43] for the grace of god
[2:00:45] amen
[2:00:48] and it says but he that is begotten of
[2:00:50] god keepeth himself
[2:00:52] and that wicked one toucheth him not and
[2:00:54] we know
[2:00:55] that we are of god and the whole world
[2:00:58] lieth in wickedness
[2:01:00] and we know that the son of god has come
[2:01:02] and has given us an understanding
[2:01:05] amen i pray god give us understanding
[2:01:08] of the word that he's been ministering
[2:01:10] today amen
[2:01:12] that we may know him that is true and we
[2:01:15] are idiom that is true
[2:01:17] even in his son jesus christ this is the
[2:01:20] true god
[2:01:21] and eternal life little children
[2:01:24] keep yourself from idols yes god help us
[2:01:29] oh yeah the enemy is there to all
[2:01:33] to get to get your attention to idols
[2:01:35] this idol that all this becomes your
[2:01:37] idol that becomes your idol
[2:01:39] why because you put more answers on that
