Genesis 19. read beginning from the 27th verse through to the 29th verse and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and behold all the land of the plain and be held and lo the smoke of the country went up as a smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the witch lot dwelt may be seated before I before I speak on on what the Lord's put on my heart tonight there was I was listening as I was coming up here I was in New Orleans here for for work and I and I drove up today which is a little bit of a drive and so I had the opportunity to listen to a message and and the message I listened to was I stand at the door and knock and in there brother Branham you know gives the example and he uses it in many places he talks about he said if I was hungry and somebody gave me 25 cents he said you know I could be just as happy with that as with the bread that I need but in this message he he went on in a little bit more detail because and I think it's something that maybe we miss so the purchase power is is is equivalent to the faith that we that we get when we you know that's the piece but but the but the prophet preached another message that said tested Faith produces goods and we're maybe not accustomed to the fact that many times God tests us a little bit with our faith because you don't need faith if your need is met if God comes tonight and you reach out and you you get an instant healing an instant answer well there's no faith being exercised too much there but but the faith is what stands there in the place of the thing that you hope for that's what the Bible says it's an actual substance and so and so brother Brandon said I'm just as good with this 25 cents in my hand but I want you to notice some things he said that really kind of struck me he said he said I get this 25 cents and he said I go down the street and you said I cross over the river and I go through the Briar Patch so you know he doesn't get the bread rate off doesn't happen overnight sometimes he said I'm getting hungrier I'm getting hungrier all the time he said I haven't got the bread yet but all the time I'm going I'm rejoicing because I've got the purchase power but not just the purchase power brother Brenham said but the assurance that the bread belongs to me and that's the thing the devil I think gets a lot of us out is is we believe that God can do it we believe God can heal us we believe God can deliver us we believe God can save our loved ones he can do it but you got to go from the can to the will that God will do it that it's mine it's not just possible but that it's going to happen and that's where the faith comes in so he said he said I've got to purchase power and the assurance that the bread belongs to me and he goes on he said before I get there he said I might have cramps I'm so hungry so I might have cramps I I might get Delirious he said Till I'm fighting my way through the bushes like a madman he said I could get like that that's how bad it could get but as long as I'm holding the 25 cents he said the bread has got to come it has got to come so what is the devil doing when you get that faith in a service that the Lord is going to meet your need now the devil's trying to get you to lose that 25 cents you've got it in your hand but he's trying to knock it out of your hand about a year ago into the story for another day but I was running I run a little bit for exercise and I was going across the road street with a follow I was ahead of him and this lady was coming in a car I thought she saw me but she didn't and she was traveling fairly quickly and I got hit and thrown about 20 feet in the air but I had pulled my phone out because I was near the end of my run and it and it knocked the phone out of my hand but I didn't actually know it did and if it wasn't for the fellow that was there I wouldn't have even got it back probably I wasn't even looking for it because of the distraction so you're you're claiming something you got the 25 cents you're claiming something then the Devil comes along with something else and he tries to get you to let go of that Faith you got but you've got to hold on to that for dear life because that is your Assurance of your victory of whatever it is that you're claiming because God will come through he will he'll come through he'll bring it to pass but we can't prescribe when Prophet said we can't say we can't tell God when he will answer but we can't prescribe when it's going to be now I want to go to my thought I want to speak on the thought of when God remembers when God remembers now God we know the Bible says God he doesn't look like us the Bible says we have never seen God no man has seen God at any time he dwells in another dimension Prophet said he dwells in a place he's a being he dwells in a place but we don't know what he looks like you know he's in that realm that other dimension that we can't see but we know that he can come to this one whenever he chooses to and declare himself but we do notice also in the scripture because God wants to be personal with us that throughout the scriptures we see the Bible describe him with these personal attributes he personifies many of his attributes so we read about God hearing we read about God speaking and and touching and all these things that are human attributes but we see God expressing those and we also read and can see where it speaks about God's mind and about God's memory and about God remembering is where we're coming to but of course God's memory is not like our memory our memory is is not good many times you know it is said that every experience we ever have that that those thoughts and those experiences are all there in our mind our trouble is bringing those memories and those thoughts to the Forefront sometimes it takes a trigger I was somewhere one time many years ago and and I smelt a certain smell and when I smelt that it took me back to when I was in elementary school when my mother used to pack me a lunch in this particular I had a lunch box a yellow lunch box that flipped open I had a service on one side my lunch in the other and she used to tape a dime or 15 cents in the top I'd used to buy milk and all of a sudden that memory which I probably hadn't thought about maybe since then come flooding back just from that trigger but God doesn't need a trigger for his memory because he knows everything that has ever happened or ever will happen but God does remember and and but his his remembrance if you take the definition of remember it just simply means to call to mind and with God he can call to mind any thought at any time and so every promise that God has ever made in the scriptures he has not forgotten it but there's a time when he will bring that thought forward he will remember it it could be triggered by something that we do or it could be just something he does and we want to look at a few examples in the scripture just to build some background for this thought I want to look at Noah first of all we all know the story of Noah how that he was called out that God was going to send a judgment upon the earth a flood of waters he understood that he believed that he preached the message he built an ark and then there was a day that came when God sent the animals in and told Noah it's your turn now to go in the ark and he closes the door I want to look at this timeline there's many descriptions of how the timing of this went I'm just taking one of them they're all fairly close but we know that he went in the ark and he was there for seven days first of all nothing happened no rain brother Bram talks about that I'm not going to take that time so he's there for seven days then the rain begins and it rains for 40 days and 40 nights so now he's in the ARK for 47 days now the purpose of this flood is Noah understands it is to destroy all flesh that breathe the breath well after that 47 days maybe add a couple days if you want pretty much everything was gone then the work was accomplished and and it doesn't say much about what Noah thought but if I was Noah sitting in the yard with what I understood about things I'd be kind of thinking it was soon time to get out you know because the work is done why am I still here but yet we know that the flood covered the Earth for another 150 days after that so now we're up to 197 days why and and I I can't imagine that Noah wouldn't have thought that in his mind you know why is God waiting why is God delaying you know taking me out and maybe somebody has an answer but we know that many times we go through things in life for which the answer escapes us we don't know why it happens and the why question is not wrong it's just the it's the attitude with which we we have it but but wondering why is normal it's normal you remember Gideon in the Bible Gideon was there a faithful man a Believer but but you know he was under the pressure of the enemy all the time and this man this Angel of the Lord comes to Gideon and you remember what he says to him he says you know you you are he calls him a mighty man of Valor now Gideon I'm sure Gideon was just scratching his head over that because how on Earth is that possible I'm a mighty man of Valor and I'm being I'm being overrun by these by this enemy of Israel and and yet he was because God sees you and he sees me differently than we see ourselves because we see our faults and we see our failures and we fail every day brother Brown said we fail every day and so those failures the enemy loves to bring them up he loves to condemn us because of them and and that and that dwelling on those things hinders our faith many times because we think well God's not going to answer my prayer because I'm such a failure but that's not true and that's not the way God sees you but Gideon asked you know asked why and even Jesus you know on the cross Jesus was on the cross there and we know the weight of the sins coming upon his shoulders and as that takes place we know that the the father whose presence he's always felt his whole life and now in his darkest time sometimes that's the way it seems in your darkest trial when you're looking for God it's when he seems to vanish and so he feels the presence of the father pulling away and he cries out he says my God my God why why have you forsaken me why and so the why question is not the problem but remember God never goes far even if he seems away remember Job in the Bible in his trial in his deep trial he went looking for God you read the scripture I look forward I can't find him I look backward I looked left and I look to the right he's not there in fact he even said he even acknowledged that God was hiding himself he was hiding himself but he had a revelation which we all need to have that even if you can't see God he can always see you job said he knew that the Lord knows the way that I take he said he knows where you are there's no pit that's so black that God's eyes can't Pierce down into it there's no place you can be where God doesn't see where you are and so Noah is in the ARK for all this time 150 197 days now but then we come to Genesis 8 and 1. and in Genesis 8 1 we don't see any trigger for this we don't see somebody praying or crying out we're going to see some examples of that but in this case the Bible just simply says and God remembered Noah but God had never forgotten no it's not because he forgot about him but it was time now and when God when God remembers it's because he's about to do something he's about to act the Bible says God remember no every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged but now you look at that and Noah probably recognized he probably heard the win and thought now God is doing something I'm going to get out of here soon but you know he was there for a while another 74 days a God could have dried those Waters up in a day but 74 days he's there the wind's blowing he hears it and all of a sudden as after after 74 days they can see the tops of the mountains so we're getting there but then there's another 40 Days Noah sends out the Raven and the Dove and so on and then there's another 14 days after that and finally the dry land appears and so now you think okay everything's done it's all dried up let's go nope he's there for another 57 days for a total of 382 days over a year no one knew that God was the one that put him in there he was waiting for the god to say it's time to get out he was faithful and we have to be too and so so God linger sometimes sometimes he allows us to go through things but we have to hold on to that 25 cents we have to hold on to that faith God will remember us he will remember us he hasn't forgotten us and that memory will come at some point to mind and then he'll begin to act on our behalf the Bible says in the Book of Psalms that many are the afflictions of the righteous and that word afflictions means hardships or perplexing circumstances it's not just sicknesses it could be anything many are the afflictions of the righteous we're not talking about the world they have their troubles but the righteous have all these problems and there are many of them so so that shouldn't surprise us that we have many it's not because we're bad it's not because we're failures yes sometimes we bring trouble on ourselves but even if we aren't if we're doing the best we can the devil brings lots our way but we have a promise the Lord delivereths us out of them all there's not one circumstance there's not one trial that you will ever face that God will not bring you out of he will now there is something unique about the memory of God in the mind of God we said God's memory is perfect and all of that it's not like ours but he has this other unique ability and that is God is capable and able to forget a memory the Bible speaks in Micah about the Sea of God's forgetfulness but I want to read this quote because brother Branham really states that well in the message Investments he said when your sins are confessed and your sins are dropped into the bleach of the blood of the son of God he said it remits sin so much it's put in the sea of God's forgetfulness notice this now it can never be remembered in his sight anymore we remember that's the problem that's the problem with our memories we remember things that we should be forgetting and we forget the things we should be remembering but God's able to actually forget it completely it's gone and so that's why you have to be so careful you know when a brother and sister accuses another you know if somebody's put us in under the blood and it's truly been put under the blood and it's forgotten from God and you're accusing them what do you think God thinks about that he doesn't even know what you're speaking of you are falsely accusing your brother or your sister if you take that in the the real truth of it before God if it's been put under the blood it can never be remembered in his sight and he said then what does that make a man he said a son of God God he notices he said God never remembers you to be a sinner imagine we remember that though and that's what that's what a lot of our trouble is we remember those mistakes but God doesn't remember them if we've confessed them he said he doesn't remember you are as a sinner you are a son you are a daughter he said there's no more remembrance of sin at all none he puts it in the sea of forgetfulness the bleach the sea of forgetfulness brother Brown said is Christ's blood that we shed for you and therefore he said then you and you and God are Father and Son by Jesus Christ Grace not by anything you've done but by his grace but you know we we think of those things and we hang on to those things and and we remember them and sometimes we remember other people's sins too as I just said sometimes we have trouble with that if we've been hurt sometimes we have trouble to forgive we were brother Timothy might remember that when we were in Israel we went to this glass Art Museum I remembered we went into this room real dark lit room and they had this sculpture there with these faces on it the kind of blood and it was just a gory looking thing and it was a memory of the Holocaust and the lady that was that was touring us there she said you know this here is so that we will never forget and that we will never forgive I remember all of us yeah you know the people in the room just gasped because that's not the way a Christian is but that was her attitude they were still harboring that from all of those years and it wouldn't be easy if it was you and your family maybe she had relatives you know that that died you know it's possible but she said it's here so we don't forget and we don't forgive but you have got to forgive you might not be able to forget that's just a limitation of these minds but you've got to forgive you've got to forgive so it's it's different you know God thinks differently in that respect but it's important to remember that so when we're approaching God if we put these things under the blood we we can tell the Devil he's a liar when he comes at us with these things because God doesn't know about them they're they're not on your record you say well you know is there going to brother Brandon said when you do wrong you know you're going to get a weapon for it but that's not your problem that's gone he'll do that and we all know that we do wrong things we're going to get a weapon for it but that's all it is God does that and then you keep going on brother Brad said you go on you confess that thing and you go on and you rejoice with a Hallelujah on your heart you don't have to live under condemnation you don't have to do that because you feel like you have to punish yourself you don't have to do that God takes care of whatever needs to be done you are part is just to put that thing by confession under the blood I want to talk about Rachel in the Bible another character who you know Jacob saw her at the well and the and he loved her and wanted to marry her and he served for seven years and then was tricked into taking Leah and then another seven years he served for Rachel well God noticed and it's in the it's in I'm just going to read a few uh selected verses in Genesis 29 and verse 31 that God noticed that Leah was the Bible says hated but really it's that Leah wasn't really loved by Jacob and so the Bible says he opened Leah's womb because of that he opened Leah's womb but Rachel was barren now if you would take it from the perspective of Rachel Rachel could not help that she was born more fair than Leah Rachel could not help that Jacob loved her more than he loved Leah wasn't her fault it was the way God made her so it's like she's being punished and so she's she's Desiring to have children and uh you know uh well in fact neither wife was very happy because Leah I don't think Leah was too concerned about children as she was she wanted Jacob's love you can see that in the scriptures he wanted Jacob's Lobster so she was having children thinking and in fact even in one of the verses it'll say after she had a child now he will love me and it was like that was the only reason she was having but but Rachel Moore wanted the children so that neither wife was very happy and Rachel at one point tells Jacob you know give me children unless I die what could he do about it he wasn't the one that closed her womb but just I want to just go through quickly these of course from these children come the patriarch these are the Patriarchs so Leah has has four children one right after the other the first four Patriarchs and Rachel's still Baron and then as we as we go through we see Rachel has this idea well I can't have children I'm going to offer my maid and so she offers her maid Bill and to Jacob and he has a son by her which was Dan he was the fifth patriarch and then a second son napped a lie which was the sixth patriarch well Leah didn't want to be left out so she offers her maid because at this point Leah had stopped conceiving and so she offers her maid and they have two more children zilpa she has Gad and then Asher's son's seven and eight now we've got eight Patriarchs Rachel still hasn't had any children of her own then the Lord opens Leah's womb again and she Bears her fifth son is a car the ninth patriarch she Bears a sixth son zebulun which became the 10th patriarch now we know there's only two more coming and this happened over a period of years so if you think about from the time that Jacob met Rachel it was 14 years before they even got married and depending on who you you read the scholars say it could have been almost that much time again before we come to Genesis 30 and 22 because in all of this time I know she we see in the scripture where she was after Jacob you know but I believe that Rachel sought the Lord as well that God would open her womb because the Bible says in Genesis 30 and 22 it says and God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb but it was years it was years that it took how many times would Rachel have asked God how many times has she had treated him to to open her womb and then all of a sudden Gods remembers her not that he had forgotten it's not that he didn't know that she was asking but it was now time to bring that thought forward he always intended to open her womb and now the time had come and she opens her womb and of course she has Joseph and then Benjamin dies in childbirth and those are the those are the 12 Patriarchs but you know you can look and say well why was she made the wait so long and other people you know we see in the scripture they they prayed and they got an instant answer that's not up to us the question I think about the parable of the man that hired the workers in the Book of Matthew and he hired some early in the morning and in the if you read it I don't want to take the time because I have a little bit to get through and but he hires them in the morning and he tells them that he's going to give them a penny and so then after he hires them the Bible says the third hour and then you know he goes on the sixth hour and a different times during the day he hired more and in that he said I will give you what's right you didn't say what he was paying them and he'd come up to the 11th hour and he hires someone he's hired some people at the 11th Hour comes to the end of the day and those workers who worked the shortest amount of time got paid first and they got paid a penny as well and of course the people that labored the whole day they didn't like that but you know he said am I not able to do with what I want am I not just and I want you to think about it you know we've been serving the lord I've been I was a boy when when the message came our way and so it's been you know 50 plus years that the message has been that we've been serving the lord in this message and but you know there's going to be people come in at the last hour like the thief on the cross thief on the cross lived his entire life in sin he gets on the cross and he's there and he recognizes and he says Lord remember me remember me he says and here he's in his dying moments but you know those ones that come in in the final hours of this age that we're in which I don't believe we're going to be here a whole lot longer they're going to get the same reward as us but you know I I don't feel bad about that I've got loved ones out there I'll be quite happy if they when they come in not if they come in but when they come in and that's how you have to look at it too when they come in so there will be some that come in and those Final hours gone we'll remember and we'll save those ones now Abraham we know that God gave a promise to Abraham that he would be the father of a great nation and that they would be a stranger in a land would serve them you know for 400 years and so on and we know that that that happened and then it comes down to the time closer to the time of their Deliverance and what happens there I want to go to Exodus 2. in Exodus 2 what's very interesting is that you know the children of Israel went down into Egypt as guests and they were comfortable there and there was no pressure and when it comes time for them to be delivered God had to turn the heat up on them a little bit because they really were enjoying things too much and I want you to think about the time we're in now you know I fear sometimes that we might be a little bit too comfortable but we see what's going on in the world now I know for me and it's not just because I'm getting older but this world is not as nice a place as it used to be and and more and more year after year I feel myself Desiring to move on really there's there's a lot less that I enjoy about this life now because of the sin and because of the direction it's going and I think that that's intentional because the Bible says you know when you see these things become come to pass look up for your Redemption draweth nigh he says that he is coming for those who are looking for him if we're not looking for him I would be a little bit fearful that we might be left behind he's coming for them they were looking it says in Revelation even so Lord Jesus come when we are praying those kind of prayers then I think we're getting really close because that's what happened here Exodus 2 verse 23 it come to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and notice verse 24 here's the trigger in this case and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham he hadn't forgot it but now they were in the condition to receive it and their groaning was that trigger okay it's time to bring that thought forward he remembered his Covenant and he looked upon the children of Israel it says in verse 25 and had respect unto them and from there we know that he begins to call Moses and and and and bring him there for the Deliverance I want to look at Hannah another one in the Bible who had a problem where she was not able to Bear children and she was you know just like Rachel desirous that the Lord would Minister to that and and but she had it you know her husband had another wife penina who who was able to have children and so she rubbed it in a lot to her and and uh and in fact the Bible refers to her as an adversary in many ways you know devil loves to rub things in when things are not going the way you want to or you're trying to to move on with he loves to to rub it in when when you don't seem to be making progress that's just he loves to do that and so she keeps praying she was just so so upset that she finally goes down there to Shiloh and and before the priest and she begins to to speak to him about that and and there the Lord at that time began to Quicken a seed of faith in her heart and the Bible says and just saving time again that she went away from there with that Faith with that 25 cents as it were and and their countenance was no more sad you can read it in the scriptures there and when she comes back from there the Bible says and just for reference sake it's in first Samuel 1 and verse 19. it says they rose up early in the morning early sorry in the morning early and worshiped before the Lord and returned came to their house to Rhema and Elkin knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her Lord remembered her and and and and and the and the next verse actually says when we come to passive when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived she bear a son called his name Samuel Samuel saying because I have asked him of the Lord so God was responding to her prayer it was her prayer he was responding to he was remembering her he was remembering her now I want to go back to the original scripture that we read here and we just read a portion of it but I want to go back and look at this this story and this is when God comes down and visits Abraham with the two angels that were going to go to Sodom and so I want to pick this up and and look at it in just a little bit of detail in Genesis chapter 18. beginning at the 16th verse they're there and they have a have some time of Fellowship together and then it says in the 16th verse that the men rose up from thence and look towards Sodom and Abraham went with him to bring them on the way and of course they're getting ready now to go to Sodom and we know why they're going to Sodom but Abraham doesn't know why they're going to Sodom not just yet and notice verse 17 and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall become shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him and notice this part verse 19 4 I know him for I know him see God knew that when Abraham became aware of what was going on that it was going to cause Abraham to do something that actually made a huge difference in the outcome he said for I know him that he will command his children in his household after him that they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment and that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him so God knew the reaction so he tells Abraham what's going on that they're going to in verse 20 he said because of the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous and Abraham knew this he said I'm going to go down and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which has come unto me and if not I will know and so then the men the two angels turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom and Abraham stood yet before the Lord now it sinks in Abraham realizes what is coming he knows that when they go down there the condition of Sodom that God is not going to let it let it get by and so he's thinking about that and so his response his very next response in the 23rd verse Abraham draws near to the Lord he says wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked now you might think why would Abraham ask that question why would he ask because they're they're all Wicked he asked because he had family there he had a nephew there and and you know lot is referred to as a righteous man but brother Branham said he was really lukewarm and half backslid but he was a believer of some of sorts but he wasn't really where he should be or he wouldn't have been down there in the first place and so Abraham begins to ask these questions you know would you destroy for 50 and for 40 and so on he goes down to 10. and he said well if there's 10 righteous I won't destroy it and then and then they go their separate ways Abraham goes to his place and the Lord goes and he goes home and you know Abraham was probably thinking well is there even ten righteous there and he you know he's doing the math you know it got lot and his wife you got the two daughters maybe maybe their husbands so you're up to about six but and it doesn't mention about any children if they had children but he's he's a little short of 10. and so Abraham probably went to bed that night you know kind of wondering how is this going to turn out how is this going to play out well we flipped the scene over to to Sodom in Genesis 19 and verse 12 the Angels come to lot's house it's interesting why do they go to lot's house we'll find out here soon it says in verse 12 the man said the Lord has that when he hear besides son-in-law and sons and daughters and whatsoever though hassle the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the Cry of them is waxing great before the face of the Lord and the Lord has sent us to destroy it well that's pretty strong words I should have been enough for lot and it did stir him up the Bible says in verse 14 he goes out and speaks to his sons-in-laws which married his daughters and say you know get you out of this place for the Lord will destroy the city but he seemed as one that mocked to his sons he couldn't even convince them the only ones he could convince were his own flesh and blood so it was just the four but the interesting thing is when the morning comes and the 15th verse the morning comes Lots not really ready to go the Bible says when the morning arose the Angels hastened law pressed him urged him saying you need to take your wife and your daughters which are here unless thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city but lot didn't rush to leave verse 16. Wally lingard the Bible said that men laid hold on his hands they weren't really going to go without being forced he said the men laid hold on his hand one upon his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters notice what it says the Lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city so when you look at this lot's salvation as it were from the destruction of Sodom really hadn't didn't have much to do with lot it was the mercy of God but why was it that way why was it that way well let's look at the verse 27. Abraham gets up in the morning probably didn't sleep a whole lot thinking about what might take place the Bible says Abraham gets up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looks over at Sodom and Gomorrah and toward the land of the plain and behold the smoke of the country went up as a smoke of a furnace so he sees the destruction I imagine he's wondering what happened what happens a lot what happened to his family but notice the 29th verse he came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham it wasn't a lot he was remembering it was Abraham and sent lot out lot didn't even want to go out but it was Abraham it was Abraham's request you say I don't know if I believe that well let me tell you what brother Brandon said in hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God brother Branham said speaking about lot he said he'd have never come out he had he'd have never been called out called not even called out if it had not been for the mercy of Abraham the mercy of Abraham can I find 50 men when he asks those questions it was the mercy of Abraham that lot was called out now think about your loved ones that you're praying for you you say what what influence do I have I'm going to read you something towards the end about that but your prayers don't think that they have no effect you might look at them out there and say well they don't seem like they're they're coming any it looks like they're going further away it's going to be your one of these days it's going to be your mercy one of these days God is going to remember you he's going to remember your prayers for your loved ones and he's going to bring them up and you know prayer is so powerful we underestimate it that even the prayers of those that have passed on you know it's God's answers though sometimes after they're gone brother Branham was having a baptismal service for his son Billy Paul and his nephew Melvin in 1950 he was he was getting ready to baptize him and he's he relates this statement he said Heavenly Father 1900 years since the scripture has been written and your promise is still moving on and he said now Lord hear these young people there were two young ladies on his right they've accepted you as their savior they believe the gospel story to my left Lord is my little nephew Melvin and my own boy he said oh God if it's possible this morning that the two mothers could be called to look over the banister and to look down and see their boys now he said how happy I am Lord to know that you answer prayer he said that poor little mother Ruth that would have been Melvin's mother he said that poor little mother Ruth she's gone on years ago but her prayer is answered now prayers answered now she prayed that he would love you and serve you and he's making this stand this morning to these others their mothers maybe has gone on Lord we don't know thou does but whatever he said answer prayer there's another time brother Brown gives an altar call it's actually it was in Shreveport the message love in 1956 and you're probably familiar with this quote but this this piece of the quote was always stood out to me the young people had come to the Altar and brother Branham made the statement he said I feel God that everyone here at this altar has been accepted in your sight that's pretty rare thing you know I've been at youth camps and different times people come to the Altar and a lot of them go through the same and put on the you know go through the same motions but a lot of them walk away the same as they came unfortunately but brother Brown said I believe every one of these at the altar has been accepted he said their names are on the book angels are singing bells of Heaven Are Ringing Satan's defeated and they're moving back down the corners of hell with their black flags draping but I want you to notice this he said the angels have gone to heaven to Rejoice around the throne where mothers and fathers are waiting to hear the message coming back from this meeting he said they've got boys and girls sitting here where loved ones has gone on and they're waiting I believe those loved ones that have gone on it also prayed for them I've got two older brothers that don't serve the Lord my mom and dad prayed for them absolutely all the time and they're both gone but I believe one of these days God's going to remember those prayers you know there's a scripture and it's it's been quoted often in Jeremiah where it talks about God is going to come and perform his good word and that he knows the thoughts that he thinks of us thoughts of peace to give us an expected end you know the the believer we we know what's coming we know what our end is we know where things are going we may not know tomorrow and specifically in our life but we know where this is going to end up and God's got good plans and good things in store for his people but you know the world doesn't have that the sinner doesn't have that but we have that confidence that God has an objective and everything that God brings our way it's with purpose nothing happens just accidental nothing just happens randomly might seem that way to you and it might seem surprising as well sometimes things happen it just shocks you sometimes almost paralyzes you when when you encounter some trials and tests but nothing surprises God he knew it was coming he allowed it to be he may have even ordained it to be but God is is going to bring everything the Bible says all things work together for good to them that love the Lord very simple scripture we quoted all the time but sometimes it's hard to believe that when they're in the middle of the trouble it's hard to believe there's going to be a good outcome how can good come of this but if you're a Believer when you get on the other side of that trial you can look back and and see how God brought you through and the purpose sometimes maybe you won't know all of all the ins and outs of it but God will bring you through it's not all Valley you know the god of the mountain is God in the valley too and so he has plans he's going to give us an expected end you know I read one time Charles Spurgeon said blessed be God it is an expected end he said the ungodly people can only look forward to a dreaded end an end of your foolish mirth an end of your carelessness an end of your boasting he said you fear your end but God will give his people an expected end suppose he said that end should be the coming of Christ oh how we long for it he said brother and the Saints are prepared before they go our Lord does not pluck his fruit on wisely foolish State people he said May tear the green apples from the tree with a pull and a ranch and Bruise them as they throw them into the basket but our Lord values his fruit and he waits until it is quite ripe and he gathers it sometimes we wonder why our loved one's different things but God knows he has a purpose he has a time for everything he doesn't make any mistakes when he puts forth his hand and he said the fruit bows down to it and parts from the bow without a strain when the believer comes to die it will not be to an end in which he feared but to an end which he expected now at the very end of things when the we go to the Book of Revelations when things are wrapping up there's two things that God is going to remember since we're speaking about God's memory in Revelation 18 it talks about how that God will remember the iniquities and the sins of the unrepentant sinner speaks to that in Revelation 18 and 4 and 5. but he also will remember the prayers of the righteous in Revelation 5 and 8. it talks about how that when when he took the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and it talked about they had Harps and golden vials full of odors which were the prayers of the Saints so some of your prayers you know they're they're used now and they're going to accomplish things some of those prayers are going to be poured out one day over there now I was reading one when I was looking at this message in the Book of Malachi and there's a reference in there to something called The Book of remembrance we know there's a book of life and all these things that write your life story and The Sinner and it has a book too it has things that track what happens in their life but there's this it was interesting the way that it reads in Malachi 3 and so I just wanted to to mention this Malachi 3 verse 16. he said then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another which is a good thing for a believer to do to Fellowship but notice what it says the Lord hearkened and heard it so the Lord pays attention to our conversations to the things that we do he said look they that fear the lord speak often one to another the Lord hearkened and heard it and the Book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord so this is very specific to these groups this group of people that fear the lord and that thought upon his name so the contents of this book are things that God took note of in our lives the things that were important that were memorable of those that feared the Lord and verse 17 referring to these people of whom I trust all of us are apart he said and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him God's Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me he's looking at us and mindful of us and so when we look back in our lives we see the flaws and we see all of those things but God as I said earlier looks at us differently than we look at ourselves brother Brown said the things that you do the words that you say and how you treat your neighbor and what you do about Christ will be an everlasting Memorial you know we have the opportunity as Christians that God can because he can forget the sins that we make you know he can edit our record you know like you do when you're typing up something you know you can get that thing just perfect well God's wanting to do that with each one of us yes we make mistakes every day but God just kind of takes care of that so that when the record is done it's all good things and a real good way to look at that is to compare the Old Testament in the New Testament when you look at Hebrews 11 you read Hebrews 11 it's a summary of The Heroes of Faith and you know those those men and women that are referenced because there's women reference there too in those in that scripture you know they had mistakes and made mistakes and if you go to the Old Testament which didn't leave anything out you can read about Abraham and Sarah for example you can see things with Abraham you see Sarah you know we often criticize Sarah oh she she didn't believe how much doubt she had but you know the record in Hebrews of Sarah doesn't mention that Hebrews 11 11 you know it's a memorable actually even a memorable scripture because we know uh you know we we celebrate you call it Veterans Day here but on November 11th the 11th day the 11th month the 11th Hour of the day we call it Remembrance Day at home well on the the 11th verse of the 11th chapter of Hebrews talks about Sarah and I want to read that scripture because this is her this is the summary this is the memory this is what's memorable about Sarah in the New Testament through faith also Sarah faith herself through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered to a child when she was past age why because she judged him faithful who had promised we know Abraham was faithful when we talk about Abraham's Faith but with Sarah we often go back to the Old Testament we often point to the mistake but doesn't mention the mistake here because Sarah did have to come to a place where she believed just like Abraham for her body to be changed it wasn't enough for Abraham to believe she had to believe and she come to that place finally might have took her a little bit longer than him but she got there and that's what God remembers that's what was important enough that it was written of her here in the scripture and so if we can look at if we can I mean that's a good example we look at our lives we can see those times when we weren't very faithful when we've had you know made mistakes and said things that were not very good but if you put those things under the blood they're gone they're gone from the record and then what's left are those good things the times you did reach out in faith the times you did stand those are the things that God will remember of you brother Brown preached a message and I'm going to close here soon in just a few moments with this thought he preached a message called Mother's Day in 1959 he was 50 years old at the time you know and by that time he had lost a number of his loved ones and in that message he was reminiscing about what it would be like when he got over to the other side and he began to meet some of those ones and he he related in that message he said the first one probably he would see would be his baby Sharon and he said you know she she won't be shaking with meningitis when I see her and then he thought about his wife hope he said she won't have those bony hands and the sunken cheeks which is the way he remembered her when she left then he then he mentioned Edward and Charles he said Charles won't be dragging his leg his dad his brother Howard who had got right with the Lord just a few days before he left he was just reflecting on these and then he made the statement after that he said we'll come brother Seward and brother Frank broy brother George the ark always said the resurrection means a lot to me he had a lot of a lot of people that had gone on and and as we get older we have those things too I got my parents and different ones that have gone on soon there'll be more over there maybe than here in many ways you know but he said the resurrection means a lot to me I'm anticipating on that great crowning hour he said as the light begins to spread he said we'll know as we are known and we'll understand and we'll remember our acquaintances the ones that's been here been there and I want you to catch this here and you may have heard this before but this has always been really striking to me it's always been really encouraging to me brother Branham said they'll he said he said many many he said there will be many there that we didn't even think would be there many there think about that can you I can think of people I can think of some of my loved ones right now that if the war was to come tonight I would think I don't know in my flesh he said when we get over there there'll be many there that we didn't even think would be there but I want you to here's the thing why will they be there I want you to notice what he said he said for I know it's at that time I believe that the bread that we have cast upon the human Troubled Waters will return to us upon that day why it was your effort it was my effort what we have shown the seeds that we have sown he said when we see the effects of Our Testimony on people that we didn't understand their action toward it how many times have we tried to witness or we tried to you know shed a light somewhere and it just seemed like it wasn't accomplishing anything but it was but it was we didn't understand why they were acting that he said they'll probably be there what a day that will be and here's what it goes on he said in the seeds that we sowed not even thinking what they would do we just sowed the seeds he said but here they are the seeds that we sowed and who are those seeds he said they brought forth precious fruits those seeds that we sow those seeds that you have sown he said they brought forth precious fruits and we will see them on that day the Wayward loved ones and relatives and we all have them we all have those Wayward loved ones and relatives that we've been trying to sow seeds with and sometimes we don't see seems like it's not do anything but don't stop sowing the seeds because God will remember don't stop praying for them because God will remember one of these days it may not be until we cross over that we see the realization of some of those but that doesn't mean we should stop God will do it God will remember he will remember you he will remember your prayers he knows you maybe the instrument players could come I'd like to sing that song If you know it here or you can sing it he knows my name he knows my every thought he knows what you are going through what you've gone through what you will go through there's nothing that will come your way in this life there's no trial that he will bring you to that he will not bring you through doesn't matter what it is how hard it is it could be difficult but he will bring you through he will be faithful we just need to be faithful amen I
