[54:05] believe we're going to be able to say
[54:07] her name right when we get into glory
[54:09] hey man maybe the Lord is going to leave
[54:12] that name behind amen
[54:14] so we'll have another name by the grace
[54:17] of God so Lord blesses and in Genesis
[54:21] chapter 20 and if our brother bang at
[54:25] one sing we certainly would we wouldn't
[54:27] know it we wouldn't know it but he
[54:30] wouldn't hesitate you know whatever's on
[54:34] your heart do it they do it for the
[54:36] glory of God amen and Genesis 20 and
[54:42] beginning to read at verse 1 and Abraham
[54:46] journeyed from thence toward the south
[54:48] country and dwelt between Kadesh brother
[54:54] John kaduche is here they met and it
[54:58] says he dwelled between Kadesh and Shur
[55:00] and sir Joran in Guerrero and Abraham
[55:06] said of Sarah his wife she is my sister
[55:09] and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and
[55:13] took Sarah because Abram was afraid that
[55:18] maybe that if he knew
[55:22] that it was his wife that the king would
[55:24] kill him so as to get Sara but he said
[55:28] no he said she's my sister and it says a
[55:31] biblical Guerrera sent and took Sara but
[55:35] God came to Abimelech in a dream by
[55:37] night and said to him be old thou art
[55:41] but a dead man for the woman which thou
[55:44] has taken it says for she is a man's
[55:50] wait
[55:51] but if Evelyn had not come near her and
[55:54] he said Lord will thou slay also a
[55:58] righteous nation said he not unto me she
[56:03] is my sister and she even she herself
[56:06] said he is my brother in the integrity
[56:10] of my heart and innocency of my hands
[56:14] have I done this and God said unto Him
[56:17] in a dream
[56:18] yay I know that that it's did did this
[56:22] in the integrity of thy heart for I also
[56:27] where they'll be from sinning against me
[56:30] Amen praise the Lord I thank God for
[56:34] them for the explosion is like a man
[56:38] thank God for the influence in your life
[56:40] and in mine a man but God cares for
[56:43] about us God cared about the King God
[56:47] didn't wanted to do this because he knew
[56:49] that in his heart he didn't we you
[56:51] wouldn't want to do it
[56:52] a man so brother says that God knows
[56:54] your heart
[56:55] God knows what your motives and your
[56:58] objectives are a man they think will
[57:01] bring out when we get back into the
[57:03] message that that I that I have been
[57:04] ministering on hey man you've got to
[57:07] have a right motive and a right
[57:08] objective even if you're asking for
[57:09] healing he said what is your motive what
[57:12] is your objective and he said you're a
[57:13] motive and objection was not right he
[57:15] says you don't deserve a Lee a man the
[57:18] problem of gods for that and yeah I
[57:20] think God is not going to heal it and
[57:21] again I know and there are those that do
[57:24] get good heal and the motive is not
[57:26] right their objective is not right
[57:27] because that's what the prophet of God
[57:29] said you can be healed and go to hell
[57:31] Amen because your motive and objection
[57:34] is not right nature does make sure that
[57:36] our spirit is right or attitude is right
[57:38] removes the writer objectives are right
[57:40] toward God a man and for the glaze off
[57:43] of the glory of God amen no matter what
[57:46] it is lord you appoint the thing that
[57:48] conserves me and for me and let it be
[57:50] for your glory not just for my benefit
[57:53] in the public on sir that's the problem
[57:54] with people today only they want God to
[57:57] do this one God to do that but it's only
[57:58] for their benefit he said amen it not
[58:01] for the glory of God amen so god help us
[58:04] that whatever we do it'll be for his
[58:06] glory whatever we ask God it'll be for
[58:09] the glory of God a man and gods verse 6
[58:13] again and God said unto Him in a dream
[58:15] yeah I know that that it's do this in
[58:17] the integrity of thy heart for I also
[58:21] with LD from sitting against me thank
[58:25] God for that grace in our lives
[58:27] amen and he said therefore suffer die
[58:32] the not to touch her God stepped on the
[58:35] scene praise the Lord and he said verse
[58:39] 7 now therefore restore the man is way
[58:44] showing what god sent on the scene here
[58:47] because of the elected predestinated
[58:49] seat a man Abraham and because of the
[58:55] position that he held before God so God
[58:59] has step on the scene for you and for me
[59:01] because we are the predestinated seat of
[59:04] God a man and that we are the bride of
[59:07] the Lord Jesus Christ thank God for that
[59:10] grace amen and he said now therefore
[59:14] restore the man his wife for he is a
[59:18] prophet a man wonderful and as as he
[59:23] shall pray for thee and thou should live
[59:26] and if thou restorer not know that thou
[59:30] shalt utterly die thou and all that are
[59:34] thine god bless his word you may be
[59:37] seated
[59:38] amen we wanted our sister to come and
[59:42] give her testimony of her experience
[59:44] with the Prophet a man I was
[59:48] I was blessed when she testified at our
[59:51] brother Joseph / Artur
[59:53] last night a man and she was talking
[59:57] about her experience with the prophet of
[59:59] God when her and her husband first met
[1:00:02] the Prophet when they come into the
[1:00:04] presence of the Prophet and I said this
[1:00:07] is amazing I said thank you Lord and
[1:00:09] then it was the grace of God in her life
[1:00:12] from the grace of God in her husband's
[1:00:14] life a man then I just crossed the path
[1:00:17] but brother that the Prophet ministered
[1:00:19] to her a man and brother she can go back
[1:00:23] and and remember it she could go back
[1:00:25] and share with others a man of
[1:00:27] indication that Abraham was a prophet
[1:00:31] sold with him Branham was a prophet a
[1:00:33] man wanted to highlight some of those
[1:00:36] Saints concerning the prophet in the
[1:00:38] Bible from Genesis right on through to
[1:00:40] Revelation because the first time that
[1:00:43] God mentions the Prophet is here in
[1:00:46] Genesis 20 and the last time that God
[1:00:48] mentions the Prophet is in Revelation 20
[1:00:51] to a man and there are those that today
[1:00:56] that feel that the Prophet that is
[1:00:58] mentioned in revelation 22 was Malachi 4
[1:01:01] it was a prophet a man to whom that God
[1:01:05] used for the opening of the seven seals
[1:01:07] and the finishing of the mystery of God
[1:01:09] in the last days and we're sure we were
[1:01:11] sure those scriptures with you later on
[1:01:13] in revelation 22 a man because John was
[1:01:17] going to worship Him amen but he any-any
[1:01:20] forbid John the noise and don't you do
[1:01:22] that and how nice time George well I
[1:01:24] enjoyed one of your brethren the
[1:01:25] prophets that's all and but again they
[1:01:28] even in this day in this hour that we we
[1:01:31] are we've we've dealt with it and we'll
[1:01:32] continue to deal with it there are those
[1:01:34] even in this age and then that are that
[1:01:37] are worshiping brother Branham or that
[1:01:40] summer worshiping his son but again
[1:01:43] whether that's that's not right that a
[1:01:46] that's absolutely a fall spirit so we
[1:01:49] pray the grace of God to give us the
[1:01:51] right spirit the way to revelation
[1:01:52] concerning who with
[1:01:55] and who and what are properties we see
[1:01:57] it right here in Genesis we see it right
[1:01:59] here in Revelation but again whether
[1:02:01] it's not God it is God in the Prophet
[1:02:04] the Prophet is my god no way because
[1:02:06] this prophet right here he refused
[1:02:08] worship and not only they have the
[1:02:11] Prophet in the hell praise the Lord
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:13] I believe this this helps us believe
[1:02:15] that the Prophet in revelation 22 was
[1:02:18] the Malachi 4 because we have it on tape
[1:02:22] where they promised stood behind the
[1:02:24] pulpit and any any found a note any in
[1:02:28] his pocket say brother I put a note in
[1:02:31] his pocket and said that Whitten Branham
[1:02:32] was his Lord that's where he's saying
[1:02:35] I've been when brother Bentham saw the
[1:02:37] note oh my he got up and he ran he
[1:02:39] rebuked that spirit and he said he said
[1:02:42] that's what he said I that's not me in
[1:02:44] and he said I said I am NOT the Lord he
[1:02:47] said don't do don't you ever say those
[1:02:48] things don't you believe those things
[1:02:49] and he said because they said that'll
[1:02:52] make me Antichrist he said you you
[1:02:55] believe that and you say that make me
[1:02:57] out of Christ and if you continue with
[1:02:58] that he said all he said in six months
[1:03:01] he said I'll get out of the ministry he
[1:03:03] said I'll step down he said because he
[1:03:05] said I don't want to be he didn't want
[1:03:07] to be Antichrist so I pray the grace of
[1:03:09] God that we're going to recognize him as
[1:03:11] a prophet a man recognizes is his
[1:03:14] ministry recognized his message but
[1:03:17] brother we're not going to worship Him
[1:03:18] we're going to worship the one that the
[1:03:20] message reveals where were the one that
[1:03:22] we're going to were sure the one that he
[1:03:24] pointed us to the order went to worship
[1:03:26] the one that he was exalting a man as
[1:03:28] the Lord Jesus Christ as our Lord our
[1:03:31] Savior our bridegroom a man he certainly
[1:03:34] didn't want us to worship Him a man so
[1:03:37] by the grace of God I got help us to
[1:03:39] have the right revelation of a prophet
[1:03:42] even though God or God God bless and God
[1:03:45] exalted Abraham but you had a brother
[1:03:48] they're not ordained to worship Abraham
[1:03:50] not by any means no worship the God that
[1:03:53] a brain was representing worship the God
[1:03:56] that Abraham was preaching about worship
[1:03:59] the God that Abraham was exalting a man
[1:04:01] Abraham was giving the glory to God hey
[1:04:04] man look
[1:04:05] with people to come and worsen him a man
[1:04:08] he will point in to the Lord a man
[1:04:10] though the Lord stepped on the scene and
[1:04:12] defended Moses are defended whether
[1:04:15] Abraham because of who he was because of
[1:04:20] the office that he was in as a prophet
[1:04:22] brothers sicilus understand that the
[1:04:25] Prophet is beyond beyond a pastor or a
[1:04:28] teacher or an evangelist or an apostle
[1:04:30] the Prophet goes beyond that and not
[1:04:32] only that even there in Ephesians 2
[1:04:34] where it speaks speaks ability to God
[1:04:37] has said in the church you know this
[1:04:39] fivefold ministry and said a prophet but
[1:04:41] the power God said now he said that's a
[1:04:43] New Testament prophet he said there's
[1:04:45] not an Old Testament prophet that's not
[1:04:47] the prophet that the Bible refers to as
[1:04:50] the spokesman for God a man no it's just
[1:04:54] just someone preaching the word just
[1:04:56] someone teaching the word and so on he
[1:04:58] said that's a New Testament prophet but
[1:05:00] the brother the prophet that we
[1:05:02] recognize in this day an hour is is it's
[1:05:05] recognizing the Old Testament as an Old
[1:05:08] Testament prophet recognized as John was
[1:05:10] a prophet and others were prophets a man
[1:05:12] day that's what we got a recognize we're
[1:05:15] not going to worship them we're going to
[1:05:17] worship the God that they're
[1:05:18] representing we're gonna worship them
[1:05:20] because what is a prophet he is a
[1:05:21] spokesman and he is a spokesman for God
[1:05:24] a man and God deals with prophets in a
[1:05:29] more intimate way that he deals with the
[1:05:31] other part with the rest of the PI PO
[1:05:32] ministry oh yeah God is going to do with
[1:05:35] a prophet in a more personal way than he
[1:05:38] does with the vital ministry the
[1:05:40] anointing is there for the vital
[1:05:41] ministry but for the Prophet it's in a
[1:05:44] greater way a man so god help us to
[1:05:47] recognize and honor respect the Prophet
[1:05:50] that God sent in this hour and in this
[1:05:53] age brother he had a ministry above and
[1:05:55] beyond any fivefold ministry oh yes then
[1:06:00] not only that but what he left is in the
[1:06:03] hands of the fifl ministry because he
[1:06:05] said when they asked him that question
[1:06:07] in the old me the seven seals and they
[1:06:10] said both around as though does the
[1:06:12] bride ever ministry and he says yes he
[1:06:14] said it's the fivefold ministry
[1:06:17] a man and he named them and he says
[1:06:19] every spinny spinny it's been here ever
[1:06:21] since he said the day of Pentecost a man
[1:06:24] from the day of Pentecost right on
[1:06:25] through to the last day God was
[1:06:27] depending on the fight for ministry to
[1:06:29] take the message he came through Peter
[1:06:30] amen and the faithful ministry went
[1:06:33] forth with it he made right on down
[1:06:35] through seven Church ages and now a day
[1:06:37] in this age for the ministry of the
[1:06:39] Prophet to the to the bride in the bride
[1:06:41] age he made there's a fight for ministry
[1:06:43] to the bride to exalt the minced of the
[1:06:45] message as her father said we're going
[1:06:48] from the Prophet ISA to the prophecy and
[1:06:50] we're going so from the messenger to the
[1:06:53] message and there is a ministry there
[1:06:56] there is a powerful ministry to exalt
[1:06:58] the prophecy amai there's a fifl
[1:07:02] ministry there to exalt the message a
[1:07:04] man what is it to get it to give us what
[1:07:07] it's ordained to do and it's ordained to
[1:07:09] give us rapturing faith the Provost said
[1:07:12] to fifl minister the the third pole of
[1:07:15] his ministry and the revealing of the
[1:07:18] word the only the seven seals the the
[1:07:21] mystery of God he said his rapturing
[1:07:23] faith a man we're without excuse we'll
[1:07:27] get more into it later on turn with me
[1:07:29] to well you can turn with me if you want
[1:07:31] to let's go to revelation 22 and then I
[1:07:42] want to turn it to our sister boat Ozzy
[1:07:50] to give us a testimony of her meeting
[1:07:53] with the Prophet to us we've been
[1:07:56] blessed hearing the Prophet to us we've
[1:07:59] been blessed reading about the Prophet
[1:08:01] we've been blessed just watching the
[1:08:03] Prophet may be our honor on a on a film
[1:08:05] and it's on and to hear those those
[1:08:09] things and see those things by the grace
[1:08:10] of God but brother what a blessing it
[1:08:13] was for our sister Petoskey here to have
[1:08:16] been in the presence of the Prophet a
[1:08:18] man to have talked with the Prophet the
[1:08:20] Prophet talked with her to have the
[1:08:22] Prophet discern the thoughts and intents
[1:08:23] of her heart a man and reveal of
[1:08:26] revealed things to her not only that a
[1:08:28] man therefore the problem to take take
[1:08:30] her hand in his a man praise the name of
[1:08:33] the Lord I was blessed when she when she
[1:08:36] was explaining that there last night and
[1:08:38] she was saying he took my hand and it
[1:08:40] was in his hand and she looked at his
[1:08:42] hand and she saw she saw the things but
[1:08:46] that the prophet of God was looking at
[1:08:47] but he knew what it meant he knew what
[1:08:50] he knew what it was revealed to him that
[1:08:52] she had this sickness or she had that
[1:08:54] sickness and so on praise the Lord but
[1:08:56] he said it was not to death the doctor
[1:08:58] he wanted to do surgery for overseas no
[1:09:00] way she went to the Prophet he did the
[1:09:03] surgery a man and just saying that she
[1:09:07] held his anniela Iran and she could see
[1:09:09] the spirit moving in the Prophet a man
[1:09:13] and the Prophet giving her thus saith
[1:09:16] the Lord
[1:09:16] there private a man which he moved way
[1:09:19] the problem went over where she was and
[1:09:21] talk to her again
[1:09:22] it may mazing thank God for her
[1:09:27] testimony a man it's a blessing to have
[1:09:31] somebody here that was with the Prophet
[1:09:33] bless you to have somebody here that
[1:09:36] talked with the Prophet anybody that
[1:09:38] that that experienced the ministry of
[1:09:41] the Prophet in the first and second pole
[1:09:43] a man thank God she's under the third
[1:09:47] pole a man but it's wonderful to be
[1:09:51] under the first and second but it's even
[1:09:53] greater to be under the third a man the
[1:09:56] others the others were just getting our
[1:09:58] attention they got more than her
[1:09:59] attention it healed her amen
[1:10:03] but then that brought her to the
[1:10:05] recognition of a prophet that God has
[1:10:08] sent a prophet and he was he was sent to
[1:10:11] her
[1:10:11] hey man but now no she's coming back
[1:10:15] she's she wants to get back to where the
[1:10:17] Prophet is as like a when our sister
[1:10:20] coffee passed away and we were in the in
[1:10:23] the wake there at that the funeral and
[1:10:25] our brother guy was there and he said
[1:10:29] all I said praise the Lord he said
[1:10:30] amazing brother journal he said this is
[1:10:32] wonderful just think he's the sister
[1:10:35] coffee she said is with the Prophet now
[1:10:36] she said he said he's feldsher or she's
[1:10:40] fella sitting with him in it in another
[1:10:42] dimension that's right I believe that
[1:10:44] because I believe that all those that
[1:10:46] were came under Luther's dirt
[1:10:48] fellowshiping with Luther all those that
[1:10:50] came under the Wesley they felt sorry
[1:10:51] Wesley all those they came under the
[1:10:53] Pentecostals and so under fellowshiping
[1:10:55] with the Pentecostals that started a
[1:10:57] hundred years ago
[1:10:58] amen that's right we're all going to get
[1:11:01] together with those when you hit when
[1:11:03] you we leave here and go into that
[1:11:05] dimension we believe in our sister I
[1:11:07] believe sister sadie is there and also
[1:11:10] our sister Dunford amen
[1:11:12] third and the budget but put this way do
[1:11:15] not do not all they don't have gray hair
[1:11:18] hey man I well sister Sadie did she
[1:11:22] didn't worry about it even though she
[1:11:23] was almost 99 years old when the Lord
[1:11:26] took her she said that's why yes but
[1:11:28] don't worry about it she said if I get
[1:11:30] to be a hundred she said I'll start with
[1:11:31] one again and I'll be one year old and
[1:11:34] so on so that's what that's what she
[1:11:36] believed but now she's just a young
[1:11:38] woman hey man she's their fellowshiping
[1:11:41] with with those Saints a man just same
[1:11:44] old brothers sister that I believe I
[1:11:46] believe oh yes she saw the word she
[1:11:48] believed it amen she came out of that
[1:11:50] out of that church that she was in and
[1:11:52] she you know and it's amazing I says
[1:11:55] amazing that she the first message she
[1:11:57] heard was marriage and divorce yeah now
[1:12:01] and I thought well surely you wouldn't
[1:12:03] play wouldn't let anybody hear that
[1:12:04] message for the first there might be the
[1:12:08] last one you hear you know but not the
[1:12:10] first but that was the only message
[1:12:12] first message rather she heard and it
[1:12:15] was sister Dunford the spirit of with
[1:12:16] her because she
[1:12:17] while she wanted to a message by twindom
[1:12:19] Bradham she heard it with him random
[1:12:21] because she when she was on any on the
[1:12:23] mainland there that they're doing well I
[1:12:26] was a long time ago but our sister back
[1:12:28] here might remember when that when that
[1:12:30] American politician was healed who was
[1:12:35] that Upshaw congressman Upshaw when he
[1:12:40] was healed well sister city was
[1:12:42] attending a certain Pentecostal Church
[1:12:44] in Ontario at the time and then the
[1:12:46] pastor got up and he was preaching you
[1:12:48] know signs and wonders and and then the
[1:12:50] power of God and knowing of God we need
[1:12:52] and he said always said I just heard he
[1:12:54] said he said that he said a congressman
[1:12:56] in the United State was healed and he
[1:12:58] said he went he went to one of william
[1:12:59] branham services to them when the
[1:13:01] Brenham was just an evangelist that's a
[1:13:04] that's all he was and he said I just
[1:13:05] just heard that he said he said he was
[1:13:07] in need our brother branham service and
[1:13:10] he said brother Bellamy suit was on his
[1:13:12] way out when he turned around and spoke
[1:13:13] to him and he said I told him that they
[1:13:15] that he does say the Lord he was healed
[1:13:17] a man and then he said and he was in a
[1:13:19] wheelchair and he said now and he is
[1:13:21] healed a man and so he guess what sister
[1:13:25] Sadie heard about wooden ramp above the
[1:13:28] healing that had happened in one of his
[1:13:30] meetings and then when she moved back to
[1:13:32] Newfoundland and she knew knew about
[1:13:34] sister Hubbard and myself and sister
[1:13:36] Betty and we knew knew that we just were
[1:13:38] nondenominational and she wanted to know
[1:13:40] what we believed and so on and her
[1:13:42] spirit was right her attitude was right
[1:13:44] it was real nice amen and so we told her
[1:13:47] and she wanted to hear a sermon by
[1:13:48] William Branham and since the dumper
[1:13:50] gave her a marriage and divorce well I
[1:13:54] tell you that brother that'll prove your
[1:13:56] faith a man that approve your election
[1:14:00] and she listened she heard the tape and
[1:14:03] she calls her stood up and on the phone
[1:14:05] and she told my dear she said sister
[1:14:07] Dunford that was wonderful she said that
[1:14:09] is absolutely the truth and she said I
[1:14:12] believe it a man and I caught a concert
[1:14:16] her to leave the leave the church she
[1:14:18] was in at the time and then to get more
[1:14:20] and more into the message of the hour
[1:14:21] and when of course we know that she
[1:14:23] eventually ended up in here and
[1:14:25] fellowship e with us in the in a seniors
[1:14:27] home and so on and eventually the Lord
[1:14:29] took her home
[1:14:30] a million so she she didn't matter to
[1:14:34] her window louvers little take her she
[1:14:36] was ready to go a man and just think
[1:14:39] she's with sister Dunford now and I
[1:14:40] believe she's with sister coffee a man
[1:14:43] and their fellows have been with the
[1:14:44] Saints of this age the bride aged by the
[1:14:47] grace of God waiting for the
[1:14:49] resurrection and rapture Darwin yawn you

[1:15:04] we got to come to that faith that will
[1:15:06] bring them from that dimension to this
[1:15:08] one and then he said we're going to go
[1:15:10] right into that dimension with them and
[1:15:12] he said we're going to be going to a
[1:15:14] glorified body instantly a man and then
[1:15:17] he said we're going to look up and in

[1:16:44] feet of the angel which showed me these
[1:16:46] things a man is there producing
[1:16:51] worshiping us a spirit of worship in us
[1:16:55] it produced a spirit of worship in John
[1:16:58] brother when when Jesus appeared to John
[1:17:01] John fell down is one dead before him
[1:17:03] Amen I pray God with them that the
[1:17:08] presence of our Lord Jesus Christ will

[1:18:04] the prophecy of this book for the time
[1:18:07] is that an amen for the revelation
[1:18:12] she'll not the sayings of the prophecy
[1:18:14] of this book for the time is that an
[1:18:17] what time as Christ told John in
[1:18:23] Revelation 10 he said in the days of the
[1:18:27] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:18:29] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:18:32] be finished as the earth declared to his
[1:18:35] servants the prophets amen

[1:18:57] revelation of the mystery of God do God
[1:18:59] be the glory amen
[1:19:01] our prophet in the beginning I was I
[1:19:03] don't have time to get into that a
[1:19:05] prophet in Genesis and a prophet in
[1:19:08] Revelation God used a prophet in the
[1:19:11] beginning with his word and God uses a
[1:19:15] prophet at the end with his word now
[1:19:18] into the Gentiles but to the Jews as
[1:19:21] well they're looking for a prophet oh
[1:19:23] yeah because remember our prophet was
[1:19:26] God went beyond the curtain of time and
[1:19:28] also in Israel within the last few years
[1:19:31] there's two or three that I've been
[1:19:33] young men that had been caught beyond
[1:19:35] the curtain of time in Israel yeah and
[1:19:39] it's even on the internet now somewhere
[1:19:41] where rabbis got got him to come one of
[1:19:44] them brought those young men together
[1:19:45] and and got him to explain everything
[1:19:47] that he saw what he experienced and so
[1:19:49] on beyond the curtain of time brother
[1:19:52] we'd better look up I don't know how
[1:19:57] much time we got left
[1:19:58] but the rapture is upon us please let
[1:20:04] let God by the word catch us up and
[1:20:07] catches into another dimension let's
[1:20:10] become more conscious of that to that
[1:20:11] dimension than this one by the if the
[1:20:14] more were more were in the world the
[1:20:16] more were listening to the word more
[1:20:18] we're hearing the word the more were
[1:20:19] we're reading the word the more
[1:20:22] conscious we're going to get of that
[1:20:23] dimension yeah more we focus on it as I
[1:20:27] said let me say it again are we got
[1:20:31] we're going to be like Jesus what do you
[1:20:34] mean when he was here in the Alpha
[1:20:37] ministry we're gonna be like Jesus in

[1:20:59] what's going on in this whole world nor
[1:21:01] I just leave it all with you I plead the
[1:21:03] token life of the blood of Jesus for
[1:21:05] this one for that one but Lord we're
[1:21:07] moving on to the resurrection we're
[1:21:08] moving on to the rapture brothers no no

[1:21:20] said how much longer shall I be with you
[1:21:21] with that with that world of unbelief
[1:21:24] and then he got to the place where he
[1:21:28] knew his ministry was changing and he
[1:21:31] said I am no more in the world he was on
[1:21:36] his way out his faith was taking control
[1:21:39] and leading him amen
[1:21:42] and he and he went to get cemani he went

[1:22:13] the Prophet told John right at the end
[1:22:17] of all things see or not the sayings of
[1:22:19] the prophecy of this book for the time
[1:22:21] is at an and notice the message that
[1:22:26] went forth praise the Lord and he said
[1:22:30] in verse 17 it revealed Christ as the
[1:22:33] Alpha the Omega
[1:22:34] they man Christ was revealed in this
[1:22:38] hour as the bridegroom and on down it

[1:22:59] and let him that err say come and let
[1:23:03] him that is athirst come and whosoever
[1:23:06] will let him take the water of life
[1:23:08] freely amen
[1:23:10] so the bride's redeemed a man but the
[1:23:13] message is going for by the grace of God
[1:23:17] so I prayed the grace of God be with us
[1:23:19] brother were called for a witness to the
[1:23:23] world

[1:23:29] last member of being and we'll just be a
[1:23:32] witness like here saying come per take
[1:23:34] of the word brother again we know the
[1:23:39] the revelation of wise virgins and
[1:23:42] foolish virgins as the prophet said I
[1:23:44] believe I mentioned it at the camp that
[1:23:48] the Provost said that the there's a
[1:23:51] foolish virgins he said they're saved
[1:23:52] but he said they got to go through the
[1:23:54] tribulation lay down their lives for the
[1:23:57] gospel amen
[1:23:58] so great grace to help us lay down our
[1:24:00] lives now spiritually so there we're
[1:24:04] going to be caught up in the rapture
[1:24:05] it's good it's it's right on our
[1:24:08] footsteps it's right right on our toes
[1:24:12] as it were by the grace of God the
[1:24:14] brother but the prophet of God knew it
[1:24:17] was late in his hour and in his day in
[1:24:19] his age how late is it for you and me
[1:24:22] over 50 years later well I guess says
[1:24:25] well over fifty years since our our
[1:24:27] sister er met with the Prophet was it in
[1:24:30] his own yeah it is amazing so we're
[1:24:36] going to let our sister come forward and
[1:24:38] give us a testimony about the experience
[1:24:41] that she had with the Prophet in his
[1:24:43] home this tremendous
[1:24:44] praise the Lord I I drove by us all I
[1:24:48] wasn't in his home and I would doubt
[1:24:51] very much if it was the same maybe same
[1:24:53] home but that a that his son Joseph
[1:24:55] lives in now so we drove by and I got
[1:24:59] pictures of it and so on
[1:25:00] and and I would say that when she was
[1:25:04] there brother banks Woods was next door
[1:25:06] and he's not there now his house is
[1:25:09] there but I don't think banks woods is
[1:25:12] there so and how of course when the May
[1:25:14] family was on the other side and her
[1:25:16] house is still there I don't know if any
[1:25:17] may family is there but I was still
[1:25:19] there yeah so thank God
[1:25:23] but brother the important thing is there
[1:25:25] is to believe what God revealed through
[1:25:28] the Prophet and what God is doing now
[1:25:31] through that ministry good thank God
[1:25:35] Lord bless you
[1:25:36] I went to this thing only believe again

[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:29:02] yeah
[1:31:38] he felt led to go down to Georgia but
[1:31:42] nevertheless he said he told him he had
[1:31:47] met this brother and he would like to
[1:31:49] help him and he said but you don't have
[1:31:52] to come you can stay here and I'll come
[1:31:56] up and back you know and she said oh no
[1:32:00] wherever you're going I'm going so they
[1:32:03] all went down there my husband was the
[1:32:07] oldest in his family and they were there
[1:32:09] for years of four years that my husband
[1:32:11] spent in high school and my husband was
[1:32:14] always sickly he had asthma his whole
[1:32:18] life and there was a doctor down there
[1:32:21] that had helped him considerably and so
[1:32:26] he my father he thought a lot of might
[1:32:31] the doctor thought a lot of my
[1:32:32] father-in-law because he he had a
[1:32:35] testimony of what he was doing trying to
[1:32:38] help poor people in Georgia I mean they
[1:32:41] they were poorer than most people in the
[1:32:44] United States you know but anyhow then
[1:32:53] he felt like his he was finished there
[1:32:56] in Georgia and he wasn't burdened like
[1:33:02] he was at the first with what he was
[1:33:05] doing so he wanted to go back to
[1:33:07] Illinois and the doctor offered to send
[1:33:11] my husband to college and pay for it and
[1:33:16] so he was supposed to stay with them and
[1:33:18] the family was supposed to go back to
[1:33:21] Chicago but after his family left him
[1:33:25] down there with the doctor he just he
[1:33:30] was concerned he was as a just a 18 year
[1:33:36] old or 19 year old you know he was
[1:33:39] concerned about the things of the Lord
[1:33:41] and he just he just after a few weeks he
[1:33:46] thought this is not this isn't gonna
[1:33:49] work I want to be where
[1:33:50] my family is so he came back to Chicago
[1:33:54] and that's when we met and so I had
[1:34:00] never we were both out of Italian
[1:34:03] impending castle churches but the church
[1:34:08] I went to they were very they didn't
[1:34:13] fellowship with anybody they had their
[1:34:18] own rules and regulations and so they
[1:34:22] they just didn't fellowship you know
[1:34:24] they didn't want you to go to anybody
[1:34:26] else's meeting because you might lose
[1:34:29] what you have I don't know how you do
[1:34:31] that but anyhow that was their concept
[1:34:35] was not fellowship him with anybody and
[1:34:39] so my father-in-law had just been there
[1:34:46] a few months you know back in in the
[1:34:49] Chicago area and he visited our church
[1:34:52] and Dave was with him and my father knew
[1:35:04] him because they had actually been these
[1:35:09] two Italian churches had been one church
[1:35:12] back when my in-laws and my my parents
[1:35:16] were young people but there had been a
[1:35:19] split and so they they never
[1:35:22] fellowshipped or anything else they'd
[1:35:24] cross the street to avoid each other and
[1:35:27] things you know they just really got out
[1:35:30] of order so any any way but my
[1:35:36] father-in-law was very like I say he was
[1:35:38] very opened and he knew that wasn't the
[1:35:41] right right way to be and so he came one
[1:35:47] one week during the weekly service and
[1:35:50] and my father didn't know that he had
[1:35:55] returned from Georgia so he had told him
[1:35:58] that night well we'll come and visit
[1:36:01] sometime so that's what we did we
[1:36:03] to their house one time and and we I
[1:36:10] started fellowshiping with the his
[1:36:13] sister and cousins and stuff that I
[1:36:17] really hadn't known up until that time
[1:36:20] and so one of we probably started dating
[1:36:31] in January and of 5055 and we we only we
[1:36:48] went to church that was our dates we
[1:36:51] went to church service what's that
[1:36:58] you know extravagant like maybe today's
[1:37:07] life is but anyhow that's what we did
[1:37:11] and so eventually he brother branham
[1:37:17] came to town brother metson bros a was
[1:37:19] always very kind to brother branham he
[1:37:22] really loved brother branham and if it
[1:37:24] wasn't for brother bows a brother
[1:37:27] branham wouldn't have been backed up by
[1:37:30] anybody else in the city of Chicago I'm
[1:37:32] sure and so that was real blessing that
[1:37:39] God sent brother beause a there and and
[1:37:43] later later on his church
[1:37:46] put him out they actually took a man
[1:37:53] with the power around implant and that
[1:37:59] was out of a college hero some kind of a
[1:38:03] Bible College but it was it was a shame
[1:38:09] but brother Matt symbols they was a very
[1:38:13] good friend of brother branham's he
[1:38:15] really loved him
[1:38:17] with all his heart you could you can
[1:38:20] hear it on the tapes but I can tell you
[1:38:23] that I saw that there was there weren't
[1:38:27] any other ministers that did what rather
[1:38:30] math symbols they did so he so the first
[1:38:38] time I went to one of brother branham's
[1:38:42] meetings it was at Lane tech high school
[1:38:46] and that was a boys school there and I
[1:38:51] mean the crowds they didn't have any
[1:38:56] manners in those days they were just
[1:39:00] interested in getting in there and
[1:39:01] getting at the front you know either
[1:39:05] you know they had they wanted to be
[1:39:07] healed or you know whatever reason they
[1:39:10] wanted to be in the front row and they'd
[1:39:13] actually then they opened the doors you
[1:39:16] could have gotten trampled I mean they
[1:39:19] just went in and ran down the aisles you
[1:39:22] know to get a sight a seat in the places
[1:39:26] so it was you know it would be packed
[1:39:30] packed out and lame Tech had a balcony
[1:39:33] and we always sat in the balcony when we
[1:39:35] we went and I had a couple of
[1:39:42] experiences just sitting in the meeting
[1:39:45] in that balcony at Ling tech you know
[1:39:48] night there was just like a cloud raised
[1:39:52] up off the people and it was just in the
[1:39:55] air it was up right up with us in the
[1:39:58] balcony it was just beautiful it was
[1:40:01] just it was such a spirit of the Lord
[1:40:04] there but you know the meetings
[1:40:07] themselves they were just wonderful I
[1:40:10] can't I don't even have words to express
[1:40:12] but I know that if you listen to the
[1:40:15] tape the Lord would reveal that to you
[1:40:17] how wonderful it was to hear brother
[1:40:20] Branham himself and so then we
[1:40:26] started to we got married and we started
[1:40:29] to go to Jeffersonville whenever we
[1:40:32] could but at that time we didn't have
[1:40:36] too much money not extra money to do
[1:40:40] things like that and so I sold my
[1:40:43] wedding rings so that we could go to
[1:40:47] Jeffersonville and and I never replaced
[1:40:52] him I have this nice ring on now which
[1:40:57] was my mother's my dad bought that for
[1:40:59] her when on their 30th anniversary but
[1:41:02] otherwise I've just had the band since
[1:41:05] that time I sold my my wedding rings to
[1:41:08] go to Jeffersonville but we we wanted to
[1:41:13] be in the in the meeting so bad and we
[1:41:16] had that we didn't have anything else we
[1:41:18] could sell and we had children wide
[1:41:22] array so we'd had to sell the children
[1:41:25] or something well he eventually I I had
[1:41:35] some female trouble and I had an
[1:41:38] operation and I mean it wasn't anything
[1:41:40] that was just you know gonna take my
[1:41:44] life but it was a nuisance and so I was
[1:41:52] operated on and after a few months I had
[1:41:55] the same condition back again and I went
[1:42:01] to the doctor and his solution was to
[1:42:03] operate again and I said no no we're not
[1:42:06] doing that I said I I I don't want to be
[1:42:09] operated on again I said it it you know
[1:42:14] we've done that and we have to come up
[1:42:17] with a better idea so he gave me some
[1:42:21] medication he gave me two medications
[1:42:24] that I never told my husband about
[1:42:26] because I was it involved me and being a
[1:42:31] female and I I just didn't talk about
[1:42:35] those things or we didn't talk talk
[1:42:38] about that
[1:42:40] so I was taking the medicine and then we
[1:42:45] happen to be able to go down to
[1:42:47] Jeffersonville so we went down there and
[1:42:52] Leo Mercer in Mo's that gene goad were
[1:43:01] in charge of setting up appointments you
[1:43:05] know for prayer with brother Branham er
[1:43:09] you know whatever was necessary and they
[1:43:13] took care of the tapes mailing them out
[1:43:16] and people who bought things and stuff
[1:43:18] you went through them and so Leo said
[1:43:25] would you like brother branham to pray
[1:43:28] for you you know Dave told him that I
[1:43:29] had this female problem and he said
[1:43:32] would you like brother branham to pray
[1:43:33] for you and he I said yeah that would be
[1:43:36] wonderful if he would so he called over
[1:43:41] there and asked if we could come over to
[1:43:45] brother branham's house and so they gave
[1:43:47] him a time for us to be there and there
[1:43:50] was also a brother that had come his
[1:43:53] name is Gerald Chauncey lives in
[1:43:55] Flagstaff Arizona
[1:43:57] now we never had met him he was just a
[1:44:01] young man he was younger than than we
[1:44:04] were and we were young Gerald had come
[1:44:10] from British Columbia and he had come by
[1:44:16] train and then I think he came to
[1:44:19] Chicago and then actually got on a bus
[1:44:21] and went to Jeffersonville anyhow he was
[1:44:25] there at the same time and he had come
[1:44:27] all that way for brother Brown if he was
[1:44:31] able to he wanted brother Branham to
[1:44:33] pray that he would receive the Holy
[1:44:35] Ghost just the just a young brother but
[1:44:40] a very lovely person and so brother
[1:44:46] Branham said we could come over to the
[1:44:48] den room so we went over there and
[1:44:53] they welcomed us into the done room and
[1:44:57] but brother branham didn't come in then
[1:45:00] I I don't I forget even how we we went
[1:45:05] into the done room I don't know if it
[1:45:07] was opened because we were coming and we
[1:45:11] walked in or I don't if somebody opened
[1:45:14] the door for us I don't remember that
[1:45:16] but anyhow we went in and we sat down
[1:45:19] and there was um I don't know if you've
[1:45:25] ever seen the house in Jeffersonville
[1:45:27] it's still the same house that brother
[1:45:29] Joseph lives in but it doesn't look the
[1:45:33] same you know they've redone it through
[1:45:35] the years and so it doesn't look the
[1:45:37] same anymore but there was an entrance
[1:45:40] I'm sorry an entrance into the this
[1:45:46] small den room that he had there added
[1:45:50] on to the house and so there was a
[1:45:54] little sofa at one end of it and Dave
[1:45:57] and I sat there and the other brothers
[1:45:59] just stood up brother Gerald and brother
[1:46:02] Leo Mercer they they were just standing
[1:46:05] up and then the door to come in from the
[1:46:08] house was over there and if you ever
[1:46:12] come to Tucson they have that same chair
[1:46:21] brother branham satin as in the den room
[1:46:23] now as he used to study in that chair so
[1:46:29] finally brother Branham came in and and
[1:46:34] sat down in that chair and he just you
[1:46:38] know kind of talked like he does on
[1:46:40] tapes to people to contact their spirit
[1:46:44] or see what the Lord is got in mind and
[1:46:50] so he sat in this chair and he asked us
[1:46:54] you know like where we were from and
[1:46:56] different things and you know where do
[1:47:00] you live and stuff like that he talked
[1:47:03] to brother Gerald and asked him some
[1:47:05] questions
[1:47:06] so then he got up from his seat in the
[1:47:10] corner there and the little sofa that my
[1:47:14] husband and I were sitting on had a
[1:47:17] coffee table in front of it and so he
[1:47:19] came and sat on the coffee table and we
[1:47:23] were knees to knees with brother branham
[1:47:26] and so then he asked you know what what
[1:47:32] the problem was and I told him I had
[1:47:34] this female trouble and I had been
[1:47:36] operated on and it was back again and
[1:47:38] the doctor wanted to operate again and I
[1:47:41] had refused to be operated on again I
[1:47:45] didn't want to do that
[1:47:46] so he said okay and then he
[1:47:53] yes brother Gerald you know why he had
[1:47:56] come and he said he wanted to receive
[1:47:58] the Holy Ghost and he said all right he
[1:48:02] said well let's all stand in a circle
[1:48:04] so we all stood in a circle and he began
[1:48:09] he talked to us for a very long time
[1:48:11] just on everything that we need we did
[1:48:16] we should do in the name of the Lord
[1:48:18] Jesus Christ he said there's no other
[1:48:21] name the Bible says there's no other
[1:48:24] name and he said that that was very very
[1:48:29] important when we prayed to do
[1:48:32] everything in in Jesus name and so when
[1:48:38] when he started - oh and he my memory is
[1:48:46] not as good as it used to be
[1:48:51] well anyhow he asked us if we had ever
[1:48:55] seen how the hand ministry worked cuz
[1:48:58] for a time in the campaigns he would use
[1:49:02] the hand ministry and it was this part
[1:49:04] of his hand that got spots on it and he
[1:49:11] told us that while he was talking to me
[1:49:16] he told me he said
[1:49:19] took my hand in his hand and it was just
[1:49:23] like white spots and they just would
[1:49:26] like fade and come back and fade and
[1:49:29] come back and he said this isn't
[1:49:33] something that will take your work your
[1:49:35] life sister like it wasn't as bad as
[1:49:39] maybe I was thinking it was and he said
[1:49:43] in in the prayer lines like the worse
[1:49:47] the sickness the worst the spots were
[1:49:49] till like he said if it was a cancer
[1:49:52] that would get like leprosy this part of
[1:49:57] this part of his hand and he did that in
[1:50:01] some of the early meetings that's how he
[1:50:04] discerned after some time and then I I
[1:50:10] would just guess like seeing mine was a
[1:50:13] private interview that he probably did
[1:50:15] that for other people too that that that
[1:50:20] showed him what the disease was so he he
[1:50:27] asked my husband if he had something he
[1:50:31] wanted to be prayed for and he he said
[1:50:34] you know I thought he was maybe sick
[1:50:36] also or something he said well I have
[1:50:38] asthma brother branham and he said uh
[1:50:42] that's just the devil and I and I know
[1:50:48] he told other people that too one had
[1:50:50] one of my friends had a very sick child
[1:50:53] that had asthma and he told the mother
[1:50:57] the same thing that the mother was my
[1:51:00] friend and she said that's what brother
[1:51:04] branham told me she said I was sitting
[1:51:07] in the car with them because he was so
[1:51:09] sick and the dad had gone in to be
[1:51:15] prayed for or something and she sat with
[1:51:18] the boy and because they didn't want to
[1:51:20] disturb anything but then brother
[1:51:22] Branham came out to her in the car and
[1:51:25] greeted her you know he must have said
[1:51:28] my wife is out in the car with the with
[1:51:31] the boy
[1:51:32] and he prayed for the little boy but he
[1:51:35] told her the same thing that's just the
[1:51:37] devil it's all sickness anyhow yeah he
[1:51:58] when he took my husband's hand it didn't
[1:52:01] show any any illness like that asthma
[1:52:05] and stuff didn't show up on his head and
[1:52:09] I mean he had serious problems with
[1:52:13] asthma because when we were first
[1:52:15] married I I am an only child and I I
[1:52:21] just didn't know anything I was always
[1:52:24] with my mom and dad wherever they went I
[1:52:26] went and and I just didn't have any very
[1:52:32] much knowledge of anything and his first
[1:52:41] asthma attack Dave had asthma from the
[1:52:44] time he was born and the first asthma
[1:52:48] attack he had we had this little
[1:52:51] basement apartment and I was running all
[1:52:54] over the house I didn't know what to do
[1:52:55] you know I'll get a pillow get a blanket
[1:52:58] raise your feet you know I mean I just
[1:53:02] didn't know what to do for the poor man
[1:53:03] and finally I was so frustrated I said
[1:53:07] is the only thing wrong is that you
[1:53:09] can't breathe and he he got so mad at me
[1:53:16] the adrenaline was running you know he
[1:53:19] was so angry with me
[1:53:21] he said yes I can't breathe he got over
[1:53:26] it
[1:53:28] so I did help them come back to the done
[1:53:39] room brother branham said that he was
[1:53:43] going to have a Oh David he asked Dave
[1:53:48] if he had something he wanted him to
[1:53:50] pray for and Dave had this job in an
[1:53:54] office Dave thought office help was the
[1:53:58] worst possible job you could have he
[1:54:02] said they have too much time on their
[1:54:03] hands and they they just are nasty
[1:54:09] thinkers you know they just think evil
[1:54:12] all the time and they actually had a
[1:54:16] thing in this office in brother branham
[1:54:19] talks about it on on tape cuz Dave
[1:54:22] didn't Dave told him what they did on
[1:54:24] the weekend they threw all the keys on
[1:54:27] the table brother Branham says this on
[1:54:29] tape they throw the keys on the table
[1:54:31] and they pick up a set of keys and go
[1:54:33] home with that woman or man other than
[1:54:37] their husband or wife you know they
[1:54:40] would do that well they knew that
[1:54:42] aggravated Dave you know but they you
[1:54:46] know once they know a little something
[1:54:49] about you you know they just make life
[1:54:52] miserable you know any time they can so
[1:54:56] he told brother branham he didn't tell
[1:54:58] brother branham what they did he just
[1:55:02] said I don't like my job because they're
[1:55:06] very filthy minded and he said I i'd
[1:55:10] like you to pray that I'll get a new job
[1:55:14] so when brother branham prayed for all
[1:55:20] of us he didn't pray that Dave would get
[1:55:24] a new job he prayed that he'd be
[1:55:27] satisfied until the Lord had something
[1:55:30] for him
[1:55:32] and he never did leave that job til we
[1:55:36] left Illinois yeah but he said he was
[1:55:40] able to go there and do his work and it
[1:55:43] wasn't not the same like it was before
[1:55:46] you know what he said it was like
[1:55:47] torment it's going to his job you know
[1:55:50] so then he he told told me that it you
[1:55:58] know that I would be all right and he
[1:56:01] told brother Gerald that he'd received
[1:56:04] the Holy Ghost before he went home but
[1:56:07] back to Canada so then the brothers were
[1:56:12] talking and thing okay what forget oh
[1:56:24] yes he had to talk to us for a long time
[1:56:27] like I said about doing everything in
[1:56:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so
[1:56:34] when he prayed he prayed in the name of
[1:56:38] the Father Son Holy Ghost in the name of
[1:56:40] the holy roman church and you know he he
[1:56:44] mentioned so many things you he could
[1:56:46] just click things off real fast and then
[1:56:52] he finally he said in the name of the
[1:56:55] lord jesus christ and that he had my
[1:56:58] hand and he said you all watch my hand
[1:57:01] so he had my hand and has in that's
[1:57:04] still where all these little spots are
[1:57:06] going around and even when he said in
[1:57:09] the name of the lord jesus christ that
[1:57:10] stopped that's completely stopped you
[1:57:17] know so he told brother Gerald he'd
[1:57:20] received the Holy Ghost before he left
[1:57:22] Jeffersonville to go home and so then
[1:57:26] the brothers were talking and I was the
[1:57:28] only woman in the room so I felt kind of
[1:57:30] I didn't know what to do with myself so
[1:57:33] I went by the door and I stood there and
[1:57:36] the brothers were still talking and
[1:57:38] brother branham was talking to them and
[1:57:42] then he left and he came to me at the
[1:57:45] door he
[1:57:46] said now sister the Lord has healed you
[1:57:49] he said he told me exactly the medicines
[1:57:55] I was taking and I hadn't even showed
[1:57:58] them to my husband because they were
[1:58:02] just personal it was a female problem
[1:58:05] and it was kind of personal and I was
[1:58:07] embarrassed even to talk to him about
[1:58:09] what the doctor had given me and so I I
[1:58:13] just hadn't even told him so nobody in
[1:58:15] the room knew but me what the medicine
[1:58:18] was he told me exactly what the medicine
[1:58:21] was and so but for a long long long time
[1:58:27] it never dawned on me that he treated me
[1:58:32] just like he did the people in the
[1:58:34] prayer line because he he told me
[1:58:39] exactly what was going on and nobody
[1:58:45] else knew that nobody in the in the room
[1:58:48] and he said you can take the medicine or
[1:58:52] not take the medicine but the Lord has
[1:58:55] healed you so I didn't take the medicine
[1:58:59] I praise the Lord I don't need it so
[1:59:08] that was that was a wonderful thing no
[1:59:26] no no no I never had that issue again
[1:59:36] the Lord took that completely away yeah
[1:59:42] well then several years later then my
[1:59:48] mother-in-law started through met
[1:59:51] apposite and it was she started into
[1:59:56] menopause around the time of the
[1:59:59] church age meetings and we weren't able
[2:00:05] to go down at that time to the church
[2:00:07] age meetings but my mother-in-law and
[2:00:09] father-in-law had gone down and brother
[2:00:12] Branham prayed for her at that time but
[2:00:16] she just she just couldn't seem to get
[2:00:22] well you know even though brother
[2:00:24] Branham had we were glad brother Branham
[2:00:27] had prayed but she she said she when she
[2:00:32] did get well she said she knew when that
[2:00:35] thing that spirit came on her the
[2:00:38] neighbor man died of cancer and that
[2:00:43] spirit came on her and on her mind until
[2:00:47] she thought she had cancer I mean she
[2:00:50] was convinced she didn't care what the
[2:00:52] doctor said or anything you know and she
[2:00:55] had a small growth the doctor removed
[2:00:58] that it was not cancer and we did
[2:01:02] everything we could you know for her
[2:01:05] which then she just went into a terrible
[2:01:07] terrible depression and she couldn't
[2:01:16] take care of her family she I had a one
[2:01:21] of my sister-in-law's was only eight
[2:01:24] years old at the time
[2:01:25] this happened to my mother-in-law and
[2:01:28] she was a change of life baby and and
[2:01:33] she just she just got worse and worse
[2:01:36] and then my father-in-law he was you
[2:01:39] know he'd work all day and then mom
[2:01:41] would keep him up all night and it just
[2:01:44] was very difficult so my sister-in-law
[2:01:47] and I we would take turns taking mom and
[2:01:52] and trying to watch over and care for it
[2:01:59] because it it got pretty pretty bad
[2:02:02] sometimes but she just she just couldn't
[2:02:06] get over this well finally my
[2:02:08] father-in-law from all the stress had a
[2:02:10] heart attack
[2:02:12] and he was in the hospital and so my
[2:02:16] husband said he thought he'd take his
[2:02:19] mom back down to Jeffersonville and see
[2:02:22] if he could get an appointment and see
[2:02:24] brother branham so he took her down and
[2:02:28] and he got a an audience with brother
[2:02:35] Branham and he said brother Branham came
[2:02:40] in the room and he you know greeted them
[2:02:43] and you know I asked him where they were
[2:02:45] from and everything and and so they
[2:02:50] talked a little while you know and just
[2:02:52] about coming that they lived in Chicago
[2:02:56] and that he had meetings there you know
[2:02:59] and brother Branham was telling them
[2:03:01] different things and then he finally he
[2:03:04] said to my mother-in-law he said what
[2:03:07] seems to be your problem sister and she
[2:03:10] said the devil tells me that I'm not
[2:03:14] saved and don't have the Holy Ghost and
[2:03:18] he said why do you listen to him
[2:03:24] simple simple but says she had never
[2:03:29] been like that she was a very faithful
[2:03:32] believer in the Lord Jesus Christ you
[2:03:35] know that was just a trick of the devil
[2:03:37] that it tormented her mind I mean she
[2:03:41] was in torment if I could have a movie
[2:03:47] of how even just how she looked you'd
[2:03:49] know right away something bad wrong was
[2:03:51] her you know she had something bothering
[2:03:54] her but that was it she thought she had
[2:03:57] done something to lose their salvation
[2:03:59] and the Holy Ghost
[2:04:02] and so he told her to just go back home
[2:04:08] do what she didn't want to do you know
[2:04:11] take care of her little girl make
[2:04:14] suppers you know make breakfast bake a
[2:04:17] pie you know just do the normal things
[2:04:20] and he said if you if you don't know
[2:04:23] what to do he said just go out on your
[2:04:25] back
[2:04:26] yard and dig a hole and fill it up he
[2:04:30] said to keep busy that's one thing
[2:04:33] nervous people can't do they can't keep
[2:04:37] busy that you know the devil just runs
[2:04:40] them around until they're just they
[2:04:43] can't work it can't do anything and she
[2:04:47] was very capable she was and she was a
[2:04:50] fine Christian woman you know it's not
[2:04:53] like the reason you you're like this is
[2:04:58] because you know you've done the sand
[2:05:00] the sand uh she was she was a good
[2:05:02] Christian woman so anyhow she was she
[2:05:07] was sick for almost two years
[2:05:11] bad bad sick we had to just take her
[2:05:15] house to house and so okay right during
[2:05:25] that during that interview brother
[2:05:28] brother branham told her he got a piece
[2:05:33] of paper with a pencil he made a
[2:05:36] straight line and he said this is the
[2:05:40] road to eternal life and he said we all
[2:05:43] get on this road at a different time and
[2:05:48] he said whenever we're born into this
[2:05:52] world and received the Lord as our
[2:05:55] Savior we get on this road and he said
[2:05:57] once you get on this road you can't get
[2:06:00] off wonderful news it's wonderful news
[2:06:09] you know so when when my husband came
[2:06:13] home and told us what brother branham
[2:06:15] said oh we were the happiest people in
[2:06:19] the world we didn't care what mom did
[2:06:21] after that it was like this is over with
[2:06:25] you know we we had no doubt that it was
[2:06:28] gonna turn out right you know cuz he she
[2:06:32] had
[2:06:36] yes he told her that it was meta pause
[2:06:39] and then and that was a comfort to me
[2:06:43] also because I thought Oh menopause well
[2:06:46] you just go through menopause eventually
[2:06:48] matter pause ends you know so I thought
[2:06:52] well it's just something normal you know
[2:06:55] and and it'll be over with
[2:06:57] but it it took about two years and he
[2:07:01] told her that it would take eighteen
[2:07:03] months I think to 24 months I heard 20
[2:07:07] months to 24 months or something like
[2:07:09] that but it's on a tape on have you got
[2:07:13] it
[2:07:13] well when the Lord okay taxol he's they
[2:07:23] we all get on it at a different time
[2:07:25] when we're saved and he said once you
[2:07:29] get on this you can't get off then he
[2:07:34] put his hand over the line of the paper
[2:07:37] and the the line he'd drawn on it and it
[2:07:40] made a shadow over that line and he said
[2:07:45] you're just under a cloud in a storm he
[2:07:50] said but you're not off the line you're
[2:07:55] not off the line you know sometimes we
[2:07:58] just we get perplexed over a lot of
[2:08:01] things that maybe we have to go through
[2:08:03] temporarily or something but he said
[2:08:06] that you know it was just a cloud
[2:08:09] covering it didn't change our spiritual
[2:08:12] condition at all we're still so you're
[2:08:14] still saved and you still have the Holy
[2:08:16] Ghost but you get so nervous
[2:08:20] that you think you've lost that or
[2:08:23] something you know or the Lord took it
[2:08:25] away or something but he doesn't do
[2:08:28] those things he doesn't take that away
[2:08:31] yeah
[2:08:38] yes the there's two oddball tapes and
[2:08:41] the one he speaks about my mother-in-law
[2:08:44] is the one from Jeffersonville
[2:09:22] in all her life she was joining the
[2:09:24] curve she had no peace presidents ago
[2:09:27] teachers heard from her corset is a
[2:09:29] mental
[2:09:30] all of a sudden it returned with great
[2:09:34] she went
[2:09:45] oh yeah
[2:09:50] it was she was on her way at the time
[2:09:56] she was healed she was on her way to
[2:09:58] wedding in a car that he had taken a
[2:10:02] trip from Arizona they were going to a
[2:10:04] wedding in British Columbia and they
[2:10:09] were just riding in the car another
[2:10:10] couple and his wife were they were
[2:10:13] driving and my mother-in-law and
[2:10:15] father-in-law were sitting in the
[2:10:16] backseat and all of a sudden she turned
[2:10:21] to my father-in-law and she said Dave I
[2:10:24] have my right mind back she knew and
[2:10:29] that spirit left her she knew in that
[2:10:34] spirit left it just left and she felt
[2:10:40] and then when they got to the wedding oh
[2:10:42] my goodness she was they were staying in
[2:10:45] this house with friends and she was
[2:10:48] taking the sheets off the bed all the
[2:10:50] women were on like the first floor and
[2:10:52] all the brothers were staying down in
[2:10:53] the basement because they didn't have
[2:10:56] money really to take the trip but he be
[2:10:59] there for the sweaty so the these people
[2:11:02] offered their home and there wasn't
[2:11:04] enough room for everybody they just just
[2:11:06] slept on the floor and everything else
[2:11:08] but the brothers were in the basement I
[2:11:11] think and they were up on the first
[2:11:13] floor where the bedrooms were but she
[2:11:16] had everybody laughing and she was
[2:11:18] taking the sheets and making wedding
[2:11:20] gowns for everybody you know and just
[2:11:24] because she was so happy when that
[2:11:27] happened to her she knew when that left
[2:11:30] she knew then and I've heard other
[2:11:34] people talk about when they've had a
[2:11:36] mental thing that when that left the
[2:11:40] same thing happened they knew
[2:11:41] immediately that spirit left yeah okay
[2:11:48] did I forget something else
[2:11:55] okay he was wrong was that he was he was
[2:12:11] the groom at that time they were going
[2:12:13] to that wedding so any Oh sometimes you
[2:12:25] don't have too much wisdom
[2:12:27] anyhow I prefer living in a group in the
[2:12:31] Prescott and so brother branham had
[2:12:38] agreed to go hunting with the brothers
[2:12:41] well the leadership that we had at that
[2:12:44] time they decided that they were going
[2:12:47] to take the sisters and the brothers and
[2:12:50] you know they had two huge tents and all
[2:12:53] the women were in one tent and all the
[2:12:56] men were in the other tent and they had
[2:12:58] made a small tent for brother Billy and
[2:13:00] brother Joseph and so we were just
[2:13:05] thrilled to have him one-one actually
[2:13:07] when brother branham got there I think
[2:13:09] he was a little bit surprised there were
[2:13:11] so many people and that there were women
[2:13:14] there you know I mean it's it's a hunt
[2:13:17] and the women we weren't hunting we were
[2:13:19] the workers but anyhow in the morning I
[2:13:27] was you know trying to help get things
[2:13:31] ready you know for a breakfast and
[2:13:33] everything else and then we were just
[2:13:37] waiting on other things to happen before
[2:13:39] we could eat this breakfast and I was
[2:13:43] standing at the fire cuz brother branham
[2:13:45] had been walking around and I thought
[2:13:47] maybe I could talk to brother branham
[2:13:50] you know and but I didn't really know
[2:13:53] what to say to him you know I just was
[2:13:55] so thrilled that he was there so I said
[2:14:00] brother branham I said that
[2:14:03] tape on marriage and divorce I said that
[2:14:05] was a really hard tape on the women
[2:14:11] hoping he'd say something encouraging to
[2:14:14] me about how nice the women were he just
[2:14:19] looked at me and he said sister never
[2:14:24] forget that the woman is the weaker
[2:14:26] vessel so that straightened me out
[2:14:32] [Laughter]
[2:14:44] another time he was hunting with the
[2:14:49] folks that group in prescott that we
[2:14:51] were in we had gone to a hunting area
[2:14:56] that was very close to where we lived
[2:14:58] and brother branham came up to hunt with
[2:15:04] the brothers and the sisters brought out
[2:15:07] a very big dinner you know like
[2:15:11] Thanksgiving dinner to where we were
[2:15:14] hunting and brother branham couldn't get
[2:15:16] over it you know that it was all laid
[2:15:20] out on the table that I mean he had to
[2:15:22] eat on your lap but you know all the
[2:15:25] food they had and everything for him he
[2:15:27] was very nice about it and they wanted
[2:15:30] him to go first and they you know they
[2:15:33] finally they someone prayed and you know
[2:15:36] and I'll go first for the Branham and
[2:15:38] but do you know that he talked to
[2:15:42] different people and they started
[2:15:45] through the line and he ended up being
[2:15:48] the last person he never went to that
[2:15:51] table till everybody had gone through
[2:15:54] that line very humble very humble never
[2:16:02] thought he was never made you feel like
[2:16:06] I'm a very important person you know the
[2:16:10] Lord has sent me never never like that
[2:16:14] never like that he was a real servant
[2:16:21] true servant and so I'm the same hot
[2:16:36] tears too later they were getting ready
[2:16:41] to go out and uh another brother and
[2:16:46] sister that had been from Chicago too
[2:16:48] but they had moved out and they were
[2:16:50] part of this group the husband and wife
[2:16:53] were together and I was there and I was
[2:16:58] always kind of involved with the food
[2:17:02] what we were gonna eat and stuff like
[2:17:04] that and so I asked brother Branham if I
[2:17:08] could get him anything you know I said
[2:17:10] can I get something for you and he said
[2:17:15] no well I went got a glass of water and
[2:17:17] I asked you know I asked him if he'd
[2:17:20] like glass of water so he he took it
[2:17:23] from my hand and he said the Bible says
[2:17:26] that if you give a glass of water
[2:17:33] how does first go in the name of the
[2:17:37] Givaudan the water gives someone a drink
[2:17:43] that there's you receive a blessing from
[2:17:48] it I can't think of the scripture right
[2:17:51] now but it is a scripture that's you
[2:17:54] know if you give this drink and he's to
[2:18:00] the least of them and he said I'm the
[2:18:04] least when I handed him he quoted that
[2:18:09] scripture and said I'm I'm the least you
[2:18:14] know never never never
[2:18:20] just
[2:18:21] just like your brother I think it was
[2:18:25] your brother in the Lord and he just
[2:18:28] treated you everybody the same everybody
[2:18:34] the same and I'm sure he knew who was
[2:18:37] naughty and who was nice you know he
[2:18:41] just you know he knew people who are not
[2:18:45] right you know
[2:18:49] and he probably had a correct a lot of
[2:18:53] people whether they received it or not
[2:18:56] that's something else but you know like
[2:18:58] me trying to start this conversation
[2:19:00] with them you know about I was trying to
[2:19:05] get him to ease up on the women a little
[2:19:07] bit you know by asking them like he was
[2:19:12] so direct about the women and everything
[2:19:15] and I said that was kind of hard and he
[2:19:19] said he didn't back off at all I said
[2:19:23] remember they're the weaker vessel
[2:19:31] brother branham was always always the
[2:19:37] same he loved children I never saw him
[2:19:41] pass by a child that he didn't greet her
[2:19:46] you know just said look at this or
[2:19:52] something you know maybe their hair or
[2:19:54] their eyes or something you know yes
[2:20:01] when he came to visit us in this group
[2:20:05] that we were in in the we called it the
[2:20:07] park because we were in a trailer park
[2:20:09] and it was quite large and at the time
[2:20:12] we arrived there and in Prescott really
[2:20:17] families came in you know like maybe one
[2:20:20] at a time but this man had enlarged his
[2:20:24] trailer park and he had like two sides
[2:20:30] there was a little creek that ran
[2:20:32] through the thing and so
[2:20:35] one side of the creek was established
[2:20:37] and then he added this other across the
[2:20:41] creek he added this other section and
[2:20:43] all of us were in that had it on section
[2:20:47] so and we were free to have our services
[2:20:51] and things like that and so it worked
[2:20:54] out good and the children all got to be
[2:20:56] together there were some very nice
[2:20:58] things about it and then there were some
[2:21:01] things that shouldn't have been so
[2:21:04] eventually it it broke up the Lord the
[2:21:09] Lord has his time to do everything and
[2:21:13] so yes that time he came the one time he
[2:21:22] well he came more than once but the one
[2:21:25] time he came he went house-to-house and
[2:21:27] prayed with every family and their
[2:21:30] children you know to took us in a circle
[2:21:33] like when he was at our house he took us
[2:21:36] in a circle and prayed for all of us but
[2:21:44] I also say that it wasn't because we
[2:21:47] deserved it we needed help
[2:21:50] brother brother branham knew that you
[2:21:54] know we didn't know it but brother
[2:21:57] Branham knew that we needed we needed
[2:21:59] help and I really appreciate that and
[2:22:05] after that when that broke up we went
[2:22:08] through a lot of hardships in life but
[2:22:11] God was good it's always good he's good
[2:22:16] to us sleeping me okay my husband my
[2:22:28] husband had a job so that we could go to
[2:22:31] Jeff a little bit more often than we
[2:22:35] would have been able to he got himself a
[2:22:37] part-time job on Saturday working for
[2:22:40] Sears and so for a while he worked in
[2:22:45] them he worked at some
[2:22:48] action that you know there wasn't many
[2:22:50] people around and your salary did have
[2:22:52] to do with how much you've sold so he I
[2:22:59] mean it was better than no money but you
[2:23:01] know he wasn't satisfied well an opening
[2:23:03] came in the car department and car parts
[2:23:08] and tires and batteries and stuff like
[2:23:13] that so he asked if she could be
[2:23:15] transferred out there because that was a
[2:23:18] going thing all the time you know people
[2:23:20] were coming and going and buying
[2:23:22] expensive things you know battery was
[2:23:25] more expensive than what was sold in the
[2:23:28] department he was in and so he he'd
[2:23:32] worked there and we'd use that money to
[2:23:37] go to Jefferson and I'd pick him up 4:30
[2:23:42] on Saturday and when he got off and then
[2:23:46] we just start from the Sears store to go
[2:23:50] down to Jeff and we'd get there probably
[2:23:53] about midnight and and then we were
[2:23:56] there for Sunday morning service and
[2:23:57] then if we stayed for the night service
[2:24:01] we had to roll down the windows coming
[2:24:04] home and let that cold air and the car
[2:24:07] cuz we were so tired you know we hadn't
[2:24:09] had enough sleep you know you then you'd
[2:24:12] fellowship too much or I don't know if
[2:24:14] you can spell O ship too much but please
[2:24:18] you'd want to see everybody could see
[2:24:21] and talk to everybody you could talk to
[2:24:23] plus be in the services so we ride with
[2:24:27] the windows down going home because we
[2:24:29] and we'd get home about 5:00 in the
[2:24:32] morning and then he'd go to work Monday
[2:24:33] morning at 7:00 so that it was worth it
[2:24:44] yeah this is worth every every bit of it
[2:24:49] and I'm sorry that my memories are not
[2:24:52] like it used to be but I still can see
[2:24:58] those things in my mind you know it's
[2:25:00] just
[2:25:01] like I can't bring up little things that
[2:25:03] I've left out I think I've told it all
[2:25:05] but you pardon me but but that it was a
[2:25:11] wonderful wonderful thing I am so glad
[2:25:14] if I hadn't met my husband I probably
[2:25:17] well I'm God's child and he knew what I
[2:25:21] needed but I felt like I was doubly
[2:25:25] blessed by coming in contact with his
[2:25:28] family because they lit really loved the
[2:25:31] Lord and my mom and dad never did accept
[2:25:34] the message they weren't against it but
[2:25:36] they they didn't accept it he so it was
[2:25:40] you know I didn't have the fellowship
[2:25:43] with them that I had with my in-laws
[2:25:46] really very good people very good people
[2:25:53] and there's there's lots of wonderful
[2:25:57] people and the message that's it lots of
[2:26:02] things and although like all the things
[2:26:05] that all the believers that have been
[2:26:08] reached in in Africa
[2:26:11] I'm sure brother Branham is just all
[2:26:14] smiles with all the all the work that's
[2:26:20] been done over there because he had such
[2:26:22] a burden for the black people you know
[2:26:25] he he just you know they the ministers
[2:26:32] and everything in those days they just
[2:26:35] messed up everything you know where he
[2:26:37] couldn't even go where he wanted to go
[2:26:42] but the Lord found a way through the
[2:26:44] tapes and through missionaries and their
[2:26:49] own people testifying and that that's
[2:26:51] how it was meant to be and that's how it
[2:26:54] happened you know but brother Branham
[2:26:58] would have enjoyed that he would have
[2:27:00] liked to been been there and seen all of
[2:27:03] that I know he would have
[2:27:11] oh yeah that my husband while he was
[2:27:23] working for the Sears store he wanted to
[2:27:28] buy brother branham a gift and and my
[2:27:32] husband wasn't a hunter you know so he
[2:27:35] didn't know anything about hunting there
[2:27:37] or anything but he thought you know he
[2:27:44] knew they you would use a sleeping bag
[2:27:46] when he went hunting so he he bought
[2:27:50] this best sleeping bag they had and
[2:27:54] brought it down and gave it to brother
[2:27:59] branham as a gift and later on brother
[2:28:04] Billy Paul called I mean a long time not
[2:28:08] right away but you know like a couple
[2:28:10] years later brother Billy Paul called
[2:28:12] and wanted to know he said his dad
[2:28:14] bragged about it so much he wanted to
[2:28:17] know where Dave had bought it and and
[2:28:19] you know what all it was it was just
[2:28:22] from Sears Roebuck and it probably
[2:28:25] wasn't the best sleeping bag we could
[2:28:28] have gotten but you know we didn't know
[2:28:29] one sleeping bag from another but
[2:28:32] brother branham bragged on the bag like
[2:28:35] it was the best thing that had ever been
[2:28:38] made you know he just and I don't think
[2:28:43] brother Billy Paul could believe it came
[2:28:45] from Sears but he he brother brother
[2:29:01] Billy Paul told that to Grandpa Dave my
[2:29:05] father-in-law went down and they had a
[2:29:07] little interview some of the brothers
[2:29:10] from the group had gone down and when he
[2:29:13] found out that my father-in-law was
[2:29:15] there he says tell your son I pray for
[2:29:17] him every time I get in that bag we made
[2:29:22] it
[2:29:23] we made it yeah it was very very
[2:30:07] difficult and that's when we the group
[2:30:09] broke up and I he got sick in February I
[2:30:18] don't even know what year it was 75 ok
[2:30:27] 1975 he got sick in February and the
[2:30:31] first thing he did was he was on the way
[2:30:36] to Flagstaff from Prescott and all of a
[2:30:44] sudden like you just come into his his
[2:30:47] mind snapped or something and he thought
[2:30:52] he was Superman and could do anything
[2:30:55] with his car and he ended up running it
[2:30:58] off the road and nearly it nearly
[2:31:01] flipped and everything and then so then
[2:31:04] somebody who saw the like an accident
[2:31:08] happen happening they called the police
[2:31:11] and so the police were there right away
[2:31:15] he was all alone in the car now we
[2:31:18] didn't know this was going on we thought
[2:31:20] I thought he was going to Flagstaff to
[2:31:22] see about the work that we had up there
[2:31:24] which I think that really was what he
[2:31:27] was going for but somehow his mind
[2:31:29] snapped and so then when the police got
[2:31:33] there he's still in this condition and
[2:31:36] he thinks he
[2:31:37] and take that police gun and shoot him
[2:31:41] and then raise him from the dead
[2:31:43] oh yeah he just I mean it's just amazing
[2:31:50] what the enemy can do too you know but
[2:31:55] the Lord helped us in quite a few people
[2:32:02] from the group there about half went to
[2:32:05] New York City where yeah half of them
[2:32:12] they well they they went to fellowship
[2:32:16] with the people from New York City but
[2:32:19] they actually started out someplace in
[2:32:21] Indiana didn't they with another brother
[2:32:24] that had fellowship with the people in
[2:32:28] New York and then the other part of the
[2:32:31] people went to Flagstaff Arizona and and
[2:32:37] I didn't know what to do because he was
[2:32:42] sick he couldn't make decisions and I
[2:32:46] really didn't want to follow the leader
[2:32:49] and so I I did go to a Flagstaff meeting
[2:32:55] they had a little convention and we went
[2:32:57] up there we had returned from Illinois
[2:33:01] because he Dave I mean he he knew he had
[2:33:06] to work you know he said I've got to get
[2:33:08] back to work I've got to take care of my
[2:33:10] family I've you know but he he couldn't
[2:33:14] he was just wiped out and you know maybe
[2:33:20] doing bizarre things and so it just it
[2:33:25] was very difficult but anyhow I took him
[2:33:28] back home I in he got sick in this
[2:33:32] accident thing where he tried to was
[2:33:35] thinking about grey grabbing the gun and
[2:33:38] shooting the officer happened in
[2:33:41] February well by April I didn't know you
[2:33:45] know he wasn't any better and I didn't
[2:33:48] really know what to do so I thought
[2:33:51] I'll just go back my parents lived and
[2:33:54] we're from it originally from Chicago so
[2:33:57] I said I called my mom and dad and I
[2:34:00] said date you know Dave's been very sick
[2:34:02] I said okay if I come home with him and
[2:34:04] he said yeah that that was fine with
[2:34:06] them so we went and we left grandma the
[2:34:10] one who had been so sick she lived with
[2:34:14] us then my father-in-law had passed away
[2:34:16] and she lived with us and so she stayed
[2:34:20] and watched the children for us and we
[2:34:23] told her that when school's out for her
[2:34:26] to come she had quite a few relatives
[2:34:29] all of her her sisters and brothers
[2:34:31] lived in Chicago there and to come with
[2:34:38] school's out with the children and then
[2:34:41] she could have a visit with her family
[2:34:43] and we'd had the we'd be at my mom and
[2:34:46] dad's so that that's what we did we had
[2:34:50] a dog at that time and and this we
[2:34:55] didn't know what to do with this dog but
[2:34:57] we were so in love with it we thought we
[2:34:59] had to take it everywhere we went so the
[2:35:03] kids and Grandma came on the train and
[2:35:06] Paul our boy was about 15 16 years old I
[2:35:11] think was he he was 18 then okay anyhow
[2:35:23] he he took him to the vet and the vet
[2:35:27] gave him some medication and and the dog
[2:35:30] came by plane but grandma and the kids
[2:35:35] had come by train oh my that then that
[2:35:48] we were we were just there till July
[2:35:50] when they felt you know like he said we
[2:35:53] I have to get back to work I have to do
[2:35:56] something you know and he did he tried
[2:36:00] very hard sometimes he was successful
[2:36:03] and sometimes
[2:36:05] wasn't and so anyhow I went to they had
[2:36:11] a little convention up in Flagstaff and
[2:36:14] I went up there and I met brother Mark
[2:36:17] andhe and I met brother Perry Greene and
[2:36:24] they knew Dave had been very sick and
[2:36:28] they said you know they were willing to
[2:36:32] help us if we wanted to come to Tucson
[2:36:35] so then I took that as from the Lord and
[2:36:39] that's how we ended up in Tucson so I
[2:36:42] mean originally we came to Arizona just
[2:36:46] because we felt like brother branham was
[2:36:49] going to eventually be in Arizona and we
[2:36:52] thought maybe we could be some part of
[2:36:54] his ministry you know maybe help in
[2:37:00] meetings or something like that that
[2:37:02] didn't work out but you know the Lord
[2:37:04] the Lord was with us
[2:38:16] yes the Lord healed him it was took four
[2:38:20] years but if the Lord had healed him and
[2:38:23] he he healed them instantly
[2:38:26] my father was visiting at the time and
[2:38:30] Dave just came in from work he had
[2:38:33] gotten himself two jobs you know to kind
[2:38:38] of try to catch up on everything that
[2:38:40] was back slid you know from not being
[2:38:45] able to take care of it and my father
[2:38:51] was visiting at the time and he came in
[2:38:54] from his night job one morning and he he
[2:38:58] came through the back door I can still
[2:39:00] see him up at that door and my dad was
[2:39:03] sitting on a sofa UPS at the door he
[2:39:06] said dad I'm healed just he knew that
[2:39:13] lifted off of them it's it's just
[2:39:16] amazing if you see someone that is so so
[2:39:20] sick and so not not how they the Lord
[2:39:26] meant them to be or anything the Lord
[2:39:29] didn't mean for them to be that way it
[2:39:31] was just the enemy that did that and and
[2:39:35] then when that spirit left did the same
[2:39:39] person again you know they they loved
[2:39:42] the Lord I mean even when while they're
[2:39:44] sick they loved the Lord but they just
[2:39:47] can't operate because the enemy's got
[2:39:50] them derailed temporarily you know but
[2:39:54] he was so thrilled when that lifted off
[2:39:58] of him he just and many people there and
[2:40:03] to son at that time when when the Lord
[2:40:06] delivered him I said now I want you to
[2:40:09] meet my husband because they real
[2:40:11] I said you never really knew this man
[2:40:14] you know loved it when he was delivered
[2:40:17] I said you really didn't know him you'll
[2:40:22] see a different person thank you very
[2:40:34] much I never did this before I'm sorry
[2:40:36] I'm so slow
[2:40:43] [Applause]
[2:41:10] I like it
[2:41:14] brother Rams character when she gave him
[2:41:19] the water and as much you've done to the
[2:41:23] least of these my brethren you did it to
[2:41:25] me that's what Jesus said again just to
[2:41:30] remind you of a sermon that I preached a
[2:41:33] while ago concerning going to hell not
[2:41:37] because of what you did because of what
[2:41:39] you didn't do
[2:41:40] and Jesus said as much you've done it to
[2:41:44] the least of these you've done it to me
[2:41:46] then he said in as much you didn't do it
[2:41:48] to the least of these you didn't do it
[2:41:50] to me and he said depart from me into
[2:41:52] everlasting fire amen so they went to
[2:41:55] hell because not because of what they
[2:41:57] did because of what they didn't do they
[2:41:59] meant and our sister did do what Jesus
[2:42:03] said and the prophet of God acknowledged
[2:42:06] it that he was the least and she did as
[2:42:09] it were on to the least that she was
[2:42:11] thinking she were doing it to the to the
[2:42:13] best of the greatest but the problem of
[2:42:16] God considered himself to be the least
[2:42:17] and then as much you've done it to the
[2:42:19] least of these my brethren you've done
[2:42:21] it to me in his touch you did it to me
[2:42:23] to brother Branham he considered himself
[2:42:25] to be the least a man you did it onto
[2:42:28] the Lord but she highlighted brother
[2:42:31] Browns humility then he was a humble man
[2:42:34] yes he was and after he's going many
[2:42:40] many acknowledged William Branham to be
[2:42:44] a humble man but if they acknowledged
[2:42:47] him to be a very sincere man they knew
[2:42:49] that he was real he was sincere but he
[2:42:52] was humble he didn't boast he wasn't
[2:42:54] there to to present himself he was there
[2:42:57] to present the Lord he was there to I
[2:42:59] like to the Lord Jesus Christ but what
[2:43:04] struck me when she was talking about
[2:43:06] brother Browns humility was this message
[2:43:11] humble thyself it was a message the
[2:43:15] Prophet preached in 1963 a man
[2:43:19] highlighting humility
[2:43:22] he said if you'll read the little book
[2:43:24] of Jude you'll just learn a whole lot
[2:43:28] now what our brother Vale said I
[2:43:31] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[2:43:35] once delivered to the Saints
[2:43:37] he said they got away from it he said
[2:43:40] I'm a man of corrupt mind and so forth
[2:43:42] had come in and beguiled them away from
[2:43:46] the real things of God and he said God
[2:43:50] can only operate as we let him operate I
[2:43:55] can only do for us with us in US and
[2:43:58] through us what we allow him to do it's
[2:44:01] not what we think is what God thinks a
[2:44:04] man and he said if you want power he
[2:44:08] says see how humble you can get a man
[2:44:13] and he said just get away from all the
[2:44:16] worldly thinking and humble yourself
[2:44:19] before God Amen brother sister we are
[2:44:25] sinners saved by grace there's not one
[2:44:30] of us that would deserve it any more
[2:44:33] than others a man oh well I'm better
[2:44:36] than this one I'm better than that one
[2:44:38] no you're not in the eyes of god you're
[2:44:40] all sinners in the eyes of god you're
[2:44:43] all morning seeing shaped in iniquity
[2:44:46] come to the world speaking lies a man
[2:44:49] all in need of grace you know a
[2:44:52] brother's sister I pray God got helpless
[2:44:56] to see see ourselves as God sees us amen
[2:45:00] sinners saved by grace oh but we are
[2:45:03] righteous in Christ yeah but that's
[2:45:06] grace that he imputed to us the
[2:45:09] righteousness of Jesus amen
[2:45:13] issue and it's the result of your
[2:45:16] humility you humble yourself to that
[2:45:17] revelation by the grace of God he said
[2:45:21] see you commit yourself to Christ to
[2:45:24] humble yourself before him he said
[2:45:27] that's really power he said you show me
[2:45:31] a church that's humble real humble and
[2:45:34] he said not ever
[2:45:36] you see a church just a sweet humble
[2:45:39] church and I'll show you a church said
[2:45:41] as the favor and power of God in it
[2:45:43] that's right just the thing that it
[2:45:46] takes humility humbling ourselves before
[2:45:50] God and letting God just work through us
[2:45:53] don't have to make a lot of noise he
[2:45:57] said no he said above all things
[2:46:00] it's our individual souls that were
[2:46:03] responsible before God if you're going
[2:46:06] to heaven it isn't whether I go or egos
[2:46:09] it's you going and you first and you've
[2:46:12] got to look this out and come sweet
[2:46:14] before the Lord and I've always found
[2:46:18] out that the man that umbels himself is
[2:46:21] the man that God exalts and when you
[2:46:25] take a person with his chest out and
[2:46:27] knows everything and you can't tell him
[2:46:30] nothing he is arrogant well he said
[2:46:33] that's the person that never gets
[2:46:35] anywhere but you take that person that
[2:46:37] almost himself and walk sweetly that's
[2:46:41] the one that God takes he said I find a
[2:46:46] man to be a shepherd that has no
[2:46:47] reputation in all denomination that he
[2:46:50] said that's just good real good and
[2:46:53] genuine sweet humble brother that lives
[2:46:56] the life praise the Lord
[2:46:59] brother you might be able to talk to
[2:47:01] doctrine but what about lived the life
[2:47:04] that's right there are many that can
[2:47:06] talk it and are talking it the message
[2:47:08] but not living it brother what God is
[2:47:15] looking for is the life of the of the
[2:47:17] doctrine the life of the word a man is
[2:47:22] not not even you can get even quote the
[2:47:25] text a quote that the the the the the
[2:47:29] letter of it can you live the like the
[2:47:32] dynamics of it a man the probably gods
[2:47:35] that were putting too much emphasis on
[2:47:37] the mechanics and he said not enough on
[2:47:39] the dynamics that's the truth
[2:47:42] praise the name of the Lord if there's
[2:47:44] anything our sister witness in the
[2:47:46] Prophet she witnessed a man she
[2:47:50] witnessed the dynamics of the robbed the
[2:47:53] word a man everybody's living itself out
[2:47:56] through a man and he wasn't he wasn't
[2:47:59] exalting himself he was giving
[2:48:01] preeminence to the Lord to his word
[2:48:03] a man and to the sons and daughters of
[2:48:06] God and he considered himself to be the
[2:48:08] least of all he did he really did thank
[2:48:13] God and God was able to use that man to
[2:48:17] do what he did and I'll tell you it's
[2:48:21] going to take the same kind of a bride
[2:48:23] for God to use to bring the rapture to
[2:48:28] climax the rapture and the resurrection
[2:48:31] amen if we are anywhere right now
[2:48:34] we are at the climax of the resurrection
[2:48:37] and the rapture what else is there to
[2:48:41] come to pass what else are you looking
[2:48:43] for what else is there for God to do
[2:48:48] according to what God has done the only
[2:48:51] thing left is the resurrection and
[2:48:53] rapture is anything the prophet of God
[2:48:55] was looking for when God took him even
[2:48:57] when God took him from from the off the
[2:48:59] earth brother he was looking for the
[2:49:01] resurrection and the rapture he felt
[2:49:04] that that that was it was close
[2:49:07] well brother that was over fifty years
[2:49:09] ago so how close is it tonight grace to
[2:49:13] us grace that we're not going to miss it
[2:49:17] oh yeah they'll know about it there'll
[2:49:21] be a generation that knows about it but
[2:49:23] they're gonna miss it that's why the
[2:49:25] Bible says you're going to say where's
[2:49:27] the rapture still it already happened
[2:49:28] you didn't know it brother it's revealed
[2:49:32] to the right don't ignore it focus on it
[2:49:37] but your thoughts on it but your faith
[2:49:40] in it the resurrection to rapture rather
[2:49:43] I tell you if you're Brian if you're
[2:49:46] really bright ordained for the
[2:49:48] resurrection rapture I tell you you're
[2:49:50] you're hungry and thirsty for the
[2:49:52] fellowship of the saints who are going
[2:49:53] on
[2:49:55] and if you're not there's something
[2:49:59] lacking in our relationship with God the
[2:50:03] poverty God said when you get to that
[2:50:05] place
[2:50:06] it is not resurrection time not rapture
[2:50:09] time you get to that place where you're
[2:50:11] hungry in your thirst and you're longing
[2:50:12] for those that are gone on you said that
[2:50:14] means you're getting too close to the
[2:50:15] place where you're going to go you're
[2:50:18] gonna go and be with them because you're
[2:50:20] longing for it you're hungry important
[2:50:22] to 34th and the prophet of God was like
[2:50:24] that before God took it but the bride is
[2:50:26] going to be like it before the
[2:50:28] resurrection and the rapture yeah you're
[2:50:32] gonna be longing for the Saints that you
[2:50:35] had fellowship with and they're gone on
[2:50:37] well it's coming to the resurrection
[2:50:40] time the rapture time and the evidence
[2:50:42] of it in your life and in our lives is
[2:50:45] we all Lord we miss these brothers and
[2:50:50] sisters we want fellowship with them we
[2:50:52] want fellowship we want fellowship amen
[2:50:54] keep calling for keep honking for it to
[2:50:56] keep thirsting for it and to finally the
[2:51:00] rapture the resurrection of the rapture
[2:51:02] is going to climax amen almost longer
[2:51:08] how much longer if the bubble goes to
[2:51:11] the third Pole was the rapture rapturing
[2:51:12] faith to give us rapturing faith and
[2:51:14] much longer sit but the people are too
[2:51:17] much caught up with this world and
[2:51:19] they're not there not to that place
[2:51:21] where they were they're willing to let
[2:51:23] go of the natural things of life they're
[2:51:26] focusing too much on the natural things
[2:51:28] of life we are they're doing this doing
[2:51:33] this doing this focusing let's focus on
[2:51:35] of that brother-sister throw it aside
[2:51:38] let's focus on the rapture let's focus
[2:51:41] on the resurrection by the grace of God
[2:51:45] again the public God said they are
[2:51:48] waiting on us and God is waiting on us
[2:51:53] where we there's many waiting for God to
[2:51:55] do this waiting for God to do that God's
[2:51:58] waiting on you to do it why because he
[2:52:01] gave you the faith for it go do it the
[2:52:05] rapture
[2:52:06] so we can't blame God no sir god help us
[2:52:12] that we're gonna be believing for the
[2:52:15] change and he said humble brother that
[2:52:20] lives the life a man not he says some
[2:52:25] big know-it-alls coming in put in this
[2:52:28] order this be this way
[2:52:30] cutting things drag around he said he
[2:52:33] said I said it'll never work he said
[2:52:37] you've got it'll never work he said
[2:52:41] you've got to let go and he said see the
[2:52:45] main thing is love God humble yourself
[2:52:48] with it and he's you know I understand
[2:52:54] all the mysteries of God still though I
[2:52:57] could do it and have not charity I am
[2:53:00] nothing I ain't got nowhere to go yet
[2:53:04] the main thing is love God just think of
[2:53:08] that you can understand all the
[2:53:11] mysteries you can understand all the
[2:53:13] doctor you can that paid to do this and
[2:53:16] paid to do that but I don't have divine
[2:53:19] love you said it profits me nothing it's
[2:53:22] all being it's all being first
[2:53:25] Corinthians 13 why is it me because
[2:53:29] brother it's not it's not just knowing
[2:53:31] this and knowing this and knowing that
[2:53:33] it's loving God and wanting to get back
[2:53:35] with God and fellowship with God and
[2:53:39] worship God amen face to face
[2:53:43] so because why God is love o to a lot of
[2:53:51] people got his doctrine God is this God
[2:53:54] is that it becomes a God to the people
[2:53:56] that's right it is they because
[2:54:01] doctrines become idolatry oh yeah
[2:54:05] brother God did all of that everything
[2:54:09] revealed all of that to reveal his
[2:54:11] character so that we would love him for
[2:54:14] himself and we would want to be with him
[2:54:17] by the grace of God
[2:54:21] the main thing is love God and humble
[2:54:25] yourself surely after all these years on
[2:54:30] the field and around the world seeing
[2:54:33] different people I ought to know a
[2:54:35] little bit about the gate to enter in
[2:54:37] and if you want to get somewhere with
[2:54:39] God never let you an arrogant spirit
[2:54:42] ever come around you don't let malice
[2:54:46] come in no matter what anybody does if
[2:54:49] they're wrong
[2:54:50] don't you never build up a complex
[2:54:52] against that person
[2:54:54] he said you be sweet and kind to them
[2:54:58] remember God loved you when you were in
[2:55:01] sin and he said if the Spirit of God is
[2:55:04] in you you love the other person when
[2:55:06] he's wrong and just pray for them and
[2:55:09] love one another above everything love
[2:55:12] God and love one another and be humble
[2:55:15] with God and around one another God will
[2:55:18] bless it and it's hard telling what he
[2:55:22] will do usually when a church begins to
[2:55:25] get in numbers and get to getting a
[2:55:27] little bigger something like that they
[2:55:28] get away from the real real thing love
[2:55:32] you know they get into doctrine theology
