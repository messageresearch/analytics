[42:23] evening in your name we ask him amen
[42:26] amen God bless you if you'd open the
[42:28] scriptures to First Corinthians chapter
[42:29] 2
[42:31] First Corinthians 2 amen certainly
[42:33] welcome brother Dale Walsh Leger all the
[42:35] way from from Edmonton is he uh as he
[42:38] sold germs with us and just trusting
[42:40] that God will lead him and guide him but
[42:41] it's certainly good to see you and make
[42:43] it here safely especially without the
[42:45] aid of a GPS or a smartphone so it's
[42:48] good to see you
[42:49] um I did uh brother Paul and Sister Kim
[42:52] let me know they did land safely at
[42:53] around 606 this afternoon or this
[42:55] evening so they are home and I would
[42:57] imagine sleeping soundly in their beds
[43:00] right now
[43:00] had a quite a trip for sure but thankful
[43:03] that the Lord's brought them back then
[43:05] of course to have brother Mark back with
[43:06] us again and uh sister Lily as well in
[43:09] the back so uh I heard she she had a
[43:11] little episode as well so we're glad to
[43:12] have each one here and then just
[43:14] trusting that the Lord will speak this
[43:15] is uh this is Rush tonight I got the
[43:18] call at uh 3 28.
[43:20] 328 that I was preaching tonight and I
[43:22] had nothing I had nothing so uh here
[43:24] goes nothing
[43:26] the same goals amen First Corinthians 2
[43:28] verse 1 says and I Brethren when I came
[43:30] to you came not with Excellency of
[43:32] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[43:35] the testimony of God for I determined
[43:37] not to know anything above among you
[43:39] save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[43:43] and I was with you in weakness and in
[43:45] fear and in much trembling and my speech
[43:48] and my preaching was not with enticing
[43:51] words of man's Wisdom but in
[43:53] demonstration of the power of the spirit
[43:55] and of power that your faith should not
[43:58] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[44:00] power of God it says how be it we speak
[44:03] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[44:06] not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[44:08] princes of this world that come to not
[44:10] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[44:13] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[44:15] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[44:18] which none of the princes of this world
[44:20] knew for had they known it they would
[44:22] not have crucified the Lord of Glory
[44:25] but as it is written I Has Not Seen Nor
[44:27] Ear heard neither have entered into the
[44:30] heart of man the things which God hath
[44:31] prepared for them that love him
[44:34] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[44:36] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[44:38] things yea the Deep things of God Amen
[44:41] God bless you can have your seats this
[44:43] evening this is of course is the the
[44:45] first half of the chapter that we
[44:46] started with last service so I'm kind of
[44:48] working my way backwards here but we
[44:50] want to continue and Lord willing this
[44:52] is the final day the final service for
[44:55] this series so uh we'll see how the Lord
[44:58] would lead but this is all the notes
[44:59] I've got a it's all gone everything's
[45:01] off the pages so if it's not here then I
[45:03] don't have anything else so by God's
[45:05] grace this is probably going to be in it
[45:07] amen but we spoke last service and and
[45:09] remember we're thinking taking this
[45:10] thought of the word is a thought
[45:12] expressed and the overarching theme has
[45:14] been the speaking bride amen and so
[45:16] we're getting into that a little bit but
[45:18] I want to kind of drop into what we we
[45:20] talked about last time we spoke of a
[45:22] mature bride amen and this is what we're
[45:24] looking for in this age is that this is
[45:25] not a little school girl that's running
[45:27] around giggling and getting her
[45:28] Starbucks some pretty shoes and nice
[45:30] dresses and purses but this is a mature
[45:32] bride that's in a relationship with her
[45:34] bridegroom amen and we spoke how if you
[45:37] open the door to him then nobody else is
[45:39] supposed to come in after him and this
[45:40] is not a the the message is not a
[45:42] relationship with us and William Branham
[45:44] that William Branham has no place once
[45:46] we hear that voice when we open the door
[45:47] that only Christ comes in amen William
[45:49] Branham doesn't come in and Jonathan
[45:51] curlette doesn't come in or any Ministry
[45:53] or any any of the five-fold or anything
[45:55] like that it's you in Christ that are
[45:57] there Amen in the relationship that we
[45:58] have is with him directly we have no
[46:00] mediator between us and them amen so we
[46:03] we talked about that amen but I want to
[46:05] break it down a bit as we go into that
[46:07] idea of that relationship and that that
[46:09] Fellowship because we've been speaking
[46:10] in all of this about the expression of
[46:12] God Amen the manifestation of the word
[46:14] of God and and so much of this comes
[46:16] down to fellowship and it comes down to
[46:17] relationship and I want to just cover
[46:19] that a little bit here tonight so I want
[46:21] to first talk about the purpose of
[46:23] fellowship and relationship and we spoke
[46:25] last service about when it comes to
[46:27] Christ that that the new birth is a
[46:29] personal relationship
[46:31] right it's a personal relationship by
[46:34] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[46:36] you and in you amen remember that it was
[46:39] the outside the external of God what he
[46:41] is to us he's a savior he's a Healer
[46:43] he's a deliverer and and all of these
[46:45] great things but then there is the
[46:46] expression of Christ through you by the
[46:48] fruits of the spirit and by the
[46:49] manifestation of the word for your day
[46:51] that there are two expressions there's
[46:53] two Revelations of Christ it's to you
[46:55] and then it's through you amen and that
[46:57] relationship is the key to everything
[46:58] that relationship is the key to
[47:00] everything you'll ever face as a
[47:01] Believer you can sit here and you can
[47:03] have the correct doctrines and sit under
[47:04] great Ministries but without that
[47:06] relationship with Christ unless you open
[47:08] the door unless you open the door to
[47:10] your life and you let him come in then
[47:13] you will not see a Rapture because that
[47:15] is the overcomer's path is to let him in
[47:17] and come in and he'll stop with you and
[47:19] you'll stop with him amen amen then we
[47:21] we think about you know we look at
[47:23] brother Brandon perhaps as an Eliezer
[47:25] right and he went and he got the bride
[47:27] of Christ and then he got the bride
[47:29] Rebecca for Isaac and so he goes and he
[47:31] gets her and he says he's waiting for
[47:33] you and he's real and then they have the
[47:35] trip all the way back to where Isaac is
[47:37] and Eleazar is filling her head and
[47:39] filling her ears with all of these
[47:41] things that Isaac is and how great he is
[47:43] and how wonderful he is and and
[47:44] everybody loves him and if you think
[47:45] these gifts are great wait till you see
[47:47] what he's got waiting back at home and
[47:49] and he just can't wait to meet you and
[47:51] you're the one and all these different
[47:52] things but there came a time where she
[47:54] saw where she saw Isaac and she has to
[47:57] get off of her camel and she has to go
[47:59] into the tent with Isaac amen and after
[48:01] that we don't see Eleazar anymore why
[48:03] because he must decrease and the
[48:05] bridegroom must increase you had to step
[48:08] into the tent otherwise it was no good
[48:10] except in eleazar's message because the
[48:12] message was to take you into
[48:13] relationship amen it had to bring you to
[48:16] Isaac it had to bring you to Christ and
[48:19] so the purpose of this message is not
[48:21] just to get us on the camel but it's to
[48:22] get us off the camel and into the tent
[48:24] amen there is a tent Vision if you
[48:27] remember and they'd go into that tent
[48:28] they'd say they come out they go in with
[48:30] a leg missing or limb missing they come
[48:32] out and they'd say and it was all healed
[48:34] and they'd say what happened I don't
[48:36] know
[48:36] amen but something happened in there in
[48:39] his presence that changed them from the
[48:40] way they were to the way they needed to
[48:42] be amen and it's the same thing here you
[48:44] go into that intimate relationship and
[48:46] you'll come out a different person than
[48:47] you went in and you may not be able to
[48:49] explain all the Dynamics and the
[48:51] mechanics of it all you know is that you
[48:52] went in one way and you came out another
[48:54] way amen
[48:56] now this intimate relationship we're
[48:57] talking about remember it's got to be
[48:59] intimacy remember the scripture says in
[49:01] that day they'll come to him and say
[49:02] Lord Lord did we not do all of this in
[49:04] your name and he says yep but I never
[49:07] knew you there was never intimacy there
[49:10] was never a relationship there yes you
[49:12] did those things but there was never
[49:14] through me it was not through me working
[49:15] through you it was not a relationship
[49:17] that we developed and it didn't lead to
[49:19] anything that I called nothing that that
[49:21] I had in my word came forth out of that
[49:23] it was just your dead works that came
[49:24] out of it brother Brown would say this
[49:26] and the message fellowship with God
[49:27] through reconciliation he says wouldn't
[49:29] you love to have lived in that time when
[49:31] the Great Fellowship God had with Adam
[49:33] and Eve in the Garden of Eden to come
[49:35] down in the cool of the evening and talk
[49:37] with them and fellowship with them
[49:38] wouldn't that be marvelous he says we
[49:41] would all like to have that time he says
[49:43] now I Believe by God's word I can prove
[49:46] to you that we can come right back on
[49:48] them terms again with God tonight right
[49:51] straight back to that kind of Fellowship
[49:53] he says and in this meeting I thought of
[49:55] doing this us many people have watched
[49:58] my life in the healing campaigns how
[49:59] that the things would take place and the
[50:01] prophetic gifts and so forth he says I'd
[50:04] just like to tell you how that's done
[50:05] that's done through fellowship with
[50:08] Jesus Christ he says no other way no
[50:12] other plan no trick to it just simply
[50:14] plain Fellowship taking God at his word
[50:18] what he said was truth believing it that
[50:22] just settles it now watch what he says
[50:24] he says then talk to him
[50:27] then love him and thank him for it and
[50:31] that does it so he says it's the
[50:33] relationship it's the communion with
[50:35] Christ that settles all of the issues
[50:37] that we're facing in our life that
[50:38] brings you to the place where the very
[50:40] works of God come through you is because
[50:42] you come into an intimate relationship
[50:44] with him amen and he has to be a God
[50:46] that you know not the god of mom and not
[50:49] the god of dad and not the god of the
[50:51] pastor or grandma or whoever it might be
[50:53] or some great Christian or believer that
[50:55] you know but he has to be your God Amen
[50:58] you have to recognize him as the I am
[51:00] and it can't be through some other
[51:01] person or their relationship brother bam
[51:04] says did you notice God came down in the
[51:06] cool of the day the setting of The Sun
[51:08] there's something about when it starts
[51:10] to get night that people think of church
[51:12] and of God Christians you see the sun
[51:15] setting you realize your son is sitting
[51:18] he says and in the cool of the evening
[51:20] he would come down and commune with them
[51:22] and there he lost that Fellowship
[51:24] because sin would not let him do it and
[51:27] then he was made flesh and dwelt Among
[51:29] Us in order that he could come back
[51:31] again to man
[51:32] to live in man and restore a man to a
[51:36] state of communion with him again and
[51:38] give him back his god-given right so
[51:41] it's communion before it's god-given
[51:42] right amen it's got to be a restoration
[51:44] of communion a fellowship of
[51:46] relationship before everything else
[51:47] follows the first thing that he knocked
[51:49] down was what the ability to come into
[51:51] His presence we know that because the
[51:53] first thing he did as soon as he died
[51:54] was he tore the veil that was the
[51:56] restoration of access to fellowship with
[51:58] God he says that's what he did that's
[52:00] the purpose of the Holy Ghost to bring
[52:03] you into Fellowship
[52:05] he says it's the father again God the
[52:07] Father dwelling in you working out whose
[52:10] plans
[52:11] his plans
[52:13] to finish his Plan of Redemption working
[52:16] through you making you a co-worker with
[52:19] him giving you a place giving you a part
[52:23] for your Fallen lost brother and sister
[52:25] giving you his spirit and his love to go
[52:29] hunt the lost as he did in the garden of
[52:31] Edom Adam Where Art Thou that's what the
[52:35] Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman
[52:37] when it strikes into their heart and
[52:39] takes its Abode there's a thirst and a
[52:41] hungering for lost souls that's what's
[52:44] the matter he says with the meanings
[52:45] today there's not enough Spirit touching
[52:48] it to go for the souls of the Lost and
[52:50] the dying it's more to make a name or a
[52:53] church or a building or a denomination
[52:55] instead of a soul-winning program he
[52:59] says how pitiful amen look at us look at
[53:02] us look at the gifts we have look at the
[53:03] Ministries we have look at the doctrines
[53:05] you have he says no it's about winning
[53:07] Souls not about building up a great name
[53:09] for yourself he says God poured himself
[53:12] into Christ and Christ poured himself
[53:13] into the church therefore now watch at
[53:16] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[53:17] father and you're in me and I'm in you
[53:19] at that day you'll know it you'll know
[53:23] it
[53:24] it's not going to be a maybe you'll know
[53:27] it
[53:28] for it's the whole thing is one Plan of
[53:31] Redemption coming down that God coming
[53:33] back to live in and dwell with and
[53:36] commune to his people as he did at the
[53:39] beginning now then as soon as he gets
[53:42] his church in speaking conditions he
[53:45] gets his church to a place that he can
[53:47] flow himself through and love and
[53:50] persuade and fellowship he says then
[53:52] there will come in Eden
[53:54] he'll take his church back to where it
[53:56] left him back at an Eden again there
[53:59] where it fell that's where it made its
[54:01] first start or fall that's where it'll
[54:03] be taken right back with every clean
[54:06] state of redemption bringing them
[54:07] straight back to that place again so the
[54:10] prophet of God is pointing us to a place
[54:12] a time of season he says where the
[54:14] church is in a speaking condition
[54:17] now we want to do we want that that's
[54:19] third pole isn't it that's speak the
[54:21] word that's that's that's what we would
[54:23] maybe consider the epitome or the apex
[54:26] of the bride's Ministries where you have
[54:28] speak the word where you have third pole
[54:30] and that's been laid before us for for
[54:32] decades now
[54:33] and everybody wants to speak seek the
[54:36] word speak the word I'll say it and
[54:37] it'll happen I'll say and it'll happen
[54:38] that's what I'm looking for because that
[54:40] means that I'm right where I need to be
[54:41] and that means I've got rap stream Faith
[54:42] because that's the next step is we'll
[54:43] just speak our way out of here
[54:45] but brother Adam says when she gets in a
[54:47] speaking condition he says what does
[54:49] that look like he says where he can flow
[54:51] himself through and love and persuade
[54:56] and fellowship
[54:58] so we all want to flow himself through
[55:00] part but he says then that looks like
[55:01] love and persuasion and fellowship amen
[55:05] those things require us to be able to
[55:06] stand against opposition to love the
[55:08] unlovable to love when somebody's not
[55:11] loving back listen if you've got to
[55:12] persuade somebody that means that they
[55:14] don't agree with you and you've got to
[55:16] be able to stand there and take the
[55:17] reproach that comes with this message
[55:19] that comes with standing for the word
[55:21] and not get offended why because your
[55:23] soul is sealed to the day of your
[55:25] Redemption and all you care about now is
[55:27] their soul so you'll stay there and
[55:29] you'll do what you need to do and take
[55:31] what you need to take so that you can
[55:33] bring them to the place of a new birth
[55:34] because they are after what lost souls
[55:37] it's not about proving who you are it's
[55:39] about doing the work of the father so
[55:41] you're out for them you're not up for
[55:43] yourself you're not trying to prove who
[55:45] you are you're trying to prove to them
[55:46] who they are you're trying to get them
[55:47] to see that they're the same thing that
[55:49] you are and so you'll stay there and
[55:51] stay there and you'll take the abuse and
[55:52] you'll you'll you'll take these things
[55:54] because you're saying there's a soul in
[55:56] there that's worth far more than any
[55:58] anything else that I could get out of
[55:59] this amen that's ought to be our purpose
[56:02] here not to get this this check mark or
[56:04] this box or this metal that says I'm the
[56:06] best message believer but is your heart
[56:09] the same as his to go and find the lost
[56:12] Jesus said I think I didn't come to say
[56:14] the same I came to save the Lost he went
[56:16] for the sick and the dying and the herd
[56:18] and the offended and all these different
[56:19] ones amen
[56:21] Paul says in second Thessalonians he
[56:23] says wherefore also we pray also for you
[56:25] always for you that our God would count
[56:28] you worthy of this calling and fulfill
[56:31] all the good pleasure of his goodness
[56:33] and the work of Faith with power
[56:36] brother Brian would preached a message
[56:37] called our is your life worthy of the
[56:40] Gospel
[56:41] and there's a portion of that that says
[56:43] is your life clean is your life
[56:44] Sanctified are you committed to the
[56:46] things of God and then the second is is
[56:48] are you doing the worthy things that
[56:50] he's called you to do which is to seek
[56:52] for lost souls amen when your
[56:54] relationship is secure then you seek to
[56:56] bring others into the same relationship
[56:58] you are when you believe what you've got
[57:00] is what they need that's when you'll
[57:01] really be effective isn't it
[57:04] he says why that the name of our Lord
[57:06] Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and
[57:09] ye in him according to the grace of our
[57:12] God in the good and the Lord Jesus
[57:14] Christ amen
[57:16] so worthiness for the cause of Christ is
[57:18] not the Glamorous thing that people
[57:20] often think it is oh he's counting me
[57:22] worthy and these different things amen
[57:24] but you look at the scripture and the
[57:25] ones that were deemed most worthy had a
[57:27] lonely long road
[57:30] they may have started with a lot but by
[57:32] the time they finished it's usually just
[57:34] them maybe one or two faithful
[57:36] Companions and God and sometimes not
[57:38] even that sometimes it's just you and
[57:40] God Amen and we're blessed to have a
[57:42] church this size we're blessed to have
[57:43] Believers are like Precious Faith but
[57:45] guess what each one of us is called to
[57:47] erode and a purpose and what my life is
[57:49] may not be the same as brother Dales may
[57:51] not be the same as brother Bob's and
[57:53] there's going to come a place where
[57:54] their road is going to be so different
[57:55] than mine that I may not be able to help
[57:57] them
[57:58] and what are they going to have to rely
[58:00] on then they're going to have to rely on
[58:02] relationship with the one that placed
[58:04] them on that road in the first place to
[58:05] keep them going because I all I can do
[58:07] is Pat them on the back and say I'm
[58:09] praying for you brother I'm praying for
[58:11] your sister but this is your road and
[58:13] you've got to be confident that he's
[58:14] leading you and you've got to be able to
[58:16] walk the way that he's leading you
[58:17] right as long as you're in the word I'm
[58:19] going to support you
[58:21] but I can't do anything for you beyond
[58:23] what encourage you right be in
[58:26] Fellowship in that but I may not be able
[58:28] to empathize I may not be able to
[58:29] understand where you're at whether it's
[58:31] because you're a woman and I'm a man
[58:33] because we're at different places in
[58:34] life married unmarried black white
[58:36] yellow it doesn't matter we're all in
[58:38] such different places amen
[58:40] so the thing is you got to be you've got
[58:42] to be settled in that relationship
[58:44] you've got to be settled with him that
[58:46] he's the one that's with you that he's
[58:47] walking beside you all the way amen but
[58:50] when it gets lonely don't get worried
[58:52] because it's lonely because it's a
[58:54] lonely walk
[58:55] there's not many on the on the Highway
[58:56] of Holiness there's not many on the road
[58:58] to heaven today amen but you're
[59:00] surrounded by Believers don't pull away
[59:02] just because they don't understand
[59:03] because we can't understand everything
[59:05] we don't know what everybody's going
[59:07] through you know we I've had a bunch of
[59:09] co-workers in the last couple weeks lose
[59:10] their parents guess what I can't
[59:12] identify with that I can't identify with
[59:15] that so I can give my condolences and
[59:16] and let them know I'm praying for them
[59:18] and trusting that they'll find Comfort
[59:20] but I can only do so much because I
[59:22] haven't been in their shoes yet amen and
[59:24] so we we look at that and sometimes we
[59:26] say well we don't we aren't understood
[59:27] and people don't know where we're at
[59:28] that's okay we don't have to you have
[59:31] one who understands amen that can be
[59:33] touched by the feeling of our infirmity
[59:35] said knows what it's like to go through
[59:36] and walk the road alone imagine he's the
[59:39] one that we ought to be looking to
[59:41] Amen brother Brahm says listen I feel
[59:43] that any man that's born of the spirit
[59:45] of God that loves God and loves his word
[59:48] God has a purpose in there he says God
[59:50] had a purpose in turning Paul around did
[59:53] he not say I'm going to show in him his
[59:54] glory god had a purpose when he saved me
[59:57] and I am determined to do his will and
[1:00:00] not add to it or take away from it
[1:00:02] Revelations 22 19 said whosoever shall
[1:00:05] do it his part will be taken from the
[1:00:07] book of life he says I'm determined to
[1:00:10] never add one thing of my own opinion to
[1:00:12] that word I'm determined to read it just
[1:00:15] the way it is and ask God that I'll open
[1:00:17] in my heart and receive it not just take
[1:00:20] it and run with it but Lord open my
[1:00:22] heart to show me how this applies to me
[1:00:24] show me what I'm supposed to do with it
[1:00:26] he says and then what work it through me
[1:00:29] Lord that others might see may it become
[1:00:32] salty and something real that others
[1:00:35] might see because we sit here and we say
[1:00:37] well I said amen to the word and I
[1:00:39] believe it and I believe it he says no
[1:00:40] Lord make it something real in me make
[1:00:43] it salty that somebody else would desire
[1:00:45] what I have
[1:00:47] not because it's me but because it's the
[1:00:49] word in me being made real amen
[1:00:51] amen and so we see here in all of these
[1:00:53] things what's he doing is he's he's
[1:00:55] going to God and he's saying God bring
[1:00:57] your life out in mine right and we know
[1:01:01] that the purpose of relationship is to
[1:01:03] bring life
[1:01:04] that's the purpose of relationship we
[1:01:06] see the very first thing that God said
[1:01:07] to Adam he says he says what be fruitful
[1:01:10] and multiply relationship is supposed to
[1:01:12] bring life amen and so it often feels
[1:01:15] good and and satisfying and comforting
[1:01:17] in all those things when you're in a
[1:01:18] relationship but the ultimate purpose is
[1:01:20] that life comes forth out of that that
[1:01:22] the two would come together and that a
[1:01:24] life would come from it amen amen so you
[1:01:27] have two groups today you have the
[1:01:28] nominal world and then you have it and
[1:01:30] the nominal Christian world and then you
[1:01:31] have the real true bride of Christ and
[1:01:33] each one of those is in a relationship
[1:01:34] and each one of those is going to bring
[1:01:36] forth life
[1:01:37] imagine the satanic bride what's she
[1:01:39] going to bring forth
[1:01:40] Antichrist
[1:01:42] right because she's under what a spirit
[1:01:44] of antichrist she's in a relationship
[1:01:46] with Antichrist so Antichrist is what
[1:01:48] she's going to bring forth and so if the
[1:01:50] bride of Christ is in a relationship
[1:01:51] with Christ then she's going to bring
[1:01:53] forth what Christ the word amen so
[1:01:56] you've got two things going on brother
[1:01:57] Brandon puts it this way he says we find
[1:01:59] today that the modern Church of Modern
[1:02:01] World Church the modern world church and
[1:02:04] also that the spiritual church are both
[1:02:05] pregnanted to give birth to Sons one of
[1:02:08] them a denominational birth is going to
[1:02:10] give one of these days at the World
[1:02:11] Council of churches which are produced
[1:02:13] to the world the Antichrist through a
[1:02:15] denomination that's exactly the truth I
[1:02:18] may not live to see it I believe I will
[1:02:20] but you young people remember that you
[1:02:22] heard a minister say that that'll
[1:02:24] finally wind up and that is the mark of
[1:02:26] the beast when she forms that World
[1:02:28] Council of churches and she'll give
[1:02:30] birth to her son her son the Antichrist
[1:02:34] that's scary
[1:02:37] that you would go all your life to a
[1:02:39] church and and maybe in all sincerity
[1:02:42] believe everything that said over that
[1:02:44] pulpit and then when it all said and
[1:02:46] done an antichrist comes out of it
[1:02:48] we've got no place there that's for sure
[1:02:51] but don't let it be here either
[1:02:53] amen why because you're just gonna have
[1:02:55] what whatever Spirit you're under
[1:02:57] sitting in this church does not mean
[1:02:58] you're under the Same Spirit as I am
[1:03:01] or vice versa for that matter right
[1:03:04] it has to be in you not just on you
[1:03:07] he says the other is pregnated by the
[1:03:10] word of God and will bring forth the
[1:03:11] body
[1:03:13] catches will bring forth the body the
[1:03:15] finished body of Jesus Christ which is
[1:03:18] the bride he says the body of Christ
[1:03:20] isn't finished yet how many knows that a
[1:03:23] man and woman is one
[1:03:26] he says and Christ is one body the word
[1:03:28] the bride will have to be the rest of
[1:03:31] that body and the two together makes the
[1:03:34] one body again like Adam was at the
[1:03:36] beginning man his wife are one now she
[1:03:39] the true bride so sold out to him that
[1:03:42] she uses no mind of her own his mind of
[1:03:45] course is his will and his will is his
[1:03:47] word brother Adam he says the bride of
[1:03:49] Christ is not finished yet where did it
[1:03:51] start it started on the day of Pentecost
[1:03:53] amen when he came down and he put his
[1:03:55] own life his own Spirit into sinful
[1:03:58] human flesh
[1:03:59] he was starting the multi-member body
[1:04:01] right then Amen on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:03] and then after that what does he do he
[1:04:05] continues it through all the church ages
[1:04:06] and you say there's nobody with the Holy
[1:04:08] Ghost here yes there were all the way
[1:04:10] through he always had a bride
[1:04:13] never the fullness they fell away from
[1:04:15] the fullness and were coming back to the
[1:04:16] fullness but he always had a seed in
[1:04:18] there
[1:04:19] you can see there it is all the way
[1:04:21] through there was always somebody
[1:04:22] there's always there and what was it he
[1:04:24] was building up the bride but he says
[1:04:25] the bride's not done yet why because
[1:04:27] we're still here
[1:04:28] when it's done we'll be out of here but
[1:04:30] he says his bride is still being built
[1:04:32] up but he's talking about a Oneness and
[1:04:34] he takes it to of course a man and a
[1:04:37] woman a husband and a wife and he says
[1:04:38] how do you know when you've reached that
[1:04:40] Oneness he says when you are so sold out
[1:04:42] to him and you have no mind of your own
[1:04:45] now I said there's a couple Services ago
[1:04:47] and I mixed up the couples when I did it
[1:04:49] so we're gonna try it again just to
[1:04:51] remind those that weren't here but we
[1:04:52] know that when you get to a certain
[1:04:55] level in your marriage chances are you
[1:04:57] kind of know what the other person's
[1:04:58] thinking without them even saying a word
[1:05:01] and if you come across a certain
[1:05:02] situation or something's going on you
[1:05:04] don't even need to talk to each other do
[1:05:06] you you know what the other person's
[1:05:07] thinking and so you're able to react
[1:05:09] together and move together and there's
[1:05:10] no big surprises
[1:05:12] so sister Brenda knows what's going on
[1:05:15] in brother Bob's head even without him
[1:05:18] having to say anything why because she's
[1:05:20] been in relationship with him for 90
[1:05:22] years
[1:05:27] she's been in a relationship with a long
[1:05:28] time
[1:05:30] longer for one of you probably
[1:05:33] and that's why she doesn't need to talk
[1:05:35] to him all the time doesn't mean she
[1:05:36] doesn't whether he wants to or not I'm
[1:05:38] sure she talks to him right but she has
[1:05:41] come to the place where she doesn't have
[1:05:43] to go talk to him about everything and
[1:05:45] guess what she has access to the check
[1:05:47] checking book she has access to the
[1:05:49] checking account she has access to the
[1:05:51] credit cards she has access to the title
[1:05:53] deed of the home
[1:05:55] she has access to his power tools she
[1:05:57] has access to everything that is his
[1:05:59] maybe with one or two exceptions why
[1:06:02] because she's in such close relationship
[1:06:04] with him that she knows what he has and
[1:06:07] what he does done with it
[1:06:09] and he's and what is it she doesn't have
[1:06:11] now a mind of her own when it comes to
[1:06:13] that relationship I'm lifting you up
[1:06:15] very high here today sister Brenda
[1:06:17] right she knows what he wants done with
[1:06:20] it and so she has access to that anytime
[1:06:22] she needs it and that's what he's saying
[1:06:24] is when she is sold out when the bride
[1:06:26] is so sold out that she's not using her
[1:06:28] mind she's not coming up with these
[1:06:30] great ideas but any ideas she comes with
[1:06:32] up with are through the filter of what
[1:06:34] her husband wants and it's within that
[1:06:36] framework and within that vision and
[1:06:38] within that dream that he has and so
[1:06:39] that's what she's doing and he's saying
[1:06:41] the same thing has to happen with the
[1:06:42] bride where you're not coming up with
[1:06:44] hey Lord I got a great program for you
[1:06:46] hey I got a great idea about how we
[1:06:48] could no no no now you're walking
[1:06:49] through him and he's saying here's what
[1:06:51] I want you to go here's where you go
[1:06:53] here's who you talk to here's where you
[1:06:55] get your job here's where your church is
[1:06:57] here's where your pastor is here's what
[1:06:58] your purpose is in life and you're going
[1:07:00] to stay right there and you'll have the
[1:07:02] greatest effect than if you came to me
[1:07:03] with all these great ideas of yours
[1:07:05] he'll place you where you need to be and
[1:07:06] then he'll let you work from there in
[1:07:08] his purpose amen
[1:07:10] we speak of the husbands being the head
[1:07:11] of the marriage and I think so often
[1:07:13] what happens is we treat the husbands
[1:07:15] like CEOs and the wives like secretaries
[1:07:18] but that's not what brother Brown's
[1:07:20] pointing to here and it's not what the
[1:07:21] word of God points to when it comes to a
[1:07:23] marriage right because he says what they
[1:07:25] are one they are one so he says Christ
[1:07:28] is the head and we are the body
[1:07:31] so Christ is the intelligence he's the
[1:07:34] influence he's the one that tells the
[1:07:35] body what to do and then the bride the
[1:07:37] body does it but yet they are not a
[1:07:40] disparate group they're they're not
[1:07:43] split apart it is just two rolls of the
[1:07:45] exact same body and they are equal in
[1:07:48] that we're coheirs with Christ he says
[1:07:49] but his role is to lead and ours is to
[1:07:53] do it's his to give the idea and it's us
[1:07:55] for us to follow through right so it's
[1:07:58] not it's not you know one's high and
[1:07:59] one's low it's just two different roles
[1:08:01] and the thing is in the world we value
[1:08:03] the CEO more than we value the Doer
[1:08:06] but that doesn't mean that one is higher
[1:08:08] than the other the simple fact is his
[1:08:10] role is to be the head and ours is to be
[1:08:11] everything else
[1:08:13] amen it's an expression of the roles
[1:08:15] amen but it's not an inequality of
[1:08:17] persons it's just that he's got the mind
[1:08:18] he's got the right mind and guess what
[1:08:20] we're his hands and feet
[1:08:22] and we've got to be happy with that
[1:08:24] we've got to be satisfied with it
[1:08:25] because he's put us where we can be most
[1:08:27] effective because if we were the mind
[1:08:28] what would we do we'd end up right where
[1:08:30] we are today that's where our mind got
[1:08:32] us so he says you probably don't want to
[1:08:34] be the mind let me be the mind and you
[1:08:35] can just follow in my footsteps with
[1:08:37] what I tell you to do amen we're seeking
[1:08:39] what a fellowship that restores us to
[1:08:41] the unity of Oneness with Christ because
[1:08:44] that's what we lost and when that is
[1:08:45] fixed everything else falls into place
[1:08:47] right afterwards
[1:08:48] what the purpose of God will open up the
[1:08:51] power of God in your life to do what you
[1:08:52] have need of
[1:08:54] he says now in the beginning of man
[1:08:55] that's what God give him power over
[1:08:57] everything on Earth
[1:08:59] now through the fall he lost that power
[1:09:01] then he becomes unconscious of the fact
[1:09:04] after losing his relationship and
[1:09:06] friendship his fellowship with the
[1:09:07] father then he lost that and all his
[1:09:09] great channels became clogged up and he
[1:09:11] couldn't get through now what Adam was
[1:09:13] in God Christ has redeemed us back to
[1:09:16] that now a redeemer to redeem anything
[1:09:18] is to bring it back to its origin again
[1:09:19] this is a massive quote it's like two
[1:09:21] pages
[1:09:22] but he takes us through the fall all the
[1:09:25] way to to full redemption in about eight
[1:09:26] paragraphs so just stick with me here as
[1:09:28] we go through it he says Adam never had
[1:09:30] to be sick he never had to die
[1:09:34] or being restored to now
[1:09:36] he never had a heartache he never had
[1:09:38] fear he just climbed up in the arms of
[1:09:40] the father just like a child everything
[1:09:42] was his and whatever he asked why he
[1:09:45] just got it everything obeyed him
[1:09:47] because he was God's child and the child
[1:09:49] is heir of all things now when man fell
[1:09:51] he lost this
[1:09:53] so now you have heartache now you have
[1:09:55] sickness now you have headaches now you
[1:09:56] have worries now you have fears now what
[1:09:59] he lost in the fall Christ came as a
[1:10:01] redeemer did you ever stop to think what
[1:10:03] Christ redeemed us for he gave us
[1:10:06] everlasting life he brought us back to
[1:10:08] the Eternal fellowship and relationship
[1:10:11] to God to be his sons and daughters
[1:10:14] again to restore back all that Adam lost
[1:10:17] in the fall so what does he start with
[1:10:19] he doesn't start with with Dominion he
[1:10:22] starts with fellowship and then
[1:10:24] relationship
[1:10:26] right what is the purpose he says of his
[1:10:28] Redemption to bring us back to Eternal
[1:10:30] fellowship and relationship he says now
[1:10:33] the thing of it is he has restored man
[1:10:35] back to this place man in the fall has
[1:10:37] lost his conscience of what god of what
[1:10:39] father put him here on Earth to do in
[1:10:41] other words all the plumbing as it was
[1:10:43] in our brain and the outlets of faith
[1:10:45] has been clogged up with business
[1:10:47] affairs with home life domestic things
[1:10:50] it's all become so clogged up that until
[1:10:52] God can't operate through those channels
[1:10:55] he made a man for
[1:10:56] now when God made the human body every
[1:10:58] little part had its place to play
[1:11:01] the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose
[1:11:03] God does everything in there to make it
[1:11:06] perfect in operation to make the man to
[1:11:08] live
[1:11:09] and if God so patterned the man the body
[1:11:12] of a man how much more has he patterned
[1:11:14] and said in order the body of Christ the
[1:11:16] church
[1:11:17] every single part is needed and it has a
[1:11:21] particular purpose to do what is
[1:11:23] intended
[1:11:24] he says and if
[1:11:26] God designed man's body he certainly
[1:11:29] designed the body of his son the church
[1:11:30] and he's designed us to come together
[1:11:33] not individually zip up
[1:11:36] he says to come together in Heavenly
[1:11:39] places in Christ Jesus and have these
[1:11:42] Supernatural workings of God Outlets
[1:11:45] that's what he says the supernatural
[1:11:46] workings of God is is Outlets through
[1:11:48] you
[1:11:49] so through the gifts of spirits such as
[1:11:51] prophecy wisdom knowledge the gifts of
[1:11:53] healing and all these other different
[1:11:55] gifts is Outlets that God lets out his
[1:11:58] power and lets out his Revelation to the
[1:12:00] people
[1:12:01] and not as an individual so much but as
[1:12:04] a unit we're all together one great big
[1:12:06] body of Believers and how do we get into
[1:12:09] this body the Mystic body of the Lord
[1:12:11] Jesus he says by one Spirit we're all
[1:12:13] baptized into this body notice that's
[1:12:16] the key he says you want to see God move
[1:12:18] get in unity with the true bride of
[1:12:20] Christ because it says it's not so much
[1:12:22] individuals it's us all coming together
[1:12:25] amen
[1:12:27] what is it get in line with the word of
[1:12:28] God for your day and I'll start pulling
[1:12:31] together
[1:12:31] right
[1:12:33] you've got to be in unity
[1:12:35] you've got to be in unity types the
[1:12:37] anointing of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:12:38] unity of the Brethren to the exact same
[1:12:40] thing
[1:12:40] so if you've got the anointing of the
[1:12:42] Holy Spirit you're going to be in unity
[1:12:43] with somebody I was telling my wife
[1:12:45] about a brother I use the term loosely
[1:12:47] that I ran across on Facebook that was
[1:12:49] calling out these ministers and whatnot
[1:12:50] and then he he had called out a certain
[1:12:52] Minister on Doctrine and then he said
[1:12:54] but he doesn't want to talk to me
[1:12:55] because I've been married four times
[1:12:58] and then he says and then the one I'm
[1:13:00] I'm engaged to so he's married he's
[1:13:02] about to be married to a fifth person
[1:13:03] wasn't in the message when I met her you
[1:13:06] know so this is a guy that can't even
[1:13:07] manage his his relationships in life but
[1:13:10] he wants to go around correcting
[1:13:11] ministers no wonder they don't want to
[1:13:12] talk to him because he's what blind to
[1:13:13] everything but his own righteousness and
[1:13:15] he's convinced himself that he's the
[1:13:17] spiritual one out of everybody
[1:13:19] what is it he's out there alone he can't
[1:13:21] go to church he's been to every Church
[1:13:22] it seems like he says I never fit in
[1:13:24] well why because he's righteous in his
[1:13:27] own eyes what he doesn't get in line
[1:13:29] with the word he doesn't tie himself
[1:13:30] into the body of Christ and so he's a
[1:13:32] lone sheep roaming around there and what
[1:13:33] has he done he's gotten married five
[1:13:35] times
[1:13:36] congratulations right it's not taking
[1:13:39] him anywhere because he's just a lone
[1:13:41] wolf
[1:13:42] right he's a sheep but he's acting like
[1:13:43] a lone wolf and that doesn't work out
[1:13:44] well for sheep in case you didn't know
[1:13:47] he says now Satan by the laws of sin and
[1:13:49] death makes everything that sin and
[1:13:51] death brought bought operate to send to
[1:13:54] cancer for instance he says man
[1:13:55] recognized it and receives it Satan
[1:13:57] sends heartaches we recognize it and
[1:13:59] receive it and if Satan by his power can
[1:14:02] make his laws work in man how much more
[1:14:04] god with his power make his laws work in
[1:14:07] men if Satan can make his laws be sure
[1:14:10] and US recognize it how much more ought
[1:14:13] to his children to make his laws be
[1:14:15] recognized among his people of Divine
[1:14:17] Healing Revelation power gifts and
[1:14:20] manifestations of the spirit
[1:14:22] if you've got we talked about that
[1:14:24] antenna that receiver last time if your
[1:14:26] flesh can so quickly receive what Satan
[1:14:28] sends then why can't your soul receive
[1:14:30] so quickly what God sends that's what
[1:14:32] he's saying here is if we're for tuned
[1:14:33] to receive it then we ought to be
[1:14:35] receiving it
[1:14:36] the law of sin and death works in the
[1:14:38] people and the law of Liberty of Christ
[1:14:40] has come unto us to set us free from
[1:14:42] those things he says so I believe this
[1:14:44] with all my heart I believe that we're
[1:14:45] nearing the age when people are going to
[1:14:48] recognize these things listen the age is
[1:14:50] here he preached us I think in 1955
[1:14:53] sometime 50 or 55 55 yes
[1:14:58] 2022
[1:15:00] it's here
[1:15:01] he says that we've had so much vain
[1:15:04] philosophy and so forth and teachings
[1:15:07] that ought not to be until it has set
[1:15:08] the human mind to a revolution of
[1:15:10] thinking on matters of this and that and
[1:15:13] taking it away from the word of God he
[1:15:15] says as I've said Faith doesn't come by
[1:15:17] fasting Faith doesn't come by praying
[1:15:20] reading a book all that's good he says
[1:15:23] fasting praying and reading a book but
[1:15:25] faith comes by a settled something
[1:15:27] that's in the human heart
[1:15:30] he says that tells you just as sure as
[1:15:33] you come to this church tonight when you
[1:15:35] come home you told your wife you'd be
[1:15:36] home after the service was over you do
[1:15:38] that unconsciously you just go out and
[1:15:40] get in your car and go on home now you
[1:15:42] could not do it unless you have faith
[1:15:44] you could do it you'd never move from
[1:15:45] where you're sitting if you didn't have
[1:15:47] faith you couldn't raise up but you've
[1:15:49] done it so much and you've just become
[1:15:51] so accustomed to those laws till it's a
[1:15:54] natural thing he says what I settled
[1:15:56] something in the human heart I call that
[1:15:58] rest
[1:15:59] right that's a piece that passes all
[1:16:01] understanding amen I called that sealed
[1:16:03] to the day of our Redemption right where
[1:16:05] the same question has been settled
[1:16:07] forever and so there's no worries or
[1:16:09] concerns now you're good to go and so
[1:16:12] then you step into everything else that
[1:16:13] Redemption has to offer because the big
[1:16:15] one settled where you're going when this
[1:16:17] life ends right what is it your new
[1:16:20] creation in Christ as we talked about
[1:16:21] and now you're part of his body
[1:16:24] he says now if we could just throw
[1:16:26] ourselves completely to God
[1:16:29] and to his will and be lost to our own
[1:16:32] thoughts and just let the mind of Christ
[1:16:35] be in us then same operations of the
[1:16:38] spirit will work through us just as the
[1:16:40] Natural Things does just the same thing
[1:16:43] brother Jonathan I want more in my life
[1:16:45] from God here you go throw yourself
[1:16:48] completely to God
[1:16:50] completely to God and to his will and be
[1:16:53] lost to your own thoughts that's how
[1:16:55] you're going to get there
[1:16:56] he says because we are first created for
[1:16:59] that purpose to control to rule and to
[1:17:03] praise God and to live for God now Jesus
[1:17:06] said if you abide in me and my words
[1:17:08] abide in you you can ask what you will
[1:17:09] and it shall be given unto you and if
[1:17:11] you abide in me and my word abide in you
[1:17:13] now the father in his word is
[1:17:16] inseparable because the word is in his
[1:17:17] son in the beginning was the word the
[1:17:19] word was with God the Word was God and
[1:17:21] the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:17:23] Us God and His word is inseparable you
[1:17:26] cannot have god without having his word
[1:17:28] and when you have his word he says you
[1:17:31] have God and you'll see in denominations
[1:17:33] and what do they have they believe they
[1:17:34] have the word the word the word or they
[1:17:36] believe they're saved they've got God
[1:17:37] they've got God God they've got the Holy
[1:17:39] Spirit even and then when you look at
[1:17:40] what they're believing it doesn't match
[1:17:42] up with the word of God so what do they
[1:17:44] have it can't be God because God doesn't
[1:17:47] change he's not a man that he should LIE
[1:17:49] there's no variableness neither shadow
[1:17:51] of turning within him and so if he is
[1:17:53] different than what his word says then
[1:17:55] you can't have him it can't be be what
[1:17:57] you have because he would not deny his
[1:17:59] word and still be in you it doesn't work
[1:18:01] that way
[1:18:03] he says if you want to go back a little
[1:18:04] further just as far as history you could
[1:18:06] see the word in the beginning was the
[1:18:08] word but what is the word he says a word
[1:18:11] is a thought manifested a thought spoken
[1:18:13] forth God first he perceived the thought
[1:18:16] and spoke it and it became a word and
[1:18:19] the word became material
[1:18:21] now this is where we were going with all
[1:18:23] this he says so everything that God has
[1:18:26] spoken his word received into the right
[1:18:29] channel will materialize that word for
[1:18:32] whatever the promise is behind it God
[1:18:34] will do it he's obligated to it I want
[1:18:36] to break into that a little bit because
[1:18:37] he says everything God has spoken that's
[1:18:40] the word past tense it's already done
[1:18:43] it's already been said it's already been
[1:18:44] thought it's already been expressed
[1:18:46] right now it's time to bring it out he
[1:18:47] says everything that God has spoken
[1:18:50] received into the right channel present
[1:18:53] tense
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:55] in the correct time and in the right
[1:18:57] season in the right channel so guess
[1:18:59] what you can put the word in the wrong
[1:19:01] Channel and it won't do what it's
[1:19:03] supposed to do there are things that I
[1:19:05] am not supposed to do in this life and
[1:19:07] there are things that you are supposed
[1:19:08] to do that I'm not because God has
[1:19:10] chosen each of us to express his word
[1:19:12] differently there may be great areas of
[1:19:14] commonality but I guarantee you there
[1:19:16] are areas of your life where he's
[1:19:17] expressing himself in a way that he's
[1:19:19] not in mind so it's got to be in the
[1:19:20] right Channel
[1:19:22] and that's of his choosing not of our
[1:19:24] choosing
[1:19:25] it says received into the right channel
[1:19:27] will
[1:19:29] will means a hundred percent absolute
[1:19:32] gonna happen there's no maybes there's
[1:19:34] no possibilities or it's just potential
[1:19:36] it will materialize the word for
[1:19:39] whatever promises behind it you will he
[1:19:42] says God will do it right it's not you
[1:19:44] it's not me God will do it you're there
[1:19:47] to receive you're the channel
[1:19:49] to receive the word he says and it's
[1:19:52] just the work of God doing it from start
[1:19:53] to finish he says then if you abide in
[1:19:56] me and my word abide in you then you
[1:19:59] have God the word in you and you believe
[1:20:01] the word just as you believe God because
[1:20:03] it is God and it's Inseparable then if
[1:20:06] you have God's word in you you have
[1:20:08] God's life in you you have God in you
[1:20:10] and whatever God's word speaks forth out
[1:20:13] of you
[1:20:14] they don't have to come to pass just
[1:20:17] like it was spoke from God
[1:20:21] he says whatever God's word speaks out
[1:20:23] of you
[1:20:25] there's got to be an influence here
[1:20:28] and that influence is based on
[1:20:29] relationship not just based on our
[1:20:31] ability to read the word
[1:20:32] and then there's something that speaks
[1:20:34] out of us amen I spoke on this in the
[1:20:36] last service we're not looking for a new
[1:20:37] word we're not looking to add to it and
[1:20:40] we're not looking to take away from it
[1:20:41] we're looking to stick with what he said
[1:20:43] and then we're looking to stick to the
[1:20:45] plan that he has and when we go into
[1:20:47] that then what do we have we have Unity
[1:20:49] of the bride and the groom and then life
[1:20:51] comes out of it and brother Brown says
[1:20:52] that looks like what God's word coming
[1:20:55] forth out of you I mean that's what it's
[1:20:57] going to look like amen this is the
[1:20:59] proof that you and here are one is when
[1:21:00] life comes forth when the word comes
[1:21:02] forth out of you when it's a real thing
[1:21:04] Jesus said whatever you ask the father
[1:21:06] of my name that will I do did you ever
[1:21:09] realize what that means do you realize
[1:21:11] if we go before God In The Name of Jesus
[1:21:14] it's just the same as Jesus himself
[1:21:16] praying it isn't me praying anymore
[1:21:20] but that doesn't mean I have carte
[1:21:22] blanche to just go up and ask him
[1:21:24] anything I want
[1:21:25] the expectation is that we pray
[1:21:27] according to the spirit amen that we
[1:21:29] have an influence behind our prayers
[1:21:31] that we're not just like kids going up
[1:21:32] and I want the latest Shiny Toy or I
[1:21:34] want the latest gift or I want the
[1:21:36] latest no no we're going up under an
[1:21:38] influence under an inspiration because
[1:21:40] we're in relationship amen we're going
[1:21:42] up and we're saying I want to use what
[1:21:44] you have for me but I've caught the mind
[1:21:46] of Christ and so I'm asking according to
[1:21:48] the mind of Christ
[1:21:50] he says if I come in his name and he
[1:21:52] recognizes his name there's only one way
[1:21:55] you can come in a man's name and that's
[1:21:57] if you're married to
[1:21:59] right
[1:22:00] listen there's only one woman can come
[1:22:02] in the name of Jonathan curlette to my
[1:22:04] bank
[1:22:06] why Mrs Jonathan curlette that's who she
[1:22:09] is
[1:22:09] you've got to have the name of Christ
[1:22:11] and the only way you get that name is
[1:22:12] not because you know about him it's
[1:22:14] because you're married to him amen that
[1:22:15] you have stepped into an intimate
[1:22:17] relationship and the only intimate
[1:22:18] relationship that the Bible sanctions is
[1:22:20] through marriage so he can only be
[1:22:21] intimate with you if there's been a
[1:22:23] marriage that has happened Amen brother
[1:22:24] Brown preached the invisible Union of
[1:22:26] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:22:27] bride it's already happening here this
[1:22:30] is where the marriage is this is the
[1:22:31] ceremony right here
[1:22:33] he says whatever you ask the father my
[1:22:35] name that I do and then I go to the
[1:22:37] father in Jesus name and it isn't me
[1:22:39] praying anymore it's Jesus it's his
[1:22:42] Spirit praying through me and then I've
[1:22:44] got to receive what I asked for because
[1:22:46] he said it and it's God's Own word it
[1:22:48] can't do nothing else but produce what
[1:22:50] it said why because it's not two bodies
[1:22:53] it's not a CEO and a secretary it is one
[1:22:56] body it is his mind my lips but we're
[1:22:58] all in the same body it's just his lips
[1:23:00] speaking it through what my flesh that's
[1:23:03] all this is just a microphone really if
[1:23:05] we want to look at it that way amen we
[1:23:07] have the same vision we have the same
[1:23:08] direction we have the same intelligence
[1:23:09] we have the same mind and so what when
[1:23:11] the voice speaks it's going to be the
[1:23:12] same thing as well because you're in
[1:23:14] line with him because he's the one
[1:23:15] inspiring it in the first place
[1:23:17] brother Bob says this is the confidence
[1:23:20] we have in God that we get what we ask
[1:23:22] for for he's God and cannot take back
[1:23:24] his word he's got to stay with his word
[1:23:26] so then if you abide in me and my words
[1:23:29] abide in you ask what you will and it'll
[1:23:31] be given to you he says isn't it that
[1:23:33] simple but so often what we skip is what
[1:23:35] if my words you abide in me
[1:23:38] and my words abide in you that's
[1:23:40] relationship that's connection that's
[1:23:42] beyond Fellowship that's well into
[1:23:44] relationship and intimacy is that you've
[1:23:46] got to be with him to get to this place
[1:23:49] it's not just reading the Bible and then
[1:23:50] going to God with the scriptures and
[1:23:52] saying well I want this and I want this
[1:23:53] and I'm ready for this no no you've got
[1:23:55] to have the abiding part before you get
[1:23:56] the asking part
[1:23:59] he says we were made he says isn't that
[1:24:01] simple Faith created we was made for
[1:24:04] that purpose then through the fall why
[1:24:06] we was taken away from that and then in
[1:24:08] Redemption we're brought back to it
[1:24:09] again and the only thing that hinders
[1:24:11] the human race today from being Superior
[1:24:13] and controlling like they did in the
[1:24:14] beginning is because the power lines of
[1:24:17] the outlet of God made in the human
[1:24:18] being has been clogged up what did he
[1:24:21] say it was relationships
[1:24:23] cares of Life business all these
[1:24:26] different things he says that's what
[1:24:27] clogged us up is the busyness of our
[1:24:29] life and the things that we get so
[1:24:30] caught up in he says That's What's
[1:24:31] blocking God from working in our lives
[1:24:33] the very thing we need him in is the
[1:24:35] thing that's blocking him so many times
[1:24:38] now I want to make a transition here
[1:24:39] because we talked about the purpose of
[1:24:41] relationship but now we want to talk
[1:24:43] about the power of relationship because
[1:24:45] as I said if there's an intimacy in in a
[1:24:48] relationship then something has to
[1:24:49] happen
[1:24:50] something's got to come out of it amen
[1:24:51] if there's true intimacy then
[1:24:53] something's going to happen in you and
[1:24:54] for the believer that power is the Life
[1:24:56] of Christ in you amen we read earlier
[1:24:58] Paul where Paul says I didn't come with
[1:25:00] enticing words but he said I came with
[1:25:01] power and demonstration of the spirit
[1:25:03] and that's what it looks like in a
[1:25:05] believer's life
[1:25:07] brother Rams starts with this he says
[1:25:08] let me say something too he says this
[1:25:10] uniting time to see churches uniting
[1:25:12] Nations uniting it's a uniting time of
[1:25:16] God and his bride too and I say this was
[1:25:18] reverence and respect I believe that the
[1:25:20] bride of Christ is called I believe
[1:25:23] she's sealed in the kingdom of God I
[1:25:25] believe the mechanics is here they're
[1:25:27] waiting for the Dynamics that'll take
[1:25:29] her off the earth into glory in the
[1:25:32] rapture
[1:25:33] I believe it with all my heart yes sir
[1:25:35] this is so what shall we do with Jesus
[1:25:37] called Christ 1963.
[1:25:39] we don't know how he's going to do it
[1:25:42] but he shall do it he is the Dynamics
[1:25:47] what boggles my mind sometimes is how
[1:25:50] many people are sitting there say it's
[1:25:52] the Mysteries it's the Mysteries it's
[1:25:54] the Mysteries that's the Dynamics we
[1:25:55] need
[1:25:56] brother Brown never said the Mysteries
[1:25:57] was going to take us off this Earth
[1:26:00] right he'd say there's rapturing faith
[1:26:02] lies there and either you know those
[1:26:03] different things but he says the
[1:26:04] Dynamics is what Christ
[1:26:06] how do you prove that by the word
[1:26:09] what did Peter know about the Seven
[1:26:10] Seals
[1:26:14] nothing
[1:26:15] but he had the Dynamics didn't he
[1:26:17] they were ignorant and unlearned but it
[1:26:19] says that they knew they'd been with
[1:26:20] Jesus amen the Dynamics is the person of
[1:26:23] Christ in your life you've got to have
[1:26:25] the word you've got to be right with
[1:26:27] that because that'll keep you going
[1:26:28] straight it'll keep you in his will amen
[1:26:30] but knowing that knowing that's just
[1:26:32] mechanics that's just knowing how it
[1:26:34] works that's knowing the way it's
[1:26:35] supposed to go and the way you're
[1:26:37] supposed to do things but he says he is
[1:26:39] the Dynamics we just become members of
[1:26:41] the machine of his body forming
[1:26:43] ourselves into his image and see him
[1:26:45] uniting himself with us in his works
[1:26:48] with his love gifts as he hands them to
[1:26:50] us just before the wedding supper just
[1:26:53] before the wedding supper brother John
[1:26:56] do you think there's going to be a
[1:26:57] massive manifestation for years before
[1:26:58] we go not according to this seals are
[1:27:01] open he's saying just before the wedding
[1:27:03] supper is when you're going to see the
[1:27:04] Dynamics really break forward
[1:27:06] because why it's only going to be a
[1:27:08] quick short work right and then we're
[1:27:09] out of here the purpose of those
[1:27:11] Dynamics is just a quick proof of who we
[1:27:13] are and then we're gone
[1:27:17] he says we're waiting watching for that
[1:27:19] their big church is to be United the
[1:27:22] Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:27:24] refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have
[1:27:27] worked in a small measure while The
[1:27:29] Headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:27:31] the body but when that head and body
[1:27:33] unites together the full power of the
[1:27:36] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[1:27:38] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:27:40] dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago
[1:27:42] will rise in the beauty of his Holiness
[1:27:45] and take a flight to the skies he says
[1:27:47] the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit
[1:27:52] we got filled when we had the new birth
[1:27:54] didn't we
[1:27:55] that's why we keep seeking a greater and
[1:27:58] a greater feeling and a refilling and a
[1:28:00] refilling is because there's absolutely
[1:28:01] more to be had amen if we can give more
[1:28:04] that means we can get more you know and
[1:28:06] I know I can give more so if I can give
[1:28:08] more than I know that he can give more
[1:28:10] to fill in what I'm giving away amen you
[1:28:12] know you think about it Fellowship is
[1:28:14] static
[1:28:15] fellowship's wonderful it's like the
[1:28:17] courtship when you're about to get
[1:28:19] married amen it's moving you towards
[1:28:21] relationship but nothing happens in
[1:28:23] Fellowship it's a warm fuzzy feeling the
[1:28:25] food's great you bask in the glow of
[1:28:27] love and all these different things but
[1:28:29] it's just preparing you for the real
[1:28:31] thing
[1:28:32] it's bringing you into what the full
[1:28:34] expression of love I mean it's bringing
[1:28:36] you into something that's going to prove
[1:28:37] that you actually love each other they
[1:28:39] meant through a union that and it's
[1:28:40] going to bring forth the life out of
[1:28:42] these things amen so it has to go past
[1:28:44] church sermons
[1:28:45] has to go past message tapes and message
[1:28:47] books has to go through the the great
[1:28:49] Ministries that you might have on on
[1:28:51] your phone and these different things
[1:28:53] amen it has to come to a place beyond
[1:28:55] just Fellowship to a place of
[1:28:56] relationship where it's you and it's him
[1:28:58] and that's it
[1:29:00] amen where you can say he's with me and
[1:29:03] I'm with him and there's nobody else in
[1:29:05] the room we sing that song into that
[1:29:07] chamber be free Holy Spirit that's what
[1:29:10] we're looking for that's what we're
[1:29:11] looking for and even as these words are
[1:29:13] coming over the pulpit and whoever might
[1:29:15] be preaching these different things
[1:29:16] you're not looking for anything with me
[1:29:18] you're looking for what the spirit
[1:29:19] that's hopefully behind it to come in
[1:29:21] and Quicken those things to you to make
[1:29:23] it alive to make it real to show you
[1:29:25] where it works in your life and what
[1:29:27] it's supposed to do
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] the Dynamics for the bride is what the
[1:29:33] Holy Spirit he says that's the
[1:29:34] unification of the bridegroom and the
[1:29:36] bride is the holy spirit that's the
[1:29:38] thing that ties us into the body that's
[1:29:40] the unifying proof that's the Seal of
[1:29:42] our soul is the is the baptism of the
[1:29:44] holy spirit in your life amen he says
[1:29:46] now the power of the believing Church
[1:29:49] we're looking for power he says Christ
[1:29:52] has all power in heavens and earth you
[1:29:55] believe it he says now what if he's in
[1:29:57] you has Christ still got all the power
[1:29:58] Matthew 28 18 all right he is the seed
[1:30:02] word in his body and he and US becomes a
[1:30:06] seed word in us so it's something that
[1:30:09] has what potential to grow into
[1:30:11] something else
[1:30:12] he says what all that God was he poured
[1:30:15] into Christ all Christ was he poured
[1:30:16] into the church that's the power
[1:30:20] the power is Christ in you now watch he
[1:30:23] says remember God's law of reproduction
[1:30:25] now remember after its kind we talked
[1:30:28] about this in the last service where it
[1:30:30] doesn't matter who a woman's with until
[1:30:31] she is with someone of the same race of
[1:30:34] the same not the same race but the same
[1:30:36] species she cannot bring forth life she
[1:30:39] has to be with that which she is amen so
[1:30:42] a human has to be with a human a dog has
[1:30:44] to be with a dog a horse has to be with
[1:30:46] a horse and he says what God's law of
[1:30:48] reproduction now remember it has to
[1:30:50] produce after its kind
[1:30:54] he says is that right the seed of Christ
[1:30:56] the word must come through his body so
[1:30:59] if you're a part of that body then it
[1:31:01] can only bring forth what it is which is
[1:31:03] the word of God in you he says I want to
[1:31:05] get this in real good I want this to
[1:31:07] grind down the seed of Christ must
[1:31:09] m-u-s-t must come through his body not
[1:31:12] through a denomination but through a
[1:31:14] born-again seed of the word it must come
[1:31:16] through now remember what is it Christ
[1:31:18] see how does my seed come he says
[1:31:20] through the body how's an apple tree
[1:31:21] seed come from through the body seed is
[1:31:24] through the body and the church is the
[1:31:26] body of Christ
[1:31:27] that's right he says the Bible Church
[1:31:29] this birth produces he says the new
[1:31:32] birth produces himself in his body his
[1:31:35] church in his word so that the people
[1:31:37] can do what see the confirmation of
[1:31:39] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:31:42] yesterday today and forever he says you
[1:31:45] believe it these are not denominational
[1:31:47] hybrids now this is those that's in the
[1:31:50] orbit waiting for the countdown you I
[1:31:53] mean fixing to take a rocket he says
[1:31:54] Glory these are not denominational
[1:31:56] hybrids not standing no they're not he
[1:31:58] says here they're not no sir he says
[1:32:00] it's the seed he's talking about a bride
[1:32:02] that's what ready for Rapture that this
[1:32:05] is what she's looking for that this is
[1:32:06] what she's preparing preparing for is to
[1:32:09] get out of here
[1:32:10] that's the last thing that there is
[1:32:11] brother Brown says the only thing I see
[1:32:13] left is the going away the church
[1:32:15] so what are we looking for everything
[1:32:16] else
[1:32:17] we know there's going to be a quick
[1:32:19] short work but our purpose is to get in
[1:32:20] the Rapture come hell or high water
[1:32:23] and we're seeing plenty of that on the
[1:32:24] earth these days aren't we come hell or
[1:32:26] high water we want to get out of this
[1:32:27] place amen and what does that mean he
[1:32:29] says they're in orbit waiting
[1:32:31] you know what that means we've cut all
[1:32:33] the strings we've cut all the ties we've
[1:32:36] cut all of the influences we've cut
[1:32:38] everything away from our lives that
[1:32:39] would hinder us and hold us back
[1:32:41] remember he said there's these things
[1:32:42] that are clogging up the channels that
[1:32:44] God wanted to work through
[1:32:45] what is it you got to get them unclogged
[1:32:47] you got to cut the strings you know they
[1:32:49] talk about cutting the per or the Apron
[1:32:51] Strings for the for the kids you know
[1:32:52] and they're holding on Mamas Don't Wear
[1:32:54] aprons anymore but they used to hold on
[1:32:56] to the Apron Strings to stand up and and
[1:32:58] stick with her and hold on they say you
[1:32:59] got to cut the Apron Strings so that the
[1:33:01] kids will get out and do their thing
[1:33:02] right what are you saying you got to cut
[1:33:04] the Apron Strings to the world you got
[1:33:06] to get loose
[1:33:07] you gotta get separated
[1:33:09] and then you got to get it apart listen
[1:33:11] we're called out
[1:33:12] that means we ought to be out
[1:33:15] you know what I'm saying you know if
[1:33:16] we're called out then why aren't we out
[1:33:19] we can't be in it and I you know we're
[1:33:21] in it but we're not of it we can't be
[1:33:23] one foot in and one foot out if we're
[1:33:24] called out let's get out and stay out
[1:33:26] don't go back in for little things let's
[1:33:28] get out and stay out
[1:33:29] can you imagine getting into the ark and
[1:33:31] just keep running out every day to go in
[1:33:33] and try and get something
[1:33:35] oh I really want that fruit and they
[1:33:36] didn't put it on the boat I'm gonna go
[1:33:38] get that that's what we're doing when we
[1:33:39] leave the word and we go off and and try
[1:33:41] the the smut and the nastiness of this
[1:33:43] world we're saying I want something that
[1:33:45] he didn't put in the ark and guess what
[1:33:46] you'll do that one day in the dark door
[1:33:48] will shut and you'll say was it worth
[1:33:50] what I went out looking for why because
[1:33:52] you got in the habit of being able to
[1:33:53] get back to safety
[1:33:55] right guess what
[1:33:58] he doesn't wink at ignorance anymore we
[1:34:00] have no ignorance amen the word's fully
[1:34:02] open we're sitting under a restoring
[1:34:04] word this is not a time to be jumping in
[1:34:06] and out jumping in and out have you ever
[1:34:08] noticed
[1:34:10] how two Newlyweds
[1:34:13] all I want to do is spend time with each
[1:34:15] other
[1:34:17] that's all they want
[1:34:19] now yes if your family
[1:34:21] sister Lily can come over
[1:34:24] right brother Josh and sister Rochelle
[1:34:26] yeah Mom yeah Dad sure you can come over
[1:34:28] that's fine but if you don't come we're
[1:34:30] fine we're happy
[1:34:32] why
[1:34:34] because they're in relationship now they
[1:34:36] move fast past fellowship and they're
[1:34:37] into relationship and they're so happy
[1:34:40] they're so happy to be with each other
[1:34:42] I trust
[1:34:45] that you don't need everybody else
[1:34:48] that's what he's talking about here
[1:34:50] you're so ready to get out of here the
[1:34:53] marriage ceremony is done and all you
[1:34:54] want to do is go home
[1:34:56] that's it you just want to go home
[1:34:58] damn
[1:35:01] there's nothing here that I'm looking
[1:35:03] for
[1:35:04] when I leave church there's nothing else
[1:35:06] I want to go to
[1:35:07] I'm not saying I can't wait till I get
[1:35:09] this stupid sermon over so I can go home
[1:35:11] and do something
[1:35:12] this is it
[1:35:14] this is where it's at
[1:35:15] yeah and if this ain't doing it for you
[1:35:17] then you're in real trouble you're in
[1:35:19] real trouble if there's something out
[1:35:20] there that means more to you than what's
[1:35:21] here tonight I'm not talking about me
[1:35:23] I'm talking about the preaching of the
[1:35:25] word I'm talking about the things of God
[1:35:26] I mean I'm talking about the power of
[1:35:28] the Holy Spirit to change our lives amen
[1:35:30] all we want to do is spend time with
[1:35:32] what our love
[1:35:34] this is what he's talking about
[1:35:37] have you cut all the strings
[1:35:39] listen sister Rochelle has cut all the
[1:35:41] strings
[1:35:43] she really cut all the strings Blanca
[1:35:45] had to do it Amber had to do it
[1:35:47] Priscilla had to do it what they've had
[1:35:49] to cut the strings and why did they do
[1:35:51] it because he means more in the world
[1:35:54] than anyone else to her
[1:35:56] that's why she does it
[1:35:59] if you haven't cut the strings what does
[1:36:00] it mean
[1:36:03] he doesn't quite mean what you think
[1:36:04] what you're saying he does isn't that
[1:36:06] true
[1:36:09] Peter says Lord have we not forsaken all
[1:36:12] he didn't say we still got a couple
[1:36:14] things back in the world Lord he says
[1:36:15] we've forsaken all to follow you that's
[1:36:18] what he requires of us leave it all
[1:36:20] behind you fall in love with Jesus
[1:36:22] you'll see the same thing happen
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:25] Brothers remember the early days
[1:36:28] when all you could do all you wanted to
[1:36:30] do was spend time with her right brother
[1:36:31] Matt
[1:36:32] now some of us still do
[1:36:34] some of us still don't
[1:36:38] I'm not saying who's who
[1:36:40] but guess what there was a time
[1:36:43] remember I talked last service what did
[1:36:44] what was it that caused the problems in
[1:36:46] the first church age they left their
[1:36:48] first love and we've got to come back to
[1:36:50] our first love if we're ever going to
[1:36:51] get out of here he's got to be our first
[1:36:52] love amen we've got to recognize that
[1:36:54] this is a this is a love story that goes
[1:36:56] way beyond our remembrance amen that
[1:36:59] he's loved us since before we even came
[1:37:01] into being and we're just realizing it
[1:37:03] now
[1:37:04] he says God ever does the same thing
[1:37:08] when he gets ready to use anything he
[1:37:10] says like he got ready to use this old
[1:37:12] star whatever it was this world he had
[1:37:14] to separate the light from the darkness
[1:37:16] when he gets ready to leave to use a
[1:37:19] group of people he has to separate the
[1:37:21] light from the darkness when he gets
[1:37:24] ready to use an individual he separates
[1:37:26] the light from the darkness see
[1:37:29] you get separated get away from those
[1:37:31] influences move past fellowship and into
[1:37:33] relationship that's when you start to
[1:37:35] see what life
[1:37:37] that's when your relationship really
[1:37:39] starts to grow and Blossom because guess
[1:37:41] what now there's no secrets
[1:37:43] nothing's hidden I'm in a mixed crowd
[1:37:45] but nothing's hidden you see The Good
[1:37:47] the Bad and the Ugly don't you
[1:37:50] but it's where the relationship really
[1:37:51] starts to grow is because it gets tested
[1:37:53] because of the flaws not because of the
[1:37:55] perfection
[1:37:56] right and that's what we've got to get
[1:37:58] to with God is we've got to have that
[1:37:59] Honesty to wear what he sees everything
[1:38:02] right and you're not hiding it you're
[1:38:04] not pretending it's not there but he
[1:38:06] sees everything and he's changing into
[1:38:07] you into the image that he had of you
[1:38:09] before it ever began amen what's he
[1:38:11] saying get rid of the cobwebs
[1:38:13] get rid of the the things that clog up
[1:38:15] the channels that he's trying to use
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:20] we talked about last service about how
[1:38:21] if you're only hearing One Voice you're
[1:38:23] only going to have one relationship and
[1:38:25] you're only going to have one love
[1:38:26] and if you've let him in the door shut
[1:38:28] then why are we listening to other
[1:38:29] voices right why are we going to open
[1:38:31] the door to look for somebody else get
[1:38:33] in and once you're sure he's in shut the
[1:38:34] door and stay with him and that'll
[1:38:36] finish the work that you're looking for
[1:38:37] in your life amen
[1:38:38] amen listen
[1:38:41] you're what this world needs
[1:38:43] and more than the food that they have
[1:38:45] and the the roof that they have over
[1:38:47] your head you are literally the living
[1:38:49] breathing embodiment of Christ for this
[1:38:51] world
[1:38:52] that's what they need they need us
[1:38:54] let's be it
[1:38:56] let's be it
[1:38:57] and the only way we can beat is if what
[1:38:59] we cut the strings get away from it all
[1:39:02] right brother I've read this quote
[1:39:04] before he says when God speaks to a man
[1:39:05] he has Faith he has ambition and he has
[1:39:09] a purpose when God speaks to a man he
[1:39:11] gives him a purpose
[1:39:13] when he speaks to a man he gives him
[1:39:14] ambition now we look at ambition as well
[1:39:16] I want to be CEO I want to be a
[1:39:18] millionaire I want to own a Ferrari I
[1:39:19] want to have a massive home on the you
[1:39:21] know whatever it might be no no he says
[1:39:23] he gives him an ambition what is an
[1:39:25] ambition a goal to achieve
[1:39:27] he gives him a goal to achieve that's in
[1:39:29] line with the word of the purpose of God
[1:39:31] when God speaks to a man he gives him
[1:39:33] ambition when God speaks to man he gives
[1:39:35] him Faith to do it to accomplish or
[1:39:37] achieve what his purpose in life is what
[1:39:40] God has called him to do and then he
[1:39:41] says he's called us to be in the Church
[1:39:43] of God Amen first thing is he's called
[1:39:46] to be in the church he's called us to be
[1:39:47] out
[1:39:49] first thing he calls us is out amen
[1:39:50] doubt is the antidote to Faith and so
[1:39:53] often what we have is a great faith in
[1:39:55] God and we have zero faith in ourselves
[1:39:59] and when I say ourselves I don't mean
[1:40:01] our fallen flesh we have great faith in
[1:40:02] who God is and his position and his
[1:40:04] power and his goodness and his greatness
[1:40:06] and all these things but then when it
[1:40:08] comes to who we are in him all of a
[1:40:10] sudden the faith goes to nothing
[1:40:12] why is that
[1:40:14] why is it that we have great faith in
[1:40:15] him but not in ourselves
[1:40:18] because what we haven't been listening
[1:40:20] to what he says about us enough
[1:40:21] we haven't been in relationship with
[1:40:23] them to where when he says you're
[1:40:25] beautiful
[1:40:26] as you're beautiful you're beautiful
[1:40:28] you're beautiful then guess what you
[1:40:30] don't need to run out and paint your
[1:40:31] face with makeup and wear tight tight
[1:40:33] and short clothes and all these things
[1:40:34] sisters but Brothers you don't have to
[1:40:36] have the latest haircut and you don't
[1:40:37] have to have the fanciest car and the
[1:40:39] greatest home and the biggest toys and
[1:40:41] all these different things why because
[1:40:42] he's the one that you're seeking to what
[1:40:45] please
[1:40:47] and he's telling you you're beautiful
[1:40:48] he's telling you you're good I like you
[1:40:51] the way you are
[1:40:54] so instead of what we're doing is we're
[1:40:55] seeing that we're saying this is what I
[1:40:57] ought to be rather than going to him and
[1:40:59] saying Lord how do you want me to be and
[1:41:01] when he gets there and he starts talking
[1:41:03] to you and he starts affirming where
[1:41:05] you're good and changing where you're
[1:41:07] bad then all of a sudden you can have
[1:41:08] confidence that hey he's working with me
[1:41:10] he's talking back to me he's changing my
[1:41:13] life into what he has as an image for me
[1:41:15] and that's what's going to please him
[1:41:17] and so I can have faith so whether he
[1:41:19] makes me a wife
[1:41:21] or whether he makes me a husband whether
[1:41:23] he makes me a single woman or a married
[1:41:25] woman whether he puts me in a
[1:41:27] blue-collar job or a white collar job
[1:41:28] whether I make 300 000 a year whether I
[1:41:31] make thirty thousand a year it doesn't
[1:41:32] matter because he has made me and put me
[1:41:34] in the place that he says is going to be
[1:41:36] best for me to achieve his purpose right
[1:41:40] he is the one we're looking to amen
[1:41:42] we're not here to impress we're here to
[1:41:45] express and so often what we're doing is
[1:41:47] we're looking and we're not impressed
[1:41:48] with ourselves
[1:41:52] maybe it's just me sometimes we're not
[1:41:54] impressed with ourselves but that's not
[1:41:55] what it's about the question is are we
[1:41:57] in his will and are we in his purpose
[1:41:59] are we changing into the image that he
[1:42:01] has for us and if that's the case then
[1:42:03] we can have faith that whatever he has
[1:42:04] placed in front of us is his will and
[1:42:07] we're going to go through it and it's
[1:42:08] going to be done for our good
[1:42:10] amen amen
[1:42:12] and then sometimes what are we looking
[1:42:14] for we're looking for something bigger
[1:42:15] and greater and the bigger and greater
[1:42:18] that we really need is for him to step
[1:42:20] into what we are right now
[1:42:22] that's what makes it big and great you
[1:42:24] know not every not every woman in the
[1:42:28] message has a natural mothering instinct
[1:42:32] I know because I've been around them my
[1:42:34] wife has talked to them not every mother
[1:42:37] that's out there had a baby and
[1:42:39] immediately was just overwhelmed with
[1:42:42] everything she needed to be a mother
[1:42:43] guess what we still have mothers that
[1:42:45] struggle with depression we have still
[1:42:46] have mothers that struggle with weight
[1:42:48] issues we have women that struggle with
[1:42:50] staying at home all the time with
[1:42:51] boredom and all these things guess what
[1:42:53] that's not what it's about and so
[1:42:55] they're looking for something bigger and
[1:42:56] greater but the thing is they are where
[1:42:59] God has called them to be
[1:43:00] and so what they need is not something
[1:43:02] bigger and greater but they need the
[1:43:04] something bigger and greater to come
[1:43:05] step into where they are right now so
[1:43:08] they can see the importance of it so
[1:43:09] they can see the impact of it in the
[1:43:11] kingdom of God and not all of a sudden
[1:43:13] they realize holy cow I am in a very
[1:43:16] important position
[1:43:18] I have a congregation
[1:43:21] I am the Fifth Gospel
[1:43:24] I have promises I have scriptures
[1:43:26] written about me that men can't hope to
[1:43:28] touch
[1:43:29] what is it all they need is The Great I
[1:43:31] Am to step into them to realize that hey
[1:43:33] I am exactly where I'm supposed to be
[1:43:35] doing exactly what I'm supposed to do
[1:43:36] and all I need is for him to anoint me
[1:43:38] so I can realize what it is that I'm
[1:43:40] doing
[1:43:41] and that is all for his glory and for
[1:43:42] his purpose anyways
[1:43:45] brother Brown says we have faith in our
[1:43:46] and we have faith in our heart the faith
[1:43:49] of God in our heart and can see it clear
[1:43:51] it becomes a faith and then we speak it
[1:43:53] and it comes into existence the same
[1:43:55] thing because the mind of Christ is in
[1:43:57] the man he says that's what makes
[1:43:58] healings and so forth he says when you
[1:44:00] get that perfect Revelation just what
[1:44:03] you're doing
[1:44:05] you say well this is for a prophet doing
[1:44:06] great healings and all these no no no he
[1:44:08] says when you get that perfect
[1:44:10] Revelation just what you're doing then
[1:44:13] you know how to walk he says that's it
[1:44:16] because that's the Christian walk it's
[1:44:19] not just pastors it's not just prophets
[1:44:21] it's not just the five-fold ministry but
[1:44:23] he says when you get a revelation of who
[1:44:25] you are and what you're supposed to be
[1:44:27] doing he says that'll lead you down the
[1:44:29] Christian walk that you're supposed to
[1:44:30] be living
[1:44:32] we're not all going to be you know big
[1:44:34] in the eyes of the world or big in the
[1:44:36] eyes of the message but the question is
[1:44:37] are you in your place and purpose and
[1:44:40] when you're there then that's when all
[1:44:41] faith is available to you
[1:44:43] that's when all faith is available to
[1:44:45] you when you're in his will and purpose
[1:44:46] and we'll cover a couple of those
[1:44:48] he says you always have to stand this
[1:44:51] reproach in order to give your testing
[1:44:52] to see every man that comes to Christ
[1:44:55] must first be child trained for the
[1:44:56] purpose that God has ordained you for
[1:44:59] and remember he says if you can just
[1:45:01] keep quiet
[1:45:03] listen you know the thing that teachers
[1:45:05] hate the student that won't shut up
[1:45:12] I had two hands mine and somebody else's
[1:45:13] praise the Lord what the student that
[1:45:15] won't shut up three
[1:45:19] why because you can't learn if you're
[1:45:20] talking
[1:45:22] and listen you may know what they're
[1:45:23] talking about but you may not know where
[1:45:25] the end goal is you may not know how to
[1:45:26] apply it the way that they want you to
[1:45:28] you may not see where they're going but
[1:45:29] if all you're doing is talking you're
[1:45:31] not going to get anywhere he says if we
[1:45:33] can just keep quiet remember if he has
[1:45:35] called you for this there is nothing
[1:45:38] that can keep it from happening there's
[1:45:40] not enough devils in torment but what
[1:45:42] God's word will make manifest you're
[1:45:45] born for a purpose and nobody can take
[1:45:48] your place remember we're thinking about
[1:45:50] the word is a thought expressed
[1:45:52] so nobody can take your thought and
[1:45:55] express it the way you can impossible
[1:45:58] he says God's word will be made manifest
[1:46:01] you're born for a purpose nobody can
[1:46:02] take your place you might have
[1:46:04] impersonators and everything else but
[1:46:06] they'll never take your place he says
[1:46:09] right God's word will Triumph how am I
[1:46:12] going to win brother John God's word
[1:46:14] will try him you the word that is you
[1:46:16] the expression of God through you that's
[1:46:18] what's going to try them remember what
[1:46:20] the scripture says the overcame by what
[1:46:22] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:46:26] their testimony was the word of your
[1:46:27] testimony it is that who he has called
[1:46:29] you to be and what he has placed you on
[1:46:31] this Earth to do that's what you have
[1:46:33] done my testimony is I'm doing what he's
[1:46:35] called me to do and you've got to have
[1:46:37] the exact same one
[1:46:39] he says God's word will try it cannot
[1:46:41] fail there is where every Christian
[1:46:44] ought to stand knowing that and trials
[1:46:47] will come up and seem every way to you
[1:46:49] but remember God has a purpose and it
[1:46:52] will work right
[1:46:54] we gotta rest there because so often it
[1:46:56] looks like everything's gone Haywire
[1:46:58] it's gone hayware but out of the Haywire
[1:47:01] out of the chaos yet God can bring what
[1:47:03] life
[1:47:04] Simplicity peace rest healing all these
[1:47:07] different things
[1:47:08] look at Moses we'll go through a couple
[1:47:10] examples as we start to close he says
[1:47:12] Moses was very persistent he didn't wait
[1:47:15] till he formed an army you know
[1:47:16] sometimes you can get persistent and
[1:47:18] hear the voice of God it makes you do
[1:47:19] things ridiculous to the carnal mind you
[1:47:22] act strange funny you're an odd person
[1:47:23] look how ridiculous Moses acted
[1:47:26] the next day we find him with his wife
[1:47:29] sitting on straddling a mule gershom on
[1:47:31] her hip an old man with Whiskers hanging
[1:47:33] down like this the beer blowing a little
[1:47:35] old 80 year old man with a crooked
[1:47:36] sticking his hand going down the road
[1:47:38] hallelujah hallelujah where are you
[1:47:40] going Moses going down to Egypt to take
[1:47:43] over a one-man Invasion why he had heard
[1:47:46] God
[1:47:49] say Moses wait a minute Sun got too hot
[1:47:52] there's something wrong with you your
[1:47:54] mental condition's not right Moses go
[1:47:56] back he says try to stop him you
[1:47:58] couldn't do it God had told him he was
[1:48:00] going to take over and he did it might
[1:48:02] act funny but he know what he was doing
[1:48:04] he had the mind of God he knowed the
[1:48:07] will of God he knew what he was doing
[1:48:09] and away he went
[1:48:11] remember we spoke last service about how
[1:48:13] God brother Brown said Moses was the
[1:48:16] word and then he said Moses was Christ
[1:48:18] for his day but Moses was not Christ at
[1:48:22] all times because he got ahead of the
[1:48:24] plan of God he got into his own he got
[1:48:26] into his own vision of what that deliver
[1:48:28] looked like and he made a mess of it so
[1:48:31] the word potential was always there but
[1:48:33] until he came in God's time and had God
[1:48:35] an experience with God he wasn't the
[1:48:37] word made flesh but as soon as he
[1:48:39] stepped into that as soon as he met the
[1:48:41] I am and he got his marching orders and
[1:48:43] he obeyed them what happened was he
[1:48:44] became Christ
[1:48:46] he became the word for his day he became
[1:48:48] the anointed one
[1:48:50] and he says that's what you've got to do
[1:48:52] any man can get in that can get in that
[1:48:55] condition know exactly what God's called
[1:48:57] him to do something's going to happen
[1:49:00] yes sir I don't care who it is how sick
[1:49:03] you are what all about it you've got to
[1:49:05] believe it and then you become
[1:49:06] persevered there's nothing going to stop
[1:49:08] you that's right
[1:49:11] so whether you're a wife or whether
[1:49:12] you're a CEO
[1:49:14] whether you're the secretary or the CEO
[1:49:16] amen whether you're blue collar White
[1:49:18] Collar male or female doesn't matter he
[1:49:21] says you get a revelation of what God
[1:49:22] has called you to do and nothing's going
[1:49:25] to stop you
[1:49:26] and he says the first thing he's called
[1:49:27] you to do is be the Church of God
[1:49:29] get out get out get out and then let him
[1:49:33] work through you
[1:49:35] speaking of Samson he says men of them
[1:49:37] soldiers standing there can remember
[1:49:39] seeing him standing with the Jawbone of
[1:49:40] a mule in his hand and a thousand dead
[1:49:42] Philistines laying there how could it
[1:49:45] happen when the Jawbone of a mule hits
[1:49:47] one of those helmets practically an inch
[1:49:48] and a half thick of solid brass you
[1:49:50] strike that Helm with a Jawbone of a
[1:49:52] mule that mule's jaw is going to fly to
[1:49:54] a thousands of pieces
[1:49:55] but Samson
[1:49:57] what with the power of God upon him beat
[1:50:01] down a thousand Philistines breaking
[1:50:04] down their Shields and laying them at
[1:50:06] his feet I'd imagine one of those
[1:50:08] Warriors had fled during that time stood
[1:50:10] back up and remembered is that Samson
[1:50:12] they remembered seeing the Jawbone in
[1:50:14] his hand and saying who else wants some
[1:50:17] of this
[1:50:18] [Laughter]
[1:50:20] can you imagine
[1:50:22] they're coming at You Soldiers they've
[1:50:24] got their armor they've got their great
[1:50:25] weapons and they're falling back from a
[1:50:27] guy who's creeps keeps screaming who
[1:50:30] wants some of this
[1:50:31] right he killed the first hundred who
[1:50:33] wants more guess what they kept coming
[1:50:35] kept coming kept coming until he killed
[1:50:37] a thousand of them he had a thousand of
[1:50:38] them that wanted a piece of him
[1:50:40] then the rest I guess decided no
[1:50:43] who else wants some of this he says he
[1:50:45] was a man who could speak
[1:50:48] why he was a man who was anointed of God
[1:50:51] God promised to bless him he was in the
[1:50:54] strength of Jehovah you know we give
[1:50:56] Samson a pretty hard time Samson was one
[1:50:59] of the most flawed people in the
[1:51:00] scriptures I think
[1:51:01] because he started out bad
[1:51:04] right he met a girl and he got into all
[1:51:06] these troubles but do you know that in
[1:51:07] the middle of that Samson judged Israel
[1:51:09] peacefully for 20 years
[1:51:11] 20 years he did exactly what God wanted
[1:51:13] him to do
[1:51:14] then he got off with a woman again
[1:51:15] Samson's weakness was obviously women
[1:51:17] but in the end he said Lord just once
[1:51:20] more
[1:51:21] just once more I messed it up I know
[1:51:23] I've messed it up but he says once more
[1:51:25] and you know why God answered him
[1:51:27] because Samson was back to doing what he
[1:51:29] was supposed to do which is kill
[1:51:31] Philistines he said let me kill
[1:51:33] Philistines he says I'll die with them
[1:51:36] I'm okay with that he says but let me
[1:51:37] kill Philistines and just once more God
[1:51:39] gave him the strength and he killed more
[1:51:40] in that day than he killed in his entire
[1:51:42] life
[1:51:42] right he put himself back into the
[1:51:45] purpose that God had put him on the
[1:51:46] earth for and that's where God met his
[1:51:48] prayer you've got to stay where God
[1:51:50] wants you to be
[1:51:52] I want to close with this idea of
[1:51:53] resistance by relationship we've talked
[1:51:56] about adoption we've talked about
[1:51:57] relationships and marriage between the
[1:51:59] bride and Christ and the mature bride
[1:52:01] and like I said we're not a school girl
[1:52:03] frolicking around and just having a fun
[1:52:05] time with the boys and these different
[1:52:06] things but we're talking about a bride
[1:52:08] that's in a close relationship
[1:52:10] right and the security that she has is
[1:52:12] in her relationship with Christ right
[1:52:15] that is with the word the person of
[1:52:17] Christ but it is through the word of God
[1:52:18] that we see the things that he he thinks
[1:52:20] and wills and he wants and this is what
[1:52:22] keeps us secure like I said I read
[1:52:24] there's an overcomer that means there's
[1:52:25] an overcomer right in this last stage
[1:52:27] and it tells me there's healing and
[1:52:29] deliverance and provision and guidance
[1:52:31] and Direction correction chastisement
[1:52:33] all of these things are in here and
[1:52:35] guess what if I see it that gives me
[1:52:36] confidence that he's God because I don't
[1:52:39] get away with things
[1:52:41] I see people in the world get away with
[1:52:42] things all the time I don't get away
[1:52:43] with things why because I'm a Child of
[1:52:45] God that gives me confidence in who I am
[1:52:47] amen and it's that closeness of
[1:52:49] relationship where I've taken that as my
[1:52:51] absolute where I've taken him as my
[1:52:53] absolute that gives me strength when the
[1:52:55] trying times come but guess what Satan
[1:52:57] wants to break up relationships doesn't
[1:52:58] he we see it in the world right we see
[1:53:01] it in the brother even within the
[1:53:02] message five five women you know he's in
[1:53:05] the business of trying to break up
[1:53:07] relationships brother Bob's talking
[1:53:09] about Jesus he says now when he came he
[1:53:11] said I just do what the father shows me
[1:53:13] to do that's what I do when he shows me
[1:53:15] I don't do nothing I can't do nothing
[1:53:16] till he tells me when he passed by the
[1:53:19] pool and seen all the people and he
[1:53:20] healed amen and the Jews questioned him
[1:53:23] why he said I do nothing but what the
[1:53:24] father shows me I can't do nothing but
[1:53:27] whatever he does he shows me and then I
[1:53:29] go do that he says that's it that's true
[1:53:31] Saint John 5 19. he says and we notice
[1:53:34] him he was a kind man a humble man and
[1:53:37] yet he was a man of power when he spoke
[1:53:40] he was very humble and gentle
[1:53:43] I don't know if I remarked on this over
[1:53:45] the pulpit a while ago but just
[1:53:47] listening to to brother Branham and he
[1:53:49] did a 45-minute prayer line and guess
[1:53:51] what he didn't scream once he didn't
[1:53:53] shout once he wasn't dancing around he
[1:53:55] was just speaking very calmly very
[1:53:57] quietly and it stands out to me when I
[1:53:59] see that in contrast so often to the
[1:54:01] yelling and the shouting and the
[1:54:03] Thundering out and these different
[1:54:04] things and nothing wrong with that by no
[1:54:06] means nothing wrong with it but brother
[1:54:07] Brown points to Christ and he says he
[1:54:09] was very humble and gentle with all that
[1:54:11] Authority you know
[1:54:14] but Satan on the other hand he's looking
[1:54:16] to make a show isn't he loud flashy
[1:54:19] glittery get people there but he's
[1:54:21] always on the prowl trying to trying to
[1:54:23] break up relationships and brother Brown
[1:54:24] starts talking about that he says but
[1:54:26] when it comes time between to separate
[1:54:28] between truth and error Jesus was very
[1:54:30] Stern picked up some ropes tied them
[1:54:33] together kicked over the money Chargers
[1:54:34] table and beat them out of the temple
[1:54:36] called the Pharisees those religious
[1:54:38] people and said well you bunch of
[1:54:39] Hypocrites you serpents Snakes in the
[1:54:41] Grass and all these things see he was a
[1:54:44] man who could speak when it come time to
[1:54:45] speak
[1:54:47] he wasn't always gentle
[1:54:49] he says he was a man who was full of
[1:54:51] love but he loved his father so much
[1:54:54] till he stayed in harmony with his
[1:54:56] father and anything
[1:54:59] that interfered with that Harmony then
[1:55:02] Jesus draw the line
[1:55:04] right so the question is are you willing
[1:55:07] to draw the line to protect your
[1:55:09] relationship with Christ
[1:55:10] because the proof of a of a broken
[1:55:12] relationship is when you can't talk to
[1:55:14] him
[1:55:15] when you can't approach him when you
[1:55:17] can't spend time with him when there's a
[1:55:19] barrier between you and him that means
[1:55:21] that you're not holding that
[1:55:23] relationship the most sacred thing
[1:55:24] you've allowed something to come between
[1:55:26] you and him so the question is what
[1:55:28] keeps us away from him
[1:55:30] what holds us back shame guilt iniquity
[1:55:34] we're doing things we know we know ought
[1:55:35] to be doing
[1:55:36] right something we need deliverance from
[1:55:38] addictions
[1:55:40] shame offenses hurts
[1:55:43] pick your poison he said what anything
[1:55:45] that interfere with that Harmony Jesus
[1:55:47] draw the line
[1:55:49] are we Drawing the Line today
[1:55:50] is there anything holding you back from
[1:55:53] his word
[1:55:54] if there is draw the line
[1:55:56] cut the strings amen
[1:55:58] then we see how Sly Satan is because he
[1:56:00] starts to put conditions on your
[1:56:02] relationship he starts to try and Define
[1:56:03] your relationship with Christ and we
[1:56:05] know that because when he came and he
[1:56:06] tempted Jesus in the desert what did he
[1:56:09] do if thou be the Christ right he says
[1:56:12] he challenged his position and our
[1:56:13] position is in Christ our relationship
[1:56:15] is through Christ and so he comes to us
[1:56:17] and he's doing the same thing and he's
[1:56:18] saying if you're the bride you ought to
[1:56:20] be able to do this and you ought to be
[1:56:22] able to do that you ought to be able to
[1:56:23] go here and this ought to be in your
[1:56:25] life and this ought to be out of your
[1:56:26] life and all these things and we've got
[1:56:27] Satan trying to give us relationship
[1:56:28] advice
[1:56:30] trying to get us to prove ourselves to
[1:56:32] him why would we ever prove anything to
[1:56:34] Satan we've got nothing to prove we're
[1:56:37] not wrapped in our righteousness we're
[1:56:38] wrapped in Christ righteousness amen we
[1:56:40] don't answer to him we're not in
[1:56:41] relationship to him I don't answer to
[1:56:43] anybody else about my relationship with
[1:56:44] my wife
[1:56:45] right nobody in this church gets to come
[1:56:48] in and say now I now now if you're
[1:56:50] really in love with your wife then you
[1:56:51] ought to go buy her a new Mercedes-Benz
[1:56:54] as nice as that would be that has
[1:56:55] nothing to do with anything in our
[1:56:56] relationship and it wouldn't do anything
[1:56:58] for ours that's for sure now if I could
[1:57:00] buy her a greenhouse that would do it
[1:57:03] but that's the thing Satan didn't tell
[1:57:04] me to buy a Mercedes and she'd say why
[1:57:05] didn't you buy me the greenhouse because
[1:57:07] I listened to Satan's honey right don't
[1:57:09] listen to Satan when he's trying to give
[1:57:10] you relationship advice because he tried
[1:57:12] to mess Jesus up and he does the same
[1:57:13] thing to us brother bam says the same
[1:57:15] old devil lives today go down here and
[1:57:18] heal that old man so and so on the
[1:57:19] corner go over here to so-and-so and
[1:57:21] heal them listen I can tell you as a as
[1:57:23] a minister don't think that he doesn't
[1:57:25] come with those sorts of thoughts but
[1:57:26] he'll change it to whatever it is that
[1:57:28] you think you ought to be doing
[1:57:30] because sometimes we think we ought to
[1:57:32] be doing certain things
[1:57:34] right we ought to have Victory we ought
[1:57:36] to have more grace we got to be this we
[1:57:38] got to be that we ought to be doing this
[1:57:39] we got to be spending our time no no
[1:57:41] that's not up to Satan to tell you what
[1:57:43] to do that's up for God through the word
[1:57:45] to tell you what to do he says we don't
[1:57:47] take orders from the devil Jesus said I
[1:57:50] can do nothing until the father shows me
[1:57:51] first what to do for he worketh and I
[1:57:54] work with hithers too and he's the same
[1:57:56] yesterday today and forever so you hear
[1:57:58] anybody say anything like that walk away
[1:58:00] it's the devil we don't take orders from
[1:58:02] Satan we just come from above when he
[1:58:06] shows us what to do then we go do it he
[1:58:09] says if he wants Mr Jones on the corner
[1:58:10] healed he will tell his servant and he
[1:58:13] will go over and heal him that's right
[1:58:15] just by his orders and we see that when
[1:58:17] when Peter and John went to the temple
[1:58:19] right they're going through the gay
[1:58:21] beautiful and that man sitting there and
[1:58:23] he says he asked for alms and he says
[1:58:24] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:58:26] I had give I Thee in the name of Jesus
[1:58:28] Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk what
[1:58:31] was it he was told what to do
[1:58:34] why because that's the way it was with
[1:58:36] Christ Christ didn't just go around
[1:58:38] willy-nilly healing people he healed the
[1:58:40] ones that he was told to heal and that's
[1:58:41] all the very same thing that happened
[1:58:42] there it wasn't Satan going around well
[1:58:44] saying well Peter you ought to have
[1:58:45] power now you got the keys to the
[1:58:47] kingdom you should be able to heal this
[1:58:48] guy no it was the unction of the holy
[1:58:49] spirit said go to that man and heal him
[1:58:51] and that's what he did that man didn't
[1:58:53] even have to have faith
[1:58:54] he had to have faith to actually try and
[1:58:56] stand up I guess that's about it but it
[1:58:58] was what the authority that Peter and
[1:58:59] John were given that made that man stand
[1:59:01] up that was God's saying go do it and
[1:59:03] they did it
[1:59:04] but guess what like brother Brandon
[1:59:06] pointed out Jesus went to the pool Salon
[1:59:08] maybe hundreds maybe thousands of people
[1:59:09] there and he healed one you know what
[1:59:11] Satan would say why don't you heal them
[1:59:13] all if you can heal one why don't you
[1:59:15] heal them all
[1:59:16] because it's the Lord's will that want
[1:59:17] that one be healed and that was it yeah
[1:59:19] that's all there was to it amen
[1:59:21] we've been talking about this idea of
[1:59:23] speak the word and you know what Satan
[1:59:24] will do
[1:59:25] he'll put something up in your life and
[1:59:27] then he'll say speak the word to take it
[1:59:28] out
[1:59:29] guess what scripture doesn't say we get
[1:59:31] to take out things from our life
[1:59:34] says that he will do it according to his
[1:59:37] will but we don't go around and this is
[1:59:39] this is the the prosperity doctrine that
[1:59:41] you see in the world and what do they
[1:59:43] say they say speak the word
[1:59:45] say what the Bible says that you're
[1:59:46] going to be blessed and you're going to
[1:59:47] be this and you're going to be that and
[1:59:49] they got the people believing that the
[1:59:50] ease of life is the blessing of God
[1:59:52] not knowing that it's the correction of
[1:59:54] God and that God is working to get us to
[1:59:56] a place and that comes through trials
[1:59:58] and temptations that he's working us
[1:59:59] through his program to get us to a place
[2:00:01] of maturity and all they're doing is
[2:00:03] speaking out of their lives or trying to
[2:00:05] speaking out everything that God has
[2:00:06] placed in there to grow them into a son
[2:00:08] or a daughter of God Amen
[2:00:10] what is it what's the antidote to this
[2:00:12] spending time with Christ
[2:00:14] that's it you got to spend time with him
[2:00:16] and it's not just reading your Bible you
[2:00:19] got to be praying you got to be talking
[2:00:20] to him you've got to be able to give him
[2:00:22] a chance to step into your life and do
[2:00:24] these things amen the anti-adult to
[2:00:26] Satan is always going to be Christ
[2:00:28] the person of Christ
[2:00:30] amen
[2:00:31] if we're acting on discontent fear
[2:00:33] disappointment hurt feelings that's
[2:00:35] never going to be the inspiration of the
[2:00:36] holy spirit because that's not what
[2:00:38] moves God
[2:00:39] his word doesn't say if you're
[2:00:40] disappointed then speak it out of your
[2:00:42] life
[2:00:42] has nothing to do with it then you've
[2:00:44] got to find his will and you've got to
[2:00:46] find his purpose acting out of emotion
[2:00:47] or pity isn't why we do things either
[2:00:49] because at the police alone again pity
[2:00:51] would have said Jesus would walk around
[2:00:53] and heal every single woman was there
[2:00:54] maybe there were others that were in a
[2:00:56] worse condition and have been there
[2:00:57] longer we don't know but he only healed
[2:00:59] the one why because he was in a
[2:01:01] relationship where he wouldn't move
[2:01:02] until God told him what to do amen God
[2:01:06] never promised us a bed of ease quite
[2:01:08] the contrary
[2:01:09] quite the contrary right we're going to
[2:01:11] suffer persecution all of us will suffer
[2:01:13] persecution we're all going to see
[2:01:14] difficulties you look I just finished
[2:01:16] reading through the book of Acts again
[2:01:17] and I'll tell you they had a rough life
[2:01:20] they had a rough life you want to write
[2:01:22] a second book of Acts get ready for that
[2:01:24] they're not going to take our lives but
[2:01:26] I guarantee you before this is over
[2:01:27] they're going to take just about
[2:01:28] everything else in some form or fashion
[2:01:29] we're going to lose our jobs at times
[2:01:31] we're going to lose our finances we're
[2:01:32] gonna we're gonna face a lot of
[2:01:34] difficulties and we already are we see
[2:01:36] what's happened to different message
[2:01:37] ministers that have been put on the news
[2:01:39] and and and they've been tattled on and
[2:01:41] this and that and the other thing and
[2:01:42] what happens is they go and they get
[2:01:44] eviscerated guess what it's coming to
[2:01:46] the place where they'll go and they'll
[2:01:47] take what they have
[2:01:48] right why because we're going to suffer
[2:01:51] persecution it's not just going to be
[2:01:53] harsh words
[2:01:54] it's going to be worse and it's going to
[2:01:55] get worse and that'll make us really
[2:01:56] want to get out of here I mean that's
[2:01:58] really going to cut the ties when we
[2:01:59] start to feel some of those pressures I
[2:02:01] think amen
[2:02:03] but what did he do he didn't promise us
[2:02:04] a bit of ease but he said my grace is
[2:02:06] sufficient for thee it says I'll not
[2:02:08] leave you or forsake it to the end of
[2:02:10] the age he says I'll work everything for
[2:02:12] your good
[2:02:13] even the tough stuff
[2:02:15] even when it looks so dark it looks so
[2:02:17] Bleak when it seems like nothing's
[2:02:18] happening he says I'm still going to
[2:02:19] work it out for your good amen speak the
[2:02:23] word church
[2:02:24] doesn't mean go around just quoting
[2:02:25] scripture it means you get in his
[2:02:27] presence
[2:02:29] and you catch the inspiration of the
[2:02:30] holy spirit for your life for your
[2:02:32] situation in his time and then you go
[2:02:35] out and you confess and you say Lord
[2:02:36] that's what I believe is going to happen
[2:02:38] that's what speak the word means to us
[2:02:40] is to be in relationship with him to
[2:02:42] such a point that he can let us know
[2:02:44] what he wants us to do and
[2:02:46] amen God bless you let's Stand Together
[2:02:48] listen we get a connection with Christ
[2:02:50] that's like that that's when we can have
[2:02:52] confidence what we ask in his name he's
[2:02:53] going to do because we have his name
[2:02:55] amen we're tied to him we've got the
[2:02:57] marriage certificate we've got the Seal
[2:02:59] of the holy spirit in our lives and so
[2:03:01] we know that he's going to do it because
[2:03:02] it's him that's influenced us to say it
[2:03:04] in the first place amen let's bow our
[2:03:06] heads together
[2:03:07] Heavenly Father
[2:03:11] Lord certainly we need to come to a
[2:03:13] higher place and Lord I speak for myself
[2:03:15] if only for myself today Lord to say
[2:03:18] that we need to come to a higher place
[2:03:20] Lord we need to cut so many strings I
[2:03:22] feel
[2:03:23] Lord we need to be more committed
[2:03:26] Lord we need to be more Sanctified and
[2:03:28] Lord that's not going to make us better
[2:03:30] people Lord but it gives you an
[2:03:31] opportunity to step in and fill us with
[2:03:33] something that's so much greater than
[2:03:34] what we have right now
[2:03:36] Lord I'm praying that even as we bow our
[2:03:38] heads this evening Lord that our hearts
[2:03:40] would open up our lives would open up
[2:03:43] Lord that the the darkest areas of Our
[2:03:45] Lives Lord the disappointments the hurt
[2:03:47] the pain or the confusion Lord whatever
[2:03:50] it might be that's holding us back lord
[2:03:52] lord if there's strings of the world
[2:03:54] that are tied to us Lord if it's if it's
[2:03:56] past relationships Lord whatever it
[2:03:58] might be Lord may we cut those things
[2:04:00] tonight may we just Place ourselves Lord
[2:04:02] as we read earlier Lord may we throw
[2:04:05] ourselves completely Into You Lord to
[2:04:07] let you sort these things out May our
[2:04:09] faith solely rest Lord on the word of
[2:04:11] God lord and may we seek to find
[2:04:13] ourselves in it day in and day out we
[2:04:15] pray Lord just minister to us now we
