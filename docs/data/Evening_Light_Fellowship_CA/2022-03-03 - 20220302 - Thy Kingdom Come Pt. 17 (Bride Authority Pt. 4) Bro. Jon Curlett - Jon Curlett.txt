the service lord bless the people we pray in jesus name we ask it amen and amen i mean god bless you thank you musicians that'll be it if you'll turn in the scriptures matt i may have sent you the wrong one it's uh i might have sent you the wrong one i might have to send that to you real quick give me a second there we go yep should be first timothy 2 would be our opening scripture there we go wonderful praise the lord all right first timothy 2 god bless you amen i hadn't heard about brother gerald till just now so we definitely want to keep him in our minds amen at no age is it good to fall and strike your head but especially as you get older things get more brittle and and whatnot so we're just trusting god's grace to be with him amen 1st timothy 2. sister elsa had a wonderful question for me last service and this is where we answer it so it's good to hear the young people listening you know it's that's pretty young to be asking him a question of the minister because she thought she caught me in in a bit of a trap because i said one thing and she said but what about this and so i said if you'll come to church next wednesday we'll give you the answer so that's what we're going to do this evening amen god bless you first timothy 2 11 it says let the woman learn in silence with all subjection not just be in silence but to learn in silence there's a purpose in the silence but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression amen god bless his word you may be seated this evening amen we want to continue with the fourth part of this series i'm on the kingdom um bride authority in the thy kingdom come series and this will be the last one that i i speak on authority by god's grace as far as i know but uh we just want to close this out and last not last service but the last service of this topic we were talking about knowing your position and knowing the boundaries of your position and that there's there's power and there's authority as long as you stay within the boundaries that god has laid out for you amen and we know that there are things that god told men to do and there are things that god told men not to do and there are things that he told women to do and there's things that he told women not to do and there's many things that are not you're not supposed to or you shouldn't but they are hard cut clear do not do them amen and we see one of those things today is certainly the way our women dress amen and the way the men dress and the scripture is very clear on that it says a woman's not supposed to wear garments that pertain to a man but says a man's also not supposed to wear the garments that pertain to a woman and it's an abomination in god's sight and guess what god never changes right so we don't come into this age and we say well it's acceptable now to do it therefore it's not an abomination it's an abomination because god said not to do it not because society said not to do it at that time so with with men and women alike there are things that you cannot do and be in the will of god they just because of your gender in the scripture there are things we're not allowed to do and then there are things that we're supposed to do and we want to make sure that we don't step into those areas where he says don't do it because you're never in god's will to be outside of his word amen when he says don't do it we don't do it and we know for the sisters there was two things that they were not supposed to do that were major ones and this is uh paul of course taking this into the new testament church because as soon as we cross from from law into grace there's this tendency to start pushing away all of the things that you used to do right well it's a new it's a new covenant covenant we're in a new place he says there's neither male nor female bond or free you know june or greek none of these things so all of this has gone away and paul comes back and says no no no we're still in sin even though we're under the blood even though we have the the spirit of christ in us yet there are still positions and places for men and women to hold inside the body and we've got to make sure we don't cross that over amen no matter what we're under amen so we saw the first thing that they were not supposed to do was teach and that word teaches meaning to what handle the word of god in an instructive manner now that's meaning formally and informally but the big focus is on the formal side of things so they're not supposed to sit down and teach a class where they are handling the word they're not supposed to get up on the platform they're not supposed to get behind a pulpit they're not supposed to go any of these places and teach amen as we read in second timothy 2 11 it says let the women learn in silence not just be in silence but they're to learn and they're supposed to stay quiet even with what they learn until they come to a place where they are given authority to speak now a woman is never given authority to speak behind the pulpit she's forbidden to do that but she's given authority to speak in other areas and places and ways as the ministry or as the elders of the church or as the brothers of the church or as her husband or her father depending on her age and marital status would give her but there are things she's never allowed to do and one of those is that a woman's never allowed to preach in the church it's absolutely forbidden to her right brother brahm says the reason why is because she persuaded adam out of the will of god and caused him to do something that he should not have done and by it caused death to the whole human race that's why the bible forbids her to teach or to preach or to handle god's word in any manner he says and if all this wasn't bad enough a whole lot of you he's speaking to women took the idea that you could invade the pulpits and the church offices that god reserved for men and men only he says oh i touched a sore spot then didn't i because he's what he's preaching in a place where you have women preachers you have women missionaries you had all these different things going on and they're sitting there and he's trying to get them back in alignment with the word the opening of the word was to get us in alignment with the word not to give us a head full of ideas and swell us up with the egotistical idea that we know everything and we have a great revelation but it was to restore us back to a life that could be lived by the word right because that would have been lost through all those years is they could no longer live the word because the word had been so polluted by the ministries of men and by denominations in these things he says well show me a pla one place in the bible where god ever ordained any woman to preach or take authority over a man and i will apologize for what i've said you can't find that i'm wrong i'm right for i stand with the word and in the word he says if you were spiritually rich you would know that is true that's a hard statement to say he says if you're spiritually rich you know that's true that is nothing true but the word paul said i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the men you can't possibly take a place amongst the fivefold ministry of ephesians 4 and not take authority over men sister you better listen to that word it was not the spirit of god manifesting in a spirit-filled life that told you to preach because the spirit and the word are one now he's pointing to five full ministries so it was not the the spirit of god manifesting in a spirit-filled life that told you to preach teach evangelize do missions work any of those things right fivefold ministry is exclusively for the men now you can support you can be in support right i am an assistant pastor i'm a minister my wife supports me in that role and she supports me very greatly but she never gets up here and speaks right it's a it's a more silent role critical but it's a silent role she's not in a speaking role she's in a living and supporting role he says they say the same thing so therefore somebody made a mistake somebody was fooled wake up before it's too late satan fooled eve your mother and he is fooling the daughters now he says may god help you so he he leaves no doubt there as to whether a woman can get up into a pulpit and preach teach evangelize go out in the world but the thing is as soon as they they say well i'm not in the pulpit then they start to think that they can do it but he says no no no you're taking a five-fold ministries position when you go out and preach teach evangelize or any one of these things you're not supposed to do it that is supposed to be for the men alone but a sister elsa asked me she said well your wife was on the plane and that man sat next to her and she told him the word of god isn't that wrong based on what you're saying and i said no no a woman is absolutely allowed to testify of what god has done she's allowed to give a testimony she's allowed to point to the scriptures if somebody comes to her and asks then she can answer but you'll notice my wife did not go up to him and say have you met the lord jesus christ have you accepted him as your savior did you know god sent a prophet malachi 4 and this agent did you know that the godhead is do you know what that means and have you heard of serpency she didn't do that did she he asked a question she responded to it and our sisters have that opportunity they can respond to a question that's been given to them amen but that doesn't mean again you answer that question you go out into a big forum and do it you answer one on one that's what you're supposed to do you're not supposed to go out to the world and answer the question you go answer the person that asked the question amen it's a one-on-one ministry for women if we wanted to put it that way it's not meant to be a group thing it's not meant to be a big thing it's supposed to be small specific and personal that's really what they're meant to be amen the second thing is brother brandon mentioned here she is not to usurp authority that means they're forbidden to take control over to direct or otherwise be the boss of men so they can't take that they can't take it but they can be given it and we're going to go into the scriptures tonight to see where they are given authority and you will literally see women bossing men around in the scripture with full scriptural authority with the full authority of god with the full authority of the prophet of the age or whatever it might be but they have to be given it they cannot presume to take it and that's the thing is that so often you think well i'm just going to do this so i'm just going to do that no you have to be given authority to do it and you have to be given authority by the headship that has authority over that in the first place because sometimes what you do is you'll go find a brother you'll go find somebody and say can i do this and they say yes and they have no authority over what you're talking about you've got to go to the authority over that and say can i do it and that authority is not god god has put men in those positions to guard those positions in those places and so only that man is supposed to give it to you because otherwise what you'll get is men doing exactly what brother brown said well god told me to do it the holy spirit told me to do it listen if you're bypassing the authority that god has put in place then god can't god can't be doing saying two things at one time one of you is wrong and brother brahm says sister somebody's made a mistake somebody was fooled satan fooled your mother eve and he's fooling her you his daughters now i mean that's hard to say that's hard to say but we're seeing especially in this age of social media where we're seeing sisters get into that place and they're literally stepping into a five-fold ministry position without realizing it why because satan has fooled them and they think that god's telling them to do it and it's satan every single time because they have no authority to speak to an open audience like that it is supposed to be specific one-on-one and in response to a request not in a ministry an outward ministry like that brother bram says this he says on over in second timothy the third chapter he said i suffer not a woman to teach her to usurp authority over man but to be in silence you see and it isn't right for the women to preach that's true now i know i've seen some women that were real preachers listen to this real preachers they could preach too like amy mcpherson and many of those women there now if you stop there you get in trouble he says but put your hand on them just for a little what's he saying he's saying still them for a moment see how they respond he said i know people could speak with tongues this morning sitting right in this church if that but if there is no interpreter there dare not do so see you got to remember them women was born under a certain line your birth has a lot to do with it it's your name it's all about you you see you have a makeup to it no matter what it is so he says these things follow families often times or bloodlines or ministries follow through the father and the daughter can get a taste of that and she thinks that she's called to minister because why there's a gift sitting there and he says listen there's people in this church could stand up right now and speak in tongues because they have a gift but because they keep the gift in order he says they dare not do it unless there was an interpreter here right the gift is there but they're only supposed to use it in a certain way and at a certain time listen this this was an interesting thing he says i could get out here and pull a trigger on a gun and kill a man this morning but i dare not do it i was talking to a brother in this church one time and he was down the states and of course in the states you know everybody's got a gun you know he was talking to a brother and the brother said sure if any man came after my my wife my kids i'd shoot him dead he's prepared he's he's got a nature and he's got a willingness to commit violence for the sake of his family even to the point of taking a man's life now some of us can't do that and some of us can and brother braham says i'm one of those guys that could take a man's life if i had to that's the prophet of god that's malachi 4 telling you i could have no problem killing a man today amen he says but i dare not do it why because he's not supposed to do it the ability to do it the there's men that are gifted in killing you see it in wars you see these men you see alvin york didn't want to kill but when killing had to be done who got it done alvin york and you see these men that did great feats of they were by nature quiet unassuming men in many cases but the minute that bravery was called for the the minute that violence was called for to right or wrong what did they do they stepped into violence willingly and they committed acts of great violence and they committed death on people because the situation warranted it they had an ability to step into that and then step right back out and move on with life so brother i'm saying he says i have the ability to kill a person and not sit there and worry about it too much it ran in his life and we remember you see when he tells his testimony how many times did he try and kill somebody right he was going to kill that's what he's saying is i have that ability in my carnal flesh i have the ability to do something he says but i dare not do it he says but i can do it all right sure he says i could kill a man the same as you could kill a squirrel but you ain't supposed to do that see that's the same thing you've got to watch those things now that you do not he says this is the commandments of the lord so so often the the struggle is that we're capable we're capable of doing this and you'll see this in families guess what chances are if the father is a speaker then everyone else there's going to be a couple in the family that are going to be good speakers as well but that doesn't make you a preacher whether you're a man and especially if you're not a woman the ability to speak is not what makes you a preacher you know what makes you a preacher what makes you a creature a preacher is the ability to catch the thought of god and bring it to the people and set everything else aside right it's to catch the thought of god and leave yourself out of it that's what makes you a preacher it is not the ability to speak well it is not the the ability to rightly divide the word is not the ability to memorize scripture it's not the ability to get up and inspire it is to take the word of god to catch it and take it to the people that's all that's all a a real preacher is as he can catch the mind of god set himself aside enough that god could speak and he could bring it to the people that's what makes him it's not the greatest speaker our prophet was not a great speaker looking on him carnally you know you compare him to somebody like barack obama perhaps the greatest speaker of the modern presidency in the last five or 10 or 20 years right barack obama could certainly preach a sermon but he couldn't preach a sermon could he why no inspiration he couldn't catch the mind of god but he could deliver a great sermon i guarantee you if he put his mind and his gift to it right brother brown says just because you think you have a capability does not make you somebody that's supposed to be in that position any more than having a hockey stick makes you a great hockey player right having the tool doesn't make you there right doesn't make you wayne gretzky just because you got wayne gretzky's stick right wayne gretzky was wayne gretzky and there's never going to be another one like him right so these sisters they can't teach which is preach which is step into a five-fold ministry position and they can't usurp authority over men now those are two massive massive barriers in our sisters lives that's a tough thing to say to a sister that you can't do that because in this world they're screaming the exact opposite of that day in and day out day in and day out but remember it has nothing to do with capability sisters maybe that's a something that that can help you is it has nothing to do with whether or not you're good or bad at something but that's a comfort because you're going to be asked to do things you're not good at and you're going to be asked to do things you are good at right nuts brothers are the same it's not all fun and games being in the position of total responsibility is it brothers there's times where we probably wish we could sit back and let somebody else make the hard decision take the fall if the decision's wrong carry the burden shoulder that burden instead of us but we have to do it because the scripture tells us to do it not because we're always feeling capable or we always know the right thing to do right we've got to be willing to take the fall and trust romans 8 28 that he'll work it out for our good even when we mess up right so our sisters have to have grace because they're working with fallen men just as we're working with fallen women and so we're both trying to work together to come out to a godly response and all of these things amen amen so what brother branham has said here and what the scripture says scripture says is for a woman formally informally it doesn't matter when you start to handle the word of god then you're off the word in an instructive manner that's the that's the the big line that we've got to put them there and if we take it to revelations it shows the end result of a woman that does that and this is revelation 2 20 it says notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that means you allow you permit you don't restrain and you let them alone because you suffer that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess she calls herself a prophetess didn't say she was says she calls herself one you let her get away with it she's off the word and says what did she do with it you allow her to teach now that's the exact same word that paul used there that we read in timothy to say that women aren't allowed to do it he says you've let her do what i told you not to do he says and she's doing what she's going to teach and to seduce so she's going to deceive she's going to lead astray she's going to cause you to wander she's going to lead you away from the right that's what that's word seduce means so to seduce my servants to commit fornication that's both physical and natural evidence of the natural sin remember of the first sin what did eve do it was spiritual sin first and it was physical sin next right it was unbelief that was followed by a physical manifestation of that very thing so this is the end result as i've said before this is the end result of eve's ministry if she wasn't put in subjection because satan took what a church denomination a woman and he brought her all the way to this and this is what that ministry looks like this is a woman's ministry taken to its full fruition it says causes my servants and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols that's spiritual fornication right where you what get off the word of god for the sake of what makes you feel good for the thing that makes sense to you for the thing that is bringing you ease of life whatever these different things but the thing is he says she calls herself a prophetess but there is a prophetess in scripture there's more than one amen it's not that you can't be a woman and be a prophetess but it was what this woman did as a prophetess that took her into trouble because you can be a prophetess in the scripture we're going to talk about a couple of them brother brahm says this now then the circumcision of the old testament was in the flesh but in this new testament joel said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy now the word prophesy does not mean to teach so he's saying this is not in contradiction to what paul has told us in timothy that prophesy means to either tell an experience under inspiration or foretell something that's fixing to take place and we know there were prophetesses in the old testament they never could speak out in the building speak out in the church in the congregation as a teacher but she anna and many of them in the temple they were prophetesses and miriam was a prophetess or something like that listen to this she had the spirit on her that's true but she had her limitations of place women can be prophetesses today absolutely but not teachers and so forth behind the platform so he's absolutely same five full ministry that's men only you do he says you make the bible contradict itself the bible can say one thing here and another thing over here it's got to say the same thing all the time or it isn't the word of god see your sons and daughters shall prophesy means they shall either foretell or testify he says now you look that up and you get the bible dictionary and see if that isn't right so the scripture doesn't forbid a woman to be spiritual praise the lord right this is this is where that there's neither bond or greek male or female junior or you know bond or free june or greek and these things it doesn't forbid women to be spiritual and we'll get into what brother branham says here about women they are often more spiritual right men put on our humble hats this evening they are oft times more spiritual the problem is that sensitivity to spirituality means that they are sensitive to any kind of spirit not just the holy spirit so if they're under the influence of the holy spirit oftentimes they can lead in understanding and feeling what's going on but that they've got to be careful because they can be fooled the other way just as easily as eve was amen but what women are absolutely allowed to have all of the gifts as in the gifts of the spirit right they are allowed to use those gifts within the tabernacle within the church within the congregation but as with men they have to be proven right they don't just get to get up and start doing things remember brother branham talked about every time he'd go to finish a service and he'd go to call the people up this woman kept standing up and she was speaking in tongues right and he says you watched her and he said you'd watch her and she'd start getting her clothes ready and everything like that he says what was it that wasn't the holy spirit that was a gift but she wasn't keeping it subject to the order of the word and he says she went to get up and he said sit down i think he said he might have even said shut up he said sit down and shut up why because she was getting out of the order of the service she had a gift he never disputed that but he says you've been taught wrong and you think that you just to get up and do that and you're interfering with the movie the holy spirit he said she did it for service after service after service until he had to intervene and say you're out of order sister but she had a gift right and they saw this hey this is not exclusive to women how many times did men get up and they get up and they prophesy in the middle of a church service or something brother brown says you're not supposed to interrupt the going forth of the word right so all of those gifts have to be subject but they are absolutely available to anyone in the church male or female women are supposed to be spiritual you're a member of the bride of christ we're all supposed to be spiritual it's not exclusive to men and i think sometimes we've forgotten that in the message is that women are supposed to be as spiritual as the men just in a different way and in a different position but they're supposed to be spiritual because why we're all going in a rapture right that sister sitting next to you is supposed to be just as spiritual as you are supposed to have the holy ghost the same as you are supposed to be led by the holy spirit same as you are so we don't want to limit them in those things right but here's the thing they have to be proven and the proving of that is when they do what they don't use that gift for themselves that's what that sister was doing in brother graham's meeting where she was making a show of herself she was getting her clothes ready she wanted to look perfect she wanted to stand up and put on a show it wasn't for the sake of the people it was for the sake of her so what is it a person doesn't use their gifts to promote themselves but what do they do they humbly present themselves to god and then god inspires the use of that gift in their life for the benefit of the body not for the benefit of themselves look at jesus when did jesus ever use his gift for himself he didn't he used it for somebody else every single time brother branham how many times was brother branham sick did brother brown lay hands on himself did brother brown declare himself to be healed did brother brown claim the gift of faith and say i'm healed he had to go through that battle the same as everybody else did because it was for us not for him amen same thing now brother brahm says this he's talking about women being spiritually he says anyhow women is real receptive to spirits have you ever noticed in the service a lot of times who goes off first the sisters right they'll start worshiping they'll start crying they'll start shouting they'll start shrieking they'll start yelling they'll stop praising the lord speaking in tongues even a lot of times who is at first it's the women because it says there he says they're real receptive to spirits plural that's the flip side any spirit not just the holy spirit he says and then if you don't watch he says watch who the mediums are on the street it's madame so-and-so see you know you get these women with a familiar spirit or the you know fortune tellers and these different things he says but then the gospel should keep the women lined up and in her place see so then she's but she's more receptive to the spirit many times than men are and if you look in the scripture how many times do you see women catching something when the men are completely oblivious to it right how many times do you see jesus coming to a woman out of out of what we would consider her place going to a woman that's of ill repute and these different things and knowing that they were going to catch who he was that's why god sends them to those that's why he was led to those women was because they would catch it amen you look at mary of bethesda she was the one caught in adultery with the men they picked on her they let the man go right makes me wonder if they didn't know the man you know we don't know the scripture side i really want to ask that one when we get over to heaven lord what two things who is the man as in was he somebody that was known or did they let him go because they didn't want to you know get him in trouble and two what did you write in the stock right in the in the dirt there because whatever it is he wrote and then he said let he that's without sin cast the first stone whatever it was caused the oldest to the youngest to turn away and not throw a thing but maria bethesda she should have been stoned and she recognized not only who he was but she recognized where he was going which was to his death and she anointed his feet and meanwhile peter the one that has the great revelation is saying lord forbid this have ever happened and jesus says get thee behind me satan that's right a a prostitute if we want to call that have more spiritual discernment than peter the man that's going to speak on the day of pentecost right the woman with the issue of blood walks up and all she says in her mind is if i can but touch him i'll be made whole she touches him and she walks away and he stops and says virtue's gone out of me how many men touched him that day how many people touched him that day but it was a woman that came up and touched him that's right she knew who he was she believed on it and she acted on it amen what do we have the woman at the well this is a woman of ill fame five husbands the sixth man she's living with is not her own husband she comes to the well he talks to a woman that is a samaritan first shouldn't have even been talking to her by cultural standards and then two she's an outcast woman two strikes against her and he talks to her and in a short conversation she catches what the priests and pharisees call the devil was actually the messiah why she was receptive to the holy spirit there was something there that resonated in her and she caught it when a man that has studied the scriptures like caiaphas would stand there and call him a blasphemer because he couldn't recognize who he was look at anna the prophetess okay here's a woman that's a prophetess by inspiration she catches who this baby is he's not even doing anything he's laying in his blankets and his mama's arms going goo gaga and she says this is the messiah why she was sensitive to the moving of the holy spirit she was led to go there that day to see that baby and recognize that this is a messiah and it was a fulfillment of what the desire of her heart to see him an amazing thing right look at this syrophoenician woman needing healing for her daughter she goes up and what does he do he calls her a dog today's sisters today brothers i don't care what gender you are if you went up to somebody that you believe was spiritual and they called you a dog what would you do how many of us would respond the way she did but she knowing and believing who he was she humbled herself under his offensive comment and said yay lord because he said what she wanted healing he says it's not me to give the children's bread to the dogs called her a dog and she says yay lord but the dogs still eat the crumbs from off the table why she knew who she was talking to and she was willing to do whatever it took to get healing for her daughter and what did he do that very hour her daughter was healed amen why they were receptive to what the moving of the spirit they were receptive to the word of god amen but what those gifts and that deserving sisters doesn't pull you out from under scriptural headshit right and we've seen it and i've known women that have great spiritual gifts great insight great wisdom but it can't pull you out from the word authority that you're put under and that is your husband or your father right if it pulls you out then it's not the holy spirit doing it and it can't be amen no matter the gift you imagine i don't believe we have a prophetess in here at least not yet but if you ever get that spirit on you it does not allow you to step outside of the word it will always bring you to the word amen and it will never cause you to take authority to yourself that isn't given you amen now we're going to start walking through a couple of these and this is all for sister elsa these were my notes from from previous but sister elsa listen up closely this is for you amen so we're going to start with miriam a prophetess so this is proving that women can have spiritual gifts old testament and new right so if we look in exodus 15 it says then saying moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath try and triumph gloriously the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea now i want you to see who who started this worship this is not in the congregation they're standing on the on the banks of the red sea but who starts it the prophet of god moses starts it the people join in but then what happens miriam didn't jump up front and start the worship a man started it but what happens is miriam gets under the anointing of worship and all of a sudden what does she do it says and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances so brother bram says she got in the spirit right this isn't in the congregation she's not out of order they are literally outside and something happens and miriam says i gotta worship. brother brown puts it this way he says after the taskmasters had drowned moses got in the spirit that was to start it then miriam got in the spirit and miriam grabbed a tambourine and down the bank she went a beating this tambourine and dancing did you ever hear of such and down the banks she went beating the tambourine dancing and here come the daughters of israel following her dancing and moses got in the spirit and began to sing a song in the spirit brother he says if that's not an old-fashioned holy ghost meeting i've never seen one in my life but what it's in a proper place she's not leading the congregation out in the church she's leading them outside the church she's responding in spontaneous worship to an event that's happened there amen amen and it's what the spirit of worship on miriam and brother braham says that was the holy spirit falling on her that caused her to do that right she had to express it moses never forbade her and said hey you're a woman you're not allowed to do that what they all followed and all the women followed after her and they had a wonderful time on the banks of the red sea right but i want you to catch something here because it's an important lesson in headship because as far as we know miriam never married you'll see there that it said that it was miriam the sister of aaron it did not say the daughter of a man which means that the father and mother were probably dead at that point and she's never listed as having a husband and so i want you to catch something here because she lacked one of the scriptural boundaries or barriers that would have kept her from getting into trouble and that was a husband or a father that was still alive in numbers 12 it says emiriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman now notice who speaks out just miriam no her and aaron both speak out against the prophet of god and they said had the lord indeed spoken only by moses had not had he not spoken also by us and the lord heard it you never you see these things uh those of you that aren't on social media won't see it but you have these things that says only god can judge me this is what only god can judge me looks like here it says and the lord heard it amen what motivated their comments about his wife though it was that they had an inferiority complex or they were unhappy with how much god was using moses as compared to them or how much recognition moses got as opposed to them they spoke against moses and his wife but the root of it was they said didn't god doesn't god use us as well that was the root so they're saying one thing but the root is something completely different and they said aren't we the same as moses don't we have the same rights don't we have the same recognition and it's not true was it it says now mo the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth moses wrote that about himself under inspiration and the lord spake suddenly unto moses god dropped down boom moses we got something to deal with and under aaron and under miriam he said come out e3 into the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out now lotus he brings them into the church into the congregation for one thing and what is that judgment amen when we come to church it's a serious thing because it is brother brahm says it is grace if you receive it and it's judgment if you don't and he brings them in he says you've got to stand in the church for this because this is a church matter that we're dealing with right it's not a joke when we come into service is it we can't take anything that comes over the pulpit lightly it says and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth now here's the thing they said does not god speak through us now god's speaking to them that's a scary thing when god calls you in says now i'm going to speak to you but you're not going to like it so much. and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my moses my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches in the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses i cringe when i see what people say about ministry sometimes and again you see it mostly on social media but sometimes it's in conversation listen take a lesson from this you better watch out who you're talking to and who you're talking about because what the hope is that they won't respond right moses never called aaron and miriam and said hey i heard what you were talking about what is it god called them in and god dealt with them sometimes i think you'd be better off dealing with the men it's a scary thing amen but listen he says when i talk to moses you ever see even brother branham will say i'm seeing something and he'll say i don't know what it means remember how many times the brother himself have a dream or vision he'd say i'm not sure what it means i'm waiting for the lord to reveal it he says listen with moses that's how i deal with prophets he says with moses oh i'm different he says i speak mouth to mouth moses sees my mouth moving when i talk if we can put it that way he couldn't see the face he saw the similar tube but he said with moses there's no hidden things everything's obvious when i talk to him i make it very clear what i'm talking about moses doesn't have to wonder what i meant what i'm getting at where this is going when i'm done talking with him when i talk to moses everything is crystal clear and then he walks out and he gives you it why because moses was god to the people and he had to have clarity right he couldn't wonder about he had to get come out and speak as god to the people he says what this is a man that's different than any one of you you have gifts you have a gift of prophecy he says he's a prophet there's a difference between a gift of prophecy and a prophet he says he's a prophet i use you but he's in a position that you don't have anything close to amen right it says and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous while white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was met she was leprous why only miriam why wasn't aaron struck aaron said the same things as miriam why is miriam the one that's leprous and aaron said unto moses i'll ask my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned aaron admitted hey we both did this isn't this wasn't miriam only this was both of us don't put it all on her says let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now oh god i beseech thee moses wasn't offended that's a beautiful thing right as men if you're in the ministry that's a beautiful thing to respond somebody starts to tear you down somebody starts to criticize you something's probably going to happen to them at some point they're going to wish they hadn't said it and our attitude want to be ought to be like christ was on the cross right father forgive them they didn't recognize what they were doing moses could have gone for the throat goodness said sorry had enough of you you're just like the rest miriam go ahead and die no he says lord i beseech you heal her right lay not the sin upon it oh sorry and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days he said look what she did if she'd if her father had spit in her face she'd have been ashamed for seven days because of what he did to her and now she does the same thing to you he says she spit in your face is what she did he says therefore let her be shut out of the camp from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again and you know what after this we don't see anything from miriam god never as far as we know as recorded in the scripture we see very little from miriam and she dies not long after this why because she got out of her position she got out of her place and we'll cover it a bit where brother brahm says he says and when they come in before god god said don't you fear god said that to the high priest and the miriam the prophetess said if there be any a man among you who's spiritual or prophet i the lord will make myself known to him i'll speak to him in visions reveal myself in dreams to him and so forth if he's a spiritual or a prophet but he said my my servant moses i speak lip to ear with him said don't you fear god in other words you talk about moses you're talking about me why moses was in the god position amen right aaron was moses prophet moses wasn't the prophet aaron was the prophet moses was god to the people he says you're talking about me if you can't respect moses you don't respect me ouch she didn't realize that did she said haven't i proved among you that he's my servant and you have no reverence for him at all what that would be for a lesson of be a lesson for the people of this day no respects no honor now he said and because you didn't do that that's the reason you got leprosy that's the reason these things has went said because you ought to have known that this was my servant you do know it so when you say something against him you're saying it against me what he said the problem was he says you didn't show respect and you didn't show honor and that's what got you in trouble he says but what he was trying to get to them was this you've got to respect what i do and that was the attitude of god in that day and god can't change god wants us to respect what he's doing he demands it said you either respect that or something else is going to happen so ask the question why miriam but not aaron they both said it they both discussed it they both did something they shouldn't but guess what aaron was in a position of spiritual authority didn't give him a right to do what he did but he had authority to speak miriam had no authority to speak unless she was speaking as thus saith the lord what happened was in her mind miriam said i'm a prophetess therefore i have a right to speak and she forgot that she was only supposed to speak as god moved her to speak she didn't have thus saith the lord but in her mind she got it flipped around to where she said i'm allowed to speak as a man would and god judged only her for it aaron was wrong but god judged miriam for it that's a scary place right what was it she was linking her gift of her gift which was of god to her comments and her right to comment which was not of god right she's a prophetess god comes to her and dreams and visions and tells her to say and do things and she does it and so she linked that to what she was saying and god said no no you're not allowed to do that you can't tie me in with what you say here because i didn't tell you to do it right god put moses in that place moses didn't choose it moses didn't want it moses was put in there by god god gave moses his wife she was a hot-tempered woman wasn't she but she saved his bacon as well didn't she when they're on the road to moses and she said thou bloody husband do i have to do this she circumcised the boys because he hadn't done it the angel of the lord would have killed him right god had given him a wife that he needed to keep him out of trouble to help them to help them right and they criticize that god says you're not allowed to do it especially to my prophet you've got to pay a price now you say brother jonathan you're picking on the women let me tell you what the prophet said i don't have to i feel i don't have to defend it this is brother branham now speaking of his own wife because remember he said her issue was one of what respect and honor there was something come up he's speaking of his wife and she was so nervous she could hardly hold herself together people at the house all night long and like night before last evening at one o'clock in the morning here were people in around the house around the windows and everything so then she was real nervous and she said something to me snappy that she ought to have said it see she said then bill you're always gone and i have to take care of these children myself she said you're never here we can't make our decisions together you're either out or gone and she started crying went in and shut the door now let me stop right there has anything that she said there factually incorrect is it wrong in terms of the facts of life their marriage the raising of kids has is there anything there that she said that was incorrect no brother branham was constantly gone brother bonham didn't get to be a father and a husband the way most of us men do why because he was always out preaching he had a call to go and preach the entire world he he was supposed to go around the world seven times he had to bring a gift of healing and these different things to the whole world that was his primary focus and so his wife all the pressure builds up on her and she snaps out but nothing she said is factually wrong he wasn't there she was under a lot of stress she was raising the kids by herself all these different things now watch how the prophet responds just like moses right then i said oh poor little fellow i said my i ought and i started out so he was just fine he's she's right he said you know poor thing she's just so so tired and so worn out now listen what it says he says and it said what's that the holy spirit read numbers 12. he says um he says a different one there i replaced that that's why i put it in brackets because he references the wrong the wrong book and wrong thing but it's read numbers 12. it says it was when miriam rebuked moses for marrying an ethiopian girl be better that her father had spit in her face and do this and i went back in and i said sweetheart you said the wrong thing and she was crying she had a right to cry right he's not saying you're wrong honey that that the words you're saying are incorrect he says but you said the wrong thing honey god is going to make you pay for that you shouldn't have done that i'm all tore up myself you shouldn't have said that and she said well bill i get so tore up and i just turned and walked back because i know she wasn't in any mood to receive it so i went back out and the next examination about a month after that showed the tumor what was it she criticized what a man in his ministry and god judged her for it even though he was exactly what she said never there didn't get to make any decisions with them can you imagine sisters you're trying to go to sleep and you got people coming in a house walking around you know the shadow crossing over your window and you're you know how horrible would that be cars going in and out doors closing you know perhaps people crying in in the living room while your husband's praying with them and talking to them these different things right just tearing up your life but what was it she she was led there god god gave her to brother branham as a wife and what happened was for one moment she got selfish that's all and she forgot that she had to respect that man in his position and god judged her for it because he said that's my prophet and you don't talk to my prophet that way he didn't correct her he just said you shouldn't have said it the way you said it you shouldn't have done that right what is it she made it about herself and god judged her for it that's what that's what miriam did she made it about herself does god not also use me does god not also care about me and then she said something she ought not to second first corinthians 14 says let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience is also saith the law and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church listen to this what came the word of god out from you or came unto you only isn't this the very thing that miriam was just saying doesn't god speak to us as well brothers shouldn't we be allowed to stand up and and preach and teach and say these things in the church he says no sisters you're not to do that you're not supposed to step into that he said he didn't say god doesn't come to you but he says that has nothing to do with it because that's the thing that got miriam in trouble if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that are right unto you are the very commandments of the lord so paul ties the very attitude of miriam and aaron to the new testament church says women don't get under that and men don't do the same thing he says listen if you think you're spiritual then you better acknowledge me as the prophet of god and that what i say is true otherwise you have no standing in these churches because you're getting off the the inspired word amen and then he says what don't criticize because your gift isn't being used or because your gift is not yet apparent remember brother branham says you know that they had that ministers meeting and they were going to set a trap and they were going to they're going to try and get them on godhead i believe it was right and what did he say he says i told him he says if you can't if you what do you say he says if you can't help me then keep off my back right he says get off my back and let me do it if you're not gonna if you're not gonna stand up here and correct me and you can't correct me then get off my back and let me do the job that god called me to do that's right right what's he saying don't hold me back because you're jealous right get out of my way let me let me keep working and then you can do what you want to do when god starts using you right amen you don't want to start criticizing someone that's doing a work for god now let me stop there and say this sisters that doesn't mean you're not allowed to express frustration doesn't mean you're not allowed to say that you're unhappy it's not that you're not allowed to share these things with your husband right but there's a way to do it isn't there and us men guess what the first sign of trouble is usually with our wife because why she's a reflection of us and our life and the way we're living so when we see weakness when we see despair when we see difficulty in our wives then what is it it's because chances are we're out of our place something's not quite right in the home something's not quite right in the marriage something's not quite quite quite right in the family and she's the first one to reflect that so us men and this is something i had to learn uh especially is that you can't just tune that out if your wife is is is continuously in a difficult place it means there's a problem with the leadership in the home and you've got to take a real uh you know really look in and take inventory of where you're at and say lord what's going on here now listen if we listen to our wives and sit down long enough half the time they'll tell us what it really is but there's usually a root problem that they may not understand they're getting the effect of it but they may not know where that's at i remember my brother was telling me and there was a young lady in their church and she was having problems with promiscuity and and these different things in rebellion and the the the minister went to the house and as soon as he got in the house he realized and he took the father aside and he says how long have you been addicted to pornography and the man just looked at him because the problem with the daughter had nothing to do with the daughter and had everything to do with the headship in the house right and so it's the same thing with our wives a lot of times what are they remember women are very receptive to spirits so guess what if you're under the holy spirit in every aspect they're going to be receptive to that but if you're not they're going to catch that real quick and it'll manifest in them just as quick as you can imagine it right because why they're meant to they're a part of us right they're part of us and they're gonna they're gonna manifest that so if you see something in your wife you don't like change what you're doing because she's just reflecting what you're doing if you don't like your wife it's because of you not because of her and the sisters said amen right so what god's grace to you sisters because you're working with fallen men right to have grace and to keep that respect and honor when we trip up and it's not a case of if it's when it's when right and anybody that's been married for more than a week knows that right usually you're perfect for about the first week then after that you make a misstep right but what god help you to keep your attitudes right and then for us brothers what is it god help us to stay humble and gracious that we'd be able to sit and listen and change the way we're doing things amen so miriam was she's an inspiration she's an inspiration for worship and then what she's a lesson in staying in headship not letting that gift run ahead of you and get you into trouble but all the others we're going to talk about here tonight every single one of them stays in their position and they have a wonderful effect holder second kings 22 she was a prophetess it says so hilkiah the priest and the haikum and akbor and shafin and assahya went on to holder the prophetess the wife of shalom the son of tikvah the son of harass keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem at the college and they communed with her and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell the man that sent you to me. so the king had sent them he said he found the scrolls and he found things in there that were not voting well for israel he's like are we going to get judged on this so he says go ask holder the prophetess to give us a word from the lord so they go to a prophetess they go to a woman to get a word from the lord and what does hold us say now it says there that she was she was uh she was in the uh the college she dwelt in the in jerusalem in the college that's not a college like we talked about today that's the second quarter or the lower quarter that's just a place in the city okay this does not mean that she was you know studying with the priesthood or anything like that don't get that in your mind that's not what it was it's a geographical location it's not a place of study right but when she answers you notice what she says she doesn't say now i have studied those very same scrolls as a student of the scripture here is what's going to happen what does she say thus saith the lord tell the king this what god had given her a word and that's all she repeated and holder does not go and expand on it and add her opinion and never predict no no no she says thus saith the lord now notice she is the wife of a man so she's under headship her headship is listed she says thus saith the lord gives it and then walks away and she's done with it right she doesn't start a podcast right she doesn't start up a big social media campaign of this is what holder the prophet has to say for today she only speaks when the lord comes to her and says thus saith the lord and that's the only thing that she'll go with amen she has no spiritual authority she's not teaching all she is is a microphone and any gift of prophecy is just that i'm not talking about a position of prophet i'm talking about a gift of a prophet or prophecy all you are is a microphone and so when god's not speaking then what do you do shut up because what's the problem matt will tell you this anybody that's worked with electronics you know what the problem is with a microphone when it has electric noise inside of it when it's not built quite right a cheap one what it has is what it has a sensitivity to feedback it's not well shielded and so what do you do on a cheap microphone the closer you get to certain sources the more it squawks and make noises right so what a good microphone well shielded to be from outside influence including your own you only make a sound when god speaks for you and that's what she was amen she wasn't out there battling with the priest she wasn't out there duking it out with doctrine she wasn't out there teaching she wasn't out there holding services right she was silent unless she had thus saith the lord that look at deborah and deborah prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time so she's a prophetess she is a wife so she's still under headship and she's a judge and she dwelt no notice where she dwells she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between rama and bethel and mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment she's not in the temple she's not preaching she's not teaching she is a prophetess so she speaks thus saith the lord as the word of the lord comes to her and she's still in headship to her husband okay so she's under full spiritual authority as god has put it in her life amen and you notice she's not in the church she's also not in city hall where is she she's outside the city under a tree so if you want to talk to deborah does she come to you or do you come to her they come to her so a man could come to her and by coming to her and asking her what's he doing he's giving her authority to speak if he two men come to her or families or whatnot they would come to her and they give authority to her to judge by asking her to do it she is not presuming to do it she's not in a voted position or anything like this but rather that people come to her and by coming to her they give her authority to do what she's doing now again she doesn't have a podcast she doesn't have a regular newspaper that she sends out of this is what the judge deborah said no no as they come to her she deals with them one-on-one with their situations one-on-one and they're giving her authority to deal with it based on her reputation for being a prophetess for speaking the word of the lord and the wisdom that she shows in her judgment so she has earned a place of judgment she's earned a place of political authority that's what it is there and the prophet of god says this she's a gifted woman but she's a gifted woman still under headship and it's only when people give her authority that she would speak with authority brother brahm says to top it all off this man said a woman was a judge in the bible if that's not authority over man and this businessman that was healed right here in the church not long ago his wife said brother brown that always puzzled me i said why sister how would that puzzle you she said well here's a woman judge he says that's politics not the church that don't have nothing to do with the church paul said let them be under obedience is also saith allah she was under obedience she couldn't be out there doing it unless her husband allowed her right and the law can't put a woman up to be a priest can't put it up you've never seen a woman high priest you've never seen a woman a priest nowhere in the bible you've never seen a woman a preacher in the bible certainly some of them was prophetesses and so forth miriam and the different ones so brother brahm said politics is not a place for a woman in any regard because here he says she's in a place of political power but she's not in politics she wasn't voted in as judge she didn't have the popular vote she didn't put her name up for election she wasn't in the city she wasn't in the mayor's office or anything like that they came to her directly one-on-one brother brown says this he says a woman ain't got no no business in politics she's got no business over any authority in the church her place is a man's queen at home outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the church the truth i know that sounds old-fashioned but i'm responsible so it hasn't changed since brother brahm left the scene either so the ministry is responsible to say the same thing and i know that after my going away from this earth them tapes and then books will be living on and many of you young children will find in the days to come that this is exactly the truth because i speak it in the name of the lord what's he saying thus saith the lord amen we better listen now he says women have no place in politics what about men what about men in politics it's a big big conversation these days isn't it he says we can't look at democracy it was right but it's run it's lived its life kings lived their life and kingdoms and dictators and all have lived their day democracy was the best thing they had was he says but it's so polluted through politics it's rotten to the core no hopes on it at all you're just like trying to build on a charred city that's burnt to smolders you can't build it it's ruined and gone and it has to be that way it must come that way and the bible says it will be that way satan is the ruler of every nation every kingdom belongs to satan and he rules them according to his own way of ruling but did not he offer them to the son of god one day these are mine i do with them whatever i want to all the kingdoms of the world that's the reason they fight and kill a murder so if you think the conservatives are better than the liberals or vice versa you're wrong right if you think the republicans are better than the democrats or vice versa you're wrong why because satan is controlling them all you know the lie that believers have believed that any one of those parties is somehow good right they're all bad one might be less bad and make our lives a little easier because we're not so oppressed in what we believe it's more accepted but here's the thing satan is controlling all of them god allows it but it's satan that controls all of them so whether you're a republican or a democrat you're affiliated with satan's party whether you're an ndp liberal conservative people's party green party whatever they're all controlled by satan and as much as you might admire some of those politicians because there are some in there that seem to be decent people right we're not taking anything about it but the system is controlled by satan so you're not winning by voting in any one or the other right you think you picked the right guy because they aligned they say a couple things like two corinthians right trump gets up and he reads his bible he calls it two corinthians listen no no christian calls it two corinthians but what did he do he fooled a bunch of people into thinking it i got an email from a brother a good brother an older brother a man i love and respect and he was he was extolling the virtues this is a message believer extolling the virtues of donald trump and i sent him a number of these quotes and i haven't heard back from him since why because i told him it's all satan's kingdom and what did that mean it meant that he had to accept that he was extolling the virtues of satan's kingdom you can't do it there's not not a one of them good there's not a one of them good and it's a waste of our time listen what it is is we're trying to make our life here a little easier right we agree a little more with one side or the other so we say we'll get them in and that'll make life easier listen we're not getting out of here going in a rapture by making it easier on ourselves we've got to get very very very uncomfortable before we get our eyes off of this world and say you know what it really is enough enough it's time to go home right so politics is no place for us listen to this politics corrupted democrats republicans and all is low down what is it it's a bunch of graft every person works in it that's not born again is of the devil so if you're a christian a believer and you're working in there you're working with everyone there as of the devil why would you ever do it why would you ever do it he says the devil said every kingdom in the world belongs to me and jesus never debated with him the world is controlled by the devil and every man that works for the government if he ain't a christian he's of the devil and working for the devil these nations will all fall to jesus christ when he comes there will be a a millennium so line with them all you want waste your time with them get tied up in it you're just hooking yourself to satan's train everybody on the train is working for satan so why are you on the train would you go work in a in a whiskey factory i'm a christian why would you go work in a place that's dedicated to satan's satan's kingdom politics is no different right you get caught up in it you spend time in it i was talking to some of the brothers i i i don't listen to the news at all in the mornings and just some different things are going on i said i'm going to try and experiment on myself and for a week i listen to the news every morning going in while driving selena to work and you know what changed did the news change did the world change no you know who changed john cruz for the better nope i got frustrated angry right grumpy right a couple people were spoken out of existence on the road right why because i'm sitting there and i'm getting frustrated because i'm listening to them put a spin on things that i know not to be true and i know that there's more to it and they won't say that and so i'm saying there and all i'm doing is building up rage frustration disappointment guess what you can get fear and you're the same way you can get depression inside you the same way what is it that's one week of me listening to it and yet we can quote more about american politics sometimes than we can quote our bible right it ought not to be it's satan's kingdom it's a total and absolute waste of our time amen amen we've got enough in our life going on to not get tied into this sort of thing amen and if you dwell on it you feed on it you're just getting sucked into satan's vortex that's all it is satan's vortex right you're supposed to be reading the signs and saying it's going home time right that ought to be what's happening here is we got to be looking up and saying our redemption draws nigh that's that's what we ought to do when we hear them being so crazy in the news when we hear about these things going on guess what we've got gog and magog starting to move over in europe don't we right russia and china russia's made a move china's thinking about making a move they say yeah right what's it doing it's testing to see how the world will respond and guess what if they act like wimps guess what's going to happen gag and magog are going to start ratcheting it up aren't they because they're going to know they can put one over on the world and that's going to lead to what tribulation right this is a test this isn't it this is just a little push you know what we ought to be saying going home time right the bible tells us the prophet told us this what did he say was going to destroy wrong russia that's right what's going to give russia the confidence to do that doing something like this and then the next thing and then the next thing and all of a sudden brother brown says when they go down for what that oil right that energy whatever it might be right maybe he saw a pipeline i don't know what brother bram saw he said oil maybe he saw a pipeline maybe it's natural gas they're finding all sorts of things in israel did you know that not only that they control land that's key to getting some of that stuff out what is it we ought to be looking at this and not saying let's fix it let's take our country back let's take our province back let's take our rights back listen we don't have any rights we've lost them a long time ago they've got everything they need to shut this church down and anyone that remotely preaches the word of god in canada they call it hate speech that's right right so it's all there they're just waiting to implement it listen if the world can turn against russia in the drop of a hat you think they can't turn against believers they already have they just haven't acted on it the way they have with russia but if they're convinced that they're doing the right thing remember the scripture says they'll turn you into the authorities thinking what that they're doing god asserts that they're doing the right thing we ought to be saying this is time for us to be getting out of here amen amen if anything if you think a certain party is wrong vote them in because it'll make things worse faster and we'll get out of here a little quicker don't take that seriously right amen but we ought to we got to get uncomfortable and guess what i'm i'm still pretty comfortable in my life right i'm not comfortable with the world but guess what they haven't taken my job away they haven't frozen my bank accounts listen you think they can't do it to you you think they can they can't freeze your bank account just like they did rushes they can do that at the drop of hat look what they did to the convoy protesters at the drop of a hat they said it's wrong boom we're gonna take all of your assets we're gonna freeze it so you can't do what buy or sell right that's tribulation we'll get out before that but don't think that the squeeze isn't going to come down on us politically it's got to happen right so if they can do it to russia they can do it to a believer all day long amen they can do it to a convoy protester they can definitely do it to a believer right listen to this we've got phoebe romans 16. i commend them to you phoebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at sancria so that servant there means she's does what administrative functions she's handling errands that type of thing the the root of that word servant there means to kick up dust you know what that means she got stuff done she wasn't a she wasn't a talker she was a doer you know what we've all got people like that in our lives and our families in this church and what is it they don't talk very much but you want something done you know the brother or sister to go talk to don't you this is what phoebe was he says what i command that you receive her in the lord as become a saints and that you assist her in whatsoever business she had need of you for she had been a sakura of many and of myself also so in other words she's helped everybody in the church there where paul was including paul himself so he says when she comes to you she's acting in my name and my authority and i'm telling you to give her what she asks of you so this is a woman going to a church going to brothers ghost goes to the saints that are in the city and he says she has authority to come and ask you and whatever she asks of you you need to give it to her why for the benefiting of the church body he says she's a good person we trust her she's proven herself so when she comes give her whatever she asks for does that mean she can't ask the men no she gets to go ask the men guess what if she needs to set something up if she needs money if she needs help she needs muscle whatever it is she needs introductions he says whatever it is you need to give it to her because she's there to help the body amen don't constrain her give her whatever she asks for so she has lots of authority but it's been given to her now she walked in and all right guys this is what i want what did they have said who are you right i guarantee you phoebe was probably one of those ones that maybe she had a bit of a you know people that are due or sometimes they can be a bit brusque you know what because they get things done but when she walked in and that that prophet had said this is somebody that i've sent to help you out then she could ask and they would give it to her she's in her place she didn't take it it was given to her and in that she was able to do it tremendous work enough that paul acknowledges her in the scriptures there's a lot of women acknowledged in paul's ministries and we'll see that as we get into the next service lord willing that when they step into their place they can be a tremendous blessing not only to the church body but to the community and the families around right so i have these beautiful examples of women that play big roles in the scripture and yet they stay perfectly in headship that's the beauty of it is that there's lots available whether you're married whether you're single there's lots of things that women can do but you have to stay within the lines of headship that they were that are given to us amen they were able to receive that authority and not abuse it but use it for the kingdom of god that's what this whole series is about is will you do what the kingdom of god wants you to do with your body with your gifts with your life and these different things amen but what they didn't get there overnight phoebe didn't get that sort of authority and commendation from paul because she did something real good she did this time and time and time again deborah didn't get a a a reputation for being a a wise woman by just having one great uh you know court case or something like that but over time she developed what a trust and a and a respect with the people that allowed her to help them in a way that any other woman probably couldn't have right but there is a place where women have a special place to teach and that's with the children and that's with each other and that is not something that men give to them it's something that god gives to them it's a scriptural authority that's given to them your husband has no right to say you're not allowed to teach my kids you're not allowed to teach our kids those different things but rather the scripture gives them authority psalms 127 3 says lo children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward says my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother so the law mother's word is law of times we get daddy's word is law scripture says mother's word is law for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck so in the end this is jewelry around the mother's neck is when what the children respond to that law and the instruction of the father proverbs 22 6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it proverbs 23 hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she is old to the older sisters i say your job is not over it's never over until you leave this earth you are still there to help if they will receive it guide and instruct and advise you and give advice to your children scripture says don't do it when she's old keep listening because guess what she's ahead of you in the game you better listen it's to your benefit buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bear thee shall rejoice she does that and you receive it then she's going to be a happy mama deuteronomy 6 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when they'll walk us by the way and when they'll lie us down and when they'll rise and stop brothers and sisters alike when we rise up what are we telling our kids throughout the day when we're walking with them what are we telling them when we lay down what are we telling them scripture says we're supposed to what teach them all these things it says what and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes you know what frontlines are they used to call them blinders and on a horse what they do is they block everything in their peripheral vision so that all they were focused on was where the the person that was in control of them was guiding and was was pointing them so the horse couldn't see anything but what was right in front of him right that's what it's supposed to be for us is that god puts what says dismiss everything else just go where i point you and stay focused on that right amen and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates brother brown says this he says to you little mothers here this morning that's been real mothers and i know there's many of you i think every one of you let me tell you something god bless you you're the fifth gospel i think let me tell you what now for your children just a little thing remember when moses was a little boy it was a mother who gave him his instruction it was a godly mother who took little moses on her knees and said moses and taught him all she was his teacher rather under pharaoh and said now all these things said moses someday you're going to deliver the children of israel you're the boy that's called keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world for you're the one you're the one he says what that was mama why because daddy was out there in the mud pits all day wasn't he so mama was the one sitting at home teaching him he says no other place do we know wherever went to any seminary any teaching at all he ever got he stayed right in pharaoh's palace which was a heathen but his mother taught him that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the lord she told him how he must be holy she told him how and what he must live and how what ma what god must do and would do for him and it stuck with moses all the days of his life and any good true loyal mother that'll take her little babies instead of send them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that and she'll put them on her lap and teach them about the lord jesus christ amen sisters you feel you got a gift to preach or teach there's your congregation it's right there listen brother brown says this exactly he says there's nothing god could give any man any sweeter than a wife a real wife but when she gets anything beyond that she's out of what her place that's exactly right god never intended women to work in any of these places and do them kind of things like that these women there to have children and raise their children now we're talking to the married women not the singles now he says they're all little preachers who's he talking about kids the little boys no he's talking about the women he says there's your women preachers okay you want to see in the message where women preachers fit here they are they're all little preachers every one of them and they have their their own pastoral duties at home with their kitties bringing up their children there's women preachers for you you've got a congregation ready supplied right for you you've got a captive audience as we've talked about that's for you to preach to that's for you to teach to that's for you to evangelize to right all the things that the fivefold ministry is supposed to do that's what a mother can be doing with their very kids there what are you doing introducing them to christ right by a life first by word second then what do you do you lead them to them then you help guide them in it until the point where they can go away and join right in alongside of you what is it you do you do the full five-fold ministry right there in your home with a captive audience that god has called you to do that's your place literally to preach to those little kids day in and day out he says the first preacher that ever gets a child is a mother there's five gospels matthew mark luke john and mother and a mother should be a spirit-filled woman who can teach her children and teach them to pray and to know about god and so forth now brothers that doesn't mean we abdicate all of the teaching to our wives does it that's something that we've got to remember is just because we go out the door for work every morning and she's sitting there doing this throughout the day doesn't mean that we come home and we presume she's done it all that ought to be us we ought to be able to lead them in devotions we ought to lead them in family prayer we have to be able to go with needs before the lord we ought to be able to pray and put them down at night when they go to sleep right don't just place it all on the mothers we got to lead them as well we're supposed to be spiritual leaders in the family so she gets more time but we've got to make sure that we're still leading spiritually not just physically within the home amen we don't want to give that all over to the mothers for sir for sure so let me ask you sisters have you been preaching if so was it to your kids because that's where you're given authority in the scriptures if you're an agent woman you're there to teach the younger women and we've talked about that but if you're married guess what god has given you a place to preach your heart out day in and day out in fact you ought to have nothing left to preach to anybody else by the time you're done with your children because that's your congregation right that's why minister that's why pastors often times they don't want to leave they're so tired out from preaching to their own congregation right that's what we want the mothers to be we ought to be so tired out from preaching to our own little congregation that when we go out we don't want to preach to anybody else we're preached out you know what after a service is done i don't want to go in there and go go to another church and preach why because i'm preached out that's what brother brown i'm saying listen you're the fifth gospel you're the one that those children are looking to so often to help teach them and guide them that way amen and what we've read the scriptures and it says that what you won't be ashamed you won't be fearful right you won't you know you talked about you know not being in amazement and these different things you won't be distrustful of what god's doing in your life because you see him working in the young people in the children that he's given you and sometimes they come late don't they i think we've we've all got families where maybe one person or another is out or we we have extended family that are like that you say well what's going to happen listen he said what when they're old they won't turn away from it right sometimes they've got to go through like the prodigal son don't they they've got to come to themselves at some point and realize guess what being with the pigs ain't all it was cut up to be listen we talked last service about how satan comes in gradual i was thinking about after the prodigal son you talk about gradual because he went from wealthy tons of friends lots of influence having a great time to eating with the pigs in pretty short order and i get i guarantee you along the way he didn't realize exactly what was happening but satan got him all the way down into the pig pen before he came to himself and said listen even the servants at my father's house live better than i'm living right now and he came to himself and sometimes that's what our children have to do isn't it they have to get down with the pigs and realize this really wasn't what i was looking for and then they come back they come to their senses and they come back what when they're old when they come to maturity they realize that there's something else for them amen amen sisters you want a rewarding career here you go this is what god has called women to do this is womanhood for men for for a believer is as a mother amen we're not all called to that and we'll get into that in a couple services from now lord willing we're not called up but if god has given you a marriage then generally that means god's going to give you children and you have a complete ministry lying in front of you for the next 20 30 40 years even all the way till you're old the scripture says that you're still not supposed to stop being that mother amen what is it god's gonna bless you in ways that he wouldn't otherwise because why the holy spirit has given you the authority to do everything that you do as a mother amen when your husband has trusted you and he's entrusted these things you have children it's the holy spirit that empowers a woman to step into this role even of a woman minister in her own family that she's going to take that word she's going to put it on her lips she's going to put it on her life and guess what as we all know as parents there's nothing that's going to test your relationship with god as much as having a kid right your marriage is put through way more stress with those kids isn't it and as soon as they come through and they hit the teenage years and all of a sudden they start getting ideas and they start thinking they're smart and they know better and that may go on for decades sometimes what is it it's going to put a strain on you and what's it going to do it's going to pull you closer to god as well isn't it once you get a family that'll pull you closer to god because you realize very quickly the limitations of your own skills your own ideas your own understanding your own education your own experience and you need supernatural help and that sort of thing it'll bring a power of the holy spirit in your life that you didn't have before that i guarantee you why because the word says that's where you're supposed to be amen let's stand if we would it's a powerful thing when you realize that you're doing what god has told you to do amen it is it's a powerful thing and whether it's the church you attend whether it's the ministry you have whether it's the spouse you have the job you have the function you might fulfill within this church when you realize that that that's what god has called you to do then that's a powerful thing because you know that all of heaven is behind you so our sisters as tough as it is sometimes to sit behind those boundaries and see some of the faults and failures and abuses and mistakes yet know that god has given you a place where that holy spirit can have free reign in your life and if you can only trust and wait god will bless you in a way that you would never have if you try and force those things yourself amen us men have to do the same thing so often we think a decision has got to be made it's got to be made and we try and jump in there and sometimes god's just saying hold on a second son you got to rest too right it's not we we focus on the women because it says if you're sarah's daughters then you're going to have that rest you're going to have that trust but listen us men have to have that as well don't we we've got to be able to sit there and say lord we're depending on you and we're not going to force the situation amen and when we do what when we're in our word position we have spiritual authority then to hold back anything while we wait for god to give us the answer that we're looking for amen amen god bless you let's bow our heads heavenly father lord once again your word challenges us lord not just the sisters but even us brothers lord as members of the bride lord that we want to stay in the position that you've set for us lord that as you've given us authority lord we would use it for your benefit for your kingdom's benefit and lord that we would learn to wait and trust lord that we would learn to give all of our energy to the things that you put in front of us lord that we would lord set it as blinders as frontlets before our eyes so that we're not distracted heavenly father it's a distracting world right now lord satan is a master distracter lord but we pray that you would give us an unction of the holy spirit lord that has a word foundation lord for whatever calling or ministry or lord thing that we find we're going to focus our energy on may we find it first in the word lord and then by inspiration follow into it so that you can use us we pray lord bless our sisters lord how we love and appreciate lord their willingness lord to submit themselves lord in a time when the world is screaming at them to break chains lord to break boundaries glass ceilings lord whatever it might be lord yet they're staying with your word and we pray that you would help us to be worthy of the trust and honor and respect that they give us lord that you would help us as men to be humble lord above all things that we would put their their needs lord above our own even lord as you did for us lord and may your love throw flow through each one of us lord that we would humble ourselves to each other lord under your word we pray lord bless us now we ask in jesus name we pray amen amen power of your love 797 lord i come to you

to pray for the needs that were mentioned earlier i didn't realize brother gerald had been injured so in a fall so we want to remember him tonight as well and sister betty of course and all those that were with him with us tonight so grace to each one may god minister to each and every need and continue to pray for the saints in ukraine and and the innocent people have suffered because of because of a dictator because of a politician and so that's just that's why i couldn't agree more and the quotes i've seen in america what brother brandon said about politics uh you only said about one-fifth of them but uh it's so it's just so true and so may god just touch the innocence and protect them all and especially the saints of god and remember of course sister laura collins as well and let's all hold on in faith and you know i just say this about faith and um i've been listening some messages this week and and one my brother and uh he gave a testimony uh something that happened to brother andre head and we know brother andre head of course he was he was here a few years ago and i'm sure we'd love to have him back uh but as you know he's a minister a missionary and he was called he was he was heading over to the jungles around venezuela and uh i don't know if anybody heard this but i only heard it last night and brother uh the topic that the brother was preaching about was was about faith of course about knowing knowing where you stand what influence you're really under right and uh he said he said brother andre was was being led to go over there into the jungles and he said where he was going was where there were tribes there were cannibals tribes of indians that were cannibals so he said you have to know that god is sending you and brother andre invited somebody else to go with him and he said nope not going right he said you got to know and when he got over there uh he was he went in with his interpreter and and others that went in with them into the deepest jungles in there and he um when he got in there he was preaching for to these indians for two or three days and he said on the third day an indian came up with him with a container of some liquid in it and he took it and he stood in front of brother andre and he and he took that glass or whatever it was and he threw it on the ground and smashed it in front of him but andre said well what's this about and the indian said for the past three days he said you've been drinking this he said i've been trying to kill you and poison you with this stuff and he said you've been drinking it and he fell to his knees and asked him to lead him to the lord all right it's in knowing what god has for you and if he's if he's leading you he'll look after you i mean that's that's scripture manifested right there right i mean it's just absolutely wonderful so you know let's let's just trust the lord here right now i mean the devil might be doing this to sister laura collins but uh you know if we pray and believe together there's nothing can stand in the way of that these are the promises of god that are given to the children of god so let's believe tonight for her and and believe for brother evan and believe for brother gerald but i believe for all for each other no matter what the need is god is greater than any need and we believe that the devil got nothing he got nothing i was born to be a dwelling place i was born to be [Music] amen [Music] for the presence of the lord [Music] lord to thee that i might be what i was born to be for i was [Music] amen hallelujah [Music] presence [Music]
