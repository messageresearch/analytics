heart Thank You Lord Lord for your goodness and your grace to us this morning Lord that we could come into this building dedicated to you Lord and worship your name and lift your name and tell you how much we love you heavenly father but Lord I pray your grace to help us when we leave this morning Lord that it would not just be words Lord for that's the danger of a people that draws nigh with their words but their heart is far from you the scripture says so Lord May Our Lives May our actions our decisions day by day reflect Lord the love that we profess in here this morning morning Lord God lord not just for you but one for another we pray Lord you said that's how people would know we're your disciples as our love one for another so Lord we're thankful this morning Lord we're thankful for answered prayer this morning Lord we're thankful Lord for your call in our hearts and souls Lord that brings us in to hear the preaching of your word Lord to lift our hands and our voices in Praise

encouragement you see where we need correction Lord you see where we need to come up a little bit higher Lord I pray you just do a work with your people this morning Lord grant us Grace each one we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Psalm 144 Psalm 144 I want to welcome our visitors here this morning amen God bless you each one and then welcome brother Jim back into the church building amen amen after a heart attack and to see him here just wanting to Worship the Lord and of course having sister Lynn and sister Florence and sister Patricia and brother jewes it's a it's a pleasure to have you with us it's not the way we'd want to bring you in to have service with us but we'll take the fellowship and we'll take the uh the enjoyment of being with Saints of like Precious Faith any way we can get it amen uh brother Joe spoke with brother Josh yesterday or checked in with him and he and brother anic are were in New Brunswick yesterday and uh on their way to Ottawa so just pray continue great and traveling mercies to them as they continue as you can see my eyes still bothering me it's why I'm wearing the glasses this morning but it's doing much better believe it or not uh today's the best it's been so we thank the Lord for that just trust him to keep healing that and uh taking that away amen certainly enjoyed the specials this morning thank you sister Florence it's uh you know when you go through something tough It's hard to come back and say but God's God and to say he does all things well and he has a purpose and he has these things and that's a sign of a believer is that whether it's in the highs or whether it's in the lows they can say God is God and we trust him and we love him and we know that he's working all things for our good amen and then sister Moren I'd asked in previous Services did we know the verses to that that song because I know them but not everybody else does and so she went and learned them saying them as a special so I certainly appreciate that amen it was wonderful amen Psalms 144 and verse1 says this blessed be the Lord my strength which te teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight my goodness and my Fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom I trust who subdueth my people under me amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and I want to take a turn this morning and we've been preaching the series on manifesting time and the adoption of the children of God and it's going to take us a few services to get to the finishes finish on this and it's been nearly a year of study and preaching and we're getting close to the in so it's uh we'll see how many services it takes I've got at least one or two more services of notes back home but I want to take a title this morning of teach My Hands to War amen teach My Hands to War and we've talked about so much in this series we've talked about what it means to be a child of God and the the training and the tutoring that we go through and the Holy Ghost has given to us first to tutor and train us and to bring our lives subject to the word and to bring our minds subject to the word to bring our decisions subject to the word and to bring our jobs subject to the word and to bring our fames subject to the word and all of these things and it's a time of trying and testing but then there's a time where where the tutor says to the father he says all right he's ready or she's ready and there's an adoption moment amen and so we've talked about all these different things and and we know that all these things are for a purpose we know that the things that happen in our life are for a purpose and the purpose of everything that's happening is to bring you into God's purpose amen when we look at these things that happen and we look at the UPS we look at the downs and we want the UPS to be about God and the Downs to be about Satan but that's not the way it is in the believer's life God is there as much in the Downs as he is in the ups and he's using all of those things to bring us into his purpose and the purpose of adoption is to save you from yourself it's to take you completely out of this fleshly nature it's to take you out of this carnal nature it's to take you out of the sin realm that is in these Fallen broken bodies and to take you back what God intended for you to be before time even began to bring you back into the very uh manifestation of the thoughts that God had for you Before Time began it takes you out of the clutches of this world it takes you out of the clutches of Satan's Eden it takes you out of the mindset of the way that people think today why because they've gotten so far away from God that they can't even come close to him anymore and it takes a breakthrough it takes the sovereignty of God to pierce that veil of insanity that's over people today and the thing that adoption does is it brings you into a new creature a new creation in Christ where you can have his nature you can have his word you can have his power and his authority flowing through your life amen and God has an involved group of people we do not sit here and we don't sit back on a couch and just say well I'm a Christian I'm a Believer and therefore I'm going to heaven and I'm going to receive eternal life no God has people that are involved in what he's doing that's the purpose of the adoption that Paul spoke about in the scriptures was to bring us to a place where God can use us and we're at the rolling up of the seventh Church age to the Gentiles we're at the rolling up of all time and so God is trying to come to a place with us where he says I can use you now that's what God's trying to do amen God's saying I want to use you in a particular way but I just need to train you and test you and bring you to a place where I can trust you to do it listen to this he says God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I see we think God can do anything God's not bound by anything but God has bound himself to a certain degree to using you and I amen and you see it all through scriptures that he uses people flawed people imperfect people but people nonetheless that will surrender and yield to God and he comes in and he uses to perform his works and he uses them to perform his will his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program he says but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program anden I said we're at the end of the Gentile age we're at the end of the seventh Church age where time shall be no more as we read in in Revelations 10 and and we look there in Revelations 10 and that Mighty angel comes down and that's Christ and he says it's going to be all wrapped up now it's the ending of all things and brother Jerry and brother Paul both touched on this this past weekend speaking on the seventh seal because the seventh seal is the wrapping up of the entire Redemption plan of God in a timeline it goes all the way from the fourth seal which is the end of the Gentile Church age all the way through the Sixth Seal all the way through the tribulation all the way through the Millennium all the way through the white Throne judgment and then it finishes with a new Heaven and a new Earth because you got to realize that's the full Redemption plan is to bring us back to the original and when the new Heaven and the new Earth come back that's the original we're back to where we were supposed to have been in all this time and so that's when the seventh seal finishes but the seventh seal when you see in the Scripture it says that there was silence in heaven for about the space of a half an hour why because God has already spoken what needs to be spoken God has already written what needs to be written now what he's doing in Revelation 10:7 is he steps down and he's a mighty Angel that's Christ coming down and he's coming into action and he says it's time to finish the works that I said I was going to do that's what the seventh seal is about this the sealed book remember was the book of redemption and John wept because nobody could open it but then he said no the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and who steps out it's a lamb slain bloody it's Christ stepping out and he takes the book and what does he do he opens it up and in Revelation 10 he doesn't come down with a closed book he comes down with an open book why because he's reading out of the Redemption book He's reading the names of the people whose lives are are are inside of that and what do he doing he's calling our name and as he tears the seal off of each of Our Lives we hear our name and we start to recognize hey I'm a Child of God I'm not just a a person walking through this life I'm not just born into something I'm just not a member of a family but I am a child of God and what happens is life bursts forth It's that word seed that was inside of our heart from before the foundation of the world and we come and we're quickened by the power of the holy spirit in the word of our life and it starts to bring forth something and we realize there's more to this than I thought amen there's more to this life than I plot than I had thought and so we realize it and we start to step into the fullness of the Redemption plan of God Amen I don't just want to be half in and half out one foot in one foot out you can't do that that's lukewarmness that's death but if we can step into the fullness as the holy spirit opens the word to us that's when God starts to grow a bride to produce a church and that Redemption plan is not just God it involves us now we are not redeemers we can't be we needed a redeemer we need a redeemer so we can't redeem if we are under a redeemer already and we can't be a savior because we needed a savior but yet God uses his people in this Redemption plan to bring others to him because if I was a redeemer I'd bring people to me but I don't I point them to Christ because he's the only one that can do something for them amen God works through his children and he always has and each one of us has a particular part to play in that it says and see how God in his great plans just knew how to make every person just exactly to be a certain thing see we focus on the differences and think that that makes us less no the difference is is what makes you exactly what God needs you to be he says he made every person just exactly to be a certain thing why because he's going to use them for that purpose can I get an amen this morning God uses me for my purpose when we wake up in the morning my wife and I pray together and what do we pray God let us catch your purpose for this day because the purpose for the day is set in certain things I've got to be a father I've got to be a husband she's got to be a mother she's got to be a wife but in those things Lord what is your will the basics are always there but Lord as opportunities come our way as circumstances arise as people come into our lives Lord what do you want me to do what do you want me to say what do you want me to not say sometimes I me Lord how do you want me to react Lord what would you have this family to do for you today that ought to be our cry every morning is Lord help me be finding your purpose for my life day by day amen and that's a battle that's a battle every single day because remember I and I don't want to be too funny this morning but remember that person that was that was praying they said Lord It's been a wonderful day and I haven't made any mistakes and I'm at such peace but Lord I'm about to get out of bed now and I need your help for the rest of the day isn't that the way it is we get out of bed and we have our devotions we read our Bible we pray together and then our feet hit the floor and then that's when the trials really start that's when we need the victory is when we get out of our beds and we start trying to do what the word tells us to do that's a battle every single day because Satan's there to distract us constantly that is Satan's greatest uh uh weapon these days I believe is distraction to absorb the things that the time that we have you know my wife and I were talking about it yesterday how that we have so much to make our lives easy sisters you don't have to go and scrub your clothes by hand in a wash basin now and hang them out you can just throw them in a machine and pour in one or two things doom boom hit a button and you're good to go you can put them in a dryer you don't have to hang them out you don't have to watch out for the weather everything's taken care of you dishes washed by machine you don't have to take the rugs out and beat them you got a vacuum cleaner that'll clean them as good as they can get us Brothers we don't have to Hitch up the horses and feed them and and clean out the Stalls every morning we just go and turn the key in our car and we can get wherever we're going just so fast and yet we have so little time why Satan is a master of distraction he's a master of absorbing the times and Satan's always trying to come in and magnify situations magnify the problems and he's never wanting us to catch the vision or the purpose or the plan or the promises of God he's trying trying to distract us from these things he's trying to make us forget Who We Are by making the situation and the symptoms so great that we think that that's what determines the outcome amen we have to be seeking the kingdom of God first first and everything else Jesus said will be added to you that you that you have need of not the wants not the desires that's his Sovereign will that he would give us those or not but your needs he says I'll meet them if you'll seek the kingdom of God first amen now we're in a fight every single day and and we're going to see what that battle looks like because we have those moments of rest amen we have those moments of rest but the thing is even if we want to be at peace we've got an enemy we've got somebody that's always got it out for us and sometimes the person that's got it out for us is even ourselves sometimes we can have rest but we won't let go of things we won't lay it down and we continue a battle that we don't have to fight and that's what's taking away our rest so many times is we're fighting a battle that's not ours to fight we don't even need to be there amen but we do have a fight and I want to take us back to the Book of Judges this morning and I I just so appreciated the services the the dedication meetings we had last week with brother Jerry and and brother Paul and brother Paul kind of finished with the thought of a new generation I already had these notes I hadn't hadn't laid them out yet but I had all the thoughts there and he spoke on a new generation and I so appreciate that when the Holy Spirit works that way because the ministry doesn't talk to each other and say I'm going to preach on this so you can preach on that no that takes the Holy Ghost to do that amen and I appreciate when God will come down and move am men like that but I want to refresh our minds before we go to the Book of Judges this morning with some quotes that we read last year sometime and I I just want to set us up for the this last topic this last portion of this series this morning now he said this Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost he says Egypt is the world that they came out of the Wilderness is where they were Sanctified and a called out Church Canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit cuz they still have wars he says and if you don't don't believe you have war wars just get the Holy Spirit once amen he says what are you doing what do you do in Canaan he says they were possessing their rights he says Glory they were possessing their rights and they could not possess their rights until they got into Canaan he says they didn't know nothing in the wilderness the children of Israel walked around for 40 years possessing nothing God preserved them God gave them food God kept their clothing God God spared their amilies but they didn't have any rights in the desert cuz that wasn't the land of promise the land of promise for the believer is repent in the name of repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit that is our promise is the holy spirit we repent we get baptized he gives us the promise amen that's what we need that's what we're looking for is the Holy Spirit to to seal our souls he says but then when they came into Canaan then they had rights then they had a word promised then they could go back and say Lord this is what you said belong to me he says and we've got rights when you receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canaan but he says you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for it yes sir so if we're elected children of God we're predestinated children of God we are ordained children of God then there's a promise for us to receive the Holy Ghost because that is the seal that is the proof of the true child of God is that he gives him the Holy Ghost only the children of God can receive the Holy Ghost because that's the nature of the father amen you know when we look at at children what makes children is that they have a part of us brother Levi here can't be my child because there's none of me in him but you know when we look at our children it humbles us because they're not as perfect as we are and we want to say where did that come from guess what there's nothing in that child that didn't come from you and your wife yes you can blame your wife but through it all there's a portion of you and there's a portion of her in there and we've got to Bear the responsibility for what's in that child that's a part of me the good and the bad the beautiful thing with God is that it's all good everything he gives you is good amen he's the Fountain of Light he is life he is truth he is love he is all of these things and so when he gives you the Holy Ghost he's giving you only the good only the good it's a perfect thing but here's the thing Satan hates every single bit of what God gives you and because of that he'll fight you for every inch that you try and take every promise in the word that you try and hold on to every bit of faith that you try and apply Satan is there to fight us every single day of our life amen he hates it and he'll try and hold it or he'll try and take it back back from you every single day yeah we've spoken at length about the promises of God and and the land God has given us and it's all found in the Holy Ghost when God gives you the Holy Ghost there is the potential there to fulfill every word of God because it's a portion of God Amen in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God God and then he gives us a portion of that word it's the life of the word and it's the holy spirit amen it's the word that's expressed in you and I and it has the potential to believe every word to accept every word to act on every word to receive every word and to hold to every word amen it has the ability that is what the Holy Ghost is there for is to latch on to the word of God and take it off the pages of this book and put it into my life and make it live in a way that I thought it could never do that's the miracle of the new birth is that you live in a way you've never lived before you can't get the Holy Ghost you can't have a new birth and walk out and do the things that you did before you can't walk out with the same desires because you're a new creation in Christ the old man the old woman has died and you're a new creation in Christ you know we're we're in this this last stage and we're we're not just in Canaan now but we've been in Canaan a while if you look around it and we can see here that the Holy Ghost has moved in our elders and they come to a certain place and we see it doesn't take a lot of God to defeat Satan the littlest bit of God will defeat anything that Satan has because there's infinite power in the Holy hly spirit amen and we can look around at the older folks in this in this congregation and I'm so thankful for them because we've seen people that have gone into Canaan ahead of us that they heard an eagle cry they heard a prophet's message and they answered it and what happened is God gave them the true New Birth God gave them the holy ghost in a way that they had never received before God gave them the fullness of what was supposed to be happening amen but they didn't just sit back they've been through many trials they've been through tribulations they've had family pull away they've been ostracized they've been all these things and we see that they didn't sit back on their couches they weren't lazy Christians okay I got the Holy Ghost I've received the the word for my hour now I'm just going into Rapture no no they had to fight for every step that they took and we sit here today and we often don't know the battles that they went but if you go ask brother Jim if you go ask brother Gerald if you go ask brother Mark and brother Bob and their spouses they'll say we have to fight and we're still in a fight why because we've got an enemy we've got not an enemy that's trying to hold us back amen we're born to fight and we're born to win you cannot overcome unless you go through a battle and come out on the victory side you cannot do it you've got to go through a battle to overcome and remember in each of the seven Church ages the promise is only to the Overcomer to those that overcome that means you got to be you've got to have a battle and you've got to have a victory in that battle amen amen we're born to overcome now listen to this he says that's what's the matter with people tonight in Divine Healing and everything it's yours go take it Hallelujah God said I'll give it to you it's yours he says now it wouldn't be right for God to go and Dish all the things out he gave them the land they've got to do the house cleaning amen God left a portion for us to do but remember what he said he says I will send my spirit before you I will go before you I'll put fear into the hearts of your enemies when fear enters the enem is defeated church when fear enters the enemy is defeated because they've lost confidence in who they are and their ability to withstand what's coming their way he says I'm going to go put the fear of God in them so that when you come they'll fall by the wayside amen he says it's yours but he ain't going to come poke it down your neck you've got to take the land yourself he's given it to you and it's yours rise and possess it Hallelujah he says it's your choice oh you're telling me brother John that it's AO Choice as to how much of God's promises I can have absolutely remember what the prophet God said he says footsteps is possession not verbal steps footsteps you got to put your life where your mouth says and me you got to walk the talk he says it's given to you and it's yours rise and possess it it's your choice if you want to murmur like the other 10 spies did you'll wander in the wilderness a long time longer till tomorrow night you're still sick but if you're ready to take it tonight it's yours he says what kind of a choice are you going to make I will take Jesus and his promise and tell the Devil he's a liar amen so everything we have everything that's ours every portion of our inheritance in this word of God there's going to be a fight for it there's going to be a fight it's ours you know what I love about this word it tells us we're facing a defeated enemy Christ conquered everything death hell and the grave and every demonic and and sickness every Power he defeated it at Calvary it's a defeated enemy this morning so he says Rise and possess your inheritance man Satan's encamped on it Satan's camped out on the word of God and he's sitting there and he's trying to build this big hedge he's trying to build this big tower this big castle this big fortress with lots of guns to make you think that it belongs to him but we've got to say it's mine now not just it's hers or it's his it's mine we always have faith for everyone else I say Lord help my faith to arise for my life and my situation as well amen Satan's doing everything he can to make you think that he's stronger than you are let me tell you something he is stronger than you but I'm not resting on me me died there's a new creation now and this one is unlimited by the power of the word of God Amen that's the thing I love about this new generation is they're still call to Victory the same as the original there is no difference in call there is no difference in power there is no difference in anointing every generation is called to overcome amen now here's the thing we went they went and they did their part the first generation came into Canan and and and they went in and they destroyed and they they they they took the cities and they won their battles and they had the signs and the Wonders and the Miracles and all these different things and we see that witness today in our midst and I say praise the Lord for that but they did not have a complete and total Victory you'll see but there's a purpose behind that because there's a generation that comes after the new generation there's a new new generation that comes the second generation comes behind the first and there's a particular work because God's got to bring them to the place where they know what it means to fight and get Victory God not this isn't the Millennium you got to know how to stay close to God Amen that's what's got to happen so if we look in Judges 3 in verse one it says now these are the Nations which the Lord left in other words he left some people in Canaan that were not serving God he left enemies in the land he says to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan in other words he's proving Israel because there were a there was a generation that didn't face War they just came into a land of milk and honey a land of everything provided and they didn't know what it meant to fight for it he says only that the generations of of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at the least such as knew not but knew nothing thereof now catch this thought so God's left these enemies alive in Canaan the first generation didn't kill them all and so there's something left for the second generation of those original enemies why he says to prove Israel if you look at that word prove it means to test and try remember what the tutor was for the son the son that was PL the son had a tutor placed over him Jesus talked about it and and Paul talked about it where they they have a tutor that was placed over the son to educate him and train him and prepare him to go about the father's business and it's the same word there that we use for adoption which is the testing and trying of a child to prepare them to inherit so this work this this battle that they're facing is going to prepare them to come into adoption to prepare them to step into the purpose of God for their lives it says there in verse in the verse it says it was intended for the people that had not known all the wars of Canaan and other words it was for people that had inherited peace that had inherited lands that had inherited kingdoms that had inherited all the good things of God but didn't have to fight for them and this morning we see a generation May maybe two generations in a way sitting here this morning and what we've got is we've got the elders that have heard the call come out of her my people and that was a revelation and it took courage and it took commitment it took a personal revelation of the word that they were hearing but see now we're born into it I'm born into a family that is has accepted this full word I don't have to make that decision in a way that they did I have to make a personal decision but it's not in the way that they did I'm born into it I inherit their hard work their battles that they fought but see God comes behind he says that ain't going to work that ain't going to work inherited religion will not work you cannot do that you have to be born into the kingdom of God you do not inherit it you're born into it and then you inherit it by your new birth amen amen sons that if you look around this world today and it's been for all history you don't have to look today I guess but every almost without fail every generation that inherits a business or an opportunity from their parents starts to run it into the ground and by the second generation after their parents they've lost it all why because they don't have any they don't value it the same way there's no blood there's no sweat there's no tears into it and so they just take it and they use it and use it and use it and they run it into the ground it's the same thing with the with the promises of God we can take these things for granted and we start to go around presuming that we have something and we don't have it and in the end we lose what's all there but catch this second verse because it's where my inspiration came from for this series amen that the purpose of leaving those enemies alive was to teach them to war who didn't know anything about war amen we've got to learn to fight we cannot sit under Mom and Dad's roof and say I've got Victory because of mom and dad we've got to learn to get Victory ourselves amen we've got to learn to battle ourselves and that's what this is about the the whole culmination of this series now is brother brothers and sisters how do we take how do we take a hold of what God has given us how do we put into action what we've heard how do we keep what we've got and how do we go get what we haven't received yet this is where the rubber meets the road this is this is this is going to be good Homestyle Cooking if we're going to put it amen and that means that every single one of us is going to be in a battle if you're a child of God God you're going to be in a battle no matter what because God will bring things into your life to make you learn how to fight to stand with the word of God Amen why because we've got an enemy no matter what like I said we can sit here and say I don't want anything to do with anyone just leave me alone Satan Satan won't leave you alone cuz he's your enemy and enemies fight and they poke and they do all these different things he's not going to let us alone unless we destroy him he says this every Christian fights a battle every day we're in a Warfare right now going on constantly within us between right and wrong shall we receive it what shall we do shall we bow to the world shall we give up this thought that we've got and if we see it and focus it take it from Genesis to Revelation what do we have today people that are cherry pick in their Bible take it from Genesis to Revelation if it doesn't go all the way through it's wrong he says she is thus sayeth the Lord each time write on down through there we can't give it up we can't compromise with the rest of them we just can't do it we've got to stay here where with the word that's all no matter how great the enemy is how many much Machinery he's got against us how many organizations and how many of this that or the other we yet we have pulled this focus of God's word till we find that there's one thing and that's the blood of Jesus Christ remember the The Book of Revelation says they overcame by the blood of the Lamb first and foremost we never stray to too far from Calvary while we're in this flesh we never stray too far from Calvary because we need to keep our lives under that blood every single day amen it says and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen therefore don't make any difference what anyone else says they say the days of Miracles will pass there's no such thing is Divine Healing there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost and baptism of the name of Jesus Christ that was for the disciple only and all these things they try to focus off of it but still it focuses right back to the word and nobody can say it's not there he says that's right so we're in a Warfare what to stay with the word of God he says and God's Heroes Have Always had Warfare you know what we call everyday living that's what God calls Warfare and the fruit of Our Lives the results of Our Lives is the result of warfare where we've won amen when we see the good things of God and by good things of God I don't mean money in the bank and a house over our roof when I see the word of God coming out of our life the fruit of the spirit coming out of our life that's the result of Victories W you know we we see so many people and and we talk to people and they're in their denominations and we're not a denomination we're in an independent group we are under no headship except the holy spirit amen we preach only from the scriptures but people will come in under those Creeds and under those those things and they'll come in and they'll say we like what the results are but we can't come to the belief that you have and they said the same thing about Jesus they said the same thing about his disciples and it's ever been that way why because they're Bound by something and it takes God to open their eyes that they could ever see beyond that and it's God's grace that we can see it this morning amen Beyond these things they'll say don't I just can't believe like you do but I love the results and what happens is they're losing their young people they're using their Holiness they're losing their commitment they're losing the victory they're losing their Joy but they just can't seem to come around to believing it the way we do man what's the problem they're under a system where Satan is the head remember what it says in Revelation it talks about the Harlot the that sits on Seven Hills and that's the Roman Catholic church but then she's got daughters and it's every organization that came out of it had the same problem they put it under the headship of men instead of the Holy Ghost like it was on the day of Pentecost there was never an organization in scripture never ever ever it was men led by the Holy Spirit to go and move and act and women too amen that's the way the church is supposed to be amen hey those people still have battles cuz they stand on a portion of the word but here's the thing partial stands give you partial results and the thing is we're in this for life and there's no such thing as half alive you're either dead or you're alive you're either cold or you're hot and remember lukewarm is death in Revelation 3 it says you're lukewarm and I'll spit you out of my mouth because you won't go all the way you're standing on the fence you won't commit everything you've got to it amen let me bring you some scriptures and one more quote before we move forward in this thought that God has allowed things in our lives to train us to fight to train us to go to war to train us how to deal with life anden he's got a purpose in these things and I I want to start with maybe the first thing we learn as a Christian because it's a part of the new birth but it's something that's ongoing every day in our life and it's to lay aside anything that hinders you it's to lay things down amen that's really what repentance is when you think about it repentance is to walk away to turn away and go in the other direction from something that's holding you back in your walk with God because it's wrong but here's the thing not everything is wrong sometimes it's wrong for me and it's not wrong for you and I've got to be able to walk away from it because it's hindering me but you can walk with God and have that thing because it doesn't hinder you it doesn't have strength it doesn't have power over you you don't have a weakness like I have and remember we've got to be able to lay these things down and you know what happens is times get tough money gets tight Health starts to drop away marriages get strained and that's when we start to really start checking up isn't it and say Lord I need an answer Lord I need direction Lord I need provision Lord I need healing and what do we do we start checking our time because like you said Satan is the great distractor and he fills our time with everything except the word of God that's where I fail so much of the time amen accounting for my time why cuz sometimes I haven't laid down those things that I need to lay down you know I saw someone's phone the other today and you know we all have a a screen on the front and that person's phone said do you need to be on your phone I thought praise the Lord somebody got a revelation do I need to be on my phone I guarantee you for 95% of us the problems we're facing come from that phone not against phones we need them but I'll tell you 95% of what you're dealing with is probably coming right through that device why because we're letting it do things that we ought not to let it do in our lives amen I just love that it's a great question do I really need this do I really need to do this is this really going to help me today is this going to help anyone today forget about me is it going to help anyone and usually the answer is 100% absolutely not amen that was for free this morning you I read this in devotions on Friday and it struck me so much as a challenge but as a reminder as well because we're in a battle and really the battle starts in here the battle is internal before it's ever external anden you win the internal battle the external battle has no effect on you it's an internal battle from start to finish and I was reading in Galatians 5 and it said this Paul said this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh anyone else fighting the lust of the flesh occasionally seven of us 14 15 seven there we go we fight this every single day and it's so annoying isn't it drives me nuts that it wants to do things that I have told it time and time again don't do that but the body wants what the body wants amen people that preach you get the Holy Ghost that'll go away no the desire in your heart will be purified but this flesh it's in a battle every single day with what's inside of your Soul amen Paul said there's a weapon to defeat that flesh and he says it's walk in the spirit in other words take what you believe and put it into action start acting on the word instead of just talking about the word why he says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary that the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would there's the battle the flesh the Fallen portion of this body it's fighting against the Holy Spirit that's inside of you that's why we need the holy spirit so that there's a battle in the first place because without the holy spirit in there there is no battle you've just got your carnal nature inside I mean you got your carnal spirit inside of you but there's a battle every day and it's a battle of your flesh and it's the battle between this carnality and then the Holy Spirit which is supposed to be in control but there's a battle every day as to which one's going to actually have it because the Holy Ghost is pointing you to the word of God and your carnality is this flesh is pointing you to what you think what you feel what you know what's reasonable all of these different things and the Holy Ghost is screaming out stay with the word of God stay with the word of God stay with the word of God stay with the word of God Amen if nothing else you'll face that battle between your mind and your flesh every single day your soul and your flesh every single day but Paul continues a little further down here in verse 24 he tells us how to win he says and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts in other words what is crucifixion it pins it doesn't allow it to move it says you're not going anywhere I'm in control the holy spirit's in control you're not allowed to go anywhere and it's dying daily to this flesh the more you deprive it the weaker it gets amen I've said it plainly over this Pulpit as a young man I've dealt with pornography I've dealt with lust I've dealt with pride I've dealt with fear all of these different things listen there's a holy ghost that can deliver you from every single one of those things but we've got to what crucify it we've got to hold ourselves accountable to the word of God and say Lord the desire is not there and I want Victory and God will give you the victory but you've got to walk according to your desire which is Lord I don't want it anymore and how do you do that you crucify it you keep it pinned you keep it tied down you keep it where it has no control and you say you're not getting out today you're not getting out today you're not getting out today he says if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit that was my challenge he says if we say we've got the Holy Ghost then let's start acting like it every single day if we say we've got it then how about we start living a life and I'm not saying we don't but I'm saying let's live more of a life anden let's come up a little higher a little step precept upon precept line upon line word upon word let's do a little more today than we did yesterday that's all we're saying I loved how brother Jerry brought it out he says we have faith but how about trust that was so beautiful if there was anything I got it was that if we have faith then where's our trust because if we say we have faith then we'll put our lives on the line behind the word of God remember what James said Works without faith is dead or faith without works rather is dead you say you got faith and you don't put it into action in your life you don't have faith except intellectual faith and that is the weakest of all faiths and it has nothing Supernatural about it why because a testimony spoken but not lived there's no testimony that's literally a hypocrite but if we put it into action then now what happens is the holy spirit comes behind that word to Empower it and make it live inside of our Lives amen listen to this he says God has got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way and here's the thing that I'm fighting most of the time is me I've talked about it before how even when I was 10 years old I felt a called to give my heart to the Lord but I did not give it until I was 17 years old why because me wanted a good life me wanted to be a doctor me wanted to have lots of money me wanted a portion 911 Turbo me wasn't sure he was going to enjoy being a Christian the battle was with me and Satan was just putting up barrier after barrier after barrier and I'd sit through service after service and that call would be to for me to come up and give my life to the Lord and I'd shut it down every single time every single time every single time until he called my name and he made it so specific and so personal to me and my life and my plans and intentions and goals that I had to say he's here because he discerned the thoughts and the intents of my heart and I said that's me yeah I talked to brother Barry about that because he was the one that was ministering at that that that that set of meetings him and brother Donnie Reagan and and I said do you remember me talking to you after that service because I said you went through and you pinned down every every single thing that I had plans to do and you said you think you're going to do this but you're not you think you're going to do this but you're not and he hit the three things that I had plans to do that made no sense to anybody else and he looked at me with a blank stare and he didn't remember even saying it why because it wasn't him saying it it was the spirit of God in the building that was saying it amen that's what we believe we don't believe that a man just goes into a room and he opens his Bible and he picks a topic we believe that the holy spirit is using men to preach to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart to go into lives and say things about which they know nothing that's the power of the god that we believe in this morning here amen he says he's got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that's been a fight constantly it certainly has but if we must fight but we must fight if we must Reign so we find out that the bride has to make make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that sets before us he says we must lay them aside this comes back to what I was saying earlier what is the first lesson we have to learn lay it down we must lay them aside [Applause] ourself there's personal choice here we cannot say God you come and lay them aside for us we have to do that ourselves amen and how does that come we look at the word and we say the word says do this and I'm not doing it or the word says don't do it and we are doing it and that takes honesty and integrity of heart to do that especially for the mature believer and then we say Lord you see it I don't want it or you say Lord I don't see it but I want it and that's when he can make the move but you've got to be willing to lay it down you you got to be willing to lay it aside you've got to be willing to make that sacrifice whether it's for Comfort whether it's for ease of life whether for it's for acceptance whatever it might be you've got to be able to take your way with God's chosen few and guess what they are scorned and turned away by almost everybody it's only a few that can do it he says we must lay them aside ourselves if I would ask you today what's the first thing you automatically do when you have free time I would say that's probably the one thing that's hindering you the most and it's an easy answer it's an easy answer some of us pick up a book some of us pick up a phone some of us pick up a basketball some of us pick up a hockey stick and I guarantee you the first thing we pick up is probably the thing that's hindering us the most in our walk he says we must lay them aside ourselves that's a personal intentional conscious Choice amen we do it every single day now before we go too deep into this thought on teach My Hands to War I want to look at what the war is because otherwise we end up fighting a battle that's not ours so many people are fighting battles today and I think the worst thing that Christians are doing these days are fighting political battles you know we look and we get so caught up in American politics and then we get into Canadian politics we start fighting Politics as Christians and Jesus said this Kingdom my servants are not of this world we're not of this Kingdom we don't fight for this we're seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God we're pilgrims and strangers here we're here for Souls we're not here for power we're not here to take over the country we're not here to make things right that happens in the new in the new word new Earth new Heaven and a new Earth that's when everything comes right the Millennium We Rule and Reign for a thousand years but even then everything's not perfect in the sense cuz it's all got to be destroyed and renewed again amen but so many times what happens is we're Bound by our own thinking we're Bound by our own preferences our own ideas and what happens is we turn it into a battle of wills and guess what Satan's got way more will than I've got he'll break me every single time if I'm fighting a battle of my own choosing but Paul said this Paul declared what the battle was he says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh in other words the battle we fight is not Earthly it is not natural and it is not something you can win using this or using this it's not going to work he says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not natural they're not fleshly but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds can I start here and say this don't worry if you got strongholds worry if you won't let God break them down we've all got strongholds we've all had strongholds we're all going to have strongholds where Satan has gotten into our lives in some form or fashion we've either allowed him or we've got a natural disposition to it whatever it might be that's not the problem the problem is will we let the word have an effect in our lives will we let the Holy Spirit do what it's supposed to do in our lives and clean up our lives in these things amen the problem is so often we'll hide behind those strongholds we'll hide behind those weaknesses and will use them as an excuse for not doing anything or we can be an overcomer and say Lord I'm calling you on the scene amen I want you to notice what the root of these strongholds is for so many and we're going to cover a Ser we're going to I've got a whole service I want to do on just this thought right here but not so much today but I want you to see where the stronghold is he says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ what was Christ obedient to the word he was the word made flesh everything he did was by the word so that's the thing we have to do is bring every imagination every High thing every thought to the word bring it into captivity to the word amen it's a mind battle see where it is the weapons of our Warfare are not caral but the Battleground is the mind cuz he says it's imagination it's things that exalt itself against knowledge and it's every thought so that's where the Battleground is is in the mind amen if we go into Romans 8 it says this for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the Flesh in other words if you live according to this natural way of living then that's what you're going to get he says but they that are after the spirit they mind the things of the spirit so if you're born again you're going to have a different Focus than you did before before you were born again he says for to be carnally what minded the battles in the mind to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so you can be minded two ways you can be fleshly and carnal or you can be spiritual carnal means that you are what dead it only leads to death and then there's another way he says you can be spiritual and it'll lead you into life and peace anybody wants some life and peace this morning you got to change your mindedness amen you got to change the way that you're thinking the change change the way that you're looking at things one brings death one brings life and peace he says because the carnal mind is enmity against God it is always contrary to God it is always fighting God it is always refusing to take the word of God always the full word because remember when when Eve was in the the Garden of Eden she only got it wrong by one word but it completely changed the meaning of that word and by it all Humanity fell because the carnal mind is enmity against God it's contrary to God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be he says now I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go into action and I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them and training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start amen are you ready this evening this afternoon he says there has to be a place selected if you're going to fight there's got to be a Battleground he says and in this there's a mutual ground in no man's land and they fight here at this place they don't just one fight over here and one down here and one run over here there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army tests its strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place he says now don't miss this when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battle Ground began in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it began and that is because decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there he says therefore the organization can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you in other words you can't stay neutral if you stay neutral you've lost amen you got to make a choice and it's a battle to make the right one he says your choice is going to come to you whether you want to make it or not you're going to come to the valley of decision and you're going to have to make a choice we see here from what Paul said in the prophet of God's pointing us back to that same thought that the Battleground is first and foremost in the mind and every battle after that comes afterwards the first battle is in your mind our thoughts are what show the signs of the battle you think about what you've been thinking about over the past week and then you'll realize there's probably been a battle going on Amen there's been a struggle that's there and and and we think that's a natural thing but I want you to think where do thoughts come from where does inspiration come from you know I'm an engineer and we'll sit there and we're trying to come up with something do and all of a sudden something comes out that you've never seen before nobody's ever done it before and then you go and you do it why something outside of me brought it to me and it's no different for everything else we think that we are the sum of our thoughts but something's bringing it and you know so often you see in the cartoons you see an angel on the right shoulder and you see a demon or a devil on the left shoulder and they're both pointing at the brain and they're trying to feed thoughts in that's what's happening remember what Paul says it's a battle of the Mind there's thoughts that are coming in and they ain't all Godly thoughts they're not all inspired by the word of God so we're fighting these things day by day I can't create inspiration it comes to me that's exactly the way it works amen and it's not always with beauty and and nature and these different things sometimes you're literally just sitting there and something comes to you and you say where did that come from but then you've got a choice is it Godly inspiration or is it Satanic inspiration because there's only two sides two sides right there's God and then there's everything else and see what we've got today is we've got a society that's putting God on a spectrum and that's not the way it works there's God who is truth and then there's everything else and if you mix one thing with truth it's no longer truth truth stands alone it's an absolute it's the standard amen when we look at inspiration you got to remember that Satan remember his name is Lucifer and he was the ministry of worship he was the leader of worship in heaven he knows how to inspire he knows how to get this flesh moving he knows how to get our emotions roiling over in these different things and remember he was thrown out because Pride was in him he made it about himself instead of God and he said I will exalt myself and I will do this and I will do that and so God kicked him out and what did he do he came down here and he perverted worship and what did he turn it into rock and roll rock and roll why is rock and roll so powerful because the master of heavenly worship came down and perverted true worship and he turned it into a carnal thing people will do Insane things under the power of rock and roll absolutely absolutely you know we laugh when our little kids you know you might be walking through the wall through the mall and and you there's some music going and all of a sudden they just start to they can't help it I can't dance because I'm white and German I mean that's like two it's brutal right but they just start moving why there's something about it that catches this flesh it absolutely feeds the Flesh and people will do absolute Insanity under that influence people will rip their clothes off that was the sign of insanity of demonic possession in the Bible was people that took their clothes off and what do people do now they willingly take their clothes off before they even walk out the door but what is it they've gone insane and they don't have a clue why you know I remember a good find of my friend of mine a cooworker in Texas and and uh Selena's first crush at the tender age of four and um he's a wonderful guy very friendly very nice professing Christian well I went over to his house one day to help him work on his pickup truck of course and he was playing rock and roll loud and I got out of my car and I I just listened for a moment and I couldn't tell a word that they were saying genuinely could not and I tried so I said to him I said do you understand what they're saying he says yeah I said repeat the lyrics to me as they sing them and he couldn't do it and I thought why would you listen to something you can't understand and he couldn't tell me why he liked it cuz he didn't know the words but there was something in his flesh that was feeding on it and he was bound by that rock and roll and he couldn't explain it all he knew was that he liked it let me tell you a child of God sometimes we love things and we can't explain it sometimes the word comes over the pulpit and it hurts and yet somehow we love it and we're not sick we're not Twisted it's because we know it's something for us and it's personal to us and it's God that's speaking and God's moving but Paul says cast down imaginations what's that imaginations are things that are not real being presented as real there is no reality to them amen think of a nightmare when we have nightmares it seems so real when we're in it and you can get so overwhelmed and you wake up screaming or you wake up in a sweat or you reach across and you you whack your spouse because you're trying to fight your way out of it it's so real and then you wake up and you realize it ain't real you know I have an interesting thing when I have dreams I have very action-packed dreams but here's the thing I always know I'm in a dream for whatever reason I do and so I can be in the most completely ludicrous life-threatening No Way Out situation and I'm like it's just a dream and it has no power over me it's exciting but it has no power over me but remember the thing of imaginations what we're getting at what Paul's saying he's casting down these imaginations is they're meant to bring fear and fear is rooted in satanic imagination because it's answering questions without any facts that's what it's doing it's presenting something it's answering the what if question with nothing that is proven and he's trying to turn it into a fear amen and and what's his hope his hope is that that fear will destroy your faith in the word of God that's why we have to guard our thoughts we have to be so careful how we think of these things we sit there and let our mind open up you know there's some of you know brother Rick pie over in well he's down in the States now but he was talking to my wife about this because you you know you you you see people that get into these things like meditation and brother Rick was in all sorts of things before he gave his heart to the Lord and he said never ever ever meditate with an open mind because he says there is satanic influence that's just waiting for you to open up we're supposed to guard our thoughts not open up our thoughts we open up to the word of God that's the only thing we open up to and everything else has to go through the filter that we apply which is the word of God every single time he said you would not believe and he's seen it and he's seen the manifestations of what happens when people get into meditation that were previously fine and they come out and they're completely de demon-possessed and they don't even know it they don't realize where these things come from what is it he's trying to get fear into our minds he's trying to bury everything good under a mountain of imagination questions concerns worries stress you know stress is the biggest killer we have right now they are tying almost every major disease back to stress in some form or fashion it's amazing and that's what Satan's trying to do fear is the opposite of God it's the opposite of love it's the it's the absence of God it's the opposite of Faith nothing good comes out of fear unless it's Godly fear and godly fear means respect respect for the word of God Amen fear is satanic at its core because it brings nothing good with it remember brother Paul mentioned this I think in job job said for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble came what did fear do to job nothing good except take away his peace and his rest nothing good came out of it see they say it's it's an evolutionary thing that we have but it's been so blown up now because we don't have saber-tooth tigers running around now we don't have soldiers that are laying in Ambush to to steal our things and our wives and come take our house we don't have it anymore and so Satan has used that because we don't need fear the way we used to he's using it to magnify situations in our life to get us worried no matter what and he's a master at it Jo got caught up thinking about what could go wrong and all of a sudden things went wrong in a real hurry remember we know in 1 John 4:8 it says there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear I so enjoyed that when brother Jerry was preaching on that this last weekend that perfect love casts out fear time and time again when God would come down when he would send an angel to the people the first thing they'd say is fear not don't worry it's going to be okay and then he would tell them to do a very difficult thing and they would go do it because fear had left fear not fear not little flock amen we know what perfect love is it's not a feeling it's a person it's the very Life of Christ it's the holy spirit inside of us amen and the greatest revelation we can have is that we have the Holy Ghost because that tells us we're a child of God the only thing that tells you you're a child of God is when the Holy Ghost comes to live inside of you because there's lots of people will say I believe this but how many of them can live it because the fruit of the Holy Ghost is the word living through you it's not your name on a church book it's not Church attendance those things should all be natural to us but it's the life of the word coming out it's the fruit of the word that's coming out that's what tells us amen that God is vindicating our life by his presence inside of us now listen you might only feel like you've got a bit of it but a bit of God like I said earlier that'll defeat anything that Satan has in your life nothing can stand before God nothing can stand before for him but Paul would warn us about our thoughts because that's the access point for Satan so many times Paul knew that's our struggle day by day is to get our thoughts right we've got to win that inner battle that's the real battle that's as we look at this and The more I've studied this the more I realized that what happens here is so often what determines what's going to happen out there this is not a mind over matter thing listen we're going to go through the trial whether we want it or not but how we go through it will determine is determined by what happens up here listen the the the disciples were killed so many different ways Paul willingly went to Caesar knowing he was going to lose his life but he didn't go fearful and Afraid and scared he went there with the love of Christ in his heart and he witnessed for years and years and wrote most of the books of the Bible while he was in jail and and under house arrest and these different things how you go through it that's what matters not whether you go through it it's how you go through it amen I'm so encouraged by having brother Jim here this morning morning goes through a heart attack you know what you'll find brother Jim is you go to him to encourage him and he ends up encouraging you after having a heart attack that's the way the Believers go through things is that we know there's more to this than just the situation and so we've got faith to keep pushing through amen what happens in the mind we've preached on this before I know but what happens in the mind is it's the gate it's the gate between the soul and the spirit cuz in your soul is where the Holy Ghost is amen that's what seals your soul to the day of your full Redemption when your soul is sealed that's eternal life but this body and this spirit this nature is unregenerated so many times and so what happens is you've got a gate between that soul and the rest of your body and it's the mind and when that gate is opened by faith then the word can come through from the soul because the scripture says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee that's what's hidden inside of our heart is the word and we're feeding that every day by day but what happens is that mind is there and now we've got to fight against reason we've got to fight against logic Common Sense World Knowledge education whatever it might be and what happens is that's Satan's way of shutting that door but when Faith now being built up by our day-to-day living by feeding our experience with God it takes that and it pushes that door open and what happens now is the word can slip through and the Holy Ghost is behind it to make it live in our lives and it brings Victory to us that we can go through the trial that we can go through the test and we can pass it God didn't come to take our tests and trial away in fact he promised the opposite but he promised us we'd have Victory through it all that he'd be with us that we could have the peace and rest and love and joy and these different things amen we have to guard those thoughts but when that faith comes out it's substance remember that's what that's what we're looking for is substance Faith there's a reality behind it so that when the next roadblock comes up it doesn't just back away and say well I guess the word is wrong no it says God started this God's going to finish it and and we keep knocking open those doors and we keep knocking open those doors and going through those walls amen you know Satan likes to beat us up over our mistakes and our flaws amen that's his Focus he will never Focus you on what you're doing right and guess what 99% of the time what we're doing is right and he'll Focus you on the 1% and what's he trying to do he's trying to get you off the mindset that you're a child of God and he's trying to beat us down and comes into a a sort of humility where we say well I'm no good but it's a humility that's based on insecurity that's not humility that's bondage humility is is not us thinking we're no good or of no use humility is realizing that without Christ I have no Eternal use no Eternal value that's it prophet of God would say that humility is compassion humility puts you into action without putting you into it it takes you out of it and it says this is him working not me that's the humility is it's letting him use you and saying I bring nothing to this table except a willing vessel amen that's what we've got to do to paralyze Satan not stand there and argue with them you're not a child of God I am a child of God you're not a child of God I am a child of God you know what you do is you walk away have you ever dealt with somebody that refuses to argue you it's the most frustrating thing when you know you're right it is cuz you're trying to get them to see the light and they just say I'm good where I am and they walk away that's what we need to do to Satan because Satan wants to introduce logic he wants to introduce reason into the equation because he's a master at those he got Eve to turn you give him enough time he'll turn you as well in little areas of your life but if you walk away and say I am a child of God I've been signed sealed I'm being delivered and you walk away you know what happens Satan's the one that starts to get frustrated I feel it's about time Satan started getting a little more frustrated church that we refuse to argue we refuse to let those thoughts come in and we just keep bringing it back to it is written it is written it is written it is written after three times he left Jesus he'll do it to you if you keep doing the same thing you do the the same thing it'll get the same results every single time by the word of God Amen Paul said this finally Brethren talk about guarding our thoughts whatsoever things are true what's true scripture says Thy word is truth in other words whatsoever things are according to the word of God Paul said let God be true and every man a liar that means sometimes I'm going to be a liar if I don't bring my thought subject I've got to take my my own things and say nope I'm going to let the word be true today whatsoever things are honest that means honorable whatsoever things are just that means righteous upright and acceptable to God whatsoever things are pure I love this chased holy clear untainted by our opinion or ideas that takes me completely out of these thoughts he says whatsoever things are lovely whatever is acceptable and pleasing to God then this one whatsoever things are of good report now we think that means that things we only talk about things that are good but what this means is that it is pointing to a testimony the testimony isn't here yet but it's coming it's pointing to encouragement it's pointing to an answer to prayer it's pointing to the good things of God that's what a good report is he says if there be any virtue if there's any strength if there be any praise if there's anything worthy of thanking God for he says think on these things so what is the answer when you're having all sorts of thoughts that are dragging you down it's never going to happen he's never going to answer I'm never going to get healed he's never going to provide think on things that are of God that's specific and intentional and if you don't know what to think take your thoughts out of it and just start reading start listening put on some preaching put on some real anointed music put on something that can take you into the presence of God don't sit there if you're fighting with the thought and you can't win the thought don't think you can fight it just move on to something that will work sometimes we've got to realize there's more to this than I can handle and we need to move to something that's got more strength than we've got at that moment CU we all have weak moments absolutely we do amen but that thing on on good report can I give you an example because it's an example we all know cuz it just happened remember brother Bob sent that email out from from from Sister Becky about that that lady in their church that they had the baby and now it was going into surgery which it came through just fine praise the Lord they told us yesterday came through just fine but remember he sent us and remember it was about the heart problem and he was going to need three surgeries one now one at four and then one a little while later and we can look at that situation and we can say it's sickness it's difficulty there's a low probability of success there's a probability that that baby's going to die and you go into prayer that's not going to work but as I was reading that email I want to share my Approach on this as God is my witness when I read that request and then I wrote back to brother Bob he is my witness I saw the testimony of that baby above all else can I read the words again she said I prayed for a miracle when I worried that I would never be able to carry another child okay there's worry there but she says I prayed and then her next sentence is God heard then she comes to the next one I prayed for a miracle when doctor said our baby would have to be born by C-section and we wouldn't even get to see him before he was taken to surgery oh horrible situation she said God had plans then she says they thought he only had a 20% chance of surviving the surgery and if he did the doctor said his prognosis was only 12 months she said God changed the situation then she said I prayed for a miracle when the ultrasound showed that even still he needed surgeries and couldn't be born too early somehow I carried this child until almost 39 weeks and he is strong she said God cared I talked to them yesterday sister Becky said the child was never going to live and we got down on our knees as a church and we started praying and every time they went back to the doctor the baby was a little bit better it wasn't all in one moment but as it grew God was producing what it needed to sustain life so when I read this this email I did not see a situation that was desperate I saw God hears and answers I hear God has a plan there's a miracle that's just been born so when I go to prayer I don't go and say God the Situation's horrible we need you on the scene I say God there's a good report here already God there's a testimony that's already here and you don't start one to just let it fall flat on his face God continue the testimony continue the plan continue the work that you've already started that's what it means to keep your mind of a good report now Lord Jesus we need you we do need you but we see you here already we don't have to come find you you're in the situation and all we're doing is confessing you're here and we believe you and we're trusting you to do a work Hallelujah that's what it means to have a mindset of a good report and as I prayed the presence of God came down and I just started to weep because I know he's in the house then he's been there all along remember what Moses told the children of Israel he said write a book of remembrance write down I don't have it here it's in my office I've got like five pages of answered prayers some of them impossible from this church alone and you know what when I go to prayer you know what I do I read the testimonies before I go to prayer because it tells me he's an ontime God he does all things well he heals doesn't he sister Justine he provides doesn't he brother Chad he leads he guides he [Applause] spares it's a good report and it sets me up to enter his presence with praise and worship rather than a is this really going to happen that's what the church needs to do this morning that's where my mind went because that is truth that is pure that is good that is Honorable that's of a good report and it was so no surprise then that God had brought him through a surgery of course he did and he'll do the next one and he'll do the next one and he'll be a living testimony of the saving grace of God I believe it with all my heart amen that's what a good report means Church what's our mindset this morning as we start to close is it dwelling on the challenges is it dwelling on the problems is it dwelling on the health issues is it drawing focusing on the marital issues is it focusing on that child that hasn't been to church in 30 years can I give you one more story this morning do you remember David and he's in the land of the Philistines he's completely outside the land and he's fighting for the enemy or they're trying to get him to fight against Israel with the Philistines and he gets away from it he gets away by the skin of his teeth and then he runs back with his soldiers to ziggle which is the home that they had in the land of Philistines and when they get there the city is burned all their children are gone all their wives are gone they they have nothing left and the men are ready to kill him you know what David did David said David encouraged himself in the Lord his god listen I I I think it's wonderful that we've got a God for brother Mark and sister morine and brother Bob and sister Brenda but I need a god of Jonathan klette amen David is in an impossible situation his men that have been so loyal are ready to kill him there's nothing left and they are way behind the enemy it's a hopeless situation what does David do David encourages himself in the Lord his God he starts reminding himself of the change in his life since he got the anointing he reminds himself of all the victories God has given him of all the close scrapes where it seemed like nothing could get him out and imagine God got him out of all the times God brought him through trial after test after trial after situation saved him from other people and saved him from himself and what did it do it built up a faith in David and he said call the priest he says let's go talk to God and he says God do we go after him and God says go after them I will deliver them back into your hands and so he did ran them down saved them all what when all around my soul gives way he then is All My Hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand David was saying it looks bad but it's looked bad before you got to get through a looking bad situation once just to see that God can bring you in but that ought to get you ready for the next one that's coming your way so when it looks worse you can say he's a god of the worse he can still bring me through those things amen we can focus on the mercies on the Deliverance on the Promises of God rather than the situation but you've got to get into those situations you've got to come through those situations so often we're praying God take it away and God's saying I'll take you through it just trust me it's for your good you're going to come out stronger and better than you came through it puts it this way that's the way the Christian ought to do today is keep yourself prayed up under a spiritual atmosphere never seeing the bad side looking to the good side that's a choice that is absolutely 100% a choice that I and you get to make every day where are you going to look he says you are children of God expecting His blessings he'd say last quote never permit a negative thought to come in your mind but I love how he says if you can help it he knows we are just dust never let a permanent thought or a negative thought come into your mind if you can help it he says but when it starts that don't entertain it will you say well I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on and say no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them amen God bless you let's stand this morning musicians would come how do you keep thoughts from roosting you got to start generating other thoughts sometimes we need inspiration it was funny I was talking with sister Moren the other day and you know if you ever you know there's always a go-to song that a minister has that that seems to work no matter what and I told her and she said the same thing Jehovah Gyra is is that song but when I'm fighting about battle you know what I start doing I start singing Jehovah Gyra my provider you are more than enough for me Jehovah Rafa you my healer by your stripes am set free Jehovah sh you are with me you supply my every need you're more than enough more than enough for me we are going to sing that sister Morin if you'll play it softly amen but you got to fill it with something sometimes you don't have inspiration go to where the inspiration is pick up your Bible listen to your Bible Bible we can't always pick it up maybe we're driving that's when we have so much free time sometimes turn it into a moment of prayer turn it into a moment of worship and praise we can't just sit there and let it play out and let Satan have a a party in our minds he'll win that every time if we let him but we've got to push back and cast down imaginations can I share a secret this morning you know how I know what you're thinking [Music] by your [Music] words sometimes people are coming up for prayer and they're already defeated by their words and I know there's a bigger issue there than what they're praying about cuz the Faith's not there their words are words of defeat sometimes we're talking to people and all they can talk about is the problem Satan's won the battle already he's won it up here and there's no faith coming out of that Battleground we've got to bring everything subject to the spirit of God by the word of God Amen we got to fight those things we got to say not today I'm putting my foot down today I'm going to the word I'm going to encouragement call somebody that's positive call brother Joe over say brother Joe encourage me in the Lord start thinking about what God has done for your life I we're going to have a testimony service here in the next week or two God willing on a Wednesday night I want you to be able to hear what God's doing in the lives around you supernaturally and specifically in the different ones so keep that in your mind over the next couple weeks we're going to do that Lord willing but remind yourself what he's done we sing that song Amazing Grace how sweet the sound through many dangers toils and snares we've come through so much and yet something pops up and we completely forget everything God's done for us he's always there always waiting to be called on the scene always waiting for an expression of Faith from his child not a complaint not a worry just a thankful heart that says Lord I'm trusting in you and I've got my life on the line because of it amen sometimes we just need to start speaking Yeah we've forgotten what the power of the spoken word is we can think it all day long we can think about that scripture that I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases but start saying it and it's a whole different thing you know when when I have my devotions I usually pray quietly but sometimes I pray out loud and I find it so much more effective when it's out loud just hearing the things that are coming out of our mouths towards God it inspires Faith amen but sometimes I feel silly cuz I know the kids are coming down and around and these different things and our house is you know you can hear things through the floor sometimes in that not everything I say should be heard by people but sometimes just sitting there and saying what God is doing the things he's placing on your heart it'll encourage that Faith it'll encourage your faith it'll bring you to a place where you can have a breakthrough in that stronghold you're facing amen I say God help me think right Lord help me win the the Battle of this mind because when that's one then I know that everything else it doesn't matter what happens cuz I'm resting by faith in his word amen let's Close Our Eyes each one amen how many would say Lord help me win that battle amen my hands up this morning Lord Jesus Lord we're coming to you Lord you are the author and you are the finisher of our faith Lord this is a work you started and it's a work you're going to finish Lord and I love that your word says it's a finished work Lord that we can look through the eyes of your word and it's already done though there's time left to play out there situations left to play out yet Lord It's a finished work in your eyes Lord if we can only see that by eyes of Faith this morning Lord and bring every imagination and every High thought and every contrary knowledge Lord subject to the truth of your word Lord and then lay it in our hearts Lord and let your spirit just Lord just
