bless you amen i wasn't gonna try it's predestination there i was just gonna leave that alone for now amen and then thank you brother bob and musicians for working through that's one of my favorite songs i believe that's a song written for the bride and the bride alone amen that's not for denominations not it's not for the has-beens it's not for the wannabes that's for the true bride of christ amen anointed word for her day amen if you'll just turn in your scriptures this morning to joshua or this evening joshua chapter 10 thank you musicians joshua chapter 10. certainly welcome the columbo's back and i see brother josh brought uh two wonderful ladies with him amen all the way from france good to see him back and good to see them back as well amen god bless you amen thank you for your prayers for my dad i certainly appreciated that prayer today brother david i spoke with him yesterday and he'd put in nine hours on a skid steer so for you those of you that don't know that's like a it's kind of like a forklift for farm use you know it's got a bucket or a blade on it or that sort of thing so he's he's back in the saddle he did 16 000 steps i think yesterday or the day before so he's he's putting in time on it he's throwing tires around and things so he's certainly on the mend he does have a uh a surgery for one other small thing coming up in a couple weeks but that should just be a day's surgery he'll be in and out certainly within 24 hours lord willing so certainly appreciate that trusting the lord is continuing to work there's some things that my brother shared with us that certainly show there's a difference of of heart there but uh we don't just want to be temporary usually when you have a near-death experience what happens is that you you're you're real close to god and you're thinking deep spiritual things and then you pull away as the shock and the terror of it wears off amen but we want god to do a complete work in his life and then also uh you know never reigns but a poor's blanca's dad was taken to the hospital uh just a couple days ago with some issues with his heart so i believe he went back home today yesterday um but he's got kind of an irregular beat there that's uh causing some fluctuation in the blood pressure and it's causing clots in his in his system so we just want to hold him up before the lord in prayer amen just before we go to the word let's bow our heads lord god heavenly father we ask your grace for this service once again lord amen lord we've all gathered human flesh has gathered lord but without your spirit present lord it's all in vain and so we pray lord you anoint the speaker and the here lord that your spirit would just have free reign in each one of us lord god to encourage us strengthen us draw us closer to you lord burn out more of this world and fill it with your word lord we pray lord just touch your people again we ask lord have your way and your will and your purpose in this service we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you joshua 10 verse 1 it says and it came to pass when adam isaac king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gide gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them that they fear greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than a.i and all the men thereof were mighty wherefore adam isaac king of jerusalem sent a hoam king of hebron and unto pyram king of jarimath and unto jephiah king of lakish and under deborah king of eglon saying look at this isn't working up here just so you know come up unto me and help me that we might smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jamath the king of lakish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it and the men of gideon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thine hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor amen may god bless the reading of his word you may be seated amen we want to continue on our series on the overcomers and i want to take a title tonight of in the line of duty amen in the line of duty and as we set a foundation i always like to do a quick recap to to show how we got where we are and we saw the supernatural crossing of jordan where they were led by the word they were led by the the ark of the covenant with the priests bearing it on their shoulders in obedience to god amen and we know that this was a type of the infilling of the holy spirit and right after that they went to gilgal and that's where all the men were circumcised because they hadn't been circumcised in all the years that they were walking in the desert amen and that's again a confirmation of the type of receiving the holy spirit paul said that our circumcision was the holy spirit and it was the circumcising of our heart amen then after that we saw the supernatural destruction of jericho without siege weapons or tunnels or trickery or or great leadership necessarily but again it was with the word leading the way in full obedience to god and the walls tumbled down and as we spoke before the walls tumbling down is what gave them access to the city because it created a perfect ramp up and over the dirt and the earth that they had built into their walls but we know that in that time aiken sinned and he took the gold and the silver and the babylonian garment and hid it and then we saw the failure of joshua's leadership because he presumed to go to ai and do it the way that the the spies had told him to take it with just a you know 3 000 men instead of seeking the lord and when he did that the lord didn't have a chance to say hey you can't go out because there's sin in the camp so they went out and they lost a few men then they came back and the sin of of akin was revealed and it was cleansed him and his family were destroyed all of his stuff was destroyed outside the camp and then from there we saw the resulting destruction of a.i where god says you don't take just a few you take everybody and you go and you wipe them out and here's the plan that i have for you they went and they did it and ai was completely destroyed and then after that we saw the fear come into the hearts of the gibeonites and they pretended to be from a far country and said we want to create an alliance with you and joshua and the princess said okay we're going to do it and the scripture says they didn't seek god nor the urim thumb amen they went outside they did not seek god they did not ask god what they were supposed to do and in doing so they completely disobeyed the word of god as we read in deuteronomy where he had told moses make no alliance with anyone doesn't matter if they're from your country from your area or not you don't ally with them you set yourselves apart and you set yourself as a people to me don't get tied into worldly things stay away from it and i'll give you everything that you have need of amen and we see now that the truth with the gibeonites has caused a problem for israel because now instead of facing one kingdom they say the gibeonites were a great city it was a royal city and we're going to join together now we're going to band together so because of aitkin's uh you know his failure earlier and then now we have joshua makes another failure with the line with the gibby knights now joshua gets himself in a pickle because he's got five against one now he's got five kingdoms instead of one but one thing i love about this is that each and every one of those kings is a part of the amorite kingdom amen and we know that what they were supposed to do was go when the cup of the amorites was full and then god was going to bring full justice on the amorites so these are part of a condemned people these are part of a judge people they have a prophetic word that's against them and then god says joshua it's up to you to handle this situation now amen i want you to catch something that even though joshua had gotten them in a pickle god's grace was still there to get them out of it amen god's not going to be stopped by our little fumbles by our big fumbles by our big mistakes even amen but rather he'll take them and he'll turn them into a situation to what demonstrate again his power his glory his majesty that he is above and so far higher than anything we could ever ask or think of him amen that he can take the poorest of situations the ways we we just mess things up in life so much and he can take that and he can turn it into a work for his glory and he can magnify himself in front of not only you but in front of those that are around you amen it's not just one on one now it's five kingdoms against one and god says all right we're gonna have a situation here and i'm gonna take care of it but what brought this around was joshua and the princes that had done what they thought best amen they listened to their carnal thinking they listened to the way of man they thought this would be a good idea it never hurts to have some friends god said you're not here to make friends you're here to take the country and then brother branham had this to say he said after being commissioned he failed his commission by trying to do it in the way that he thought was best therefore it teaches us again that we can't take what we think is best or what man thinks is best we've got to take the way that god has said his best therefore to follow the word of the lord is always the best take the way god said amen stay with the word every single time and satan just wanted to get that one word in with eve and ever since then he's just trying to inject one word to get you off of what god has said to do amen if he can get you to just vary by a just the end of a degree just the barest of a degree you'll be off track when the when time comes for the bride to go away man you've got to stay completely with the word amen but we saw as before that after the the issue at a.i and after the gibeonites that joshua never failed to lead them according to the word of the lord there was never a failure in joshua's leadership after that amen and so joshua now comes to this situation and he knows that he has full confidence he should have full confidence in who he is and what he is because there's no sin in the camp he has sought the lord right and he says lord what do you want me to do in this situation he doesn't just presume on anything he comes back he steps back he says god what is your plan for this we read in verse 8 here it says and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee amen look at god's word first thing he says fear them not amen don't worry about it don't have doubt don't sit back and consider the situation he says fear them not even if you haven't seen them you have perhaps an idea of what that army looks like you know that they might have horses and chariots and trained men and giants doesn't matter what you've heard doesn't matter what you see he says fear them not why because i have delivered them into your hand amen he puts it into joshua's hand he doesn't put it into somebody else's and he doesn't say this is for the army he says joshua i have delivered them into your hand personally amen this is your victory that you're going to win you will lead them i am commissioning you to destroy them and i have delivered this enemy into your hand amen when you read that scripture don't think joshua's hand amen think vicial shaw's hand hey man think priscilla coffee's hands think brenda coffee's hand and then think josh columbo's handy man if you serve the save god and you're in the same promise then you ought to have the same result so you can put the exact thing that he said to joshua into your name amen you can write your name into the title and say i'm going to have them delivered into my hand because i have confirmed that he has commissioned me to do what i am doing here today amen i have sought him out and he has told me what to do and on that basis i don't have to fear because he has given into my hand everything that stands before me today amen amen if you serve the same god receive the same message that joshua did what is it fear not for i have delivered them into your hand amen the enemy is delivered to you and you are anointed and commissioned anointed and commissioned to do whatever it takes to destroy them amen brother braham said anything that was included in the atonement is the personal property of every believer when a man gets saved or a woman boy or girl god gives them a checkbook as it was with jesus name at the bottom of every check for anything redemptive blessing that jesus died for it's your personal property don't be afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize it jesus said whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it whatever you ask the father in my name that will i do the unlimited unsearchable riches of jesus christ in that promise amen listen to that the unlimited unsearchable reaches that means you cannot run it you cannot take too much of it you cannot overdraft it you can't think something that's too great for god for you to do amen he says now but before you could do it now god does that then he sends people into the church such as preachers teachers evangelists gifts of healing don't mean the man now can heal you it means that he has faith in what he's talking about and proves it by the bible after that there's prophets that sears all these gifts are without repentance office gifts are sent by god for ordained of god and they're sent into the church they're born in you them traits are born in you when you come into this world you just find your position go on with christ and all those things are in the kingdom of god and it's all for the perfecting of the church and to bring it together amen so we're not just talking about promises now he says now we're talking about commissions right that's what he's talking about we don't want to look at the pro the bible is just general promises this is the title deed for us amen everything in there that you can place in the word for your day belongs to you but he's talking about now stepping into a commission as to something to do for the kingdom of god amen to stand in your place to find your position and on that basis you start using the word now as a weapon to take down anything that would stand in front of you why you're an overcomer that's what we're preaching on is an overcoming series and so if you're an overcomer that means there must be a battle and there must be a victory amen and how are you going to defeat him you're going to defeat him by the word of god and faith in that word of god every single time amen brother braham says oh it's glorious to find your position amen we all say amen but then he says and no one can do anything unless you know properly what you're doing and how do you know properly what you're doing you know when god has confirmed to you this is what i've called you to be this is what i've called you to do and that can only come down on your knees i mean that can only come with a conversation with god on a regular basis lord what would you have your servant to do amen what would you have your daughter to do what would you have your son to do amen in the place that you have put me what do you want me to do for you today amen brother baby says he was god infinite he knowed how it would be he had in his great heart how he would bring all this about and then if he foreknew the church for new christ foreknew the plan and set it all in order and the world turning around and you being dead to yourself dead in christ and alive after you're dead to yourself alive in christ god's working all things together for the good to them that love him and how can you lose amen you just can't lose there's no way of losing why because his plan does not include failure his plan does not include loss his plan includes victory and overcoming amen the church could just really find that out if you could just positionally find your place in christ and all these other things would just fade away like a shadow everyone that cometh to god that's true must have listen to this now must have the shadows the temptations and fears and so forth but just don't get i'll tore up about it what's a little suffering for a little while knowing that the glory of god will be revealed in the last days when jesus comes when we'll be made like unto him amen he's just working everything together he says did you know maybe if you were sick or something happened to you that god might have had to do that just to bring you a little closer to him amen we find that god takes us through a child when god brings victory in our life when god doesn't work and us that's when we're closest is when god is doing the work amen we don't get close to god when we're going through the ease of life amen when the cars never break down when we have the house we want when our health is perfect when we have her at the perfect weight our kids are all saved amen that's not when we're closest to god we're closest to god when he's putting us through something that causes us to rely on him that causes us to seek him amen that causes us to go before his face and say god i need you in a way i've never had you before will you step on the scene amen so let me put it this way as brother braham says maybe your commission is to defeat a certain disease but god's going to have a purpose in that nonetheless then that what is that it is to draw you closer to him amen your commission is to defeat the enemy but the purpose is that god will be made more real in your life amen what you're called to do is tied to the effect that it has on you god doesn't do things for a whim or for no reason but he'll put something in front of you and it's going to draw you closer to him amen amen you have to be able to put yourself into the word of god because as i said that's our title deed amen that's where we are written in that's where our inheritance is that's where we find our identity is in the title deed amen that's how we know what we own that's how we know that we have the right to go claim something that's how we know we have a right to fight for something amen is when we look in the title deed and my name is written in there that's why i said if you're in the same place as joshua put your receive the same message amen write it in write your name in there where joshua's name is write your name in where abraham's name is write your name in where that woman that touched jesus garment is write your name in there why because that's your title deed as much as it is there's amen god didn't write the bible for the unbeliever he wrote it for the believer and it speaks to her in a way it doesn't anybody else because she sees herself in it and then she identifies her purpose and his plan in her life and so on that basis she's able to accept the word of god as it is revealed to her amen amen you've got to have confidence that god has called you and placed you and when you have that confidence now you can start to put the word on your lips you can take it in your heart you can write it on on a piece of paper and slap it on your your fridge amen and read it every day knowing that he's going to bring the past what he's promised on what you've written amen brother braham says now talk about perseverance he moses walked right up into the face of pharaoh and said let them go why he'd talk face to face with god until he had his commission until he had his commission i think if minister brethren today would just not take it from an intellectual standpoint but would find them a place on the backside of the desert on those sacred sands where satan cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief and stay there until a message comes from god and positionally places you in the ministry then all the devils of torment could not shake you from it you know you're called now he's talking about ministers here and you can't fake it amen you can't fake it as a minister you've got to have what you say you have but that doesn't mean that every believer gets off if they're not a minister amen you've got to have what you say you have you've got to know in whom you have believed amen and our faith are in our trusting that he is faithful to finish that which he started in you he says brother branham says that he says i think each christian ought to do that before you come out and confess the holy ghost confess you have the baptism there ought to be such a personal contact with god until all the intellectuals in the world couldn't explain it from you you know you've been there you've had the witness you know it's so amen i can say i know it's so but can you say you know it so young men young sisters young brothers amen can you say i know that i have been in his presence and he has confirmed to me that he has filled me with his spirit that's what he says don't go out and pretend it make sure you've been there you've got to get a personal contact with god that says that i have the holy ghost you've been there you've had the witness you know it's so he says that's a requirement jesus told the disciples you wait you know the intellectual part we know the intellectual part we've had the message for 60 years almost right it's been done for almost 60 years we've had the intellectual part he says you know the word but you wait up there at the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high he says then they knew oh my amen amen that's where we have to place ourselves then they knew you've got to know that you've got what you think you've got amen and then god will confirm it amen amen let's go back to the promise of joshua fear not right they're given into your hand and then he said there shall not a man of them stand before thee so not just given into your hand not just delivered into your hand but he says not a single one of them is going to stand before you when this is all done now to stand before somebody means to be able to repel them to keep them off amen if you can stand up to somebody if a man comes up to me and he stands up to me it means that he gets in my face and i can't get him away right he says no one's going to be able to come up and hold you back joshua nobody's going to be able to keep you from pressing the battle no one's going to keep you from killing them he says what not a single one of them will be able to stand before you the last time they saw this was at the red sea when god said look on them because you'll never see them again after today and then he takes them back and says the same thing that happened there under the waters is going to happen under your sword today amen not a single one of them will be left there won't be a doubt there won't be a fear there won't be a shred of evidence that they were ever here except a bunch of dead bodies laying on the ground to prove that you and god are working together to defeat them amen amen they will be so completely destroyed that they will never again have an influence on you i mean that's a that's the kind of victory we want is it where there is no more influence after they have been killed amen there's not even a memory that holds us back but we move ahead in what the justified nature of a true believer of christ that says under the blood there is no sin that can be remembered amen there's nothing that can hold us back but the braham says in adoption number four he says after i referenced this last week but i want to put it in here he says after the church takes its position we're called to the adoptions of son by the holy spirit and each man takes his position what god called him to do and stand at the end of the road going after the lost amen our goal is to what preach the gospel into every nation now sometimes our nation is just our neighborhood right we're not all called to go out but we're all called to preach the gospel amen with our life with our testimony with our words with our dresses with our hair with our clothing with our habits amen with the way we go to church twice a week come what hell or high water right we go to church especially in newfoundland right what is it they see a living testimony there and then preach the gospel in demons and brother braham says you stand at the end of the road going after the lost you're looking for the last one because when the last one comes in we get to go out amen so sometimes the last one is a member of our family sometimes it might be a neighbor sometimes it might be somebody at our school at our work we don't know amen so we're preaching the gospel every day we're around but this is what i've referenced last time but he said first paul takes all the scare out of it amen there's supposed to be no fear in a believer's life amen he says so now if you're called if you're not just worked up in your mind by some kind of theology if you're really born of the spirit then god predestinated you before the foundation of the world put your name on the lamb's book of life and now we come together to sit in heavenly places in christ jesus a holy people a holy nation of peculiar people we've got to be able to be peculiar and be comfortable with being peculiar amen we've got to be able to have people look at us and say you're weird and say absolutely i am so glad that i am weird compared to you amen without insulting them of course a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices unto god that is the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name so joshua has fear not i've delivered them all into your hands and no man shall stand before thee and then joshua has no concerns now god has told him the order of battle he's told him he's going to win no one's going to stand before them they're all going to be dead no concerns can you imagine having a conversation with god that said today everyone that comes against you is going to fall down amen every sickness that comes against you every demon every oppression every issue that's going to come up you're going to respond perfectly according to the word and it will leave it's there it's there show me in the scripture where ali offered us was that anything but victory right he hasn't ever offered us failure he's offered us victory every single time so no matter what you face every day write your name in like joshua's there and say there is nothing that's going to stand before me today by the grace of god according to the word of god but you've got to be where joshua is and there's no sin in the camp and you've talked to god lately amen and you know what he wants you to do amen he has his marching orders and on those orders he gets a guaranteed victory from god abraham says now if we can find our position and know that it's god's word that has promised it that's the reason joshua and caleb had no fear that they could not take the promised land because all the rest of the other nine came back of the ten and said we can't do it why those cities walled high and we look like grasshoppers upside the people they're so big and they're armed and said we just can't do it see they were looking at the sense of reasoning you can't look at the sense of reasoning you've got to look at the promise of god now god has already sent his angel and the angel was in the camp moving on amen what is it the pillar of fire above them had come down as a captain of the host an angelic being it was christ himself and joshua recognized who that was and that angel was moving that angel was giving orders amen and the revelation of god had brought the word of god manifested hold that for next service the revelation of god had brought the word of god manifested and now they were ready to push into the promised land what was the revelation the revelation was it's time to take the land and what was the manifestation taking the land amen it wasn't god now it was people with god behind them amen that's what we're supposed to do take the revelation you're the bride you're without spot you're without wrinkle you're supposed to go on a rapture and what do we do now we go on a rapture amen he says therefore joshua and caleb knew all promises were to them for god had promised he was going to give them a land what has god promised you amen let's again not leave it to joshua and caleb what has god promised you amen if you're putting your name in there you know he's given it to you so you should have the same confidence as joshua and caleb did amen and then they waited all this time so they knew he was going to give them the land and then they had to wait what 40 years for everybody that was faithless to die out then now it's the time he says and they waited all this time and then after a while the holy ghost came down to moses a pillar of fire formed over them and they followed it and here it was right up at the promised land now ready to push over so he could believe it because god's promises are unfailing they are the truth amen joshua has a clear mandate he has a clear commission he knows where to go he knows who he's supposed to beat up on amen nothing is left unshown to joshua joshua has a very clear direction here there's no doubt in his mind who he's fighting right there's no doubt is who's the enemy and who's the friend amen but joshua's task remember his leadership was in finding what the leadership of god that's what he had to do the the trial for joshua was not to move forward it was to find the leadership and then move forward because otherwise you move forward under what presumption and that's what gets people killed every single time joshua's leadership we read it in the quotes where brother brown said that it was on his knees before that angel before that captain of the host was where he found his position and that was his position then after that he could start to lead them amen amen your position as a father is not to lead the family your position as a father is to do what find the will of god and take that to your family and lead them by it amen your position amen brother gerald's position as pastor is not to lead the church his position is to what find the leadership of the holy spirit and bring that to the church to lead them by that amen amen the song leader when he comes up is to be what led by the holy spirit not sing there's the songs that he likes amen but rather under inspiration to bring what the holy spirit has for the church for that service amen and be able to both create a song list under inspiration and move away from it from inspiration isn't that right brother bob what is my what is my requirement as a minister my requirement is to study and pray that's what the apostles did that's why they brought deacons in the first place was to give them time to study and pray as a minister what i'm supposed to do is study and pray and make myself available to god amen and then it's up to him to lead me to inspire me to give me what he have to i'm talking about me now because i know me i'm not trying to make me into something big amen i'm talking about what i know right my position is to do what my responsibility is make myself available for him to use right find the will of god and then in faith come and bring that to the people my responsibility is not to discern the needs of the people the word does that the word is a discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart now if it's channeled through me then everyone might say that's john that's not john i don't have a clue i don't have a clue amen i can say that the majority of time i don't have a clue if something's going on in terms of something like that but it happens amen and you know god's moving because i don't have a clue about it why because it's the word that's going forth now and all i've done is i've done my part and that is set myself aside study and pray and he said i'll take care of the rest right i've got to keep the sin out of my life amen i got to keep myself quiet before god and then i've got to keep my life sanctified but if all that's done then it's still got to be a work of him i can do all of that and get up here and it's a pointless exercise amen it's got to be him now using me and i've got to step here in confidence that he is using me amen that it is his will for me to be here doing and saying what i'm saying here tonight and not just tonight but every service that i preach amen amen my requirement is to be led and be obedient to that leading that's all i can do amen our position is not to go find a battle sometimes you'll see people and all they're doing is they're looking for a fight every day guess what that's not what we're called to do we're not called to fight a battle men are not we're not called to go find a trial or to go find trouble amen our position is to find the will of god and walk confidently in it and then whatever comes our way we can be confident that he has our back amen that we can speak the word that we can move forward in faith that we can trust that no matter how bad it looks it doesn't matter because i have found the will of god for my life i'm walking in the will of god for my life and therefore he is with me and he's working this out for my good no matter how bad it might be amen and then no matter how good it is sometimes we look at something good and we say oh that means something bad's coming no it doesn't sometimes we rob ourselves a blessing because we think if something's good then we must be doing something bad no sometimes we're on the mountain sometimes we're down in the valley amen sometimes god's blessing us in ways that really help us in our flesh you know sometimes there's lots of money in the bank sometimes the cars aren't breaking down sometimes the house doesn't need repair sometimes everybody's healthy and everybody's safe and sometimes they're not right god gives us valley experiences and he gives us mountaintop experiences amen amen we have to be sure that we found his will and we're walking in it and then everything else just falls right into place behind it look at joshua now so joshua has his commission so joshua therefore came on to them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night so joshua makes a forced march at night to catch him by surprise it says and the lord discomforted them before israel and slew them with the great slaughter at gibeon and chased them all along the way that goeth up to beth horon and smote them at asaka and unto macada and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to beth horon that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto asaka and they died and there were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword have you ever been in a situation and you're fighting and you're fighting and you're fighting and you know you're not getting anywhere and then all of a sudden there's a breakthrough what is it it's god saying hey i'm with you amen it's god letting you know hey i'm by your side i've called you for this i see you struggling here i see you doing your best but this is a supernatural battle and you need supernatural help so guess what the supernatural is here to help you amen you walk into a situation you know it's going to take more patience it's going to take more grace than you think you have and all of a sudden you've got exactly what you need for that situation amen where you can respond to a person in a way that you didn't think you ever could why because god is there to help you through that battle that trial because you're seeking him amen because you're looking for his purpose in the situation amen you've seen it with finances i'm sure as a poor student many times blank and i would literally get down to 10 cents in the bank account with an overdraft about to come in the next day and you pray and guess what brother bob hands you a a letter because they were still getting our mail at the time it's a 110 dollar check a reef a rebate that we didn't know about you know god is always looking out for us and then we do everything we can and then what happens is he comes right over top of it and just does so much more than we could ever ask or think just to show i'm god amen and i'm not just god but i'm your god amen and you're my child amen and that's why you're seeing something that nobody else gets to see that's why the world doesn't have this sort of thing is because they're not my children but you are you're walking in my will and i'm going to magnify the effect of whatever you do amen amen god's grace to us amen look at these hailstones coming down and it says that there were more killed by the hailstones than were killed by joshuas and the israelite swords amen but i want you to notice there are no friendly fire incidents with these hail storms what's friendly fire that's when you get knocked down by your own soldiers isn't it amen god has a way of sending this one down that it doesn't kill any of the israelites running around killing the amorites but it only kills amorites i mean i want to say if you're fighting for the lord you're not killing your brothers and sisters amen you're not stabbing them in the back you're not talking badly about them but rather you're supporting them in the fight aren't you amen you're not killing another brother and sister doing the work of god amen that's up to god to deal with them it's not up to us to deal with them amen you know what's the hardest part about being a part of a group of believers it's not pointing out the faults because satan can do that really well and then you're only as good as satan if you can point out the faults but it's being able to restore somebody in a spirit of humility and meekness because what that is is that requires the christ in you not in them amen and we we duck away from that so often it's so easy to put that other person down rather than push ourselves down and humble ourselves with them so that we can raise them up in a spirit of meekness and restore them to where they were before they ever fell amen that's why we we shy away from it so often is because it requires more of us than it does of them amen because when you're gracious to somebody it doesn't take much for them to respond to it amen but you've got to come into that gracious atmosphere man you've got to come to that place where you've been refreshed remember that daily refreshing we talked about where you've got something to offer to that person now and then so instead of looking down on them you're down there and you're helping to lift them all up again amen it says that he the lord discomforted them before israel that means he disturbed he distracted them they didn't know what was going on they got people stabbing them throwing spears shooting arrows and now hailstones are coming down from heaven and killing them they have no idea what's going on and they're just there's chaos everywhere and so they can't form any sort of a battle plan they can't fight the israelites right god's fighting for them but look at this even after all of this it still isn't enough when we're looking at this battle it's five kingdoms against one and it's still not enough because joshua has to do more amen the sun starts to go down and joshua says it's not enough god you've helped us but we need more that's an incredible thing to say god you helped us but we need more but that's what joshua says here listen to this and then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel so this is in public this is not in his prayer closet he didn't just throw up a quick field tent there and go inside and say i've got to talk to the lord he stood in the site of israel and he said this he said son stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilent he spoke to the heavens in the sight of israel in faith that is incredible that is incredible in full sight of everybody amen if they don't listen he's going to look like a fool but he stands there and he speaks it and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel the lord fought for israel but joshua had to speak yes god was there amen god had helped him but he needed a bit more and god said no problem and joshua returned in all israel with him unto the camp of gilgal it says there was never a day before and there's never been a day since that god obeyed the voice of man like that amen never going to happen again so don't try amen why did god do it why did god do it why did god leave something undone so joshua had to speak and then why did he listen to him in such a great way god's infinite he knows things but i can imagine if you put a team of engineers and said how are we going to keep the solar system in place and not fall apart if we stop everything for a minute for a day it'd take us the rest of our lifetimes to figure out the calculations to see how this could happen but god by the spoken word could stop it in an instant and hold it in place without nature going into chaos because his children had need of it amen listen to what the prophet said he says joshua wanting time he stopped the sun with his own word and it didn't shine and the sun didn't go down for 24 hours the bible said there never was a man before that or after that had ever commanded the sun to stand still that god listened to the voice of a man why he says see he had the enemy all routed that means they were running but was his commission to route them no see they were just they were routed all out everywhere he says he had to hunt them down and kill them he takes them back to his commission what is it no man shall stand before you i've delivered all of them into your hands so he says he had not he wanted to he had that was his commission to hunt them down and kill him that's all there was to it because that was his commission amen joshua spoke because he had a commission to speak and god answered because he had given joshua the commission and he knowed if it ever come night time they'd have a time to mobilize again and get together and he'd lose more men so he said i need time i need light sun stand still amen oh god god listened to a man's word and stopped the sun it stayed in its place same place for 24 hours till he fought weeded out every one of the enemy and brought them down they couldn't they didn't give them a time to get mobilized again he kept moving on so why did god do it he did it because he had commissioned joshua and joshua said look god this is what i need to get the job done you told me what to do you've helped us but we need more so i need the sun to stand still and the moon to stop still i need another day's light to finish the job that you gave me let's finish it here today you told me they wouldn't stand they're running but we got to kill them all because you told me that as well so he said i need the sun and the moon to stand still and he spoke and god obeyed amen amen brother branham says greater was he that was in joshua than the son amen greater than he is he that is in you than he that's in the sun amen amen amen and joshua was a man sin born like you and i yes so no excuses here right our faults our failures our shortcomings has nothing to do with it same thing joshua was amen and greater was he that was in joshua and in the sun that was running by the commandment of god god commanded that sun to shine and turn itself around and it's covered in control by the laws of god but greater was he that was in joshua than the laws of god were because the creator himself was in joshua when joshua looked up to the son and said you stand there where you're at and moon you hang there where you're at till i finish this battle and then it was he said it was god speaking through joshua it wasn't just a man now it was god speaking and then we see that quote when you speak the word for your day what is it it's deity speaking that's what he's saying here joshua was deity in this moment that was god speaking through a man he says and the moon and the son of adam for he that was in joshua was greater than the sun and the moon he that was in joshua amen we spoke last service about grieving the holy spirit we spoke what happens when we let anger and bitterness and offenses and past problems and issues dominate our lives and then it pushes the holy spirit away you can't do this sort of thing when that's around you and then you can't do that when you've got those things circling around when you've got issues and unresolved problems and then when you've got bitterness and anger amen none of these things are going to allow you to speak the word amen that's for sure and then joshua knew that his life was clean he knew that there was nothing to hold him back there was no barrier between him and god and he was able to speak those words amen amen it's not that you've lost your place amen you're still a believer you're still a child of god but when you grieve the holy spirit it makes it ineffective and then god just can't come near to you and then his presence can't be loosed in the way that that we need him to amen amen remember as we talked about when we've renewed ourselves daily in that loving grace amen when forgiveness is coming out of our lips amen with mercy when we're humble amen when we're seeking the will of god that's when these sorts of things happen is when we're laying ourselves before god and saying god what do you want me to do amen lord what's your plan for me what's your purpose for me where do you want me to be what do you want me to do with my life with my gifts amen there's no barriers with joshua joshua the lord had told him you're good to go bud and he went and he went and he went until he finished the job in it pray for my voice amen braham says this as long as you are in the line of duty and what's the line of duty he says keeping god's word amen doing just what he told you to do marching by the orders of god you've got a right to say to that mountain be moved read again keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do marching by the orders of god you've got a right to say to that mountain be mood god keeps his word so if you're keeping his word then he's going to keep his as well amen that's the way it works when you're in his word then he can keep it really easily can't he if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have that what you have said jesus said that in saint mark 11 22 that's the truth i know that's the truth it's god's word and that proves that it's the truth we're just afraid sometimes we get to a place we're afraid he won't keep that word he will keep that word he said he would do it he says now we find that's true he proved it i believe that's why moses had them write a book of remembrance we do well sometimes to write down the things that god has done in our lives so that when the the discouragement comes up and when we start wondering and questioning things we can look back and say look what the lord has done amen and not to somebody else only but to me and to my family and then to those i love and those that i'm close to not just in some power church or power ministry but right here in our midst amen amen so the challenge to do is therefore for us is to do what find ourselves in the line of duty ask yourself am i in the line of duty the challenge to find our position to know completely and assuredly that we are in the will of god and when you've got that then anything is possible right anything is possible but you've got to find your place amen we'll jump back to ephesians to see what paul talks about before we close this out amen ephesians chapter 3. if you want to turn i've got it here ephesians 3 hang with me i'm in ephesians 3 verse 1 says for this cause i paul the prisoner of christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given to me to you word how that by revelation he may known unto me the mystery as i wrote before in a few words whereby when ye read when you read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ man we covered this before and our portion of the mystery of christ is the manifestation of the sons of god what was joshua doing that day he was a manifestation of the son of god wasn't it sons of god not the son of god i guess it was in a way but sons of god he was what acting as a child of god in his god-given position amen so our part of this is not just to understand it but to have a reality of it amen and this is what paul's talking about ephesians is all about the manifestation of the sons of god and how it looks and what god's doing to bring it about verse 5 says which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power we talked about effectual working name and it means it's effective unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent so there's a purpose that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord i mean this is not something he came up with on a whim just recently you know after the jews turned him down he didn't say well now i'm going to go to the gentiles no it was an eternal purpose amen this is something that he foreordained a long time ago now watch what this eternal purpose looks like it says in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him now it's one thing to have boldness we got a lot of bold people in the world a lot of people asking for things expecting things amen that's bold but he says you don't just get boldness with this now you get access i mean you get to come before the one that can give you what you're asking amen like esther right if anybody else if anybody came in the king could say off with her head or he could extend the scepter but when esther came in she always got the scepter why because she was invited amen he wanted her to be around him and then she was his wife and so anytime she came in he extended that scepter and it's the same thing for us is that we don't just have boldness now because boldness will get you killed right you step into the king's presence back in esther's day and without him wanting you there then you died amen but paul says no i didn't you have boldness in this but i've given you access as well christ has given you access to him to what the unsearchable riches that we just spoke about amen wherefore i desire that you faint not in my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole heaven whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man amen our strength is supposed to be inward before it ever comes outward amen when you're strengthened in the inner man when you are sealed with the holy spirit that's what it says to be strengthened with might by his spirit this is not an outward working this is an inward working that has an outward effect amen that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that's where our strength is faith of the holy spirit that's dwelling inside of us and it has this effect what is it that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height now comprehend means to understand but it does not just just mean to understand intellectually but this is a comprehension that comes by a reality by an experience of what he's talking about amen the holy spirit is not just an esoteric thing you know we talk about and it's this intellectual thing but it is power and demonstration in your life amen there is a strength that comes with this it is not just a conversation it is not just doctrine it is not just i know the message and i believe god sent a prophet but it is an experience that causes us to understand by reality what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god it surpasses knowledge is what he's saying there that it goes beyond just knowing it by an intellectual conception as brother branham says so often and now to come into the reality of the love of christ through the holy spirit in your life amen now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above what a line exceedingly abundantly so exceedingly means way more than you think and abundantly is way more than you need and above means higher than anything that you can put before him exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages the world without end amen he says we give glory to the one that is able is he able amen is there any lack of power is there any lack of willing god is there any lack of intent is there any lack of desire in him to do that which is exceedingly abundantly above which we could ask or think paul says there isn't right there's no lack on god's part so it's only up to you how high can you think how magnificent can you make your request god says i'm still higher and above that i'll do it beyond what you can ever ask or think amen he is both able and willing to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think paul says so you can imagine something within the confines of the word that god can't do better than you think he can do it that's what he's saying the greatest dream or vision or anticipation you could ever come up with of something that god wants to do for you he says god will do even higher than that you can't even comprehend how far god can and will go to bless his children within the confines of his word amen but notice here he doesn't say this is something outside of us and that's half the problem is he doesn't say it is the power that worketh on you he said it is in the power that worketh in us there is something within you that triggers this there is something within you that draws this there's something within you that is able to do what you're asking amen we're supposed to pray to the god that is within us amen we sometimes think he's out here and we've got to pull him in he's right here amen if you've got the holy spirit he's walking with you every single day and you don't have to pull him down amen you know what brother brahm talks about david and he says david didn't have to get prayed up david was prayed up let me tell you today for the believer in the new testament you don't have to bring the holy ghost down the holy ghost is with you all the time amen why because you're a child of god and god is with you everywhere you go now the effect of it like we said you can you grieve and push them away but if you are walking the way you're supposed to be walking you're under that shed blood then he is with you and in you every single day no matter where you go or what you do amen amen there's a force greater inside of us that is greater than anything you could ever imagine amen it is driven by love that's what he says here the love of christ that is driven by love and it is operated by faith amen and it is experienced by the true believer amen you say i have a need brother jonathan if you can think it he can meet it amen if you can imagine it make it as big as you want he can still meet it make it worse than it is and he'll still exceed it that's what he's saying here exceedingly abundantly above what you could ever ask or think the only question is are you in the line of duty that's what he said are you in the line of duty if you're in the line of duty then speak the word it's that simple are you in the line of duty are you where you're supposed to be are you doing what you're called to do amen amen i want to ask you this so how can you be in the line of duty if you're not at your post of duty what did brother brown say the post of duty was you look up post of duty and every single time as far as i could tell brother brahm says the post of duty is to be there when the church doors open amen okay i'm obviously preaching to the choir amen but there's lots of people listening to this if you are not at a post of duty then how can you be in the line of duty amen unless you're called to be out there preaching you've got to have a post of duty you've got a local church a local body that you need to be supporting amen now we're not talking about people that are bound by health issues and things like that remember we're talking about you i have a capability to go and support a local body you need to be doing it and if you can't do it where you are go someplace where you can amen that's hard but it's true amen and that's the prophet of god said that go look it up in your in your search tools and look up post of duty and every single time he says your post of duty is to be there when the church door is open you've got to have a local body that you're supporting not just with your ties and offerings but with your presence right coming through the doors raising your voice raising your hand right encouraging others being a part of the local body amen i read a story i read a story where brother branham is talking about a guard in the civil war and he was on general grant side he was on the northern side and he was kind of twitter painted and he was a century and he was on duty and what happened was he was he was supposed to be on picket duty and he walked away to pick some flowers for his sweetheart brother branham said and what happened was a spy got through the line where he was supposed to be realized that grant's army was half the size of the rebel army and so he got back over and they charged and they they destroyed grant's army there they pushed him back and brother bradham said they shot that man within an hour why listen to this but the gerald's been saying this this is in my notes before he ever said it and then i think god's trying to tell us something he says it wasn't he's speaking of the century now they didn't have a problem with him picking flowers it says it wasn't what he'd done it was the things he didn't do amen he didn't stand to his post of duty he didn't guard the post like he was supposed to and he spoiled the whole thing and that responsibility lies tonight at the life tabernacle and other tabernacles and churches in shreveport louisiana it ain't what you're doing then it is what you're failing to do he says let's do something about it let's dig with all our hearts that when that day of judgment comes we can say god i did the very best i could and you know i did amen when we know what we can do that's all that's expected nobody begrudged the young man a chance to get some flowers for his sweetheart but he caused a defeat by leaving his post of duty he says it wasn't what he did that was the problem is what he didn't do which was stay at his post of duty amen amen paul's saying if you're at the post of duty you're in the line of duty then the power that works in you is at your disposal and god will back it up every single time amen let's do it look at a few examples as we start to close here this evening he says and now here was moses that went down within his own intellectual affair or intellectual achievement to try to under a military force bring out israel and he failed to do it same way it works for all of us under your own intellectual conception it never works and you'll fail to do it and then you'll finally go to god but just a word from god on the backside of the desert boiled the whole thing up again what happened to moses he got his glasses focused god's only purpose wasn't to marry this beautiful ethiopian colored girl back there and to settle down and have children and raise his father-in-law sheep but his mission was to deliver the children of god out from under that bondage that's what his his that was his commission that's what he was born for doesn't mean you can't have a family but he says that wasn't his commission his commission was as a deliverer and each one of us is born for something we just wasn't put here for nothing that mountain never happened out there just to be that tree was put there for a purpose he says you always talk about the fig tree that he spoke to and he says the mountain that you got to speak to he says that mountain wasn't put there just to be a mountain he says everything is for a purpose it's got to serve and we are here for a purpose maybe it's to testify to one person and get them saved and out of that might come a preacher that will send a million souls to christ one person is worth a thousand worlds a million worlds amen one soul if you bring one soul to christ amen that's worth more than anything else amen so we've got something to do and guess what a believer can't say well i'm just a husband or i'm just a wife or just a mother or just a father or just a janitor amen there are no just in the body amen because if god has called you to do it he's called you to be a supernatural whatever it is that you're talking about amen a supernatural father a supernatural mother a supernatural preacher a supernatural janitor a supernatural this or that why because you're an overcomer and you're supposed to be different you're supposed to be better than anyone else out there when it comes to these things amen not as the world would would measure it but as god would measure it amen amen so you're not just that it's like i said before if you're married your first ministry is to what your wife and kids and then if you're a wife then it's to your husband and kids if you're a husband it's to your wife and kids that's your first ministry amen and within there brother branham has pointed to he says it's a powerful thing now he says there might be one man that gets one person who gets saved and that's a preacher that saves a million souls but watch what he says about moses mom he says remember when moses was a little boy it was a mother who gave him his instruction it was a godly mother who took little moses on her knee and said moses and taught him all he was her teacher or she was his teacher rather under pharaoh and said now those things they said moses someday you're going to deliver the children of israel and you're the boy that's called keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world for you're the one you're the one remember we're talking about overcomers and in the line of duty and we're talking about mothers now okay pay close attention mothers no other place do we know where he ever went to any seminary any teaching it all that he ever got he says his mother is the only one he stayed right in pharaoh's palace which was a heathen but his mother taught him he said that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the lord she taught him how he must be holy she told him how and what he must live and how what god must do or would do for him and it stuck with moses all the days of his life he didn't just go out and try and be a deliverer on his own amen it was an intellectual conception but somebody had fed him this and he says it was his mother and any good true loyal mother that'll take her little babies instead of sending them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that and she'll put them on her lap and teach them about the lord jesus christ what's he saying one man amen your mother's what did he say you could raise a preacher it doesn't have to be a preacher though it could be a man that goes to work every day of his life and lives a testimony and maybe brings one of his co-workers in amen every soul is invaluable amen it's not whether we bring in a million but we want to bring something don't we amen that's a jewel in our crown for him amen so now mothers which is what we're speaking about when something comes against you in the line of duty what is it that holds the line right when something comes up against you in your day with your children maybe in your day with your husband when something's pushing in what is it that holds the line and says whoa whoa whoa what are you doing here what is it that rises up within you is there a power within you that steps up and says hey how'd you get in here this isn't your property or do we step back amen and is it despair or anger or depression that starts to work its way inward is that what rises up within us when these things happen amen amen when the kids just won't settle down when the baby won't go to sleep what is it that rises up it is is it the power within us or is it that despair that says here we go again amen amen or have you continually renewed yourself as we spoke about in the word of god and so what comes up automatically is something that says this isn't the way it has to be i mean this isn't the way it was meant to be we still have trials we read earlier and shadows and difficulties but what is it that's going to push him out is not depression what is going to push it up is is not just okay well here we go again that's not going to do it that's going to invite it to come in a little further and a little deeper amen amen you're a daughter of the king amen your husband has authorized you in your home to do whatever it is that you need to keep it a place of peace and rest while he's gone to work so you get to speak with your husband's authority which is under god's authority to any situation that comes into your home amen and listen it doesn't have to be some big thing when jesus defeated satan he only used the word and brother brahm says he did that so that the weakest christian could understand that they could defeat god they could defeat satan amen brother brother mark shared something with me from brother lonnie jenkins where he said we don't just rebuke satan but we rebuke him by the word of god amen because the word is our authority and so when jesus did it he said get thee behind me satan for it is written amen for it is written for it is written and he went right to the word and said what word give me i have authority through the word and i'm going to let that push satan back amen so when satan comes in you take that word and you just put it right in front of him and say satan get out of here because what greater is he that is in me than you amen the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness these different things i mean and you take that word and you push it and you push it and you push it and all of a sudden satan says i don't like it so much around here it's a little spiritual it's a little holy feels a little too joyous for me in this house i think i'll go try somebody else i'm going to go for easier pray man your house is your domain sisters your husband has made that your domain and you have the right to push anything out that comes in it amen but you've got to feed yourself in a way that will help you to do that every single time amen you're in a commissioned position you're in a commissioned position i think sometimes our sisters they don't realize what they've been given and then brother brown called you guys the fifth gospel you mothers fifth gospel he never called us that amen listen you're in the bride position everything we're talking about today is the bright position well guess who's the bride the sisters so if you have if we have a a a duty if we have a commission if we have a right as the bride of christ and as your as the bride of your husband you have the exact same rights in your home amen amen listen to this fathers you have the same authority obviously but fathers make sure you didn't let in what she's trying to kick out and then cause the buck stops with you so if there's something that you're dealing with make sure that you haven't let it in and then your wife's got to deal with taking it out again every single day man he says lebron says i can see shamgar standing there he looks out oh my his righteous indignation began to come upon him he got a little fight in him that's what you got to get is a little fight a little backbone take that wishbone out and put a backbone in that's right i think old buddy robinson his testimony said lord give me that backbone like a solog give me plenty of knowledge in the gable end of my soul and let me bite the devil as long as i got a tooth in my mouth and then gum him till i die what's that that's a never give up attitude never stop fighting never stop pushing never let satan have a moment of rest in your presence that's right that's the way to do it brother get some spunk about it stand up and claim your god-given privileges god promised you healing it's yours if you're too weak and jellyfish to take it you'll die you want to stand and say it's right and then stand he says hallelujah little old sham guard got his righteous indignation up we're allowed to have righteous indignation friends amen when we see the word saying one thing in our life saying another we have a right to say no enough amen enough he looked around he couldn't find nothing he wasn't a warrior why he's looking for a weapon they'd taken all the weapons he says but what was in his hand do you remember somebody else that got asked what's in your hand who's moses god said what's that in your hand he said a stick that became god's stick of judgment friends whatever you're holding in his presence he'll allow you to use on a on an enemy every single time he couldn't find nothing but an ox code he says you know what an ox goat is goat is it's an old stick that's got a big old brass lump on it they push the dirt off the plow and sometimes punch the cattle through the gate with it that's all he had but brother he was sick and tired of the philistines coming and taking what he had now we're talking about philistines that have spears that have swords that have shields that have metal armor that have helmets and he's got an ox gold piece what about yay long with a blunt end a blunt end not even a sharp end a blunt end he says he got enough though he had enough he says oh my aren't you tired mother aren't you sisters sick and tired of the devil telling me that i can't walk i can't do this i can't do that he says god bless your heart all things are possible to them that believe that's it shamgar said i'm sick and tired of it i'm not a warrior the odds are against me but no matter how much odds is against you god's for you if you take his word he said there's one thing i know i am circumcised i am an israelite that is an uncircumcised philistine i know that i'm right i'm a child of god tonight and i know diseases come from the devil and i know god promised me victory few brother he says i wish you felt like i did right now yes sir i feel awfully good look it's my god-given privilege yes sir i'm still tonight in america in canada where i can preach it and enjoy it thank the lord for it he says his righteous ignignation rose he grabbed that ox goat and jumped through the window and challenged 600 philistines and stood there and beat their heads in jumped through the window and challenged 600 philistines and beat their heads in right why not a warrior not at all but he was an israelite he was circumcised he was a believer he had the holy ghost and if tonight you're circumcised with the holy ghost you don't have to wait till you're trained to be a warrior god bless your heart claim your god-given privilege and beat their heads in amen that's right say get out of the way satan kick him out of the way i'm the guy that's taken over now i come in jesus name watch him scatter brother when you use that faith on him he will back up amen hallelujah when you use that faith on him he will back off well brother jonathan i've always had this problem i was born like this my family always has this i've always dealt with this i'm not cut out to do this i don't have what it takes listen are you called to be who and what you are are you called to be who and what you are if you could say yes by the word of god then he says take that faith and he will back up amen he says beat his head in with it amen we all have a position to fill not in the church in terms of a deacon trustee pastor minister these things but we all have a position we all have a gift to supply the body with something every single one of us there is not one single person here old or young male or female that doesn't have a purpose for being here today not a single one and if you are standing in that whether you are a typically a mom at home or whether you are the pastor standing behind the hope but on a regular basis there's no difference when you know you're doing what he's told you to do then he says have that faith he'll back up or you'll beat his head in amen amen listen to this samson never cried to god he used his anointed gift he know that he was sent for the job he knowed he was born for that he knowed he was anointed with a gift and he beat down a thousand philistines he didn't cry to god god ordained him and vindicated that he was by the other things he had done he was a vindicated anointed servant of god to destroy the philistines and he did it it's that simple he was anointed to do it so he did it no matter what the circumstances was he did it he never asked nothing he that was his job can we get a revelation that we don't have to ask to do what god has told us to do you don't have to say lord am i able to beat the devil's head in today lord am i able to beat depression today lord am i able to beat this disease lord am i able to beat this situation lord am i do i have to ask to put money in the bank no lord i need it lord you told me to do it i'm doing it samson didn't ask he just did it because he was commissioned to do it amen he never asked nothing why that was his job that god was dealing through him he picked up that mule bone and got to beating philistines he never asked nothing you know why he didn't have to ask scripture says the spirit of god dropped mightily on samson how many times can you say the spirit of god has dropped mightily on you it happens doesn't it and you know exactly what's supposed to happen and you know exactly what you're supposed to do and the question is will you do it amen if you've got the holy spirit you know what it's like to have god drop down in a room and you know what's happening amen doesn't happen all the time and i believe the closer we get to the end the more we're going to experience it because we've got to be closer to him than we are to the world amen we've got to have that that clarity of relationship with him right so this is something i'm not preaching as if i've got this folks but i'm saying this is the standard i mean this is where we're looking this is what we're praying for this is what we're expecting in our lives amen is to have that closeness of relationship to where he speaks and we make the move and we don't have to hesitate or wonder amen amen like i said before there's no bluffing satan you've got to have what you say you have but when you start moving he starts moving amen because god's pushing them back amen they're on your territory and god has said none of them can stand before you listen to this jesus spoke and the blind saw the lame walk the deaf heard the devil screamed and come out the dead was raised up and everything why he didn't pray through he was anointed the messiah he was that messiah he knew he was he knew his position he know what he was sent to do he know that the father had identified him to be the messiah to the believer and when he met that believer with faith he just spoke the word devil scattered yes sir speak don't cry speak amen this is from the message why christ speak he says and he knew his god-given rights but we don't i would say intellectually we know them but remember we've got to know them by revelation because revelation is what makes the word manifest he knew what he was we don't this is 1963 after the seals okay he knew his god-given rights but we don't he knew what he was we don't he says moses had forgotten samson understood others understood joshua understood moses forgot god had to call his attention to it he said why are you crying to me i sent you to do the job speak and go on to your objective i told you you'd come to this mountain take them children lead them on just speak i don't care what's in your way move it out of the way i give you authority to do it you spoke in flies and fleas and creation and things like that now what are you hollering to me about why are you coming to me hollering these things just speak and watch a move that's all he says oh my oh how i love it god had honored everything he said and he was called for the job so why did he have to say what must i do there was a need there was a need not a lust of the eyes not a lust of the flesh not a thought of his own conceiving but there was a need in the line of duty amen there was a need it was just up to him to speak for it god wanted moses to put that gift of faith that he had given him to work god had vindicated it it was the truth and god wanted moses one of the people to see that he was with moses can you imagine yourself doing better can you imagine yourself with more patience with more grace with more humility with more strength with more discernment all these different things amen can you imagine it god's willing to give it to you when there is a need amen god doesn't just dump things there for no good reason he doesn't just fill you up so that you can walk around with a proud look amen but when the need comes then what happens is the spirit that worketh in you rises up to match that and it says exceedingly abundantly above it overpowers it over reaches whatever is standing in front of you amen so when you look at your situation you have to say what is the need that's what he said that's what he said about moses here he says what there was a need what's your need then he said speak amen he says and what god vindicated it amen god wanted moses to put that gift of faith that he had given him to work same thing for the bride he's given each one of us a measure of faith not all the same it'd be nice if it was all the same but we're going to get into it a bit later about what he says about those gifts and why they're given amen but each one of us is given a measure of faith and he says use that gift of faith and i guarantee this he will give you the measure of faith required to make it happen according to his word if he has told you to do something if he has promised something he'll give you the faith to take it amen amen i look at shamgar what did he have to use the only thing he had was an ox goat what do you have to use i don't mean to poke what do you have to use amen some of our sisters especially have a gift of singing guess what your weapon is probably going to be singing amen worship amen when satan comes in like a roaring lion what are you going to do you're going to raise up with what a song a praise amen the same anointing that comes on you here is going to be on you back home amen the same gift is there the same spirits there it has the same effect amen amen i love it when i go in a house and what i see is scriptures written and posted on the fridge you know why because something spoke to you about that and said this is for me and you put it up there and guess what when satan comes into the house and starts talking you don't have to go very far you just have to walk right over to that fridge and start reading that out amen and say satan get out of here and you start reading that scripture amen and what happens he can't stand there he can't stay in the presence of the word for long drives them nuts especially when it's spoken by a faithful heart amen filled with the holy ghost and expecting him to move on amen make it easy on yourself take what you have at hand but make sure you got something at hand amen sometimes i think we wanted to to have this great gift to somehow somehow do something to take it out listen if shamgar can use an ox gold you can use anything he's going up against armored soldiers and he beats him with something that shouldn't even be a weapon right take what god has given you if moses can use a stick you can use whatever he gives you amen paul and silas use this song right there they're fully chained up in prisoners chains with bleeding stripes paul and silas sang that night and in their pain or pray that night and in their pain began to sing their chains were loosed and they were free right they praised and worshiped and that was a weapon to what bring them into freedom i meant samson used a dry brittle donkey skull should have broken on the first hit on a brass helmet and yet he killed a thousand philistines with it he took was that what was it was it handy man david used a sling against an armored warrior but it was what it was something he was familiar with it was something that he'd used before amen that's what you've got to be you've got to be familiar with what god's going to use amen it might not look like much but if you're familiar with it god can do some tremendous damage on the enemy amen he'll push him back if you'll take it there was moses he's continuing on he says abraham seed and when he did he came to the gate in a line of duty he came to the gate of the red sea after teaching the people of israel of the promised land that god had promised he was god's prophet he had been manifested before the people as god's prophet god created by him god did all kinds of signs and wonders by him and he stayed just exactly with god's word because he sought god first that's the key because he sought god first he didn't seek man and he didn't seek himself but he sucked god and he knew his position he knew he was born for that age to manifest the word of god at that time if you get nothing else out of this then pick that one he was born for that age to manifest the word of god at that time that's the same thing it's got to be for you and i that you are born to manifest the word for this age and then right in the line of duty he come up against something that he know not what to do and that was the red sea well what happened the seed of abraham was promised to possess the enemy's gates so when the red sea became a gate that he couldn't come through god moved upon the scene and took the gate and went away with it and moses walked across on the sea on dry land his seed possessed the gate amen amen again it comes back to you've got to know who you are and what your place is it says moses knew his position and knew he was born to manifest the word for his age you've got to believe that what you're talking about that what you're dealing with is going to require a manifested word situation amen amen you will question your rights you over question your pers your personal property if you don't know that you're on something that belongs to you if you see satan on something you're not sure that's your property you're not going to fight the same way but if you know if you know and you know and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that that belongs to you you will fight until you can't fight anymore and guess what he's going to give up before you do where god says it why you're an overcomer satan's not an overcomer you're the overcomer amen you've got to be settled on your calling and position why because otherwise what does uncertainty point to doubt uncertainty points to doubt uncertainly points to gray areas and certainly points to a question that hasn't been answered to your satisfaction and so you back away and say maybe this wasn't really mine my mistake i was going to step back and let you have it no but if you know that you've got a title deed to that doesn't matter what he says your name's on the title deed and you say sorry but title deed says this is mine i'm going to fight for it as we start to close brother braham says now i want you to notice when a man hears the voice of god personally here's the word of god now you can hear it you say well god has to come to meet me yes sir i could sit here and preach till i fail dead in the pulpit 10 20 30 50 years from now you never hear it until god reveals the word to you you can sit right in your seat you don't have to be by a burning bush maybe you're closer than you think you are just sit there and let god speak to you in the word amen you have to be in the prophet's presence for this to happen you just have to be in the presence of god amen and then you have to be in the presence of the holy spirit moving through his word he says i don't care how old you are that don't have one thing to do with it that's great if you're old and that's great if you're young it's great if you're in between amen there's no limit here the day that god could get you quiet enough to speak to you and you can hear his word that's the day he's talking to you no matter your age today is a day of talking this is an age where everybody has something to say and they won't shut up social media is rife with this amen everybody's got an opinion and they feel we all need to know it and everyone is right and therefore everybody's wrong you think about it everybody's right then everybody's wrong because they don't agree with each other amen but he says the day that god can get you quiet enough to speak to you and you can hear his word that's the day he's talking to you no matter your age but when god talks to a man and has got the voice of god in him and the word of god in him he said if you abide in me john 15 if you abide in me and my words in you you can ask what you will and it'll be done to you see there's nothing uncertain it shall be done that's right nothing uncertain amen let's get quiet before god amen let's get quiet before god and say lord what would you have to say i've talked a lot i've thought a lot studied a lot read a lot listened to a lot of services lord but what do you want me to do what's your purpose what's your plan for me amen amen as we close brother braham says this this is a closing up and why christ speak he says oh it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days to find out that all these signs that we see taking place that spoke of in the scripture would take place in the last days all the way from heaven to political powers to the nature of the people and the demoralization of the world and among the women and how they would do in the last days how the men would do and how the churches would do how the nations would do and how god would do and we see it all laying right here on us this is 1963. imagine what it is in 2021 by comparison you talk about sodom and gomorrah it is i i gotta think we're past i gotta think we're past at this point amen but he says it's political it signs in the heaven it's the nature of the people demoralization and then he says women and then he says also men because that's where we're at is it's men and women that are both messed up right it's not just the loss of the morality of the women now the men have gone to equally bad if not worse right the whole thing but he says it anoints us when we see this happening because what that means that our time is here right because that's when the son of man is supposed to be revealed and he already was revealed but that means after that the only thing left is a resurrection and a rapture amen now listen to this he says oh it anoints our faith does it anoint your faith when you read the news when you see the latest travesty the the insanity the immorality does it anoint our faith or does it drag us down and say oh yet more to deal with brother brahm says speaking to believers it anoints our faith he says it moves us out in great cycles to what what what great cycles does it move us out into he says see it separates us from the other things of the world see no matter how little we are how much a minority we are how much we're laughed at made fun of it doesn't make a bit of difference that's all we see it there's something within us we were predestinated to see this hour and there is nothing going to stop us from seeing it why that great cycle of what resurrection is coming around again amen two thousand years ago and it's coming again again and he says our faith is anointed to lift us up into the great cycle yet again he says amen here god has spoke it it's already happened we see it oh how we thank god for this oh then it brings out your faith when we see these things happening here amen god bless you you'll stand and the musicians would come amen do you want faith how many want faith i want more faith i want way more faith than i have did brother brown say find your position be sure that you're called to be where you are doing what you are when you are and when you can do that you're in the line of duty he says and the word will back you up every single time amen find your place make sure it's the right time doing the right thing he says in the word we'll back you up every time amen if you're in that word victory is yours we're supposed to be manifesting the word that's what we're called to do the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god is to manifest the word for their day amen and that means that as he's appointed you as he's called you as he's commissioned you when you can find that and stand in it then god is going to come back time and time again abundantly exceedingly abundantly above what we could ask or think amen to meet the need and to meet the challenge for our day amen god bless you let's just bow our heads oh god i'm thankful for your grace or to help my voice to push through on this service lord we're thankful for the tremendous challenge that we've seen here and lord we speak not as if we have attained lord we've seen your grace we've seen you're moving we've seen your power in our midst amen but lord we desire a greater lord a greater walk lord a greater surrender lord so that when the need arises lord we're confident that we're where we need to be amen and lord it is not by any great thing that we do or say lord but it's only under that shed blood that we can have that confidence the lord we pray lord that as your prophet said that it would anoint our faith and cause us to come further away from the things of the world lord that that word will become so so common and ingrained to us lord that it's the only thing that can come out of our lips that can come out of our lives lord that can be expressed in our actions lord we pray your holy spirit to just anoint your people lord give us strength for battle lord encourage us lord help us to recognize that this battle is not of men lord but it's a spiritual battle fought by spiritual people with spiritual weapons and lord we've got a supernatural god that's there to defeat every enemy behind that's ahead of us lord lord help us to find our place lord help us to rest in it and to trust you for the results lord we pray your grace to us now in jesus christ's name we ask it amen do we know that some bigger than any mountain [Music] it's going to be too high for me no matter what so i'm going
