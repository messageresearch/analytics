[39:35] bless him certainly much appreciate to
[39:49] be a part of your Easter meetings it's
[39:51] not exactly the way I would have
[39:53] anticipated it if somebody said I was
[39:54] going to preach them but I'm certainly
[39:56] appreciative to brother Gerald for the
[39:58] invitation appreciate Matt taking the
[40:00] time to work out the technology and kind
[40:02] of get us all synched up here most
[40:05] people don't realize how much work goes
[40:06] into something like this especially the
[40:08] first time so I'm just trusting that all
[40:11] will go well and we've got everything
[40:12] synched up
[40:13] if you'll turn in your scriptures this
[40:15] evening to revelations chapter 12 again
[40:18] it's just it's good to be here I I
[40:21] talked to brother at hammer Meister who
[40:23] sends his greens and I said brother head
[40:25] we're gonna have a meeting in the air
[40:26] and I don't have the new body yet but it
[40:29] certainly need to be able to take part
[40:31] in this with each one of you here
[40:33] tonight amen revelations chapter 12
[40:36] let's just read one scripture here for
[40:38] revelation 12 verse 11 it says and they
[40:41] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[40:43] and by the word of their testimony and
[40:45] they loved not their lives unto the
[40:48] death amen let's just bow our heads
[40:49] Heavenly Father Lord we are so thankful
[40:52] Lord for the price that you paid the
[40:57] Lord in this night two thousand years
[40:59] ago you took our sins Lord you shed your
[41:03] blood for us and we're so thankful Lord
[41:07] that we have Lord that sacrifice that
[41:11] takes our place Lord Lord for the pain
[41:14] and the agony that you willingly took on
[41:16] yourself and Lord now as we Minister we
[41:19] pray that you would just touch your
[41:21] people Lord strengthen them for battle
[41:22] Lord we pray that you would just anchor
[41:25] something to new in our hearts we pray
[41:26] in your name we ask and pray amen amen
[41:30] god bless you is maybe a bit of an odd
[41:33] scripture to take for a Friday night you
[41:36] know Good Friday but even especially
[41:39] speaking to the Bride of Christ this
[41:41] isn't really
[41:42] a scripture that applies to us
[41:44] necessarily because we know that this is
[41:46] after the rapture goes up and this is
[41:48] when Satan is cast down and this speaks
[41:52] of the red dragon the old serpent that
[41:54] is has been standing before God and he's
[41:56] been accusing the Brethren before God
[41:58] but at this time we go up in a rapture
[42:00] and he's kicked down and he comes down
[42:02] in all of his rage and he takes his
[42:04] wrath out on the earth
[42:05] and we know that these are the Saints
[42:07] that didn't have the seal of the Holy
[42:09] Spirit and the different ones and they
[42:11] give their lives for the for the gospel
[42:14] amen
[42:14] but I wanted to maybe take a little
[42:17] nugget out of this this evening because
[42:19] we if there's one thing I've noticed in
[42:21] Scripture it's that God has a pattern in
[42:24] things and if he does a thing once then
[42:25] he does it all the way through and he
[42:27] doesn't change that pattern and I know
[42:29] brother Branham touched on this many
[42:31] times and he uses a scripture in many
[42:33] different ways according to what the
[42:35] bride has need of not just those
[42:37] tribulation scenes I want to pull a
[42:39] quote here from 1959 and the message
[42:41] what here's style Elijah where he says
[42:43] by the blood of the Lamb and their
[42:45] testimony they overcame is that right he
[42:47] says you overcome by the blood of the
[42:50] Lamb and by your testimony if we can
[42:52] just have faith and believe in the Lord
[42:53] God that he will do these things for us
[42:56] amen God sets a requirement and we know
[42:58] that it's impossible for us to meet it
[43:00] but we also know that God if he gives
[43:02] the requirement he gives the remedy and
[43:04] so we see here that brother Branham says
[43:06] you overcome by the blood of the Lamb
[43:07] and by your testimony amen and then he
[43:10] goes on into the Ephesian Church age and
[43:13] he says but eventually in the fullness
[43:14] of time there came one the head even
[43:17] Jesus who also must be tempted to see if
[43:20] he would live by every word I don't want
[43:22] you to catch that if he would live by
[43:23] every word that proceedeth out of the
[43:25] mouth of God then was Satan foiled what
[43:28] when he lived by it not just when he
[43:30] talked about it not just when he
[43:31] believed it but when he lived by it then
[43:34] was Satan boil for here was one who
[43:36] lived by it is written and that
[43:38] masterpiece of God overcame by
[43:40] reflecting God's Word catch that now
[43:42] he's not just saying it but he's
[43:44] reflecting it then this manifested
[43:46] perfect one was given to the cross as
[43:48] the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect
[43:50] sacrifice and on the tree he received
[43:52] the wounds unto death that we buy him
[43:55] and become
[43:55] of him might eat of the Tree of Life and
[43:57] then that tree would of life would
[43:59] freely be given and would enable us to
[44:02] overcome and express the Word of God
[44:04] catch say he says it would be freely
[44:06] grib given to enable us to overcome and
[44:09] express the Word of God and now to these
[44:12] sons of God who by him overcome are
[44:14] given the privilege of the paradise of
[44:16] God and the constant fellowship of Jesus
[44:19] Christ amen the constant fellowship we
[44:21] have continuous access to Christ there
[44:24] will never be no more any separation
[44:26] from him whither he goes his bride will
[44:28] go where he is his he shares with his
[44:32] beloved on a joint their relationship
[44:34] the secret things will be revealed the
[44:36] dark things will be made plain we shall
[44:39] know as we are known and we shall be
[44:40] like him he says this is the heritage of
[44:43] the overcomer who has overcome by the
[44:45] blood of the Lamb and the word of
[44:47] testimony to Jesus Christ amen that's
[44:49] out of the ephesian church age tonight
[44:51] so tonight I want to speak on the
[44:53] overcomers path amen and we know there's
[44:56] been six ages in the past and there's
[44:57] been over comers in each and every one
[44:59] of those ages but we're in a 7th agent
[45:01] and we're coming out of that seven days
[45:03] I'd argue we've come out of it but when
[45:05] this age we have an instruction we have
[45:06] a message we have an anointing that's
[45:09] going to take us into a rapture amen if
[45:11] we'll just hold on to what the angel for
[45:12] our age said amen we know this is an age
[45:15] where somebody is going to sit on the
[45:17] throne and I want to be one of those
[45:18] ones that sits on that throne tonight
[45:20] amen I want to be an overcomer in this
[45:22] age I don't want to be somebody that's
[45:24] maybe just sitting on the side they're
[45:26] wounded and bloody and so beat-up that
[45:28] they can't do anything but I want to be
[45:30] an overcomer that has what they I don't
[45:33] want to be mistaken for somebody that
[45:34] didn't do anything I don't want to be
[45:35] mistaken for somebody that didn't go
[45:37] into the battle somebody that's so beat
[45:39] up that they're of no use amen and I
[45:41] don't believe that's what we're called
[45:42] to be in this age I believe we're called
[45:44] to be an overcomer that can confidently
[45:46] walk into heaven and say I made it not
[45:49] just by the skin of my teeth
[45:50] amen but by the blood of the Lamb and by
[45:52] the testimony of the word that he's
[45:53] given to us amen I want to have victory
[45:56] over everything that Satan throws at us
[45:58] I want my wife to be an overcomer and my
[46:00] children to be an overcomer in these
[46:02] different ones amen I want Satan to say
[46:05] oh no not him again
[46:06] when God sends me down a path that
[46:09] gonna cause a conflict with him they men
[46:11] clean them but I know I'm not gonna do
[46:13] that in my own strength I know I'm not
[46:14] gonna be able to do that in my own
[46:16] discipline in my own thoughts and my own
[46:18] ideas this is something that's gonna
[46:20] have to be supernatural because the
[46:22] overcoming we're talking about here is
[46:24] absolutely supernatural which means
[46:26] we're gonna have to have a supernatural
[46:28] influence we're gonna have to have a
[46:29] supernatural anointing we're gonna have
[46:31] to have a supernatural life that
[46:33] supersedes anything that we would ever
[46:35] have in our own self amen so let's just
[46:38] start to break this down and just keep
[46:41] your your your page there on revelation
[46:43] 12:11 it says and they overcame now we
[46:47] know what it means to overcome I'm gonna
[46:48] read the quote that we all know by heart
[46:50] I'm sure by now but maybe for the sake
[46:52] of the young people that might not
[46:53] remember it brother Bram said this and
[46:55] the message how can I overcome
[46:57] he said overcome means to recognize the
[46:59] devil in every one of his tricks he says
[47:02] lots of people says there's no devil
[47:03] it's just a thought he said now don't
[47:05] you believe that there's a real devil
[47:07] he's just as real as you are or anybody
[47:09] a real devil and you must recognize him
[47:11] as real you must know he's a devil then
[47:14] the same time that you recognize him and
[47:16] know that he's a devil and he's against
[47:18] you then to overcome you must recognize
[47:21] that the God in you is greater and
[47:22] mightier than he is that the one that's
[47:24] in you has already overcome him amen and
[47:27] by His grace you are more than a match
[47:30] for him
[47:30] amen there's real overcoming when you
[47:33] recognize him and not just recognize
[47:35] what Satan's trying to do but recognize
[47:37] that you have the victory inside of you
[47:38] if you have the Holy Spirit in that Amen
[47:40] but I want you to notice it's not enough
[47:42] to recognize God in others it's so easy
[47:45] to say well when brother so-and-so prays
[47:47] then people get healed and when sister
[47:49] so-and-so goes into a prayer closet then
[47:51] things change that's not what we're
[47:53] looking for that's great that we can see
[47:54] that in somebody else but we want to see
[47:56] it in our own selves amen we want this
[47:59] to be a bride why'd overcoming its
[48:02] individual - each of us but the entire
[48:04] bride has to overcome Amen this is a
[48:06] personal overcoming for each and every
[48:09] one of us and you look at maybe David or
[48:12] Joshua or Elijah these different ones
[48:14] and you say wow those were amazing
[48:15] overcomers they did such tremendous
[48:17] things in their life but I was listening
[48:20] or reading what brother Jason Walken
[48:21] said the other day
[48:22] but each and every one of them pointed
[48:24] forward to the time where we're at now
[48:26] as if that is the greatest moment as if
[48:29] that is the time where everything would
[48:32] be overcome amen
[48:33] look what Paul wrote in the Hebrews in
[48:35] chapter 13 verse 39 he says speaking of
[48:38] all these men he says and women he says
[48:41] and these all having obtained a good
[48:42] report through faith received not the
[48:45] promise God having provided some better
[48:47] thing for us that they without us should
[48:50] not be made perfect day men he said God
[48:52] having provided some better thing for us
[48:55] so what we see today is an opportunity
[48:57] for each and every one of us to live in
[48:59] an overcoming way with more power and
[49:02] more authority and more victory in their
[49:04] lives than anybody's experience since
[49:06] the first church age amen and this is
[49:08] the only group that will go in a rapture
[49:10] we know a group obviously we've had
[49:12] individuals that went up and Elijah in
[49:14] these different ones but this is the
[49:16] first time where we will see a group of
[49:17] people that will not see death amen what
[49:19] a tremendous time that we live in now
[49:22] Revelation 12:11 says and they overcame
[49:25] who him now we already know who this is
[49:28] we know that this is Satan that was cast
[49:30] down the the Red Dragon the accuser of
[49:32] the Brethren and we know that Satan's
[49:34] the furthest you can get from God
[49:36] there's nothing of God in him he is the
[49:38] the Anti God if you will there's no
[49:40] desire in him that is worth having and
[49:43] all he is is a jealous envious
[49:44] personality amen
[49:46] and so we know though that the human
[49:50] that humanity has an empty part inside
[49:53] of them brother BAM talked about this he
[49:54] says there's a little spot inside you
[49:56] that's meant for God and every human has
[49:58] and that's why they thirst for these
[49:59] different things and they're trying
[50:00] these different things to try and
[50:01] fulfill that but brother Branham also
[50:03] said only the believer can truly have
[50:05] God inside of them and accept Christ
[50:07] fully into their life they meant but I
[50:10] think one thing we have to step back and
[50:11] see and we'll get into this now for a
[50:13] bit is that we have a bigger him and we
[50:15] have a bigger her that has to be
[50:17] defeated in this age they men to him if
[50:19] you're a man of her if you're a woman if
[50:21] it's not obviously men so often we're
[50:23] looking externally for the enemy and
[50:25] we're looking at the world and we're
[50:26] looking at entertainment and we're
[50:28] looking at politics and we're looking at
[50:29] all these different things that we're
[50:31] facing but really what we're facing is
[50:34] an internal battle a man the one that
[50:36] we have to overcome as ourselves because
[50:38] when Satan attacks you he's coming at
[50:40] you through certain portals and channels
[50:41] and we know that we're still in our
[50:43] carnal flesh we still know that that
[50:45] those five outward senses and the five
[50:47] inner senses those are not redeemed
[50:49] those are not subject to to the the new
[50:52] birth that we get amen and so because of
[50:55] that we have to have those in constant
[50:58] battle against us it's the only way it's
[50:59] going to happen you have God on the
[51:00] inside and then everything else outside
[51:03] of that is not sanctified Amen it's not
[51:06] redeemed it can't be redeemed that's why
[51:08] we need a new body when we go amen so
[51:11] the victory we have to overcome is what
[51:12] the carnal man the carnal desires the
[51:14] carnal thinking that the carnal plans
[51:16] that all of these things all have to be
[51:19] brought into subjection Amen brother
[51:21] Brahim said this in the inner Vail he
[51:23] says and a man never knows what it is to
[51:24] live a victorious life until he's like
[51:27] completely overcome who he says himself
[51:31] that's the biggest enemy you got is
[51:33] yourself that's the reason you can't
[51:35] rise up in faith he says because you got
[51:37] intellectuals there your intellectual
[51:39] part says well this or that he says it's
[51:41] a reasoning we want to cast down
[51:43] reasonings the Bible tells us men so he
[51:45] talks about our intellect getting in the
[51:46] way that the carnal mind amen that's not
[51:49] the mind of Christ but that's the way we
[51:50] think we think of impossibilities of
[51:52] situations amen
[51:54] but he says you've got to get past that
[51:56] and that intellect is going to be the
[51:57] first thing that steps up against your
[51:59] faith in the message how can I overcome
[52:01] he says the thing you have to overcome
[52:03] is yourself he says your idea your
[52:06] thinking and surrender yourself to him
[52:09] and now this is the beautiful part he
[52:11] says he overcome for you he knows the
[52:14] way we don't amen and that's what we
[52:17] have to recognize is that we're trying
[52:18] to make our way through life and he's
[52:20] the only one that's ever overcome all
[52:22] the way through to full victory amen and
[52:24] he's trying to lead us and guide us into
[52:26] full victory amen
[52:29] Paul talks about this very struggle in
[52:32] the book of Romans chapter 7 a man he
[52:35] says in verse 18 for I know that in me
[52:37] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[52:39] thing for to will is present with me but
[52:41] how to perform that which is good I find
[52:44] not Paul says I want to do good but I
[52:46] can't find the strength to do it
[52:48] for the good that I would I do not but
[52:50] the evil that I would not that I do so
[52:52] he wants to do good and he doesn't do
[52:53] and then he doesn't want to do evil and
[52:55] then he does it he says now if I do that
[52:57] which I would not it is no more I that
[52:59] do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find
[53:02] then a law that when I would do good
[53:04] evil is present with me for I delight in
[53:07] the law of God effort there after the
[53:09] inward man he says inside I've got the
[53:10] Holy Spirit and that has the right
[53:12] desires but I've still got this outer
[53:14] man that I'm struggling with day in and
[53:16] day out he says but I see another law in
[53:18] my members warring against the law of my
[53:20] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[53:22] the law of sin which is in my members Oh
[53:26] wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver
[53:28] me from the body of this death and they
[53:31] says but I thank God through Jesus
[53:33] Christ our Lord
[53:34] so then with the mind I myself serve the
[53:36] law of God but with the flesh the law of
[53:38] sin amen but I'm so glad that Paul
[53:41] doesn't leave us hanging there that
[53:42] wretched sinful on Victorious man amen
[53:47] if he stopped there how unhappy we would
[53:49] be but now he jumps right into Chapter
[53:51] eight with these wonderful words and he
[53:53] says there is now therefore no
[53:55] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[53:57] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[53:59] after the spirit amen for the law of the
[54:02] spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made
[54:04] me free from the law of sin and death
[54:06] for what the law could not do in that it
[54:08] was weak through the flesh God sending
[54:10] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[54:13] flesh and for sin condemned sin in the
[54:15] flesh see Paul when he was talking about
[54:17] that yes he's acknowledging the struggle
[54:19] but he says look there is a way and we
[54:21] can come past that that struggle is real
[54:23] he said but in the old man
[54:25] I couldn't overcome even when Paul would
[54:28] have been back under the law you know as
[54:30] a Pharisee of Pharisees he wouldn't have
[54:32] been able to overcome he'd be sitting
[54:33] there and he'd be trying to do all the
[54:35] little things that they did but he knew
[54:37] that there was still no victory in that
[54:38] but then he says now through Christ
[54:40] Jesus I have a victory that I couldn't
[54:42] get before and there's no way that I'm
[54:45] gonna fail amen
[54:47] he says that God has given us the
[54:49] victory through what Christ Jesus who
[54:51] walk not after the flesh but after the
[54:53] spirit he said for what the sin for what
[54:57] law could not do verse three for what
[54:59] the law could not do in that it was weak
[55:01] through the flesh God sending his own
[55:04] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[55:06] for sin condemned sin in the flesh that
[55:10] the righteousness of the law might be
[55:12] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[55:14] flesh but after the spirit amen do we
[55:17] walk in the spirit for they that are of
[55:19] the flesh do mind the things of the
[55:21] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[55:23] the things of the Spirit for to be
[55:26] carnally minded is death but to be
[55:28] spiritually minded is life and peace
[55:31] because the carnal mind is enmity
[55:33] against God Brit is not subject to the
[55:36] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[55:39] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[55:41] God but ye are not in the flesh but in
[55:44] the spirit amen
[55:45] if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
[55:47] you now if any man have not the Spirit
[55:50] of Christ he have not he is none of his
[55:52] and a Christ be in you the body is dead
[55:54] because of sin but the Spirit is life
[55:57] because of righteousness but if the
[56:00] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[56:02] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[56:04] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[56:06] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[56:09] dwelleth in you amen hallelujah Paul
[56:11] takes the wretchedness completely out of
[56:12] the situation and slides us right into
[56:15] that victorious mind say Amen I don't
[56:17] know if I mentioned my topic did I give
[56:20] my okay I did do I wasn't sure if I did
[56:22] all right we're okay amen
[56:24] listen to what brother Branham says in
[56:26] the former and latter rain he says
[56:28] speaking of the Spirit building Spirit
[56:30] led overcoming life he says the
[56:31] overcomer one that's overcome the world
[56:34] has overcome self and overcome pride
[56:37] I'll make him the Morningstar what does
[56:40] it do I'll shine him up and set him up
[56:43] there so that I by my incoming power
[56:46] will reflect my own presence in the
[56:48] darkness he that overcomes will I give
[56:51] the Morningstar that's what's the
[56:53] Morningstar set there for he says to
[56:55] reflect the sun's coming what is the
[56:58] Morningstar it's the sun shining against
[57:00] it reflecting the presence of the coming
[57:02] of the Sun it's the brightest thing in
[57:04] heaven the brightest thing in heaven
[57:06] ought to be today and is today the
[57:08] minister now it doesn't stop there with
[57:11] the minister he says or the Christian or
[57:13] the spirit filled man or
[57:15] that's so filled with the holy spirit
[57:17] till he's forsaken the world and
[57:19] everything and God is reflecting his
[57:21] life coming through him warning the
[57:23] world that the approaching som is at
[57:26] hand he says oh what an hour a man Paul
[57:29] is pointing us to a place where we walk
[57:31] in the spirit we talk in the spirit we
[57:33] live in the spirit we vacation in the
[57:34] spirit we go to our work in the spirit
[57:36] we pray in the spirit why so that
[57:39] there's a surrender life so full of the
[57:41] Holy Ghost so that Satan has no room to
[57:43] enter and then he comes in he starts
[57:45] looking at little cracks and chinks and
[57:47] trying to push his way in and the Holy
[57:48] Spirit or lecture says hey no room for
[57:50] you and here go find somebody else to to
[57:53] bother amen
[57:55] continuing revelation 12:11 it says they
[57:58] overcame him how by the blood of the
[58:01] Lamb amen and this is the starting point
[58:02] for every believer and I thought this
[58:04] was appropriate given the sacrifice that
[58:06] we know Christ made this evening 2000
[58:08] years ago is that under the blood of the
[58:11] lamb is where every single believer has
[58:12] to start amen you never want to straight
[58:15] from the blood because it's proof what
[58:16] of your atonement it's proof that the
[58:18] price has been paid for your sin it's
[58:20] proof that Christ has taken away
[58:23] everything that Satan could come against
[58:25] you with to accuse you amen without the
[58:27] blood we're still condemned I heard a
[58:30] minister say a while ago we said the
[58:32] bride doesn't need the blood because she
[58:34] has a wedding certificate well that's
[58:36] well and good but amen we're still on
[58:38] this earth we still have a carnal body
[58:40] we still have senses that are not
[58:41] subject to the inner man we're still
[58:44] fighting against those amen and so we
[58:47] know that it has to be under the blood
[58:49] day in and day out and I know brother
[58:50] barque preached quite a bit on the blood
[58:52] a while ago so I won't go into that too
[58:54] deeply amen
[58:55] but I just want to say if you're out
[58:57] from under that blood if you say that
[58:58] I've got something that means I don't
[58:59] mean the blood while I'm still here then
[59:01] you're out from under the scriptures
[59:03] amen Ephesians 1 verse essent in whom we
[59:06] have redemption through his blood and
[59:08] the forgiveness of sins so we have
[59:10] redemption and forgiveness of sins
[59:12] through the blood according to the
[59:14] riches of His grace in whom ye also
[59:16] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[59:19] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[59:21] whom also after you believed you were
[59:23] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise
[59:25] so we see the blood now takes you to the
[59:27] Holy Spirit of promise
[59:29] but listen to verse 14 here it says
[59:31] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[59:32] until the redemption of the purchased
[59:35] possession amen so this mean redemption
[59:38] isn't fully completed yet we're still
[59:39] here our bodies haven't been redeemed
[59:42] our souls haven't been redeemed over to
[59:44] that other side the blood therefore has
[59:46] to be in effect and is in effect until
[59:48] we take a body change amen
[59:50] so he says the earnest of our
[59:52] inheritance until the redemption of the
[59:54] purchased possession that's us unto the
[59:57] praise of his glory listen to what
[59:59] brother Branham says and God hasn't
[1:00:01] provided way he says and that's the way
[1:00:03] it is today believer stays under the
[1:00:05] blood that's right it's the only place
[1:00:07] to stay a safety all right he said the
[1:00:10] blood cause separation between believer
[1:00:12] and unbeliever because the blood packs
[1:00:15] life the life is in the blood and the
[1:00:17] believer stays in the blood which brings
[1:00:20] him life eternal he says and now when
[1:00:23] Israel come over the land of the river
[1:00:25] of Jordan he says now trying to catch
[1:00:26] this so let's try and catch it he said
[1:00:28] when Israel crossed over into the land
[1:00:30] the promised land there was a Gentile
[1:00:32] woman that we know as Rahab the harlot
[1:00:34] and she asked for mercy and she did
[1:00:37] receive mercy she received mercy as long
[1:00:40] as she stayed under that scarlet cord
[1:00:42] and that's the only way she could have
[1:00:44] mercy it was a sign a token that was
[1:00:47] given to her he says we have a token
[1:00:49] today also and we're safe as long as we
[1:00:52] stay under our scarlet cord the blood of
[1:00:55] Jesus Christ he says as an individual
[1:00:57] not as a group an individual we must
[1:01:00] stay under that scarlet court of the
[1:01:02] blood of Jesus Christ amen that's 1963
[1:01:04] in the message why little Bethlehem
[1:01:06] which is after the seals if it matters
[1:01:08] to anybody amen so that's the starting
[1:01:10] place for the overcomer you have to be
[1:01:12] under the blood you have to be covered
[1:01:14] in that because why that's the only way
[1:01:16] that Christ can atone for you is if
[1:01:17] you're under that bloody men the
[1:01:20] Scriptures clearly showing brother
[1:01:21] Branham hammers is time and time again
[1:01:23] that this the believer has to be the
[1:01:25] sinner has to be identified with the
[1:01:27] sacrifice they men you had to have the
[1:01:30] blood over your house you had to have
[1:01:31] the blood over your hands you had to
[1:01:33] have it over your life and all that
[1:01:34] pertained to you it had to be under that
[1:01:36] blood and they didn't just get to
[1:01:38] sacrifice that lamb and walked away they
[1:01:40] had to have that blood on them amen
[1:01:42] listen to what brother branham says in
[1:01:44] the message to Tolkien he says what a
[1:01:46] beautiful picture he says the redeemed
[1:01:48] see justice had been met and the
[1:01:50] requirement of God's holy justice had
[1:01:52] been met God said now I'll require your
[1:01:55] life he says and then when the life had
[1:01:57] sinned so whoever Cindy says I'm going
[1:01:59] to require your life he says then an
[1:02:02] innocent substitute took its place and
[1:02:04] it was a blood beast not an apple or a
[1:02:06] peach he said that absolutely ought to
[1:02:08] make the Serpent's seed so plain to
[1:02:09] everybody that it was blood and this
[1:02:12] blood which could not come out of fruit
[1:02:14] came out of an innocent substitute and
[1:02:16] the life had gone out - in his place and
[1:02:19] the blood was a symbol that the beast
[1:02:21] had died and the blood has gone out and
[1:02:23] the worshiper applying the blood over
[1:02:25] himself showed that he was identified in
[1:02:28] the redemption because he has identified
[1:02:30] himself with the sacrifice connected
[1:02:33] himself to the sacrifice and the blood
[1:02:35] stood for the token how wonderful he
[1:02:38] says what a picture it is it's a perfect
[1:02:39] type of Christ just exactly the believer
[1:02:42] today standing under the shed blood
[1:02:44] identified with the sacrifice just as
[1:02:46] perfect as it can be of how that Christ
[1:02:48] not being an animal you see the animal
[1:02:51] died the most anything innocent thing we
[1:02:53] have I suppose would be the lamb but
[1:02:56] when God wanted to identify Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] he identified him as the lamb the lamb
[1:03:00] is the most innocent and pure of all the
[1:03:02] animal body but this was the perfect
[1:03:04] lamb Christ was and then through the
[1:03:07] shed blood of this lamb the natural lamb
[1:03:09] and Egypt the blood was applied and when
[1:03:11] it was it stood for a token he said then
[1:03:13] what would the blood of this lamb
[1:03:14] capital L this lamb stand for he said
[1:03:18] see the token that we are dead to
[1:03:21] ourselves and identified with our
[1:03:23] sacrifice see then the lamb and the
[1:03:26] blood and the person becomes identified
[1:03:28] together the sacrifice and the believer
[1:03:31] so you are identified in your life by
[1:03:34] your sacrifice I want you to catch that
[1:03:36] you are identified in your life by your
[1:03:38] sacrifice that makes you what you are a
[1:03:41] man notice how brother Brown ties the
[1:03:43] blood and the token together and then in
[1:03:45] the in in Egypt the blood was applied to
[1:03:48] what make the death angel Passover the
[1:03:50] home but today our token is the holy
[1:03:52] spirit so it's not the
[1:03:54] is not our token today in the same way
[1:03:56] it was back then but brother Brahim ties
[1:03:58] the blood to the token it's and he says
[1:04:00] the blood covers us what and makes us
[1:04:02] clean in the eyes of God why because
[1:04:05] then he can take us on to the Holy Ghost
[1:04:07] and that's our ticket to heaven that's
[1:04:08] our token a mint that's our seal
[1:04:10] approval that God has accepted us
[1:04:12] brother Bram tied the two together why
[1:04:15] he says that blood has the life and it
[1:04:18] stands for or it represents or it points
[1:04:20] to the token which is the light so the
[1:04:22] blood has the light that points to the
[1:04:24] token which is the life that comes out
[1:04:26] of that blood he said which also
[1:04:28] includes being dead to ourselves so you
[1:04:31] have the blood which has life in it
[1:04:33] when that blood is shed the life now
[1:04:35] comes into what the the life of the Holy
[1:04:38] Spirit it's a token that we can take on
[1:04:40] ourselves that's our eternal life and
[1:04:42] then that is only given to you when
[1:04:44] you've died to yourself they meant so
[1:04:47] just as the natural blood of the lamb
[1:04:49] was an answer to the natural law now you
[1:04:51] get the supernatural blood of Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ that comes and fulfills the law
[1:04:55] and in that therefore we have what a new
[1:04:59] covenant of grace see back in the old
[1:05:01] day that lamb it didn't satisfy
[1:05:06] indefinitely I'd say it kind of kicked
[1:05:09] the sin can down the road right because
[1:05:11] the the land sacrifice in under the law
[1:05:13] was only good for one year why because
[1:05:16] it wasn't a like-for-like transaction it
[1:05:19] was a lamb taking the place of a man and
[1:05:21] that animal didn't have the choice the
[1:05:23] lamb didn't choose to give its life the
[1:05:25] lamb didn't say yes I'm the one that
[1:05:26] wants to be identified with Jonathan
[1:05:28] corlett sins for this year and I'll give
[1:05:29] my life for him no it was chosen by the
[1:05:32] man it was given not of its own free
[1:05:34] will it was forced to give its life and
[1:05:36] so what it just kicked the can down the
[1:05:38] road and so that sin can is just getting
[1:05:40] bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
[1:05:42] think of the the pilgrims progress what
[1:05:44] does he have he has this huge backpack
[1:05:47] on his back of what all the sins of his
[1:05:49] life gathered together and it's not
[1:05:50] until he comes to the cross he said all
[1:05:53] sorts of people tell him they can take
[1:05:54] care of it it but it's not until he
[1:05:56] comes to the cross that that thing drops
[1:05:58] away amen so then what did we get we had
[1:06:01] Christ comes and he sheds his blood on
[1:06:04] the cross
[1:06:04] how willingly right he's in the garden
[1:06:07] of
[1:06:08] semmen his brother mark talked about
[1:06:09] there and he's and we sang about and he
[1:06:12] says not my will but thine be done he
[1:06:14] willingly settles into the sacrifice of
[1:06:17] his own life and he takes that agonizing
[1:06:19] death on himself willingly so that he
[1:06:22] could satisfy the same question forever
[1:06:24] because when he doesn't now it's a
[1:06:26] like-for-like transaction it's a man
[1:06:27] that's why he had to come as a man was
[1:06:30] because a man had to take the sins of
[1:06:32] all mankind and the only way he could do
[1:06:34] it was if he was perfect sinless
[1:06:35] spotless the way the natural lambs were
[1:06:37] and if he took it willingly and that was
[1:06:40] the battle in Gethsemane was would he
[1:06:41] take it willingly and he did he said
[1:06:43] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:06:45] done and he he humbled himself to that
[1:06:47] amen so then what happens remember
[1:06:51] brother Bram says you're not just
[1:06:52] identified by your sacrifice but you're
[1:06:54] identified with your sacrifice meaning
[1:06:56] that whatever your sacrifice had that's
[1:06:59] now yours and whatever you had is now
[1:07:01] his so when Christ dies amen his
[1:07:04] identity become sinful it becomes lost
[1:07:06] it becomes worthless it becomes unholy
[1:07:09] and unrighteous amen and that's what he
[1:07:11] takes and that's why he had to die
[1:07:12] because he had all of those sins on top
[1:07:14] of him right God couldn't accept him in
[1:07:16] his presence in that way so he dies and
[1:07:18] he takes it
[1:07:19] he's completely abandoned that's the
[1:07:21] last thing he says on the cross right
[1:07:22] aside from it is finished she says my
[1:07:24] God my God why have you forsaken me why
[1:07:26] because qog couldn't be associated with
[1:07:28] that body anymore
[1:07:29] so he died what a man sinful amen but
[1:07:33] what a glorious thought now that what he
[1:07:35] was we become so he's become us but now
[1:07:37] we become righteous and then we become
[1:07:40] his life we become his nature we become
[1:07:42] his characteristics and all of that now
[1:07:44] has identified as us so now we become
[1:07:47] Christ and he becomes us and we have
[1:07:49] this beautiful picture now where what we
[1:07:52] get to be him and now you can look at us
[1:07:55] and we should be able to look at
[1:07:57] ourselves and say I am Christ why
[1:07:59] because that's what the transaction was
[1:08:00] about was giving us who he was and
[1:08:02] taking our side back on himself they men
[1:08:05] that's why the overcoming starts with
[1:08:07] the lamb the blood of the Lamb because
[1:08:08] you can't be just identified with him
[1:08:10] you have to be identified as him you
[1:08:12] have to be identified amen as the
[1:08:14] sacrifice that was given for you it
[1:08:17] meant Galatians 2:19 says for I through
[1:08:19] the law am dead to the law that I might
[1:08:21] live
[1:08:22] unto God I am crucified with Christ
[1:08:24] nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ
[1:08:27] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:08:29] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:08:31] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:08:34] himself for me
[1:08:35] amen Paul points us back to the cross
[1:08:37] where Christ shed his blood for us and
[1:08:39] that's the place where we receive real
[1:08:41] life brother banner or the the scripture
[1:08:43] talks about when that blood comes out
[1:08:44] and there's a separation of water and
[1:08:46] these different things what it's
[1:08:48] signifying that the life comes out of
[1:08:49] that and it's now available to every
[1:08:51] believer amen but not only that but as I
[1:08:54] talked about earlier we now have
[1:08:55] continuous access to Christ that's what
[1:08:58] happened we see the veil was torn when
[1:09:00] he dies and now we have continues access
[1:09:02] why because we're no longer simple we're
[1:09:05] no longer abandoned were no longer
[1:09:06] unrighteous and unholy but because we're
[1:09:08] identified as our sacrifice now we get
[1:09:11] to enter into his presence because he's
[1:09:13] put himself on us and we're identified
[1:09:15] as Christ himself amen so now when Satan
[1:09:19] comes knocking at our door what's he
[1:09:20] doing he's trying to say you never took
[1:09:22] he never took your place he's saying
[1:09:24] that stuff that you did maybe you did it
[1:09:27] yesterday
[1:09:27] it doesn't matter maybe you did it today
[1:09:29] and he's saying hey look at what you're
[1:09:31] doing you can't be a son of God you
[1:09:32] can't be this you can't enter in you
[1:09:34] can't do that and what do you have to do
[1:09:36] you say go point to my sacrifice go talk
[1:09:39] to Jesus Christ because he's the one
[1:09:40] that took all of that I'm not
[1:09:42] responsible for that anymore
[1:09:43] amen I've repented I've accepted the
[1:09:46] shed blood of the Lamb and because of
[1:09:47] that you're talking to the wrong person
[1:09:49] it's not identified with me anymore it's
[1:09:51] identified with him amen
[1:09:54] look what Paul says as he continues in
[1:09:56] Romans 8 because Paul gives us what an
[1:09:59] admonition here not to be identified and
[1:10:01] bound by accusations against us Romans 8
[1:10:04] verse 31 now this is the chapter that
[1:10:06] starts out there is now therefore no
[1:10:07] condemnation this is Paul finishing up
[1:10:10] he says what shall we then say to these
[1:10:12] things if God be for us who can be
[1:10:15] against us Amen if God be for us if God
[1:10:17] has declared something nobody else can
[1:10:19] change that he that spared not his own
[1:10:22] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:10:25] shall he not halt not with him also
[1:10:27] freely give us all things who shall lay
[1:10:30] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:10:32] is God that justifiable who is he that
[1:10:35] condemneth
[1:10:36] it is Christ that died yay rather that
[1:10:38] is risen again who is even at the right
[1:10:40] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:10:42] for us Amen notice there it says it's
[1:10:45] God that justifies you don't have to
[1:10:47] answer Satan's questions you don't have
[1:10:49] to answer his accusations because you
[1:10:51] don't justify yourself it is Christ that
[1:10:53] justifies in him alone
[1:10:54] so same wants to come knocking and
[1:10:56] accusing you say listen you're talking
[1:10:58] to the wrong person because I'm not
[1:10:59] saying I'm perfect
[1:11:00] he said I'm perfect go talk to him he's
[1:11:03] the one you need to argue with amen amen
[1:11:04] there's a place of rest in that every
[1:11:07] time we mess up and we mess up every day
[1:11:09] and if we're sincere and we're repenting
[1:11:11] and that's under the blood there is no
[1:11:13] reason why we can't continue to walk in
[1:11:15] close access to God amen in close
[1:11:17] communion and close fellowship with him
[1:11:20] brother Branham said there's always been
[1:11:23] an arc in God's economy this is the
[1:11:24] message how can I overcome there's
[1:11:26] always been an arc in God's economy
[1:11:28] there was an arc in the days of Noah for
[1:11:31] the saving of his people there was an
[1:11:33] arc in the days of the law the
[1:11:34] architects timoni in the days of the law
[1:11:36] they followed the ark he says then
[1:11:38] there's a third dispensation now like
[1:11:40] Noah's time lots time and now this time
[1:11:42] there's an ark now and that Ark is not a
[1:11:45] denomination neither did is it the good
[1:11:47] works you do it's by one spirit amen
[1:11:50] Romans 8 verse 1 we are all baptized
[1:11:53] into one body in the domain of that
[1:11:55] Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter
[1:11:57] how good how bad whatever you're in that
[1:12:01] kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism see
[1:12:04] that's the only way you overcome it's
[1:12:06] all that is under the shed blood is
[1:12:08] overcomers because you cannot overcome
[1:12:10] yourself it's he that overcomes for you
[1:12:12] you're arresting amen if we can only
[1:12:15] find ourselves like that every day
[1:12:16] resting and what the finished work of
[1:12:19] Calvary amen that it's a peace that we
[1:12:21] ought to have every single day no matter
[1:12:23] how we mess up lose our temper look at
[1:12:25] things we shouldn't do say things we
[1:12:27] shouldn't little lies this that the
[1:12:29] other thing in it all we're resting on
[1:12:31] the finished work of Calvary amen not on
[1:12:33] the works the good works brother Brown
[1:12:35] says it he says it's not the good works
[1:12:37] no matter how good or how bad he says
[1:12:40] that you're in the kingdom it says by
[1:12:42] the Holy Ghost baptism why because he
[1:12:44] overcome for you and you're resting amen
[1:12:48] and the message is super
[1:12:50] he says now see we're only made of 16
[1:12:52] elements of the earth that's you know
[1:12:54] calcium potash petroleum cosmic light
[1:12:56] and so forth
[1:12:57] God just reached down and got a handful
[1:12:59] of that stuff and go whoo and said step
[1:13:01] in here Gabriel were going down he's
[1:13:03] speaking of Abraham he said he made
[1:13:05] himself one that's right oh I'm so glad
[1:13:07] to know him like that that there might
[1:13:09] not even be one speck of me left on
[1:13:11] earth but my God who promised to raise
[1:13:13] me up in the last days can speak the
[1:13:16] cosmic light and things will come into
[1:13:17] existence
[1:13:18] if only my name's on his book amen he
[1:13:22] says wrote there by the blood of the
[1:13:24] Lamb a super sign he says aren't you
[1:13:26] happy don't you just love him with all
[1:13:28] your heart he's so good I love him with
[1:13:30] all that is in me and they says this God
[1:13:33] be manifested he says a man I believe
[1:13:37] that he's here and then he says he looks
[1:13:40] up he says something just happened man
[1:13:43] he said I seen something happen amen he
[1:13:46] says he always backs up his word if it's
[1:13:49] right he says the super son what was it
[1:13:51] it was God vindicating as prophets word
[1:13:53] to the people they meant showing them
[1:13:55] that God was recognizing that this was
[1:13:58] right and they needed to take it he's
[1:14:00] talking about this he's talking about
[1:14:01] deliverance he's talking about healing
[1:14:03] and these different things they many
[1:14:05] seen he said what just watch he said
[1:14:07] something happened right there what
[1:14:09] somebody took him at his word amen in
[1:14:12] the message look in 1963 a little bit
[1:14:15] later a little bit earlier than this
[1:14:17] sorry he says now the thing of it is is
[1:14:19] come to a place where all the stain of
[1:14:21] sin has washed away then you stand
[1:14:24] redeemed by the blood of the Lamb he
[1:14:26] says you are an atom like he was before
[1:14:28] he fell that's right now you are an atom
[1:14:32] like he was before he fell amen you are
[1:14:35] a son of God washed in the blood of
[1:14:37] God's own blood it was blood that brings
[1:14:39] forth the child it was only blood alone
[1:14:41] the blood comes from the male he said
[1:14:44] the blood comes from the man the woman
[1:14:45] she produces the egg but the man is the
[1:14:47] hemoglobin and that's from where comes
[1:14:50] the germ and in the germ is where the
[1:14:52] life lays and the life comes not by
[1:14:54] confession in some Church or some Creed
[1:14:56] or some document but the life comes when
[1:14:59] you're born-again by the blood of Jesus
[1:15:01] Christ the German he says in the works
[1:15:03] that I
[1:15:03] do shall you do also he that believeth
[1:15:05] on me though he were dead yet shall he
[1:15:08] live whosoever liveth and believeth in
[1:15:10] me shall never die there is that life of
[1:15:13] God as a son of God born by the blood of
[1:15:16] God listen to this he says the same holy
[1:15:19] spirit that wrote this Bible will focus
[1:15:22] it right back into you again what the
[1:15:25] life of God that's not it there's not a
[1:15:27] denomination or a Creed that can do that
[1:15:29] only God Himself can take ahold of the
[1:15:32] camera of your eyes and let you see what
[1:15:34] God is and what his purpose is
[1:15:36] yes sir certainly hey man I want to read
[1:15:39] that again he says the same holy spirit
[1:15:40] that wrote this Bible will focus the
[1:15:43] life of God right back into you again he
[1:15:45] says why to let you see what God is what
[1:15:48] his purpose is yes sir certainly amen so
[1:15:52] the blood is what setting you up for the
[1:15:54] Holy Spirit to come into your life to
[1:15:55] bring you back into the fullness of a
[1:15:57] son or daughter of God he says when you
[1:16:00] have that Holy Spirit he says you are a
[1:16:02] fully restored Adam and then you're back
[1:16:04] in your eating condition except for what
[1:16:06] you're still in this body amen but what
[1:16:08] is the purpose of that the blood taking
[1:16:10] you to the Holy Spirit why he says to
[1:16:12] see your kingdom purpose and what's that
[1:16:14] to express Christ and overcome in this
[1:16:17] world amen
[1:16:19] let's move on to the next portion of
[1:16:21] revelation 12:11 it says then they
[1:16:27] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:16:29] and by the word of their testimony I
[1:16:32] just fell in love with this as I was
[1:16:33] reading it it challenged me it provoked
[1:16:35] me it just kind of got me all stirred up
[1:16:37] and those are good things for a believer
[1:16:39] Amen we don't want to sit here and just
[1:16:41] look around and say yeah I've got the
[1:16:43] message and I got the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:45] this and that the other thing amen we
[1:16:46] want to be challenged we want to be
[1:16:48] growing we want to be moving we want God
[1:16:50] to be shaking us and continuing up Lord
[1:16:53] amen the path to heaven amen
[1:16:55] but I'm struck here by it says they they
[1:16:58] overcame so there's a group but it says
[1:17:00] by the word singular of their testimony
[1:17:03] singular so this is a people that has
[1:17:05] the same word and they have the same
[1:17:07] testimony so this is a this is a united
[1:17:10] people under what God's Word this is
[1:17:12] people that are saying the same thing
[1:17:13] and doing the same thing but notice how
[1:17:16] this overcoming
[1:17:17] it doesn't say they had a testimony
[1:17:21] after they overcame it says they
[1:17:23] overcame by their testimony amen
[1:17:26] they didn't have a victory and then give
[1:17:28] a testimony but rather it says their
[1:17:30] testimony is what gave them the victory
[1:17:32] in the first place Amen so often we sit
[1:17:34] here and we say God give me a testimony
[1:17:36] god help me God come down and show
[1:17:38] yourself real give me something give me
[1:17:41] a testimony to share with the people but
[1:17:43] if we see here what God's saying is
[1:17:45] don't say to give the testimony after
[1:17:47] the victory give the testimony to bring
[1:17:49] the victory in your life they men so we
[1:17:52] see and we can look and we'll look at a
[1:17:54] couple examples here in scripture where
[1:17:56] the testimony is what produces the
[1:17:57] victory we're not supposed to wait till
[1:18:00] the battles over to give the testimony
[1:18:01] amen we're supposed to be testifying
[1:18:03] before the battle starts while the
[1:18:05] battles going on and then after it goes
[1:18:07] after it's done as well amen
[1:18:09] look at David's testimony before he
[1:18:11] fights Goliath and then as he goes into
[1:18:13] it First Samuel 1734 says so David's
[1:18:17] before the king he's in front of what's
[1:18:18] supposed to be a believer we know he's
[1:18:19] not but it's in front of Saul and David
[1:18:22] said to Saul thy servant kept his
[1:18:24] father's sheep and there came a lion and
[1:18:26] a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
[1:18:27] and I went out after him and smote him
[1:18:30] and delivered the lamb out of his mouth
[1:18:32] and when he arose against me I caught
[1:18:34] him by his beard and smelled him and
[1:18:35] slew him thy servant slew both the lion
[1:18:38] and the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:18:40] Philistine shall be as one of them
[1:18:41] seeing that he had defied the arms of
[1:18:43] the Living God it meant so he's saying
[1:18:45] look I've already got a testimony of
[1:18:47] victory and guess what I'm gonna testify
[1:18:49] the victory as I faced this Philistine
[1:18:51] and that's that he's gonna die just the
[1:18:53] way those two did and yes he's just as
[1:18:55] impossible to kill as those are I killed
[1:18:57] those with my bare hands I'm gonna kill
[1:18:59] him with the weapons God has given me
[1:19:00] amen but why is David so confident it's
[1:19:04] because he has an experience already
[1:19:06] he's got something to go on but there's
[1:19:08] always the first time there's always the
[1:19:10] first time where you've got a step
[1:19:12] forward and take God at His Word and say
[1:19:14] I'm gonna testify that I'm he'll I'm
[1:19:16] gonna testify that I'm delivered I'm
[1:19:17] gonna testify that I am saved I'm gonna
[1:19:19] testify that my children are safe I'm
[1:19:21] gonna testify deliverance and all these
[1:19:23] different things
[1:19:24] why because God's looking for someone
[1:19:26] that will stand on his word and step
[1:19:28] forward and what walk right into it and
[1:19:30] then God back so
[1:19:31] his wording gives you the testimony that
[1:19:32] you've spoken of already amen but watch
[1:19:37] what happens now is David comes in to
[1:19:38] glide so he's told Saul he says look
[1:19:40] I've got wet everything I need God's
[1:19:42] with me I've got the weapons I need I
[1:19:44] don't need anything that you offer me
[1:19:45] but now he comes before Goliath and I
[1:19:48] want you to catch here that the enemy
[1:19:49] gets the first word and if there's one
[1:19:51] thing I've noticed the enemy usually
[1:19:52] gets the first word and why is that it's
[1:19:55] because the enemy is the one that comes
[1:19:56] after us amen we don't go around
[1:19:59] stepping on Satan's ground so to speak
[1:20:01] we're not going out into bars in these
[1:20:03] different places generally we're not
[1:20:05] putting ourselves in situations where
[1:20:06] it's his territory but he what steps
[1:20:10] onto our territory brother Branham calls
[1:20:11] him a squatter Satan's a squatter and he
[1:20:14] comes onto your territory yeah there
[1:20:16] comes in Bold As Brass cocky why trying
[1:20:18] to bluff you to make you think that he's
[1:20:20] impossible to defeat or else he's slyly
[1:20:22] hiding over there in the corner to try
[1:20:24] and ambush you amen
[1:20:26] but the enemy is the one that always
[1:20:27] comes after us we aren't going after the
[1:20:29] enemy he's the one that comes onto us
[1:20:30] he's the one that jumps onto us puts
[1:20:32] thoughts in her head tries to make us
[1:20:34] sick tries to take away our peace and
[1:20:35] joy in that we're not going to Satan to
[1:20:38] say somebody come on bud try and take my
[1:20:39] peace he's coming after each one of us
[1:20:41] and what does he do he starts talking to
[1:20:43] us he starts putting pressure on us he
[1:20:45] starts trying to get us to react amen
[1:20:48] verse 42 of that chapter and Samuel says
[1:20:51] and when the Philistine looked about and
[1:20:53] saw David he disdained him for he was
[1:20:55] but a youth and ruddy and of a fair
[1:20:57] countenance and the Philistine said to
[1:20:59] David am i a dog that thou comes to me
[1:21:02] with staves and the Philistine cursed
[1:21:04] David by his gods and the Philistine
[1:21:07] said to David come to me and I will give
[1:21:09] that flesh to the fowls of the air and
[1:21:11] the beasts of the field so look at that
[1:21:14] he cursed David by his gods and then he
[1:21:17] says I'm gonna kill you and feed your
[1:21:19] flesh to the birds but notice now the
[1:21:21] brides the one that has the last word
[1:21:22] here amen
[1:21:23] then David said to the Philistine now
[1:21:25] comes to me with a sword and with a
[1:21:27] spear and with a shield but I come to
[1:21:29] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[1:21:30] the god of the armies of Israel whom
[1:21:32] thou has to fight
[1:21:33] so David says look I'm identifying
[1:21:35] myself with the God of Israel and guess
[1:21:38] what he's the one that's going to defeat
[1:21:39] you amen he says this day will the Lord
[1:21:44] deliver the
[1:21:44] to my hand and I will smite thee and
[1:21:47] take thy head from thee and I will give
[1:21:49] the carcasses of the host of the
[1:21:50] Philistines this day into the fowls of
[1:21:52] the air and to the wild beasts of the
[1:21:54] earth that all the Earth may know that
[1:21:56] there is a God in Israel amen so he
[1:21:58] cursed Phyllis he cursed Goliath by his
[1:22:00] God not cursing him in the sense of you
[1:22:03] know using the name in vain but he's
[1:22:04] saying look there's a curse on you now
[1:22:06] what you said you were going to me now
[1:22:08] becomes your judgment and not only you
[1:22:10] but everyone that follows after you he
[1:22:12] says I'm not only going to give you to
[1:22:13] the birds of the air he says but I'm
[1:22:15] gonna take everybody else in the
[1:22:16] Philistine army as well he says I'm
[1:22:18] gonna kill every one of you what because
[1:22:19] that's what you said you're gonna do to
[1:22:21] us hey man we've got a 15 year old child
[1:22:23] I would call teenagers standing fearless
[1:22:26] Lee in front of the greatest warrior of
[1:22:28] that time and saying he's gonna kill him
[1:22:30] in his army a man what a testimony now
[1:22:33] watch how David follows up with this
[1:22:34] testimony though because he puts it into
[1:22:36] context to say this isn't about me in
[1:22:39] verse 47 he says and all this assembly
[1:22:42] shall know that the Lord sayeth not with
[1:22:44] sword and spear for the battle is the
[1:22:46] Lord's and He will give you into our
[1:22:48] hands amen the battle is not ours I mean
[1:22:51] this is about giving the glory the honor
[1:22:52] and the praise to the one that gives us
[1:22:54] the victory that gives us the strength
[1:22:56] that gives us the overcoming power that
[1:22:58] gives us the overcoming life inside of
[1:23:00] us and I guarantee you the minute you
[1:23:02] start talking about something as if you
[1:23:03] did it God's gonna let you take a fall
[1:23:06] but David here his only testimony is
[1:23:08] what to give credit where it's due and
[1:23:10] that's what the God of Israel amen
[1:23:13] but what a testimony that he had there
[1:23:16] and I want you to notice and I've
[1:23:17] covered this I know in a previous sermon
[1:23:18] there in Newfoundland
[1:23:20] why was David so confident David was
[1:23:23] confident because he knew the land he
[1:23:25] was on was his he knew that he had the
[1:23:28] Covenant of circumcision in his body
[1:23:30] which meant that the Lord will be with
[1:23:31] them so he's standing on his land by
[1:23:33] covenant he has the proof of the
[1:23:35] Covenant in himself and on that basis he
[1:23:38] knows that he can take on any enemy in
[1:23:40] the land that God has given him and he
[1:23:42] can defeat him amen so what a type that
[1:23:44] is for the bride that what we ought to
[1:23:46] know what our land is and we know that
[1:23:49] what Ephesians types Joshua you want to
[1:23:51] start looking at what belongs to the
[1:23:52] bride start looking in the book of
[1:23:53] Ephesians because there's plenty in
[1:23:55] there that's available to the bride I
[1:23:57] like my brother
[1:23:58] mark talked about there in the song
[1:23:59] service where he said all those promises
[1:24:01] were what given to us when he took his
[1:24:05] place on the cross when he died every
[1:24:07] single promise that he made is available
[1:24:09] to us now
[1:24:10] there's nothing held back now that the
[1:24:12] same question has been settled forever
[1:24:13] you now I would say that every attribute
[1:24:14] promise is for us today whatever
[1:24:17] Christ's will was and whatever Christ is
[1:24:19] that's available to us so not just
[1:24:21] healing and deliverance but peace and
[1:24:23] joy and love and rest and long-suffering
[1:24:25] in these different things they all
[1:24:27] belong to us and there's nothing that
[1:24:29] should keep us from taking them amen
[1:24:31] so what look at Jesus testified of his
[1:24:35] death burial and resurrection so he
[1:24:37] testified yeah I'm gonna suffer a defeat
[1:24:38] of sorts a defeat but he said what in
[1:24:41] three days I'll rise up the game will
[1:24:43] restore this back to his former glory
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:46] and why did he do that because he knew
[1:24:48] the scripture he found himself in
[1:24:50] Scripture and he was confident that God
[1:24:52] will back it up and so he was they had
[1:24:53] no problem saying hey I'm gonna die but
[1:24:55] in three days I'll rise up again listen
[1:24:58] to what brother Branham said in the
[1:24:59] message this great warrior Joshua he
[1:25:01] said that's what we need you got to do
[1:25:03] some fighting not with your fists but
[1:25:06] with the power of God with your
[1:25:08] testimony that's how you overcome by the
[1:25:10] blood of the Lamb in your testimony tell
[1:25:12] the devil he's got no strings tied to
[1:25:15] you he says you put this disease on me
[1:25:17] but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he
[1:25:19] promised it to me amen if you've got a
[1:25:22] sound foundation in the word you know
[1:25:24] that this is the time and this is the
[1:25:25] place then you can do what stand for
[1:25:28] with your testimony and God will back it
[1:25:30] up every time but we've also seen what
[1:25:32] happens when you don't have the right
[1:25:35] kind of authority when you don't have
[1:25:36] God backing you off amen you think of
[1:25:38] the seven sons of Siva in acts 19 verse
[1:25:42] 13 says then certain of the Vagabond
[1:25:44] Jews Exorcist took upon them to call
[1:25:47] over them which had evil spirits by the
[1:25:49] name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure
[1:25:51] you by Jesus whom Paul preaches if I
[1:25:55] could put that into message terms we
[1:25:57] adjure you by Jesus who brother Branham
[1:25:59] preaches or Ron Spencer preaches or
[1:26:01] temperat preaches that's not how this
[1:26:03] works and says and there were seven sons
[1:26:06] of one Siva a Jew and the chief of the
[1:26:08] priests which did so so these are
[1:26:10] higher-ups in
[1:26:10] Church these are spiritual men and they
[1:26:13] go in there and they start trying to do
[1:26:15] things the way the Apostles did but they
[1:26:17] lack the authority to do it and the evil
[1:26:18] spirit answered and said Jesus I know
[1:26:20] and Paul I know who are you and the man
[1:26:23] in whom the evil spirit was leaped on
[1:26:25] them and overcame them and prevailed
[1:26:28] against them so that they fled out of
[1:26:30] that house naked and wounded then what
[1:26:32] happened when they didn't have what they
[1:26:34] thought they had when they presumed on
[1:26:36] Authority when they thought they knew
[1:26:37] how to handle the Word of God what
[1:26:39] happened
[1:26:40] Satan exposed him God isn't there to
[1:26:41] back them up they haven't had an
[1:26:43] experience they aren't under the shed
[1:26:45] blood they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:46] these are just men trying to profit off
[1:26:48] of what they saw somebody else doing and
[1:26:50] thought that they could do the same
[1:26:51] thing because they were spiritually
[1:26:53] minded maybe they weren't spiritually
[1:26:54] minded but they were certainly in a in a
[1:26:56] position of spiritual authority as
[1:26:58] members of the priests amen amen listen
[1:27:02] to what brother Graham says about that
[1:27:03] kind of situation he says now he he's
[1:27:05] speaking of Satan now Satan don't care
[1:27:07] how much you cut up see that ain't going
[1:27:10] to bother him you can't scare him
[1:27:11] there's only one thing that will move
[1:27:13] him that's true divine faith in Christ
[1:27:16] that'll take him right now he's afraid
[1:27:19] of that that's right when you really got
[1:27:21] the blood of Christ behind you back in
[1:27:23] your faith up moving like that he will
[1:27:26] move away he recognizes it amen that's
[1:27:28] in the message expectation you have to
[1:27:30] know what the word says about you and
[1:27:32] you have to know about the word says for
[1:27:34] your day you can't go around with this
[1:27:36] testimony God has told me to build an
[1:27:38] ark and I'm gonna save humanity
[1:27:39] that's not for this day I mean we've got
[1:27:41] lots of the scripture that doesn't apply
[1:27:43] to us
[1:27:43] amen there's lots of deliverances and
[1:27:45] judgments that came in times past and
[1:27:48] people got out of it by doing certain
[1:27:49] things but today we only have one way of
[1:27:51] escape amen and that's to follow that
[1:27:53] message of Malachi 4 through to a
[1:27:55] rapture because that's the only thing
[1:27:57] that's guaranteed to give us rapturing
[1:27:59] faith Amen you have to have that defined
[1:28:01] piece of land like David did the
[1:28:03] boundaries of Israel were clear and
[1:28:05] guess what they weren't supposed to go
[1:28:07] into Philistia they weren't supposed to
[1:28:09] go over to this land and that land in
[1:28:11] these different ones they were supposed
[1:28:13] to do what stay in their land and that's
[1:28:15] where they were to be blessed they
[1:28:16] didn't have to go and try and make a big
[1:28:18] you know empire out of it the way
[1:28:20] Alexander the Great did are these
[1:28:22] different ones the Romans and whatnot
[1:28:23] No God said I've given you a land stay
[1:28:26] in the land possess the land guard the
[1:28:28] land I'll be with you as long as you
[1:28:30] stay in the land and that's what were
[1:28:32] just asked to do stay with the word for
[1:28:34] your day
[1:28:34] stick with the word for your day and
[1:28:36] I'll back it up every single time
[1:28:37] amen brother Bram said this and the
[1:28:41] message the hours come he says now
[1:28:44] that's where we missed the blessings he
[1:28:46] says we're afraid to wait on God just a
[1:28:48] little bit see he says you've heard that
[1:28:51] song only wait again I hear that whisper
[1:28:54] only wait it won't be very long even now
[1:28:57] the father's hand is pleading soon with
[1:28:59] Jesus we will sing the victory song
[1:29:01] that's right he says just wait on God
[1:29:04] believe it confess it stay with it and
[1:29:06] God will bring it to pass for you what's
[1:29:08] the problem is sometimes we're seeing
[1:29:10] they're saying where's the victory I'm
[1:29:11] testifying I'm testifying I believe I
[1:29:13] believe and the victory hasn't come yet
[1:29:15] but you look at when they crossed into
[1:29:18] across the river Jordan they didn't get
[1:29:20] victory over Jericho the first time they
[1:29:23] went around and around and around and
[1:29:24] around and then they went around seven
[1:29:25] times in one day and it's only then that
[1:29:27] victory came and as they went through
[1:29:29] that land the cities to just not fall
[1:29:31] bang bang bang bang one after another
[1:29:32] just you know no no problem no
[1:29:35] resistance or anything it took them 10
[1:29:37] years to walk through that entire land
[1:29:39] and take the majority of it there was
[1:29:41] still some left over so brother Brown
[1:29:43] saying look just because you're
[1:29:44] testifying doesn't mean that God's gonna
[1:29:45] answer it right now right away
[1:29:47] now our expectation should be what God's
[1:29:50] gonna answer and hopefully soon
[1:29:53] hopefully right away but if he doesn't
[1:29:55] answer it doesn't change the fact that
[1:29:57] his word is true and he'll back it up
[1:29:58] every time I mean if you remember the
[1:30:00] story of John Ryan the blind man that
[1:30:02] went to brother Branham for prayer and
[1:30:04] he was in the prayer line brother Brown
[1:30:05] said you're healed he walked off the
[1:30:07] platform he couldn't see and the next
[1:30:10] day he still couldn't see so he comes
[1:30:11] back to brother Branham excuse me and he
[1:30:15] says what I thought you said I was
[1:30:17] healed and brother Brown said I thought
[1:30:19] you said you believed you were healed he
[1:30:21] said go and testify and you'll be you'll
[1:30:24] get your sight back and so he went for
[1:30:27] two weeks and he was selling papers on
[1:30:29] the side of the road there on the corner
[1:30:31] and telling people I'm healed of
[1:30:33] blindness I'm healed of blindness I'm
[1:30:34] healed of blindness and for two weeks
[1:30:36] he put up with what this
[1:30:37] Dick's the people sneering saying how
[1:30:39] whatever you can't see and I'm sure
[1:30:41] they're doing just like they did to
[1:30:42] Jesus you know slapping him on the face
[1:30:44] putting something what am i holding in
[1:30:46] front of you these different things and
[1:30:48] then what happens he's sitting in the
[1:30:49] barber chair and all of a sudden his
[1:30:51] eyes come open and he can see after two
[1:30:53] weeks but for two weeks he put up with
[1:30:55] what people making fun of them people
[1:30:58] saying that God wasn't real people
[1:31:00] saying he wasn't he didn't have faith
[1:31:02] that he didn't believe in these
[1:31:03] different things brother Branham says
[1:31:05] what we're afraid to wait on God just a
[1:31:07] little bit wait on God believe it
[1:31:10] confess it stay with it and God will
[1:31:13] bring it to pass for you amen if it's
[1:31:15] the right time the right season you have
[1:31:17] the right motive and the right objective
[1:31:19] amen your testimony is going to bring
[1:31:21] the victory but that's the struggle
[1:31:23] isn't it to try and find yourself in the
[1:31:24] right place at the right time I talked
[1:31:27] about how we have you know full access
[1:31:29] to Christ we have continuous access
[1:31:31] there's nothing that should stand
[1:31:32] between us in Christ today but how often
[1:31:35] are we taking advantage of it how often
[1:31:37] are we spending that time to stay close
[1:31:39] so that when something happens were
[1:31:42] right there we're ready to go in
[1:31:43] remember what brother Branham said about
[1:31:45] David he said he didn't have to pray up
[1:31:47] when he went to meet Goliath he was
[1:31:48] prayed up may says he was prayed up
[1:31:50] before the foundation of the world but
[1:31:52] the point is that David had that
[1:31:53] closeness with God and this is a man
[1:31:56] that was under the the blood of lambs
[1:31:58] not the blood of Christ but we have that
[1:32:00] access we have that availability we have
[1:32:03] that ability to be constantly in the
[1:32:05] presence of God amen
[1:32:06] so are we using it because it's not just
[1:32:09] enough enough to know what is the work
[1:32:11] for my day it's God what is your time
[1:32:13] what is your plan when do you want me to
[1:32:15] do this when do you want this to happen
[1:32:16] and when he wants us to move he comes on
[1:32:20] us and we're so sensitive to him then
[1:32:21] that as he does it then yes we move into
[1:32:24] it we step into that channel of
[1:32:25] inspiration you know we talk about
[1:32:27] inspiration a lot for ministers and
[1:32:29] whatnot to be found
[1:32:30] what in the mind of God to bring a
[1:32:32] certain message to the people but that
[1:32:34] inspiration or inspiration of the Holy
[1:32:36] Spirit is not just for ministry I mean
[1:32:39] that's where every single son and
[1:32:40] daughter of God that has the Holy Ghost
[1:32:42] is to do what lead them in their life to
[1:32:44] lead them into their kingdom purpose and
[1:32:46] day by day moment by moment help them to
[1:32:49] find what is the will of God
[1:32:51] thing that it takes sensitivity to the
[1:32:53] Holy Spirit and that only comes with
[1:32:55] time prayer with reading the words so
[1:32:57] that you recognize when he's moving and
[1:32:59] when he's asking you to do something he
[1:33:01] meant look at what Jesus did he walked
[1:33:03] up to the Pool of Bethesda and healed
[1:33:05] one man and there were certainly dozens
[1:33:07] maybe hundreds possibly even thousands
[1:33:09] of people there and yet he walked up and
[1:33:12] he only healed one and brother Bram said
[1:33:14] Jesus had to say a gift like what
[1:33:17] brother Bram did he said God showed him
[1:33:19] what he was supposed to do so he walked
[1:33:21] in and He healed one man and he walked
[1:33:24] right back out of there so many needs he
[1:33:26] had the power to do it all he had the
[1:33:28] authority to do it all but he didn't
[1:33:30] have the leadership to do it so he only
[1:33:31] walks in he touches the one man and
[1:33:34] walks out and I don't know why he did
[1:33:36] that maybe it's only because there was
[1:33:37] one that had faith may be only one have
[1:33:39] faith to be healed I don't know but
[1:33:41] there was a unity that he had that tied
[1:33:43] him to God's will where he would only do
[1:33:45] what the father showed him and that's
[1:33:46] what he said he said I only do that
[1:33:48] which the father shows me amen but now
[1:33:51] he says you've got to have that same
[1:33:53] thing John 15 verse 4 says abide in me
[1:33:56] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[1:33:59] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[1:34:01] vine no more can ye except ye abide in
[1:34:05] me I am the vine ye are the branches he
[1:34:08] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:34:10] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:34:13] ye can do nothing if a man abide not in
[1:34:16] me he's cast forth as a branch and is
[1:34:18] withered and men gather them and cast
[1:34:20] them into the fire and they are burned
[1:34:21] if ye abide in me and my words abide in
[1:34:25] you you shall ask what you will and it
[1:34:27] shall be done unto you amen he talks
[1:34:28] about what abiding and you don't get
[1:34:30] abiding by darting in and out of the
[1:34:32] presence of God in and out I need this I
[1:34:34] need that we only go in a time of need
[1:34:35] we only go in times of great desperation
[1:34:38] but he says what I buy continuously
[1:34:40] present with him they men we see this
[1:34:42] prosperity gospel that's so prevalent
[1:34:44] today and they talk a lot about what
[1:34:46] speaking things speaking good things
[1:34:48] into your life but how many of them talk
[1:34:50] about abiding in the presence of Christ
[1:34:52] and how many of them talk about getting
[1:34:54] into the channel of the Holy Spirit to
[1:34:56] speak they don't they just say just
[1:34:58] speak good things and they'll come into
[1:34:59] your life and guess what God gives a lot
[1:35:01] of them exactly what they asked for why
[1:35:02] because that's what the scripture says
[1:35:04] yeah
[1:35:04] ask a Miss according to what the lust of
[1:35:06] your flesh and he gives them to you half
[1:35:08] the time he gives them to you why
[1:35:09] because that's what you're gonna you
[1:35:11] know that's your focus that your that's
[1:35:13] what you're looking for and he just
[1:35:14] gives you what you want lets you fall
[1:35:15] into your own trap amen but the whole
[1:35:18] the true believer what do they want they
[1:35:20] want to be led and directed by the Holy
[1:35:21] Spirit every single day of their life
[1:35:23] they men we want God's timing we want
[1:35:25] God's purpose we've got want God's will
[1:35:27] that means we want God's job for us that
[1:35:30] means we want God's home for us that
[1:35:32] means we want God's vehicle for us God's
[1:35:33] church for us God's pasture for us cuz
[1:35:36] vacation for us God's clothes for us all
[1:35:39] of these different things and guess what
[1:35:40] that varies from person to person but
[1:35:42] regardless whatever he wants for each
[1:35:44] one of us that's what we want to do amen
[1:35:46] that doesn't come easy and you know
[1:35:50] we've been reading the supernatural
[1:35:51] series for a couple years now with the
[1:35:53] kids in the evenings and you see how
[1:35:55] many times brother branham walks into a
[1:35:57] situation and God tells him to go but
[1:36:01] God doesn't necessarily tell him how
[1:36:02] things are gonna work how long it's
[1:36:04] gonna take what's gonna transpire to
[1:36:06] make it come to pass and brother Branham
[1:36:08] in some of these situations would pray
[1:36:10] for hours and hours in healing lines
[1:36:13] especially early on in his ministry he
[1:36:15] plays pray sometimes for two or three
[1:36:17] hours for the first person up there
[1:36:19] remember he'd tell him to bring the
[1:36:20] worst one up and he'd pray for them and
[1:36:22] he'd pray and he pray and he pray and
[1:36:24] then it'd be healed now God didn't show
[1:36:26] him that that person was going to be
[1:36:27] healed that was pure faith but he had
[1:36:29] that commission from the angel go pray
[1:36:31] for the sick and the ministry that he
[1:36:33] had in these different things right so
[1:36:35] if that's what the prophets got to do
[1:36:37] imagine what its gonna be like for us
[1:36:38] it's certainly not going to be any
[1:36:40] different God's not going to give us a
[1:36:41] pass where we don't have to do what
[1:36:43] spend time before him
[1:36:45] have faith hold on to the promise keep
[1:36:47] looking to Him abiding in his presence
[1:36:49] they meant spending that time in prayer
[1:36:51] spending that time in the word so that
[1:36:53] we know when he's moving I think we've
[1:36:55] made it too difficult sometimes where
[1:36:57] we're looking for a voice from heaven or
[1:36:59] something and quite honestly I think so
[1:37:01] often at least for me two ways you'll
[1:37:04] find it you'll get a piece about
[1:37:05] something or you'll open the scripture
[1:37:07] and the answers right there for you and
[1:37:09] it jumps out at you and you know exactly
[1:37:10] what you're supposed to do we don't have
[1:37:12] to have an angel come in the room and
[1:37:14] show us these things but God can give us
[1:37:16] confidence
[1:37:16] reading is word by time and prayer to
[1:37:18] where we're settled and then we have
[1:37:20] that function to do things and I think
[1:37:21] in the times I've spoken to many of you
[1:37:24] there in the church in Newfoundland you
[1:37:26] had unction to do things and you went in
[1:37:28] prayer and you know thinking of Joe with
[1:37:30] his business in these different things
[1:37:31] and you're praying and you're praying
[1:37:34] for weeks and weeks and you don't know
[1:37:36] what to do you don't know what to do and
[1:37:37] then all of a sudden you know what to do
[1:37:38] and it works out exactly the way that
[1:37:40] you believed it would why because you
[1:37:42] spent that time with prayer you had that
[1:37:44] continous fellowship that time seeking
[1:37:46] him and then he comes through and he
[1:37:47] gives us the answer amen think about
[1:37:51] this revelation 10:1 we see that mighty
[1:37:54] angel coming down and it says and who
[1:37:57] was it we know it was Christ amen it's
[1:37:59] very clear in the scripture when you
[1:38:01] compare him to who it was in revelation
[1:38:02] 1 but what was above him when he comes
[1:38:04] down there it's a rainbow
[1:38:06] then brother Branham and the message the
[1:38:08] breech he says this is our covenant
[1:38:09] angel and what was the Covenant that he
[1:38:11] was coming down for every single promise
[1:38:14] that he had ever made for the Gentile
[1:38:16] church is going to be fulfilled now in
[1:38:19] this final age he's coming down as the
[1:38:21] covenant angel he's not standing back
[1:38:23] now and giving a little bit to this one
[1:38:24] and a little bit to that one through the
[1:38:26] ages but now he's coming back in the
[1:38:28] fullness of his power to take what the
[1:38:30] full bride the full word bride and he's
[1:38:33] coming down under a covenant what to
[1:38:35] fulfill every single promise that he is
[1:38:37] placed in the scripture for us so I ask
[1:38:39] you today what is the promise that he
[1:38:41] will not fulfill today for each and
[1:38:42] every one of us show me one thing in the
[1:38:44] word that is given to the Gentiles that
[1:38:46] he will not fulfill for each and every
[1:38:48] one of us if we will hold that word if
[1:38:50] we will testify that word into our lives
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:53] that scripture revelation 10:1 is Christ
[1:38:57] himself coming down not sending somebody
[1:38:59] else not sending a messenger not sending
[1:39:02] Gabriel or these Michael or these
[1:39:04] different ones this is Christ himself
[1:39:05] coming down to personally fulfill the
[1:39:08] last of those promises and take his
[1:39:10] bride away amen so he's right here now
[1:39:12] he's right here now working with us for
[1:39:15] overcoming power amen for the Branham
[1:39:17] said a positive mental attitude towards
[1:39:19] the promises of God would bring them to
[1:39:21] pass in your life but remember it's not
[1:39:23] just an attitude thinking's not just
[1:39:25] enough if you go back to the original
[1:39:27] you know in Genesis it didn't say in God
[1:39:30] about light God said let there be light
[1:39:32] amen there has to be a word spoken there
[1:39:34] has to be a testimony there has to be an
[1:39:36] affirmation there has to be a confession
[1:39:39] of what you believe so it's not just
[1:39:41] enough to have the right mental attitude
[1:39:42] but what with that right mental attitude
[1:39:44] you'll start to talk about it you'll
[1:39:46] start to speak about it and that will
[1:39:48] start to develop faith in your life if
[1:39:50] you don't have it and then pretty soon
[1:39:51] that very thing is coming forth in you
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:54] it's not enough to believe you have to
[1:39:56] confess with your mouth amen
[1:39:59] all right we're starting to close we're
[1:40:01] gonna read the last little bit of
[1:40:02] revelation 12:11 which is the death it
[1:40:05] says and they overcame him by the blood
[1:40:06] of the Lamb and by the word of their
[1:40:08] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:40:11] unto the death amen here we see the
[1:40:14] effect of the blood of the Lamb in the
[1:40:15] word of the testimony on the Saints in
[1:40:18] that time on the believers of that time
[1:40:19] or the Christians at that time and what
[1:40:21] is it they didn't love their lives they
[1:40:23] died they gave up their lives for what
[1:40:25] they said they believed amen but
[1:40:27] remember brother Branham points back to
[1:40:29] this scripture not just for the Saints
[1:40:31] of the tribulation time but he says this
[1:40:33] is for every child and every son of God
[1:40:35] but of the lamb in the testimony the
[1:40:38] word of their testimony Amen so that
[1:40:39] means there has to be a death that comes
[1:40:41] for each and every one of us but we know
[1:40:44] that our death is not the natural type
[1:40:46] like they do in the tribulation right
[1:40:47] we're gonna go in a rapture we don't see
[1:40:49] death so this is a death that is
[1:40:51] different and what is it we talked about
[1:40:53] it earlier this is a debt to self this
[1:40:55] is a debt to pride this is a debt to our
[1:40:57] own carnal nature and thoughts and
[1:40:59] disciplines and these different things
[1:41:00] so I want to dig down a little bit
[1:41:02] deeper into this as we start to close MN
[1:41:05] so what is true death true death is what
[1:41:09] separation from God so that's what when
[1:41:13] they gave it up when they give it up in
[1:41:15] the tribulation it's not true death for
[1:41:16] them it's just carnal death it's they
[1:41:18] lose their life but they get you know
[1:41:20] they get eternal life on the other side
[1:41:21] and whatnot but our true death is what
[1:41:24] death the self so that we can have true
[1:41:26] life which is what true light is unity
[1:41:29] with Christ amen true life is unity with
[1:41:31] God so we're giving up all of our selves
[1:41:33] we're giving up all of our ideas and
[1:41:34] attitudes and opinions why so that we
[1:41:37] can have true life which is unity with
[1:41:39] God amen and what does that do
[1:41:42] prophet said our death puts our
[1:41:44] selves in the position for God to show
[1:41:45] himself amen
[1:41:47] what he says in this he says what was
[1:41:49] Jesus meant what was Jesus manifested
[1:41:52] for to show God then he says he was God
[1:41:55] not just to show God he says he was God
[1:41:58] he had to be no man could die no prophet
[1:42:01] could die he was God he was the God of
[1:42:03] the prophets he was the prophets he was
[1:42:06] the kings he was the history he was he
[1:42:08] that was to come he that was he that is
[1:42:11] and he that's to be in this day the same
[1:42:13] yesterday today and forever he was
[1:42:16] manifested for that purpose
[1:42:19] what to put God in a position to show
[1:42:22] himself amen let me drop in something
[1:42:24] here real quickly because Christ didn't
[1:42:27] think it robbery to be equal with God
[1:42:29] and why is that they take it back to the
[1:42:31] scriptures and read it in Philippians 2
[1:42:34] verse 5 it says let this mind be in you
[1:42:37] so there's a way of thinking there's a
[1:42:39] he says let this mind be in you which
[1:42:41] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[1:42:44] the form of God thought it not robbery
[1:42:45] to be equal to God but listen to the
[1:42:48] effect it has it said he but made
[1:42:50] himself of no reputation and took upon
[1:42:52] him the form of a servant and was made
[1:42:54] in the likeness of man and being found
[1:42:57] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[1:42:59] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:43:02] death of the cross and being found in
[1:43:04] fashion as a man he showed he humbled
[1:43:07] himself and became oh I'm reading it all
[1:43:09] over again I put it in twice in my notes
[1:43:11] he humble himself and became obedient
[1:43:12] unto death even the death of the Cross
[1:43:15] so why wasn't it robbery to be equal
[1:43:17] with God because God was expressing his
[1:43:20] will and is perfect so perfectly through
[1:43:21] Christ that there was no difference
[1:43:24] between the actions of God and the
[1:43:26] actions of Christ amen there was no
[1:43:28] difference between Jesus the man if you
[1:43:30] will the body and the thoughts of God
[1:43:32] all of God was he poured into Christ and
[1:43:35] so now Christ is walking he's living his
[1:43:38] breathing and every word he says every
[1:43:39] attitude he shows every action every
[1:43:41] miracle it's what God through him so
[1:43:45] when he says he didn't it wasn't robbery
[1:43:48] for him to be equal with God why was it
[1:43:50] because you couldn't take a razor blade
[1:43:53] and separate Christ from God in terms of
[1:43:55] his actions
[1:43:56] his spirit his anointing everything
[1:43:58] about him was God and so he said I am
[1:44:01] God and he was why because God was
[1:44:04] perfectly expressed through him but look
[1:44:06] at the effect it has it doesn't make
[1:44:08] Jesus some big man some big shot that
[1:44:10] has some big ministry and drawing men to
[1:44:12] him and this and that the scripture says
[1:44:14] he humbled himself him any made himself
[1:44:16] of no reputation and he became obedient
[1:44:19] unto death that's the effect that unity
[1:44:22] with God will have on us it'll humble us
[1:44:25] it'll make us of no reputation and it'll
[1:44:27] make us obedient until every aspect of
[1:44:30] our human lives becomes obedient and
[1:44:32] dies away amen even to the point where
[1:44:35] Jesus had this slow agonizing brutal
[1:44:38] death he's whipped he was marred as no
[1:44:40] man was and he willingly gave himself to
[1:44:43] that and then he goes to the cross and
[1:44:44] hangs there with his feet in his arms
[1:44:47] nailed crown of thorns in him stabbed in
[1:44:50] his side goes through all of that why
[1:44:52] because that was the purpose of God that
[1:44:54] was the plan of God that was the will of
[1:44:55] God for him amen and what a reward he
[1:44:58] got for that and then if we continue
[1:45:00] reading there it says wherefore God had
[1:45:02] also highly exalted him and given him a
[1:45:05] name which is above every name that at
[1:45:07] the name of Jesus every knee should bow
[1:45:09] of things in heaven and things in earth
[1:45:12] and things under the earth and that
[1:45:13] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[1:45:16] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[1:45:18] amen
[1:45:19] what did it take though he had to go
[1:45:22] through that slow agonizing death and
[1:45:24] I'm sad to say it this way but guess
[1:45:26] what each and every one of us has what
[1:45:29] is usually a slow agonizing death
[1:45:30] because we give ourselves you know that
[1:45:33] when we give our lives over to Christ
[1:45:34] when we surrender when we first accept
[1:45:37] the you know the sacrifice and we repent
[1:45:39] in these different things we give our
[1:45:40] life to him but that's only the start
[1:45:43] this is a progressive walk we grow we
[1:45:46] mature we strengthen through our walk
[1:45:48] and that only comes through what that
[1:45:50] slow agonizing death to self and it's
[1:45:54] constant and it's day in and day out in
[1:45:56] some days he's using the whip and he's
[1:45:58] yanking stuff out of us and other days
[1:46:00] it's kind of just a slow peeling you
[1:46:02] know he's clipping the toenails so to
[1:46:03] speak taking off little things to form
[1:46:06] us and fashion us into his way but it is
[1:46:09] a slow and agonizing thing
[1:46:10] we have to be willing to go through it
[1:46:12] we have to be willing to let him go and
[1:46:14] put us through that process why so that
[1:46:17] we can say just like him we are Christ
[1:46:20] amen we are so close we are so unified
[1:46:22] that his actions and ours cannot be
[1:46:24] separated that his mind his thoughts his
[1:46:27] opinions his preferences are exactly the
[1:46:29] same as ours amen listen to what brother
[1:46:33] Branham says here in the message Christ
[1:46:35] is a mystery God revealed he's talking
[1:46:38] about the threefold purpose of the
[1:46:39] Church of Christ amen it says and
[1:46:42] through that purpose he achieved a
[1:46:43] church that he the fullness of God might
[1:46:46] bring to pass every promised Word of God
[1:46:48] in these last days how through the death
[1:46:50] of the believers to self they men so
[1:46:52] that he could have the preeminence he
[1:46:54] says when he gets the preeminence is the
[1:46:56] preeminence in the church the position
[1:46:58] is placed in the church jesus said he
[1:47:00] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:47:02] shall he also even more than this shall
[1:47:05] he do for I go to my father see that was
[1:47:08] his purpose that was the manifestation
[1:47:10] and now today he wants to get somebody
[1:47:13] that can so see it that they can let the
[1:47:16] word him and he breaks in on him itself
[1:47:18] that he says see Jesus so seen it so was
[1:47:21] so perfectly born for the day until God
[1:47:24] expressed every move that he made he was
[1:47:27] God's revelation God revealed I'm gonna
[1:47:29] read that again it's so tremendous he
[1:47:31] said Jesus so seen what seeing what he
[1:47:34] was meant to do see what God wanted to
[1:47:36] do so perfectly born for the day and
[1:47:38] that is no different for us today we are
[1:47:40] perfectly born for the day until God
[1:47:43] expressed every move that he made he was
[1:47:46] God's revelation God revealed amen and
[1:47:48] that's no different for us today how he
[1:47:51] sanctified with his spirit and blood a
[1:47:53] church that he might make every promise
[1:47:55] in this last day be revealed catch that
[1:47:59] he's wanting to reveal every promise for
[1:48:01] the last day how in the bride the same
[1:48:04] way he did in Christ now see he could go
[1:48:06] back and pick up what these other
[1:48:07] fellows had left off here in the last
[1:48:09] days and by His Holy Spirit reveal all
[1:48:12] the mystery of the seven seals see he's
[1:48:14] expressing himself that's his purpose
[1:48:16] he's talking about today now that's why
[1:48:18] he died that's the second fold of his
[1:48:21] threefold manifestation
[1:48:23] to express himself in Christ then
[1:48:26] express himself through the church and
[1:48:27] the same thing that Christ was the word
[1:48:30] and the church becomes the word when it
[1:48:32] lets the word go through them hallelujah
[1:48:35] can you just imagine so close that we
[1:48:39] become the very word that when somebody
[1:48:41] says where is the word you can say
[1:48:43] you're looking at it Amen just like that
[1:48:45] well survival where is the Ralphs
[1:48:47] revival you're looking at it it's in me
[1:48:49] Damon brother Brown continues he said
[1:48:51] thoroughly to restore the kingdom to its
[1:48:53] rightful position that fell by sin by
[1:48:55] the first Adam back to where he walked
[1:48:58] in the cool of the evening with his
[1:49:00] people talked with them and fellowship
[1:49:02] with them he meant God's looking for a
[1:49:04] full and complete expression of himself
[1:49:07] in this church at the end time and
[1:49:08] what's it going to take death death to
[1:49:10] ourselves for the Bram said this he said
[1:49:13] notice when a man is hungry and
[1:49:15] thirsting for God God will draw nigh to
[1:49:17] the man always see he says give up
[1:49:19] surrender your will to God amen Christ
[1:49:23] was God's will and plan being living and
[1:49:25] displayed and that's exactly what he's
[1:49:27] looking for in this church amen when we
[1:49:29] take on the mind of Christ when the
[1:49:31] bride takes on the mind of Christ what
[1:49:33] does she do humbles herself is obedient
[1:49:35] makes herself of no reputation points to
[1:49:38] him gives him all the glory the honor
[1:49:40] and the credit and then what happens we
[1:49:43] get identified now we're not just
[1:49:45] identified with the sacrifice in terms
[1:49:47] of he took my place and now I have is
[1:49:49] the right to his apperture buttes but
[1:49:51] now we actually have the very life we
[1:49:54] have the very name we have everything
[1:49:56] that Christ is now what embedded into an
[1:49:59] endtime Bride amen we can say in this
[1:50:02] age and if you can't say it now you'll
[1:50:04] be able to say it by the end of all
[1:50:06] things in this age I am Christ amen I am
[1:50:09] the word Philippians 2 verse 12 says
[1:50:12] wherefore my beloved as she have always
[1:50:15] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[1:50:17] now much more in my absence work out
[1:50:20] your own salvation with fear and
[1:50:21] trembling I spoke on this last time why
[1:50:23] because you can't do it only he can do
[1:50:26] it for it is God which worketh in you
[1:50:28] both to will and do of his good pleasure
[1:50:31] I mean that's for the Bride of Christ it
[1:50:32] is God that works in you to will to make
[1:50:35] you want to do
[1:50:36] what he has for you and to do it so
[1:50:39] he'll put the right desire in you and
[1:50:41] then he'll give you the right pot he'll
[1:50:42] give you the power to do it as well he
[1:50:44] men why his good pleasure do all things
[1:50:47] without murmuring and disputing and we
[1:50:51] often think that's murmuring disputing
[1:50:53] amongst ourselves and it just jumped out
[1:50:55] at me
[1:50:55] that's not murmuring disputing amongst
[1:50:57] ourselves that's murmuring and disputing
[1:50:59] with God god I don't want to do this I
[1:51:01] don't want to go there I don't want to
[1:51:03] be stuck in that position I don't want
[1:51:04] this job I don't want this place I don't
[1:51:06] want this church I don't want to have to
[1:51:08] talk to that person I don't want to have
[1:51:10] to humble myself I don't want to have to
[1:51:11] apologize right murmuring disputing God
[1:51:17] don't make me do this and then I went
[1:51:19] read the amplified and this is I thought
[1:51:21] that and then I went let me check the
[1:51:23] amplified it said do all things without
[1:51:24] grumbling and fault-finding and
[1:51:26] complaining against God and then
[1:51:29] questioning and doubting among
[1:51:31] yourselves so don't go to God and
[1:51:33] complain and then don't go and start
[1:51:34] talking to other people about your
[1:51:36] problems and you're not happy with this
[1:51:37] and you don't want to do that and debt
[1:51:39] to debt today he says don't do it why
[1:51:41] that ye may be blameless and harmless
[1:51:44] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[1:51:46] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[1:51:48] and if there's a time that there's a
[1:51:50] crooked and perverse nation it's today a
[1:51:51] man among whom he's shine as lights in
[1:51:55] the world so what's our goal then we're
[1:51:58] talking about the word of our testimony
[1:51:59] we're talking about total victory it's
[1:52:02] to be as Jesus was so United with Christ
[1:52:04] then nobody could separate the two that
[1:52:07] he doesn't separate the two more
[1:52:09] importantly it's not what others think
[1:52:10] but that Christ identifies himself with
[1:52:12] us I'm in the head of the body and all
[1:52:15] together we are one amen but victory is
[1:52:17] total surrender to yourself and total
[1:52:20] acceptance of what God has for you lay
[1:52:22] men when you die out and Christ alone
[1:52:24] lives within you amen he is Satan as
[1:52:27] sealed out because you've been so filled
[1:52:29] with the Holy Spirit that he has no
[1:52:31] access to you that try as he might and
[1:52:33] get into those five outward senses and
[1:52:35] your imagination these different things
[1:52:37] he comes in and he hits that inner man
[1:52:39] he just gets shocked every single time
[1:52:41] he backs away saying I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:52:43] try another day I'm gonna try another
[1:52:45] time hey men I'm gonna close with this
[1:52:47] quote as an encouragement it speaks of
[1:52:49] the Warrior
[1:52:50] Christian amen the rugged soldier the
[1:52:52] experienced soldier to me it's a real
[1:52:54] anchor point for believers because in
[1:52:56] the end this comes back to lies that
[1:52:59] were believers in the first place but
[1:53:01] the bram says this Jesus might have said
[1:53:02] now in order to go back to the original
[1:53:04] God has to speak again
[1:53:06] that's what he does when he gives you
[1:53:08] the new birth your old life is gone and
[1:53:10] you're back to the original word of the
[1:53:12] Lord if you're not your hybrid in two
[1:53:15] churches denominations but when God
[1:53:17] speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit
[1:53:19] then you're back in the original family
[1:53:21] of God again you don't have to be baby
[1:53:23] then you're a rugged Christian who can
[1:53:26] stand it go to the cross to the fiery
[1:53:29] furnace to the lion's den or wherever it
[1:53:31] may be
[1:53:32] because the word of the Living God is
[1:53:34] burning in your heart and soul and all
[1:53:36] else can backslide all can turn against
[1:53:38] you and everything else but that one
[1:53:40] that won't stop one thing Amen that
[1:53:43] rugged Word of God stays right there
[1:53:45] when he spoke that original voice into
[1:53:48] your heart and said you are mine
[1:53:51] amen what a rest and what a confidence
[1:53:53] we have that we are here and we believe
[1:53:56] him and believers believe it's not
[1:53:58] because we chose it not because there
[1:53:59] are anything in and of ourselves not
[1:54:01] because we decide to do it but because
[1:54:02] he said you are mine that original voice
[1:54:06] said you are mine and that's the word
[1:54:08] we've heard in this day come out of her
[1:54:09] my people you're not of them amen you
[1:54:12] are mine amen how are we gonna get it
[1:54:14] under the blood through the token of the
[1:54:17] Holy Spirit speaking and testifying of
[1:54:20] the word of God for our day amen let's
[1:54:22] just bow our heads together if we would
[1:54:24] Lord Jesus your word is so tremendous
[1:54:27] lorda just gives us such a faith such a
[1:54:29] hope such a confidence toward to read
[1:54:31] these wonderful things that you put in
[1:54:33] there Lord in such a simple Scripture
[1:54:35] Lord the Lord the depth of it board that
[1:54:38] we take on you Lord that because you
[1:54:40] took away us Lord we can have you not
[1:54:43] just a part of you Lord but every single
[1:54:45] aspect of you every attribute Lord Jesus
[1:54:47] Lord and we need it today Lord we need
[1:54:50] it to overcome ourselves or we need it
[1:54:52] to overcome this world that's around us
[1:54:54] Lord Jesus would you just help us to
[1:54:56] surrender Lord today Lord those things
[1:54:58] we've been fighting more those things
[1:55:00] we've been pushing back Lord where we've
[1:55:02] said no I want
[1:55:03] hold onto that a bit more Lord where
[1:55:05] we've held onto attitudes where we've
[1:55:07] held on to our being right or where
[1:55:09] we've held onto disputes with those
[1:55:10] around us or where we've been riled up
[1:55:13] by what's going on Lord we say just take
[1:55:15] it away Lord and give us your peace and
[1:55:16] rest Lord and help us to walk according
[1:55:19] to your purpose Lord to testify of the
[1:55:21] word that you inspire to our hearts in
[1:55:23] this last endtime age Lord bless your
[1:55:26] people give them rest the night Lord
