[42:45] we're thankful for all those that have
[42:46] put in the hard work and put their
[42:48] shoulder to the wheel to get this done
[42:50] of course the trustees but also the
[42:51] brothers and sisters that came out to
[42:53] help clean up and move things out and we
[42:56] know there's much more work to be done
[42:57] over the coming days but thankful for
[42:59] that amen Happy Father's Day to each
[43:02] that is a father here today I think the
[43:05] U.S in the U.S they did a study that
[43:07] said that basically if you don't have a
[43:09] father then you've got a 75 chance of
[43:11] going into drugs and illicit behavior
[43:15] and going to jail and all these
[43:17] different things you're blessed if
[43:18] you've got a father today amen but if
[43:20] you don't have a father today you've got
[43:21] a Heavenly Father amen you've got
[43:23] somebody here that is that is greater
[43:25] than any father we could have in this
[43:27] world no matter how much of the Holy
[43:28] Ghost they have no matter how much of
[43:30] this message they believe amen are our
[43:32] real father amen is our heavenly father

[44:28] my knees unto the father of our Lord
[44:30] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[44:33] Heaven and Earth is named that he would
[44:36] Grant you according to the riches of his
[44:38] glory to be strengthened with might by
[44:41] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[44:44] May dwell in your hearts by faith that
[44:46] ye being rooted and grounded in love
[44:49] may be able to comprehend with All
[44:52] Saints what is the breadth and the
[44:55] length and the depth and the height and
[44:58] to know the love of Christ which passes
[45:00] knowledge that ye might be filled with
[45:03] all the fullness of God Amen God bless
[45:06] you can take your seats this morning and
[45:08] we're continuing our our series on
[45:10] Redemption I want to take a second
[45:12] service on this thought of the placing
[45:14] of the name and we spent last service
[45:16] and I'm sorry for the echo today we
[45:17] can't really do much about it they're
[45:19] going to turn me down a bit thank you
[45:20] brother vaishal but I love it in the
[45:22] singing I got to be honest I love the
[45:24] echo I know it's not great for the
[45:25] musicians but I just love to hear the
[45:27] sound just full in this room it reminds
[45:29] me of our old little church you know and
[45:31] that's the only thing I think I miss
[45:32] about that little church is that we
[45:34] could fill it with sound and here we
[45:36] can't fill it with sound we need about
[45:37] another 100 more people to do that but
[45:39] it is I I just love to sit in the office
[45:42] there and just hear the sound just
[45:43] filling up the sanctuary men but
[45:46] um you know we'll by God's grace once we
[45:48] get the carpet in that will help in the
[45:49] past hiding in the pews and whatnot
[45:51] remember we're speaking on the placing
[45:53] of the name again and last service we
[45:55] talked about the name changes that God
[45:56] had given we talked about Abram to
[45:58] Abraham and Sarai to Sarah and Jacob to
[46:01] Israel and Saul to Paul and these
[46:03] different things and we showed how God
[46:05] always gave a name change right before
[46:07] he was going to bring his word to pass
[46:09] before he was going to manifest it
[46:10] before he was going to reveal it before
[46:12] he was going to give the promise he gave
[46:14] a name change to those people and even
[46:16] Moses Moses didn't come in his name he
[46:18] came in the name of I am and he came
[46:20] down in the name of I am come down to
[46:22] deliver in these different things and we
[46:24] talked about people that have been
[46:25] predestinated amen they didn't earn it
[46:28] they didn't they didn't work it up they
[46:29] didn't call it down but God had
[46:31] predestinated them to be somebody to be
[46:33] something or to receive something and it
[46:36] was God's grace from start to finish and
[46:38] it was God's plans all along and I want
[46:40] to stop there and just say this my plan
[46:42] doesn't matter
[46:43] if you've been a Christian for a year if
[46:45] you've been a Christian for a week it
[46:46] doesn't matter you find out that our
[46:48] plans don't matter we can have ideas we
[46:50] can say this is how it would work best
[46:52] and here's how it should really progress
[46:54] and here's the way I see it going and
[46:56] then God comes down and he does it
[46:57] completely different and his way is
[46:59] perfect and ours is not and we've got to
[47:01] understand that we've got to be willing
[47:03] to to recognize those things that my
[47:05] skills my talents your skills your
[47:07] talents your your DNA your genetics your
[47:10] family line your family heritage it
[47:11] means nothing to God it means nothing to
[47:14] God in fact you'll see and I share this
[47:16] I think on the choir chat recently that
[47:18] God's calling for separators not mixers
[47:21] and he separates you from your family
[47:22] and he separates you from this and he
[47:24] separates you from that why he wants to
[47:26] get you to where you'll listen to him
[47:27] and him alone and you'll follow his word
[47:30] and his word alone and when you do that
[47:31] then he's got something that he can work
[47:33] with I've got a quote maybe I'll share
[47:35] in a future service where brother bam
[47:37] said God wants somebody he can put his
[47:39] hands on
[47:40] he wants somebody that he can move that
[47:42] he can he can change that he can use
[47:44] that he can bring to a place where they
[47:46] can do his work where they can be his
[47:48] hands and they can be his feet in this
[47:49] world Amen but the only thing that I
[47:52] have to offer will hinder God
[47:54] that's the simple truth is anything that
[47:56] I bring will hinder God if I bring it in
[47:58] and of myself but if I surrender to him
[48:00] now whatever I have he can use or he can
[48:03] disuse he can choose not to use it but
[48:05] if he picks it up then it's him but if I
[48:07] say I've got to do this or I've got to
[48:08] do that or I want to use this or I want
[48:10] to use that then we can't get there we
[48:12] can't get there we look at Abram and
[48:14] Sarai before they got their name changes
[48:16] and they knew they had a promise the
[48:18] word had come to them God himself had
[48:20] come to Abraham and said you're going to
[48:22] have a son and you're going to be the
[48:23] father of many nations and then from
[48:25] that point on they spent years they
[48:27] spend decades walking around and they're
[48:29] getting older and older and more and
[48:31] more wrinkly and they started to have
[48:33] ideas about how they could bring God's
[48:35] word to pass church we can't make it
[48:38] happen it is God's plan and therefore it
[48:40] is God's timing and we've got to step
[48:42] into his plan rather than try and make
[48:45] it happen in our life because we see
[48:46] that Abram and sarai's plan all it
[48:49] brought was all of the unrest in the
[48:51] Middle East and we're still paying for
[48:52] it today because they got an idea of how
[48:55] they could make God's plan come to pass
[48:56] in their life you can't do it you've got
[48:59] to believe it you've got to walk with
[49:01] him you've got to rest in him and then
[49:03] when it's his timing he's going to bring
[49:05] it to pass in our life amen there's a
[49:07] fine line between sitting still and
[49:10] being faithless
[49:11] and rather being faithful and patient
[49:14] until the timing because if we sit and
[49:16] we sit and we sit and nothing ever
[49:18] happens then that's something gone wrong
[49:20] because God is always moving but the
[49:22] goal is to see the progression of God to
[49:24] see that God has taken us bit by bit and
[49:26] we see with Abram and Sarai as they
[49:28] surrender to the real truth and the real
[49:30] Call of God they started to see changes
[49:32] because God told Abraham separate
[49:34] yourself from your family and the first
[49:36] thing he did was he took his dad and he
[49:38] took his nephew
[49:39] and then his dad died
[49:41] and then he finally separated from lot
[49:43] and as soon as he separated from lot God
[49:45] comes down says now I'm going to do it
[49:47] and it still took years it still took
[49:49] years but God came down and said now
[49:51] that you've fully obeyed now it's time
[49:54] for you to step into the full promise of
[49:55] God and sometimes the only thing that's
[49:57] hindering is our lack of obedience is
[50:00] our lack of obedience it's not that God
[50:01] isn't willing to do it it's that he's
[50:03] saying I've given you the first step
[50:04] I've given you the ABCs and you haven't
[50:07] even done the ABCs and you're saying I
[50:09] want the algebra now remember brother
[50:10] Brahm says I can't teach what
[50:12] Pentecostal baby Supernatural things
[50:14] because you won't even obey the word at
[50:16] its most basic form how in the world are
[50:18] you going to go into what he really
[50:19] wants to do in this age he says I can't
[50:21] do it you've got to do the basics before
[50:22] you can come into these things amen but
[50:24] Abraham was under a Grace Covenant and
[50:27] we are as well and the Grace Covenant is
[50:28] that we won't stop the work of God God's
[50:31] going to bring it to pass no matter what
[50:32] we've done Abraham messed it up Abraham
[50:35] messed up the plan of God and that he
[50:36] brought forth Ishmael and that made a
[50:38] mess in the world but it didn't mess up
[50:40] God's plan it just brought conflict
[50:41] where there didn't have to be conflict
[50:43] and that's what we'll find is as we put
[50:45] ourselves into these things we bring
[50:46] conflict but it does doesn't stop God
[50:48] because God said I'm going to do it and
[50:50] God's going to do it regardless church
[50:52] that's our that's our faith is that he's
[50:54] going to do it because he said he was
[50:55] going to do it that's a Grace Covenant
[50:57] is When God says I'm going to do it and
[50:59] you don't have a part in it as in you
[51:01] aren't it's not because of what you do
[51:03] but often it's in spite of what we do in
[51:05] these things amen but there's going to
[51:07] be a bride and she's going to be
[51:08] spotless and she's going to be without
[51:09] wrinkle and she's going to be white and
[51:11] she's going to be pure and she's going
[51:13] to be righteous because he said she was
[51:15] going to be there and that's what we're
[51:16] resting on that's the grace of God Amen
[51:18] but we've been speaking on the adoption
[51:20] of the the children of God and we see
[51:22] that God was seeking to put his name in
[51:24] a people
[51:25] and he he put portions of it and we'll
[51:27] talk about it a bit later this morning
[51:28] he put portions all through the age but
[51:30] God was seeking to move from this idea
[51:32] and brother bam talks about this in
[51:34] a crisis the mystery of God revealed he
[51:36] said God was looking to go from God the
[51:38] Father above us
[51:39] which he was with Israel to Christ God
[51:42] With Us in Jesus Christ and now to God
[51:44] in us in the Holy Spirit and what he was
[51:46] doing was he was revealing the name
[51:47] which is the word which is the nature of
[51:49] God all through different manifestations
[51:51] and the final places that he's trying to
[51:53] place his name in a bride today so that
[51:56] she will be Mrs Jesus Christ that's the
[51:59] that's the final word that's the final
[52:01] sign to the final age is that we are him
[52:03] and he is us and that's what he's trying
[52:05] to do he's trying to put his name inside
[52:06] of us amen and God put his name in flesh
[52:09] when Jesus Christ was here and that was
[52:10] a great Revelation the revelation of the
[52:13] name of God was a great thing and
[52:15] history shows and brother Branham talks
[52:16] about this that that Revelation got lost
[52:19] and they started to move into what the
[52:21] titles and they started doing things in
[52:23] the name of the Father the Son and the
[52:25] Holy Spirit and that was a Catholic
[52:26] Doctrine and guess what everything
[52:28] that's come from them has followed in
[52:29] that almost exclusively they've done it
[52:31] in the titles rather than in the name
[52:33] and then brother Branham would talk
[52:34] about this and and he'd bring it back to
[52:36] to the the church ages and he'd talk
[52:38] about it in in the Book of Revelation
[52:40] that there was an Open Door in the
[52:42] Philadelphia Church age and he said that
[52:43] open door was the name of Jesus Christ
[52:45] because Jesus said I am the way the
[52:47] truth and life he said I am the door of
[52:49] the Sheepfold he says I am the door and
[52:50] they had lost that name and it had to be
[52:52] restored before we could ever come to
[52:54] this place because they'd lost the
[52:56] revelation of the name of God
[52:59] but God was trying to pull out a a place
[53:01] for people and we see that Jesus told
[53:04] the disciples to baptize in the name of
[53:06] the father Son and Holy Spirit and
[53:07] that's where they got off is because
[53:09] Jesus said it and then Peter comes with
[53:11] the keys to the kingdom and he brings us
[53:13] Acts 2 38 and it says and Peter said
[53:15] unto them repent and be baptized every
[53:17] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:19] for the remission of sins and you shall
[53:21] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[53:24] Jesus had said baptized in the name of
[53:26] the father Son and Holy Spirit and now
[53:28] Peter comes and with the keys to the
[53:30] kingdom Peter gives us the revelation of
[53:32] what Jesus meant because God's word
[53:35] cannot contradict itself Peter with the
[53:37] keys to the kingdom that are effective
[53:39] right they are effective he brought
[53:41] three thousand souls to the kingdom that
[53:42] day Peter says do it in the name of
[53:44] Jesus Christ and then they say no we've
[53:47] got to do it in the name of the father
[53:48] Son and Holy Spirit they miss the
[53:50] Revelation there's a revealing of the
[53:52] name and it was through Peter's Ministry
[53:54] that it was coming now amen it worked in
[53:56] Jerusalem and it worked in Corinth and
[53:59] it worked in thessalonica and it worked
[54:00] all over the globe that was how they
[54:02] went was in the name of Jesus Christ not
[54:05] in the titles of Father Son and Holy
[54:07] Spirit what is the name of the father
[54:09] what is the name of the son what is the
[54:11] name of the Holy Spirit the name is
[54:12] Jesus Christ and we covered that last
[54:15] service where Jesus said I come in my
[54:17] father's name brother Brian would say
[54:19] this and now we find that Jesus said
[54:21] also I came in my father's name and you
[54:23] received me not then the name of the
[54:25] father must be Jesus that's right and
[54:28] Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets
[54:29] called him Jesus and he was absolutely
[54:31] Jesus before his birth he even the holy
[54:34] prophet called his name Emmanuel which
[54:37] is god with us then God was manifested
[54:40] In the Flesh in order to take away the
[54:42] sin of the world and in doing so he was
[54:44] given the name of Jesus so he said so
[54:46] Jesus is the name and the name was
[54:49] placed in a man not a church not a
[54:51] denomination not a Creed but in a man he
[54:55] chose to place his name in Jesus Christ
[54:57] he says now we find out then that he
[55:00] becomes the place of God's worship where
[55:03] you worship Him
[55:05] he says ever before he was born his name
[55:08] was called Jesus it was so important it
[55:11] would give in to his mother by the angel
[55:13] Gabriel that his name will be called
[55:15] Jesus Son of God what he was there we
[55:18] have it then this is it alone it is for
[55:20] him alone God's chosen place of worship
[55:23] God's place he chose God chose to meet
[55:26] man not in a church not in a
[55:28] denomination not in a Creed but in
[55:30] Christ
[55:31] that's the only place that God will meet
[55:34] a man and he can worship God is in
[55:37] Christ that's the only place he said no
[55:40] matter if you're a Methodist Baptist
[55:42] Catholic Protestant let me add it
[55:44] message whatever you might be there is
[55:47] only one place you can correctly worship
[55:50] God and that's in Christ remember the
[55:53] scripture says by one Spirit we are
[55:55] baptized into one body
[55:57] that's the only way you can get in is
[56:00] through the new birth
[56:01] brother Brandon would say denomination
[56:03] will crumble and fall Nations will pass
[56:06] away but he will remain forever no other
[56:09] place that a man can find to worship God
[56:12] that God will speak back to him no place
[56:15] but in Christ Jesus notice that no other
[56:18] place God will speak back to him
[56:21] you've got to be in Christ you've got to
[56:23] be identified with Christ amen that's
[56:25] the only place the only place that God
[56:28] chose to put his name and the only place
[56:30] he meets man to worship he says your
[56:33] loss to believe anything else that's how
[56:35] serious this church is that you are
[56:37] under the banner of the name of Jesus
[56:39] Christ remember the scripture says where
[56:41] two or three are gathered where
[56:44] in church
[56:46] under the message of the hour
[56:50] I'm speaking of the words
[56:52] he says no where two or three are
[56:53] gathered in my name there will I be in
[56:57] the midst
[56:58] now he is identified by his word so
[57:01] you've got to have the right word you've
[57:03] got to be sitting under the message of
[57:04] the hour because that is Christ for
[57:05] today is the message but that's the
[57:07] written that's a spoken form but he's
[57:09] also in a living form and that's in the
[57:11] people that are gathered here but if you
[57:13] come to a church under the name of
[57:14] Pentecostal or Baptist or Catholic he's
[57:18] not even in your midst because you're
[57:19] gathered under a different name and the
[57:21] prophet would say those are the
[57:23] Blasphemous names that are identified in
[57:25] the Book of Revelation why you're
[57:28] gathered under a denomination rather
[57:30] than under Christ and you're identified
[57:32] with that because that is your absolute
[57:34] and you can't move away from it
[57:36] we think that we think that this is
[57:38] obvious that we have to be gathered in
[57:41] the name of Jesus Christ but church we
[57:42] have people today that are gathered in
[57:44] the name of William Branham
[57:45] they are they're gathered in the name of
[57:47] William Branham that's the only thing
[57:49] they'll ever listen to we've got people
[57:50] that are gathered around their local
[57:52] pastor and he's the only one they will
[57:54] listen to we've got people that are
[57:55] gathered around some Minister that
[57:57] they're streaming online and he's the
[57:59] only one they will listen to and what is
[58:01] it Christ is not there because they have
[58:03] put that man above Christ the word
[58:06] you can't put the microphone in the
[58:09] place of Christ himself and that's what
[58:10] they've done with our Prophet is they've
[58:12] made the microphone Christ himself that
[58:14] was not it he said I am a son of man
[58:16] revealing the son of man
[58:18] I'm just here when he's doing it is the
[58:21] way he would put it amen there's only
[58:23] one man brings a message to every age
[58:25] and that is William Branham for our age
[58:27] there is one voice and that is the holy
[58:29] spirit speaking to us and I understand
[58:31] that but when he left it dropped down
[58:33] into a five-fold Ministry that means you
[58:36] ought to have five people you can listen
[58:38] to if uh if nothing else five people you
[58:40] ought to be listened to because the
[58:42] spirit of God did not die with William
[58:43] Branham but it dropped down onto a
[58:45] five-fold Ministry amen if we can only
[58:47] listen to one man to one Ministry we are
[58:50] in a denomination and Christ is not
[58:53] there
[58:54] that's it that's it and yet you have
[58:56] churches that are gathered all over the
[58:58] place and they say that it is only my
[59:00] pastor it is only this it's only that
[59:01] you're in a denomination brother you're
[59:03] in a denomination sister if you say it's
[59:04] only in one church one place because
[59:06] it's a global body it's a global bride
[59:08] amen
[59:09] amen we're talking about this idea of
[59:11] placing of the name and we've got to
[59:13] remember we've got to take the right
[59:14] name we've got to be identified with
[59:16] Christ and Christ Alone amen and I feel
[59:19] sometimes this message has taken the
[59:21] place of Christ because people have
[59:23] taken the letters and the words
[59:24] themselves and put them ahead of a
[59:26] personal relationship with Christ and
[59:28] they don't get the Holy Spirit but they
[59:30] nod their head to the doctrines that
[59:31] have been revealed in the word that's
[59:32] been revealed to us and what is it
[59:34] they've missed the person
[59:36] they miss the person like Pentecost
[59:38] stayed with the gifts and they didn't
[59:40] get the giver
[59:41] what's happened is we've got we've got
[59:43] the word open and we take that word open
[59:44] and we take the the letter of it but we
[59:46] don't get the life of it we've got to be
[59:48] so careful it's a religious spirit
[59:50] that's walking around in this age trying
[59:51] to deceive us amen we've got to have
[59:54] that personal relationship with Christ
[59:55] amen we're not identified by William
[59:57] Branham but we believe he is the prophet
[1:00:00] to this age
[1:00:01] amen I'm not ashamed of that I'm not
[1:00:04] ashamed of that we've got it on our
[1:00:05] website we believe that he was the
[1:00:07] prophet to this age and we believe that
[1:00:09] is the one voice that brought us the
[1:00:10] message that we have to grasp today
[1:00:14] so we do listen to One voice but guess
[1:00:16] what I listen to lots of ministers
[1:00:18] because the same anointing that was on
[1:00:20] him has dropped down into a five-fold
[1:00:22] Ministry amen and it's tied to our
[1:00:24] adoption Ephesians 4 ties it literally
[1:00:26] to our adoption is the active work of
[1:00:28] the holy spirit in a five-fold Ministry
[1:00:30] it's to take us into Perfection it's to
[1:00:33] take us into Unity it's to take us into
[1:00:35] a Rapture amen
[1:00:37] amen we've gotta I believe we ought to
[1:00:38] listen to the messages I believe we
[1:00:40] ought to read the messages but if that
[1:00:41] is the only thing we do we have become a
[1:00:44] denomination amen we've become a
[1:00:46] denomination amen because the the Holy
[1:00:48] Spirit didn't die when William Branham
[1:00:50] left this Earth
[1:00:52] he's working in men and he's working in
[1:00:54] men today he's got to be working because
[1:00:56] that's the way he's always done it is he
[1:00:58] continued amen when Paul died the work
[1:00:59] didn't stop when Peter died the work
[1:01:01] didn't stop it went into other men and
[1:01:03] went into other ministers and went into
[1:01:04] men and women amen and the same things
[1:01:07] followed them because it was the same
[1:01:09] Spirit working inside of them
[1:01:10] amen we look at this name in this name
[1:01:13] Jesus Christ and what does that mean
[1:01:15] what is the the meaning of the word
[1:01:16] Jesus Christ or the phrase Jesus means
[1:01:19] Redeemer
[1:01:20] and Christ means the anointed one so
[1:01:23] this is the anointed redeemer is
[1:01:25] literally what the revelation of the
[1:01:27] name of God is it is an anointed
[1:01:29] Redeemer so the Holy Spirit anointing is
[1:01:32] what kind of an anointing a redeeming
[1:01:34] anointing it's a redeeming work Christ
[1:01:37] came down as Redeemer and his anointing
[1:01:39] follows down into each and every one of
[1:01:41] us and that redeeming work has been
[1:01:43] going on since he died on the cross 2000
[1:01:45] years ago and it hasn't stopped and it's
[1:01:47] been Christ in every word and at every
[1:01:49] age trying to redeem the people back to
[1:01:52] himself amen
[1:01:53] listen I can't redeem you I've said this
[1:01:56] before there are preachers preaching
[1:01:58] that a man redeems his family I can't
[1:02:00] redeem my family because I needed
[1:02:02] Redemption myself
[1:02:03] but I have a redeeming anointing on me
[1:02:05] and you have a redeeming anointing on
[1:02:07] you and what happens is when that Holy
[1:02:09] Spirit drops on me then what I become a
[1:02:11] vessel for him to use and what do I do I
[1:02:14] point you to where the word I point you
[1:02:16] to Christ and I point you to Acts 2 38
[1:02:18] which I read earlier and I say if you'll
[1:02:20] repent
[1:02:21] and you'll be baptized in the name of
[1:02:23] Jesus Christ then you'll receive the
[1:02:25] same redeeming anointing on you and
[1:02:27] you'll go out and you'll seek to point
[1:02:28] people to Christ as well what I'm not
[1:02:30] Gathering men to me I'm not Gathering
[1:02:32] women to me I'm gathering them to Christ
[1:02:34] who I'm pointing to because the
[1:02:36] anointing on me is to point them to the
[1:02:37] one that can redeem them in the first
[1:02:39] place amen but remember the spirit and
[1:02:42] the bride say come
[1:02:43] it's a call it's a poll amen and I see
[1:02:46] too often even around this message I'm
[1:02:48] I'm seeing churches that are putting
[1:02:50] people out because they don't have what
[1:02:51] they have or they don't have this
[1:02:53] minister they don't have that Minister
[1:02:54] and I say that's got to be an antichrist
[1:02:56] spirit because if you've got the spirit
[1:02:58] of God it's redeeming people and it's
[1:03:00] drawing them up if you're above where
[1:03:02] I'm at then you've got to be letting
[1:03:03] your hand down to help pull me up that's
[1:03:05] what a redeemer does is it takes you
[1:03:07] from where you are to where you need to
[1:03:09] be so if you've got what I don't have
[1:03:11] then stick with me and work with me amen
[1:03:13] pull me up to where you're at and we'll
[1:03:15] get across the Finish Line together but
[1:03:17] when they say well you're not here and
[1:03:18] you don't do this and you don't do that
[1:03:20] what is it's a denominational spirit and
[1:03:22] they're drawing a circle of US foreign
[1:03:24] or more and it's not a redeeming spirit
[1:03:26] it's a redeeming Spirit until the bride
[1:03:28] leaves because there's a mercy seat
[1:03:30] that's there and there's a blood that's
[1:03:31] on The Mercy Seat that's calling us amen
[1:03:35] but I don't want you tied to me because
[1:03:37] I'm going to fail and I have failed and
[1:03:39] I will fail but if I can tie you to
[1:03:41] Christ then when the hard times come
[1:03:42] you'll do okay because you're tied to
[1:03:44] the one that never changes and will not
[1:03:46] move away amen
[1:03:47] he's redeeming you back to you the
[1:03:49] prophet of God would say this God never
[1:03:51] takes his Spirit he just takes his men
[1:03:54] Elijah was taken but a double portion
[1:03:57] come upon Elisha then come out on John
[1:03:59] the Baptist and predicted to come again
[1:04:01] the last days see God doesn't take his
[1:04:03] Spirit he just takes his men and the
[1:04:06] spirit's on another man he said Jesus is
[1:04:08] here with the spirit of God on him and
[1:04:10] is come upon every one of you that's
[1:04:13] been born of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:15] every one of you men and women alike
[1:04:17] have an anointing a redeeming anointing
[1:04:20] on you
[1:04:21] he said Elijah was taken up and Elijah
[1:04:24] throw down what the same cover that he
[1:04:27] had to cover Elisha with a double
[1:04:28] portion of his Spirit he said it was the
[1:04:30] same thing just the double portion same
[1:04:33] power he said no more no more nor
[1:04:36] greater just a double portion of it like
[1:04:38] Moses when he was tired his
[1:04:39] father-in-law said to him you're wearing
[1:04:41] yourself out pray that God would take
[1:04:43] your spirit and put it on others and he
[1:04:47] prayed and he took the spirit and put it
[1:04:49] on 70 others and the 70 begin to
[1:04:51] prophesy he says they didn't have any
[1:04:54] more power they had more machinery
[1:04:58] Same Spirit just more people with it
[1:05:02] that's all and he says that's the way it
[1:05:04] is today one man can't do it
[1:05:08] one man can't do it so if you're saying
[1:05:10] it's only with one man then you're
[1:05:11] contradicting the prophet
[1:05:12] he says one man can't do it God has got
[1:05:15] his Machinery working everywhere but
[1:05:19] it's the same power the same power the
[1:05:22] same Holy Spirit the same Jesus amen
[1:05:25] have you got the nature of Christ you're
[1:05:27] going to be victorious you're going to
[1:05:28] be an overcomer but you're going to be
[1:05:30] humble because you know that you don't
[1:05:32] have it all and there's others just like
[1:05:34] you spread all around this world
[1:05:36] wherever you go God has his bride God
[1:05:38] has a group of Believers that are
[1:05:40] overcoming but it's a humble it's a
[1:05:42] simple church amen they're not braggers
[1:05:44] they're not running around talking about
[1:05:46] how great they are but what are they
[1:05:48] they are simply overcoming the age and
[1:05:50] as the barriers come up and as the doors
[1:05:53] are closed they just walk through them
[1:05:54] because the spirit of God is with them
[1:05:56] and every knee has to Bow and every door
[1:05:58] has to open before that name of Jesus
[1:06:00] Christ when you're in his will and when
[1:06:02] you're in his word amen
[1:06:04] what is it that's a people that's
[1:06:06] meditating on God
[1:06:08] they're dwelling on the word they're
[1:06:09] feeding on the word and Christ is
[1:06:12] identified in their midst it's going to
[1:06:14] be such a simple thing Church such a
[1:06:16] simple thing it's always been simple it
[1:06:19] will always be simple amen and we'll be
[1:06:21] looking for some great thing and you
[1:06:23] won't even realize I'm not not saying we
[1:06:25] won't but the world won't and most
[1:06:27] people won't even realize what's
[1:06:28] happening under their nose amen
[1:06:33] amen let's talk about this placing of
[1:06:35] the sun we're going to go to acts 15 of
[1:06:37] the placing of the name and it says
[1:06:38] Simeon had declared how God at the first
[1:06:41] did visit the Gentiles to take out of
[1:06:44] them a people for his name the Amplified
[1:06:46] says Simon Peter has rehearsed how God
[1:06:49] first visited the Gentiles to take out
[1:06:52] of them a people to bear and honor his
[1:06:56] name amen remember we're a part of a
[1:06:58] church and we tend to think the church
[1:06:59] is this building or this people but that
[1:07:02] is not the church
[1:07:03] every Church brother Branham said has
[1:07:06] three kinds of Believers in it so we
[1:07:07] can't just say because you're here
[1:07:09] you're a part of the church
[1:07:11] you're part of a church where you may
[1:07:13] not be part of the church amen the
[1:07:15] church means the called out ones so
[1:07:17] before you can ever be gathered into a
[1:07:19] body you have to be taken out of one you
[1:07:22] can't be a member of the True Church of
[1:07:24] God unless you've come out of something
[1:07:25] amen you've got to leave something amen
[1:07:27] they've been called out they've been
[1:07:29] separated from this world and then
[1:07:31] they've been gathered into Christ amen
[1:07:33] they're gathered where under Christ the
[1:07:35] word for their day
[1:07:37] by the holy spirit because the holy
[1:07:39] spirit will lead you into all truth you
[1:07:40] get the holy spirit it's going to take
[1:07:41] you where the word for your day is
[1:07:43] there are people that got the Holy
[1:07:45] Spirit under Pentecost
[1:07:47] there are people that got the Holy
[1:07:48] Spirit under the Baptist Doctrine
[1:07:50] because what they were sincere and they
[1:07:51] obeyed the word but they never stayed
[1:07:53] there God took them out of it because
[1:07:55] that's not where his truth was
[1:07:57] you can get the Holy Spirit outside of
[1:07:58] this message but it'll take you into
[1:08:00] this message
[1:08:01] it has to
[1:08:03] it has to it'll lead you into all truth
[1:08:04] we think that because we're in it we've
[1:08:06] got it no it'll take you into it and
[1:08:08] you'll see people and they don't know
[1:08:10] what they're looking for brother random
[1:08:11] catch this you don't believe me brother
[1:08:13] Branham said this man he was searching
[1:08:15] and searching he went for a year after
[1:08:17] year after year after year and what he
[1:08:19] started him searching was that he read
[1:08:22] this little tract
[1:08:23] and then he said I went and I searched
[1:08:25] and I went to the Baptist and they
[1:08:27] didn't have it and I went to the
[1:08:28] Pentecost and I didn't have and I went
[1:08:29] to the lutherans and the methodists and
[1:08:30] all these different ones they didn't
[1:08:31] have it and he said brother Bannerman
[1:08:33] says I've come here and he says now I
[1:08:35] see the truth he says but I don't know
[1:08:37] if I've got the Holy Ghost and brother
[1:08:39] Branham says you got the Holy Ghost as
[1:08:42] soon as you started looking for the
[1:08:45] truth
[1:08:47] he was nowhere church and he went
[1:08:49] through denomination after denomination
[1:08:51] after denomination and what he already
[1:08:54] had the Holy Ghost and it was leading
[1:08:56] him into all truth I don't care where
[1:08:58] you were when you get it but you're
[1:09:00] going to get into truth amen but you can
[1:09:01] get it anywhere you can get it in your
[1:09:03] room on the back side you can go on the
[1:09:05] back side of a desert you can be in a
[1:09:07] drunk in a bar you can be anywhere
[1:09:09] church and he can drop down and he can
[1:09:11] meet you and he can fill you with his
[1:09:13] holy spirit but he'll take you to his
[1:09:15] word he won't leave you destitute he
[1:09:17] won't leave you unfed he'll take you to
[1:09:19] his word but God can save you in the
[1:09:21] middle of nowhere
[1:09:23] how many times have we talked to people
[1:09:25] and you talked to ones and they just
[1:09:27] come in out of nowhere and they say what
[1:09:29] happened they said I don't know what
[1:09:31] happened
[1:09:32] but I'm here
[1:09:34] they don't even know what happened it's
[1:09:36] so Supernatural it's so Sovereign God
[1:09:38] drops down into their life and boom it's
[1:09:41] a finished work and they're sealed to
[1:09:43] the day of their Redemption and God
[1:09:44] brings them to where his truth is to
[1:09:46] where his word is because that's where
[1:09:47] he's identified as where his word is
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:53] listen to this
[1:09:57] what is it
[1:09:58] we look at the Lutheran Church my
[1:10:00] grandmother's a Lutheran and the
[1:10:02] lutherans had the truth
[1:10:04] for their day
[1:10:06] remember brother Brandon we read the
[1:10:07] quote last week he said Moses had the
[1:10:09] truth for his day and he was the
[1:10:10] revelation of the word of God but it
[1:10:11] won't work today and Moses had it but it
[1:10:13] won't work today and John the Baptist
[1:10:15] had it and it won't work today and
[1:10:16] Joseph had it and it won't work for
[1:10:18] today the lutherans had it but they
[1:10:20] didn't keep going with it
[1:10:22] it worked for their day but it was all
[1:10:24] of it and they didn't keep walking so
[1:10:26] they lost it and then he went into the
[1:10:27] Methodist and it was sanctification with
[1:10:29] John Wesley and they had it for their
[1:10:31] day but they stopped there and they
[1:10:33] didn't keep moving and then the
[1:10:34] Pentecostals had it and it was the
[1:10:35] restoration of the gifts but they didn't
[1:10:37] stop or they didn't continue on and so
[1:10:39] they stayed there in the denominated and
[1:10:41] they didn't keep walking they didn't
[1:10:42] keep moving in the revelation of the
[1:10:44] word and the name of God
[1:10:46] but God kept walking was the problem
[1:10:49] remember we read this we know the
[1:10:51] scripture by by heart I'm sure it says
[1:10:53] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:10:56] the light
[1:10:57] you can walk in light but if he's not
[1:10:59] there then you're no good you've got to
[1:11:01] walk where he is in the light we have
[1:11:03] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:11:05] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:11:07] us from all sin I want to catch two
[1:11:09] thoughts out of this the first thing is
[1:11:11] we have to walk with Christ the word
[1:11:13] for today for today I can't walk and
[1:11:17] know his message
[1:11:18] I can't walk in those message I've got
[1:11:20] to walk in the word for my day and
[1:11:22] that's why I believe in a prophet
[1:11:23] messenger for this age there is a word
[1:11:26] that's anointed for this age to take us
[1:11:28] out of this world Amen but we have to
[1:11:30] walk with him we don't walk with a man
[1:11:32] we don't walk with a church you don't
[1:11:34] walk with your pastor you walk with
[1:11:35] Christ the word amen and we have to move
[1:11:38] with him
[1:11:39] if we lag behind we end up a dollar
[1:11:42] short and a day late
[1:11:44] you don't want to miss the Rapture by a
[1:11:45] day Church
[1:11:46] you want to be right with them and what
[1:11:48] happens if we walk ahead we're premature
[1:11:51] and what is it we're presumptuous
[1:11:54] and brother Bram said to be presumptuous
[1:11:55] to presume is to venture without
[1:11:57] Authority you get ahead of God doesn't
[1:11:59] mean it wasn't in his plan but you
[1:12:01] jumped ahead you try to make it happen
[1:12:03] yourself and God can't honor it because
[1:12:05] you've gotten ahead of him if you get
[1:12:07] outside outside of his light you're in
[1:12:09] what darkness and you're going to fall
[1:12:11] you're going to fail you're going to
[1:12:12] mess up amen
[1:12:13] but the second thing is that we have
[1:12:15] Fellowship within the body of Christ
[1:12:18] when we're walking with Christ
[1:12:20] Fellowship one with another
[1:12:23] one with another now some people would
[1:12:25] look at that and say I'm walking with
[1:12:27] Christ and that's enough no you're going
[1:12:29] to have fellowship with Believers as
[1:12:31] well
[1:12:31] because this is a body that's moving
[1:12:33] with you amen we're all part of it we're
[1:12:35] all part of the called out ones and that
[1:12:37] means we've got a local body for every
[1:12:39] believer
[1:12:40] and I know there's people listening to
[1:12:42] this tape to this message today if
[1:12:44] you're not where there is a church get
[1:12:46] to where there's a church because you're
[1:12:48] meant to be if you're walking with
[1:12:49] Christ the word that means there's a
[1:12:51] local body for you somewhere get to it
[1:12:54] be a part of it amen
[1:12:56] I know that sometimes that's hard
[1:12:58] because people will give us every excuse
[1:12:59] in the book as to why they're not a part
[1:13:01] of a body there is no excuse if you're
[1:13:03] walking with the word you're walking
[1:13:04] with Christ that means there's a local
[1:13:05] body that needs you somewhere you've got
[1:13:07] to fit in somewhere amen
[1:13:10] some of us would maybe somebody would
[1:13:11] say well he's saying that's fellowship
[1:13:13] with Christ but that we that has
[1:13:15] Fellowship turns into those that are
[1:13:16] cleansed by us it says us the blood of
[1:13:19] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin us
[1:13:22] that are fellowshipping together we get
[1:13:23] cleansed by the blood Christ doesn't
[1:13:25] need cleansing by the blood we need it
[1:13:26] the we turns into us we're
[1:13:28] fellowshipping one to another amen I've
[1:13:30] said it before brother Paul hey let's
[1:13:31] quote he said a sheep that is by itself
[1:13:34] is only called one thing in the
[1:13:35] scripture and that is lost
[1:13:37] lost and you'll find that what defines
[1:13:40] it is when it is back with other sheep
[1:13:41] it's found when it is back with the rest
[1:13:43] of the sheep under the care of the
[1:13:45] shepherd amen we can tie this to Christ
[1:13:48] walking in the midst of the golden
[1:13:49] candlesticks in Revelation 1 and it was
[1:13:51] Christ the revealed word that was
[1:13:53] walking in the light of the Revelation
[1:13:55] for each age amen and we're talking as
[1:13:57] we look at this this placing of a name
[1:13:59] we're looking at the name of Christ but
[1:14:01] we also see that there are different
[1:14:02] names that are out there and this is the
[1:14:04] name that we're looking at when we look
[1:14:06] at these Blasphemous names when we look
[1:14:08] at denominations in these things and we
[1:14:10] read in the Book of Revelation about the
[1:14:11] great the mystery Babylon and we
[1:14:13] know that's the Catholic church amen
[1:14:15] she's Seated on Seven Hills which is
[1:14:17] Rome itself but in Revelation 17
[1:14:19] speaking of this woman it says and the
[1:14:21] woman was a raid in purple and scarlet
[1:14:24] color you notice she's dressed in a way
[1:14:26] to please herself
[1:14:28] the bride is dressed in white
[1:14:30] pure she's dressed in purple
[1:14:33] but it's of our own making it's of our
[1:14:35] own uh preference amen she's decked with
[1:14:37] gold and precious stones and Pearls
[1:14:39] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:14:42] Abominations and filthiness of her
[1:14:43] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[1:14:47] name written mystery Babylon the great
[1:14:49] the mother of harlots and the
[1:14:52] Abominations of the earth now we can
[1:14:54] look at that scripture and say well
[1:14:55] we're not Catholics we're okay maybe we
[1:14:57] have Protestants that would say well I'm
[1:14:59] a Protestant I'm not a Catholic so I'm
[1:15:00] okay but notice it says she is the
[1:15:03] mother of harlots she had children
[1:15:06] she had children notice and if you know
[1:15:09] what a harlot is you know that when she
[1:15:10] has children it's by many men
[1:15:12] it's not by one man it's by many men and
[1:15:15] chances are she can't tell you who their
[1:15:16] daddy is
[1:15:18] but it's a bunch of different children
[1:15:19] by men
[1:15:21] amen not by the word it's by men and
[1:15:23] what was it it's the Protestant system
[1:15:25] that came out from her is the what the
[1:15:28] daughters of the Harlot and they're just
[1:15:31] like their mommy
[1:15:32] they're just like their daddy
[1:15:34] and what is it they can't come under the
[1:15:37] authority of the Holy Spirit they're
[1:15:39] just as corrupt as their mama was and
[1:15:42] what is it they've taken on the the
[1:15:44] authority of men because they've taken
[1:15:45] on the same influence they've got the
[1:15:47] same DNA and so they refuse one man's
[1:15:49] Authority and they took another man's
[1:15:51] Authority
[1:15:52] and so it was it's doomed from the very
[1:15:54] beginning amen but there's a voice that
[1:15:56] comes out of heaven in Revelation 18 and
[1:15:58] it warns the people to get out why
[1:16:00] because God's calling out a church out
[1:16:01] of all of that mess church out of all of
[1:16:04] that mess
[1:16:05] out of all of that prostitute system out
[1:16:07] of all of that filth God's calling a
[1:16:10] church and that's a Grace Covenant
[1:16:12] Abraham worshiped all sorts of gods
[1:16:14] before God called him out
[1:16:16] he was an idol worshiper packing idols
[1:16:19] and then God called him out of that amen
[1:16:21] that's why we don't look it down at the
[1:16:23] people that's why brother Brown would
[1:16:24] say I condemn I hate the system not the
[1:16:26] people in them because God's got
[1:16:27] children in there still
[1:16:29] that's why we still do Outreach that's
[1:16:30] why we still witness that's why we still
[1:16:32] testifies because we don't know which
[1:16:34] ones are which and it's God that's going
[1:16:36] to pull them out but in Revelation 18 4
[1:16:38] it says and I heard another voice from
[1:16:40] Heaven saying come out of her my people
[1:16:42] that ye be not partakers of our sins and
[1:16:45] that you've received not of our plagues
[1:16:47] what's he saying if you do what she's
[1:16:48] doing you'll get what's coming to her
[1:16:51] but now God rich and mercy steps in and
[1:16:53] he gives a fair warning says get out of
[1:16:55] her get out of the system get out from
[1:16:57] under men's Authority get out to where
[1:16:59] my voice is speaking get out and hear
[1:17:01] what the holy spirit is seeking seeing
[1:17:03] brother Brown would say this he says now
[1:17:05] watch this doctrine of Balaam most
[1:17:07] carefully notice above all that it is a
[1:17:10] deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy
[1:17:13] to bind the people to them by Leading
[1:17:16] the People deliberately into the sin of
[1:17:19] unbelief
[1:17:20] brother Brown said the greatest thing
[1:17:21] that they could disbelieve is Jesus
[1:17:22] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:17:24] forever that they put it back in the
[1:17:26] days of the Apostles and he says then
[1:17:28] he's right here today in exactly the
[1:17:30] same way that he was 2000 years ago
[1:17:32] except he's not in a Corporal body
[1:17:34] he's still here
[1:17:36] he says the Nickelodeon Doctrine was the
[1:17:38] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[1:17:40] political power amongst themselves while
[1:17:43] balaamism is the subjection of the
[1:17:46] people to their system of creed and
[1:17:48] worship in order to hold them now watch
[1:17:51] this carefully what was it that bound
[1:17:53] the people to the nominal church and
[1:17:55] thereby destroyed them it was the Creeds
[1:17:57] and dogmas formed into church tenets it
[1:18:00] was the doctrine of the Roman Catholic
[1:18:02] Church they were not given the True Food
[1:18:04] the word
[1:18:06] they were given the food that came from
[1:18:08] idol worship Babylonian paganism wrapped
[1:18:11] up in Christian terminology
[1:18:14] now you say I don't have that listen to
[1:18:15] your music Church what's put out there
[1:18:18] as music today and they're wrapping it
[1:18:19] all up in the same thing I spoke of this
[1:18:21] last service they're wrapping up their
[1:18:24] Natural Music their worldly music in a
[1:18:27] Christian rapper
[1:18:28] and they're saying taste and see
[1:18:31] and if you ever watch if you ever go on
[1:18:33] YouTube and you look at what they're
[1:18:34] doing they have turned them into rock
[1:18:35] and roll concerts
[1:18:37] that's what it is I said before I said
[1:18:38] last church I stand by this you can't
[1:18:40] finish in rock and roll if you didn't
[1:18:41] start in rock and roll so that song may
[1:18:43] sound great when it starts but if it
[1:18:45] finishes in rock and roll it started
[1:18:46] with a rock and roll anointing and it
[1:18:48] sucked you into it because it tasted
[1:18:50] good at the beginning
[1:18:51] you got to spit it out he says that very
[1:18:54] same Doctrine is Right amongst all
[1:18:56] Protestants
[1:18:58] and it is called denomination
[1:19:01] nickelatianism is organization
[1:19:04] humanizing the leadership of the church
[1:19:06] and thereby deposing the spirit and
[1:19:09] balaamism is denominationalism which
[1:19:11] takes the church manual instead of the
[1:19:13] Bible
[1:19:15] I was watching something and and it was
[1:19:17] they had a Catholic preach there and
[1:19:19] then they had a Protestant Minister
[1:19:20] there and they were talking about
[1:19:21] whether Jesus truly had brothers and
[1:19:23] sisters
[1:19:25] and the Catholic said no we don't
[1:19:27] believe that he have brothers and
[1:19:28] sisters because Mary was such a holy
[1:19:30] vessel that there's no way that God
[1:19:32] would allow her to ever be touched by a
[1:19:34] man so she had to be kept Sanctified and
[1:19:36] holy and therefore these had to be
[1:19:38] Jesus's cousins
[1:19:41] why because they had elevated Mary to a
[1:19:44] place of worship to where she had to be
[1:19:46] perfect
[1:19:46] Church Mary had to get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:48] same as everyone else did and that's the
[1:19:50] only time Mary became truly righteous
[1:19:52] was when she got the Holy Ghost amen she
[1:19:54] was the same as you and I blessed and
[1:19:56] highly favored of the Lord in her
[1:19:58] current condition in her Fallen
[1:20:00] condition amen and then the Protestant
[1:20:02] said I'll sorry
[1:20:04] but
[1:20:05] it says he had brothers and sisters he
[1:20:07] made it very clear they were his
[1:20:09] brothers and sisters so we don't worship
[1:20:10] Mary so we just believe the word The Way
[1:20:13] It Was Written he had Brothers you know
[1:20:15] but it just drew me because they they
[1:20:17] had elevated they had taken their Church
[1:20:18] Dogma worshiping Mary and said there's
[1:20:20] no way that she could be anything but a
[1:20:22] holy mother
[1:20:24] not even realizing that Mary had nothing
[1:20:26] to do with it there was nothing of Mary
[1:20:27] in Christ
[1:20:28] there was nothing to marry in Christ
[1:20:30] she just held she just carried him
[1:20:34] wasn't her blood it wasn't her it was a
[1:20:36] holy spirit seed that was inside of her
[1:20:39] there was nothing of her in it in the
[1:20:40] first place
[1:20:42] he says I'm right to this hour many of
[1:20:44] God's people are caught in the snare of
[1:20:46] denominationalism and God is crying to
[1:20:48] them come out of her my people that ye
[1:20:50] be not partakers of her sins and that
[1:20:52] you received not of her plagues you see
[1:20:54] they are ignorant but if the Rapture
[1:20:57] should take place at this moment
[1:20:58] ignorance would be no court of appeal
[1:21:00] from the Judgment of God for being in
[1:21:03] the wrong ranks
[1:21:05] he says Harvest Time yes it's harvest
[1:21:08] time the two vines that grew together
[1:21:10] and intertwined their branches are now
[1:21:12] to be separated the fruit of those Vines
[1:21:14] which were at such variance will be
[1:21:16] gathered into separate Garners the two
[1:21:19] spirits will go to into their separate
[1:21:22] destinations he says now it is time to
[1:21:25] heed the final call that only comes to
[1:21:27] the wheat bride to the mature bride the
[1:21:30] final stage he says come out of her my
[1:21:31] people that ye be not partakers of our
[1:21:34] sins and that you the wheat receive not
[1:21:37] her the tares plagues he says the Great
[1:21:40] Tribulation of The Sixth Seal and
[1:21:42] Matthew 24. amen Abraham is the father
[1:21:45] of our faith and he had to come out
[1:21:47] before he could ever go in and we're in
[1:21:49] the same Grace Covenant in our life
[1:21:50] mirrors his and then we had to come out
[1:21:52] of something before we can arrive
[1:21:54] somewhere else and I think and I've said
[1:21:56] it before the hardest thing for us to
[1:21:58] understand is being raised in the
[1:21:59] message home and still having to come
[1:22:00] out of something
[1:22:02] I still had to come out of something
[1:22:04] when I got saved church I believe this
[1:22:06] message as long as I can remember it
[1:22:08] since it may be the age of 10 when I was
[1:22:10] under conviction to give my heart to the
[1:22:12] Lord I believed the message I believe
[1:22:14] that it was the truth let me tell you my
[1:22:17] dad who isn't serving the lord 70 years
[1:22:19] old today still says I believe the
[1:22:21] message is the truth
[1:22:23] that didn't save me and that didn't make
[1:22:25] me a Believer me saying I believed it
[1:22:27] did not make me a believer
[1:22:30] that made my confession that I believed
[1:22:32] it to be truth but I couldn't live it
[1:22:34] and I didn't live it and I wasn't able
[1:22:36] to live it and until I gave my heart to
[1:22:38] the Lord until I was baptized in the
[1:22:39] name of Jesus Christ until I repented
[1:22:41] and until I got the Holy Ghost I wasn't
[1:22:43] a believer
[1:22:45] I was potentially a believer
[1:22:47] but the proof that I was a Believer was
[1:22:49] when he sealed me with the Holy Spirit
[1:22:51] because he accepted the fact that I had
[1:22:53] repented and I've been baptized the
[1:22:55] right way and then he sealed me with the
[1:22:57] Holy Spirit that's the proof that I'm a
[1:22:58] Believer not that I said amen to the
[1:23:00] word
[1:23:01] because the priesthood in Jesus name
[1:23:03] were all saying Amen to the word but
[1:23:04] when it came their way they missed it
[1:23:06] completely why because they were of a
[1:23:07] different father amen
[1:23:09] Being Born Again by the spirit is what
[1:23:11] proves that I'm a Believer not just what
[1:23:13] I say not just what church I attend not
[1:23:15] just what message I listened to amen
[1:23:18] I still had denominational eyes we've
[1:23:20] got one one man denominations one woman
[1:23:22] denominations all over this world today
[1:23:24] because I had to die to my nature I had
[1:23:27] to die to my thoughts I had to die to my
[1:23:29] preferences and I had to be born again
[1:23:31] as a new creature in Christ
[1:23:33] and that's what makes me a Believer is
[1:23:35] that I have his nature and I'm a new
[1:23:37] creation under the holy spirit amen
[1:23:39] because I needed something that could
[1:23:40] bring this body into subjection that's
[1:23:42] what I needed
[1:23:44] listen to this brother Brian says when
[1:23:46] he gave Abraham part of his name
[1:23:48] positionally he put his name on the
[1:23:50] check the same as his was what we'd say
[1:23:52] today is he added his name to the bank
[1:23:53] account you go into the bank you can
[1:23:56] have multiple signatures that are
[1:23:57] allowed or multiple people that are
[1:23:59] allowed to sign off on the bank account
[1:24:00] brother Brown says when God gave Abraham
[1:24:02] his new name he positionally added him
[1:24:04] to the bank account he says his is
[1:24:07] Elohim Abraham is Abraham see he gave
[1:24:10] him part of his name not the whole name
[1:24:12] a part of it he says there's a great
[1:24:14] Revelation there what is it it's all
[1:24:15] Grace God giving a portion to a sinful
[1:24:19] man
[1:24:21] it was Abraham receiving god-giving but
[1:24:23] it was just a part he says so he gave
[1:24:26] him his own name Abraham and then when
[1:24:28] he did that the next thing he did after
[1:24:30] he gave him that name placed that on his
[1:24:33] name then what did he do he gave him a
[1:24:35] sign that he was ready to absolutely
[1:24:38] destroy all sin that was around him and
[1:24:41] positionally put his body in condition
[1:24:43] to receive the promised son that he had
[1:24:46] waited on he said it's exactly what he's
[1:24:49] done to the church what a thought Church
[1:24:51] Abraham's walking along and he's been
[1:24:53] walking and walking and it's been 24
[1:24:55] years and he's getting old and he's
[1:24:58] getting tired and he's getting wrinkly
[1:25:00] and his maybe his hair is falling out
[1:25:02] and his beard is so gray and he's
[1:25:04] trudging and he's trudging and he's just
[1:25:08] he's worn out
[1:25:09] completely worn out and then God comes
[1:25:12] down says okay Abraham now I'm ready
[1:25:16] to take even the effects of sin out of
[1:25:18] your body
[1:25:19] I'm getting you ready for the word and
[1:25:21] Abraham's sitting here saying look at me
[1:25:24] sometimes we look at ourselves and we
[1:25:25] say look at me
[1:25:28] would you look at that
[1:25:31] and then God says yeah but that doesn't
[1:25:34] matter
[1:25:35] because this is a Grace work
[1:25:37] and I'm coming down to touch you
[1:25:38] regardless of where you're at
[1:25:40] because I promised that I was going to
[1:25:42] do it amen what was it it was taking
[1:25:44] away the effects of sin in his life He
[1:25:46] restored Abraham's body back to its
[1:25:48] youth
[1:25:49] what does Sin do it ages us
[1:25:51] it makes things stop working it makes us
[1:25:54] tired it makes us sore it makes our
[1:25:56] joints wear out it makes us slow
[1:25:58] all these things that we're starting to
[1:26:00] experience as we get into our 40s and
[1:26:01] 50s we're not the speed we used to be
[1:26:04] but he erased every aspect of that but
[1:26:06] look at Sarah
[1:26:08] because Father Abraham is our father of
[1:26:11] Faith but we look at Sarah Sarah is
[1:26:12] really the position of the Bride
[1:26:14] if you want to see that and Sarah he
[1:26:16] didn't restore her to her youth
[1:26:19] because in her youth she still couldn't
[1:26:21] have a child Church
[1:26:23] in her youth in this sinful condition
[1:26:26] she still couldn't produce a child she
[1:26:28] didn't have strength to receive seed the
[1:26:29] scripture says but Abraham or Sarah's
[1:26:32] body was restored back to what her place
[1:26:35] in the thoughts of God she was restored
[1:26:38] to her place in the word not restored to
[1:26:40] her youth Church we're not being
[1:26:42] restored to our youth Rivers being
[1:26:44] restored Back to Before Our Youth we're
[1:26:46] being restored back to where we were
[1:26:47] shouting before the presence of God
[1:26:49] before when we shouted and danced before
[1:26:51] God Amen that's what we're being
[1:26:52] restored back to we're being restored
[1:26:54] back to the word that she was before she
[1:26:57] ever existed that's what her body looked
[1:26:59] like she got a special body so that she
[1:27:01] could produce at that amen
[1:27:03] he's restoring us back to what we were
[1:27:06] in Christ before all this and he says
[1:27:07] what's he doing he says he's destroying
[1:27:10] all the sin that's around us
[1:27:12] what do we do when we go down in the
[1:27:14] water what do we do we're accepting the
[1:27:16] finished work of Calvary and the blood
[1:27:17] of Jesus cleanses us from all of our
[1:27:19] sins
[1:27:20] but now what's he doing he takes the
[1:27:22] holy spirit in Fire and it just burns
[1:27:24] everything out
[1:27:25] what does it do it sanctifies it
[1:27:28] you wash something that gets rid of some
[1:27:31] things
[1:27:32] but you put it through fire it takes
[1:27:34] everything out there's nothing left and
[1:27:36] it comes through and it not only Burns
[1:27:38] you out it not only sanctifies you but
[1:27:39] then it fills you and puts you into
[1:27:41] service so that you can produce the word
[1:27:43] amen it puts your body in a condition to
[1:27:45] produce and receive the word of God in
[1:27:47] this age amen
[1:27:49] he said that he gave Abraham a part of
[1:27:51] his name and why was that
[1:27:54] Abraham was just under grace in the Old
[1:27:56] Testament but it was under the Old
[1:27:57] Testament it was under the blood of
[1:27:59] bulls and goats and why was it because
[1:28:01] Abraham was only revealing a part of God
[1:28:05] and we'll get into this in a minute in
[1:28:07] the scriptures in Hebrews 11 but this
[1:28:09] was just one part of a whole family
[1:28:11] one part of a whole family Abraham was
[1:28:14] the father of many nations he was the
[1:28:15] father of a family that was going to
[1:28:17] come so God couldn't reveal everything
[1:28:19] in Abraham it was just a part it was
[1:28:21] just a start of what he was going to be
[1:28:22] doing by faith through the next thousand
[1:28:24] years as he started to reveal himself in
[1:28:27] Jesus Christ the fullness of God made
[1:28:28] flesh and then he was going to reveal
[1:28:30] his fullness in the full family the
[1:28:32] faithful family of Abraham
[1:28:34] brother Brian would say this he says now
[1:28:35] the church has come through those
[1:28:37] schools she married back Yonder a long
[1:28:39] time ago become a denomination an
[1:28:41] organization he says but you notice the
[1:28:43] birth produce something else the new
[1:28:45] birth produce something else and now
[1:28:47] it's got to a place where the
[1:28:48] Pentecostal Church
[1:28:50] he says with the new birth that's the
[1:28:53] Pentecostal experience not the
[1:28:55] Pentecostal denomination has been tested
[1:28:57] and tried and now it's coming to a place
[1:28:59] God doesn't deal with the church as just
[1:29:02] an organization he doesn't deal with the
[1:29:04] church as a group of people but rather
[1:29:06] he deals with the church as individuals
[1:29:09] each individual in the church he says
[1:29:13] and now it's got to a time he says and
[1:29:15] it's no secret we all see it when a man
[1:29:17] proves and God loves him he takes him
[1:29:20] out somewhere to himself and there in
[1:29:22] front of angels he does something for
[1:29:24] him he lifts him up there in the
[1:29:26] presence of God and Gifts him and fills
[1:29:29] him and sets him out he says that's the
[1:29:32] age we're living in the same holy spirit
[1:29:34] that saved the lutherans that Sanctified
[1:29:37] the methodists that baptize the
[1:29:39] Pentecostals is Now setting in order the
[1:29:41] coming of the Lord Jesus he says when
[1:29:43] it'll be so powerful that body will come
[1:29:46] into this group a church that'll draw
[1:29:49] the rest of them from the grave there
[1:29:51] will be a resurrection that's what the
[1:29:54] Holy Ghost was given for
[1:29:55] the Holy Ghost was given to produce a
[1:29:58] resurrection and a Rapture he says what
[1:30:01] is the Holy Ghost he says without us
[1:30:03] they cannot be made perfect he says they
[1:30:07] lived in one day under that he says we
[1:30:09] live in another day
[1:30:11] what was it
[1:30:13] God couldn't put his full name in
[1:30:14] Abraham because Abraham was an imperfect
[1:30:16] representation
[1:30:17] but he was a representation
[1:30:19] but when Christ came that was a perfect
[1:30:21] representation that was the sinless man
[1:30:23] that was the perfect one that was the
[1:30:25] Holy One and God could put his name in
[1:30:27] there because he was a perfect
[1:30:28] representation
[1:30:30] but in Hebrews 11 it's speaking of
[1:30:31] Abraham and all the others in that great
[1:30:33] faith chapter and it says and all of the
[1:30:36] and these all having obtained a good
[1:30:38] report through faith
[1:30:41] received not the promise singular
[1:30:46] they got the word for their day but they
[1:30:49] didn't receive the promise
[1:30:51] because there's one promise that was
[1:30:52] coming there was one promise that God
[1:30:54] was giving it says God having provided
[1:30:56] some better thing for us you're saying
[1:30:59] that what we have is better than what
[1:31:00] Abraham we have what Abraham looked for
[1:31:02] church we have what he was seeking
[1:31:04] amen having provided some better thing
[1:31:07] for us that they without us should not
[1:31:10] be made perfect what is it Christ the
[1:31:13] overcoming word the resurrection of this
[1:31:15] life the life of God inside of us was
[1:31:17] what Abraham was looking for
[1:31:19] that's what he was looking for scripture
[1:31:21] says he sought a city whose Builder a
[1:31:23] maker was God the only way you're going
[1:31:25] to get theirs by the Holy Spirit by the
[1:31:27] nature by the spirit of God inside of
[1:31:29] that Abraham needs us to be perfect
[1:31:31] these people in the faith chapter need
[1:31:33] us to be perfect and that word perfect
[1:31:35] at the end there it says that they
[1:31:37] should without us they should not be
[1:31:39] made perfect it means whole full
[1:31:41] complete consecrated finished
[1:31:45] Abraham was the start but he wasn't the
[1:31:48] Finish
[1:31:49] he was the the beginning of it he was a
[1:31:51] beginning but God had to finish it
[1:31:54] before he could say this is the whole
[1:31:56] thing Abraham was the father of the
[1:31:58] promise
[1:31:59] and we are the children of that promise
[1:32:01] through Christ amen Christ was the
[1:32:03] promise he was the one he was the answer
[1:32:06] but Abraham was an heir through
[1:32:08] righteousness and the promise of the day
[1:32:09] and he received it but he was looking
[1:32:11] for more he got a portion but he was
[1:32:14] looking for more
[1:32:15] and he died looking for that portion
[1:32:17] amen but we come to us today and we've
[1:32:19] got the full revelation of the name of
[1:32:21] God it's Jesus Christ and God has been
[1:32:23] seeking to put his name in flesh
[1:32:25] completely again he did it in the alpha
[1:32:28] church he did it in the days of the
[1:32:29] Apostles and then it fell down through
[1:32:31] the the Dark Ages and these different
[1:32:33] things again but he's looking to put it
[1:32:35] now in individuals that collectively
[1:32:37] will reveal Jesus Christ once again amen
[1:32:39] and he's doing it in a way catch this
[1:32:42] he's doing it in a way that I won't
[1:32:44] glory in it and you won't glory in it
[1:32:46] why because I'm just a part
[1:32:49] and you're just a part so what happens
[1:32:51] is I see Christ in you and I say Glory
[1:32:55] that's it
[1:32:57] but then you see Christ to me and you
[1:32:58] say Glory that's it and then you say I
[1:33:00] can't make it without you and I say I
[1:33:02] can't make it with you and so we say
[1:33:04] well let's stay together then why
[1:33:06] because you're the word and I'm the word
[1:33:07] but you're just a portion and I'm just a
[1:33:09] portion so we need all of those portions
[1:33:11] to make up the body of Christ
[1:33:13] and what is it you've got something
[1:33:15] maybe that I don't quite have
[1:33:17] not that I don't have it but I don't
[1:33:18] have it in the way you have it and
[1:33:19] you're the perfect revelation of it but
[1:33:21] I've got something else that you don't
[1:33:23] quite have either and so together the
[1:33:25] two of us the three of us the five of us
[1:33:26] the 50 of us the hundreds the thousands
[1:33:29] around this world together we paint this
[1:33:31] perfect mirror this perfect image of
[1:33:33] Christ
[1:33:33] but I'm not running ahead because I need
[1:33:35] you because you've got something that's
[1:33:36] revealing the word as well
[1:33:38] and you can't get too far away from me
[1:33:40] and I can't get too far away from you
[1:33:41] because it's only together we reveal him
[1:33:44] it's only together we reveal him it's
[1:33:46] not all me remember one man can't do it
[1:33:49] one man can't do it I can't do it you
[1:33:51] can't do it we've got to stay together
[1:33:53] amen and what is this the rest of those
[1:33:55] Believers that revealed a part of the
[1:33:57] word for their day they're waiting for
[1:33:58] us to fully reveal it to be the
[1:34:00] collective group so that we can all be
[1:34:02] gathered together one in Christ the head
[1:34:04] comes down and then off we go and we go
[1:34:06] to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen
[1:34:09] it's the word working supernaturally in
[1:34:11] you and it's the word working
[1:34:12] supernaturally me to reveal Christ today
[1:34:15] like I said that's the Simplicity of it
[1:34:18] that's the Simplicity of it because they
[1:34:20] won't see everything in you but they'll
[1:34:22] see something in you and they'll see
[1:34:24] something in me
[1:34:26] but they come in here and that's when
[1:34:27] they often see the greater thing and
[1:34:29] they realize there's more to this than
[1:34:30] just one man or one woman it's a whole
[1:34:32] body that's gathered together
[1:34:34] if we go to our first scripture that we
[1:34:36] started with
[1:34:37] in Ephesians 3 it says for this cause I
[1:34:40] bow my knees unto the father of our Lord
[1:34:42] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:34:46] Heaven and Earth is named
[1:34:48] they're waiting on us
[1:34:50] they're in heaven he's not with them
[1:34:53] remember brother Brandon when he went
[1:34:54] over on the other side they said he said
[1:34:55] where's Jesus they said he's a little
[1:34:57] higher why because we can't be gathered
[1:34:59] to him until we're all together it's the
[1:35:02] Gathering Together of the body bride of
[1:35:03] Christ amen it says the whole family in
[1:35:06] Heaven and Earth is named after him that
[1:35:08] he would Grant you according to the
[1:35:09] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:35:12] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:35:14] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:35:17] by faith and that you being rooted and
[1:35:20] grounded in love may be able to
[1:35:22] comprehend
[1:35:24] we look at that comprehension and we
[1:35:26] think well I understand no comprehend by
[1:35:28] experience comprehend by having it in
[1:35:31] your own life what that you may
[1:35:34] comprehend with All Saints
[1:35:36] All Saints
[1:35:38] that's you
[1:35:40] that's me it's all of us together
[1:35:42] there's no big eyes in little used
[1:35:43] church it's all of us together going to
[1:35:46] comprehend it all of us going to
[1:35:48] experience it all of us with that Holy
[1:35:50] Spirit in our lives that All Saints we
[1:35:53] would know what is the breadth the
[1:35:55] length and the depth and the height
[1:35:58] that means we've walked all through it
[1:36:01] we've experienced it all
[1:36:03] we're not just staying in one place but
[1:36:05] as we're walking in the light as he is
[1:36:06] in the light he's taking us into all of
[1:36:08] the riches and goodness and glory of God
[1:36:10] he's taken us into all the blessings of
[1:36:12] God
[1:36:14] he's taking us through all of these
[1:36:15] things and it says and to know the love
[1:36:17] of Christ which passes knowledge that
[1:36:20] you ye plural a body a group a church
[1:36:24] called out once that ye might be filled
[1:36:27] with all the fullness of God he didn't
[1:36:30] just say the fullness of God he said all
[1:36:32] the fullness of God
[1:36:33] what is it Christ coming down into a
[1:36:35] bride to reveal himself completely once
[1:36:38] again
[1:36:39] in a body of the Bride
[1:36:41] that's what we're talking about this is
[1:36:43] this is the Heritage for the Overcomer
[1:36:45] this is the Heritage for the True
[1:36:46] Believer in this age is you are
[1:36:48] revealing Christ to this world
[1:36:50] all of us together
[1:36:53] he says we are flesh and bone of him as
[1:36:56] long as we are the bride of Christ do
[1:36:58] you believe that he says all right he
[1:37:00] died for us and we died to ourselves and
[1:37:03] are buried in his name that we would no
[1:37:05] more be of the world but in him of which
[1:37:07] both the family in heaven is named after
[1:37:09] Jesus Christ he says that's Ephesians 1
[1:37:12] 21. what's the family in heaven named
[1:37:14] Jesus what's the family on Earth named
[1:37:17] well that's the house of God where the
[1:37:19] blood's at
[1:37:21] he says is that right that's the door
[1:37:23] that's the gate that's the place he put
[1:37:25] his name and the Word was made flesh and
[1:37:27] dwelled Among Us it's the word
[1:37:29] reflecting and sparking off the age that
[1:37:32] you're living in that's what he was
[1:37:34] that's what Moses was that's what Jacob
[1:37:36] was that's the rest of them was sparking
[1:37:39] off that word of God the reflector was
[1:37:42] God that God was reflecting himself
[1:37:45] literally he says these men these women
[1:37:47] were the reflection of God in their age
[1:37:49] he says and come to that perfect image
[1:37:52] of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece
[1:37:55] who was struck that he might take the
[1:37:58] rest of them for a bride that's been
[1:38:00] reflectors
[1:38:02] today they have these these wonderful
[1:38:06] telescopes and they have the these
[1:38:08] systems that they have now and they have
[1:38:09] these mirrors
[1:38:11] and see the problem with mirrors is that
[1:38:13] it's very hard to make a perfect mirror
[1:38:15] out of one piece
[1:38:16] especially when you want to get very
[1:38:17] large and very precise and so you know
[1:38:19] how they make a perfect mirror now
[1:38:21] they make it out of many pieces
[1:38:23] they make it on many pieces and they can
[1:38:25] fit it perfectly and they can curve it
[1:38:27] and they can make the shapes that would
[1:38:29] otherwise be very difficult with a
[1:38:30] single piece of glass but with many
[1:38:32] pieces they can make a perfect shape
[1:38:34] that gives a perfect reflection it's so
[1:38:36] perfect it can reflect light perfectly
[1:38:39] without dispersing it they can shoot a
[1:38:41] laser hundreds of thousands of miles and
[1:38:44] that laser stays almost perfectly
[1:38:46] together
[1:38:47] because the mirror is perfect because
[1:38:49] it's made of a bunch of little different
[1:38:51] pieces and you know what makes them
[1:38:53] perfect
[1:38:54] they have a control tower
[1:38:57] that shapes and moves them perfectly to
[1:38:59] make that light go just where they want
[1:39:01] it to go
[1:39:03] the Perfection is in the control
[1:39:06] not in the mirror themselves they're
[1:39:08] polished they're about as perfect as we
[1:39:09] can get it but what the Breakthrough was
[1:39:12] was when they put them all under a
[1:39:13] single controller a single computer or
[1:39:15] super computer that could manage and
[1:39:17] bend them to be just perfect so they
[1:39:19] could get a perfect reflection of what's
[1:39:21] going on out there
[1:39:23] many units perfectly shaped for their
[1:39:27] position in the body controlled by one
[1:39:29] thing
[1:39:30] that was the Breakthrough they made
[1:39:33] you look at mirrors how big a mirror can
[1:39:35] you make
[1:39:36] you start going Beyond maybe five or six
[1:39:38] or eight feet and you have to do pieces
[1:39:39] and panels but they start just making
[1:39:41] just these tiny little facets and all of
[1:39:44] them together brought the perfect
[1:39:45] reflection that they needed to do the
[1:39:47] Technologies they have today for lasers
[1:39:49] and and SpaceX exploration and all these
[1:39:52] different things it's absolutely
[1:39:53] phenomenal what they do in the cost cost
[1:39:55] is in the billions and billions of
[1:39:57] dollars to do it but they've achieved
[1:39:59] something they could never do it before
[1:40:00] what many different little pieces under
[1:40:03] one control
[1:40:05] what is it Christ the head being
[1:40:07] reflected in a perfect body controlled
[1:40:09] by him
[1:40:11] what are we reflecting today Church
[1:40:14] what are you reflecting
[1:40:16] I'll tell you what you're reflecting is
[1:40:17] what's controlling you
[1:40:19] what's controlling you is going to be
[1:40:21] reflected in what you're doing because
[1:40:22] if you're on your own thing all you need
[1:40:24] in that mirror is for one piece to be
[1:40:27] out of place by a fraction
[1:40:29] of a millimeter
[1:40:32] and the entire mirror is imperfect
[1:40:35] it can't reflect the image just that one
[1:40:37] little piece out
[1:40:39] so it means we've all got to be in our
[1:40:40] place
[1:40:41] we've all got to be under the same
[1:40:43] control
[1:40:44] not a man
[1:40:46] but the head Jesus Christ the word and
[1:40:48] in that we have a perfect reflection
[1:40:51] when we're under his perfect control
[1:40:52] because we don't know
[1:40:54] we don't know how to do it
[1:40:55] but if we're under the holy spirit's
[1:40:57] control then all of a sudden we get
[1:40:59] right in line with everything else and
[1:41:01] it forms that perfect sphere and all of
[1:41:03] a sudden the image is perfect there amen
[1:41:06] here's one thing
[1:41:09] I don't worry if the image isn't perfect
[1:41:10] today
[1:41:13] I worry if the image is not getting
[1:41:15] better every day
[1:41:17] if it's not becoming clear because Paul
[1:41:19] said he says we see through a glass
[1:41:20] Darkly
[1:41:22] we're going we're growing we're
[1:41:23] progressing
[1:41:25] I'm not worried if it's not clear yet
[1:41:27] I'm worried if I'm not seeing a little
[1:41:29] bit more every day
[1:41:31] every week why I want to be growing I
[1:41:33] want to be maturing I want to be a
[1:41:35] greater revelation of Jesus Christ today
[1:41:37] amen I want as we sing that song Lord
[1:41:39] let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me is
[1:41:42] it being revealed day by day are the
[1:41:44] things of this world growing strangely
[1:41:45] dim
[1:41:47] that's what you'll see Church you'll see
[1:41:48] the world getting dim and Christ coming
[1:41:51] into light in your life when he's
[1:41:53] working there amen
[1:41:55] brother Brian would say this he says see
[1:41:57] as a man he made himself God just before
[1:42:00] the cross they said to him we do not
[1:42:02] Stone me for a good work that you've
[1:42:03] done but we Stone thee because you're a
[1:42:05] man making yourself God he was God he
[1:42:08] said he was God was in him and so then
[1:42:10] he said if you can't believe me believe
[1:42:12] the works that I do see just believe the
[1:42:15] works that there of God he says well now
[1:42:18] the same thing is today
[1:42:21] he's declaring it's the same thing he
[1:42:23] says there's no man on Earth as a god
[1:42:25] certainly not we're all human beings
[1:42:27] everyone born and sin shaped and
[1:42:28] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:42:30] but as we've been through it so plainly
[1:42:32] this week to show that God once lived
[1:42:35] above his creature because of sin then
[1:42:37] he lived with this creature in the form
[1:42:38] of a body Jesus Christ he put his tent
[1:42:41] with us dwelt with us made flesh with us
[1:42:43] to suffer sin and pains Agony and the
[1:42:45] things that he do he says but then he
[1:42:48] Sanctified a church that he might dwell
[1:42:50] in
[1:42:52] so it was God above us God With Us God
[1:42:54] in us Jesus said at that day you'll know
[1:42:57] I'm in the Father the father's in me and
[1:43:00] I in you and you and me he says and you
[1:43:03] see there it's God working through
[1:43:06] so when a person is so completely
[1:43:08] yielded to the Holy Spirit and speaking
[1:43:11] it is not the person speaking
[1:43:15] I know that by experience he says of all
[1:43:17] my little experience with Christ I found
[1:43:19] the times that he would permit me to
[1:43:22] yield myself to him till I didn't know
[1:43:24] what I was saying he says and I wouldn't
[1:43:27] have said that for nothing in the world
[1:43:28] but he said he said the things that I
[1:43:30] said under yielding to him I would never
[1:43:32] say in myself
[1:43:34] why there were two fantastic two
[1:43:36] Supernatural too crazy to this world but
[1:43:38] he says under that yielding he says I
[1:43:40] would say things that I would never
[1:43:43] choose to say otherwise
[1:43:44] what's he saying he's saying church when
[1:43:46] we can get out of the way
[1:43:48] that's when he can get us into the way
[1:43:51] to bring us into his path amen we look
[1:43:53] at this thought
[1:43:55] of the Holy Spirit and we want to wield
[1:43:57] the Holy Spirit
[1:44:00] that's not the way this works Church
[1:44:03] he wields us as we yield to him
[1:44:09] we are the tool he is not the tool
[1:44:13] he's the controller
[1:44:15] he's a controller and see what we do is
[1:44:16] is we get this idea and what it is is we
[1:44:18] get caught up in ourselves
[1:44:20] as we start to say this is how it's
[1:44:22] going to be and this is where it's going
[1:44:23] to go and this is what it's going to do
[1:44:24] and that's not it why you have to be
[1:44:27] permitted by God to yield yourself
[1:44:29] that's the way brother Brown said it he
[1:44:30] permits you to yield
[1:44:33] so it's a work of God that does it to
[1:44:34] the point where you can step in to the
[1:44:37] place where you're completely removed
[1:44:38] and now it's Christ working through you
[1:44:40] and it's perfect in that place and that
[1:44:42] time because you're not a part of it
[1:44:44] you're not a part of it it's just him
[1:44:46] working through you amen
[1:44:48] he uses us not the other way around amen
[1:44:50] that's the sign of the adopted son is
[1:44:53] when you're out of the way and you're
[1:44:54] only doing the will of the father you've
[1:44:56] stepped into the word so completely that
[1:44:58] everything else is separated including
[1:45:00] our thoughts our opinions our
[1:45:03] preferences our desires our plans our
[1:45:06] will everything is gone and all you are
[1:45:08] is just a microphone for God to speak
[1:45:10] through you amen
[1:45:12] that's when hell can't stand before his
[1:45:14] church
[1:45:15] is when we're walking with him
[1:45:17] and he's telling us what to do he's
[1:45:19] telling us where to go and he's telling
[1:45:20] us what to say that's when everything
[1:45:22] falls before us
[1:45:23] let's stand together if we would I'm
[1:45:25] going to read just two more quotes
[1:45:27] he said then
[1:45:28] what you do in word and deed do it all
[1:45:32] in the name of Jesus I'm going to stop
[1:45:34] right there and say can you say that
[1:45:36] whatever you're doing you can say thus
[1:45:38] saith the Lord behind it can you say
[1:45:40] this is what God wants me to do
[1:45:43] when we sit down in front of our
[1:45:45] computer can we say whatever follows I
[1:45:47] can put Christ's name behind it as we
[1:45:49] step and we open up our phones and we do
[1:45:51] things on it can we say I can put
[1:45:52] Christ's name behind it when we go to
[1:45:54] work and the things we say and the
[1:45:56] people we talk to and the way we do
[1:45:58] things can we say I can put Christ's
[1:46:00] Name Behind what I'm doing today
[1:46:02] the scripture says whatever you do in
[1:46:04] word and deed do it all in the name of
[1:46:06] Jesus that's a high standard
[1:46:09] to say everything I'm doing in my life I
[1:46:12] can write the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:13] behind it that's how taught him I am
[1:46:15] with the word
[1:46:16] that's a challenge church that's a
[1:46:18] challenge
[1:46:19] it's a challenge for me I know can I say
[1:46:21] that everything I'm doing I can be I can
[1:46:24] say I would be happy to sign Jesus
[1:46:26] Christ's name behind it
[1:46:29] he says after that what you do he says
[1:46:32] but first you have become in his name he
[1:46:36] didn't say you've come in his name he
[1:46:37] says you've become
[1:46:39] you've been transformed
[1:46:41] you've been adopted you've been changed
[1:46:43] into something you earned he says you
[1:46:45] become in his name he says there is many
[1:46:47] fine women in this building tonight find
[1:46:49] loyal women but there's only one Mrs
[1:46:51] William Branham she's the one that goes
[1:46:53] home with me she's the one that's my
[1:46:55] wife there's fine people in the world
[1:46:57] find churches but there's one Mrs Jesus
[1:47:00] Christ and that's who he's coming for
[1:47:02] listen to this he says that's where his
[1:47:05] name Lays
[1:47:06] that's where his worship is in her and
[1:47:10] her alone he says that is true now he's
[1:47:13] not saying she is worshiped he's saying
[1:47:15] the only true worship of Christ comes
[1:47:18] through her
[1:47:19] because why she's got his name
[1:47:22] the only woman I'm looking to have
[1:47:24] worship me or appreciate me or talk me
[1:47:28] up is my wife
[1:47:30] that's the only one that matters to me
[1:47:33] I appreciate a sincere compliment from
[1:47:37] from another woman but the only one that
[1:47:39] I really look for is in her because
[1:47:41] she's got my name she's the one I chose
[1:47:43] she's the one that I believe is going to
[1:47:45] reflect me she's the one that I trust is
[1:47:47] going to give me honest feedback real
[1:47:48] feedback
[1:47:50] so so a compliment to me doesn't do much
[1:47:52] except it comes through my wife and
[1:47:54] another woman if she starts
[1:47:55] complimenting me a lot you know what I
[1:47:56] say
[1:47:57] I don't want anything to do with you
[1:47:59] because you're getting into my wife's
[1:48:01] position
[1:48:03] right you're trying to you're getting
[1:48:04] close to me you're presuming that
[1:48:06] there's a relationship that allows you
[1:48:09] to say these things and more that I want
[1:48:11] to receive them from you but I don't I
[1:48:12] only want them from my wife he says the
[1:48:14] only one that can give and the scripture
[1:48:17] says that we're the only ones we're a
[1:48:18] priesthood that gives the acceptable
[1:48:20] sacrifices to God we're the only ones
[1:48:22] can do it because we have his name we
[1:48:24] know what he likes we know what he wants
[1:48:26] and even our worship he says the only
[1:48:28] worship that he accepts is through the
[1:48:30] bride of Christ why because she's
[1:48:32] gathered in his name
[1:48:34] she's his choice she's his church she's
[1:48:36] the called out ones he says that's the
[1:48:38] only one so you go into a church and
[1:48:39] they're not gathered in Christ's name
[1:48:41] they can worship they can shout they can
[1:48:43] dance they can play their music they can
[1:48:44] do whatever they want and it's not even
[1:48:46] received by God why because they're
[1:48:48] under a different name they're not his
[1:48:50] wife
[1:48:51] he says oh yes sir we find that to be
[1:48:53] true that's why all we do in word or
[1:48:56] indeed we do it in the name of Jesus
[1:48:58] Christ
[1:48:59] what my wife does whether I like it or
[1:49:01] not it's in my name
[1:49:04] it's in my name so when she does well
[1:49:05] praise the Lord when she doesn't guess
[1:49:07] what it's on me in the end because she's
[1:49:08] doing it in my name and what he's saying
[1:49:10] he's saying as the bride of Christ
[1:49:12] everything you do
[1:49:13] it ought to be worshipful to him it
[1:49:16] ought to give glory to him it ought to
[1:49:17] give praise to him because you're doing
[1:49:18] it in his name
[1:49:20] so watch what you're doing
[1:49:21] be careful what you're doing that you
[1:49:23] can put his name behind it without
[1:49:25] shaming him without causing him to Bow
[1:49:26] his head and say oh here we go again
[1:49:29] last quote he says he wants to be one
[1:49:32] with God us to be one with God and God
[1:49:35] is the word each individual in his heart
[1:49:38] must be that one with God
[1:49:43] I can't get you there
[1:49:45] I can preach the word but you've got to
[1:49:47] be one with the word The Living Word
[1:49:49] that's the only way we're going to make
[1:49:51] a church and I'll preach until I turn
[1:49:53] blue in the face
[1:49:54] but we've got to have a heart to receive
[1:49:56] it
[1:49:57] and we've got to have a life that
[1:49:58] follows what our heart says is there
[1:50:00] and we've got to have a reality of a
[1:50:02] relationship with Christ if we're going
[1:50:04] to make it on the other side amen let's
[1:50:06] bow our heads each one Heavenly Father
[1:50:11] Lord we're not here of ourselves
[1:50:14] we're here because you called us out
[1:50:16] Lord we're not a denomination
[1:50:19] Lord we're not seeking my leadership
[1:50:22] Lord we're seeking your leadership by
[1:50:24] the Holy Spirit Lord
[1:50:26] but Lord we're wanting that name
[1:50:29] Lord to be worshiped in US
[1:50:32] Lord that we will be to the glory of
[1:50:33] your praise
[1:50:35] Lord that your grace Lord will not lead
[1:50:37] us into disgrace that we would not abuse
[1:50:39] it Lord but Lord that we would take the
[1:50:41] Grace Covenant that you've given us Lord
[1:50:42] that under that shed blood Lord we would
[1:50:45] represent your name holy every single
[1:50:47] day

[1:50:50] Holy Lord that our words would say holy
[1:50:53] holy holy Lord that our homes will be
[1:50:55] holy holy holy Lord that every aspect of
[1:50:58] us would be a reflection of the true
[1:51:00] image of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father
[1:51:03] Lord unite us together Lord your word
[1:51:06] said that we have Fellowship one another
[1:51:07] one with another when we're
[1:51:09] fellowshipping with you as well Lord
[1:51:11] grant us Grace to be drawn together each
[1:51:13] one
[1:51:14] Lord pray that you have feed our souls
[1:51:15] with that word of eternal life Lord that
[1:51:18] we would lay hold of it Lord that we
[1:51:19] would not let go Lord that we would lay
[1:51:21] claim to what you've given us in this
[1:51:23] age that you revealed to us Lord in that
[1:51:25] we'd stick with it and let it have its
[1:51:27] perfect work we pray
[1:51:29] Lord help us to surrender
[1:51:31] Lord give us the mind of Christ every
[1:51:33] day
[1:51:34] Lord that we would do your will Lord and
[1:51:36] until we found it Lord we would wait on
[1:51:38] you
[1:51:39] Lord give us patience to rest and wait
[1:51:41] we pray
[1:51:42] Lord bless us now we ask in Jesus

[2:12:46] praise the Lord as we go let's uh let's
[2:12:50] sing God still moves it's 9 16 up there
[2:12:55] and just to say uh we appreciate any uh
[2:12:59] anybody staying behind just to help with
[2:13:02] the moving of the pews out into the
[2:13:04] fellowship hall and that's got to go and
[2:13:07] we're going to lift this there's a
[2:13:09] couple of things we have to do we've got
[2:13:10] to move essentially we had to move
[2:13:11] everything out of the
[2:13:14] out of the sanctuary shortly
[2:13:17] because the uh the installers are coming
[2:13:21] in tomorrow to carpet the whole the
[2:13:23] whole place right from that wall to that
[2:13:25] wall
[2:13:26] so uh
[2:13:28] if if we could if the brothers could
[2:13:32] give us a hand to just do some of that
[2:13:34] won't take long nothing is fasting to
[2:13:37] the floor except for that partition
[2:13:39] which will take take out shortly as well
[2:13:42] so it shouldn't take us too long
[2:13:44] so we could do that the other thing I'm
[2:13:46] going to ask is this you could take
[2:13:47] everything out of the pews
[2:13:49] uh as if you don't it'll end up being
[2:13:52] stacked somewhere when you come back to
[2:13:54] church
[2:13:54] sit near a few you may not find what you
[2:13:57] had when you left so if you would just
[2:14:00] take everything out and uh and that way
[2:14:02] it won't be lost or anything else I've
[2:14:04] been honest to you just move it out
[2:14:07] okay so let's sing this uh
[2:14:11] we'll we'll see God still moves for the
[2:14:14] day where you just
