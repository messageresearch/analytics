our Lord Jesus Christ a man and a man alleluia alleluia now I really all things are possible now [Music] [Music] [Music] a man preach the name of the Lord God bless you turn with me to Zechariah chapter 4 and again to remember in prayer the family of the young man that died in gamble just a few days ago to my knowledge I'd never met him but again as I've said regarding his grandfather and his grandmother hard to believe that I'm looking at that many years that I was raised with his grandfather and his grandmother a man and in fact that family and our family were very close in fact it was the family that every year when the school closed for the summer holidays and vacation and to break that that family and our family would go to a place called Traverse Brook and there we would set up tents and they were military tents not just regular tents but they were military tents which meant they were very large and that family put their tent there and our family hadn't had right next to it a man and we we all lived together we all enjoyed his fellowship together amen and it was it was right next to the water as well and we all would all would eat at the same picnic tables and so on and so the grandfather that young man was one of one of that members of the other family he's just maybe two or three years older than I am but no doubt it is sad for them to have lost the way they lost him the loss there to lose their grandson in the last few days so the grace of God we pray and I wasn't aware of exactly what had happened until yesterday when we had fellowship myself sister Betty was asked over to her brother my brother Aaron in paradise and because there was a friend a man there was a friend that again we were neighbors when we lived in gamble and I haven't seen her I guess in almost 60 years but she came into the city and she wanted to meet with our family here again and of course she's a lady that did help my mother she's just like I said two or three years or three or four years no three or four years older than I am and so on so we had a time of fellowship but she did inform you as to the passing of that gentle that young man so the grace of God be with the family and the grace of God be with again our the friend that we met with and we we just know her as class and her name was class abbot and of course is she she's been married for over 60 years or no you know quite young no no over 50 years and believe it or not and I was shocked when I learned that they are now living in Deer Lake and they knew brother Claude Gail yeah so it oh yes they we know him yeah we've met him in different places amen I said good as I said just not long ago I said I had to do his funeral and and they remembered those things amen that oh yes he was in the home and seniors almond ear like as a yes he was you know so we pray the grace of God to class and her husband and her family a man so grace to us all brother well this is serious when it words they're not just get we're getting old but I'll tell you this the world is old the world is getting old and brother while the world needs the world don't recognize well we need I trust we do recognize and what we need as the right of Christ not not all believers recognized the need but we're going to highlight it within the neck I guess today and then hopefully it'll not hopefully but I assume it's gonna take a number of services to to get the full revelation of it of what we need and brothers sister and without it we're lost and oh well well that's where we might say well that that's that's Jesus or that's Calvary or that's this that's that no oh no what produced Jesus what produced Calvary what produced the revelation of the word brother it's the grace of God a man so any gonna be on that it is divine love but God is divine love a man but divine law projected grace a man so we want to get into though some of thoughts on grace a man grace in the beginning grace in the end knowing that you can go back to eternity and find the grace of God amen because there's a if it's in time it was in the mind of God in eternity our names are on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world a man so that was grace a man as the public of God said God when in the Garden of Eden he said I could have just waked the whole thing off again started again he did it before he could do it again you know but the second time he didn't do it we maybe we would feel well God the three is perfection so God would wipe it off and start again with the third no no so he could reveal what he want to reveal in another creation no in in the time of Adam and Eve that's when divine love projected grace a man so god help us that will recognize if there's anything we absolutely need it is the revelation of brace a man regardless of the age in which we live we go right back to the beginning is Grace and we're gonna think about Abel we're gonna think about Enoch is Grace well the Marigny is grace a man so we need the same thing amen in Zechariah chapter 4 and verse 1 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and is seven lamps there on a man coming right on down into the church ages he said which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees a man now we're getting go back to the Jews and two olive trees by it and those two olive trees representing the two messengers to Israel a man and to olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side of the bowl and so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these me and I said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of oats alleluia who art thou o great mountain before survivable thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it a man acknowledging that in all circumstances in all situations it is the grace of God so he said who are that oh great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and verse 14 said then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth a man and there's a reference to revelation 11 and the gospel going back to the Jews and the two messengers god bless you may be seated there was a thought that was coming to me some time ago that I have not expressed but just express it concerning the Ministry of the word to the bride and what is the significance of it and what is the purpose of it that God is not just leaving us with just tapes of a prophet God is not just leaving us with the books of a prophet remember this puts us back into the world a man by the grace of God it it turns our hearts back by the grace of God but what is the purpose behind what God has done and behind what God is doing we know that it is Grace we know that it is unmerited favor we know that we don't deserve it because of the nature that we were born with and the nature of the flesh because as David confessed he said we're all born in sin and shaped an iniquity a man and he was asking God for grace he was acknowledging his sin he was acknowledging his nature but he's the Lord that's the way that I was born and going right back of course to the original sin so it is the grace of god but God dealt with David ganda with the others God wrote referenced David and he Fanny and he certainly gave grace to David a man because of David's attitude David was humble gave it recognized his need of it a man the grace of God he didn't hate it puffs himself up no no he elevated God to God be the glory so in the preaching and teaching of the word what is it that we as individuals are looking for are we looking just for teaching are we looking just for more information and that we will we'll know we'll learn more and more about the message or are we looking for instructions in righteousness are we looking for God to teachers what we need to be taught I mean looking for God to word through the preaching of the word to work on us in a very personal way a man not just appreciate in an impersonal but to preach it in a personal way because why because it's in the redemption is in the word the grace of God is in the word amen and what is God desiring to accomplish it is to perfect us it is to bring us more and more and more in line with the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ more and more in line to where to where we are we are going to die to ourselves and become alive to him a man so we're looking for God to minister the word to line us up with the word we're looking for God to minister to us through his word in a very personal way Lord and that he's going to get down and get personal with you get personal with me yes he got personal with you with I believe he got personal with Enoch he got personal with that of a need he got personal with Abel he got NES he even got personal with it with it with Cain a man and and Adam and Noah prayed by the grace of Almighty God so we've got to understand that we've got a hunger and we will if we aware the seat of God we're gonna honor and thirst for God to get personal with us and tell us this correct us air instruct us there what is it you want me to do how is that you want me to think how's that you want me to talk what do you want me to say where do you want me to go Lord what is your will it is not my real father line me down a man we could there's going to be there those there are missing the rapture missing the resurrect renessa were in that day they're gonna be there and they're gonna have a knowledge of the word of God and knowledge of the message and knowledge of this revelation that revelation but because he never applied it in a personal way amen and acknowledging the grace of God in at all and home of themselves they're not going to make it a man again not what they did but what they didn't do they failed to acknowledge grace they failed to apply grace a man they fail due to what for grace in action in their heart and in their souls and when his grace new grace humbles us amen grace brings us down and God brings us up a man when acknowledging the grace of God I'm a sinner saved by grace and so on it is by grace through faith that we are saying amen let's not just focus on the faith which is the revelation of the word but we got to focus on the grace and let's be thankful for the grace because without the grace there we would not have the faith as we ought to have it amen it would not be to us what it ought to be to us and that is eternal life amen praise the name of the Lord so is our faith that we have and all the things that we know and understand it is in my lighting grace is the magnifying grace in your heart and in your soul a man because as they were they're going to be there and they know this they know this they know that but they're not acknowledging grace a man they're not acknowledging the the love of God and the mercy of God toward them that I am and I am by the grace of God a man brother sister that I believe what I believe by the grace of God that I see what I see by the grace of God a man and again we want what is Grace it is the unmerited favor of God we don't deserve it amen because of our nature that we have in our flesh because of how we come into the world and sometimes it's because of what we're focusing on and not what God pleases God but what pleases us and what pleases the devil so remember that's what that's what you got to be careful of when it comes to our our walk with God when it comes to professing to believe when it comes to believing the older that I have the right faith and but is it the faith that pleases God a man or is it a faith that pleases us a man is it is it in my favor naturally is that in my favor in everyday living or as air is that in my favor eternally a man remember that after the devil finished with Adam and Eve they saw that it was good for food pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise a man this is absolutely amazing than they oh yeah when they listen to the devil this is what II revealed to them this is how that II gave them the false interpretation of the word and he only added a word may you take away a word you add a word any man and and and then individuals can walk away with the same revelation that Eve walked away with a man president says when the woman saw that the tree was good for food pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise so we need the food and well yeah we need a more pleasant attitude and so on and oh yeah and we need wisdom but brothers you've got to get it from God by grace and not from the devil amen he'll make you make you believe that what he's giving you oh yeah you're gonna be as God's a man well brother you gotta say with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen and acknowledging the acknowledging the grace of God behind it acknowledging the love of God that has projected it amen amen love love coming down with grace a man Oh Lord we don't deserve it all brother you went at him and he went into the garden and into the trees and hid themselves knowing knowing that they they had transgressed of the word knowing that they had ignored God knowing that they I turned their back on God a man press the truth because they were deceived by the enemy and they believed that they were going to be as gods but brother I truly went with when they got it and it all came to pass a man and they were experiencing the results of what they did they realized they were not like God amen brother and sister and in the light of all that's going on in the world today brother than anything we're going to just go along with this and go along with that and and all just have an intellectual knowledge of the word the mechanics but not the dynamics all brothers sister one of these days they're going to hide themselves a man among the trees of the garden amen because they miss the rapture because they missed the resurrection so brother we got to take the word in a very personal way according to the will of God is that accomplishing us what God wants it to accomplish Amen is that giving us a faith that God wants us to have a man now he gave a gave Adam and Eve faith here as I said good for food pleasant to the eyes good to be desired to make one wise but again it's gotta it's got to be the food that God wants us to have and it's got it's got to be the pleasant as there like the people to read the piece of the word the rest of the word and so on and the source of the word eternal life amen by the grace of God not natural but eternal and desired to make one wise having the wisdom of God and if you got wisdom get understanding a man so they got wisdom but they never gonna know you I was too late it was too late when they got understanding that's why they hid themselves among the trees of the garden and it is too late when to win a lot of believers are good at we get understanding and they're going to end up in the Great Tribulation looking for the rapture amen but it already and it already happened and passed and they didn't know it so brother sister let's not be hungry and thirsting for just teaching of the word teaching of the word I want to learn this I want to learn that but we want the word to have that God's desire affecting our lives and that is to Humble us because they that are humbled will be exalted amen there you put yourself down God's going to take you out by the grace of God amen we need the teaching of the word but at the same time he should magnify grace amen if we're gonna receive it in the right way recognize that as being of God it's going to Humble us Oh Lord Lord my lord it's your grace that I can see that it's your grace that I understand that if your grace that O Lord I pray that you have given it I pray Lord it's going to accomplish in me what you wanted to accomplish amen pray the grace of Almighty God it's one thing the new and again it's one thing to know it another thing to believe it one thing to know it another thing to do it a man to believe it and do it and he may end the groats and walking the light as he is in the light amen as I said I just come in and sit in it but walk in it amen so it absolutely by the grave is Grace in your life and you're experiencing grace with it you acknowledge the grace with it you are humbling yourselves what's it going to do it's going to control your life amen it's going to govern your life amen you again you got to you're going to have that that nature that jesus said not my real father thank me done praise the name of the Lord there's a lot of preachers with brother Aeterna there so they had that a anointing that Jesus had and they had the gifts that Jesus had they certainly wouldn't preach like Jesus preached a man and brother and the prophet of God was facing the same thing in his ministry he got their attention under the first and the second pole and finally you know but he started to get into the word into the word and they NDB had to come - brother bouncers brother Brown stop preaching this stop preaching that why because he was Eva's getting more and more personal amen and anything he was challenging the people to get personal with the word believe us now this amen as Jesus did with Martha saw the prophet of God it was God in him doing well it was God when Luther a God with Wesley God with the Pentecostals and others that God was using it was it had become personal with God amen and that's why revelry has way Luther got the revelation that he got he headed into that personal relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ amen and get the resurrection and rapture we gotta enter into that personal relationship with Jesus a man by the grace of almighty god and the prophet of god went through with this sign of that sign got their attention and they're all coming to well just to see the gifts but they wanted healing they wanted signs and wonders and so on but but I got to the place where the probably begin to put a little emphasis here on the word little emphasis there on the word it was the grace of God a man what for now it wasn't just for their healing it was for their salvation Amen it is by grace through faith we are saved and there are some ourselves it is the gift of God a man they wanted they wanted the faith for the healing of their bodies but they didn't want the faith for the change of the body then he was a faith for this day in this hour of the resurrection and the rapture a man no no and and even those that well-known evangelist went over to the apartment of God and brother Branham and he said brother Branham he said you've got to stop preaching those things he said because the people are going to turn your turn away from you and in the power of God's the will he said brother who's going to preach it and he said we'll leave it to the pastor's well he said if they're not doing and he said somebody's got to do it a man so everybody so he kept on preaching it what for even he was bringing it into a new closer relationship with God he was he was trying to bring the believer any man get the attention of the believers to believe a man and I just believe in signs and wonders anybody he said go forth he shouldn't do this and do this and get the people to believe and what was he to get him to believe the word and what word he was he to get him to believe when we know what he had again Luther I believe and Wesley in the Pentecostals what is he had to get us to believe a man why God did there in Logar he did it because he got Luther to believe he did got Wesley to believe he got the Pentecostals of any Amen but now he's endeavouring to get another another group to believe a may another part of the bride to believe a man in this bright age they believe that they believe this they believe they then something else and God bless them but now brother sister God a God is challenging this generation to believe the word the resurrection a trifling faith a man not 90 night of healing anymore no go beyond that a man and he was challenging them in a very personal way a man to a play the word in a very personal way to their lives are you right with God do you wear the faith that pleases God not just for healing but for the change of the body by the grace of Almighty God ain't man the powder God said we a in 1953 I've said it before let me say it again he said listen he said we had I believe it was so many years of divine seven years of divine healing he said a memorial of divine healing and memorial what is a memorial you sort of a memorial for something that is past a man and he says that have been a memorial of divine Eenie and it was in 1953 that he said he begin to move from the signs and the wonders and begin to put more and more and more emphasis on the word amen to bring the people into a personal relationship with the word Amen brother it's got to be a personal relationship out of the heart with the Word of God that gives us the faith that pleases God a man because you can you can be healed and go to hell you're going to experience God in your flesh and go to hell ain't man but a you've got to have it you've got to get it in your soul it's got to be very personal in your soul and brother turn any revelation they may in the foundation thereof in our in our hearts and in our souls in what we believe in our faith if there's any foundation on which everything else is built it is the grace of God amen and it is a grace with that as the attributes of divine love a man and because why again as I said in a in Ephesians there where they say always my grace were saved by grace by grace no we're not we are saved by grace through faith let's take the whole truth and nothing by the truth amen don't leave this said only that nobody I believe in Satan that it that is preached Lanting he got among the churches he got among the evangelists he got among the preachers and they said oh that you're saved by grace you're saved by grace why because they weren't putting the emphasis on faith what God was doing in what God has done and what God was revealing oh they are they all pointed back to to Calvary that's right they pointed back to Calvary but that was God revealing himself in flesh you know he promised it right back there in the Garden of Eden he fulfilled it in the Alpha Ministry of Jesus but Jesus made other promises that he was going to fulfill in the in the Omega ministry in the last days the resurrection and the rapture a man what he was doing in the Old Testament through this province through this ministry in that ministry was pointing into the Messiah now through this for the church is plenty of us is plenty of - in Messiah Hall right a man but he's putting us - our Lord and our Savior the resurrection and the rapture because a man see this is why when he was getting close to the end of that doubtful ministry that's why he highlighted these things to Martha there concerning the resurrection and the rapture ain't man brother said anyway what believe us now this brother they think they were experiencing the grace of God in having fellowship with the Messiah 2,000 years ago but now there was that Messiah was going to do other things and it was going to be a challenge to our faith amen by the grace of God believe us now this a man that was not not just the whole I'm the Messiah and I do this and I do that and I do that but do you believe that I am the resurrection hey man hallelujah because they were moving from the revelation of just Messiah they were getting to go to get deeper into it by the grace of God to recognize the Messiah and yes he was our Redeemer he's our Savior but now amen hallelujah he would lay shed his blood lay his life down pick it up again amen he's our Redeemer a man but now do you believe he's our resurrection and her rapture because it's not just a redeemer is to resurrect us and rapture us and change us and take us back where we come from hey man Gaga was giving them the faith to believe the Messiah the Messiah to redeem a man redemption redemption praise the name of the Lord it was all future tense but now it is past tense and it is in the present tense do you believe that I am that I will be the resurrection I am the resurrection a man praise the name of the Lord as I was bringing up with after brother Marc ministered on Wednesday there concerning God God is not gonna go there this was way back there way back there way back there well when it comes to God it's not past as my future it's all present a man in the eyes of God is all present brothers sister amen believe us now this a man now they God did God was and God will be God is a man is not a tightness in the chest Jesus said I am the resurrection and the light and before Abraham was I am and not only that winning when he got to the place where he was getting ready to leave the world like you and I what did he talk over hallelujah what a faith that he had Amen what revelation he had when he said in John John 17 he said I am he said no more in the world what I'm sure that he never never understood it but he said no more in the world what do you mean here they II was standing there is this able arm is this I was hurtin you're not I will be no more in the world he said I am no more in the world that was his faith a man that was the revelation of the word than he was that even that he was becoming one with that revelation a man that he was going to shed his blood and lay his life down he was going to do this do this and pick up that life again everybody so now here but it's not all praise the Lord has done it's done is done no it's not done yet and he gave their promise that a that each the resurrection and he's the rapture and he and he proved a man any any snakes are going to Jerusalem he said go to the upper room and we were there when we visited Jerusalem and so on and he says you stay there and he said the Holy Ghost to come amen and they went for preaching amen the Messiah had come but now they're pointing to another promise now they were pointing to another ministry now they were playing to something else the Messiah was going to do a man there you believe in Redemption amen but now we got to get you to believe in the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of Almighty God amen old brothers sister I pray for that power of God and that grace of God in our lives to reveal those things to us amen and it's not our is not our minds it's not a print elect and we think we know we can read I can do this and I can do that yeah oh I can read oh yeah so can the devil ain't 9:00 so it's not as not just reading it's believing believe it's not what you read amen and what you read are you understanding what you read now you can I even tore his read it and just a wisdom oh yeah and it's like that brother used to be on television and he could he could quote scripture after scripture after scripture and sometimes he could quote Google anything just repeat over not reverse Smitty a repeater a chapter or so many chapters and not even look at the Bible amen because he had wisdom and yeah yeah that ability but again that's not that's not salvation salvation is becoming one with inward not in your head but in your heart amen and listen if it's in your head you go out and talk about it but it's in your heart you live it amen that's the difference and there are those that go they can talk and talk and talk and Doggett but everliving it Amen Alleluia because if you if you if it's in your heart it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen with expectation or fulfillment if it's in your heart it is the Living Word of the God a man and it's not what you're saying it's what you're living because the public God brings it out and he said your actions speak louder than your words a man he says no but you say he says what you do amen all praise the Lord hallelujah never never thought about it on the now they were concerning what I preached not what you did is what you didn't do amen and the Father God has seen is not what you're saying oh I say I believe this I believe he said the devil can do the same thing but he said your actions speak louder than your words amen you can say I believe this and I believe that and you can have your house full of the books and the tapes or whatever but when you go out is it in your heart ain't man are there was the revelation that's in the book in your heart is the revelation of the tape in your heart a man is the revelation of Malachi 4 in your heart to many it's in their heads with it but it's not in their hearts and listen the public God recognized that and that's why he said in the message why cry speak he said we are putting too much emphasis on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics and he and he went on to saying we're going to need a double portion of the Holy Ghost to get us off there God help us to be spiritual in our thoughts spiritually in our action spiritually in earned our words and deeds a man and that it's not coming out of our heads it's coming out of our hearts amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother it's the heart God is in the heart God is on the it's the prophet of God that has not even gone outside and I having got inside in your spirit he says having got on the inside of the inside he said it's in your heart in your soul amen and there are those that got got in there on the outside think I got in their heads that I got in their human spirits obey but not in their souls hey man many oh come and say I have and I done this and done that done that something else hey Angie said I never knew you very man you're talking about false anointed ones amen we'll get in and get into that eventually as I said I have been bringing that message and bringing it but we have it how I haven't they got into it yet amen but there are so much that we need to be aware of that so much that we need to be given attention to and then I want to give the attention to their personal relationship with Christ amen your personal revelation that it is grace that it is grace grace you're here because of grace not because of an intellectual knowledge or I go there because there's a they're gonna preach what I believe they're gonna I'm going to go there because the brothers and sisters they go there or they believe like I believe and so on no no it is grace amen it is the grace of God amen it's now you're praying for your brother you're praying for your sister anybody but you're acknowledging grace in your life and you're praying Greece in their lights amen amen I tell you if anything we need is grace old brothers sister I am saved I am kept by the power of God through faith that's right but it is my grace amen I know what I know by grace I die and when okay if I do with a will of God and I good and and do do what God wants me to do that's grace anybody it's all grace grace grace and again brother we got the revelation of grace in our hearts you're gonna be humble and no is not and it's not just you know put on humility it's gonna be a Holy Ghost humility coming at an art that brother that sister ocean she and him they're really really humble that's the truth right from the heart and I can go back and they're named names of believers that I've experienced over the years and say well that brothers humble that sisters humble that's the Holy Ghost in their hearts anyway by the grace of Almighty God it's not there and they didn't take pleasure in and be being mean you know uplifted and praise no no they get they said give the glory to God how many times when people say some good things about mother Journal and I said well I said they've made that's not me and I said that's the grace of God I can do nothing without the grace of God to really please God see its grace it is the unmerited favor of God and as the Providence acarajé was I highlighting the angel was I tithing to a lady to a cerebral and Zechariah and he said he shall bring for the headstone thereof with shoutings amen probably claim on grace grace grace amen a reminder this is the unmerited favor of God grace grace the headstone coming down ain't my hand that came down as the Messiah the headstone has come down as the resurrection around through the the heavenly bridegroom to be united with the early bride a man and the angels of claim grace grace grace amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother disgrace in the Old Testament Grace in the new there's their disgrace and the message of the hour amen positive tone what were what were the grace we won't add the faith that pleases God we could have 99% of it or you'll end up with a hundred and one percent one hundred and ten percent but God wants a hundred percent leave it the way that it is he says this is the word don't add to it don't take from it amen amen it's amazing what we think although as long as I believe this but yet the devil wants you to believe it this way and believe it that way believe it this way and so on he's gonna add to it or you take away from it and I tell you he's taken away a lot he's taken away a lot from a lot of believers amen because they're not do not like to used to be no way the prophet of God was acknowledging it himself regarded regarding grace and God he got at the faith and and they weren't they weren't into the word like the you it were were a man even bound time and echo you know he was recognizing that they were they were getting cold and just saying after he preached church order just a soldier after he plays charge shorter there was a lot left BAM Tabernacle so did they recognize a prophet did they recognize the grace of God in the going for the word that no that you'd see that they wouldn't take that any man see it was all intellectual but it wasn't personal a may they never took it in a very personal way they never applied it to their own Arts in their own soul that ever applied it to their own age and sale or does that mean forgive me Amen Lord I'll follow your leadership I won't say anything unless I'm absolutely sure that it's the Holy Ghost in my soul it's not my aim at night mind my emotions and so on and again and we know why he preached church order it because there was a boss and anyone's there and as our brother Neville when he winning when he took brother Manuel and sister man you had to suffer in jeffersonville way back many many many years ago and he said to brother Manuel he said brother Manuel II said do you know why the prophet of God preached search order and the probably well the brother Manuel thought wow no I don't know exactly why I just assumed he said he just wanted to set everything in order he said that bad because the certain of the brothers and sisters weren't doing it you know exactly where God wanted done he said no brother he said lot of a lot of what was going on in Brown Tabernacle he said before this before he came to the pull of the preach he said with false anointed ones amen and he said that's why the Father God said when I come to the gifts he's this way he said now he says you got to meet before the service starts he said meet there in the room and he said if there's a gift let God give it and he said let there be other brothers here to judge it and if they feel it's the Lord he said they can write it down and bring it to the pulpit and we'll read it amen that's what the public got said and I rather never did expound it - herb - - brother Manuel that it was because of the false anointing in Brown Tabernacle a man and went in and he said don't do this you know because oh my Manny and he stopped the testimony meetings and I knew that and I even told him in in in central are you gonna stop this I said the prophet of God stop is you're going to stop it because they tell you they had they had long song services and they and they had testimony means as I said brothers were to get up there to testify and instead of testifying they preached that is the truth eyewitness said I snorted this and this shouldn't be and so on and I was just a young man and I went to the bathroom you're gonna stop that and eventually they did stop it amen they stopped testing my means and Benham tyrannical and and then they stopped the the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit tongues and interpretation and Brava see they they stop that inbound Tabernacle hey man why because there was too many false anointed ones Amen God was my grace coming out to minister the word through his servant the prophet a man a man the evidence went from Sonny's and wonders to grace they ever going from the gifts to the revelation of the word by grace a man that's what it was to put the emphasis on the word and to apply the word in a personal way a man but how many as applying it personally how many are judging themselves personally Lord you know you read something and you know my it's very easy to read something and and oh that's brother soul soul and sisters own soul and condemned condemned your brother's sister how many apply to their own lives not many that's great brother that's right they're there to hear the word and they'll judge judge judge everybody else but they won't judge themselves brother you're gonna Eve got you're gonna be accepted in the presence of God you got judge yourself first anybody that you've got to line up with the word you got to apply it to your life it's not a plan to that brother sister explained to you hey man remember us what God seeks want wants you to do you got to be born again ain't man a new birth and you're born again then it's Christ in you a man and you're not living just because I got this thought I got that thought you're living out of your heart as I said brother when I look back and consider all that the Lord caused me to get trained in and experiencing this experiencing that Lord is you cuz people thought well listen you you've got this education you can do this why don't you do this when you do that as well as whatever the Lord wants it's like I said when I when I ended up the you know as management in in in a retail store and ended up as as the overseer of the entire shopping mall and so on and and one and one day I was in the office there and a young man a young young man then and he came in and he said oh excuse me he said got a question and and I said yes sir I said what is it he was the janitor and in the store I got a question he said he said what grade do you ever I understand you do you didn't you didn't graduate he's from our life school Austin no I said I just got an A grade 9 diploma well he said how come he says you've got a grade nine diploma and he said I got a grade 11 diploma Annie and he's not only that he had special special report there because he was so smart and he said I got that and I'll come he said you're sitting behind the desk ISA Donna and I said I'm out there AE so using the broom man and a mop I said well I said you ask the Lord I said when he tells you let me know amen I said I says just the grace of God amen that's right brother sister it was the grace of God it wasn't what I was looking for it was the grace of God amen because when he meant God Elvis that in all circumstances in all situations brother you don't do nothing as Jesus in you a man a man I don't care what your job is your your thinking Jesus thoughts and your you're a man you're gonna you're going to get counsel to consult anyone you're going to consult Jesus first amen help me Lord showed me reveal to me what your will is father in all of this any man that I'll do it for your glory your honor a man and that's why they they they would come and say welcome you can do this and one young man there one time he was in training and he was in University and and he was on the job training and so on and he and he was going here and going there to this store that store and a finally one he was in a store that I was in and he said oh he said he's like question asked he still called me said you're in management and he said and he says you only had a grade nine he said any and he said he said I I've graduated from high school he so I'm graduating from University and he so I don't know what job to get I don't know if I can do this knew that he said I said well I say this in my life it's just the grace of God amen give the glory to Jesus amen give the preeminence II don't boast in yourself no I can do this and I can do that you can do nothing without him amen we do all things through Christ by the grace of God and it is they see grace again some but the thing of it is will highlight this revelation that revelation this doctrine that doctrine what we need to highlight Greece we need knowledge grace even listen and let grace and it's affecting our lives the Grace and the desire to thing in our souls amen why why the divine law project grace God had a reason as I said his plan his purpose in this pattern and there was a divine reason that God projects grace and grace was to Humble us anybody sort of get you to look home but you're down looking up and he's gonna lift you up amen he'll exalt you by the grace of God everybody that's why there's a that's why he had to come to David and he did and and he brought David down because and and he permitted it he allowed it to Humble David a man and oh yeah not just for David's sake but for your sake in mind ain't no answer we would know that scripture a man by the grace of God that I was conceived in sin Lord take not don't take your spirit from me a man a married Lord don't take that anointing from us in this hour Lord don't take that day that's mere the resurrection and the spirit of the Raptors our rivers Lord we need it in this hour that's the only way out there is no other way out of this world that we are in this crazy well is the resurrection rapture it was a crazy world in Jesus day but you know what you know what I've set Jesus a lot o it was thus in this scene that's in yeah but what really upset Jesus and he questioned at a number of times was the lack of faith and that's the lack of grace acknowledged in their lives he saw ye of little faith where's your faith where's your faith where's your faith he rebuked them for a lack of faith he forgive them for a lack of faith and that's that's what that's what caused Jesus to grieve and the mourn he wanted to get out he get out and he'll do this you'll do that and he come back everybody with the anointing and he would give them faith grace through faith hey man oh yeah constantly oh why couldn't your decide was it is because of lack of faith where's your faith where's your faith and he said to that woman that touch the board of His garment he didn't say he healed her he said your faith has made you whole a man but that was the grace of God in her life she recognized the Messiah she recognized the a the the the Alpha Ministry of God in flesh she said if I can but touch the border of His garment not touch him touch the borders girl war he says your faith has saved you your faith has healed you're healed a man and knowing that just all brother you talk about grace when that woman come and and she wanted Jesus pray for a daughter that was dying and sick and so on and he said I can't take the bread he said and give it to dogs what dogs seek it personal bring out a very personal relationship any man they get that woman to be personal a man with what was the word that he was preaching with the word and the testimony that he gave her Oh oh no no I can't take this bread that is for the children and give it to the dogs but I brought it with the grace of God brought out her faith hallelujah it is by grace through faith and grace did this and grace said that and it brought out her faith and God by grace will say this Neal preach this here preach this and he'll bring out that person's faith amen as I said there are those that that we had leave the church and there was at one time there was a couple in this is 70 years and years and years ago amen and I preached and preached to preach to price and and the finally I learned later they said all that brother was mad with you I said what oh yes they said we had to drive around the city a number of times telly telly calm down I said why all because of what you're preaching he was mad he was upset why because maybe God was getting personal with them amen God was dealing personally with his attitude and his spirit amen and he wasn't the only one there was do a number of others as well and they and they don't want that as I said they want to go here and go there and they can write among the trees of the garden amen and it's not not acknowledging grace amen no no they just want did you want to avoid God's judgment they don't want to take it personal and apply it to their lives in a personal way it's just doctrine that we believe this is this is our doctrine this is what we believe they man no no it's the life you live anybody if you've got it the way that God was sure to get it if you got it the way the Holy Ghost wants to make you one with it you're gonna go a minute you can't help it it'll be automatic it'll be automatic a good to live automatically you live the life automatically you say the right thing automatically you do the right thing now the devil is going to be there in your flesh you're gonna fight the flesh oh yeah you're gonna fight the thoughts of your mind and the instinct is your flesh oh I don't think God wants this I don't think God wants that you wait a minute and see the will of God yeah like I said I I've had a load job of just going out and getting shopping carts and taking them into a store and I went from there maybe to a janitor just keep I'll be I'll be the clean up clean a store and so on and doing this and do that and do this and I guess they're doing cooking and so on oh yeah it's the grace of God now I'll be honest brother-sister I have to be honest concerning the grace of God I'm a sinner saved by grace you are sinners saved by grace it's when you consider your own attitudes your own spirit your own motives your own objectives anybody Brotherton you got acknowledged over Lord thank God for grace Lord if it wasn't for your grace I wouldn't be saved whether your grace III would make it and it is not for your grace Lord I won't make it into the resurrection rapture lord your grace help me to surrender to what - your grace amen and so that Lord's run into your grace is your grace is gonna give me the faith that'll please you and I'll go out and I'll be that faith amen it'll be God revealed in flesh in your flesh not Elvis brother please don't go out with self-righteous attitudes and and you're gonna do it for yourself your whether it's not me that lives as Christ lives in me are you when you went after you leave here when you go out when you go home when you go to school when you go to work is it Christ living in you is it Christ doing this in your house is Christ doing that it's the Christ doing it what are you going to get preeminence to Jesus challenge the faith listen how many gonna do like those disciples did they left her father in the ship of Madonna follow Jesus huh you think they would have took so many days you know and to cut this off and do this and they have to change their families and all that no they just left and went on and one point there Jesus said oh follow me yes I got nowhere to lay my head they would have nowhere to lay there is how many is gonna follow Jesus with that revelation now see Jesus made it personal and Jesus what did Jesus say to the others and some other disciples what all personal you never call them they were following the leadership of the Holy Ghost and they followed him amen and Jesus turned around to some others this I was there and he said come follow me and they said well suffer me first to go back and bury my father oh the other one he said oh let me go back and and and bid farewell to my family and ain't no no he didn't agree with it if you're gonna come come now hey man cut it off now come down and he intro to that one don't want to go back and bears why he's let the dead bury the dead a man got Elvis brother but Jesus Christ first in your life a man brothers sister I pray God we're not living for not living with us oh well we're living for Jesus when I live in for this whole world and your job and your education we're living for the resurrection the rapture hey man so that will a man God give us the revelation old brother we ought to be there now concerning what's going on in the world we ought to be there probably what I am no more in the world and considering and again I believe brother mark reference the the attack on the mosque in New Zealand 49 killed and it's still in to the news still there and now it's bringing it's bringing those religions and Christianity together it's bringing Protestantism and Catholicism together oh yeah it is they're getting together and they're doing this to doing that oh yeah all uniting in one church and not only that they're aiming in church has been open to the Muslims to come and worship yeah and maybe this church is open to this and this districts will win today brother it is finished I pray God listen again he comes as a thief in the night but again you're a child of the day not of the night you're gonna recognize it please I pray God you don't find no joy in this whole world when it comes to the natural life that your joy and your peace and your rejoicing everything is in your spiritually amen but yet there's so many without the Holy Ghost without the grace of God without the faith that pleases God during living for this whole world they want they want all I want to do this I want to do this I want the best I can get in this world no Jesus didn't the best we can get is in the world to come god help us brother it's the grace of God bear with me and this is not the message on Grace and the message of grace was preached in 1961 in Jeffersonville we'll get to it maybe in another service but I want to share these thoughts with you this was in the message desperation if you apply the message as we were ministering on convinced and concerned if you are personally convinced you are personally concerned but not wouldn't the natural things of life but with the spiritual with what God is doing hey man that's what Joel Joel was was persuaded up he said the Lord giveth the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord but he still wanted to understand why God permitted what he permitted why God allowed what he allowed why God was to let the devil do this but the devil do that amen Joel better revelation that there was a divine purpose and reason behind it do we have that revelation all we think well if it's God we don't have to worry with this we don't have to worry about that listen oh my god did with Joel in a very personal way God dealt with the prophets in a very personal way God dealt with it his apostles in a very personal way and all down through the ages very personal amen the grace of God amen who was it that I was referring to joke very personal see I pray God you recognize that no don't don't just go back and read it as a history book no no read it as as God's God talking to you God showing you this God showing you that and and Joel's wife all she said that once you curse God and die go commit suicide it's because a foolish woman didn't say she was but she spoke like one amen no he wanted to he wanted to be God and God amen amen and God sent this comforter that comforter I preached on some years ago the four approaches to the message I preached on I believe might have been on Empire Avenue the four approaches to the message you know and it was this comforter that comforter another comforter three of them and then there was then there was the fourth that represented Jesus hallelujah well it wasn't the first one the second or the third it was the fourth that brought job into the prayer into the presence of God amen a man and and God dealt with Joel in a very personal way and he was dealing with his faith others were dealing with job's works but God was dealing with jobs paid a man he was challenging Joel's faith job was getting personal with Joe God's getting personal with you a man as the Bride of Christ are you personal with God amen so Joe and after after that job's got quiet praise the Lord you've got to do anything you you saw that your mouth yeah North oh there goes me but for the grace of God like drug the angel silence brother branham when he was condemning that woman and so on and you come here and he showed brother Bram his own sin that's right praise the Lord and the father of God is added to change toward that other person I've got our attitude when we recognize we're saved by grace God and God like God was revealing the Joel amen Joel this where were you where were you where were you when I did this where were you when I did that Joubert recognized them indeed that he was a sinner saved by grace anybody that what he knew he knew only by the grace of God a man and when and when when they all the others went to offer their sacrifices to God God went and told him he said go get Joel to pray for you a man got Joel bet humbled himself God's grace to us I'll tell you really if if just if there's any attribute of the bride in this last hour is humility why because she got the revelation of grace grace unmerited favor humbles you when you got the understanding of it in he referred to Jesus and this message right here desperation he said Jesus went a little further and he said if Jesus went a little further he said how much more ought we to go a little further amen when we recognize the are we living do we really believe in the rapture god help us yeah how much more on we tickle a little further and notice the scripture says here in Luke that he prayed earnestly brother sister if Jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly amen and if Christ the God of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly that how much more are we he says sinners saved by grace pray earnestly amen if the decision showed the son of God into despair he said what will it do to you and I he said desperately we must cry it's unfortunate that too many are lacking the revelation of grace amen too many are lacking the revelation of the atmosphere we're living in and the conditions that we're dealing with everything the weakness of the flesh if you recognize it you got the revelation of it you're gonna be desperate to get out of it amen straight places I told you this is grace all grace all grace right to the end don't think you're going to earn yourself in your flesh is gonna be righteous no no where we can get rid of this old flesh Lord let it be cursed it is cursed any man but he promises a body like his glorified body is anything you want to get out of is his old flesh that the mind that was in Christ being you so you're going to think like him not like the devil god help us he said God in these last days has manifested himself so to us by His great signs and power should make us desperate and he said that's right and is willing to heal us save us ought to throw sin to all in the desperation easier to get that healing stone amen desperation where those seekers me with all the heart then I will hear thee amen that grace have control so that you're gonna seek him with all your heart if there's grace in control of your heart your soul your spirit you're gonna seek him with your heart not your head as I said there's there's an anointing does this something in the heart I can't explain it to explain that you'd be able to explain God but since you can't explain God he said my ways are so high above the heavens and in your ways and my words and my thoughts and so on not only explain God that's like if you got an experience oh my there's something on the inside it's like I asked brother BAM buddy you know when he was almost blind yeah his eyes were bad and he was walking and jesus healed him he was praying as he walked just as a boy a young boy and his sight came back and they said brother madami said you believe your your your you're gonna stay your eyes are gonna stay normal oh yes he said he saw I'm healed and he said isn't I'm not gonna believe any devil that held me otherwise he said believe God period amen he said not going to doubt not gonna question it he said I've accepted it he said I go on accept it that's I'm healed that's right grace desperation ISA when thou seekest me with all thy heart then I will hear you and I just who thought or something happened Laura I need you now you just need me now or do you need me all the time we need him all the time yeah the devil is there all the time we need God all the time so you got to plead the token life of the blood of Jesus against the devil he said see the law and the province were under John and since then the Kingdom of Heaven has been preached and man pressed into it and if you just don't just stand around and say pick me up by the collar Lord and push me in he said you press into it you get desperate between life and death there's a lot of people waiting on God God's waiting on you what for press into it how many believers are pressing into the kingdom and the believers are pressing into the resurrection in the rapture not many there's just way all God's gonna do it sometimes there'll be a resurrection sometimes yeah yeah no no you are the resurrection you are the rapture I am what aren't you one with Christ Christ that I am the resurrection rapture and the fullness of the Godhead Bobby is in the bride the bride is the resurrection rapture praise the Lord fullness of the Godhead body in the breakroom now he's in the bride so she's the resurrection rapture we brothers sister we need starts believe in the word we need to say yeah really applying the word personally in our lives let's apply the resurrection and the rapture power anointing in our lives we as I said before we have been resurrected and we are being resurrected and raptured like I and I let me say it again I don't never forget it when I preached that to that to that church and they got away quiet you had 300 people nobody responded when I told him I was resurrected and I was raptured didn't respond don't got me quiet and even as I said even the passion was looking back at him he was quiet until I told him the patience I've been quickened resurrected spiritually in my soul and I said and I've been raptured up doing every place in Christ when they got it that changed changed the atmosphere and it got noisy a man a man God gave them the revelation god help us to get into a very personal relationship with the resurrection very personal with the rapture amen it's not this one is not that one it's not just Jesus it's Jesus Christ in me now it's me now they were looking for the change in Jesus the resurrection in Jesus now Jesus is looking for the resurrection and rapture in the bright praise the Lord thank God brother I find such a lack of desperation everybody's desperate for the natural things of life but they're not desperate for the spiritual how many are really desperate for the resurrection and the rapture Jesus was desperate to get out of this world how many artists like him desperate to get out of this whole world why because he wants to judge it he's going to burn it with fire he's going to create a new heaven and new earth he's he's enduring it for 6,000 years and one day with the Lord as those thousand years a thousand years is one day a man now we're going into eternity by the grace of God people are desperate for the natural things of life but they're not desperate for the spiritual there are very very few that are desperate for the spiritual things of life I'll finish with a couple of quotes in the message how can I overcome he said overcome means to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks and he said lots of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there is a real devil and he's just as real as you are anybody he said a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know that he's a devil and he said then the same time you recognize him and know that is the devil and he is against you thought word indeed he's against you then he said to overcome you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than II is the one that is in you has already overcome the devil and it is by is grace you are more than a match for Satan amen he said there's there a real overcoming it is by grace I pray you got that grace in your life that you recognize Satan won't deceive you you you're gonna be more wiser than Satan that's right God's gonna reveal this to you and you got power over Satan amen grace brother that's grace if you really got grace in your life grace is there oh I'm redeemed Jesus died to save me and so on yeah he died to save you but he died to get in you he rose again to get in you amen he rose again to share is his resurrection with you and he rose again to share his rapture with you okay well what a rapture you mean tell me I'm raptured yes you are well what's the evidence the word has been revealed the prophet of God said what's going on in heavenly places in Christ he said the word is being revealed amen and it being revealed in your heart not your head he's to remember greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world that he's in you in your heart in your soul grace thank God just consider your life and that God is in you that Jesus is in you amen the resurrected Lord is healing and I knew you giving you the revelation of the resurrection the faith for resurrection of faith for the rapture the faith to get out of this world and with him wonderful he's the greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world he said you must recognize that the Holy Spirit that is in you has already overcome this thing and he is in you and you can overcome by him he said that's exactly sensible amen let's believe God hidden and revealed in simplicity it's very simple and and it's so simple God is asking us believe us though this it's not God doesn't make it complicated you got believers that are that they're taking the message and taking the word and taking this and they're making it complicated and Oh bigger that's a prophecy to make it bigger than what it is some make it smaller than what it is and but God is it in simplicity what got what he said he was going to do he's gonna do how he was gonna do it he's gonna do it it's simple I want I like some of us we know concerning certain of the Brethren over there who believe this and believe that and be something else yet profess to be believers but yet what are they doing they're taking the message and they're making this thought there and that thought there or the scripture or even the scripture and they're making it bigger than what it is and they're adding to it or they're taking away from it and making a smaller than what it is it's not scriptural because it's buries what God started and what God is going is doing and what God is going to do is simple it's very simple we understand it and it's going to end God is gonna do it by using us and working through us and it's well he's fulfilling his word people want to make it brother the mysteries have been have been revealed God has come down and he's been made simple what he's going to do but there are they're there their so-called ministries today online what are they doing they're complicating it and where the angel came down and broke the seals - they're putting the seals back together they are oh yeah what was revealed now they're doing it in such a way so as they're putting it and they're sealing it back again oh it's only for the right yeah no no Jesus was there they could see him they could hear him they could touch him he eat he would drink oh yeah Jesus did this Jesus said that but yeah they never recognized him as Messiah the accuser Mabini devil under the influence of the devil yeah this is absolutely amazing and but it was all simple it was right there and he spoke the word just plain right there he did he didn't make it more complicated he made it more simple and it way it was the simplicity of it they just couldn't accept a man because why because the Jews back then they were looking for a messiah well they didn't believe the Messiah was going to come and redeem them from their sins they were there looking for a messiah to come and redeem them from the control of the Roman nation but they needed a spiritual Redemption first and then God would take them not under control of the Roman nation you take them out of the world by grace so that you're no longer subject to natural you're subject to this the kingdom of God the king of kings and the Lord of lords so brother sister be on your guard don't get caught up with the foolishness of false teachings and false doctrines concerning the message of the hour because you see if I got it here that we're dealing with even in this hour we're dealing with with ministries all around the message we're dealing with false ministries around the messies program that they're they're preaching preaching perverted revelation of the message that's right I know there's a certain country that always professed ibly the message professed ibly the message and yet I saw pictures where they wrote on the streets in the public and William Branham is God we don't abandon wasn't God not the way they're saying or when read him was Jesus Christ or how they're saying this when it's God this one's God no no we're all gods because we're sons and daughters of God amen god help us brother stay in simplicity he promised this he promised that he's doing it yeah simple as I said he promised the resurrection what's the resurrection Oh the Dead coming back to life oh they're gonna come into our body oh there there right there and oh yeah the living Saints are gonna be raptured what do you mean it's like that brother challenged me on an email and he said brother he says you're preaching the rapture and I added on the on our homepage and he said he said that word rapture is not in the Bible so he said I don't believe that I said brother I said what is the word rapture mean I said it means this so I said is that in the Bible I see yes it is and I gave him the scripture and I said also I said let me emphasize this I said the word rapture is English and I said but now I said you don't speak English I said that's not your normal language your language you're born with as you look you're born with this language I said so I said I said what what is the word I said then you would use to translate this I said that which we shall be changed in a in a moment the thinking of and I will caught up with the with the saints of God that word that died in Christ so I saw brother apply the word in your language apply the word in the English language and I said it'll all come back to the scripture that we're gonna be cut off raptured and as the rapture means cut off so I said tell me those words in your language and I said would I believe it because it's in your language I said brother get the revelation of it and I said it's God in simplicity amen I said he did it 2,000 years ago and now he's gonna do it again hey man brother god help us and again you know why there's so many gonna miss it it's because it's simple and they missed the simplicity know what God is doing when he said he comes as a thief in the night that simple that's very simple we know what that means and a man that's in Christ and knows that he's overcome the things of the world he said it has no more ties to you at all you're free oh I pray God that's you and me by grace we're free from the influence of the world do what you got to do and move on and he said walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin we have fellowship one with another forever see we have fellowship one with another forever and yet there's a lot of believers don't fellowship with nobody only in church thought Elvis grace we have fellowship one with another for every sit and I got a scripture reference there in Isaiah 43 he said now he said I feel like shouting shouting Christian and he said it overcome everything and was over comer and reflected the beauty and the glory of God and he said that's the way every believer does that's the way Noah did that's the way lot did that's the way Moses did Joshua Daniel Shadrach Meshach and he said John the Baptist Zacharias Elizabeth and Simon he said that's the way you're real Christian does a man overcome and reflect the beauty and glory of God that is Grace in your life have you got grace you're an overcomer you got grace you're reflecting the beauty of God in your life amen many are many Christians through the ages and believers there dare to condemn I put this one down put that one down out there in the world no no brother it's grace for me it's grace for them again remind you this is personal and it's the grace of God when God gets personal with you why when he like he's you know whether it were the angel told whether round or God told whether round not to call those young people Ricky's and Rick Addison brother Brown called Ricky's Red Hatters and he criticized them and condemned them dangerous that don't do that he says some of them are my children or as Amy said a woman out there dressed with with this on that on he said is he side criticized the sin but don't criticize her he said he don't know she could be a seed of God oh where are we gonna be surprised who made it and surprised who didn't make it hey man god help us remember all brother I believe this I'd be that yes but we're bright God's require more of the bride then he then he does up the others oh yeah so you'd better leave if they got it an experience with God or there are some faith in God you encourage them live live the the bride life and see if they're going to hunger and thirst for it just even in the fellowship with denominational family every Sunday they drive by here and they go to a certain church just out there oh they they look here to see you Emma knees here they respect us and yet when in conversation with them there they write knowledge they said you know that years ago one of them said they were when they were young that we went to a certain church and even in that church and it wasn't Pentecostal and it wasn't Salvation Army and they say even in that church they said that the people would get up and and shout and praise the Lord and sing and and they said to his one there was one man there he get up and testify and he was praising God and shouting in his testimony and he was taught it was a tall gentleman she said and he'd get up and he's to any stets stand on the seat and then he'd step from one seat to the other one seat to the other and say it praising God and thanking God for saving his soul but and this didn't somebody else would do this somebody else do that or say that but she said there's none of that now no I said I know you find that in very few very it was hardly any churches out there with it yeah oh yeah sister Barnes told me one time she said brother Joe she said I used to go to the-- said the United Church and when she was just a young woman and she said oh my she said we sing and we praise the Lord and she said the anointing were so powerful she said that they had back then it wasn't electricity it was oil lamps they had hanging from the ceiling and she said all mine she should you look up and she said the oil lamps were shaking and moving back and forth she said there was so much power so much anointing is so much shouting and praising God she said in the United Church yeah what would they be doing in the Salvation Army but they were they were doing in the Pentecostal church all brother sister the power of God and what's he doing now in the bright church he's giving us work well we're going beyond that now we're going into the resurrection and the rapture more power more 90 and is absolutely controlling your life it is the grace of God amen grace not just bringing us into the rain into justification sanctification the baptism and the gifts no grace is bringing us into the resurrection and the rapture the climax of it the completion of it by the grace of God amen he said look Jesus showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word and that's how he's done it he was the word and if you abide in me and my words abide in you he said you're back to the word again the word of promise how do I overcome not me but the word that's in me he said the word of God then I overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me and he said listen in the 40 days of temptation by God's Word Jesus overcame and he said Satan made three major assaults upon him in that temptation and he said but he met him with the word amen thus saith the Lord it is written now here's a good thing sometimes Satan can take you and when you think you're doing the will of God he said you can make a proposition and he says you'll fall for it yes sir and he said now let's just take for instance like our sister and he said they're pretty and he can get you to a place that you let your hair grow out and you didn't realize it looks so nice on you and the first thing you know easy to get to a feeling a little stuck up a little above something else some of you may and he said you want you know what I mean and he could take the same thing proposition it with you and he said that's right you got to go you got to overcome that just remember you're living for God you have objective and that's Jesus Christ outside of that there's nothing else counts except him and secondly for your family thirdly for yourself the first for God the next for your family the next for you you are number three that's the end of the road you put yourself class amen but he said you want to be like the world you want to be like to your sisters and denominations and he talked about his sister's changing their hairstyles and so on he says you don't want to be like the old no more he said you won't be like your sisters out there in the denomination so god help us brother is my prayer amen I pray more more grace in our lives grace listen grace in control if grace is in control grace is lining you up with the word grace is keeping you in line with the word grace is going to keep you on the straight and narrow amen so let's stay in line by the grace of God amen he said he would be a show-off and now that does it God's servants to be a show-off he said it hits you but you've got to give the glory to God he said Alleluia he said we give the glory to God amen praise the Lord he that overcomes all the worldly things of this age what will they do all was sit with him in his throne and he said and go in the rapture when he comes well he's come and we are moving on in the rapture by the grace of God amen god bless you let's tan we want to bring in more thoughts on grace grace magnified to the extent that grace takes over in Genesis and grace take grace takes over in the book of Revelation it's all Grace and again to leave you with this scripture that he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace grace unto it amen the bride is going into a resurrection of rapture with crying's of grace grace grace and it is brother the only way we're getting the rapture is the grace of God amen don't away we will be delivered out of this world it's the grace of God the only way we'll get victory over Satan in these last days it's the grace of God please just humble ourselves to the grace of God
