amen i was wanting to maybe we're thinking of thinking we were going to have a large congregation here i saw so many cars in the parking lot amen well i guess everybody brought their own car amen well god bless us amen and be in prayer for the going forth of the word amen be in prayer for your servant amen it's it's it's it's been a trip and to me it seems like it's been a long trip you're going out and ministering to well yes we minister to believers make believers unbelievers amen but we thank god for his grace amen his grace is there to encourage us is there just to to give us what we need amen so i thank you for your prayers amen so keep us in prayer and keep sister obedient in prayer as she recovers of course from the trip amen and because when we went uh we also took uh the the cat with us amen so she was dealing with those issues as well in in traveling from here to there to the from one town to another town one one house to another house and so on so uh we thank the lord for your prayers amen that god brought us through it amen but again excuse me there's revelation amen i turn to this but we're living in this world you're experiencing this you're experiencing this and that brother i tell you you're getting more and more and more revelation amen and the revelation that god has given and what god has done becomes more and more real and it's getting more and more serious oh yes definitely every hour that we're supposed to do what the scripture said look up and i'll tell you god's going to allow this to happen that to happen we'll experience this and that and brother the end result that god's looking for are you looking up amen your faith is going to look up amen because you know that what you what you need and what you want what god wants you to have brother is is not as a worry here but it's it's look up he wants to almost catch us up into a greater revelation catches up into a greater amen hunger and thirst for what he wants to do and not only that what he's doing amen so we've been we know that there's somebody angry and thirsting for what god's doing amen most definitely but i just trust by the grace of god that it's us amen that you're hungering that you're thirsting that it's just not religion i'm doing this and i'm doing this i go here and all mine and i'm experiencing that more and more and more that the people got religion but they're not spiritual amen very religious why again as i let me emphasize what the prophet said you're in the message but the message is not in you amen because if the message is in us we'll be spiritual if the message is in us we're going to focus mainly morning noon and night on the word of god and on the promise of god amen what god has promised amen and again all we thank them for you what you did lord yes that's good my son but what am i doing amen are you into what i'm doing oh yes there's too many into what god has done but how many are into what god's doing how many are really angry and thirsting for well what is it the resurrection only and thirsting for the rapture amen because there's any anything that god wants wants to see in you and me now it's the hunger and thirst to get out of here amen oh yes but i find that too many too many so-called christians too many so-called believers are too content with this whole world amen oh you're satisfied i'll do this i'll do this i'm doing this and i'm doing that what are you doing for god amen brother i tell you this what does god want us to do god wants us to be hungry and thirsting to get out of here he wants us to be hungry amen why because that's just the same as israel and egypt god came the most he said i have heard the cries of my people amen i have come down to deliver them brother that's why god has been been waiting on all down through the years in every age they cried for luther cried for justification others cried for this others cried for that what are we crying for amen what are we looking up for oh i trust brother it controls our lives amen morning noon and night we just can't get away from it we love the lord the lord loves us we love his word his promise we can't get away from it amen that's why that worked constantly oh my lord uh i'm looking for brother so-and-so i'm looking for citrus so and so brother lord that they're over there in that dimension they're waiting on us and lord you're waiting on us please don't let us keep you waiting too long amen and i tell you god don't want us to keep him waiting amen god's grace that we're we're going to what god wants us to do we're doing what god wants us to believe we're believing amen by the grace of almighty god pressing on the upward way brother amen and i tell you as we go on and on and on the resurrection ought to become more and more real to us the rapture more and more real to us even as we have highlighted others in times past concerning wesley and and and martin luther oh brother sister they they had such an hunger oh brother if you could only read what what they were what they went through what luther went through what wesley went through what the early pentecostals were going through oh they were hungry now they were thirsting for god for god lord we love you lord we want your power we want your anointing amen you got remember god the prophet said god sends the holy ghost ahead he said to create in us a hunger and a thirst he said for what god wants to do amen that's why he created it what we are that's the proof in luther are you hungry and thirsted for justification the other is ongoing thirst thirst the first sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen there was a hunger for it a thirst for it a power anointing amen responding that anger and thirst oh i've experienced it in in in the early pentecostal ages and so on by the grace of almighty god but brothers are known now that we've gone on and to our greater revelation of god amen and not only the judgment we thank god for what he's done but brother we don't have to hunger for that now because it's done that's right what god did in luther wesley pentecostal thank god you did it lord amen but what is it what was left what do we want now do we oh i i want justification sanctification oh yeah lord the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit thank you jesus oh we think that's it no no that's pressing us on oh my oh my oh my they were putting the emphasis on that what god was doing brother but what are we putting the emphasis on what are we hungry for what are we thirsting for what are we calling for what are we praying for what are we living for amen that's the brothers too many believers just living for themselves there are too many so-called christians just living for this old world they're going to do this they're going to do that but how many really are hungering thirsting calling crying lord the resurrection we want to come home we want to come home brother you got the baptism of the holy ghost you got a revelation of where you come from while you're here and where you're going i tell you this you're crying to get out of here amen you're not content brother and because you're going to oh well this one this one family friends neighbors leave it with the lord and move on amen amen because your greater relationship is with jesus your greater relationship is with the sons and daughters of god amen brother for the emphasis on the spiritual not on the natural amen you leave the natural in the hands of god by the grace of god amen so brother help us that we're going to move on brother there was a generation that came out of egypt and brother they died in the wilderness oh yeah why because they took them up to the promised land and they refused it amen amen where was their faith oh their faith here to come out to believe moses do this do this do that oh yeah well oh yeah but then god come down to make their faith very personal oh yeah not just moses not just joshua not just caleb not just this one of them oh no it was them but they went up went in looked around oh again they were look it was all natural well we can't do this we can't do that but joshua tried to encourage him with the word if god before us who can be against us amen joshua caleb encouraging them that god had given them the victory this is your land he said you're yours go get it no they did they didn't want that and the same this generation god do this god do that god do that brother god has given us the word to give us the faith to do it amen praise the name of the lord brother it's not again that's why god is waiting on us for the resurrection waiting on us for the rapture way amen brother god gave us the faith of the resurrection the faith of the rapture or again oh my lord my lord as our brother jonathan mentioned in his prayer it is finished it is finished brother now that was that was the bridegroom now it's the bride the alpha ministry now the omega ministry praise the lord it is finished amen how many believers finished if they believe it they're really looking out for the resurrection rapture their lives will reflect what they're living for amen oh your testimony is going to be for what god is doing praise the lord hallelujah as luther emphasized oh praise the lord in his testimony witnessing your round of family friends neighbors everywhere oh i'm justified i'm justified i'm justified oh yeah and the church was going to kill him oh yeah because he was putting the emphasis on this not on not on the church not on this and on this religion and so on no brother's the same thing with the bride we're not putting the emphasis on churches not putting themselves on amen on just intellectual doctrine but on the spiritual revelation what god is doing in you and me brother if he's given us any revelation oh yeah justification sanctification yes but he's also given us the revelation that we are the resurrection and the rapture amen amen jesus in luther justified him jesus amen in wesley sanctified him in the pentecostals baptizing with the holy ghost and they experienced god in the gifts but now we got that plus amen now it's the resurrection rapture praise the name of the lord amen as i said that morning noon and night they they dwelt on what god had done and what god was doing in their hearts and souls amen oh yes but brother i pray grace that we're dwelling on what god has done and what god is doing amen and sin in the prophet and the prophet of god highlighted the fact that you know the resurrection was manifested even in his ministry why because these ministers pointing us to the resurrection amen and as he has already said that what god has done what god is doing was to give us rapturing faith oh what god did for luther gave him justification faith you know sanctification faith faith for the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost amen but oh brother praise god but now he's coming more and more and more flesh in you and me taking control why because now it's not just to justify it not just to sanctify us amen not just to give us the experience oh hallelujah bring us into a oneness with god yes yet by the baptism of the holy ghost to what for the resurrection amen you've got to recognize that one this is jesus that i am my father our what amen we've got to recognize that one is with jesus that one is with his word amen and the word was made flesh and the word is made flesh the prophet has highlighted it he said that was that was the word made flesh then to redeem us now the word is made flesh to redeem us again as i said spiritually no physically we're going to be changed god help us amen to believe not religion but to believe what god has done and to believe what god is doing amen brother it's going to influence our lives it's going to influence our actions influence our reactions by the grace of almighty god amen brother is your life reflecting such faith amen are you living that kind of a life amen oh i'm a stranger here what what's going on over there i i i can't i want to get home lord i'm more i'm more used to your your things your word and your what you do how you do it when you do it where are you doing lord but i i i just want to ignore what's going on there get it behind me satan amen that's right praise the lord god god's grace to us lord grace to you and me that wonder is control amen not the devil's control amen oh yeah because even even those who are very religious even run the message they're under satan's influence oh yeah they can talk message but what will walk it you're under talking message oh we believe this we believe that thank you lord what you did yeah but you're supposed to be what god is doing yeah amen you're supposed to go there and reflect what god's doing his separation onto his word amen is separation under the promise amen claiming the promise for this hour for this age oh yes brother let's go beyond it i preached it many times before concerning being religious or being spiritual and i've also asked you the question i'll ask you that again uh later this morning concerning who are you who are you and i've i was highlighting the fact going back to the scriptures and showing you the the believer the make-believer the believer the make-believer oh yeah yeah and i said which one are you oh yeah and only that oh this one was religious that one was religious are you adam or eve oh yeah what spirit you got on you what's what's influencing you amen i pray the grace of god that brother we're not being deceived as adam was or not adam but but he oh yeah and like the bible says that adam put himself in sin amen for eve's redemption oh yeah so that adam putting himself in there with eve so that god redeeming adam would redeem her amen as jesus did as god did amen put himself in sin for us amen and of course he redeemed us amen through the death burial and resurrection brother sister it is tremendous let's see amen that's not just going out there intellectually i know god's not a prophet i believe he did this he believed he did that amen but brother is it in you is it controlling you is it controlling your thoughts is it or does it has it giving you the faith that god has ordained for it to give us in these last days amen brother because we know that that faith is going to get less and less and less because people are getting more intellectual less spiritual and that's again that's why he said when the son of man comes will he find faith amen is he finding faith in you this morning amen the faith that he has ordained for us to have in these last days brother by grace are we saved through faith amen amen it's not just grace it's faith amen grace is there to give you the faith that you need amen but think people think of wines i'm saved amen it's the grace of god i say grace grace thank you lord for your grace amen amen god said well what's the proof of your grace my grace in you it is the revelation of the word the revelation of the of the work of god the will of god the word of god amen praise the lord and brother amen if it's truly god's revelation not the devil if it's god's revelation in the scriptures it's going to be exactly according to what god is doing in your day amen amen it's not your job oh yeah i believe god amen i believe i believe there will be a resurrection here well we'll be it's now amen brother jesus wasn't wasn't there just believing that there was going to be that he was going to redeem thee will he will redeem him he will redeem your redeemed it's finished he said it is space brother grace of god to have that faith that our all mind that what what god has required of us here in the earth it is finished brother we're on our way home amen because god has given us the faith we need to get out of time into eternity don't focus on time don't focus on amen the natural things of life let's focus on the spiritual amen lord again and again oh as i said it this is what we we've got to come to that same place jesus came to not my will thine be done amen brother there was god did this and they believed it went on in that revival but again there's there's times when they when they did what they wanted to do it was their will but now it's coming down to absolutely completely the will of god for the bride amen if you want to be part of the bride you're part of the bride you're going in the rapture the resurrection amen not my will father thyme be done amen again that's why the bride is going to be so few left on the earth most will be going on amen because when he comes will he find such faith amen for that bride no there's going to be so little so little so little so little amen amen they're into the church but not into christ amen in the church but not into the word oh and that's the truth brother sister god help us that is the bride of christ we focus on the word jesus was the break room and he focused on the word amen oh yeah he was walking in the word and the word did this the word do that he had to do this the disciples were there to try to stop him no no don't do this don't do that no no no well i got to go to jerusalem no no no we don't want you to go to jerusalem we don't want anybody knew he had to go he knew it was prophesied you know it was in in his word amen for redemption oh lord don't do this don't do that oh wait a minute not my will father thine be done amen it's coming down to that place of total absolute complete separation unto the lord amen separation under what god has done and what god is doing amen well we're to be we're to reflect what god has done and what god is doing praise the lord amen the grace of god be with us brother amen are you reflecting in your life morning noon and night what god is doing amen are you a testimony that god's not dead he's alive forevermore amen do god be the glory amen didn't mean to go on that way believe that with the lord amen but let's continue in the wordless stand amen and saying only believe all things are possible and also just before we go further into it just to just to bring greetings from all the saints that we visited across the island amen it was a constant move and uh of course again it's not a time for relaxation because you're under that pressure to fellowship here fellowship there and so on but all those saints have sent their greetings here to the saints amen appreciating the our the ministry of of uh brother gerald and sister betty the fellowship with them amen and to tell you that brother tom was when we went to visit with him was he was excellent oh yes he was he was sick but at the same time he was still energetic still excellent and he was on his chesterfield there and i sat with him in

and he got it up and he started playing you know he prayed this him and he played at him and sister betty said oh play this he said what he said play this and he and he played that yeah amen god bless brother tom well i knew that that that's where the tom's faith oh it is not knowing brother tom for all these years i knew he had that kind of a faith even though he's in his 80s amen he was still trusting god he was still leaving everything with the lord amen we had a wonderful time of fellowship amen and it was spiritual and he and his daughter there and she said my this is wonderful praise the lord she's first first time she ever experienced such such fellowship first time she ever experienced such such actions and reactions amen and she was so delighted in it all so i pray god bless his daughter amen and of course she's from somewhere up in western canada and i think that she went she left and went back uh earlier this past week here amen but other family members were planning to come down to to just to check on brother tom so we thank god for brother tom's faith and we thank god for blessing our brother tom amen well he did get up he got to the place where he had to go into his bed and lie down for a while amen but he was right there fellowship right there to play his mouth organ you know you know and and the hymns god bless him amen so let's just continue in prayer for

now i believe amen [Music] amen praise the lord [Music] amen lord bless you turn with me again to a scripture that we read i think in the ministry of the word just before we went to central in chap luke chapter 18. news gospel chapter 18 amen praise the lord and to continue with some thoughts concerning end time evangelism praise the lord and verse 1 says and e speak a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect amen which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen to believe what god has done and what god is doing yes pointing to what he will do and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other republican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes to all of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breasts saying god be merciful to me as sinner amen he humbled himself i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalted himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted god bless his words you may be seated amen with me to second corinthians chapter four ii corinthians chapter four and all the men already ministered well i'll try to maybe narrow it down amen the lord bless us and again to say that the saints are sending greetings to all of you the saints we met across the island in central and in western newfoundland they surely wanted us to say hello to everybody and uh they have expressed also a appreciation for our brother jonathan's ministry and they they've been blessed by the going forth of the word amen but also to encourage our brothers our sister there now during the recording that a couple of the saints have expressed that they have failed in the recording it just wasn't coming through right and that brother gerald was men started ministering but eventually i was jumping all around the screen so i don't know what the problem is there but uh i think it was a couple in central in central newfoundland and again our brother and sister in western newfoundland were expressing their concerns and so on so we pray the grace of god that he's going to help us to project it right amen so that they can receive it all because they've they've had to a number of times to shut it down and because it was just wasn't working right so we pray the grace of god it will work right and as i said the times that they did hear it and they did hear our brother jonathan minister it was a blessing to them and so we and we're asked to pass our greetings to our brother jonathan and so on and to thank the lord for his ministry amen so pray the grace of god to us because brother sisters we're in the last time and brother i trust that that none of the hearing of the word or the ministry is going to be you know just religious and oh i thank god it was nice brother it's nice yeah but we got it's got to become a part of us we got to become a part of it amen that we're ministering to you the word and you are the word amen so you can identify with the word praise the lord oh that's me that's what god has ordained for us in these last days that's what god is doing in me that's what god is doing through me in these last days so lord i pray that you'll keep strengthening me and encouraging me with the going forth of the word lord that i'm going to focus more and more and more on what you're doing focus more and more lord on on on the prophecy thus saith the lord for the hour that i'm living that will go forth living the word go forth and walk the word amen not just talk it let's walk it amen so i pray the grace of god to help us amen that brother the back in luther's day they went forward preaching justification wesley went about preaching sanctification and as i said wesley preached so much and he had so many that their the church wasn't big enough to receive everybody so there was a time when when when martin luther or john wesley he would go out into the cemetery amen and and he would stay he would stand up on up on a pulp another pulpit but i stand up on a what i call it yeah the headstones that were in the cemetery he find their stone that he could stand on and he would get up on that headstone and he would preach amen and he certainly wasn't preaching to the dead he was preaching to the to the living saints who were all over the graves everywhere amen by the grace of god amen truly oh my oh my we need a revelation that what that of the reserve resurrection and the rapture by the grace of god amen so i pray grace of god that we're going to focus on what god is doing amen and brother we don't go down just back to luther back to wesley back to the pentecostals amen or even the first and second pool of william branham's ministry brother that's what god did was god doing the third paul amen and when he got into the third pool and the revelation of the word god took them took william branham off the scene amen because it was in the in the latter part in december i believe 1963 it was after going for the word and he preached a few other messages and he said this is another revelation of the of the seals and so on but then it was finished and the lord took him home amen and he said at one point there in 1963 he said here i go back into evangelism but when he reached his 56th birthday in 1965 he knew his time had come god was going to take him and he said here i at and when he celebrated his 56th birthday he said here i stand he said he said see my own end now oh yeah he saw his own end coming and he and god took him home amen because now the prophet was taken off the scene now god was moving on the scene through the ministry amen what for to lay in the word to lay in the revelation what god had done and what god was doing because again the prophet of god did say he said you young ministers back there in 1965 he said you're going to take this message on to the coming of the lord amen he knew that he wasn't going to do it amen but there were there would rise a ministry that would do it amen and he said you're going to dig he said deeper amen into what god had done and what god was doing and now and he and he preached the other revelations and he preached again another revelation of the mystery of god and and he he said himself in that message and he was nearing the end of the message now he said i know he says not striking you the way that it should and he says not striking me he said the way that it should amen why how did he know that because why because it was ordained to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen but that wasn't the hour that they were living in back then and that's why it wasn't striking them that way he knew it was this he knew it was that amen they believed it amen but still god wasn't wasn't making it as it were flesh in them to bring forth the resurrection and rapture no he said it's not striking you and he said it's not striking me easily the way that it should 1965. but brother there's another generation rising that brother this revelation ought to be striking us the way it should amen and the ministry of the word oh yeah thank god for what he did but now god is focusing on what he's doing amen oh yeah the revelation was back there in the ministry of malachi 4 in the first poll second book third paul amen but now there is there's been a ministry ongoing and brother and when really did it start when it comes to getting into the word when it comes to getting into the message not not just preaching the message preaching the message no it's to get into the message and to get the faith that god wants us to have and brother when did it start as far as i know and looking back over over time and not over the years it was around 1971 amen around there that god began to get the ministry into the word amen not just preaching god has sent a prophet god has sent a prophet and brother for years and years and years that that was the basically the ministry to the bride that was basically the ministry around the world amen god has sent a prophet god has sent a prophet amen but then in 1971 amen the ministry began to change from the prophet to the message amen thank god for the prophet but now let's get into the message that the prophet brought us amen amen why because we need it now to give us the faith that pleases god praise the name of the sea god i'll praise the lord god does it his way brother it's not your way not my way and there's too many that got into the message oh yeah thank god for the message thank god for the message amen praise the lord brought us out of denominations as i said one time as i was praying in a church and there was another believer kneeling down at the altar next to me and then oh lord thank you thank you for the message thank you for bringing us out of denominations and now we don't have to be under any man anymore oh i said lord i said they need a revelation amen because your brother your brother's life went under those ministries and you brought us under the ministry of the bride and then again there was the questions and answers in the seals does the bride have a ministry and the prophet of god said yes yes and he said it's been in the bride he said right from the beginning amen and he says the five full ministry oh he said that in the seals yes he did because they asked the question in the seals and he answered it amen so brothers said amen and yet there's too many believers on mine they're doing this they're doing that to run their own way doing their own thing amen not subject to any ministry not recognizing any ministry brother sister amen without the ministry you're going to make it without the minister you're not going to get the word that is ordained to give us the faith that god wants us to have and then again there's too many believers that are doing their own thing amen doing it their own way oh i'm a believer oh yeah but again oh praise the lord it comes right back again to what the prophet said you're in the message the message is not in you amen brother they're in the message oh yeah i'm in the message and and i'm not in denomination no more we're at a denomination yeah but now they become a denomination amen they are oh yes most of it they get a denominational spirit a denominational attitude they are themselves a denomination they act like it and they talk like it they walk like it amen that's the life they're reflecting is the denominational life oh yeah amen brother god brought us out to bring us in amen to his presence amen god brought us out so so he's going to take control amen of our not controlled by the church we're controlled by jesus amen and now you're controlled by jesus through the ministry of the word amen and the father god said he said this is god's judgment seat right here amen oyster the the the pulpit is this is the hour of judgment this is the time of judgment this is the place of judgment god is judging us by the word amen you're going for the word amen he's bringing out what you are yes amen are you bright if he is he's going to bring it out you keep amen how he sees your reaction to the word amen amen he knows your attitude to the word amen what are you giving preeminence to amen oh oh i'm a believer so i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that yes brother sister but ebony is really there to feed on the word how many are coming to church and going to church and sit under a ministry amen said lord please i pray in the name of jesus you're going to reveal and minister to us what i need today amen what i need to bring me into a greater separation to you amen what i need to have to have a faith that pleases god amen what i need lord what for to have the faith whereby i'm saved amen by grace are ye saved through faith amen sorry are you do you have the faith whereby that god is saving you oh yeah it was luther wesley amen pentecostals amen now the bride amen he's given us the faith that's going to save us what is what is what's going to be the salvation that we were experiencing the resurrection and the rapture amen praise the name of the lord and luther went on living to justify life thank god thank god thank god he amen he was rejoicing in the revelation of god the revelation of god all down through but now brother praise the lord all praise the lord the prophets in the old testament they rejoiced in the revelation of god the revelation of god unto finally the revelation was made flesh in jesus amen god was made flesh and jesus he wasn't just reflecting himself revealed himself there oh yeah i reveal her his word amen no no he revealed himself amen not just his word and his will for that hour for that age amen no now is christ himself amen the word made flesh amen the word was made flesh as i said for the for the redemption of our souls now the word is made flesh for the redemption of our bodies oh god help us that we have the faith brother sister that we have concerning jesus coming 2000 years ago and oh lord you did this you do that thank you for saving me lord well praise the lord look what he's doing can we say thank you jesus for rapturing us thank you jesus hallelujah for resurrecting us amen and yes lord we're getting closer and closer and closer to the saints that are gone on amen lord the prophet told us you're waiting on us but the prophet told us the dead and christ are waiting on us amen no doubt lazarus was waiting on jesus amen to say lazarus come birth amen praise the lord oh brother sister i tell you are you hungry and thirsty for the saints are gone on oh how many would have loved to have that fellowship spiritual but today's fellowship most most fellows of today is religious but it's not spiritual no amen what do you mean what's the difference between being religious and spirit well religious it's just in your head and you and you you both of you can identify with this message with this doctrine that doctrine and so on oh yeah it's wonderful isn't it no but what's it doing in you what what's uh uh what of what effect does it have in you you know is it increasing your faith is it making you more spiritual you know is it bringing you more into a in a greater relationship with jesus or is it just william branham oh or is it just this ministry that ministry no brother sister it's got to be jesus amen the word in flesh is jesus that's our that's they had to believe that 2000 years ago amen he said i got power he said lay it down pick it up his life what so brother he's given us the power to pick it up amen to lay it down physically pick it up spiritually and go into a glorified body praise praise the lord oh god help us to see what god is doing god help us to be a part of what god is doing god help us lord to realize that we're letting go of this old flesh we're going to lay it down and we're going to pick up a glorified body amen and we brother we need it but i'll realize it to you to many again it's only a doctrine to many it's only theology to too many it's just religion oh yeah the the lutheran they had this and they the other said that the other said that oh we got this thank you lord yeah but now god wants to make it flesh in you oh yeah he made it flesh in luther concerning justification and the pentecostals the gifts the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts amen oh yeah he was there so what's he doing in you and me amen i trusted that we are justified that we are sanctified that we are baptized with the holy ghost oh yeah we got access to the gifts it's there lord please the lord thank you jesus you did this thank you lord amen and you've got the power to go and do this got the power to go and do that trusting the lord now but amen don't get so caught up with this that you forget the next the rapture now i tell you there's so many believers that are caught up with doctrine theology amen and they feel oh uh god brought us out of denominations so that's it we don't have to worry now we're we're not we're not in denominations but you've got to come out of denominations and get into christ amen and christ in you and actually this there's a lot of believers that are having denominations but they're not in jesus and jesus really is not in them no no i know that by the way the life they live i know that by by the attitude they have amen and what they're putting emphasis on in this old life i tell you if you really got it in you you you are you're in the word the word is in you i you you're you're not you've got nothing in this world to please you nothing in this world make you happy no no lord i want to get out of here and i tell you closer we get to the end the greater and greater and greater it's the hunger and thirst to get out of here for the resurrection the rapture oh my grace oh my how many are longing to er to get back in fellowship with sister coffee i mean as long as you get back in february with sister dunford and the other things that are going on oh well they're you know they're they're they're gone they died and then and after a while in another few years we'll it'll be our turn we'll go no we got to be believing for the resurrection if you want the resurrection you've got to believe for it you want the rapture you've got to believe for it amen you've got to be claiming it amen and brother what we're seeing going on out there in the world especially in this covet issue oh my it's around the world but still the people are just caught up with the world they're caught up with what's going on in the world but i wonder how many believers are really caused to look up because of covet 19. amen brother you don't have to fear this and fear that amen fear the lord amen and what does it mean fear not to be afraid of him it's like like my grandfather goldie one time came when i was in in sister golden's home there fellowshipping and my grandfather came out with his bible and he wanted to know what does this mean does god that god says god is this god said i said yes but i said it doesn't mean that i said what we think it means i said it means this oh he said thank you he said wonderful he said i was wondering he said what what it meant god god was this and god is that and so on and he was thinking of the negative that we would apply that word to the negative out there to put somebody down but no no no no no no i said it doesn't mean that and i said this is the explanation of it oh oh what a wonderful blessing and my grandfather that grandfather he couldn't read any only the bible what yeah that's the only book he read the only book he could read bible or he couldn't pick up another one and read it no get the bible read it and i thank god also for that revelation in our our brother shepherd in uh that used to part the message in bjorn oh yeah and again he was only in his 30s when the lord called him home and he was you just he had just come to the message with the others in buren and i administered to him in fact the first time i ministered a cottage meeting was in his home amen in bjorn and oh he was so faithful yet so simple and so sincere and again the only book he would read is the bible he couldn't read any other book read this no no give me the bible yeah yeah and the lord called him on amen hallelujah we want to get back with him oh yes we want to get back and fellowship with him amen get back in fellowship with sister coffee sister dunford the others that are going on oh my oh my oh my i tell you this the bible god said you know he said just before the lord calls you homies you're going to be hungry and thirsty for fellowship with the saints that are going on issues that are already gone amen well brother that's physically what about spiritually how many miss the sisters and the brothers that are going on some people don't stop thinking about it oh you know what oh they're dead dead no you think they're dead you're dead no no not not them you are no no they're not dead they're alive amen boy again it's like that like the the sister one time of a certain church didn't believe didn't believe the the dead were conscious of anything or they did know not anything they said and that's what that church teaches that's what that church believes and so i said what i said where did moses elijah come from and i said when jesus was talking to them upon the mount i said they weren't dead i said physically yes but but i said they're they're in a theophany body amen so brother i trust we've got a theophany body i trust and believe that sister copy is in a the albany body amen sets the numbers in a theophany body amen and the other saints they're there waiting on us amen and they're conscious as i told that sister again i said go read that scripture they didn't know not anything about this world i said but they know a lot about the world to come amen and i said the dimension that they're in by the grace of god amen so brother and then there's so those that are going on from this assembly here they're waiting on us to hallelujah to come to that resurrection and rapturing faith oh yes because the power of god said that our comes he said he said when the dead in christ are going to appear to the living saints oh yeah praise the lord but again it's only going to appear to those that are predestinated to the rapture oh yeah and brother when this did it why because we're going to recognize them oh yeah we're going to recognize them and they know who to appear to praise the lord amen god's grace so so and we're going to recognize them and the prophet said then certainly we're going to be changed and step into that dimension with them amen and fellowship with them and look up and there be jesus coming down amen by the grace amen this is we know that this is jesus it's our lord jesus christ the pillar of fire is our lord jesus christ in the cloud of angels amen because in 1965 in believer 64 the prophet was preaching he said there he is he said looking down at us yes sir amen amen and he was referring to that cloud of angels and amen then it's the it's a power anointing and presence of our lord jesus christ in the ministry of prophet here in the ministry of prophet there amen amen and right here and the bible god said you don't realize it he said i'm not behind the bullpen yes he said i'm right here amen i can see him right there huh most you see him behind the pulpit no no he said i'm up here he said i'm looking down on everybody absolutely amazing oh brother sister the power of god that we have seen in this hour and in this age amen the power of god that's been revealed amen the resurrection and the rapture christ is with us god help god brother i tell you this god is not going to receive any excuse no because he has done so much and he's revealed himself so much amen in flesh just brother you can't question it amen even even science recognized it that's right even even science recognized that oh what is this where's this and so on and again i don't know if you've got the time the life magazine where they published those papers those pictures yeah oh yeah and and by the grace of oh yeah they i think it was these pictures that they published and it was miraculous to them and then on on the other page amen on the other page it was life magazine was a big magazine so the the pillar the cloud of angels on this side and on the other side if you you could take and look through it and see it what was it it was a rainbow at midnight in mexico what oh yes it rained at midnight and you lift up the page and look at this and on the other side you can see the rainbow amen praise the lord revelation 10. yes sir praise the lord amen because he came down in the rainbow that's right by the grace of almighty god amen oh brother where without excuse brother science and god science recognizes it science acknowledge it they didn't just ignore it why would they go in and take pictures of it and then publish it in in in worldwide magazines because it was it was supernatural amen and they knew it was supernatural they knew it wasn't normal they knew it wasn't usual they said where did this come from oh some people said oh that was a plane an airplane was flying up there they said no and in life magazine they highlighted the fact that it was higher than the plane could go oh yeah they said no no no that's not a plane they said it's too high and he says no plane goes up that eye well they're they're they and i tell you god respect them for respecting it amen god respect them for giving the honor to it in in life magazines and other and i think there was other magazines that published it as well amen i think i've got the copy of the life magazine at home yeah thank god brother we are without excuse yes sir amen just think oh yeah well yeah well i believe that was god yeah amen yeah but brother goes more that goes beyond that because beyond this beyond this and beyond this beyond this is this yes it's the word [Music] amen because this was a testimony of what god had done in the revelation of his word amen in the fulfillment of prophecy for these last days amen because god promised this was going to happen that was going to happen and so on in the last days so brother amen and brother i tell you it's it's it's for a reason it is by grace through faith it's the grace of god to bring us to the faith in the word amen amen for the resurrection for the rapture amen amen amen praise the lord it does not remind us of this and remind us of that brothers to give us the revelation of it amen in our hearts amen please in the name of jesus go be on your head there's too many uh over the years i've met too many they got it in their heads and their head in their head but they don't have it in their heart wife is in your heart it controls your life in your heart it controls your thoughts your words your deeds in your heart it controls your attitude oh you lit you you let's just live different amen you're not living like the rest of the world lives you just use this you got to do it and that's it leave it behind come on oh lord i don't want to leave you when i go to work i don't want to leave you i want you to go with me lord amen amen when i go to school i don't want to leave you home lord i want you with me in school amen i thank god that he with me in school when i went to eve when i went to high school and so on god was with me and not only that they knew it those that were in school with me they knew it but for the glory of god i wasn't getting glory to myself but give the glory to jesus yeah and and and and i didn't i didn't promote myself but promoting the lord promoting his word and so on love the lord and so on and uh so as i said concerning that religious oh yeah one time there even when i finished that school and they they also had their religious classes and uh but it was for their church and so on but the president the principal of the school did come to me and he said uh he said brother he said he said i'm not going to force children from your school they said two into the religious classes he said is there something you can give them to read or something they can do he says based on their faith and i said yes get him to read the church age book and he said okay you provide us with those books and we'll get them to read it that when we're when they were doing their own religious church classes they would go and get their church books and and and give it to the children from our assembly here you young people we are not a young there now but you were then and they're supposed to read okay oh i said that's good that's good amen thank god amen brother it's not what we did it's what god did it's not what we're doing it's what god's doing amen brother without him i can do nothing but with him all things are possible the resurrection is possible oh my oh my my lord i grace the lord that we that we can't forget the resurrection we can't forget the rapture morning noon and night lord we're thinking about it praying for it amen looking for the saints that are going on lord amen lord calling for the resurrection rapture but that's what god what god did in these last days he did that to creating us that anger and that thirst amen so that we're not going to think about anything else this this and this we're still focusing on the resurrection still focusing on the rapture lord you came down as the resurrection amen and not only that he also manifested rapturing glory grace amen in the ministry of malachi 4. amen amen amen god help us brother to believe to recognize end time evangelism that's what we've been ministering known as end time evangelism amen oh yes this church has gotten is in evangelism that was an evangelism and a lot of people maybe i don't know maybe message churches around the world just going around saying god has sent a prophet god has sent a prophet no now we got to get into the message amen or that's that's only given the faith that god sent a prophet yeah but what about the faith of the message that god gave through the prophet to give us resurrection and referring faith amen luther was luther was there to point them on to justification the pentecostals were there to point them on to the baptism and the gifts of the spirit but now brother the ministry is there to point us on to the revealed word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith to get us out of here god help us again the scripture corinthians ii corinthians 4 sorry second corinthians 4 and let's begin to read at verse 6. it says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness as shined in our hearts amen that the life we live is reflecting the light in our hearts now testimony you give is a reflection of the light that's in your heart it's not our religion out of our heads it's life eternal life in our hearts amen and he said to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god hallelujah in the face of jesus christ amen again to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ as the prophet of god said there he is he said in the heavens he said looking down on us yes sir amen glory for we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us amen we are troubled oh on every side brother if the ministry is troubled and you're believing the word of the ministry then you're troubled we are troubled on every side but we're not distressed amen we know it's for the word's sake amen eternal life hallelujah and it says we are perplexed but we're not in despair amazing faith thank god for faith that we know why we're experiencing this we know why we're experiencing that god help us amen and it says persecuted but not forsaken praise the lord cast down but not destroyed in the eyes of man no way in the eyes of god were lifted up or exalted amen always bearing about always not just on sunday and not just on wednesday night always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus amen that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body oh brother die to yourself so christ can take control amen but i'll tell you this there's a lot of believers even they're not dead to themselves no no they're still alive to what they want to do when and where they want to do it oh they want to do it they're not led by the spirit they got religion oh yeah they're very religious they got the layer of the word in their heads but he's not in control of their hearts i know that after all these years i've met many and many many believers please in the name of jesus give him control so you can say it's not me that lives amazing it's christ that live within me it's the word living itself out in you amen how do you know it's the word it's going to be the word for this hour amen the word for this age amen and you're going to live oh while you're living with that expectation of the resurrection living with expectation of the rapture looking up oh yeah look up look up look up what are you looking up for oh we're looking for the resurrection we're expecting the rapture now any time amen like i said back here when when god revealed himself back there in other ages brother morning noon and night that's all they were thinking about now they were praying the lord for morning oh yeah said they had such an anointing in their lives oh yeah it wasn't just on a sunday service or a wednesday service or whenever they got together like that no no they their lives were controlled by that that revelation well they couldn't get away from it oh they felt that anointing when when god revealed it for the first time they felt the anointing and that anointing continued with them right on true to the end of the age amen like the pentecostals and so on oh hallelujah they lived in the spirit they walked in the spirit oh yes amen 24 hours a day well they lay down in the spirit they wake and get up in the spirit and again as i said there's a time when i was in pentecost just as a teenager and i remember going to bed at night and even in that house over there on hamilton street and oh i had my bible next to me and i read the bible and then i turned and lay down oh yes and like i said one time there i laid down and when i looked up oh it seemed like i've started to fall away but then i looked up and i saw the glory of god oh and i was climbing a mountain climbing with others climbing the mountain we looked up and there was jesus coming down you saw that oh yes i saw it it wasn't a dream no no no because i was in the spirit by the grace of god and another time i was praying there and praying and praying i said oh lord o lord i need you i need your anointing and i remember coming out of the bedroom into the hallway there and and just stood up and raised my hands as the lord please i need your anointing please and i felt the power of god come down oh yeah another time i went in there went to bed woke up at sunrise got up oh yeah my family knew they knew what i was experiencing i got up went to the bed went to the window look out i saw the sun rising and and looking to see the lord oh yeah another time i we're having cottage music in in brother barnes's home and gamble and i remember at one point there i went out for something and i oh and i looked up and i looked up at the sky oh and i saw the pillar of fire in the sky i said what's that oh i said amazing i said thank you lord amen i said i went back again into the cottage meeting oh yeah and again i was highlighting to brother david where this thing happened when we were driving out to we did make a trip down to gamble and uh and i always said right here i said see this right here i said and we're just driving just this side of the the bridge over the river in middlebrook and i said this is that was a store that i came out of right there there's a house there's somebody living in it now i sit back there with the store and i ran out and when i ran out i said oh i looked down over the the trees that way at the end of the town and oh oh everything was was bright oh so what's that i said oh my the moon might be bright tonight and i was just a young boy and maybe 10 years old and i i said all that's the moon might be bright awful bright and i looked up and that's when i saw the angel in the moon and he was he was looking down at me amen and i ran i was running and i stumbled and fell and when i got up it was all dark again all gone grace brother to walk in the spirit grace to live in the spirit so he can reveal himself to us amen and other experiences that i've had as well over the years and i thank god for the yes for the grace and and and the discernment and the revelation and so on and again as i say when i first come to the message and i went to a certain home and i stayed there that was the first time among message believers and and i dreamed the dream and i saw this and i saw this and saw that and when i got up the next morning i told it to them to the the brother and his wife and as i said the sister got up and she moved her chair around the corner so that i couldn't see her no more and that she was just set over the corner around the corners and just knitting and the brother was sitting in a chest of hill across from me and i was explaining what i seen and so on what i experienced and he never responded until the day he took me to get the bus the public bus back home and he said brother he said i know i can't hide it from you he said you already know but he said i want you to know he said i want you to let you know i want to confirm it what god showed you in the dreams he said you know he said that the word is not in my home the message is not in my home the way it should be i said yes brother i understand i said i'll keep you in prayer he said thank you amen so brother god is there to deal with us god is there to keep us spiritual amen god is there to keep us walking in the light amen to be on our guard but keep your attitude right your spirit right amen or just many again there's many experiences i've had that i could share with you but to god be the glory amen so brother let's walk in the light let's humble ourselves amen for the glory of god so brother for it all and i've been condemned even by certain family members one time because i was always fellowshipping with these fellowshipping with them but they were just discouraged in a sense that i didn't fellowship with them that i will only drop in to see them and say hello and and so on and see how they were doing and then i move on to fellowship with the saints oh yeah to god be the glory brother we're not living for natural family we're living for the spiritual family who who are my brothers and sisters there's those in the gospel that's my brothers and sisters amen so brother we're always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body amen brother that christ could take control of your spirit and your attitude amen for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake amen dying to ourselves die to the flesh amen don't be controlled by your thoughts your words your deeds naturally just be controlled by the holy spirit grace for he said we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake amen what life are you living for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh oh praise the lord amen who's not you that lives is christ living in you amen so then death worker than us but life in you paul referring to the ministry and we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken that's right amen amen praise the lord your life your conversation reflects your faith we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus from the dead or raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus oh i pray jesus is in control jesus is in control of your thoughts jesus said control your words and your deeds so how many can really truly say it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me soul body and spirit amazing and again verse 14 knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god amen for which cause we faint not but though our outward men perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day oh i pray grace amen for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory amen trusting by grace that god has control of your life your thoughts your words your deeds amen for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory hallelujah while we look not at the things which are seen amen but there's too many looking at the natural things but not the spiritual but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so we're not putting our emphasis on the natural we're putting our emphasis on the spiritual by the grace of god amen so that god by the ministry of evangelism amen is taking control of us amen again maybe bring it to a close again i thought i would finish it here concerning these thoughts on end time evangelism no but let me conclude when it comes to the results of evangelism in your life end time evangelism brother their end time evangelism is focusing on the redemption of our bodies we've amen been redeemed in our souls but now god is ministering the word through the ministry for to redeem our bodies to amen we believe that jesus laid down his life and picked it up again to redeem us yeah spiritually but now brother god wants us to believe that he also laid down his life picked it up again to bring us to the redemption of our bodies amen and brother sufficient has been said to help us distinguish between beginning evangelism middle of the day evangelism ending evangelism it progressed from prophets into the god prophets for the redemption of our souls and since the day of pentecost it has progressed from the god prophet into the church age messengers forming into the body of the logos word bride for the redemption of our bodies we believe that he has redeemed us spiritually brother now god is challenging our faith physically are you redeemed physically grace it's hard to get the people to change from the old expectations to the new expectations and we're not ordained to have lutheran methodist pentecostal expectations but brother were ordained with bright expectations the lutherans look for this the meth or the methodists look for that the pentecostals were looking for this but what is the bride looking for amen we thank god for the other but now what are we looking for what are you living for what expecting morning noon and night brother jesus morning noon and night he focused on the word of god morning noon and night he focused on what god was doing oh yeah the disciples oh what god did what god would do well they were they they failed to recognize what he was doing yeah and that's why many misunderstood jesus because why because too much of the ministry is looking back looking forward but not not recognizing what was going on in the ministry of jesus oh yes oh god did this god god did that god will do this and so on yeah but what's he doing unfortunately many have lost their faith because they failed to recognize what god was doing amen and again it says as the bride we don't come to the table looking for a great meal on justification we're not looking for a great meal on sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and spiritual gifts and sometimes we might reach out to get a little handful of it but because of the type of the evangelism we're hearing our expectations are greater oh yeah we're looking for something greater than what they had in previous ages amen our expectations center on nothing less than the second coming of our lord jesus christ our expectations are focusing on our union with him amen our expectations our faith is focusing on the resurrection of the dead in christ and the rapture of the living saints amen if we fail to focus on the mystery of these revelations then we're not hearing the voice of the evening time evangelism amen evening time evangelism is pointing to the resurrection and the rapture amen grace of god remember it is written unto them unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation amen unto full salvation soul body and spirit hallelujah amen that's a promise he will with full salvation appear to those who are eagerly and constantly looking for him and how do we look for him to appear we look in the word and watch as god interprets the promise of his appearing god interprets the promise of his coming by bringing it to pass in our day amen and brother what god has done is a revelation of his appearing and coming amen for the right amen he came to redeem the bride now he's come for the bright amen by the grace of god amen so brother we look in the word and watch as god interprets the promise of his appearing is coming by bringing it to pass in our day the days of the voice of the seventh angel declares is appearing and is coming for the bright amen praise the lord for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready brother end time evangelism is focusing on the marriage of the lamb amen and the bride making herself ready and before she can make herself ready she's got to recognize by the scriptures that she's the bride spoken off in the word amen recognizing himself in the scriptures jesus knew that he was the lamb of god sent to redeem the bride amen therefore jesus prepared himself for sacrifice the bride recognizing who she is is preparing herself for the resurrection and the rapture amen finish with these this thought evening time evangelism is showing the bride oh she is a man you are the bride of the lord jesus christ you are making yourself ready by lining up with the word and you are personally uniting in an intimate relationship with jesus and you are looking with great expectations to gather with the saints of all ages for the marriage supper of the lamb as the bride you are living for jesus christ not your wife not your husband not your natural family not your job but you're living for jesus amen and pleading the token for your family pleading the token for your friends your neighbors but living for jesus amen the bright men bride members not able to enter into this will go by way of the grave amen well the prophet of god said that after his going most of us most of the old people he said lived in that day he said they're going to are all the old people he told brother lee vale he said they're going to go by way of the grave he said because they won't they won't have that resurrection and rapturing faith so oh yeah they're they're going by way of degree god honoring their faith to take them into that dimension but there's gonna god is gonna raise up a bride that will have that faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture to save the faith that jesus had to lay down his life and pick it up again well we laid on our lives for the lord amen and we pick up a spiritual life by the grace of god amen we are living as the prophet of god said we are living in a changing time so i pray grace that our lives reflect the change amen that god is working in the right from time to eternity so let me ask you again these questions who who are you are you adam or are you eve are you able or are you cain oh yeah they're both religious yeah and look at the the sacrifice that that cain made and look at the sacrifice that abel made amen see one was religious genuine spiritual just think cain made a religious sacrifice but abel made a spiritual one what my look at the difference between cain's sacrifice and abel's oh cain sacrificed all the natural things of life that he went and he grew this and he grew this he did this did this and he put that on the altar for the lord well what did abel do people went out and he was looking after he was he was keeping sheep looking after sheep and he went got the lamb laid the lamb down and killed it and sliced its neck and so on and all the blood came out abel what in the world you do that for you killed the lamb shed his blood wouldn't didn't you why didn't you offer the lord this offer the lord that no well able knew he had a spiritual revelation he had a faith it was by grace through faith that abel was saved amen but it's hard to believe oh that was his faith that was his faith what cain had faith kate did cain did this oh yes he believed in god oh yeah again that's why the prophet god warned us concerning believers make believers and unbelievers he said there's three kinds of believers again that's why i explained to that brother that the gentleman that emailed me and told me that he read the bible three times and he didn't believe it he said oh he said there's this there's this there's so many mistakes in the bible and that and i said brother i said there's something you failed to understand when you read the bible i said god i said it wrote it in such a way i said so as to give the faith to the true believer amen i said to cause the make believer to stumble and i said to cause the unbeliever to walk away oh i said god did this god did that i said to bring out the spirit that's in the human right god did it to bring the spirits in you so do you have the faith amen to believe god stay with god believe his word and so on or is it just a make-believer that you'll go so far uh yeah well i don't think i don't think that's necessary i don't think god would want to worry about that no no okay yes lord i believe that there no you gotta believe it from genesis to revelation alpha and omega now brother sister god have mercy on us so are we are we with adam's spirit or eve spirit yeah we could explain that and go on and on for another few hours to explain the spirit that adam ahead versus the spirit that even yeah well see adam had a greater revelation than eve oh yeah and that he put himself in sin knowing what he was doing what for so that god redeeming him would redeem eve oh my praise the lord god redeeming you is going to redeem this one and that because you're there to plead to plead the blood of jesus for your family friends and neighbors oh yeah plead the grace of god for family friends and neighbors and let's understand again that brother who earth those who are saved are those who have a right attitude and a right spirit oh yeah and brother but then god requires more of the bride more of the elect more of the chosen to believe this to believe this to believe that but brother actually one thing god does require is a right attitude and a right spirit and there are people out there oh but god sees the heart oh we think that was nice that was nice that was nice but god looks down into the heart oh he knows the heart is not right yep the attitude in their heart he knows so are you adam or eve are you able or cain what is your sacrifice what are you putting the emphasis on cain the natural things of life but evil the spiritual are you enoch or noah oh surely it'd be good if we're noah yes but be better if you're enoch because enoch was raptured enoch was not he walked with god and was not because god took him praise the lord amen so are you abraham or lot hmm as you're putting yourself first and your own desires because god delivered because of abraham's prayer god delivered lot out of sodom and gomorrah but told him to go here but no he didn't want to go there he said lord let me go here so god let him go on up there yeah he got he got into sin more and more oh yeah with his family show every abram just stay with the word stay with the lord believe god stay with it you're not going to compromise for no nothing and nobody give god the glory are you isaac or ishmael are you jacob or esau are you joseph or his elder brothers are you moses or dathan are you jesus or judas yeah are you a wise virgin or a foolish virgin are you sheep or a goat oh yeah are you a believer or a make-believer the prophet of god preached that message on three kinds of believers why he said i want to challenge your faith he says i want you to decide which one you are could no doubt the prouder god knew that he was ministering to make believers and unbelievers yeah so i trust by the grace of god that we're holy ghosts believers amen so lord bless us as we focus more and more on end time evangelism to god be the glory god bless you let's stand praise the lord praise the lord thus saint 4 42 again all things are ready come to the feast come for the table now is spread ye famishing ye weary come and thou shall be richly fed amen hear the invitation come
