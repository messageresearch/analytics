[32:50] perfectly this evening
[32:52] and so Lord we thank you for your
[32:54] presence
[32:55] Lord we thank you for your promise that
[32:57] we're two or three are gathered there
[32:58] you be in the midst of us Heavenly
[33:00] Father
[33:01] so Lord we're praying Lord that in this
[33:02] little group tonight Lord in this little
[33:05] message you've given me Lord that you
[33:06] would speak to our hearts and souls Lord
[33:08] that you would encourage us along the
[33:09] way Lord that you would help us to Lord
[33:12] not let Satan deny us of any promise or
[33:15] Lord anything that you've given us in
[33:17] your word heavenly father but that we
[33:18] would step forward in Faith Lord that we
[33:21] would hold that sword of the word in our
[33:23] hands Lord and that we push back
[33:24] everything that would hold us back from
[33:26] what you've given us Lord God while
[33:28] remembering the many needs Lord many
[33:30] sick not able to be here tonight Lord
[33:32] those that are traveling Lord and and
[33:35] leaving potentially tomorrow Lord
[33:36] Brother Joshua and sister Rochelle or we
[33:38] pray your grace especially for them
[33:40] Heavenly Father Lord just Minister and
[33:42] be with us now we pray and in Jesus
[33:45] Christ's name we ask it amen
[33:47] amen God bless you if you turn and you
[33:50] would and to Deuteronomy chapter 8.
[33:53] amen certainly appreciate sister
[33:54] Priscilla being instant in season and
[33:57] coming in and playing I don't think the
[34:00] bass guitar is something that generally
[34:01] we want to just have on its own up here
[34:03] on the platform so certainly appreciate
[34:05] that it makes all the difference amen it
[34:07] really does to have that there so we
[34:09] very thankful for that we're very
[34:11] thankful uh I know that we've we've seen
[34:13] the email and most of us know but for
[34:15] those that are listening online maybe
[34:17] don't know that the church purchase has
[34:19] finally been finalized and it is ours as
[34:22] much as it can be until we pay off the
[34:24] mortgage but certainly it's been a
[34:26] tremendous Miracle to get it done as
[34:27] quickly as it did it couldn't happen
[34:29] soon enough for us I think but we're
[34:31] trusting the Lord was in it and as
[34:33] brother Bob has shared that he's removed
[34:35] many barriers and made things happen and
[34:37] given us grace and favor and financing
[34:39] these different things we've had quite a
[34:42] bit of money given to us and and perhaps
[34:44] we'll share some of those details later
[34:45] but not today or myself but we've had so
[34:49] many people that have in churches and
[34:51] pastors and individuals that have just
[34:52] reached out and said we'd like to give
[34:54] and when they heard of the need and they
[34:56] heard of the opportunity they just
[34:57] stepped right up to the plate and
[34:59] there's even probably more coming so
[35:01] we're we're certainly thankful to that
[35:03] that we are part of a body that we're
[35:05] not just isolated here on the East Coast
[35:06] on this this this Rocky island but
[35:09] there's a whole body of Christ out there
[35:11] that's feeding in and and supporting us
[35:13] in this amen so certainly thankful for
[35:15] that and kind of along that note I I did
[35:18] speak to a minister this weekend or this
[35:20] week about coming to visit us and
[35:22] Minister for us in the next month or two
[35:23] so he'll get back to me hopefully in the
[35:26] next week and give me an idea of if he
[35:28] can or when he can and when he does that
[35:30] then then we'll we'll have our first
[35:32] special meetings in this building and
[35:34] I've got to talk to the trustees make
[35:36] sure that we don't interfere with the
[35:37] renovations and the painting and these
[35:39] things but just so you know it's been on
[35:41] our art to have special means for quite
[35:43] some time but with all the things in
[35:44] limbo and the buildings and changes and
[35:47] and whatnot we didn't really feel that
[35:48] we could do that very well so but
[35:51] hopefully in the next month or two we'll
[35:52] have special meetings and and that'll
[35:54] kind
[35:55] of season four so be in prayer for that
[35:57] amen amen Deuteronomy chapter eight I do
[36:00] I don't apologize but I know this has
[36:02] been a common verse I preached on it a
[36:05] couple weeks or a couple Services ago
[36:06] and then brother Gerald used it on on on
[36:08] the last service and and now I'm here
[36:10] using it again but it it ties into to so
[36:13] many things and so I want to just read
[36:15] these these four verses here to start us
[36:18] off this evening Deuteronomy 8 verse 7
[36:20] says for the Lord thy God bringeth thee
[36:22] into a good land a land of Brooks of
[36:25] water of fountains and depths that
[36:27] spring out of valleys and Hills a land
[36:29] of Wheat and barley and Vines and fig
[36:31] trees and pomegranates a land of oil
[36:34] olive and honey a land wherein Thou
[36:37] shalt eat bread without scarceness thou
[36:39] shalt not lack anything in it a land
[36:42] whose Stones our iron and out of whose
[36:44] will whose Hills thou mayest dig brass
[36:47] when the highest eaten and are full then
[36:50] Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for
[36:52] the good land which he hath given thee
[36:55] amen God bless you you can have your
[36:56] seats may he bless the reading of his
[36:58] word this evening and I I I I I've been
[37:02] dwelling on some things for so long that
[37:04] you almost start to forget what you've
[37:06] preached and what you haven't preached
[37:07] and and this is kind of a service to to
[37:11] maybe look forward to we're not we've
[37:12] spent so much time in the desert and the
[37:14] dreariness and the trials and the
[37:17] struggles and all these things and it's
[37:19] kind of like they you know you're trying
[37:20] to get job off the ash Heap you know and
[37:22] and so the this this evening I want to
[37:24] take a thought of the land of your
[37:26] inheritance and this will be a good
[37:28] service this will be a land where we
[37:29] talk about prophecies and we talk about
[37:31] the promises and the good things of God
[37:33] and whatnot so it's a Wednesday night
[37:35] it's a it's going to be a shorter
[37:37] service so just settle in and relax and
[37:39] get ready to enjoy and and hear about
[37:41] what God has prepared for us amen amen
[37:44] we've uh you know you look back in
[37:46] history and we've had 2 000 years since
[37:48] Christ came and Christ came and he gave
[37:51] the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[37:52] and we had a lot
[37:54] and then what happened is we lost a lot
[37:56] and we went from from the peak of uh of
[37:59] the Believers and and whatnot and we
[38:01] went down into kind of the Valley of the
[38:03] shadow of death through the the church
[38:04] ages and almost nobody believed and and
[38:07] there was almost nothing happening and
[38:09] and now we're building back to what they
[38:11] had on that first day of Pentecost amen
[38:13] and it's it's not just speaking in
[38:15] tongues and it's not just these things
[38:16] but it's a life lived and it's a
[38:18] relationship with Christ and it's a
[38:20] Oneness that we're being restored back
[38:22] to amen and this time once we get it
[38:24] we'll hold on to it all the way into
[38:25] eternity amen there'll be no losing it
[38:27] after we get it in its fullness amen so
[38:30] we're going to talk about possessions
[38:31] this evening we're going to talk about
[38:33] promises we're going to talk about
[38:34] prophecies we're going to talk about
[38:36] what God has written for you the
[38:38] believer for the child of God for the
[38:40] elect for the predestinated and I want
[38:42] to start with that that first verse
[38:44] there because this is a this is a type
[38:46] and Shadow here and and and we'll do
[38:49] types and shadows mostly today and then
[38:51] maybe the Lord willing on Sunday we'll
[38:52] get into what he has for us specifically
[38:55] in this age but I just want to use this
[38:57] and kind of dig into this a bit and
[38:58] maybe teach a bit tonight
[39:00] on what God has prepared for us the land
[39:03] of our inheritance and verse 7 says for
[39:05] the Lord that God bringeth thee into a
[39:07] good land
[39:10] just right there you could almost preach
[39:11] all service he brings you into a good
[39:14] land what God has in front of you is
[39:16] good though you may not be able to see
[39:19] it or understand it in its fullness it
[39:20] is a good land and he says it's a land
[39:22] of Brooks of water of fountains and
[39:25] depths that spring out of valleys and
[39:27] Hills now to to someone in Newfoundland
[39:30] when you start talking about it's a
[39:31] place full of water we think I would
[39:33] like maybe perhaps a little less water
[39:35] because we don't have the idea of what
[39:37] it means to be in a desert but if you go
[39:39] to somebody maybe from Arizona or
[39:41] California or even areas of Texas and
[39:43] you say I'm going to bring you into a
[39:45] land full of water and Brooks and
[39:47] springs that are springing up and
[39:49] pushing out of the land they'd say
[39:51] hallelujah and praise the Lord and
[39:53] you've got to think that the children of
[39:54] Israel when they heard this that that
[39:57] had an effect on them because they've
[39:59] been walking you know for 40 years in a
[40:01] desert and I don't know if you know this
[40:03] but a desert is dry a desert doesn't
[40:06] have a lot of greenery it doesn't have a
[40:07] lot of crops it's mostly dust and rocks
[40:10] and lizards
[40:11] that's all that's there so when God
[40:13] comes and he says this is a good land
[40:15] full of water I imagine there is a bit
[40:18] of rejoicing there because they've been
[40:19] going through a journey where they had
[40:21] to skimp and they had to scrape and they
[40:23] had to save and they had to ration their
[40:25] water to make sure that they could get
[40:27] through from day to day and he's saying
[40:29] I'm bringing you now to a place where
[40:31] you don't have to scream you don't have
[40:33] to hold back you don't have to ration
[40:35] because as much as you can take as much
[40:37] as you can use as much as you can put
[40:40] inside of you there's always going to be
[40:41] more available to you
[40:44] this isn't a land of survival
[40:47] is what we're talking about you survive
[40:50] a desert but he's talking about a land
[40:52] where they'll Thrive amen where there's
[40:54] more there's an abundance there's above
[40:56] and beyond what they could ask or think
[40:57] available for them amen
[41:00] so I want you to understand that this is
[41:02] what the promises of God look like
[41:04] is that they are not held back they are
[41:06] not rationed to us but it is always an
[41:09] abundance it's exactly what we have need
[41:11] of to meet our needs and then there's
[41:13] some Beyond and above what we can do
[41:14] that amen notice here it says Brooks of
[41:18] water and Brooks are great but we know
[41:20] Brooks are just little thin streams and
[41:22] there's maybe not a lot there but then
[41:24] he says fountains and then he says
[41:26] there's depths that spring out of the
[41:28] valleys and Hills you know what that
[41:30] means that means they're not seasonal
[41:33] means that there isn't a time where
[41:35] there's water and then there's a time
[41:36] where there's not water but it means
[41:37] that there's a source there there's a
[41:39] place where there is an internal
[41:41] pressure that is constantly taking that
[41:43] water and delivering it to where you
[41:45] need it that you always have access to
[41:48] that water because it's not dependent on
[41:50] the ups and the Dows and the ins and the
[41:52] outs but it's available because there is
[41:54] a constant Source that's pushing it
[41:57] towards you and it's throughout the
[41:59] entire land it's not that your brother
[42:00] has it and you don't or your sister has
[42:02] it and you don't but each and every one
[42:04] of us has a land where there is a
[42:06] fountain there's a springing Out of
[42:08] Water that's available for our needs
[42:10] that we have amen
[42:11] it reminds me of the woman that Jesus
[42:14] met at the well outside of that City and
[42:16] she'd had five husbands she was living
[42:19] common law with a man who was not her
[42:21] husband
[42:22] she was a reject to society and when you
[42:24] say a reject to society in a gentile
[42:27] world that's a pretty bad person
[42:29] this is a woman that's of ill repute
[42:31] she's a fallen nature and she's got a
[42:33] life behind her to prove it and she
[42:35] comes to Jesus at the wall and she'd
[42:38] been walking a desert road for a very
[42:39] long time
[42:41] and she was coming to a wall and she was
[42:43] coming there in the middle of the day in
[42:44] the Hop time of the day because she
[42:46] couldn't come in the cooler the morning
[42:47] or the evening because that's when the
[42:49] women that were that were of good
[42:51] reputation would come there and she
[42:53] wasn't allowed to associate with them
[42:55] but you notice what happens when Jesus
[42:57] meets her there and after he talks to
[43:00] her world what does he offer her
[43:03] he offers her water
[43:06] and if you look at the words that he
[43:08] uses you'll see he's pointing back to
[43:10] Deuteronomy 8 when he does it and the
[43:12] bait on the hook for her was a water
[43:14] that would quench her thirst and it says
[43:17] in John 4 14 he says but whosoever
[43:19] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[43:21] him shall never thirst
[43:24] but the water that I give him shall be
[43:27] in him in him a well of water doing what
[43:32] dribbling out
[43:34] tap on tap off no it says a well of
[43:38] water springing up into everlasting life
[43:42] listen God doesn't say things by
[43:44] circumstance and Jesus is not using
[43:46] those words springing up just Loosely or
[43:49] by coincidence he's pointing us and he's
[43:51] telling this woman he said you may have
[43:53] heard of a land that's full of a well of
[43:55] water that Springs up you may have seen
[43:57] the promise to Moses and the children of
[43:59] Israel but what's standing in front of
[44:01] you is a New Covenant and it's bringing
[44:04] a new water and it's bringing a new
[44:06] source and once you get that you'll
[44:08] never thirst for the things that have
[44:09] destroyed your life thus far it'll take
[44:12] you off this desert road and it'll bring
[44:14] you into a land of fulfillment
[44:16] that's what he promised to her amen
[44:18] what's he saying he's saying don't look
[44:20] for the water that was promised back
[44:22] there recognize the water that's
[44:24] standing in front of you today and it's
[44:26] not just the word of God but it's the
[44:27] person of the word of God standing here
[44:29] and it's here to quench your thirst so
[44:31] that those natural things that have
[44:33] destroyed your life that have held you
[44:35] back that have hindered your
[44:36] relationships that have pulled you away
[44:38] from society he says that will be
[44:40] resolved if you can take care and accept
[44:42] this water that's standing before you
[44:44] today
[44:45] listen Church
[44:47] she didn't know she had the seed of God
[44:49] inside of her
[44:51] she didn't know it she was a fallen
[44:54] woman if there was a woman that was
[44:55] destined for hell looking from the
[44:57] outside it was this woman
[45:00] adultery six times five times over six
[45:03] times over messed up
[45:06] but yet there was something inside of
[45:08] her that when that water came her way
[45:10] she caught a hold of it and she said
[45:12] this is different
[45:13] and when she tasted and she accepted
[45:16] that water it changed her life and she
[45:18] left her water pot behind and she went
[45:20] in and thousands of people in that City
[45:22] got saved because of her testimony and
[45:24] came to receive that water themselves
[45:25] amen
[45:26] listen David opens up the book of Psalms
[45:30] with these wonderful scriptures the
[45:31] first three scriptures of Psalms one and
[45:33] he's talking about what it means to be a
[45:35] child of God somebody that has chosen
[45:37] and he says blessed is the man that
[45:39] walketh not in the counsel of the
[45:41] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[45:43] Sinners nor sinneth in the seed of the
[45:45] scornful
[45:47] now you don't start like that
[45:49] I want you to recognize as we go through
[45:51] this it says but his Delight is in the
[45:54] law of the Lord and in his law does he
[45:56] meditate day and night why
[45:59] because he shall be like a tree planted
[46:03] by the rivers of water that bringeth
[46:05] forth his fruit in his season his Leaf
[46:08] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[46:10] doeth shall prosper notice it doesn't
[46:13] say he just landed there
[46:16] that a man or a woman a son or a
[46:19] daughter a child of God does not just
[46:21] land where they are but they are planted
[46:23] in a place where they will bring forth
[46:25] fruit and it's always by water
[46:29] and we'll see why that is because water
[46:32] we know is a type of the word of God
[46:35] there's many types of the word of God
[46:37] and we'll get into some of them this
[46:38] this evening but the way the the lord
[46:41] always plants his children by a place
[46:43] where they can receive the word of God
[46:44] because that's what gives us our growth
[46:46] that's what keeps us pointed that's the
[46:48] thing that keeps giving us the nutrients
[46:50] that we need
[46:51] but as I was studying this we so often
[46:54] focus on water for thirst but you'll see
[46:56] that water is not just for thirst and to
[47:00] satisfy your body and keep you alive but
[47:02] it's there to wash you
[47:04] it's there to keep you clean it's there
[47:06] to take away the things that would get
[47:08] on you throughout your day and these
[47:10] different things it's there to put you
[47:12] in a state that you're presentable and
[47:14] acceptable as well brother Brandon will
[47:17] talk about this and he talked about the
[47:18] Waters of separation and I love how in
[47:21] Deuteronomy 8 verse 1 God says you can't
[47:24] come to me and say that I can't be
[47:27] separated
[47:28] because the Waters of Separation are
[47:30] always available to you they didn't have
[47:32] to ration they couldn't say well I had
[47:34] to drink it therefore there's no Waters
[47:36] of Separation today but he put him in a
[47:38] land where there's enough water there to
[47:40] keep them clean to keep them separate
[47:42] from the things of the world to take off
[47:43] those things that we get as we're
[47:45] walking through this Earth
[47:46] I talked a bit about my experiences in
[47:49] Vancouver you know and just the filth
[47:51] and the mess that's there are maybe more
[47:53] pronounced in here but the simple fact
[47:55] is if you are a God-fearing man or woman
[47:57] no matter what as you walk through this
[48:00] world you're going to see you're going
[48:01] to hear and you're going to experience
[48:03] things that you're not supposed to see
[48:05] here or experience
[48:06] listen you can't go through a mall you
[48:08] can't go on your phone you can't surf
[48:10] the Internet you can't be around worldly
[48:12] people without something crossing your
[48:14] way and guess what some of it sticks
[48:16] from time to time and you need water of
[48:18] the washing of the word to come in and
[48:20] say don't let that stay in your life
[48:23] and what he promised in Deuteronomy 8 is
[48:25] that he wouldn't just satisfy your
[48:26] thirst but he'd give you water to keep
[48:28] you clean as well the washing of Water
[48:30] by the word
[48:33] God provided them not just a way to live
[48:35] but he provided a way for them to live
[48:37] clean and holy
[48:39] brother Brown would say this he said
[48:41] notice now what was the water of
[48:42] Separation a type of he said the water
[48:45] of Separation was the type of the word
[48:46] of God the word he says now I believe
[48:49] it's over in Ephesians in the fifth
[48:50] chapter it said that he might sanctify
[48:52] and cleanse us with the washing of the
[48:54] Water by the word see washing of the
[48:56] water of Separation by the word and in
[49:00] the beginning was the word the word was
[49:01] with God the Word was God and the Word
[49:03] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[49:06] became he said you see it the water of
[49:09] separation
[49:11] we've got to understand what Christ was
[49:13] and I was dwelling on this today and
[49:14] it's not in my notes at all but you've
[49:16] got to recognize that they called him
[49:18] Jesus the Christ why because he was the
[49:21] anointed one
[49:22] and he was anointed for purpose and the
[49:24] thing is if you're in him and you're
[49:26] with him then you've got to be anointed
[49:28] as well and so he says he became the
[49:31] water of Separation he was anointed to
[49:33] separate us from our sin from our nature
[49:36] and you were then taking on that
[49:38] anointing to become what he took in your
[49:40] place
[49:41] he took you so that you could become him
[49:43] and he said Christ became the water of
[49:46] Separation it puts your sin aside from
[49:48] you and then he starts to wash you and
[49:51] change you so that you don't have to
[49:52] deal with what you had all this time in
[49:54] your life
[49:55] he says amen everything that Christ died
[49:58] for and promised in his word is yours as
[50:01] freely as the water runs for if you have
[50:04] a sin apply the word
[50:07] wash it
[50:09] don't run from it sit under the washing
[50:12] of the word he says and apply it it's
[50:15] the water of Separation what is it the
[50:17] blood covers it so that it can't be
[50:19] attributed to us but God's trying to get
[50:21] that sin out of our life the sin nature
[50:24] the sin habit the sin inclination and
[50:27] that happens under the preaching of the
[50:28] word which is the washing of Water by
[50:30] the word
[50:31] now listen to this this is beautiful he
[50:33] says now the water of Separation
[50:35] separates you from sin
[50:38] but look how far he carries it he says
[50:40] if you are weary
[50:42] apply the water of the word
[50:45] this is a powerful Water Church
[50:48] if you are sick apply the water of the
[50:51] word for it separates us from sickness
[50:55] it separates us from sin it separates us
[50:58] from weariness it separates us from
[51:00] every attribute that sin produced he
[51:04] says oh I love it for he has washed us
[51:06] and cleansed us through the washing of
[51:08] the Water by the word and separated us
[51:11] unto himself
[51:13] of believing people that set aside from
[51:15] the world to believe on the Lord Jesus
[51:18] Christ why
[51:20] that he might manifest himself to the
[51:23] outside world through the Holy Spirit
[51:25] operating through this inside of the
[51:28] blood cell
[51:30] Church what ought that to do for us
[51:31] today because we sit there and we say
[51:33] I'm stuck in limbo I I can't seem to get
[51:36] any traction I'm struggling I'm fighting
[51:38] and he's pointing us to a land where the
[51:41] water meets every need that we have
[51:43] that it washes us it cleans us it meets
[51:46] our thirst it does everything to Keep Us
[51:48] Alive and moving forward amen
[51:50] it keeps you every wit clean and ready
[51:53] and presentable for his presence
[51:56] then he continues in verse 8 and he says
[51:58] it's a land of Wheat and barley and
[52:01] Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a
[52:05] land of oil olive and honey I notice it
[52:08] always says Royal Olive not olive oil
[52:09] and I'm not sure
[52:12] why it does that but it's consistent
[52:14] throughout the scripture
[52:16] but what is what stands out about this
[52:18] is that everything that you need to live
[52:21] and enjoy life is right here
[52:24] because those days they didn't have
[52:25] grocery stores the way we do and we
[52:27] didn't have airplanes and refrigerated
[52:29] trucks to bring things up from Mexico or
[52:31] from BC or Texas or California
[52:33] throughout the year you had to have
[52:35] something that would last you year round
[52:38] and so certain crops you can't have
[52:40] lettuce and keep lettuce for six months
[52:42] or a year until the next crop grows and
[52:44] these different things but you'll notice
[52:45] that he opens up with wheat and barley
[52:48] and that's for a reason because these
[52:50] are sustenance crops
[52:52] and wheat is the universal food it'll
[52:55] feed people it'll feed animals and if
[52:58] you have wheat and you have water you
[53:00] can survive indefinitely
[53:02] it has a little bit of protein has lots
[53:04] of carbohydrates it has lots of energy
[53:06] if you have wheat which can make bread
[53:08] and you have water then you can live
[53:10] pretty much forever
[53:13] may not be healthy we need our
[53:14] vegetables these different things but
[53:16] this was really considered the the
[53:17] requirements for life was you have bread
[53:19] and you have water and so that's what he
[53:21] opens up with and it was interesting
[53:23] brother Tim Pruitt was sharing with a
[53:25] bunch of us brothers and he's been he
[53:27] preached on it for a while and he was
[53:28] talking about how the wheat is so often
[53:32] attacked by a fungus and I looked up
[53:35] some pictures of what this looks like
[53:36] and it's interesting because when you
[53:38] look in the scriptures Satan is always
[53:40] attacking the wheat
[53:42] remember Jesus preached the parable of
[53:44] of the sower and it was the wheat and
[53:46] what attacks the wheat he's got birds in
[53:49] there and he's got cares of life and
[53:50] he's got rocky ground and there's no
[53:52] depth to the person's relationship with
[53:54] God and these different things and then
[53:56] you look at the parable of of the wheat
[53:58] field and what happens is he sows good
[54:00] seed good wheat seed and then somebody
[54:02] comes in and sows Bad Seed with it why
[54:04] to try and choke out the wheat to kill
[54:06] it
[54:07] so he's always trying to attack what
[54:10] the wheat the food source he's always
[54:12] trying to if he can't kill it he's
[54:14] trying to corrupt it
[54:16] and brother Bradham preached extensively
[54:18] on this fungus because so often we focus
[54:20] on the tares that are next to us but he
[54:22] says you've got to be aware of the
[54:23] fungus that gets in there because the
[54:25] worst of these fungi can kill you if you
[54:27] ingest it
[54:30] and was that a representation of its
[54:31] representation of if we're not preached
[54:34] and receiving the pure word of God it's
[54:36] tainted and it only brings death
[54:39] that's why we're not a denomination
[54:41] because every denomination has put a
[54:43] period behind what they believe about
[54:44] the word but we preach from an Open
[54:46] Bible an open scripture because that's
[54:48] the only way God can work with us and
[54:50] give us a pureness of the word in our
[54:52] lives amen
[54:54] we know that you can take wheat and you
[54:56] can turn it into bread and that again is
[54:58] a type of the word of God and Jesus
[55:00] talked about this in his ministry and it
[55:02] says in John 6 then Jesus said unto them
[55:05] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[55:07] you not that bread from heaven but my
[55:10] father giveth you the true bread from
[55:12] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[55:15] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[55:18] unto the world you look at his words
[55:20] here and it reminds me of when he was
[55:21] talking to the woman at the well because
[55:23] he says I've got different water than
[55:25] you're used to
[55:27] Jacob dug this well and Moses provided
[55:30] you bread but he says I've got water
[55:32] that Jacob didn't dig for and now he
[55:34] says here there's a bread that Moses
[55:36] couldn't give you either and he says
[55:37] it's a person
[55:39] this bread of life is a person it's not
[55:41] just an idea it's not just something
[55:43] that happened in the past but it's a
[55:45] supernatural bread and it's standing in
[55:47] front of you right now
[55:49] and I think you'll find in these things
[55:50] is that the issue is not does it exist
[55:53] is there water to quench your thirsts is
[55:56] there bread of life to satisfy the
[55:57] question is not does it exist but the
[55:59] question is will you accept it
[56:02] because it was standing in front of them
[56:03] and how many times did Jesus prove that
[56:05] he was the bread of life listen he
[56:07] raised the dead multiple times he healed
[56:10] the sick
[56:11] he delivered and cast people and cast
[56:13] out demons from them he proved over and
[56:15] over and over again that there was a
[56:17] life there was a Wellspring inside of
[56:19] him of Supernatural power and yet he
[56:21] stands in front of them
[56:23] and look at what they say they said unto
[56:25] him Lord Evermore give us this bread
[56:29] give it to us and keep giving it to us
[56:31] is what they said and Jesus said unto
[56:34] them I am the bread of life he that
[56:36] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[56:38] that believeth on me shall never thirst
[56:41] so they said Lord give it to us and then
[56:43] he says I am it and then what did they
[56:45] do
[56:46] walked away
[56:49] like I said the question is not does it
[56:50] exist the question is will you accept it
[56:52] because what happens so often is that we
[56:54] say Lord this is what I need this is
[56:57] what I want and we neglect to take what
[56:59] he has laid right before us
[57:01] the Simplicity of the word the humility
[57:03] of the word simple obedience
[57:06] and we turn it down because we want
[57:08] something of our own making
[57:11] he says if you come to me he says then
[57:13] you'll never hunger and you'll never
[57:15] thirst and you'll be amazed that people
[57:17] can read this Bible and one can read it
[57:19] and they can read it and they can go a
[57:21] week on one scripture
[57:23] and then somebody can sit there and they
[57:25] can read an entire book in there and
[57:27] they walk out the door and they trip up
[57:28] on their own selves and they fall almost
[57:30] immediately why because one ate it and
[57:33] one read it that's the difference is
[57:36] that one took it and made it a part of
[57:38] themselves and the other one just had a
[57:39] mental conception and it got stuck in
[57:42] their mind and it wasn't put into action
[57:43] in their life it didn't sink deep down
[57:45] into their soul and so when the time
[57:48] comes that that the push is on and the
[57:50] pressure's on then they fall because
[57:52] they haven't eaten it it's not a part of
[57:54] them there's nothing to sustain them and
[57:55] in their weakness they fall into
[57:57] temptation or these different things
[57:58] amen
[58:00] but I want you to understand as we go
[58:02] through and these are types and shadows
[58:04] and we're just doing types and shadows
[58:05] this evening we'll get into what it
[58:07] means for us specifically in this age
[58:09] but I want you to see that that God has
[58:11] provided not only for their needs here
[58:14] but he's provided for their wants as
[58:16] well and as we look at the next thing we
[58:18] see that he said that there was Vines
[58:19] there and those Vines were for grapes
[58:22] and we know that the grapes were for
[58:23] wine to drink
[58:24] and we know as we've been taught in this
[58:27] message that wine represents the
[58:28] stimulation of Revelation
[58:31] now we may have some Concepts about what
[58:33] the stimulation of Revelation looks like
[58:35] but the prophet of God tells us that it
[58:37] represents what happens when you truly
[58:39] see what God has been talking about
[58:42] when you when it becomes a reality and
[58:46] it drops down into your soul and it
[58:48] anchors there by the word of faith and
[58:51] it stays there and it cannot be moved no
[58:53] matter what happens that's when you see
[58:54] the stimulation of Revelation brother
[58:57] Brown says this he says you see the wine
[58:59] represents stimulation of Revelation and
[59:01] when the Holy Ghost fell and they seen
[59:03] the fire of God fall upon them my that
[59:06] begin to stimulate them and the first
[59:09] thing you know they got so stimulated
[59:10] till all the people actually thought
[59:12] they were drunk but they were stimulated
[59:14] stimulated by the Revelation he says
[59:17] here it is he says here's what
[59:18] stimulated them God's Vindicated
[59:21] Revelation made plain to them they were
[59:25] happy about it God promised it here it
[59:28] was revealed to them and Vindicated to
[59:30] them amen here was a man standing there
[59:33] saying this is that this is it and he's
[59:36] pointing to to Joel 2 28 where he says
[59:39] I'll pour out my spirit on my sons and
[59:41] daughters and these different things he
[59:42] says this is what stimulated them is
[59:45] when the word of God was happening in
[59:48] their life and they could place it in
[59:50] scripture and they could say praise the
[59:51] lord it's finally happened
[59:54] what he promised is finally coming to
[59:56] pass now listen a revelation from God
[59:59] can strike and it may not come to pass
[1:00:01] immediately but when it comes from God
[1:00:03] and you accept it as from God and it
[1:00:05] anchors into your heart you can praise
[1:00:07] in that moment
[1:00:09] that's what the simulation of revelation
[1:00:11] will do but it'll carry you forward
[1:00:13] until you see it a reality in your life
[1:00:16] there's no greater stimulation than when
[1:00:18] you believed and you confessed and
[1:00:21] you've stayed impatience and you stayed
[1:00:23] in obedience and then it happens
[1:00:25] when you prayed about it and you prayed
[1:00:27] about it and you've waited and you've
[1:00:28] trusted and then it happens that gives
[1:00:30] you stimulation that makes you raise
[1:00:32] your hand and shout and praise and cry
[1:00:34] and do all of these things you're
[1:00:36] reminded of when my sister Atlanta when
[1:00:39] it struck her that she was healed of
[1:00:40] cancer
[1:00:41] she got the stimulation of Revelation
[1:00:43] and she ran around that church raising
[1:00:46] her hands and shouting and dancing and
[1:00:48] praying God why because it struck her
[1:00:50] that by his stripes I am healed and it's
[1:00:53] a finished work
[1:00:55] listen maybe it wasn't at that moment
[1:00:58] she got healed maybe it was I don't know
[1:01:00] but in that moment she got the
[1:01:02] stimulation and that was made real to
[1:01:04] her and she knew that it is finished at
[1:01:07] that moment
[1:01:08] and whether she went to the doctor and
[1:01:10] got a clean bill of health the next day
[1:01:11] the next week or the next month that was
[1:01:14] her moment of Victory because the
[1:01:16] stimulation of the true revelation of
[1:01:17] the healing of God had struck her and
[1:01:19] she knew that it's a finished work amen
[1:01:22] that's the time where she said this is
[1:01:24] it
[1:01:25] this is it
[1:01:26] this is what it means by his stripes I
[1:01:29] am healed
[1:01:30] she had a personal revelation for she
[1:01:33] had an experience for it amen
[1:01:35] brother Brian will continue and he says
[1:01:37] now the power of Revelation brings
[1:01:39] stimulation to the believer he says for
[1:01:42] the power of wine natural wine is to
[1:01:45] stimulate see it's to bring a person
[1:01:48] that's all slumped down to a stimulation
[1:01:51] he says well then now there is a power
[1:01:53] of the revelation of the word that gives
[1:01:55] stimulation of Joy to the believer
[1:01:58] stimulation of satisfaction to the
[1:02:01] believer the stimulation that it's
[1:02:03] Vindicated and it's proved he says so
[1:02:06] then the first thing you know it had to
[1:02:08] become a reality
[1:02:10] he's talking about in the upper room
[1:02:13] they waited on their Ministry for the
[1:02:14] word to be Vindicated and when you come
[1:02:17] to seek the Holy Spirit you do the same
[1:02:20] wait for it to be Vindicated he said yes
[1:02:23] you can accept it by faith you have to
[1:02:25] accept Christ by faith that's exactly
[1:02:27] right and you accept the Holy Spirit by
[1:02:30] faith he says but then let the Holy
[1:02:33] Spirit come and give the circumcision as
[1:02:35] a witness that he has accepted your
[1:02:37] faith you see then he points back to the
[1:02:40] abrahamic Covenant he says and see
[1:02:41] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:02:44] to him for righteousness he says but God
[1:02:46] gave him the sign of circumcision as a
[1:02:49] confirmation that he had accepted his
[1:02:51] faith there was something had to happen
[1:02:52] in Abraham's life to reflect the promise
[1:02:55] of God
[1:02:56] to show that his faith had been accepted
[1:02:58] and brother Brian says so that's the
[1:03:00] same thing we must do
[1:03:02] we must wait on the Holy Spirit until
[1:03:05] it's done something
[1:03:07] not necessarily because we spoke in
[1:03:09] tongues not because we've danced or we
[1:03:12] got emotional and we shouted he says
[1:03:14] until we were changed until something
[1:03:18] actually happened I don't care what form
[1:03:22] it comes in just so it happened that's
[1:03:25] the main thing because the danger is is
[1:03:27] that in the presence of God in the
[1:03:29] presence of the holy spirit in the
[1:03:31] atmosphere of a service wherever it
[1:03:33] might be that you get stimulated by
[1:03:35] emotion and you have a shouting
[1:03:37] experience you have a dancing experience
[1:03:39] you have an expression of some sort and
[1:03:41] you believe that is your proof that
[1:03:43] you've been sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:45] don't reject the emotion
[1:03:48] that'll kill a Believer if you can't
[1:03:50] praise God if you can't bask in his
[1:03:51] presence if you can express yourself to
[1:03:54] him but those things might be from God
[1:03:57] but don't stop there is what he's saying
[1:04:00] don't turn it down don't hold it back
[1:04:02] let it flow through you express it
[1:04:04] experience it but he says you accept it
[1:04:06] by faith but make sure you've actually
[1:04:09] been changed before you go around
[1:04:10] claiming you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:15] rest on what a changed life that aligns
[1:04:18] you with the word of God
[1:04:19] not a changed Voice or a freedom in the
[1:04:23] spirit that allows you to shout and
[1:04:24] dance and do these different things
[1:04:25] listen we don't we've got no problem
[1:04:27] with shouting right brother Chad we have
[1:04:30] no problem with shouting you shout as
[1:04:31] much as you want you praise you raise
[1:04:33] your hands you say Amen you do whatever
[1:04:35] you want we're never going to quench
[1:04:37] that
[1:04:38] but when it comes to the Holy Spirit
[1:04:39] you're looking for a changed life that's
[1:04:42] going to be the proof and it's a changed
[1:04:43] life that lines up with the word of God
[1:04:45] because you can have a changed life
[1:04:47] where he cleans your life up where you
[1:04:49] have no guilt over your past sins but
[1:04:50] that's not a changed life that's just
[1:04:52] the first two works of Grace but the
[1:04:53] third one is when he changes your nature
[1:04:55] when he changes your desires when he
[1:04:57] changes how you live your life and the
[1:04:59] things you do from day to day
[1:05:01] now I'm jumping ahead in the scripture
[1:05:03] quickly because he says that there's oil
[1:05:06] olive or olive oil as we would say it
[1:05:08] and we know that oil is a type of the
[1:05:09] Holy Spirit but it was a representation
[1:05:12] of anointing
[1:05:13] and not just anointing but it was
[1:05:15] anointing for purpose and anointing for
[1:05:18] service
[1:05:19] you aren't anointed just to sit
[1:05:22] you're anointed so that you'll be put
[1:05:24] into action and we look at Aaron and the
[1:05:26] priesthood we're Anointed with oil and
[1:05:28] what were that what happened after that
[1:05:30] they were put into action to minister
[1:05:31] for the people David was anointed with
[1:05:34] oil and he was put into action to what
[1:05:36] become the king of Israel and kill
[1:05:37] Goliath in these different things and it
[1:05:39] was pointing to the point out of the
[1:05:41] Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost when
[1:05:43] people would be anointed to go do
[1:05:45] something
[1:05:46] because he said Terry and wait wait on
[1:05:49] your ministry wait on your anointing
[1:05:51] because if you try it before you get
[1:05:53] anointed for service then your service
[1:05:55] will be for not but if you get anointed
[1:05:57] for it then you'll be ready and you'll
[1:05:59] be in sync with God and his purpose and
[1:06:01] it'll put you into action and we see as
[1:06:03] soon as they got Anointed with the Holy
[1:06:05] Spirit they came out and they started
[1:06:07] preaching and three thousand Souls were
[1:06:08] saved that day amen God was promising
[1:06:12] them a land full of anointing
[1:06:15] to put them into action
[1:06:17] to do something and many had Justified
[1:06:19] them when he he took them out of Egypt
[1:06:21] and he'd Sanctified them and separated
[1:06:23] them in the desert but now he's bringing
[1:06:25] them into a land he says you're going to
[1:06:26] be anointed to do something and it's to
[1:06:28] destroy the works of the enemy that's
[1:06:30] what every believer not just the pastor
[1:06:33] not just the ministry not just the men
[1:06:35] not just the fathers not just the
[1:06:36] husbands but every one of us is Anointed
[1:06:39] to destroy the works of Satan first in
[1:06:41] our own lives and then to support the
[1:06:43] destruction of them in the in the in the
[1:06:44] body of Christ and the brothers and
[1:06:46] sisters around us
[1:06:48] now we know that oil is also for healing
[1:06:51] but it represents something more than
[1:06:53] healing and we know the scripture in
[1:06:54] James 5 but just for completeness I'll
[1:06:56] read it it says there's any sick among
[1:06:58] you let him call for the Elders of the
[1:07:01] church and let them pray over him
[1:07:02] anointing him with oil in the name of
[1:07:05] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[1:07:07] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[1:07:09] him up and if he have committed sins
[1:07:11] they shall be forgiven him now brother
[1:07:14] bottom takes us and he says something
[1:07:15] amazing he says why do we anoint the
[1:07:18] sick with oil
[1:07:20] he says we anoint the sick with oil
[1:07:22] because it symbolizes the pouring out of
[1:07:27] the Holy Spirit upon them
[1:07:29] so often we tend to look on laying hands
[1:07:32] and you know maybe I would be her a
[1:07:34] minister would come here and somebody
[1:07:35] comes up and we think that when we come
[1:07:37] and we lay hands on them it's like we're
[1:07:39] bringing something external from them to
[1:07:42] them
[1:07:43] but that's not what we're doing he says
[1:07:45] it's a representation of the pouring out
[1:07:48] of the Holy Spirit upon them amen so
[1:07:51] what we're doing is symbolic of what's
[1:07:52] Happening inside of their life
[1:07:55] and listen when we pray for these people
[1:07:57] we're believing they've got the holy
[1:07:59] spirit in them when we had sister Betty
[1:08:01] come up here I'm pretty sure we believe
[1:08:02] she's got the holy spirit so we weren't
[1:08:04] praying to put the Holy Spirit into her
[1:08:07] we weren't praying to put healing into
[1:08:09] her but he says you anoint with oil
[1:08:11] because it represents the pouring out of
[1:08:13] the Holy Spirit on her within her body
[1:08:16] it's a representation of what's going on
[1:08:18] inside of her that the holy spirit is
[1:08:20] being released that is working to
[1:08:22] restore the person back to their
[1:08:24] god-given place and position and rights
[1:08:26] according to the word of God Amen it's
[1:08:29] moving you back to what God Said was
[1:08:31] yours and it takes the Holy Spirit to do
[1:08:34] that because we wrestle not against
[1:08:35] flesh and blood and that means we're
[1:08:37] wrestling against something that
[1:08:38] requires something beyond the natural
[1:08:40] and that means the Holy Spirit has to be
[1:08:42] working on our behalf
[1:08:44] and I love how if we look at this
[1:08:45] scripture here it says that not only
[1:08:47] will you be healed but he says you'll if
[1:08:49] you've committed any sins they'll be
[1:08:51] forgiven you as well
[1:08:53] how many times did Brother Brown say if
[1:08:55] you come up for prayer he says make sure
[1:08:57] your life is cleaned up make sure
[1:08:59] there's nothing there and you'll see how
[1:09:00] many times did Jesus heal somebody and
[1:09:02] then he'd say thy sins are forgiven thee
[1:09:04] as well because he ties healing with
[1:09:06] forgiveness and when you've got the Holy
[1:09:08] Ghost then you're under the shed blood
[1:09:10] of Christ and he can't see your sins and
[1:09:12] it's separated from you and it never
[1:09:14] holds you back as long as you've
[1:09:16] confessed them amen
[1:09:17] your sins are hidden from God
[1:09:19] but sometimes it struck me when I was
[1:09:21] reading this you know about the pouring
[1:09:23] out of the Holy Spirit and so often we
[1:09:25] look at that anointing with oil and we
[1:09:28] think it's for this physical sick and it
[1:09:29] is and that's where we focus on it we
[1:09:31] know
[1:09:32] but when you look at our lives so often
[1:09:34] our sickness is not of that nature
[1:09:37] I spent an hour and 15 minutes with a
[1:09:39] co-worker today talking about some
[1:09:41] things he's dealing with and most of
[1:09:42] it's up here and most of it's in his
[1:09:45] attitude and these different things and
[1:09:47] listen I can't tell you how many times
[1:09:48] and this is me being honest just in
[1:09:50] front of you where I'm dealing with a
[1:09:52] situation or I'm dealing with a person
[1:09:53] and I say Lord my attitude is horrible
[1:09:58] it's horrible I've got an issue with
[1:10:01] that person I'm grumpy with that person
[1:10:03] I'm not going in with a loving attitude
[1:10:05] I'm not getting anywhere in it and even
[1:10:08] if I think I have the moral High ground
[1:10:10] it's not doing me any good because we're
[1:10:12] not making any progress here and it's
[1:10:14] because my attitude is messed up and I
[1:10:17] need healing for my mind I need healing
[1:10:19] for my Approach physically I'm perfectly
[1:10:22] well but I'm going in and my attitude
[1:10:24] stinks and I say Lord I need you to heal
[1:10:26] something up here so that I can be
[1:10:28] effective out there
[1:10:30] because if I was to work with the people
[1:10:32] in the church and have a horrible
[1:10:33] attitude and to be a you know Elevate
[1:10:36] myself or or these different things then
[1:10:39] I get into trouble every time but I've
[1:10:40] got to be approaching it and looking it
[1:10:42] through the way that God looks at it and
[1:10:44] the way that he approaches these things
[1:10:46] so often my prayer is Lord I know my
[1:10:49] attitude isn't where it needs to be
[1:10:51] and I can't move forward until you fix
[1:10:53] that attitude
[1:10:57] what am I looking for I'm looking to get
[1:10:59] his mind in it I'm looking to get his
[1:11:01] approach his love his patience and if I
[1:11:04] can get that if I can be healed or
[1:11:06] restored to that because that's my
[1:11:07] god-given position is to have the Mind
[1:11:09] increase Christ to have the fruit of the
[1:11:12] spirit the love joy peace patience
[1:11:13] kindness goodness Faith generous
[1:11:14] self-control all these things that is my
[1:11:17] right
[1:11:18] that is my God position that he's given
[1:11:21] me and so I need to be healed back to
[1:11:24] that so many times
[1:11:25] we get tired we get worn out we get
[1:11:27] stressed these things but once he
[1:11:29] touches you and once he pours the oil of
[1:11:32] the Holy Spirit into the situation all
[1:11:34] of a sudden what do we lose
[1:11:36] our bitterness
[1:11:37] our tiredness our frustration our
[1:11:41] discontent all of these different things
[1:11:43] listen You'll find somebody that has the
[1:11:45] Holy Ghost if they've been through
[1:11:47] things tough in their life guess what
[1:11:48] they're not bitter about it anymore
[1:11:50] they can talk about it and say God used
[1:11:52] it I'm over it I've forgiven that person
[1:11:55] but somebody that keeps bringing it up
[1:11:57] what does it show it shows that they're
[1:11:59] lacking the Holy Ghost not that they
[1:12:01] don't have it it's that they've lost the
[1:12:03] fruit and the joy and the peace and the
[1:12:06] rest in these things and they need a
[1:12:07] healing touch they need a pouring out of
[1:12:09] that Holy Spirit on them again
[1:12:11] I'm not saying you can't be hurt I'm not
[1:12:13] saying you can't be offended we've all
[1:12:15] been hurt we've all offended and we've
[1:12:16] been offended
[1:12:18] but I'm saying the Holy Ghost won't let
[1:12:19] you stay there because you've got a land
[1:12:21] full of oil that will heal you
[1:12:23] that will anoint you that will bring you
[1:12:25] out of these things amen
[1:12:28] it makes you realize what the holy ghost
[1:12:30] means to a Believer because it can't be
[1:12:32] a one-time thing
[1:12:33] it's got to be an everyday thing
[1:12:36] a Wellspring springing up within you
[1:12:38] it's got to have a life of its own
[1:12:39] because our life is very limited our
[1:12:42] energy is very limited but there's got
[1:12:43] to be something inside of you we're
[1:12:44] saying about it brother Bob the songs
[1:12:46] were perfect for the service today
[1:12:47] there's a there's a well there's a
[1:12:49] spring there's a River of Life that's
[1:12:51] available inside the believer that can
[1:12:54] keep us going through the tough times
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:58] listen it doesn't mean that Satan's not
[1:13:00] going to put things on us but if you've
[1:13:02] got a spring inside of you boy you you
[1:13:04] can put the biggest rock you want on a
[1:13:06] spring but that pressure will build up
[1:13:07] until it throws that thing off and Satan
[1:13:09] will have to remove out of your life
[1:13:11] again amen
[1:13:12] it reminded me as I was reading about
[1:13:14] the oil and the wine of the Good
[1:13:16] Samaritan and look what he did when he
[1:13:17] came across a man that had been beaten
[1:13:19] broken couldn't help himself just laying
[1:13:21] helpless
[1:13:22] what did he do
[1:13:24] it says a certain Samaritan as he
[1:13:26] journeyed came where he was and when he
[1:13:28] saw him he had compassion on him
[1:13:31] sometimes that's where we've got to
[1:13:33] start
[1:13:34] not sometime every time
[1:13:36] you can't pour in the oil in the wine if
[1:13:38] you don't have compassion
[1:13:39] he says and he went to him and he bound
[1:13:41] up his wounds pouring in oil and wine
[1:13:45] and set him on his own beast and brought
[1:13:47] him to an inn and took care of him
[1:13:51] we anoint someone with oil to represent
[1:13:54] the Holy Spirit working on them I can't
[1:13:55] give you my Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] remember in the in the in the the the
[1:14:00] the parable of the the foolish and the
[1:14:02] wise virgins they said you've got to go
[1:14:04] get your own oil
[1:14:05] I can't give you mine I can tell you
[1:14:07] where to get it I can tell you how to
[1:14:08] get it but I can't give you mine but you
[1:14:11] notice here what happens is that
[1:14:13] sometimes the healing that somebody
[1:14:15] needs starts with you pouring out what
[1:14:18] you have
[1:14:19] and that means humbling yourself
[1:14:20] sometimes that means you may have the
[1:14:22] moral High Ground you may be right in
[1:14:25] and of itself you may be right but
[1:14:27] sometimes you've got to get off the
[1:14:28] moral High Ground if I'm right to get
[1:14:30] down to where they are so you can help
[1:14:31] them
[1:14:32] and that's you humbling yourself for the
[1:14:34] sake of that person that's you pouring
[1:14:36] in love maybe when they don't really
[1:14:38] deserve it or Mercy or Grace or patience
[1:14:40] or these different things and you see
[1:14:42] what this Samaritan did was he took what
[1:14:43] he had and he poured it onto him
[1:14:46] but he didn't just put oil he put in
[1:14:48] wine as well
[1:14:51] I'm jumping slightly ahead as I said in
[1:14:53] the scripture because the scripture
[1:14:54] always ties the oil and the wine
[1:14:56] together and Jesus did it brother
[1:14:57] Branham kept doing it because what
[1:14:59] happened so often is we say well all I
[1:15:01] need is the Holy Ghost
[1:15:03] and you do need the Holy Ghost but what
[1:15:05] he's saying is with the Holy Ghost comes
[1:15:07] stimulation
[1:15:08] if you get the Holy Ghost and nothing
[1:15:10] changes nothing happens you can't Praise
[1:15:12] You Can't Worship You Can't Raise Your
[1:15:14] Hands you can't respond to the word then
[1:15:15] guess what something's wrong because
[1:15:17] there's always wine comes with the oil
[1:15:19] that's what happened the first time
[1:15:21] remember when they were on the day of
[1:15:23] Pentecost they got the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:25] they got plenty of stimulation with it
[1:15:26] didn't they and so in your own life it's
[1:15:28] supposed to be the same thing if you've
[1:15:30] got the oil and nothing's changing
[1:15:33] then what something's missing and I'd
[1:15:36] almost say you don't have the oil yet
[1:15:37] because the oil always brings wine with
[1:15:39] it amen it's to stimulate you it makes
[1:15:42] the word live in you it makes The Word
[1:15:43] Alive remember the letter kill it but
[1:15:45] the spirit giveth life and when it comes
[1:15:47] alive it excites you it brings a
[1:15:48] stimulation it brings those different
[1:15:50] things
[1:15:51] now the thing is if you have wine if you
[1:15:53] have oil without the wine
[1:15:55] then you're just a dead you're a dead
[1:15:57] stick you're just sitting there and
[1:15:58] you're not doing anything but if you
[1:15:59] have wine without the oil and guess what
[1:16:01] you're an overcomer in church and then
[1:16:03] you walk out and you trip home for your
[1:16:04] shoelaces you're all barking no bite you
[1:16:07] don't have the victory but you've got
[1:16:08] lots of stimulation amen and it's
[1:16:10] usually because it's mental because
[1:16:12] we're caught up in the in in the
[1:16:14] doctrine of things rather than than the
[1:16:16] reality of it in our life
[1:16:18] stimulation that makes people do stupid
[1:16:20] things doesn't it
[1:16:22] I mean we're talking naturally when
[1:16:24] people go out and they get a lot of
[1:16:25] stimulation from alcohol they tend to do
[1:16:27] stupid drinks or they do stupid things
[1:16:29] because they're drinking and they try
[1:16:30] and do something that's beyond their
[1:16:32] capabilities
[1:16:33] like stop a car with their hand
[1:16:36] it reminds me of the story maybe you've
[1:16:38] heard of it if there was a there's a
[1:16:40] mouse in a house
[1:16:41] this is
[1:16:43] many many years ago
[1:16:45] it's not a true story
[1:16:47] there's a mouse in a house and they had
[1:16:49] a cat that was constantly chasing him
[1:16:51] around
[1:16:53] and he was always just escaping by the
[1:16:55] skin of his teeth but he was constantly
[1:16:57] worried about whether that cat was going
[1:17:00] to get him
[1:17:01] but one day somebody knocked over a
[1:17:04] glass of wine and it dribbled down and
[1:17:07] it formed a pool inside the mouse's
[1:17:09] little hole in the wall
[1:17:10] and he got a taste of that and he said I
[1:17:13] really like that
[1:17:14] and he drank and drank and drank until
[1:17:18] he got stimulated and then he came out
[1:17:20] of the the little hole in the wall and
[1:17:22] he said
[1:17:23] where's that cat
[1:17:26] that's a stupid Mouse isn't it why
[1:17:28] because he got stimulated without the
[1:17:31] reality of what he was trying to do
[1:17:33] behind him that's what it's like for the
[1:17:34] believer if you're all bark and no bite
[1:17:36] then you're going to get bit pretty
[1:17:38] you're gonna you're gonna get beat up
[1:17:39] pretty quick amen we don't want to be
[1:17:41] like a drunk Mouse
[1:17:43] because that cat's just going to chew us
[1:17:45] up and spit us out isn't it
[1:17:47] amen but if you're full of the Holy
[1:17:48] Ghost you'll be changed listen we don't
[1:17:50] all have to shout we've got different
[1:17:52] Natures we've got different
[1:17:53] personalities in these things we don't
[1:17:55] all have to shout we don't all have to
[1:17:57] dance we don't have to do all those
[1:17:58] things but listen we ought to be able to
[1:18:00] respond to the word of God we ought to
[1:18:02] be able to respond to the presence of
[1:18:04] God in our midst amen and we ought to be
[1:18:06] able to certainly raise our hands and
[1:18:07] say thank you Lord Praise You Lord and
[1:18:10] say Amen to the preaching of the word
[1:18:11] amen listen Satan can't keep down a
[1:18:14] Believer that's got the Holy Ghost let's
[1:18:16] say he can push you and he can press you
[1:18:18] and he can force you up against the wall
[1:18:20] and he can try and suppress these things
[1:18:22] but with that life inside of you he's
[1:18:24] never going to get the victory
[1:18:25] because you don't belong to him anymore
[1:18:28] you've been involved with a price and
[1:18:30] you've been sealed with it and that seal
[1:18:32] is proof that you've been bought and
[1:18:33] he's never going to be able to hold you
[1:18:35] down
[1:18:36] they talk about in Revelation 6 it says
[1:18:38] this is in the third seat he says when
[1:18:40] he had opened the third seal I heard the
[1:18:42] third Beast say come and see and I
[1:18:44] beheld and lo a black horse and he that
[1:18:46] sat on him had a pair of balances in his
[1:18:48] hand
[1:18:49] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[1:18:51] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[1:18:53] penny and three measures of barley for a
[1:18:55] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:18:58] the wine
[1:18:59] so you see how in scripture time and
[1:19:01] time again that the oil and the wine are
[1:19:03] put together and Christ is saying now in
[1:19:06] the in the in the third seal he's saying
[1:19:08] don't touch that oil in the wine
[1:19:11] and he's putting them as a group he
[1:19:13] didn't say don't touch the oil he said
[1:19:15] don't touch the oil and don't touch the
[1:19:17] wine why because the oil is his
[1:19:19] and the wine is his because he's the one
[1:19:22] that gives the Revelation he's the one
[1:19:24] that gives the stimulation he's the one
[1:19:25] that gives the Holy Ghost amen and he's
[1:19:28] saying that's what the oil and the wine
[1:19:30] they belong to me
[1:19:32] these are Gods to give these are Gods to
[1:19:35] hold and so you can't touch them Satan
[1:19:37] you can't hold them back because they
[1:19:39] don't belong to you in the first place
[1:19:40] you can try and suppress it but you
[1:19:43] can't touch it because it doesn't belong
[1:19:44] to you in the first place
[1:19:46] brother Brian would say in wine
[1:19:48] symbolizes stimulation of Revelation oil
[1:19:51] and wine in the Bible is associated
[1:19:53] together always he says I got the
[1:19:55] concordance and looked and there's a
[1:19:56] string of them like that where wine and
[1:19:57] oil goes together all the time he says
[1:19:59] when the truth of a promised word of God
[1:20:02] has been truly revealed to his Saints
[1:20:04] that's filled with oil they all get
[1:20:07] stimulated wine is a stimulation Glory I
[1:20:11] feel it right now stimulated with joy
[1:20:13] and shouts see and when it does it has
[1:20:16] the same effect upon them that wine does
[1:20:19] upon a natural man now most of us
[1:20:21] probably don't know what that is like
[1:20:24] but you do silly things you do things
[1:20:27] that you don't normally do you express
[1:20:29] things in a way you wouldn't normally
[1:20:30] Express when you've had a lot to drink
[1:20:32] I'm told
[1:20:34] he says because when the Revelation has
[1:20:37] been given of a truth of God and the
[1:20:40] True Believer filled with oil and the
[1:20:42] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[1:20:44] becomes so great that he makes him
[1:20:47] behave himself on normally
[1:20:51] listen that's not just in church that's
[1:20:53] not Justin praising and worshiping but
[1:20:55] it makes you happen different it makes
[1:20:57] you live differently out there as well
[1:21:00] talking with this man this co-worker
[1:21:03] today and talking about the changes that
[1:21:05] I've made in my life and this decisions
[1:21:07] I've made with my career and walking
[1:21:09] away from certain things people Marvel
[1:21:11] at that because it's unnatural to walk
[1:21:13] away from money it's unnatural to walk
[1:21:15] away from promotions that's unnatural to
[1:21:17] walk away from ease of life and luxury
[1:21:19] and these different things they don't
[1:21:20] understand it
[1:21:22] they don't understand the Simplicity
[1:21:23] that we seek and the joy we get from the
[1:21:25] lives that we live
[1:21:27] it makes you live and do things
[1:21:29] unnaturally to the to the to the outside
[1:21:32] world Amen
[1:21:34] but they work together and they give you
[1:21:36] and they show you the oil and the wine
[1:21:38] the the Holy Ghost and the revelation of
[1:21:40] the word in your life they work together
[1:21:42] to show you the reality of God and it
[1:21:44] always has an effect on the believer
[1:21:46] amen it makes you stimulate he says it
[1:21:48] makes you happy makes you joyful it
[1:21:50] makes you worshipful why because it's a
[1:21:53] revelation of God to you personally
[1:21:56] personally
[1:21:57] that's why we don't mimic each other in
[1:21:59] church
[1:22:00] because sometimes in the preaching of
[1:22:02] the word it might be for sister Lydia
[1:22:04] and guess what brother kingsley's
[1:22:06] sitting there saying why is Sister Lydia
[1:22:08] over there shouting and dancing
[1:22:10] because she got a personal revelation in
[1:22:12] that and maybe you didn't get it but
[1:22:14] then brother Kingsley will do it and
[1:22:16] somebody's looking at him saying what's
[1:22:17] he talking about what's he so happy
[1:22:18] about well he's got a personal
[1:22:20] revelation as well
[1:22:22] so we don't have to mimic each other
[1:22:25] we don't want to mimic each other
[1:22:26] because each of us is stimulated in
[1:22:28] different ways and with different things
[1:22:29] based on where we're at in our life and
[1:22:31] where our needs are on these different
[1:22:32] things amen but when something strikes
[1:22:35] you we ought to be able to say Amen
[1:22:36] praise the Lord thank you Lord help us
[1:22:39] Lord these different things amen we
[1:22:41] ought to be able to respond to those
[1:22:43] things and worship
[1:22:45] because what we're talking about here is
[1:22:46] your inheritance your land the good
[1:22:49] things that God has laid aside for you
[1:22:51] amen
[1:22:53] I was reading in Exodus in my devotions
[1:22:55] the other morning and I was reading
[1:22:57] about the plans of the Tabernacle and
[1:22:59] God was so specific with the Tabernacle
[1:23:02] and you'll find that that types to us
[1:23:03] because he set up his place of dwelling
[1:23:07] very specifically and it's the same
[1:23:09] thing for us and God cares about us and
[1:23:11] he cares about how we live and how we do
[1:23:13] things and how we dress and what our
[1:23:15] lives look like in these different
[1:23:16] things but we're talking about the oil
[1:23:18] here and he said in Exodus 27 20 thou
[1:23:21] shall command the children of Israel
[1:23:23] that they bring thee pure oil olive
[1:23:26] beaten for the light to cause the lamb
[1:23:29] to burn always this is in Exodus way
[1:23:32] before they're ever going into the land
[1:23:34] of Canaan and listen when you're in the
[1:23:36] land when you're in the desert land
[1:23:38] there's not a lot of olive oil there I
[1:23:41] don't know if you know that but there's
[1:23:42] not a lot of olives in the desert and
[1:23:45] he's saying as part of your worship
[1:23:46] you've got to continuously continuously
[1:23:48] bring me pure olive oil to light the
[1:23:51] lamps
[1:23:53] so he sets this requirement for them to
[1:23:55] to to do what to provide something in
[1:23:58] their worship that he requires
[1:24:00] another walking around in the desert but
[1:24:02] he says when you get to that land you're
[1:24:04] going to have all you need he says I'm
[1:24:06] sending you to a land full of olives
[1:24:08] so now you can bring your portion in and
[1:24:11] you can bring your lamp and you can
[1:24:13] bring your light into the service and
[1:24:15] sister Rebecca can do it and sister
[1:24:16] Selena can do it and brother Bob can do
[1:24:18] it and sister Brenda and each one of us
[1:24:20] has a pure oil that he has supplied to
[1:24:23] us in the land that he's given us and we
[1:24:25] join together and it's a part of our
[1:24:27] worship
[1:24:28] God sets a requirement that you bring
[1:24:30] pure olive oil that you bring pure oil
[1:24:32] for his worship and then he says I'll
[1:24:34] give you a land that will supply the
[1:24:35] very thing that I'm demanding of you
[1:24:37] God's not out to trip us up he's not out
[1:24:39] there to to try and get us to fail but
[1:24:41] when he makes a requirement he gives us
[1:24:43] a land that provides us the very thing
[1:24:44] that he's requiring out of us amen
[1:24:48] so when God says you ought to have this
[1:24:49] or you better have that he'll always
[1:24:51] provide a remedy for it amen so as I
[1:24:54] look through this and as we start to
[1:24:55] close we look at the land he's given God
[1:24:58] have requirements for worship God had a
[1:25:01] requirements for cleanliness God had a
[1:25:03] requirement for sacrificing these
[1:25:05] different things even the pomegranates
[1:25:07] the pomegranates had to be sown onto the
[1:25:08] Hem of the high priest skirt
[1:25:11] they had to have it as part of their
[1:25:12] worship so that he would be acceptable
[1:25:14] in the presence of God so God had all
[1:25:16] these things and he tied what was in the
[1:25:18] land to their worship to their
[1:25:20] acceptance to him and he tied it to
[1:25:22] their everyday needs
[1:25:24] everything that they had need of and the
[1:25:27] good things that would make life better
[1:25:28] for them all of it was provided in there
[1:25:31] so I say that to say this no matter what
[1:25:34] your situation is God has a land
[1:25:36] provided to meet your need
[1:25:39] now remember when he takes them in there
[1:25:41] that doesn't mean that you're never
[1:25:43] going to have a time that you don't have
[1:25:45] a need
[1:25:46] he promised the land that was there that
[1:25:48] had what you need
[1:25:50] but you've got to get it
[1:25:52] and that's the that's that that's what
[1:25:53] we're coming up to is not is it there
[1:25:56] but will you go get it or will we be
[1:25:58] denied As we sing
[1:26:00] well we say I won't be denied I'm going
[1:26:01] to go in and I'm going to take it and
[1:26:03] I'm going to grab what God has for me
[1:26:05] but as we close up on these last two
[1:26:06] scriptures he says this is what this
[1:26:09] land is he says a land wherein Thou
[1:26:11] shalt eat bread without scarceness thou
[1:26:14] shalt not lack anything in it
[1:26:18] what he has given us there's no lack
[1:26:21] there's no shortage there's no rationing
[1:26:23] there's no holding back there's no
[1:26:25] scrimping and saving everything that you
[1:26:27] have is gathered in the land that he's
[1:26:30] given you he said a land whose Stones
[1:26:32] our iron and out of whose Hills thou
[1:26:34] mayest dig breast when thou Hast eaten
[1:26:37] and art full then Thou shalt bless the
[1:26:39] Lord thy God for the good land which he
[1:26:42] hath given thee Jesus said that healing
[1:26:44] is the children's bread and he says in
[1:26:47] this land he says there's no scarcess of
[1:26:49] healing
[1:26:50] there's no shortage of the needs that
[1:26:52] you have in your body and your soul and
[1:26:54] your spirit
[1:26:55] every need that we have is met in the
[1:26:58] land that he's given us amen
[1:27:00] like I said he didn't say you won't lack
[1:27:03] anything
[1:27:04] that you won't feel a need that you
[1:27:06] won't feel hunger but he says everything
[1:27:08] you have need of is already there he
[1:27:10] says and when you get in there and you
[1:27:12] take it over he says there's going to be
[1:27:13] a day when you're full and you can sit
[1:27:15] back and you can say thank you Lord
[1:27:18] Praise You Lord
[1:27:19] there was a fight
[1:27:21] there was a struggle and there was a
[1:27:23] time Gap but in the end I got exactly
[1:27:26] what you said was waiting for me in here
[1:27:28] and that's the test of our faith is will
[1:27:30] you hold on until the time that you can
[1:27:32] say taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:27:34] I've tasted and I've seen that the Lord
[1:27:37] is good amen just if we could have the
[1:27:39] musicians come up
[1:27:40] as we close
[1:27:43] amen like I said these are types and
[1:27:45] parallels we can stand together if we
[1:27:46] would
[1:27:47] these are types and parallels and we've
[1:27:49] already kind of touched on some of these
[1:27:51] things but next service we want to go
[1:27:52] into what is our Promised Land what is
[1:27:56] our inheritance what does it look like
[1:27:57] when we as Believers two thousand years

[1:28:02] promised us and what is it that we're
[1:28:04] going to be walking into amen let's just
[1:28:06] bow our heads together

[1:28:29] be Warriors we want to be Faithful
[1:28:30] Servants Lord that'll stick with it and
