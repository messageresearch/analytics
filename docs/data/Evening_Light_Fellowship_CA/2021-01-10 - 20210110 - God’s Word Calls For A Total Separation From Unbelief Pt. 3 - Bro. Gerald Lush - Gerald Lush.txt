Jesus graceous we commit ourselves into your care for the going forth of your word Lord Grace Grace Grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and amen now I believe now I believe now I believe all things are possible now I believe amen I believe God that we believe his word amen amen [Music] hallelujah amen all [Music] things amen praise the Lord hallelujah God bless you turn with me to Genesis 11 amen and we'll endeavor ever by grace to read the scripture move on and to finish the the thoughts of the message concerning a total separation from unbelief amen and of course he included in the title The reason because God's word calls for it amen and it's still calling for it and the closer we get to the resurrection closer we get to the Rapture brother the separation from unbelief becomes greater amen we're just getting out of this world Amen goodbye amen just we trust by by grace that we're going to meet some of you again in the other dimension but for the most no amen so the grace of God be with us brother amen that what God requires for the resurrection and Rapture a total separation from unbelief amen a total separation from the world the things of the world Amen so that we're not caught up with the world on to many getting caught up with that Rapture no no we want to get caught up with the Rapture and glory amen out of this world and into the kingdom of God one it's going to be wonderful as I mentioned I believe in Wednesday service that that we're I'm longing to get there because why I want to get into a world where there's nothing negative and where everything is positive amen praise the name of the Lord there are no wrong thoughts no wrong Deeds no wrong actions or reactions amen there's absolutely no sin Amen brother we don't we won't have to wrestle with what's going on in the mind no no it'll be all under his control it be the Holy Ghost with us yes but praise God it be the Holy Ghost in US amen not only that but brother we not we're going Beyond adoption to into the Revelation that we are not adopted Sons but the true sons of God in eternity oh right here it's adopted oh yeah we're experiencing adoption yeah by the of God by the new birth but we're going to get in there where there's going to be an absolutely new body glorified body amen nothing there nothing there to testify of sin or of the world we're getting out of Amen it's you know what he's looking for not you to come in say oh I remember this I don't brother I don't think we're going to remember anything not not concerning this old world definitely not oh no not but again as I said there's a certain church that believes that oh you know the dead are just over there and they're in the in in the grave during the funeral or in the cemetery no they're not physically they are because God prophesied it God said dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou return amen the physical part of you that's born in sin but brother we get out of this and into a glorified body we're sin no sin amen so God help us brother and sister oh my it's it's get to get into that world again nothing negative there are no no questions when it comes to govern by doubt not by any means or it's going to be tremendous and make no one of the props that he'd be there singing Amazing Grace amen and it's why because it's by God's love projected Grace Grace projected Faith amen so there's too often people are taking scripture out of context and as I said again or they say Where Oh by the grace of God we're saved oh just by the grace oh yeah just by the grace of God he did it he did it he did it yeah but he it was his Divine love that projected Grace and what does Grace Project Grace projects Faith Amen to get you back amen praise the Lord and Grace projects amen listen we're remembering this remembering that when we get over there we'll know it but and we won't remember about this world why because the dead know not anything again like I said that's what that person belonging to a certain Church told told me you know they they said all the dead know nothing they're just gone on and and so on they're out there in the in the in the cemeteries no no I said not by any means I said what happened like I said what happened to the to the Rich Young Ruler he lifted up his eyes in Hell being in torment amen that's right the grace of God brother but I said Lazarus was in the in the bosom of Abram oh she said he must have some bosom I said yes it's eternal life but again they don't believe it oh so God help us brother that when we go we're not going to a place of Torment oh thank God for that hallelujah we're going to a place of Peace amen where there's absolute Rec contentment yes and love and pure love amen you want have to wonder what what will this one do what will that one do no no we'll know by the grace of God and we're getting there by grace and to get there God God requires separation amen a separation amen and a hunger and a thirst to get there amen but the more we hunger the more we thirst the greater the separation becomes between you and the world and the things of the world Amen so God's grace be with us and God help me I just I don't want to get just go on and on with the scriptures but I I would like to share with you again some of the thoughts that the that God has given us through the prophet of the hour amen and again we're not worshiping the prophet we're worshiping God Amen we're not acknowledging just of the ideas of a prophet we're acknowledging the revelation of the word amen by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord in Genesis 11 and let's start to read at verse 31 we could read more of this but to get more time just to share with you some of the thoughts that God Amen see there's a written word and then there's a revealed word so we want to get into some of the the things that God has revealed to us in these last days amen and Tara that was Abram's father he took Abram his son and lot the son of Aaron his son son and Sarah his daughter in-law and his son Abram's wife and they went forth with them from the earth of the Cales to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Aaron and dwelt there and the days of terara were 205 years and Tara died in Haron God bless his word you may be seated and keep Genesis to Genesis CH 12 amen full obedience to the word brings us the total separation amen the more and more we're subject to the word the more and more we put our control under God's God's power God's anointing God's love the greater that we are experiencing separation from the world and the things of the world Amen and brother if there's ever an hour that we needed that anointing it's the hour that we're living now because people are getting caught up with this and caught up with that all that's going on in the world and concerning the covid-19 issues and you you got to do this you got to do that in the eyes of man but what do we have to do in the eyes of of God Amen man is looking for us to obey this and Obey that but what is God looking for what does God want to see in you what does God want to see in me in in considering in in the light of all that's going on in the world the world is cut up with what's going on the world has cut up with the covid-19 issues and the world has cut up fighting one another to try to try to get the influence this one influence that one Amen to do what what they feel that they should do to prevent this disease from spreading around the world again and to prevent it from getting worse than what it is now well brother sister God Allelujah God has done what he's done Amen to put our attention in in eternity and to put our attention on what he's doing amen and that so that we're not going to put our attention on what man's doing but what God has done what God is doing and what God will do amen praise the Lord because in what he has done we have the example of God we have the testimony of God we know what God is like we know what he how he talks we know how he expresses himself amen and so we're entering into it what he's doing and then believing what he's going to do but again if you're going to if you're going to catch what he's going to do you got you got to have the revelation of what he's done and what he's doing amen because if you don't then you're not going to recognize him when he moves on the scene in the Final Phase so God help us to recognize God in the word God in in the written word God in the revealed word amen and brother brother believing that Allelujah is giving us the faith to be part of what God will do praise the Lord Allelujah we're just moving on and on and on and on to the Rapture on and on to the resurrection amen but amen God is allowing all these things to happen and it's going to distract the unbeliever it's going to distract the make Believers they're going to get partially caught up with that again understanding the message that the prophet of God preached concerning the three kinds of Believers and he said but and and again thank God for the understanding that they all they're all under a genuine anointing but he said the their unbelief and their make belief he said amen is manifested in their false teachings amen so I Oh I thought they had a false anointing and there are some that do have that false anointing they have that devil the devil's anointing on him to do this and this and this amen yet Satan's anointing is religious that's right he knows the word he knows what God has said he knows what God is is doing he knows what God will do and that's why as the Bible says he has come down with great wrath he knows his time is short well if he knows his time is short the bride ought to know that her time is short amen if it give the devil that Faith what faith ought it to give Believers Amen brother if and and oh yes it's producing this these works in the devil and oh the devil's going to do this the devil's going to do that oh yeah and he and he's going to make things worse and so on and he has great wrath oh is the devil amen but brother I tell you this if if that's in the negative what is God doing in the positive amen amen Amen brother the bright is not going to have great wrath the Bri is going to have great faith amen and and and and she's not going down she's going up praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so let God help us that we're going to keep in the the faith we're going to stay in the faith the faith is going to control us not Us control the faith amen there's too many trying to control the faith and you'll do this when this is all right when that is all right when that is all right but Believers are just moving on by faith amen the revelation of what God has done what God is doing what he will do brother the is living for it amen it it just absolutely controls the bride Amen brother we're we're we're considering the scriptures were concerned in the word amen it is written it is written it is written thus say the Lord see again I said Jesus went through that that time of Temptation in the in the up in the wilderness there what for to give us an example how how that we ought to face Temptation and now that we deal with temptation amen how did he face it how did he deal with it with his word amen and he he didn't he wasn't going to add to his word it was the word that that doesn't change the same yesterday today and tomorrow amen by the grace of God and so when the enemy said this he said yeah but it's written and the enemy said well what about this he said well it's written see didn't have to add to it he just had to give it the way that God said it the way that he had said it amen through His prophets this is absolutely amazing so I pray the grace of God brother that we have the anointing of the Holy Ghost to recognize that enemy that's down with great great wrath and I'll tell you he's right there and as he's the first one in the church that's right what's he there for he's there to control your thoughts he's there to try to turn you around and he's there to to get you to oh well to compromise don't you well don't take that too too serious you don't have to worry with that brother I think we do I think we we need to take it more serious the things of God Amen let's not just say oh well praise the Lord you know well we know that's going to happen and this is going to happen all these things are going to take place and so on yeah yeah but what it's going to affect the world but it's also going to have an effect on the elect of God on the seed of God Amen so what effect is it is it making us more spiritual is it causing us to call on the Lord more brothers so what effect is all this having on you what effect is it having on on many of the Believers around the world and again I I I don't feel it's having the the the the the the influence or the effect that God wants us to have that God want wanted it to have it but he knows he's going to see it in the elect he's going to see it in the true seat of God Amen he's going to see it in the True Believers because they're going to stay under the right anointing and they're going to stay in the right teaching by the grace of God and you're not going to add to the teaching not going to take away from the teaching brother it's you that's that believes it and it's feeding on it by the grace of almighty God but yet there's too many too many so-called Believers brother I tell you they're going the church and they hear this preach and they hear that preach and that this and oh I believe this I believe that but they're going out there and living the same kind of life that the people in denominations are living that's the truth the only the only difference is oh oh yeah well they're they're Pentecostal they're Salvation Army they're this oh yeah but I I'm a believer I'm a message believer and I go to this church I go to that church but amen they're just churchy that's all and they're religious amen and and they know that they're going to we got church on a on a Wednesday and on a Sunday like one time I said we always at it Sunday morning and Sunday evening and one of the sister's here I don't know if she would want want me to say mention her name but she said she hope we get back to two services on Sunday yeah so what what what if you don't what do you want what are you going to do with the time amen what are you going to do with the dime oh well we all we need is just one service what one service brother probably God did iight somewhere that one day he said we want to meet every night oh yeah when we consider all that's going on we want to meet every night and brother now the rules are that we can't do that the rules are you just just got to have so many meat and so many do this so many do that oh yeah and it's going to get worse and worse and worse so what is see God Amen God's allowing that to happen and he's watching the result the the the the results of the world out that they're feeling what they're doing the reactions of the world out there amen oh he knows but now he's also seeing our reaction amen considering all that's going on oh the world is acting and reacting this way acting and reacting this way they're getting all caught up with what's going on naturally in the world but what about the bride amen is she is she getting caught up with that or is she getting more and more and more spiritual and more and more caught up with the promise of the resurrection and the promise of the Rapture I tell you too many Believers are just casual Just Let It Go on yeah well they'll acknowledge it as as being judgments in the world Amen but they're not getting they're not getting more spiritual they're just religious they keep on going but we believe this we believe that no brother sister if you really believe it you'll have a hunger for it you'll have a thirst for it and you and you want more and more to get together with the Believers and and talk about it Amen to see if there's something that somebody's going to say to increase our faith amen and somebody's going to explain something amen not concerning oh this is going on there that's going on there no let's let's be more and more and more sensitive to what's going on in our souls amen are we getting more spiritual and and I tell you this if if you're getting more and more spiritual amen and recognizing what God is doing amen and you're believing Hallelujah you're believing like the devil oh time is short time is short we're getting closer to the Rapture amen the devil's going to try to influence you to get away from that not to put too much emphasis on it oh yeah but if you're elect of God and if he's in control you're going to put more and more emphasis on it and you're going to be constantly looking for the for looking for the resurrection looking for the Rapture Lord is getting close please don't let me miss it Amen brother it ought to do it to us considering what the prophet of God said that there might be a dozen Out of Africa oh yeah amazing so what how many is going to come out of Canada how many's coming out of out of out of America considering all that's going on in America now oh yeah brother I tell you it's going to get less and Le he said that's scripture that's the word it ought to put us on our guard brother it ought to create a greater hunger and thirst to make sure that we're going to be part of the Resurrection part of the Rapture amen by the grace of God when we consider all the these things amen so brother God help us amen that we're going to be more spiritual less religious amen more spiritual and definitely not political amen why we're going to focus more listen we see someone says this is going on oh my that's right oh Lord it'll bring you back to the word yeah oh Lord now what what else is there what's what's left to come now Lord Lord we know that that there's not much time and that we're going to be there for the Rapture amen but again he warned us he warned us concerning the very very few Saints living Saints that'll go into Rapture amen Grace To Us brother God help us brother that we're going to live for it amen morning noon and night amen that what we can't I tell you if you got the Holy Ghost you won't be able to get away from it you you can't shake the thoughts away just like the people out in the world there they they they get up in the morning and they're thinking this thinking Natural Things thinking about what's going on in the world and all that but how many are getting up in the morning still thinking about the Rapture how many still thinking about the resurrection how many really believe it oh yeah not just a religious Doctrine but a really really believe in a prophecy concerning the resurrection and the Rapture not many so brother as I've been as I've said going through the day praying Lord please don't leave me behind Amen brother I believe that should be the attitude of Believers when you're going through the world Amen you're going to work you're going to education you're doing this you're doing that and and and you're very conscious of what's going on around the world in the natural and so on with the devil's Works amen but I tell you this you're going to be constantly constantly calling on the Lord don't leave me behind amen because again there's going to be a generation left looking for the Rapture they said you it's already happened and you didn't know it is that you is that me that the Rapture is happening and we're not conscious of it but I tell you God's going to reveal it to us by faith amen and what he has done in these last days through the ministry of William brandham amen well God took him off the scene why because there was too much emphasis on him oh yeah cuz as I said there that series that he preached and and that brother put that note in his pocket William brandom is my lord well he got up and read the note and he said I can't I can't he said stay do this he said to do that he said that would make me Antichrist yeah and he felt that if they if they continued with that that he was going to he was going to leave the ministry yeah so brother sister I pray Grace brother if they they had that revelation they had that idea oh Willam brand was Lord no no brother but but the bride recognizes the Lord was in his ministry amen it wasn't Willam brandom it was Jesus amen and again the prophet of God said he said that's that's the problem he said he said you don't see the other Angel they saw William brandom but they didn't see the other Angel amen they didn't see really the pillar of fire and that wasn't William brandom that was God amen they didn't see the cloud of angels when it com when I say see I mean have the revelation of it that's right again science don't can't explain that because it's too high too far up amen they said no there's no Cloud up there but they did recognize or they did acknowledge that it was there amen and the P of God said there he is in the cloud he said looking down on us amen so brother he's here to get us he's here to take us back amen so brother when oh yeah when we get out of this Dimension de then we're going to look for the then we're going to look for the this Jesus amen because he's going to be he's going to come back Amen in the Rapture he's going to come back in that body of Flesh amen that glorified body amen how many he's looking for it God help us amen that we're going to have a the faith the faith that God was working on to give us right again it was a brother that told brother brandom he said brother and that brother's gone on and he said brother bradam he said where's the Rapture he said surely after after all that you have God has done in these last days surely said the Rapture is not far amen but B of God again knew that many were going to miss the Rapture oh yeah they got a Doctrine there's a lot of churches out there with this doctrine of the Rapture the Lord the the dead in Christ shall rise first we which are alive remain to be come together with them to meet the Lord in the air amen a lot of them they got an intellectual in their heads but that's it they don't have the spiritual experience of a new birth amen they're not new creatur amen thought that's where they come from and that's where they're going they're going home praise the name of the Lord amen God help us in Genesis chapter 12 again I'm going to have to just read the scripture and go back to what God told us through the messenger of the age and brother see what God did is ordained to give us faith oh yeah as I let me say it again what G God did in Luther and preached through Luther was ordained to give him that faith of justification and the same with other ministering Brethren down Through the Ages and it was Wesley we know when there was Salvation Army and the Pentecostal and so on and uh I don't remember the brother's name he was a black brother that God used in the Pentecostal Revival yeah in California I think yeah so it was him and I understood too that I tell you it was God in the brother God controlling the brother because it was to the place where he would stand in the pet with a box over his head and pray yeah praying brother that's brother he was convinced of something oh yeah he knew it and he and he knew that that's what we needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit he was crying for it he was praying for it until finally amen God God honored it amen and they went around the world preaching it by the grace of God and brother so they recognize that do we recognize what God has been doing since because the Pentecostal Revival started and then Pentecostal Revival went into denomination amen but God kept moving on the scene amen with the revelation of his word oh there were there were a number of Messengers going down through the Pentecostal age right on into the I got a chart that I drew and to explain to you what happened in in this time what happened that that year this year that year what was God doing amen what's God doing now and I thank the Lord that that our brother is gone on now but our brother that uh he he sang A Hymn during the church church or the Seven Seals he was brother Ram was preaching the Seven Seals and during one service there before brother Bram came to the pulpit to preach on another issue cuz concerning the seals that this brother got up and sang and brother Brown got commented on that he that was a blessing to him amen and uh I think that brother was also a ministering brother and I did uh he did see the chart that I drew in in the United States and he said brother excellent he said that's exactly the truth and he said but he said one just one place he said I would change there and he said right here and he told me and I I changed it and he said so he good he said that that's good he said that's exactly the Revelation he said what God has done through the Pentecost or right on yeah from the Pentecostal Revival right on up now to the bride Revival amen and the prophet of God did say it's not going to it won't seem like a Revival that's right the bride no because all all the revivals were noisy but the bride Revival is be still and know that I am am God Amen so he it's going to it's going to get more quiet when it comes to the bride Revival and he is highlighted a number of things in in in even in the message I believe it was ashamed 1965 because he also mentioned 1965 concerning total separation and I want to share with you a thought that he preached in 1961 concerning total separation he knew God separated the prophet from all the other ministering Brethren why they got to the place they wanted the signs they wanted the Wonders but they didn't want the word that's amazing yeah when they would approach him and tell them stop preaching this Don't Preach that they won't but they want him to get up and just talk with the Lord and then then show the gifts amen yeah what about the word because all that amen whatever God does in signs and wonders is to point you to the word bring you back to the word amen I trust by the grace of God brother it's having the effect on us concerning the Rapture and the resurrection again let me say it that he it it affected the devil and it give him Faith what faith is it giving you go Grace Genesis 12 and verse one and the Lord has said unto Abram get thee out of thy country yeah God requires separation get the out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show thee amen God called for a separation there God's calling for a separation in your life and mine Amen to show unto us what he's doing and where we're going amen and he said separate yourself from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show thee and brother what God required there requires of Abraham's seed separate from thy father's house from thy Kindred and onto a land that I will show thee in the revealed word oh yeah so there separation how many of us are able to do it how many of us are able to deal with it how many of us are able to allow God to separate us as he was instructing Abraham yeah Grace and he said I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing amen I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen it's go go to another scripture Amen to J 1 John Chapter 2 1 John Chapter 2 praise the Lord and let's read from this SE oh my it's tremendous let start with verse one my little children these things write I unto you that ye sin not amen and God did the same thing in this hour the revelation of the word to stay with the word that we sin not amen that we not disbelieve God amen and be careful what is what is the sin for which there is no forgiveness blasphemy yes amen and he says what what is blasphemy they think oh if you do this you do that you do that or that that's that's sin and and and you won't be forgiven for it no probably God to thank God for the revelation of that amen the sin that is there's no forgiveness is to what is to see what the the Holy Ghost is doing God through the Holy Ghost is doing and call it the devil and he you call it the devil he said there's no forgiveness in this world or the world to come amen and there are those many many so-called Christians they look at this group and that group well that's the devil that's the devil no it's not it's God be careful because if you're going to call God the devil call the Holy Ghost the devil there be no forgiveness you better be careful what you say Amen so he If any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and it does say somewhere but people take it out of context and say that you know Believers and Christians they don't sin no they don't sin habitually or they don't have the hunger and The Thirst to do it but there there is a Temptation that the devil try to get you into sometimes to fall here and to fall there and you do it but again you're not going to go and practice in habitually and live for it live for it no no no you're fighting it you're fighting it and sometimes you stumble other times it the devil stumbles amen Grace because he said If any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propip for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world Amen and thereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments amen and to keep his Commandments we're going back Beyond Ten Commandments it is the word amen and he that sayith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him amen my God have mercy on us because there's many out there professing to be Believers and professing to be Christians but there their lives don't measure up with the word amen they're religious but they still want to do this and do that do what they want to do but not what God wants them to do that's right grace verse five who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected and brother to keep the word of God to stay with the word of God we've got to have a total separation from the world and the things of the world Amen and verse six says he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked that's a challenge are you going to walk and live as Jesus did if you if you're looking for the Rapture looking for the resurrection you got to walk and live as Jesus did oh yeah praise the Lord and He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which he had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning amen and the new again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth amen and he that saith he is in the light and aeth his brother is in darkness even until now amen he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him and don't let's focus on our spiritual brothers and sisters amen and there's there's so-called Believers Christians that they they look down their noses at another Christian oh yeah don't do that you love them amen and you're concerned for them oh yeah what do you do you pray for them pray for that brother pray for that sister amen even as you need prayer you want you need someone to pray for you and I and if you're seed of God God got somebody predestinated to pray for you yes that's right oh yes there's somebody praying for you God help us amen but he that eth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that Darkness has blinded his eyes amen I tell the dead devil coming down with great wrath is there to try to get us to hate one another oh yeah dislike one another look put you down no brother the the the Bible said let the strong support the weak oh yeah if you feel that this brother's not to do this well that's all right you just encourage that brother sister amen with the faith that God has given you and you got to have a right spirit and right attitude and it's the spirit and the attitude of divine love amen God help us I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one praise I pray God grace that we have overcome the Devil he's not going to deceive us no I write onto you little children because ye have known the father it's a it's a spiritual family this is what Pete this is what John is emphasizing a spiritual family of which we're a part we are brothers and sisters in Christ amen I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning and I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one praise the Lord amen love not the world all right we're not talking about just NE what we refer to as sinful things it could be just things out there that that the world is accepted and invented and whatever oh I like this I like that well love not that and and there's too many Believers putting their emphasis all on those things of the world there and they want it more and more and more well God's going to God's going to take it all away oh yeah that's another way God's going to try try our faith oh yeah are you going to be are you going to be content with this much or do you really want the lord to bless you with this there's too many focusing on this yeah again like the ministering brother we had here and that some years ago and he told us about that brother in his church that's a millionaire but he said you'd never know it CU he don't act like it you don't boast with this and this and that and he says like I said he said after service he said oh he he loved Fellowship he said and talk with the word and he he he'll go and he said he'll fellowship with the the lowest somebody we think oh it's not not very not very you know KN knowing the message knowing this knowing that but he said uh oh but he said he'll go over to him he's the poorest he's poor he's got less he's not intellectual he's just simple and humble and he said but he said that millionaire he said he always going to sit down and fellowship with him God help us amen consider he knew Jesus fellowship with and yet he was the king of kings and Lord of lords amen oh praise the Lord he could do this he could do that again it's like the the the himym I have on my computer there and it says you know that he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free amen but he died alone for you and me amen he saw upon the tree for you and me yes yeah thank god brother look at yourself in the mirror of the word that'll humble you you say Lord you you did that for me you suffer that from me brother I believe when he said Lord forgive them they know not what they do brother I don't think he was just talking to them he was talking to you and me that's oh yeah cuz we we we crucified him that's what put him on the cross was was you and me he had to If he if he didn't do that he knew there'd be no Redemption yeah but he he did it to redeem us he did it to pay the price for your sins that's why now that no man can lay a charge against God's elect because of the price that Jesus Paid amen amen let's believe amen let's let's be really sincere in our faith and in our love to him brother Divine love projected that faith by grace and brother this Divine love in us is going to receive it and humble us amen God help us amazing love not the world I don't care what's out there and now there there's more and more and more stuff getting invented and then remember is Satan doing the inventions to to get your attention to distract you from God from the word oh yeah that's why the problem of God highlighted it in the scripture when God did this when God did that he judged them and he sent this among them he what what did he do he said he destroyed their inventions man so brother don't love the world don't love the inventions and they're they're they're inventing this and inventing that and brother I'll be honest it's a there's a lot of Believers so-called Christians are attracted by those things amen but where is God in Simplicity don't be looking for all these big things look for the simple amen just think God was so simple 2,000 years ago and A Man Called Jesus that the that the the Jews never recognized him oh no they said no he's not this he's not that you they accused him of they accused him of being born of fornication oh yeah not not not a virgin birth but they felt it was it was fornication yeah no but he he he bore that sin he bore it to just the shame of it for us he endured it all for us oh to think what they did to him what they said to him and brother he could he could have spoke the word and and killed him huh could have all died but he didn't do it he humbled himself humbled himself humbled himself and even even when when they he told the disciples that what was going to happen in Jerusalem and so on and then when he he got to the place where he was going down to Jerusalem Peter tried to stop him no no no we don't want you to do that and Jesus said get thee behind me he didn't say Peter he said get the behind me Satan brother let's not come under Satan's influence when our in our thoughts in our motives and our objectives but let's let's let let the Holy Ghost have the influence amen that whatever we do say it's for the glory of God keep your spirit right your attitude right amen so again love not the world neither the things that are in the world how many of us love the world love the things that are some of the things that are in the world well there's a lot of Believers that cut up with the world cut up with the things of the world yeah God's grace to us and it's not necessarily again let me remind you don't read the scripture and think or is this just talking with the sinful things where the Bible says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and so on don't don't do this don't do that that's the devil yeah but there are things out there that that that were attracted to Natural Things you know it could be your house yeah it could be your vehicle yeah and again that brother that gave brother Brandon the catalac gave him a Cadillac yes it was a gift to him and brother bam he would not drive that Cadillac around Jeffersonville no way because he felt they would think him too high or too rich or whatever and so on oh that's what he wants the money for and so on no he wouldn't drive the Cadillac around Jeffersonville and I understand that he did allow brother George Smith I think to drive it when he was sort of courting brother R's daughter Rebecca and uh and our brothers given the testimony at the time when he they went out and driving and they maybe went into a restaurant or something this and this and this and they come back to to bring sister Rebecca and the car back and when he looked in the rearview mirror oh who's that somebody was following him and it was brother Brandon he followed them amen and and he WR right back to his home again praise the Lord so God was in control of brother Brandon amen so the Lord help us don't love the world nor the things that are in the world Amen and there's lot there's a lot out there that the devil is using to attract our love oh yeah you you'll love this you'll like this you like that yeah but no I love Jesus better we love the things of God better we love the word better I tell you I love Heaven the new Heaven and new earth and I'm longing to get there amen that's true if you're baptized by the Holy Ghost you're you're born again yeah that's what you're going to focus on where you come from why you're here where you're going amen not I've seen a lot of religious people but they're not focusing on Glory they not focusing on the kingdom of God they're not focusing on eternal life and the new body no no they're focusing on this world more than the world to come because they like this they want to do this they want to do that God help us or oh yeah sometimes the devil gets into others and and and they'll praise praise that person and bless that person oh you're good you do this you do that oh he's he's tried that with me many times over the years the different jobs that I've done oh yeah but we'll give the glory to Jesus yeah and again as I said when I worked in that restaur when i r a department store and uh and they were looking for something oh my they says uh Mr L we can't find this where is it we've been looking for it and we need it we need it within a certain period of time and they were sort of amazed at me that I was so calm with it and they said what's wrong with you I said nothing I said I'm looking for it and I said I said where it is I said the Lord will show us oh but they weren't considering the Lord they were considering just themselves you know and so on and and just not long after that just a few minutes after that oh we got it I said I told you you're going to get it yes that's right Amen brother I tell you let God be in control regardless of the job you got amen amen let's give the glory to Jesus amen so he said love not the world nor the things that are in the world and if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and brother again we're referring to Divine love not F you love agape love you understand that's the love that God's looking for is agapa love not filio filio is human love agape love is divine love it is God's love amen how many of us really manifest that how many how many of us got that recognition from others out there friends the same they had William Brown they said if there's anything you knew about William Bram when you met him he said you knew he loved you even though he didn't say this didn't say that just his attitude his Spirit he said was was love Yeah amazing so would they say that about you your attitude your spirit it's like a certain sister one time was talking a certain Lady of a certain church was talking to my mother on the phone concerning the attitude of a of of well it was a Believer supposedly believing this message oh yeah and uh and she was saying St Stella oh my she I can't bear that when they come and visit me and they say this and they say that and say that oh there's something wrong somewhere you know and my mother said oh she said don't worry about that and and she said oh and that person is not really showing you what they believe because she said my son she said Jal and his wife she said they believe it and she said oh my but she said their spirit is so different from that other one that you're dealing with see there there are believers that that Christians like and they reverence you respect you and there's Believers that they don't like oh yeah because they got a really got a religious spirit and you're there to force this and force that and force something else oh no she said she said she said my son and and and daughter-in-law is not like that she says they have a nice spirit and a nice attitude and she said they're always there to help you yeah and and by the way that was the that was the lady that that my mother saw when she was going beyond the curtain of time yeah as I said that and that lady was already gone on but she appeared to my mother when my mother was on her way praise the Lord oh brother God help us to be spiritual amen yes brother I tell you to be spiritual you have to have a separation from unbelief yeah and brother God help us to win the rapture we got to have a total separation from unbelief amen we are absolutely cut off from all the things of the world Amen and you you are with Him amen you walk with him talk with him amen by the grace of God he's in control amen you're not controlled by this world you're controlled by the world to come amen for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life see Satan is attracting our attention through what we see and feel and smell and hear amen he says the pride of life is not that's not of the father but is of the world and the world passed away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen and amen amen amen so he that is I tell you if you're doing the will of God you're totally separated from unbelief you believe God and before the prophet of God preached the message in January 64 it was in January or not January but April of 61 1961 he was preaching on Abraham and his seed after him and he was exting that God Amen had called for a total separation in Abram's life and I could have taken took the scriptures this morning concerning Abraham and Genesis but again it would take another hour or so to indicate God calling for a total separation from unbelief whether it was Abraham having to separate from his father where Abraham having to separate from lot amen it was it was as long as as long as he was dealing with his natural father Amen brother yeah God didn't deal with him didn't deal with Abram but when Abraham's father died God called Abraham up and he said now Abraham I want to show you this this is what I'm going to do for you and he said I want you to do this amen God was calling for a total separation from unbelief in Abraham's life amen and brother but the issue there was another issue concerning this the unbelief of his father and the unbelief of that one or somebody else brother he also had an issue with lot amen and God had to had to wait till he and lot separated and God allowed this to happen that to happen What for to bring a separation between Abraham and lot and I could go on further to show you other things that God had to separate Abraham from but Abraham he did at one point there he did this he worshiped God he made an altar made a sacrifice oh yeah and God blessed him but he eventually left that area and he went on somewhere else and God had to bring him back to that area where he had where he had offered made made the sacrifice where he had made the altar amen when God brought him back the altar was still there and this was still there amen but see Abraham being caught up in the flesh he began to go here and go there but God wanted him to get back there total separation from unbelief amen he had to separated him from lot now he was there to help lot and anytime that lot needed needed help what Abraham and his his men as it were went down to to deliver him but again God wouldn't allow lot to come up and and and and be in that constant fellowship with Abraham no no because God knew what was in lot's heart and when God did bring lot out of it and his wife turned and look back don't look back for what you came out of amen we could bring it again we could preach again on all these things but what what what lot lot did and what his wife did yeah remember Lot's wife amen so as Believers we need to if God has brought us out let's keep on going don't stop and look back no no oh maybe I should do this maybe I should that no you keep on going follow his leadership in your life let him do what he wants to do in your life by the grace of almighty God amen amen amen but there's too many believers they make those decisions but not God oh yeah they think well the Lord led me to do this leted me do that what was it for his glory or yours was it for his good or yours amen and it's unfortunate that many they consider what they want to do not what God wants them to do brother whatever you do you got to do for the glory of God amen and brother if if if it's a job no matter what it is you're doing Do It For the Glory of God Amen again as the as I said the brother that the brother that came to me in my in my

the grace of God they respected me and I gave God the glory and if you give God the glory oh yeah you you you'll cause them to respect you amen because God said to Abram he said I I'll bless them that bless you he said I'll curse them that curse you yeah not that Abram wanted it but God that's God's God's word word that's the will of God God help us amen so brother go all down through the scriptures you'll find that God calls for a total separation from unbelief you go to Genesis and start reading and come right down up through to the prophets and Abram and Moses and so on and God was would separate from unbelief amen I tell you God still requires it amen as he did with them he'll do with you and me and in 1961 moving forward to the message on separation a total separation not a partial separation a total from unbelief and he said in this message in 1961 and what was he me ministering on the subject was Abraham and his seed after him that's you and me and he said so now it's by grace that God called you not what you did he said what you could do what you will do and if you're the Seed of Abraham God spoke to you by his Amazing Grace amen I can assure you that is the truth you're here because of God's Amazing Grace why because we were all born in sin yeah shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen denying it so if you're the Seed of Abraham God spoke to you by his Amazing Grace just like he did Abraham in the 12th chapter of Genesis and now he said then notice notice as soon as Abraham believed God by by justification Believing on the Lord we are Justified immediately he said immediately he said God called Abraham but he said God called Abraham to a total separation from all unbelief amen and he said that's the way he has done for you he calls for a total separation from unbelief don't get there there are friends out there yes we can be friendly with them and so on but don't get caught up in their lives no you going to manifest the right spirit so he said as he did with Abraham so he does to you and he said separate yourself from unbelief yes but where's the unbelief thank God this takes Grace it does separate yourselves ourself he said from your Kindred amazing yeah separate yourself from all your Associates amazing only so far you can go with your with with those that you're working with yeah again as I've said that by the grace of God you keep your attitude right Spirit right then then the Lord will gr Grant you a right attitude right spirit in them well they'll respect you as this that thank God and I give the glory to God it's not me it's God Amen that down Through the Ages there are those that I have fellowship with or work with and maybe they use foul language and they say oh excuse me Geral I didn't mean that forgive me oh yeah they've apologize because they use this language they use that Lang or they did this or did that we know better they said than to do those things forgive us oh yeah to God be the glory how separated are you unto the Lord you want to give him preeminence I certainly appreciate our brother here the preeminence he's given to the Lord although he's he owns the business but yet he yet he's amen he's there to give give God time amen give God the glory amen thank the Lord for brother Kingsley amen giving God preeminence oh yeah praise the Lord amen and you know what God will bless him for that yeah God will prosper his business for that oh yeah most definitely amen and the same thing with all the rest of us here if we're doing this doing this doing that it be if we're tottally separated un to the Lord and giving the Lord preeminence thought word and deed amen oh I I guarantee you he'll give you preeminence he'll bless you and what you're doing we will amen that's scripture praise the name of the Lord so he said that God called Abraham to Total separation from all unbelief and that's the way he done you separate yourself from your Kindred and from your Associates he said come out of the pool room he he said come out of that dance hall he said come away from the things of the world he said God calls for a total separation to Abraham's seed because that's what he called Abraham are you patterning it he said this instrument is Abraham and it represents this seed after him and the Covenant was made to both Abraham and his seed after him and as Abraham was called by Grace by election so was his seed called by grace and election that's why you're here that ought to Humble you and say Lord I didn't deserve it but I thank you so Lord help me to be sincere and be humble amen so he said Abraham was called by Grace by election so was his seed called by grace and election and they heard the voice of God and believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness and brother you say it's imputed to you for righteousness because you believe the word yeah but the word would only be imputed to you for righteousness if you have a total separation from unbelief amen you got to come separate yourself onto the Lord and he'll bless you separate yourself onto his word and he'll bless you and he'll do this for you and do that for you amen thank the Lord amen in 19 that was 61 that was three years before he preached total separation and in 1965 in July not long before the Lord took him home he made reference to it again and he said if I'm a Christian and has been filled with the spirit wearing the testimony of Jesus Christ's Resurrection you're wear it like you would your clo clothing you got a spiritual anointing amen he said that he's the same yesterday today and forever and so are you yeah your thoughts your words your Deeds your attitudes you're the same yesterday today and forever for the glory of God Amen and he said don't let any devil try to push you around and and he said you don't do this you don't do that he said you do it if God has given it to you to do and he said we don't have power the policemen don't have power to stop in one car and sometimes there're three or 400 horsepower motor he said what could he do about it he said he doesn't have the power he has the authority amen and that's the church we have authority by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promised word Allelujah he said the things that I do shall you do also and more than this will you do for I go to the father don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplex the last generation that'll ever be on the earth the sinful adulterous and full of all putrified sores all everything that has been decent has become indecent decent amen that's true he said National politics is filth nations are broke up amen my what would he say today he said this 55 years ago or 50 years ago what would he say today considering all that's going on in the world now brother I tell you this he'd be really looking off he would for the Rapture oh he'd be warning us amen screeching look look up look up look up amen Don't Look Down Grace amen I didn't mean to read this but a lot has happened in the last 55 years there are many people that we knew about and knew their names knew their what they did and they're gone now they're worldly people but it's amazing that most of them are all gone you know and of course brother Brown did say that certain ones went to hell and I believe that I have read the testimonies of those that had gone beyond the curtain of time and the and the Lord even took him down to Hell and showed them and they were surprised concerning the ones they saw yeah and of course brother Brown did say that I think Elvis pres was in hell and I think one of them testimonies I read over the years that they also when they went down to hell they saw Elvis and they saw this person and that person they were shocked yeah as the prophet of God said again he said you're going to be surprised who made it and you'll be surprised who didn't make it you think this brother's going to make it that sister's going to make it no you want to Sur surprise they never made it no never made it he didn't make it she didn't make it you know God knows the heart and God allows these things to happen in your life let this this thing to happen that thing to happen you got to deal with this you got to deal with that you know what God's doing he's bringing out what's in your heart yeah he's what for it'll it'll be a confirmation whether you you are born again or not born again but if you born again you're a new creature on the inside of the inside oh yes so but God allows many things to happen to bring it out amen so that the world's not going to judge you and said oh well he's not born again she's not born again look what look at the attitude they got look at the Spirit they got yeah God help us keep your attitude right your spirit right amen and he said this this let me read it he said way back in the jungles of Africa on Safari Hunters they had to take ey powerered radios to hear Alvis Presley amazing but and Pat Boone and them guys with that rock and roll and twist and the natives trying to see them act along jerking their Ed and acting like that the natives stood and looked at looked at it yeah it was Americans over there haunting but back then I guess the Africans would know about it but back then they were wondering what in the world they doing it was noisy you know but the Americans were enjoying it but the Africans weren't yeah but I guess they would enjoy it now cuz that's many many years God help us brother amen man he said the natives stood and looked at it but you see they're not Americans like Pat Boone Alvis Presley Ricky Nelson and them guys and he said they are not judices of that type because elv was pretty I think Bop you were shocked that he was Pentecostal Elvis yeah that's the church he was raised in but then he got out and he started to rock and roll and that they said because in Elvis and those that have seen maybe a video of him or something and that's why he he would he wouldn't just St up there and sing you know he'd be very active and you know and he'd be going all over the place and up and down and they said where did he learn that he said he learned that in the Pentecost church he said regarding those that danced in the spirit oh I said that's true so what he did was he went out and took that out with him but with and roll and worldly music and he would dance but it wasn't the right Spirit certainly wasn't giving God the glory no definitely not and yet we know we do know too that wherever he went to perform and he went and and they had this program they sang All these rock and roll stuff songs and yet when he went back to his hotel where they were staying he'd only seen s hymns I said what yes he said we've got the testimony said from from those other musicians and singers they said oh yeah Elvis want just want to sing hymns in the hotel said what why I guess to satisfy his his conviction but he wouldn't respond it with he wouldn't respond to it with repentance he just responded with with hymns brother that don't save you amen not by any means no repentance brings you into salvation amen so but Alvis Presley again there's many many of s singer gospel singer that uh they're gone on to now because they' be in their 80s and 90s and but then they they also experienced Elvis oh yeah and Elvis and they they went and got together with Elvis and sang A himym and did this did that oh yeah amazing yeah and uh and there's two or three of them were going on now and they spent a lot of time with Elvis and and Elvis they said Alvis just loved love to frost the sink yeah yeah but Elvis kept on going in the world and the things of the world yeah God have mercy he said the spirit is not only in America it has spread itself all over the world to bring them to the battle of Armageddon and they act like that they said whatever Nation they come from Africa India wherever it is that vulgar and stuff has spread all over the Earth by just one man starting it Elvis started rock and roll and it went around the world and so as the gospel and the power of almighty God as spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place when God is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church but God devil got a church God got a bride so he said let me be part of the Bride amen again that was in the message called ashamed 1965 amen and I guess we're going to to leave it again to another I was open this maybe I'll finish today and I'll get brother Jonathan the minister no so we'll see what the Lord would have us do amen oh yes I shared these quotes with you on uh Wednesday I believe he said if we believe the word of God it's the Word of Life To Us amen and if we question the word of God it's death to us amen that's true oh my God help us understand that it's life oh yeah right from the the the beginning is death the end is eternal life and we're told don't add to it don't take from it amen that's right from from the beginning amen it came from eternity into time and man did what he did in time in believing the devil really it was the woman but the man put himself in death with the woman trusting that God would redeem her when he redeemed him him now and that's why that's why Adam stepped out there with with Eve and and sinned yeah grace of God but brother again right from the fog see God is calling a to Total separation from unbelief but Eve left Adam and went out to see the tree in the in tree of knowledge of Good and Evil she wanted to see what that was all about oh yeah Adam didn't go out looking for it now remember they they were having fellowship with God because during the during the evening they go over and fellowship with God and maybe the the god that they were fellowshiping with was the pillar of Fire you know but they had a revelation of God they saw God they knew it was God and even after they sinned and they went into the trees and they they hid themselves among the Trees of the garden and yeah and God came Adam where are you where are you and they instead of well before they were glad God saw them but now they said we hate them because we they they didn't want God to see this they want God because they knew they were naked before they didn't see we're going to a perfect Kingdom amen thank the Lord I think we'll have a weit r on and so on but again by the grace of God but again there won't be there won't be no knowledge of sin no feelings of sin no no not by any means by the grace of God Amen but God allowed all this to happen for a reason amen all down through time Old Testament New Testament I pray God that he that he is revealing in us what he wants to reveal amen bringing out in you and me what he wants to bring out and brother you're going to testify of God or testify of the devil your life what you do and how you do it who's in control amen Grace listen he said Jesus and or rather God has always separated he said in Genesis he separated he separated the waters from the sea he said he separated life from death and if we believe the word of God it's the Word of Life to us but if we question the word of God it's death to us for God has spoken who can deny it amen and he said if we question the word of God then it becomes death amen like Eve Eve questioned one little phase of God's word and what did it do it caused all this trouble that we have but you see there Came Death and then God also at an atonement being merciful to us he accepted a substitute death for their death and he separated life from Death also in the Garden of Eden and he did it by his word amen yes is all the word amen amazing that whatever God has done whatever God is doing it's his word stay with the word don't add to it don't take from it it is forever settled in Heaven by the grace of God the word amen but yet man under the anointing of the devil sometimes he'll change it he said he separated life from Death In the Garden of Eden he did it by his word and today he does the same thing when we're in a gross Darkness as I spoke on Sunday Darkness upon the land upon the people gross darkness in the midst of all of this he is still speaking his Word of Life to those who want to believe it amen that's right how many want to believe it Lord this is wonderful I believe your word Lord so I pray Grace that you'll just reveal more and and and I'll and it'll control me am amen all witness of it amen he loved the word oh yeah any anything that we love is the word again it's like the boy that went to his Grand parents home and he saw the Bible it had this picture this picture had this this note that note oh what did he call it no what he call the book SC scrap scrapbook yeah and the young boy said oh what's this what's this your scrapbook well it was a Bible but the boy he didn't know well maybe he was uh he he was maybe not taught it or whatever but it was a Bible but he had so many pictures in it of this one that one so on oh yeah family pictures and all that oh muia scrapbook you know notice say the Bible amen and brother I trust by the grace of God your your Bible is not a scrapbook yeah I got a lot of things in my Bible but it's it's a is not when it comes to pictures and all that I I just use it to to to to Mark th this portion then I use it to Mark another portion right here of scripture amen so when I when I go looking for something I got to get this picture right there okay no it's not a scrapbook not by any means so God help us brother that we if we love him we love his word because he is the word amen and if we love him we love his word we love one another because in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us and now the word made flesh again in you and in me yeah by the grace of God you're going forth you're reflecting the word amen Grace and he said Jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we Ascend into the presence of God there will be a final separation God is all down Through the Ages and even the church ages he has separated separated separated because in every age when God did what he he did and it was a Revival but after the Revival they went into a denomination and when it comes to the these right here they went into IR Paul ireneus and Martin what happened after after they were taken off the scene everything went into a into organized religion and it was around 300 ad and that that's when the Catholic church was formed amen they had the I don't have the time to get into scripture and show you the spirits that Jesus was concerned of in the seeven in the seven Church ages and there was a spirit in the first one the second one the third one amen and whereas it went from a just a spirit and influence in their lives it became a Doctrine and after the doctrine it became a church yeah they they formed the first organized church and that's that's where then that everybody had to come in and listen to the listen to the priest and listen to the to the pope and so on but God started to Revival and brought it out then another and that that Revival organized and became another church and then he start went on to another one right here and we know that it went for so long but when the third or fourth generation came on the scene what do they do they made they made a denomination they made an or church organization based on justification amen and that's it we believe period but if you're a Believer you believe plus whatever God's going to reveal to you next right amen so they they believe period and that's it and it became a just maybe a Lutheran denomination a Lutheran organization but God started a Revival through Wesley and sanctification they they denominated around sanctification then God went on and started a Revival well actually it was Pentecost amen and brother Brown said he said this message is the crowning of the Pentecostal message this is Ministry but he said Pentecost don't recognize that or they wanted brother Brown to come and pray for the sick they wanted brother Brown brother Brandon brother Brandon and and the sign in his hand and and the discernment and all that love that praise the Lord Allelujah they were screaming that's right but when he started to get into the word they said no they turned their back on him amen amazing yeah so so in this Pentecostal Revival it takes God takes us on to a bride Revival amen and he's calling us to open the door amen by the grace of God and he'll come in with us and and us with him amen the word becomes flesh again for the resurrection and the Rapture Amen to God be the glory amen so he said we are in the hour of the final separation and he will separate the sheep from the goats and as I said when when they started denomination God separated this his seed and moved them on they organized there but another generation rose up and he moved them on Amen hallah Hallelujah moved moved him on to Pentecost but now we're going from the message of the hour to the Rapture the married supper of the Lamb by the grace of God Amen this is tremendous don't don't think God's going to look back and just require this or just require that no no what what is he doing that's what he requires that's what gives us the faith to go on Amen but the grace of God and praying Grace that we're going to get the faith for the Rapture and go up but understand to a number of people that I W was witnessing to there recently and I noticed that they kept asking the question uh you believe in heaven I said yes we believe in heaven oh okay good good and I thought why in the world would they ask that question you know believe in heaven so we're going to go to heaven but then we're going to come back why because he's going to create a new Heaven and a new Earth amen where there is no sin and by the grace of God we're going to live in the New Jerusalem in the new Heaven and the New Earth by the grace of God Amen so the Lord bless us and brother we're going to meet meet the Lutheran now meet those that were in Wesley's Revival the real true seed there's a Lutheran Revival and on down all that God God has called but again the few chosen is the bride praise the Lord thank God for such Revelation amen so he said it's a final separation and he will separate the sheep from the goats amen so I trust for sheep not a goat oh well you meet goats and they're always Buton butt butt butt butt yeah no butt amen just Faith believe the word and he said God will continually and has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight amen that's what he always does and he said he separates Faith from unbelief he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe him and have faith in him amen and we find out in Numbers Chapter 6 that a nazarites call he said was as to separate themselves from all the world to the word of God that's a Nazarite call separate amen and we find out that Samson was a nazarit unto the Lord separated and he said I think today when we see our sisters wearing long hair and the Bible said they should I think as a Nazarite son that they want to follow the Lord amen and he said I know that sounds flat I want it to go home it looks like somebody is trying to do something that God told them to do no matter what the price the world has to say about it he said out there how many scornful laughters and critics that doesn't bother a person that's totally separated from the things of the world world to the things of God they'll obey the word they'll separate themselves from the things of the world because the word separates them and if you're believing the word in your heart in your soul it will keep separating you from the world and the things of the world love not the world or the things of the world Amen grace of God Amen if you believe the word it'll keep separating you amen I know that sounds flat the world has to say about it he said how many scornful laughters critics it doesn't bother a person that's totally separated from the things of the world to the things of God they'll obey the word and separate themselves from the things of the world because the word separates them amen keep walking in the light believe in the word amen and you'll get it there'll be a greater in a greater separation from or it will come yeah from the world and it might be some cases it will be eventually they separate it'll get a greater and a greater separation from the family friends and nature nature and yes neighbors yeah oh yeah because the more spiritual you get the more religious your neighbor gets yeah they don't they don't consider you to be religious if you're just spiritual they feel there's something wrong with you yeah so God help us but again there will be a few that will be friends of the Bride amen thank god let's see the world always knows its own but as I have said remember criticism on account of the word of God is only growing pain of his grace amen it shows that you have separated yourself to be a Christian act like a Christian live like a Christian and obey every commandment of God it's a Nazarite vow to separate a call from God that separates you from the things of the world Amen well brother I tell you closer you get to him the less and less and less will you be attra to do anything that world you it'll make you sick I'm sick of it I want to get out of here why because you got a new birth amen if you and you got an experience and brother I tell you this that that if you really got a genuine spiritual experience with God With Jesus M you just you just hate the world you hate the things of the world but you love Jesus you love the new Heaven and new earth oh I want to go Lord I want to go amen man because you're so in love with it by the grace of God Amen I believe tonight is said that every man and woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite unto the Lord amen because they have separated amen from the cares of the world and whatever the world is got to say they're separated amen I'll just read a quote oh he said God has one way of bringing light to you and that's when you're ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world and all the cares of the world and cling only to God's promised word amen Paul was a Nazarite Aaron was a Nazarite amen and it he say he separated from among the Brethren to Bear the birthstones and to be the high priest oh yes there was a shield that that Aaron had and there was stones on it but it was the birth stones of the tribes of Israel I trust that Jesus got a our birthstone in his heart amen is a it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more to have anything to do with the world but clave only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride Jesus is coming after a woman and he's at a church that is separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world Amen she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in amen she is separated amen only to God and God is the word amen and as the husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride that's the bride's identification the word amen not Grace that we're not identified with this church that church this denomination that denomination it identifies us as the bride of Christ it identifies us as the seed of God praise the Lord amen the only credential that a Believer has is the word of God living in him amen so is the word living in you not just here now but it's the word living in you when you go out and get into your car it's the word living in you when you go home it's the word living in you when you you go shopping yeah if you're word living in you when you when you meet family friends or neighbors for Fellowship H yeah Grace amen total separation gives the word absolute preeminence in your life he said the only credential that a Believer has is the word of God living in him declaring Jesus lives in that person and he said that's a separated Nazareth unto the Lord separated for the word's sake amen God help us to be totally separated unto the Lord for the glory of God Amen for the Salvation of our souls to God be the glory amen let's see if I read this yeah I read it me finish with it the power of almighty God has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place when God is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church let me be part of the Bride amen amen Amen brother that's right not a part of a church part of the Bride amen you're not here because you're a part of this church you're here because you're the bride amen by the grace of almighty God Amen the Lord bless you and thank you for your patience you have need of patience that after
