things this morning in jesus name amen amen amen god bless you thank you musicians this morning if you'll turn in the scriptures to second samuel chapter 23 ii samuel 23 and just by way of a brief update i haven't talked about brother ron spencer very much lately but i spoke to him yesterday and he gave me an update personally and he said i could share this with the church so he said they've they he just had a ct scan that showed that he has a small brain bleed and evidence of a recent stroke so that what they're doing is the medications they're giving them to help treat his cancer causing other problems in his body so they still they see him as a miracle that he's still alive stage four cancer after more than two years at this point um but obviously there's complications with all that's going on and these things so um he's in a battle still amen he needs our prayers but uh he's by no means given up um if he'd given up it had been over years ago but we're years into a stage four cancer patient and yet he's still there he's still preaching this morning amen so we pray that god will be with them and bless them and keep them amen god bless you second samuel 23 and verse 14 says and david was then and unhold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men break through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men and then god bless you may be seated this morning and then this morning we're deviating from a regular regularly scheduled program and i want to take a title this morning of knowing where to satisfy your thirst amen and we see here a story of david it's a very well known one brother branham covers it ex you know extensively in the message and he talks about this thirst that david had and it's interesting that david's thirst comes up for a specific place and a specific thing in a time of desperation when he's got the philistines on one side when he has saul on the other he's he's running for his life and he's been running for years now and it seems like everything is aligned against him everybody's out to get him he has no place of rest he has no place of peace everyone's trying to separate his head from his shoulders and he gets to a place where he sits down on a rock and he says i just want to drink from a well that i know of i want to drink from a specific well there's a place i've been before and there's a drink that i want from that place and no other place will do it this morning for him and then he wanted to go to a place that he had an experience with that it was a place that was known to him he did not know this well because he'd read a story about it in the in the local scrolls he had not heard a sermon about the great well of bethlehem he had not had a friend tell him about this but this was a place where david had been where he had been raised where he had found his rest where he had found his thirst quenched before and then it was a place where he knew that it was going to do something for him and he'd never found anything else like it in all of his travels and all of his wandering and all of his worrying and all of his running away from things he had never found a well like that well of bethlehem amen he'd had a personal experience with the well at bethlehem and there were many wells in bethlehem but there was one outside the gate that he knew was the place that he could find the greatest refreshment amen david had drunk from that well before until his thirst was quenched he had drunk until he didn't need anything more amen he had been at that well and there was something about that well that in a time of need he said i want the water from that well and somebody was there to listen to him it meant three men that could take the thought of david and turn it into their will and their action and they went and they fought for 25 miles back to back to back three of them together and what did they do they went and they fought their way all the way there and they fought the way all the way back and on the way back they had to held what that bucket with water in it while holding a sword on the other end and cover each other's backs while they fought another 25 miles back amen they put their lives on the line they put their blood on the line and they come up to david and they give him something that he's been wandering that he's been he's been wanting so badly brother branham said this he says there was no water like bethlehem had david used to think when i take my sheep and start out on a morning i go by that old well and drink oh how cool and how sweet and how it quenched the thirst he says now his throat isn't going yet anointed why it's anointed to call for something there's a thirst there that's anointed it's an anointed thirst sometimes we have thirst and they're not an anointing that we want but there is a thirst that is anointed to cause you to call for an experience that you've already had that there is something to pull from that's known in your life to bring you to a place where your thirst can be quenched this morning amen he says oh if i only had a drink of water and he screamed out in despair oh if somebody would bring me a drink again from that old well yonder at bethlehem oh after dreaming of all his childhood days and the victories and seeing him in the place where he's sitting here beside the fires he screamed oh somebody could bring me water from bethlehem and he wasn't satisfied with the little desert streams and the little springs that he ran across from he wasn't satisfied with the warm brackish water in the waterskins that they were carrying around he needed something from a place that he knew was clean and pure that well of bethlehem fed the rest of the city fed the rest of israel even beneath it it was a seep it was a it was a source of water for everyone beneath it it was a place where everything else flowed from amen somebody might have come up to him and said david i took this from the last well we passed take that drink that and david would take one sip and he'd say but it's not the same as the water from bethlehem's well outside the gate it might be water and it might keep me alive for a while but it doesn't satisfy the thirst that i have inside of me hallelujah what did he say there's a water i need and i won't stop until i get it amen and yet when those men put their lives on the line it's so humbled david that he poured it out on the ground and he said this is a sacrifice to the lord because my need would never should never put somebody's life in danger but there was still a longing there that wouldn't be quenched amen even when it was brought to him he wouldn't do it he gave it as a sacrifice to god amen it's no matter nobody writes of thirst the way david does in the scriptures nobody writes about how how hungry and how thirsty is and what is it always about it is always about being in the presence of god amen he's always seeking he said there's one thing have i desired amen that i would dwell in the house of the lord his desires always to go back to what god had for him amen god takes us to places of dryness god takes us to places of trial god takes us to places where we have a need or a hunger and then what does he do is he sits back and he sees where we're going to go to satisfy it right he sees where you're going to run he sees what you're going to pray for he sees what you're going to lean towards he sees what you're going to be drawn to to see if you have an experience that is going to pull you back to him or if you've just been flighty and you've just been flirting with things and you'll go to anything that you think will make you feel better david said in psalm 63 1 he says oh god thou art my god david had a god that was personal to him he says early will i seek thee let me put it this way the first place i'm gonna go is you god i'm not gonna wake up and go to somebody else something else i'm not gonna wake up in the morning and go to my phone or go to this but early will i seek you god i'm gonna seek you first thing in the morning first thing when trials come first thing when tribulations come first thing when sickness comes i'm going to come to you god i'm going to seek you first my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is who takes them here it's god satan doesn't take david here it's god testing and trying improving his servant so he can be king leader what is he seeking he says to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary david had seen god's power and glory this was not just a theory this was not just an idea to david he knew that god was real and he says god i'm seeking that god not a god on the scrolls not god in the bible but god that is real in the sanctuary where he is present in my life today why because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee amen he is not praising a theoretical god he's not looking for a god that somebody else spoke of he's not looking for the god of william branham but he's looking for the god that he has experienced in his own life in his own church services in his own family in his own relationships and his own trials and tribulations he's looking for the god that has always been there and he's saying i'm going to find that thing that i know is real and i won't stop until until i get exactly what i'm looking for amen he's experienced a place where god is god right not just a god on pages but he's a god that moves and acts in our lives that leads us and guides us and provides and heals and delivers and man he's looking for a reality but we read here how david's thirsty it's okay to thirst sometimes satan takes us and we we say i want more i don't have enough and he turns that into a guilt trip in our lives where we think that we've done something wrong but the thirst just shows that there's something waiting to satisfy it you cannot thirst for something that doesn't exist thirst is a survival mechanism to let you know that you're lacking something and you need to get it filled up again right so don't let the devil beat you down if you're thirsty just make sure that he doesn't drive you to something that won't satisfy your thirst in the long term amen it's okay to say god i need more of you it's a it's good to say god i don't have enough of you we don't have enough of him do we we're still here we're still here we're still fighting a fight we're still in a battle so we need more of him every single day amen he says thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches you can't remember something you've never had you've got to have something to remember when you're laying down at night you ought to have something to remember of god's goodness and grace to you that makes him a reality in your life amen he had events in his life that he could meditate on to know that god was a reality to him and to his family and to the little army in the little gathering that he had around him amen he wasn't flying by theory when he talked about this but he was looking back to a place where his thirst had been quenched by the reality of a living god in his life he says what because thou has been my help my help not aberchy's help not anybody else's help but my help lord you've been my help and i'm gonna meditate and dwell on that that's what i'm gonna focus on is god when you have answered my prayers when you have come on the scene when you have proved yourself to be real in my life he says therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword there shall be a portion for foxes but the king shall rejoice in god amen are you going to rejoice in god it will be because he has made himself real and your thirst has been quenched that which you have seek sought after that which you have meditated on has become a reality yet again in your life everyone that swears by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped and then david had a longing i have a longing longing for jesus amen just to be near him to feel his presence i have a longing in my heart for him that's what david's expressing here but he knows it can be satisfied that's the thing we have to know is that it can be satisfied and not because somebody told us but because we've been satisfied before and we're looking for that same satisfaction in our life listen to what brother brown says he says and david surrendered himself and said my soul is thirsting like i was in a dry land where there's no water i thirst for the oh god he had to humble himself to say that i need more that there is a feeling of lack in my life and there's something that's got to come forth right something has to be satisfied in my life he surrendered himself he humbled himself there you are david said i seen thee in thy sanctuary and my soul thirst for that power there you are that's the difference that's what makes things different is this thirst that god give you if you satisfy it with the capital w water count unto me all you that are thirsty come and drink from the fountains of life freely without money without price there's a fountain open in the house of god in the city of david there is the fountain that you're thirsting for there is the fountain he's not saying there is a fountain he says there's the fountain that you're thirsting for certainly it is don't try to pervert it by trying to say i'll satisfy it by drinking i'll satisfy it by having a date with this girl i'll slip out a little on my husband i'll go out a little on my wife that shouldn't apply to any of us by god's grace but pick your poison you know what you're doing in your life you know where you're at you know what you fall to when things get a little dry put your own thing there right what he says you're only heaping judgment you say i'm not satisfied brother branham no wonder he says it's god dealing with you god trying to bring you to something and you take the devil's suggestion and go off with it so we have a godly thirst but a devil's suggestion that comes right behind it to try and pervert you off of what god's trying to do in your life that's the way sorrow come that's how death come and that life is not life capital l it's death for the wages of sin is death but the god of it the gift of god is eternal life to them that receive it he says oh do not be deceived amen now we've been talking about david but i want to bring this down to our doorsteps this morning if god will help me to preach it because if there's one thing i know is that if you have a thirst then satan has something to try and make you satisfy that thirst amen no matter how weird how strange how unusual your thirst might be satan has a massive menu of things for you to try to satisfy his the thirst that you have in your life amen when you look around the world you can see all the weirdness that's out there from the from the from the normal to the completely weird it's all out there and what is it it is people that are thirsting after something and satan's putting the strangest things in front of them to try and get them there amen but as believers we're built with a thirst inside of us amen from from our very birth we're born with a thirst because there's an emptiness that needs to be filled by something amen as satan will try and pervert it it means god always has a way to satisfy our thirst amen right satan's menu is long and varied god's has won that's why we don't try god so often is because it's not nearly as interesting as satan's if you walked into a restaurant and they only have one thing on the menu who wants to eat at that restaurant but if you ever tasted that one thing you know why they only have one thing because that's the thing that you need that's the only thing you'll ever want to taste because they perfected that one dish to such a high level that you'll never think anything else is good again that's what god's like when you taste god just once when you have an experience with god when you have a satisfaction to your thirst you'll never go for something else again what is it satan's menu is long and buried and what happens is we get to the end of the day the end of the week the end of the year the end of your life the end of your marriage and you wonder how did i get here and it was by sampling everything on satan's menu braham says this he says how dare some of you it would be so little as to try and quench that blessed thing of thirst by trying to satisfy that with drinking smoking television running and carrying on and reveling around trying to satisfy that godly thing that god put in you to thirst for him you're polluting the fountain that god has placed in you to receive his spirit and you're drowning it drowning it with the things of the world and they do not satisfy they never will satisfy notice he says drowning there what is it you've got so much you've got to deluge from satan's kingdom pouring into your life that it drowns out anything good that god might happen to stick in there he says there's something in you that calls out there's something in you that longs for god and you try to satisfy that thirst that's in you as david said as the heart thirsts after the water broke so my soul thirsts after thee o god and you try to satisfy that blessed holy thirst that god put in you to thirst after him and you try to satisfy it with the things of the world the devil is trying to make you quench that thirst by serving him when you're an eagle you was born to be an eagle you have no right to try and quench that thirst with the things of the world god gave you that holy thirst to thirst after him blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled what is it we allow our lives to be flooded with things that are not of god amen things that are of unbelief things that are of fear things that are of despair and then we turn to what entertainment and these mindless things and then the things of god are completely overwhelmed in our life because we're seeking such a place of rest and relaxation to back away from everything that's going on and what it does is it allows satan to come in like a flood that's what a deluge is it's a flood that's what causes drowning a flood right that's right but now you say you look at this and you say well brother john i'm not smoking i'm not drinking i'm not doing this i'm a believer i'm a good christian that's not what i do listen to the prophet's warning here okay he says the devil has another way to pervert besides saying well i don't drink brother brahm i don't smoke i don't gamble i wouldn't run out on my husband or my wife i live a good life amen he says but the devil has perverted that he lets you think to satisfy your guilty conscience that you go join a church and you're all right that's wrong that's perverting you can't get satisfaction by joining a church you only become mental why it's an intellectual affair he says you'll never be satisfied until you know him as the forgiveness of your sins where the same question is settled and you have that lovely peaceful quiet eternal everlasting fellowship with him what you've got to have peace in your soul you've got to know that the same question is set settled forever you've got to know that god is working in your life he says when the peace of god that passes all understanding has sanctified your soul and has made you a new creature in christ jesus joining church won't do it no sir that's only perverting the real cause if the devil can't get you out on those things he'll take you to this other he'll bring you right into this church sit you in those pews day by day week by week year by year and try and get that to satisfy the thirst that's in your soul he says but don't settle for nothing less than an old-fashioned experience of the new birth to be born again of the spirit of the eternal god when your soul and god unites together and you become one amen it's so late we're so close to the end of all things amen there's a hell to shun into heaven to gain as this song says it's rapture season it's resurrection season and the prophet says don't let attending church be your satisfying portion it's a part of being a believer i'm satisfied when i come to church and that i want to be in church it does something for me but he says don't let that be the thing that defines your relationship with god is the fact that you come to church and have a good time or that you come to church and have a bad time that you come to church at all don't let that be the satisfying portion but let it only be a portion of what god is doing in your life amen amen don't let satan he says dull your thirst with these things but seek what the peace and quiet and satisfaction of a new creature in christ baptized in the holy spirit he says you're trying to satisfy a hunger you're trying to satisfy a thirst with the things of the world and that thirst was not given you to be quenched by the things of the world but by christ the inexhaustible fountain of life listen to this when you try to satisfy with that perverted way tomorrow you wake up with a headache and with a heartache now he's speaking i believe of alcohol there many times but what happens is you try one thing and you wake up the next morning what is it you still have the worry you still have the fear you still have the thirst you still have the problems and then you got a couple more because you did the wrong thing in the first place right you tried to satisfy it with something else and what is it you drunk all you can drink and maybe not it's alcohol maybe it's movies maybe it's books maybe it's sports social media clothes fashion maybe you're just drinking and eating guess what when i get unhappy i tend to eat nanaimo bars i've eaten three boxes since christmas not because i'm unhappy but the problem is you eat a couple because you're unhappy and pretty soon you're eating them because you're addicted to them right right what is it we're trying to deal with something in our lives and we're going the the way except the way of god amen amen we've got a hunger you know how you know you're thirsty you keep trying something different because what if you were satisfied in your thirst you wouldn't be looking for the next great thing you wouldn't be looking for the next opportunity you wouldn't be looking for the next open window the next open door you won't be trying to kick the walls down what would you be doing you'd be satisfied because your thirst has been quenched you know you're satisfied when you're not seeking anything else but the thing that satisfied your thirst in the first place amen what is it everybody else is running around trying to find it and you're sitting there happy little humble victorious christian drinking from the word of life the fountain of life amen philippians 4 paul says this he says not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content in other words he's not thirsty for anything else but what god gives him he's happy to sit there he says i've had it well he says i know both how to be a based and how to abound he says i've been humbled i've been put down and i've been raised up everywhere and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and suffer need that's the description of a christian walk is to be satisfied with what god has given you but to always be wanting more of god right that's what we're looking for is not to seek what a greater paycheck a bigger job a greater career more influence more power more authority but to what be happy with what he has given us and keep looking for more of him and to do more for him and then he says what i can do all things through christ which strengthens me brother brown says this listen brother don't desire the big things of this world but be satisfied with what god's given you the only thing is to be now watch this be sure you're in the will of god be sure you're in the will of god amen what is it when you're not you're not satisfied if you keep trying one thing and then another and then another and then another guess what god's will doesn't lead you through 14 things god's will will take you to what you need but you got to sit and wait so many times don't you you've got to rest and say lord there's a hunger there's a thirst i'm going to you i'm not going to try anything else lord i'm coming to you and i'm going to rest and i'm going to wait until you satisfy the thirst that's in the soul of mine amen amen so the thing is though you've got to recognize that you're thirsty because we all know when we're thirsty for a natural drink don't we what happens our tongue gets thick we get little bits of spittle on the side of our mouth right brother mark right what is it our mouth feels like cotton we're going what is it we know what that thirst is but when we talk about our spiritual walk when we talk about our life how do we know what that thirst is do you recognize thirst in your life because if you don't recognize thirst you won't realize you're trying to satisfy it amen so what is it if if you don't realize that thirst looks like what sadness feeling alone depression boredom feeling unimportant on love disconnected unworthy dissatisfied that's all thirst because what if you're sad it means you're looking for what joy you're thirsty for joy but you don't have it so you're sad if you're feeling alone it's because what you don't feel a part of god so you're thirsting for what communion for fellowship that's what thirst looks like amen right what is depression depression is thirsting for what a confirmation that god has the answer right it's looking for jehovah gyra depression is when you forget that jehovah jair is there that's what these things are these are all thirsts in our lives but the thing is how many of us go to god when we're in those situations but what do we do we'll go seek something else that we can go pick up to satisfy what's going on inside of our lives amen what is it other times we're just wound up intense worried unsure feel for wondering all of these different things and what is it god is love god is peace god is joy god is rest god is satisfaction all of these things and you've got to go to that inexhaustible fountain to resolve that you're not going to get it from the book you pick up you're not going to get it from the movie you watch amen you're not going to get that from a new business opportunity you're not going to get it from a career upgrade you're not going to get it from a spouse upgrade right what is it satan's going to keep throwing sister maureen laughs brother johnny funk one of the few things on social media that i felt was worth reading brother johnny funk posts the thing he says if you want to know god's will for the mate that you had that that you should marry he says read the name on the marriage certificate that's god's will for your life whether you like him or don't like him whether you made the right decision wrong decision he says that's how you know who the right one is whoever's name is on the marriage certificate that's the right one you'll be amazed how many message brothers have gone looking for an upgrade why because they think they're allowed to do it what is it they were searching for something right listen before we moved to edmonton i was feeling led to move to edmonton and the reason to move to edmonton had nothing to do with career i had a great career i was on a high trajectory i was the youngest of a lot of things that had ever happened in that company and i made the decision to move and you know why i needed to move to edmonton i needed to be a better father and i need to be a better husband okay so there's a thirst there there's a need there and so god's pulling me to a place that will work on that right now what does satan do as soon as i make that decision now i haven't moved yet but i've decided that's what's going to happen and what is the first thing satan does gives me a new opportunity in my career i get a call from my boss on a friday afternoon he's in houston he says john don't leave the office i know it's a friday afternoon don't leave the office until i get there i've got something to talk to you about so he gets there and he sits me down he says we've just acquired so and so we want you to move to houston and run it i'd have been the youngest guy ever in the history of the company to do that what do you do satan offered me what a career upgrade to what offset the growth that i knew i needed right so i could move to edmonton and grow as a husband and father and as a christian or i could move to houston and get myself that first porsche i've been all i've been wanting right and be the big shot right be the big shot and guess what getting worse and worse as a father and husband in all probability what is it there was a thirst there and satan gave me a drink opportunity and god gave me a drink opportunity and he said you gotta pick what'd i do i told him i said sorry my family and i are gonna be moving to edmonton so you better find somebody else like that i didn't have to think about it right i didn't have to go home and pray about it why because i knew where i needed to go and so it was easy to turn down the drink that satan offered what that wasn't going to satisfy the thirst and it would have destroyed my marriage and my family in all probability right watch what the prophet says about how these things come into our lives amen he says so now how satan tries to pervert the satisfying of the soul that thirsts for the soul he tries to give you everything to satisfy and he is so deceitful in these days of perversion this is a perverted world it's a perverted race it's a perverted people so if it's anything from out of the world it's perverted can i put it that simply there's nothing out there that's sanctified and holy but watch this he says everything is perverted and as perverted so gradually until it becomes the most deceitful age that we or any human being ever lived in it's more deceitful than it ever was but watch see how he says the perversion is gradual it's not just gradual out there but it's gradual how it comes into your life because satan won't throw a bald-faced bad thing into your life will he but what does he do is he opens up the door just to crack and he sticks something through to see if you'll recognize what's really standing behind that door and if you don't then he'll open the door a little bit more and so this thing is slowly creeping into your life right and what used to be watching something on youtube has turned into what a full-blown addiction three months later where every spare moment what are you doing you're opening your phone and you're going straight to youtube why because satan brought it in gradually and all of a sudden now it's fully in your life and it's as if you have a television but you never see it why because he brought it in so gradually that you don't realize that he's now got an influence in your life and he's taken away every bit of spare time that you've got and he's directed your attention to something that will never satisfy you it's a gradual thing that's coming in it's a slow appearing in hopes that you won't recognize the big picture what's happening amen so what's the antidote to this what's the antidote to satan's plan what did david do how did david correct it how did david respond david what went back to his experience if you don't have an experience you don't have anything to fall back on do you but david had an experience of thirst being quenched so he went to the place that third quest quenched his thirst didn't he we've got to have the same thing what we've got to have an experience we can rely on so that when things get thirsty we go to the place that thirst is quenched at amen brother brown mentioned this earlier it's matthew 5 6 he says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled do you notice it doesn't say that if you thirst for anything else you'll be filled you can thirst after everything that satan's got after there but no matter how much you drink you'll never be satisfied with what satan's got but if you thirst after and hunger after righteousness you're going to be filled if you'll seek the things of god if you'll seek to satisfy your things with the things of god then what god can do something for you and god has promised to meet that feeling need that's the only thing that can do it so thirst is not the problem blessed are they which hunger and thirst you're blessed if you've got a hunger you're blessed if you've got a thirst but what are you thirsting for and how do you treat your thirst that's what he's getting at bless it if you thirst but you gotta thirst for the right things because god can only answer with certain things amen amen i remember when i was in edmonton and then we moved to bc and well i was in edmonton i guess and and that was at the peak of my career really and things are great and you're making good money and you got a house and you got a sports car and you got a trucks and you're hunting and you got quads and this you got every toy you got everything that you could want and my wife and i are sitting there and we're saying there's got to be something more we think don't we brothers oh if i can make 100 grand a year i'll be happy guess what when you get to 100 then it moves to 120. when you get to 120 moves to 140 when you get to 140 it moves to 160 when you get to 160 it moves to 180. the line keeps moving why because there's nothing that says you're going to be satisfied in the word with that right so we sat there and i'm i'm again the youngest in company history in my role right i'm at the peak of my career i'm making good money i have virtually no debt things are going great and my wife and i are sitting there and we're saying is this all there is we're holy ghost-filled believers but there was a thirst for something that wasn't being satisfied with a great career and then what happened i got called to the ministry and guess what now i make less money now i'm busier than ever now i deal with more problems than i ever had to deal with and i couldn't be happier why because there is a place to satisfy a thirst that god has put in your life and where is it it is in the will and the word of god every single time no matter how much of a downgrade it might look like it often looks like a downgrade but satisfaction is worth a lot in my my first job in in bc i made the most money i'd ever made in my life and i call that job the golden handcuffs because i was miserable while making the most money i'd ever made why satisfaction counts right you've got to have that thirst satisfied and you can tell yourself all day long it's satisfied but if you're miserable guess what your thirst hasn't been satisfied amen brother brown says if you're hungry if you're thirsty god has a way to satisfy that thirst there's nothing in your life that can't be satisfied with god david said when the deep calls to the deep there's a deep to respond to it he says there's a little place in the heart that nothing will fill it but god and men are thirsting for something and that real thirst is for god and nobody's got a right to try and quench that holy thirst with giving it to the devil for the things of the world got no right trying to hide that thirst by joining a church god is the only thing that will fill it up god the holy spirit is the only thing that can satisfy that thirst jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness and it's god trying to get to the human heart and the devil tries to quench that by letting them drink their self to death or run themselves to death or do something else those that run themselves to death what going from one thing to the next thing to the next thing to the next thing and in the end you just flop down exhausted because you've tried everything except what god has offered you what is it you lay there and you die but god created man to have that holy thirst and if you won't take god then you'll have to take something else to kind of appease that calling if you're a believer you're never never going to be satisfied with what satan offers right that's what makes a man that way notice this sermon thirsting for life the the three major sermons in this thirsting for life thirst and life you got life problems this sermon's for you you got thirst problems this sermon's for you if you're thirsty for life this sermon's for you this is life this is the believer's walk here thirsting for life isn't that what we're doing we're seeking what a kingdom that is to come we're not satisfied here we're thirsting for something else but does our life reflect it amen how do we get in trouble why do we get into trouble so often because we're so far removed from a thirst quenching experience that we've forgotten that we can go there in the first place or we've never had one that's why we get into trouble we've forgotten that we were once satisfied or we've never been satisfied yet and so we're trying something in something in something in something until we can get to a place where we're satisfied why do you thirst after righteousness because when you knelt at the foot of calvary you got a taste of what his righteousness because he gave you his why do you thirst for more of the holy ghost because you got it in the first place but you're seeking more and more and more because what the road is long the hill is steep the battle is tough and you need more and more and more of him amen what is it why do you thirst for rest and peace because the day you gave your life to him that's what you experienced didn't you it's what i experienced there was a rest and a peace the day i gave my life to god that i've never had prior to that you thirst for something because you've experienced hopefully he says there's a response when you thirst there's something to quench that thirst our creeds our denomination will never satisfy that thirst let me say that in our ranks our doctrines and our creeds of the message if we want to put it that way our denomination of the message will never satisfy that though it be right it doesn't satisfied in and of itself because what the message is not at books it's not sermons but it's christ the living word and that's what you've got to meet amen he says you've got to find the reality of a living god and the only way you'll ever do it is to be filled with his spirit that is the quenching of that thirst he is the satisfying portion to his church the all-sufficient one the all-sufficient one you don't add to it and you don't take away from it why because it's all sufficient that satisfies every longing every longing sometimes the satisfaction of your longing is that he takes it away from you because it's for the things of the world right sometimes it's deliverance that's going to be satisfied he's not going to give you something to satisfy but he'll remove it completely out of your life if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god is not in you the scripture says what he's got to do surgery sometimes doesn't he he's the all-sufficient one that satisfies every longing when a man leaves the things of the world and comes to christ he finds that all sufficiency in christ when he finds christ what does the word say taste and see that the lord is good you gotta see it and you gotta taste it you gotta eat the book like john was told to right yes sir got to make it a part of you amen you've got to satisfy your thirst once that's all it's going to take and if you ever get satisfied once you'll never seek anything else again oh we move around don't we we get off the road from time to time we get our eyes off the promise we let situations creep up right what is it satan's a good good adversary brethren says we should say good things about everyone he says i'll say this about satan he's a good adversary he fights well he's a smart fighter but what do we got to do when we recognize we're off what do we do go back to that place where our thirst was satisfied amen i've seen the way people run what do they do they start with a church and it's full of what pentecost it's full of the gifts of the spirit and they go into every service and they love it because why the service is so unpredictable you never know what's going to happen and it's exciting and this one's popping up and speaking in tongues and this one's interpreting and this one's dancing around in the spirit and you just go and you have a great time but what happens is after a while you get what worn out because you gave everything you had in the service and you got nothing out of the word because they were so focused on the gifts and the moving of the spirit you had no substance and so you end up and you're worn out on the side of the road you can't win a victory church is awesome but life is horrible so when they say what well i'm missing something so what do they do they go to signs and wonders or sorry they go to mysteries don't they they go to a church where there's a deep preaching of the word and they get into the deep things of god and they stay there and it's great for a while because it's giving them some things they've been lacking the structure of the word but what happens eventually is what it's all teaching no preaching and they get dried out and all of a sudden everything's formal and they have no relationship with god it used to be a stormy romance now it's cold and formal it's a partnership not a marriage right and then what do they do they go someplace else and they find signs and wonders right they go to a church where there's great healings taking place right they're going where somebody sees visions and they get in there and again all they're doing is they're focused on everything but the god what is they're looking at the gifts of god not god himself and so they keep moving from pillar to post pillar to post trying to find something and guess what in every one of those churches god was there if they could have found him but they're so looking at what is around it rather than the one that's in the midst of it that they keep going here and there and here and there brother brown says this he says oh if the pentecostal church would only satisfy thirst in god let's put our church there forget about the pentecostals i'm not preaching to pentecostals this morning original pentecostals maybe amen right oh if evening light fellowship would only satisfy thirst in god instead of trying to follow some evangelist or some emotion or some little ism or little sensation how much better off it would be he says you'd follow the holy spirit in design in divine love instead of sensations little gifts and things like that how much better off you be god don't want you to run after gifts he wants you to thirst after him amen he's not a sugar daddy we're not gold diggers we're not going to him for what he has we're going for him for who he is that's what we're supposed to be doing we love him amen gifts take on different appearances some are gifts by the working of the spirit tongues interpretation these different things others are gifts of preaching and teaching some are get some are gifts of revelation and understanding they're all part and parcel of god but that's not god it's just an element of god it's an attribute of god as these things but it's not god himself amen your thirst is satisfied in god not in the gifts of god he said satan perverts the true nature of god and the true thirst of god of the body and soul by a lust for sin sin a perversion now we find out a person today the way they took that perversion thirst for god the thirst to be pretty sisters and all these thirsts for water they've turned that into satisfying that with drinking the thirst for joy everybody wants to have joy the thirst for fellowship all these great thirsts that god put into us that we might thirst after him god made you to thirst after him and we try to satisfy with some other kind of a thirst with some other kind of a perversion of the correct thirst see how that's in the natural he says see how it is in the spiritual we think as long as we join church that settles that's all we have to do well that is absolutely wrong no god wants you to thirst for him as the heart pantheth for the water brook my soul longs thirsts after thee oh god see now that deer was panting for the water brook what if somebody come along another buddy deer come down here and said well i'll tell you what i could do i know where there's a good mud hole or down here well the deer wouldn't want that he wouldn't that wouldn't do him any good what are people what are we pointing each other to for satisfaction are we pointing to mud holes or are we talking to the pure running word of god amen he says and there is nothing nothing i capitalize it all there is nothing can satisfy that thirst that's in the human being until god comes in god comes in you know what often happens we come into our holy ghost service we come into an anointed service we come into a service with great songs maybe we actually get some great preaching and then we have a great after service and then we have a prayer line and we say that was amazing i'm satisfied you're just in the presence of god the wheats and the tares both rejoice in the falling of the reign of the holy spirit they're both satisfied but only one walks away with the life that is being looked sought after amen what is it i'm telling you that coming into a great church coming into a great service is not what we're looking for we love it we praise god for it hallelujah i'm glad that i want to be in church but if i don't have the same experience of the holy ghost when i'm driving in my car when i'm in my prayer closet when i'm reading the message when i'm listening to another service then there's something wrong with my walk why because i'm supposed to be in a personal relationship with god not one that's dependent on everybody else in the body being around right amen spouses don't make love in public you've got to have a private relationship with god where he makes himself known to you where he can break down your defenses where he can reveal more of himself where he can have more what authority and control in your life in private not just here but the thing is you have a great service and you think that's it that'll keep me going to wednesday that won't keep us going until wednesday satan's going to keep pushing in and we're going to come up to wednesday and we're going to be trying to catch up to where sunday took us we got to keep pressing the battle every single day right there's nothing can satisfy that thirst that's in the human being until god comes in he must have it or die and no person has a right to try to hush or satisfy that holy thirst that's in him by the things of the world no sir it's ungodly to do so and if you're thirsting for god don't shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book if you're thirsting for god there's only one thing can satisfy it and that is meet god amen if you're thirsting for god that's the only thing you can meet him is to do that now watch this and then there is a great danger also if you don't watch what you're doing in that time if you're thirsty for god be sure it's god you find amen see be sure that it's your thirst is satisfied but if satan has been able to pervert you here's the sign here's the symptom from these natural appetites that he'll do it if he can he'll simply make you try to be satisfied you've got to sit there and try and convince yourself you're satisfied that's how you know you haven't been satisfied is because you're trying to tell yourself you're satisfied while your body's screaming out i'm still thirsty and you might say no you're not no you're not why because i just had a can of cold pepsi straight out of the fridge right pepsi doesn't satisfy thirst it feels like it's satisfying as it goes down but 10 minutes later what are you doing you're going back for water because though it feels like water it's liquid though it's cold like refreshing water yet it's not water and your body is going to start screaming for something satisfying very quickly because it's not the thing that's meant to satisfy the thirst but satan will tell you drink another pepsi it'll work this time doesn't it isn't that what he does try it again take another one again and again and again and we keep going down that path over and over and over again we're not learning the lesson because we haven't what gone back to the source of our thirst quenching experience yet says the only way you can have life is to take that thirst and satisfy it by the drinking at the fountain that never runs dry that beautiful holy spirit that reigns from god out of heaven that's the way you find life is to know him listen up not know his book but to know him not to know your church but to know him not to thirst to satisfy the pastor but to satisfy the lord that's holy thirst that's what sits in you for and would you quench that thing with things of the world he says it's death it's perverted you can attend this message church you can listen to every great sermon you can go on to tim pruitt's website you can go to vindyle's site you can go to ron spencer's site donnie reagan's site at biscle site listen to every sermon they've ever heard you can read every message you can pay your tithes and offerings you can be faithful in your attendance but if you don't meet god you're lost as lost can be though you've done everything a christian should do yet if you haven't met him you're not christ-like why because you need him in you to be christ-like here's another system of unquenched thirst this one's stung i'm going to read it anyways let me tell you something when you're worshiping god in the spirit and in truth when it becomes a custom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you are drinking from a stagnated stream if the things we do in service are based on what other people are going to think about us in our spiritual walk he says you're already stagnant and you don't even know it we do not worship based on what other people think we do not worship based on the expectation right a service is not wonderful because somebody sings loudly because somebody dances because somebody shouts because somebody stands up and just starts work no no no that is not what makes a service good what makes a service good is when the word of god drops into your life and shows you what you need to do in your situation and gives you the power to step into the word and take him at it amen that's what's a good service is when he steps into our lives not when he makes us dance because why so often the dancing's supposed to come after the victory and we're dancing without it because why because the presence of god is here right it's an emotional response he says what you're worshiping god in spirit and truth he's not saying you're doing it wrong but he's saying you're doing it in the wrong way with the wrong emotive right he says right until it fills every fiber until the holy ghost holy spirit itself is bubbling in you i don't care whether the music is plain whether they're playing near my god to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart that satisfies that's god's satisfying portion anything less than that you're done amen do we have to have fast songs to worship do we have to have slow songs to worship do we have to have old songs to worship do we have to have new songs to worship he says it shouldn't matter what they're playing who's playing it how good the musicians are how bad the musicians are how good whether it's your favorite song leader in a church that has multiples or your least favorite what he says if the spirit of god is in there filling every fiber of your being it won't matter what they're doing up there you'll want to worship and worship him in spirit and in truth you might speak with tongues like men and angels you might give all your goods to the feed the poor you might prophesy and you might have knowledge and understand all the mysteries and all these things and you still become nothing first corinthians 13 until that satisfying something can only quench that thirst my soul thirsts for the living god like the heart panting for the water brook unless i can find it i'll perish when you get to hungering for god like that something is going to take place the holy spirit is to lead you to those great fountains of god amen what's secure brother john how do i satisfy that thirst satisfy it once you've got to get it satisfied once brother brown already told us what that was he says you've got to get the new birth the real new birth not that i agree with what's coming over the pulpit not that i like being in church but the real new birth which is the life of christ in you and you've become a new creature in him and the old one has died that's what you've got to do what you've got to get truly satisfied once and once you get that you're set for life because you'll always have something to come back to but otherwise what are we we're going to be a pilgrim and a stranger seeking for something that's going to satisfy our thirst amen what is it it's a satisfaction that doesn't require money in the bank doesn't require health in our body amen doesn't require recognition or acknowledgement from the church body but what it's a deep-seated sense of satisfaction and comfort because you know that he abides in me amen you need to have that experience and then what is it every day after that you keep seeking what a new experience with god more of him less of you more of him less of you more of him less of you and what happens is all of a sudden you start to rise to what higher heights deeper depths stable life you're not going up and down in your relationship you're getting into more and more of god while staying right in the middle satan throws something at you your health falters what do you do praise the lord ron spencer two years and two months afterwards praise the lord i'm going to preach this morning right takes your job what do you do the lord give the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord then he gives you a great job it doesn't suddenly ramp up your experience with god why because it's always there day by day by day why he is your satisfying portion but when that thirst comes back when you are sad when you are depressed when you are angry when you are offended when you are hurt what do you do you go back now to that place that satisfied you before because you know in that place you weren't sad you weren't depressed you weren't angry you weren't offended because why that can't stand in god's presence can it brother brahms said no man staying in the presence of god can even accuse another that's how great that presence is you want to get out of your offense get in the presence of god because there he's going to focus everything on you and him and everybody else is outside why into the chamber be free holy spirit speak to me gently as i close the door it's just you and him everybody else is out when he's talking to you brown says you've got to find the person god himself which is the word and interpretation of himself today the promises that he made today how many times did he say we don't have noah's message we don't have moses message what do we have we have a message for our day and it's what as brother brother jail keeps saying it's a rapture and resurrection message this is the message of the resurrection and the rapture that's the only thing that we're here for is to get out of here we're restored back to pentecost and then we move beyond it because we're getting out of here amen this is a message that's going to take us all the way out of this world the people that he was going to have in this day the church without spot or wrinkle it doesn't mean a denomination it means the persons the individuals without spot or wrinkle there'll be two in the bed i'll take one and leave one two in the field i'll take one and leave one but when god that holy thirst to be like him and when you see that his word is in you vindicating itself that you are god's servant whatever god says you just toe right up to it then you're coming through the right process then to satisfy that's holy thirst that's in you amen i want to close with one scripture and it's a long one turn to acts chapter 4 if you would acts chapter 4. now this struck me as i was reading it because of the timing acts 4 is just a few days after the holy ghost fell on pentecost so keep that in mind as we're reading this so it's a wonderful event acts 4 says this verse 6 and anna's the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this so peter and john have been brought into the midst of these these priests and after they healed the lame man at the gate beautiful remember now they're brought before them to answer for it then peter filled with the holy ghost he's filled with the holy ghost okay he got filled on the day of pentecost he's still filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers are the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole peter never said it was me they never said it was anything i did they said it was in the name of jesus christ and it's by his power that we did this drop to verse 13 says now when they saw the boldness of peter and jonah perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus do people know you've been with jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it the miracle the proof is standing in front of them that that god is in their midst and they can't say well it didn't happen because he's standing right there but when they had commanded them to go outside of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle had been done by them is manifest to all that dwell in jerusalem we can't deny it they said listen we can't go say this didn't happen it happened what are we going to do about it guys what do people say about our lives can they look at our lives and say say what you want about them you can't say they're not a christian you can't say that they don't things do things a different way and you can't say that they're not blessed in it because they've got a peace and they've got a rest and they've got a joy when everything is locked down amen they go through covet and they're happy while the rest of us are huddled in our basements trying not to get sick what is it we talk to our neighbors and and we talk to friends and they're they're so unhappy and what do we have we have a joy in the holy ghost we have a body that we're a part of that's right and what is it we go through life and we don't worry about the things people worry because why we've got a satisfying experience that goes on whether we make it to church or not right whether we have covet 19 restrictions or not it's frustrating but what god is always with us and we've got people praying for us and we've got people holding us up and we've got people that love us and we've got people that are connected to us no matter what what is it it's the life of christ that's spread throughout the body and then we've got something that people don't know about but they see it they don't know what causes it but they see it it said it but it's that it spread no further among the people let us straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus now that's completely against their commission isn't it so now we've got a now we've got a line draw on the sand the priests are saying you can't preach or teach and jesus said go ye into all the world and preach and teach what are they going to do and peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than god judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard let me take this back to our lives david would what remember and meditate on the things that he had seen and heard he went back to experience you know what our testimony ought to be things we've seen and heard if we're going to go to people if we're going to be a witness if we're going to be something talk about what god's doing in us talk about what god's doing in our local body perhaps but if you don't have something to share with people then there's a problem there because it means you don't have anything you've seen and heard to share right you need to have something in your life that you can bring to somebody else to let them know this is what you get if you come to do what i do if you come to the god i serve this is what you get but if everything is pointing to somebody else then we've got a problem don't we he says but we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they have further threatened them not a fun day for peter and john they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done hallelujah the miracles was what kept them from being made any harm being done to them right for the man was above 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was shown he'd been crippled a long time this wasn't some quack you know we've been faking it for a while just to make him look good this was a man that had been crippled a long time and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them they went back to the to the church group and they said here's what we've been told they've said you're not allowed to preach and teach in the name of jesus and we've been told to preach in the name of jesus what are we going to do now i want you to remember this is just days after pentecost this is days after the original indwelling of the holy spirit they've been endued with power from on high they have signs and wonders following they've got boldness they've got strength they've got everything they need to take the gospel into the world they got it right there on the day of pentecost this is just mere days afterwards they're expressing the very nature and power of christ right this is god in flesh walking the earth all over again and then they come in and they have a meeting with the with the church body it says and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant david has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thou thy counsel determined before to be done i love how peter says everything that's happened was because you ordained it that way what's he saying so whatever is happening now is ordained it's tough we could lose our lives we could be thrown in jail he says it's for it was for ordained for you it's for ordained for us and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants with that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus what is it they're facing a situation there's an incoming storm and they say we need more he's had great boldness they've had great signs and wonders but they said this is about to get real this is about to get tough we're going to be going against what they've told us to do and we know there are going to be repercussions if we fulfill the commission right so he says what we need more they've just gotten the holy ghost a couple days earlier and yet they're thirsting for more there's a need in their life and so they're coming to god and they're saying you've told us to do it now do it amen what is it they're going back to the well that satisfied them the first time aren't they they're going back to the great source amend the satisfying portion they didn't have a strategy session they didn't sit down and hold a church vote on what we should do you know should we just go out as a mass crowd and we'll put people peter in the middle and he'll preach from there and we'll just surround with people so that they can't get to him easily and he can slip away if they try and grab them maybe we can hire some mercenaries to protect us no they didn't do anything they went back to the great source of life the great source of satisfaction the fountain of everything that they had need of and they said lord we're coming to you because we're trying to do your work amen they just had a prayer meeting that's what they did they had a prayer meeting what they say god we're coming back to you we're doing what you needed us to do but we need more to get it done it's our joshua moment isn't it god we need more than what you've given us what you've given us feels insufficient lord so we're coming for more from you now listen to this and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness amen what do you mean they were filled with the holy ghost i thought they were already filled with the holy ghost they were filled with the holy ghost again and more amen what brother branham said one new birth many fillings one in filling many refillings right you don't have to say i got the holy ghost when i got saved i'm done we see here what three four days maybe after they got the holy ghost they went back and they were asking god we need more from you we need more from the fountain of life we need more from your kingdom we need to be what and do with more power to push through on this and what did it do and immediately it says and they spoke the word of god with boldness he gave them exactly what they were thirsting for what to do his business not theirs and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one soul remember they were in one accord on the day of pentecost weren't they and what did it do it says they're in the same one accord again neither said any of them any that of them that ought of the things that he possessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them listen when you're satisfied grace follows doesn't it because when you're satisfied nothing can knock you out if i'm satisfied seeing what my brother has that i don't have seen what my sister has that i don't have that doesn't bother me because why i'm satisfied it is grace in my life and it gives grace to others as well when i'm walking through this world amen can you imagine if they tried to take this on their own shoulders what would have happened they'd have made a mess of it and we always make a mess of it when we try and take it on our own shoulders but all they did is they went back and said god you commissioned us that means you've got the remedy for our need right here there's a place that i can go to quench the thirst that's in my soul amen what is it we try other things because we've forgotten what worked or else it's never worked in our life and so we keep looking amen like i said once you meet that satisfying portion you're never going to thirst again lebron said this and we're closing he says let me tell you friend i don't care how many churches you join how many names you put on which way you go whether you're sprinkled baptized or whatever you are until you meet that person jesus christ that that's the only thing that will really satisfy emotion won't do it you might jump up and down and shout as long as you want to you might run up and down the floor you might speak in tongues as much as you want to and then things are holy and good i don't see nothing against that but until you meet that person that satisfying portion that something that takes every fiber in your body not by emotion but by a satisfaction god gave man that thirst to worship him to love to seek after him but man perverted it by the call of the devil and he goes and lusts after women and pleasures and things of the world trying to satisfy that holy creation that god has put in to love him he places it upon the things of the world but brother when once he's when he's once changed that's why i said you only have to change once you only have to what recognize this once you only have to experience it once and that fountain with wiggle tails in it all kinds of disorders of the cistern has been cleansed out and sterilized and the pure water of god is put in there sin can never touch it amen amen stand together if we would and the musicians can come i'm going to read one more quote it's not in the slides i had it on my phone he says let me say this tonight in the name of the lord jesus this is thus saith the lord there's nothing will satisfy like the coming of the power of the holy ghost that will change your life and your attitudes and give you comfort and eternal life i'm going to read it again let me say this tonight in the name of the lord jesus there's nothing will satisfy like the coming of the power of the holy ghost that will change your life and your attitudes and give you comfort and eternal life that's he cares for you in 1960 amen i want to ask you this morning do you feel like something's missing do you feel like you're hungry do you feel unsatisfied amen is there a thirst unquenched is there something that's drawing you and yet you know it's not god you know what that means it means that there's a thirst somewhere that needs to be satisfied and it's not going to be with what you're looking at it's got to be through the way that god has called it to be amen needing something isn't wrong we're all needy this morning amen when a preacher says if you have a knee this morning raise your hands we ought to do it every time because we always have needs being needs is not what makes us bad doesn't makes us backslidden it's what we do when the need is recognized that determines who and what we are amen because what a christian will always go towards christ he'll always go towards word he'll always go towards the what the moving of the holy spirit in his life rather than the things of this world amen what is it trying to satisfy what the wrong thing is what really does us in when you need water and you drink pepsi doesn't do you any good that's what does us in is when we try and satisfy it with something else amen but can you recognize that you're thirsty can you look at your life can you look at where you are can you look at where you are in your job and your families and your marriages maybe in your church situation maybe in the ministry that you have whatever it might be can you look there and say there's a dissatisfaction and what's causing that dissatisfaction and what am i doing to satisfy the thirst that's there because any dissatisfaction any fear any pain any suffering what is it it's pointing to something that's deeper than what you think and you've got to get there and say lord satisfy that thirst so that i'll follow you in the right way instead of trying to satisfy with something else amen amen let's bow our heads if we would i want you to think on your lives now i want you to think and say lord there are thirsts there and as the word was coming this morning i realized there's a thirst i'm trying to satisfy there's something going on and lord it's not satisfied and i want you to satisfy it this morning amen let's bow heavenly father lord we're coming to you this morning lord the eternal fount lord of every blessing of every need supplied heavenly father lord and we're bowing our heads in humility lord for so many times we go after the wrong things lord we pick the easy things we pick the quick things but lord your word doesn't work that way but lord if we'll come to it and we'll stay to it lord that there's a great satisfaction that comes into our lives heavenly father so lord we're bowing this morning we're saying lord would you be our satisfying portion nor will you highlight those thirsts in our life where we just thought it was something but now we realize there's a thirst there that needs to be satisfied and that's why we're doing these things lord god would you grant us grace this morning lord my hand is up lord i pray you minister in my life lord that when things come up lord may i not run to lord the the fun things the easy things lord the readily accessible things lord but may i go to your word may i go to your presence heavenly father lord that it would draw me ever closer to you and ever further away from those things that so easily beset us lord touch your people this morning we pray for we ask these things in your precious name of jesus christ amen amen let's sing more of you 759 let's just worship him a little bit this morning amen more of you [Music] more of you well i've had it all but what i need is [Music] [Applause] [Music] still empty and bear lord hear my prayer for more of you i need more of you we love you jesus [Music] [Applause] it amen [Music] but what i need is more of you of things [Applause] [Music] lord hear my prayer for more of you sing it again [Music] [Music] well i've had it all but what i need is more of you [Music] of things but yeah lord hear my prayer for more you you know when somebody has an addiction what's an addiction it's a thirst that's dominated a person it's all it is right they say the first step is admitting you've got it we're going to sing fill my cup lord but this morning you don't have to i'm not inviting anyone to come up for prayer if you want to you're always welcome to do it but the first step is always saying i've got a thirst that i'm quenching another way you've got to be humble before god you've got to repent before god and say god i'm doing something i ought not to and there's a way to get around it but i've got to admit it's a problem in the first place amen it's the hardest thing for us sometimes especially as mature believers is we've got to say i've been trapped i've been fooled i've been sucking on a straw that went into something other than pure water amen but if we'll repent if we'll go to him and say lord there's a thirst there and i want to satisfy it the right way that's when we can get the victory but as long as we keep patting it right soothing our demon nothing's going to happen but if we can say lord there's a problem and i want you to resolve it this morning and i want you to satisfy my thirst with something else then he's got something to work with amen i want us to just sing this this morning for a little bit we'll let brother bob come up fill my cup lord if you got it full there's nothing to fill and then if you've got no needs there's nothing to fill but if you can say to them lord there's a need in my life there's a thirst in my life there's a feeling that i'm looking for then guess what a feeling is what you're going to get if you don't need anything you won't get anything but if you can say lord there's something that i desire in my life there's a thirst in my life you can have it this morning amen if you need the baptism of the holy spirit you can get it if you need deliverance if you need cleansing if you need joy if you need love if you need rest you need peace you need financial blessing whatever it is he can give it to you but you've got to say lord there's a thirst for it that you have a longing for jesus amen this morning let's just sing this a bit if we would fill my cup lord i lift it up [Music] [Applause] [Music] feed me [Music] and make me [Music] i lift it up [Music] [Applause]

there is a fountain in the house [Music] from calvary [Music] for i will take you from the nations and bring you to your own land where i'll be sanctified you before the eyes of man a new heart will i give you and place my spirit within i'll sprinkle clean water on you and save you from your sins [Music] amen and there are streams of grace [Music] and i will pour out upon the house of my chosen one the spirit of grace [Music] a fountain shall be opened up and you shall be holy clean [Music] a day [Music] now is [Music] and there are streams of grace that's falling down from calvary [Music] amen amen amen praise the lord let's uh before we go let's sing i need i need you lord i need you right now it's 11 20 11 29 i think you know let's uh let's sing that and uh i'm gonna ask for david to close in prayer today and just pray one for another because more and more i see the need to pray one for another more and more uh you know i've often heard it said in prayer we see the world falling apart around us and and and it's absolutely true the world is falling apart all around us and the only thing that makes any sense is what is jesus christ it's his word and what it means to us and so i think that's that's where we had to focus and and our focus has to be to acknowledge our need of god when i was in uh we were in edmonton a couple years ago i was asked to lead the song service and i i do that when when brother jerry asked me to and um normally what what what they do in that church is they'll say is there a need to put up your hand as you're approaching the uh the opening prayer and uh so i i did that and it was probably two or three hands went up and that was it and then i said this i said if you have if you feel you have need of nothing you have need of at least one thing and i said it's more of christ and every hand just about went up because people realize that that our need is really of christ it's it's in need of more and more of him if john said it you know we're still here so we need more of him right and we won't be satisfied until we're over on the other side amen so let's pray that way god give us more and more of you more and more and more and more it's okay to be greedy on that point okay so let's be greedy let's ask god for more and more and pray and pray for each other that god gives every one of us more and more remember remember you might say well i'm weak but at the same time the devils tremble when the weakest one gets down on our knees and praise right brother brandon told us that so let's sing this and uh a few times and then brother david calls in prayer amen i need you lord [Music] right now i need you lord i need you lord right now amen i lift my hands i bow my knees to worship at your throne hallelujah i need you lord i need you lord right now i need you lord i need you lord right now yes jesus hallelujah i need you [Applause] lord [Music] i need you lord right now [Music] i need you lord i need you i'm right now yes amen lord jesus i need you lord i need you [Music] oh i need you lord i need you lord right now amen [Music] praise the thank you lord amen blessed lord we just want to pause in the lord before we leave here today lord so say lord that we appreciate your word today lord amen and we want to thank you lord for blessing us lovers let's just happy lord it's cursed after you it's a wonderful subject lord amen it means lord to love you more lord i'm going to love you more lord i thought this natural body cannot no longer contain us lord but walk off the earth we are a weak lord we have our weaknesses he sworn heavenly father and lord that's just normal law for human beings to have lord is a weakness lord but mighty god is a there's a strength law from you lord it overcomes all weaknesses
