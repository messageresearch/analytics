[44:44] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[44:47] and for 2000 years they've been looking
[44:49] for the crown amen
[44:50] amen so i pray grace that we're taking
[44:53] and partaking of these things today
[44:56] amen with the understanding amen that
[44:58] maybe the next time be a crown
[45:00] amen in your heart in your soul in your
[45:03] life
[45:04] amen so i pray we're going to give the
[45:07] king of kings and lord of lords the
[45:08] preeminence
[45:10] amen i tell you those going in the
[45:12] rapture those who
[45:13] have given him the preeminence in their
[45:14] everyday living
[45:16] amen so you're not living for religion
[45:18] you're not living for this church you're
[45:20] living for jesus
[45:21] praise the name of the lord and you
[45:23] still there's too many that are that are
[45:25] living for doctrines
[45:26] and living for living for creeds but how
[45:28] many are living for jesus
[45:30] amen and even how many believers around
[45:33] the world
[45:33] and as i said they said maybe there's
[45:35] two million or more believers
[45:37] as as we believe but how many are really
[45:40] living for jesus
[45:41] they're it's unfortunate but some are
[45:43] only living for william branham
[45:45] that's the truth they're talking about
[45:46] william branham william branham william
[45:47] branham
[45:48] but i mean he's living for jesus amen
[45:51] and again that we know as
[45:52] that brother did and that brother's gone
[45:54] on somewhere
[45:55] but when he put that note in brother
[45:57] brown's pocket and
[45:59] and he said and brother brown of course
[46:01] before he went to the pulpit
[46:02] he read it oh and he said jesus
[46:05] william branham is my lord oh yeah
[46:09] that's what he said
[46:10] and brother brown went to the pulpit and
[46:12] he highlighted it he said listen
[46:14] he said don't you ever get into this he
[46:17] said that
[46:17] that will make he said that will make me
[46:19] antichrist
[46:21] amen and he said you keep preaching this
[46:23] and you keep saying this
[46:24] he said i'll get out of the ministry
[46:26] amen amen
[46:28] so brother is taking our stand for the
[46:30] word the whole truth nothing but the
[46:32] truth
[46:32] and again brother i pray the grace of
[46:34] god help us the prophet
[46:36] warned us in the in the going forth of
[46:38] the word and now he said leave it the
[46:39] way that it is
[46:41] amen and he said don't add to it and
[46:43] don't take away from it
[46:45] amen why because brother brother god god
[46:48] ordained it from the beginning
[46:49] you know that you don't add to the word
[46:51] don't take from the word just pray the
[46:52] grace of god be with you
[46:54] amen so that amen so that the word
[46:57] is made flesh in us praise the name of
[47:00] the lord
[47:00] but and if the word is flesh in you
[47:03] you're gonna you're gonna give the glory
[47:04] to jesus
[47:05] you're giving the glory to god amen
[47:07] you're gonna point souls to
[47:09] to calvary you're going to point souls
[47:11] through the word of god
[47:12] amen concerning what e it wasn't william
[47:15] brown did it it was jesus
[47:17] praise and brother brown did say always
[47:19] said that's your problem
[47:21] he said he said you can't see the other
[47:23] angel
[47:24] amen that's what he said why because
[47:26] they saw the angel
[47:28] of the prophecy and what god was doing
[47:31] in the last days and revealing his word
[47:33] and calling out his elect amen but he
[47:36] said you don't see the other angel
[47:37] that's that he was revealing
[47:39] amen and even when he went to the pulpit
[47:42] and he did these signs and
[47:43] these wonders he was discerning the
[47:45] thoughts and intents of the heart
[47:46] amen now i said i want you to know he
[47:48] said i can't do this
[47:50] he said i got to get out of the way so
[47:51] he can do it that's right amen
[47:54] brother and it's the same thing with the
[47:55] resurrection the rapture
[47:57] let's get out of the way so he can do it
[47:59] praise the lord
[48:00] we're not getting just to a theology
[48:02] into a doctrine to a creed
[48:04] no no we're getting into the reality of
[48:06] what god has done
[48:07] and what god is doing amen and what god
[48:10] will do
[48:11] amen so he he started here and went on
[48:14] down through the oh my
[48:15] six thousand years he's been working on
[48:18] on the
[48:18] his plan and his purpose and his pattern
[48:21] amen
[48:22] and remember he's the same yesterday
[48:23] today and forever
[48:26] amen god doesn't change his plan hasn't
[48:28] changed his pattern hasn't changed what
[48:30] he does and how he does it doesn't
[48:32] what whatever he did back there he did
[48:34] he did to the

[49:58] anointing to go there with the power of
[49:59] god the revelation of god
[50:01] of what brother what god did in israel

[50:05] in israel praise the name of the lord so
[50:08] i pray the grace of god lord help us to
[50:10] be on our guard and elvis to be amen
[50:13] instant in season out of season ready
[50:15] for the resurrection
[50:17] ready for the rapture amen that's what
[50:20] we're going to look for hunger for and
[50:21] thirst for
[50:22] and as i've said a number of times as
[50:24] martin luther and wesley
[50:26] and and and the others they hungered
[50:28] they thirsted
[50:29] for more of god and they wanted to know
[50:32] god
[50:33] you know and they wanted to know well
[50:34] what what can i do to get into a greater
[50:36] relationship with god
[50:37] amen and and again was the holy ghost
[50:40] that god sent ahead
[50:41] to create in them that hunger and that
[50:44] thirst amen
[50:44] amen and he responded to the hunger and
[50:47] the thirst
[50:48] amen and he gave them justification and
[50:51] he gave them
[50:52] sanctification he gave them the gifts of
[50:54] the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:56] amen and now he's given us the
[50:59] the faith of the resurrection and the
[51:01] rapture
[51:02] amen and anything that the bride ought
[51:05] to be focusing on
[51:06] as they focused on what god gave them
[51:08] then brother
[51:10] well we ought to be focusing on what god
[51:12] has given us
[51:13] amen what god has done in the in our age
[51:16] amen
[51:16] so we're not looking back we're looking
[51:18] forward amen
[51:20] and at the same time believing oh lord
[51:22] praise the lord we're experiencing the
[51:24] resurrection
[51:25] we're experiencing the rapture by the
[51:27] grace of god
[51:28] amen so we are amen as we stay with the
[51:32] lord stay with the word
[51:33] we're being cut away more and more from
[51:35] the world and we're being cut away from
[51:37] what's going on in the world
[51:39] amen and we're being caught up more and
[51:41] more with the word
[51:42] amen with the word for this hour for
[51:45] this age amen
[51:46] just saying and he's given us the faith
[51:49] he gave luther the faith for
[51:50] justifications another sanctification
[51:53] the baptism
[51:54] amen of the holy ghost but now he's
[51:57] given
[51:57] us the faith of the resurrection and
[52:00] rapture amen
[52:01] because he did this he did this he did
[52:03] this and according to the word the next
[52:05] thing in order is the resurrection
[52:07] next thing in order is the rapture god
[52:09] help us to have that faith
[52:11] to believe god amen so brother we
[52:14] recognize what is going on in the world
[52:17] amen i trust we recognize what's going
[52:19] on in our lives
[52:20] we see god working out there but the
[52:22] devil's also out there
[52:24] amen because he has come down with great
[52:27] wrath and we see it around the world
[52:31] great wrath
[52:32] knowing knowing his time is short amen
[52:35] his actions are dependent on what he
[52:37] knows
[52:38] amen what he sees god doing the word
[52:41] that he sees being fulfilled
[52:43] what are your actions reflecting amen
[52:47] again luther went forth and reflected
[52:49] what god did and the others and the
[52:51] pentecostals went around the world
[52:53] reflecting what god did but what about
[52:55] the bride
[52:56] amen brother they they preached and
[52:59] preached and preached the baptism and
[53:01] the
[53:01] gifts of the spirit and brother the
[53:03] bride ought to be preaching the
[53:04] resurrection and the rapture
[53:05] amen and it's going on right now
[53:09] amen the climax is the bride being
[53:12] caught
[53:12] up into another dimension amen
[53:16] with the saints that have gone on by the
[53:18] grace of god
[53:20] praise the lord and again as the
[53:21] scriptures say there
[53:23] that the dead in christ shall rise first
[53:26] and then we which are alone remain
[53:28] amen shall be cut up together with them
[53:31] praise the lord so i pray the grace of
[53:33] god
[53:34] to lord that we're not going to lose
[53:36] that faith
[53:37] amen brother i tell you if if
[53:41] it's what god is doing whatever what god
[53:43] is doing is there's somebody
[53:45] for me somebody on the earth believing
[53:46] it gonna be somebody on the earth
[53:49] recognizing it somebody on the earth is
[53:51] claiming the promise of god
[53:53] amen because of what god did amen
[53:56] this is what we're doing it influences
[53:58] us
[53:59] by the grace of god help us move on lord
[54:01] by your grace
[54:03] amen god bless you and again as the
[54:05] prophet of god did say
[54:07] just a short time after he preached a
[54:09] message on the token
[54:11] yeah the token 1963 and he said now
[54:14] listen he said
[54:15] i just trust that every one of you would
[54:17] be filled
[54:18] with the holy ghost amen
[54:21] lord and we're looking for the for the
[54:23] word in us
[54:25] they're working for the word to be made
[54:26] flesh in the bright
[54:28] praise the lord by the grace of god and
[54:31] brother pentecost was just looking for
[54:32] gifts
[54:33] and speaking in tongues and so on but
[54:36] what are we looking for
[54:37] do the luther look for justification
[54:39] what are you looking for
[54:40] amen brother we've gone beyond it to the
[54:43] extent that we've matured
[54:45] and we know in our experience with jesus
[54:47] in our experience with god
[54:48] that we are justified amen
[54:52] you're justified i'm justified amen
[54:54] through jesus
[54:55] sanctified filled with the holy ghost
[54:58] have access to the gifts
[54:59] amen but now we've got to move on
[55:03] now there's something else that god's
[55:06] requiring of you and me
[55:08] amen they focused on that they thought
[55:10] about it morning
[55:11] noon and night as i said luther and
[55:14] wesley
[55:14] they preached you know four or five
[55:16] times a day you know what god had given
[55:18] them it was so real to them
[55:20] morning noon and night that's right they
[55:22] didn't focus on this focus on that they
[55:24] focused on what god did
[55:25] and what god was doing and brother and
[55:28] the pentecostals focused on what god did
[55:31] and what god was doing i was part of
[55:32] that oh yeah

[55:36] years after

[1:09:41] grace grace grace amen brother as i said
[1:09:45] whether whether it's the our young
[1:09:46] people sometimes going to school
[1:09:48] are you going to universally amen jesus
[1:09:51] is there with you
[1:09:52] oh yeah even even in school
[1:09:55] because when i was just a teenager in
[1:09:57] school
[1:09:58] and uh and they and they would they
[1:10:01] noticed it they said oh
[1:10:03] oh i said yeah it's the word yes they
[1:10:05] said we know that
[1:10:07] they say because that's the way you live
[1:10:08] that's the way you act that's the way
[1:10:09] you talk
[1:10:10] oh yeah and uh and as i said
[1:10:13] when i was in a bible class there i
[1:10:16] would hardly have anything to say
[1:10:17] because i didn't want to take anybody
[1:10:19] else's uh place
[1:10:21] and and the brother that was doing the
[1:10:23] the bible class
[1:10:25] he would read this read that and then he
[1:10:26] would then he would offer some questions
[1:10:29] and i remember one time we were in there
[1:10:30] and i i was late getting there
[1:10:33] and when i walked in i was late and the
[1:10:35] teacher said
[1:10:36] oh he said mr lush he said you're late
[1:10:39] he said i hope you're late for the
[1:10:40] judgment i said
[1:10:42] maybe i said we'll see he said well lord
[1:10:45] bless your brother
[1:10:46] so he recognized my faith although they
[1:10:49] they were of a certain church
[1:10:50] you know that that preached certain
[1:10:52] certain things and were totally
[1:10:53] separated and even now
[1:10:55] they're separated as where from from
[1:10:57] denominationalism because of what they
[1:10:59] believe
[1:11:00] and the way they take their stand and so
[1:11:02] on
[1:11:03] but that teacher also said he said we
[1:11:06] welcome you
[1:11:07] and so he got in and he began to teach
[1:11:09] this and teach this the bible there's
[1:11:10] the bible that
[1:11:11] oh he said now i got a question he said
[1:11:14] what church age are we in
[1:11:16] because he was id he was dealing with
[1:11:18] revelation
[1:11:19] and he said what church age are we in
[1:11:21] and he said nobody know
[1:11:24] come on he said raise your hand if you
[1:11:26] got an answer
[1:11:27] and he went on and i i wouldn't say it
[1:11:29] because i was waiting
[1:11:30] just to see i didn't want to take
[1:11:31] anybody else's position and so finally
[1:11:34] he said okay i'll ask you again what
[1:11:36] church age are we in
[1:11:38] and i raised my hand and oh okay said mr
[1:11:42] lush i know
[1:11:43] he said you tell us and so i told him he
[1:11:46] said
[1:11:46] exactly you're right he says the loudest
[1:11:49] see an age
[1:11:50] amen and you can go to go through
[1:11:52] revelation 2 and 3 there
[1:11:54] and the church ages and i pray god amen
[1:11:56] give you the revelation
[1:11:58] that we need in this hour the revelation
[1:12:00] brother sister
[1:12:01] why we're here oh yeah why because we
[1:12:04] believe we're in the last church age the
[1:12:06] seventh church age amen and in that age
[1:12:09] god was put out of the church
[1:12:11] jesus was put out of the church they had
[1:12:14] doctrines and crates
[1:12:15] but they didn't want jesus the living
[1:12:17] word for their hour
[1:12:19] amen but brother we did so we were we
[1:12:22] were put out of the church
[1:12:23] amen he was put out we and he's calling
[1:12:26] us
[1:12:27] he's talking to us he said come on he
[1:12:29] said i opened the door
[1:12:31] and he said i'll come in and stop with
[1:12:32] you and you with me
[1:12:34] not the church so i pray grace we have
[1:12:37] that personal relationship with jesus
[1:12:39] amen because i believe there's even
[1:12:41] so-called message churches
[1:12:43] of all all after all these years brother
[1:12:45] they have the same spirit and attitude
[1:12:47] but i pray grace that we're
[1:12:49] fellowshipping with jesus
[1:12:51] amen and he is fellowshipping with us
[1:12:54] he's not fellowshipping with him out
[1:12:56] there but with his bride
[1:12:58] grace to us amen so in in the book of
[1:13:01] matthew
[1:13:02] 26 and
[1:13:05] let's begin to read let's see
[1:13:11] verse 17 now the first day of the feast
[1:13:14] of unleavened bread
[1:13:15] the disciples came to jesus saying unto
[1:13:19] him
[1:13:19] wherewith thou that we prepare for thee
[1:13:22] to eat
[1:13:23] the passover and he said go
[1:13:26] into the city to such a man and say to
[1:13:29] him
[1:13:29] the master saith my time is at hand
[1:13:32] i will keep the passover at thy house
[1:13:35] with my disciples
[1:13:37] amen as we have come and associated
[1:13:41] together
[1:13:42] to partake of the emblems of his shed
[1:13:43] blood and his broken body
[1:13:46] amen i pray grace to be with us
[1:13:50] and the disciples did as jesus appointed
[1:13:52] them
[1:13:53] and they made ready the passover
[1:13:56] amen now when the even was come
[1:14:00] he sat down with the twelve it was the
[1:14:03] evening time
[1:14:04] and we are in the evening time and as
[1:14:07] they did eat
[1:14:08] he said verily i say unto you that one
[1:14:10] of you
[1:14:11] shall betray me amazing
[1:14:14] and they were exceeding sorrowful
[1:14:17] and began every one of them to say unto
[1:14:20] him lord
[1:14:21] is it i and he answered and said he that
[1:14:25] dippeth is and with me
[1:14:27] in the dish the same shall betray me
[1:14:30] the son of man goeth as it is written of
[1:14:32] him but woe
[1:14:34] unto that man by whom the son of man is
[1:14:37] betrayed
[1:14:38] don't betray god in the word please
[1:14:41] amen because again the prophet warned us
[1:14:44] that there are judaistarian
[1:14:46] pretended brothers around the message
[1:14:49] he asked what he called him so be on
[1:14:51] your guard
[1:14:52] amen please love him serve him give your
[1:14:55] life
[1:14:56] to him give him control amen give him
[1:14:59] the preeminence
[1:15:00] you're not living for yourself you're
[1:15:01] living for him by the grace of god
[1:15:04] amen and he said the son of man goeth as
[1:15:07] it is written of him
[1:15:08] but woe unto that man by whom the son of
[1:15:12] man
[1:15:12] is betrayed it had been good for
[1:15:15] that man if he had been not been born
[1:15:19] and then judas which betrayed him
[1:15:22] answered and said master
[1:15:23] is it i amazing and he said unto him
[1:15:27] thou hast said
[1:15:31] and as they were eating
[1:15:34] jesus took bread
[1:15:38] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[1:15:40] to the disciples
[1:15:41] and said take eat this is my
[1:15:44] body amen and he took the cup and gave
[1:15:48] thanks and gave it to them saying drink
[1:15:52] ye all of it for this is my blood
[1:15:56] of the new testament which is shed for
[1:15:59] many
[1:16:00] for the remission of sins but i say unto
[1:16:03] you
[1:16:04] i will not drink its forth of this fruit
[1:16:06] of the vine
[1:16:07] until that day when i drink it new with
[1:16:10] you
[1:16:11] in my father's kingdom amen
[1:16:15] and when they had sung in him they went
[1:16:17] out
[1:16:18] onto the mount of olives where jesus
[1:16:21] prayed
[1:16:22] not my will father thine be done
[1:16:25] god bless his word you may be seated
[1:16:30] so we have gathered to partake of the
[1:16:34] emblems
[1:16:34] of his shed blood and his broken body
[1:16:38] amen it's been a long time since we had
[1:16:42] had communion
[1:16:44] since the covet 19 issue has been going
[1:16:46] on
[1:16:48] and uh we off we al also of course with
[1:16:51] the communion
[1:16:52] that we want to partake in jesus
[1:16:54] construct instructions regarding
[1:16:56] foot foot washing amen
[1:16:59] because he give us that example he's
[1:17:02] i've done unto you
[1:17:03] what i want you to do to one another
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:06] and i know that most churches today
[1:17:08] they've ignored it and a lot of churches
[1:17:10] today denominational they don't want
[1:17:11] anything to do with foot washing
[1:17:13] because they feel that we don't have to
[1:17:15] do that well if jesus did it to his
[1:17:17] disciples surely we can do it to one
[1:17:18] another
[1:17:19] amen and thank god for the for the honor
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:23] knowing that you're going to honor one
[1:17:25] another amen you're going to give
[1:17:27] give the the the blessings and right
[1:17:29] because you pray for one another you're
[1:17:31] praying god to bless that brother to
[1:17:32] bless that sister
[1:17:33] amen as the sisters will eventually go
[1:17:36] out here amen to
[1:17:37] take up the foot washing after we do the
[1:17:39] communion but also to remind you that uh
[1:17:42] in the communion that we are going to
[1:17:45] use the
[1:17:46] the little cups and ordinarily we use
[1:17:49] that that
[1:17:50] glass there and again as i've said let
[1:17:52] me say it again to those that have not
[1:17:54] heard it
[1:17:55] nor know it is that the this glass that
[1:17:58] i have here
[1:17:59] i received from uh brother george smith
[1:18:02] and
[1:18:02] brother branham's daughter rebecca had
[1:18:05] the time
[1:18:06] as before god took us to rebecca home
[1:18:09] and so
[1:18:09] they highlighted to me that the problem
[1:18:12] of god
[1:18:13] showed them these glasses and told them
[1:18:16] that he said this
[1:18:17] is like the one that jesus used
[1:18:21] only the one that jesus used of course
[1:18:23] was metal but he said this is what it
[1:18:25] look would look like
[1:18:26] he said it like this one and of course
[1:18:28] in the bradham tabernacle i assume
[1:18:30] that they kept they kept using that that
[1:18:33] kind of a glass
[1:18:35] and of course our brother george rebecca
[1:18:38] went out and purchased a number of them
[1:18:40] and they had them in their office and
[1:18:42] and they explained to me those things
[1:18:44] and then offered to send me a glass if i
[1:18:47] wanted one
[1:18:48] so they sent it and now ordinarily we
[1:18:49] would take that but because of
[1:18:52] the issues that are going on we'll take
[1:18:54] the use the small
[1:18:56] glasses and give it give a little glass
[1:18:59] of wine to each individual
[1:19:00] by the grace of god after by the grace
[1:19:03] of god after we have taken partake in
[1:19:05] all the unleavened bread and we thank
[1:19:08] our sister brenda
[1:19:10] in uh she she i used to do it for a
[1:19:13] number of years
[1:19:14] i would make the unleavened bread but
[1:19:15] now for the last
[1:19:17] few years i guess our sister brenda's
[1:19:19] been doing it for us
[1:19:20] so i pray that god will bless it for you
[1:19:22] and me
[1:19:23] amen but we'll go in and partake of the
[1:19:26] communion with a revelation with an
[1:19:28] understanding of what we are remembering
[1:19:31] he told us to do it in remembrance of
[1:19:33] him
[1:19:34] by the grace of god it's not do this not
[1:19:37] do that but it's this
[1:19:38] this is going to remind us of jesus this
[1:19:41] is going to remind us of what he did
[1:19:43] in that he laid down his life amen
[1:19:46] he shed his blood by the grace of god oh
[1:19:49] praise the lord
[1:19:50] this is absolutely amazing when we
[1:19:52] consider what he did
[1:19:54] when he did it where he did it amen and
[1:19:56] yet he knew
[1:19:57] and why did jesus feel so desperate
[1:20:00] the way that he did when he prayed and
[1:20:02] prayed and cried and cried and cried
[1:20:04] well it was because brother it wasn't
[1:20:06] just going out and doing it like
[1:20:08] like the like the thieves on the other
[1:20:11] crosses
[1:20:12] oh yeah they were there they were going
[1:20:14] to die and of course because
[1:20:16] they were still alive when the soldiers
[1:20:18] went there
[1:20:19] they went and they they drove a short
[1:20:22] into them
[1:20:22] oh no they broke their legs when it
[1:20:24] comes to this the soldiers
[1:20:26] they went and broke their legs amen why
[1:20:29] well they've been hanging on the cross
[1:20:30] hanging on the cross they were still
[1:20:32] alive
[1:20:33] so they broke their legs so that they
[1:20:35] would they would
[1:20:36] they would lose that that strength to
[1:20:38] keep themselves up on the cross
[1:20:40] because their feet was there under and
[1:20:42] oh yeah so they just
[1:20:43] maintain the pressure there and keep
[1:20:45] them up so they go keep breathing
[1:20:47] and so on but when they broke their legs
[1:20:50] their bodies
[1:20:51] sunk down and they couldn't couldn't
[1:20:53] keep up the body and what else
[1:20:55] they they couldn't breathe and finally
[1:20:58] they died
[1:20:59] that's right and they went and checked
[1:21:02] them they said he's dead
[1:21:03] he's dead and they went to jesus
[1:21:06] and they said oh he's gone but they
[1:21:09] didn't break his leg
[1:21:11] and that's why amen amen brother
[1:21:14] god got a plan god had a purpose god had
[1:21:17] a pattern
[1:21:18] amen and jesus was dead but they didn't
[1:21:20] break his legs why because
[1:21:22] he they didn't kill him
[1:21:25] he laid down his life amen
[1:21:29] he did it he chose it amen and he gave
[1:21:32] up the ghost
[1:21:33] amen they didn't take it from him he
[1:21:35] gave it up it's all see
[1:21:36] right on through his ministry right on
[1:21:38] through the the the
[1:21:40] how they treated him and everything amen
[1:21:42] brother
[1:21:43] it was jesus that endured it endured it
[1:21:46] endured it amen
[1:21:47] and when it comes to laying down his
[1:21:48] life no no they weren't going to take it
[1:21:51] no no he had to lay it down of himself
[1:21:53] because he did it to redeem us amen
[1:21:56] praise the name of the lord so he laid
[1:21:59] he gave up the ghost
[1:22:00] oh it wasn't like the the those that
[1:22:02] were on the other crosses
[1:22:04] no no no they said oh we got to kill
[1:22:06] them
[1:22:07] but jesus is funny how come he's dead
[1:22:12] amen he laid down his life he gave up
[1:22:15] the ghost
[1:22:16] amen oh yeah now they're going to do
[1:22:18] what needed to be done
[1:22:20] amen brother the crowning of his
[1:22:22] ministry the crowning of what he was
[1:22:25] ordained to do and what he wanted to do
[1:22:26] in redeeming
[1:22:27] you and me and brother it was
[1:22:31] the shedding of blood amen we won't get
[1:22:33] into that with the shedding of blood
[1:22:35] in the garden of eden that put us in sin
[1:22:38] it was a shedding of blood at calvary
[1:22:40] that took us out
[1:22:42] but it was his perfect blood amen
[1:22:45] that jesus laid down his life oh yeah
[1:22:48] and at the time there was no
[1:22:49] again where's his blood still in his
[1:22:51] body amen
[1:22:53] but when when those soldiers came they
[1:22:55] said he's dead and they took the sword
[1:22:57] or the spear that they had and they
[1:22:59] drove it in his side
[1:23:01] yeah and the blood came out amen all
[1:23:04] down to the cross all down on
[1:23:06] on the earth and into the earth amen to
[1:23:09] redeem us
[1:23:10] it was perfect sinless blood
[1:23:13] amen by the grace of god that's why
[1:23:16] jesus was born the way he was by the
[1:23:18] spoken word
[1:23:19] amen into the into the womb of mary
[1:23:22] oh no so it wasn't it wasn't mary's
[1:23:24] husband it wasn't a human being no no
[1:23:27] it was spoken word of god amen
[1:23:30] and she brought forth the son jesus he
[1:23:33] was born
[1:23:34] without sin amen there was
[1:23:37] what we weren't no no we weren't
[1:23:40] brother so he came to shed his blood to
[1:23:43] redeem us
[1:23:44] by grace to god be the glory
[1:23:47] amen so we in in the communion service
[1:23:51] we partake amen by wine
[1:23:54] representing his body representing his
[1:23:56] blood
[1:23:57] we partake of that wine and remembering
[1:23:59] calvary and say thank you jesus for what
[1:24:01] you did for me
[1:24:03] thank you jesus that you laid down your
[1:24:05] life for me
[1:24:06] amen but you picked it up again and
[1:24:09] shares it with me
[1:24:10] praise the lord hallelujah because he
[1:24:12] knew we needed redemption
[1:24:14] but he knew that we need we needed
[1:24:16] resurrection
[1:24:17] amen we needed his resurrection we
[1:24:19] needed his power we needed his anointing
[1:24:21] without him we can do nothing amen
[1:24:25] and surely brother if we can't do

[1:24:28] resurrection

[1:24:59] yeah what as a testimony redemption is
[1:25:02] done
[1:25:03] it's paid for the price has paid amen
[1:25:06] and the life of that body came back on
[1:25:08] the day of pentecost

[1:25:12] comfortless i
[1:25:13] will come to you amen hallelujah and he

[1:25:42] given me the decisions
[1:25:43] that i need made in my life give me the
[1:25:46] strength to do this the leadership to do
[1:25:48] that
[1:25:48] amen say again not my will thine be done
[1:25:52] the grace of god be with us brother amen
[1:25:55] as we eventually go in to partake of the
[1:25:57] emblems of his shed blood
[1:25:59] and of his broken body amen and the foot
[1:26:02] washing
[1:26:03] brother it's in evidence again token as
[1:26:05] it were of his life in us
[1:26:07] and lord as he humbled himself to peter
[1:26:10] we're humbling ourselves to one another
[1:26:12] that's right and yeah as i said he had
[1:26:15] more
[1:26:16] problems with peter than he had with
[1:26:17] judas when it come when it comes to
[1:26:20] questioning him doing this doing that
[1:26:22] don't do this don't do that
[1:26:24] because peter was right there to tell
[1:26:26] him oh stay away from jerusalem don't do
[1:26:28] this don't do that
[1:26:29] and what are you doing this world what
[1:26:30] are you doing that for yeah but
[1:26:32] according to scripture there's no other
[1:26:34] disciple question him so much as peter
[1:26:37] amen that's right but yet he was
[1:26:40] he was he was chosen of god to be there
[1:26:42] on the day of pentecost
[1:26:44] amen so it's not it's not the one that
[1:26:46] you choose
[1:26:47] not the one that this one choose that
[1:26:48] which is what god is the one god chooses
[1:26:51] amen praise the lord because maybe we
[1:26:54] would have went out and chose judas
[1:26:55] you know maybe we go and choose this one
[1:26:57] choose that one no no
[1:27:00] who did god choose amen so the grace of
[1:27:02] god
[1:27:03] that we have the leadership of the holy
[1:27:04] ghost amen but we know that the devil
[1:27:07] has come down with great wrath knowing
[1:27:08] his time is short
[1:27:10] and the devil brother as he was then so
[1:27:12] you
[1:27:13] in the garden of eden oh yeah yeah like
[1:27:15] i said he only only
[1:27:16] changed one word of what god has said
[1:27:19] he quoted what god has said and again
[1:27:21] understand he was he was the
[1:27:23] first evangelist you know in the garden
[1:27:26] of eden
[1:27:27] how he went preaching to it to eve when
[1:27:29] he found her out there looking at the
[1:27:30] trees of life and so on this and that
[1:27:32] something else
[1:27:33] amen and he said yea god said
[1:27:37] amazing first thing the devil does is
[1:27:39] quote the word
[1:27:41] amen and the devil quoted that word to
[1:27:44] do eve
[1:27:45] but he changed and he added one more but
[1:27:46] thou shalt not
[1:27:48] surely god said thou shalt surely die he
[1:27:50] said thou shalt not
[1:27:52] surely die yeah before he said and he
[1:27:55] and he tried to
[1:27:56] to get him to doubt god to doubt the
[1:27:58] word of god amen to question god oh yeah
[1:28:02] and she believed the devil instead of
[1:28:03] staying with god
[1:28:05] oh yeah well it was satan using the
[1:28:06] serpent amen
[1:28:08] so the serpent was satan through the
[1:28:10] serpent was deceiving her
[1:28:12] so the grace of god that we believe god
[1:28:16] that we're going to stay with the word
[1:28:17] amen we're going to make our calling
[1:28:19] election sure
[1:28:20] by the grace of god amen brother that's
[1:28:23] what we
[1:28:24] we we need now that's why they've needed
[1:28:26] all down through the ages
[1:28:28] and through the years is the grace of
[1:28:30] god amen
[1:28:33] why the grace of god for the grace of
[1:28:35] god to provide what we have need of
[1:28:37] it is by grace we're saved no
[1:28:41] it is by grace through faith are we
[1:28:44] saved
[1:28:45] and say faith is the revelation of the
[1:28:47] will of god for the age in which
[1:28:49] we live if you walk in the light even as
[1:28:52] he is in the light
[1:28:54] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:28:56] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:28:57] cleansed us from all unrighteousness
[1:29:00] amen but you've got to walk in the light
[1:29:02] amen it didn't it didn't give us the
[1:29:05] redemption
[1:29:05] and then oh well walk in the light if
[1:29:08] you see this if you see that
[1:29:10] amen brother amen no no
[1:29:13] you've got to walk in the light walk in
[1:29:15] the light and as you're walking in the
[1:29:16] light
[1:29:16] amen what's he doing he's looking for
[1:29:18] your faith
[1:29:20] amen he'll recognize your faith praise
[1:29:22] the lord and if you're
[1:29:23] your faith is real and you believe god
[1:29:26] and you believe in the finished work of
[1:29:27] calvary oh you're redeemed
[1:29:29] amen amen and again praise the lord if
[1:29:33] we're redeemed
[1:29:34] praise the lord if we have experienced
[1:29:35] redemption then brother we have true
[1:29:38] fellowship with one another not just
[1:29:40] with god
[1:29:41] but the testimony of your faith with god
[1:29:43] your fellowship with god
[1:29:44] is in your fellowship with one another
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:47] you love him well if you but again if
[1:29:51] you love him you're going to love one
[1:29:52] another
[1:29:53] amen as jesus said again as i preached
[1:29:56] there a few weeks ago whenever it was
[1:29:58] well it says you're going to hell i said
[1:30:00] not because of what you did
[1:30:02] and we condemn people for what they did
[1:30:05] but jesus says
[1:30:06] you're going to go to hell because of
[1:30:07] what you didn't do amen
[1:30:10] praise the lord why he said in matthew
[1:30:13] 24 there i believe
[1:30:14] and he said lord he said you do this you
[1:30:16] do this he said in as much as you
[1:30:18] didn't do it to the least of these my
[1:30:21] brethren you did it not to me and he
[1:30:24] pointed them to hell
[1:30:26] they were lost amen so brother we better
[1:30:29] be on our guard
[1:30:30] i'll tell you amen whatever's in your
[1:30:33] heart god sees yes

[1:30:40] one and i said oh but lord
[1:30:42] what about if they if they had a nice
[1:30:44] attitude and nice spirit and so on
[1:30:46] yes he said i know the heart he's not
[1:30:49] oh he goes beyond what you're doing
[1:30:51] contrary to his will
[1:30:53] amen oh yeah and he'll go into the heart
[1:30:55] to see
[1:30:57] why you did this and why you did that
[1:30:58] amen i tell you
[1:31:00] anybody with a right spirit right
[1:31:01] attitude god's not going to condemn them
[1:31:03] god's not going to kill them
[1:31:05] see again it's like william branham was
[1:31:06] condemning this one condemning that one
[1:31:08] until the angels came down said mother
[1:31:11] branham don't you condemn her
[1:31:13] he said some of them are my children and
[1:31:16] they're
[1:31:17] condemning this one because oh that
[1:31:18] woman she was in slacks
[1:31:20] or she was wearing this you maybe shed a
[1:31:21] haircut he says some of them
[1:31:23] are my children amen and as i said first
[1:31:27] when i come to the message
[1:31:28] so many believers brother we're looking
[1:31:30] down their noses
[1:31:32] oh they condemn this one condemn that
[1:31:33] one they're going to this church go to
[1:31:35] that church go to this denomination that
[1:31:36] denomination
[1:31:37] i said lord i said their spirit is not
[1:31:39] right because there goes
[1:31:41] them but for the grace of god amen
[1:31:44] so brother keep your attitude right your
[1:31:46] spirit right don't compromise with them
[1:31:48] but keep your attitude right toward them
[1:31:50] and pray for them
[1:31:51] amen shall the grace of god brother be
[1:31:54] with us that we're going to have the
[1:31:55] anointing of the life of christ
[1:31:57] in us amen the attitude that justly
[1:32:01] sanctified wesley rather and and then
[1:32:04] give the gifts
[1:32:05] and the anointing to the pentecostals
[1:32:07] amen but brother that anointing is
[1:32:09] increasing
[1:32:09] increasing increasing and now it's
[1:32:11] giving us resurrection and rapturing
[1:32:13] faith to the bride
[1:32:15] oh my this is tremendous god did that
[1:32:18] god did this
[1:32:18] god did that god did that down through
[1:32:21] the ages
[1:32:22] now what's he doing what's he doing now
[1:32:25] oh well brother if we don't recognize
[1:32:28] the resurrection rapture
[1:32:30] we should we will go back to pentecost
[1:32:33] oh yeah
[1:32:33] i say all your pentecost lord thank you
[1:32:36] for the gifts
[1:32:37] lord thank you for the anointing of the
[1:32:38] holy ghost amen
[1:32:40] yeah but the prophet as far as the word
[1:32:42] is concerned
[1:32:43] that's to take you on to the
[1:32:45] resurrection take you on
[1:32:47] to the rapture amen and the problem god
[1:32:50] said it's unfortunate
[1:32:52] he said pentecost failed to recognize
[1:32:54] its message
[1:32:56] amen pentecost has failed to recognize
[1:32:58] the capstone
[1:32:59] of what god did during the pentecost
[1:33:01] revival and the capstone
[1:33:03] is the resurrection rapture amen the
[1:33:07] capstone is being caught away to be with
[1:33:09] the lord
[1:33:09] in glory at the marriage supper of the
[1:33:12] lamb
[1:33:13] amen god help us
[1:33:16] amen and brother he did
[1:33:20] what he was ordained to do to give us
[1:33:22] access
[1:33:24] to the word to give us access
[1:33:27] to eternity by the grace of god
[1:33:30] praise the lord that we we can go now
[1:33:33] we can do what they couldn't do in
[1:33:35] previous previous ages or
[1:33:37] especially the jews oh they wanted this
[1:33:40] wanted that but no
[1:33:41] christ had to come first lay down his
[1:33:44] life
[1:33:45] take the body up bring come back in the
[1:33:47] life of the holy ghost

[1:33:55] on and on and on to eternity until we're
[1:33:58] going to step into a glorified body
[1:34:00] and he's going to go up and get into
[1:34:01] that body called jesus
[1:34:03] amen and he's going to come down and
[1:34:05] receive us unto himself
[1:34:07] praise the lord amen but he's here now
[1:34:11] amen sharing eternal life with us

[1:34:16] looking for that hour
[1:34:18] brother yeah where's jesus well he's
[1:34:20] maybe he's gone off to get
[1:34:22] to get into that but into that body

[1:34:42] into that body come down to welcome us
[1:34:45] praise the lord hallelujah what do you
[1:34:48] want to do
[1:34:49] well william branham said one time he
[1:34:51] said i want to introduce you to him
[1:34:54] he said yes in glory and he said if
[1:34:56] there's any
[1:34:57] and if there's anything that he wanted
[1:34:59] to do he said oh after after i've done
[1:35:01] this
[1:35:02] he said i want to i want to get down on
[1:35:04] my knees and i'll crawl up to him he
[1:35:06] said to touch his feet
[1:35:07] and to thank him for what he did oh god
[1:35:11] help us
[1:35:12] amen god help us
[1:35:15] indeed the grace of god be with us
[1:35:20] and there was a number of things that i
[1:35:22] wanted to share with you but we don't
[1:35:23] really have that time
[1:35:25] and concerning the fruit of the spirit
[1:35:29] and the works of the flesh amen
[1:35:32] the bible highlights both let's see
[1:35:34] what's got more and more
[1:35:36] we'll see later what has got more and
[1:35:38] more control
[1:35:39] in our lives is it are we going forward
[1:35:42] to
[1:35:42] in the holy ghost manifesting the fruit
[1:35:45] of the spirit
[1:35:46] okay let's challenge the lord willing
[1:35:49] will
[1:35:50] he will challenge us this is the fruit
[1:35:52] of the spirit
[1:35:53] so do you have this fruit in your life
[1:35:56] yeah or are we more sensitive to the
[1:35:59] to the works of the flesh more
[1:36:02] controlled by the works of the flesh
[1:36:05] grace brother by the grace of god
[1:36:08] and when it comes to the works of the
[1:36:10] flesh the bible goes on with
[1:36:12] 17 works
[1:36:17] that that are in the flesh that the
[1:36:19] enemy is working on
[1:36:20] to control us yeah but
[1:36:23] when it comes to the fruit of the spirit
[1:36:28] there's just a very few and the bible in
[1:36:31] one place
[1:36:32] highlights nine fruits of the spirit
[1:36:36] so let's see we'll we'll consider that
[1:36:39] later
[1:36:39] and and i'm going to challenge you to
[1:36:42] read it i'm going to challenge you to
[1:36:43] look at it i'm going to challenge you to
[1:36:45] study it
[1:36:46] and say do i have the fruit of the
[1:36:48] spirit
[1:36:49] amen or am i more subject to the works
[1:36:52] of the flesh
[1:36:53] amen because the bible does highlight
[1:36:57] the works of the flesh and tell us what
[1:37:00] it is
[1:37:00] and the bible highlights the fruit of
[1:37:02] the spirit
[1:37:04] so if you want to know what anointing is
[1:37:06] in control of your life
[1:37:07] go to the word and amen and judge
[1:37:10] yourself
[1:37:12] am i bringing forth the fruit of the
[1:37:13] spirit or am i still bringing forth the
[1:37:15] works of the flesh
[1:37:17] what's controlling me grace
[1:37:21] oh yeah i'll tell you this oh well i'm
[1:37:23] born again i'm a christian and so on
[1:37:25] yeah but even as a christian there's
[1:37:28] there's certain things when it comes to
[1:37:30] the flesh
[1:37:32] oh yeah that you're hungry and thirsting
[1:37:34] for
[1:37:35] and brother there and there there are
[1:37:37] certain things in our flesh
[1:37:39] that brother there's only one way to get
[1:37:40] rid of it and that is when we get out of
[1:37:43] out of this body and into a glorified
[1:37:44] body
[1:37:47] definitely yeah oh my god help us
[1:37:52] to be sensitive to his leadership
[1:37:55] sensitive to the revelation of the word
[1:37:57] sensitive to brother to what he's done
[1:37:59] and what he's doing
[1:38:00] in us with us sensitive brother to what
[1:38:04] we were we were dealing with in our
[1:38:05] flesh
[1:38:06] and before we were born again and what
[1:38:08] are we dealing with now
[1:38:10] that we're born again grace
[1:38:14] grace of god i'll tell you this amen
[1:38:18] grace and again as i said there's nine
[1:38:21] fruits of the spirit oh
[1:38:25] and there's maybe 20 odd works of the
[1:38:28] flesh
[1:38:30] that we're fighting with because the
[1:38:32] devil's working on this
[1:38:34] but god's working on the spirit amen but
[1:38:37] the devil's
[1:38:38] is trying to get more more conscious of
[1:38:39] our flesh and what the flesh wants
[1:38:42] what the flesh looks for amen but
[1:38:45] brother i pray grace
[1:38:46] that the spirit has more control than
[1:38:48] the flesh
[1:38:50] oh yes i tell you there's no way there's
[1:38:52] much when it comes to the works of the
[1:38:54] flesh
[1:38:54] there's much that we want we won't get
[1:38:57] absolutely away
[1:38:58] from until we we're into a glorified
[1:39:00] body
[1:39:01] yeah i tell you if you're born again
[1:39:04] you're living from the inside out
[1:39:06] the holy ghost in your soul and he's
[1:39:08] there
[1:39:09] to get in to control your spirit because
[1:39:11] they're instincts of your spirit
[1:39:14] their spirit wants this this this but
[1:39:16] then beyond that
[1:39:17] is the instincts of your flesh amen
[1:39:20] oh my there's much there in the flesh
[1:39:22] and the devil is working with you in
[1:39:24] your mind
[1:39:25] yeah in your head in your brain amen
[1:39:29] oh you feel this you feel this you see
[1:39:30] this you see this you see that
[1:39:32] oh yeah but god amen god promised a new
[1:39:36] birth you shall be born again
[1:39:37] what for to get us to control
[1:39:41] the nature of your spirit and control
[1:39:44] the thoughts of your mind and the nature
[1:39:46] of the flesh
[1:39:47] amen oh yes now there's some natures
[1:39:50] that god just takes away
[1:39:52] but then there's other natures that stay
[1:39:54] it's there
[1:39:55] we have to deal with it but if you're
[1:39:57] born again you control hit
[1:39:59] you don't let it control you amen
[1:40:03] oh my i pray god give you the revelation
[1:40:06] of it
[1:40:07] oh yeah i don't know william branham had
[1:40:09] to deal with it
[1:40:11] when it comes to the nature of his flesh
[1:40:13] oh yeah
[1:40:14] and there he was a prophet there he was
[1:40:16] the people not understanding he get up
[1:40:17] there and discern the thoughts and
[1:40:19] intentions of the heart
[1:40:20] past present future yeah get up there
[1:40:24] and as i said
[1:40:25] and he take their hand in his and then
[1:40:27] he would oh
[1:40:28] you got this problem he knew what he
[1:40:30] knew what was troubling them in sickness
[1:40:32] oh yeah he knew a spirit was bothering
[1:40:35] them
[1:40:36] and it was absolutely the truth but yet
[1:40:38] then
[1:40:39] he said oh when when he go to a certain
[1:40:41] place
[1:40:42] and he said to minister certain
[1:40:44] countries and he said oh
[1:40:46] he said what did he do he said i got to
[1:40:48] take a cross in my pocket
[1:40:50] so you take a cross in his pocket why he
[1:40:52] said because over there he said the
[1:40:54] women would come right up he said
[1:40:55] to you oh yeah
[1:40:58] i approached her right away yeah just
[1:41:02] think of that
[1:41:02] so he was dealing with that spirit of
[1:41:05] the of the women or
[1:41:06] or them coming up if you if he was
[1:41:08] walking somewhere
[1:41:09] so he said i got to take the pocket take
[1:41:11] the cross with me
[1:41:12] amazing why because again
[1:41:16] brother he was he was born again but in
[1:41:19] his heart and his soul
[1:41:20] he was a new nature he's a new creature
[1:41:22] amen like you like me
[1:41:24] born again but still dealing with the
[1:41:28] weakness of the flesh oh yeah because
[1:41:31] the enemy is there to get oh
[1:41:33] work on this work on that the flesh the
[1:41:35] flesh the flesh
[1:41:36] amen don't let the flesh control you let
[1:41:38] jesus control
[1:41:40] amen so when the the enemy is working
[1:41:42] here oh yeah
[1:41:45] and i've got it here in my bible
[1:41:46] somewhere the instincts of the flesh
[1:41:49] see taste feel smell and hear
[1:41:53] and the instincts of your spirit
[1:41:57] is imagination conscience memory reason
[1:42:01] affection yeah so the enemy through your
[1:42:04] mind
[1:42:04] is working on those instincts to get you
[1:42:07] to surrender to that
[1:42:08] do this do this do that no you put it
[1:42:11] under god's control
[1:42:12] amen by the grace of god oh yes

[1:42:32] amen the devil is put out jesus comes in
[1:42:36] by the holy ghost
[1:42:37] in your soul to control your spirit and
[1:42:40] through the spirit to control your
[1:42:41] thoughts
[1:42:42] yeah controlling the what the devil is
[1:42:45] trying to
[1:42:46] tempt you with in your flesh and there's
[1:42:48] a lot that he can tempt us with
[1:42:50] in our flesh amen but the holy ghost is
[1:42:53] there
[1:42:54] when the enemy comes in all through the
[1:42:56] mind the holy ghost comes up through the
[1:42:58] heart
[1:42:59] it is written it is written thus saith
[1:43:02] the lord
[1:43:03] amen god is there to con to give us
[1:43:06] control
[1:43:07] brother hallelujah see people don't

[1:43:13] i got a new nature
[1:43:14] yeah but you got a new nature in your
[1:43:15] soul but not in not in your flesh
[1:43:18] amen because you're going to suffer
[1:43:22] things
[1:43:22] and feel things in your flesh that
[1:43:25] you're not you won't even know
[1:43:27] in your new body in your glorified body
[1:43:30] because all that stuff is going to be
[1:43:31] gone god help us
[1:43:36] amen so what you do make sure
[1:43:39] you got a right spirit the right
[1:43:40] attitude amen
[1:43:42] you control hit it doesn't control you
[1:43:47] amen grace and brother
[1:43:50] we'll get into i want to get into this
[1:43:52] but we'll do it later and that's the
[1:43:53] message called you must
[1:43:55] be born again amen
[1:43:58] so i trusted by grace we were professing
[1:44:01] maybe
[1:44:02] oh yeah i've been born again yeah
[1:44:05] but who's in control the flesh or the
[1:44:08] spirit
[1:44:09] show the grace of god be with us and uh
[1:44:13] this is a message bear with me
[1:44:16] oh this is a message that the brother
[1:44:19] preached on communion and it was the
[1:44:22] last
[1:44:22] message he preached so i don't know why
[1:44:26] there are believers who feel that we
[1:44:29] don't have to take communion
[1:44:31] something wrong somewhere so it got to
[1:44:34] be the enemy's influence
[1:44:35] because the prophet of god did say
[1:44:39] concerning communion
[1:44:48] he's talking about this world that we're
[1:44:49] living in and again like i said
[1:44:52] this was in 1965 december the 12th and
[1:44:55] was only maybe a few days later
[1:44:57] and the lord took him home yeah
[1:45:01] and he said this
[1:45:05] he said we can't stay too much longer he
[1:45:08] said we'll be in a complete
[1:45:10] insane institution and we are living in
[1:45:13] an insane world
[1:45:14] i'll tell you this when it comes to the
[1:45:16] world in general
[1:45:19] mainly insanity what they do how they do
[1:45:21] it when they do it where they do it
[1:45:23] it's an insane world they're more under
[1:45:25] the control of the devil
[1:45:26] and not jesus
[1:45:30] so brother not it's not going to get
[1:45:32] insane it is insane
[1:45:34] amen and brother when it comes to cobra
[1:45:37] 19 it's bringing out the insanity
[1:45:40] grace he said so he said we'll be in a
[1:45:44] complete
[1:45:44] insane institution and he said listen
[1:45:47] he said and he said there's something
[1:45:51] that
[1:45:52] been directly given to us by the word of
[1:45:55] god and manifested publicly before us
[1:45:58] that we know we are here
[1:46:01] amen we are at the time what of insanity
[1:46:06] and he said
[1:46:10] he said anything that has a beginning as
[1:46:13] an end
[1:46:15] amen and he said and it's that which had
[1:46:18] not the beginning as knowing
[1:46:21] and we're fixing to observe something
[1:46:23] here that's really sacred
[1:46:25] and he said i
[1:46:28] was called a few days ago to some
[1:46:31] very fine christian gentleman
[1:46:35] and it says and he understood that we
[1:46:38] take communion literally
[1:46:41] they take it what they call spiritual
[1:46:43] communion
[1:46:45] and there's believers today that won't
[1:46:47] take the bread and wine
[1:46:48] because they feel that they're taking
[1:46:50] the revelation of the word and it is
[1:46:51] spiritual
[1:46:53] i've had to deal with those spirits
[1:46:55] among believers
[1:46:57] and brother as he said they take it what
[1:47:01] they call spiritual communion
[1:47:03] and which is as far as communion i'd say
[1:47:06] all right communicate and he said the
[1:47:10] brother gave me the scripture brother
[1:47:11] benham
[1:47:12] don't you know this and
[1:47:15] he said see the reason i'm saying this
[1:47:18] so that you
[1:47:19] would understand what you're doing and
[1:47:22] if you walk
[1:47:23] into anything blindly you don't know
[1:47:26] where
[1:47:26] what you're doing you can't even con you
[1:47:29] can't even
[1:47:30] have confidence he said if you don't
[1:47:32] know what you're doing
[1:47:34] we got to know what we're doing when we
[1:47:36] take communion
[1:47:37] and foot washing yeah
[1:47:40] but he said you must understand what you
[1:47:44] are doing and why you are doing it
[1:47:46] amen god help us don't take it as a
[1:47:48] tradition
[1:47:50] no no just a religious tradition we're
[1:47:52] going to do this we're going to do that
[1:47:54] no
[1:47:54] it's it's part of our spiritual worship
[1:47:58] it's a part of our spiritual
[1:47:59] relationship with jesus
[1:48:02] no don't do it as a tradition
[1:48:06] you must understand what you are doing
[1:48:09] and why you are doing it
[1:48:16] now he said if we take the word of god
[1:48:18] isn't that
[1:48:19] god that we're taking amen yes
[1:48:22] exactly right it's true but we read
[1:48:25] ear that paul taught taking the literal
[1:48:29] lord's supper this do in remembrance of
[1:48:32] me
[1:48:33] said jesus see as often as you do it
[1:48:37] in remembrance of me you show forth the
[1:48:40] lord's
[1:48:41] death till he come amen
[1:48:45] and those that believe the message and
[1:48:46] believe that he has come
[1:48:48] and spiritually he has come oh yeah the
[1:48:51] fullness of the god of bodily in the
[1:48:53] bride
[1:48:54] praise the name of the lord but still
[1:48:56] we're physically we're in this body
[1:48:59] by the grace of god still there but with
[1:49:01] the blessed hope
[1:49:03] amen and that's why we take the
[1:49:05] communion and we're constantly reminded
[1:49:08] of eternity the price is paid
[1:49:11] for us to get into that glorified body
[1:49:14] we're still believing for it
[1:49:15] still believing amen for the
[1:49:18] resurrection of the rapture
[1:49:20] as long as we are in this body
[1:49:23] we need to take communion
[1:49:26] amen to confirm our faith praise the
[1:49:30] lord
[1:49:31] in calgary to confirm our faith
[1:49:34] in the finished work of calvary praise
[1:49:37] the lord
[1:49:40] he said you must understand what you are
[1:49:42] doing and
[1:49:43] why you are doing it and if we take the
[1:49:45] word of god
[1:49:47] isn't that god we're taking and he said
[1:49:50] listen
[1:49:51] exactly right sir it's true but we read
[1:49:53] here
[1:49:54] he said paul taught taking the literal
[1:49:56] lord's supper
[1:49:58] this do in remembrance of me amen see
[1:50:02] now we are to take it so he said we
[1:50:05] understand that saint paul
[1:50:06] who ordained it in the church being the
[1:50:09] prophet of the new
[1:50:10] testament he said peter james john all
[1:50:12] of them
[1:50:13] they wrote matthew mark luke they wrote
[1:50:16] what jesus
[1:50:17] did but paul set the thing
[1:50:21] in order he was the prophet
[1:50:24] of the new testament amen praise the
[1:50:28] lord
[1:50:29] and he said under there they had a
[1:50:31] sacrificial lamb
[1:50:32] that israel kept that for a memorial it
[1:50:35] was actually
[1:50:36] used one time coming out of egypt amen
[1:50:40] but then they kept that as a memorial
[1:50:42] all down through the age
[1:50:44] and brother as they kept that as a
[1:50:46] memorial in israel
[1:50:47] brother we keep this as a memorial until
[1:50:50] we're changed into a body
[1:50:52] like his glorious body amen
[1:50:56] and he said i do believe that communion
[1:50:59] is the lord's supper and we only have
[1:51:02] three
[1:51:03] physical divine orders left to us
[1:51:06] and one of them is communion feet
[1:51:09] washing
[1:51:10] and water baptism and he said that's the
[1:51:13] only three things
[1:51:15] that's the perfection of the three and
[1:51:17] that's the only three orders we have
[1:51:20] amen now we would say the communion
[1:51:22] should be
[1:51:23] taking the word i don't believe anyone
[1:51:26] has a right to take the lord's supper
[1:51:28] until he has taken the word of the lord
[1:51:31] into his heart
[1:51:33] amen and on the same basis we could
[1:51:37] absolutely justify salvation
[1:51:40] army yeah out there he said they do not
[1:51:43] believe in any form of water baptism
[1:51:46] said we don't need it and now he said if
[1:51:49] we don't need water baptism
[1:51:51] why are we baptized the water can't save
[1:51:54] you
[1:51:54] the blood saves you and he said i'll
[1:51:57] agree
[1:51:58] and he said the blood saves you not the
[1:52:00] water but we must
[1:52:02] take the water as an outward emotion
[1:52:05] amen that an inward work of grace
[1:52:08] has been done and is referring to water
[1:52:10] baptism
[1:52:11] amen water baptism
[1:52:14] represents our faith in the death burial
[1:52:17] resurrection of jesus
[1:52:19] amen they'll take you and lay you down
[1:52:21] and
[1:52:22] bury you in the water but you rise again
[1:52:24] amen you're testifying
[1:52:26] yeah you're going to die for him with
[1:52:28] him but when you come back you're going
[1:52:30] to receive his life
[1:52:32] he's anointed in your heart i pray grace
[1:52:34] for the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:52:36] as brother matthew was praying amen for
[1:52:39] the united the holy ghost and those that
[1:52:40] were baptized
[1:52:42] you know and ye shall receive the gift
[1:52:46] of the holy ghost amen and that's christ
[1:52:50] amen what's he doing he's acknowledging
[1:52:53] your faith
[1:52:54] in your water baptism and he's
[1:52:56] responding to that faith
[1:52:58] amen to take control amen is christ in
[1:53:01] you the hope of glory
[1:53:03] praise the lord see just things you do
[1:53:07] but then it says repent be baptized as
[1:53:10] you
[1:53:11] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:53:12] holy ghost that's god
[1:53:14] amen you repent you get baptized but
[1:53:17] then
[1:53:18] you're looking for the anointing of the
[1:53:19] holy ghost christ in you the hope of
[1:53:21] glory
[1:53:23] amen god help us amen
[1:53:27] so i pray the grace of god that baptized
[1:53:30] our young people that weren't baptized
[1:53:32] in water
[1:53:33] with the holy ghost exactly
[1:53:36] amen is god confirming your faith
[1:53:41] praise the lord
[1:53:45] he said now if we would say communion
[1:53:47] should be just
[1:53:48] taking the word i don't believe anyone
[1:53:50] has a right to take the lord's supper
[1:53:52] until he has taken the word of the lord
[1:53:54] into his heart
[1:53:56] amen praise the lord so you're you're
[1:54:00] you're gonna let you're allowed to take
[1:54:01] the lord's supper
[1:54:02] if you have taken the word of the lord
[1:54:05] into your heart
[1:54:06] amen
[1:54:12] and again he said take the water when it
[1:54:13] comes to the water baptism
[1:54:15] and so on and he said
[1:54:19] we must take the water as an outward
[1:54:21] emotion that an inward work of grace has
[1:54:24] been done
[1:54:25] so must we on communion
[1:54:29] amen testifying of the grace of god
[1:54:33] and the anointing of god and we're born
[1:54:35] again
[1:54:36] amen he laid down his life for us and he
[1:54:39] came back and shared it with us
[1:54:41] amen
[1:54:44] and he said when we have taken the lord
[1:54:46] our sacrifice
[1:54:47] into us as a matter of spiritual birth
[1:54:51] and his body we live by him by the word
[1:54:54] and also and says we should also
[1:54:57] symbolize it because it's a commandment
[1:54:59] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:55:03] in the name of jesus christ
[1:55:05] for the remission of your sins
[1:55:08] amen and again there are those that deny
[1:55:12] part of baptism in the name and i did
[1:55:15] hear a
[1:55:17] pentecostal pastor preach
[1:55:20] concerning salvation repent
[1:55:24] and be baptized but he
[1:55:28] oh yes he quoted the scripture and i
[1:55:31] said oh
[1:55:32] oh amazing he quoted it says be baptized
[1:55:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ or
[1:55:38] in the name of jesus christ
[1:55:40] and he quoted that scripture but
[1:55:43] he skipped that part he should repent
[1:55:46] and be baptized
[1:55:47] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:55:49] holy ghost
[1:55:51] you omitted baptized in the name
[1:55:54] he omitted it i heard him on radio
[1:55:56] preaching
[1:55:57] i said oh my lord as he is directly
[1:56:01] denying the word oh yeah he quoted it
[1:56:06] but skipped where it says the name
[1:56:09] of the lord jesus skipped it
[1:56:13] brother i'll tell you
[1:56:18] when it comes to marriage and i said
[1:56:20] there's a token
[1:56:23] that that the couple makes one to the
[1:56:25] other
[1:56:26] yeah and she takes his name
[1:56:30] amen she changed their name to take his
[1:56:32] name
[1:56:33] a lot are not doing that this this day
[1:56:35] and age amen
[1:56:37] but again that's like as the natural
[1:56:39] types of spiritual
[1:56:40] because there's a lot that gets baptized
[1:56:43] but they don't want to get take his name
[1:56:46] oh yeah that's the truth to identify
[1:56:47] with jesus
[1:56:49] the lord jesus christ amen that's why
[1:56:51] they just go out and get baptized in the
[1:56:54] oh in the name of the father and of the
[1:56:56] son
[1:56:57] not in the names in the name amen
[1:57:00] of the father singular in the name of
[1:57:03] the father and of the son
[1:57:04] and of the holy ghost amen and you will
[1:57:07] get the holy ghost
[1:57:08] amen by the grace of god
[1:57:11] so it's the lord the father
[1:57:15] jesus son christ the holy ghost
[1:57:19] amen that's what that's what those names
[1:57:21] represent
[1:57:22] amen so it's not three persons it's the
[1:57:25] three
[1:57:26] manifestations of god the three nature
[1:57:28] the three characters as it were
[1:57:30] that that is that you're dealing with
[1:57:32] god
[1:57:33] as the father you're looking at god as
[1:57:36] the son
[1:57:37] and god is the holy ghost in us christ
[1:57:40] the united one
[1:57:41] grace amen thank god for the revelation
[1:57:45] of that word and thank god for the grace
[1:57:47] to obey it
[1:57:48] amen thank you jesus
[1:57:54] but again like i said that when i i
[1:57:56] don't i don't hold the generation before
[1:57:58] me
[1:57:58] for that that's that's what god
[1:58:01] god revealed amen in this hour the lord
[1:58:05] thank the lord
[1:58:06] now god requires it amen why is god
[1:58:10] coming now with the with the revelation
[1:58:11] of the name because now
[1:58:13] the bride and the right room are united
[1:58:16] amen
[1:58:17] and she takes the name praise the lord
[1:58:20] as someone i think one time asked our
[1:58:22] brother matthew there what does the
[1:58:24] wedding ring mean
[1:58:25] symbolize and i said the wedding ring is
[1:58:28] is the token of the covenant they made
[1:58:32] in marriage so i said they they take
[1:58:35] this they take that
[1:58:36] and i said a constant reminder of the
[1:58:38] covenant
[1:58:39] by the grace of god yeah amen
[1:58:44] i won't keep you much longer
[1:58:49] and he said there are three things that
[1:58:52] we must
[1:58:53] three things that we must do as symbols
[1:58:56] the lord's supper foot washing water
[1:58:58] baptism
[1:58:59] and so on and he said
[1:59:02] now when we take this communion it isn't
[1:59:05] just a thing
[1:59:06] i'm coming up here i'm going to eat some
[1:59:08] bread and i believe i'm a christian
[1:59:10] but if you noticed the bible said he
[1:59:13] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:59:16] shall be guilty of the blood and body of
[1:59:19] the lord
[1:59:20] you've got to live a life amen before
[1:59:24] the people
[1:59:24] that before god and the people that
[1:59:26] shows you
[1:59:28] are sincere and he said now just a
[1:59:31] moment longer
[1:59:32] and he said in the old testament when
[1:59:35] the sacrifice was made
[1:59:36] a statue or an ordinance and so is water
[1:59:39] baptism and ordinance
[1:59:41] so is feet washing and ordinance so is
[1:59:43] the lord's supper and ordinance
[1:59:45] blessed is he that does all of his
[1:59:47] ordinance and keeps all his statutes
[1:59:50] all of his commandments that he might
[1:59:52] have a right to enter into the tree of
[1:59:54] life
[1:59:55] amen praise the name of the lord
[2:00:01] now he said finally over and over it
[2:00:05] went again
[2:00:06] over and over it kept going until
[2:00:08] finally it become a tradition
[2:00:10] and he said the commandment of god
[2:00:12] became a tradition to the people
[2:00:14] amen and we'll let's see and so on he
[2:00:17] said he went
[2:00:18] down well lord here's my bullet see
[2:00:22] there's no sincerity in it
[2:00:25] and there's no understanding to it and
[2:00:28] there's many that take communion
[2:00:29] but they're not sincere amen and they
[2:00:32] don't really
[2:00:33] understand all they're doing is well
[2:00:36] jesus said
[2:00:37] take this wine that that represents my
[2:00:39] blood and take this bread that
[2:00:40] represents my broken body
[2:00:42] but to them it's just history but not a
[2:00:45] present tense revelation
[2:00:46] grace and he said
[2:00:51] no sincerity and there's no
[2:00:53] understanding
[2:00:54] he said we don't want to take communion
[2:00:57] like that
[2:00:58] we want to take it with sincerity and
[2:01:01] with with understanding
[2:01:03] amen thank you jesus for redeeming me
[2:01:06] amen praise the lord
[2:01:10] and he said you've got to be sincere god
[2:01:13] wants the depths of your heart
[2:01:15] amen he said you remember the very god
[2:01:18] that brought you here on earth
[2:01:20] is the one you're serving and you're
[2:01:22] doing this because he said so
[2:01:24] amen it's his order
[2:01:28] and then he said we want to come up with
[2:01:30] deepness of sincerity
[2:01:31] knowing that by god's grace we have been
[2:01:34] saved
[2:01:35] amen and we love him and we feel his
[2:01:39] presence
[2:01:40] we see it change our lives our old being
[2:01:43] is changed and he said we're different
[2:01:45] people we don't live like we used to

[2:02:39] there that life of water was poured upon
[2:02:41] it
[2:02:42] and it began to grow and brother bam
[2:02:45] snapped his fingers three times and now
[2:02:48] he said that old life was forgiven
[2:02:50] put in the sea of god's forgetfulness to
[2:02:53] never be remembered against me

[2:12:48] first corinthians chapter 11
[2:12:53] praise the lord
[2:12:57] grace of god be with us as i said i read
[2:13:00] somewhere too online where some brother
[2:13:03] had announced and i don't think they
[2:13:05] were believers but they announced that
[2:13:07] they had been 16
[2:13:08] months since they had since they had the
[2:13:11] communion last
[2:13:12] and they were also having communion
[2:13:14] apparently this weekend i think
[2:13:16] so i pray the grace of god to the
[2:13:18] believers
[2:13:19] who feel so deprived of not being able
[2:13:22] to come and take the bread and wine
[2:13:25] grace grace grace amen so in
[2:13:28] first corinthians chapter 11 i'm
[2:13:30] beginning to read at verse 23
[2:13:32] and again we'll read respectively as i
[2:13:36] read 23
[2:13:37] and the congregation 24 and every second
[2:13:40] verse
[2:13:41] amen until we all read the 34th
[2:13:45] verse 23 says for i every seed of the
[2:13:48] lord
[2:13:49] that which also i delivered unto you
[2:13:52] that thus that the lord jesus the same
[2:13:55] night in which he was betrayed took
[2:13:59] bread amen
[2:14:10] amen after the same manner also he took
[2:14:14] the cup

[2:14:22] as he drink it in remembrance of me
[2:14:32] praise the lord thank you jesus
[2:14:35] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:14:39] and drink this cup of the lord
[2:14:40] unworthily or casually

[2:14:46] the lord
[2:14:53] amen lord grace for he that eateth and
[2:14:56] drinketh unworthily
[2:14:57] eateth and bringeth damnation to himself
[2:15:01] not discerning the lord's body

[2:15:12] should not
[2:15:13] be judged

[2:15:23] together to eat
