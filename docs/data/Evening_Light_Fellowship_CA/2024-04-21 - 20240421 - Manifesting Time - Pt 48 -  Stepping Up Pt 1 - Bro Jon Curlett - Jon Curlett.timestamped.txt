[44:53] more years amen sister leise it's good
[44:55] to see you as well God bless you this
[44:57] this morning 1 Corinthians 13 it was
[44:59] funny I was talking to brother Kingsley
[45:00] on Thursday and we were talking about
[45:02] you know reading your Bible and
[45:04] sometimes we we read it and it can be a
[45:06] bit of form it can just be a habit you
[45:09] know and and the prophet of God told us
[45:11] he said if you don't see Christ in every
[45:13] page go back and read it again and I I
[45:15] told him I said I've been preaching out
[45:16] of First Corinthians for so long in this
[45:19] series and then I said I came up to it
[45:21] my devotions in 1 Corinthians 12 and I
[45:23] said that's basically all I've been
[45:24] reading for the last few Services it's
[45:26] hard to get some something more out of
[45:27] it when you've been just studying it and
[45:29] studying it and studying it so I said I
[45:31] went back and I read it and I said I
[45:32] went to reading my Bible till something
[45:34] new came out of it you know so that's
[45:36] what we've got to do this morning is
[45:37] we're going to preach from a very
[45:39] familiar portion of scripture but
[45:40] trusting we'll get something more out of
[45:42] it than we've gotten before 1
[45:44] Corinthians
[45:45] 13:11 Paul says when I was a child I
[45:48] spake as a child I understood as a child
[45:51] I thought as a child we all are children
[45:54] at some point nobody jumps straight to
[45:56] adult Hood he says but when I became a
[45:59] man I put away childish things for now
[46:02] we see through a glass Darkly but then
[46:05] face to face now I know in part but then
[46:09] shall I know even as also I am known
[46:12] amen God bless you can have your seats
[46:14] this morning we're continuing our series
[46:15] on manifesting time and I want to take a
[46:18] a title a subtitle this morning of
[46:20] stepping up and we've talked about our
[46:22] adopted positions at different times
[46:24] over the last few weeks and we'll we'll
[46:26] we'll kind of revisit that a bit this
[46:28] morning and we read the quotes in the
[46:30] scriptures where brother B says God will
[46:32] present himself to a person and he'll
[46:34] speak to them and then he'll commission
[46:36] them and then he anoints them and then
[46:37] he sends them on their way to do his
[46:39] work and then if they'll stay true to it
[46:41] then he backs them up and they do the
[46:42] works of God himself literally on this
[46:45] Earth and you know we can paint this
[46:47] idea that when we come into adoption
[46:49] that when when God adopts us we're going
[46:50] to step up into a higher position we're
[46:53] going to step up into a more spiritual
[46:55] position and our lives will changed
[46:57] dramatically and I don't I don't say
[46:58] that's not true I believe it's true but
[47:00] I think for what we're going to see here
[47:02] is that for many of us where we are at
[47:05] is already our adopted position where
[47:07] we're at and what God has already done
[47:09] in our life God has placed us just
[47:11] exactly where he wants us to be and what
[47:13] needs to happen is our Revelation needs
[47:15] to increase about where we are and why
[47:17] we're doing these things and so what we
[47:19] need is a revelation of where God has
[47:21] placed us and what our purpose is and
[47:23] we'll find so often we're right in the
[47:24] middle of it and when we realize that
[47:26] this is not just me it's God then all of
[47:28] a sudden things start to change around
[47:29] us and Paul would say this just to read
[47:31] 1 Corinthians 13 again he says when I
[47:33] was a child I spake as a child I
[47:36] understood as a child I thought as a
[47:37] child but when I became a man I put away
[47:40] childish things he says for now we see
[47:43] through a glass Darkly we don't see
[47:45] everything clear just now amen and I
[47:47] believe that's a reflection of the
[47:49] childish side but as you come more into
[47:50] maturity he says that then face to face
[47:53] now I know in part now I have a a
[47:56] portion of what is real of what is true
[47:58] of what is mature he says but then shall
[48:00] I know even as also I am known so Paul
[48:04] points that we have to mature in the
[48:06] natural but he's speaking to Believers
[48:08] so we've got to mature in the spiritual
[48:11] and he says so when we come into Christ
[48:13] we're going to think in a way that is
[48:14] childish we're going to understand as a
[48:17] child we're going to we're going to
[48:19] speak as a child but as we come into
[48:21] maturity we put away those childish
[48:24] things and Paul says there's three
[48:26] things that we have to change we have to
[48:28] change our speech we have to change our
[48:31] understanding and we have to change our
[48:33] thinking because they have to move from
[48:35] Childish thinking childish CH talking
[48:38] childish understanding now into manly or
[48:40] womanly ways of doing those things and
[48:42] you'll find that one feeds into the
[48:44] other you can't just go all three at the
[48:47] same time but you've got to get the
[48:48] first one into into the adult side and
[48:51] then the next one will fall into the
[48:52] adult side and then the next one will
[48:54] fall into the adult side amen and the
[48:56] first thing we've got to get right is
[48:57] our thinking because everything starts
[48:59] up here that's that's the great
[49:01] Battlefield and what does mature
[49:03] thinking look like it brings everything
[49:05] back to the word that's what a mature
[49:07] believer does is they filter everything
[49:10] back through the word and no matter what
[49:11] we we have in terms of thoughts and
[49:13] positions and opinions we always bring
[49:16] it back to the word it doesn't matter
[49:17] what the world is saying it doesn't
[49:19] matter what social media is buzzing
[49:20] about it doesn't matter what the Norms
[49:22] are today it doesn't even matter what
[49:24] our church Traditions are amen but what
[49:27] we do is in our mature thinking we say
[49:29] what does the word say about this and we
[49:32] bring our our thinking subject to what
[49:34] the word says amen and where the word is
[49:37] silent we're silent you'll see brother
[49:40] Brown talking about in the seals he says
[49:42] where the word or in the church ages
[49:44] rather he says where the word is silent
[49:46] she is silent as well because that's
[49:48] what we saw we talked about this in the
[49:50] last few Services under the under the
[49:52] the law of Moses they had it written but
[49:54] then the priesthood came in and they
[49:56] added to it with the oral law and they
[49:58] made up things Jesus said you're
[50:00] preaching for Doctrine the teachings of
[50:02] men it was the oral law of Moses and
[50:04] they said here's how we're going to be
[50:05] more acceptable to God here's how we're
[50:07] going to be more holy here's how we're
[50:09] going to be more Sanctified and we're
[50:10] going to do all these extra things and
[50:12] God had nothing in it God didn't accept
[50:15] it as anything God didn't accept it as
[50:16] worship they did it as unto God but they
[50:18] were adding to their own burden and it
[50:20] had no spiritual benefit to them or
[50:22] their family it just made life more
[50:24] difficult and then we talked last so
[50:27] that the Antichrist Spirit mimics the
[50:29] holy spirit because the the pattern of
[50:31] God is to take a thought and to speak it
[50:34] into a word and then that word Goes
[50:36] Forth with power to manifest what was
[50:39] spoken the thought becomes reality and
[50:41] this is what this whole series is on is
[50:44] manifesting time it's about the word
[50:46] coming into reality in our flesh and we
[50:49] know that what happens is that Satan and
[50:51] an antichrist Spirit does the same thing
[50:53] is he gets something into our thoughts
[50:56] and then from our thoughts it turns into
[50:57] a saying and then from a saying it turns
[51:00] into a Doctrine and then from a Doctrine
[51:01] it starts to live in our lives and what
[51:03] do we have we have an antichrist thought
[51:05] that produces an antichrist life because
[51:07] the source the origin becomes its
[51:10] Destiny you can't start with Antichrist
[51:12] and come out with Christ amen it has to
[51:14] be brought subject to the word amen it's
[51:16] the reality of the original is the
[51:17] Antichrist and that's what's coming out
[51:19] why because the thought was contrary to
[51:21] the word in the first place and so the
[51:23] fruit of it must be contrary to the word
[51:26] that's why denominations fail every time
[51:28] so we've got to get our thinking right
[51:30] and our thinking is set in perfect order
[51:31] by one thing and one thing alone the
[51:33] word of God that's what everything has
[51:35] to come through and when our thinking is
[51:37] right now it shapes our understanding
[51:39] and then when our understanding is right
[51:40] it shapes the way we
[51:42] talk Paul says this in 2 Corinthians he
[51:44] says for though we walk in the flesh we
[51:47] do not war after the flesh we're in this
[51:49] fleshly body we're in this earth he says
[51:51] but the battles that we Face are not in
[51:53] this flesh in other words the things
[51:55] that we deal with today the problems the
[51:57] situations the people whatever comes our
[52:00] way is not of this Earth and this flesh
[52:03] amen it's not just situations it's not
[52:06] just people it's spiritual battles he
[52:08] says for the weapons of our Warfare are
[52:10] not carnal but are Mighty through God to
[52:13] the pulling down of strongholds that
[52:15] means we don't have anything in
[52:16] ourselves that's going to win the
[52:17] battles that we're facing he says but in
[52:20] all of these things he says we are
[52:22] casting down imaginations and every High
[52:26] thing that exalteth itself against the
[52:28] knowledge of God and bringing into
[52:31] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[52:34] of Christ see we think of ideas as
[52:37] thoughts as ideas or concepts or
[52:39] inspiration and these things are true
[52:41] but we have to check our inspiration by
[52:44] the word of God and I think I mentioned
[52:47] this before I I was talking with brother
[52:49] Steven strw one time at back when in BC
[52:52] and he says brother John he says I'm
[52:53] sure as a minister you you've noticed
[52:55] this he says you'll get this inspiration
[52:57] and you'll think it's amazing and then
[52:59] you get halfway down the line and you
[53:00] realize it's
[53:04] off you see how can that be possible
[53:06] because Satan is trying to get us off
[53:08] the mark constantly and so here's the
[53:11] thing and when we spend time on the word
[53:13] when we spend time thinking about God
[53:16] then the holy spirit is there to Quicken
[53:18] our thoughts but here's the thing Satan
[53:20] is there to try and Quicken our
[53:21] intellectuality our religious nature
[53:23] whatever it is and he's trying to get us
[53:25] to go down a slightly different path
[53:27] just a little bit off and then what
[53:30] happens is we've got to check our pride
[53:32] against the word and say wow that was a
[53:34] great idea and oh it's off well what am
[53:37] I going to do with that am I going to
[53:38] Humble my inspiration to the world word
[53:42] or am I going to press through and try
[53:43] and force it through the word and that's
[53:44] where we get into trouble amen we need
[53:47] to bring every thought subject to the
[53:50] word and Paul's saying listen the
[53:52] battles we think the battles we Face we
[53:55] think it's people
[53:57] we think they've got a problem with me
[53:58] we think that that it's just the boss
[54:00] doing this we think it's just this or
[54:02] that or the other thing but Paul says no
[54:03] no no you've got to understand this is a
[54:05] spiritual warfare that you're going
[54:06] through on a day-by-day basis amen that
[54:09] what we're doing is what it's
[54:11] spiritually natured not just carnally
[54:14] natured and when we start to look at
[54:16] that that means we can have Grace for
[54:17] the person that's giving us the hard
[54:19] time because it's not them it's a spirit
[54:21] in them and they don't even realize
[54:22] what's going on there's something that's
[54:24] pushing them and many times when they're
[54:26] done they don't even know why they did
[54:27] it they can't even explain why they got
[54:29] so heated up about that little thing
[54:31] that you did or said that triggered them
[54:33] and all you're doing is living a
[54:35] Christian Life you may not do anything
[54:36] wrong and it causes something to spark
[54:38] in them and it it just causes them to
[54:40] react in a certain way and you sit there
[54:41] saying what did I ever do to you what is
[54:44] it it's a spiritual warfare amen and so
[54:47] in those things we have to bring
[54:48] everything natural subject to the spirit
[54:51] because we have these five senses in our
[54:54] flesh and we've got those five internal
[54:56] senses of of our conscience and memory
[54:58] these different things and when
[54:59] something flares up our reaction our
[55:02] right is to flare back but Paul says no
[55:05] I'm trying to elevate your thinking now
[55:07] to understand that this battle is not
[55:09] going to be won he says by our carnal
[55:13] weapons he says the weapons of our
[55:15] Warfare aren't carnal but they're Mighty
[55:17] through God the way that we fight is
[55:19] different than the way everyone else
[55:21] does but as Believers we ought to be
[55:23] able to stop and say this battle is not
[55:25] about me
[55:26] it's not about the person it's not about
[55:28] the situation I'm caught in the great
[55:30] battle between good and evil between the
[55:33] word and the Antichrist and if we can
[55:35] stop and sit back and say what's really
[55:38] going on here it'll allow us to win the
[55:41] battle I I've talked about this before
[55:43] that in the animal kingdom we are the
[55:45] only ones that can separate our reaction
[55:47] and our action when something happens we
[55:50] are the only ones that can say I'm going
[55:51] to respond differently than the action
[55:53] really ought to ought to put me into
[55:57] you know you look at I've talked about
[55:58] it when we were at the San Diego Zoo and
[56:00] that Cub came up and it it it it bit the
[56:03] Father the the big male lion on the rear
[56:06] end and he turned around he
[56:11] a separate those things Paul says we
[56:14] ought to be able to separate what
[56:15] happens and our response to it he says
[56:17] and we do it by casting down
[56:19] imaginations by every High thing that
[56:21] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[56:23] God and bringing into captivity every
[56:26] thought to The Obedience of Christ what
[56:28] was Christ's obedience the
[56:31] word I sister Betty had mentioned a
[56:34] service on the pride of life and I was
[56:35] listening to that this week and the
[56:38] brother was was preaching about Christ
[56:39] and he says he humbled himself to the
[56:42] word everything he did was humbled to
[56:46] the
[56:46] word and he made himself of no
[56:49] reputation he took his right to respond
[56:54] with authority with power
[56:57] with righteous indignation he took that
[56:59] completely out and said what does the
[57:00] word say I should do in this situation
[57:03] that's all he could do and Jesus this
[57:04] was his testimony in John 5 he says
[57:06] search the scriptures for in them you
[57:09] think you have eternal life he says and
[57:11] they are they which testify me Jesus
[57:13] said compare my life to the word and see
[57:16] if there's any Gap see if there's any
[57:18] difference he says my life is the word
[57:21] there's no difference between what the
[57:22] word says and how I live he says how can
[57:24] you judge me you think your Sal is in
[57:26] that word and your salvation is standing
[57:28] before you in flesh he was completely
[57:31] obedient to the word his thoughts were
[57:33] subject to the word and what happens
[57:35] after our thoughts are subject to the
[57:36] word is now our understanding changes
[57:38] amen we don't understand as other people
[57:40] change amen our thoughts when they're
[57:42] put together correctly they produce
[57:44] understanding and then we realize like
[57:46] Paul said we're not going to win this
[57:47] battle by ourselves
[57:50] amen all that happens when we do it our
[57:53] way is we keep the battle going that's
[57:56] all that happens it's just another day
[57:58] another day it's another cycle right and
[58:02] we're going to go around the mountain
[58:03] again and again and again until we get
[58:04] off and say let's let God have his way
[58:06] in the situation and lay down our rights
[58:08] lay down our preferences lay down our
[58:11] our Traditions whatever it might be and
[58:13] say Lord what's the spiritual battle
[58:15] here that's really going to be won
[58:17] because that's the one we're looking for
[58:18] amen Satan loves to keep Wars going and
[58:21] he does it by keeping us in our flesh
[58:22] and our thoughts and our rights and
[58:24] these different things and I believe
[58:25] that's a battle every day as we get up
[58:27] is to say Lord help me see the battle
[58:29] for what it is help me see the battle
[58:32] for what it is don't let me get caught
[58:34] up oh if we're tired out if we have a
[58:37] poor night's sleep if the babies have
[58:38] been up if we didn't get our breakfast
[58:40] or our coffee just right and what
[58:41] happens is it's so easy to slip back
[58:43] into the
[58:45] kernel but Paul says elevate your
[58:47] thinking step up a little higher and
[58:49] recognize what's going on and as soon as
[58:51] our understanding changes what's the
[58:54] understanding it helps us see the real
[58:56] the real issue and that's discernment
[58:58] for a Believer is to step back and say
[59:00] what's really going on here and what
[59:02] matters and then what we start to look
[59:03] at is Souls rather than people and we
[59:06] look at the Eternal purpose rather than
[59:07] how this feels to me right now but as
[59:10] soon as our understanding changes then
[59:12] what happens after that our speech
[59:14] changes brother Brandon would talk about
[59:16] that parrot that can repeat everything
[59:19] that's said around it he says but if you
[59:21] have him talking to a a professor from
[59:23] Princeton the parot can't have a
[59:25] conversation with them he's just
[59:27] repeating something he has no
[59:30] understanding he's just a parrot he says
[59:32] but when we get understanding we can
[59:33] talk about it our speech changes we can
[59:36] take it and apply it in our lives amen
[59:39] and now what happens is as our
[59:40] understanding changes what comes out is
[59:42] the word we speak the word and with that
[59:45] word comes Authority with that word
[59:47] comes power with that word comes love
[59:50] with that love comes Merc with that word
[59:51] comes Mercy Grace whatever is needed to
[59:54] resolve the spiritual battle is what
[59:56] comes out of our mouth instead of just
[59:58] trying to what it down and get the
[1:00:00] the physical victory over the situation
[1:00:02] or over the
[1:00:03] person amen our reactions ought to be
[1:00:07] overshadowed by one thing what's going
[1:00:09] on here and what is the word tell me to
[1:00:11] do in that
[1:00:13] situation that's hard to do so many
[1:00:15] times because Satan likes to put a time
[1:00:17] crunch on
[1:00:18] us but that's why you need to be prayed
[1:00:21] up that's why we need to be feeding on
[1:00:23] the word constantly is so that what
[1:00:25] comes
[1:00:26] more or less immediately to mind is what
[1:00:28] we've been feeding on because God never
[1:00:31] leaves us without an answer God never
[1:00:33] leaves us without the solution God
[1:00:34] doesn't leave us without the direction
[1:00:36] and so if we are prayed up if we're
[1:00:38] ready to face the battle then what
[1:00:40] happens is we walk in and God just walks
[1:00:42] right through our life and takes us
[1:00:44] right through it the way he wants to do
[1:00:45] it that's what happens amen God's
[1:00:48] purpose stands higher than our rights in
[1:00:51] those situations that's what you'll find
[1:00:53] is Lord why is it me that's in this
[1:00:56] situation because here's the thing if it
[1:00:59] was just carnal they'd be bickering with
[1:01:01] each other they'd be fighting with each
[1:01:02] other the situations would be going to
[1:01:03] other people but it happens to us
[1:01:06] because we're there to represent Christ
[1:01:08] we're there to help give the right
[1:01:09] response we're there to help show what
[1:01:11] the word would do in these
[1:01:14] situations if we take it back to our
[1:01:16] opening scripture in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:01:18] Paul says all of this is putting away
[1:01:20] our childish things our thinking our
[1:01:24] understanding and our speech they're
[1:01:25] brought into subjection as that child of
[1:01:28] God comes into their purpose as they
[1:01:30] come into adulthood as they come into
[1:01:32] maturity amen listen we we we come in
[1:01:35] and we give our lives to Christ and we
[1:01:37] say a lot of things we understand a lot
[1:01:39] of things we think a lot of things but
[1:01:41] as it as our lives grow and as our lives
[1:01:43] mature under the preaching of the word
[1:01:45] the hearing of the word the reading of
[1:01:46] the word and the the the quickening of
[1:01:48] the spirit what happens is we start to
[1:01:50] see there's way more than we thought to
[1:01:51] what's going on there's way more to me
[1:01:53] there's way more to you there's way more
[1:01:55] to what's going on around us and what
[1:01:57] happens is those old ways of thinking
[1:01:58] those old ways of understanding those
[1:02:00] old ways of talking they go by the
[1:02:01] wayside and quite often we say boy was I
[1:02:04] ever childish boy was I ever silly was I
[1:02:07] ever arrogant really that's what you'll
[1:02:10] see in ch in children is that
[1:02:12] arrogance it's always a funny thing when
[1:02:14] my youngest at four years old tries to
[1:02:15] correct
[1:02:17] me but he is so confident in his
[1:02:20] knowledge and understanding of things
[1:02:22] why cuz he's a child you'll find the
[1:02:24] further we go the more humility comes in
[1:02:26] to temper those things the way we we
[1:02:28] jump into
[1:02:30] situations what does it what changes us
[1:02:33] it's the Holy Spirit on the inside
[1:02:34] drawing us up it's the tutoring it's the
[1:02:36] maturing that comes with sitting under
[1:02:38] that tutor day in and day out and what
[1:02:40] is he doing he's helping you to see what
[1:02:42] God has for you he's helping you to see
[1:02:44] how God sees things not just the way
[1:02:46] that we see things
[1:02:48] naturally but in all of that he's
[1:02:50] helping us to see this is not happen
[1:02:53] stance where we are what we're doing
[1:02:55] where we're placed the situations we get
[1:02:57] into they aren't just happening to
[1:03:00] us right this isn't just
[1:03:02] Karma it's not just luck of the draw but
[1:03:05] for a child of God everything that comes
[1:03:08] our way is because of his purpose and we
[1:03:11] can rest in those
[1:03:13] things listen to this brother Braham
[1:03:16] says a Son of God can go a long time
[1:03:18] before he recognizes he's a son he says
[1:03:21] in fact a lot of true Christians are
[1:03:24] like the story of the baby Eagle that
[1:03:26] was hatched out under a hen he says you
[1:03:28] know that the eagle is the type of the
[1:03:30] True Believer well a farmer took an egg
[1:03:32] from an eagle's nest he placed it under
[1:03:34] a hen and in due time all the eggs under
[1:03:37] the hen hatched out the baby chicks got
[1:03:39] along fine with the mother hen but that
[1:03:42] little Eagle could not figure out the
[1:03:43] clucking and the scratching for food in
[1:03:45] the manure pile he managed catch this he
[1:03:48] managed to make a living but he was
[1:03:51] pretty confused about it
[1:03:53] all what he could stay alive but there
[1:03:56] was no satisfaction it didn't make sense
[1:03:59] to him he wasn't built to eat and hunt
[1:04:02] for food the way they were he could make
[1:04:05] it work but he wasn't
[1:04:07] flourishing he says but one day from way
[1:04:10] up in the air the mother Eagle that had
[1:04:12] laid the egg she spied the little Eagle
[1:04:15] on the ground and she swooped down with
[1:04:18] tremendous speed and screamed at the top
[1:04:20] of her voice for him to fly up to her he
[1:04:24] says he had never heard heard an eagle
[1:04:26] cry but when he heard that first scream
[1:04:30] something in him stirred and he longed
[1:04:32] to launch out toward it he had never
[1:04:36] known what it meant to fly he did not
[1:04:38] know what this thing was but something
[1:04:40] in him wanted even without understanding
[1:04:43] he says but he was afraid to try
[1:04:46] something in him is longing for it
[1:04:48] something in him is responding to the
[1:04:50] Cry of his origin but he's scared to do
[1:04:53] it because he's never done this before
[1:04:59] all the chickens around him were saying
[1:05:00] don't you go over with that group of
[1:05:02] people don't you believe that
[1:05:05] message don't you step away from this
[1:05:08] denomination don't do it look everybody
[1:05:11] else is sticking around what are you
[1:05:12] doing out there stay here stay
[1:05:16] safe that eagle kills
[1:05:21] chickens he says but again that mother
[1:05:23] screamed for him to arise in the Wind
[1:05:25] didn't follow her he screamed back that
[1:05:27] he was afraid once more she called out
[1:05:31] screaming that he
[1:05:33] tried God won't stop calling until we
[1:05:36] respond praise the Lord amen he never
[1:05:39] stops screaming to his children he never
[1:05:42] stops pulling he never stops drawing us
[1:05:45] back to him you we say I'm scared I
[1:05:48] don't know I'm
[1:05:51] unsure he says just try amen just try
[1:05:56] just
[1:05:58] try he says beating his wings he hurled
[1:06:01] himself into the air and answering the
[1:06:03] Cry of his mother he soared off into the
[1:06:06] blue skies now that looks like he took
[1:06:08] off on the first try and brother brandom
[1:06:10] as he tells his story it's a madeup
[1:06:12] story but yes he had does it on the
[1:06:13] first try but I know I've read the story
[1:06:15] of The Little Eagles and brother B would
[1:06:17] talk about they come out of the nests
[1:06:18] the first time and they just tumble to
[1:06:20] the
[1:06:21] ground but what does that mother Eagle
[1:06:23] do she swoops down and she grabs him
[1:06:25] before they hits the ground takes them
[1:06:27] up and says try again why cuz you're
[1:06:29] built for this we fail the first time we
[1:06:32] fail the second time we fail the third
[1:06:34] time doesn't matter church we got to fly
[1:06:36] because we're Eagles and as we mature as
[1:06:39] we grow what happens as we start to fly
[1:06:43] and then we start to control how we fly
[1:06:45] and then we start to control where we go
[1:06:47] and how we land and what we eat and all
[1:06:49] these different things our flight gives
[1:06:51] us the freedom that we need to be an
[1:06:54] eagle he says you see he always was an
[1:06:57] eagle he acted like a chicken for a
[1:06:59] little while but he could not be
[1:07:02] satisfied but when he heard the call of
[1:07:05] the Great Eagle he came to his own place
[1:07:07] and once a true Son of God hears the Cry
[1:07:10] of the Spirit by the word he too will
[1:07:12] realize who he is and run to the great
[1:07:15] prophet eagle and be with him forever
[1:07:18] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:07:20] Jesus I'm not here because brother
[1:07:22] Gerald I'm not here because my mom and
[1:07:25] dad dad brought me up in the message I'm
[1:07:27] here because I heard a a cry from Heaven
[1:07:30] that called my name that called my name
[1:07:33] and that's what I responded to was a
[1:07:35] Heavenly cry not a pastoral cry not a
[1:07:38] parental cry not a friend cry but it was
[1:07:40] a cry from allmighty God saying you are
[1:07:43] my beloved Son come up a little
[1:07:46] higher Paul would say it this way in
[1:07:48] Romans 8 he says for we have not
[1:07:50] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:07:53] fear fear put them of the presence of
[1:07:56] God he says the spirit we have is not
[1:07:59] again to fear it is to draw us back he
[1:08:01] says but we have received the spirit of
[1:08:04] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father what
[1:08:09] our response when we hear that cry is
[1:08:11] Daddy Daddy and all of a sudden we're
[1:08:14] drawn to that and we trust him and we
[1:08:17] believe him why because a father will
[1:08:19] never do anything for our harm it's
[1:08:21] always for our good he's always there to
[1:08:24] bring about that which is best for us
[1:08:26] that's the Father's Heart and so we
[1:08:28] respond we say Daddy and whatever daddy
[1:08:30] tells us to do we do it because we're
[1:08:32] trusting
[1:08:33] daddy amen we're looking to
[1:08:37] him I want to take all those thoughts
[1:08:39] that's my my Preamble this morning and
[1:08:42] put it into one big thought this morning
[1:08:44] because we're talking about elevating
[1:08:46] our thinking elevating our understanding
[1:08:48] stepping up into the word of God we're
[1:08:50] talking about recognizing who we are as
[1:08:52] children of God we're talking about
[1:08:54] recognizing the battles we fight and
[1:08:57] what's really going on behind the scenes
[1:08:58] that they're not natural but they're
[1:08:59] spiritual and then we're talking about
[1:09:01] stepping up into maturity but I want to
[1:09:04] read some quotes from the last Service
[1:09:05] as we kind of get into our main thought
[1:09:07] this morning we end it with these last
[1:09:09] few quotes he says the church
[1:09:11] positionally we're talking about adopted
[1:09:12] positions the church positionally before
[1:09:15] the foundation of the world these are
[1:09:18] the thoughts of God about the body of
[1:09:19] Believers he says when God in his labor
[1:09:22] pain was bringing forth bringing forth
[1:09:24] you no what you would do he positionally
[1:09:27] placed you into his own body to be a
[1:09:31] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:09:34] preacher to be a prophet to be this or
[1:09:36] to be that he placed you
[1:09:39] positionally and we can look at the
[1:09:41] things that we're doing we can look at
[1:09:43] the positions we have in life and we can
[1:09:45] say well that's just who I am or that's
[1:09:48] just what I chose or even I didn't
[1:09:50] really have a choice this is what life
[1:09:52] has put on
[1:09:53] me that's not what Paul is talking about
[1:09:57] that's childish thinking he's saying no
[1:09:59] no no brother bram's saying where you
[1:10:02] are and what God has placed you into is
[1:10:04] your adopted
[1:10:06] position and we think that all along it
[1:10:09] was us making choices no it was not it
[1:10:11] was God using us God setting up things
[1:10:15] you think about how many billions of
[1:10:17] people are in this world and I had to
[1:10:19] meet one woman what are the chances of
[1:10:21] meeting the woman that that that that
[1:10:23] fills in the two weaknesses that I
[1:10:29] have what are the chances without
[1:10:32] stepping on my
[1:10:34] strengths
[1:10:36] impossible but With God all things are
[1:10:38] possible amen we don't just get married
[1:10:42] we don't just have kids we don't just
[1:10:44] have careers we don't just go to a
[1:10:46] church we don't just move to a country
[1:10:49] we don't just come into Ministry no
[1:10:51] these things are ordained of God to
[1:10:53] bring us into the body of Christ as he
[1:10:55] ordained us before the foundation of the
[1:10:58] world where you're sitting today what
[1:11:00] you're doing today is ordained of
[1:11:03] God that's what mature thinking would
[1:11:05] understand by the word of God Amen we
[1:11:09] need to come out of our childish
[1:11:10] thinking saying this is just life this
[1:11:12] is not life This Is The Life of Christ
[1:11:15] in you in your place and in your
[1:11:17] position that he has ordained you to be
[1:11:20] in today right where you
[1:11:22] are I want to read one more similar
[1:11:24] quote before we move on just to drive
[1:11:26] this home on this thought of stepping up
[1:11:28] brother Braham says nobody can take your
[1:11:31] place no matter how little we're going
[1:11:34] to talk about this later brother Bram
[1:11:35] says God will spend a hundred years
[1:11:37] getting a man ready for 30 minutes of
[1:11:39] work and we're going to see how critical
[1:11:42] those 30 minutes can be sometimes that
[1:11:45] you can be in your position you can be
[1:11:47] faithful as a wife faithful as a
[1:11:49] machinist faithful as an accountant
[1:11:51] faithful as a preacher and all of your
[1:11:53] time and effort and faithfulness is down
[1:11:57] to one moment in your life where you
[1:11:59] will do an act in the stead of Christ
[1:12:02] perfectly for the sake of another
[1:12:04] soul and all of what you've done through
[1:12:07] that time you've been in an adopted
[1:12:09] position but you just had one work to do
[1:12:12] and all that
[1:12:14] faithfulness all that believing all that
[1:12:16] trusting was to get you to that one
[1:12:18] place so he could manifest through you
[1:12:19] and bring another soul to
[1:12:22] Christ that's how powerful
[1:12:25] his thinking is when we can latch on to
[1:12:27] it then when when it seems there's no
[1:12:29] purpose nothing's happening why am I
[1:12:32] here what am I doing sometimes he's just
[1:12:34] got us there for that little moment and
[1:12:37] that's all he needed from us but nobody
[1:12:39] else can have that little moment just
[1:12:42] you no matter how little it is he says
[1:12:45] you say I'm just a housewife nobody can
[1:12:48] take your place God in his great economy
[1:12:52] has so set so the body of Christ in
[1:12:54] order till there is no one can take your
[1:12:56] place he said how I would like to take
[1:12:58] Billy Gram's place any of us ministers
[1:13:00] but we can't do it but just remember
[1:13:02] Billy can't take our place see we all
[1:13:05] have a place some of us are evangelists
[1:13:07] some prophets some teachers some pastors
[1:13:10] whatever we are some Housewives some
[1:13:12] mechanics some Farmers Whatever It Is
[1:13:15] God has set you in your place and nobody
[1:13:19] else can take
[1:13:20] it Church he's preaching this after the
[1:13:23] opening of the seals If That Matters to
[1:13:24] anybody here
[1:13:26] the word is open and he hasn't changed
[1:13:29] his thought on this he preached adoption
[1:13:31] before the seals were open he preaches
[1:13:33] this three kinds of Believers after the
[1:13:34] seals are open and he never changes this
[1:13:36] thought he places us where he places
[1:13:39] us and that's your adopted
[1:13:42] position see we want to look at adoption
[1:13:44] as it's all signs and
[1:13:46] wonders brother Mark was sharing
[1:13:48] something a minister said recently he
[1:13:50] says and we Overlook the power of the
[1:13:52] Holy Ghost that gives us an overcoming
[1:13:53] life when nobody else can
[1:13:57] but he wants us to have the overcoming
[1:13:58] life before he wants us to have the
[1:14:00] signs and wonders
[1:14:02] Amen brother Braham says God has set you
[1:14:05] in your place we think we chose we think
[1:14:08] we decided we think we moved we think we
[1:14:10] planned and no no no God has placed you
[1:14:14] in your
[1:14:17] place we're here by his determination
[1:14:20] not by
[1:14:21] ours I'm not saying we don't get out of
[1:14:23] his will at times amen I've been there
[1:14:26] done that I was talking to a a brother a
[1:14:28] while ago and he he lived in a certain
[1:14:30] place that that I've been and and uh I
[1:14:33] asked him what he was doing there and he
[1:14:34] says I was I was living out of the will
[1:14:36] of
[1:14:38] God yeah and here's the thing in that
[1:14:41] place he was in his ordained position
[1:14:44] but he was not in his ordained place he
[1:14:46] was doing the work that God had called
[1:14:48] him to but he wasn't where God had
[1:14:49] called him to do
[1:14:50] it and so he said I had nine months of
[1:14:53] being out of the will of God before I
[1:14:55] finally got out of that situation he
[1:14:56] said and nothing good came out of it
[1:14:58] nothing good came out of it why because
[1:15:00] he had gotten out of God's Will and he
[1:15:02] had to pull back and go back to where he
[1:15:03] left God and get back in his will and
[1:15:05] find what God wanted him to do Amen
[1:15:09] brother Bram says here you can be an
[1:15:11] adopted son of God and your adopted
[1:15:13] position is a
[1:15:17] mechanic so
[1:15:19] spiritual see how simple it is
[1:15:23] church brother B how often would he say
[1:15:25] he would he would quote Jesus saying and
[1:15:27] he says father I'm so glad you've hid it
[1:15:31] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[1:15:33] it unto babes it's the Simplicity of the
[1:15:36] re revealing of God in little people
[1:15:40] that's all it is and because it's just a
[1:15:42] little one here and a little one there
[1:15:44] and it seems so simple we go right over
[1:15:46] it we've got to make sure we don't go
[1:15:48] over it church that's my point let's not
[1:15:50] lose sight of the of our position to
[1:15:53] recognize where we are and what we're
[1:15:54] doing
[1:15:56] see it's our human nature to
[1:15:58] minimize these things and then our
[1:16:01] religious nature comes up and tries to
[1:16:02] over spiritualize all the things that
[1:16:04] God's just like yeah
[1:16:05] whatever literally where you are and
[1:16:07] what you're doing that's what God is
[1:16:08] caring about and he's placed you there
[1:16:10] for a reason and we say well that's just
[1:16:12] my vocation well I'm a mom because that
[1:16:16] that's what we do when you get married
[1:16:17] and you love a man you have his kids and
[1:16:19] you stay at home
[1:16:21] no no that's where God has placed you
[1:16:25] and we'll see in the next service that
[1:16:27] God can hold back kids and God can give
[1:16:30] kids for reasons and so we don't just
[1:16:32] have them each and every one is ordained
[1:16:34] of God for purpose and each and
[1:16:36] everything we do is ordained of
[1:16:40] purpose you can be a mechanic and an
[1:16:43] adopted son of God in your position as a
[1:16:45] mechanic that is your position as
[1:16:48] mechanic it's not to come and sit in the
[1:16:50] Pew that's our reasonable service but
[1:16:53] your position can be as a mechanic and
[1:16:56] if God has placed you there then God
[1:16:58] will back you up God will bless you God
[1:17:00] will meet your needs God will make you a
[1:17:01] witness God will make you a
[1:17:03] servant and you'll be a Godly mechanic
[1:17:05] not just a mechanic you'll be a Son of
[1:17:08] God mechanic not just a mechanic and
[1:17:09] people will see the difference between
[1:17:11] what you are and what they are amen I
[1:17:15] said this before and I don't do it to
[1:17:16] raise myself up but I say we are witness
[1:17:18] and a testimony and people are looking
[1:17:21] whether we realize it or not back when I
[1:17:23] was in Texas Texas is Bible Belt
[1:17:25] everybody there is a professing
[1:17:26] Christian and me and another young
[1:17:28] engineer were were at this company and
[1:17:30] he left after a couple year or he left
[1:17:31] after a year just before I did and
[1:17:33] before he left he said I thought I was a
[1:17:35] Christian until I met
[1:17:37] you why he saw a difference in how he
[1:17:39] lived and how I lived not just in how we
[1:17:42] spoke but how we lived and he said I
[1:17:44] appreciate you letting me see there's
[1:17:46] more to this Christian walk than what I
[1:17:47] had something along those lines and
[1:17:49] we're still friends to this
[1:17:51] day why I don't believe that was my
[1:17:55] adopted position but I believe
[1:17:57] everywhere we go everywhere we go we are
[1:18:01] a servant and we are a witness of Christ
[1:18:04] amen but I believe like I said that we
[1:18:08] can be in our adoptive positions a long
[1:18:09] time and not realize this is my work
[1:18:13] this is my work because what is the
[1:18:15] Revelation that the church needs to have
[1:18:16] to go into Rapture her position in
[1:18:19] Christ and if we're sitting here and
[1:18:21] we're thinking that we're just walking
[1:18:22] through life waiting for something to
[1:18:24] happen at the end we've missed it we're
[1:18:28] in it all along brother brandham says we
[1:18:30] can always look back with perfect
[1:18:32] clarity and we're always looking to what
[1:18:34] God's going to do but can we see what
[1:18:35] he's doing right now that's what the
[1:18:37] Holy Spirit does to the believer is it
[1:18:39] shows them what's going on when it's
[1:18:41] happening because he's trying to reveal
[1:18:43] his Secrets he's trying to he's trying
[1:18:45] to reveal his will to his family so
[1:18:48] we're not walking through this with our
[1:18:49] eyes darkened but our eyes of
[1:18:51] understanding now are
[1:18:53] opened so that we can see what he's
[1:18:55] trying to do in our
[1:18:57] lives I read that's why I read this
[1:18:59] quote earlier where he says that a Son
[1:19:01] of God can go along time before he
[1:19:03] realize he's his son I believe and this
[1:19:05] is just me I believe you can be in your
[1:19:07] adopted position and not even realize
[1:19:11] it I think you can be in a position a
[1:19:13] long time before you realize I've got
[1:19:16] Authority I've got power I can have
[1:19:19] expectation in the Holy Spirit for God
[1:19:22] to move on my behalf when I'm in this
[1:19:24] role
[1:19:26] Amen brother Braham said it this way he
[1:19:28] says the new birth is
[1:19:30] Christ it's a revelation God has
[1:19:33] revealed to you this great mystery and
[1:19:34] that's a new birth now what are you
[1:19:36] going to do when you get all that group
[1:19:38] together all the ones that have had a
[1:19:39] new birth he says where the Revelation
[1:19:42] is perfectly in Harmony and God
[1:19:44] expressing it through his word by the
[1:19:46] same actions the same things that he did
[1:19:48] making the word manifest he said oh if
[1:19:51] the church only knew its position the
[1:19:54] cry his heart this is Christ The Mystery
[1:19:56] of God revealed he says if we only knew
[1:19:58] our
[1:19:59] position if we only
[1:20:02] understood our
[1:20:04] position he says it will one day then
[1:20:07] the Rapture will go when it knows what
[1:20:10] it is brother brah said some of us our
[1:20:12] adopted position is in the five-fold
[1:20:14] ministry but we're not all in that as we
[1:20:16] read the scriptures that Paul said our
[1:20:18] all teachers or all Apostles or all
[1:20:20] evangelists do all have gifts of healing
[1:20:22] do all have gifts of Miracles do all
[1:20:23] have gifts of tongues
[1:20:25] he said no he said when we come together
[1:20:27] does everyone have a Psalm does everyone
[1:20:28] have a a tongue does everyone have a no
[1:20:30] he says no that's not the way it
[1:20:32] works brother saying each of us has a
[1:20:35] portion and you got to realize what your
[1:20:37] portion is and get focused on being
[1:20:39] Christ in that portion
[1:20:42] amen what is it we need to come in a
[1:20:45] Harmony of
[1:20:46] revelation of my place in Christ and
[1:20:49] your place in Christ cuz the Harmony and
[1:20:52] Revelation was and I is when I
[1:20:54] recognized my place in Christ and I
[1:20:56] recognize your place in
[1:20:58] Christ because I've got to know where
[1:21:00] you fit to make sure I don't get in your
[1:21:02] way and you got to know where I fit so
[1:21:04] you don't get in my way and we can work
[1:21:06] now hand in hand because we're under the
[1:21:08] same anointing amen and if we're under
[1:21:10] the same anointing then what does it do
[1:21:12] it compliments rather than brings
[1:21:15] chaos because otherwise what happens is
[1:21:17] we start trying to defend our
[1:21:19] turf you know I I I was talking about
[1:21:21] how I teased brother Paul when I came
[1:21:23] here and I said now that you know we've
[1:21:24] a you know a a real Minister
[1:21:28] here I'm going to take over Sunday
[1:21:30] school but you know what he never did he
[1:21:33] never pushed back he said if you want it
[1:21:36] take
[1:21:37] it he didn't defend his Turf and I felt
[1:21:41] so bad as I said after I did it because
[1:21:43] he he responded so perfectly is
[1:21:48] annoying why because it's God's will not
[1:21:52] his will amen
[1:21:55] but I would never do that because that's
[1:21:57] not my place I've been there I've done
[1:21:59] that and that was a stepping stone for
[1:22:00] me to come into Ministry but I've moved
[1:22:03] beyond that now and I can step back into
[1:22:05] it if God wants me to step back into it
[1:22:07] but God had already prepared a vessel
[1:22:08] for that and so in me recognizing where
[1:22:11] he fits I won't try and force my way in
[1:22:13] there just
[1:22:14] because well I'm a minister I know more
[1:22:17] I've got a different no no no let's let
[1:22:19] God place the
[1:22:22] gifts cuz why it's God revealed
[1:22:24] revealing himself in you and God
[1:22:26] revealing himself in me and it doesn't
[1:22:28] always look the same it's not supposed
[1:22:30] to be the same because each one of us
[1:22:31] has a lick of fire each one of us has a
[1:22:33] portion of the attribute of Christ and
[1:22:36] so you've got your place to be and I've
[1:22:37] got my place to be we're all different
[1:22:39] we have different places to serve
[1:22:40] different times to serve but we're all
[1:22:42] in one body working in harmony that's
[1:22:44] the unity of the revelation of Harmony
[1:22:47] is each in their
[1:22:48] place Paul says this in 1 Corinthians
[1:22:51] 2:12 he says now we have received not
[1:22:53] the spirit of the the world but the
[1:22:55] spirit which is of god that we might
[1:22:57] know the things that are freely given to
[1:22:59] us of God what is another word for
[1:23:00] something freely given gifts he says we
[1:23:04] have received the spirit of God that we
[1:23:06] might know the gifts that are given to
[1:23:08] us of God it's not just blessings but
[1:23:11] it's people the greatest gift is a
[1:23:13] person filled with the spirit in their
[1:23:15] place that's what a real gift is is the
[1:23:18] person in their place led by the spirit
[1:23:20] that's the real gift because now it's
[1:23:22] the spirit using them it's not them
[1:23:23] using the spirit it's not them using the
[1:23:25] gift because without the Holy Spirit we
[1:23:27] just start tripping up over each other
[1:23:29] and it Le it leads to battles it leads
[1:23:31] to Kingdom building it leads to
[1:23:33] denominational carnal messes and like I
[1:23:36] said Turf Wars no this is my church this
[1:23:39] is my place this is my Ministry this
[1:23:41] that and the other
[1:23:42] thing not working
[1:23:46] together AB Braham says this in respects
[1:23:48] he says now God's begin to pour out the
[1:23:50] gifts upon us we see it he says now what
[1:23:54] is the gift of God
[1:23:56] today he says it's the holy spirit it's
[1:24:00] the Holy Ghost that's in us we've got to
[1:24:02] respect
[1:24:04] that he says we've got to respect it on
[1:24:07] every person it comes upon we've got to
[1:24:09] receive God's Divine gifts see what he's
[1:24:12] seeing there the Holy Spirit coming upon
[1:24:13] somebody the Holy Spirit coming in
[1:24:15] somebody is gifts and then the gifts of
[1:24:18] the giver come down potentially but the
[1:24:21] gift is the Holy Ghost he says when he
[1:24:24] sends those gifts no matter how real
[1:24:26] they are it'll never help us until we
[1:24:28] get to a place till we can respect
[1:24:31] it he said somebody can give a prophecy
[1:24:34] if you don't believe in that prophecy
[1:24:36] it'll never do you any good you've got
[1:24:38] to have reverence and you've got to
[1:24:39] respect it you've got to believe that it
[1:24:42] comes from God now catch what he says
[1:24:45] here believe it until it's proved
[1:24:48] wrong remember we read in 1 Corinthians
[1:24:50] 13 last time it said charity believes
[1:24:53] all things
[1:24:54] he says believe it until it's proved
[1:24:56] wrong if it's contrary to the word up
[1:24:58] front you know you don't have to believe
[1:25:00] it but if there's nothing to say it's
[1:25:02] wrong he says believe it until it's
[1:25:03] proved wrong then when it's proved wrong
[1:25:05] then you have a right to disbelieve it
[1:25:07] but and don't associate it with it no
[1:25:08] more but as long as it's being proven
[1:25:10] out to be the truth he says then believe
[1:25:12] it stick with it let that person be what
[1:25:15] they are but catch this he says now we
[1:25:18] need a place of yielding to the spirit
[1:25:21] instead of so much depending upon
[1:25:22] schooling and Upon Our programs and our
[1:25:24] campaigns and all that we have he says
[1:25:26] so we got to get away from that that
[1:25:28] human
[1:25:29] ability see that's the easy thing to say
[1:25:32] is well you know brother so and so he
[1:25:34] has human ability and therefore he's in
[1:25:36] that position no that's the gift of God
[1:25:39] to the body of
[1:25:40] Christ remember when Moses was building
[1:25:43] the Tabernacle God said I've come upon
[1:25:45] so and so and I've given him all
[1:25:47] knowledge to work in certain things and
[1:25:50] we'll see that as we go through that we
[1:25:52] have people in this church we have
[1:25:53] people around the Body of Christ and
[1:25:55] they make a living off of the gift of
[1:25:57] God but that gift of God is being used
[1:26:00] within the body of Christ and for the
[1:26:03] benefit of the body of Christ then we
[1:26:05] see it with brother Mark early on he's
[1:26:07] an IT professional computer science
[1:26:08] degree and he and brother Gerald he
[1:26:11] comes with the vision and says let's put
[1:26:13] the message online nobody else had done
[1:26:16] it brother Mark made a good living all
[1:26:19] of his life off of his IT background but
[1:26:22] now God steps in and he says let's start
[1:26:24] using that in a body work not just a
[1:26:27] family work not just a personal work
[1:26:29] let's do it in a bodyw work and so what
[1:26:30] does he do he catches a vision he sees
[1:26:33] the opportunity goes and talks to the
[1:26:35] pastor and pretty soon we've got the
[1:26:36] message going all around the world
[1:26:37] millions of
[1:26:39] times
[1:26:41] right what do they do they started a
[1:26:43] printing operation
[1:26:45] here and now look where brother Barry
[1:26:47] coffee is
[1:26:48] today Millions upon millions of books
[1:26:52] distributions planning all of of these
[1:26:56] things brother Joe coffee using his
[1:26:58] marketing he makes a living by it but
[1:27:00] now he's working and he has worked many
[1:27:02] times in fact his his career started
[1:27:05] with doing work for the body of Christ
[1:27:07] and now God says I'll let you make a
[1:27:08] living by it and what does he do he
[1:27:09] keeps giving back to the body of Christ
[1:27:11] with it his adopted position if we could
[1:27:14] put it that way is to help in that place
[1:27:17] with the body of
[1:27:19] Christ and we say that's not spiritual
[1:27:21] that's carnal no that's the blessing of
[1:27:23] God to put somebody in the body that can
[1:27:25] produce something that's of benefit to
[1:27:28] the body that edifies the body
[1:27:33] amen we need a place of yielding to the
[1:27:35] spirit he says we've got to get away
[1:27:37] from that that human ability subject our
[1:27:40] gifts to the Holy Spirit he says we've
[1:27:42] got to get to a place where we can
[1:27:43] surrender our souls and lives catch this
[1:27:46] now Church even to the
[1:27:49] housewife to the farmer to the mechanic
[1:27:52] or whoever we are we got to Sur
[1:27:54] surrender completely to God and know
[1:27:55] that we are nothing he says then let God
[1:27:59] start from there then he starts moving
[1:28:02] and working he says and that includes
[1:28:04] all of us everyone that's the thing we
[1:28:06] got to do he says history proves that
[1:28:09] God always chooses the nobodies to
[1:28:11] become his somebodies God takes the
[1:28:14] person that's nothing so we see our
[1:28:17] adopted positions are not always
[1:28:19] obviously
[1:28:21] spiritual they are spiritual by the
[1:28:23] indwelling of of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:28:26] what makes it an adopted position is he
[1:28:28] gives us the spirit and then he takes us
[1:28:29] out and he sets us in a place it's not
[1:28:31] always about ministering the word it's
[1:28:33] not always about speaking it's not
[1:28:35] always about laying on of hands it's not
[1:28:37] always about gifts and tongues and these
[1:28:38] different things but they are
[1:28:40] nonetheless the ordained position for
[1:28:42] that person in the body of
[1:28:45] Christ
[1:28:46] Amen brother says this he says hold
[1:28:49] yourself Clean and Clear to your calling
[1:28:54] he says stay with God's word and don't
[1:28:57] move for nothing and stay abide in your
[1:29:00] calling if he gives you a job out there
[1:29:04] well I chose it I went to school I
[1:29:07] studied I moved to Texas I moved here I
[1:29:10] did this I did that he says if God gives
[1:29:13] you why because sons of God are led by
[1:29:15] the spirit of God if God provides for
[1:29:18] you then he has a reason to provide for
[1:29:20] you in that place and position if he
[1:29:22] gives you a job out there as a farmer
[1:29:24] Farm good if God bless he says God bless
[1:29:28] you at it and pay your tithe and
[1:29:29] whatever it is your offerings to help
[1:29:31] the ministry go on see he's saying
[1:29:33] there's two sides to this you've got to
[1:29:35] farm as a Son of God but you've also got
[1:29:37] to support the
[1:29:39] word he says if he made a mechanic out
[1:29:42] of you if he made a mechanic out of
[1:29:48] you there's a Dilbert
[1:29:52] comic where his what his mom takes him
[1:29:55] to the to the doctor's office she says
[1:29:58] there's something wrong with my
[1:30:01] boy and he's talking to her and he runs
[1:30:03] all these tests and in the meantime
[1:30:05] Dilbert's back in the background and
[1:30:07] he's working on a on a on a piece of
[1:30:09] equipment there and and the mother says
[1:30:11] is it okay if he does that and he says
[1:30:13] oh don't worry about that it hasn't
[1:30:14] worked in
[1:30:15] years and a couple slides later Dilbert
[1:30:18] just turns a switch and it hums to
[1:30:20] life and the doctor says I know what's
[1:30:23] wrong with him
[1:30:24] he has The
[1:30:28] Knack she said oh doctor will he live a
[1:30:32] normal life he said no he'll be an
[1:30:38] engineer
[1:30:40] right see we look at it that's just the
[1:30:42] way they turned out he says he made a
[1:30:47] mechanic out of you God made you what
[1:30:51] you are he made you the way you are with
[1:30:53] the strengths with the abilities and
[1:30:55] these things and it's for his glory it's
[1:30:57] for his glory see and we want it to be
[1:30:59] some great spiritual thing and all that
[1:31:02] he's wanting us to do is let the Holy
[1:31:04] Spirit flow through Us in whatever he
[1:31:05] sets our hands to do that's it so simple
[1:31:10] and if we can be faithful in that he may
[1:31:13] give us
[1:31:14] more and he may not that's up to him if
[1:31:18] he made a mechanic out of you and
[1:31:20] blessed you in that work stay with it
[1:31:22] and thank him for it see you just abide
[1:31:25] where God calls you why because he needs
[1:31:27] someone to show his love his mercy God
[1:31:29] needs somebody to show how He blesses a
[1:31:33] person God needs someone to show how a
[1:31:35] son or daughter of God handles trials
[1:31:37] and
[1:31:38] tribulations God needs somebody that can
[1:31:41] in every situation do the right
[1:31:44] thing and not get all fussy and not get
[1:31:47] all tired and not get all
[1:31:49] Snappy to not get all worked up in
[1:31:51] ourselves amen because we're not coming
[1:31:54] into adoption to express ourselves we're
[1:31:56] coming into adoption to express the
[1:31:57] father that's the purpose of adoption is
[1:31:59] to what place the son in the father's
[1:32:01] purpose and so in all of this our our
[1:32:04] our thinking has to elevate to recognize
[1:32:06] that we are where we are to witness
[1:32:08] Christ above all things above all things
[1:32:12] you know at work they were there was
[1:32:14] this big push and this year we were
[1:32:15] supposed to transition to a a new Crown
[1:32:18] Corporation and oh people were up in
[1:32:21] arms oh it's going to be worse and
[1:32:23] they're going to do this and they're
[1:32:24] going to do that and we're going to lose
[1:32:26] this and we're going to lose that and
[1:32:27] we're just going to become of this and
[1:32:28] we're just going to become of that and
[1:32:30] it was just down down
[1:32:32] down you know why I'm there to say why
[1:32:36] don't we wait and
[1:32:38] see why borrow tomorrow's troubles today
[1:32:42] why because they're overcome by a spirit
[1:32:43] of fear a spirit of worry and I'm saying
[1:32:46] hey I can see some really good things
[1:32:48] that could come out of this this and
[1:32:49] this and this and this I'm there to what
[1:32:52] be a Godly Ita
[1:32:54] not just an ITA but to be a Son of God
[1:32:57] ITA so that they can see there's a
[1:32:58] different way to live this life there's
[1:33:00] a different way to be in this position
[1:33:01] and it's one that can be done without
[1:33:03] fear and worry and you can have full
[1:33:05] honor and integrity in these
[1:33:07] things many times adoption means see we
[1:33:11] think adoption means I'm going to go
[1:33:13] do sometimes what we have to do is we
[1:33:15] have to stay and
[1:33:16] do that's all we're look that's all
[1:33:18] we're doing God has literally brought us
[1:33:20] to a place and we're looking to leave it
[1:33:22] and he says how about you just do my
[1:33:23] will where you are I built you I placed
[1:33:26] you I brought
[1:33:28] you and now you're trying to leave and
[1:33:30] go do something for me I've put all this
[1:33:31] effort into you why so you could stay
[1:33:34] right where you are right where you are
[1:33:36] catch a revelation that I'm trying to
[1:33:38] use you in this and then see what God
[1:33:40] will do in our
[1:33:42] lives what is it our thinking our
[1:33:44] revelation of where we are and what
[1:33:45] we're doing has to step up to say God's
[1:33:47] in it this ain't just
[1:33:49] me listen to how he talks about that son
[1:33:52] that was ready for adoption he says and
[1:33:54] being see the boy being a son already
[1:33:57] but yet if he wasn't a worthy son the
[1:33:59] father could not adopt him or place him
[1:34:01] in his own family he says he couldn't do
[1:34:03] it because the boy would run through
[1:34:05] what he had he was a Restless child he
[1:34:07] didn't have the ability to carry on with
[1:34:08] his father's work so the father just let
[1:34:10] him go on as a son he was already his
[1:34:13] son but if he was a fine boy if he was
[1:34:15] about his father's business and the
[1:34:17] tutor brought word to the father saying
[1:34:19] that the son is fine then he's eligible
[1:34:21] he's all right he says then the the
[1:34:23] father took the son out into a public
[1:34:25] place as a public testimony he put a
[1:34:28] special robe on him and set him up
[1:34:30] before the people and the father by
[1:34:32] doing this gave the son the authority
[1:34:34] over his kingdom over his business and
[1:34:36] so forth the son had the right to go out
[1:34:38] and do certain things in the king
[1:34:40] Kingdom with the same kind of authority
[1:34:43] that his father had he said he always
[1:34:45] was a son he always was in the father's
[1:34:48] business before he comes into adoption
[1:34:50] now all the father does is he he
[1:34:52] formally places him in Authority in that
[1:34:54] position he was doing the father's
[1:34:56] business all along but that son now
[1:34:59] comes to a place and he comes to a
[1:35:00] process and he comes to a ceremony and
[1:35:03] he realizes and everyone else does too
[1:35:05] I'm in this because my father wants me
[1:35:07] to do it he's built me to stand in this
[1:35:09] place he's built me to do this work and
[1:35:12] with that now comes authority to do what
[1:35:16] the
[1:35:17] work only the work not to run around
[1:35:21] because he said see what he said in the
[1:35:23] the previous one he says he would run
[1:35:24] through what the father had what he he
[1:35:27] wouldn't have the character and so he
[1:35:28] would undo all of the hard work that had
[1:35:30] already been done he'd burn through the
[1:35:32] money he'd run the company into the
[1:35:33] ground research on family-owned
[1:35:35] businesses show that usually by the
[1:35:37] third generation they're
[1:35:38] dead because the first generation built
[1:35:41] it the second one still has a a certain
[1:35:43] level of that work ethic and and
[1:35:45] appreciation for what's been done and
[1:35:46] the third generation just gets it for
[1:35:48] free and it's not passed on they don't
[1:35:50] see the sacrifice and so they tend to
[1:35:52] kill the goose that lays the golden
[1:35:54] egg
[1:35:56] right what does the son have to
[1:35:58] recognize I'm about the father's work
[1:36:00] not about mine that's it as soon as he
[1:36:04] recognizes this is what daddy wants me
[1:36:06] to do and he stays there in that role
[1:36:09] the father says now you're ready for the
[1:36:10] role you stay faithful to where you've
[1:36:13] been
[1:36:15] taught sometimes we're sitting here and
[1:36:17] our position isn't changing why because
[1:36:19] our thinking has to change and with the
[1:36:21] thinking comes the understanding of the
[1:36:22] situation with that the speech changes
[1:36:24] the life changes the way we go through
[1:36:26] our day-to-day changes and we start to
[1:36:28] say there's more to this than I thought
[1:36:30] there's more going on in my life there's
[1:36:32] more going on in these situations than I
[1:36:34] realize and God now can come in and he
[1:36:36] can start to show you what's really
[1:36:37] happening and he can start to use you
[1:36:39] because you realized he was in it all
[1:36:41] along you had to recognize your place
[1:36:44] and what he was doing in those things
[1:36:46] what is it we're stepping up into his
[1:36:48] Revelation not just being Earthbound in
[1:36:50] our own thinking brother says I believe
[1:36:53] we've been children long
[1:36:55] enough God's going to turn his church
[1:36:57] into manhood now he says and we played
[1:37:00] and frolicked as children but now we're
[1:37:02] going to have to put away childish
[1:37:03] things and take on manhood what is it
[1:37:06] it's maturity he says I believe it was
[1:37:08] Paul who said when I was a child I spake
[1:37:10] as a child because he thought as a child
[1:37:13] he says but it's time that we begin to
[1:37:15] think like men and women now for we've
[1:37:17] got to get down to business what is it
[1:37:21] what does it mean it means that you're
[1:37:22] not just a machinist now but you
[1:37:24] recognize I'm God's machinist I'm not
[1:37:26] just a housewife but I'm God's housewife
[1:37:28] I'm not just an engineer but I'm God's
[1:37:30] engineer I'm not just a preacher but now
[1:37:32] I'm God's preacher I've had gifts I've
[1:37:35] had callings I've had skills I've had
[1:37:37] abilities that's always been there but
[1:37:40] now we're starting to realize that it's
[1:37:42] his and what we're doing is all
[1:37:44] according to his will
[1:37:46] amen he says that's the thing that the
[1:37:48] church is if she only knew it being part
[1:37:51] of him with his spirit in her when God
[1:37:54] gave us the Holy Spirit it was him
[1:37:55] confirming we've got a place in a
[1:37:58] position not just here but in
[1:38:01] eternity he said the works that I do
[1:38:03] shall you do also greater than this
[1:38:05] shall you do for I go to my father a
[1:38:07] little while the world seeth me no more
[1:38:09] yet you shall see me and I'll be with
[1:38:12] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:38:14] he says then it's Christ in you when you
[1:38:17] recognize your position when you
[1:38:19] recognize it's of his work and then he
[1:38:21] says it's Christ in you that's the shift
[1:38:24] he says you're connected together and
[1:38:26] you're heirs with him and if he was here
[1:38:28] on Earth what would he be doing the same
[1:38:30] thing he did there because he's the same
[1:38:32] yesterday today and forever one he'd be
[1:38:35] mindful about the father's
[1:38:38] business he says he'd be Healing The
[1:38:41] Sick he'd be performing Miracles he'd be
[1:38:44] doing just exactly what he did when he
[1:38:46] was here on Earth because he remains the
[1:38:48] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:38:50] just
[1:38:52] perfect you can see see that with
[1:38:53] someone like Peter Peter was a preacher
[1:38:56] all
[1:38:57] along before the day of Pentecost Peter
[1:38:59] was a preacher but he was not an
[1:39:01] inspired preacher he was a parrot he
[1:39:05] didn't have the experience he needed of
[1:39:06] the infilling of the Holy Spirit he
[1:39:08] didn't have the new birth and so he
[1:39:10] could change people's physical
[1:39:12] beings but he couldn't change the
[1:39:15] heart he couldn't save them and I know
[1:39:18] that Peter can't save him but you
[1:39:20] understand what I mean his ministry
[1:39:21] could only do the signs and wonders but
[1:39:23] it couldn't change Hearts that's not
[1:39:25] what he was out there doing he was
[1:39:27] demonstrating the power but he wasn't
[1:39:28] demonstrating the power of a changed
[1:39:30] life and he couldn't bring that to
[1:39:32] anybody else but as soon as he is there
[1:39:34] on the day of Pentecost and he's filled
[1:39:36] with the spirit now he's
[1:39:38] charged he's anointed he's been given
[1:39:41] his commission he needs the anointing
[1:39:43] and as soon as he gets that anointing he
[1:39:44] comes down and 3,000 souls are saved
[1:39:47] we've read that quote where brother Bram
[1:39:48] says he came down an inspired teacher
[1:39:51] inspired he was a teacher before he was
[1:39:53] a preacher before now he's inspired why
[1:39:56] he's unlocking he's got the keys to the
[1:39:58] kingdom he was always in the
[1:40:01] role but he needed the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:04] place him exactly where he needed to be
[1:40:07] brother BR says this he's speaking of
[1:40:08] Christ he says now we see reflected in
[1:40:10] him a perfect Masterpiece he was so
[1:40:13] perfect like God until he said if I do
[1:40:15] not the works of my father don't believe
[1:40:16] me you can't believe me believe the
[1:40:18] works for they testify to you who I am
[1:40:21] he says I like that see they said you're
[1:40:22] a man and making yourself equal to God
[1:40:25] he said if you can't believe me believe
[1:40:27] the works that I do and if I don't do
[1:40:29] the works of him that sent me then you
[1:40:30] don't have no right to believe me he
[1:40:32] says look at my life and see if that
[1:40:35] reflects my
[1:40:36] claim he says so ought every Christian
[1:40:39] today to have that same
[1:40:44] testimony that's a
[1:40:46] mouthful he says if in this promised
[1:40:49] word of God if our lives don't qualify
[1:40:52] and meet EXA actly what the word said
[1:40:54] then we have no right to call oursel
[1:40:56] Christians if we're not born again Jesus
[1:40:59] said in Mark 16 these signs shall follow
[1:41:01] them that believe see not they may they
[1:41:05] ought to or they probably will they
[1:41:07] shall do it he says that's the sculptor
[1:41:09] that made us that's the church that's
[1:41:11] hewed out that's the body of
[1:41:14] Christ he says now we find it reflected
[1:41:16] in him
[1:41:18] perfectly the sculptor now had the word
[1:41:20] reflected in the Masterpiece again
[1:41:22] called his son
[1:41:23] God Emanuel he says just think that a
[1:41:26] person so yielded until God identified
[1:41:29] himself in there in that body and him
[1:41:32] and God became one we talked about
[1:41:35] yielding I and my father are one my
[1:41:39] father dwelleth in me I do that always
[1:41:42] which pleases the father he says what if
[1:41:44] the Christian could have a testimony
[1:41:46] like that he says you would be a
[1:41:48] masterpiece right here on the
[1:41:51] street Church let's not leave it up here
[1:41:54] with
[1:41:55] Christ he says if you're a wash woman
[1:41:59] out there behind that washtub you still
[1:42:01] be a masterpiece to God he says when you
[1:42:04] can say I do that always which pleases
[1:42:07] God he says and the whole world can see
[1:42:10] the work of Jesus Christ reflecting in
[1:42:13] you we're speaking on stepping up this
[1:42:15] morning when I was studying this it
[1:42:17] brought me in remembrance
[1:42:19] of the the prophet John in the Book of
[1:42:22] Revelation
[1:42:24] and in the first three chapters the
[1:42:25] scripture says John was in the
[1:42:28] spirit on the Lord's
[1:42:31] day and that Spirit came to him and it
[1:42:33] talked to him and it was at a certain
[1:42:35] level you notice that John was in the
[1:42:37] spirit but it was in the spirit on an
[1:42:39] Earthly
[1:42:40] level and what did he see under that
[1:42:42] Revelation it showed him the seven
[1:42:44] Church ages it showed him the future of
[1:42:46] the Gentile Church it showed him the
[1:42:47] effect of Satan it showed him the reward
[1:42:49] for the Overcomers and we're glad he
[1:42:51] showed us those things we're glad that
[1:42:52] we got to see the seven Church ages but
[1:42:55] you'll notice that after that in
[1:42:56] Revelations 4 Christ says come up hither
[1:43:00] come up higher come up here and he took
[1:43:03] them out of the earthlies and he brought
[1:43:04] them into the heavenlies and what did he
[1:43:07] see up there church because John to this
[1:43:10] Point's an Earthly
[1:43:12] Prophet why everything is focused on
[1:43:15] what the flesh
[1:43:18] sees the loss the failure of the church
[1:43:22] the work work of
[1:43:24] Satan and the little bits of goodness
[1:43:26] that we do here and there and that's the
[1:43:28] Earthly SE that's the Earthly scene that
[1:43:30] that that was painted for him but now
[1:43:33] John comes up a little higher and what
[1:43:34] does John see John sees the Eternal
[1:43:37] purpose of God he sees a seven sealed
[1:43:40] book he sees which is what the Lamb's
[1:43:42] Book of Life and what he sees now is not
[1:43:46] what the is happening on Earth he sees
[1:43:47] what's happening in heaven to influence
[1:43:50] what's on Earth John sees a bride John
[1:43:53] sees
[1:43:54] himself John sees the sacrifice John
[1:43:56] sees the mercy John sees the overcoming
[1:43:59] John sees how God's going to do it all
[1:44:02] when he comes up into the heavenlies
[1:44:04] what is it he stepped into a higher
[1:44:05] Revelation a higher understanding an
[1:44:08] eagle's view God's view of
[1:44:11] things all that John saw in his Earthly
[1:44:16] Revelation was pretty much
[1:44:19] failure first one he saw Christ then he
[1:44:21] goes into Revelation 2 and 3 and he just
[1:44:23] sees a church that's going down down
[1:44:24] down down
[1:44:26] down down down down down down darker and
[1:44:29] darker and darker the spirit of
[1:44:31] antichrist working in it but once he
[1:44:33] gets a higher
[1:44:35] view John
[1:44:37] shouts John Praises John
[1:44:41] worships John takes his part John eats
[1:44:44] the
[1:44:47] book why he stepped up God took him to
[1:44:51] where he wanted him him to see
[1:44:54] everything see the big picture to
[1:44:56] understand what's going on behind the
[1:44:58] scenes and he didn't just give it to
[1:45:00] John he gave it to the
[1:45:01] bride amen he opened up that seven seal
[1:45:05] book for us that's what happened in 1963
[1:45:07] he opened up that seven seal book so we
[1:45:09] could see our place and not just put it
[1:45:11] on a prophet not just put it on a
[1:45:13] Ministry not just put it on a fivefold
[1:45:15] group of men but that each and every one
[1:45:17] of us could come there and in reading
[1:45:19] this we could say our names in the book
[1:45:23] our places in the book our purposes in
[1:45:25] the book and with that the authority and
[1:45:27] power that God has placed in his bride
[1:45:28] to go behind those
[1:45:30] things we've got to have the same thing
[1:45:33] we've got to come up higher we've got to
[1:45:35] step up now I'm saying that like it's
[1:45:39] pressure I'm not I'm saying we've got to
[1:45:42] because he's done the
[1:45:44] work as in we're going to when I say
[1:45:47] we've got to I'm saying we're going to
[1:45:49] because he sent us a message that would
[1:45:51] open up these Mysteries that would open
[1:45:53] up this book that would restore us to
[1:45:55] the faith of the
[1:45:56] fathers and so now I'm saying we've got
[1:45:58] to by promise not by pressure we've got
[1:46:02] to by promise not because we're working
[1:46:06] hard but we've got to step up and what
[1:46:08] do we do then we start to say lord it's
[1:46:10] in your
[1:46:11] word that's all we're doing we're not
[1:46:14] praying for God to do something we're
[1:46:16] praying for God to fulfill what he said
[1:46:17] he was going to do we're saying be it
[1:46:19] unto me according to your word like Mary
[1:46:21] did why because he's open opened up in
[1:46:23] this book where we are going and what
[1:46:25] we're here for that's what this end time
[1:46:27] message is predestined to do is to
[1:46:29] prepare a bride Malachi 45 and 6 Luke
[1:46:34] 17:30 and Revelation 10 7 to1 all these
[1:46:37] different ones point to what the
[1:46:38] revealing the mystery of Christ being
[1:46:40] revealed in a bride through an end time
[1:46:43] message it's causing us to step up
[1:46:45] higher in expectation in belief in hope
[1:46:48] in all of these things brother BR puts
[1:46:50] it this way as we start to close he says
[1:46:52] and we do have today by God's help the
[1:46:55] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:46:58] Divine
[1:46:58] Vindication he says then that which is
[1:47:01] in part is done away
[1:47:03] with now people will look at that
[1:47:05] perhaps and say well that's the
[1:47:07] prophet's message the prophet fulfilled
[1:47:10] that how narrow sighted is
[1:47:14] that because if I if everything stopped
[1:47:17] with the prophet then where's the Holy
[1:47:19] Ghost today where's the anointing today
[1:47:21] where's the ministry to today where's
[1:47:23] Christ being revealed today if not in a
[1:47:26] bride anden that is not only the prophet
[1:47:29] he's saying when we have it when we have
[1:47:30] a perfect interpretation of the word
[1:47:32] with Divine Vindication then all the
[1:47:34] little stuff Falls
[1:47:35] away and what is it it's Christ coming
[1:47:38] into you and backing his word
[1:47:41] up that's all it
[1:47:43] is by simple Faith by simple obedience
[1:47:48] we step into what he's called us to and
[1:47:50] he vindicates his word through us
[1:47:57] Jesus said my words are spirit and
[1:48:00] life that means they can't stay dead on
[1:48:02] the paper on the page they need a body
[1:48:05] they need a manifestation point they
[1:48:07] need life they need somebody to live it
[1:48:09] through brother BR would say this he
[1:48:12] says all right to be born of the spirit
[1:48:15] now to be born of the Flesh and have
[1:48:16] wisdom of the world the wisdom will obey
[1:48:18] its fleshly teacher but he said to be
[1:48:21] born of the spirit is to believe and
[1:48:23] obey the teaching of the
[1:48:25] Bible by the Holy Spirit by the Holy
[1:48:28] Ghost see there's a lot of people
[1:48:30] reading this Bible there's a lot of
[1:48:33] people obeying this Bible but it's
[1:48:36] through fleshly Spirits not by the Holy
[1:48:38] Spirit and so what do they
[1:48:41] do they walk and fall into a ditch
[1:48:44] because it's just men Leading
[1:48:46] Men He says and a man that's born to the
[1:48:49] spirit will obey God's word regardless
[1:48:51] of what any tradition tells him
[1:48:53] it's just it he says you are reborn and
[1:48:56] that's the reason you see to belong to
[1:48:58] an organization he says put all your
[1:49:00] hopes in that he says to be born of the
[1:49:02] spirit is to believe and behave yourself
[1:49:05] in the spirit is to understand and
[1:49:07] believe with your heart that Jesus is
[1:49:10] Christ and this is his word that no
[1:49:12] other words can be added to it or taken
[1:49:14] away from it without your name taken out
[1:49:16] of the book of life he says that's a
[1:49:18] strong one if you add one thing to it in
[1:49:20] your tradition or take one thing from it
[1:49:22] well Christ said himself your name shall
[1:49:24] be rubbed off the book of life he says
[1:49:26] Now find organization or denomination in
[1:49:28] the Bible he says you'll run from it all
[1:49:30] right regardless of the flesh
[1:49:32] denomination teaching is contrary to the
[1:49:34] Bible he said yes Born Again means a new
[1:49:37] birth from above or birth from above he
[1:49:40] says then we are active in the things
[1:49:43] from Above This is where we're getting
[1:49:46] to stepping up he says now we're active
[1:49:49] in things from above why for it is him
[1:49:52] himself acting in his word through you
[1:49:55] his Branch to the vine Born Again from
[1:49:58] above he says then we are active we're
[1:50:00] active in things from above for his life
[1:50:03] is in us which is his word vindicating
[1:50:06] the word
[1:50:07] itself he says the spirit that's in you
[1:50:10] is the word made flesh in
[1:50:13] you
[1:50:14] Church the greatest thing God does for a
[1:50:18] Believer is fills him with the Holy
[1:50:21] Spirit without that we're
[1:50:23] lost without that we are absolutely
[1:50:26] nothing we are doomed to fail but he
[1:50:28] says the spirit that's in you is the
[1:50:31] word made flesh in
[1:50:32] you do we recognize this morning who we
[1:50:37] are well I just got the Holy Ghost
[1:50:39] because that's what believers do no the
[1:50:41] word is made flesh in
[1:50:43] you he says the spirit Minds the word
[1:50:47] and is active in vindicating the word
[1:50:52] we've SE seen and heard great things to
[1:50:55] vindicate this message there's never
[1:50:57] been a message like it since the days of
[1:50:59] Paul the days of Christ nothing like
[1:51:03] it constant signs and wonders constant
[1:51:07] prophecy discernment of the thoughts and
[1:51:09] intents of the heart never
[1:51:11] wrong thousands times thousands times
[1:51:15] thousands of times recorded in
[1:51:17] newspapers recorded on video recorded on
[1:51:19] audio tape all of these different things
[1:51:23] why to give us
[1:51:25] Faith to give us
[1:51:27] Vision to help us see that we a part of
[1:51:31] it it didn't come to vindicate itself it
[1:51:34] came to vindicate the people that would
[1:51:36] receive it as well amen we aren't just
[1:51:39] here we're not just living our lives and
[1:51:41] buying houses and driving cars into the
[1:51:43] ground and going on vacations and going
[1:51:45] to work uh 8 and n and 10 hours a day
[1:51:48] whatever it might be amen we're here to
[1:51:50] be a living hope we're here to be an
[1:51:52] expectation of the word being fulfilled
[1:51:55] and not just an expectation but a
[1:51:56] reality of it a Vindication of that word
[1:51:59] that we've been given and so we can come
[1:52:01] behind that and we can say God give me a
[1:52:02] greater reality not because we're asking
[1:52:05] for it but because he promised it you
[1:52:07] know the easiest way to get something
[1:52:09] from God ask him for something he
[1:52:11] promised see so often we're we're trying
[1:52:13] to bring something to the table we're
[1:52:15] trying to make the word of God work in
[1:52:17] our
[1:52:18] favor what we need to do is step into
[1:52:21] his favor by taking what he said
[1:52:23] and just saying Lord I'm going to pray
[1:52:24] for that I'm going to seek after that
[1:52:26] what you've already promised I'm not
[1:52:27] going to try and twist it I'm not going
[1:52:28] to try and manipulate it Lord give me
[1:52:30] what you promis let your word vindicate
[1:52:32] itself in me that ought to be our prayer
[1:52:35] amen we're not telling him what to do
[1:52:37] we're asking him to do what he promised
[1:52:39] that's what Israel did for 430 years was
[1:52:42] they cried out because of their task
[1:52:45] Masters Lord will you do it Lord would
[1:52:47] you do it Lord would you do it and then
[1:52:49] then there's a day when the clock
[1:52:51] stopped and God says I've heard the Cry
[1:52:53] of my people and he dropped down and
[1:52:56] nothing was going to stop their
[1:52:58] Deliverance nothing was going to stop
[1:52:59] their healing nothing was going to stop
[1:53:01] their provision nothing was going to
[1:53:03] stop them from making it to a Promised
[1:53:06] Land let's stand as we read these last
[1:53:08] two
[1:53:09] quotes he says if God when I was an
[1:53:12] alien from him so loved me that he
[1:53:15] stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:53:18] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:53:19] to use me he's got a purpose in doing it
[1:53:23] he saw something in me he saw something
[1:53:25] in you he had a reason to save you look
[1:53:27] at the people that's unsaved today look
[1:53:30] at the millions he could have took
[1:53:31] beside you but he took you amen he says
[1:53:34] no one can take your place amen he says
[1:53:38] you're in God's economy no one can do it
[1:53:41] and he says that's his love to
[1:53:44] you that's his love to you he says then
[1:53:47] won't Your Love reach right back to him
[1:53:49] he says there's a love affair no matter
[1:53:51] what the sit situation is its
[1:53:54] circumstances are governed by this love
[1:53:56] that creates faith that God loves you
[1:53:59] and you love God and you love one
[1:54:00] another and that brings the faith he
[1:54:03] says all right then it can't keep from
[1:54:05] bringing out just exactly what God
[1:54:08] promised it would
[1:54:10] do you want what God has for you start
[1:54:14] reading the title Deed start reading
[1:54:17] your inheritance start finding your
[1:54:20] place in that portion start find finding
[1:54:22] your way in that book and then say Lord
[1:54:24] this is what your word
[1:54:26] says and what's going to happen when you
[1:54:28] do that is he's going to start to change
[1:54:30] your thinking he'll start to change your
[1:54:32] understanding and then you'll start to
[1:54:34] speak in the way that a son and daughter
[1:54:35] of God is is supposed to speak I'm not
[1:54:38] saying you're not there I'm saying like
[1:54:41] John we can come up higher we can step
[1:54:44] up I said it last service we're in a
[1:54:46] restoration process we're in a redeeming
[1:54:49] process that means there's always more
[1:54:52] until we're gone there's always more to
[1:54:54] be had there's always more to give
[1:54:57] there's always more to receive amen he
[1:55:00] says then it can't keep from bringing
[1:55:02] out just exactly what God promised it to
[1:55:04] do that's our rest this morning not in
[1:55:07] my performance not in your performance
[1:55:09] not in your greatness not in your gifts
[1:55:10] and certainly not in mine it's that he
[1:55:12] promised he would do it and God will
[1:55:15] never allow his word to fall short amen
[1:55:18] God bless you this morning let's bow our
[1:55:20] heads

[1:55:44] ears hear what these emotions
[1:55:47] feel Lord and we forget that it's a
[1:55:50] spiritual war we're in Lord that we're
[1:55:53] spiritual creatures we're Eternal

[1:56:24] this body so Lord I help pray that you'd
