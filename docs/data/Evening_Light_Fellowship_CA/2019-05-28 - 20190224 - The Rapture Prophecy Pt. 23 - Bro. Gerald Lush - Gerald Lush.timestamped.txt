[41:08] wrote that song Amen praise some more
[41:13] amen well wonderful wonderful song and
[41:15] wonderful testimony right throughout
[41:17] that song he was the first to rescue us
[41:20] amen
[41:21] and were never to be lost again a minute
[41:25] what wonderful amen so let's sing out
[41:34] here somewhere
[41:35] 3:57 breaked out of read of life amen
[41:40] it's it's why we've come we've come to
[41:45] worship Him
[41:46] and to bring him on the scene
[41:50] but we've come to hear the word and I
[41:51] have him break the bread of life to us
[41:55] hey man you know we're just just
[41:58] thinking us weak listen to it listen to
[42:00] a message and I began to realize in a
[42:06] greater way that when we when we gather
[42:10] together like this you know we know that
[42:12] whoever two or more gathered in his name
[42:14] there he is an amiss but it's even to me
[42:18] it's even greater than that because
[42:20] that's the same God that split the Red
[42:23] Sea for the children of Israel to walk
[42:26] across the same God that stopped the
[42:29] earth rotation so that Joshua could
[42:31] fight his battle and finish it it's the
[42:34] same God that's here so it really
[42:38] doesn't matter how we feel physically or
[42:41] anything like that or whatever might be
[42:42] bothering us that same God that stopped
[42:46] the earth brother branham say he he
[42:48] would do it for one of his children so
[42:52] if you need healing this morning if they
[42:55] needed to touch from him you just need
[42:57] to get closer to him that same girl I
[42:59] was walking the aisles today just
[43:03] remember that and I could after after
[43:07] getting that that understanding I can't
[43:10] be the same coming into this church
[43:12] anymore just can't so he's here to touch
[43:17] us all we got to do is just reach out
[43:21] let's sing break down a brand of life to
[43:23] us
[43:24] [Music]
[43:37] do
[43:39] [Music]
[43:57] they

[47:34] thank you
[47:36] [Music]
[47:58] [Music]
[48:17] [Music]
[48:18] first verse
[48:28] [Music]
[48:53] [Music]
[49:07] [Music]
[49:17] amen they come back to here just the
[49:22] mechanics of the word but the living
[49:24] works the dynamics a man it's true often
[49:29] that most are focusing on the on the
[49:33] mechanics on the letter of the word but
[49:36] very few are focusing on the on the
[49:39] mechanic the dynamics the power of the
[49:42] word a man so I pray grace that we're
[49:44] going to put the emphasis on the power
[49:46] the annoying so that the word is not
[49:48] just new thoughts in our heads but it's
[49:51] a new influence in our lives by the
[49:54] grace of Almighty God if you do what you
[49:56] do is because of the work and it's not
[49:59] just the letter but the Living Word
[50:01] because it's not you that lives it's the
[50:04] word living in you amen we say always
[50:07] Jesus living in me and and the greater
[50:09] the greatest revelation most God of
[50:11] Jesus is no more than what this this
[50:14] brother did in painting a man so brother
[50:17] we gotta have the spiritual revelation
[50:20] of Jesus the personal revelation of
[50:22] Jesus a man that I know him and he knows
[50:25] me
[50:26] Amen hi fellow sir within me fellows who
[50:28] with me is alive he's an attending yeah
[50:32] he gave the promises I'll never leave
[50:34] you I'll never forsake you I'll be with
[50:36] you even in you he said to the end of
[50:40] the age if he's in you then he's in
[50:41] control he's in control of your thoughts
[50:44] your spirits your motors your objectives
[50:46] and let's be careful make sure go under
[50:49] his anointing under his control
[50:50] a man because again let's remember it be
[50:53] reminded concerning Jesus and His
[50:56] disciples I might not chosen you twelve
[50:57] and one of you is a devil a man well of
[51:00] course he knew a man he knew which one
[51:02] and so we pray the grace of God
[51:04] concerning God and those that God has
[51:06] chosen to believe this message around
[51:08] the world we know that some of them are
[51:10] devils and some of them are demons so we
[51:13] better be on our guard make sure we got
[51:15] the right anointing amen
[51:17] and that it's the spirit of Jesus
[51:19] influencing us not the spirit of the
[51:21] devil
[51:21] amen so the grace of it grace of God and
[51:25] if there's Jesus brother you talk about
[51:27] a right attitude at
[51:28] right spirit amen it's going to be Jesus
[51:31] amen
[51:32] so the grace of God be with us so be in
[51:36] prayer for us today because today I have
[51:40] to be back at the condo because there is
[51:43] a board meeting and we are required to
[51:46] be there and not not everyone in the
[51:49] condo but the owners of candles and
[51:51] that's what it's mainly for so we have
[51:55] to be there I have to be there at least
[51:57] two o'clock and so being prayer as we go
[52:01] through the word a man so it's gonna
[52:04] shorten my time but again it's that's
[52:07] art on the preacher because I'll tell
[52:09] you I'll be honest there's so much that
[52:12] I feit that's a blessing to me as a
[52:14] servant of God as a pastor I read and
[52:18] I'd see the pastor any ministry is going
[52:21] to see things that you're not going to
[52:22] see amen but God's going to show it to
[52:25] them reveal it to them so they can
[52:27] convey it to you a man out there today I
[52:30] got scripture after scripture after
[52:31] scripture quote after quote after quote
[52:33] and there's message after message after
[52:35] message that I feel that we need to know
[52:38] when they need to be brought to our
[52:39] attention a man by the grace of God so
[52:43] it's it's difficult when you're when
[52:45] you're put under the pressure to do this
[52:47] part of the pressure to do that a man
[52:49] but again when the ministry submits to
[52:53] it not my will father don't be done
[52:55] because as Jesus endured it as the
[52:58] bravas endure it it so that any ministry
[53:00] will endure it for the Gospels sake by
[53:03] the grace of God so be in prayer because
[53:06] I wanted to finish some of the quotes on
[53:08] the message on the rapture and to finish
[53:10] that series concerning the rapture a man
[53:13] we could go on and somebody said your
[53:15] there's no way you can told me some
[53:19] years ago there's no way I could compare
[53:21] to brotherly veil and because they said
[53:24] brotherly Bailey he take a message a
[53:26] sermon and he set off the prophet and he
[53:28] would preach seventy messages on it and
[53:31] you know because he would go through and
[53:34] he would start at the beginning goes
[53:35] through sentence by sentence by sentence
[53:38] and commenting on what the Providence
[53:40] said highlighting what it what it was
[53:41] all about
[53:42] and I remember preaching a certain
[53:45] sermon and sister coffee did say was the
[53:47] best she ever heard and and I preached
[53:50] 69 messages on that sermon and and I
[53:54] said well does that qualify me I said to
[53:56] beyond the same level as brotherly Bale
[53:59] a man so there is there's a lot because
[54:02] the power of God says the more you go
[54:04] into it the more it's gonna be revealed
[54:05] and that is the truth the mother see
[54:09] it's like the Bible talking to our
[54:11] brother Alec last night at the
[54:12] fellowship met brother
[54:14] Chad's sister Leah's two most oh this is
[54:18] this is just the Bible and this is about
[54:21] God and and so on and what he did and
[54:24] what he and what he's going to do he's
[54:25] saving us we were lost and we're being
[54:28] saved but I said there's not many that
[54:30] really got the revelation of the plain
[54:33] purpose and pattern I'll tell you I
[54:35] thought it is there's very very few in
[54:37] the world today that even stopped and
[54:39] consider the plan of God the purpose of
[54:42] God or the pattern of God and that's why
[54:44] the the enemy gets gets them and
[54:46] confuses them and leaves them astray and
[54:49] they're religious but they are not
[54:51] spiritual a man so it was the same thing
[54:54] with Cain God said have you do well and
[54:56] it's got to be according to the word
[54:57] you'll be accepted amen but he wouldn't
[55:00] do it
[55:01] and there's a lot of believers that
[55:02] believe the message but they're not
[55:04] going to go all the way and get into the
[55:05] message and let the message get into
[55:07] them amen to go and live the message a
[55:10] man and grow to be controlled by the
[55:13] message a master that you're not living
[55:15] you're not living for yourself you're
[55:16] living for what God has revealed you're
[55:19] living because you you see this book
[55:21] amen wonderful so many Christians they
[55:25] just read it as a devotional and that's
[55:27] it
[55:27] but for us is life amen it's the
[55:31] revelation of what's going on in the
[55:33] world from time down toward eternity
[55:35] down through time going back to going
[55:37] back to eternity by the grace of
[55:39] Almighty God a man so good we thank the
[55:42] Lord for the song and our brother John
[55:43] and Kalambo trio saying concerning from
[55:49] time to eternity praise the name of the
[55:52] Lord say brother then this is the plan
[55:55] going from time to eternity this is the
[55:58] plan a man that shows us the climax of
[56:00] it all is the rapture a man it is not
[56:05] just us just going on and one day we're
[56:07] gonna there's gonna be a resurrection
[56:09] and one day you know Jesus is gonna come
[56:11] and work we're gonna see him and so on
[56:13] no no he comes down and takes us up as
[56:16] he came down and took up the Old
[56:18] Testament Saints he's gonna come down
[56:19] and take up the New Testament Saints
[56:21] brothers see they don't recognize it and
[56:24] for years and years and years - it was
[56:26] just a good book you know the Bible
[56:28] that's all but to us it's the it's the
[56:31] it's the plan purpose and pattern of God
[56:34] but it's also the plan and purpose and
[56:37] pattern of God of our lives
[56:39] a man you identify with it personally
[56:42] you got to know where you where it
[56:44] started you got to know what God was
[56:46] doing doing down through the ages - well
[56:48] for he was aiming to get you a man so
[56:51] it's not not by accident so we got to
[56:53] see ourselves in the Word of God by the
[56:56] grace of God so God Elvis is my prayer
[56:59] and the Lord willing as I said I'll try
[57:01] to get in and just give you the thoughts
[57:03] of the profit on the rapture but and I
[57:09] appreciated the song Jesus on the inside
[57:13] and you know what he's doing he's
[57:16] changing your life from the inside out
[57:19] and what he's doing it's not just just
[57:21] just so that you move dear and be a
[57:23] witness no he's taking us back to
[57:25] eternity
[57:25] God is working in us by the grace of God
[57:28] a man not just to be a witness that's
[57:31] part of it but our do we realize the end
[57:34] result of all of it all is going from
[57:37] time to eternity it's going back home to
[57:39] be with the Lord by the grace of God a
[57:42] man and the move is on to change the
[57:46] body we're moving into a greater and a
[57:50] more glorified condition we thank God
[57:53] for what he's done but brother what God
[57:55] has done you know why he did this you
[57:58] know why he did that he's to get us to
[58:00] put our emphasis on it
[58:01] they get us to live for it
[58:03] man together see just as just Dave
[58:06] morning morning new tonight that were
[58:08] focusing on what God has done and what
[58:11] God is doing what God has revealed and
[58:13] what God is revealing well you know what
[58:15] we're doing we're walking in the light
[58:17] brother is not just coming in the light
[58:20] and sitting down it's walking in the
[58:22] light a man by the grace of Almighty God
[58:25] well there's too many back that have
[58:27] come in and they sit down under
[58:28] religious and that's it a man oh I'm a
[58:31] believer they're not both the other
[58:33] believers all right but they're believe
[58:35] in the devil more than they believe in
[58:36] Jesus amen because if you're walking in
[58:39] the light it controls you here in the
[58:42] church it controls you out there in your
[58:43] job it controls you in your home no
[58:46] matter what it is it's the light Amen by
[58:49] the grace of God again like that
[58:51] gentleman that you've married to a wife
[58:54] and there's the Christian and he and he
[58:56] told people he were talking about it one
[58:58] time in a pub and he said I he said my
[59:00] wife's a Christian he succumbed me said
[59:02] yeah with me and I'll show you and he
[59:05] said I'll prove it and he was going to
[59:07] bring out her Christian testimony and of
[59:10] course they went in and then they they
[59:12] were drinking in his house and then and
[59:14] they made a mess around the table in the
[59:16] kitchen and so finally they moved into
[59:18] the living room and the wife came out
[59:20] with a broom and she said she began to
[59:24] sweep up must Jesus bear the cross alone
[59:27] and that's why she was singing and all
[59:29] the world will go free no there's a
[59:31] cross through everyone there's a cross
[59:33] from me and she was thanking the Lord
[59:36] and praising the Lord and he and he
[59:38] whispered to the others he says see I
[59:39] told you she was a Christian a man
[59:42] whereas others would maybe get real mad
[59:44] and real upset a man but she was she was
[59:47] walking in the light as she was
[59:50] controlled by the light
[59:52] amen she didn't do what was right in her
[59:54] own eyes naturally but spiritually a man
[59:57] she was looking through the eyes of God
[59:59] a man and she was not just as I said
[1:00:03] identifying with him in the power of his
[1:00:05] resurrection but in the Fellowship of
[1:00:07] his suffering amen
[1:00:09] so god help us brothers sister I pray
[1:00:12] that you're going you're going to be
[1:00:13] willing to reflect Jesus amen
[1:00:17] Jeff before we sing only believe we
[1:00:22] received the card from our sister Alana
[1:00:25] and brother David butts in in Louisiana

[1:00:41] finished a preaching and myself and
[1:00:42] brother David will be leaving because I
[1:00:44] got to get to that meeting but sister
[1:00:48] Alana said we want to thank you all for
[1:00:50] your love and support

[1:12:18] [Music]
[1:12:22] multi-ball
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:31] Amen god bless just turn with me to the
[1:12:36] book of Judges chapter 17 the book of
[1:12:39] Judges chapter 17 a man and as returning
[1:12:50] to judges 17 again to remind you of what
[1:12:54] I read I believe in the last service
[1:12:56] here and it is the message on perfect
[1:12:59] faith that was preached just shortly
[1:13:03] before the Lord called brother Branham
[1:13:05] home well this was known in this was
[1:13:08] August 63 and of course the rapture
[1:13:11] message was in in December 65 that was
[1:13:15] before the Lord called him all a man and
[1:13:18] his last emphasis was really the rapture
[1:13:22] a man and the communion so the grace of
[1:13:25] God but in 1963 after the opening of the
[1:13:28] seven seals he said this come to perfect
[1:13:34] faith he said this is coming into that
[1:13:37] third Pole a man which we believe was
[1:13:40] the opening of the word the breaking
[1:13:42] that of the seven seals the revealing of
[1:13:44] the mystery of God and the question is
[1:13:47] are we coming and had we come in to the
[1:13:50] third Pole
[1:13:51] are we still under the first and second
[1:13:53] Pole and just believing this was the
[1:13:55] third pole we got to move as the Prophet
[1:13:58] had to move we've got to move he had to
[1:14:00] move on beyond the first and beyond the
[1:14:02] second Pole not putting emphasis on it
[1:14:04] but he has just begin to put emphasis on
[1:14:07] the third Pole and that was the opening
[1:14:09] of the word and even after the opening
[1:14:11] of the seven seals the prophet of God
[1:14:13] preached this message and that message
[1:14:15] he said this and in one was marriage and
[1:14:17] divorce and he said this is another
[1:14:19] revelation on the sea and the seven
[1:14:21] seals the mystery of God so God began to
[1:14:24] reveal and open to us the revelation of
[1:14:27] his will a man on to perfect faith and
[1:14:30] even unto the rapture he made what he's
[1:14:33] looking for his pearly faith a man and
[1:14:36] because it's going to take perfect faith
[1:14:38] to get us in the right
[1:14:40] a man so he said this is coming into
[1:14:43] that third pole what perfect faith the
[1:14:46] open word giving perfect faith brother
[1:14:50] what God gave Luther was perfect what
[1:14:53] God Wesley was perfect and the
[1:14:55] Pentecostals and others but brother he
[1:14:57] wasn't going to produce the perfect
[1:14:59] faith that God was looking for for the
[1:15:01] rapture and for the resurrection it gave
[1:15:03] him the faith they needed for that and
[1:15:05] for that and for that but brother there
[1:15:08] was a generation that was rising that
[1:15:09] needed a faith for the rapture a faith
[1:15:12] for the resurrection a man so we pray
[1:15:15] the grace of God that we are now in the
[1:15:18] third pole we are experiencing the third
[1:15:20] pole it is Christ working in us on the
[1:15:24] rapture so this is coming in to that
[1:15:27] third pole and he said I am working out
[1:15:30] something and he said is taking this
[1:15:33] charge of faith understand it hear it
[1:15:37] believe it and he said and going right
[1:15:39] back he sir where you have never noticed
[1:15:43] it that way before he said not a faith
[1:15:47] because it was faith faith faith but now
[1:15:51] he said the emphasis is on perfect faith
[1:15:53] a man praise the name of the Lord and he
[1:15:57] said not a faith but a perfect faith and
[1:16:00] he said build up in here and I believe
[1:16:05] us build up in the in your heart and in
[1:16:07] your soul and he said and watch a
[1:16:09] perfect God with a perfect heart he said
[1:16:13] keep a perfect promise a man praise the
[1:16:17] Lord he said by is perfect word a man
[1:16:21] and that's your perfection and my
[1:16:24] perfection by the grace of God amen this
[1:16:27] is Grace it is by grace through faith we
[1:16:30] are saved it is by grace through faith
[1:16:32] through faith that God is God doing
[1:16:34] revealing the word see when it was it
[1:16:37] was that Grace and that faith that God

[1:16:46] faith it is by grace through faith aim
[1:16:50] that was that was salvation there in his
[1:16:53] justification in his Saint a vacation in
[1:16:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:57] but brother the salvation that God
[1:16:59] looking for now is the redemption of our
[1:17:01] bodies
[1:17:02] amen and God and it requires perfect
[1:17:05] faith absolute perfect faith you can't
[1:17:08] add to it now you can't take from it a

[1:17:14] choice of any cities to keep a perfect
[1:17:16] promised by His perfect word which is
[1:17:20] sharper than a two-edged sword and a

[1:17:27] and intents of yard amen

[1:18:34] because Lord I want your leadership a
[1:18:37] man now many one among God's leadership
[1:18:39] know no man and and what they'll do is
[1:18:43] they'll compromise no compromise said to
[1:18:45] get you know to please themselves oh and
[1:18:48] at the same time the devil of persuade
[1:18:50] them that they're pleasing God God won't
[1:18:52] mind this guy won't mind that but in the
[1:18:54] judgment you'll realize it was too late
[1:18:56] amen that he did offend God a man in God
[1:19:00] through the ministry tried to explain
[1:19:01] expand
[1:19:02] those things but they're not accepting
[1:19:04] those things today they just want the
[1:19:06] preacher to get up preach preacher
[1:19:07] revelation preach this revelation crease
[1:19:10] that revelation but don't get personal
[1:19:12] amen my god gets personal amen so

[1:19:25] to do in his elect in his sons and
[1:19:27] daughters amen and then in this hour and
[1:19:30] in this age they got to be completely
[1:19:32] surrendered to him they got to be
[1:19:34] completely given over to his leadership
[1:19:36] a man as Jesus ahead lay down and yield
[1:19:40] completely the flesh to the will of God
[1:19:42] for that hour for that time amen in the
[1:19:45] in the in the crucifixion of the word
[1:19:47] brother so now so we got to do the same
[1:19:49] thing in this hour amen

[1:19:53] give ourselves completely over to the
[1:19:55] revealed word amen and I'll tell you
[1:19:57] it's the the the word is crucified again
[1:20:00] the second crucifixion of Christ is in
[1:20:03] the bright a man that's the truth they
[1:20:06] don't think it was over there in the
[1:20:08] denominations the first pole the second
[1:20:10] ball no no no and then they come to the
[1:20:12] third pole and they rejected it and so
[1:20:14] on but we believe it no he has Satan is
[1:20:16] there to crucify Christ in the bride
[1:20:18] amen he knows the right crisis made
[1:20:21] flesh in the bride so brother I pray God

[1:20:26] spiritually and were thought word and
[1:20:28] deed a man and he said we are coming now
[1:20:31] to the perfection because the people has
[1:20:35] to come to this in order for the rapture
[1:20:38] and that's what's holding it away right
[1:20:42] now is waiting for that church to come
[1:20:46] into that perfect raptured faith a man I
[1:20:51] just believe in scenario I believe where
[1:20:54] there's coming a rapture no where we got

[1:21:09] ki consider the world and the
[1:21:10] foolishness is going on over there
[1:21:12] brother and like I say it's worse than
[1:21:15] what your
[1:21:16] that is true there's more going on than
[1:21:19] what you realize that's right there's
[1:21:21] more being killed than what you want to
[1:21:23] know over there brother Santana and we
[1:21:27] know that it's laughing over in the end
[1:21:29] of the Great Tribulation brother the
[1:21:31] world is insane completely insane and
[1:21:33] the devil is in control as the proverb
[1:21:36] brought out in the rapture message and
[1:21:37] he said it he said the devil he said is
[1:21:39] the god of this world any years and if
[1:21:42] he's the god of this world what power
[1:21:43] does he have over this world
[1:21:45] well power is the exercising what's he
[1:21:47] doing hey man there's a lot of things
[1:21:49] he's doing brother they did that I trust
[1:21:51] my grace we believe and we realize it
[1:21:54] even though we're not seen it naturally
[1:21:56] yet but I pray God we're not here to see
[1:21:58] it in the Great Tribulation amen but
[1:22:01] we're gonna see and what we're going to
[1:22:02] see and be concentrating more on what
[1:22:04] God's doing and what God has done then
[1:22:07] what the devil is doing pray God that
[1:22:09] the Satan is not our God say they though
[1:22:12] he's the god of this world I trust that
[1:22:14] we're not of the world
[1:22:15] you guys are you love the world the
[1:22:17] things of the world he says the love of
[1:22:19] God is not in you and and when it come
[1:22:22] to the things of the world brother it's
[1:22:25] not necessarily when a country thing oh
[1:22:26] that's the simple stuff going on out
[1:22:28] there now they are they're known it's
[1:22:30] just it's just a just a sinful thing
[1:22:32] just whether the prophet of God brings
[1:22:33] that right here in the rapture message
[1:22:35] concerning what science invents and all
[1:22:38] of these things and people are caught up
[1:22:40] with the inventions of scientific
[1:22:42] inventions and brother I tell you get
[1:22:44] caught up with that brother yeah and
[1:22:46] you're gonna do what's right in your own
[1:22:47] eyes oh this is good but we're not we're
[1:22:49] not gonna get caught up in the rapture
[1:22:50] when it caught up in what science is
[1:22:52] doing
[1:22:52] amen brother god help us because the
[1:22:55] Bible says God brought Israel how did
[1:22:57] God did this God did this and they
[1:22:59] sought of many inventions and he said
[1:23:01] the prophet of God said and God came in
[1:23:03] sinner and destroyed them and destroyed
[1:23:06] their inventions
[1:23:07] amen brother Aeterna that's the scare
[1:23:09] that's not guy that God seen
[1:23:11] that's guess as the devil seat because
[1:23:14] Cain and his lying sort of these
[1:23:16] invention SSI Cain and initiate is
[1:23:19] scientific amen it's they're the ones
[1:23:22] that doing this they're the one who's
[1:23:23] doing that that's why they went over
[1:23:25] there after they were put out of the
[1:23:27] garden
[1:23:28] and then the seed of Cain they invented
[1:23:30] this he invented that the invented
[1:23:31] yeah even musical instruments they
[1:23:33] emitted all of they safe but there was
[1:23:35] it wasn't a seed of Abel there wasn't a
[1:23:37] wasn't God seat he it wasn't it wasn't
[1:23:40] an atom seat
[1:23:41] it was serpent seat brother every better
[1:23:44] honor God don't love the world and only
[1:23:46] I don't love the world but whatever the
[1:23:48] things of the world and people are
[1:23:50] getting caught up with the things of the
[1:23:51] world because it appeals to the flesh a
[1:23:53] man God Elvis so he said we got to come
[1:23:57] to this with this faith in order perfect
[1:24:00] faith in order for the rapture and
[1:24:02] that's what's only in a way right now is
[1:24:05] waiting for that church to come into
[1:24:08] that perfect rapture faith so brother be
[1:24:11] are we focusing on it I'll be thinking
[1:24:13] about it meditating on it pray more and
[1:24:16] more Lord let me help me let go and let
[1:24:19] God have his way help me to get more and
[1:24:21] more into the revelation of the rapture
[1:24:23] now I'm in a sea Lord not what you have
[1:24:26] done but what you are doing a man he
[1:24:29] said I am looking for it and it's seen
[1:24:31] it means a lot of shaking down for me
[1:24:34] the Prophet yeah a lot of shaking down
[1:24:38] for the Prophet it means a lot for you
[1:24:40] but together we'll make it by the grace
[1:24:43] of God amen
[1:24:44] well God's grace brother I trust we're
[1:24:47] going to make it work because we're not
[1:24:49] going to get caught up with the world or
[1:24:50] the things of the world any man this as
[1:24:55] much says what the gains line is gays
[1:24:58] caught up with that's where the service
[1:24:59] seat is caught up with it is the things
[1:25:02] of the world they're impressed by the
[1:25:03] inventions of man and so on and God
[1:25:06] brother and Israel came to this and
[1:25:09] bringing confusion among the children of
[1:25:12] Israel and I preached on this back in in
[1:25:16] Empire Avenue or are in the in that
[1:25:19] church center an empire avenue that we
[1:25:22] were using concerning doing what's right
[1:25:28] in their own eyes the Jews after God
[1:25:32] brought him out of Egypt doing what's
[1:25:34] right in their own eyes brought
[1:25:36] confusion leading to Civet or rather to
[1:25:40] bring
[1:25:41] the unbelief that led to civil and
[1:25:45] religious confusion in Israel a mayor
[1:25:48] God brought him into the promised land
[1:25:50] and God left this nation there that
[1:25:52] nation there in the other nation there a
[1:25:54] man man and just he was testing Israel
[1:25:58] and he even begged the tribe of Benjamin
[1:26:00] it was in complete victory any man and
[1:26:04] brother in complete obedience leads to
[1:26:08] civil and religious confusion and it is
[1:26:12] and that's what we're finding today even
[1:26:14] among message believers and it is in
[1:26:16] complete obedience and is leading to
[1:26:18] civil and religious confusion even among
[1:26:21] believers Amen God Elvis brother that
[1:26:24] we're going to we're not going to be
[1:26:26] guilty of in complete obedience but
[1:26:29] we're going to completely obey what God
[1:26:32] has revealed any man we're gonna stay
[1:26:34] with the truth the whole truth nothing
[1:26:35] but the truth any man even though in the
[1:26:39] world in the wall you're gonna be
[1:26:40] foolish in the eyes of the world are
[1:26:42] gonna be a fanatic the Prophet said a
[1:26:44] man but God's grace we're not fanatics
[1:26:49] in his eyes amen in judges chapter 17
[1:26:54] and there was a man of Mount Ephraim
[1:26:58] whose name was Micah and he said unto
[1:27:02] his mother the eleven hundred shekels of
[1:27:06] silver that were taken from thee about
[1:27:09] which thou cursus and speakers of also
[1:27:14] in mine ears bill the silver is with me
[1:27:17] I took it and his mother said blessed be
[1:27:20] thou of the Lord my son and when he had
[1:27:24] restored the eleven hundred shekels of
[1:27:27] silver to his mother his mother said I
[1:27:29] had only dedicated the silver unto the
[1:27:32] Lord from my hand for my son to make a
[1:27:39] graven image and a molten image now
[1:27:43] therefore I will restore it unto thee
[1:27:46] yet he restored the money on to his
[1:27:49] mother and his mother took two hundred
[1:27:52] shekels of silver and
[1:27:54] gave them to the founder who made their
[1:27:57] other graven image and a molten image
[1:27:59] and they were in the house of Micah and
[1:28:02] the man Micah a Dan house of God's just
[1:28:06] think God bringing Israel out of Egypt
[1:28:08] and here they are going into idolatry
[1:28:12] God bringing us out of out of
[1:28:14] denominational Egyptian bondage and many
[1:28:17] believers going into a dolla tree being
[1:28:21] caught up with a world and the things of
[1:28:23] the world they love this and they love
[1:28:25] that and just watch I preached on
[1:28:32] selling your birthright for a shekel and
[1:28:35] a suit and a shirt for money and you
[1:28:40] know for a good clothing and and this
[1:28:42] and that and something else that's what
[1:28:44] I pray something back years ago a shekel
[1:28:47] and a shirt don't know this is what a
[1:28:50] this is whether they're going to sell
[1:28:52] out for you watch this this is this is
[1:28:54] what the priests of God sold out for a
[1:28:59] man to go into a house that a idolatry
[1:29:03] or they there would this one believed in
[1:29:05] God and and they they had they had gods
[1:29:08] there and other gods their brother and
[1:29:11] then there's believers say oh they
[1:29:13] believe in God but you go into their
[1:29:15] homes and they got gods this is their
[1:29:18] God that is their God a man and it says
[1:29:21] the man Micah had a house of God's and
[1:29:24] made an effort and a tear of him and
[1:29:27] consecrated one of his sons who became
[1:29:30] is priest idolatry in those days there
[1:29:36] was no king in Israel but every man did
[1:29:41] that which was right in his own eyes
[1:29:44] this too was right in the eyes of God
[1:29:47] and there was a young man out of
[1:29:50] Bethlehem Judah of the family of Judah
[1:29:53] who was a Levite and he sojourn there
[1:29:56] and the man departed out of the city
[1:29:59] from Bethlehem Judah to sojourn where he
[1:30:03] could find the place and he came to
[1:30:05] Mount Ephraim
[1:30:07] the house of Micah as he journeyed and
[1:30:10] Micah said unto Him whence cometh now
[1:30:13] and he said unto him i am a levite of
[1:30:16] Bethlehem Judah and I go to sojourn
[1:30:19] where I may find a place where he were
[1:30:23] fighting favor with man not willing to
[1:30:29] stay separated under the Lord grace of
[1:30:33] God elbis and Micah said unto Him dwell
[1:30:38] with me and beyond to me a father and a
[1:30:43] priest and I will give the 10 shekels of
[1:30:47] silver by the year and a suit of apparel
[1:30:53] and thy victuals so the Levi went in a
[1:30:59] man he was deceit and the Levite was
[1:31:05] content to dwell with the man and the
[1:31:08] young man was unto him as one of his
[1:31:10] sons and Micah consecrated the Levite
[1:31:13] and the young man became his priest and
[1:31:15] was in the house of Micah and then said
[1:31:18] Micah now know high that the Lord will
[1:31:21] do me good scene I have a Levite to my
[1:31:24] priest but he would have to he would air
[1:31:27] to sanctify his home to get the rest of
[1:31:30] the others out the guards out the idols
[1:31:32] out a man a man before God wasn't going
[1:31:37] to bless him the priest went in God went
[1:31:40] out a man he's in complete obedience
[1:31:45] brother ledger civil and religious
[1:31:47] confusion amen and the same thing is
[1:31:50] going on today
[1:31:51] even among many believers god bless you
[1:31:54] may be seated
[1:32:01] so brother sister in the rapture God has
[1:32:04] called calling for a total separation
[1:32:06] from unbelief either actually God is
[1:32:09] calling for a perfect faith in the
[1:32:11] rapture God is calling for an absolute
[1:32:13] complete and total separation a greater
[1:32:16] separation of what hear it any what he
[1:32:18] required and what
[1:32:19] expected in any other age a man God
[1:32:23] expects it in God is required in this
[1:32:25] hour and in this age a male because why
[1:32:29] because the world is a lot worse than in
[1:32:31] this hour and in this age and it was in
[1:32:33] Luther's age the world is worse in this
[1:32:36] age than it was in Wesley or the
[1:32:37] Pentecostal age a mayor and his gang and
[1:32:41] the world is getting to that place it's
[1:32:43] worse yes and it's getting to that place
[1:32:45] as I've already said concerning the
[1:32:47] scriptures that he didn't shorten time
[1:32:49] to be no flesh saying but that means
[1:32:52] everything is getting pretty bad
[1:32:54] amen as it was in the days of Noah as it
[1:32:57] was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:32:59] brother ie raptured lot irreverent Enoch
[1:33:03] rather in rapture and Enoch a man but he
[1:33:06] say sent a mess of the deliverance
[1:33:08] messenger down to an Abraham and Sarah
[1:33:10] he sent messengers dentist into Sodom
[1:33:13] and Gomorrah a man for therefore the
[1:33:16] elect that where they were there a man
[1:33:18] now they they were they weren't ordained
[1:33:20] like Enoch for the rapture they didn't
[1:33:22] they didn't what with God a man and the
[1:33:25] one with God brother what it what is it
[1:33:27] - what with God it is so they God have
[1:33:29] control of your life so that so that
[1:33:32] it's not you their lives as God living
[1:33:34] in you a man the walk with God is is God
[1:33:37] good making this decision and you're
[1:33:39] carrying it out it's God making that
[1:33:41] decision in your kinda doubt and brother
[1:33:44] in conversation with with this person or
[1:33:47] that person it's not you that they're
[1:33:49] talking to they're talking to God a main
[1:33:51] because and what God would say that's
[1:33:54] what you're going to say and the
[1:33:56] thoughts and the ideas that you express
[1:33:58] is the thoughts and the ideas that God
[1:34:01] would express a man brother this is this
[1:34:04] is absolutely tremendous when it comes
[1:34:06] to being a part of the Bride of the Lord
[1:34:08] Jesus Christ amen remember as Jesus was
[1:34:13] the Word made flesh of the bride is the
[1:34:16] word made flesh and the fullness of the
[1:34:18] Godhead body was in the flesh of Jesus
[1:34:21] and the prophets say the fullness of the
[1:34:23] Godhead bodily is in the flesh of the
[1:34:25] bride brother this is serious care are
[1:34:28] we part of the body you know we're in
[1:34:31] the fullness of the Godhead is living
[1:34:33] we're in the fullness of the Godhead is
[1:34:35] made flesh we're in the fullness of the
[1:34:37] God it is is living of the word of God
[1:34:40] for this hour and for this age a man
[1:34:43] we're in the fullness of the Godhead any
[1:34:45] in the body of the bride is what it is
[1:34:48] bringing for the redemption of our
[1:34:50] bodies and the resurrection as Jesus did
[1:34:52] back there listen say she had to come to
[1:34:55] a total separation back there in the
[1:34:58] elephant ministry so it comes to a total
[1:35:00] separation in the Omega ministry a man
[1:35:03] because brother and he was separated led
[1:35:06] even concern his disciples he wanted
[1:35:09] their fellowship with anyone is a man
[1:35:12] because because it got to the place or
[1:35:14] there they had taken taken his ministry
[1:35:16] and his life for granted they then
[1:35:18] assumed too much and so on that's the
[1:35:20] true because the faith that he gave them
[1:35:23] was go school was decreasing a man man
[1:35:26] I'll do why do you know that because he
[1:35:29] gave them the power to go ahead and heal
[1:35:31] the sick and raise the dead and do this
[1:35:32] and do this and do that we don't have a
[1:35:34] record of all that they did but we do
[1:35:37] have a record that it was a time when
[1:35:39] they when they did they took her they
[1:35:41] took their faith for granted a man and
[1:35:44] when this man brought about his son and
[1:35:47] he asked the disciples to pray pray for
[1:35:49] his son and then they prayed but nothing
[1:35:52] happened and his son wasn't a gly
[1:35:54] brother they had already come back with
[1:35:56] a testimony that already said oh we we
[1:35:59] went out we did this we did this we did
[1:36:01] this but now they couldn't do this they
[1:36:03] couldn't pray they couldn't get bring
[1:36:04] deliverance for this man son
[1:36:07] so when it's true those were while he
[1:36:10] was there Jesus came down out of the
[1:36:12] mountain a man where he was praying
[1:36:14] where he was separated completely under
[1:36:17] under the word for his day and for his
[1:36:19] hour a man and he came down from the
[1:36:21] mountain praise the Lord he wasn't under
[1:36:24] the influence of the world and the
[1:36:25] things of the world and the main wind in
[1:36:28] eastern listener and I turned to your
[1:36:30] disciples but they couldn't do anything
[1:36:32] and he and he said and Dennis I and
[1:36:35] Jesus just spoke the word a man and his
[1:36:38] son was delivered and the disciples
[1:36:40] coming although an alcoholic on we
[1:36:42] couldn't do it he said the cars of the
[1:36:44] Billy penny sure this can come and not
[1:36:47] for by by prayer and fasting amen it's a
[1:36:51] closer walk with God is giving God more
[1:36:53] and more and more preeminence in your
[1:36:55] life brother I tell you this is not
[1:36:58] saying I believe the message is going to
[1:36:59] put us in the rapture and in the
[1:37:01] resurrection no no it's giving it's
[1:37:04] giving the word more and more control in
[1:37:06] our lives
[1:37:07] amen so it's not you the living it is
[1:37:11] God in your living it is God in your
[1:37:13] making his word flesh it is God in your
[1:37:15] bringing his word to pass and it just it
[1:37:18] will just automatically automatically
[1:37:21] bring separation it'll bring images
[1:37:24] automatically bring a total separation
[1:37:25] onto the Lord amen because you're you
[1:37:28] can't think about anything else only
[1:37:30] what God has done what God is doing
[1:37:32] amen it's the Holy Ghost in you is the
[1:37:35] fullness of the Godhead bodily in you
[1:37:37] and brother if if it is Christ in you
[1:37:39] like that how in the world can you can
[1:37:42] you love the world or the things of the
[1:37:43] world
[1:37:44] amen because God God hates it
[1:37:47] amen ISA Bev I love
[1:37:51] that Esau have I hated
[1:37:52] that brother want to come in a
[1:37:53] connoisseur in a cultures fleshly
[1:37:55] righteousness may-maybe Esau he was far
[1:37:59] better than Jacob they look and look at
[1:38:01] what he did to get beget the blessing of
[1:38:03] his father and he pretended that he was
[1:38:06] Esau yeah cuz because the Isaac was
[1:38:09] blowing it and he couldn't see and so he
[1:38:12] you know they put skin on his arms
[1:38:13] because because Esau his brother he
[1:38:18] atari arms and so on and so they went in
[1:38:23] and he tried to talk like Esau act like
[1:38:25] Esau and when Isaac felt his arms he
[1:38:28] felt the the fur and figured it was he
[1:38:31] saw some hairy arms and so on and he
[1:38:35] gave him the blessing a man now he saw I
[1:38:38] didn't do anything like that but
[1:38:39] everybody what would they the thing of
[1:38:41] the war say Saul sold his birthright
[1:38:43] amen because they loved the world
[1:38:47] the world a man because what did he do
[1:38:50] he wanted to go on dating and then he
[1:38:54] went out on he know he came back he was
[1:38:55] hungry he wanted some food and it's we
[1:38:58] could go back hunting again and only
[1:39:00] that he wanted to get this for his
[1:39:02] father a man but somewhere there was a
[1:39:06] wrong spirit and a wrong attitude in him
[1:39:08] a man
[1:39:08] he didn't give God the preeminence again
[1:39:11] he gave his earthly father the
[1:39:12] preeminence a man he gave his earthly
[1:39:15] family the preeminence and not is
[1:39:17] heavenly family old my brother's sister
[1:39:21] Grace understand that when it comes to
[1:39:23] our earthly and natural family that
[1:39:25] that's that's all they were what made us
[1:39:27] like that serpent seed that is the
[1:39:31] result of servants II but we come from
[1:39:33] eternity and we have eternity and us
[1:39:35] we're going back to eternity and so
[1:39:37] therefore the family that was that with
[1:39:39] that we were a part of before the
[1:39:40] foundation of the world that's the
[1:39:42] family that we're in love with a married
[1:39:45] brothers sister but here is Esau he was
[1:39:47] cut off with it with Isaac as a natural
[1:39:50] father well I'll go and do this and I'll
[1:39:52] go into July but good works it's not
[1:39:54] works brother and that we do is to work
[1:39:57] the righteous of the Christ did and it's
[1:39:59] our faith it is our faith in the
[1:40:02] finished work of Calvary by the grace of
[1:40:04] Almighty God amen recognizing what
[1:40:07] Christ did Amen I'm saying because what
[1:40:10] Christ being brother I turn to this
[1:40:12] visitor this is this is what struck the
[1:40:14] Martin Luther this is what struck John
[1:40:16] Wesley a man it wasn't what they could
[1:40:19] do amen they thought if I do this and I
[1:40:21] do that I'll be sanctified I'll be
[1:40:24] justified and so on but then there was a
[1:40:28] conviction in their heart no you are not
[1:40:30] sanctified you are not just a fight a
[1:40:32] man you do not have that faith of
[1:40:35] sanctification to do not have the faith
[1:40:36] of justification amen
[1:40:39] so in trouble Luther and it troubled
[1:40:41] Wesley and so on today under the stage
[1:40:43] struck him and brother when they're
[1:40:45] faced trunk of a man they they were new
[1:40:48] creatures in Christ they were born again
[1:40:52] because the brother wasn't the the
[1:40:55] the word it was the spirit of the word
[1:40:56] when when when Martin Luther just as I
[1:40:59] said he when he went into that to the
[1:41:01] church and he opened the Bible amen
[1:41:04] because it back then the only Bibles was
[1:41:06] there was in the porch from the Catholic
[1:41:08] Church and he went into the church and
[1:41:10] he over the Bible and he opened it to
[1:41:12] when he opened it it came to man here
[1:41:14] Romans chapter five and he read the
[1:41:17] first verse
[1:41:18] oh man it's revelation the
[1:41:24] Spirit of God led him right to the word
[1:41:27] a man and a and he read the verse
[1:41:30] therefore being justified by faith
[1:41:33] it says we have peace with God through
[1:41:37] our Lord Jesus Christ hey man that's the
[1:41:41] piece that it was a knew that were
[1:41:43] hunkering for that's the piece that
[1:41:45] Luther was searching for and he was he
[1:41:47] was doing works and yeah if I do this if
[1:41:50] I do this they it'll justify me if I do
[1:41:52] that it'll justify this but he never
[1:41:54] found everybody he did it and did it a
[1:41:56] day and still he didn't have peace with
[1:41:58] God
[1:41:59] any man under and I don't know how many
[1:42:02] years maybe it's a number of years that
[1:42:04] he was looking for it
[1:42:05] praying for it calling for it under that
[1:42:08] day that hour that moment that meant at
[1:42:10] that second that he went in and over the
[1:42:12] Bible and read that verse oh and a
[1:42:14] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:42:16] how to Luther and brother when he read
[1:42:18] it and the Holy Ghost struck him and it
[1:42:20] became a revelation in his heart and he
[1:42:23] was born again hallelujah and he picked
[1:42:27] up I guess I said we would call it a pin
[1:42:30] but everybody know that I might have
[1:42:32] been a feather or something and Annie
[1:42:33] wrote right next to that verse he wrote
[1:42:36] alone we are justified by faith alone
[1:42:40] amen and we have peace with God through
[1:42:43] our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:42:46] prese and brother hey what was the piece
[1:42:49] that he was seeking that he was
[1:42:50] justified before God
[1:42:53] Luther signify before God Amen so there
[1:42:56] God gave it to them and he was born
[1:42:58] again it was a revelation not not
[1:43:01] knowledge
[1:43:02] it was a revelation his heart note maybe
[1:43:05] he had read it before but this time a
[1:43:07] buddy was hungry and there's think you
[1:43:10] gotta want it you got you got to know it
[1:43:12] you gotta want it
[1:43:14] hey man sir God God let him this way and
[1:43:16] he went this way went that way I think
[1:43:19] maybe in in any in his natural life that
[1:43:21] Luther might have been a lawyer or
[1:43:23] trained as a lawyer senator I'm not sure
[1:43:25] but he was a very intellectual man and
[1:43:28] so on so brother the the the the letter
[1:43:31] of the word didn't help him the letter
[1:43:32] of the word didn't didn't strike him on
[1:43:36] the line I thought oh they gotta God let
[1:43:38] it go on and on and on
[1:43:40] - Otto the hunger and the thirst for
[1:43:42] justification increase and God is going
[1:43:45] to let it go on and on and on - the
[1:43:47] hunger the curse for the rapture
[1:43:49] increases in the bright Amen to the
[1:43:53] bride wants the rapture the bride wants
[1:43:55] the resurrection the bride wants to go
[1:43:57] home the bride wants to get out of here
[1:44:00] and get needy with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:02] anybody because why because you're sick
[1:44:05] of all this scene you're sick of all
[1:44:07] this unbelief you're sick of this folder
[1:44:10] did this foolishness you're sick of the
[1:44:12] inventions of man anybody because it's
[1:44:15] getting closer and closer are getting
[1:44:17] you further further away from God and
[1:44:18] closer to the devil the probably cause
[1:44:21] that if time goes on and he says science
[1:44:23] these who is God let it go on it's a
[1:44:25] science for break into eternity that's
[1:44:29] right but God's not gonna let him go
[1:44:31] that far
[1:44:32] anyway because the god of this world
[1:44:35] brother the devil he's an eternity
[1:44:37] that's right well brother just think
[1:44:40] this is real God is real the devil is
[1:44:42] real God's angels are real you're to
[1:44:45] sleep even when Daniel who was praying
[1:44:47] for the revelation of the word for it
[1:44:50] for his hour the revelation what God has
[1:44:52] showed him and he I prayed I prayed and
[1:44:55] prayed and prayed for three weeks later
[1:44:57] he was and he was waiting on the answer
[1:44:59] under funny the angel came down anyway
[1:45:02] and now I always said I believe been
[1:45:04] praying for a long time yes he said and
[1:45:06] the angels were sent down but the devil
[1:45:08] was there in his angels to try and
[1:45:10] prevent them from getting to Daniel Amen
[1:45:12] and brother is at the dead
[1:45:14] angels are there to prevent God's angels
[1:45:17] forgetting down to Daniel they're there
[1:45:20] to prevent God's angels from getting to
[1:45:21] you a man sure they sure is Satan is
[1:45:26] their brother so we're praying the grace
[1:45:28] of God the Bible says the angels of God
[1:45:30] in camps around about those that fear
[1:45:33] the Lord hey man so pray the grace of
[1:45:36] God that the angels of God recant been
[1:45:37] around about you and me amen the Kiva's
[1:45:40] separated unto the Lord for the greater
[1:45:43] revelation the greater revelation don't
[1:45:45] we come to that perfect pain any man the
[1:45:47] others here for the resurrection of the
[1:45:49] rapture anything Jesus went on and on
[1:45:52] and on and on and on on to finally a man
[1:45:55] he got quiet on the finally he stopped
[1:45:58] the signs and wonders they stopped the
[1:46:00] preaching a man and then and he just a
[1:46:04] just went in any ayah praise the Lord
[1:46:06] who and he was on his way to Jerusalem
[1:46:08] and he went to this did this city and he
[1:46:10] went to this well where he was he was
[1:46:12] only focusing on the predestinated seat
[1:46:15] he was only focusing on the elect of God
[1:46:18] he wasn't going to go out there and
[1:46:20] preach to the world no more no no no he
[1:46:22] was going to focus on anybody focus on
[1:46:25] those are they appear to be decimated
[1:46:27] see and he may met that woman at the
[1:46:29] well and the disciples wouldn't go there
[1:46:32] because they're because of what she was
[1:46:34] guilty off and so on baby but she was a
[1:46:36] seed of God anyway the prophet of God
[1:46:39] said we're not going to reach everyone
[1:46:41] with this message he's a just the bride
[1:46:44] just the elect predestinated with the
[1:46:47] rapture in the resurrection but garthe's
[1:46:49] got somebody out there is going to
[1:46:50] witness to the world concerning the Lord
[1:46:52] Jesus Christ amen but they're not bride
[1:46:55] we got to understand that we believe
[1:46:58] that we are married that God called the
[1:47:00] Prophet to call of the brine God sent
[1:47:04] the problem with a message to separate
[1:47:05] the bride a man for the resurrection
[1:47:08] rapture as eventually back there 2,000
[1:47:12] years ago the bridegroom was separated
[1:47:14] for what he was ordained to do
[1:47:17] amen so the bridegroom the bride is now
[1:47:20] separated for what she's ordained to do
[1:47:23] and that's the resurrection and the
[1:47:24] rapture
[1:47:25] the prophet of God said the Raider the
[1:47:28] God's waiting on us he said the
[1:47:30] residence of the dead in Christ are
[1:47:31] waiting on us he said for the
[1:47:33] resurrection amen
[1:47:35] godly is for the rapture and the change
[1:47:38] of our body
[1:47:39] he has come down a man in the Ministry
[1:47:43] of Malachi for in the OB of the seven
[1:47:45] seals in the third Pole it was the
[1:47:47] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:47:49] clouds amen oh it's not just a cloud of
[1:47:52] angels they were with Jesus a man there
[1:47:57] were there were there was an angel come
[1:47:59] down to reveal to Daniel Daniel there
[1:48:01] what did the revelation he was seeking
[1:48:03] the understanding that he that he wanted
[1:48:05] a man hey there are other angels that
[1:48:08] came with him and why do dare to fight
[1:48:11] the devil off just think if the Angels
[1:48:13] had to fight the devil what are you and
[1:48:14] I got to do a man
[1:48:19] brother let's realize God is real yeah
[1:48:21] even a God is really did this he did
[1:48:23] this but it's understand true that the
[1:48:25] devil is real
[1:48:26] a man Shane this real just say your
[1:48:30] seeds Jesus Jesus saw him and Jesus
[1:48:33] talked to him face-to-face he died to
[1:48:36] Jesus face-to-face any man on the Mount
[1:48:41] of temptation if you are the son of God

[1:57:46] pray God all this brother sister we
[1:57:48] commit him to the Lord and move on by
[1:57:50] the grace of God amen

[1:58:06] yeah they weren't only nothing against
[1:58:09] us
[1:58:09] so brother-sister but the message
[1:58:12] apparently the message is not for them
[1:58:14] she listens if your little elected seed
[1:58:17] if your predestinated seed we don't have
[1:58:20] to gluten fight you we don't have to
[1:58:23] fight you to get you to believe the
[1:58:25] message we don't go to argue with it it
[1:58:27] gets you believe the message if you're a
[1:58:29] Prius a seat you're gonna oh oh praise
[1:58:32] the Lord that's good uh yeah I believe
[1:58:34] that that's right that's the word yeah
[1:58:37] but now the others out there God - gonna
[1:58:41] deal with them as he had the deal with
[1:58:43] lot and his family gonna deal with them
[1:58:46] in a little different way - yet did they
[1:58:47] had that battle but brother when that
[1:58:49] angel they are God Almighty God in flesh
[1:58:52] talking to Abraham no problem
[1:58:56] anybody's word abraham believed his word
[1:58:59] anybody and intercede for a lot doing it
[1:59:04] or see for those that were done in Sodom
[1:59:07] and Gomorrah oh there's going to be this
[1:59:09] many there will you destroy it no he
[1:59:10] said I want if there's this many buddy
[1:59:13] destroy it no I want on down to ten five
[1:59:17] if there's this many no I won't destroy
[1:59:19] it but he's the messengers for there and
[1:59:22] do what and and there was less than what
[1:59:25] Abraham had set sail and the angels
[1:59:29] brought them out amen and brother as I
[1:59:33] say oh thank god oh thank God for the
[1:59:35] word brother as he said if there's if he
[1:59:38] says a certain time to be no flesh state
[1:59:40] maybe it didn't shorten time in Sodom
[1:59:43] and Gomorrah
[1:59:44] then we know Sublette no flesh saved
[1:59:45] that's right and just thinking even in
[1:59:49] the days of Noah there's only there's
[1:59:51] only no on his family and not all them
[1:59:54] were predestinated not all them were

[2:00:02] of the the ark God and he went on into
[2:00:06] sin God cut him off he must have a
[2:00:10] surface heat that's right the pilot of
[2:00:14] God said he said the seat of God can
[2:00:17] give birth to a serpent seed

[2:02:14] significant quotes in the rapture
[2:02:16] oh yeah so brother listen let's be on
[2:02:20] our guard let's be on our toes this
[2:02:22] experience reminded us so we're not
[2:02:24] going to miss the revelation of the
[2:02:26] rapture amen many are going to miss it
[2:02:30] like you're like it's like you said it's
[2:02:32] in the scriptures
[2:02:33] where's the rapture it already happened
[2:02:35] you didn't know it just what it having
[2:02:39] you didn't know it
[2:02:40] why what do you mean I didn't know what
[2:02:41] I knew what God and then maybe they
[2:02:44] would say I knew God sent Malachi for I
[2:02:46] knew the seven seals are open I knew
[2:02:48] this I knew that yeah but you didn't go
[2:02:51] on to the perfect faith of the rapture
[2:02:54] you had to go on to perfect faith for
[2:02:57] the rapture
[2:02:59] god help us brother we need he preached
[2:03:05] it August I believe 63 preached it that
[2:03:10] we need perfect thing for the rapture
[2:03:13] and he said it means a lot of breaking
[2:03:16] shaking down a lot of shaking down for
[2:03:20] you and me but people don't want that
[2:03:23] kind of preaching people just just focus
[2:03:27] on this just focus on that
[2:03:28] you know impersonal that's all doctrinal
[2:03:33] no brother God's doing something so
[2:03:37] God's going to focus on us
[2:03:41] hey man it's the resurrection rapture
[2:03:44] not religion no he wants to something he
[2:03:48] wants to do so we got to focus on us by
[2:03:52] grace brother he focused on Noah Noah oh
[2:03:56] thank god no I walk with God he not walk
[2:04:01] with God was raptured and that's what
[2:04:03] God's looking looking for and you and me
[2:04:05] walk with God me man and why because God
[2:04:11] is in full control what makes what makes
[2:04:15] that person live like that why did he do
[2:04:18] this what did he do that
[2:04:19] well it's God that's walking in them and
[2:04:21] they're headed for the rapture hey man
[2:04:25] now Noah God walk with Him but I tell
[2:04:28] you brother he believed God because God
[2:04:32] asked him to do something that was crazy
[2:04:33] in the eyes of the world he did it amen
[2:04:37] he prophesied things that they'd never
[2:04:39] seen before this was going to happen
[2:04:42] this is going to happen and he would
[2:04:43] have built the ark them him and his
[2:04:45] family and so on
[2:04:46] well praise the Lord I remember a film
[2:04:49] one time they filmed it about Noah
[2:04:52] building the ark and all that and they
[2:04:54] were having a supper they went inside
[2:04:56] and Noah's wife had supper and she said
[2:04:58] - oh she said I'm wondering - and Noah
[2:05:02] and so what are you worried about she
[2:05:06] said well she said what are we gonna put
[2:05:09] over over all she said when the rain
[2:05:11] comes because back then they never had
[2:05:15] the how was it like we have today and so
[2:05:17] on because they never had no rain that's
[2:05:20] right they lived in tents the prophet of
[2:05:23] God said who built ours who started
[2:05:25] building houses he said was King yeah
[2:05:28] others lived lived in - lived in caves
[2:05:32] of the earth and so on but it was Cain
[2:05:35] that went out started to build houses
[2:05:36] they would haven't started builders they
[2:05:39] were they were getting turning after
[2:05:41] after this this this group this culture
[2:05:44] and that culture and they started to
[2:05:46] build houses here and I already did
[2:05:51] Esau maybe and so on but so brothers
[2:05:55] sister don't copy the world whatever God
[2:05:59] wants you to have be content that's like
[2:06:04] I said this is tremendous him a tent or
[2:06:07] a cottage why should I care but I said
[2:06:12] people do here yeah they do they
[2:06:17] certainly don't want to ten a lot don't
[2:06:19] want a cottage do you want to mention
[2:06:22] god help us brother in st. lous Gospel
[2:06:27] chapter 4 and verse 1 and B in Jesus
[2:06:35] being full of the Holy Ghost well the
[2:06:38] Holy Ghost was made flesh in him
[2:06:40] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[2:06:45] spirit into the wilderness follow God's
[2:06:49] leadership but the people want the
[2:06:54] pleasures of this world more than they
[2:06:56] want the wilderness of the will of God
[2:07:00] being forty days tempted of the devil
[2:07:03] and in those days he didn't eat nothing
[2:07:08] and when they were handed he afterward
[2:07:13] hungered amen brother Bob made reference
[2:07:18] to the bread and the devil said unto him
[2:07:23] if thou be the Son of God command this
[2:07:27] stone that it be made bread if you're
[2:07:33] the son of God well you can do this you
[2:07:35] can do this you can have this you can
[2:07:36] have that and jesus answered him saying
[2:07:41] it is written that man shall not live by
[2:07:46] bread alone amen you're not going to
[2:07:49] live by the natural things of life but
[2:07:52] most people are looking for the natural
[2:07:54] things of life working for the natural
[2:07:55] things of life focusing on the natural
[2:07:57] things of life amen but what would the
[2:08:01] spiritual grace he said man shall not
[2:08:07] live by bread alone but by every word
[2:08:11] every word now God holds us responsible
[2:08:15] for every word a man for every
[2:08:20] generation he held them responsible for
[2:08:22] every word up to that hour up to that
[2:08:24] point now look at the word he's almost
[2:08:27] responsible for the end just saying
[2:08:37] concerning his ministry the end of his
[2:08:41] ministry nearing the third pole of his
[2:08:42] ministry they said Lord what are the
[2:08:44] signs of the coming and one of the
[2:08:49] greatest signs is deception take heed
[2:08:53] that no man deceive you because he would
[2:08:56] deceive he said the very elect please be
[2:09:00] on your guard
[2:09:01] spiritually give God preeminence not the
[2:09:07] world not your flesh not this life but
[2:09:11] the world to come
[2:09:12] call it Elvis man shall not live by
[2:09:17] bread alone the natural things of life
[2:09:19] but by every word of God the spiritual
[2:09:23] you got it what you do you you're gonna
[2:09:27] feel little the Lord to do it you're
[2:09:30] gonna be you're gonna be led by the
[2:09:31] spirit sons and daughters of God led by
[2:09:34] the Spirit of God and they're walking in
[2:09:36] the spirit they're living in the spirit
[2:09:37] by the grace of God it's not how to
[2:09:40] remember the the prophet of God said you
[2:09:42] can have the you can have the Holy Ghost
[2:09:43] on you 24 hours a day and he said then
[2:09:47] go to hell why because you don't have
[2:09:51] the Holy Ghost in you yeah and he said
[2:09:56] the person can be healed and go to hell
[2:09:58] that's true because that's all they're
[2:10:01] believing but brother the Bride of
[2:10:03] Christ not my will father oh oh brother
[2:10:08] what a trouble what lay ahead
[2:10:10] he said not my will but thine be done
[2:10:13] and knowing what lays ahead for the
[2:10:15] bride how many it's really really
[2:10:17] honestly from their hearts you're gonna
[2:10:18] say Lord not my will don't be done as I
[2:10:25] said at eight or a college an engineer
[2:10:30] or a janitor why should I care
[2:10:34] I'll led to be honest I just did what
[2:10:37] God wanted me to do I was a janitor -
[2:10:41] that's right and I was a cook and there
[2:10:45] was a time when I worked in a certain
[2:10:46] store and and III when I know I used to
[2:10:51] have gluten bringing those buddy-cop
[2:10:55] those carts and you did I said oh yeah I
[2:11:00] did

[2:11:16] brother
[2:11:19] the janitor yes janitor but again like I
[2:11:25] said I never took breaks or anything
[2:11:26] like that I always wondered why they did
[2:11:30] I told you at the time I was working I
[2:11:34] went in took a break and and two of the
[2:11:39] two managers who were there at the time

[2:11:47] break I said well I just come in and see
[2:11:51] what it felt like I said everybody has
[2:11:54] to can't wait I said to get into a break
[2:11:55] in the morning can't wait to get a break
[2:11:57] in the afternoon so I said I said what
[2:12:00] does it feel like so I said just come
[2:12:01] and see what it felt like I said I don't
[2:12:03] need it
[2:12:04] I said I said I'm not using a pick and a
[2:12:07] shovel I saw only using a pen I'm only
[2:12:12] using this or that or something else I
[2:12:13] said I don't need a break but that's the
[2:12:16] world we live in
[2:12:17] yeah brother you if you're there to take
[2:12:20] breaks like that well I tell you Jesus
[2:12:24] never took a break and when it comes to
[2:12:25] breaking like that he did say come aside
[2:12:28] and rest awhile but considering the
[2:12:31] spirit that was did the the burden that
[2:12:33] was on Jesus he needed the rest but when
[2:12:36] it comes to the burden of a lot of work
[2:12:37] today
[2:12:38] you don't need wrong you don't need no
[2:12:39] break no no and it's like like I was
[2:12:42] told they said they said mr. loss or a
[2:12:45] journal they says it's amazing but you
[2:12:48] know David they agree with me they said
[2:12:50] and they said this was just one there
[2:12:52] that you're working with it yeah they

[2:13:27] with this I gotta go
[2:13:28] cuz
[2:13:31] and I was endeavoring to bring it out
[2:13:33] but never got to it on last service I
[2:13:37] was ministering on job eternal life
[2:13:41] death and eternal life God asked Joe
[2:13:45] where were you when I laid the
[2:13:46] foundations of the earth and the morning
[2:13:50] stars sang together the sons of God
[2:13:51] shouted for joy but when God laid the
[2:13:56] foundations of the earth the morning
[2:13:57] stars sang together and the sons of God
[2:14:00] shouted for joy
[2:14:03] where were you Joe well Joe got the
[2:14:06] revelation he was there a man and
[2:14:10] originals and what happened in the
[2:14:13] Garden of Eden he bypassed his theophany
[2:14:16] and he came forth in flesh but he was
[2:14:19] going to go back to his theophany in the
[2:14:21] presence of God again amen and wait for
[2:14:24] a glorified body and maybe he's already
[2:14:28] got the glorified body when Jesus rose
[2:14:30] from the dead and the Saints arose went
[2:14:35] into the city appeared to many amen then
[2:14:37] when Jesus went up they went up amen
[2:14:39] because the because they you know did
[2:14:42] they go up yeah because when they got
[2:14:44] outside the city they said open up the
[2:14:46] everlasting gates let the King of glory
[2:14:48] come in and the angels were saying King
[2:14:52] of glory who's the King of glory and
[2:14:55] they said the Lord strong and mighty
[2:14:58] mighty in battle they said he is the
[2:15:01] king of glory so the gates opened not
[2:15:05] opened up and the Lord no doubt their
[2:15:07] directors Saints of the old testament
[2:15:10] winning with him praise the Lord
[2:15:12] hallelujah well Elijah and so are Elijah
[2:15:18] or the others that were resurrected in
[2:15:21] the Old Testament they were already
[2:15:22] there a man but waiting for a glorified
[2:15:25] body so brother we come from eternity we
[2:15:29] got subject to death we by pastor our
[2:15:32] theophanies and what word that were
[2:15:34] going back to eternity we're coming back
[2:15:37] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost were
[2:15:39] put put in contact with our theophany
[2:15:41] and there's pulling us into eternity by
[2:15:44] the grace of God into a glorified body
[2:15:46] and that comes by way of the rapture as
[2:15:50] it was 2,000 years ago for the Jews so
[2:15:54] it is now for the Gentiles the grace of
[2:15:56] God be with us brother amen so we'll get
