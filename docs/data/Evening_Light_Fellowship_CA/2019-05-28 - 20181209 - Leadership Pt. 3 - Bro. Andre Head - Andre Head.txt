said to the angel Gabriel after he visited her and spoke of the prophecy that had been made by Isaiah and every Prophet Lord who began to speak of your coming be it unto us Lord amen and then father Mary receiving this word brought by an Angel amen heard the word being troubled in her heart pondering these things hearing that she was the one yes that the prophecy had come to the predestinated plan of God before the foundation of the world when Isaiah Cried Out Behold a virgin shall cons receive didn't even know what he was saying Lord but under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that moved upon men of old and they wrote the word as they were moved upon you by your great Holy Spirit father Hallelujah and then Lord your Prophet told us Lord in Mary's belief Lord that the priest read that same scripture the day before about the coming of the word and her heart began to to warm she began to ponder and think upon these things amen and then the next day going to get water lord brother brandham said that the angel Gabriel St stepped out of the eternity and said fear not oh Lord how thankful we are that there is another lady virgin in this hour Lord who have received the same word Supernatural word father that can transform us Lord and bring us into your image Lord amen and father we have heard Lord the hearing of the ear Lord but now we see Lord and father how thankful we are Lord that you prepared the ground of our hearts Lord nothing that we stumbled into nothing that we made ourselves Lord but father your word came to us amen and we heard that word as you said behold I send you Elijah the prophet and father that word struck our hearts a word Lord that would change us and take us from all stations of Life Lord and we heard you say come follow me hallelujah oh Lord then be it unto us Lord according to your word yes amen and may the faith of Jesus Christ and the virtue of Jesus Christ Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness Lord and may the sealing Angel the great Holy Ghost seal us as one unit Lord amen and father the great headstone that has United and capped us Lord in this hour may it speak Lord and may we speak father we ask these things Lord you know every heart of everyone in here this morning Lord here we are being brought into your presence with Thanksgiving and Praises unto you Lord Lord putting the things of the world put pushing them to the side Lord and concentrating on you consecrating ourselves Lord coming Lord with humility Lord holy reverence before you father oh Lord by the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ father then we stand here by your word this morning Lord your word has brought us into your presence Lord by a New and Living Way that has been consecrated that is beyond the the veil of Flesh Lord and so father we pray Lord that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation Lord father that our the senses of our soul which is Faith Lord would look up to your word father and understand Lord as our sister song Lord that you've always been there with us and you're with us here Lord may we see those our Supernatural eyes be open Lord to your presence Lord to your word father that you're fulfilled heing in our hearts Lord and so father we are so thankful Lord to be in your presence Lord we're so thankful for this lovely congregation Lord that were predestinated ordained Lord have taken up their place Lord in this hour we thank you for our wonderful Pastor Lord Brother Lush Lord Brother Gerald Lord who been so kind Lord who's in you called many many years ago Lord how you have directed him and ordered his steps Lord Lord redeem man ordained to take this word father we thank you for him Lord pray that you'll bless everyone in the house this morning Lord with your presence come and have your way Lord be it unto us Lord according to your word father we ask all these things believing that we have them because we ask them according to your word and in the name of our wonderful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you this morning it's certainly good to be in the presence of the Lord good to see you with those Holy Ghost Smiles on this morning thank you Lord happy and worshiping and praising the Lord in the Holy Ghost and we just thankful we uh just enjoying the worship we've been telling brother Bob that he is the most anointed song leader I believe in the message amen and very consecrated and we thank the Lord we've just had some wonderful Fellowship they they have taken good care of us and we've had some great great fellowship and look forward to a few more days of that Fellowship I didn't I didn't uh notice brother Gus daughter last night and God bless you we had wonderful fellowship with brother Gus there in Central and I asked my wife last night I said what I believe that was brother Gus's daughter she said yes that's right and so God bless you and how we appreciate you all we I didn't know if Brother Don was going to give us a special this morning uh brother I remember in Genesis when God called Abraham he said not only will I bless you I will make you a blessing and so we always want to be a blessing to the household of faith and be led by that and so we heard that brother Chad had called this morning didn't not you know we appreciate that he called this morning it didn't even M it didn't matter matter who picked up the phone he just said Supernatural I but he he called our precious brother and said uh we're looking for a great Supernatural uh service this morning and so well you brought that Supernatural with you that Holy Ghost lives in your heart dwells in your heart and when you come through that door he came through with you when you got in your car this morning he was there with you amen he said I'll never leave you why because he's been birth in you everywhere you go every place you're at he's right there in you with you leading you guiding us and he's making us more and more conscious to the reality that the Holy Ghost is leading us into as brother brandom says you you have become from a being of time to a being of Eternity when that word of God has lit our souls and so how grateful and thankful we are for that well if you have your Bibles this morning we'll get into this precious word we're going to open up in First Peter chapter 5 and we're going to read a little bit this morning to you and see how the Lord would just lead us and guide us amen amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus we're going to read First Peter chapter 5 and then we'll we'll be seated and then we'll turn over to Romans chapter 8 and how thankful we are for the leadership of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives it's kind of been a theme Here on uh we've been ministering on those things for a while that the Lord has given us I don't go looking for something to minister on we just lay before the Lord and see just get quiet sometimes in the study back home I have my own office there at the church and sometimes when I go uh because I don't work full-time now the brothers who do work full-time do I work but I don't work full-time so what I do is on my regular days uh when I'm not working with different ones or I don't have anything because the brothers go to work then I get up early in the morning about 6:30 or 7 go to the church go in the office there and pray and study because they're out working I don't just want to be there just sitting I want to be working and praying for each one of them I have a list because we don't have about 40 Believers in the church so every morning I go there first thing we sing praising him to the Lord then I get that list out and I pray for each and every one each individual that's my job as a minister and I don't want to see not one believer in our church left in the tribulation I want them to be in the Rapture but if they're not in the Rapture I want them to be saved I don't want a single person in our congregation to ever be lost and I don't I don't want that for you either you see we take these things serious you know we're we're not playing Church we've come to the reality of God and you were called before the foundation of the world the same one that said let there be let there be and there was and there was that's the same one who has come in this hour for his own good purpose Amen to to express himself in your hearts in our lives and so how thankful you all have your own experiences and your own testimonies and those experiences and testimonies they lead us higher and higher and higher on the word and so a lot of times when I'm just waiting on the Lord there I'll go into that study and I just don't get there and say okay okay when sometimes I've got a couch in the office there I'll just sit on the end of the couch kind of meditate I've got our precious sister Marin's CD there we play that sometimes sometimes I'll fall asleep at the end of the couch then I'll wake up and say well Lord here I am and then read my scripture go home and and then maybe come set days and days and then something will start speaking to my heart amen and so for 24 years being in the ministry we I learned I used to get real you know nervous and those things but I learned to try to relax and let the Holy Spirit have his way and stuff found God he's not in a hurry he's not under pressure maybe I'm not prepared but he's always prepared so it's like brother Brown said it's what we yield ourselves to and so we thank the Lord for that amen aren't you glad to be a Christian aren't you glad to be the bride in the bride age with the promises that God has given us amen not didn't mean to keep you standing but I guess everybody should be over at First Peter chapter 5 and we're going to start at verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time amen casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be VI Vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stab Lish strengthen settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy and precious words you may be seated let's turn over to uh Romans chapter 8 we see Paul with this exhortation speaking to the believer that that we we have to go through these afflictions and trials that the glory of God may be accomplished in our lives Amen Brother brandham Talks of it being elective love because God's love is not humanistic love it's God's love and God's love leads us to Perfection and understanding it establishes Us in the faith it brings us through great trials but he is perfecting us and we must go through the fire amen and then through the water that is brother Matthew bringing those things out to us the Refiner's Fire to purify us to purge us to bring us into his own image by his word and you know we don't give ourselves Temptations and trials if I had to give myself a trial or Temptation it'd be something very easy that wouldn't take too much out of me but God he knows how to put us into pressure and you've heard it mentioned before you know you take an orange and and you squeeze that orange you're going to get orange juice you're not going to squeeze an orange and get an Apple out of that you're not going to get apple juice and so we see when Christ was squeezed and he was put to the pressure it brought forth the Divine love of God you see and so you and I God creating his own own nature in us when we're squeezed is going to bring forth the very nature of Christ we're not going to bring forth anything contrary to God's word amen because the Holy Ghost who is building you up into Christ he's trying these virtues in your heart he is building these things these things these characteristics and virtues of Christ he's solidifying those things in our heart that when we go through trial and situations we're being built up into him we know how to handle the circumstances because perfect Faith teaches us that perfect Faith you know who you are and what you've been raised up to do raised up I don't mean just somebody lifting you up like that you have your children you raise your children you teach them you instruct them that's what I mean by raising up and the Holy Ghost raises us up in Jesus Christ teaches us tutors us he shows us how to handle because we are his children see and because we bypass our theophany the word and we come here to be tried and tested and to be built in His image then as we said there won't be anyone standing in the resurrection morning that doesn't have a testimony of how that they overcome in the age that they lived in and brother brandom says it's not what you overcome but how you overcome and we know that that overcoming is by the word being made spirit and life in our own lives so if if if I'm being led by the Holy Spirit then I would maybe if I wanted to try to impress someone maybe I would say you know I'm not going you know everything's just move for me and and going fine well that's all right but when the Holy Ghost leads us he takes us through some awful hard trials takes us through some real roads to go through real climbs there are mountains we must climb and there are valleys and situation circumstances I remember when brother Billy Paul many years ago he came down to mon Georgia and I'm originally from Georgia city called Marietta Georgia and uh the voice of God they were doing a wonderful tour it was called catch the vision tour in the United States and they had the bus and they were visiting cities and they came to mon Georgia and there's a wonderful Pastor in that area uh I can't think of his name now shame on me but he has a church in Perry Georgia I'll think of him in a little bit his his name but uh brother yansy brother David yansy and uh so brother the the the bus was there and brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph brandham they were just it was just a wonderful time and uh so brother Billy Paul that he had the service that night of course he's not a preacher he's just testifying and he said you know uh everybody wanted to hear the different testimonies and we all do it just builds us up in the faith and things like that and him being there with uh brother brandham and seeing so many great Ma Miracles and and you could you can just imagine him right there he was the one giving out the prayer cards and watching the angel of the Lord come down and do all these things and he said you know brother Billy Paul said you know out of everything that the the I was humbled and privileged by the grace of the Lord to see he said the greatest thing that impressed me about my father was he mastered every circumstance says it didn't matter what he went through and he went through many things he said he was put out you don't know how he would hug up to a person knowing that the person didn't even like him and care about him because he could see the lives of people and and how the denominations would tell people he's want to be here but he wasn't there to bring in money all kind of stuff that brother brandham knew all this was going on Amen and yet with the love of God and the character of God he could have just come out and just blasted everybody but he didn't amen because he understood the leadership of the Holy Spirit you see and so brother Billy Paul said what what really really impress me about my father is that he could master anything that came before him he mastered that circumstance that always impacted my heart because God has privileged me to see Miracles and many wonderful things and I thank the Lord for even in my own life but to have but to know that God is raising me to master the circumstances by the word amen to know that my experiences are not schooled something schooled into me as brother brandham says in the message Satan's Eden your experiences are not something that schooled into you it's predestinated by the hand of God Amen and so knowing these things knowing these things knowing these things then we're not ignorant of what we have to go through and the trials and that God permits because when it comes to his bride and anything Satan doesn't have a free flow at the bride we see that in the Book of Job and the different ones amen God gives him permission for these trials and things like that brother brandham he talks of the sh of of the shepherd and the sheep and how that in the Eastern custom they have their Corrals and the shepherd leads the Sheep into that Corral many of them are made of stone but in front there's a door and you know it's not a door like we open it's the shepherd brother Brom taught us those things and Jesus taught us those things so that when the Sheep are put into the Corral for the night or for whatever situation they're uh in that Corral and there's only way only one way in and one way out and that's right by the door and that's where the shepherd lays down right there nothing can go out and nothing can come in unless it passes through him you see so so when we when we hear the word are we really hearing the word are we really understanding that your life has been predestinated by the hand of God and the situations that may come God has permitted these things or he doesn't have control at all you see so so the knowledge and the understanding and the wisdom of God it brings a maturity in you and I that would just not just stumbling from one thing stumbling and how did this happen what brought this no no no no we know God has permitted these things then we understand this is a reaction to the action amen and God is teaching us and showing us these things so I've seen people around the message they've been in meage 50 years and they still haven't matured to understand what is going on in their lives surprise surprise you know it shouldn't be like that that's right we know who we are we know our enemy and what we're fighting maybe maybe the the maybe the enemy comes in like a flood but the scripture says then in in Isaiah 59 then God raises up the standard and the standard is the Holy Ghost leadership in you that has God ain't given you trials and hadn't brought you to an understanding you see he perits these things after he has taught us you know as a child your parents they I hadn't even read my scripture yet you know God bless you you know as a child it's just a wonderful spirit here as a child you know my parents they would teach me don't do this do this don't do this do this don't do this and after a while you know they'd say well don't hang around with this boy down the street or wherever I lived in the country but mile away there were some kids and my dad said look you don't need to be hanging around them boys because this that but before he ever told me not to do something he's already instilled in me strength and what's right what you shouldn't do what you should do he don't just say well get out there and go at it and whatever happens come back and let me know no no no no he teaching me son don't be lying that's a bad thing don't lie okay Daddy I won't lie don't be stealing either boy we don't steal we work okay Daddy so so daddy already instilling things in me amen so that when I go into the store and I see a toy said man I know my mom and dad ain't got no money for that but I can just put it in my jacket like this and take it home but there's something in me saying that ain't your you ain't got no money you going to have to wait a Christmas to Santa Claus come I'm your mom and daddy but what I'm saying is has God been insing has God been putting his virtue into you and I has he really been building himself up into us or we just trying to hang on to it you know when brother brandham had lost his wife hope and Sharon Rose there and then after the flood there of uh the great Ohio flood there he was I don't know how long after this was but brother Brown said he was walking down the road and I don't know if it was the mayor of the sheriff they said bill I don't know how you do it he said what do you mean sir he said I don't know how you can keep your religion and the times and the things that you've been through I don't know how you could keep it he said I didn't sir it kept me amen amen so Lord so when we begin to hear God speaking through his message and begin to meditate and not just well I heard that message and I heard this message and and uh you hear what brother Brown said on that well that's fine but are these things are they becoming us are they be are they you have to ask yourself am I becoming this am I just is this memorization or am I really am I really becoming what I'm hearing and by changed from glory to glory so we find ourselves in this hour we're not at a time where we just want to run over the word of God we want to examine ourselves we want to look into the mirror of God's word amise the Lord and as our pastor was saying the other day we know what the requirements are in this hour as we said um as we said the other night when you ask about going in the Rapture yes I'm waiting maybe tonight I'm going in the Rapture I'm going in the Rapture then you ask well are there any requirements well you know just to believe brother Brandon that's the requirement well yeah that's right but it's it's more requirements to that we got to be built up into the statue of a perfect man amen you see I mean there's requirements for these things not just you know well praise God we're going to be flying off one day or go to another dimension well that's fine I'm not knocking any of that y all understand that right but I'm just saying we got to examine our lives by the scripture and see if what the word for this hour if that is being built up in me amen amen if that's been built up in me and I'm walking in that light then I know light comes from the word of this hour amen and the Holy Ghost is going to lead me to the promise of this hour right he see that's right that's the leadership that we must look in ourselves and say is that now Lord forgive me because I was down in the study this morning and I saw the brother had come so I don't want anyone to think I would ever attack any of God's Ministry I never do that but I must be honest with you so I saw the the title of the messages and things I thought man well that's good but listen brother and sisters if we still at the point where we got to teach each other to be kind and be nice to one another bro we we done got left behind that's right that's right that's the truth amen I got I've been in the message 27 years and I got to tell somebody got to come to me and say look brother Andre you need to be kind to people and stop this and that and this and that well that's all right but if if 27 years in my experience with the Holy Ghost under a vindicative message like this and I still got to try to be kind to somebody brother Lord Lord please don't come now see that's the infancy of the Bride that's right amen so we're not in the infancy of the Bride we're in the rapturing age amen where Divine love has been that all these work by Divine love divine love is what build that faith and virtue knowledge Temperance that's Divine love that's the headstone building you up into himself amen so those are just Elementary things I wanted to say but we have to examine ourselves by the word we don't want any disappointments like brother Brown said the old negro man Moos he said uh he said when I get down to the Jordan I just want to give him my token and just cross on over I don't want no problems then amen amen so we want to examine we don't want no problems here at this end time we want to just be right with the word if as we said the other night if there's complexes or habits or things in our life people think CU you go to church you ain't got no problems like they go to church so they ain't got no problem they just lit living in a you know a flowery bed of ease what what if you serving God you fighting battles so people just just having the mindset that well if you go to church everything ly doy you on a big picnic just think the children of Israel when they crossed over the Jordan River there and God had told them you're going to go to a a land that flows with milk and honey and God promised Abraham this and no doubt they would rehearse that man we'll leave Egypt we're going to a land that's flowing with milk and honey and then Joshua and Caleb come back with the evidence of the land those grapes and things and and the people think man look at the big cluster of grapes and and strawberries and raspberries and dates and all those uh fruits that grow in the Middle East and they probably thought man what a land this is and probably some of thought man well when I get over in my land I'm just G to hang my hammock and just let the Lord just keep feeding me like he's been feeding me all these years I'm just going to hang my hammock and just sing uh oh I want to see him and and but then when they got over there joshu thought about look y'all going to have to fight fight we thought God yeah and and and we ain't getting no that bread that's been falling we going to have to eat the old corn now we going to have to plant and some of you born in the wilderness and you ain't been circumcised pull out the knives you're going to get circumcised now because you're in a new promised land now amen so going into that they had to be circumcised they had to been be taught how to fight rais them up God raising them up showing them how to fight and Caleb and them already knowing how to fight it wasn't an easy thing but they knew they had a promise Caleb said as it was in my heart he had a revelation he was of a different Spirit just think he had been he had come out with all of them and those two million were brother R said only two went into the promised land this man the God said to Moses he said Moses these two men Joshua and Caleb they will go into the land because they are of a different spirit amen can imagine all those people there two million people when they first went down into Egypt 70 Souls but over 400 some years 70 had multiplied to over 2 million people amen and when God by a mighty hand went down to deliver them just like you're walking today just like many in the briad today were going into the promise can you imagine God saying of all of these only these two because they are a different spirit amen that'd be an incredible thing right so you got to examine your own lives by the word and ask yourself am I of a different Spirit than just a religious spirit that's around the message and and people into this and and all kind of spirits you got to ask yourself what has the word of God built in me you got to do that you see you got to look in that mirror and you say well I got frailties and things that ain't got nothing to do with it you you can't never perfect the flesh so you you keep your eyes on the word the word will do what it said it would do and faith in God's word you see so you so don't let the devil just CU you might be going through hard times and people you say well people see I'm going through hard times well praise God you're going through hard times amen because God has permitted you and he's giving you a test and in the message how can I overcome brother brand said the greatest thing that God can give you not talking about the Holy Ghost is a test and that test is to prove your faith you see he knows it he knows everything that great intelligence he knows it all you see but what do you know you see what is coming out of your heart what are you seeing that is being reflected because as the prophet of God said you are reflecting what you are in another dimension and that's that theophany you see and so I didn't mean to get started like that but the the Holy Ghost knows what he's doing a amen where we at Romans chapter 8 and then we got to go Romans chapter I just want to thank that brother for taking the clot down last night that was a uh uh a Act of Valor there I hope nobody said anything negative to him if they did count it all joy I know they wouldn't I I know this group of believers they love the word Romans chapter 8 so we're still talking about this leadership uh by the grace and the mercy of the Lord and let's let's look into this word now Romans chapter 8 ver14 I love this book of the whole the whole Bible and Romans 8 is certainly very very special there I mean the Apostle Paul he starts out in Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ and then when he gets to the end of Romans chapter 8 around verse 38 and 39 he said I am persuaded that nothing can separate you from the love of God that's the same chapter where he says if God be for you who can be against you it's the same chapter where he says who can bring to charge to God's elect it is God that justifi you see amen wonderful scripture and so we see here in Romans chapter 8 verse4 for as many as are led by the spirit of God God they are the sons of God and so we know the leadership of the Holy Ghost is taking us somewhere we're not just being led in circles we're not as brother Brown preached that message turn northward and how thankful we are that we're not just marching and going in circles brother Brown talked about in the message God when he was in the ater rondak mountains there in New York and his wife he was on his honeymoon and his wife Ma and Billy Paul was there at the cabin there and he wanted to get his hunt and there he was and it was snowing the the the darkness was falling in the evening time and brother Brandon who was a great God he even in that message of God he goes into minute details of how if you're in the wilderness to uh uh know uh north south east and west and to know directions he goes into that meticulously in that message and then he gets to a place and say you know then I found myself on the ending Death March I was lost in circles walking in circles think of that think you've been in the message so long just walking in circles and you and you see no growth and you realize man what's going on here I don't want to be in the ending Death March we don't want to be walking in circles we want to be climbing higher and higher and higher under the leadership of the Holy Spirit that's producing those characters in our life by the trials those trials divinely predestinated trials in your life to produce this characteristic because who can produce Faith as we said in the message uh works as Faith Express and that message brother brandom says you did not have faith faith is a gift from God it's a revelation you see and so how thankful we are that we cannot create these Divine natures in ourselves it's the Holy Ghost under that leadership of the Holy Ghost he opens the word to us he opens that word and makes that word a living reality to you and I the word becomes spirit and life in our own lives you see that's what the prophet said in the message uh Christ is the mystery of God reveal he says now for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father and we saw that yesterday when we read over in 1 John chapter 4 I believe that it said perfect love cast out fear so the journey that God is directing and leading you and I it must be putting all fear and unbelief away because remember let this be glued in your heart this great Holy Spirit this great supernatural being the angel of the Lord the same one that when Joshua had crossed over Jordan he was there and he told the people we're going to take Jericho that's going to be the first battle there we're going to take Jericho and he himself who had been given a commission by God himself to go no man shall be able to stand before you don't fear don't fret I will be with you you see Joshua under his commission moving he brother brandham said in the scriptures you know the scriptures he saw a man standing against the building and he drew his sword and he ran over to the man and he said who are you are you with us or are you against us and that great Angel of the Lord who had imorph himself with his arms like this he said to Joshua I am the captain of the host I am God and Joshua fell down on his knees and God said take off thy shoes you're on Holy Ground then Joshua knew he was not in charge of the battle but there was one that was leading him to Victory after Victory after Victory who is leading you is the question this morning are you being led by some mental conception or can you say that the same one that led Joshua that's LED every messenger Through the Ages is that the same Bible holy ghost that is leading you amen you see that angel of the Lord that is indwelling in You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost leading and guiding us when that Mighty angel of Revelations 10 descended there with an open book A book that God had given Adam in Genesis given him this great inheritance and after the fall brother Bram says that book went back to the author self into the hands of God and then it was in the hands of God until we see a lamb comes and takes the book in Revelations chapter 5 amen he is worthy to take the book that same lamb that same Holy Ghost has to be in your heart to take the book and open the seals and reveal the mystery of your Redemption to you that same one it's the same one you said that was a lamb but when the seals were open brother Bram said my revelation of it is the lamb and the Holy Ghost are the selfs same person only in a different form so the baptism of the Holy Ghost that took the seals and opened the seals and broke those and came down in this day is the same holy ghost that led the prophet am so who am I lifting up man no no no the Holy Ghost so that leadership in your life of the Holy Ghost that takes you from Fear brings you into Faith begins to raise you up into the very image of the Living God Amen then he begins to show you that the entire leadership and the reason that you're here this morning is not just to see one another but the reason that you're here this morning is to hear that word and have that Holy Ghost to Quicken and make aive more and more into the positive and that's why Paul said that which is perfect has come and that which is perfect is divine love amen so the connection that the Holy Ghost has in your heart if he's not leading you listen now if he's not leading you from Mortal to immortality you're not under his leadersh ship because we this leadership is not Church home Church home Church home Church home Church home Church home is that all the broadest Church home did you hear that message yeah did you listen that meage yeah Church home Church home we're under the eagle anointing this is a people in the Third Exodus this is a bride who is in the in motion that's journeying out of this chaos amen that's why brother brandham said and we see judgment in the land already that's why brother brand said people will begin to say I thought there was supposed to be a Rapture before these things and a voice said it already happened you didn't know it people around the message going to be stuck in churches remembering brother Andre said Church home Church home and the bride already gone that's not you you were not made for that you were created for an eternal purpose amen you see so when we become conscious of the reality not the circumstances because your house your car your job that circumstances that can go like that amen so impress me impress me wear some high dollar shirt impress me that would that impress the Bride come on now dress fancy and and Vace and all of this nonsense that don't mean nothing you say I got a million in the bank it don't matter if you got a billion in the banken what does that mean when you have turned Heavenly and you understand that you're being led out of this chaos then what do these temporal things mean to you amen sure we have them sure we want to have nice homes and and all those nice things but the bride ain't holding on to none of that that's just nice convenient things to help us through amen but the bride has been so connected to the holy ghost that under that leadership of the Holy Ghost each and everyone here this morning should be able to get up behind this testimony and show and be proved guilty of being a Christian that the leadership of the Holy Ghost is leading you into immortality without quoting me what brother brandham said amen if you can't then what testimony do you have on Resurrection morning when that race of the the race of almighty God in human flesh stands in their age and says I overcame by the word of God for this age what about you you stand in that group sure you do sure you do so the leadership of the Holy Ghost so we know that this holy spirit is leading us from Mortal to immortality amen so somebody ask me you in the you in the message brother Andre yes I am what is the Holy Ghost doing he leading me from more than immortality brother he leading me out of here and in that leadership I'm growing growing up into him who is the head of all things and I'm mastering circumstances in my life and I see a Life coming forth that I didn't receive from Mama and Papa but come from God and it's growing and the sunlight is drawing it like like like the sunflower I didn't know I I was talking about in central when we were over in Venezuela and uh uh Sant Elena there and and the sister uh sister Theodore she had these beautiful sunflowers I I really didn't know about sunflowers until that day and my wife she knows about flowers and she said my you should see these sunflowers they're so beautiful and I looked and I saw them but the sun wasn't out so they were kind of kind of closed up like that but she said no no no no they'll they follow the Sun so I said I said Okay I want to watch this and so after the sun was up then the sun there in the East and they had they had opened up their petals and you could see the yellow of the sunflower and it was just facing this way and I said well that's nice that's nice but then by midday the sun right here they ain't still facing this way them flowers done turn that way it's still looking at the sun I told my wife man that's right that's that's sweet then getting toward the evening that sunflower done turn like this to following the sun I thought man she said that's why they call it the sunflower it follows the sun I thought my that's a revelation because the sun 93 93.6 7 million miles from the earth yet that sun has an effect on that little flow it's following the light of that song Hallelujah pise the Lord are we following the light of the Son of God are we are we moving with that or am I am I like this the sun over here and I'm like this talking about praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm in the light somebody said you in the light the light over there you talking about you in the light oh so you just singing you ain't you just singing the light yeah turn your head over there oh yeah there go the light oh man see so this connection this 93.6 million miles from the earth the sun rays the energy from the Sun is having a relationship with this sunflower amen praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God it's being led by the L right brother Brown said my first Bible was nature so when we can see even nature is obedient to God then you ask yourself what about these sons of God they still looking that way and the sunflower know where the sun is so you and I having that connection with the Holy Ghost when he moves we move with him when he goes higher we go higher when he brings forth then we receive because we are in connection with that light you see then being in in connection with the Holy Ghost you and I cannot go in a Rapture without connecting to our theophany will'll be Earthbound is Earthbound can be there has to be a connection and a Biblical chord that is connected us to that theophany and you're drawing from that word drawing from that word so we see here in Romans chapter 8 verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then hires now the leadership of the Holy Ghost you already know these things we ain't bringing nothing new the leadership of the Holy Ghost is to bring you back to the position that you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen so we know our destination we're not a people that don't know where they're going we are people that know exactly that we're going from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the mystery of justification the mystery of uh of justification sanctification The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is brought To Us by the coming of MDC amen we know that we're going from the church a justification to a higher justification that you never did sin and you was never looked at as a sinner only MDC can bring you into that position under the mystery of justification because he is King justification king of righteousness king of Peace sanctification King of Kings baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you see the reality and the bride has come to the reality we're not preaching types and shadows tipes and shadows were something we were looking at but now the reality it has come Christ has come that which is perfect has come and you're being made into the very image of God himself leadership and so we see hes the Bible says hes of God and as we were saying last night your new birth is not the same as your adoption adoption is placing we are born a child into the kingdom of God how many in here born an adult when you were born you come out as an adult your mama in there screaming ah ah every floor on the hospital hearing her thinking man what going on there and then she deliver you and it used to be a time they had little babies in a little glass you could see and somebody said you need to go down there and see that baby go down there you see them little baby in the basket and then you see a grown man laying in the bed talking that's what she birthe so ain't nobody come in here in a full adult you grown your mom talking about yeah I I I I birth this right here he he 511 230 lbs I already come with the clothes on say it's something going on in this Hospital need to call the FBI or somebody on these people so so so your birth in Christ you don't come no full grown person Amen brother so your adoption that's sunship many people don't even though they're born again they don't go all the way with to their adoption because God listen now God adopts his own children I want y'all to go I want y'all to see if I'm telling the truth go in the Cod book and see what brother brandham said and go in the adoption book because y'all been reading the message 50 years and if y'all don't know that then shame on you because brother Gerald preach these thing if you don't know that your birth and your adoption two different things then you ain't never read the message amen you got to grow up into him so when you grow up into him you ever heard of an adoption ceremony in the Old Testament brother brand said they had an adoption ceremony now a man may have had four or five Sons but he wasn't given all his inheritance to any son now the firstborn son according to the Old Testament that firstborn son he was to receive a double portion of the inheritance he would be he would be the very priest of the family you see the firstborn son would receive a double inheritance of the family now that son ain't let that father brother bandam told us in in the message uh hear ye him different one speak to this Mountain that there was a in the Old Testament that they had to raise a child and the father would get a tutor and he would get the best tutor he could to raise that son he wouldn't just get anybody he'd get the best one he could to raise his son that that son would know about the business of the father and be about the father's business amen see so he wouldn't just at the at the time of birth he wouldn't say praise God here's the inheritance son because that some might be a renegade he might have a good son he might have a renegade son he might have all kind of thing so he got to try and test that son to see if he can give his inheritance to him amen what he going to give his inherit a man done worked all his life him and his wife they got money in the bank lands and everything father been responsible and they birth a son who ain't responsible and just like the prodical son just say Daddy give me my inheritance or daddy let me have the inheritance and the I said what give you the inheritance boy you are hot riding around you done already waste yours and and you ain't got no responsibility you think the father going to just hit call the mother and say sweetheart come on this our little son and I know he ain't been responsible but he told me he gonna be responsible so let's just go ahead and write that million dollars and give it to him let's just go ahead and give him the deed to the land and the house he said we can stay stay in the house for a while he already done bought our bearing plots and everything plus he took a lot of in dang only some a parent that's that don't know what they're doing but you want to give your that tutor has so tutored your son you want to say to your son son I see you being responsible I see this this all these qualities at that are in me it's in you and I've been testing you watching you over these years see how you going to conduct yourself me and my mom me and your mom have been watching you and you've been growing up you've been responsible even when you made problems and did thing you came back respected me and your mama etc etc etc we going to have a ceremony for you we're going to adopt you into the family praise the Lord now he was birthed into the family but you got to be adopted into the family you see Amen to receive the inheritance so the Bible says that you and I the elect are Heirs of God you have an inheritance in God but it goes further you don't think the Apostle Paul knew what it meant to be joint heirs with the firstborn so he doesn't stop and say you're just hirs with God he says and also you are joint hirs with Christ because him being a prophet he understands what it means means to be a joint Heir so Christ being the firstborn of a new creation you and I are not just only Born Into the family after his kind but we are connected to his inheritance the same inheritance that belongs to Christ belongs to you also amen you see so not only did God give you an inheritance but the inheritance that he gave himself in Christ he gave that to you also because Son of God Ministry is heir of all things son of man Ministry is heir of the earth and everything Adam lost so he has given you Christ has given you the double portion to The Inheritance not just air with God you go back and study those things not just air with God but everything that Christ has that's why when one day uh the sons of thunder the sons of Zebedee James and John and their mother their precious mother came to the Lord and she said Lord I have a request and the Lord said the Lord Jesus he said uhhuh how are you doing said I'm doing fine I got a request though he she said Lord saidwell go ahead what's what what's your request she said I'm designed that my two sons James and John they'll sit on the right hand and the left hand of you and your kingdom see that that's any Mother's Love they want their son sitting in a good position and brother Bri says in the message how can I overcome that Jesus said to her he said ma'am he said it's not for me to give but can they drink of the same cup that I drink of and Jesus said yeah Jesus said yes they will have to drink of that cup yes that's right but what you're asking that's only to the father brother brandham said he said that position to sit on his left hand or his right hand was not even a position position at that time that had not even come into view so the prophet of God said he said that position it was given to the bride of Christ at the End of the Age amen amen so it had not even been a position that could be given yet because God was still dealing with the Jews had not even moved into the Gentile dispensation to call them up Through the Ages that did not exist at that time but after Christ came and and called a gentile Bride for his name's sake then the position was created amen and Jesus says being the firstborn also understanding the law of the double portion to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne They will receive my inheritance also so you and I the Hees of God join HS with Christ the bride is moving in the position of Christ himself amen his authority his domain all that Adam lost Son of God heir of all things son of man heir of the earth and everything that Adam lost read the message it's all there heir to the the Royal Grant that's air to the Seed of Abraham brother Brandon brings those things out so the leadership of the Holy Ghost has to bring us in this time in the position to be raised up in Heavenly places seated with Christ in the position that God has given you before the foundation of the world amen amen and so just looking at these things before we go on so we see that the leadership of the Holy Ghost the leadership of the Holy Ghost that inward holy ghost that lives in your heart he must bring us to The Living reality and to the promises of God that are written for you in this hour amen and he's not going to fail he's going to do exactly what he said he's going to do if he only brings one out of this generation he he will keep his word you see amen so you and I being tutored and trained and taught to move into our inheritance because that's what the leadership of God is doing it's leading us and bringing us into an inheritance of eternal life out of of an immortal body and an immortal Spirit an immortal world and I will give you a new spirit and a new heart I'll give you a new body a new world a new Heaven and a new Earth a future home you see all of these things amen so we begin to be conscious of what the Holy Ghost is doing instead of church home Church home church church church oh Church home that's right Amen Let the Living God connect you to the realities of God then you'll see why you're here this morning that's right that's right so you see moving into the inheritance and being conscious and beginning to operate by the Revelation that's been given to you you are his victory God has not come down all this time from Genesis to Revelation to try to get somebody to love somebody he trying to get somebody to be a Son of God Amen that's right amen blessed be the name of the Lord God bless you brothers let's turn to Galatians chapter 4 praise His name thank you Jesus thank you Lord so we see here in Romans chapter 8 we're going to Galatians 4 now but we see here the portion that we've read we see that this portion of the gospel Paul is speaking of the full results of the Gospel to the believer who is a son taking him into his inheritance amen amen so the AP Paul under the leadership writing these things for that people and for this end time people to let you know that you as a son are coming into full inheritance amen under this great leadership of the Holy Ghost so we see here in Galatians chapter 4 let me let me get over there starting at verse one you you know these things this great leadership now I say that the heir that's you an heir is an inheritor Jesus in the adoption series brother Brown says stay right there Galatians 41 in the adoption series brother Randon is preaching the adoption this message adoption is based on him going beyond the curtain of time and coming backen all you got to do is read the first few pages he said I'll never be the same what happened to to me that morning when God took me over there this whole adoption series is based on him going into his inheritance seeing those there and coming back and telling you the purpose of the Holy Ghost in your life was to bring you into this leadership amen Amen brother randam says in the adoption series thank you Lord he says but the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into who how many stumble into this how many say no I I just stumbled into it no you didn't stumble into you may have stumbled into a lot of things but you didn't stumble into this Holy Ghost here that's right this is that's right this is only elect predestined for ordained for knowledge amen that's right this is by this is by the determinant counsel of almighty God that cannot change amen see so it's nothing that you stumbl into it was the grace of God that led us this way that's right so he says now thank you Jesus brother Brown says seeing this seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into or something that you might that you merited somewhere how many say Lord I merited it how many say Lord Jesus didn't even have to die when it come to me I married Ed it how many got so many good works say Lord I done L about a 100 old women across the street I know I'm a good man come on or I gave some money to the Salvation Army or I gave some groceries to the homeless or just any good any good deed you can think of any any good Mitzvah like the Jews a good gift is a Mitzvah how many Mitzvah how many good things have you done say Lord I know I'm going to be there cuz I've been good Lord and then God come back and tell you you were born a sinner you were lick before you even got here that's right didn't you walk away like that so we didn't stumble into it we didn't Merit it with good works so you here this morning keeping yourself stumbled into it good merits my that's incredible let's see what he says so he says here not that you were so good that you went to church one night that some poor brother LED you up to an altar that wasn't it it wasn't that brother Brandon says it was God Amen it was God am it was God Amen he says it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life amen it was God so Ain't nobody got nothing to boast or brag on it was God The Sovereign elective grace of God called you and chose you before the foundation of the world so we see here now I say that a Heir as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all in that same message the adoption part four brother brownon says now an inheritance to have an inheritance somebody has to leave you something how you got an inheritance if someone did not leave you an inheritance amen that's right so the only so you've been an heir of God join HS with Christ somebody had to to leave you an inheritance amen so we ain't just Christians just well I'm a Christian you're a Christian yeah you believe the message yeah I believe the message praise God you believe brother Brown was a prophet yeah I do do you I sure do do do you read the message I sure do do you I sure do then what do you think about it well you know we just keep reading and everything and and one day we're going to go and live Eternal with God that well that's fine listen if that's all you got that's fine but thaty elect saying you know I found out I had representation amen before the foundation that's right Hallelujah brother you you talking about a different category now we talking about believing the message and everything you talking about what God did before the foundation of yeah you ain't read the message yeah but but I thought you know once we die we we'll live brother I've already been in eternal life for a long time that's right brother amen I've already crossed over amen I'm already in the land amen oh my this is for the elect rich food right here everybody can't eat on thisen I ain't talking about me preaching I'm talking about the Revelation that's right A lot of people can't eat that that choke people to death because they they just only thing they stuck on is their flesh these five senses of the body yeah but I'm going to read to you where brother Brandon when he went beyond the curtain of time he looking into that Dimension where he just come from and he looking into this Dimension and his soul has transferred yes y'all didn't hear me his soul has left that body the terrestrial and now he's in the celestial amen and I'm telling you that the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in This Hour burst us into that land amen that's right even though we're still in this pest house in your soul you're in that land that's right amen that's right that ain't for everybody and I ain't worried about that like I when I preach I tell people I ain't mad at you only the elect can go into these things amen that's that's between God and them so if everybody turn around say well we don't even what you preaching brother Andre you know wining some kind of el intellectual or something that that ain't bothering me if somebody said well I can't see that that ain't bothering me I don't want to see you mad but that ain't bothering me because all that the father has given me Jesus said they will come to me that's right right so we we could be up all night crying oh I don't know why they ain't coming in oh I don't know why they ain't receive oh why can't they see it if they don't have eyes to see they can't see it that's right so why I'm going get mad at them that's right ain't mad at them I'm just gloring because he gave me eyes to see it amen and that he gave you eyes to see it thank you Jes so he says oh an inheritance somebody has to leave you something to inherit it is that right an inheritance what inheritance do we have what inheritance did I have brother Brown said I didn't have but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen so before the foundation of the world God gave you an inheritance and eternal life in Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost knowing that he's got a bride that will not go to the grave and a bride who's already in that sixth Dimension he's got to bring both of those group for when the fullness of time would come God would gather together those in heaven those in Earth all into Christ and to be made one and that's what the Holy Ghost is working on in our lives to bring us into that reality read just a little bit more now he says now what inheritance did I have I didn't have this is the adoption part four paragraph 72 but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he goes on he says now look has an inheritance look has predestinated us to an inheritance so here in Galatians chapter 4 now I say that the heir that's us as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so as long as he is a child the father has not adopted him and given him the full inheritance he gave Jesus full inheritance we see that in Matthew 17 on Mount Transfiguration he gives us us a for view of the great Millennium in those things in Revelations chap in in Matthew chapter 7 so we're not waiting to die to go into this inheritance we have pass from death into life amen we are in the immortal Revelation and the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen and you didn't stumble into this you didn't Merit this you didn't learn this it's not because you twiddled your finger and say I'm humble nonsense humility is obedience to the word of God so he says here now he says but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so you know these things we're not going to go over but brother Bron the scripture says that this child is under tutors and governors unto the time appointed there's an appointed time in your life when you come to the fullness of this word led by the Holy Ghost as we said the Holy Ghost he doesn't Pat you on the shoulder and say good job it was nice working with you you was a good son and I've already told the father and you'll be all right I'll see you around sometime no no no the Holy Ghost raises you up all the way and then he incarnates in you amen and Jesus said the same one that led you he will abide with you forever amen then he who leads you and builds you up he comes himself IM morha breathes upon you the breath of eternal life amen and all that Adam lost brings you into the full authority of the word amen you say the full authority of the word the full authority of the word not only are you hes you have become joint hes with Christ hallelujah hallelujah is the right word he says now verse three even so we when we were children were in the bondage under the elements of the world and we were we were under the bond bondage of the elements of the world we didn't know Christ we didn't know the fullness of the word we didn't know that we had an inheritance we didn't know that we was a part of a bride we didn't know any of these things but when the fullness of time but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption or the placing of sons amen so what what is he saying brother Andre we who were children yet we had an inh heritance in God but we had to be raised and come to maturity and be tried and tested to the father brother Brenham said in the Old Testament he would take that son into a hill or a mountain above all the people there and he would say to the people this day I am adopting my son he's not going to adopt any other person's son he only adopts his own Sons and Daughters not all grow up into the fullness but those that come to the predestinated course that God has given them amen then he says son and the message what is the Holy Ghost brother Brandon says the father he presents his son there and he moves back and he says now I've given all authority to the son hear ye him amen amen the last invitation you Bible readers help me out tell me if I'm wrong correct me because I want to be corrected the last invitation in the Bible the last invitation how could I give an invitation If any man thirst let him come How could a mortal being without access to the Living Waters in The Fountain Of God has how could he give access to the Waters of Life how could he do it how could if you all said look brother Andre we going to come and see you in the United States we like to go to the White House and I said well ain't no problem you you just go and when you see the cir secret service out there you just tell them brother Andre said I can come and tour you go up there you Ain fixed up yourself real good nice got your little camera and everything and you you go up to the gate and say excuse me uh uh are you Secret Service and that man standing with the badge on his 9 millimeter right there and you seeing all these people he say yeah I'm Secret Service what's the problem he said no when uh a brother was up in Newland St John brother Andre he told you know I told him I want to see the White House and he said uh well if you want to see the White House you go down you tell him brother Andre sent you and so I'm here to tell you brother Andre sent me I'm ready to go to the White House I've seen many pictures of it and I I like see the different places and the statues and and the pictures and everything and and you know I I like to go into the overal office with presidents for many year so I'm telling you brother Andre told me man GNA look at you and say you about one of the craziest person we ever seen today who is Brother Andre you don't know brother Andre no I don't know him and just CU he told you to come you ain't got no pass you ain't received no letter from the Secret Service we ain't investigated you and you you even though you fixed up dressed up look good smell good all that but you ain't going in then y'all call me brother Andre you said no man I didn't think y'all were gonna come to Washington DC I just said that I can't give you that access so how could someone y'all don't mind turning let's turn to Revelations real quick Revelations chapter uh 17 real quick then we'll come back I'm not going to keep you much longer but we just got a little bit more to get into so just pinch your spiritual conscience and let's just and and bear with me here so we see here in the scriptures let me let me get to it I'm sorry Revelations 22 so how can someone without access being the last invitation of the Bible in Revelations 22 verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come amen this is the last invitation in the bible let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely how can the bride without access of the spirit say these things and they just be empty words no no no no this is a people that God has ra raised himself given them hes of God join HS with Christ and have placed them in the position to say if any man thirst let him come and take of the Water of Life freely amen you say well I don't believe that then go to the Catholic church and ask them see if they see if they can direct you to life go to the Methodist go to the Pentecostal see if they can give you life the seed only comes through the body life is in the bride where is life if life ain't in the brde where is it what denominational Church where's it at so we see here the last invitation the bride under her prophet's message is the final voice to the final age amen she only and she alone has the message of the hour power that can give life it's not her giving life it's the word that gives life but she directs them to the word and to the F you see hallu so the inheritance that God has brought you into is a living reality and not just somebody trying to get worked up but people who have been led into this position and made conscious of the reality that has been given to them amen amen you see that's why you are his victory here at the end time let's go back real quick now to Galatians chapter 4 verse 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the placing of sons to receive the adoption of son remember that father y'all already know this he brings that son up to a mountain he throws his robe over him he gives him the robe of righteousness amen and then he takes the wedding band of unmerited Grace and he places it on his finger amen he has the robe he has the Seal of the father Hallelujah his name on the the check is just as good as the father and that's why forever we read the scriptures ask anything in my name I'll do it he ain't talking he talking to adopted children amen that's why through they well God I ask in your name I didn't receive it and Jesus said ask anything these adopted children these children that had come to the position they have the ring they have The Robe and they're not going to ask anything out of his will because that Holy Ghost has grow them up into sons of the father Hallelujah they know exactly what the father wants done amen because why he dwells in them prise the Lord and they ain't running out doing all kind of things trying to impress nobody who God trying to impress you God and you done created everything who you trying to impress who you who you got respect for you God he ain't respect of no person he created all persons you see right so God bringing you who are genes and spirit of his attribute not somebody that stumbled into something somebody that done a good work we're talking about A different race than your mom and dadd is amen we're talking about a different seed we're talking about the bride of Christ that's who you are so y'all bear with me so we see here in verse six verse six and because ye are Sons when we say Sons that's sons and daughters so don't think man he just talking about the son what about the daughters brother Andre they ain't got nothing Sons and Daughters amen see and because ye are sons and daughters amen God has sent forth his Capital Spirit s p i r i t of his son into your hearts crying Papa God what that that's a relationship right there Papa God I remember as a child my daddy he was a hardworking y y'all know I ain't going to go into the history about my dad CU I know y'all say BR you always talking about your daddy and all this but my dad he was not like a real sentimental person my dad didn't walk up to me every day and talking about I love you Andre I love you now my mama did my mom said I love you Andre CU that's mother that's the feminist innel they'll put the hand you know my mother used to wrestle in put her hand around my head and stuff and and I love my mother just like you love your mothers and and always treat your mother with love and respect well she be in the mess or not I love you mother so uh so my mother you know she used to and but Daddy Daddy he you know Daddy was man masculine cap to him and so my daddy he wasn't the daddy that just gonna say even though I knew he loved me he ain't gonna walk over to him and say son I I just I just there ain't nothing wrong with that that should be done but my daddy just wasn't that kind so one day we was cleaning up my daddy clean the cemetery for the church and it was a hot day and the gasoline was down there and I was sitting on the wall I was only about 8 or nine years old and the fumes from the gasoline because the wind was blowing it I was like and I and I was fainting and I screamed out Daddy Daddy help me Daddy help me Daddy my daddy ran as fast as he could and he swooped me up in his arms and he said son son I even saw tear come out of his eyes son what's wrong son what's wrong I said Daddy that gas that gas and he walked me away and he told me he say son I love you I love you son I was never the same from that day Hallelujah that brought a connection with my father that even though I knew he had love me that brought us such a connection but everywhere I everywhere my Daddy went I want to go my daddy he work at like you know building PLS he come in at night about 11:30 went to work at 3: come in about 11:30 and my mother would always fix him a big plate there be in the oven and stuff and I used say mama I'm G to wait on Daddy to come home and when Daddy come home I said Daddy we got your plate right here what was you doing at work today Daddy he said he sit down and talk to me when he told me that he loved me it it it brought that that that closeness even though I love my mom there was no one like my daddy even though I love my mom because my daddy he showed that kind of affection in me and so that now magnify that billions and trillions of the love that the Holy Ghost amen tries to connect with you and I amen and try to say look I ain't trying to make you religious you my son you to my family why I want you to be trying to fake and be religious and all that let the religious crowd be that you son you my son I love you you ain't going to be lost you come from my lo you see amen he brought that connectivity the Holy Ghost connected me to that something real something that happened to you that you can say I know God loves me because the word says so and because the Holy Ghost has quickened it in my heart when they talking about be the Rapture I can't but be the Rapture I'm born of the seed of God I can't but grow up to be like my daddy because it's in me to be like my daddy I ain't trying to work up and say well man maybe I can work up and be in the family then go and say God I've been working pretty good been doing a lot of good works working harder than the Jehovah Witness I I knocked on a lot more doors than they did God gonna say you working like a Jehovah that don't mean nothing to me you family you belong to family I said Lord thank you I'm family he said I got inheritance for you too but but if you ain't in my word if you ain't seeking these things you ain't hunting your position like a eagle then you you bypassing all that talking about I'm bride yeah well you got an inheritance bride and so then this leadership of the Holy Spirit leading you into that inheritance and God giving his own spirit in you that Spirit Growing Up In You causing you to cry oh papa God oh papa God you can't cry that without the Holy Ghost bringing you to that amen you just trying to work on your memory or something but when the Holy Ghost make that real you say oh papa God oh ABA father oh Lord I see the connection I see I really am a Son of God and a a daughter of God you see the reality of the connection that has connected you back to what you were and your father before the foundation of the world okay I'm going to read a couple of places from the message and then we're going to close I I'm trying to figure out what time it might be and but but ain't nobody snoring yet so I'm going to go a little farther in the message bear with me now let's go back to Romans chapter 8 and we're just going to move on I'm not going to try to say I'm just going to read in Romans chapter 8 verse 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and I like what I've learned from Central when I quote that it doesn't say all things are good it says all things are working together for for your good so you you we all been through things that were not good that were terrible that were bad but it's all working together for our good you see for whom he did for know this is a great forn knowledge of God that went out he also did predestinate listen now look at that with me maybe I've got a Scofield bible maybe your Bible's different but the scripture says for whom he did for know that's the forn knowledge of God he also o did predestinate does yours have a period after predestinate anybody Bible got a period after predestinate mine doesn't either what about a comma mine doesn't either so we're going to keep going with this word predestinate amen moreover whom he did predestinate them excuse verse 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be formed into formed to the image of his dear son so when we hear around the message are you predestinated yeah I'm predestinated are you predestinated yeah I'm predestinated what about you you predestinated well predestination means something to a Believer amen because your predestination is to be conformed to the image of his dear son Hallelujah so just somebody walking around in message say praise God I'm predestinated are you predestinated yeah I'm predestinated are you predestin yeah I'm predestinated and they don't even know what they predestinate to they just say I'm predestinated so the bride's predestination in this new creation is predestinated to be conformed into the image of his dear son amen amen so just because somebody say I'm predestinated and don't know that the predestination for the bride is to be conformed into the image of his dear son amen praise the Lord Brother Matthew was sharing wonderful I enjoyed that last night he was talking to me and sharing with me about predestination and he said you know predestination is like maybe a ship that leaves New York is going to a certain destination and maybe England I forgot how he used it and he said if you've got your token and you're on that ship that ship is not it might be going slow however but it's destination like let's just say from from St John's to England that sh you being on that ship that ship is taking you to your destination amen you going there see you might be on the ship walking around seeing many days and and and all kind of waves and storms and everything but that ship taking you to that destination that's right pre the power of predestination is not you and I but the Holy Ghost working mightily in your life to bring you to the fullness of the word that he has predestinated you to right so God the operation of the Holy Ghost groan groaning in you causing you to groan for that great theophany to be clothed upon bringing you to the great predestination that you are to be conformed into the image of his dear son so if somebody tells me brother Andre I'm predestinated well praise the Lord but do you know what you're predestinated to amen so I'm predestinated to eternal life but what is that that is to be conformed right into the image of his dear son praise the Lord amen for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his dear son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren he is the sheath wave the wave sheath he is the the the brother brandham said he is the the original wheat seed of God you see he is the one at 's race fell and went into sin for by one man's disobedient were all men made Sinners but by one man obedient we are made righteous through his obedience oh my you see so we being not under Adam brother brandham said under Adam you was represented in heaven as a sinner but under Christ you're represented as a son of the Living God amen that's right amen do you know where you're standing this morning listen now he uh more of whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified praise the Lord and the message who is this mzc brother banam says going me get this this real quick here yes here we go right here in the message who is this mzc get here real y'all bear with me one moment I've got a new who is this mzc book because the one I had before I just wore it outen brother Brown says he's talking about about predestination he says now talking about the elect he says now the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption only those that are predestinated are the ones that are considered in Redemption because remember we what we said the bride's predestination is to be conformed into the image of his dear son Amen to move into your inheritance all of these things listen and let's see if the Prophet vindicates this he said now the predes he said did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making like think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back see is that right to redeem something to redeem deem anything is to bring it back to its original Place Hallelujah brother brandom says so it's only the predestinated will be brought back because others did not come from there you see bring back being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thoughts of what you was only he wanted he wanted me to stand in the pool pit he wanted you to sit in the seat then we are serving his eternal purpose amen the one listen now the one that left home that's you only come to the Earth to serve his purpose W powerful he says now he won't he says the then then we are and the one that left home only come to Earth to serve his purpose is that right he says all right then after it's finished after you have served your purpose it's brought back to a glorified State it's matured and brought back again brought back home my now we now we in the message amen now we in the message no wonder Paul could say when he was uh when they was building the block to chop off chop his head off he said oh death where's your stin oh grave where's your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory he said death tell me where you can make me holler cuz I'm going home amen because I have a theophany because I went to the third heaven and I saw and heard things that are not lawful for man to utter I've been there see Paul one preaching by intellect he said I receive this by Revelation Amen in second in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 there he said I don't know if I was in the body or out of the body God knows but I was caught up to the third heaven and I heard words that were not even lawful to be uttered brother brandom in his translation he said I went to the first Heaven he said Paul went to the third heaven amen hallelujah my what a heritage what an inheritance what God has invested in you and I he says here he says grave how can uh grave tell me how you're going to hold me for I am a possessor of eternal life amen he recognized that death Hell In The Grave nothing could hold him and nothing can hurt us God eternal life he realized he was blessed with eternal life just like brother Brown says just like like a a little do drop everybody know what a little do drop is that little moisture that sometime it'll settled on the clothes line or something early in the morning he said just like a little do drop if I understand I don't know much about chemistry but it must be that it's the celing of humidity or atmosphere and when night gets cold and dark it falls from heaven and drops upon the ground it fell from somewhere but the next morning before the sun comes up it's laying there the little fella shivering but just let the sun come up and watch it go to shining it's happy why the Sun is going to call it back to where it was from the beginning and that's the way brother Brown says and that's the way with a Christian Hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of God something in US tells us that we come from somewhere amen and that we're going back Again by the power that's pulling us he says the little DW d drop he glistens he shines he shouts because he knows he come from up there and the Sun is going to draw him right back again and a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows Hallelujah when he comes in contact with the Son of God he's going to be draw back up somewhere to where he was as Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me Hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord we see the mighty power of God working in our life to predestinate to conform us into the image of his dear son under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and the message things that are to be I'm closing I'm winding now brother B I'm talking about us being built up in the word he said like a germ coming into a womb of a woman and that word coming into your womb amen amen you who are predestinated with the representation of eternal life giving ears to hear eyes to see heart to believe like a germ coming into a womb of a woman with egg and when and when that little egg begins to develop it begins to bring forth germs but it don't put one human germ and a dog germ and a cow germ it puts all human germ and when a child of God when that predestinated that's a bad word to use but it's God here is God's Bible the for knowledge of God can predestinate make everything work to his honor and when that predestinated seed that you were supposed to be when that predestinated seed that you were supposed to be amen you bypass that but the predestination of God not this pest house but the house of God and the glorification the theophany what you were supposed to be he says now he says now the forn knowledge of God can predestinate make everything work to his honor when that predestinated seed that you was supposed to be and God called you and that little germ of life in there heard the word of God it began to build on word on top of word one on top of the other on top of the other on top of the other on top of the other one it'll not mix with any Creed then God building you up into himself that germ that you were supposed to be brother brandham says in an invisible Union of the BR broad it found you that germ found you you see found it no no no it found you you see and how thankful we are for that just a little bit more now we we moving real quick now brother brandom says here and I believe that's paragraph 21 just going to go as fast as we can brother Brown says now listen now he says your birth here was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows that your birth was pre-planned did you know that your being here never originated just a myth or a thought everything was pre-planned by God Amen everything pre-planned by God he says before the foundation of the world you would he said he knew you would be here the infinite God know that because he predestinated you to be here he goes on he says now you were all pre-planned by God nothing happened by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned from many generations back so that you would be here this morning did you know that that is true just think of that you at one time I'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put into the beding ground of the womb of your mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed into the image like your father then you have Fellowship as we said the other day just like that child being born into Earth brought on to different leaders and everything he's never been in the earth before he's being introduced to a new world that he knows nothing about and the Holy Ghost introducing you to a new world that you know nothing about but if your mind is just on temporal things you'll never know about that world you see so he says here now the only way that you can be a son and daughter of God is because you have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life amen only one form of eternal life that was God see not just everybody running around talking about I got God life and a ain't no evidence of God life in them at all just quoting see yeah when when Jesus the this the Pharisees were going to try to Stone him he said for what good work do you Stone me for Healing The Sick opening eyes of the blind raising the dead what good work are you going to Stone me for they said no no no you being a man make yourself God he didn't make himself God God made him God see and God makes you Sons and Daughters of his Spirit praise the Lord he says now and there's only one form of eternal life that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always not your being but the thought of that he had for you amen you see the gene listen the gene of your life spiritual was in God the Father before ever a molecube before anything else the gene of your spiritual life now if I ask you who your daddy is you say this is my daddy brother Andre this is the picture of our family then I said well what was the gene of your life you say my daddy I said that's right what about before your daddy say my granddaddy said that's right what about for your granddaddy you said my great granddaddy I said how you know that you because Apostle Paul and a prophet of God begin to show the lineage naturally when he said that when mzc came to Abraham that Levi who was in the loins of Abraham Isaac Jacob the 12 tribes amen already there then Paul that great prophet he could take those things and pick up like he did Abraham seek the city whose building make is God we only read that only know that because the Apostle Paul in the faith chapter tell us Abraham was looking for that City amen because he was a prophet amen he could bring these things out show these things because he went to the third heaven he knew what it was to be in in a theophany because he had left his body like brother brandham had left his body and he saw a whole different dimension and begin to tell us that your original state was in God before the foundation of the world and when Jesus came you had representation the traits of your father that's why he uses the spirit of Elijah five times it is the handing down amen amen it is the masculine he says here now he says then the gene of your life spiritual was in God before the foundation of the world we're closing down now got these two out of the way got these two out of the way uh bear with me y'all with me this morning amen and and and I know I know that the mind can only take so much I know that but I know this is Sunday and then Wednesday I'm gone but I know the Holy Spirit can do what he wants to do then then I'm not talking about the mental I must be talking about the spiritual mind see then I know the holy ghost that live in you I can bring him these things he can bring back to your remembrance these things amen that is right brother brandham in the message the rejected King listen now this message here the rejected King okay and the message rejected King brother Bram says now let's pick it up right here he says now this is this is before my church or my sheep that I'm pastoring he's quoting the Apostle Paul now whether it was I was in this body or not or out whether it was translation it wasn't like any Vision I ever ever had I could look there and I could look here his soul had left the terrestrial the Earthly body and his soul had moved into his theophany and brother bham said I could look into this Dimension and I could look into this Dimension I could look there and see my body laying on the bed beside my wife and I could look here and see these people his soul had traveled into the house of God that the Holy Ghost is building around your Born Again experience amen under the leadership of the word people looking for a Rapture and they don't even know what the Rapture by that's right that's right people looking for a Rapture and holding these quotes and don't know that the Holy Ghost is making these things a reality amen so how how we going to make the Rapture without the Holy Ghost you can't you you might say well I'm just a little child but God he g a holy ghost to little children too one day when they asked Jesus who is the greatest in the Kingdom you know what Jesus did he went over he saw a little child and he grabbed a little child's hand and he said I say unto thee except you be converted and become as a little child amen you shall not enter into the kingdom amen so maybe the maybe them big intellectual John say J knew I know he gonna come over to me when they say who is the greatest in the Kingdom Jesus bypassed them all he didn't even grab one of his disciples in cuz they had not been converted at the time amen and he said except you be converted and become as a child you can't even enter in the kingdom of God Amen so he says brother brandham says he says it wasn't like any Vision I had I could look there and I could look here and when I hit that little place I never seen so many people come running and screaming oh our precious brother ain't that something else he said he could look here at his body on the bed and he could look there you say why that's something brother Andre because brother Brown say at the time of the Resurrection only the elect will be able to see those resurrected ones amen so they looking here and looking there amen it's the soul that's been converted and made Eternal that holds the life of God life of God ain't just living with a heartbeat it is the very character attributes authority of God Amen he said I never seen so many people come running screaming oh my precious brother and I looked and young women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother here come young men in the Brilliance of of Young Manhood their eyes glistening and looking like stars on The Dark Night their teeth white as Pearl listen to his words now and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and I stopped and I looked and I was young amen what the what what what is the Holy Ghost leading you to old age I'm talking about in the spiritual real now to be little babies remember there ain't no babies we the first night we talked about that Sharon Rosa all Dy they ain't got no babies up here God was connecting his Prophet to a reality amen listen now and I stand to be corrected brother Brandon was not ready in that condition when he lost his wife and baby to understand 1 Thessalonians 5 if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved amen he wasn't ready for that so God had to keep raising his son raising his son I don't mean just lift him up like somebody on a fork lift lift up some package I'm talking about like a parents raise their child like God raising you so God had to take this Prophet at that time because remember he talking about wanting to see hope at that time that that's his wife there he lost his wife so he lost his little baby so God being gracious to his Prophet when he brings him up here in 1960 when the prophet is ready to understand these things and bring these things to the Brad brother bandam in that theop form he looking for his first wife he looking for hope he's saying it he'll say it so those women you know how brother Brown said a man shouldn't hug up to any woman except it be his wife explain all that but he said there there was no sex glands like that and any of those things no perversion of the mind that Satan just crams us with all the time tries to condemn us just cast them away because that's just nonsense San Will T brother Bown said Jesus was tempted with all that too see so don't don't don't you be condemned just don't don't build a burdess them thoughts come by you say Lord get out of here L Lord know that ain't you that's just how the human realm is and stuff like that but this Prophet looking for his first wife to come all these people running and screaming and everything when hope comes he looking at Hope like this I know she gonna say my husband my husband and he gonna say my wife a good to see where Sharon Rose's at she ain't thinking about that she running to brother brandham she hugging other sisters then she run to brother she look at brother Brown oh my precious brother and then run off and he's sitting there thinking my wife ain't she don't recognize me I'm a first husband she ain't stud in that she in a higher life form love now that look listen I ain't saying that so somebody said brother Andre said we won't know I'm just telling you what brother brandham said I ain't never been there maybe you been there you come up here and tell me I'm just saying what brother brandham said so somebody say well that's what brother Andre said well how he said he was reading from the message but you might know maybe you've been translated so you come up here and straighten brother Brandon out I don't think so just say what he say he been there that's right he would there he come back you see so he said now so he says oh my oh my precious brother and I stopped and I looked and I was young I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this and these women throwing their arms around me now I do realize this is a mixed audience and I say this with sweetness with the mellowness of the spirit men cannot put your arm around a woman without a human sensation amen but there wasn't but it wasn't there there was no con sensation there there was no yesterday nor tomorrow they didn't get tired they never I've never seen such pretty women in all my life they had hair all the way down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were hugging me and it and it wasn't a hug like even my own sister sitting there would hug me they were not kissing me I was not kissing them I it was something i' I have not got a vocabulary he says I haven't got words to say it Perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it's something that I never you just have to be there amen and I looked this way and that way and they were coming by the thousands and I said now I don't understand this I said why then here they come hope my first wife she run never said my husband hope my first wife she run never said my husband she said my precious brother and when she hugged me there was another woman standing there she hugged me then hugged this woman and each one of them they went on now when when his wife had died way back there and here little girl he was distraught he wasn't ready for this he had to grow into this you see I thought oh this has to be something different it can't there's something I thought oh would I ever want oh would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again he's thinking he looking at his body on that bed that old dead carcass he said do I have to go back to that thing again he says I looked around there and I thought what is this and I looked real good and I said I can't understand this but hope seemed to be oh a guest of honor she was no different but just another guest of honor and I heard a voice then listen to him now and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost amen then what am I preaching is the Holy Ghost be good to your neighbor no I'm preaching the same thing that he went into the same Holy Ghost how many Holy Ghost are there and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love amen and I am determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there's only one holy ghost that same Holy Ghost who has brought them into their theophonic form in that sixth Dimension is the same holy ghost that you who will not go to the Grave will bring that same love that same character build that in you right now right here on this side of that sixth Dimension amen because when they come from the resurrection they ain't coming back to a bunch of people arguing divided they ain't coming back to that you know a long time ago I realized that in churches you going to have people that argue PE there ain't no perfect group in in the earth so if I just beat myself over the head talking about somebody else Church man look at that church there they got all they got this and that and they arguing and all that that's everywhere Jesus had a devil in his group amen sin started in heaven so so that tell me then that God dealing with individuals you might have a church 99% arguing beating each other there and somebody there talking about thank you Lord I'm praying for my brothers and sisters but Lord this between you and me Lord keep leading me where you leading me I follow Lord keep growing me up in the word and everybody talking about oh our church and and that's fine there there's power and authority in the local church there's power and authority in the body of Bride in in the local church amen but a lot of times people think by affiliation that will guarantee them Rapture I know I'm in the big Church the mayor go to our church I'm in the big church so I know I'm going in no no it ain't by affiliation it's because you were son and daughters in God before the foundation of the world praise the Lord you see so this is the last place and we're going to go home we're going to sing till we can't sing we're going to eat till our belly button pops off and everything and I'm going to enjoy amen but this is the last one and I thank you for your patience this morning for the supernal presence of the Living God Amen don't don't let the word just run off you like a water off a duck's back amen don't don't do that brother and sister look at yourself in the mirror of the word God is in Simplicity and humility but God ain't just leading us around a mountain just just walking in circles you come on let go to church come on let go to church come on let go and and we just looking for something to happen one day what you looking for you say well I'm looking for a Rapture it's in process that's right Amen brother Brown says when the word of God becomes eagleu to you then you have heard from your theophany you already heard from your theophany the Holy Ghost has already connected you to the position that you was in Christ before the foundation of the world and brought you back to that Fellowship that the father can fellowship with you am that is exactly right and so let me just read this and you've been patient with me if I could give you a little uh Medallion or something that say they were patient December the n9th when I came through but I can't do it though but but you were patient with me and so I say that because there's actually two quotes and I don't want you to get upset with me got to use some reverse psychology on you so let let me just read this in the message future home brother brandom says if you got eternal life life there's only one form that's God and you are an Express attribute he's going to get strong now if you were not you're not going to be there anyhow it's strong but that's the truth if you were not there if you were not a fault in God's mind in the beginning you can never become the word that's right to be the word you had to be ath thought Express that's right amen so if you were not a thought in his mind before the foundation of the world you can never be the word you can never return there because you were not there in the first place listen to him he says for no man can come to me except my father draw him see all these old things passed away he says the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity where you was all the time man let me let me read that again the Holy Ghost brother Brown says now the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in you are in eternity where you was all the time but you just recognize what happened I was in eternity all the time brother Brown says yes the gene of your spiritual life amen what God saw you and the fellowship that he desired to have with you was in him to bring you back to your real you amen you're real you not the one that Mom and Daddy birth the one attribute Spirit attribute sons of his spirit that were in him then by the baptism of the Holy Ghost which makes you Eternal then he has brought you back into eternity where you was in him before there was a cherub a star anything why has he brought you back that way for Fellowship God ain't fellowshipping with you down here in the church ages you in the broad age you in the mind age the intelligence you you're back father and son with the mind of God he has built you up to himself he has adopted you you know his desires you know what he wants you know these things now you're having fellowship with him Lord real Fellowship amen you see so he says here and the so that was that one that that you gave me Grace on listen brother Brown in the Cod book please explain the mystery of the translation of the briad he says in in the question answer book page and and and brother I got Pastor I got your book because I I'll put it back back I won't mark it up or anything so and on page 113 question 362 he said they say please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride listen to him now he says just a change then he says now listen he says see our bodies now let's say our he says you know what I mean when I say this I don't mean to be Sac religious I don't mean to say ours I don't mean to say this church I mean to say every believer he says Abraham was looking for a promised son that was promised him is that right and the church is looking for a promised son the bride is that right the bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to Sarah and Abraham there bodies had to be changed is that right she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins her breast her breast was dried up her womb wasn't fertile she was sterile she could not have a baby her heart was too old to stand labor so what happened God changed her back to a young woman and he did Abraham the same thing cuz he said his body was as good as dead see and he had to change their bodies in order to receive the promised son and we cannot receive the promised son that's promised us in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin he's talking about meeting the Lord in the air listen now he says now this first conscious controls this body with see taste feel smell and hear and has just and has just got us all scrp it up we reason and everything else but that new body that comes from this born again not this first conscience it'll pass away it's that inside something that lives everybody understand it say amen he says it's not this outside SE taste fi smell here it isn't it's subject to death and we'll die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is a person that cannot die Amen brother Brown you said that deep down inside of me built around my Born Again experience is another person that cannot die ah what's been going on down there what's been going on in this leadership what has this Holy Ghost been building through your leadership knowing that you will not die to go to the sixth Dimension to get into your theophany he will bring the word that you bypass he will build that in your heart Amen in this Dimension amen he says now [Music] see and that person and that's the person that New Life Starts from from this new birth it builds another person in the image of this person that you are another person being built in the image of what I was this is the negative that is the positive amen he says so potentially it's here what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world the word that you bypass that has come to you and around there this only brother Brown says this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word see and the same thing or the translation of the broad will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same as it did Sarah amen what word you're guessing the word that you bypass that you are supposed to be that theophany has come to you been built in You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this body materializes around that word and becomes a glorified body Glory that's the message of the hour amen not just running around saying I'm in the bride I'm in the bride I'm in the bride you believe brother BR this is the message to create Sons and Daughters of God after his own time you see that ain't for everybody is it for you is it for you me brother then be it unto thee Hallelujah according to Thy word amen bless him Lord he has claimed the inheritance Amen brother random says when that old body she had first body had to be changed in order to produce a son you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive a son God bless you richly Hallelujah let's just bow our head Lord Jesus we have kept your people at length today and the father they have heard your word Lord Thy word is true amen father it's this word that we bypass that we have heard from our theophany Lord like the eagle in the Barnard if he had not have heard that scream he would have lived never coming to the true identity of what he was and what he was created to be but Lord when he heard the word that says you're not a chicken get out of there come out of her my people amen you are an ego amen you can fly said I can fly said jump and Lord we heard the word that says we are the bride and we are to be created in His image we are to be brought back to the origination of sons and daughters that were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world to a glorified condition to meet that Eternal Elohim who has taken up a body himself to meet Sons attributes after his own kind amen Lord we see these things the hour that we live in then we walk in the light and what is light but that it comes from the word what is light except the promise for this hour being made real by the Holy Ghost and father your Prophet said that voice that spoke to him the one voice that spoke to him all of his life said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost amen then father are we preaching a different holy ghost or is this the same holy ghost that brought him into his theophany that is bringing us into our theophany and then on to the glorified body Hallelujah a body after his own kind we're thankful for these living realities we're thankful for these divinely revealed missed your truths that have been made known to us by the opening of the seals Lord and so father how we thank you Lord that you're leading us into our great inheritance making us conscious and real that even though we're in this world we're not of this world and even though we know this world will burn with fire nuclear bonds will burst lies will be lost maybe this entire Peninsula struck by a missile from Russia completely s like the United States completely destroyed but Lord we won't be here then amen we'll be at a marriage supper praise the Lord and the Earth will be brought back to its Eden Beauty again Hallelujah for a great Millennium Hallelujah and then we will be able to worship you and give you the praise that we're you are due but how can we worship you and give you the praise that you do unless we stand in your imageen and give to you back to you the same Divine love that you have given to us amen oh Lord how grateful we are for our wonderful Pastor Lord his stance Lord Brother Gerald Lord and Lord the things that he's been through with his body and surgery and just many things Lord and yet he is standing in the power of the Holy Ghost pointing this people and you hear him say grace Lord pointing this people exactly Grace Grace as the reformer ran out to the street and he met the first person DL mood and said do you know Grace Grace who do you know Grace Grace who the gra gra of God oh Father how we're thankful as Brother Don sung that song Yesterday Lord the grace of God Amen that has come to us in a reality Lord not something we would have to look up in the Webster's Dictionary Lord but

us in life Lord so father we just thank you and bless each and every one Lord fill them with your Holy Spirit seal them Lord because they are your children Lord and we thank you for their patience
