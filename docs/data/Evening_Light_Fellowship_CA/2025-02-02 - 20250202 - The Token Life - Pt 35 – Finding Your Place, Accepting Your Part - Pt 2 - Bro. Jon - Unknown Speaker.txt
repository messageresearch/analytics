amen glad to see she's doing better certainly want to welcome brother Lloyd and his daughter as well God bless you brother and then I sure appreciate that special sister Becky amen God bless you beautiful amen we want the dove to lead us you've got to have a sheep nature you've got to have the right kind of nature to allow a dove to lead you amen and it takes the right attitude the right Spirit to allow him to do that Psalms 127:1 says this except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and I want to take a second service on finding your place and accepting your part and last spirit last service we spoke mainly about the the gifts in the church we talked about the nine spiritual gifts that are available in the Church of God and we spoke of the different offices and the administrations and these different things and they're all there for either children of God to be used in or those things to use children of God but one thing we learned last service is not everybody has them all amen not everyone has them all and there's only one example that had it all and that was Christ that was the fullness of the godhead bodily and flesh and he had everything in him that there was but each one of us just has a portion and that means that we need each other that's what it means because remember the word now has been distributed the life has been distributed and so each one of us has a portion and you don't have it all and I don't have it all and even if we think we do we don't and so we need every single one that's a portion of that word this morning and if we see a Believer off by themselves I'll tell you today whether they'll they'll accept it or not they're unhealthy they're unhealthy because they're not giving what they have and they're not receiving what others have and they're they become an island and a person under themselves and that's not the way God has built us he's built us to be part of a body of Believers we're here with a purpose and our purpose is found when we're joined together in that body now last service we spoke how we've been placed into that body of Jesus Christ that's the bride of Christ and we know that it's the work of the holy spirit that does it the placing is always by the holy spirit it's not by your choosing it's not by your preference so that means where we are and what we do is up to him not to us amen it's his decision that does that we don't get to pick our decision but our purpose is to find our place and stay there that's the purpose for the believer and we read this in our opening scripture that if we decide where we want to go then the house is built in vain if we decide how it works if we decide what goes into it and it's in vain but if we'll let him do it if we'll let the Lord build the house then he will set the bride in order and so we see this in 1 Peter 2 Peter says this ye also as Li stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ he says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that word peculiar that that phrase peculiar people means a people that are chosen for his possession for his acquisition and for his preservation so in other words you are his he will find you he'll prepare you and he'll keep you you're the you're the you're the the children of his body you are the word that came out from him he says and why are you this way that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past we not a people we are Gentiles scattered all over the Earth but now are now a people of God which are had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained mercy so we're not what we were today we were something else but we are something else today and it's his mercy and his grace that changes us but I want to spend some time this morning before we get into our main message because I said something at the end of service and I didn't really explain it I just left it hanging there and I felt the Lord tell me to come back and and dwell on it this morning I said this one thing I said a willing heart does not mean we are gifted or called and I said that and that doesn't sit well with people sometimes because we feel if we want to do it and we've got something in our heart to do it that means we ought to do it but see we have to clarify what the difference is between a willing heart and a heart's desire see they are two very different things see a willing Heart is Open to leadership a heart's desire has a something that it wants to do a willing Heart is Open to what is needed to be done so I want to take us back to the scriptures to talk about that this morning because so often we take our willing heart as an openness to go and do something and that is not the way it works in the scripture and in Exodus 35 just for the sake of time I'm going to just tell it to you rather than read it to you Moses lays out a list of all the things that are required for the Tabernacle of God so catch this idea now God designs the Tabernacle Moses doesn't design it man doesn't design it God designs it and he gives those plans to Moses in other words he gives the word to Moses of what this Temple this Tabernacle is supposed to look like and so Moses takes that list at that design and he breaks it down into what we would call a bill of materials right brother Matt somebody has to take that design that's in the Master's head and they break it down into a list by an item by item list of everything that's going to be needed there needed for the construction needed for the the the everything that's that's built inside that Tabernacle and then Moses takes this and he comes to the people with it and it says and Moses spake unto the congregation of the children of Israel saying this is the thing which the Lord commanded saying take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord and whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the Lord gold and silver and brass and then it would continue another 14 verses of all the things that are needed and it talks about precious stones and oil excuse me spices goat hair cloth furniture and all sorts of things all sorts of of parts and components that are needed so in other words there was a need in the body there was a need to do what God wanted to do and God never ordered anyone to meet the the need he says take an offering that means you have to give it out of your own free will he did not command them to give but he gave them an offering a t an opportunity to give an offering so a willing heart is tied to an offering it is not tied to a heart's desire it's tied to an offering it's not tied to commandment church we do what God says whether we feel like it or not that's what we ought to do now our heart ought to be in line with the word of God but even if we're feeling a little bit I don't want to do that yet we should do it because it's a commandment but when he gives an opportunity now that's where a willing heart comes in God gives us an opportunity to go above and beyond what he requires and that's where the Willing heart comes in because a willing heart is meant to respond to a need not to drive a personal desire amen so God given Moses a list Moses shares a list with the people but imagine now if you've got something that you want to give but it's not on the list imagine you have this beautiful Arabian horse pair that you took from the Egyptians but guess what there's no horses on the list but you come up to Moses and you say Moses I want to give you my horses what's Moses going to say Moses is going to look down over the the list and he's going to say I'm sorry there's no horses on the list and what have we done now we put Moses in an awkward position because you're coming up and you're saying I want a help and he's saying but that's not the kind of help I need and so then what happens when Moses turns us down is that's when we really figure out do we have a willing heart because do we go away and say well he should have taken it CU that's all I've got to give no that's a personal desire that's not a a willing heart cuz a willing heart will come with what is needed not just with what we have there's a very big difference there amen so what is it we can't force ourselves to meet a need that we create that's the way it works and we can see this on a very practical side when brother Paul and sister Kimberly set up the camp what did they do they have a master plan and then what do they do they say here's where we have a need will people come help and so when you come to help you don't come and say I'm here to vacuum you say what do you want me to do with a willing heart when the trustees come and we've had a big dump of snow and they say will you come and help clean uh clear the the walkways and whatnot we don't come and say I'm here to sweep with a broom we say what would you have me to do and they say well we want you to shovel the the sidewalk or we want you to go around back and clear out the stairwell or something like that we don't come in and say Here's what I'm going to do we come in and say Here's what I'm I'm here I'm here use me as you would have me to do it when the sisters sister Amber and sister Priscilla or even my wife are doing a fellowship if they leave it open to you to bring what you want then bring what you want but if they say well we need somebody to bring mashed potatoes then guess what don't say I'll bring carrots the Willing heart is to say potatoes not carrots cuz that's what we need is potatoes amen and watch how Israel responded to this it says the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses so Moses didn't accept every offering Moses only accepted that which was needed based on what the Lord had required that's the way that this works amen so we couldn't come to Moses with what we thought would work with what we thought would look good which what we thought would match his idea no he says this is what we need that's it and you either brought it or you didn't but we can't put Moses in a t position by making him turn down what we've brought because it's not on the list same thing with brother Paul and sister Kimberly same thing with sister Amber and sister Priscilla same thing with the trustees whoever's asking for help we go based on what they need not what we want if we say I need a round Peg and somebody jumps up and says hey I've got a square peg I've got a square peg pick me pick me guess what we're not going to pick the square peg because we need a round one so don't come up and say I've got a a square Pig he clearly needs a round one give him a round Peg or don't give him anything at all we see the same thing when it came to building the Temple by Solomon and watch what David says here David says moreover because I have set my affection to the house of my God and I have of my own proper good of gold and silver which I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house so David has a bunch of things that he's gotten of himself he says even 3,000 talents of gold of the gold of of oir and 7,000 talents of refined silver to Overlay the walls of the house with all and the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers and who then is willing willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord David says here's what we need who's willing to give it says then the chief of the fathers of the priests of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundred with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly and gave for the service of the house of God of gold 5,000 talents and 10,000 drams and of silver 10,000 talents and of brass 18,000 talents and 100,000 talents of iron so the need was for all these Metals precious and otherwise and so that's what they gave and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to The Treasure of the house of the Lord by the hand of jahil the Gite ganite not everybody had precious stones but those that did gave them okay then it says then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord and David the king also rejoiced with great joy so their willing heart was that they gave what was asked for not just what they felt would work amen the Willing heart is always tied to a need not just a personal desire if our desire is to meet the need that's great but if our desire is to do our own thing that's not a willing heart that's actually a selfish heart it seems weird to say it that way but it's a selfish heart because you're doing it for you not for them that's the way that these things work amen if I have a desire on my heart then I'm going in with an intent a willing heart doesn't come in with an intent except to serve to help to support to meet the need watch now Solomon comes back so David's talked here and then Solomon comes and talks and he's saying and the Lord said unto David my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou did well that it was in thy heart God never goes to us and says it's wrong to have a good desire he's saying David it's good that you want to build the house of the Lord it's good to have a desire to do something good but the question we have to ask then is is that desire his will God never chastises David for having the desire but if David insisted on trying to build it chastisement would have followed amen remember what Jesus said in Matthew 7 he says in that day they're going to come to me and say did not we do this and did not we do that and we cast out demons and we healed the sick and did prophesy and did many wonderful things in your name and he says no depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you you didn't do what I told you to do and you went and did something of your your own desire you had a desire in your heart but it wasn't according to my will you didn't check it with the word of God so God comes to David he says David you do well to want to do something good but verse 19 says nevertheless Thou shalt not build the house you w David you're not allowed to build this house it's your desire it's your idea not your job though he says but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name so dropping back to David's speaking and just before Solomon started to build we're kind of going back and forth here it says now then David the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me I had in my heart to build an House of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and for the foot stol of our God and had made ready for the building but God said unto me Thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou Hast been a man of war and has shed blood so why is David unsuited to build the temple he's unsuited because of the way that God made him God's purpose for David was to go and win Wars to bring the land to a time of Peace because it was a king of peace that has to build the temple not a man of blood not a king of war and bloodshed it has to be a man of Peace so David is Built For War and victory and that makes him unsuited to build the temple the way he's built is unsuited for the work that he wants to do but he's got a willing heart he's got a willing heart we'll see it's not just a desire but it's a willing heart amen and so the test of our heart is always what happens when God says no that's when we're going to find out is this me or is it him am I really serving or am I trying to drive the process somehow see David could have stomped around and got mad and said God this is the way you built me this is your doing God you made me this way and I've got a desire and now you're saying I can't do it but David didn't do that David said that's okay I'm going to help in every other way that I can so that when my son comes to build this he's got everything he needs and David did everything he got as close to the edge as he could without crossing over the word out of the desire of his heart a willing heart to do what God had asked him to do amen I have come to the realization that just because I can doesn't mean I should and I've learned that in my work I've learned it in my family I've learned it in churches and everything listen if we put our mind to it most of us can do just about anything and most of us have enough of an understanding to do just about everything but not all of us can do things well and more to the point not all of us can do things as well as those who are gifted and called amen so we've got to make sure that we're in the place that we're supposed to and there are things frankly where if I get involved they go downhill not uphill they get worse not better and I'll give you some examples amen I might have a desire to help but my help is not going to make things any better I have a way of talking I have a way of responding I have a way of planning I have a way of laying things out I'm a pretty black and white person as most of you know and when I set things in motion it's going to be my way or the highway and some people can work with me and some people can't amen that's good when people are in agreement with me but it's not so good when people are in disagreement with me now if we flip those tables and somebody else is in charge and I come along and I think they're not doing something the way it ought to be done that's a test of am I there with a willing heart or am I there trying to lead because if I'm not there can only be one leader and if I'm not the leader I have to subject myself to them whether they're wrong or right as long as it's not a word issue you understand what I'm saying amen that's when we're going to find out if brother John has a Personal Agenda or if he's there with a willing heart is what happens when I'm there and something happens that I don't agree with and listen sometimes when that's happened I've had to humble myself and let it go and that person had to learn that they were wrong but guess what sometimes it worked out that brother John had to realize hey I was wrong humility goes a long ways Church it keeps us in the right attitude Moses had a desire in his heart and a call of God to deliver the children of Israel and we know how much trouble that got him into because he tried to do it of his own strength and we know that God took him out on the backside of the desert for 40 years and he beat that desire out of Moses when God finally called Moses Moses wanted nothing to do with deliverance and that's exactly where God wants us that's exactly where God wants us but we're talking about a willing heart just for this next little bit listen to this this is Moses coming up to the to the the burning bush it says Moses Drew up with a willing heart to understand Moses didn't come up with an idea an agenda or a plan Moses came up wanting to understand and God spoke to Moses and said take off your shoes for the ground that you stand on is Holy Ground Moses removed his shoes and God talked to Moses Moses learned more in 5 minutes time in the presence of that fire than he had learned in 40 years of education he knew more about God with 5 minutes in the presence of that light that he did in 40 Years of studying and schooling see the Willing heart comes in and it's open willing to learn willing to be led willing to be taught willing to be shown then he says this he says now if you have a mind and not a selfish mind but a willing heart to learn the holy spirit will teach you these things so a willing heart it leads us to a place of seeking to understand to obey and to follow not to drive lead and push that's what a willing heart looks like amen it's a it's a heart that's willing to be placed willing to be used according to need it's one that's subject to the needs of the body not subject to our own heart's desires okay no matter how spiritual we make it so we can spiritualize our desires all day long remember I told you that story of that sister in our church back in Texas and she she just brought in an organ and she wanted to play the organ she had a desire in her heart to help with worship but she couldn't play but you when when I went to talk to her remember what she said my daddy had a dream that I was in the church playing and this is the Fulfillment of that dream therefore I must be allowed to play see she had had a desire in her heart to play and she spiritualized it based on a dream her father had and so therefore we had to acquest to that and the answer was no you don't have a gift you're interfering with the music you're interfering with the worship which interferes with the service setting itself up you can't do it but see we can spiritualize our desires because they're good but they're good doesn't mean they're right and it doesn't mean it's God's will in our life okay that's it that's that's our start for this morning but I just felt to drop that in because we're talking about the body we're talking about finding our place and we've got to make sure that our will is according to his desire not just our own amen we go back to our original scripture we're speaking again on finding your place and accepting your part he says except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the Watchman worketh but in vain so the temple is the of the Living God is what it's the body Christ it's the bride of Christ and we see here that it takes God to prepare a place for his dwelling it takes God to do it it's a placing it's a positioning of the Holy Spirit and if we have the same Spirit we will find our place and will be content in our position if we've got the Holy Spirit and we've come into where he wants us rather than what we want so we're going to go back to 1 Corinthians 12 this morning where we finished last service and Paul said for as the body is one and had many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ and he says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body I've said it before I will keep saying it if you don't have the Holy Spirit you're not going to be able to fit into a body of real Believers it's going to take the Holy Spirit to unify us amen he says whether we be Jews or Gentiles Bond or free we have all been made to drink into one spirit so he says for the body is not one man M but many so we look at our natural bodies if I was to Stand Here you'd say how many parts do you have well just we've got you know we've got our extremities of our of our for limbs we've got our head we've got our torso and these different things but then we have all the things that are hidden as well we've got external members and internal members and the smallest things it's funny because they didn't really know a whole lot about the body in these times but the smallest things in your body are the things that maintain your health but it takes every single thing there you even look at your hands you say well I'm a hand and he's a hand yeah but you're not both the same hand you're mirrors left hand and right hand are not the same they have the same number of fingers but this hand and this hand are not the same see that's the only way you can make them the same but then it's not the same because one's backwards the other one's frontwards and guess what this hand on me is bigger than this one because I'm right hand dominant so even if you're a hand and I'm a hand if you're the right hand and I'm the left that means you're the dominant hand that means even as a hand are things you do better than I do even though I'm a hand listen we have in the church we have leads and we have backups don't we we have brother Bob leads a song service well if he can't make it then who is it now we lost brother Josh unfortunately so now we've got brother Joe that'll come up and if brother Joe doesn't take it then brother Mark takes it we've got the same thing for musicians if Sister Morin's not here then sister Priscilla steps in if Sister Priscilla is not here nobody plays right but I can guarantee you sister Priscilla doesn't think she's the lead piano player nor does she presume to be in that position why sister moren's the strong right hand for now and sister Priscilla is the backup and that's okay she's in her position they're both in their position amen it's okay to be a backup until you come into the dominant or primary position that's how you get to the first chair remember in the orchestra you got the first chair violinist they lead the whole Orchestra after the after the conductor don't they when you go in to the arts and culture center to watch uh a symphony play who gets up it's the first chair it's the lead violinist that gets everybody in tune and in order but guess what to get to the first chair you got to go through fourth chair third chair check second chair and first chair and it's all based on Merit it's based on how well you do same thing with the body he says now if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body see we all have things we like and appreciate and unfortunately our human nature is to like what other people have rather than what we have it's just the way we are you look at you you have your the sisters and they'll look at a sister oh she's got the greatest hair yeah but she's heavier than you yeah she's got a a perfect nose yeah but she's got a double chin see they'll focus on what she has without the things that she that are good and not the things that are so great well she can cook so well yeah but you can clean like nobody's business everybody's got something that's wonderful and great about them but we tend to focus on what's not great on us that the other person has because we all want to be the perfect human and Paul's saying listen if you say well because I'm not like brother Chad I'm not a part of this body he says is that really true no it's not true but he's saying watch your attitude because you'll put yourself out before anybody else does because you think I'm not as good as them or I'm not as noticeable as them or I don't do this or I don't do that or I don't have no he's saying you're here because you're a part of the body and you have a purpose and you have a place amen don't let comparisons put us out of the body of Christ and and he says here's why he says if the the whole body was an eye then where's the hearing and if the whole body were hearing where is the smelling if we're all the same we're going to be a pretty ugly body it's a horrible thing it'd be a modern day Frankenstein 17 arms no that's not the way that it works if all we can do is see but we can't hear yes we might be alive but we're not functioning and if all we can do is hear but we can't can't smell then we are of all men most miserable you can't taste without your smell right we need every part to be in its place and working and he confirms it he says but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body how as it has pleased him some of you are here by chance nope every one of them I don't play any part every one of them I don't see what value I bring as it has pleased him you're pleasing to him and you have value based on him that's why he's put you there amen every single person it says has set has appointed placed and established and fixed you where you are for purpose remember this scripture we read a little bit earlier Peter said ye also as Lively Stones as living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ and ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people why that you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light the purpose of a living stone is to show the Praises of God is to show a difference between what you were and what you are and the refence is him his work his Spirit not just talk about it show it remember what Moses got Moses got stone tablets that were dead now God has living tablets living tablets that are the exact same word showing that the power of the Spirit by the word can produce a word image again that's what he's doing it's living tablets but I want to take you back to how those stones were prepared we're talking about the body of Christ and it's a temple that the scripture tells us and if we go back to how the stones were were prepared in Solomon's time it says and the King commanded and they brought great Stones big Stones large Stones I did some research on this because you can go today to the Temple Mount and you can see the original Stones 3,000 years old and the biggest ones are they they say that I saw two estimates between 40 and 44t long that's a big Stone Church that's about twice as long as our longest pew almost and the biggest ones weigh over a million pound a million pound of stone one stone so he says they have great Stones they have costly Stones this means rare precious or expensive and they have huge Stones so these are stones that are crafted and sized for their details and features and at that time they were only used for expensive or important structures because nobody could afford to have every stone perfectly cut but I want to stop here because we look at that and we say well brother John there's three types of stones there's a great Stone a costly stone and a huge Stone that's not what it says and we know that by observation when we go to the Temple Mount we see that some are bigger and some are smaller so not all are great okay not all are great but when you go every single one of them is costly every one of them is of Great Value because every sing single Stone on the temple is hued every single one is shaped for its purpose without exception without exception amen every single Stone there was hu it says in verse 18 and Solomon's Builders and Ham's Builders did heue them and the stone squares so they prepared Timber and stones to build the house so every single Stone in that Temple had to be hued it had to be shaped it had to be cut it had to be fitted can I say this way no stone was Naturally Fit for the temple none of us can fit into the body of Christ in our original Natural State not a single one amen you cannot be put into the temple of God without the master Craftsman working on you impossible impossible amen you cannot be a part of the body of Christ without some molding and some shaping in your life you cannot fit together with the people of God God unless you've gone through the same process they've gone through that's what it's going to take amen you might have the raw gifts the raw talents the raw personality the raw strength the wrong the raw Charisma we talked about everything that you need is there but in your original condition you are not fit for the temple of God you might have the right stuff but you've got to be submitted to the master Craftsman's tools amen you cannot enter this body on the merits of your own you have to be touched by the master Craftsman it says in verse or in the in the next chapter it says and the house this is the temple when it was in building was built of stone made ready before before it was brought thither so that there was neither Hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was building church you can be in church church you can be in church all your life you can be raised in a Christian home can come from the the best of the best but you can't enter this body of Believers until you've gone through the process of Christ working in your life you cannot do it amen listen some of us take longer than others some of us take longer because we resist and some of us take longer because we've got a bigger job and God's got to make sure that your character is ready to handle the load that's about to be placed on you amen but we all need that Master Craftsman we've all got our odd angles our little bumps and protrusions we've all got our imperfections and listen we may look perfect but we are not perfect when we're compared to where we have to fit because he's got a plan he's got a master template he's got a design that's laid out and you've got to fit that and that's going to take some work listen to this he says God gave you the Holy Ghost with your peculiarities God gave me the Holy Ghost with my peculiarities and God gives those the Holy Ghost who obeyed him now who obeyed him who children of his he says see there you are we just draw these little straws and things and that's what the devil wants Church what did they straw draw straws for to assign guilt who's the problem remember when they had an issue with uh at AI when Joshua went there they just destroyed Jericho a wonderful Supernatural Victory then they go to AI Joshua doesn't check up with the Lord he just sends a few men over cuz it's a small town will beat them easily and they lost 36 men if I remember and they said we've got to figure out who the problem is and they drew lots and then it went down and God supernaturally F LED it all the way down to the person that was at fault which was Ain he says you know what we do we sit here and we draw straws oh it's her fault because she's this way oh it's his fault because he's that way it's her fault because she didn't do this it's his fault because he did that he says no no no no no no that's not the way the church Works he says that's what the devil wants but I believe my brethren that there is coming an hour when a real rank persecution will run us together then we will be one the church will come together he says I believe it's all in the making of God after painting this picture to you when Solomon's Temple was built it was cut out all over the world and one block was saw this way and one that way but when they came together every stone went to its place without the sound of a hammer or the buzz of a saw he says and it was the Church of the Living God okay catch that thought because the stones were perfected before they were placed so if we're in a situation and we keep causing friction somebody's not shaped right okay if I can't fit next to you then one of us is out or both of us is out we've got to be able to what see that we're in position perfectly and if there's friction we've got to go back out and let the Craftsman work on us a little bit more that's what it's going to take amen but all the temple work it was silent in terms of striking and shaping tools there was none on site if they went and they put it in and it didn't fit perfect they took it right back out of the temple work site and they took it back and they finished the work and then they brought it in and test fitted it again and if it was perfect they left it if it wasn't they did back and forth back and forth that's why it took so long it had to be perfect for every single one of them by the time they got there the stones were silent the stones were perfect listen to this every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember he says if you can just keep quiet what is it we resist his plan we resist his idea that ain't going to work I don't want to do it I don't like it that way I want my way I never envisioned myself here I don't want to be here doesn't matter you're the stone he's the master Mr Craftsman he says just keep quiet let him do the work he knows the plan he knows the vision remember if he has called you for this there is nothing can keep it from happening there are not enough devils in torment but what God's word will be made manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place that means we don't have to fight for position because God has a place ordained for you and only you can fit it somebody else may impersonate you somebody else may say well that's my spot but if God has ordained you for it he'll get you there and he'll make sure they're moved out in time amen he says you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place why God's word will Triumph it cannot fail there is where every Christian ought to stand knowing that and trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will work out it will all work right I was listening to uh uh spoken words The Original Seed this morning and he was talking about how we were made in His image and he says he says when when when what is he says what is God he says God is the word he said and he said we in the beginning he said let us make man in our image he says what were we made in we were made in a word image it was reflective of the thoughts and intentions of God it was pure deity coming into reality it was a very part of God Amen and so what happens now is that we are born not in a a a word image in a god image we're born in man's image and so we come to this world and we've got a man's image but we need a new birth so we can be born into a word image and that's where we get the new heart and the new spirit that can get along with his spirit so he can pour it into us and changes from what man has made us into what God has determined for us that's what the new birth is supposed to do amen the new word the Holy Spirit brings the word image that was eternal from the thoughts of Mind thoughts of God's mind into reality amen and I was amazed as I was studying this that the the the the temple that Solomon built is 100% dry construction just like the pyramids there is no mortar in the temple everything is perfectly fit they don't need anything to bind them and hold them why because they've been placed by the spirit amen they've been placed by the spirit each one of them is set perfectly and 3,000 years after we can go there and you can't fit a razor blade between them they are that perfect that's what God's trying to do here amen the strength of the stone is not in the Stone it's in its preparation and fit for where it goes because if you take a stone structure and you leave any sort of slot brother Matt Aaron may have shown you his garage Aaron James he's got a garage and it's got It's Made of uh uh concrete bricks well guess what it's starting to pull because it used mortar and it was imperfectly done and so he's got this little fine Gap going right through the wall of his garage you'd think it's a Concrete structure it shouldn't no it has pulled apart why it was imperfectly fitted but when you go to the temple it's perfectly fitted and nothing moves the strength is not in the stone itself it's how it's put together and if you leave any bit of slop There When Trials come when earthquakes come when hard times come what happens those stones will move and they'll start to pull and then eventually something will get to a place where it's got a big enough Gap that it'll just snap in the middle it takes the hand of God to set us to where we can stand whatever comes our way and not move out of position that takes the hand of God Amen that takes the preparation of God that means god builds us to handle certain things you know they have what's called a keystone if you go look at some of these older churches and that they have these great um arches and the key to an arch is always the Keystone that they drop in at the top and it equalizes the force going in either direction so that the the arch doesn't cave in on itself but you got to cut that stone just at the right angle otherwise it all falls apart they've got to support that Arch until the Keystone drops in and as soon as that Keystone drops in that structure is self self-supporting but that Keystone has to be perfect because if it's tapered just a little bit it'll push it back if it's tapered this way it'll push it forward and it'll fail over time it has to be perfectly square perfectly straight perfect ly angled amen we can't make ourselves what we ought to be it takes him to do it takes him to place us we can't make ourselves gifted if we're not we can't make ourselves strong in a way that we're not intended to be strong in amen we can not we can't change our strengths and weaknesses God can change us but I can't change myself same thing within the church we can't make ourselves what we aren't we can't declare ourselves to have something that we don't have amen certain positions in this church based on the scriptures alone have certain requirements and we can't change those some things require time to develop improve and other things are dependent on the absolutes of scripture we can't have deacons that are single because the scripture says he's supposed to be the husband of one wife and have his family in order his household in order you can't be single and be a deacon that's a scriptural absolute same thing for a pastor cuz his first church is his family if you can't prove him by his family how can he be over the household of God the family of God you can't do it you can be the most spiritual woman in this church but you still can't be a preacher the scripture declares you can't do it amen those are absolute requirements but then we also have what we would call soft skill requirements you'll see this in jobs where you might be an engineer but if you're going to be the lead engineer you got to be able to work with people you've got to be able to communicate and if you can't do that you can't be a lead engineer and so those things are not absolute from a scriptural standpoint but there's a practical standpoint that comes through and we've got to look at that and I'll use myself as an example when it comes to Artistic things like music or drawing or creative aspects I'm not strong there I can copy really well I won um drawing contests when I was younger by copying things and blending them together to make up my own creation but I had to have somebody else's work to be perfect you catch that I can't come up with it myself but I can take what they do and I can mimic it very very well okay so I can't come up with those things so if it's coming to music or plays or these sorts of things I'm no good at that and we have sister Priscilla that does that in the church but if you want somebody to schedule the practices make sure everybody's on time make sure that they've learned their lines make sure everybody's behaving make sure we've got the music and the and the the sound all ready to go I'm your guy I can do that but I'm not here to create plays because that's not my gift and so what sister Priscilla does is she comes up with a play and then she sends it over to me and says is this okay and then what do I do I do a quick review over it and then I give her I may give her a couple pointers but generally it's okay and I don't mess with the concept because that's not my strength that's not my strength amen my ability to criticize her work cannot be my strength amen I'm here to help adjust maybe we have correction and these different things at times but my gift is supposed to edify her not crucify her me gifts of tearing down don't exist in the church that's reserved for prophets with thus sayeth the Lord that's who can tear down is a prophet that has a direct word from God to set a situation right amen we're here to provide something to support something not to take away from itam says it this way he says your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not find out whether He blesses what you're doing or not if he blesses it then that's him but count he doesn't say it here but let me add this in If He blesses it in a way that the word says is a blessing got to be very careful otherwise we'll go right into what Prosperity Doctrine oh now I got money it's God blessing it no no no no no no are you blessed in your spirit are you blessed in your soul cuz that's where he wants to bless you before you are blessed in body and finances right he says Satan if he can just get somebody to act like that and then deceive them that's just what he wants to do then the whole world points their finger right there because what happens if somebody doesn't have it and then they go and do it and they fail the world points and says see that's what Christianity is all about failed people listen we all we're all going to fail don't think that because you have a gift you won't ever fail but the point is they'll fail because they weren't supposed to be doing it they weren't called to be there he says and somebody thinks they have a gift of speaking in tongues an interpretation some has a gift of Divine Healing some has these things like now will catch this he says sometimes they're mistaken in those things see sometimes we think we've got something and we don't have it but then he says and sometimes they think they haven't got it when they have and you say well where does that leave me sometimes you do and sometimes you don't not helping us much here he says so it's very tricky and it sure is isn't it if you're seeking to find your place in the will of God it can be very tricky because you can get all sorts of open doors or open Windows you can have a dream you can have a moment and you can say that's it that's it but watch what he says here so always do this Brethren whenever you feel that you're supposed to do a thing first find out if it's scriptural for you to do it and by that he means if it's in the scriptures he says not just wrote in one place but I mean completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to do it your position say if you be an evangelist Pastor teacher Prophet whatever God might have called you to be you see or if you have the gift of tongues gift of interpretation gift of any kind of the nine spiritual gifts in the church and the four spiritual offices of the church any position first see if God called like I said if you're a woman and you say I feel God has called me to be a pastor nowhere not allowed can't do it that ain't God leading you that's a spirit just not the Holy One because the word is s and contrary to the Holy Spirit can't do it so he says check it with the word that's that ought to be the first thing we do Church check it with the word but then he says then usually I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift that they're professing he's saying I'm comparing their nature to their gift and are they compatible he says see God will work with his creature the way he's made him oh oh soft skills matter nature matters attitude matters mindset matters all these things matter he says see and he's talking about a man he says now see him see him real flighty and going on and he says the Lord called me for such and such to be a pastor he says now a pastor can't be a flighty person a pastor's solid sound see God called me to be a teacher and watch him how he interprets the words see if he gets it all mixed up in everything then you can tell then he says these words but then the thing to do your position is usually known by whether you can do it or not now that's very practical can you do it or can't you are you effective in it if we look at it from the stone analogy we've been talking about do you fit or are you forcing your way is there friction when you do it or is it just a natural thing where you slide right in right next to your brother or your sister amen does everyone else have to change for you to do your thing because that can't be God's will because they're supposed to stay in their Lane you're supposed to stay in yours if everyone has to change so that I can be the pastor I shouldn't be the pastor amen notice how he F focuses here on nature not just skill because the nature is what's going to determine how well we work with the person next to us if our nature is wrong then our skill won't matter amen he talks about a pastor and if the man is flighty he can't be a pastor he doesn't say that man doesn't know the word of God he doesn't say that man doesn't have the Holy Spirit he doesn't say that man can't preach he doesn't say that man isn't a good person he just says he can't be a pastor why his nature is off even if his skills are there he can't do it he won't stay in the harness he's going to get tired of trudging up here Wednesday night Sunday morning Wednesday night Sunday morning Wednesday night Sunday morning and never going anywhere else and pretty soon he's going to flee the harness to go out and evangelize why cuz he's an evangelist he won't stay home with the Sheep that's why he can't be a pastor but we don't tear that man down because he's not a pastor we build him up because he's an evangelist we encourage him to do what his strength and his nature is inclined towards rather than trying to force him to stay with us and be a pastor because we need a pastor amen but he's got to be self-aware enough to say I must not be a pastor because I'm not being a pastor it's not in me to do it my my actions my life are not reflecting that of a pastor if I can't do what a pastor does then I shouldn't be a pastor and he's got to be able to see that of himself amen doesn't mean he's not a good preacher doesn't mean he doesn't have the Holy Ghost it just means he's not built to be a pastor he's built to be something else listen church you can be all flighty as you want to be and be an evangelist because no consistency is required except to go with a message you can go anywhere anytime flight is okay teacher you can't be flighty and be a teacher you got to be solid you got to be grounded you got to know where you stand Pastor you got to be okay with drudgery the same thing day and and day out you got to be willing to do that and yet not get stuck in a rut it's a tough thing it's a very tough thing amen listen we have musicians in this church but there's only three that play on the platform now sometimes we have specials and people will go up and play for those specials amen why don't we have more than three up here because it's not just about skill it's about maturity it's about anointing and it's about Unity I I was reading this morning because worship comes by unity not Perfection okay the only way that worship can be led from this Pulpit is if brother Bob is in charge and everyone else is following he is the song leader he is the worship leader he's been authorized by the pastor to lead us into worship and guess what sister Mor I hope this is okay Church sister Moren brother Paul and brother Joe have learned to follow brother Bob whether you're right or whether you're wrong in their opinion that's how they have gotten where they are as they have become a unit so that we can have a song service like we did this morning because they are in unity rather than trying to all Drive the worship bus amen and so they have learned and they have been shaped to take the strain of imperfection right brother Paul right brother Joe we don't have to worry about sister Mor because she comes up and confesses them every time I'm sorry brother John I messed up I'm like whoa you made you made a mistake of the of the 1293 songs that we know you made a mistake oh goodness me what will we do we need a new piano player no praise the Lord praise the Lord but she has had to come to a place where she is Sur surrendered to the leading behind this Pulpit brother Paul the same thing brother Joe the same thing the unity is what brings the worship not the Perfection we can we can take the the the greatest piano player that's in Newland and put him or her up there and they will destroy the song service because they will try to lead they will make it about them amen worship comes through humbling Yourself by unity brother Braham said this I don't have the quote I just wrote it down my notes there when Brethren can dwell together in unity it's likened unto that oil he says we then enter into the presence of the Lord with that anointing of Brethren together in unity and he says oil represents the Holy Spirit that's how worship works that's how worship works because if what's up here is in Conflict this will never work down here but because this is in unity now if we're in unity together guess what we do we have invite the presence of we can enter the presence of the Lord because we're in unity under what the same oil the same anointing we're humbled to him We're humbled to him we're not humbled to brother Bob we're humbled to the Holy Spirit that's leading through brother Bob that's the way that it works Ministry is service not being obeyed and the world has flipped the script the religious World on what it means to be a minister i i i me me me do this for me do that for me no the M the the pastor of a church ought to be the one that is serving the most that's his job is to serve the word Minister means a servant a waiter of tables church if we were to be honest no offense sister Justine serving people at a table is probably one of the humblest jobs you can do because you're there for them not for yourself and you get not a whole lot of recognition out of make out of doing a good job but you always get recognition if something gets messed up it's one of the hardest jobs in the world to serve without recognition that's what we're all called to is Ministry servitude so that we can sand the strain of the imperfect note of the unfair situation of the lack of recognition of the unthankfulness or the taking for granted that comes the way of a servant listen in the old days when you were a servant nobody ever said Thank you you were their property they didn't thank you they didn't thank you it was expected that you did a good job and you got punished if you didn't that's the way it is for us we are serving without expectation but at the other side Church let's not be ungrateful let's not be ungrateful for what we have and the things that people do Paul says and if they were all one member where were the body for all the same part are we even a body nope need a lot of different parts he says but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you remember before it was one saying well I'm not them therefore I'm not a part of the body so on the other side is is I can't come to you and say because you're not like me you're not a part of the body amen do we want a part to be missing I don't want to lose any body parts Church he says nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary if you go into the the the uh the Amplified it says the parts that seem weak are of the utmost necessity the small things are the indispensable ones you can go down to a cellular level and we can see that but the tiniest things in our body can make the biggest difference you ever have a an ache or a pain and you go to a doctor and they say oh it's just this little thing and you think my whole body was aching I couldn't get any sleep when it was just this little thing yeah cuz it was out of joint it was had a nerve tweaked it had a whatever the tiniest little things can set us off just because it's not exactly right he says and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon those we bestore more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness so the things that aren't so great we try and dress them up to make them not so obvious that they're bad I have a big nose so I don't wear this or I don't wear that I've got narrow shoulders big hips what do we do we try and hide our imper imperfections to make them more beautiful he says for comely Parts have no need this is not a looks contest looking good doesn't make you a child of God a beautiful face doesn't make your body stronger a perfect nose doesn't make you breathe better he says but God had tempered the body together God has built the temper built the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked so God's way of boosting us is to give honor to that which seems to not be worthy of it that's God's way of showing us what you think is important isn't important what I think not me what God thinks is important that's the one he honors and that's the things that we ought to amen like I said you go to a doctor and you got a major issue and he'll say it's down to one thing you need more iron you need uh you need your your your hip joint adjusted slightly sometimes we're focused on the wrong things and they're just symptoms of the real problem and sometimes it can be just a little thing that's out of out of place he says that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another that word Schism means division a tearing in a garment Discord and separation he's saying he's gone through all this effort to show us that just because it doesn't look important doesn't mean it's not important that the goodlooking stuff is not as important as The Not So good-look stuff that the hidden things are just as important as the things that are seen why is he telling us this he's saying so that we don't have schisms in the body so the schisms can be removed or eliminated by me realizing that I need you and that you need me every single one of us in this building this morning that there's not a person here without a person purp or without a need amen sometimes we've got to have a little pain to realize how valuable it is to keep something involved to keep something in the body to keep something healthy to give it that Focus amen we have to Value what we bring not what we don't bring in other words you know there ought to be a a Schism in the body because we're not here rather than because we are here do you catch what I mean us being here should cause things to be tighter and us not being here should cause things to fall apart my presence ought not to cause this church to split up that's what I'm saying in other words my my my my my attendance in this church my involvement in this church should cause it to be together not to be driven apart my nature my attitude my insistence my gift my calling should not be causing wedges it should be causing Unity amen he says now and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now that can be a hard thing because not everyone gets appreciated the same way do we some of us have very public very obvious things that we do and people appreciate it and they can see it and they can do it but some roles are silent they're quiet remember brother B talked about that man that was holding meetings and there was one lady that prayed for that service and he says the success of the meeting came down to that woman praying and if he never said it nobody would have known she may not have even known but we don't know that I don't know what you're doing at home in your prayer closet I don't know but you do it as unto God not unto me and that's the nature of a servant is we're doing it to serve not for the feedback but we're all human aren't we everybody loves a pat on the back and add a boy and add a girl and so we ought to be able to do those things but the thing is when somebody else is getting the atab boy or the at a girl can we be happy for them or do we begrudge it because we didn't get our at a boy or our at a girl this year or this day or this week or whatever it might be likewise when somebody's hurting do we all hurt or do we say well that's just they'll get over it we've all got to go through our trials we've all got our load to bear no we're supposed to Bear one another's burdens supposed to hold each other up in prayer amen he says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular that means members with a portion you all have a little bit you you take something as small as your pinky foot or pinky toe how many people in here think the pinky is very important pinky toe it's the smallest digit it's the smallest digit in your body fingers and toes it's the smallest of all of those it is so small and yet if you lose that pinky toe you lose your ability to properly balance your body because it's on the outside it provides a balancing Force when you're moving it gives you agility it allows you to put your power down to the ground properly gives you grip it's one of the most important things on your feet and yet it's the little thing my pinky to is about this big chop it off and all of a sudden I don't have half the agility or balance that I'm supposed to it's the smallest things that can balance the body out amen the small all insignificant parts are crucial to this body to keep it in perfect health and you'll find that it's the smaller things in your body that give you the fine motor controls to do the really delicate things listen if I chop my pinky toes off I can still walk and run but I can't I can't move and Juke the way that a a football running back does because I've lost my ability for balance and change of Direction putting the power down in those things each of us listen I'm not saying we don't have bigs and Smalls because we have roles with greater responsibility and lesser absolutely we can't deny that but the point is every one of them contributes to the health of the body and you lose one you lose the health it might be survivable but you still lose the health you lose the ability to do what you're supposed to we read the scripture last service and I'm closing I want to end with this thought Paul said but every man had his proper gift of God one after this manner and one after and another after that every single person has a particular proper specific ordained gift of God to serve the body Braham says this he says when God has called a person for a job to do there is no one can take its place there is no one can take your place your peculiarity see sometimes it's the things that are different that make us fit for service you know what we're all a little bit weird I'm sorry and if you don't know how you're weird come to me after church and I'll tell you how you're weird cuz we all have it church we all have it the the best of the best okay sweet sweet Becky is weird Okay that's it every one of us I don't care how good you are how great you are how much people like you you still have your little foibles and little bumps and lumps I'm not saying you we let me say we okay we'll be inclusive this morning I've got my foibles and my bumps and my lumps and I'm just plain weird that's why God gave me a wife that's not the same way I am so she can balance out my lumps and bumps and foibles and weirdness and sometimes occasionally let me know in a very loving way you're weird don't do that that's not helping the situation come on now you're smiling you on the you're with me this morning I trust amen he says no one can take your place your peculiarity okay brother Mt I'm going to pick on your family this morning we have three young ladies cut from the coffee Quarry and guess what they aren't even remotely the same Matt couldn't raise them all the same Matt can't treat them all the same they have different gifts they have different strengths and guess what they've got different weirdnesses too cut from the same Quarry cut from the same Stone fit for purpose peculiar and every family's like it you look at all of our families none of our kids are the same as the one next to them why God has a purpose for them and he shaped them to fit his purpose Amen in your original nature you're broken you might have all the right stuff but it takes him to come down and he's saying God picked you God doesn't make mistakes you say I'm weird sometimes we know we're weird God doesn't make mistakes amen if you get anything this morning catch that if he has picked you if he has chosen you if he has given you his spirit God never makes mistakes you're elected in your peculiarity remember what we read earlier he said he gave me the Holy Ghost with my peculiarities they're not going to stop him now he may have to do some shaving and some some shoving and some cutting and some shaving and all these different things absolutely but he's made you that way for purpose catch what he says this you know we we've got we've got to remember we don't get fitted into the body as we are we get fitted into the body the way that he makes us and we've got to come from a man image to a word image amen we've got this this Twisted thing going around today and you'll hear it all the time if you you listen to you know these people especially in alternative Lifestyles and they say well God Made Me The Way I Am therefore he has to love me the way I am well fallacy number one is God didn't make you that way sin made you that way God's got a different thing he wants to make you in you're in the image of man he wants to make you in the image of God by the word okay so we got to be able to not not say that my weirdness I just hold on to it if I can put it that way my strangeness my foibles my bumps he may have to shave some of that off he may have to cut and chisel some of that off but he has still made you as you are and he'll take it and he'll refine it that's what the holy spirit's doing he's refining what's there for his purpose to produce his shape His Image but says this we're closing he says he caught me when I am no when I was nothing he says I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand that makes all the difference church I'm in his hand see he caught me and he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you were unlovable but he changed you but he changed you just like the colored sister said that time in her testimony she said I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I want to be but then I'm not what I used to be she knew she had come somewhere and something had happened he says and that's the way it is if God when I was an alien from him so love me till he stoop down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me Hallelujah church if he came down and filled me with his Spirit he does it with purpose because the spirit only comes to Sons and Daughters of God which means you are in his mind before the world began he's got a word for you he's got an elected purpose he's got an elected position and he's come down and he's given you his Spirit to shape you into his word God doesn't make mistakes he says he's got a purpose in doing it he saw something in me he saw something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have taken beside you but he took you he says amen no one can take your place amen you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you I'm not a fan of psychology as a way of life there's a man named Jordan Peterson that says what is killing our young men in particular is that we are taking purpose out of their lives they have no reason to live and therefore they go home and they play games they don't get married they don't have a family they just show up to work and they go home and they waste their lives why they have found a purpose he says God's love to you is he gives you a purpose and a place and he gives you the power to go in there he fits you by his word amen when it came to the temple there was a great master plan and only Solomon had the plan initially only Solomon had the plan only Solomon knew how it went together and so when he go when he was ready to start what did he do he shared his plan with his foremen and they went out and he shared it with his planners and his suppliers and his purchasers and they went out and they started Gathering those items together now if you were at the lower end of the supply chain and you saw that he wanted these little doohickeys you'd say what in the world is that for and why does he need it why do we need Collins in this church why do we need Shaws why do we need Benjamins why do we need the carlettes they were gone for 16 years why can't we just have coffees I'm not picking on the coffees but it was the coffees that started the church you can say why do we need it we need it because there was a bill of materials at cport and you may not see how it fits you may not see how it works but they are here we are here all of us because there's a bill of materials called the word of God that says these people must be here listen he had to bring brother Garfield all the way from Jamaica he's our greatest import by distance listen he had to send me around for 16 years to get me cut into shape to come back why that's what he needed that's what we needed amen the plan calls for us and so we're here now listen we may not all be ready we may not be in the proper shape to just be fitted in just yet listen he's still working on me I don't know about you but when the pressure comes when the load comes I'll be ready I'm trusting that amen there were all sorts of little details and I I I've been reading it in devotions and so I'm very familiar with with the details that went into this Temple and all sorts of little intricacies and little features the temple on on the walls they offset every stone by 3 mm backwards so that when you look up to it it doesn't look like it's going to fall on you you'd say why are we doing that to make people feel safer that's it has no structural benefit makes people feel safer that's it it's in the plan but you look at that Temple and it was the most beautiful building ever built they said the entire holy of holies was completely covered in Gold 100% representing deity and then he had more gold left over so he rolled it out into the holy place that's how much that's how beautiful it was can you imagine a place you go to The Basilica and you can see the gold details up in the ceiling it's it is beautiful imagine an entire room encased in Gold what that would look like amen but if someone tried to ignore the plan tried to ignore the drawings tried to ignore the instructions and then tried to put the temple together it would never fit it would never have worked exactly and they would have had to what do stop Gap measures they would have had to adjust on the Fly they would have had to use zip ties if you ever worked on a car in New Finland your favorite friend is is your zip tie because when something fails you just zip tie it together zip ties won't hold the Temple of the Living God they've got to be fitted perfectly amen and they had odd pieces they had odd-shaped pieces there can you imagine a foreman saying why do we need this odd-shaped piece why do we need this peculiar brother or sister can you imagine him arguing with Solomon who has the master plan this shouldn't be in this church Solomon would say where does it go I don't know it's just too weird to go but there's a place for it there's a position I've got for that little weird peace sometimes we wonder about people sometimes we wonder about ourselves why are we here what are we doing what's my part god has a place for your little peculiarity in the body of Christ God doesn't make mistakes two quotes as we close he says whether you see eye to eye like that doesn't matter we're at least Christians Brethren born in the same family God received us in our peculiarities we should receive each other he says and if God accepted you with your peculiarities and I with my peculiarities we should be thankful enough to recognize each other as brothers and sisters see and we're all working for one great purpose that's for his kingdom and anything different from that would be the wrong motive anyhow amen God bless you let's stand together if we would very pastoral this morning I'm trusting that's okay because in the end we are human we all have our little things that we do and don't do things we like things we don't like people we like people we don't like things we prefer things we wish weren't around we've got our own ideas we've got our own opinions but there's a master plan and that means there's a master planner a master designer that has looked down on this congregation and he has said they're here for purpose and you may not realize it yet but you're here for purpose and if you haven't realized it it doesn't mean you're not doing your purpose but sometimes it just takes God to open our eyes to say this is what you're supposed to do he would talk about sisters and he would say you have a gift of motherhood you know what this world's needs real mothers that's one of the greatest lacks we have because they're all in the workforce and Grandma's raising their kids or some daycare is raising their kids you've got a gift of motherhood to show this world to be a living tablet a living Stone of what it means to be a mother that may be your position but remember brother Bram says he says you're the Fifth Gospel in that position because you have more time with those kids to teach them about the things of God and raise them in the admonition and fear of God daddies don't have that time only mothers get that time he says you might be a mechanic you might be a farmer you might be this or that hey we're blessed to have brother Matt you know he's over there helping a friend of mine put in a mini split who of us can do that we can't he's here for purpose amen some of us are here for one thing that can be very spiritual and you know what we feel that that makes us better because we're and then somebody over there is doing the practical but guess what if all we do is spiritual and nothing practical the temple never got built right I will pray that you find the right Stones brother yeah but we need somebody to cut the stones we need somebody to to give the money well I would pray no no no we've got the spiritual side and we've got the Practical side and both of them are required in the body of Christ and you see that in the gifts the gifts are there to balance the Practical with the spiritual and it's not up to us to spiritualize anything or to put down those that are on the Practical side we've all got a purpose remember brother Gerald saying you you're so spiritual you're of no earthly good we've got to be real careful that we're so high up in our spirituality but we can't put a helping hand to our brother or sister put our shoulder to the wheel amen I'm not trying to be hard I'm trying to say this morning we've all got a part to play and it's all not going to seem like it's heavenbound it may not save a soul but it may give somebody else an opportunity to talk to that soul sometimes our friendship sometimes our help it opens the door for somebody to have an opportunity to work with that person that has a gift and that's it your your your part was to bring them in it's somebody else's part to bring them all the way to lead them into the water we've all got that part to play none of us any less critical than the other if you believe that we can do without somebody then I invite you to go home and choose which part of your body you don't want to have none of us would do it because we know it's all there even if we don't understand they say you can take your appendix out no big deal why cuz they never understood what it was for and they're still not sure what it's for they've got ideas but I'll tell you what you're better off with it than without it because God put it there for a reason if we even if we don't yet understand it amen God doesn't make mistakes you're not here by a chance you're not here even by your own choice you're here because the bill of materials in heaven called for you to be a part of the Temple of the Living God Amen God bless you let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord I pray you help us to find our place Lord that we would yield oursel to the Master's Hand Lord that we would yield our peculiarities our ideas our thoughts our motives our objectives our desires Lord and that above all would come out a willing heart that's willing to be led to obey to meet a need Lord I don't want to be the driver I don't want to be the leader Lord I want to walk with you as you lead Lord I believe that's the desire of every heart that's here and Lord you know what we all think of ourselves you know what we think of each other Lord I pray you help us to see ourselves in your plan to compare ourselves to what you would have for us not to the person next to us Lord God Lord help us to not look down on the other nor to lift each other up unnecessary Lord but help us to be humble before you Lord servants working together for the kingdom of God lord and as we see our part may you make us content in it Lord help us to be satisfied with the portion and the place that you've given us Lord as we surrender Our Lives to you Lord I pray there be Unity Lord your holy spirit is the unifying oil it makes every difference Lord we can't get by without it Lord and I pray you pour it out on us Lord your word says that by this shall all men that you're my disciples by your love one for another Lord I pray your love would unify us this morning Lord I pray you bless us even now as we go into the communion Lord may you strengthen us encourage us Lord may you bring healing or may you draw us closer together in bonds of love we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen The Potter's hand 1273 can we sing sing it like we mean it listen if you ever watch have you ever watched a Potter mold the clay you know how they start they take a lump and they just go it's all we are is a lump and then they start to poke it and probe it and shape it and shave it and do all these different things and it goes from a lump into of times this beautiful vase or this beautiful ear or cup or whatever they're making with all sorts of little fancy curves and details but it starts as a lump but if that that clay could resist it would say don't touch me leave me I want to just stay the way I am but he's turning us into something that's made that's beautiful that's useful what's a lump of clay good for throwing throwing at people that's all a glump of clay is good for but he turns us into something that somebody can use day in and day out he makes us fit for purpose but we've got to surrender to it cuz we have a will we have a will this body has a will and we've got to surrender that so that we can come into his perfect plan as it talks about let him shape us into what he wants us to be amen let's sing it if we really mean it Church let's sing it as we mean it beautiful Lord wonderful savior I know for sure all of my days are held in your hands and crafted into your perfect plan you gently call me into your presence guiding me by your Holy Spirit teach me dear Lord to

chorus 1052 sorry [Music] I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the things i' made it when it's all about you it's all about you Jesus and I'm com coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing i' made it and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm coming back to to the Heart of Worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it and it's all about you it's all about to Jesus I'm coming back to the heart Heart of Worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the things i' made it and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus amen we're going to change the order of the service now if you can turn in your scriptures 1 Corinthians chap 11 1 Corinthians chap 11 we'll start at verse 23 I'll read the first verse in the church the second or the next and we'll alternate then we'll all join together on the 34th verse and Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord the prophet of God would say there he says communion is a showdown then because you drink unworthily you've been living unworthily habitually is what that means listen we all make mistakes but if habitually we're off we're not supposed to take it unless we've made it right truly made it right not just made it right so we can come up and take the communion but made it right in our hearts and said Lord I don't want to be doing that Lord take that out of my life take that away otherwise he says you're drinking it unworthy and there's condemnation now instead of freedom and healing amen go ahead for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged let me hold it there self- discernment is the greatest discernment you can have because remember what Jesus said he says you look at your brother and you say let help me get the sliver out of your eye and he says and you can't see the beam in your own those Pharisees were so religious but they had no self-d discernment they couldn't judge themselves by the word the opportunity for us is to judge ourselves by the word so that we're not judged later if we can say Lord that's where I'm at Lord this is where I'm at this is what I have this is what's going on he can deal with it but our discernment is meant first to look inwardly because only when we're clean can we help somebody else only when we've been delivered can we help somebody else be delivered you got to freely get it before you can give it that's and so our discernment when it comes to communion is not on what somebody else has done or not done it's Lord where am I according to your word and we discern it and we judge ourselves by the word so that he doesn't have to come down in correction amen continue if you would not wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come we're going to sing that song as we come for communion we're going to have the sisters to my left the brothers to my right we're going to sing that song Thank You Jesus for the grace that you have given as we come and prepare to take the bread and the wine amen you can turn off the uh stream as well brother V
