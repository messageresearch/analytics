[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus.
[42:10] Lord, we're thankful for salvation
[42:12] tonight. Lord, we're thankful for the
[42:14] finished work of Calvary,
[42:18] Lord. But you sent your spirit back to
[42:20] be Lord of our lives,
[42:22] Lord, to come in and take authority,
[42:26] Lord. Not take it, Lord, but be given
[42:28] it, Lord. That we could surrender
[42:30] ourselves to you.
[42:32] But Lord, we've got a choice to make
[42:34] today and every single day, Lord. and
[42:37] that's to invite you into our
[42:38] situations. Lord, you're a gentleman.
[42:41] You don't come in unless we ask you. But
[42:44] Lord, we're here tonight, Lord, just by
[42:45] grace, Lord, not just singing a song,
[42:48] Lord, but trusting it's the cry of our
[42:50] heart, Lord, that you are our Lord,
[42:52] Lord. That we want you in our lives day
[42:54] in and day out. That we want you to have
[42:56] the preeminence, that we want you to
[42:57] make the decisions, Lord. That we want
[43:00] you to be the one that's at the center
[43:02] and the head of our lives, each one.
[43:04] Lord, I pray that once again you'll take
[43:06] your word again this evening. Lord,
[43:08] you'll speak into our lives. You see the
[43:10] burden on my heart. Lord, Lord, you see
[43:12] the things that I've been praying about.
[43:15] Lord, we're trusting your grace to just
[43:16] speak again tonight. Lord, help us to
[43:19] see ourselves. Lord, help us to see
[43:20] where we need to step up, Lord, and
[43:23] where we need to step away. Lord, grant
[43:25] us grace to just let you have your way
[43:27] once again this night. In Jesus Christ's
[43:29] name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[43:32] you. Turn if you would to Romans chapter
[43:35] 1.
[43:37] Romans chapter 1. Amen. We'll start in
[43:41] verse 28. Romans 1:28. Good to see each
[43:45] one of you here tonight. Amen. God bless
[43:47] you. It's always good to be in the house
[43:49] of the Lord with believers.
[43:51] Amen. Not everyone has this opportunity
[43:55] either. Not everyone has a church
[43:56] building. Not everyone has believers.
[43:58] Amen. And so we're blessed to still have
[43:59] each other and have these freedoms even
[44:01] now to come and gather and preach things
[44:03] that are heresy to just about the rest
[44:05] of the world. Amen. Amen. Trusting we're
[44:08] enjoying our heresy tonight.
[44:11] I'm sorry, but after the conversations
[44:13] I've had over the past couple of months,
[44:14] it's it's it's uh easy to see why people
[44:19] think that we're just a little bit
[44:20] different. Amen. But we're trusting
[44:23] that's the spirit of God that's leading
[44:24] us here tonight. Amen. Romans 1:28. Now,
[44:28] this is Paul and and just for the sake
[44:30] of time, I'm not going to read the the
[44:32] preceding scriptures, but he's talking
[44:33] about those that lean to their own
[44:34] imaginations of God and his word rather
[44:37] than humbling themselves to it. And this
[44:39] is the end result of pretended
[44:40] believers. Now, he says, "And even as
[44:43] they did not like to retain God in their
[44:45] knowledge," in other words, they didn't
[44:46] like to consider God or his word or
[44:48] acknowledge him, God gave them over to a
[44:50] reprobate mind to do those things which
[44:53] are not convenient. Now, that word
[44:54] convenient is not our word convenient.
[44:56] It says to do those things which are not
[44:58] fit or are unbecoming. He says being
[45:01] filled with all unrighteousness. Now
[45:04] they've not considered God. So watch
[45:05] what comes in now. They're filled with
[45:07] all unrighteousness, fornication,
[45:09] wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[45:12] full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
[45:15] malignity, whisperers, backbiters,
[45:17] haters of God, despiteful, proud,
[45:20] boasters, inventors of evil things,
[45:22] disobedient to parents.
[45:25] That seems a bit of an odd one to throw
[45:27] in there after all those things.
[45:29] Children, listen up. Disobedient to
[45:30] parents, he throws it right in there
[45:32] with backbiters and murderers and
[45:33] malicious gossip and all those different
[45:35] things. Without understanding, covenant
[45:38] breakers, without natural affection,
[45:40] implacable, unmerciful, who knowing the
[45:44] judgment of God, that they which commit
[45:47] such things are worthy of death, not
[45:49] only do the same, but they have pleasure
[45:52] in them that do them. total insanity,
[45:55] total disregard for the consequences of
[45:57] the decisions that they're making. Amen.
[46:00] God bless you. You can have your seats
[46:01] once again this evening. And we're
[46:03] considering this thought again of an
[46:04] echo chamber gospel. And there's both
[46:06] some teaching and preaching in these
[46:08] services. And honestly, I don't know
[46:10] which way a service is going to go.
[46:11] Sometimes I come out firing and some
[46:13] days I come out just layback and
[46:15] easygoing. But the point here is that
[46:17] we're not here to preach to those people
[46:18] that aren't here. And sometimes it's so
[46:21] easy to look at these things and and and
[46:23] say, "Well, that's for other churches or
[46:25] that's for denominations." But I'm not
[46:27] preaching to them. I'm preaching to us.
[46:29] Amen. Because we're preaching on a
[46:30] spirit that's alive and well and it's
[46:32] trying to get into our lives. So the
[46:34] goal in preaching this is for us to not
[46:36] look around. Amen. But to look into our
[46:38] own lives and see, is my life reflecting
[46:40] the influence of a spirit like we've
[46:42] been talking about. Amen. I don't want
[46:44] us to listen for an ear for everyone
[46:45] else. I want to hear us to be listening
[46:47] with an ear for ourselves. The scripture
[46:49] says, "He that hath an ear, for
[46:51] himself." Amen. The instruction is for
[46:53] he that hath an ear. And we opened up
[46:55] with a pretty hard scripture this
[46:57] evening. It's I think everyone when we
[46:59] read scriptures like that to start, they
[47:00] say, "Here it goes again." It's going to
[47:02] be one of those services. But the
[47:04] intention is not to to beat us up. Amen.
[47:06] But it's to show us what happens in the
[47:09] end result when we walk away from God.
[47:11] When we walk away from acknowledging or
[47:13] considering God or his word. And last
[47:15] service, you remember we talked at the
[47:16] very end about the disappointment of a
[47:19] of a religious spirit. Amen. The
[47:21] deceitfulness of religious spirit.
[47:23] Remember we read that quote where he
[47:24] said, "Listen, the prostitute, the
[47:26] drunk, the thief, they're not going to
[47:27] be surprised at the white judgment,
[47:29] white throne judgment. They're not going
[47:31] to be surprised. They know what kind of
[47:32] life they lived." He says, "But there's
[47:34] going to be a people that's going to be
[47:35] disappointed when the verdict's read
[47:37] out, and they are professing Christians
[47:39] that are going to stand and say, "God,
[47:41] didn't I do all these things in your
[47:42] name?" He says, "Yes, you did them in my
[47:44] name, but it was your doing." Amen. It
[47:47] was a walk of their own doing. It was
[47:48] doing your own thing in my name. You
[47:51] were just taking my name as a cover for
[47:52] it. But this was all driven by
[47:55] self-will. Amen. So we want to take a
[47:56] look tonight at least in part of the
[47:58] journey that took the true church of God
[48:01] from being the the the peak of the
[48:04] expression of Christ the word the living
[48:07] word that original church age the lion
[48:10] age where God was working perfectly
[48:12] through his church and how it broke it
[48:13] down into the mess that we see today
[48:15] throughout the rest of this world. Amen.
[48:17] And like I said we're we're not looking
[48:19] at anyone else tonight. We're looking at
[48:21] ourselves because we're in a restoration
[48:23] process. But the spirit that's been
[48:24] working has not died. It has not gone
[48:26] away. And it is more powerful today than
[48:29] it's ever been. I was listening to
[48:30] brother Brandham the other day and the
[48:31] people said, "Brother Brandon, why is it
[48:33] that we can't pray the way we used to?
[48:35] Why is it that we can't just seem to
[48:37] commit ourselves the way that people
[48:38] used to? Why are the services not the
[48:40] way they used to do?" He says, "It's
[48:42] because darkness is coming in. The
[48:44] spirit of the Lord is pulling away from
[48:46] the earth. And you've got to fight that
[48:48] much harder just to hold your ground.
[48:51] just to hold your ground, much less to
[48:53] make any advance on the enemy to come
[48:55] into an overcoming place. Amen. So, we
[48:57] have to overcome this spirit and it's
[48:59] still alive and it's still well. I mean,
[49:00] too often we're looking for the the
[49:02] weird doctrines and the the odd
[49:04] preachers and the commandments of men
[49:06] and those things and we forget that
[49:07] every single one of us can come up with
[49:09] those own things ourselves. We can so
[49:11] busy looking be busy looking outside at
[49:14] everyone else and trying to protect
[49:15] ourselves from everyone else that we
[49:17] don't realize that we can come up and we
[49:18] can make up our own commandments of men,
[49:20] our own doctrines, our own ideas and we
[49:22] can become a oneman or a onewoman
[49:24] denomination to ourselves. That's
[49:26] exactly the way it can be. So, I want us
[49:28] to start this evening with what the
[49:30] church was supposed to be and then move
[49:32] forward by God's grace to see how the
[49:34] spirit uh uh uh uh of religion came in,
[49:36] how Satan's spirit came in and how it
[49:39] caused them to fall and and the results
[49:41] of that. Now, Paul would say this in
[49:42] Ephesians 4. Now, remember Ephesians was
[49:44] Paul's church, 12 people church, but
[49:48] this is the Joshua church. It's the
[49:50] overcoming church. It's the one that
[49:52] reflects the true identity of Christ the
[49:54] word. And Paul says, "There I therefore
[49:56] the prisoner of the Lord beseech you
[49:58] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[50:01] wherewith you are called." In other
[50:03] words, he's saying, "Live what you've
[50:04] been taught." God's put a calling in
[50:07] your life to be sons and daughters of
[50:08] God. Live like it. He says, "With all
[50:12] loneliness and meekness, with
[50:14] longsuffering, forbearing one another in
[50:16] love." Attitude shows a whole lot,
[50:18] church. And Paul starts with our
[50:20] attitude. Amen. Look at what he says. He
[50:22] says loneliness and meekness. Now the
[50:25] words directly translated are humility
[50:28] and gentleness. And then after that he
[50:30] says take that and and put some patience
[50:32] in there. And then after that he says
[50:34] add some law some forebearing some
[50:36] tolerance with each other's
[50:38] shortcomings. And the church of the
[50:40] living God said
[50:42] uh lackluster. Amen. And the church of
[50:45] the living God said
[50:46] &gt;&gt; amen. That's right. Some tolerance for
[50:48] each other. some grace for where the
[50:50] other person's at in their walk. Cuz
[50:52] guess what? We're not all up there with
[50:54] brother Gerald and brother Bob, are we?
[50:57] We're not. We've got young people.
[50:58] They're not the same as mom and dad. I
[51:00] really appreciate when brother Paul
[51:01] Fontaine was here and he said, "Listen,
[51:03] sometimes what your kids are doing looks
[51:04] like rebellion, but it's them learning
[51:06] to find their way with God." And we've
[51:08] got to be able to let people grow. We've
[51:10] got to let people mature. We've got to
[51:11] let God deal with them as sons and
[51:13] daughters of God. Amen. It takes
[51:15] tolerance. Not tolerance for unbelief
[51:18] but tolerance for God to do a work in
[51:21] their life. Amen. He says endeavoring,
[51:24] in other words, really trying,
[51:27] really working at it, diligently doing
[51:29] this to keep the unity of the spirit in
[51:33] the bond of peace. Now, can I say that
[51:35] too many times? What we do is we
[51:37] endeavor to keep the bond of peace. In
[51:40] other words, we're trying to get along
[51:41] with each other. That's not what Paul
[51:43] tells us to do. He says, "No, get in
[51:46] alignment with the Holy Spirit, and that
[51:48] will produce peace in the body of
[51:50] Christ." See, too often if we're trying
[51:52] to get along with each other, that's
[51:54] where compromise comes in. But it's when
[51:57] we can get in alignment with the spirit,
[51:59] that's where our unity is. Amen. Because
[52:01] when we're under the same headship, when
[52:03] we're under the same command structure,
[52:05] there can't be disorder, there can't be
[52:07] chaos, there can't be disunityity.
[52:09] Because God is not the author of
[52:10] confusion. He's not the author of
[52:12] contradiction. And so if you're being
[52:14] led by the spirit and I'm being led by
[52:16] the spirit, it has to go together
[52:17] seamlessly and perfectly. And that's
[52:19] what brings the bond of peace is
[52:21] catching what the spirit is saying to
[52:22] the church. Not coming up with your own
[52:24] ideas. Amen. Now watch what this looks
[52:27] like. This is the unity of the spirit in
[52:29] the bond of peace. He says, "There is
[52:31] one body, one spirit, even as you are
[52:35] called in one hope of your calling, one
[52:37] Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
[52:40] and Father of all, who is above all and
[52:42] through all and in you all." Now look at
[52:44] this list. He's literally saying one
[52:46] thing over and over again. What is it?
[52:49] He says it is one spirit, one hope, one
[52:53] Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
[52:56] and father of all. Amen. It's one body.
[52:58] It's Christ the word.
[53:01] It's not a church here and a church
[53:02] there. It's a body. Okay. He says it's
[53:05] one spirit. It's the Holy Spirit.
[53:07] There's one baptism. There's only one
[53:08] baptism and that's in the name of the
[53:10] Lord Jesus Christ. That's Acts 2:38.
[53:14] Amen. There's only one thing. There's
[53:16] one faith and that faith is in the
[53:17] finished work of Calvary by Christ. And
[53:20] there's only one God and father. And yet
[53:23] when you look today, what do we have? We
[53:24] don't have one body. We have 30,000
[53:27] professing Christian churches.
[53:29] You know what? We don't have just a Holy
[53:33] Spirit. We've got a father, son, and
[53:35] Holy Spirit. We don't have one God.
[53:37] We've got three gods. We don't have one
[53:39] baptism. We've got multiple baptisms.
[53:41] And some of them aren't even baptisms.
[53:45] We don't have a father. We have God the
[53:47] mother. And we have God the whatever
[53:49] relative you want him to make. I'm not
[53:51] being funny up here tonight. Those are
[53:53] exact words I've heard from claim
[53:55] pastors of Christianity. Sometimes God
[53:58] is a godf God is a an uncle to me.
[54:00] Sometimes he's a grandfather. Sometimes
[54:02] he's a mother. I've literally heard a
[54:03] pastor say that.
[54:05] That's where we've come. Why? Because
[54:08] they're not in the unity of the spirit.
[54:10] They're in the unity of man. And that's
[54:12] where it takes us down is to a place
[54:14] where the gospel is not preached at all.
[54:16] Amen. We've got people that have faith
[54:18] in speaking tongues, faith in the
[54:20] Catholic church, faith in the Baptist
[54:21] church, faith in the in whatever church
[54:23] you pick, faith in the message church.
[54:26] Amen. They've got faith in the fact that
[54:28] they have believed, faith that they've
[54:29] spoken in tongues, faith that they had
[54:31] an experience at camp, but they don't
[54:33] have faith in the finished work of
[54:34] Calvary that brings them to a place of
[54:36] genuine repentance, baptism in the name
[54:38] of Jesus Christ, and the infilling of
[54:40] the spirit, which is what is supposed to
[54:42] be the end result of it all. Amen. We've
[54:44] got all of this stuff that's come around
[54:46] this. Amen. And what has it produced?
[54:48] It's produced nothing but confusion.
[54:50] Nothing but confusion. Amen. The whole
[54:53] thing has splintered up into so many
[54:55] fragments, none of which are the word of
[54:57] God. And it all started with the spirit
[54:59] to divide and conquer the church. Amen.
[55:02] It started in sa in Eid Eden where Satan
[55:05] took Eve. And he didn't just separate
[55:07] her from her husband. He separated her
[55:09] from the word. And when he separated her
[55:11] from the word, she fell. Amen. But she
[55:14] had this idea. She had this idea that
[55:16] she said, "I can improve my standing. I
[55:19] can improve what I am. I can improve on
[55:22] what God has decided." And she was
[55:25] beguiled. She was seduced by the idea
[55:27] that what she could come up with was
[55:29] better than what God had ordained by
[55:30] her. And she walked headlong into
[55:32] destruction and death.
[55:36] What was the seduction based on? Making
[55:38] her think it was good for her. It was
[55:41] better for her than what God had told
[55:43] her was already good for her. That's the
[55:45] trap. And what is the antidote, church?
[55:47] The antidote is what it's always been.
[55:49] Stay with the word. It's always been
[55:51] stay with the word. We make it so
[55:52] difficult so many times, but literally
[55:54] the antidote is take it back to the
[55:56] word. Doesn't matter how good it's going
[55:57] to feel, how good you think it is, how
[55:59] much it makes sense. Take it back to the
[56:02] word. Pull your decisions through the
[56:04] word. Pull your priorities through the
[56:06] word. Pull your family through the word.
[56:09] Pull your choices through the word and
[56:11] it will always come out right if you do
[56:13] it honestly and sincerely. That's the
[56:15] only way it's going to work. Amen. Pull
[56:16] your time commitments through the word
[56:18] and it'll put you exactly in the balance
[56:20] that you need for your life. That's the
[56:23] way that it works. Amen. We can get so
[56:25] caught up in things being good for me or
[56:27] good for my family and we forget that
[56:28] God has something that's great for us
[56:31] too often. Yeah. You know, I was reading
[56:33] in my devotions the other morning where
[56:34] Jesus said, "Listen, I haven't come to
[56:36] to to make the family knit together." He
[56:38] said, "I've come to draw put a sword
[56:40] between them." Because too often what we
[56:42] are is we're pulled by those that are
[56:44] around us.
[56:46] And that can be our own family,
[56:48] believing family. We can be pulled to do
[56:50] things for them that are contrary to the
[56:52] word because we want to please them.
[56:55] Remember what Paul said? He said, "I
[56:57] would that all of you were like me,"
[56:59] which is no longer married or not
[57:01] married. He said, "Why?" He says,
[57:04] "Because when you're not married, your
[57:05] life is is given to God."
[57:08] But he says, "When you're married, the
[57:10] man to a wife, then you're you're
[57:12] interested in pleasing your wife. And if
[57:14] you're a wife, then you're interested in
[57:16] pleasing your husband." And the problem
[57:17] is that sometimes God is left completely
[57:19] out of that.
[57:22] You got to pull your commitments. You
[57:23] got to pull your decisions, your desires
[57:25] through the word because what's good for
[57:27] your family may not be good for God. It
[57:30] may not be according to his word and it
[57:31] may not have the results that you're
[57:33] looking for. The word is our protection.
[57:35] It's always been our protection. Amen.
[57:37] And that's a battle. That's an everyday
[57:39] battle for us to stay uh sharp on these
[57:41] things and say, "Hey, is this God
[57:43] leading me or is this me being led
[57:45] around by the desire to please or to
[57:47] satisfy somebody that matters a lot to
[57:49] me." Paul would say this in 2
[57:51] Corinthians. He says, "For though we
[57:52] walk in the flesh, we do not war after
[57:54] the flesh. For the weapons of our
[57:56] warfare are not carnal." In other words,
[57:58] the victory that we are supposed to get
[58:00] is not going to come through based on
[58:01] what we think is right.
[58:04] It's not based on what we think or what
[58:05] we feel or even what we think that we
[58:07] know, but it's based on one thing. He
[58:10] says they are mighty through God to the
[58:12] pulling down of strongholds. How does it
[58:14] work? It's by casting down imaginations.
[58:18] Imaginations are what I think.
[58:21] and every high thing that exalteth
[58:24] itself against the knowledge of God and
[58:26] bringeth into captivity every thought to
[58:30] the obedience of Christ. Now, he did not
[58:33] say if you're a believer, you don't have
[58:35] to bring every thought subject. You only
[58:37] have to bring the thoughts of those that
[58:38] are outside the church into subjection.
[58:41] No, he says you have to bring every
[58:44] thought, you have to bring every thought
[58:47] subject to the obedience of Christ,
[58:49] which is what? What is the will of the
[58:51] father? That's what we have to do. We
[58:54] can presume too much, church. I'm sorry
[58:56] if I'm a bit fired up this evening, but
[58:59] we can presume too much on the fact that
[59:01] we're a believer to think that our
[59:03] thoughts are always right. That's why we
[59:05] have to read our word, our Bible. The
[59:06] scripture says we're forgetful hearers.
[59:09] We don't remember the balance. And so
[59:11] we've got to stay in that day in and day
[59:13] out all the more as the day approaches
[59:15] because Satan's going around pushing
[59:18] harder and harder and harder to try and
[59:20] break this pride, to try and get into
[59:22] our life to try and drive a wedge there
[59:24] that gets between us and Christ. And
[59:26] when he drives in a wedge, he starts to
[59:28] hammer that harder and harder until he
[59:30] splits our life open. We have to be so
[59:32] careful. Amen. God's word is his will.
[59:37] It is not what I feel in prayer. It has
[59:39] to be according to his word. It cannot
[59:41] contradict his word. We read last
[59:43] service how Satan's going around like a
[59:45] roaring ri lion. And we talked about
[59:47] that's a false ministry. A roaring lion
[59:50] is a prophetic ministry. It's an
[59:51] anointed, a truly anointed ministry. But
[59:53] he goes around, he has his false
[59:55] ministers with a false anointing
[59:57] preaching a false gospel that's
[59:59] word-based.
[1:00:02] You know, sometimes people share these
[1:00:04] things with me.
[1:00:07] And I I I've seen it even from mature
[1:00:09] believers and they'll share things with
[1:00:10] me that, you know, through social media
[1:00:12] and these things and it'll be, you know,
[1:00:13] just a saying that's written down by by
[1:00:15] who knows who. And on the face of it, it
[1:00:18] sounds good. And you think, "Oh, yeah,
[1:00:20] that's good." But when you bring it down
[1:00:22] to the word, it doesn't hold up, but
[1:00:25] it's satisfying to the flesh to say that
[1:00:28] because so many times we can say, "Hey,
[1:00:29] I like that." Or even, "I do that." But
[1:00:32] when you take it down to a sharp point,
[1:00:33] it doesn't quite line up with the word.
[1:00:35] It's right in portion, but it's not
[1:00:37] truth. We have to be so careful, church.
[1:00:40] We shouldn't get our Christianity from
[1:00:41] memes we read on social media.
[1:00:45] I I'm seeing some grins here, guilty
[1:00:48] smiles perhaps,
[1:00:50] but we can get caught up in how
[1:00:52] something sounds good and feels good and
[1:00:55] we forget. We've got to take it right
[1:00:57] back to the word and see whether or not
[1:00:58] that truly matches up. Amen.
[1:01:03] I wanted to just drop a quote in here
[1:01:05] that I had sitting in my notes for a
[1:01:07] while because we're talking about
[1:01:09] bringing all things subject to the word.
[1:01:11] And the hardest time is when we're under
[1:01:12] pressure. When we're under time
[1:01:14] pressure, when we we don't seem to have
[1:01:16] the time to to come through and really
[1:01:18] get in prayer before God. Amen. And I'll
[1:01:20] tell you, when you're in a time of
[1:01:21] pressure, that's not the time to be
[1:01:23] uncertain. You've got to be prayed up.
[1:01:26] We don't know when the pressure is going
[1:01:27] to hit. Pressure is coming all the time,
[1:01:29] but we never know when the heavy
[1:01:30] pressure is going to hit. We need to be
[1:01:31] prayed up. I love how Brother Bram says
[1:01:33] when David came to Goliath, he was
[1:01:35] already prayed up. That's the way we
[1:01:37] want to be. We want to be ready for the
[1:01:38] battle before the battle starts, not
[1:01:40] coming into the battle and saying,
[1:01:41] "Uhoh, wish I had devotions this week."
[1:01:45] Amen. Brother says this. He says, "The
[1:01:47] Bible said in the last days that the
[1:01:49] devil will go about like a roaring
[1:01:50] line." He says, "And if he could get you
[1:01:53] under pressure,
[1:01:54] hurrying, running over something, you
[1:01:57] will make decisions you wouldn't make if
[1:01:59] you'd sit down and think it over."
[1:02:03] Satan's goal is to get us reacting in
[1:02:04] the moment. Snap decisions based on gut
[1:02:08] feel. Not saying your gut feel is wrong,
[1:02:10] but you ought to have time to check it
[1:02:12] with the word and say, "What is really
[1:02:13] going on here? What is really going on
[1:02:15] in this situation?" Amen. If you got a
[1:02:18] fast decision to make, church, I hope
[1:02:19] you're prayed up and I hope you've been
[1:02:21] in the word. Because if you don't,
[1:02:23] Satan's going to get you to take that
[1:02:24] wrong decision. Being a believer that's
[1:02:26] not prayed up and not in the word
[1:02:28] doesn't do a whole lot for you, church.
[1:02:30] What it means is God's probably going to
[1:02:32] drag you out of something you got into.
[1:02:35] Better to stay out of it in the first
[1:02:37] place. Stay prayed up. Stay ready to go.
[1:02:39] Stay ready to fight. Brother Brand would
[1:02:41] say follow instruction, not the emotion.
[1:02:44] He says the instructions. If Moses would
[1:02:46] have followed the emotions of the
[1:02:47] people, they'd have been running all
[1:02:49] over the mountain screaming and
[1:02:50] Pharaoh's army would have got them. But
[1:02:52] they followed instruction. God said,
[1:02:54] "Stand still now and see the glory of
[1:02:56] God." Just stand still. You don't have
[1:02:58] to excite it. Stand still and see the
[1:03:00] glory of God for this day God will fight
[1:03:03] and you'll stand still. He says they
[1:03:05] just walked across the sea. Then the
[1:03:07] uncircumcised, them impersonators tried
[1:03:10] to do so. They drowned in the sea.
[1:03:14] Stand still.
[1:03:18] Scripture says when the enemy comes in
[1:03:19] like a flood, the spirit of God will
[1:03:21] raise up a standard. It'll hold your
[1:03:23] position. You don't have to hold it.
[1:03:26] It'll hold you for it. You just have to
[1:03:28] let him do the work. Amen. You have to
[1:03:30] go to him and say, "All right, Lord.
[1:03:31] We're in a battle. Let's hold position
[1:03:33] now until you show me which way to go
[1:03:34] forward. And when you say go forward,
[1:03:36] we're going forward. And nothing's going
[1:03:38] to stop us in those situations." But I
[1:03:40] want us to see this this evening how
[1:03:42] Satan moves to divide and conquer. And
[1:03:45] remember that within the church, he uses
[1:03:47] men. He uses ministers. He uses a
[1:03:49] twisted gospel. And he did it with Eve.
[1:03:52] And he's doing it today. And we've
[1:03:53] gotten to the place where people will
[1:03:55] quote the scripture and then interpret
[1:03:58] exactly opposite to what it says in
[1:04:00] clear English. That's how powerful the
[1:04:02] spirit is we're talking about. Now, you
[1:04:04] say, "That can't be here, church. I've
[1:04:06] heard message believers do the exact
[1:04:09] same thing. That's how powerful that
[1:04:11] spirit is. Somebody reminded me the
[1:04:13] other day of something Brother Mark had
[1:04:14] heard on the radio and it was a woman
[1:04:16] preacher and she said, "Aside from what
[1:04:18] Paul said, the Bible doesn't say
[1:04:20] anything about women preachers."
[1:04:22] Can you imagine saying that? Basically,
[1:04:25] she's saying, "Aside from what is in the
[1:04:26] Bible about women preachers, there's
[1:04:28] nothing in the Bible about women
[1:04:29] preachers." That's like saying aside
[1:04:32] from the speed limit sign on the side of
[1:04:34] the road, there's nothing that tells me
[1:04:36] whether how fast I can go on the road.
[1:04:38] When the cop pulls you over, that's not
[1:04:39] going to be anything that he's going to
[1:04:40] take as a valid excuse, is it? Why? Cuz
[1:04:43] you ignored what was right in front of
[1:04:44] you. But you know what it is, church?
[1:04:47] She thinks Paul said it.
[1:04:49] Paul didn't say it. The Holy Spirit said
[1:04:51] it. Amen. That's what we have to
[1:04:53] realize. Amen. I I I had shared last
[1:04:56] service about that clip about that or or
[1:04:58] I commented on a on a person that said,
[1:05:00] you know, I don't we don't preach much
[1:05:02] of Paul here very much because he says
[1:05:04] the hardest things in the worst possible
[1:05:05] ways. And I played the whole clip for
[1:05:07] some people later on in that and it was
[1:05:08] actually worse than I remembered. But
[1:05:11] can you imagine saying we don't preach
[1:05:13] the Bible?
[1:05:15] He see that's how they say we don't
[1:05:17] preach Paul.
[1:05:19] But Paul said there's no other gospel
[1:05:20] given than what I've given you. So what
[1:05:22] they're saying is we don't preach the
[1:05:24] gospel very often because it says
[1:05:25] harshest things in the worst possible
[1:05:27] way. Well, it's only hard and in the
[1:05:29] worst possible way if it offends you.
[1:05:31] Otherwise, it's the greatest thing that
[1:05:32] you can hear. It's a pearl of great
[1:05:34] price. It's the greatest treasure that
[1:05:36] we have. Amen. Now, watch how the spirit
[1:05:38] works. Now, we're going to go into the
[1:05:40] church ages just for a little bit
[1:05:41] tonight. More of teaching than preaching
[1:05:43] perhaps. But but but the the scripture
[1:05:45] says unto the angel of the church of
[1:05:46] Ephesus, right? These things, now this
[1:05:49] is the biggest and the best of the
[1:05:50] churches. Okay.
[1:05:53] He says the these things sayaith he that
[1:05:54] holdeth the seven stars in his right
[1:05:56] hand who walketh in the midst of the go
[1:05:58] seven golden candlesticks Christ.
[1:06:00] He says I know thy works and thy labor
[1:06:02] and thy patience and how thou canst not
[1:06:05] bear them which are evil and thou hast
[1:06:07] tried them which say they are apostles
[1:06:09] and are not and has found them liars. So
[1:06:11] there were people that were pretending
[1:06:12] to be apostles but it was their claim
[1:06:15] and it wasn't backed up by a life that
[1:06:17] matched up with the calling of an
[1:06:18] apostle. Amen. How did they judge these
[1:06:21] people? By the word. They judged them by
[1:06:23] the word. That's always by the word. He
[1:06:25] says, "And you have borne and hast
[1:06:27] patience and for my name's sake hast
[1:06:29] labored and has not fainted." This is a
[1:06:31] this is a good report card. But then he
[1:06:33] says, "Nevertheless, I have somewhat
[1:06:35] against thee because thou hast left thy
[1:06:38] first love." Church, who is their first
[1:06:40] love? Christ. Christ is the word. Amen.
[1:06:44] His his identification is always with
[1:06:46] the word. John 1:1 says, "In the
[1:06:48] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:06:50] with God. The word was God. And the word
[1:06:52] was made flesh and dwelt among us. When
[1:06:54] he comes back in Revelation 19 and he's
[1:06:57] on his he's coming down with 10,000 by
[1:06:59] 10,000 of his saints, he's got his name
[1:07:01] written on his thigh and it says his
[1:07:02] name is the word of God. You cannot
[1:07:05] separate Christ from the word. And
[1:07:08] that's what they've done. They've se
[1:07:10] separated Christianity from the word.
[1:07:13] And you can't be Christian without the
[1:07:14] word. You can't be Christlike without
[1:07:16] the word because he is the word. Okay.
[1:07:19] But they left Christ. Amen. They they
[1:07:21] lost something in their He didn't say
[1:07:23] they left him. He says they've left
[1:07:25] their first love. Now remember we read
[1:07:27] last service where we where Jesus said,
[1:07:29] "If you continue in my word, then are
[1:07:32] you my disciples indeed." And that word
[1:07:34] continue was abiding. Amen. So if you
[1:07:36] stick with the word, if you stick with
[1:07:38] Christ the word, keep growing, keep
[1:07:41] maturing. It's not just an experience,
[1:07:43] but it's a continuation of what you
[1:07:46] started. If you keep doing that, that's
[1:07:49] the proof that you're really a disciple.
[1:07:51] That's proof that you're really a child
[1:07:52] of God. Who is my first love naturally
[1:07:55] speaking?
[1:07:58] Is Blanca. It is my wife. That's my
[1:08:01] first love. Now, I had many, many
[1:08:03] crushes before her. But she's the only
[1:08:07] one I've loved. She's the only one I've
[1:08:10] committed myself to. She's the only one
[1:08:12] I've given myself to. She is my first
[1:08:14] love.
[1:08:16] And that's the only one there is. But
[1:08:18] did you know that I can leave my first
[1:08:20] love and never leave my marriage?
[1:08:23] Now I have your attention, don't I?
[1:08:27] All the sisters are saying, "Maybe I can
[1:08:28] get him with this." Now the brothers are
[1:08:31] saying, "I hope he doesn't pin me to the
[1:08:32] wall with this.
[1:08:35] I can leave my first love and never
[1:08:36] leave my wife and never leave my
[1:08:38] marriage." How?
[1:08:41] I can put something else above her.
[1:08:45] Now we're speaking naturally, okay?
[1:08:46] Christ is above all. He ought to be in
[1:08:48] our lives. But second in my life is
[1:08:50] always my wife. Not my children, my
[1:08:52] wife. She is my first love. There are a
[1:08:55] very distant second to her. And don't
[1:08:58] forget that
[1:09:01] she's my first love. But what happens is
[1:09:03] when I put when I work too hard, when I
[1:09:07] play too hard, when I get distracted too
[1:09:10] much, when I have too many hobbies,
[1:09:13] when I study too much,
[1:09:16] when I do any of those things and I put
[1:09:19] her below those things, what am I doing?
[1:09:21] I'm leaving my first love and giving
[1:09:23] that love to something else. I'm giving
[1:09:25] it the majority of my time, my
[1:09:27] attention, my priority, my commitment.
[1:09:31] That's leaving my first love. Amen. That
[1:09:34] word left does not mean it walked out
[1:09:36] the door. It doesn't mean that they left
[1:09:38] Christ. It means that word left means to
[1:09:41] let it slide backwards, to let it go, to
[1:09:44] omit it, to send it away, to neglect it,
[1:09:47] to allow it to degenerate. And this is
[1:09:50] what brother Brandon would say about
[1:09:52] this. He says, "What's the matter with
[1:09:53] the tabernacle?" He says, "A man ought
[1:09:56] to be able to say when you meet a man in
[1:09:58] your Christian experience, when was it
[1:10:00] dearest to you?" He says, "You ought to
[1:10:02] be able to say right now."
[1:10:07] He says, "Well, my best experience was
[1:10:09] back when I first got the baptism of the
[1:10:10] Holy Spirit when I came to Christ." And
[1:10:12] say, "Oh, brother, you've fallen from
[1:10:15] grace." That's right. Look, remember,
[1:10:18] standing still is backsliding to a
[1:10:20] believer. We are always to be going
[1:10:22] forward. We're always to be growing.
[1:10:24] We're always to be maturing in our
[1:10:27] relationship with Christ. He says, "They
[1:10:29] have left, thou hast left thy first
[1:10:31] love, showing they had something in the
[1:10:33] beginning and have left it." He says,
[1:10:35] "It's not he that beginth, but he that
[1:10:38] endureth to the end, the same shall be
[1:10:40] saved." Now, we can go back to our first
[1:10:42] days or first weeks or first months,
[1:10:44] maybe first year of marriage, and we
[1:10:46] know how new it was, how fun it was, how
[1:10:49] exciting it was. Amen.
[1:10:51] Okay. Me and Brother Bob,
[1:10:54] the rest of you didn't have any fun.
[1:10:56] Nothing was new. Nothing was exciting.
[1:10:58] Now, now you're smiling. Okay, you're
[1:11:00] with me.
[1:11:02] Now, I'll tell you this.
[1:11:05] You're never going to get that feeling
[1:11:08] again. It's not the same. There's only a
[1:11:12] first time once.
[1:11:15] And so, when you're newly married,
[1:11:17] everything's new. All of a sudden,
[1:11:19] you're spending all this time with a
[1:11:20] person that you only got a few moments
[1:11:23] with, a few hours with, a few weeks
[1:11:24] with, you know, throughout your life and
[1:11:26] these different things. Now, every
[1:11:27] everywhere you go, everything you do,
[1:11:29] that person is there. Whether you want
[1:11:30] them there or not, everything's new. The
[1:11:32] good, the bad, and the ugly. You're
[1:11:35] never going to get that feeling back.
[1:11:37] But I can say this that after 24 years,
[1:11:41] we've moved from being in love to
[1:11:44] loving.
[1:11:46] Because so often what we say is I want
[1:11:48] the in love feeling that I had at the
[1:11:50] beginning. Well, that's all it was. It
[1:11:52] was a feeling. Doesn't mean there wasn't
[1:11:54] love behind it. But now we move to
[1:11:56] living our love rather than just feeling
[1:11:58] our love. Okay.
[1:12:01] But our love has matured. I think
[1:12:05] I should probably have her sitting up
[1:12:07] here tonight and and nodding. I I need
[1:12:10] some affirmation here.
[1:12:12] But I believe our love has matured. And
[1:12:14] I can say today, I love her more than I
[1:12:16] did back then. And I know she loves me
[1:12:19] more than she did back then. She'd have
[1:12:21] to to stay with me
[1:12:23] because we get to know all the ugly
[1:12:26] parts and the hidden parts and the not
[1:12:27] so great parts. And so when I look at at
[1:12:30] what God has given me, I'm amazed by the
[1:12:32] wife that he gave me because I cover her
[1:12:35] flaws with my strengths.
[1:12:37] Not flaws, weaknesses. And she covers my
[1:12:40] weaknesses with her strengths. And
[1:12:42] between the two of us, we make a pretty
[1:12:43] awesome person.
[1:12:45] Two of us make one really good unit. I
[1:12:48] say, "Praise the Lord." That's the way
[1:12:49] that God works. Amen. But the Holy
[1:12:52] Spirit is saying to the church here, he
[1:12:54] says, "Listen, you've lost what you used
[1:12:57] to have. Not just the feeling, but
[1:13:00] you've cooled off in your love for me."
[1:13:04] That's what he's saying. Amen. He says
[1:13:06] it's, you notice he never says you lost
[1:13:08] your salvation. Remember David said,
[1:13:11] "Restore to me the joy of my salvation."
[1:13:13] David never lost his salvation, but he
[1:13:16] lost he lost everything that came with
[1:13:18] that salvation. He had lost all the
[1:13:21] benefit of knowing that God is with you
[1:13:23] day in and day out. Something here, the
[1:13:25] Holy Spirit saying, has driven a wedge
[1:13:27] into your relationship with Christ.
[1:13:29] Amen. You're not as close as you used to
[1:13:32] be. You've cooled off. There's a
[1:13:34] distance that has grown between you.
[1:13:35] You've become mechanical. You become
[1:13:38] partners instead of lovers.
[1:13:42] It's a business relationship instead of
[1:13:45] a husband and wife marriage.
[1:13:49] The Holy Spirit's saying, "Now you're
[1:13:50] about going to church and saying,
[1:13:51] "Amen."
[1:13:54] Rather than sitting down and talking
[1:13:55] with me every single day.
[1:14:00] Church, God, help us if our best years
[1:14:01] of our Christian walk were way back
[1:14:03] when.
[1:14:04] Last year, last month, camp, the day you
[1:14:09] gave your heart to the Lord, the old
[1:14:12] revival, whatever it is, church, the
[1:14:14] prophet of God says we ought to be able
[1:14:16] to say, "Today is the best day. That I
[1:14:18] love him more today than I ever did
[1:14:20] before. And I'm closer to him today than
[1:14:23] I've ever been before." Otherwise, he
[1:14:25] says, "You've left your first love.
[1:14:29] you've backed away from it. Amen. God
[1:14:31] help us if all we can talk about is what
[1:14:33] God did for us months ago,
[1:14:35] years ago, rather than what he's working
[1:14:38] with us today.
[1:14:40] That's a sign of his love is that he
[1:14:41] works with us day by day, week by week.
[1:14:44] Amen. You know, we had some wonderful
[1:14:45] meetings two months ago with brother
[1:14:47] Jonathan Martin. Have we had any special
[1:14:49] moments since then in our relationship
[1:14:51] with Christ?
[1:14:54] I'm being pastoral tonight.
[1:14:56] Have you had a special moment with
[1:14:58] Christ since your special moment with
[1:14:59] Christ two months ago?
[1:15:02] That's a hard question. We ought to be
[1:15:04] able to say yes. If not, church, we need
[1:15:07] to repent because we've cooled off.
[1:15:10] We've lost. We moved away from our first
[1:15:13] love. Church, look at it this way. Have
[1:15:15] we moved from being the church to just
[1:15:18] going to church?
[1:15:22] Are we just coming to church or are we
[1:15:23] the church?
[1:15:25] You see the difference?
[1:15:28] One's just business. The other one's
[1:15:30] relationship.
[1:15:32] One's just doing a checking off a box.
[1:15:35] The other one is checking in.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:42] If that's the way it is, church, we've
[1:15:43] been neglecting our bridegroom.
[1:15:44] Formality is creeping in. Repent.
[1:15:49] Make it right.
[1:15:52] Too late to be fooling around with other
[1:15:53] things. The Holy Spirit was screaming
[1:15:55] out to that age. And brother Brandham
[1:15:56] would teach us. He says, "Everything
[1:15:58] that they had to go through, we have to
[1:16:00] defeat today. Every spirit that was
[1:16:02] there, we've got to defeat it all. We
[1:16:04] get all the rewards, but we get all the
[1:16:07] struggles and the battles as well."
[1:16:08] Let's not pretend for a second we're not
[1:16:10] facing the same thing. Amen. Showing
[1:16:13] they had something in the beginning, he
[1:16:14] says, "But they have left it."
[1:16:17] What's the solution? What's the medicine
[1:16:19] we take? He says, "Remember therefore
[1:16:21] from whence thou art fallen and repent
[1:16:23] and do the first works, or else I will
[1:16:26] come unto thee quickly and will remove
[1:16:28] thy candlestick out of his place except
[1:16:30] I repent." What's he saying? Remember
[1:16:33] how it used to be.
[1:16:39] You know, in our marriages, as we get
[1:16:40] older, as we have kids, things get
[1:16:42] busier. And sometimes we yearn. I think
[1:16:44] our wives especially yearn for the early
[1:16:46] days when it was just us and them and we
[1:16:49] could give them all of our attention and
[1:16:50] all of our time.
[1:16:53] But we don't get that back until those
[1:16:55] kids go away. And by then we're too
[1:16:56] tired to really take advantage of it.
[1:16:57] Right, brother Bob?
[1:17:00] No. No. There's a few good years left.
[1:17:03] But it's not remember what you used to
[1:17:05] have in terms of the feeling, but the
[1:17:07] reality of it.
[1:17:10] Remember what you had. Remember what it
[1:17:12] was like to come in and know you were
[1:17:16] just scoured out and clean? That you
[1:17:18] didn't have to slink into church and
[1:17:19] hope the pastor didn't nail something to
[1:17:21] the wall that you know you've been
[1:17:22] dealing with for a while.
[1:17:25] I remember and I've talked about it many
[1:17:27] times that day I gave my heart to the
[1:17:29] Lord. How scoured out and completely
[1:17:31] cleaned out I felt.
[1:17:34] Church, we ought to have that every
[1:17:35] single day. We are bloodbought
[1:17:38] Christians with access to the throne of
[1:17:41] God and the blood of Jesus Christ. We
[1:17:43] ought to feel scoured out every day. But
[1:17:46] what do we do? We stay out of his
[1:17:47] presence and we stay in the stuff that
[1:17:49] keeps us dirty. Little by little, bit by
[1:17:52] bit, and it builds up. You know, um you
[1:17:56] know how much I enjoy vehicles and I
[1:17:57] like to take care of them, but these
[1:17:59] days I seem to be too busy for it. And
[1:18:00] when I finally do wash my vehicles, I
[1:18:02] realize how dirty they've gotten. And
[1:18:04] it's only when I get close I realize how
[1:18:06] much things have gked up on them. And
[1:18:08] it's that much harder to clean up.
[1:18:10] That's why Jesus talked to Peter says,
[1:18:12] "You got to wash your feet." Because
[1:18:13] there's a daily grime that gets into our
[1:18:15] life just by existing.
[1:18:18] Then we take that and if we add a little
[1:18:19] bit of a habit here and a relationship
[1:18:21] there and a little something here and a
[1:18:22] little bit there, guess what? We get a
[1:18:24] dirt buildup that's really hard to clean
[1:18:25] up after a while. And we wonder why we
[1:18:27] feel a little dirty coming to church.
[1:18:30] It's because we've let the little things
[1:18:32] creep in over time.
[1:18:34] rather than putting it under the blood,
[1:18:36] getting rid of it. Amen. He says, "What
[1:18:39] happens?" He says, "If you don't go back
[1:18:42] to where you were," he says, "I'll take
[1:18:44] the candlestick out of you." What's the
[1:18:47] candlestick? Now, today we just say,
[1:18:50] "I'll turn off the lights." That's what
[1:18:52] he's saying. Because the candlestick was
[1:18:53] that which held the light. It's the
[1:18:55] light giver. And the scripture here is
[1:18:56] saying, "You'll lose your source of
[1:18:58] light." Now, he didn't say he'd take the
[1:19:00] word because the word is always there.
[1:19:02] But what would he do? He'd take away
[1:19:04] those that gave the light.
[1:19:07] Remember the Macedonian call? Send the
[1:19:09] light. What did God do? He sent a man.
[1:19:12] He sent Paul. So what is he saying? He's
[1:19:15] saying in this in this condition, if you
[1:19:18] don't go back to where you were, he
[1:19:20] says, "I'm going to take away your
[1:19:21] faithful messengers. I'm going to take
[1:19:22] your pastors. I'm going to take your
[1:19:24] preachers, your evangelists, teachers,
[1:19:25] prophets, apostles, and I'm going to
[1:19:26] move them out of way and leave you right
[1:19:28] where you are.
[1:19:30] I'll take away those that are preaching
[1:19:31] the truth and I'll give you over to
[1:19:33] whatever it is you feel is more suited
[1:19:34] for your life. Brother Ram would say
[1:19:36] this in the seven church ages. He says
[1:19:38] God tells them to remember. Evidently
[1:19:40] something had left their minds. They had
[1:19:42] forgotten something. He told them to
[1:19:44] turn back in their minds to their point
[1:19:46] of origin. The origin of the first age
[1:19:48] was Pentecost and they had fallen from
[1:19:50] it. They had forgotten the glory and the
[1:19:53] wonder of it. It was time to go back in
[1:19:55] mind and then in reality. church. This
[1:19:58] is for a church that had something and
[1:19:59] lost it, not for somebody that never had
[1:20:01] it. These are real believers. He says,
[1:20:03] "Back to when they could say, "For me to
[1:20:06] live is Christ." Back to purity when
[1:20:08] Ananas and Safh were dealt with. Back to
[1:20:11] the gate beautiful. He says, "Oh, what a
[1:20:13] reproach it is to drift from God and
[1:20:15] countenance those acts that defile his
[1:20:17] name. Let those who name his name." In
[1:20:21] other words, let those who call
[1:20:22] themselves Christians depart from sin
[1:20:25] and keep their vessels pure for God. He
[1:20:27] says, "Look at what you once were in
[1:20:29] your heart, in your mind, and in your
[1:20:32] life." He says, "Then go back to it." He
[1:20:35] says, "And what is the way back?" The
[1:20:37] way is the way of repentance. Remember
[1:20:40] in Leodysia, he says, "Be zealous,
[1:20:42] therefore, and repent." The prophet God
[1:20:44] would say, "The zeal of this age has to
[1:20:46] be to repent, to go back." He says, "If
[1:20:49] a sinner has to come to God by way of
[1:20:51] repentance, then the lukewarm backslider
[1:20:54] will have to repent that much more." He
[1:20:56] says, "Repent. Bring forth fruits, meat
[1:20:58] for repentance. Prove it by your light
[1:21:00] life." He says, "If you do not repent,"
[1:21:02] God said, "I will remove your
[1:21:04] lampstand." Certainly, he says, "A
[1:21:06] church in that condition can't give
[1:21:07] light to the world. Its light has turned
[1:21:10] to darkness. God will take away its
[1:21:12] faithful messenger and its faithful
[1:21:14] shepherds and leave them to themselves,
[1:21:16] and they will go on talking about
[1:21:18] Christianity, but be bereft of it." What
[1:21:21] is it? A hollow shell filled with
[1:21:23] nothing but self. No spirit, no word.
[1:21:27] Why did sepilers full of dead men's
[1:21:30] bones? Amen. That's harsh, isn't it? But
[1:21:33] that shows the seriousness of it. That
[1:21:36] shows the seriousness of it. And
[1:21:38] remember, we're being restored back to
[1:21:40] that early condition, church. And the
[1:21:43] way back is always repentance.
[1:21:45] It's always repentance. Sometimes it's
[1:21:48] repentance of our ignorance.
[1:21:50] But to find out we were in the wrong and
[1:21:52] then to find out the right, then we
[1:21:54] repent of that. But sometimes we
[1:21:55] certainly know right and we still pursue
[1:21:57] those things. God forgive us. God help
[1:21:59] us. Amen. Paul warned them time and time
[1:22:01] again. Stay with the word. It's the only
[1:22:05] gospel. He says, "I'm not allowed to
[1:22:07] change it. You're not allowed to change
[1:22:08] it. And if anyone else preaches any
[1:22:09] other gospel then they're cursed."
[1:22:12] But they had its full effect for such a
[1:22:14] short time. Remember Paul said, "Even
[1:22:16] now I see it." And John talked about it
[1:22:18] and Peter talked about it. They're
[1:22:19] coming. They're coming. They're in the
[1:22:22] church now. Look out. That's within 20
[1:22:24] 25 years of Christ leaving. It was
[1:22:27] already starting to fall from it. And
[1:22:29] watch,
[1:22:30] he says, "But this thou hast that thou
[1:22:33] hatest the deeds of the nickeladenss
[1:22:35] which I also hate." God's commending
[1:22:37] them there. He says, "Listen, you got
[1:22:38] one problem, but it's fixable. But
[1:22:41] here's the thing that's holding you." He
[1:22:43] says, "They got one thing really right.
[1:22:45] Even in that backsliden, cooled off
[1:22:47] condition, they got one thing right, and
[1:22:49] that's that they hate the deeds of the
[1:22:51] Nickelians." He says, "Which I also
[1:22:53] hate." He that hath an ear, he says,
[1:22:55] "Let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:22:57] the churches. To him that overcomemeth
[1:22:59] will I give to eat of the tree of life,
[1:23:01] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[1:23:03] God." Now, the prophet of God would come
[1:23:04] to us and he preach on this idea of
[1:23:06] nickels. And he says it's a two-part
[1:23:08] word. And the first one is nic, which
[1:23:10] means to conquer, and leos, which is the
[1:23:13] ley. In other words, the deed of the
[1:23:14] nickels is to conquer the leoty. In
[1:23:18] other words, to conquer those that are
[1:23:20] sitting in the pews. That's the that's
[1:23:22] that's the deeds of the Nickelians.
[1:23:25] That's it. And it was not just random
[1:23:27] men, but these were ministers.
[1:23:30] Ministers that were trying to control
[1:23:34] the church.
[1:23:36] And how were they trying to control the
[1:23:37] church? By elevating the ministry above
[1:23:41] the people to give them authority over
[1:23:44] everything that happened in the church.
[1:23:46] Amen. And what were they doing? They
[1:23:48] were trying to bind them to men rather
[1:23:51] than leave them in the liberty of the
[1:23:53] Holy Spirit. Because remember, the Holy
[1:23:56] Spirit was always to lead the church,
[1:23:59] not men. Holy Spirit. Amen. And the idea
[1:24:02] here was to make the ministry elite or
[1:24:05] special or in a way that gave them
[1:24:07] control and authority over the church.
[1:24:10] And this is the root of
[1:24:11] denominationalism in the scripture that
[1:24:13] we see here. Okay? And it's where we
[1:24:16] answer to men. We answer to a board. We
[1:24:18] answer to a central office, a
[1:24:19] headquarters, whatever it might be. And
[1:24:21] men have the final say, not the Holy
[1:24:23] Spirit. It's not scriptural. It's never
[1:24:26] been scriptural. The leader of the
[1:24:27] church is the spirit of God. And its
[1:24:29] word is the law in the church. Can we
[1:24:31] say amen to that? Does God use men?
[1:24:36] Yes. Absolutely. What? He's got a
[1:24:39] five-fold ministry. Apostles, prophets,
[1:24:41] evangelists, pastors, and teachers.
[1:24:43] Those are God called men. And they are
[1:24:46] authorized to do one thing, church.
[1:24:49] Preach the word.
[1:24:52] And behind that comes the signs and
[1:24:55] wonders of a God-filled man. Amen.
[1:24:59] We are not authorized to force you to do
[1:25:01] anything. Our authority is by the word,
[1:25:04] not by our person, not by our ministry,
[1:25:07] not by our presence, not by our
[1:25:08] influence, not by our money, not by the
[1:25:10] size of our church. Our authority is the
[1:25:13] word and you can take it or you can
[1:25:15] leave it. We don't get to force you.
[1:25:18] Amen. Those men, every God- called
[1:25:21] minister has to be subject to the Holy
[1:25:24] Spirit. And only when they're subject to
[1:25:26] the spirit do they have any authority
[1:25:28] because they are yielded to him rather
[1:25:29] than controlling their own self.
[1:25:31] Remember what Paul says. Paul didn't say
[1:25:33] follow me because I'm the first church
[1:25:34] age messenger. Paul didn't say follow me
[1:25:36] because I'm a prophet. He said follow me
[1:25:39] as I follow Christ.
[1:25:43] So, what does that mean, church? If a
[1:25:44] minister gets off of the word,
[1:25:48] he has to get off of the platform. And
[1:25:50] that's your duty as a church
[1:25:52] congregation is to remove that man from
[1:25:55] the pulpit.
[1:25:57] That's your God called authority is to
[1:26:00] keep the pulpit clean. Amen.
[1:26:04] Your obligation is to ensure that the
[1:26:06] person preaching behind this pulpit is
[1:26:09] preaching from the word of God.
[1:26:11] But how's the only way you're going to
[1:26:12] know that?
[1:26:15] You got to read the word of God
[1:26:16] yourself.
[1:26:18] Amen. When I'm up here preaching or any
[1:26:21] other man that's up here preaching, you
[1:26:22] shouldn't be saying amen because you
[1:26:24] believe I'm a preacher, I'm a pastor, or
[1:26:25] I'm a Holy Ghost fil man. You should be
[1:26:27] saying amen because the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:29] confirming the word to your heart that
[1:26:32] has already been given to you. That's
[1:26:34] the way it's supposed to work. You ought
[1:26:37] to know what I'm saying is true, not
[1:26:39] just believe what I'm saying is true.
[1:26:41] Amen. We're not to be ignorant. We're
[1:26:44] supposed to prove ourselves, study to
[1:26:46] show ourselves approved. We ought to
[1:26:48] know the word. Amen. That when the
[1:26:51] preacher gets up, I'll tell you, it's
[1:26:53] always a wonderful time when I come out
[1:26:55] of a service and somebody comes up and
[1:26:57] says, "Brother John, I was just reading
[1:26:59] that last week. I was just reading that
[1:27:00] this morning." Right, brother Vichel?
[1:27:02] Brother Vichel's been hitting it hard
[1:27:04] lately. Seems like every service he
[1:27:05] says, "Brother John, I was just reading
[1:27:06] that." I love to hear that because what
[1:27:10] happens is now he's not saying amen
[1:27:11] because he believes on the pastor. He's
[1:27:13] saying amen because he already read it
[1:27:15] in the word and he knows it's the truth
[1:27:16] and God has quickened it to his heart.
[1:27:18] And the preacher coming behind is just
[1:27:20] confirming what the spirit is already
[1:27:21] doing in his own life. Amen.
[1:27:26] This here was the first ride of the
[1:27:28] antichrist. And if you look at your your
[1:27:30] Bible in Revelation, he's on the white
[1:27:32] horse. And remember, he had a bow with
[1:27:35] no arrows, but he had a crown on his
[1:27:37] head. Amen. He had no weapons, but he
[1:27:40] had a crown. Was he was given a crown.
[1:27:43] Bow with no arrows. He can't force you
[1:27:45] to do anything, but he is given a crown.
[1:27:48] In other words, somebody gave him
[1:27:49] authority that he didn't have. He
[1:27:52] couldn't enforce it. So, how did he get
[1:27:54] it? He seduced. It was by guile. It was
[1:27:58] by seduction. It was by fooling the
[1:28:01] people. Amen. And what was it? It's the
[1:28:04] seeds of denomination where a man can
[1:28:06] control rather than the Holy Spirit. And
[1:28:08] it's in its infancy. Amen. And it's in
[1:28:10] the first church age. And the idea here
[1:28:12] is divide and conquer. Set up a
[1:28:14] hierarchy and fool the people into
[1:28:16] thinking a hierarchy of men is the best
[1:28:18] way.
[1:28:20] It's not. It's not the best way. But
[1:28:22] I'll tell you what it is. It's the
[1:28:24] easiest way because now you don't have
[1:28:26] to get a Holy Ghostfilled, God called
[1:28:28] man. All you need is a good man with a
[1:28:31] good heart.
[1:28:33] Church, if you read your Bible, you know
[1:28:35] that a man with a heart after God's own
[1:28:37] heart can still make really bad
[1:28:39] decisions. Good heart won't get you
[1:28:41] there. You've got to be called. You've
[1:28:43] got to be anointed. You got to be filled
[1:28:45] with the spirit to stand behind a
[1:28:46] pulpit. You've got to do that. You've
[1:28:49] got to have that. David thought he was
[1:28:51] doing God a service when he moved the
[1:28:53] ark to Jerusalem. And he checked with
[1:28:55] everyone.
[1:28:57] everyone except the prophet. And
[1:29:00] everyone said, "It's a good idea. Go
[1:29:03] ahead with it." And what ended up
[1:29:04] happening? A man died. Because everybody
[1:29:08] agreed, but nobody checked with the
[1:29:09] anointed one.
[1:29:12] Good hearts won't get us there. Good
[1:29:14] ideas, good intentions, sincere
[1:29:17] intentions won't get us there. It takes
[1:29:20] a checking up with God's word. I am
[1:29:22] amazed. I'll be honest that David
[1:29:24] because Moses had clearly shown how you
[1:29:27] move the ark. All its life it had been
[1:29:29] moved by priests and somehow David came
[1:29:31] up with a cart. I don't know how he got
[1:29:33] there. It shows how easily we can
[1:29:36] forget. Maybe that's the lesson we take
[1:29:38] from it tonight.
[1:29:41] But this white horse rider, this spirit
[1:29:43] of subtlety, this false vine, this
[1:29:45] twisted gospel that we're talking about,
[1:29:47] it started to go through and it I it was
[1:29:50] just a thought. It was just an idea in
[1:29:52] the first church age, but now it comes
[1:29:53] into the second church age. And now it's
[1:29:55] starting to gain some traction. And now
[1:29:58] he says unto the angel of the church in
[1:29:59] Smyrna, this is the second church age.
[1:30:01] This is the age of bitterness. He says,
[1:30:03] "These things sayeth the first and the
[1:30:05] last, which was dead and is alive. I
[1:30:07] know thy works and tribulation and
[1:30:10] poverty." He says, "But thou art rich,
[1:30:12] and I know the blasphemy of them which
[1:30:14] say they are Jews and are not, but are
[1:30:18] the synagogue of Satan."
[1:30:20] He did not say they are in the synagogue
[1:30:22] of Satan. He says they are the synagogue
[1:30:26] of Satan. Contrast that with us. Paul
[1:30:28] says, "Ye are the temple of the Holy
[1:30:31] Ghost." They are the synagogue of Satan.
[1:30:36] Now watch what happens here. Amen.
[1:30:38] They're under the influence of another
[1:30:39] spirit. They're not under the Holy
[1:30:41] Spirit. But watch their claim to fame
[1:30:43] and authority. How do they become the
[1:30:45] synagogue of Satan? What brought them
[1:30:47] there? It says that they say that they
[1:30:49] are Jews. Now, that's maybe a weird
[1:30:51] thing to remember, but you have to
[1:30:53] remember that on the day of Pentecost,
[1:30:54] as best we know, all 120 people up there
[1:30:58] were Jews.
[1:31:00] So, you couldn't claim to be a part of
[1:31:02] the original church unless you were a
[1:31:04] Jew. Okay?
[1:31:06] So, these people by this point, everyone
[1:31:08] that was in the upper room was dead.
[1:31:10] This is well past the time when any
[1:31:12] would be alive. So now these are
[1:31:13] relatives or people that have married in
[1:31:17] or or whatever be children,
[1:31:19] grandchildren, whatever it would be of
[1:31:21] the original 120 that were up there and
[1:31:24] they've got a powerful claim because
[1:31:25] they can say I come from the original
[1:31:28] Pentecostal group. Okay?
[1:31:33] They're a a a child or a grandchild of a
[1:31:37] founding father.
[1:31:39] But what's a Jew in a spiritual context?
[1:31:42] See, a Jew we think is somebody that's
[1:31:44] of the seed of Abraham. That's what we
[1:31:46] would say today. But remember, the seed
[1:31:48] of Abraham is a faith seed, not a blood
[1:31:50] seed. Amen. It's a faith seed. We've
[1:31:52] covered that before that Abraham had
[1:31:54] seven children by marriage and then he
[1:31:56] had one by Sarah. Then he had six by
[1:31:57] Coutur. But the scripture says only
[1:31:59] Isaac was his seed. He had seven plus he
[1:32:03] had of course um um Ishmael as well, not
[1:32:06] through marriage but just through
[1:32:07] relationship. But the others were by the
[1:32:09] will of man. But this was by
[1:32:11] relationship with his wife. That was the
[1:32:13] seed. Amen. That was the promised child.
[1:32:16] So this thought of a Jew comes now into
[1:32:18] the New Testament. And Paul would in
[1:32:21] speaking to the Christian church, he
[1:32:22] would tell us what it is. He's
[1:32:24] answering, "What is the seed of Abraham
[1:32:26] or who is a Jew?" And he says in Romans,
[1:32:29] "For he is not a Jew, which is one
[1:32:32] outwardly, neither is that circumcision
[1:32:35] which is outward in flesh." In other
[1:32:37] words, he says if it quacks like a duck,
[1:32:39] it's not a duck necessarily. Those that
[1:32:42] say Lord, Lord, those that say message,
[1:32:44] message, Brother Brandon, Brother
[1:32:45] Brandon, Christian, Christ,
[1:32:48] he says it's not those that are of those
[1:32:50] things outwardly because they look it,
[1:32:53] because they talk it, because they
[1:32:54] profess it. That's not what makes them.
[1:32:58] He says, "But he is a Jew which is one
[1:33:00] inwardly." He says, "And circumcision is
[1:33:03] that of the heart in the spirit and not
[1:33:05] in the letter whose praise is not of
[1:33:07] men, but of God." Remember he said the
[1:33:09] the circumcision that we're looking for
[1:33:11] is not outward in the flesh. Because
[1:33:13] otherwise, those men could just show and
[1:33:15] say, "Hey, I'm circumcised. That makes
[1:33:17] me a Jew." He says, "That's not what
[1:33:19] we're looking for." In other words, it
[1:33:22] won't be an exterior sign
[1:33:25] that puts tongues out of the door in the
[1:33:26] first place because that's just an
[1:33:28] outward sign. He says, "But you're a Jew
[1:33:31] based on an inward work with the
[1:33:33] circumcision of the heart by the
[1:33:35] spirit." And he says, "This is a person
[1:33:37] whose praise is not of man, but of God."
[1:33:40] In other words, the confirmation is of
[1:33:42] God, not of the people, not of the man.
[1:33:45] It's not an outward sign. It's an inward
[1:33:48] work. Amen. So, in other words, a Jew
[1:33:51] is in the spiritual sense a spiritfilled
[1:33:55] believer. That's what a Jew is. Amen.
[1:33:57] This is the true child of Abraham. This
[1:33:59] is the faith seed of Abraham, the one
[1:34:02] that's had the inward circumcision of
[1:34:03] the heart as Paul taught, which is the
[1:34:05] true baptism of the Holy Ghost, a real
[1:34:08] new birth. Now, Burbam would say this.
[1:34:10] He says, "To begin with the word Jew
[1:34:12] does not describe the religion of the
[1:34:13] Jewish people, but rather it refers only
[1:34:16] to the people of Judah and has the same
[1:34:18] precise meaning if I were to say I'm
[1:34:20] Irishborn." These people were saying
[1:34:22] they were actually Jews, real Jews by
[1:34:25] birth. He says they were liars. They
[1:34:27] were not Jews by birth and they weren't
[1:34:29] Jews by religion. He says if all this is
[1:34:32] true, what were they? Now look at this.
[1:34:35] Why are people claiming this? He says
[1:34:39] they were a deceived people who were
[1:34:42] already part of the church. They
[1:34:45] belonged to the false vine. They were
[1:34:48] not of the true church but of the false
[1:34:50] church because God said they were the
[1:34:52] synagogue of Satan.
[1:34:55] He did not say he now he's typing this
[1:34:58] to the the truly spiritual and he's
[1:35:00] saying there's people that are going to
[1:35:02] say insincerity I am a Christian he says
[1:35:06] and they're not they're deceived they're
[1:35:10] liars but it's not of will it's of
[1:35:12] deception
[1:35:14] if I could put it that way he says now
[1:35:16] the word for synagogue is not the same
[1:35:18] word we use for church in the Bible
[1:35:21] church means the called out ones or the
[1:35:23] summoned ones The psalmist said about
[1:35:25] these elect people, "Blessed is the man
[1:35:28] whom thou choosest and cause us to
[1:35:30] approach unto thee that he may dwell in
[1:35:32] thy courts." Remember his praises of
[1:35:34] God, not of men. God chooses him. God
[1:35:37] confirms him. He says, "But the meaning
[1:35:39] of synagogue is assembly or gathering."
[1:35:42] This can be good or bad, but in this
[1:35:43] case, it's bad. For these are they whose
[1:35:46] assembling is not of God, but of their
[1:35:48] own selves. And Isaiah said to them,
[1:35:50] "Behold, they shall surely gather
[1:35:52] together, but not by me. Whosoever shall
[1:35:55] gather together against thee shall fall
[1:35:58] for thy sake." Isaiah 54:15.
[1:36:01] So let me ask this evening, are we a
[1:36:03] church? Are we the church? Or are we a
[1:36:07] synagogue?
[1:36:09] In other words, are we a church or are
[1:36:11] we just going to church? This is just an
[1:36:14] assembly. This is an assembly. This is a
[1:36:16] gathering. There are no requirements to
[1:36:18] come through those doors and sit in
[1:36:20] these pews. None whatsoever. This is an
[1:36:23] assembly.
[1:36:24] This is not a church. This
[1:36:28] is a church. It's a people that are
[1:36:31] called out. Amen. Those that are the
[1:36:34] elect, those are the ones that are
[1:36:36] separated out. So, are we going to
[1:36:38] church or are we the church?
[1:36:41] Are we just gathering ourselves together
[1:36:44] or are we uniting into a body?
[1:36:49] He says, since these were surely against
[1:36:51] the true vine, God will one day deal
[1:36:53] with them in destruction. He says, now
[1:36:55] why do we have a people mixed in the
[1:36:57] framework of the church and calling
[1:36:59] themselves Jews? He says the reason is
[1:37:02] this. Since they were liars, they could
[1:37:04] make any claim they wished. They could
[1:37:06] say what they wanted as though it were a
[1:37:08] fact and then stick to it. He says, "And
[1:37:11] in this case, they could be lying with a
[1:37:13] very powerful thought in mind." He said,
[1:37:15] "Was it not so that the early church was
[1:37:17] almost if not entirely composed of Jews,
[1:37:20] making them the original members of his
[1:37:21] body? The twel apostles were Jews. The
[1:37:24] later apostles were either Jews or
[1:37:25] proelites." He says, "Thus for men to
[1:37:27] swear they were Jews would give them a
[1:37:29] preeminence and a claim to originality."
[1:37:33] He says, "Now tell a lie,
[1:37:35] stick to it. Never mind or history. Just
[1:37:39] say it and keep saying it to the people
[1:37:42] and soon the people will receive it. Now
[1:37:45] we see this in modern media today, don't
[1:37:47] we? Not not just in modern media, in
[1:37:50] everything in business to the point
[1:37:53] where they have created a lie. They've
[1:37:55] repeated it everywhere
[1:37:58] and everyone is saying the same thing
[1:37:59] and they don't even know why it's true.
[1:38:02] And it's not true. It's false. But
[1:38:04] because everybody's saying it, they
[1:38:05] think it must be true. I saw one thing
[1:38:08] blew my mind when I see it. And if I
[1:38:10] remember correctly correctly, they had
[1:38:12] 12 or 16 different news agencies
[1:38:16] saying the exact same words for the
[1:38:19] exact same story that were supposedly
[1:38:22] independent.
[1:38:25] I'm sure you've seen it, Brother Chad.
[1:38:29] How does that happen, church? Somebody's
[1:38:32] giving them a script.
[1:38:35] I'm not going to preach all the, you
[1:38:36] know, whatever. We know it's under
[1:38:37] Satan's influence. They're going to say
[1:38:39] the same thing. They have an echo
[1:38:41] chamber gospel in the media. They have
[1:38:43] it in the churches. They have it
[1:38:45] everywhere, church.
[1:38:47] But what was it? They were literally
[1:38:49] saying the exact same phrases. And these
[1:38:51] were not just generic phrases. They were
[1:38:53] specific statements. And every single
[1:38:55] one of them was reading off the same
[1:38:56] script.
[1:38:59] What is it? Keep repeating the lie.
[1:39:02] Stick to it. Never mind fact or history
[1:39:05] and the people will soon receive it.
[1:39:09] That's a scary thought that we're so
[1:39:10] gullible.
[1:39:12] And yet that's what we are without the
[1:39:14] spirit of God. Gullible. Amen.
[1:39:18] Watch. What do they do? This is the
[1:39:22] start of the Catholic Church. And what
[1:39:24] do they do? They say Peter was the first
[1:39:26] pope.
[1:39:27] Can you imagine Peter doing what the
[1:39:29] pope does today? dressed up in a funny
[1:39:31] robe with a big hat sitting in a a
[1:39:34] gilded throne as the vicor of Christ.
[1:39:38] This is a man who refused to be
[1:39:40] crucified ver with his head up lest he
[1:39:43] would be the same as Christ in that
[1:39:45] manner alone.
[1:39:47] He would not sit in a throne being the
[1:39:49] vicor of Christ much less wear a funny
[1:39:51] hat or walk around with these things
[1:39:53] that are putting out smoke and incense
[1:39:54] and all these different things crossing
[1:39:57] himself. What nonsense. But what did
[1:39:59] they do church? They took it. They made
[1:40:01] it. They they they they spoke a lie and
[1:40:04] they've been repeating it for 2,000
[1:40:07] years. We're the original church.
[1:40:09] Peter's the original hope. Pope. Hope, I
[1:40:13] guess, too.
[1:40:15] What do they have today? Pomp,
[1:40:17] circumstance, money, authority,
[1:40:20] influence.
[1:40:22] Every day, an intelligence briefing is
[1:40:24] given to the Pope from the United States
[1:40:26] intelligence community. That's the kind
[1:40:28] of influence they have. church.
[1:40:32] That's what they have. But what don't
[1:40:34] they have? The word with signs and
[1:40:36] wonders following nothing. They've got
[1:40:38] all the people. They've got all the
[1:40:40] influence. They've got all the money.
[1:40:42] They've got all the impact. They've got
[1:40:44] all the control, but they don't have the
[1:40:46] word. And they don't have the effect of
[1:40:48] the word in their midst. But they keep
[1:40:49] saying it, and they keep saying it, and
[1:40:51] they're well over a billion people now
[1:40:52] believe it. A billion people. Can you
[1:40:55] imagine a billion people in 2,000 years
[1:40:58] keep saying a lie and pretty soon the
[1:41:01] people will receive it and it becomes a
[1:41:03] fact. And pretty soon the liars are
[1:41:05] shouting down the truth
[1:41:08] because there's more of them that are
[1:41:09] telling a lie than those that know the
[1:41:10] truth. Remember, straight is the gate,
[1:41:13] narrow is the way, and few there be that
[1:41:14] find it. Truth's not common. Amen.
[1:41:18] These people in the second church age
[1:41:20] were claiming to be Jews based on their
[1:41:22] bloodline, being related to Peter or
[1:41:24] John or Andrew or maybe Mary Magdalene
[1:41:27] or somebody else like that. And they'd
[1:41:28] say, "Hey, I I was I'm related to
[1:41:30] somebody else in the the upper room. I'm
[1:41:33] spiritual royalty."
[1:41:37] Now, I see someone shaking their head.
[1:41:40] Church, we have the exact same thing
[1:41:41] going on in the message. The exact same
[1:41:44] thing going on. Has been going on. will
[1:41:46] continue to be going on. Amen. And what
[1:41:48] do they say? Well, my grandpa told me
[1:41:50] all about it. My daddy told me all about
[1:41:52] it. My daddy walked with the prophet. My
[1:41:53] daddy was the prophet.
[1:41:56] I know better than anyone. He prophesied
[1:41:58] over me. He talked about me. He prayed
[1:42:00] for me. He said I was this. He said I
[1:42:02] was that. I was there for this. I was
[1:42:04] there for that. You should listen to me.
[1:42:08] That's what they were doing in this
[1:42:09] church age.
[1:42:11] They didn't necessarily have a calling.
[1:42:13] They didn't have proof of their
[1:42:14] ministry. But they were making claim
[1:42:16] based on who they were related to.
[1:42:19] Amen.
[1:42:21] Don't we have that claim today? People
[1:42:23] saying, "Brother Brandham said so and so
[1:42:24] over me, prophesied over me, told me I
[1:42:26] was going to do this, told me I was
[1:42:27] going to do that." And what do you look
[1:42:28] at? You look at the calling in their
[1:42:30] life and the fruits of their ministry.
[1:42:31] And what is it? Nothing good. Nothing
[1:42:34] good. I don't I don't name names. I
[1:42:37] don't want to. But you'll know these
[1:42:38] people because their claim is not that I
[1:42:40] have the Holy Spirit. Their claim is I
[1:42:41] knew the prophet or I'm related to him.
[1:42:44] Amen. Church Judas spent three and a
[1:42:47] half years with Jesus.
[1:42:49] Brother Brandham had all sorts of people
[1:42:51] hanging around him all the time. How
[1:42:54] many managers did he go through? And
[1:42:56] most of them turned their back on him
[1:42:57] eventually. Hanging around him being in
[1:43:00] his good graces means absolutely
[1:43:02] nothing. I'll tell you what, it makes me
[1:43:04] sick to the stomach. And I believe it
[1:43:05] does God the discord and the shame
[1:43:07] that's been brought to this message
[1:43:09] because people have relied on the
[1:43:10] relationship rather than the Holy Spirit
[1:43:12] in these things. It's made a mess of so
[1:43:14] many things because it's Nickelodeonism
[1:43:16] to its core. It's a lying spirit. Amen.
[1:43:19] It's a synagogue of Satan where people
[1:43:21] use their bloodline or relationship as a
[1:43:23] reason to preach or pull on people or
[1:43:25] drum up support. It's nickelianism. And
[1:43:27] it leads into exactly what the Catholic
[1:43:29] Church is,
[1:43:31] a cult off the word.
[1:43:35] How do you know these people?
[1:43:37] Everything's about who they know,
[1:43:40] not what they have. No call, no spirit.
[1:43:43] The Holy Spirit's not stuck to a family
[1:43:45] line. I don't know if you know this.
[1:43:46] Praise the Lord. Hey, brother Chad. Hey,
[1:43:48] I got a dad that doesn't have the Holy
[1:43:50] Ghost. It's a good thing that you're not
[1:43:51] in or out based on whether or not your
[1:43:53] parents have it. Amen. I like what a
[1:43:56] brother said, a preacher said. He said,
[1:43:58] "The the sons of prophets have a pretty
[1:43:59] bad track record in the scripture, and
[1:44:01] the sons of the high priest didn't do
[1:44:02] very well either." Amen. It's not based
[1:44:04] on bloodlines. It's based on faith in
[1:44:06] the word of God. Amen. The proof of a
[1:44:08] man's ministry is what it produces, not
[1:44:10] what he claims he is. Amen. It's the
[1:44:12] only way to judge it. You can get a lot
[1:44:14] of followers. You can build a church.
[1:44:15] That's easy. I could do it today with
[1:44:17] what I know. Go out and build a thousand
[1:44:19] member church and probably make a
[1:44:20] million dollars a year at it.
[1:44:22] Wouldn't be much of a church. It'd be a
[1:44:25] gathering. Wouldn't be called out ones.
[1:44:28] It'd be a church with itching ears.
[1:44:30] Knowing how to manipulate people,
[1:44:31] knowing how to tell people what they
[1:44:32] like to hear. It's not hard to do,
[1:44:34] church. If I had a personality, maybe
[1:44:37] I'd do it that way.
[1:44:39] But some people have a personality.
[1:44:42] They can draw people in no matter what.
[1:44:44] And people judge them by their
[1:44:45] personality, how much they like them
[1:44:46] rather than by the word that's
[1:44:47] supposedly coming out of their mouth.
[1:44:50] Amen. But look, these this church held
[1:44:53] them at bay. He says, "Listen, you've
[1:44:55] tried them by the word and you know
[1:44:57] they're not right. You push them back."
[1:45:00] But listen to what the prophet of God
[1:45:01] says because it's starting to infiltrate
[1:45:02] in and not everybody's winning the
[1:45:03] victory. He says, "Did you notice?" He
[1:45:05] says, "The Nickelians had gotten
[1:45:06] themselves a synagogue." Now he says the
[1:45:09] Bible says so here did you notice here
[1:45:10] in the ninth verse which are not but are
[1:45:12] the synagogue of Satan. He says the true
[1:45:14] church had been pushed out. The nickels
[1:45:16] had taken over and they had pushed out
[1:45:19] the people that had the Holy Ghost. So
[1:45:22] therefore they didn't have any use for
[1:45:23] them. What happens when you push the
[1:45:25] Holy Ghost out? Nature uphores a vacuum.
[1:45:29] Satan steps in. Well, you may lead
[1:45:32] yourself for a while, but Satan's real
[1:45:34] good at leading us places we want to go.
[1:45:37] real good at leaning to those things
[1:45:38] that we desire in our hearts and in our
[1:45:40] flesh. Amen. And he'll come right in
[1:45:42] behind that and he'll leave us lead us
[1:45:44] in our self-will. Now, that sounds like
[1:45:45] a contradiction, but he'll put a desire
[1:45:47] in us and then he'll give us what we
[1:45:48] desire. A desire he created. Eve never
[1:45:51] had a desire to leave the word until
[1:45:53] Satan offered it to her.
[1:45:56] But in the end, she followed her own
[1:45:57] will, which was, I want to be just like
[1:45:59] God. I want to produce things my own
[1:46:02] way. What it does, it leads us
[1:46:04] susceptible. Remember we preached about
[1:46:05] those prophets of Ahab. Because they
[1:46:08] wanted to please Ahab, they made
[1:46:10] themselves susceptible to a lying
[1:46:11] spirit. They were willingly fooled
[1:46:13] because of their own desires.
[1:46:16] But out of that second age and then into
[1:46:17] the third age, that nickelian spirit
[1:46:19] grew and grew and it became a real force
[1:46:21] to be reckoned with because it went from
[1:46:23] they're not allowed in. We've judged
[1:46:25] them. They're not coming in at all to oh
[1:46:28] well they say they're Christians so
[1:46:30] we're just going to let them in.
[1:46:33] Shouldn't have done it. should never
[1:46:35] have let them in in the first place.
[1:46:36] Now, that's hard, isn't it? Can you
[1:46:38] imagine saying no to somebody to come
[1:46:40] through those doors, but you know,
[1:46:42] sometimes you have to do that. Not
[1:46:44] saying we need to do it to anyone here
[1:46:45] tonight. Everybody's saved.
[1:46:48] But there are times
[1:46:51] because how do you know them? They won't
[1:46:53] submit to the word. That's why Paul put
[1:46:55] an order in for dealing with people that
[1:46:57] won't subject themselves to the word.
[1:46:58] When it's clear and when it's obvious.
[1:47:01] If we had somebody, God forbid, that was
[1:47:03] that was baptized in the name of the
[1:47:05] Lord Jesus Christ, that had committed
[1:47:06] themselves to walk a Christian life and
[1:47:08] they were living common law in this
[1:47:10] church, would we allow them through that
[1:47:11] door? No. You know what would happen?
[1:47:14] Brother Joel, Brother Matt would go talk
[1:47:16] to them first.
[1:47:18] And if they didn't listen to them, then
[1:47:19] they would take the second one or myself
[1:47:21] and we go talk to them. And if they
[1:47:22] didn't listen, then then what would
[1:47:24] happen? We would pull them in front of
[1:47:25] the church. We would say, "We've given
[1:47:26] them the word. They're clearly off the
[1:47:28] word in their life. They have a choice
[1:47:31] to repent and stop it or we'll boot them
[1:47:34] out of the church.
[1:47:36] That it's that simple. It is that
[1:47:38] simple. That's what you would do. We're
[1:47:40] not looking to put anybody out. They put
[1:47:42] themselves out. They put themselves out.
[1:47:46] But it went from
[1:47:48] we're not letting anything in. Remember
[1:47:50] brother Bram said, the purity of Ananas
[1:47:52] and Safara being dealt with. They went
[1:47:54] from that to slacking off and saying,
[1:47:56] "Well, we'll just let them do. the Lord
[1:47:58] will deal with it. No, there's some
[1:48:00] things that we need to deal with. We're
[1:48:02] authorized to deal with those things.
[1:48:04] Amen.
[1:48:06] We don't do it anymore.
[1:48:09] I trust we don't do it anymore because
[1:48:10] we don't need to do it anymore. But if,
[1:48:13] God forbid, it happened, that's what
[1:48:14] would happen. And our deacons would have
[1:48:16] a very uncomfortable time.
[1:48:19] And then I'd be stepping in behind them.
[1:48:21] And then the whole church would have to
[1:48:22] vote on that. Not vote on it. We would
[1:48:25] just say, "You're out if you don't
[1:48:26] repent." It's not even a vote. It's just
[1:48:28] the way it is. We bring them up in front
[1:48:29] of the church as a witness that they
[1:48:31] refuse to do those things. It's hard,
[1:48:34] but that's the way the spirit works. It
[1:48:35] keeps the church clean. It church keeps
[1:48:38] the church clean. Amen. And now they're
[1:48:40] in. And once they got in, then what do
[1:48:42] they do? They multiply.
[1:48:44] Unbelief multiplies like rabbits.
[1:48:47] Believers, not so much.
[1:48:50] Pretty soon they booted them all out.
[1:48:52] Watch what happens. Moves into the third
[1:48:55] church age. He says to the angel of the
[1:48:56] church in Pergamus, write these things
[1:48:59] saith he which has the sharp sword with
[1:49:00] two edges. This is the person with the
[1:49:02] word. It is Christ the word speaking. He
[1:49:05] says I know thy works and where thou
[1:49:07] dwellest even where Satan's seed is and
[1:49:10] thou holdest fast my name and has not
[1:49:12] denied my faith. Even in those days
[1:49:14] where Antipus was my faithful martyr who
[1:49:17] is slain among you where Satan dwelleth.
[1:49:19] He says, "But I have a few things
[1:49:20] against thee, because thou hast there
[1:49:22] them which hold the doctrine of Balum,
[1:49:25] which taught Bale or who taught Bailo to
[1:49:27] cast a stumbling block before the
[1:49:29] children of Israel to eat things
[1:49:31] sacrificed to idols and to commit
[1:49:32] fornication." He says, "You've got in
[1:49:34] your church, you've allowed, you've
[1:49:36] willingly allowed in your church those
[1:49:38] that adhere to the doctrine of Balum,
[1:49:40] which he taught Bailo to trip up the
[1:49:43] children of Israel." Now, what was that
[1:49:45] that that that flawed thinking? Remember
[1:49:48] what brother Araham said? What was it?
[1:49:50] Because these were relatives of the
[1:49:51] Israelites.
[1:49:53] This is Lot's family. And they said,
[1:49:56] "Hey, we're a part of the same family.
[1:49:58] We don't need to fight. We can get
[1:50:00] along. We all believe in Jesus."
[1:50:03] And they brought it in. And what did
[1:50:04] they do, church? They introduced new
[1:50:06] worship. And it was based on sensuality
[1:50:10] rather than holiness. In other words, it
[1:50:13] was based on making the worshipper feel
[1:50:15] good rather than bringing them before a
[1:50:18] god that would accept them and make them
[1:50:20] acceptable and righteous.
[1:50:22] It was about how the people loved the
[1:50:24] worship rather than the God that they
[1:50:26] loved. It was self-indulgent worship.
[1:50:31] You I was watching a a a uh
[1:50:35] I I I had to send a song over to
[1:50:37] somebody and I and I apologized because
[1:50:39] I said, you know, it gets pretty pretty
[1:50:41] heavy at the end. and you have these
[1:50:42] beautiful songs, but then they take and
[1:50:43] they turn it into a rock and roll song.
[1:50:45] And when you look at what's going on in
[1:50:47] those concerts,
[1:50:49] it's not worship of God. It's self
[1:50:52] worship. If you've ever seen a rock
[1:50:55] concert, if you've ever seen a modern uh
[1:50:57] uh concert of any type that's not
[1:50:59] Christian, it's all about self. It's all
[1:51:02] about feeling good. It's all about
[1:51:05] energy.
[1:51:06] And this is what we're getting in modern
[1:51:08] worship is we're getting energy rather
[1:51:11] than anointing.
[1:51:12] That's what we're coming to. Why?
[1:51:14] Because energy helps us. We go out, we
[1:51:17] feel on top of the world, we feel good.
[1:51:19] We shouted, we danced, we raised our
[1:51:21] hands, we cried. We are energized. But
[1:51:24] is it the spirit or is it just a spirit?
[1:51:27] You know,
[1:51:29] I've said it before, you can't start
[1:51:31] with the spirit of God and end up in
[1:51:32] rock and roll.
[1:51:34] you just were hiding it at the
[1:51:35] beginning. It's why we've got to take
[1:51:37] these things and strip that stuff out.
[1:51:41] We can sing songs that they sing in a
[1:51:42] completely different way. And I believe
[1:51:44] it's acceptable to God. But it's because
[1:51:46] we're not trying to make ourselves feel
[1:51:47] good. It's because we're worshiping the
[1:51:49] God of our hearts. Amen.
[1:51:52] But this the the the doctrine of Balum
[1:51:54] was we're all the same. We're all
[1:51:56] relatives of Abraham. We're all
[1:51:57] Christians, right? It's a blending of
[1:52:00] false gospel with a real gospel. Amen.
[1:52:02] It's an ecumenical movement, Brother
[1:52:04] Brandon would say, where you have two
[1:52:05] different belief systems coming together
[1:52:07] and we take their claim that they
[1:52:09] believe what we believe as gospel. Well,
[1:52:12] I'm a Christian. We believe the same. We
[1:52:14] should agree. No, that's not right. And
[1:52:17] you give a word test. That's how you
[1:52:19] know if they're really a Christian, if
[1:52:21] they're really sincere. And what's the
[1:52:24] result? In Balum's day, in that day, it
[1:52:27] was natural fornication. remember where
[1:52:29] it would got so so blatant that a man
[1:52:32] took a woman into his tent in the front
[1:52:34] of the temple.
[1:52:36] Actually committed the act in a tent
[1:52:39] right in front of the temple and Phineas
[1:52:41] came with a javelin and he put us put it
[1:52:43] right through both of them. And God said
[1:52:44] because of that the blessings of God
[1:52:46] will never leave Phineas's house because
[1:52:48] he wouldn't stand for it. And that man
[1:52:50] was a prince of her if I'm not mistaken.
[1:52:52] He was a prince whatever it was in the
[1:52:54] house of Israel and she was a princess.
[1:52:56] And he says, "I don't care who you are.
[1:52:59] We've got a standard of holiness in this
[1:53:01] camp." And right there, and then God
[1:53:03] followed through that with judgment. We
[1:53:05] know, brother Bam said God never forgave
[1:53:06] him for it.
[1:53:08] It was natural fornication. But what
[1:53:10] does it result in here? Spiritual
[1:53:12] fornication where they're what? They're
[1:53:14] in relationship with multiple gods of
[1:53:16] their own making rather than the one
[1:53:18] true God. He says, "So thou hast them."
[1:53:21] He says, "You got those that hold the
[1:53:23] doctrine of Balum, and so hast thou also
[1:53:25] them that hold the doctrine of the
[1:53:27] nickelians, which thing I hate." See, it
[1:53:29] started as a thought, then it was a
[1:53:32] saying that became a doctrine, but now
[1:53:34] it's a reality, and it's become a
[1:53:36] denominational system. It's men in
[1:53:38] charge of men. And God says, "I hate it.
[1:53:40] I hate it."
[1:53:43] It's amazing.
[1:53:45] This is the real coming of the Catholic
[1:53:46] Church into power. And you know the
[1:53:48] emperor Constantine's there and they
[1:53:50] have the Nyian council and it's a
[1:53:52] blended system where they took political
[1:53:54] power. What's political power church?
[1:53:56] When you get down to it, it's the will
[1:53:58] of the people. It's the will of the
[1:54:00] people. So the this ecumenical movement
[1:54:02] is the blending of the will of the
[1:54:04] people with the word of God supposedly.
[1:54:07] It's blending our will with spiritual
[1:54:09] doctrine. Amen. But remember, we're not
[1:54:12] preaching to the Catholic Church today.
[1:54:13] I'm preaching to you guys. We're not in
[1:54:15] a denomination today by God's grace
[1:54:17] trust. Amen. So the question is, brother
[1:54:19] John, how does this even apply to us?
[1:54:21] And we're closing. How does this even
[1:54:23] apply to us? You preached about all this
[1:54:26] system and all this twisted bind and
[1:54:28] twisted gospel. How in the world am I
[1:54:30] supposed to apply to this? Is anybody
[1:54:31] wondering that this evening?
[1:54:35] Yes, that's good.
[1:54:38] Look at how it started and that'll tell
[1:54:41] you if it applies to you and how it
[1:54:42] applies to you. Look at the path of how
[1:54:44] they got here. I've said it before, but
[1:54:46] you can be in a denomination of one of
[1:54:48] your own making.
[1:54:50] What did it start with? And this is
[1:54:52] really where we started last service. It
[1:54:54] starts with a thought.
[1:54:57] What was Satan's thought? I will ascend.
[1:55:00] I will. I will. I will. Starts with a
[1:55:03] thought. Starts with a desire. Starts
[1:55:06] with an intention. Amen. Starts with
[1:55:09] personal will, a plan.
[1:55:12] It can even be something as honest and
[1:55:14] sincere as seeing a need or a gap and
[1:55:16] saying, "I could probably fill that."
[1:55:19] Okay? Subtlety,
[1:55:22] sincerity,
[1:55:23] good intentions,
[1:55:25] but it initiates with self, not with
[1:55:28] God. That's the clear distinction. Amen.
[1:55:32] It's seems good, might be good, but it
[1:55:38] started by self. Maybe you share
[1:55:39] privately with a few people. Maybe just
[1:55:41] mle it over for a bit and linger on it.
[1:55:44] But the thing that you notice is that
[1:55:46] you don't bring that thought subject to
[1:55:49] the word.
[1:55:51] This is where we get caught.
[1:55:54] Good intentions, good ideas, grand
[1:55:57] visions, grand plans, whatever it might
[1:55:58] be, and it lingers there and we mull
[1:56:01] over it and we dwell on it. But one
[1:56:03] thing we don't do is take it back to the
[1:56:05] word. Amen. It's self-inspired. Now that
[1:56:09] means it could be God or it could be
[1:56:12] Satan. We don't know. But that's why we
[1:56:15] have to take it back to the word. But
[1:56:16] now after a while we mold on it. And
[1:56:19] what happens to a thought eventually
[1:56:20] church? It has to become a word, doesn't
[1:56:22] it? And so what do we do? We turn it
[1:56:25] into a doctrine. We turn it into a
[1:56:26] spoken plan. We turn it into a
[1:56:28] commitment or a vision. Maybe it's a
[1:56:30] calling, whatever it might be. And now
[1:56:33] what was a thought is coming into
[1:56:34] reality. It's not just in your mind, but
[1:56:36] now you start to talk about it and you
[1:56:38] express it and you're thinking of maybe
[1:56:40] putting it into action. So now you start
[1:56:42] to share it with people. Maybe you share
[1:56:45] with your spouse. Hey honey, this is
[1:56:47] what I'm thinking. This is what I'm
[1:56:48] seeing. And what it does is it starts
[1:56:50] with you trying to convince people,
[1:56:53] trying to recruit people, and openly
[1:56:56] getting people to work with you on this
[1:56:57] thing.
[1:56:59] Now, sometimes it only needs just one.
[1:57:00] It might be your spouse's permission or
[1:57:02] agreement, depending on what that might
[1:57:04] be.
[1:57:05] But it might be your friends. It might
[1:57:06] be your family. It might be people in
[1:57:08] your church. If you're a minister, it
[1:57:09] might be other ministers. And what is
[1:57:12] it, church? You're going around and it's
[1:57:14] gaining momentum based on your work, on
[1:57:17] your influence, but it's not based on
[1:57:19] what God's trying to do. It's your work
[1:57:22] that's giving it traction, not the
[1:57:24] moving of the spirit that's giving
[1:57:26] attraction.
[1:57:28] So when you come up, that other person
[1:57:30] isn't saying, "Oh yeah, I've thought
[1:57:31] about that. I've really been praying
[1:57:32] about that, too." They just say, "Oh,
[1:57:35] that's really interesting, brother.
[1:57:36] That's really neat, sister.
[1:57:39] We're starting to push it now. We're
[1:57:42] starting to drive it. We're starting to
[1:57:44] make it happen." Then the third stage is
[1:57:45] what we've read here. It turns into a
[1:57:48] system. It turns into a lifestyle. It
[1:57:50] turns into a decision. It turns into a
[1:57:52] ministry. It turns into a calling. Now
[1:57:54] you're past talking. Now you're into
[1:57:56] doing. Now you're into implementing. Now
[1:57:58] you're into acting based on all your
[1:58:00] work and discussions. And now you got a
[1:58:02] people that'll help you make it a
[1:58:03] reality.
[1:58:05] Might be your spouse, might be your peer
[1:58:07] group, might be the brothers, might be
[1:58:08] the ministers,
[1:58:10] might be somebody that has money, it
[1:58:12] might be the the business people. Amen.
[1:58:14] You've got your backers and you got
[1:58:15] people that will help you absorb the
[1:58:17] criticism and deflect things away from
[1:58:20] you so that you can get this thing done
[1:58:22] to make sure you can keep moving. You're
[1:58:24] committed to making it work regardless
[1:58:27] of whether or not it's working. Okay?
[1:58:31] Simple thing for this would be maybe you
[1:58:32] feel you're called to preach.
[1:58:36] Maybe you feel you're called to be a
[1:58:38] musician. You know if you want maybe
[1:58:41] you're a good speaker, people like you.
[1:58:42] You know the message. You know your
[1:58:43] Bible. You've got all the outward
[1:58:45] elements of a preacher. And so you start
[1:58:46] to think, well maybe I could be a
[1:58:48] preacher. Now that excludes all of our
[1:58:51] sisters. So let's go a different route.
[1:58:53] Maybe you want to be maybe you think I
[1:58:54] could be a musician. I play well. I love
[1:58:57] to worship. I love to sing. I love to
[1:58:59] play. I love to practice.
[1:59:02] And there's something you say, "Well,
[1:59:03] there's something in my heart. I want to
[1:59:04] be a musician."
[1:59:07] But the thing is, is it something that
[1:59:08] you want or is it something that God
[1:59:10] wants?
[1:59:12] Because it's not about ability, it's
[1:59:15] about calling. God will give you enough
[1:59:17] ability to satisfy the need, but the
[1:59:19] calling has to be there. And the spirit
[1:59:22] of God has to be there to anoint you, to
[1:59:25] make it work. Amen. I remember I told
[1:59:27] that story one time
[1:59:30] back in a church I was in and we had a a
[1:59:32] sister that just moved in an organ into
[1:59:35] the church just of her own accord
[1:59:37] and she just plugged it in and one day
[1:59:39] she started playing when the musicians
[1:59:40] were called up. She went right up with
[1:59:42] her and started playing and
[1:59:44] unfortunately she wasn't a very good
[1:59:45] player. She was stilted. She couldn't
[1:59:47] flow easily. She she'd hold up things
[1:59:49] and and just generally it wasn't
[1:59:51] conducive to a good worship service. And
[1:59:54] the song leader was fairly um
[1:59:58] strongly motivated to not have this
[2:00:00] happen again. And he had talked to the
[2:00:03] to the pastor and the pastor wasn't
[2:00:04] willing to do anything about it. And
[2:00:05] then we kicked the pastor out. So now he
[2:00:07] had an opportunity to do something about
[2:00:08] it. So he took a pair of scissors and he
[2:00:10] cut the power cord.
[2:00:12] Well, for once then she came up the next
[2:00:14] service. It obviously didn't work. So
[2:00:15] after service, she went and checked and
[2:00:17] saw the power cord was cut. So she went
[2:00:19] and had it repaired. Plugged it right
[2:00:21] back in. Didn't take a hint. So she kept
[2:00:24] playing. So now guess what happened? The
[2:00:26] pastor wouldn't deal with it. Then we
[2:00:27] booted him out. Now the song leader
[2:00:29] doesn't have any authority. So the first
[2:00:30] thing he went was to the deacons. Well,
[2:00:31] the other deacon said, "I'm leaving.
[2:00:33] John's going to have to do it." So I had
[2:00:35] to go talk to this sister. One of the
[2:00:38] hardest, most awkward decisions of my
[2:00:40] life.
[2:00:42] But I went to talk to that sister and I
[2:00:43] said, "Sister, unfortunately, we're
[2:00:46] going to have to tell you, you cannot
[2:00:47] play in the services. You can still do
[2:00:50] specials of your own. That's fine. but
[2:00:52] you cannot play the services with the
[2:00:54] regular musicians. She said, "Why?" I
[2:00:56] said, "Because you're not good enough."
[2:00:59] Now, she didn't like that. Now, that's
[2:01:00] really hard to say to somebody. That's
[2:01:02] really hard to say to somebody. Deaconly
[2:01:04] duty, brothers.
[2:01:08] But you know what she said? She said,
[2:01:10] "Well, my daddy had a dream.
[2:01:14] My daddy had a vision that I was going
[2:01:16] to play in the church, and this is the
[2:01:18] fulfillment of his dream and his
[2:01:20] vision."
[2:01:21] I said, "That's as may be, but it won't
[2:01:24] be fulfilled in this church.
[2:01:27] It's already happened technically."
[2:01:29] But I said, "I'm sorry, that's not it."
[2:01:31] I said, "You don't have the skill to
[2:01:33] play with it." And she kind of sputtered
[2:01:36] and hemmed and hawed for a while. Why,
[2:01:38] church? Because she wanted to make it
[2:01:40] happen. She was committed to being a
[2:01:43] musician in our church. And she saw her
[2:01:45] moment and she she took it. It was not
[2:01:48] given. She took it. Okay.
[2:01:52] So what happened after that
[2:01:55] is I said, "We're clear, right? You are
[2:01:57] not to play during the regular song
[2:02:00] service. You're still welcome to do
[2:02:01] specials on your own because you don't
[2:02:03] have the other musicians to worry
[2:02:04] about." Yes, sir. Okay. Within two
[2:02:07] weeks, she was going around behind our
[2:02:08] backs and talking to the people of the
[2:02:10] church saying, "Hey, do you think it's
[2:02:12] good if I'm up there playing? Do you
[2:02:15] think it's okay if I'm up there
[2:02:16] playing?"
[2:02:18] And it came back to me. And so I went to
[2:02:20] her and I said, "Sister,
[2:02:22] what are you doing? We told you you're
[2:02:25] not allowed to play." She said, 'Well, I
[2:02:27] wanted to know what the people thought.'
[2:02:29] I says, "It doesn't matter what the
[2:02:30] people think. You've been told you're
[2:02:32] not going to play." See, what was it,
[2:02:34] church? She wanted to do it so badly.
[2:02:36] She was willing to do whatever it took
[2:02:38] to make it happen.
[2:02:40] She was in an echo chamber of her and
[2:02:42] her dad that she was a great musician.
[2:02:45] And she was convinced that she was a
[2:02:46] blessing. And she wasn't. She was a
[2:02:49] hindrance. She was an embarrassment to
[2:02:51] herself.
[2:02:54] But she was so committed to making it
[2:02:56] work regardless of what the deacon said,
[2:02:58] regardless of feedback from the other
[2:03:00] musicians who were actually good.
[2:03:04] Awkward,
[2:03:06] but she was so she just had to have it,
[2:03:08] church. And that's sometimes what it
[2:03:10] looks like is you've got to have it
[2:03:13] to the point where you'll take it rather
[2:03:15] than wait for it to be given to you.
[2:03:18] Hey, don't think it doesn't happen.
[2:03:20] Moses tried to take it, but he had to
[2:03:22] come to a day where it was given to him.
[2:03:24] And by the time it was given to him, he
[2:03:25] really wasn't that interested in it
[2:03:26] because God had beaten him and taken
[2:03:29] every ounce of self self-will and
[2:03:30] ambition completely out of him. Amen.
[2:03:36] What happens, I've seen it happen with
[2:03:38] ministry.
[2:03:39] They go around and
[2:03:42] check in with people instead of checking
[2:03:43] in with God,
[2:03:46] you know, and you see how it works.
[2:03:47] You're using people as your sounding
[2:03:48] board rather than God as your sounding
[2:03:52] board. Amen. That's what David did when
[2:03:53] he tried to move the ark. He used the
[2:03:55] people as a sounding board instead of
[2:03:56] the word.
[2:03:58] I've seen it with preachers where they
[2:04:00] declare themselves a preacher and
[2:04:01] they've talked to so many people and
[2:04:03] they've got the support of so many
[2:04:04] people. They put that preacher in, he
[2:04:06] starts to preach. And let me tell you by
[2:04:08] by experience, when people back you up
[2:04:10] on something, church, they're backing
[2:04:12] you for life. Usually,
[2:04:15] we have to be so careful where we put
[2:04:17] our support
[2:04:19] because we've got to know that it's the
[2:04:20] Lord, not just oursel or not just that
[2:04:22] person. And I've seen people that said,
[2:04:24] "Yes, brother. I think you make a great
[2:04:25] preacher. I think you make a great
[2:04:26] pastor." Whatever it might be. And they
[2:04:28] put their support behind him. They put
[2:04:30] that man into that role. And then what
[2:04:32] happens? He falls flat on his face.
[2:04:36] And now they backed somebody that
[2:04:39] clearly doesn't have a gift, that
[2:04:41] clearly doesn't have the results.
[2:04:43] And now they're bound by that. And if
[2:04:46] they were to back off with their
[2:04:47] support, now they're going to hurt that
[2:04:49] man. They're going to embarrass that
[2:04:50] man. And they're going to embarrass
[2:04:52] themselves. So what do they do? They
[2:04:54] keep silent. They just keep motoring
[2:04:56] forward. And what happens is the the the
[2:04:59] the problem just progresses, progresses,
[2:05:02] progressive. Amen. And so what do they
[2:05:05] do? They get to the point where the
[2:05:06] ministry has fallen flat on its face and
[2:05:08] they can't stop and say, "Oops, the
[2:05:10] fruit of the ministry doesn't match what
[2:05:12] the word says. We made a mistake." And
[2:05:14] you can literally have a church go for
[2:05:16] 15, 20 years with the wrong person
[2:05:19] because the people put that man in
[2:05:21] rather than the Holy Spirit
[2:05:24] continues the mistake indefinitely.
[2:05:26] Pride gets tied to it. They can't repent
[2:05:28] of it. They can't even take
[2:05:29] responsibility for it.
[2:05:32] Sometimes we've got to stop. And this is
[2:05:34] really what I'm talking about tonight as
[2:05:35] we're closing. To stop and take
[2:05:37] inventory,
[2:05:39] to take responsibility for our actions,
[2:05:42] our decisions, our priorities, and then
[2:05:45] say, "Has what has come out of this been
[2:05:47] the word of the Lord?
[2:05:49] Has it been what's good for the kingdom
[2:05:51] of God or for the kingdom of John?"
[2:05:54] You know,
[2:05:56] we we do it with so many things. We do
[2:05:58] it with ministers. We do it with jobs.
[2:06:00] We do with businesses. We do with family
[2:06:01] decisions. And it's a mess because we
[2:06:03] won't repent and back up and say I
[2:06:06] misstepped.
[2:06:08] I went forward of my own valition rather
[2:06:10] than of the Holy Spirit's leadership. I
[2:06:13] didn't have a word for it. I just had a
[2:06:14] will for it.
[2:06:17] I've seen people make mistakes and we
[2:06:19] can stand this morning as I'm closing. I
[2:06:21] don't mean to be negative. Amen. But
[2:06:23] I've got a burden this evening.
[2:06:26] People make mistakes
[2:06:28] or they make a decision and the whole
[2:06:30] thing blows up in their face. nothing
[2:06:32] good comes out of it. And by that I mean
[2:06:34] nothing good for the kingdom of God. And
[2:06:37] they still declare it to be the will of
[2:06:38] the Lord. Literally seen things blow up
[2:06:41] and they say, "Boy, the Lord sure moves
[2:06:43] in mysterious ways." No, he doesn't. No,
[2:06:47] he doesn't do that. That wasn't him.
[2:06:49] That was you. That was me. That was me
[2:06:53] having to back up and just take
[2:06:55] inventory of these things and say,
[2:06:57] "Lord, that was me, and I'm sorry for
[2:06:59] it." Because the fruit that's coming out
[2:07:01] is not your word.
[2:07:04] It's just more of a mess. It's more
[2:07:06] time. It's more stress.
[2:07:09] It's not what I need. And it's not
[2:07:12] making me closer to you.
[2:07:15] We need to be able to back away from
[2:07:16] those decisions. Amen.
[2:07:20] Get uncomfortable.
[2:07:22] You know, brother Joe and I work out
[2:07:23] occasionally
[2:07:25] and we were at the gym the other day and
[2:07:27] we were
[2:07:29] trying to perfect ourselves
[2:07:32] and we've been doing a particular
[2:07:34] exercise but we weren't happy with the
[2:07:36] way we were doing it because we weren't
[2:07:37] meeting the standard for that movement
[2:07:40] and so we had to get uncomfortable.
[2:07:42] You know, sometimes we think if we're
[2:07:43] uncomfortable that means something's
[2:07:45] wrong. No, sometimes what that means is
[2:07:47] we're wrong. We've got to be willing to
[2:07:50] get uncomfortable. And so we were
[2:07:51] sitting there and and we took the
[2:07:53] weights that we could move and we cut it
[2:07:54] to well under half of what we could move
[2:07:56] easily to get that form right. And it
[2:08:00] was uncomfortable. I was very sore, very
[2:08:03] uncomfortable the next day because we're
[2:08:05] doing what we were supposed to have been
[2:08:07] doing all along. And if we've been doing
[2:08:10] it all along, we wouldn't have been
[2:08:11] nearly as uncomfortable, would we,
[2:08:12] brother Joe? We wouldn't have made the
[2:08:13] claims we made either, would we?
[2:08:15] Wouldn't have hit the target.
[2:08:19] See, sometimes we're too busy on trying
[2:08:20] to get to the end rather than getting
[2:08:22] there the right way. And we've got to be
[2:08:25] get comfortable enough to say, and I
[2:08:27] won't go into the details, but we were
[2:08:28] aiming for a certain mark. And now we're
[2:08:30] kind of re-evaluating and saying, did we
[2:08:31] really hit the mark? Because we didn't
[2:08:34] do it in perfect form. So that means
[2:08:36] we've got to go back.
[2:08:40] We've got to repent.
[2:08:44] Now, I'm using a natural example,
[2:08:46] church. We've got to repent and go back
[2:08:48] to where our form broke and say that's
[2:08:51] the only thing we were able to move
[2:08:52] properly.
[2:08:54] And if we really want to claim we're as
[2:08:55] strong as we think we are, we've got to
[2:08:58] keep that form all the way up till we
[2:08:59] set the record we're looking for.
[2:09:02] It's the same thing with the church
[2:09:03] today. We've got to be willing to get
[2:09:04] uncomfortable.
[2:09:07] Scripture says the word of God is a
[2:09:10] two-edged sword. Cuts coming and going.
[2:09:14] Amen. It's uncomfortable.
[2:09:16] because it's trimming us. We're not
[2:09:18] trimming it. But we've got to be able to
[2:09:21] sit back and say, "Lord, I'm willing to
[2:09:23] be uncomfortable if it produces your
[2:09:25] word results." Amen.
[2:09:29] In other words, are we getting closer to
[2:09:31] God or further away? Doesn't matter if
[2:09:33] we feel better if we didn't get closer
[2:09:36] to God. Doesn't matter if we've got more
[2:09:38] money if we're not closer to God.
[2:09:41] Doesn't matter if we're healthier if
[2:09:42] we're not closer to God. Paul said, I or
[2:09:45] John said, I believe, I would that thou
[2:09:47] would prosper and be in good health,
[2:09:49] even as thy soul doth prosper. Jesus
[2:09:53] said it simply, seek ye first the
[2:09:55] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[2:09:57] and all these things will be added to
[2:09:59] you.
[2:10:00] You know what righteousness is?
[2:10:03] It means acceptable to God. There's only
[2:10:06] one way you can be acceptable to God,
[2:10:07] and that's in Christ. But it's also to
[2:10:10] live your life by his will day by day.
[2:10:14] And that's where we've got to be able to
[2:10:15] take inventory.
[2:10:19] You know, I've got a burden and I don't
[2:10:21] just want us coming to church.
[2:10:24] I was sharing with my wife today and I
[2:10:26] won't share the specifics,
[2:10:28] but I said I had I rewrite my prayer
[2:10:30] list every well once I fill up the
[2:10:32] pages. I have every family in this
[2:10:34] church is on my prayer list. And as
[2:10:37] needs come and go, I I add them in and I
[2:10:39] cross them out. And two years ago, I had
[2:10:42] something that I noticed with certain
[2:10:45] people. Might have been single people,
[2:10:47] might have been families. Two.
[2:10:51] This time
[2:10:53] we're up to six.
[2:10:55] six families or groups of people or
[2:10:58] individuals
[2:11:01] where things I'm seeing are pointing to
[2:11:04] a cooling off,
[2:11:07] a falling away,
[2:11:09] a degenerating of your relationship with
[2:11:11] Christ.
[2:11:13] That's why I'm preaching this tonight.
[2:11:17] That hurt when I wrote it out. I said,
[2:11:18] "Lord, we're getting worse, not better,
[2:11:20] in these areas."
[2:11:22] It's not up for debate. It's not up for,
[2:11:25] oh, that's just perception. No, it's
[2:11:26] obvious. It's clear.
[2:11:28] I say, Lord, don't help us. Help us not
[2:11:30] to cool off.
[2:11:33] Lord, help us to stay tight
[2:11:36] to your word. Amen.
[2:11:40] Church, we need him to be the priority
[2:11:41] of our lives day in and day out. The
[2:11:44] center of our life. Amen. The center of
[2:11:46] our decisions, the center of our being.
[2:11:48] In him, we live and move and have our
[2:11:51] being. Remember, we remember that
[2:11:52] scripture. We've read that. I say, Lord,
[2:11:54] help us today.
[2:11:56] Amen.
[2:12:00] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[2:12:04] Lord Jesus,
[2:12:07] Lord, you know my heart tonight,
[2:12:11] Lord. And it's your word.
[2:12:13] It's your message.
[2:12:15] It's your bride. It's your church.
[2:12:27] But Lord, if your prophet was screaming
[2:12:29] it out in the first church age and in
[2:12:32] the second church age and all the way
[2:12:33] through to the seventh, Lord, I pray
[2:12:35] that your Holy Spirit would cry out
[2:12:37] tonight. Don't cool off.
[2:12:42] Lord, we've got a choice to make.
[2:12:45] Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[2:12:48] But for me and my house, we will serve
[2:12:50] the Lord.
[2:12:53] Lord, I pray you help us to take
[2:12:55] inventory tonight.
[2:12:57] Lord, that we're not cooling off.
[2:13:00] That this isn't just church, Lord, but
[2:13:02] that it is life and death. Lord, your
[2:13:05] prophet said it's the Holy Ghost or
[2:13:06] perish.
[2:13:09] Lord, I pray your mercy would fall
[2:13:10] tonight where we've cooled off.
[2:13:14] Lord, where we've willingly walked down
[2:13:16] a road of our own choosing and making.
[2:13:20] Lord, where we've elevated something
[2:13:21] else above our first love, which is you.
[2:13:24] Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me.
[2:13:29] Lord, I pray we could repent tonight
[2:13:31] even of this.
[2:13:34] Lord, we've said anything ahead of you.
[2:13:38] Lord, I pray your mercy and grace to us.
[2:13:40] Lord, let us take inventory tonight
[2:13:42] soberly.
[2:13:43] Lord, not trying to pin anyone to the
[2:13:45] wall, Lord. Not trying to work something
[2:13:48] up or pull anything down, Lord. But may
[2:13:49] we look inwardly in our hearts and say,
[2:13:51] Lord, are you the center of my life,
[2:13:55] Lord, am I putting all imaginations and
[2:13:58] every thought, Lord, subject to you?
[2:14:01] Lord, am I walking in a way of my own
[2:14:03] will?
[2:14:05] Grace to your people tonight, heavenly
[2:14:07] father, I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:14:11] Amen.
[2:14:14] Create in me a clean heart. 150.
[2:14:22] Create
[2:14:24] in me
[2:14:26] a clean
[2:14:28] heart,
[2:14:32] oh
[2:14:33] God,
[2:14:38] and renew a right spirit
[2:14:42] within
[2:14:44] me.
[2:14:51] Create in me
[2:14:54] a plea
[2:14:57] heart.
[2:15:00] Oh
[2:15:02] God,
[2:15:07] and renew a right spirit
[2:15:11] within
[2:15:13] me.
[2:15:20] and cast me not
[2:15:23] away
[2:15:26] from thy presence,
[2:15:31] oh Lord,
[2:15:35] and take not thy holy
[2:15:40] spirit from me.
[2:15:48] Restore
[2:15:51] art to me
[2:15:56] the joy of thy salvation
[2:16:05] and renew a right spirit
[2:16:09] within
[2:16:11] me.
[2:16:14] Create in me
[2:16:17] a clean
[2:16:20] heart,
[2:16:24] oh
[2:16:25] God,
[2:16:30] and renew a right spirit
[2:16:35] within
[2:16:36] me.
[2:16:43] Create in me
[2:16:46] a clean
[2:16:49] heart,
[2:16:53] oh
[2:16:54] God,
[2:16:59] and renew a right spirit
[2:17:03] within
[2:17:05] me.
[2:17:12] and cast me God away
[2:17:18] from thy presence,
[2:17:23] oh Lord,
[2:17:27] and take not thy holy
[2:17:32] spirit from me.
[2:17:40] Restore
[2:17:43] unto
[2:17:45] me
[2:17:48] the joy of thy salvation
[2:17:57] and renew arise spirit
[2:18:01] with ite cast me not away
[2:18:06] and cast me not away
[2:18:12] from thy presence,
[2:18:17] oh Lord.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Take not thy holy
[2:18:26] spirit from me.
[2:18:34] Restore
[2:18:37] out to me
[2:18:42] the joy of thy
[2:18:45] salvation
[2:18:51] and renew a bright spirit
[2:18:55] within me.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; This is my heart I give you or this my

[2:25:16] more time.
[2:25:20] So, draw me,

[2:25:40] me.
[2:25:43] Draw me, Lord,
[2:25:47] and I'll come running after you.
[2:25:53] Brother Chad, will you come close, Chad?
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:26:11] Oh, Father God, when you draw us, Lord,
[2:26:16] please, whatever tries to stop us,
[2:26:17] Father, let nothing hinder
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; your call, Lord.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Your call on our life, Lord.
[2:26:26] Sometimes, Father God, we get complacent
[2:26:29] and we allow things in and things
[2:26:31] that'll hinder us, Lord. And we either
[2:26:34] willfully, Father, or unknowingly, Lord,
[2:26:38] we lay it at your feet, Father God.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father God, get to the place,
[2:26:46] Lord, that you really called us to be.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; You called us. You separated us. You
[2:26:54] raised us up a different people, Lord.
[2:26:58] We know the enemy is fighting that,
[2:26:59] Lord. And we just ask for your grace in
[2:27:02] its victory, Lord. Lord, not to be a big
[2:27:06] somebody, Lord, but to be somebody in
[2:27:09] your eyes, Lord.
[2:27:14] Father, those struggling, Lord, having a
[2:27:17] hard time, Father,
[2:27:19] I pray grace for them today, Lord.
[2:27:23] I'm forgetting our family as well. Lord,
[2:27:25] we just pray that you move in our lives,
[2:27:28] Father, a lot stronger than anything out
[2:27:30] there that's trying to pull us left or
[2:27:32] right, Lord.
[2:27:35] Thank you for all you've done, Lord. All
[2:27:37] you continue to do, Lord. Father God,
[2:27:41] you said you'd have a little church,
[2:27:42] Lord. I believe that we are the ones,
[2:27:45] Lord.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I thank you, Father,
[2:27:48] for friends and family, Lord, that pray
[2:27:50] and and
[2:27:52] love one another, Lord, and and a pastor
[2:27:54] who cares, Lord, and and really stands
[2:27:56] for your word, Lord. I pray, Lord, that
[2:27:59] you bless Brother John, restore any
[2:28:01] virtue that has left his body, Lord, be
[2:28:03] with his family in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:28:05] Amen.
