[10:34] amen praise the Lord
[10:37] amen let's sing throw it all praise the
[10:42] Lord this we approach the throne
[10:44] tonight that's been a Carson to come and
[10:46] just lead us in prayer tonight
[10:48] let's remember to pray for brother Mike
[10:50] because he brings the the word praying
[10:53] one for another as we we approached
[10:55] tonight that God would just give us the
[10:57] faith to meet our needs in remembering
[11:01] also the Saints around the island today
[11:03] and those that just need to touch from
[11:06] the Lord and just want to remember each
[11:08] one also brother runs snows son-in-law
[11:12] his name is Larry penny he's that prayer
[11:15] has been requested for him he's in a lot
[11:19] of pain throughout his body and he's
[11:21] bent over so prayer was requested for
[11:23] him and also brother Gerald's brother
[11:26] Calvin who is his health is
[11:29] deteriorating brother and Gerald
[11:31] mentioned that to me so we want to
[11:33] remember him as well also
[11:37] system or Venus mother she just asked us
[11:40] to submit asked me to pass out thanks to
[11:44] everybody for praying for her and she's
[11:46] leveled off and she's doing much better
[11:49] so we want to thank the Lord for for
[11:51] that for answering prayer amen
[11:54] so and also there was a special request
[11:56] that was received this week though
[11:59] Jarrell sent it on to me and it had to
[12:01] do with Isis in Iraq they had attacked a
[12:08] small town in northern Iraq and they
[12:12] went from house to house trying to get
[12:16] the children to renounce Christ this was
[12:19] there was missionaries there in in that
[12:22] town and they had been I guess that the
[12:25] families have been converted to
[12:27] Christianity and Isis was after the
[12:30] children to to renounce Christ and the
[12:34] children refused the faith had been
[12:36] instilled in them
[12:37] they refused and each child was killed
[12:39] out from house to house in front of
[12:42] parents so the missionaries had
[12:45] requested prayer for them because they
[12:48] everybody else kind of had left but the
[12:50] missionary said we want to stay and help
[12:52] the families so there's great fear for
[12:56] their lives so prayer was requested for
[12:59] those missionaries that are operating
[13:02] over in that kind of those kind of
[13:05] conditions and we think we have problems
[13:09] you know it really really pales compared
[13:11] to that when you're faced with when
[13:14] you're faced with death for what you
[13:16] believe so thank God for His grace to us
[13:18] but remember those people today and
[13:20] there's many others you just want to
[13:22] remember
[13:23] so let's let's sing that through it all
[13:27] as we approach the throne brother Karsan

[44:02] father God is real to me of course is
[44:05] the sing years ago he meant by the grace
[44:08] of God by because we've been born again
[44:11] that's why he's real to me we've been

[44:21] drink the word man whatever form that
[44:23] the Lord gives it we're going to receive
[44:26] it by the grace of God so the Lord bless
[44:29] you let's be in prayer for our brother
[44:31] Mike as he comes the minutes of the word
[44:33] tonight god bless you god bless the
[44:37] revelation in his art as it comes forth
[44:39] by the grace of God amen and again I
[44:43] believe in llegar our brother Lonnie
[44:46] jenkins said and and maybe to me
[44:49] personally and might have been on
[44:51] annotate somewhere but he said you know
[44:55] when he would go to church and because
[44:57] he was an evangelist and a navy or a
[45:00] teacher rather of the word and he would
[45:02] going to this a certain church and he
[45:04] had a certain pastor and then he had a
[45:06] question he said i go i go in the spirit
[45:09] and he said an IV praying down lord I
[45:12] pray that you
[45:13] lay it on the brother's heart to answer
[45:16] the question that I have on my heart a
[45:18] man nor that Heath and yet you're huge
[45:21] with the minister for this for the
[45:23] pastor is going to answer my questions
[45:25] and it's going to dissolve maybe your
[45:27] doubts a man but you had to come in the
[45:30] spirit you got to come recognizing your
[45:33] need and believing that God is able to
[45:36] meet the need a man and brother and
[45:40] brother Lonnie Jenkins said he said
[45:42] brother he said God never failed me once
[45:45] he said every time he said that he said
[45:49] that I went with a question he said God
[45:51] never failed to lay it on the pastor's
[45:54] heart and he said he answered the
[45:56] question though he said he didn't know
[45:58] he said that I was looking for the
[46:00] answer amen
[46:02] so God will do that tonight so our
[46:04] brother Mike as he comes as a minister
[46:06] of the word Eli answer your questions if
[46:09] there's all of your doubts and if your
[46:11] spirit is right you need greatly
[46:13] increase your faith a man he Lily he'll
[46:16] heal your body no matter what they want
[46:18] your problem is
[46:20] come on Little Billy that's Billy and
[46:23] again we as we have somebody ministered
[46:27] on it if you can't believe for healing
[46:29] are you going to believe for the rapture
[46:30] I'll deal with her brother Paul might
[46:32] have mentioned it in his message and
[46:34] then i quoting the prophet because why
[46:38] because the rapture is healing of the
[46:41] total total healing of the body is the
[46:43] total change of the body by the grace of
[46:45] Almighty God amen it is the absolute
[46:48] redemption of the body so have you been
[46:51] redeemed spiritually in your soul you
[46:53] have experienced redemption in your soul
[46:55] you're a new creature in Christ in your
[46:57] soul then you're calling for the new
[47:00] body like his glorified body
[47:04] so that God increase our faith because
[47:07] we're getting closer brake hitting
[47:09] closer so grace to us on this stand on
[47:12] this thing I only believe all things are
[47:14] possible only believe as our brother
[47:16] comes and God give him the Liberty let
[47:19] go and let God of his way Amen Lord
[47:22] bless you and the Lord bless our I would
[47:27] say our visitors but it's just our
[47:29] brothers and sisters from outside the
[47:31] city so god bless you and our sister
[47:34] Kimberly is still with us from the the
[47:37] United States I guess that's why we

[47:43] and all the saints clad our brother

[53:57] man you all may be seated for a moment
[54:01] thank you amen
[54:03] you could see everybody again last year
[54:08] when I come we were strangers and now
[54:12] most of us were not strangers anymore so
[54:17] I just thank the Lord for the
[54:19] opportunity to come back and visit
[54:21] Newfoundland first and transatlantic
[54:27] flight first Morse code they got a dog
[54:31] that nobody else knows what do is it
[54:33] comes from here and I got a bird they'd
[54:36] never seen before it comes from here so
[54:41] I found out a lot about neutral in the
[54:43] last year you know it's the first and
[54:45] everything just about and first foot
[54:49] brother branham on the internet you know
[54:51] and of course this nation didn't do that
[54:54] with a Newfoundlander did do that so
[54:58] that represents you amen and so we're
[55:02] all different tongues and Kindred's and
[55:05] Nations but we've been called up by one
[55:09] blood and just thank the Lord for that
[55:12] just you know appreciate little mark and
[55:15] his wife and I think they're both mercy
[55:20] gifts you know I remember years ago
[55:23] there was a brother preached on gifts of
[55:25] the other Spirit in the church of course
[55:27] everybody come really ready to go and
[55:29] and he talked about prophetically gift
[55:31] administrative gift mercy gift and
[55:34] different kind of gifts you know and
[55:36] everybody was kind of let down and up
[55:39] and you know didn't know exactly what to
[55:41] do with it and so I was just watching
[55:49] brother and sister coffee dinner
[55:50] demeanor and they just or they just wait
[55:53] on you hand and foot and the text
[55:57] messages you know I probably got about
[55:58] not quite a thousand but I got a lot of
[56:01] text messages you know how you doing you
[56:03] have to close on tight eyed and you know
[56:06] and you drink your water this morning
[56:07] you have breakfast you got your ticket
[56:10] and he said you he was watching me you
[56:13] know and he was watching the plane watch
[56:14] me come over here and not get to Atlanta
[56:17] he said well I see you got there on time
[56:18] I said yeah I did he said I see you all
[56:24] make good timing and you got trial just
[56:27] just good yeah yeah how'd you know that
[56:31] you know let me know when you get to the
[56:33] gate and you know I thought yeah I've
[56:37] always said this about a pastor and a
[56:39] and an evangelist you can tell the
[56:40] difference you know like if we're all
[56:42] going to go have a picnic and somebody's
[56:45] going to lead you know don't ever put
[56:46] the Evangelist in the front you know
[56:48] because he never he never notices that
[56:51] the light changes or not he just goes
[56:53] right through there and he doesn't see
[56:55] who made it through the light and who
[56:56] didn't make it through the light he's
[56:57] just trying to get to the picnic area
[56:59] and he gets her and he looks Rises well
[57:01] where is everybody
[57:02] and then the pastor he's looking in the
[57:05] rearview mirror hey brother so young he
[57:07] made it he thought we better slow down
[57:09] let them catch up you know he's he's
[57:11] really looking over everybody and and
[57:14] that's kind of way brother coffee and
[57:15] sister coffee is they just kind of hover
[57:17] over you want soup well I don't know
[57:19] come on I have some soup I got two
[57:21] different kinds you want some cookies
[57:23] well you know I don't yeah come on have
[57:25] a cookie you know you want this you want
[57:27] that and they just hover over you and
[57:30] it's just special people here you know
[57:33] it's kind of like the bird and the dog
[57:35] and now it's people and even though we
[57:38] come from the human race it's a special
[57:40] people here in Newfoundland and and I
[57:43] was thinking about brother lush brother
[57:45] coffees this brother lush he'll probably
[57:48] come around 12 o'clock it's on meet you
[57:51] for lunch tomorrow okay sorry I got up
[57:54] this morning a little bit slow and I
[57:57] knew I was gonna be late getting up son
[58:00] Tex brother coffee and said well
[58:02] before twelve and then I looked I said
[58:05] oh goodness already got two texts from
[58:07] them this morning didn't realize he has
[58:10] texted before I got up and got my phone
[58:12] on he said they just come between 12:00
[58:16] and 12:30 or 12:30 and 1:00 I said oh
[58:18] perfect you know text them back that's
[58:20] fine so I figure that you know a lot of
[58:23] times a ministry he'll come and he'll
[58:25] just pop up college that okay I'm here
[58:27] so I'm trying to get ready you know and
[58:29] brother uh she calls he says okay I'm
[58:31] fixing to leave be there about 15 to 1 I
[58:35] said okay he says now I got a I got a
[58:39] light sweater on I said oh must be a
[58:41] little chilly out this is you know okay
[58:43] so I got the instructions when to be
[58:45] down and how to dress and everything you
[58:47] know and I was thinking about that and I
[58:49] thought you know back in the old days
[58:52] when they used to duel you know they
[58:54] some guy you know he'd get an argument
[58:56] with somebody and fuss with him and he'd
[58:58] take his glove and slap I'm going across
[58:59] the face and that was challenged him to
[59:01] a duel when I said you know brother lush
[59:03] he countered reminds me he's so
[59:04] methodical and everything and and he'd
[59:07] probably say okay prepare to defend
[59:10] yourself and the reason why I person
[59:14] says that is because they're not afraid
[59:15] you know they're they're self-confident
[59:19] in their armor and inner weapons and I
[59:22] said you know if he ever faces the devil
[59:24] he's guys they prepared to defend
[59:27] yourself you know that's what David did
[59:30] he didn't try to side blind Goliath he
[59:32] didn't try to come in behind I mean
[59:34] instinct and he just come down he said I
[59:36] come to you in the name of the Lord and
[59:38] prepared to defend yourself and and so
[59:41] brother Lucky's is like that he's just
[59:43] solid as a rock
[59:44] you know he's hankered and and you like
[59:47] people like that and you want people
[59:49] answered but you don't want them
[59:51] dogmatic and I don't find he's dogmatic
[59:53] that means when you just you know when I
[59:55] say it there's a period behind it and
[59:57] that's it and that's denomination but
[1:00:01] Jesus he he he knew where he come from
[1:00:04] and he knew who he was
[1:00:08] and I find in this age there's a lot of
[1:00:10] insecurity and I looked that up one time
[1:00:16] to find out what insecurity had not what
[1:00:19] it is but how it reacts a person that's
[1:00:22] insecure usually they they project
[1:00:25] himself as a controller because they're
[1:00:28] insecure so they want to control takes
[1:00:31] all he was insecure he wasn't you know
[1:00:36] if he if he didn't know that God set him
[1:00:38] there and that he was call of God and
[1:00:41] that was his church he he wouldn't try
[1:00:44] to retain to that but because of
[1:00:47] insecurity he became a controller and
[1:00:49] and then fine you know sometimes with
[1:00:52] new Christians we we come into
[1:00:55] Christianity we come into the message
[1:00:56] and the first thing we think now when I
[1:00:59] go to work I'm a Christian now and I'm
[1:01:01] gonna show everybody at work I'm a
[1:01:03] Christian
[1:01:03] that's insecurity because we don't have
[1:01:07] to prove anything to anybody if you know
[1:01:10] who you are and where you come from then
[1:01:13] then that you're secure but when you try
[1:01:17] to prove something to somebody it's
[1:01:19] because you are insecure you're not only
[1:01:21] trying to prove to them but you're
[1:01:22] trying to convince yourself
[1:01:24] and so when Saint attacked Jesus he said
[1:01:29] well if you be the Son of Man do this he
[1:01:32] didn't have to do nothing because he
[1:01:35] knew who he was he wasn't insecure Saint
[1:01:37] was insecure you know Saint you wouldn't
[1:01:41] think he's insecure but he's a
[1:01:42] controller he controls with fear and
[1:01:45] intimidation why does he do that because
[1:01:48] he's insecure in his kingdom and so what
[1:01:52] we want to do is we want to be
[1:01:54] established in this present day truth
[1:01:58] now we see all these things taking place
[1:02:00] around this we in the heavens we got the
[1:02:02] blood moons and we got to the Sabbath's
[1:02:06] year and all these things that's going
[1:02:08] on you see Israel being rejected by them
[1:02:11] the United States president and and most
[1:02:14] of the Congress and and then we find
[1:02:18] that they're welcome them though the
[1:02:20] Pope you know and he's coming in and
[1:02:22] he's going to be speaking to a Catholic
[1:02:25] Congress you know we got more Catholics
[1:02:27] in our in our Congress and then we got
[1:02:29] anything is the first time we've never
[1:02:32] had a setting Protestant on to some
[1:02:36] freedom court
[1:02:36] we got Catholics but we don't have any
[1:02:38] Protestants this last year when there
[1:02:41] was a presidential race there was no
[1:02:45] Protestant in the race and brother brown
[1:02:48] said now you watch Kennedy he said he's
[1:02:50] going to come in he'd probably a good
[1:02:52] person but he said he's going to open a
[1:02:55] door and he said you watch her talking
[1:02:58] about the church now Catholic Church you
[1:03:00] watch a worm her way all the way in he'd
[1:03:03] learned her way into the Supreme Court
[1:03:05] until they have no regard for the
[1:03:07] Constitution because when they voted for
[1:03:11] gay rights
[1:03:12] they broke the Constitution by taking
[1:03:15] the state rights away from them and
[1:03:16] declaring that the federal government is
[1:03:18] going to tell them what to do that
[1:03:20] breaks the constitution brother Brown
[1:03:22] said when when Kennedy sent the troops
[1:03:25] down to Little Rock he broke the
[1:03:26] Constitution because he took away the
[1:03:28] right of that state to decide whether
[1:03:31] they want integration or not so we find
[1:03:33] at that principle that they broke that
[1:03:36] Constitution even the Chief Justice of
[1:03:39] our Supreme Court said this had nothing
[1:03:41] to do with the Constitution because all
[1:03:44] they can do is interpret the law they
[1:03:47] cannot enforce the law they cannot make
[1:03:49] laws they are not an active group
[1:03:51] they're lawyers that have been appointed
[1:03:53] by the President to define the law
[1:03:56] that's all that they can do but they
[1:03:58] actually passed a law and broke the
[1:04:00] Constitution by doing that so we're just
[1:04:03] right at the we're at the end time we
[1:04:07] see all these things around us and we're
[1:04:09] looking at now here comes this poll
[1:04:11] and now he's announced a year Libertines
[1:04:14] and we're looking at was it all in and
[1:04:17] people are looking for things to happen
[1:04:20] I tell you what I'm looking for because
[1:04:24] I know we're so close to the end time
[1:04:26] brother Brown said the rapture is a
[1:04:28] revelation and that doesn't mean a new
[1:04:31] thought we're not waiting for somebody
[1:04:33] to come with a surprise revelation how
[1:04:35] this message like hatching an egg I'm
[1:04:38] just some new creature coming out we're
[1:04:40] waiting for inspiration to strike the
[1:04:43] word that's in you and I to bring it
[1:04:45] into a reality he said we've accepted
[1:04:48] the great truths of this Bible but too
[1:04:51] many it's not real why because it hasn't
[1:04:53] been inspired so we've accepted the
[1:04:56] great things of this Bible it said when
[1:04:58] the bride recognizes who she is when she
[1:05:01] recognizes her position she'll be gone
[1:05:05] so there's not anybody here hasn't
[1:05:07] recognized our position but there's an
[1:05:09] inspiration that comes to that
[1:05:12] he said you got enough faith right here
[1:05:14] to create worlds but he said now there's
[1:05:17] a law to that if you're born again and
[1:05:20] you have the Holy Ghost you got enough
[1:05:21] power to go on the rapture you're going
[1:05:24] to power to speak a world you're going
[1:05:26] to power but but what is it we recognize
[1:05:29] who we are but we ain't got the power to
[1:05:31] get out of here yet why because there's
[1:05:34] a key to that and he said the key is the
[1:05:37] law faith he said whatever God leads
[1:05:41] your soul to believe that's how much
[1:05:43] faith that you can have so what are we
[1:05:46] waiting for
[1:05:46] we're not waiting for a new thought on
[1:05:48] the revelation we're waiting for the
[1:05:51] inspiration to strike that we just step
[1:05:55] across into that so as we're watching
[1:05:58] all these world events I'm watching the
[1:06:01] ministry because the Holy Spirit Christ
[1:06:04] has to release that inspiration through
[1:06:09] the ministry to bring us to this rapture
[1:06:12] in faith so I'm watching the trend it
[1:06:16] was God sent a prophet and what'd he say
[1:06:18] and but now there has to come an
[1:06:21] inspiration through the ministry because
[1:06:23] the ministry is to bring
[1:06:24] to the perfection to the maturity until
[1:06:28] we're not intimidated were no longer
[1:06:30] tossed to and fro but were secured we
[1:06:33] know where we come from we know who we
[1:06:36] are and we know where we're going and we
[1:06:39] under complete control and I'm looking
[1:06:43] for that to come through the ministry
[1:06:45] I'm watching the trend of what's being
[1:06:47] ministered and you can watch it through
[1:06:49] change since since I come in on the
[1:06:52] message you watch the change how the son
[1:06:55] of man really broke forth and then and
[1:06:57] then these things broke forth and these
[1:06:59] things broke forth so I'm not just
[1:07:01] looking for the Pope to come those
[1:07:03] things are fine and that's part of
[1:07:05] prophecy being fulfilled but I'm
[1:07:07] watching the revelation of inspiration
[1:07:10] that's coming to the bride and it's
[1:07:13] going to take away all insecurity and
[1:07:17] Saint not going to intimidate you not
[1:07:19] with cancer not with tuberculosis not
[1:07:23] with death he said old death would be
[1:07:25] crawling up like an old spiders that get
[1:07:27] behind me death see it'll have to be a
[1:07:30] inspiration that God releases to you and
[1:07:33] I in the time that we have neato so as
[1:07:37] we said last time and as I heard brother
[1:07:39] less then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:07:42] hearing by the word and the word being
[1:07:44] the Word of God and it has to come
[1:07:47] through a ministry that's sent of God
[1:07:49] because that's what the scripture says
[1:07:51] but hearing is not faith but hearing
[1:07:55] comes by faith so hearing and in the
[1:07:59] inspiration on the hearing brings faith
[1:08:02] because everybody has heard the Word of
[1:08:05] God doesn't have faith and it could have
[1:08:07] come through an anointed servant could
[1:08:09] it come in the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] but without inspiration doesn't profit
[1:08:14] to anything so we want to be walking
[1:08:17] with God but the inspiration would come
[1:08:20] upon the word as it comes to you and on
[1:08:22] as you sit there meditating reading your
[1:08:25] Bible looking at amount and looking at
[1:08:27] the sea listening to the wind listening
[1:08:29] to a message and here come that
[1:08:31] inspiration rolling in and it's just
[1:08:34] like somebody turns on the light
[1:08:35] you struggle it things you struggle it
[1:08:38] things and you sit down there
[1:08:40] you read one little word and all of a
[1:08:41] sudden by the inspiration of Holy Ghost
[1:08:44] one word it just like a an avalanche
[1:08:47] it's like a flood just comes running all
[1:08:49] sudden all these thoughts just come easy
[1:08:52] oh yeah that makes sense yeah that
[1:08:55] that's how this fits together and that
[1:08:56] fits together
[1:08:57] the only he can do them and that's what
[1:09:03] we're waiting on a man let's stand the
[1:09:06] head if we will I want to turn to second
[1:09:09] Peter and I know this is dangerous
[1:09:11] because I know the Newfie Bible is a
[1:09:12] little bit different than mine the last
[1:09:14] time I was here y'all didn't have the
[1:09:16] scripture that we have in our English
[1:09:18] Bibles and the new few Bible I guess was
[1:09:20] translate a little bit different but
[1:09:22] this time I'm trying to stay within the
[1:09:24] rims of your of your Bible that you have
[1:09:27] here in Newfoundland so we don't kind of
[1:09:29] leave you behind
[1:09:30] so in 2nd Peter chapter 1 I guess you
[1:09:34] got chapter 1 right you got yours Joseph
[1:09:37] chapter 1 okay alright second Peter
[1:09:41] chapter 1 and we're going to read verses
[1:09:44] 15 through 21 that's why I got in my
[1:09:48] bottom ones I hope we're on the same
[1:09:50] page alright 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse
[1:09:56] 15 moreover I will endeavor that you may
[1:10:01] be able after my decease to have these
[1:10:04] things always in remembrance for we have
[1:10:08] not followed cunningly devised fables
[1:10:10] when we made known unto you the power
[1:10:14] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:10:18] we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for
[1:10:22] he received from God for he received
[1:10:26] from God the Father honor and glory when
[1:10:29] we were there came such a voice to him
[1:10:32] talking about their own Mount
[1:10:33] Transfiguration from him the excellency
[1:10:37] the excellent glory this is my beloved
[1:10:40] Son in whom I'm well pleased and this
[1:10:43] voice which came from heaven we heard
[1:10:46] and when we were with him
[1:10:49] and we heard when we were with him in
[1:10:51] the Holy Mount we have also a more sure
[1:10:56] word of prophecy we're on to you do well
[1:11:01] that you take heed as unto a light that
[1:11:04] shine it in a dark place until the day
[1:11:07] dawn and the day star arise in your
[1:11:10] hearts knowing this first that no
[1:11:13] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:11:17] private interpretation for the prophecy
[1:11:20] came not not not in all time by the will
[1:11:25] of man but by holy men of God spake as
[1:11:29] they were moved by the Holy Ghost may we
[1:11:33] just bow our heads
[1:11:35] Heavenly Father Lord as we approach your
[1:11:39] word tonight we know that without you we
[1:11:41] can do nothing and anything that we do
[1:11:44] without you is nothing but you promises
[1:11:48] or whatever two or three would gather
[1:11:50] themselves together in your name that
[1:11:53] you would be in our mist so father our
[1:11:56] gathering this evening is around you not
[1:12:00] just your word but your presence so
[1:12:04] father may you manifest yourself to your
[1:12:06] children may you unveil yourself as you
[1:12:09] promised to do as many as love you and
[1:12:12] was obedient to your commandments then
[1:12:15] father may you come tonight may you
[1:12:17] inspire me may you inspire the
[1:12:19] congregation may we be caught up
[1:12:22] together in one mind one soul and one
[1:12:25] Accord may you also pour out your
[1:12:28] anointing and break any yoke that would
[1:12:31] Fedder us tonight
[1:12:33] that we might be totally freed and
[1:12:35] liberated in the spirit to receive from
[1:12:38] you as you would give to each child of
[1:12:40] yours this evening the hidden manna so
[1:12:43] father we ask these things in Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ's name Amen
[1:12:48] amen you may be seated yet our desire is
[1:12:53] like I was saying it's not really to
[1:12:56] bring something new or something
[1:12:58] different that would just amaze you but
[1:13:02] to be established in this present day
[1:13:04] truth and that's what we want to be
[1:13:07] that's what the ministry is for is to
[1:13:10] bring us to that place that were
[1:13:12] established and true faith and that by
[1:13:15] the Word of God that you and I can stand
[1:13:17] now I'm looking at three words prophecy
[1:13:24] preeminence and perfection and so I just
[1:13:28] want to look at these three words maybe
[1:13:30] today and tomorrow and maybe Sunday and
[1:13:34] we we had this discussion in a ministers
[1:13:39] meeting here oh I think it was last
[1:13:41] Saturday and I was just so inspired by
[1:13:44] the things that that the Lord laid on my
[1:13:46] heart I was trying to go a different
[1:13:47] route but it just seemed like this the
[1:13:49] way that he wanted me to go so so we're
[1:13:52] going to try to follow the leading of
[1:13:54] the Spirit prophecy preeminence and
[1:13:59] perfection and to me that these that
[1:14:02] these three things work together on a
[1:14:04] body because I'm not looking at three
[1:14:07] separate things but I am looking at
[1:14:09] three separate things I look at the the
[1:14:12] Feast of Unleavened the Feast of
[1:14:15] Pentecost and the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:14:18] now there's seven feasts but when when
[1:14:20] God broke these feasts down he gathered
[1:14:22] him into three parts because we had the
[1:14:25] feast of Passover the Feast of
[1:14:27] Unleavened and the sheaf wave all
[1:14:28] together and God called it the Feast of
[1:14:31] Unleavened and and then we had the feast
[1:14:35] of Pentecost now you could just come and
[1:14:37] partake of the feast of Pentecost unless
[1:14:40] that you'd already ferpa taken of the
[1:14:42] feast of Passover and the sheaf wave and
[1:14:45] unleavened and you actually couldn't
[1:14:48] even protect that unless that you were
[1:14:51] in a covenant relationship you had to be
[1:14:54] circumcised you had to be in the seat of
[1:14:58] Abraham and then being
[1:15:00] a covenant relationship with him then
[1:15:03] you could participate or be part of that
[1:15:05] Feast of Unleavened and then that would
[1:15:09] carry you over to the feast of Pentecost
[1:15:12] and then that would bring you to the
[1:15:14] Feast of Tabernacles which was the Feast
[1:15:16] of Trumpets and the feast of or the Day
[1:15:19] of Atonement and then the feast or the
[1:15:22] Feast of Tabernacles so we find it it's
[1:15:25] one it's one continuous revelation and
[1:15:29] it makes a complete revelation it makes
[1:15:32] a complete cycle and so it is with with
[1:15:35] justification and sanctification and the
[1:15:39] baptism of the holy ghost now it takes
[1:15:41] all three of those to bring a complete
[1:15:44] birth and you can't come to
[1:15:46] sanctification unless you first come to
[1:15:48] justification yet we find men many times
[1:15:52] that he's never been justified but he's
[1:15:54] trying to get sanctified but in God's
[1:15:57] economy you can't come to sanctification
[1:15:59] unless you first come to justification
[1:16:02] but in his economy you can come to
[1:16:05] justification and stop and never go no
[1:16:07] farther but if we continue in that birth
[1:16:10] then you come to sanctification and in
[1:16:14] sanctification brings you to the baptism
[1:16:16] of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:17] and I'm not son necessarily talking in
[1:16:19] state steps or our time but we're
[1:16:22] talking in an event in your life when
[1:16:24] you're born again it could come in an
[1:16:26] instant we find in Cornelius that while
[1:16:29] he sat there and listened to the word he
[1:16:31] was he was sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:16:33] so that means he was justified he was
[1:16:36] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:16:38] Ghost while he was listening to Peter so
[1:16:41] we know it can come in an instant it
[1:16:44] could come in through time and it's not
[1:16:47] for us to try to figure out where I'm at
[1:16:49] you know one person said well it was a
[1:16:51] minister and he said well you know I got
[1:16:54] justified and found out it wasn't
[1:16:55] sanctified about a year too later I got
[1:16:57] sanctified and then about a year after
[1:17:00] that I got the Holy Ghost and I thought
[1:17:02] well you know that's kind of creating a
[1:17:04] little problem because what's the
[1:17:05] evidence of sanctification
[1:17:08] and then if I get the evidence of
[1:17:10] sanctification that now I know I'm
[1:17:12] sanctified and you justified through
[1:17:17] faith
[1:17:17] there's nothing tangible you can put
[1:17:19] your hand on them - it's like the
[1:17:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:17:24] there's no outward sign well I live
[1:17:27] better okay you know the legalist he
[1:17:30] lives better the Buddhists you know he
[1:17:33] becomes a monk he lives better he he
[1:17:36] gives away all his worldly belongings
[1:17:37] and everything and he and he tries to
[1:17:39] find this peace and self-contentment you
[1:17:42] know their lives are transformed by
[1:17:44] Buddhism Islam is transformed into the
[1:17:47] Islamic faith and so then we can be
[1:17:50] transferred into the into the Christian
[1:17:52] behavior and not have the life of Christ
[1:17:54] in us so we run into a problem here or
[1:17:59] to me it's a problem because I say well
[1:18:01] how did you know you was justified
[1:18:03] because justification comes by faith in
[1:18:06] the Word of God and that along it hasn't
[1:18:08] stand on evidences
[1:18:10] it's the righteousness of God through
[1:18:13] faith are you going to put up so then
[1:18:16] how you gonna know you receive the word
[1:18:19] you believe the word and you're
[1:18:21] justified through faith the faith of
[1:18:23] Christ sanctification takes that air
[1:18:27] desire that evil nature out
[1:18:31] well I'm sanctified because I don't
[1:18:34] smoke anymore well it could be and it
[1:18:37] might not be what's the evidence of
[1:18:39] sanctification that that old desire that
[1:18:42] worldly nature he called it the love of
[1:18:44] the world
[1:18:45] he called it the first husband it's gone
[1:18:48] but then you got to have somebody else
[1:18:50] come back in you got to have headship
[1:18:52] and so the dad comes in the Holy Spirit
[1:18:54] comes in and what's the evidence of the
[1:18:57] Holy Ghost
[1:18:58] well that's receiving the word rage you
[1:19:00] believe running around was prophet yes I
[1:19:02] do I believe he was a prophet you
[1:19:04] believe his teaching on serpent seed yes
[1:19:07] I do the devil believes that you believe
[1:19:10] in one God yes I do I believe in God
[1:19:13] head the devil believes in one God and
[1:19:15] fears and trembles some people believe
[1:19:18] in
[1:19:18] hidden ain't got no fear in them at all
[1:19:21] you know and so then when you really
[1:19:24] come down to it it's kind of like you
[1:19:27] said about that man you know sometimes
[1:19:31] the new birth is so simple we we try to
[1:19:34] religiously approach it
[1:19:37] there was a man one time brother Brandon
[1:19:39] tells the story about that man and he
[1:19:42] was in his office and getting ready to
[1:19:43] go to work that are getting ready to go
[1:19:45] home I think he put on his coat and
[1:19:47] reached in there and there was a piece
[1:19:49] of paper in there I guess it was a
[1:19:50] little track he pulled it out he looked
[1:19:52] at it I said where will you spend
[1:19:54] eternity he kind of looked at that
[1:19:56] walked over and throws it in trash can
[1:19:59] and went to go out the door and he
[1:20:01] stopped he thought about that went back
[1:20:04] over there and he unfolded that you read
[1:20:10] it again you folded it putting the
[1:20:14] pocket and you know he went home started
[1:20:19] praying and got his Bible out we started
[1:20:20] reading his Bible and you know the story
[1:20:23] went to went to Billy Graham's meetings
[1:20:25] and Billy Graham said raise your hand
[1:20:29] come up here and I'll pray for you I
[1:20:32] don't raise his hand went up there and
[1:20:34] prayed for him I don't know I don't so
[1:20:38] he went to Oral Roberts meeting went
[1:20:42] there and I said I ever spoke are not
[1:20:46] old Robert so he went to a Methodist
[1:20:48] Church I guess it was and said well do
[1:20:52] you ever shouted well no I mean they're
[1:20:56] all take them up for the men's prayer
[1:20:58] room crammed through took him up and
[1:21:00] prayed me start shouting all over the
[1:21:02] place he got home they said I don't know
[1:21:07] so he went to Oral Roberts chant Mayton
[1:21:09] went up there and it said well I just
[1:21:12] don't know if I got the Holy Ghost money
[1:21:14] so he then spoke in tongues
[1:21:15] oh no I shouted and raised my hand and I
[1:21:20] never spoke in tongues
[1:21:21] he said ran through me praying through
[1:21:25] he started speaking in tongues and I met
[1:21:28] a man outside the tent he got talking to
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:31] and I can't remember all the details but
[1:21:33] he got talking to that man he says well
[1:21:35] you know there's a prophet in the land
[1:21:37] he can tell you he said oh yeah he said
[1:21:40] who's that he's that all well his name
[1:21:42] was William Branham he said you'd get an
[1:21:44] interview with him and and he'll tell
[1:21:47] you whether you got the Holy Ghost or
[1:21:48] not whether you saved so he got the
[1:21:50] interview and brother brown tells us and
[1:21:52] I assume that's a real case but he tells
[1:21:54] us said the man come in and told them
[1:21:57] all he says he says well sir he said you
[1:22:00] remember when you back went back and
[1:22:02] picked that piece of paper out of
[1:22:03] trashcan he said yes sir he said that's
[1:22:06] when they got it why it changed his life
[1:22:13] why are you sitting in church here
[1:22:15] tonight something changed in your life
[1:22:17] it changed in my life it's so simple
[1:22:22] that the wise look over we look for
[1:22:24] tangible things
[1:22:26] everything that God gives us is my faith
[1:22:28] and that's not blind trust it's a
[1:22:30] revelation
[1:22:31] though the rest of the new birth is the
[1:22:34] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:22:37] personally so I was talking to a man
[1:22:40] young man years ago and his daddy was a
[1:22:44] preacher in the message and and this
[1:22:46] young boy he was quite he was quite I
[1:22:49] guess I'll use the word intelligent
[1:22:52] because he could really catch all the
[1:22:54] types and everything in the message and
[1:22:56] he just surpassed his daddy and
[1:22:57] understanding son of man and everything
[1:22:59] and he was talking to me he had a young
[1:23:02] white boy and he had an afro and he I
[1:23:04] think he smoked pot a little bit at the
[1:23:06] time and he was saying you know and so I
[1:23:09] caught his spirit you know but the new
[1:23:12] birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:14] and he was showing all this that he knew
[1:23:16] and everything and I said there were
[1:23:18] only one problem young man I said Peter
[1:23:22] had a divine revelation but he wasn't
[1:23:25] born again doubt to Christ the Son of
[1:23:29] the Living God Jesus said that's good
[1:23:31] now when you're converted he said then
[1:23:33] go streaking for your brother
[1:23:34] so brother Brown said what is the new
[1:23:37] birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ to you personally he said it's
[1:23:42] something that that takes place between
[1:23:44] you and him and only you and him knows
[1:23:47] that he said Christ is the center of the
[1:23:51] Bible and when you're born again then
[1:23:54] Christ is the center it's the Senate
[1:23:58] revelation of your whole life everything
[1:24:00] is based upon that and then he goes on
[1:24:04] to cite well they said well how do I
[1:24:06] know if I got a revelation he said it
[1:24:08] expresses itself through you not through
[1:24:12] your mouth through your life and he said
[1:24:16] and the life of Jesus Christ is the
[1:24:20] center of that revelation so you can
[1:24:25] have a revelation that's inspired by God
[1:24:28] or that you academically can catch a
[1:24:30] hold of but if the life of Christ is not
[1:24:34] down in that soul that heart then it's
[1:24:38] the life of Christ that is the center of
[1:24:41] that revelation because God is not
[1:24:44] calling you to a Christian life God is
[1:24:48] not demanding that you live a Christian
[1:24:50] life many times the church calls you to
[1:24:53] a Christian life
[1:24:54] stop cutting your hair ladies quit
[1:24:56] wearing pants new men quit running
[1:24:58] around wrong places and this that and
[1:25:00] that many times that Christianity from
[1:25:05] the church natural calls you to a
[1:25:08] Christian life that God is not calling
[1:25:12] you to a Christian life he's calling to
[1:25:15] the life that's within you
[1:25:19] he is quickening the seed that seen you
[1:25:23] and a Christian life comes out of that
[1:25:26] scene so the gospel by the Holy Spirit
[1:25:31] is calling to the life of the seed that
[1:25:34] lays in you take wheat and they place it
[1:25:38] up in the in the gardener's way back
[1:25:40] over into Egypt and in the tombs though
[1:25:42] they found kernels of wheat back there
[1:25:44] now that wheat that we you know it has a
[1:25:50] voice isn't I can't hear it but it has a
[1:25:55] voice it's calling for sunlight it's
[1:26:00] calling for water it's calling for
[1:26:03] ground because there's a life in there
[1:26:05] you say I can't hear it I love it
[1:26:09] there's a voice you take that they've
[1:26:11] taken that out of those those tunes and
[1:26:13] those Garner's that was saved back in
[1:26:15] the days of Joseph and things and they'd
[1:26:18] taken it and they put it in the earth
[1:26:20] and then the rain comes and the Sun
[1:26:24] shines you know what happens life starts
[1:26:27] to come forth so there was in you and me
[1:26:30] a seed we call it a soul and that soul
[1:26:34] was crying out for God it worshiped fire
[1:26:39] or shed totem poles it worshipped money
[1:26:42] and you know and it had a voice that
[1:26:44] soul had a voice and it was crying out
[1:26:48] for life now my spirit heard that voice
[1:26:53] and it interpreted it and it says oh you
[1:26:59] need a girlfriend
[1:27:00] you need money all you need to smoke
[1:27:03] because brother Branham said there was a
[1:27:05] thirst in you and me for God but we
[1:27:09] quenched it by worldly things so the
[1:27:12] problem was as my spirit didn't
[1:27:14] understand the language of my soul but
[1:27:17] it could catch the influence that it
[1:27:19] knew it was crying for something so in
[1:27:22] the misinterpretation of the voice of
[1:27:25] the soul it cried out for earthly things
[1:27:28] something to bring comfort something to
[1:27:31] bring
[1:27:32] something to bring peace something to
[1:27:34] bring a security in my life and so my
[1:27:38] spirit trying to understand the soul was
[1:27:42] trying to satisfy that desire but one
[1:27:46] day one day he stood in your way like he
[1:27:52] did the woman at the well he got right
[1:27:56] in front of you because he's the word he
[1:27:59] wasn't attract he wasn't somebody
[1:28:02] quoting scripture to you but he was the
[1:28:05] word himself bringing himself to you
[1:28:07] through a vessel into a written word but
[1:28:12] he came and he confronted you like he
[1:28:14] did the woman at the well and he could
[1:28:17] hear that boys crying and he was the
[1:28:20] water of life and he poured some water
[1:28:23] on there and you came to life and your
[1:28:27] desires changed now the things that you
[1:28:31] do why why do they why why do they
[1:28:34] grieve you because now there's something
[1:28:37] in there that's causing you to be
[1:28:38] grieved they didn't grieve you to listen
[1:28:40] rock and roll I remember my daddy used
[1:28:43] to get after me and and sometimes you
[1:28:47] know I just grit my teeth and he'd heat
[1:28:49] Whitney or not you know and then there
[1:28:52] was times my daddy talk to me just break
[1:28:54] my heart I can't remember what it was I
[1:28:57] remember one time he was talking to me
[1:28:58] and I felt so bad I said I thought
[1:29:02] within myself I'll never do that again
[1:29:05] month later and there I was doing it
[1:29:08] see but now of something on the inside
[1:29:12] of the inside if that changes if the
[1:29:17] center desire of you're trying being if
[1:29:21] that desire changes you it motivates
[1:29:24] your whole life and it transforms you
[1:29:29] and it brings out the Christian life a
[1:29:32] little by little little by little and
[1:29:35] what is the life of Christ as I was
[1:29:38] studying on that you know to be like
[1:29:40] Jesus and of course the Pentecostals
[1:29:42] they're thinking about all the
[1:29:44] Magnificent things he did raise them to
[1:29:46] it and healing the lepers and all the
[1:29:47] astounding things because that's the
[1:29:49] aspect of the life of Christ that was
[1:29:51] manifested in them and the and the
[1:29:54] Baptist they look at the faith the faith
[1:29:57] of Abraham and the faith that's the new
[1:30:00] birth that's it
[1:30:01] but each one looks at a aspect of the
[1:30:04] life of Christ but to me when I really
[1:30:07] looked down into the heart of Christ
[1:30:10] what was it that that made him what it
[1:30:13] was is that I come to do not my will but
[1:30:18] my father's will and when he came his
[1:30:23] humility powers and humility
[1:30:26] what is the bride coming to she's coming
[1:30:29] to true humility I'm talking about
[1:30:32] divine humility I'm not talking about
[1:30:33] human humility and what is divine
[1:30:37] humility for Christ that started in
[1:30:41] heaven before he ever came substance and
[1:30:45] it said that that he thought it not
[1:30:48] robbery to be equal with God now I've
[1:30:52] heard people say what that means that it
[1:30:54] was like when when God taken the spirit
[1:30:57] off of Moses and put it on the seven he
[1:30:59] said now he didn't have any less and
[1:31:00] there wasn't any less spirit when he put
[1:31:02] it on seventy but actually what that
[1:31:05] actually means is that he didn't feel
[1:31:09] that it was something to be grasped a
[1:31:11] hold of or to hang to or retain he was
[1:31:15] willing to release all what he was in
[1:31:18] heaven all the glory that he had
[1:31:21] and he emptied himself and he taken on
[1:31:27] the form of a servant not a king not a
[1:31:30] Patra Pope but he taken on the form of a
[1:31:35] rejected man came to zone and he was
[1:31:38] rejected and it said until the day that
[1:31:43] he came to the to the humility even to
[1:31:46] the death of the Cross so what was the
[1:31:50] death of the cross
[1:31:51] not my will but thy will
[1:31:55] so as the bride comes to that third pool
[1:32:00] she'll have to come to humility and what
[1:32:04] is humility when you surrender yourself
[1:32:07] oil for his will to have the preeminence
[1:32:12] in your life I'm not talking about
[1:32:17] legalistically I'm talking about in
[1:32:19] desire that we can say I've come to do
[1:32:22] my father's will not my will you'll
[1:32:26] always have a will because we're always
[1:32:28] going to be human but when we come to
[1:32:31] that total surrender of humility and I
[1:32:36] believe the only way that you can come
[1:32:37] to humility is to come to truth security
[1:32:41] to know where you come from and if I
[1:32:45] know where I come from I know where I'm
[1:32:47] going
[1:32:48] he never told those Pharisees you're
[1:32:51] going to hell I'll tell you where you're
[1:32:52] going you're going to hell now he says I
[1:32:55] know where you came from and because I
[1:32:57] know where you come from you're going
[1:32:59] back where you come from and there's
[1:33:02] been a place repaired for for that one
[1:33:04] that you come from and for you if we
[1:33:07] know where we come from that was the
[1:33:10] difference between Saul and David Saul
[1:33:13] was chosen by God he was called out of a
[1:33:16] little tribe he was humble old why I
[1:33:18] don't deserve this and right but there
[1:33:20] was something down in Saul that he was
[1:33:25] never changed in the inner man but he
[1:33:28] was rolled with with God's outward
[1:33:31] glory as the Pentecostals they had power
[1:33:34] without character and so then when he
[1:33:37] when he taken that throne after a while
[1:33:41] it was my throne my church I've been
[1:33:46] born again I've got my own Holy Ghost I
[1:33:50] can go to church when I feel like and I
[1:33:52] can do what I want - this is my life God
[1:33:55] as men me and Jesus we're gonna do this
[1:33:58] thing but you don't just don't match his
[1:34:01] Bible you know in my Bible when they got
[1:34:04] the Holy Ghost I found them in church
[1:34:06] they assembled themselves they went from
[1:34:08] house to house breaking bread and
[1:34:10] somebody stood up and one didn't preach
[1:34:11] to them now to get the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:14] they go to church when they feel like it
[1:34:15] and sometimes they just don't feel like
[1:34:17] it they got other things to do and Paul
[1:34:19] said as we see that day as we see that
[1:34:23] day from the heart I'm not talking about
[1:34:26] blood moons and all this I'm taught but
[1:34:29] as a heart looks and sees the day you
[1:34:34] begin to gather yourself the more off
[1:34:37] because now there's an urgency because
[1:34:42] we need revelation not a new thought not
[1:34:46] find some ministry over here across the
[1:34:48] sea that we got to go to and sit under
[1:34:50] what we need to do is sit at the feet of
[1:34:53] Jesus Christ and obedience not my will
[1:34:58] die will so we find it that people are
[1:35:02] trying to come to great things of what
[1:35:04] they think a third pole is it's kind of
[1:35:07] like a ministry brother around said the
[1:35:08] man says he can do it and thinks he can
[1:35:10] do it he can't do it but the man thinks
[1:35:13] that he can't do it he'll do it but then
[1:35:15] there he said there's an extreme if you
[1:35:17] just don't think anything of yourself
[1:35:18] and you can't do anything you sit down
[1:35:20] Waller and self-pity and never amount to
[1:35:21] nothing but to know I can't do anything
[1:35:24] without him but I am his child and he's
[1:35:28] called me and the more the more
[1:35:34] the more anchored you become the more
[1:35:36] security become the more peaceful you
[1:35:40] become the more quiet you become not
[1:35:45] always challenging and trying to prove
[1:35:47] but trying to help trying to take care
[1:35:50] of trying to feed trying to bring the
[1:35:54] lost and anybody don't here let them
[1:35:56] come that's what we're coming to and and
[1:36:01] you have to make that choice in your
[1:36:03] life and it has to be a free moral
[1:36:07] agency driven by the very love of God
[1:36:10] that sent us through the revelation of
[1:36:12] this hour now tonight I just speak a
[1:36:16] little bit on prophecy and I was looking
[1:36:21] I was looking on my phone today and and
[1:36:25] there was a there was an article on in
[1:36:29] the USA Today and it was it was talking
[1:36:32] about the Pope and I read this I read
[1:36:35] this part of it and it says because of
[1:36:38] what's on my mind of prophecy
[1:36:43] and it says that that prophecy what he
[1:36:45] says he says in verse 19 we have also a
[1:36:50] more sure word of prophecy whereunto you
[1:36:55] do well that you take heed as unto a
[1:37:00] light that shine it in a dark place so
[1:37:02] that's what I'm looking at tonight
[1:37:05] prophecy revealed he's like a light
[1:37:10] that's shining into a dark place we say
[1:37:12] modern events made clear by prophecy why
[1:37:15] because it's shining upon the events
[1:37:19] that's in the world and being
[1:37:21] interpreted it shows us what's taking
[1:37:24] place so we prepared for a for a young a
[1:37:31] power failure appearance will we always
[1:37:33] carry a flashlight up here and we we put
[1:37:36] it right here and and we're instructed
[1:37:39] if anything happens then the lights go
[1:37:40] out take the flashlight and turn it on
[1:37:42] so everybody can see how to get out of
[1:37:45] here so sure enough we're up here
[1:37:48] preaching the light and hit the
[1:37:49] transformer goes out normal acts I'd say
[1:37:51] all right church now everybody sit not
[1:37:54] it's not it's not be stampeding and
[1:37:56] everything now I'm fixing to turn this
[1:37:58] flashlight on but the batteries there's
[1:38:01] this thing been sitting up here for a
[1:38:03] couple years and we may not have much
[1:38:05] light so you do well to take heed that
[1:38:09] when I turn this light on look around
[1:38:12] see what the door is because this light
[1:38:16] is going to shine into a dark place but
[1:38:18] it's going to bring an illumination
[1:38:21] whereby you can see how to get out so
[1:38:23] you do all to take heed as unto a light
[1:38:26] that shines into darkness so that's what
[1:38:29] prophecy revealed is so I was reading
[1:38:34] this today and it says and it says for a
[1:38:38] century this is this is out of us us a
[1:38:42] news today
[1:38:44] for a century it was the paranoid
[1:38:48] political fantasy prophet Protestant
[1:38:52] fundamentalists and know nothing
[1:38:56] nativists the of Babylon
[1:39:00] they call him the Pope citing the book
[1:39:04] of Revelation would use catholic'
[1:39:08] immigrants to bend Washington to his the
[1:39:13] Pope's will and I thought man that's a
[1:39:16] mouthful
[1:39:17] he says paranoid political fantasy and I
[1:39:24] looked up that word paranoid account of
[1:39:26] what it meant but it means baseless or
[1:39:29] excessive suspicion of the motives of
[1:39:32] others and psychiatry means a mental
[1:39:36] disorder characterized by systemized
[1:39:40] delusions and the projection of personal
[1:39:44] conflicts which are ascribed to supposed
[1:39:48] hostility in other words are imagining
[1:39:50] always being attacked in these imaginary
[1:39:52] enemies and and I thought my goodness I
[1:39:58] said this man is calling these people
[1:40:01] that are quoting the scripture and
[1:40:04] calling the Pope and the Catholic Church
[1:40:07] the great of the book of
[1:40:10] Revelation and he says these people
[1:40:15] paranoid political fantasy and you look
[1:40:21] up that word fantasy and it means
[1:40:23] hallucination so he's saying these
[1:40:25] people that interpret this Bible which
[1:40:29] he probably don't think nothing about
[1:40:30] the Bible start with whoever's right in
[1:40:32] this article he said they're having
[1:40:35] hallucinations and they're saying this
[1:40:37] man is the great horror of the book of
[1:40:39] Revelation these paranoid stupid idiotic
[1:40:44] heretics that's what you are in this
[1:40:47] man's sight because that's what we
[1:40:49] believe and I thought my goodness and
[1:40:58] and I and I thought well you know that
[1:41:01] kind of reminds me a little bit that I
[1:41:03] was listening to a ministers but
[1:41:05] probably 20 30 years ago and he was in
[1:41:08] the in the deity doctrine and so he was
[1:41:12] getting ready to preach the congregation
[1:41:13] so first thing you want to do is disarm
[1:41:17] everybody so he says you know brother
[1:41:20] Branham dealt with the deity doctrine
[1:41:22] and and no spirits he said when when
[1:41:24] that mamba snake come out of that water
[1:41:26] and he shot it he said that took care of
[1:41:28] it and so what was he trying to do just
[1:41:30] trying to disarm everybody and get
[1:41:32] everybody relaxed because he was fixing
[1:41:34] to bring his deity doctrine so he is
[1:41:36] trying to prove to everybody that spirit
[1:41:38] doesn't exist anymore remember that
[1:41:42] snake didn't die it only went back in
[1:41:43] the water it's still here today so
[1:41:47] that's what Satan is trying to do
[1:41:49] through the news he's trying to disarm
[1:41:52] the people by what by by disillusioning
[1:41:59] them that prophecy is not prophecy that
[1:42:03] the Bible is not the Bible
[1:42:08] and that's that's why he's working so
[1:42:12] prophecy is like a light that shine us
[1:42:17] into a dark place and then I want to go
[1:42:21] to the book of Matthew and chapter 6
[1:42:26] verse 21 and what does it say Matthew 6
[1:42:34] verse 21 for where your treasure is
[1:42:37] there will your heart be also so this
[1:42:42] has to do he said once your little
[1:42:45] spirit it can't rock and rolling all
[1:42:46] these things so there has to be a change
[1:42:49] a new birth of nature and now your
[1:42:53] treasures you know what treasures is
[1:42:54] that's the things that has the
[1:42:56] preeminence in your life when that man
[1:42:59] found that jewel of great value he went
[1:43:03] home he sold all that he had he sold all
[1:43:06] his treasures a lot of things that had
[1:43:09] the preeminence in his life it found
[1:43:11] something that was greater now that had
[1:43:13] this paramus that he was willing to sell
[1:43:16] everything to buy the field and to find
[1:43:19] this treasure
[1:43:22] so he says wherever your treasure is
[1:43:26] that's where your hearts going to be and
[1:43:31] then he goes on to say the light of the
[1:43:35] body is the eye if therefore thine eye
[1:43:40] be single thy whole body shall be full
[1:43:43] of light but if I be evil thy whole body
[1:43:47] shall be full of darkness if therefore
[1:43:50] the light that is in thee be darkness
[1:43:55] that's kind of a paradox if the light
[1:43:59] that's in you be darkness how can light
[1:44:03] be darkness but that's what it says if
[1:44:07] the light that's in you if your eyes
[1:44:12] evil now in my Bible that says if your
[1:44:15] eyes single it's talking about healthy
[1:44:17] it's not talking about just one or just
[1:44:20] looking at one God if I heard it
[1:44:22] interpreted that way but when in my
[1:44:24] Bible says if your eye be healthy then
[1:44:29] your whole body is going to be full of
[1:44:30] light in other words you're going to be
[1:44:33] able to see everything around you it
[1:44:36] brings light to the body so if my heart
[1:44:40] if I'm born again then there's going to
[1:44:42] be light in my body but if I'm not born
[1:44:46] again then the revelation or the light
[1:44:48] that I have denominational ideas and
[1:44:50] traditions of man will only be darkness
[1:44:55] right so the light of the body the eye
[1:44:59] the body is light so the last anointing
[1:45:03] or the last dispensation of the four
[1:45:05] beasts was the eagle it was the
[1:45:09] prophetically age the a of the age of
[1:45:12] the eye because the Prophet was always
[1:45:15] the eye the voice of God and the last
[1:45:20] age was a not a sitting eagle but a
[1:45:23] flying eagle so we are now in the age
[1:45:26] it's a prophetic age and so you do well
[1:45:31] to take heed as unto a light that shines
[1:45:33] into darkness
[1:45:35] so this is going to be the age of light
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:39] doctrine doesn't necessarily bring light
[1:45:43] but prophecy revealed not not prophecy
[1:45:48] talked but prophecy made flesh and talk
[1:45:53] to you what you're looking at is
[1:45:56] prophecy made flesh that's light and
[1:46:00] it's the light of the body what's the
[1:46:02] first thing they went after in Samson
[1:46:05] they took at his eyes who did it
[1:46:08] Delilah who that the world had
[1:46:14] revelation he had eyesight but what
[1:46:16] little it he had because he sold out he
[1:46:19] gave his heart to a woman and he gave
[1:46:22] his strength to God God don't need your
[1:46:25] strength he don't need your education he
[1:46:28] need he don't need your ability to be
[1:46:30] able to speak your charisma he doesn't
[1:46:33] need anything that you got while all
[1:46:35] he's finding is somebody that will
[1:46:38] surrender his self will and self choices
[1:46:42] to him that he might have a preeminence
[1:46:48] so they what they do they put the eye
[1:46:51] out and he couldn't see but prophecy
[1:46:56] revealed brings light so now what Satan
[1:47:04] trying to do trying to put out the eye
[1:47:08] you don't care about doctrine doctrine
[1:47:13] you know doctrine tells us how to walk
[1:47:16] but it can teach his original sin
[1:47:19] there's a lot of things in doctrine and
[1:47:21] doctrine is part of the gospel but saint
[1:47:25] is not worried about doctrine that's
[1:47:28] what brother Brennan even said he said
[1:47:29] I'd rather have the right spirit than
[1:47:31] the right doctrine you can have all your
[1:47:33] doctrine right the wrong spirit Paul's I
[1:47:35] know all the mysteries and not charity
[1:47:38] but prophecy prophecy revealed or
[1:47:42] prophecy vindicated it brings light as a
[1:47:47] John what's going on who are you
[1:47:50] what's this ministry what's it all about
[1:47:53] what'd he do he appealed a prophecy he
[1:47:56] wanted to bring light on his ministry
[1:47:59] the purpose of his ministry he said I am
[1:48:02] the voice crying in the wilderness what
[1:48:05] was that the light was coming down it
[1:48:09] was revealing what is ministry who he
[1:48:12] was in prophecy made flesh and
[1:48:16] vindicated
[1:48:21] prophecy I was studying in the in the in
[1:48:29] the and the Reformation let me read the
[1:48:31] scripture here so I can just kind of
[1:48:34] establish the scriptures I was going to
[1:48:36] go to Zach right but I'm not going to do
[1:48:37] it save time
[1:48:39] Zechariah 14:16 7:00 in the evening I'm
[1:48:42] at Shelby light Isaiah 60 darkness gross
[1:48:45] dark darkness over the earth gross
[1:48:47] darkness on the people horizons shine
[1:48:50] thy light has come so we're talking
[1:48:53] about light and we're talking about
[1:48:56] prophecy the Holy Ghost doesn't bring
[1:49:00] light but it said at the entrance of thy
[1:49:04] word it brings light now what word are
[1:49:07] we talking about the Living Word
[1:49:11] especially in this age is prophecy being
[1:49:16] fulfilled so over here and if you look
[1:49:21] at psalms 43
[1:49:27] and look what David what he's appealing
[1:49:31] to and verse 2 for thou art God
[1:49:37] this is Psalms 43 and verse 2 for thou
[1:49:39] art God
[1:49:41] for thou art the god of my strength now
[1:49:45] in Psalms 42 and verse 8 he says god of
[1:49:50] my life so he kind of appeals not to
[1:49:55] different titles but what he's looking
[1:49:57] at
[1:49:57] oh god you're my life you're everything
[1:50:01] to me Paul said for me to live as Christ
[1:50:04] but now known this in chapter 43 of
[1:50:06] Psalms it says God in my strength my
[1:50:10] strength my power my virtue why does
[1:50:16] thou cast me off why do I go mourning
[1:50:20] because of the oppression of my enemy
[1:50:23] and if you if you read Psalms 43 you'll
[1:50:26] find out he said I went to church I went
[1:50:28] to the tabernacle I went to the temple
[1:50:30] and I went with all the believers and we
[1:50:33] worshiped we sang we offered up our
[1:50:37] praises and Thanksgiving he said but now
[1:50:40] when I walked away they were all
[1:50:42] rejoicing but why are there tears in my
[1:50:44] eyes
[1:50:45] why was the tears in David's eyes
[1:50:47] because he had known the presence of God
[1:50:50] and that's what David wanted to be in
[1:50:53] not the temple not in the presence of
[1:50:56] the priests and the believers and
[1:50:57] offering up sacrifices but it was God's
[1:51:00] presence that David longed for instead
[1:51:03] of him because when he was a young man
[1:51:05] he had an experience back there in the
[1:51:08] backside of the desert nobody was out
[1:51:11] there but just heaven from sheep and God
[1:51:14] delivered he felt the presence of know
[1:51:16] the reality of a Living God that's why
[1:51:20] he could go down there to Goliath why
[1:51:23] did he go down there to reveal unveil
[1:51:26] god to the people he said all in Israel
[1:51:29] and all the nations knew that there's a
[1:51:32] Living God
[1:51:33] now I believe they knew there was a
[1:51:35] living God soul consulted the prophets
[1:51:39] he consulted the tabernacle of Moses but
[1:51:43] it was empty he consulted the word but
[1:51:46] there was one thing that he never had an
[1:51:48] experience with and that was the ark he
[1:51:53] never had an experience with the
[1:51:54] presence of God as David did so when it
[1:51:59] came down to Goliath the latest in
[1:52:01] church age he he he had brought the
[1:52:04] people to follow man instead of gone he
[1:52:08] taught them about God but now he had
[1:52:11] been come a holy man
[1:52:13] and so when he looked out and he saw
[1:52:15] glides he looked out and he looked he
[1:52:17] said hey no way I can take him and the
[1:52:21] people they look and I said well he
[1:52:23] can't take him we can't take him but
[1:52:25] David wasn't looking at man he'd been in
[1:52:28] the presence of God and he didn't go out
[1:52:30] there to challenge anybody it was in
[1:52:33] humility our David had been jointed King
[1:52:37] he was king over his brothers he was
[1:52:40] king over his daddy he had been anointed
[1:52:42] in their presence
[1:52:44] with all God poured out through a
[1:52:47] prophet and anointed him King and he
[1:52:50] sent him right back out there taking
[1:52:52] care of the sheep you know what his next
[1:52:54] next job was busboy that's what we call
[1:52:57] people in the in the hotel he said David
[1:53:01] come here yes dad what do you want here
[1:53:03] take this lunch to your brothers your
[1:53:05] mama's fixed it always is their favorite
[1:53:06] cookies and their favorite sandwich and
[1:53:08] and and and find out how they're doing
[1:53:11] and giving her a report nothing about
[1:53:12] David David said well how do you think I
[1:53:15] am you know I'm gonna be king over
[1:53:18] Israel you treat me like this
[1:53:22] no he's okay daddy I'll do that
[1:53:25] didn't you Millard see God was placed
[1:53:28] them in the right place at the right
[1:53:30] time
[1:53:31] to do what he wanted him to do not what
[1:53:34] he wanted to do he was doing something
[1:53:36] he might not have particularly cared to
[1:53:38] do carry lunch to his brothers and he
[1:53:40] couldn't even go to war all right David
[1:53:43] how's my uniform look it looks alright
[1:53:46] see you later day
[1:53:47] don't forget take care of sheep you know
[1:53:50] they were going off the war he couldn't
[1:53:51] go he wanted to but he couldn't too
[1:53:54] young he got out there and he heard that
[1:53:57] Philistine he looked at the army he
[1:53:59] looked I said what is going on here why
[1:54:03] are you letting this uncircumcised
[1:54:05] philistine cursing the armies of God and
[1:54:08] the God that we serve he said all that
[1:54:11] Israel would know that we are in the
[1:54:14] presence of God he's a present help in
[1:54:16] the time of trouble he wasn't talking
[1:54:18] about theology he wasn't of my Bible
[1:54:21] history he was talking about the God
[1:54:24] presence it was right there and he went
[1:54:28] down to unveil God to the people and
[1:54:34] when they got back to church after that
[1:54:35] day I mean it was an inspiration to the
[1:54:38] whole army when they saw what David did
[1:54:41] under the power of God they went down in
[1:54:43] slate Philistines all day long they got
[1:54:46] rid of their TVs the women got rid of
[1:54:49] their pants quit cutting her hair men
[1:54:52] start dressing right getting a decent
[1:54:53] haircut you know they they kill those
[1:54:57] giant those from people all day long all
[1:54:59] those idols and when he got back to the
[1:55:02] church what David here he didn't hear
[1:55:06] what a mighty God we serve
[1:55:07] no said Saul has slayed a thousand and
[1:55:12] David ten thousand Oh Paul was a great
[1:55:18] man but brother branham had a greater
[1:55:20] ministry than what Paul had
[1:55:24] whoa what happened to Christ who was
[1:55:28] doing the work Paul or brother branham
[1:55:31] whose ministry was it Paul or brother
[1:55:34] branham when we begin to compare man
[1:55:37] with man whose ministry excels what
[1:55:39] ministry we've already left Christ out
[1:55:43] but they should have been saying what a
[1:55:45] mighty God we serve
[1:55:46] but God was never unveiled to them they
[1:55:50] only moved from one camp to another many
[1:55:54] people are coming to this message and
[1:55:55] never come out of denominations just
[1:55:59] because you change camps doesn't mean
[1:56:00] that you come out it's when God's been
[1:56:05] revealed to you now when I was looking
[1:56:09] at the Reformation I was reading in a
[1:56:14] book that I had bought it's a some
[1:56:16] lectures that was given in 1886 and I
[1:56:20] think it was called Romanism and
[1:56:23] Protestantism in the light of prophecy
[1:56:28] and what this man was showing I think it
[1:56:31] was in 1517 that Luther he goes out and
[1:56:37] he nails the 95 theses on the door and
[1:56:41] that's what we marked the Reformation
[1:56:44] but he said really it didn't start there
[1:56:47] to him because when he nailed that 95
[1:56:51] theses on there it'd be no different I
[1:56:53] sent an email to him to brother lush and
[1:56:55] I said now brother lush I kind of look
[1:56:58] at these thunders a little bit different
[1:56:59] you do and here are some points that I'd
[1:57:03] like to make and and and your revelation
[1:57:07] of a serpent seed death I see that kind
[1:57:09] of different thing I'd like to debate
[1:57:11] these points with you now I'm not coming
[1:57:15] against his authority and I'm not
[1:57:17] challenging him as a minister nor is the
[1:57:21] Son of God I'm just saying I'd like to
[1:57:23] debate these issues with you and see if
[1:57:25] we can reconcile it with the word that's
[1:57:28] all apart that's all that Luther was
[1:57:30] doing he wanted to he wanted to discuss
[1:57:33] these 95 points that he had that looked
[1:57:37] like the Catholic doctrine was off and
[1:57:40] he'd been reading his Bible and now he
[1:57:42] had 95 what they call the 95 theses he
[1:57:45] was calling them to a ministerial me and
[1:57:52] so they brought him the worms and he not
[1:57:56] only had two ninety-five theses but now
[1:57:57] he had printed some pamphlets off of
[1:57:59] these revelations that he had had and
[1:58:02] they said we want you to repent he said
[1:58:06] I cannot I'm not subject to Pope's or
[1:58:10] councils but my soul is prison by the
[1:58:16] Word of God captivated if you can prove
[1:58:20] to me or show to me by the Word of God
[1:58:22] that I am guilty I'll repent and he
[1:58:27] would not repent so then the Pope he put
[1:58:29] out on what they call a a papal bull
[1:58:31] like a wanted poster guess what they
[1:58:35] used to do in the Old West but the Pope
[1:58:36] he put out a papal bull it was a
[1:58:39] excommunication and his life was open
[1:58:42] anybody wanted to kill him and so he
[1:58:48] went he got back he went to Wittenberg
[1:58:50] and he got that papal bull and then he
[1:58:54] got all the doctrine it uh they had a a
[1:58:57] word for that but it had to do with the
[1:59:02] letters that the Pope had sent out that
[1:59:03] became doctrine in the church it took
[1:59:05] all those letters he took that papal
[1:59:08] bull and he went into the middle he went
[1:59:11] into the middle of Wittenberg and there
[1:59:13] was a big bonfire and he threw those
[1:59:17] things in the fire that was when he came
[1:59:20] against the power and authority of the
[1:59:23] Pope and a holy roman catholic church
[1:59:26] that was when the Reformation truly set
[1:59:29] in now what gave him the power what gave
[1:59:35] him the strength to withstand the Pope
[1:59:38] and the authority of the Pope I found
[1:59:42] that that all the Reformers hust
[1:59:47] wiggly Calvin
[1:59:51] Tynan Dale like lifts all of these great
[1:59:55] reformers you know they had one common
[1:59:58] revelation that tied them all together
[2:00:00] now we know we had the Armenians we had
[2:00:03] two Calvinists and we had this and we
[2:00:05] had that but there was one there was one
[2:00:07] typos there was one scarlet thread that
[2:00:10] tied them together and that was the Book
[2:00:14] of Daniel and second Thessalonians and
[2:00:16] the book of John revelation that the
[2:00:21] Pope was the Anti Christ and the church
[2:00:23] was the great and when that light
[2:00:27] shined in the Luther's heart he was not
[2:00:30] intimidated he was not afraid he knew it
[2:00:33] wasn't the Holy Ghost he knew wasn't
[2:00:35] God's church he knows the Antichrist
[2:00:38] that's what gave him the bonus because
[2:00:41] the light shined in darkness and as I
[2:00:47] began to study further it wasn't just a
[2:00:49] new revelation but then you study about
[2:00:52] the wall deniz and the different there
[2:00:54] was three different peoples that was
[2:00:56] they were they were what we'd call the
[2:00:58] true church because Paul went to Rome
[2:01:01] and they had the letters of Paul in Rome
[2:01:04] and these walled in these had what they
[2:01:07] called to receive text they had the
[2:01:08] letters of these apostles and they knew
[2:01:12] that the Catholic Church was nothing but
[2:01:15] the Antichrist and the great and
[2:01:17] that came down into the Reformation and
[2:01:19] that became the strength of the
[2:01:23] Reformation David said old God of my
[2:01:30] strength
[2:01:31] send my light and I cruise what for
[2:01:37] then it might lead me tonight
[2:01:39] Tabernacles in other words send thy
[2:01:42] light and truth that I might find you
[2:01:46] your presence so in prophecy is revealed
[2:01:52] it brings us to the presence of God send
[2:01:58] thy light and thy truth let them lead me
[2:02:02] let them bring me not lead me only but
[2:02:06] bring me unto thy holy hill but Mount
[2:02:12] Moriah Mount Zion and to the right
[2:02:16] Tabernacles then will I go unto the
[2:02:21] altar of God unto God my excellent my
[2:02:25] exceeding joy yet upon a heart I will
[2:02:28] praise thee O God my god what that woman
[2:02:33] at the well say she said he said give me
[2:02:37] a drink
[2:02:38] I've even got nothing to draw he said
[2:02:40] well if you'd asked me I gave you a
[2:02:43] drink that you'd never thirst again
[2:02:46] now son was taking place in the natural
[2:02:50] and then there was a great Symphony that
[2:02:53] was going on and in this other dimension
[2:02:58] God was inspiring this young lady
[2:03:01] because when he said I'll give you a
[2:03:03] drink that you never thirst again
[2:03:05] inspiration struck and she said I don't
[2:03:11] like to have a drink she knew that was
[2:03:12] the answer she knew it was this fountain
[2:03:14] of life that Israel in forsaken she'd
[2:03:18] been to the churches she'd been to the
[2:03:19] denominations they taught her exactly
[2:03:22] right from the Bible they said he's
[2:03:24] coming he's coming this prophet that
[2:03:27] Moses spoke of we believe that he's it's
[2:03:30] just time for the rapture time for the
[2:03:32] coming of the Messiah we know it's close
[2:03:34] at hand by the signs around us
[2:03:38] she said when it and when he comes he'd
[2:03:40] be a prophet he be God and flesh she
[2:03:46] said I perceive you're a prophet
[2:03:50] where'd that come from do you think that
[2:03:53] comes from a natural understanding from
[2:03:56] her Bible catechisms by the ones that
[2:03:59] taught her that they rejected him
[2:04:01] they called him Beelzebub her Sunday
[2:04:03] School teachers her pastors and all I
[2:04:08] turn that seat was crying what was it
[2:04:10] crying for there was a voice in that
[2:04:12] seed crying for the presence and the
[2:04:14] reality of God the churches couldn't
[2:04:17] bring it to her so her spirit said what
[2:04:20] you really need is a husband you find
[2:04:21] comfort you find peace and it was a
[2:04:24] shipwreck got put away another one
[2:04:30] another one another one he says I don't
[2:04:35] want to drink says go get your husband
[2:04:38] she said she said well I don't have one
[2:04:41] because she was just shacked up that's
[2:04:43] what they call it state so I don't are
[2:04:44] used to know what the call now I think
[2:04:47] it's alternative lifestyle or something
[2:04:49] get on
[2:04:52] single-parent and things like that you
[2:04:54] know they've manipulated circumstances
[2:04:58] through words trying to dress it up they
[2:05:00] don't call it sodomy anymore they just
[2:05:03] call it you know alternative lifestyles
[2:05:07] dress it up a little bit but sin is
[2:05:09] still sin she said when I ain't got one
[2:05:13] he said well it's a good thing you said
[2:05:15] that because you've had five and the one
[2:05:17] that you with now ain't yours she said
[2:05:22] now the spirit was quickening the word
[2:05:26] that was in her he said the Holy Spirit
[2:05:30] will bring to you the remembrance of
[2:05:32] things that I've spoken to you but now
[2:05:35] these things that was talked to her that
[2:05:37] she's looking for now are becoming a
[2:05:39] reality through inspiration she's
[2:05:41] looking at the same man those Pharisees
[2:05:43] looked at she's looking at the same one
[2:05:45] pilot looked at Herod looked at the high
[2:05:48] priest looked at same man no halos no
[2:05:52] great miracles signs and wonders and he
[2:05:55] said I thank you Father you hid it from
[2:05:56] the eyes of the wise and prudent they
[2:05:58] couldn't have seen it because there was
[2:06:00] a veil over their hearts and their minds
[2:06:03] was blinded but he inspired her she said
[2:06:08] I perceive you're a prophet as soon as
[2:06:11] she found out he was a prophet we're
[2:06:13] talking about a representation of God on
[2:06:16] earth the voice of God wife anybody knew
[2:06:19] where he was this prophet would not work
[2:06:21] his Hoss
[2:06:22] so she said we worship up here and you
[2:06:27] worship down there but what church
[2:06:30] should I go to where can I find him his
[2:06:32] presence not just a better Church not
[2:06:35] just a different kind of worship
[2:06:37] she was walk behind them because
[2:06:39] something down in here was calling he
[2:06:42] said well he said no you worship up
[2:06:44] there you don't know what you worship
[2:06:46] because they were in idolatry to begin
[2:06:48] with and their King didn't have any
[2:06:51] royal blood because he was a he was the
[2:06:53] son of a servant of Solomon so he didn't
[2:06:56] have no royal blood even though that God
[2:06:57] gave him ten tribes
[2:07:00] and he didn't have no royal blood and he
[2:07:02] called a clergy together and they
[2:07:04] weren't God called even though he did
[2:07:07] his best he got the low ones and he
[2:07:08] didn't get the real smart and high
[2:07:10] educational he got he got the low ones
[2:07:12] build up a couple churches for him to go
[2:07:16] to and golden calves he didn't want to
[2:07:19] go back and get converted he just wanted
[2:07:20] to stay him under his power and security
[2:07:22] even though that he knew that God gave
[2:07:25] those ten tribes he was insecure then
[2:07:30] God called you the pastor to church it's
[2:07:32] not your church as his search then he
[2:07:35] said as many as hear your voice I tell
[2:07:37] you you're sent to and if they leave and
[2:07:40] go to another church I don't make them
[2:07:42] Antichrist he don't let any live out
[2:07:44] from among the Saint I was that's in
[2:07:48] security trying to control people
[2:07:50] through fear and intimidation what we
[2:07:53] need to do is get them filled with the
[2:07:55] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost to take
[2:07:57] care of Holy Ghost are bringing the
[2:08:01] church not programs no not all kinds of
[2:08:05] picnics and great speakers you know this
[2:08:11] church fill up you bring certain
[2:08:13] celebrities here and it's not because of
[2:08:15] them it's what the people's made on them
[2:08:17] bring a certain ministry here had packed
[2:08:19] the town out with believers but it's a
[2:08:23] Holy Ghost when he comes and he comes
[2:08:27] through the he comes from people that
[2:08:29] they want to be champions and he comes
[2:08:32] through there Lily comes for anybody
[2:08:33] that will render themselves to him and
[2:08:36] he come to feed his people you know what
[2:08:40] the manna was sent for it was sent to
[2:08:43] teach them humility the man who was sent
[2:08:48] to teach them you my own teaching
[2:08:50] humility
[2:08:53] because they couldn't go out there and
[2:08:54] store it up Samantha had to come every
[2:08:58] day the Living bread what is the man
[2:09:02] it's the embodiment of nutrition of
[2:09:06] everything the human body needs every
[2:09:09] vitamin every mineral everything that
[2:09:13] you need for health your immune system I
[2:09:16] don't care what it is it was in the
[2:09:18] embodiment of that manner and he brought
[2:09:23] the water the water in the manna but now
[2:09:28] he said you go out every day and you get
[2:09:32] a little bit for that day
[2:09:33] but you know the ones that were insecure
[2:09:36] they didn't believe the message of Moses
[2:09:38] and they didn't believe that there was a
[2:09:39] God it was something they didn't really
[2:09:41] know about but now you know sometimes
[2:09:44] man gets ahold of spiritual things
[2:09:45] anything she knows everything is what I
[2:09:49] know what we do I know what Moses said
[2:09:52] but you know what we're gonna do we're
[2:09:54] gonna save up for a little bit tomorrow
[2:09:56] just in case nice and so far we'll give
[2:09:59] them everything but we'll hold back just
[2:10:01] a little bit just in case a rainy day
[2:10:02] and this thing falls through and
[2:10:04] security when they gathered up that
[2:10:08] extra turns the worms and Moses said all
[2:10:12] you always you know he do unbelievers
[2:10:14] you know you don't believe the word
[2:10:16] don't believe God and he teaches us to
[2:10:20] live by his word every day you know the
[2:10:23] revelation you got five years ago ain't
[2:10:26] gonna work for today that's why when the
[2:10:29] saints come together we assemble
[2:10:30] ourselves to see if God's going to bring
[2:10:32] something to us if we're in the faith if
[2:10:35] we come expecting to get some mana
[2:10:37] that's the way he chose to feed you
[2:10:39] without him we can do nothing
[2:10:41] we cannot sucess without him neither can
[2:10:45] creation everything was created by him
[2:10:48] and for him and what it consists it
[2:10:52] stays active because of him he holds it
[2:10:54] up
[2:10:57] he didn't just create it and turn it
[2:10:59] Lucy it's a spirits assist by him they
[2:11:06] said okay we got that revelation all
[2:11:09] right here Saturday in our Friday I
[2:11:12] guess have been in the Old Testament
[2:11:13] that's ago I know wasn't it he said now
[2:11:18] I want you to get enough for them all oh
[2:11:22] it says pastor I wish he'd make up his
[2:11:24] mind
[2:11:25] first he says don't save it nice just
[2:11:27] save it says don't make no idols now he
[2:11:29] tells us to make two cherubs always
[2:11:32] trying to figure God out trying to get
[2:11:34] God in a box or some kind of a schedule
[2:11:36] I don't know whether we ought to save it
[2:11:42] tomorrow or not you're supposed to
[2:11:44] listen to the voice the manna was to
[2:11:49] teach some humility what is humility not
[2:11:52] my will I will to depend upon him every
[2:11:55] day so we find now that that down
[2:12:00] through those dark ages down through the
[2:12:02] Reformation that the strength was
[2:12:05] prophecy revealed and what do we see the
[2:12:08] Antichrist doing well these paranoid
[2:12:12] heretics idiotic people that believes
[2:12:19] this Pope is the great that's
[2:12:23] exactly what he is what happened to the
[2:12:29] Lutheran Church the I prophecy was put
[2:12:34] out and here about ten years ago in the
[2:12:37] paper it said all but about two to
[2:12:39] ninety-five theses all of those points
[2:12:42] had already been resolved they've just
[2:12:44] on the last two because once it prophecy
[2:12:48] once the light is put out once it Isaac
[2:12:52] he couldn't see had to go by his
[2:12:54] feelings as smell is hearing
[2:12:59] sounded like Esau smelt like he saw felt
[2:13:03] like he saw but he didn't have the
[2:13:06] discernment his eyes have become dim and
[2:13:11] he couldn't tell the difference between
[2:13:12] the two spirits between the two sons and
[2:13:17] we're to have the wisdom in the last
[2:13:19] days to be able to discern between the
[2:13:22] two spirits he said from his mouth
[2:13:25] cometh knowledge and understanding but
[2:13:29] God giveth wisdom so we can have
[2:13:33] knowledge and understanding but without
[2:13:34] wisdom it won't do us any good
[2:13:37] and that comes from God not man but it
[2:13:40] comes for knowledge and understanding
[2:13:44] look at acts 15 for a moment we just
[2:13:47] look at that a minute and then we're
[2:13:49] just kind of closed acts 15 here's what
[2:13:54] I really wanted to preach on but it just
[2:13:56] I love David I love Paul but I just seen
[2:14:02] something just about David seems like
[2:14:05] kind of attracts me but anyway here in
[2:14:07] acts 15 now this is approximately
[2:14:12] according to one Bible this is 50 ad so
[2:14:15] 33 AD was Pentecost about that time so
[2:14:20] now 33 AD and 50 ad we're talking about
[2:14:25] 17 years give or take 17 years so now
[2:14:31] we're in a dispensational change because
[2:14:36] it changed from the first covenant or
[2:14:38] the Old Covenant to the second Covenant
[2:14:41] to the New Covenant according to
[2:14:43] Jeremiah 31:31 233 and God says I'm
[2:14:48] going to give you a new covenant it's
[2:14:51] not going to be like the old when I
[2:14:53] brought you up out of Egypt and I gave
[2:14:55] you the Ten Commandments I gave you my
[2:14:57] my my word written in stone and then and
[2:15:01] then it was turned over to you and the
[2:15:04] first covenant it all hinged and
[2:15:07] depended upon your ability to perform
[2:15:11] and even if your performance was perfect
[2:15:13] he still couldn't come in the presence
[2:15:15] of God so even though that you were
[2:15:19] perfect and blameless in the law it
[2:15:21] never brought the righteousness to bring
[2:15:23] you in the presence of God all it did
[2:15:26] was let you know that she was a sinner
[2:15:28] and you needed Redemption and then next
[2:15:32] year every sacrifice you all offered was
[2:15:36] a reminder and pointed you to your sin
[2:15:40] but he said I'm going to give you a new
[2:15:42] covenant and in this covenant I'm gonna
[2:15:45] do something different I'm not gonna
[2:15:47] write it on tables of stone I'm gonna
[2:15:50] write it in your heart and it's not
[2:15:54] going to be based upon your ability to
[2:15:56] perform but it's going to be based upon
[2:15:58] faith in my ability to perform it's not
[2:16:03] what you're going to do it's what I'm
[2:16:05] gonna do and your faith is going to be
[2:16:07] in what I do and I'm going to write it
[2:16:11] in your heart in other words I'm gonna
[2:16:12] put a nature in there that doesn't make
[2:16:15] you a law keeper but it makes a law
[2:16:18] FULFILLER
[2:16:21] why did coordinators why did he get
[2:16:23] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:16:25] well because so he could be a believer
[2:16:27] in going rapture no he didn't he already
[2:16:31] had the Holy Ghost he was sealed unto
[2:16:33] the day of his Redemption
[2:16:36] that's what the scripture said Peter
[2:16:38] said they receive the Holy Ghost just
[2:16:39] like we did so he was born again he was
[2:16:42] sanctified he was justified sanctified
[2:16:45] and born again and sealed unto the day
[2:16:47] of his Redemption in other words if he
[2:16:51] had said well Peter I know what you're
[2:16:53] talking about but I got the Holy Ghost
[2:16:55] and I'm sealed and I'm going in the
[2:16:57] rapture and I'm going to heaven I don't
[2:16:58] need to get baptized he could have said
[2:17:01] that and he still would have gone to
[2:17:02] heaven but there was a nature change and
[2:17:08] when they as you know
[2:17:11] we have to have the more harmony
[2:17:21] another
[2:17:25] and I'll show you
[2:17:34] it said he commanded them be baptized in
[2:17:38] the name of Jesus Christ and the spirit
[2:17:41] that was in him responded to that voice
[2:17:43] he didn't care it was a demand a command
[2:17:45] or what it was he didn't have to have an
[2:17:48] altar call he didn't have to have a
[2:17:50] whole bunch of tears and patting and
[2:17:51] priming he was obedient to the word
[2:17:54] because the life and him was obedient to
[2:17:57] that Living Word so now here we are 50
[2:18:08] 80 and there's an infectious-disease
[2:18:12] coming into the church because these men
[2:18:16] have come down from headquarters they
[2:18:18] come from Judea you know who their
[2:18:21] pastors was John Peter James they said
[2:18:29] you know who we sent around a campfire
[2:18:32] with we heard it straight from their
[2:18:33] lips Peter you know who we walked with
[2:18:39] you know what church we belong to James
[2:18:42] you know who you know Jesus a brother we
[2:18:48] sat in his church this is where this
[2:18:50] revelation comes from I had letters of
[2:18:52] certification they said I hear this
[2:18:57] church was when the church was scattered
[2:19:00] out abroad and in rem acts 8 there were
[2:19:04] some believers that went up there and it
[2:19:06] said wherever the church went they
[2:19:07] preach the word they were the first
[2:19:09] missionaries and then Philip and the
[2:19:13] Apostles never left Jerusalem so when it
[2:19:16] ends up you tell me who's going to be
[2:19:18] the last missionaries it'll be the
[2:19:20] church it's not going to be the ministry
[2:19:24] because when she comes to perfection
[2:19:26] the ministry is no more because the
[2:19:29] ministry is until and then we will reach
[2:19:32] that point of maturity and security and
[2:19:37] to that place of perfection the ministry
[2:19:41] isn't needed anymore
[2:19:42] the Lord brought us to Christ
[2:19:45] the ministry brings us to perfection and
[2:19:48] unity but when that comes there is no
[2:19:51] more ministry because that's the purpose
[2:19:54] and some people don't want to lose her
[2:19:55] job so they hold back a few secrets to
[2:19:59] keep you from coming to perfection in
[2:20:02] fact I saw a few seeds that you'll war
[2:20:05] and bitterness and Indians that you need
[2:20:07] them that's what the Catholic Church
[2:20:10] said unless you get communion through
[2:20:12] our priests you cannot go to heaven so
[2:20:15] they made them dependent on the church
[2:20:17] and some people are trying to make you
[2:20:18] dependent on his church a building a
[2:20:21] pastor without him we can't do anything
[2:20:25] without him if we gather tonight and the
[2:20:29] Holy Ghost is not here we're just a
[2:20:31] bunch of religious sinners gathered
[2:20:32] together but he is the church in the
[2:20:37] body makes the church by one spirit were
[2:20:40] baptized into one body that's the church
[2:20:44] now there's an infectious disease coming
[2:20:49] the roots of legalism trying to come in
[2:20:52] and and marry up with with grace like a
[2:20:57] woman with a living husband trying to
[2:20:58] marry a man you know it won't work her
[2:21:03] man married out here two three times
[2:21:05] trying to get another wife trying to
[2:21:08] blend the two together but the first
[2:21:10] time has to be dead the law was dead the
[2:21:14] end of the law for righteousness ended
[2:21:17] it Christ it was not what they thought
[2:21:22] it was how they saw it what they thought
[2:21:26] was righteousness but how they thought
[2:21:29] it through the law was wrong and they
[2:21:32] because they sought it by their own
[2:21:34] revelation they rejected the plan of God
[2:21:37] now this disease was coming into the
[2:21:39] church
[2:21:44] and so we find Peter stands up and he
[2:21:46] gives his testimony man I had the keys
[2:21:49] to the kingdom
[2:21:50] he talked about a position nobody could
[2:21:55] get saved no Gentile could get save
[2:21:56] until he opened that door
[2:21:58] Peter Paul himself if he would have
[2:22:02] preached and laid hands on him and
[2:22:04] baptized him he too got the same results
[2:22:07] Philip did they could have got justified
[2:22:10] and sanctified but the Holy Ghost could
[2:22:13] not come until Peter opened that door he
[2:22:20] opened the door to the Jews and there in
[2:22:23] Samaria Philip went down preached
[2:22:25] brought him out out of witchcraft they
[2:22:28] believe the gospel repented baptized in
[2:22:31] the name of Jesus Christ they had the
[2:22:33] mechanics but where was the dynamics it
[2:22:35] didn't come so fast no speak in tongues
[2:22:39] I know what I'll do I'll go to church 10
[2:22:41] times to the five time all he can do is
[2:22:44] wait on him
[2:22:45] we're waiting on him for the rapture and
[2:22:50] then Peter they didn't know what to do
[2:22:52] Peter didn't go down so you need me it
[2:22:54] was a circumstances God according to
[2:22:56] this great symphony brought Peter down
[2:22:58] he laid hands on him and they received
[2:23:01] the Holy Ghost and the dynamic struck
[2:23:03] the mechanics and then he goes over to
[2:23:07] the Cornelius's house and he opens up
[2:23:10] the door he said you know who's got the
[2:23:13] keys of the blood you know that's what
[2:23:15] the Catholic Church says the Pope got
[2:23:17] the keys the blood he says you know you
[2:23:23] know who ate fish with him but we find
[2:23:26] that he didn't appeal his own personal
[2:23:29] relationship with Christ but he appealed
[2:23:32] to the revelation that he had that was
[2:23:34] vindicated a vision given to a prophet
[2:23:39] thus saith the Lord and it was fulfilled
[2:23:42] exactly manifested and here comes a word
[2:23:46] prophet Paul because said well that's
[2:23:51] alright Peter you know you had a good a
[2:23:53] good experience
[2:23:56] but after the resurrection you know who
[2:23:59] Jesus came to you know who the fifth
[2:24:03] pillar fire came and called out and said
[2:24:06] you're special to me Paul you're a
[2:24:10] chosen vessel and I'm gonna use you to
[2:24:13] be a light you know he could have
[2:24:15] appealed to all that Dwight man does you
[2:24:17] know his great achievements and
[2:24:18] relationships but he didn't he went
[2:24:22] right straight he said we preach the
[2:24:24] gospel to the Gentiles and they were
[2:24:27] baptized with the Holy Ghost and born
[2:24:29] again and not one of them was
[2:24:30] circumcised because it's a circumcision
[2:24:32] in the heart not the flesh and that was
[2:24:36] fine but you know they sat there and
[2:24:39] they thought you know it was pretty good
[2:24:41] message that was a pretty good message
[2:24:42] but they were waiting for something
[2:24:46] garden in psalms 107 he says he said his
[2:24:52] word to heal him and to save them from
[2:24:56] that affections disease or destruction
[2:25:00] he also says in Malachi 4 he said those
[2:25:05] that fear my name and the name of God is
[2:25:09] the manifestation of his word as many as
[2:25:13] receive him who's him Jesus know the
[2:25:18] pillar fire made flesh in Jesus now it's
[2:25:22] the pillar of fire today made flesh in
[2:25:23] his word it's still Jesus the Living
[2:25:26] Word he's living today as many as
[2:25:30] received him what the Living Word made
[2:25:34] manifest what's Peter say Peter said he
[2:25:39] is that rock he's a rock of offense that
[2:25:42] people stumble that even the word of God
[2:25:45] so that rock that that David wrote about
[2:25:49] a stumbling stone then you've seen it it
[2:25:53] came down down out of the out of the
[2:25:56] heavens at a mountain or a rock cut with
[2:25:58] our hands and it came and it stood with
[2:26:01] two legs then jesus said have you not
[2:26:04] heard that
[2:26:07] raaah that was rejected of the great
[2:26:09] builders they knew that he was speaking
[2:26:13] of them they thought we're gonna kill
[2:26:14] this guy he was that rock
[2:26:17] he was a living Word made flesh and
[2:26:21] Peter says you are living stones what
[2:26:24] living word part of that stone which is
[2:26:28] a stumbling stone what is it it's a
[2:26:30] prophetic word made flesh they come down
[2:26:38] to the end and everybody was sitting
[2:26:41] there and all of a sudden inspiration
[2:26:46] struck James and he stood up and he says
[2:26:50] now we've heard what Peter says and he
[2:26:54] don't refer to Paul he just says we know
[2:26:56] what Peter said he says and just agrees
[2:27:01] the prophets in other words soul agrees
[2:27:03] the Word of God prophets in other words
[2:27:06] lighted come to James and modern days
[2:27:11] hence was to be interpreted illuminated
[2:27:15] by prophecy fulfilled so says the
[2:27:18] scriptures that I will build again the
[2:27:23] tabernacle of David and it referred to
[2:27:28] the circumcision after he quotes the
[2:27:32] prophecy then it says now the question
[2:27:36] is settled they'll not be circumcised
[2:27:39] prophecy revealed broad illumination
[2:27:44] onto the events of that day that they
[2:27:46] could understand what was taking place
[2:27:48] and Jesus said on this rock I will build
[2:27:55] my church in other words the same voice
[2:27:58] that spoke in Amos 9 that said I will
[2:28:01] build again the tabernacle of David that
[2:28:04] is the bride the body of Christ is the
[2:28:07] tabernacle of David it's not in the
[2:28:10] Millennium it's now you know what what
[2:28:20] Joseph did was a shadow of things that
[2:28:23] was to come sold out by his brothers
[2:28:27] rejected is he a spiritual went into
[2:28:30] prison one site one died right hand of
[2:28:33] Pharaoh right so what was what was
[2:28:36] happening to the Joseph was a shadow of
[2:28:39] something that was to come and David you
[2:28:43] know it's strange but when Israel came
[2:28:48] in the time of Joshua and they they took
[2:28:51] the land and after he he he died and
[2:28:54] they finished taking their land you know
[2:28:56] there was one place that they couldn't
[2:28:57] captain captivate they couldn't conquer
[2:28:59] there was a Jeb you sight Citadel or as
[2:29:02] Jebusite fortress on Mount Zion that was
[2:29:08] one place that they could not conquer
[2:29:10] and David when he came to this Rome and
[2:29:15] when he came to the throne of the 12
[2:29:17] tribes you know the first thing he did
[2:29:20] he went up there and broke the seals he
[2:29:25] went up there and took that Citadel and
[2:29:28] David built it and it was called a city
[2:29:30] of zone zone nobody could do that but
[2:29:34] David he was part of his ministry and he
[2:29:39] he conquered that mount sound and you
[2:29:42] know what the first thing he did he said
[2:29:45] I want God in the midst of the church
[2:29:47] ain't good enough for me to be pastor
[2:29:49] but I want the presence of the Holy
[2:29:51] Ghost here I want his throne in the
[2:29:54] midst of Israel
[2:29:56] yeah now I will build again the
[2:29:59] tabernacle of David you know what it was
[2:30:01] it was a tent it was just a tent like
[2:30:07] he'd go pitch a tent to camp it wasn't
[2:30:09] he didn't go out and some special array
[2:30:11] or anything he pitched a tent just a
[2:30:14] tent now remember here that tent it
[2:30:18] wasn't it wasn't a temple of Solomon and
[2:30:20] it wasn't a tabernacle of Moses it was a
[2:30:23] tent and God didn't tell him to do it
[2:30:26] and God didn't give him a blueprint for
[2:30:29] it why was it the tabernacle of David
[2:30:33] and not not the temple of Solomon that
[2:30:35] he was going to build again why wasn't
[2:30:37] the tabernacle of Moses Moses represent
[2:30:39] a law but here it was just a tent that
[2:30:46] tent was you that's it was me it was
[2:30:49] Paul it was Peter those martyrs that
[2:30:52] died down through the church age he said
[2:30:53] I'll build again but why did David build
[2:30:57] it why was it David Moses built it by
[2:31:00] instructions Solomon built it because of
[2:31:03] his daddy wanted to build it and it was
[2:31:05] given to him to build it but why did
[2:31:07] David did it because it came out of the
[2:31:10] love out of his heart that he wanted he
[2:31:13] wanted Christ he wanted he wanted God in
[2:31:15] the midst of the people he was the true
[2:31:18] king he wanted he wanted God in the
[2:31:21] midst that's why God wanted that go he
[2:31:26] looked down he said one day I'm going to
[2:31:29] build that tent
[2:31:31] you and I are that tent we're the body
[2:31:34] of Christ and in that body we make up
[2:31:37] the temple of worship and David went he
[2:31:42] tried to bring the Ark and remember he
[2:31:45] didn't do it according to the word and
[2:31:48] God's not gonna let you do anything
[2:31:49] that's not according to the word
[2:31:52] didn't get baptized and Father Son and
[2:31:54] Holy Ghost all today you want to but
[2:31:56] you're gonna have to come his way you
[2:31:57] ain't coming he said a voice he's done a
[2:32:01] prophet to prepare your hearts he didn't
[2:32:03] send the theologians in the church he
[2:32:07] himself came and spoke through that
[2:32:08] mouthpiece so David he went back praying
[2:32:13] he said I see what it is according to
[2:32:17] the word it has to be carried over the
[2:32:19] hearts of the Levites they can't be a
[2:32:21] tradition like the old denominations
[2:32:23] like the Philistines it worked in that
[2:32:26] day but it won't work today they brought
[2:32:29] it brought the ark back into the land
[2:32:31] but now I've got to bring him to zone so
[2:32:34] he took those he took those priests him
[2:32:38] he got all sanctified and he got that
[2:32:41] ark and they put it over their shoulder
[2:32:43] I don't know her heart you know the ones
[2:32:45] on the right it was on the left ones on
[2:32:47] the left it was on the left because it
[2:32:49] had to be over the heart he wasn't
[2:32:51] symmetrical the window ones on the
[2:32:54] outside ones on the outside but it was
[2:32:55] outside in time I'd be over the heart
[2:32:58] may not look good may not look logical
[2:33:01] that's the way God wanted it and he said
[2:33:04] they took about six or seven steps and
[2:33:06] you want to happen instead of stumbling
[2:33:08] it said that God strengthened them all
[2:33:12] when you get in that word you care we're
[2:33:14] supposed to be not with muscle but over
[2:33:17] the heart in love many of strengthen you
[2:33:22] virtue and it said he went to fetch the
[2:33:27] ark to bring it to his place the ark his
[2:33:35] now we're not French we're not Spanish
[2:33:37] there was no gender it wasn't just
[2:33:41] because he was a table him or a chair
[2:33:43] her it was the ark him he went to bring
[2:33:46] him and the ark represented the presence
[2:33:50] of God and the Living Word of God he
[2:33:53] went to bring him to his place where was
[2:33:56] his place he was in that tent
[2:34:00] because when he built the tent the tent
[2:34:02] was calling for the ark because David
[2:34:05] pitched that tent for the purpose of the
[2:34:07] ark coming and that tent was crying for
[2:34:10] the ark so when he went to get the ark
[2:34:12] he went to bring it to his place when
[2:34:17] you build a house you know you take
[2:34:20] abandoned houses and they they just
[2:34:22] deteriorate and fall down
[2:34:24] seems like three times faster than a
[2:34:26] house with a family living in it
[2:34:27] what because a house calls for a life
[2:34:30] and the family is the life of that house
[2:34:33] there something about a family that
[2:34:35] lives in a house that it will spend
[2:34:38] it'll decay after a while but you take
[2:34:40] an abandoned house and without any life
[2:34:42] in it it just falls down and that tent
[2:34:46] were calling for the ark because David
[2:34:49] in his heart had built it for the ark he
[2:34:54] said that's the church that I want
[2:34:56] that's the tent that I'm gonna make and
[2:35:02] then David this is kind of strange
[2:35:06] David's dressed underneath hug you know
[2:35:10] what that is that's a priests garment
[2:35:12] white linen you know it's white linen
[2:35:16] that the high priest puts on on the Day
[2:35:18] of Atonement you know what the white
[2:35:21] linen represents he takes off it they
[2:35:23] call it his robes of glory he takes off
[2:35:25] the high priest he takes off his robes
[2:35:27] of glory he's already offered up the
[2:35:30] daily morning sacrifice because he does
[2:35:32] all the sacrifices that day so he offers
[2:35:36] up the sacrifices and the things but now
[2:35:38] he's getting ready to offer up the
[2:35:40] sacrifices of the day of atonement you
[2:35:43] know what he has to do he takes off his
[2:35:45] robes of glory he takes about five or
[2:35:47] six and a seven
[2:35:50] and then he puts on this white linen you
[2:35:53] know what the white linen that he took
[2:35:55] off his robes of glory and he came down
[2:35:58] and clothed himself in humanity and here
[2:36:01] comes David dressed in an ephod white
[2:36:04] linen you know what he is he's in a
[2:36:06] priests robe now David was never a
[2:36:08] priest but brother Branham refers that
[2:36:10] when he opened up the Garner's the
[2:36:13] priest Garner's that he had access and
[2:36:15] God didn't rebuke him from bringing that
[2:36:16] that weed out for the people he was
[2:36:19] actually taking the place of a priest
[2:36:21] when he opened that up David was never a
[2:36:24] priest but now he's dressed in a nice
[2:36:27] Cod and he's bringing the the Ark the
[2:36:32] word to his place and so he comes up and
[2:36:36] when they bring the ark to the tent
[2:36:39] David offers up burnt sacrifice you know
[2:36:43] when when Saul did that God rejected him
[2:36:46] and he lost his whole kingdom he lost
[2:36:48] its room David offers it up he offered
[2:36:53] up burnt offerings David did and God
[2:36:57] accepted that and there was no more
[2:37:00] sacrifices one sacrifice once and for
[2:37:04] all for eternal Redemption and there was
[2:37:08] no holiest of holies in there and he
[2:37:11] placed the ark in there and offered that
[2:37:13] burnt sacrifices and then you know what
[2:37:15] he did he gave meat and wine and bread
[2:37:22] to the people at that moment in time and
[2:37:26] only David can do this because David was
[2:37:29] of the tribe of Judah and wordid milk
[2:37:33] has dick come from he sprung out of the
[2:37:35] tribe of Judah of which Moses never
[2:37:39] spoke of any priesthood at that moment
[2:37:43] of time when the word was coming to his
[2:37:46] place David stood and foreshadowed
[2:37:50] Melchizedek that one day
[2:37:53] a mighty angel was going to stand with
[2:37:59] that word the message of the bride and
[2:38:03] he was going to give it to John to eat
[2:38:06] and the fullness of the word was coming
[2:38:09] to his place in her heart or in the day
[2:38:18] when the word the fullness of the word
[2:38:20] is coming to his place and she becomes
[2:38:25] him and the manifested sons of God but
[2:38:29] you know what Satan does want to do
[2:38:31] why is he gonna put the squeeze why is
[2:38:34] he gonna try to take the bride out
[2:38:36] because the light of the body is the eye
[2:38:39] and where's the eye it's you to rebuke
[2:38:45] that man it says why you're nothing but
[2:38:47] a bunch of paranoid fanatics then that's
[2:38:53] the word of God he's the Antichrist and
[2:38:57] you'll find out one day America
[2:39:02] bow down to her but the bride won't
[2:39:06] because the light of prophecy and if the
[2:39:10] eye be healthy if it's anointed with
[2:39:14] their eyes have of the Holy Spirit then
[2:39:18] the eyes the light of the body this is
[2:39:22] the Eagle Age under the Eagle anointing
[2:39:26] now I tell you the word is coming to his
[2:39:29] place because she in him for one
[2:39:35] it potentially been that way in that day
[2:39:39] now down through the church ages he said
[2:39:42] and I'm gonna close
[2:39:44] he said Philip have you been so long
[2:39:49] with me that you don't know who I am why
[2:39:54] if you would have known me if your
[2:39:58] revelation that as I heal Lazarus and as
[2:40:01] I raise the dead and the leper and and
[2:40:05] they say if if when you walked with me
[2:40:08] if your revelation would have progressed
[2:40:11] you were to come to the point that you
[2:40:14] would have known who I was if you'd have
[2:40:17] known who I was you'd have known who he
[2:40:20] was he said have you been so long that
[2:40:24] you don't know who I am until when
[2:40:26] you've seen me you've seen him so down
[2:40:30] through the church ages they were living
[2:40:32] off the revelation of the true
[2:40:35] revelation of the Godhead but
[2:40:38] something's different to come he said
[2:40:42] John 14 20 in that day you'll know I'm
[2:40:47] in him and him and me that's the Godhead
[2:40:49] and I am you and you and me oh wait a
[2:40:52] minute now but they had that revelation
[2:40:55] under the new birth but it was to come
[2:40:57] to a completion in this day inspiration
[2:41:00] he said that prophecy spoke of this day
[2:41:04] in that day you know that I'm him and
[2:41:09] him and me oh but I am you and you and
[2:41:13] me when she looks in the mirror and
[2:41:16] recognizes who she is
[2:41:18] she'll know as he is known
[2:41:22] yeah you don't have to worry about
[2:41:27] insecurity you don't have to worry about
[2:41:29] control we're almost we're one step into
[2:41:37] eternity look at look at everything
[2:41:41] that's taking place but I'm looking for
[2:41:43] the inspiration to strike revelation yet
[2:41:46] that walks away the voice of the
[2:41:48] ministry not all but what's the general
[2:41:50] pull I ain't looking for Pope's ain't
[2:41:57] looking for years well those things are
[2:41:58] fine but I'm looking for that revelation
[2:42:01] the inspiration to come because the
[2:42:04] rapture is a revelation it's the
[2:42:06] inspiration on that revelation we're not
[2:42:10] looking for a new ministry and a new
[2:42:12] idea a new thought everything we have
[2:42:14] need of us in you now it's in this
[2:42:16] message but God controls that by a key
[2:42:20] it won't be based on your conduct but
[2:42:24] it'll be based on his sovereign will at
[2:42:27] the time that you have need of it
[2:42:29] he will inspire you for the faith to
[2:42:31] stand in the moment that you're standing
[2:42:33] he will grant us the inspiration to say
[2:42:37] death just leave me alone
[2:42:41] people have tried to manufacture that
[2:42:43] and they're dead today but one day that
[2:42:46] revelation will come out of you and you
[2:42:49] know that you won't go by way of the
[2:42:50] grave but don't try to manufacture it
[2:42:54] don't work it up wait for the dynamics
[2:42:57] to strike the mechanics and if living
[2:43:00] day by day is racing by inspiration and
[2:43:06] you ain't going to come up at the last
[2:43:07] day and get it
[2:43:10] it took me 73 years to get where I'm
[2:43:13] happy I never thought I'd get here now I
[2:43:18] just wonder if I was ever back there I
[2:43:20] got a look at pictures yep yeah yeah I
[2:43:27] was old my brother-in-law's
[2:43:30] my wife went over there and they were
[2:43:32] showing videos and and family photos
[2:43:35] back when we was out in the world there
[2:43:39] I was him a lot of hair and white
[2:43:43] beautiful dark hair and there we was
[2:43:45] running around she was in her shorts my
[2:43:47] sister-in-law was in her shorts we his
[2:43:49] hunting Easter eggs and always having a
[2:43:50] good time we like we watched two hours
[2:43:53] of slides and videos and then we was
[2:43:59] through as I was going to go to the
[2:44:00] bathroom and they got one of these
[2:44:02] bathrooms it's just a what do you call
[2:44:04] it a 1/2 bath I guess it had a sink and
[2:44:08] it has a the toilet term and so I went
[2:44:11] in there and when you walk into it the
[2:44:13] sink is over here and it's got a mirror
[2:44:15] in the toilets over here so I went over
[2:44:17] here I went to the bathroom and I turned
[2:44:19] around I start washing my hands
[2:44:21] and I looked up and I saw this old man
[2:44:24] looking at man
[2:44:26] yes Charlie I've been looking at myself
[2:44:29] so long then when I looked in the mirror
[2:44:31] looked like an old man looking through a
[2:44:33] window at me I came out of the bath and
[2:44:35] just laugh and they said what do you
[2:44:37] like laughter I just scared myself for
[2:44:42] that moment I forgot who I was it was so
[2:44:48] funny because inside it just you know
[2:44:50] how sometimes something else carry on
[2:44:52] inside you go but on the outside you
[2:44:54] just like this Nathan oh you sure are
[2:44:56] calm but on the inside you knew you
[2:44:58] jumped about three feet you know and I
[2:45:00] just inside I just jump when I did I
[2:45:03] knew it was Lena I just started laughing
[2:45:04] this old man look at that man I never
[2:45:09] knew I'd be looking into that old man
[2:45:10] Here I am but one day looking at young
[2:45:15] man and it won't be the man that I
[2:45:19] looked at back there it'll be a
[2:45:22] glorified behind you well be the same
[2:45:24] eyes same features all you talk about
[2:45:29] realities brothers and sisters we need
[2:45:31] paranoid fanatics Wayne paranoid
[2:45:36] heretics we ain't even secure people
[2:45:38] trying to use Jesus as a crutch
[2:45:41] something's changed you talk about
[2:45:46] miracles just you've been in church and
[2:45:50] believed in this message this message
[2:45:52] will rip the hide off you it doesn't
[2:45:55] show favoritism
[2:45:58] it doesn't spare nothing cuz you're
[2:46:01] right down to the heart to the root call
[2:46:03] sin sin and you need to repent for
[2:46:08] perish
[2:46:10] here's not two ways there's one way
[2:46:12] Christ it's not another gospel none
[2:46:15] another Bible but the ark he's come to
[2:46:20] his place he's been out here no place to
[2:46:23] lay his head he's been in the land but
[2:46:26] he wasn't in his place but now that lamb
[2:46:31] stepped forth with a book everything
[2:46:34] that's me redeems in that book
[2:46:37] Israel's in that book birth is in that
[2:46:41] book here in that book foolish virgins
[2:46:45] in that book he says revelation five he
[2:46:47] says everything that's to be redeemed is
[2:46:50] in that book but now here comes another
[2:46:53] mighty angel Christ and he's got in his
[2:46:56] hand not the book he's got a little book
[2:47:00] because in that book of life there was a
[2:47:03] section called
[2:47:04] the Lamb's Book of Life the very elect
[2:47:09] that book was written before the
[2:47:12] foundation of the world and he was on
[2:47:14] that book the earth Israel has an
[2:47:18] unconditional covenant through Abraham
[2:47:20] if your name was on that book you tell
[2:47:23] me who's got an unconditional covenant
[2:47:25] he was saying before you got here he was
[2:47:28] sealed on a holy oath before you got
[2:47:30] here the Bible said we have received an
[2:47:33] inheritance being predestinated then if
[2:47:37] I have a heritance and the kingdom of
[2:47:39] God is because I was written
[2:47:41] predestinated how did you get the Holy
[2:47:44] Ghost it says the Holy Ghost is the
[2:47:46] first fruits the earnest of my
[2:47:49] inheritance how'd you get your
[2:47:51] inheritance predestinated how'd you get
[2:47:54] the Holy Ghost predestination
[2:47:57] [Applause]
[2:47:59] Laurie because that seed was crying for
[2:48:04] life and God answered the voice of that
[2:48:07] seat oh what a day we're living in why
[2:48:13] is he attacking the cloud prophecy it's
[2:48:19] not attacking doctrine the cloud why the
[2:48:23] cloud believe the sign they pointed
[2:48:28] everybody to to the cloud and the
[2:48:30] supernatural what about the word once
[2:48:36] they put that I of the Lutheran Church
[2:48:38] out doctrine didn't make no difference
[2:48:42] why why is it that the churches are
[2:48:45] sitting on the platform of that Pope
[2:48:47] because the eye has been put out and if
[2:48:51] your eye be sick and unhealthy and you
[2:48:54] need the eye salve to go on it the light
[2:48:57] that's in you is darkness the light
[2:48:59] that's leading the churches is darkness
[2:49:01] ignorance void of God but the bride the
[2:49:06] I what the after is after the eye
[2:49:11] he took Satan's eyesight but one thing
[2:49:15] about it and he was treading out that
[2:49:18] corn he began to realize why he was
[2:49:22] there he said all he said I know where I
[2:49:27] made my first mistake you know what the
[2:49:31] first mistake was he didn't listen to
[2:49:33] her mom and dad he didn't submit himself
[2:49:36] to headship
[2:49:37] he wanted his way I've been down there I
[2:49:41] found this girl I want to marry her Oh
[2:49:43] son she she's a Gentile can't you find
[2:49:47] somebody here in the church I believe I
[2:49:49] want her okay son that's what he made
[2:49:53] his first mistake
[2:49:55] now here he was blind a prisoner to
[2:49:59] those that he was called to conquer
[2:50:02] treading out the corn he had to thinking
[2:50:06] he said that was a mistake one that led
[2:50:09] me to this and it led me to that sin
[2:50:13] will take you farther and you want to go
[2:50:20] sin will keep you longer and you want to
[2:50:26] stay sin will cost you far more and you
[2:50:32] want to pay there he was and he's our
[2:50:37] old God just this once more that these
[2:50:42] Philistines that the church might see
[2:50:44] the power of God and as tell him brother
[2:50:47] bless you come in with his little
[2:50:48] briefcase I said there's a boy with a
[2:50:51] lunchbox that's what you mean boy at the
[2:50:53] lunchbox
[2:50:54] brother Brown said there they was
[2:50:56] leading them my blind church had to
[2:51:01] strengthen him but he was blind he said
[2:51:03] Here Come a little boy with a lunchbox
[2:51:06] had that man with him what that boy
[2:51:09] represent his eyesight revelation
[2:51:14] your largest scent the turn the hearts
[2:51:16] back and he led him to those two pillars
[2:51:19] and they destroyed that church just a
[2:51:22] little boy with a little lunch box
[2:51:23] there's a little boy with a couple fish
[2:51:26] five loaves of bread God can do much a
[2:51:31] little man does a little as much but if
[2:51:37] we could just lead ourselves to him all
[2:51:41] through him were more than conquerors as
[2:51:47] a child I foolish lady turn God away I
[2:51:53] turned him away three times in my life
[2:51:55] as a sinner I knew there was three times
[2:51:57] I look back that he drew close to me and
[2:51:59] each time I turn him back one time was
[2:52:02] when my daddy died and I had gone to
[2:52:06] church I was over Vietnam and I don't
[2:52:07] even know why I went to church and and
[2:52:12] then a week later after I'd went to
[2:52:14] church I told his friend of mine we're
[2:52:15] getting drinkers and stuff and I said
[2:52:17] let's go to church he said do what I
[2:52:19] said let's go to church he said you
[2:52:21] gotta be crazy come on let's go I wished
[2:52:23] I knew what that meant preached week
[2:52:26] later I got a message from the Red Cross
[2:52:28] your daddy's dying you got to go home I
[2:52:30] got home I got Oakland California called
[2:52:33] my mom she living in New Mexico that's
[2:52:36] where I was raised I said mama how's
[2:52:38] daddy doing

[2:52:41] said to what he's dead she said you
[2:52:45] don't commit suicide shot himself in the
[2:52:47] head with a gun I hung up the phone I
[2:52:51] said I'll never serve a god like that
[2:52:56] because you know the legalist what he
[2:52:58] does I do that if you do this and if you
[2:53:01] don't do after I've done for you I mean
[2:53:03] I've gone to church I quit my drinking
[2:53:05] quit my smoking ayudarnos and you won't
[2:53:07] even do this for me
[2:53:08] well I won't serve you because that's
[2:53:10] what illegal is is it's a deal you pat
[2:53:13] me on the back I'll pat you on the back
[2:53:15] but he made me out a liar because here I
[2:53:20] stand serving him and I said I'll never
[2:53:23] serve a God like that so has a child I
[2:53:26] foolish they turn God away not knowing
[2:53:32] the heartache the sinner must pay but
[2:53:38] God in His mercy let me return and there
[2:53:45] with his children his lesson I learned
[2:53:53] sin will take you farther then you want
[2:53:59] to go sin will cost you far more and you
[2:54:06] want to pay so with pleasures and
[2:54:12] promises send to control leaving me
[2:54:19] dying with nothing to show there with
[2:54:26] David standing between two graves a
[2:54:29] little baby and a man that loved him a
[2:54:34] warrior man that he committed adultery
[2:54:37] with his own wife and he put him out in
[2:54:42] the battle and had him killed to hide
[2:54:43] his own sin he tried to manipulate the
[2:54:48] word to hide his sin but the word called
[2:54:51] him out and exposed his sin
[2:54:53] and there he was standing so with
[2:55:01] pleasures and promises send to control
[2:55:08] leaving me die and let nothing to show
[2:55:13] gone were my loved ones and my dearest
[2:55:18] friends only Savior could love me again
[2:55:28] not where is he
[2:55:30] he's right here he's at you and me not
[2:55:36] mercy like a pull with strings of time
[2:55:39] but the mercies of God coming through
[2:55:43] the Word of God through you and me as
[2:55:45] we've got heads Heavenly Father may you
[2:55:49] bless his people for their patience and
[2:55:53] Lord may you strengthen them as David
[2:55:56] said a God of my strength send thy light
[2:56:00] and I truth that it might guide me that
[2:56:04] it might lead me it might take me into
[2:56:08] thy presence tonight Tabernacles fall on
[2:56:11] there I'll worship you in spirit and
[2:56:14] truth send me to the sent send me to the
[2:56:18] loss let me live this life let me give
[2:56:23] them something Lord in this world like
[2:56:27] you gave the woman at the well may we be
[2:56:31] bring her fourths of life of living
[2:56:35] water may you grant that to each one
[2:56:39] father and may you bless them in Jesus
[2:56:41] Christ's name Amen amen brother lusha to
[2:56:45] come amen
[2:56:51] a man named Anthony man thank God for
[2:56:57] the word hey man and I won't keep you
[2:57:03] too long go try not to wear the grey sir
[2:57:07] God
[2:57:08] but he touched on so many things brought
[2:57:15] out so much and when you go home read
[2:57:22] again the scripture that he referred to
[2:57:25] in Matthew chapter 6 for where your
[2:57:31] treasure is there will your heart be
[2:57:35] also so where is your heart be honest
[2:57:40] now with God because he knows where your
[2:57:44] treasure is there will your heart be
[2:57:46] also
[2:57:47] and the light of the body is the eye
[2:57:51] this it really struck I starts
[2:57:54] destructive the light of the body is the
[2:57:58] eye and if therefore thine eye be single
[2:58:01] the whole body should be full of light
[2:58:04] they may walk in the light as he is in
[2:58:09] the light that we might have fellowship
[2:58:11] one with another having the same motives
[2:58:16] the objectives attitude spirit work has
[2:58:20] we got the same anointing so we're all
[2:58:23] reflecting the same person Christ hey
[2:58:28] man they see you they see Christ he see
[2:58:32] me you see Christ they see this brother
[2:58:34] they see Christ his sister they see
[2:58:36] Christ
[2:58:38] you're not all living the same lives you
[2:58:41] all have the same spirit desires that's
[2:58:48] right
[2:58:49] what anointing is on one is on the other
[2:58:54] what and it causes this brother to do
[2:58:57] this this sister to do that they're all
[2:59:00] like oh yes I press with trust by the
[2:59:05] grace of God make your calling and
[2:59:06] election sure make sure you've got the
[2:59:09] the the Holy Ghost anointing in your
[2:59:11] soul that's right
[2:59:13] and it'll produce the same life as the
[2:59:16] other brother or sister who's got the
[2:59:17] old legal anointing in their soul a man
[2:59:21] not again is good not just doctrine as
[2:59:26] he said this judge the devil believes it
[2:59:28] he does when it comes to the doctrine
[2:59:31] and but here you try to get you to go
[2:59:34] around something else go run something
[2:59:35] else here and there brother's sister
[2:59:39] it's the life of Christ
[2:59:43] the bride is going to have the same
[2:59:46] spirit the same anointing and the way
[2:59:49] one acts the other one will act or react
[2:59:52] way one does this or addresses or talks
[2:59:57] they will all have the same the same
[3:00:00] motives objectives anointing from the
[3:00:03] inside of the inside by the grace of God
[3:00:07] yes I thought about it while our brother
[3:00:09] was ministering on it what some things
[3:00:12] he was saying with a prophet of God said
[3:00:14] you can have the anointing he said in
[3:00:15] your flesh and go to hell you can have
[3:00:19] the anointing he said in your human
[3:00:21] spirit and go to hell and that'll cost
[3:00:24] you to do this and do that and do
[3:00:26] something else so you're still going to
[3:00:27] hell but he said where you need it is on
[3:00:30] the inside of the inside in your soul
[3:00:33] where God controls there from the soul
[3:00:38] he said the soul is God's control tower
[3:00:40] he said the head is the devil's control
[3:00:42] tower Amen so let's live from the soul
[3:00:45] by the grace of Almighty God so he said
[3:00:50] he if thine eye be single the whole body
[3:00:52] shall be full of light amen
[3:00:57] we haven't got two objectives we got one
[3:01:02] come back to the work and just walk in
[3:01:05] the light of the word stay in the middle
[3:01:07] of the road by the grace of God and it's
[3:01:10] just but if thine eye be evil thy whole
[3:01:12] body should be full of darkness and
[3:01:14] therefore the light that is in thee be
[3:01:17] darkness amen
[3:01:20] first time I heard that brought out the
[3:01:23] way our brother brought Luke tonight
[3:01:25] praise the Lord
[3:01:26] Oh let's take heed unto the revelation
[3:01:32] there up that the light not become
[3:01:35] darkness hey man if therefore the light
[3:01:39] that is in thee be darkness how great is
[3:01:42] that darkness do it why I'll read it
[3:01:47] quote in just a minute here how great is
[3:01:51] that darkness so close to deceive the
[3:01:56] very elect is impossible
[3:02:01] that's right gonna be ninety ninety nine
[3:02:04] point nine fifty-nine percent light
[3:02:08] maybe 0.1 percent dark butter the eyes
[3:02:13] are caught it's all dark because it's
[3:02:16] gotta be the whole words or nothing not
[3:02:18] all truth nothing but the truth
[3:02:20] hey man man shall not live by bread
[3:02:24] alone but by every word just thinking of
[3:02:27] that read that scripture with Revelation
[3:02:30] what you heard tonight amen
[3:02:35] god forbid that the light is darkness in
[3:02:39] the eyes of God Amen why well we see all
[3:02:45] the doctrines and this and this and this
[3:02:47] and this God looks down and just sees
[3:02:48] that one thing that one word you skipped
[3:02:55] the enemy caused us to skip over a man
[3:03:00] let's not deny one word if therefore the
[3:03:05] light that is in thee be darkness how
[3:03:07] great is that darkness it is great for
[3:03:13] no man can serve two masters that's
[3:03:16] right
[3:03:16] for either he will hate the one and love
[3:03:18] the other or else he will hold to the
[3:03:21] one and despise the other you cannot
[3:03:23] serve God and men hey man the enemy is
[3:03:28] not going to deny the light hey man you
[3:03:33] know what God has done you try to add to
[3:03:37] it take from it but he won't deny it
[3:03:41] god help us amen to understand prophecy
[3:03:48] as our brother was ministering
[3:03:50] pre-eminence giving God the preeminence
[3:03:54] not just in church
[3:03:57] in your home in your education in your
[3:04:00] job it's not what you want what does God
[3:04:02] wants a man just too much today of doing
[3:04:08] what people what they want
[3:04:09] I believe the doctrine so I could do
[3:04:11] what I walked do this do this do this is
[3:04:15] hit the will of God
[3:04:18] again our brother brought it out
[3:04:21] not my will don't be done
[3:04:27] wonderful and again when he was
[3:04:35] preaching on David to come to me a David
[3:04:38] was a man after God's more heart it's
[3:04:44] Jesus
[3:04:45] there's are you as we're after God's own
[3:04:49] heart Jesus knew David was after God's
[3:04:56] own heart are you after God's honor a
[3:05:00] man
[3:05:05] even even oh thank god they're from the
[3:05:09] foundation of the world the lamb was
[3:05:10] slain for our sins if not God would have
[3:05:16] wiped Adam and Eve off the earth and
[3:05:19] started all over again
[3:05:20] but the lamb in the mind of God was
[3:05:24] predestinated and slain before the
[3:05:27] foundation of the world knowing what was
[3:05:29] going to happen even for David hey man
[3:05:34] because the Bible says the law if a man
[3:05:37] do this this he had to be killed God
[3:05:41] didn't kill him
[3:05:42] God corrected him God Chasen to test
[3:05:46] sized him and God pointed all others
[3:05:48] back to David why because he was a man
[3:05:51] after God's own heart on the inside he
[3:05:56] wanted God and God knew that what
[3:06:00] happened was the influence of Satan in
[3:06:01] his flesh it wasn't in his heart god
[3:06:07] help us
[3:06:12] and I'd like again what he brought out
[3:06:14] and reminded us concerning the right
[3:06:16] spirit and wrong doctrine the prophet of
[3:06:18] God said I'd rather fellowship with a
[3:06:21] brother who got a wrong doctrine on the
[3:06:23] right spirit then he said somebody with
[3:06:26] a right doctrine and a wrong spirit a
[3:06:28] man he said least he said if he got a
[3:06:32] right spirit we can change his doctrine
[3:06:35] God can deal with it you know but if
[3:06:39] your spirit is wrong it's nothing we can
[3:06:41] do
[3:06:41] amen the Prophet said he said you got to
[3:06:45] have a right spirit and right doctor and
[3:06:47] now if you get a right spirit and right
[3:06:48] doctrine now you got a cake on the way
[3:06:50] he said hey man grace praise the Lord
[3:07:02] make a comment on I'll skip most of this
[3:07:05] here he referred to David and the 10th
[3:07:11] and breaking the Ark of the Covenant he
[3:07:14] did the taped some years ago I preached
[3:07:18] on the 10th vision and the Ark of the
[3:07:21] Covenant was brought into the tent hey
[3:07:25] man it was the fullness of the revealed
[3:07:29] word by the grace of God hey man
[3:07:33] and where do we where's God find us in
[3:07:37] the tent in the Holy of Holies
[3:07:42] hey man because that's where the Ark of
[3:07:45] the Covenant was that's where the
[3:07:46] revealed word is it's in the holy of
[3:07:48] always he meant God requires more of us
[3:07:51] in the S any other generation man so
[3:08:00] really I know some would disagree I have
[3:08:03] preached it that the Dead vision that's
[3:08:07] the third pole we're in the tent we're
[3:08:13] here in the tent hearing the reveal word
[3:08:15] you heard it tonight what and and eating
[3:08:19] the manna that never goes stale praise
[3:08:22] the name of the Lord Alleluia it just
[3:08:26] goes right on into eternity praise God
[3:08:31] so and he preached he mentioned
[3:08:35] something about the flashlight I don't
[3:08:37] know if you had one there or something
[3:08:39] like one
[3:08:42] well I thought about something that
[3:08:49] happened some years ago in the Empire
[3:08:52] Avenue a man I was wanting to have two
[3:08:57] brothers and sisters with that were
[3:08:59] there would remember but I was preaching
[3:09:02] one night and and the power went out
[3:09:07] it's on a Sunday night I believe it was
[3:09:10] and the power went out and well we had a
[3:09:12] flashlight so we had a large flashlight
[3:09:15] there by the pool bar under the pulpit
[3:09:17] and and so I took it out turned it on
[3:09:20] brother Bob came up took the flashlight
[3:09:23] shined it onto the boo-boo and I kept on
[3:09:26] preaching so I could see my notes and so
[3:09:32] I could read the scriptures so I can
[3:09:33] read the quotes hey man
[3:09:35] so so the flashlight served a purpose
[3:09:38] yeah it's like following birth father it
[3:09:43] was the light on the light Brian he was
[3:09:46] seeking he was speaking of course during
[3:09:47] the flashlight show sort of people who
[3:09:49] quote at the door but by the grace of
[3:09:51] God we were that I was gonna keep on
[3:09:53] preaching so so we thank the Lord for
[3:09:58] that and we did go right on and then our
[3:10:01] brother just I can worst I can remember
[3:10:03] our brother Paul now standing to my on
[3:10:05] my lap there and I like that with with
[3:10:09] the heart and on my left and and he was
[3:10:13] there with holy hope the light like this
[3:10:15] as I kept on for it you kept on
[3:10:18] preaching a man so brother look no
[3:10:21] matter what if you're doing it for God
[3:10:23] the devil is gonna try to stop yet but
[3:10:26] you'll keep on moving because God is
[3:10:28] gonna provide yeah God's gonna provide
[3:10:30] the help you need they may praise the
[3:10:33] name of the Lord a man now
[3:10:37] just let me finish with this man and
[3:10:42] again and encourage you take the time we
[3:10:48] take a lot of redeem that we redeem time
[3:10:50] for a lot of things we redeem time for a
[3:10:54] lot of natural things a lot of carnal
[3:10:57] things how much time do we read DVD for
[3:11:01] God and the things of God how much time
[3:11:05] every redeeming for the body of Christ
[3:11:09] just Wednesday just Sunday
[3:11:13] just a special services like we're
[3:11:15] having redeemed the time the Bible says
[3:11:21] because the days are evil
[3:11:26] I find more and more believers so call a
[3:11:31] redeeming time for natural things carnal
[3:11:33] things I'm a believer I can do this and
[3:11:36] sure you can do it too thing if it is if
[3:11:38] you got the Holy Ghost he takes a way to
[3:11:40] desire for it he wants you to do the
[3:11:42] will of God not your will not my real
[3:11:45] father thine be done
[3:11:47] oh we like to do this we like to go here
[3:11:49] we want to do this we want to do that
[3:11:51] well now yeah well let's find my son
[3:11:54] that's find my daughter but can I use
[3:11:57] you for something else are you serving
[3:12:00] the body are you helping the body will
[3:12:02] somebody pay a price if you go and do
[3:12:05] what you want to do instead of I what I
[3:12:07] want you to do how many are living for
[3:12:11] one another
[3:12:13] Christ lived and died for us how many
[3:12:17] are living and dying for one another
[3:12:20] I'll tell you this world is my guess and
[3:12:23] is worth more real to the - to the
[3:12:26] people than the world to come the
[3:12:28] kingdoms of man are more real than the
[3:12:32] kingdoms of God kingdom of God and as I
[3:12:35] was I would listen to our brother Andre
[3:12:38] was it in central and if fellowshiping
[3:12:41] was some of the brethren there and I
[3:12:42] said listen I said people want to stay
[3:12:45] more than they want to go because I said
[3:12:49] they have they have ideas motives
[3:12:52] objectives what I want to do this I want
[3:12:54] to do this and wonder something else
[3:12:56] laying aside and said Lord willing Paul
[3:13:00] said that he said no matter what your
[3:13:02] plan just say Lord Willie keep your mind
[3:13:06] on the resurrection on the rapture on
[3:13:08] the change the will of God hey man you
[3:13:15] bird the word tonight come back and stay
[3:13:20] with the word
[3:13:25] in 1951 April 1951 now hard to believe
[3:13:35] that this would be the title of his
[3:13:36] message 1951 the angel and three poles
[3:13:47] 1951 he was just barely into the second
[3:13:50] Pole and he said he had to wait nine
[3:13:54] years for the third Pole amen
[3:13:58] and this was in Phoenix on a Saturday
[3:14:03] and he said he said-she people a long
[3:14:09] time ago you wouldn't have come to God
[3:14:11] and got yourself settled down know where
[3:14:15] you were standing the Bible said in the
[3:14:18] last days that there be a famine not for
[3:14:23] bread alone but for the hearing of the
[3:14:26] word of God and it is there's a family
[3:14:31] but God has fed us to me a man he fed us
[3:14:37] when our brother was here before that
[3:14:39] was tremendous
[3:14:42] and he said there be a famine not
[3:14:44] permitted long before the hearing of the
[3:14:45] word of God and again it's the true Word
[3:14:48] of God
[3:14:49] and he said men would go from east west
[3:14:51] north and south trying to find it and
[3:14:54] would fail he said you better get sealed
[3:14:57] he said into the kingdom of God by the
[3:15:00] Holy Ghost while you got a chance you
[3:15:03] talk about a confusing time he said it's
[3:15:05] coming and he said when the Bible said
[3:15:08] he said they'd be so closed until they
[3:15:10] would deceive the very elect if possible
[3:15:16] he's prophesying this in 1951 amen
[3:15:22] when he was right into the I guess the
[3:15:27] real exciting part of his ministry the
[3:15:31] first pole second pole and he goes into
[3:15:33] expounding on the first and second pole
[3:15:35] what God was doing and what God was
[3:15:37] going to do but warning them you better
[3:15:42] get sealed now because the hour is
[3:15:44] coming when when it's gonna be so
[3:15:46] deceptive and he goes in and talks about
[3:15:49] those about those that go out and he
[3:15:52] said he jesus said they'll come to me
[3:15:53] and that day is there but I'm not done
[3:15:55] this in your name that in your name and
[3:15:57] you'll say depart from me that work
[3:15:59] iniquity I never knew you
[3:16:02] just think of that so he goes on to
[3:16:05] expound it
[3:16:06] these are preachers and so forth and
[3:16:08] everything but he'll say depart from me
[3:16:11] you workers of iniquity
[3:16:16] because that sincerity is not there that
[3:16:18] humility that humility is not there
[3:16:24] if God requires anything he requires
[3:16:27] humility for those that omble themselves
[3:16:31] shall be exalted and I mentioned a
[3:16:34] couple times in the sermon before our
[3:16:36] brother came I think it was or maybe
[3:16:38] just witnessing to somebody where the
[3:16:40] prophet of God was referring to but to
[3:16:42] have might have been brother Sharon from
[3:16:44] California and he asked a brethren and
[3:16:47] brother green was there he asked the
[3:16:49] Brethren and said brother he said why
[3:16:52] does that brother have so much power
[3:16:53] with God and the Brethren said because
[3:16:58] he prays a lot because he does this
[3:17:01] because he does that brother Brown said
[3:17:03] no no no they said well why does he have
[3:17:08] such power
[3:17:09] he said because of his humility he said
[3:17:14] he umbels himself and God exalts a man
[3:17:18] they may so what God requires in you and
[3:17:24] in me the humility we're saved by the
[3:17:27] grace of God even not works it's his
[3:17:32] work not on us amen
[3:17:35] every man that he said he's got to be
[3:17:37] born again by the Spirit of God you've
[3:17:39] got to receive the Holy Ghost to turn it
[3:17:41] down it's just the same as to turn to
[3:17:44] hope of the Old Testament down in that
[3:17:45] day or Jesus in his day some penalty and
[3:17:49] worse if you turn down the Holy Ghost he
[3:17:52] said is not the very well thought of
[3:17:54] it's talked about and all that live
[3:17:58] godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
[3:18:00] persecution
[3:18:01] well a me and you don't try to walk
[3:18:05] around it and do avoid it no your
[3:18:08] endured for Jesus sake
[3:18:12] you love him with all your heart love

[3:18:19] Jesus
[3:18:20] it wasn't brother Mike all take ministry
[3:18:24] tonight it was Jesus it was Jesus
[3:18:28] speaking to his bride Beverly was Jesus
[3:18:31] tried to encourage his bride it was
[3:18:33] Jesus tried to nurture his relationship
[3:18:35] with his bride
[3:18:36] so that why should they become more and
[3:18:38] more and more one man our brother
[3:18:43] brought it out and the Prophet said he
[3:18:46] said he said the bridegroom was the
[3:18:49] Alpha he said the bride is the Omega
[3:18:51] amen it was the word in the bridegroom
[3:18:54] the word in the bride amen
[3:18:57] thank God for the word tonight let's by
[3:19:00] the grace of God let's understand the
[3:19:04] prophecy give preeminence to him that

[3:23:41] bran I feel a religious after that Amen
[3:23:48] that wonderful is this just just to say
[3:23:49] that a man before every service we
[3:23:52] myself in the musicians go and we pray
[3:23:55] about the service we pray for a ministry
[3:23:58] we pray for everybody who comes into the
[3:24:00] door and we pray that we prayed tonight
[3:24:04] that God would lift us up into heavenly
[3:24:07] places
[3:24:08] and he did that I felt like we were
[3:24:11] climbing that ladder so nice thing about
[3:24:15] Jacob's Ladder I don't have the number
[3:24:18] well we're definitely climbing Jacob's
[3:24:20] Ladder
[3:24:20] he made one revelation after another and
[3:24:23] that's what we got tonight it's right
[3:24:25] one after another God just took us up
[3:24:27] another level very long we
[3:26:58] [Music]
[3:27:22] one day we will go up and we won't come
[3:27:24] down eternally so one more that's
[3:27:29] appropriate I think tonight all those
[3:27:32] songs were I think one more
[3:27:34] inappropriate tonight where he talked
[3:27:35] about being insecure this on this course
[3:27:38] talks about being secure 10:08 be it
[3:27:43] unto me
