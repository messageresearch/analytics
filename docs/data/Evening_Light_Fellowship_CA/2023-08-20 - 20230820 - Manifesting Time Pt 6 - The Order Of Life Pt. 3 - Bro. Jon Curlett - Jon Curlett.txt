Psalms 51 certainly enjoyed that song service this morning and it's uh it's a big thing I miss is not being able to to worship with the people and when he started singing our God is tremendous I just wanted to come back in here and just just start worshiping but I see that you guys carried the day in here amen so God bless you God bless brother Josh for for just yielding himself and these things I mean Blanca and Jensen are homesick this morning want to remember them in prayer of course we've got Camp coming up this weekend so no service on Wednesday but Friday night at the camp brother Andrew Glover will be here so remember him in prayer he's supposed to arrive Friday morning so we just trust the Lord will get him here because if he doesn't get here then we're not going to have a service that evening probably so let's just pray that God gets him here on time and without issue certainly remember the camp each one and brother Paul and Sister Kim are running the camp and they have my full support they've run the major decisions through me so please follow their instructions their requests whatever it is they ask of you they have my full support they're speaking for me in that situation so so please work with them they've got a lot of work they're doing and with a young baby and these things they don't need any hassle from anyone so let's just put our shoulder to the wheel let's do what we can amen it's a group effort they can't do it all themselves and so we want everyone to just get in there and do what they can and I was so pleased to just see out there as soon as they put the board up for for help everybody put their put their names on the list and there was no holding back or you know let's see if everybody no no everybody jumped in and that's what we want to see and that's what that's what makes a camp is when everybody's pulling their load and we're not just leaving it to the two or three that that have a burden so God bless you for that let's let's keep it on our hearts amen let's be an expectation not just for the young people but for each and every one of us that's going to go away men that God will just bless us and speak to us through brother Andrew Glover as he as he comes to minister amen Psalms 51 and verse 6 this is David speaking this is this is David's prayer David's conversation with god after the Bathsheba incident he said behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities creating me a clean heart o God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're taking a third service on on this thought of the order of life and we're still speaking on manifesting time of course and I just want to spend a service on on a new heart and a new spirit before we move into what it means to have the infilling of the Holy Spirit and and the fullness of the new birth of the finality of the new birth and I want you to see this morning what's possible with the new heart and a new spirit both the good and the bad because it's not all good and it's not all bad and it's going to depend on on really what's what's in there and what you'll surrender yourself to but what I also want us to see is what happens when we overstep what's in our heart and we go further than what God has actually placed in there and the and the dangers that happen from there when we get outside of our position or our Authority or the responsibility that he's he's given us in this life and I want to start with a scripture then go to a quote that I read last service but and the scripture would say this this is Solomon he says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he and he's speaking of a man he says as a man thinks in his heart that's exactly what he is and then I read the the there's a couple quotes I'm going to just re review here from last service to set a tone this morning and brother Brandon would say this he says so God had to give you a new heart not a patched up one he says a new heart that's your intellect that you think with a new way of thinking so a new heart is a new way of thinking it's a new approach then when he gave you a new way of thinking you say yes that's right the Bible looks to be reasonable I didn't use I used to didn't believe that I believe it now now there is your great Revival see they say yeah sure I don't want to go to hell I want to accept Christ that's all right that's good he says that's just your first step he's saying that's your great Revival that was that's what was going on in the churches that time and we'll see as we get into the statue of a perfect man much later that he'd say that you think that's the new birth that's your great Revival as you get this new heart or you get this new spirit and that's your Revival because you know something's changed but he says no no that's just one of the first steps it's a great thing don't don't not have a Revival because the process isn't done but don't think that that's the end of it all and then he would say this he says now the heart is the center of the emotions of the human being your heart is the middle of you that's exactly right so God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new heart and then he puts his spirit in the middle of the new spirit now I want you to catch the title here he says this this this message is called why some people can't keep the victory and he's talking about a Revival earlier and you have this great Revival but he says you've got to go all the way Beyond just the new heart you've got to get a new spirit inside of that new heart and then he has to put his holy spirit inside of this he's saying this is the heart is the center of your emotions it's how you think it's how you believe and God has to give you a new one because the nature the natural heart the human heart the Natural Instincts that you have they're no good he can't patch it up he's got to give you a new one and all you have to do is look around this world and see where people are following their heart and you'll see that you can't patch that up you've got to give them a new one amen but he says when he gives you this new heart now you can hear the word of God and you can connect with it you can believe it you can accept it you can say it's reasonable you can now start to be fed by the word of God it can start to have an impact on your life then he says you get a new spirit I read this last service you get a new spirit you quit you're drinking you get a new spirit you quit you're lying so now the new heart says I'll listen to the word the new spirit makes you stop doing certain things and it makes you start doing things as well and then he says you can do most anything with that Spirit but that isn't what God's talking about a new spirit he says I'll give you now watch I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit why he'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him while you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you did have you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate with the next man on the next corner you couldn't associate with these Christians why you'd have had an awful spirit so he has to give you a new spirit I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit now watch he says and I will put my spirit in you there's the difference I'll put my spirit in you notice he doesn't say that the new heart and the new spirit won't have an effect they absolutely have an effect but he says the Difference Maker is when his Spirit goes inside of those he's got to put that inside of us he puts a new spirit in you and that's your spirit that's my spirit it belongs to us it's ours it is not his it's from him but it belongs to us and it can be influenced and it can be controlled by anything it's meant to be controlled by the Holy Spirit brother Brown would talk about it that it has an inclination towards the word of God it has an inclination towards the things of God it's meant to be controlled by the Holy Spirit but yet because it's not the Holy Spirit you still have a choice you still get to decide what's going to influence you amen it's meant to be compatible with God that spirit in that new heart is meant to be compatible with God but what he's Desiring is for you to allow the Holy Spirit to sit in the control tower on the inside of the inside and that's what's ultimately going to make the difference because until that point you have a new spirit and it's allowing things in and out all day long because there's nobody seated with authority in the control tower of your heart you allow it you decide what Spirits are in there and what Spirits aren't in there it's all up to you amen but brother Brown would say with this new heart and this new spirit he would say it's the desire to do the right thing the desire to do it but he didn't say it's the power but he says it's the desire to do the right thing the holy spirit's going to be the power but the new heart and the new spirit that's the desire for these things and when I was reading these things it reminded me of that that message he preached on the wheel in the middle of the wheel and the where the the scripture where Ezekiel Saw God in the middle of the wheel and you look at that and he would say the outside is your heart and then inside that you have a spirit and that's the spokes of the wheel and then he says in the very middle is the Hub and that's the Holy Spirit and you'll notice that nothing can turn unless the Hub turns if the hub's not turning then the wheel is broken but if the Hub turns everything else turns the outside can't turn unless the inside's turning the spokes can't rotate unless the hub's turning him in what is it he says there's got to be something in control in the middle that drives your life that moves you that leads you and guides you that brings you to his purpose you're tied to the movement of the Holy Spirit the leadership of the Holy Spirit not to what you want you're not bound by conditions you're not bound by circumstances just because you're on a hill doesn't mean you have to roll The Hub determines what's going to happen and they would say this in the book of Acts they said for in him we live that means he's our source of life he says in him we move that means he's our leadership and guidance then it says and in him we have our being therefore he is our identity we are in him we are lost in him we are Christian we are Mrs Jesus Christ we are the word made flesh today amen our life our leadership and our identity are all inside of him brother Brian we'll put it this way he says Ezekiel said when I saw him he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel standing way in the middle of the air in other words the whole creation was resolved revolved around that Hub in the wheel every spoke every Rim everything else depended on the Hub in the wheel the wheel in the middle of the wheel in the middle of the air what's he saying everything is supposed to revolve around Christ in the center of our life we sing that song Jesus at the center of it all but is he is he he's saying he's supposed to be at the very center of it all we're supposed to be led by him we're not supposed to lead him we're supposed to be under his headship not our own we're supposed to be under his guidance we're supposed to move when he moves and we're supposed to stay still when he stays Stills and that's where we want to be found today that's where we want to be found today is where the holy spirit moves and then we follow after it but as we're looking at this order of life and how the new birth happens for a son or daughter of God I want to spend some time this morning on a new heart and a new spirit because remember this is where brother Braham says people get wrecked this is where people get held up this is where people fall by the roadside and what happens is they have something you have a new heart you have a new spirit it's something and it's from God and it's special and it's even Supernatural but what happens is they get to a place where what they have does not meet the need for their life and what happens is their testimony and what they have inside start to diverge because they don't have the strength inside they don't have the power inside they don't have something that holds them and their life is going one way and their testimony that they're saying goes another way because something hasn't been settled on the inside they don't have that Dynamic inside of them that's going to keep them all the way and then they realize I don't have what I what I thought I had and then what happens is they walk away if you don't have what you need that means there's something you can have that's the wonderful thing about is don't stop there and say well I don't have it and therefore I've just got to stop no say I'm going to press until I get what I need because if he's called me to the walk then he's got to provide the power to get me through to the end don't stop in that place amen but but don't leave God or or what happens oftentimes and I've seen this certainly recently is they make a big mistake and they say how can the Holy Spirit do that and it's a good question because the Holy Spirit wouldn't do that in simple fact except the Holy Spirit wouldn't do that brother Tim shared a quote with me where brother Brandon was was talking about you know his wife and and he said now if he says I believe if I cheated on my wife she'd forgive me but he said my comforter won't even let me do it brother Brown said I'm incapable of cheating on my wife because I've got something inside me that won't allow me to go there and what is it it's a sign to people I don't have what I needed to have we're not just talking backslidden we're talking doing things that the Holy Spirit absolutely forbids it cannot countenance those things and so what happens is it's a shock to them and they say well I don't have it and they walk away and sometimes this takes decades I know Believers that have walked away after 20 30 even 40 years and they get there and they don't read and then they realize I don't have the Holy Ghost and they leave rather than staying there and getting down on their knees and saying Lord I'm not moving until you give me what I have need of and then that's the determination of a believer in their heart is I'm going to get the Holy Ghost because that's the Difference Maker in all of these things right we're going to be preaching on the Statue of a perfect man and a little ways up the road but I want to borrow a quote from there just to set a bit of a stage this morning because we want to see how these things fit inside of a new heart and a new spirit brother Brown says this he says now I want to say this that there are some people he's preaching preaching from second Peter 1 the statue of a perfect man right add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge wisdom all these things he says I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so forth that don't even profess to be a Christian he says and that's true there's some people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christian but he says that won't do it notice he doesn't say they don't have it but he says what they have is not going to make them a Christian it's not going to get them across the Finish Line it's not going to get the maternal life it's not even going to give them the victory but yet he says they have a portion of what a Believer has he says it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself be better to stay a blackbird see when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he's just simply out of place and we've absolutely met people I'm sure that each of you could go down in your mind right now and you can think of people you've met and when you first met them or you spent some time around them you look at their life and you say they have some character they have characteristics they have a morality they have a patience or a strength or a moderation they even have brotherly kindness there are people I know that you can do just about anything to them and they don't get offended they don't cut off the Friendship they'll keep coming back and they'll love you and they'll appreciate you and you say what do we say about people like that we say they're a good person they're good people and they are good but they're not godly good but they have some characteristics that we admire amen and we can't deny that they even have maybe an unusual amount maybe even more than we do at times it seems and brother Brandon would say they can have the virtues of second Peter 1 and not be a Christian but he says it's a portion it's not the full meal deal but it's a portion of these things but the point I'm making is that even as brother Brad was talking about the gifts and we spoke last service that you can have these virtues without the Holy Ghost and we'll see it we're going to see it as we talk about some characters this morning how you can have a measure or a quantity enough that would be noticeable it would be admirable that people would say well that's a good manner that's a good woman and yet you don't have the Holy Ghost yet you may not even be a Christian but yet every one of us has a something on the inside of us that inclines us towards God we don't all start out with these great attributes they're in us but they may not be obvious but there's something in us that's coming towards God but until we're sealed with the holy spirit all they are is attributes that come and go and then they hit the wall because guess what life will take us right up to the edge of those attributes and then it'll go and you're tumbling over and you've got no patience you've got no strength you've got no faith why because it's not sealed but I would say it's not mortared together it's not tied down it's not finished it's not a complete work Paul would talk about it in Romans 7. we spoke about this in previous Services where you talk about that fight within them and he says their desire is there the new heart and the new spirit's there I've got a desire to do right but he says evil is always there and I keep going to the evil the desires there but the power to do it's not there and he says who will deliver me from the body of this death Paul was fed up with it he was sick and tired of being sick and tired of not having the victory but we're talking about the heart of a Believer now and I want to spend some time with Saul and David this morning because they're a perfect example of two people with the exact same anointing with two very different results and we see that the difference is not the anointing but it's the heart itself because David never had any more than Saul had and so God didn't short shift Saul when it came to giving him an anointing of a king they had two very outcomes they were both very flawed men both chosen by God and yet have very different outcomes I want to show you what Saul looked like when God chose him he says in he's speaking of Saul's father it says he had a son whose name was Saul a choice young man and goodly and there was not among the children of Israel a goodly or person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people so Saul was big muscular handsome and he was taller than everybody else in the Kingdom to look at Saul was the best of the best and God said to Samuel he says this is him and so Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be Captain over his inheritance he said and the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shall prophesy with them he's saying you're going to go by the school of prophets and you're going to prophesy and he says and you shall be turned into another man and let it be that when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasions serve thee for God is with thee says so as these opportunities arise as events unfold he says step into it because God has put them in front of you and you're meant to go inside of them now we see right after that that Saul's going because remember he's looking for the donkeys that his dad had lost and he goes by way of the school of prophets and as soon as he's in the school of prophets he starts to prophesy and people start saying is Saul a prophet is he numbered among the prophets do we have a new prophet in our midst but as soon as he leaves then that goes away but in all of that Saul doesn't tell anybody I'm going to be king he doesn't say I'm anointed to be king he's under an anointing and it's causing him to do new things but he's not even yet a king yet he's still under an influence and it's having an effect on him then we go to where Samuel's announcing the new king and it's kind of like they have a stage up here and Samuel's up there and he says I'm going to introduce your new king to you and then they say well where is he he says I don't know so they literally had to go ask God where is Saul it says therefore they inquired of the Lord further if the man should yet come to them so they said is he going to come out or is he not going to come out who is he where is he and the Lord answered and said behold he had hid himself amongst the stuff Saul was hiding out because he didn't think he should be king let me tell you something if you don't think you should you definitely want to hold off don't let people pull you into it don't let people push you into it don't let people pry you into it don't let people cajole you into it don't let people joke you into it you wait he says he hath hid himself among the stuff so Saul was modest Saul felt unworthy Saul didn't think he should be doing this it says and they ran and fetched him then some when he stood up among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward and Samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the Lord had chosen that there is none like him among all the people now I want you to notice something here God says nobody can touch Saul he's the best of the best but who is he what is he using as a measuring stick the Kings like everybody else has this is not God's choice this is God's choice based on the people's desires he says this is the best you're going to get in this Kingdom you wanted a king like everybody else here is a king just like everybody else he says there's nobody else like him this is the most kingly of men that we have inside of Israel and the people shouted and said God Save the King and Saul is now anointed by God the presence the spirit the holy spirit is on Saul in those days God could anoint a man he couldn't fill him in but he could anoint the man God could put an anointing on that man to draw him into the purpose and pill and plan of God but that anointing did not control him it was an influence not a control amen it was more like the brooding of the holy spirit that we talked about where the presence of God is around you and it's calling you and it's making an impression it's trying to get you to a certain place but it's with you it's not in you and there's a big difference in that because we can experience this this with us when we're in a service and the presence of the Lord comes down even the personal presence of God is in the building and you can feel that remember brother Brandon will be in the in the prayer line and he'd have people come up and they'd come up and he'd say now you feel that you feel that you know something's here don't you you're in the presence of the Angel of the Lord and they could feel that and it's a presence and it's an anointing but it's only with them it's not in them and so there's great potential when the Lord is with you but it's not the filling the infilling of the holy spirit amen so we know the story about Paul I preached on it for the Paul has preached on it extensively with the young people I know and Saul did well for a very short time but within two years Saul makes a fatal mistake two years and Saul is toast in the eyes of God and what was his mistake he strayed from his calling as king and he stepped into the office of prophet he stepped into a ministerial office instead of a kingly office and he offered a sacrifice instead of waiting for Samuel to show up and at that moment God said the kingdom is going to be taken away from you his impatience and his worry and the pull of the people caused him to step out of his place and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee but I want you to consider something this after this Saul still got victories Saul still ruled as King Saul still defeated his enemies he still kept the land safe he still kept the people safe and the prophets still kept coming to him to tell him what to do but did you ever notice Saul always needed a prophet Saul had no relationship with God God couldn't speak to Saul but with David the only time he needed a prophet was for correction otherwise God worked with David all along God could work with David God couldn't work with Saul God had respect for that kingly position God didn't forsake the people because the leader had fallen and so for the sake of the people he kept trying to lead Saul he kept trying to guide us all he kept giving Saul his orders and his commands and Saul never had his own leadership from God he always had to go through an intermediary he always had to go through a prophet and he's still anointed king God says I'm taking the Kingdom from you I've found somebody that's just that has a heart just like mine but he's still anointed and he's still King God didn't move a single thing from there and yet Saul could never truly humble himself to fully obey the word of God Saul was a 95 percent believer he'd go just to the edge and they'd stop he'd never do it exactly the way God told us to do it he could never do it he could never do it his repentance was always in the moment and then he come right back around and he'd make the same mistake over and over and over again and not only that when he made the mistake he doubled down he'd say no no I did it I did what the Lord said and you know we see at the end when he goes after agag and the amlikites and and God said destroy everything destroy the animals and and he tells Saul you know he saved some of the animals and he comes to Samuel and he says Samuel I've done what the Lord command and Samuel says how can you say that when I can hear the cows moving and the and the goats bleeding and the Sheep banging I mean the evidence is in front of you that you didn't do it and yet Saul was so blinded by his own importance by his own desire for people to look up to him that he couldn't even see that he disobeyed the word of a god and then he'd act repentant when the prophet finally pinned him down he'd act repentant but what would he do he'd always come back to but don't make me look bad that's all he wanted he didn't want to look bad he didn't want to be embarrassed he didn't want the people to see him get knocked down like that Saul this is Samuel talking to him he says Samuel said to Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night he said to him say on and Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel so Saul's stepped changed as soon as he stepped into kingship and it wasn't a humble change it was a prideful change Saul went backward the minute he became king he never moved forward he says and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord but this fly upon the spoil and this evil in the sight of the Lord these are the potential actions of a Believer with a heart inclined towards God but without character for their position Saul's a believer Saul is a a predestinated son of God but what is it he stepped higher than his character he stepped higher than he's meant to be Saul Saul was was weak he wasn't meant to be a king he wasn't chosen because he was kingly he was chosen because he looked like a king not because he actually was a king inside of him on the inside of his heart his position was higher than his character and his heart was not compatible with kingship Saul was not a great leader Saul was a great figurehead but he wasn't a great leader his approach is thinking his desires were not those of a king and if you look in the scripture you'll realize the problem with Saul is that he was never proven and he was never trained he was never tested before he was put into position he was put into position with an anointing but without any training without any testing Saul skipped out on King's School David went through it for 15 years Saul skipped it and that was God showing that the appearance was not going to get us there the way we look the way we think or even our natural heart even a new heart won't get us there there's something has to happen there's a training there's a proving that has to go but Saul was a Believer he didn't go to hell when he died remember Samuel said you're going to be with me you're going to be with me Saul you're going to die in battle and your sons are going to die in battle but you're going to be with me he was still a predestinated Son of God but he was outside of what his true calling he was meant to be just a regular guy it's okay to be a regular guy most of us are meant to be regular in the sense that hey you can't have too many chiefs but stay in your lane stay in your lane if God will train you you'll be ready as you step up into these different things Saul was a good man but ruined by the desires of the people it was the people put him there if the people never ask for a king if the people never forsaken the prophets if they never walked away from God then Saul would never been put in the position it was the desires of the people that destroyed him he was and then he was destroyed by a lack of preparation as well God said you you guys want a king I'll give you a king but don't expect me to train him you're going to have to work with him and then in the end he was overcome by his own ambitions Saul started falling pretty quickly within two years Saul had fallen and yet even after he falls he says I want to be king more than I want to be right and he keeps going and making the same mistake over and over again he got a taste of what it meant to have power to have influence to have money to have whatever he wanted to be able to control people in these different things and that was his downfall was he wanted that more than he wanted to be right with God I know us we know Samuel went in the morning after this he was just heartbroken because he saw the effect not just on Saul I believe he saw that Saul was a good man at heart but way out of his League way over his head and the people were suffering because of it as well and then God comes and he says hey quit your morning I've got somebody else prepared go and anoint him and so we know Samuel goes over to Bethlehem and he goes to the house of Jesse and and Jesse starts to bring his sons perform and of course the way they did those days you started with the oldest and so eliab was the oldest that said and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him and the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance nor on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart eliab was the oldest no doubt the biggest the strongest and Samuel said this is the obvious choice and God said obvious is not the way I work obvious is not the way I work right God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts and his ways are higher than our ways and they're incompatible they don't work together he says I'm looking at the heart and eliab's heart is not going to do the job as king says in Samuel said unto Jesse are here all thy children because he went through the whole all the whole the whole list of brothers and they all went before him he says well maybe the next one then maybe the next one hey they all look good God said no none of them I've rejected them all and he said there remains yet the youngest and behold he keeps the sheep and Samuel said to Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither he says we're not going to eat until we've seen the last son and he sent and brought him in now he was Ruddy and with all of the beautiful countenance and goodly to look at that means he was handsome it's not that God doesn't choose good-looking people but he doesn't choose them because they're good looking your looks matter not to God Christ came and there was nothing about him that was good looking it's not that he can't use a good-looking person but he doesn't choose him because they're good looking because that's what Saul was Saul was just good looking but he didn't have anything inside that would resonate with God he said and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama it says but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him now remember God doesn't have evil spirits but we see that what Satan and his demons can come before the Throne of God in those times and they can come there and God can allow them access he did it with job he did it with the lying prophets of of Ahab remember when Jehoshaphat came a lion Spirit came up before God and he says I'll go down and I'll make those prophets prophesy falsely and God allows it and what happened is God allows an evil spirit to come take the place of the spirit that was resting on him from God as soon as the spirit the kingly spirit falls on David it can't stay on Saul anymore and so it jumps away but I want to show you something here that's critical as we're talking about the New Birth because David has a heart that's like God's heart the difference between Saul and David is David's heart is like God's heart that means his thoughts are Godly the way God thinks his motives are like Gods his objectives are like Gods he's subject to the word of God and he does things fully according to the word that's the big difference between the two of them but this isn't the infilling of the Holy Ghost he has the Holy Spirit on him and we'll read a quote where brother Brown says it he has the holy spirit with him but this is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost we know that Joel 228 ports forward to it John the Baptist pointed forward to it Jesus pointed forward to it this is what they could have then which was an anointing on them but not in them and brother Brown says it this way he says from that day the Holy Spirit was with David he said God was with him he went back out into the Wilderness happy that's an amazing thing the kingly spirit is all him a holy spirit anointing is on him to take him into kingship and he goes back into his little job as a shepherd and he's happy they went on back down and the spirit departed from Saul he'd backslid and went so far away from God until the spirit had left him and an evil spirit took his place and come on Saul you know what a sinner can't backslide only a Christian can backslide Saul was a Christian he was a he was a professing Believer he was a Believer it says and Saul was all Moody and in a bad humor and kicking things around all out of sorts like some people gets on Monday morning I saw a couple people laugh because what if your anointing is only in church come Monday morning you're all out of sorts you want to know if you've got an infilling or just an anointing on you how does your action on Monday compare to your action on Sunday when you're in church amen he says so he was out of sorts all the time and we see Saul Saul was a Grumpy Bear he was like a bear with a wounded Paul throwing Spears at everyone yelling at everybody accusing them of working against them even his own son everything was against Saul in his head everybody was out to get him he says he was all out of sorts he was out of sorts all the time did you know that's an evil spirit if our Mondays look like that there's something missing we're talking about an anointing and an anointing can lift off of you it can pull away and you can pull away you can backslide out of an anointing you can pull away from these things an anointing isn't part of you but it's with you and it's on you but it can go away as well and how do we know that because it went away from Saul and it rested on somebody else it's separated from Saul the king anointing moved from one man to another and in Saul's place now something's got to take it and so an evil spirit comes down why because he was focused on image image is what ran Saul's life he wrote he wanted to look correct rather than be correct he wanted to look respectable rather than be respectable but understand this David and Saul are both believers both sons of God both called of God and yet one is in his right position and one was completely out of his element yet with the same anointing David didn't get anything more than Saul did in this anointing it's the exact same anointing what was on Saul came on David and yet has a completely different result Saul shouldn't have been King at all that's a simple truth he shouldn't have been King but there was nothing in him that would allow him to do these things the king anointing from God couldn't overcome what was in Saul's heart and you get a right heart you get a right Spirit a new heart a new spirit just the anointing on you is not going to override that because you're still in control it's yours it's not his it's from him but it's still yours you need us you need something inside of the control tower Saul never grew in character saw never matured Saul never improved with time in fact Saul went downhill almost from the day he started in there he had a few good moments but even we see what he did with Jonathan he was mad at his own son and was going to kill his son for giving them Victory because he got a religious attitude and tried to put something on the people that the scriptures never told him to do and then Jonathan goes and eats some honey and Saul says I'm going to kill you for that because I said we weren't going to do it Saul was holding the people back from Victory out of a religious spirit and Jonathan went and did the Practical thing and got a great victory so I'll turn against everyone he couldn't yield to the will of God all he wanted was him him me me me I I exact same anointing on David produced a completely different result and it was because he had the heart of God inside of him he had a heart like God's inside of him Saul's request to Samuel was don't embarrass me don't walk away from me get down and pray with me let the people see that you're still with me don't let them know I'm messed up don't let them know I've lost the kingdom just make me look good in front of them but what was David's after David failed God what did what did David do when he failed when he he killed Uriah and he took Bathsheba and he he committed adultery and he committed murder consider that church a man after God's Own Heart committed adultery and committed murder remember brother Brown says with that new spirit you can do just about anything why because you're not sealed the control tower is open for discussion still a child of God still a child of God and that's Grace Church a child of God can commit adultery and they can commit murder in the process of the new birth why because they're not a finished work and that's why we look to Grace and the blood of Jesus Christ but let's look at what we read and this was our opening scripture I'll read a few more I'll start a little earlier for it in Psalms 51. this is David's prayer to God after it's made very clear that he sinned with bathsheb and it's all out in the open he says have mercy upon me o God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions David never makes an excuse he doesn't give a reason but you committed adultery and you committed murder it's not like there's a religious spirit can make that right but you'd be surprised how many people will do it the murder of man's character and they'll go out and they'll take a man's wife they'll remarry do these different things and they'll put a religious spin on it he says Wash Me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me he's not trying to hide it he's not trying to bury it he's not trying to put it on anybody else he says I did it because what the prophet said Thou Art the man and David said you know what I am the man I did it shouldn't have done it but I did it and he humbled himself and he went to God and he asked for mercy he said against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold I was shaping an iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom he says Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean now remember what did they use hyssop for they use it to apply the blood on the doorposts of the home and what did it do it Justified the entire house the blood covered the sins of those that were inside of it but he says listen it's not enough to just put it on the doors of my house he says I want it on the doors of my life I need blood on me I need you to purge me I need you to cover me I need you to what take this sin away he's saying God you've got to do this work not me Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May rejoice brother Brian would talk about the shepherd remember him when he's got a disobedient sheep that keeps wandering away what does he do he takes the leg and he places it over a rock and he strikes it and he breaks the leg he says and then he sets that joint or that bone he says and then he carries that lamb around for weeks until it can walk on its own he says and that's so that the Sheep will get attached to the shepherd David says you've broken some bones he says fix them he says hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart o God and renew a right Spirit within me he says cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me permanently he's saying don't remove my anointing God because without it I'm going right back to Saul I'll be in a Saul condition he says I won't be able to do what you call me to do if you take that anointing from me he says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit David acknowledged with no excuse he messed up and then he truly repented he didn't try and hide then try and step away the woman that thou gave me right no no he said this one's on me it's all on me and I need you to do something in my life he asked for an immortal change he asked for a cleansing he knew he'd messed up he knew that he was lacking something and he didn't care about his image he didn't care about Restoration in the eyes of the people all he wanted to do was get back in the presence of that anointing that's all David wanted to do why because God had withdrawn that anointing from David in his sin David said you've you've pulled away you've pulled away but you got to come back I need you back why because that anointing can raise and drop rise and drop based on David's actions he says get me back in your presence God that's where I belong better is one day in your courts than thousands elsewhere he says one thing if I desired all David wanted to do was be in the presence of God and that's the only thing what is it he lost the feeling of joy of his salvation brother I would say Time Time Again David never lost his salvation he lost the feeling of it he lost the joy of his salvation he lost the satisfaction of his relationship with God what he was just going through a Daily Grind now because he was in the doldrums he messed up and he wasn't feeling it if we could put it that way and he was crying out to God saying come back come back I need you I can't live like this I don't want to live like this church is not wrong to ask God to restore the emotion of our relationship my wife and I at times in in our marriage you know I've spoken about this many times we had times where it felt clinical and it felt like a business transaction at times where it was just go to work and come home and do this and do that and you're just in a role rather than in a relationship that's no way for a marriage to work it's no way for a Christian to have a relationship with God where it's just well I'm going to go to church on Wednesday nights I'm going to go to church on Sunday mornings I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to no no that's clinical that's roll that's role playing but if there's no joy there if there's no peace there there's no love there if there's no satisfaction there then what is it doing it's not wrong to ask God to restore the joy the emotion of the relationship because it's supposed to be there brother Brown would say if there's no emotion there is no life there's got to be something there love will have emotion attached to it peace obviously has a motion attached to it rest in these different things amen we need to enjoy our walk with God even in the hard times we ought to be able to say he's with me and I'm okay with what's going on you notice what happened when that King anointing lifted with David became on David became judgmental and he lost his discernment because that story compared to what David had just gone through is so obvious that you'd think David should have got it it was a very obvious thing to talk about and yet his conscience didn't bother him and he immediately went to judgment he became religious he became zealous without conscience or humility and he didn't actually look inward he was always at turned now towards the outward and he was so quick to judge somebody else why because that anointing has gone away and he lost his discernment didn't even realize he was talking about him but what restored David Church what restored David back to where that anointing could come back on him to where he could step into his kingship again repentance but even with repentance under the law of Moses David was supposed to die king or not David was supposed to die let's know what the prophet of God says what saved David when his own judgment said the man will die he'll pay to the uttermost and he'll pay for it with his life and the prophet said surely Grace you'll not die you'll not die David Grace has saved you it was Grace to David that saved him oh my if it hadn't been for Grace where will we all be he says is that right certainly Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign one Sovereign he says what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants to Sovereign can do whatever it wants to Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody the bride supposed to be gracious freely you've received freely give our thoughts ought to be gracious our approach ought to be gracious our response ought to be gracious because it's Grace that called us Grace is supposed to flow through us he says therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody it doesn't have to it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it doesn't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this can I must I will I doesn't do it it does it itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the vilest he can save the impurest he can save the immoralist he can heal the sickest he says hallelujah we're talking about a new heart and a new spirit we see two sons of God with a heart inside of them and the only difference is that heart same role same anointing Same Spirit two very different outcomes David for all God's compliments about his heart still committed murder and adultery David had good intentions and you know what David's good intentions took the ark from where it was resting and he put it on a card of oxen and caused a righteous man to put his hand out and die when he tried to touch the ark and he wasn't allowed to because he wasn't a priest David's good intentions got a righteous man killed why because he didn't check his intentions with the word he had the right idea he had a good idea but he didn't check it with the word he had an anointing of the spirit of God that was calling him to bring that Ark back but he didn't check it with the word David didn't have a new birth he just had an anointing and that meant it was subject still to him rather than to God David had a heart that God said his his heart's just like my heart and yet he was able to do some pretty bad things in his life but one thing about that heart is that it kept bringing him back to God it kept bringing him to repentance it kept bringing him to seeking the presence of God more than everything else when David lost his kingship see Saul of Saul lost his kingship or when salt had a a threat against his kingship he always struck out it was always violence it was always violence with Saul and yet David when Absalom takes the kingdom away and he's walking out and there's that guy comes out and he's cursing he's throwing rocks and and one of the sons you know Joe abber one of them says let me go take the head off that guy and he says no leave him Lord told him to do it don't worry about it why the law gives the Lord takes away all David cared about is is a is am I in the will of God is God still with me personally not blessing everything around me but is God still with me do I still have that relationship that connection if God puts a new heart and a new spirit in US it'll bring us to repentance every single time because that's the heart for this age is to repent that's the Zeal of this age is to repent and if you're going to come to the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's got to be something in you that causes to us to repent that causes us to acknowledge our shortcomings that causes us to to talk about a need for deliverance that causes us to to seek leadership and guidance in these different things what is it David call it he said there's a deep crying to the Deep he said as the deer pants for the water so my soul longeth after thee David's only desire from that heart like God's heart was to seek the presence of God we're going to close with a thought here from Jeremiah and I love Jeremiah because he talks about the heart and he gives us such a clear picture of the dangers of the heart and the blessings of a heart if God's in it he says thus saith the Lord curse it be the man that trusteth in man and make it flesh his arm and whose heart departed from the Lord in other words he who depends on himself and those around him he says for he shall be like the heath in the desert and it shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited now that's not a good place to be in a desert you don't get any benefit from the rain and you're in a salt land and nothing grows in the salt land that's what they used to do in the old days is when a a a a country came in and conquered another one they'd salt the fields because it destroys the fields for decades because it ruins the mineralogy and you can't grow anything in it but then he says blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spreadth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh in other words it's not affected by heat it's not affected by circumstances it's not affected by tough circumstances but her leave shall be green and shall not be careful in other words shall not be worried or anxious in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so in other words the conditions don't keep the believer from producing the fruit of the Holy Spirit reproduce no matter what why because we're planted by a different well we're planted by a different River of water we're always provided for amen but watch this transition though as Jeremiah comes in because he's contrasting between a man that trusts in himself and a man that trusts in God and he brings it back to the root of the problem and he says the heart is deceitful Above All Things all things and desperately wicked now that's not a good combination deceitful and wicked because it means it's always going to lead you the wrong way always always always he says who can know it who can understand it who can predict it he says I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns that word Reigns actually means heart so he says I search it and I try it even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings so what's this warning here don't trust your heart even if you get a new heart it's not enough to trust the new heart because that new heart is supposed to lead you to God it does not replace God it's supposed to lead you to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit it doesn't replace it amen we have this saying that there's no deceit like self-dece it's a religious spirit today in in this laodicean church age and it's the highest form of Deceit that we face today because our heart tells us our heart tells us what's right and it blinds us to the word of God the words mantra today the world is saying follow your heart and you know what they're preaching it in churches follow your heart you can't do that remember David had a heart to build a house for the Lord and the prophet came and said do it do what's in your heart David the prophet didn't even check with God God the prophet said that sounds like a great idea do what's in your heart then the prophet goes away and God says no no no no David can't do it because he's a man of blood he says his son will build the temple so what did David do then Prophet comes back says sorry you're not allowed to do it great intentions good idea but it's not for you to do it but David said I'll prepare the way for it then I'll get everything prepared so that they can build it I'll get the materials together I'll get the contracts together I'll get everything prepared so that when my son he comes he's got everything that he needs to build it but yet his inclination of that heart was to do something and God didn't have it in his will for David to do it don't trust your heart your heart is the most deceitful thing there is and is desperately wicked Jeremiah said it's why we need a new one and even that new one isn't perfect but it's inclined towards the right thing but it's still going to be a battle amen that's why we follow what the word of God says not what feels right we hear it a lot even in message circles I feel led to do such and such I feel led to go so and so but you know what we don't hear I feel led to do such and such because the word says it and we've taken the leading and what ignore the word brother Brown says the holy spirit will lead you to the word not just the holy spirit will lead you but the holy spirit will lead you to the word he'll give you a basis he'll give you a foundation for your life for your decisions for your actions for the things you do and say and what happens is we go by what we if we were really honest we'd say it's a gut feeling but a gut feeling is not necessarily the Holy Ghost it has to be founded on the word of God Amen that's why we put the word of God in front of us as fine as frontlets and not our heart and not a new heart and not a new spirit we put the word in front of us and the word leads and guide us always always if it ain't in the word you're on your own you're on your own now the Holy Spirit can lead you in areas where maybe the word doesn't have something specific for it we Face a lot of Temptations we Face a lot of situations today we have a lot of Technology we have a a way of living today that's quite different than they ever imagined in Scripture but God has provided us a word to get us through so I have a hard time when somebody says well there's nothing in the word about it I believe there's always something in the word if we'll wait and be patient and pray and trust God will show us something in the word he'll do it because he's promised to lead us and guide us amen David's good intentions in his heart got him to bring the heart the the ark back to Jerusalem but his presumption of how to do it got a man killed why David's not a priest Dave is not supposed to move the Ark of the Covenant King's not supposed to do that the ministry's supposed to do it he got out of his Lane and it killed a man David numbered the people against the word of God he took a census why does the king Take a census to see how many people are there to see how many warriors he has to see how powerful his kingdom has become and God had forbidden them don't ever take a census because he says I am the one that makes the difference in you you're not going to win by Charities not going to win by horses you're not going to win by how many great warriors you have you're going to win because I'm with you and David disobeyed it and he got literally thousands of people killed because he got caught up in his own kingship even with a heart that was inclined towards God this new heart is meant to make you listen it's meant to make you learn it's meant to make you seek after the things of God give you a new approach a new way of thinking a new desire the prophet of God said it's supposed to drive you to the word of God but you still have a choice even with a new heart and a new spirit that's why we take everything back to an absolute which is the scriptures not on the feeling because remember the heart he said is the center of emotion and just because it feels a certain way doesn't mean that's the way it's supposed to be what is it we've got to put something in the middle of that heart that is an absolute in and of itself that is a token that is a finished work it's a seal that's what we're looking for is not a feeling but it's an absolute inside of us Church everyone in the Old Testament was looking forward to what we get to experience today in the full New Birth they experience justification under the blood of bulls and goats under the atonement brother Brahm said they experience justification their sins were covered and they were allowed to approach God in a certain way not in fullness but they were allowed to approach God he would work with them he would teach them he would bless them in these different things those sins were placed on animals the animals paid the price with their life and so those people could experience justification and sanctification in the fact that they could what they could walk around and they could they could hear the word that was preached by Moses and the priesthood and these different things and they could live a Sanctified life Paul lived a Sanctified life when he was Saul he lived a Sanctified life he says according to to the way that it's taught he says I was a perfect man there's no flaw in the way that I lived according to the word they had Sanctified lives but yet they did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they could have a cleaned up life and they could be sinless under that blood but yet they could not approach the presence of God they could not be the dwelling place of God the best thing they could have would be an anointing on them that could come and go based on their actions but they couldn't have something that was with them all the time they were anointed and listened Church they did amazing things with that anointing they did Supernatural things under that anointing Joshua stopped the Sun and the Moon and yet he did not have the Holy Ghost Inside of him shamgar killed 600 Philistines look at what David did as a young man killed a giant under an anointing but yet not having the holy spirit in himself they all look towards what we were to what we would have and the scripture says that without us they can't even be made perfect everything they were looking for was something that was down the road and we get to get it but I want to close the script this this service on a scripture and a quote here and they're they're both prayers one's by David and one's by Brother Branham and we've got Camp next week and I just wanted to kind of set a tone as we start to close us down this this morning because I believe this is our hearts cry each one David would say this in Psalms 139 search me o God try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting brother Graham says we want to be led by your holy son Jesus Christ to eternal life this is 14 sorry this is 18 17 days before he dies I got those numbers wrong last time he didn't die in the 25th he died on the 24th so he's 17 days 1207 17 days before he dies he says we want to be led by your holy son Jesus Christ to her eternal life give it to our hearts tonight Lord tear out the old Stony heart place into us the new heart the heart of Flesh the heart that you can talk to and deal with and we will not be haughty or different he says may the Holy Spirit never leave Lord may it come and ordain this people oh I thought only ministers could be ordained your priests and kings he says ordain this people speak to them tear up their Stony wills and put in the will of God save everyone father give us of thy love get us to a place Lord that will get away from all the emotional part not without emotion but to get past the emotion to the real solid part of the feeling the heartfelt part the deepness of the spirit The Riches of God the kingdom of the spirit in our hearts he says granted o great leader great holy spirit before you take your flight into the skies with your church amen God bless you let's stand together if we would amen is that our hearts cry this morning I said before even when you get the Holy Ghost there's still a sanctification that continues there's an ongoing work there's something that he's always working with in our lives amen and the greatest sign that we've gotten cold is that we stop asking for change we stop asking to be like the word we stop asking for deliverance we stop asking for power we stop asking for God to move in our lives in the way that he has in the past when we're so settled that nothing is moving that's when we've gotten cold that's when we've gotten starchy that's when we've gotten formal but when we had that cry in our hearts that says Lord I want more Lord I need more Lord the challenge is rising in front of me my family is rising in front of me I need more to meet the challenge of this day I need an assurance your brother Brown says he says when you pray you've got to have a token you've got to have something that you say you gave me this you gave me this so I could meet my needs not so I could run around and play church not so I could run around and pretend I'm a manifested Son of God but you gave me a token so that I could come before your throne of grace so that I could go to the bank of heaven and say I have a need and that's why we need that Holy Ghost is because that is the security the assurance that our prayers are heard because why he says when you ask it in my name he says I'll give it to you you've got to have a token for your Assurance you've got to have a settled feeling in your heart unknowing that he's finished it he sealed it and everything is settled then he says you ask what you will and I'll give it to you whatever you ask in my name I'll give it to you then John would say whatever we ask according to his will he'll give it to us that takes a token that takes something in the control tower rather than just a new spirit and a new heart but it takes the word in flesh once again not just in Christ not just in a prophet but in Sons and Daughters of God that have been filled with the spirit and sealed to the day of their Redemption amen hey man let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord surely we have need of you Lord we've been blessed by your goodness by Your Grace by your forgiveness Lord by a finished work at Calvary but Lord that was the starting place to the redeeming Lord in the adopting of Sons and Daughters of God and Lord there's something in us that's crying out Abba Father Lord there's something in us that says there's more or there's something in us that says I've got to die so you can live Lord I pray you keep us humble Lord but in that humility Lord may we have great expectation or for the work and will of your word in our lives nor for the leadership and guidance of the Holy Spirit Heavenly Father Lord may we seek you with all of our hearts and all of our souls Lord because the scripture says when we'll seek you we'll find you when we'll knock you open Lord and what we have need of will be given to us Lord what we have need of today is more of you to offer a deeper relationship Lord where we can have the emotion and we can have the Dynamics of that emotion Heavenly Father Lord fill us a new with your life we pray Lord bless your people we ask in Jesus name amen do we know that song touch your people once again I
