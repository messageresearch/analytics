[26:40] amen amen praise the lord
[27:04] oh
[27:07] um i was uh
[27:12] this thought kept coming to me and um so
[27:15] i'll just
[27:16] hopefully i can say it right but um
[27:21] there was a time where i i didn't really
[27:24] know
[27:25] how to stand
[27:32] with healing
[27:35] i knew it was there for me but i just
[27:38] didn't know how to um
[27:43] how to get there and um
[27:47] brother ben was here for meetings and
[27:50] while he was preaching
[27:53] he just talked about how we are our
[27:55] fathers
[27:57] our fathers we are our fathers and
[28:02] it kind of just put me in mind of like
[28:05] um
[28:07] uh the israelites had god had given them
[28:11] the land
[28:12] and it was theirs and so they could say
[28:14] this is my father's land
[28:16] and you have to get off it wasn't
[28:17] necessary he's given it to me but
[28:20] it just he the way he said it was kind
[28:22] of like oh
[28:24] i am my father's and
[28:27] the devil has no place in my father's
[28:31] and my father's kingdom so
[28:34] so so if you look at yourself as
[28:38] gods god's land gods
[28:41] god's child you can say you don't belong
[28:44] here anymore
[28:45] and it just helped me um
[28:49] just think of it that way i wasn't
[28:51] really looking at you you can't really
[28:53] look at yourself
[28:54] there's nothing in yourself that you can
[28:56] really say but when you
[28:58] see yourself in god and as his then you
[29:00] can say
[29:01] no you you don't belong here and you
[29:04] have to
[29:04] there's an appointed time while you
[29:06] where you have to get out
[29:08] so anyway i don't know if that helps
[29:11] anybody but
[29:12] it kept coming to me and i thought i
[29:14] would share that

[44:56] perspective of walking in the light and
[44:58] that little bit of growth and that
[44:59] little bit of
[45:00] of movement day by day and so often as
[45:03] believers i feel we can get hung up on
[45:05] the idea that
[45:06] nothing's changing you know you look
[45:08] around and you see nothing's happening
[45:10] and
[45:10] it's the end time and i should be
[45:12] growing more quickly and the world is
[45:14] changing why am i not changing why am i
[45:16] not growing
[45:16] why am i not strengthening and you know
[45:19] it can get depressing sometimes because
[45:21] the expectations are high and you have
[45:23] high expectations the word is going
[45:25] forth
[45:25] you're reading your bible you're praying
[45:27] and the lord is calling you to things
[45:29] and yet sometimes you say it's not
[45:30] happening why is it not happening
[45:32] and we sit there and we kind of get down
[45:34] at ourselves and there's a few things
[45:35] that often
[45:36] are the cause for that and the first
[45:37] thing is that usually we're looking for
[45:39] big change
[45:41] right we're looking for a miracle to
[45:43] happen as opposed to the progressive
[45:45] work of character
[45:46] amen we're looking for god to do a
[45:48] sovereign work
[45:50] of immediacy as opposed to the slaugh
[45:53] the long slow grind of growth
[45:56] amen can you imagine if jensen decided
[45:59] that he wanted to be my
[46:00] size tomorrow amen jensen is called to
[46:04] be a man
[46:05] but jensen is not called to be a man
[46:07] tomorrow
[46:08] jensen is a man he's potentially a man
[46:11] everything that's in him
[46:12] is going to call him to be a man but he
[46:14] is not a man today he's got to grow
[46:15] into manhood amen it's not going to
[46:18] happen in a day and as believers it's
[46:19] the same thing
[46:20] nothing happens overnight amen so we
[46:23] forget that the christian walk is
[46:24] exactly that it is a step-by-step
[46:27] moment by moment day by day progression
[46:30] as opposed to an immediate jump from
[46:31] level 1 to level 100
[46:33] amen we don't become great warriors of
[46:35] the faith in an instant generally
[46:37] but it's god building us up in the most
[46:38] holy faith
[46:40] and bringing us to a place where we can
[46:42] trust him amen
[46:43] the second thing is that we're looking
[46:45] to see it in the mirror
[46:46] and we're looking to see something
[46:48] happen somehow that we can look at it
[46:50] and positively identify christ in our
[46:52] life
[46:52] and i'm not saying we're waking up in
[46:54] the morning and looking in the mirror
[46:55] and saying i should see christ
[46:56] but my point is we're looking at
[46:58] ourselves in the wrong way amen
[46:59] we're looking at ourselves through
[47:00] natural eyes we're not looking at
[47:02] ourselves through spiritual eyes
[47:03] and you're going to be sadly
[47:04] disappointed unless you're looking in
[47:06] the mirror of the word
[47:07] so you've got to be able to look into
[47:09] situations you got to be able to look
[47:11] into
[47:11] your motives and your objectives
[47:13] sometimes rather than the results
[47:14] because it's going to manifest bit by
[47:16] bit and slowly by slowly
[47:18] and so you've got to be able to
[47:19] recognize where it's happening and it's
[47:21] not all going to happen at one time amen
[47:24] you're not going to lift
[47:25] 300 pounds the first day you're going to
[47:27] work yourself up to a bit by bit and
[47:28] you've got to recognize that the working
[47:30] is
[47:31] as much god as is the final result amen
[47:34] amen in the holy spirit does not
[47:36] transform our outer man it transforms
[47:38] our inner man and it brings our outer
[47:39] man subjective to it
[47:41] amen so we want to be looking to the
[47:42] inner man and seeing where the growth is
[47:44] not always looking to the outer man amen
[47:46] see that god is working on the inside
[47:48] first
[47:48] if we start out from the outside we're
[47:50] going into legalism that's what's
[47:51] happening is we're trying to modify
[47:53] our behavior for how people will look at
[47:55] us the perceptions that they have
[47:56] rather than the inward man which is
[47:58] where god looks and saying lord make a
[47:59] change in there so that it will come out
[48:01] on the outside
[48:02] and then people will see christ as
[48:03] opposed to see the the clothing of the
[48:05] pharisees and the sadducees the actors
[48:07] amen
[48:08] and then the third thing is that we are
[48:10] in expectation but we are on
[48:12] our own timeline and that is perhaps the
[48:14] biggest disappointment at times is
[48:16] because we know
[48:17] and we've been preaching many things
[48:18] over this pope in the last while about
[48:20] leaning on the promise promises of god
[48:22] and looking to god for great things and
[48:24] holding on to the word and stepping out
[48:26] under the word in these things
[48:27] and so we step out and then it doesn't
[48:29] happen immediately or it doesn't happen
[48:31] in
[48:31] our time or when we're expecting it but
[48:33] we've got to remember that god is
[48:34] looking at us through the eyes of
[48:36] eternity he's not looking at things
[48:37] through time
[48:38] he knows the beginning from the end and
[48:39] on that basis he's not in a hurry
[48:41] amen and the thing is when we look at
[48:43] where we want to go we have to have
[48:45] character to handle where we're going to
[48:47] be
[48:47] we have to have character to handle the
[48:49] promise that we're claiming amen
[48:50] god doesn't just go around willy-nilly
[48:52] and handing out great power and
[48:54] authority
[48:55] amen he doesn't do that rather he builds
[48:57] you up to it so that by the time you get
[48:59] to it you've got the character to handle
[49:01] it and now he can
[49:02] trust you to use it not only in your
[49:03] life but he can start to use it now in
[49:04] the body amen it's not just for yourself
[49:07] it's for everyone else and then so the
[49:09] thought is again
[49:10] one step in the right direction is all
[49:12] we're looking for we don't always want
[49:14] you don't win the race in the in the
[49:16] first step a race takes many steps amen
[49:18] but you've got to keep stepping you've
[49:19] got to keep moving forward
[49:21] and i wanted to start with this this
[49:23] very familiar example in exodus 23 this
[49:25] morning so if you'll
[49:26] you'll come back to verse 25 we want to
[49:28] set a bit of a tone and a context this
[49:30] morning about where we're going so
[49:32] exodus 23 25 says and ye shall serve the
[49:34] lord your god
[49:36] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[49:38] water and i will take sickness away from
[49:40] the midst of thee
[49:41] now i want you to catch something here
[49:42] because we're talking about a physical
[49:44] land for a physical people
[49:46] but we are the spiritual seed of the
[49:48] very people that are claiming the
[49:49] promise so we've got a spiritual
[49:50] heritage we've got a spiritual land
[49:52] because we are a spiritual inheritor of
[49:55] what we're talking about in the
[49:56] scripture amen
[49:57] so we do have physical manifestations of
[49:59] the blessings of god in our life
[50:01] and many said i'll never see i've never
[50:02] seen the righteous forsaken or seed
[50:04] begging bread in these different things
[50:05] we do have a physical manifestation of
[50:07] god there has to be a physical
[50:09] manifestation of god
[50:10] but not just in blessings but we're
[50:11] looking for the spiritual heritage that
[50:13] he has given us
[50:14] today amen amen we inherit a new heaven
[50:17] and a new earth
[50:18] we're not looking for mansions here
[50:19] we're not looking for great wealth here
[50:21] it's all going to be burned we're
[50:22] looking to inherit what's going to come
[50:24] after this is burned amen
[50:26] so he says here you shall serve the lord
[50:28] your god and he shall bless
[50:30] thy bread now what is our bread amen the
[50:33] bread is the word of god amen
[50:35] he says i'm gonna bless that jesus said
[50:37] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[50:39] every word that proceedeth
[50:40] out of the mouth of god so bread is
[50:42] required for day to day sustenance and
[50:44] for strength
[50:44] and he says i'm going to bless your
[50:46] bread i'm going to bless
[50:48] your word there is a specific word that
[50:50] is given for you
[50:51] there's a specific promise there's a
[50:52] specific inheritance that is given for
[50:54] you
[50:55] and i'm gonna bless that i'm not just
[50:56] gonna bless thee word but i'm gonna
[50:58] bless
[50:58] your word amen there is something that
[51:00] is for you specifically there is a
[51:02] position there's a place for you
[51:03] that is specifically for you and my word
[51:05] and i'm gonna bless
[51:06] that in your life amen is for you
[51:09] specifically
[51:10] it is thy bread is not just the bread
[51:13] but it is thy bread it's going to feed
[51:14] you it's going to grow you it's going to
[51:16] transform you it's going to sustain you
[51:18] it's going to take you to the end of
[51:19] your journey amen
[51:21] isaiah 55 11 says so shall my word be
[51:24] that goeth forth out of my mouth
[51:26] it shall not return unto me void that's
[51:29] him blessing thy
[51:30] word amen your portion he says i send my
[51:33] word for a particular
[51:35] reason and it's got to come back with
[51:37] the reason fulfilled it doesn't come
[51:38] back unfulfilled
[51:40] the strength that it sends the
[51:41] revelation that it sends the purpose it
[51:43] sends
[51:43] will accomplish that which i've sent it
[51:45] for it says but it will accomplish that
[51:47] which i please
[51:48] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[51:50] unto i sent it
[51:51] amen god doesn't send his word for just
[51:53] a nice book to read and set you to sleep
[51:55] every night he sends it for a purpose
[51:57] and it's going to achieve its purpose
[51:59] amen
[52:00] god says he will bless us with the word
[52:02] of god coming to pass in our lives he
[52:04] will take us to the place that he has
[52:05] promised us
[52:06] and in the appointed time we'll step
[52:08] into that promise and we will take an
[52:10] inheritance that he's given us amen
[52:12] this isn't when we're wandering in the
[52:13] desert this isn't when we're wondering
[52:15] are we called to be a child of god
[52:16] do we have the holy ghost no this is
[52:18] when we're in the promised land now he
[52:20] says that's when
[52:21] it's going to come that's when it won't
[52:23] return to me void it's going around and
[52:24] around and around but at the set moment
[52:26] when you're where you need to be then
[52:28] the word comes down and he's not going
[52:30] to have it thwarted or ruined by satan
[52:31] amen
[52:32] we know that healing is the children's
[52:34] bread amen jesus said when the woman
[52:36] came up to him she says i need you to
[52:38] heal my daughter he says no
[52:39] no you're not a jew that i don't give
[52:42] what bread to the dogs right and what
[52:46] was the bread it was the healing
[52:48] he said i don't give bread to the dogs
[52:50] she said yay but the dogs get the crumbs
[52:51] and he says i haven't seen faith like
[52:52] this tremendous faith
[52:54] and he gave her what she had need of
[52:55] amen it is our right
[52:57] to have healing and then brother tim
[53:00] pruitt said something very striking one
[53:01] time he said healing
[53:02] always follows the ministering of the
[53:04] word amen and i believe that followed
[53:06] jesus i believe it followed the apostles
[53:08] and i believe it follows the ministry
[53:10] even in this age amen more so in this
[53:12] age perhaps because this is the finality
[53:14] this is the fullness
[53:15] this is the fulfillment of the entire
[53:17] gentile dispensation amen
[53:20] so he didn't just say i would bless thy
[53:22] bread he says thy water
[53:25] now water is a requirement for life you
[53:27] can go without bread for a long time but
[53:29] you can't go without water for a long
[53:30] time
[53:30] but you can live off water for quite
[53:32] some time no food whatsoever if you've
[53:34] got fat stores
[53:35] depending how big you are you can live a
[53:37] really long time but even a regular
[53:38] person can live
[53:39] over six weeks on water alone amen
[53:42] but water is the answer to thirst
[53:46] amen and so he says what your thirst is
[53:48] i'm gonna bless it by giving you water
[53:50] to satisfy your thirst when the woman of
[53:52] the is at the well
[53:53] and he says i'll give you water that
[53:55] will satisfy your thirst you won't ever
[53:57] have to come here again she says i want
[53:58] that water
[53:59] he's saying here you want the water i'm
[54:01] going to give you the water i'm going to
[54:03] bless you with water that is pure that
[54:04] is clean
[54:05] that will save you that will clean you
[54:08] right this is not just any water this
[54:09] is pure water you know you don't want to
[54:11] live downstream
[54:12] from a slaughterhouse or a chemical
[54:14] factory right he says
[54:16] where i'm gonna settle you the water is
[54:18] clean there's nothing upstream
[54:19] to make it dirty but it's gonna give you
[54:21] everything that you need for life amen
[54:24] god promised he'd satisfy us with living
[54:26] water just like that woman at the well
[54:28] then he says i will take sickness away
[54:31] from the midst of thee
[54:33] now sickness is a reflection or a
[54:35] symptom of things that are out of their
[54:37] place
[54:38] or something that is not natural or
[54:40] native to the body
[54:41] coming against the body that's what
[54:43] sickness is something's out of order or
[54:45] something's in there that's not supposed
[54:46] to be in there amen
[54:48] now sickness is a symptom of a war
[54:51] symptoms sickness is a symptom of a war
[54:53] where you're fighting against something
[54:54] that's trying to take something in your
[54:56] body amen
[54:58] what does a virus do a virus takes your
[55:01] health
[55:01] your strength your energy your nutrients
[55:05] and it tries to grow itself
[55:07] at the expense of your body it's trying
[55:10] to use your body as a host to strengthen
[55:12] itself instead of letting your body do
[55:14] its natural thing which is strengthen
[55:15] and repair
[55:16] yourself and then satan's trying to do
[55:18] the same thing against us what's he
[55:20] trying to do he's trying to get you sick
[55:21] so that he can use your gifts he can use
[55:23] your mouth he can use your body he can
[55:25] use your life
[55:26] to do what grow him rather than grow the
[55:28] kingdom of god in your life amen
[55:30] but jesus or or god said to joshua
[55:34] here he said i will take sickness out of
[55:36] the midst of the amen i love how it says
[55:38] out of the midst of thee
[55:40] because what he came down and he healed
[55:42] our sin sick souls amen
[55:44] he baptizes with the holy ghost he took
[55:47] out the root cause
[55:48] that was causing all of this sickness
[55:49] all the pain all the suffering in the
[55:50] world
[55:51] and he satisfied that and he took it out
[55:53] of our life amen
[55:54] he healed our sin sick souls he took us
[55:56] out from a place of sickness and death
[55:58] and these different things
[56:01] like i said on wednesday god's
[56:02] forgiveness takes care of our sins
[56:04] they're under the blood
[56:05] and full healing is therefore available
[56:07] to every believer that comes in faith to
[56:08] him
[56:10] verse 26 says there shall nothing cast
[56:12] their young
[56:13] that means there's no miscarriages
[56:15] there's no stillbirths
[56:16] in the promised land why because what
[56:19] leads them into the promised land is the
[56:21] holy ghost amen this is the land
[56:23] of eternal life this is the place where
[56:25] the very life of god is in you and
[56:27] nothing that's born in that land
[56:29] is still born amen there's no you know
[56:32] you're born into the spirit
[56:33] and then dying off no when you're born
[56:35] there it is a true birth and it will
[56:37] hold you all the way to the day of full
[56:38] redemption amen
[56:40] it says no one will be barren unable to
[56:43] birth new life
[56:44] life begets life god begets god amen in
[56:47] this land
[56:48] gods give birth to other gods amen
[56:50] children of god give birth to other
[56:52] children of god
[56:53] in thy land and the number of thy days i
[56:55] will fulfill that means long life
[56:58] for us it means eternal life that's
[56:59] that's a really long life amen
[57:01] he says in the promised land is eternal
[57:03] life for you verse 27 i will send my
[57:06] fear before thee and will destroy
[57:08] all the people to whom thou shalt come
[57:10] and i will make all thine enemies turn
[57:11] their backs on thee
[57:13] let me put it this way sometimes we're
[57:15] worried about where about what we're
[57:17] facing or what we're going to face
[57:19] and then when they went into the
[57:20] promised land the first time 10 of the
[57:22] 12 had a problem with what they were
[57:24] facing and they turned the hearts
[57:26] of the children of israel to water and
[57:28] they turned their backs on the land and
[57:30] said we can't take it
[57:31] but he says look this time i'm going
[57:33] before you and i'm going to make them
[57:35] run away from you that's what he said
[57:37] turning your backs you don't turn your
[57:39] back on an enemy
[57:40] unless you're scared unless you're
[57:42] you're fleeing unless you're in disarray
[57:43] unless you're defeated
[57:44] and you're trying to save your life he
[57:46] says i'm gonna send my fear before you
[57:48] and destroy everyone in front of us amen
[57:51] his fear means his terror he will
[57:54] literally send a
[57:55] terror ahead of you and what did you see
[57:59] when they were going into jericho
[58:00] remember they when they talked to rahab
[58:01] and they said
[58:02] we're all scared after what happened at
[58:04] the river
[58:05] we saw you guys cross over in the middle
[58:07] of spring and now we are terrified of
[58:09] what's going to happen we're locked down
[58:11] nobody's coming in nobody's going out
[58:13] you guys
[58:14] have scared the tar out of us because
[58:17] they saw it wasn't the people it was god
[58:19] that was doing the work amen
[58:22] but we're talking spiritual now and the
[58:25] thing is
[58:26] what is god doing he sends a terror
[58:28] before you
[58:29] satan is going around like a roaring
[58:31] lion seeking whom he may devour why
[58:33] because he knows his time is short amen
[58:36] and he sent a terror to satan and
[58:37] there's demons
[58:38] and the very thing they're scared of is
[58:40] that you'll recognize who and what you
[58:42] are
[58:42] amen the very thing they're worried
[58:44] about is that you're going to get down
[58:45] on your knees
[58:46] and you're going to say lord i have a
[58:48] need and i'm believing you for it
[58:50] and then lord i'm stepping out on your
[58:52] word this morning
[58:54] right lord i'm stepping out on your word
[58:55] this week lord i'm stepping out on your
[58:57] word this year
[58:58] and i'm going to step forward no matter
[59:00] what's going on in front of me amen no
[59:01] matter what stands before me how big or
[59:03] small
[59:04] how wide how deep whatever it is i'm
[59:06] going to keep pressing forward because
[59:08] you have called me to go forward
[59:09] and i am going to go forward amen amen
[59:13] like i've said before i believe that
[59:14] just before we leave this earth
[59:16] satan will be completely powerless in
[59:18] the lives of the believers
[59:19] i don't believe there'll be a sick one
[59:20] among us there won't be an oppressed one
[59:22] there won't be a depressed one
[59:24] there won't be anything going on that
[59:25] god has not taken care of us
[59:27] we will stand knowing who we are and
[59:29] what he has given us
[59:31] and satan will have nothing that he can
[59:32] do against us amen
[59:34] amen i believe it the work's done
[59:38] the work's done we just have to take
[59:40] full possession of it amen
[59:42] verse 28 says and i will send hornets
[59:44] before thee which shall drive out the
[59:46] hivite the canaanite and the hit height
[59:48] from before thee
[59:49] but i will not drive them out from
[59:51] before thee in one year
[59:52] lest the land become desolate and the
[59:54] beasts of the field multiply against
[59:56] thee
[59:57] now i've spoken on this before and if
[59:58] they just ran through and just
[1:00:00] mowed everything down the problem was
[1:00:02] israel wasn't actually big enough to
[1:00:04] actually handle the entire land and hold
[1:00:06] it at that point
[1:00:07] right if you just go through and you
[1:00:09] knock it down and you leave a bunch of
[1:00:10] dead people there and whatnot
[1:00:11] the beasts come in the wild animals you
[1:00:14] can't hold the land there's disease
[1:00:15] there's
[1:00:16] all these different things going on you
[1:00:17] didn't want to do take over a land like
[1:00:19] that god was very strategic with this
[1:00:21] he wanted them to hold together as a
[1:00:23] group take it city by city by city
[1:00:26] and then after 10 years then it was time
[1:00:28] to go back to their initial inheritance
[1:00:30] and each one was going to take over but
[1:00:32] it was 10 years of slow work and
[1:00:34] in that time they were growing and
[1:00:36] growing this is perhaps the only time in
[1:00:38] history
[1:00:38] where an army was growing as it fought
[1:00:40] battles usually it's a war of attrition
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:43] you've got a hundred and twenty thousand
[1:00:44] they've got a hundred thousand when it's
[1:00:45] all said and done you've got twenty
[1:00:46] thousand left over and you won
[1:00:48] but israel is growing as they fight
[1:00:51] that's a beautiful thing for the bride
[1:00:53] to take heart you grow as you fight you
[1:00:55] add people you add
[1:00:56] soldiers to the army as you go and as
[1:00:59] you're going your children are going
[1:01:00] into warriors amen
[1:01:02] at the end of 10 years your kid might
[1:01:03] have only been 12 or 13 but by the end
[1:01:05] of the 10 years he was a
[1:01:07] full-blown warrior and then he had
[1:01:08] blooded himself in those battles and he
[1:01:10] had found his own victory
[1:01:12] so by the time you went to your personal
[1:01:14] portion your family was ready to fight
[1:01:16] for what was theirs as well it wasn't
[1:01:17] just a big group effort now
[1:01:19] it was now we've got a specific area for
[1:01:21] us to take and we've got grown warriors
[1:01:23] that'll handle it amen
[1:01:25] verse 30 says by little and little i
[1:01:27] will drive them out from before thee
[1:01:29] until thou be increased and inherit the
[1:01:31] land that's what we just talked about
[1:01:32] until you be increased
[1:01:33] until you're big enough to go take the
[1:01:35] rest of it and hold on to it
[1:01:37] we're going to keep fighting bit by bit
[1:01:38] amen amen
[1:01:40] now i want us to bring us to the other
[1:01:42] statement that we is again very well
[1:01:44] known in the scriptures
[1:01:45] where god was telling this as well
[1:01:46] before they ever went in where god was
[1:01:48] telling moses
[1:01:49] uh to tell the children of israel to
[1:01:51] follow and obey him and if they did that
[1:01:52] then they would be possessors of the
[1:01:53] land
[1:01:54] and it's deuteronomy 11 24 and i'll just
[1:01:56] read it since it's one scripture
[1:01:58] it says every place where on the souls
[1:02:00] of your foot shall tread
[1:02:02] shall be yours from the wilderness in
[1:02:04] lebanon from the river the river
[1:02:06] euphrates even unto the uttermost sea
[1:02:09] shall your coast be so remember we're
[1:02:11] talking about one step in the right
[1:02:12] direction and when we see
[1:02:14] a statement like what we just read
[1:02:16] everywhere that the souls of your foot
[1:02:17] shall tread will be yours
[1:02:19] that gives us a lot of that latitude for
[1:02:21] stepping doesn't it
[1:02:22] but remember he says everywhere that you
[1:02:24] step will be yours
[1:02:26] and then he puts boundaries on it
[1:02:27] doesn't he he says it's got to be
[1:02:29] between the wilderness and lebanon from
[1:02:31] the river the river euphrates
[1:02:32] even to the sea shall your coast be so
[1:02:34] he says you've got to be between the
[1:02:35] river and the sea
[1:02:37] and then you're bounded north and south
[1:02:39] but anywhere in there you can walk
[1:02:41] around in it and it's yours
[1:02:44] so all a child of god had to do was he
[1:02:45] had to look and say am i between the
[1:02:47] river euphrates and the scene between
[1:02:49] lebanon and the desert
[1:02:50] and as long as i'm there this is mine so
[1:02:52] i can just walk around and this is mine
[1:02:55] and that's mine and that's mine and
[1:02:56] that's mine and that's mine you have a
[1:02:57] happy dance because
[1:02:58] everything you're stepping on is yours
[1:03:01] as long as you were within the
[1:03:02] boundaries that god had said
[1:03:04] amen like i've said before we only walk
[1:03:07] on our property we don't go out into
[1:03:08] satan's property do we
[1:03:10] we protect our property when he comes on
[1:03:12] we kick him out
[1:03:13] he comes on again we kick him out and we
[1:03:15] know he's going to keep doing it because
[1:03:16] he's a good
[1:03:17] enemy right brother bram said say good
[1:03:19] things about everyone he says i'll say
[1:03:20] one thing about
[1:03:21] satan he's a good enemy we know he's
[1:03:23] going to keep coming
[1:03:25] so you hold your boundary you stay in
[1:03:27] your boundaries and you have full
[1:03:28] confidence as long as you're within
[1:03:30] there and as long as you're in obedience
[1:03:32] because they had to be worshipping the
[1:03:34] one true god they couldn't be out in
[1:03:35] idolatry
[1:03:36] they couldn't be serving themselves they
[1:03:37] had to be serving a living god day by
[1:03:39] day
[1:03:40] they had to be following the feasts they
[1:03:41] had to be following the law and as long
[1:03:43] as they did that he said stay in the
[1:03:44] boundaries and you'll be good to go
[1:03:47] now this is a great thing when you're in
[1:03:49] the land of milk and honey and all the
[1:03:51] giants are dead
[1:03:52] this is a great thing to look back on
[1:03:54] but when you're standing there
[1:03:56] and nobody has actually set foot in the
[1:03:58] land yet
[1:03:59] this is a whole different kettle of fish
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:02] it's one thing to say everywhere that
[1:04:04] the souls your foot shall tread will be
[1:04:05] yours but when you're not even in the
[1:04:07] land yet
[1:04:08] that's a whole different animal isn't it
[1:04:10] because somebody's got to be the first
[1:04:11] one to step
[1:04:12] into the land somebody's got to go in
[1:04:14] there and actually start stepping and
[1:04:15] proving
[1:04:16] this land is ours it's just a promise to
[1:04:19] that point and this is way before
[1:04:20] joshua's given the leadership
[1:04:22] it's under moses and they've got this
[1:04:24] promise hanging around for 40 years
[1:04:26] while they wander in the desert and now
[1:04:27] they're coming up
[1:04:29] and he says okay now is the time to
[1:04:32] prove this promise
[1:04:34] so turn to joshua 3 if you will
[1:04:38] because the big question was the promise
[1:04:40] was there but who was going to take the
[1:04:41] first step
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:45] and we see a beautiful type in here as
[1:04:47] you're turning i want to read one quote
[1:04:50] in adoption brother braham said we have
[1:04:52] been promised the holy spirit since the
[1:04:53] beginning
[1:04:54] and jesus led us up to the promise moses
[1:04:56] was the type of christ he said
[1:04:58] but the holy spirit came as joshua to
[1:05:01] take over and lead
[1:05:02] and direct to possess the land or
[1:05:05] possess the church
[1:05:07] so joshua is a type of the holy spirit
[1:05:09] moses was a type of christ he said
[1:05:12] so we preached on this before us joshua
[1:05:13] being a type of the holy spirit in these
[1:05:14] different things
[1:05:16] but i want to just now take this as we
[1:05:17] go in joshua 3 and we're going to start
[1:05:19] at verse 1.
[1:05:20] i want you to keep this in the back your
[1:05:21] head joshua is the holy spirit
[1:05:24] because this is a physical thing but
[1:05:26] we're going to take it into the
[1:05:27] spiritual
[1:05:27] so every time we read joshua we want to
[1:05:29] read holy spirit in our head okay
[1:05:32] joshua 3 verse 1 says and joshua arose
[1:05:34] early in the morning
[1:05:36] and they removed from shittum and came
[1:05:37] to jordan he and all the children of
[1:05:39] israel
[1:05:40] and lodged there before they passed over
[1:05:42] so they come right up to jordan
[1:05:43] now this is in the middle of the spring
[1:05:46] this is when the jordan is flowing its
[1:05:47] deepest and its fastest
[1:05:49] this is when the water is the roughest
[1:05:51] and it's the highest that it can be
[1:05:53] okay so they're sitting there
[1:05:58] it says and it came to pass after three
[1:06:00] days that the officers
[1:06:02] went through the host and they commanded
[1:06:04] the people saying when you see the ark
[1:06:05] of the covenant of the lord your god
[1:06:07] and the priests the levites bearing it
[1:06:09] then ye shall remove from your place and
[1:06:11] go after it
[1:06:12] so what they're saying is the holy
[1:06:14] spirit if i can put it this way the holy
[1:06:15] spirit sends out
[1:06:17] a notice and it says when you see the
[1:06:19] ministry carrying the word forward
[1:06:21] follow them wherever they go don't stay
[1:06:24] where you are
[1:06:25] follow them no matter where they go okay
[1:06:28] when you see the word moving
[1:06:30] follow the word you're not following the
[1:06:32] men you're following the word but
[1:06:33] there's men carrying the word if i could
[1:06:34] correct it that way amen
[1:06:35] we're not following men we're following
[1:06:37] the word but it says when you see the
[1:06:38] word going
[1:06:39] there's people carrying it follow those
[1:06:40] people amen
[1:06:43] we talked about john the baptist last
[1:06:44] time and he was pointing to something
[1:06:46] and what was he was a messenger saying
[1:06:47] the word's going to start moving here
[1:06:49] pretty quick when it moves make sure you
[1:06:51] move with it amen
[1:06:53] verse 4 says yet there shall be a space
[1:06:55] between you and it about 2 000 cubits by
[1:06:58] measure
[1:06:59] not come come not near it that ye may
[1:07:02] know the way by which he must go for ye
[1:07:03] have not passed this way
[1:07:05] heretofore so in other words let those
[1:07:07] men lead the way
[1:07:09] let the word lead the way don't get
[1:07:10] ahead of it stay behind it and give a
[1:07:13] space
[1:07:13] for it because you don't know the way
[1:07:16] but they do they've got to figure it out
[1:07:21] and then you follow when you see that
[1:07:22] it's safe to follow them amen
[1:07:24] let me put it this way they have orders
[1:07:26] that you don't
[1:07:28] they have orders that you don't the
[1:07:30] ministry is set aside for a specific
[1:07:32] thing and that is to lead the people
[1:07:33] we've got a five-fold ministry for that
[1:07:35] is for the unifying of the people for
[1:07:37] the perfecting of the saints amen
[1:07:38] they've got orders that the people don't
[1:07:40] get but
[1:07:42] come and hear it and listen to it and
[1:07:44] follow after them amen
[1:07:45] again we're following the word we're not
[1:07:47] following people
[1:07:49] verse 5 says and joshua said unto the
[1:07:51] people sanctify yourselves
[1:07:53] for tomorrow the lord will do wonders
[1:07:55] among you
[1:07:56] sanctify yourself he's saying prepare
[1:07:58] yourself clean yourself up
[1:08:00] this is not a day to be dirty and this
[1:08:02] is a day to get the sin out of your life
[1:08:04] this is a day to set aside
[1:08:05] consecrate yourself don't do anything
[1:08:07] that would hinder the moving of god
[1:08:09] tomorrow
[1:08:10] and then that's pretty much everything
[1:08:12] but you see what he's doing is he's
[1:08:13] setting the expectation for what's
[1:08:15] coming
[1:08:17] right the holy spirit is joshua's saying
[1:08:19] this the holy spirit is setting the
[1:08:21] expectation
[1:08:22] he sets an atmosphere and then he tells
[1:08:24] the people to prepare for what's going
[1:08:25] to happen
[1:08:26] amen there's a preparation that goes
[1:08:28] before the moving of the word
[1:08:31] then the next day joshua starts moving
[1:08:33] and what does he say verse 6
[1:08:35] joshua spake unto the priest saying take
[1:08:38] up the ark of the covenant
[1:08:39] and pass over before the people and they
[1:08:42] took up the ark of the covenant and went
[1:08:43] before the people
[1:08:44] and then so the holy spirit tells the
[1:08:46] ministry pick up the word and move
[1:08:48] forward
[1:08:51] he doesn't tell him to stop he tells
[1:08:52] them just move and keep moving
[1:08:54] and keep moving and keep moving and like
[1:08:56] i said the jordan is at maximum depth
[1:08:58] here
[1:08:59] maximum height if we want to put that
[1:09:00] way it's the roughest it is
[1:09:02] all year round and he's telling them
[1:09:04] move
[1:09:05] toward the river move towards death
[1:09:08] is what he's telling them move towards
[1:09:10] death and he doesn't tell him to stop
[1:09:11] you
[1:09:12] he just says pick up the word and keep
[1:09:13] going amen
[1:09:16] but i want you to catch something here
[1:09:18] they're told to move forward to certain
[1:09:19] death
[1:09:20] and they may not actually hear the whole
[1:09:22] story because they're moving away from
[1:09:24] the people where joshua's talking but he
[1:09:26] tells them to move no matter what
[1:09:29] verse 7 then the lord said unto joshua
[1:09:31] this day will i begin to magnify thee in
[1:09:33] the sight of all israel that they may
[1:09:35] know that
[1:09:36] as i was with moses so i will be with
[1:09:39] thee
[1:09:39] and thou shalt command the priests that
[1:09:41] bear the ark of the covenant saying when
[1:09:42] ye are come to the brink of the water of
[1:09:44] jordan
[1:09:45] ye shall stand still in jordan. so he's
[1:09:47] told them you've got to walk into the
[1:09:48] river
[1:09:50] you don't get to stop at the edge he
[1:09:52] says you have to get your feet wet
[1:09:54] you've got to step
[1:09:55] into the raging roaring river of jordan
[1:09:59] that's your orders pick up the word and
[1:10:01] step out
[1:10:04] now they didn't get a chance to go up
[1:10:06] and down the bank
[1:10:08] looking for the best spot because
[1:10:11] they've only got orders this morning
[1:10:13] and he says go pick it up and do this
[1:10:14] they don't have all this time for
[1:10:16] preparation
[1:10:17] they've just got to literally walk step
[1:10:19] off the edge
[1:10:20] of the bank into the water and whatever
[1:10:22] happens happens
[1:10:25] and then joshua said unto the children
[1:10:27] of israel verse 9
[1:10:29] come hither and hear the words of the
[1:10:30] lord your god
[1:10:32] and joshua said hereby ye shall know
[1:10:35] that the living god is among you
[1:10:37] and that he will without fail drive out
[1:10:40] them
[1:10:41] before you the canaanites the hittites
[1:10:43] the hivites the parasites the
[1:10:44] gergeshites the amorites
[1:10:45] and the jebusites so this is all about
[1:10:49] confirming to them
[1:10:50] one that joshua is going to lead them
[1:10:52] that god is with him as he was with
[1:10:54] moses
[1:10:55] and two that without fail god will give
[1:10:58] them the promised land
[1:10:59] this is his first great miracle to show
[1:11:02] them god's not dead
[1:11:04] this is his first great miracle to show
[1:11:05] them that just because moses is gone
[1:11:07] doesn't mean god has left you amen i've
[1:11:09] got another man on the scene i've got
[1:11:11] another one on the scene
[1:11:12] that will follow me and i'll bring great
[1:11:13] victory through him and you can trust
[1:11:15] him to lead you
[1:11:16] all the way through this amen this is a
[1:11:17] first fruits miracle
[1:11:19] this is the first fruits miracle for
[1:11:20] joshua isn't it to prove his ministry
[1:11:24] and to prove to the people that god is
[1:11:25] with them
[1:11:27] verse 11 behold the ark of the covenant
[1:11:29] of the lord
[1:11:30] of all the earth passes before you to
[1:11:32] jordan
[1:11:33] now therefore take you 12 men out of the
[1:11:35] tribes of israel
[1:11:36] out of every tribe of man he says look
[1:11:38] every tribe every family is going to
[1:11:40] have a witness to what's going to happen
[1:11:41] here
[1:11:42] you've got 2 million people sitting
[1:11:43] there perhaps i don't know how many went
[1:11:45] over by that point
[1:11:46] but you've got a lot of people standing
[1:11:48] there and they're watching
[1:11:49] the ministry carry the word forward to
[1:11:52] the river
[1:11:53] he says bring one from every tribe up
[1:11:55] here i want them up front to see what's
[1:11:56] going to happen here
[1:11:57] because people are going to have
[1:11:58] questions what happened what happened
[1:12:00] and he says i want to have a witness in
[1:12:02] every single one of these tribes
[1:12:04] right they're not carrying the word but
[1:12:06] they're going to witness the word moving
[1:12:07] forward amen
[1:12:09] verse 13 says and it shall come to pass
[1:12:11] as soon as the souls of the feet of the
[1:12:13] priests that bear the ark of the lord
[1:12:15] the lord of all the earth shall rest in
[1:12:17] the waters of jordan
[1:12:18] that the waters of jordan shall be cut
[1:12:20] off from the waters that come down from
[1:12:22] above
[1:12:22] and they shall stand upon and heap
[1:12:27] so he says as soon as they step in there
[1:12:30] all of them all of them
[1:12:34] the feet of the priests plural you've
[1:12:37] got a bunch of them have to keep walking
[1:12:39] guys at the front have the tough job
[1:12:40] don't they
[1:12:42] they've got to go deepest amen
[1:12:47] the holy spirit's telling the ministry
[1:12:48] you got to keep walking till your feet
[1:12:50] are wet
[1:12:51] you got to put your life on the line you
[1:12:53] got to put your reputation on the line
[1:12:55] you've got to put yourself where the
[1:12:57] word is calling you to go where the lord
[1:12:59] is telling you to go
[1:13:00] you've got to go and you trust that when
[1:13:03] you step
[1:13:04] he'll do what he said he was going to do
[1:13:06] amen amen
[1:13:08] now these these priests they have a
[1:13:09] choice don't they
[1:13:11] you can walk or you can stop
[1:13:15] you can take the step in you can walk
[1:13:17] right up to jordan
[1:13:18] the water's flowing right here you can
[1:13:20] walk right up to there
[1:13:22] but will you take that one step here
[1:13:23] because everyone can walk to here
[1:13:26] it doesn't take courage to walk to here
[1:13:28] takes courage to step here
[1:13:30] amen this is not the one step that we're
[1:13:33] talking about
[1:13:34] this is the one step because you don't
[1:13:36] know if it drops off
[1:13:37] you don't know if a tree is going to
[1:13:38] come down and wipe you out you don't
[1:13:40] know what's going to happen when you
[1:13:41] step in there
[1:13:42] all you know is it's safe to hear but
[1:13:44] you've got to make a decision am i going
[1:13:46] to take that step into the water amen
[1:13:48] am i going to believe that that water is
[1:13:50] going to roll back like he said
[1:13:51] joshua said as soon as the soles of
[1:13:53] their feet hit the water
[1:13:55] the waters will roll back never happened
[1:13:58] and it's the worst
[1:14:00] time of the year to cross the jordan
[1:14:03] is it going to happen he says right
[1:14:06] i can i can guarantee you there was an
[1:14:09] intellectual battle going on
[1:14:11] as they were walking toward because
[1:14:13] guess what you didn't get
[1:14:15] to choose who carried the ark they were
[1:14:17] a set group of men
[1:14:19] they were hand-picked to carry the ark
[1:14:20] of the lord it wasn't like today bob
[1:14:22] does it and then tomorrow mark does it
[1:14:24] no it was the same group of 12
[1:14:25] carried that arc okay they were chosen
[1:14:28] they didn't have a choice
[1:14:29] carry or no carry they carried the ark
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:33] so now they've got to come out and
[1:14:34] they're walking and they're stepping bit
[1:14:37] by bit by bit and every step
[1:14:41] they're saying is that water going to
[1:14:43] roll back when i touch it is that water
[1:14:44] going to roll back and i touch it
[1:14:46] there's a battle there isn't there is
[1:14:48] god going to be as real as he was with
[1:14:49] moses
[1:14:51] is god still with us is god still alive
[1:14:55] was this all just a fairy tale or is he
[1:14:58] going to come out and do another miracle
[1:14:59] again amen
[1:15:01] they had to bring their intellect into
[1:15:03] submission to the promise of god to the
[1:15:05] word of god
[1:15:06] to the order of god amen they had to
[1:15:08] step into the water the supernatural
[1:15:10] would not happen until they took one
[1:15:12] step
[1:15:13] into the water they had to put it all on
[1:15:16] the line
[1:15:17] think about this if they step into that
[1:15:19] water
[1:15:20] and they lose their footing what happens
[1:15:21] to the ark of the lord
[1:15:24] gone the one thing that they value most
[1:15:28] the word of the lord if they stumble and
[1:15:30] fall if that water sweeps them away the
[1:15:32] whole thing's gone
[1:15:34] and they're never getting it back
[1:15:36] everything they want
[1:15:38] to have in their midst is going to be
[1:15:40] lost if god doesn't do a miracle
[1:15:43] amen brother braham said this in the
[1:15:46] message the prisoner he says there you
[1:15:48] are
[1:15:48] you've only got one thing to do the
[1:15:51] first step tonight
[1:15:52] surrender become a prisoner
[1:15:56] don't think of yourself for something
[1:15:57] else become a prisoner
[1:15:59] moses became a prisoner confessed he
[1:16:02] couldn't
[1:16:02] even talk finally when god got him in
[1:16:06] his hand where he could
[1:16:07] only move where god moved him where he
[1:16:09] told him the word
[1:16:10] he noted was the word that he submitted
[1:16:12] himself to the word
[1:16:13] and the holy spirit there god harnessed
[1:16:16] moses
[1:16:17] to the will of god so the first step was
[1:16:19] surrender
[1:16:20] those priests had to surrender
[1:16:22] themselves to the idea that i'm going
[1:16:23] into that water
[1:16:24] no matter what i will step into
[1:16:28] the water they had to commit themselves
[1:16:30] to it they had to say
[1:16:32] the only way we're going to cross is if
[1:16:34] i step into the water
[1:16:35] i've got to lead the way amen
[1:16:39] those men had to make that one step in
[1:16:41] the right direction they didn't get a
[1:16:43] chance to go around like i said
[1:16:44] looking for the best way across they had
[1:16:46] to trust that the way was there and when
[1:16:48] they stepped the way would come
[1:16:50] clear that the waters would part for
[1:16:52] them amen
[1:16:53] if they refused to step in god could not
[1:16:55] move
[1:16:57] i want to say that again if they refused
[1:16:59] to step in god
[1:17:00] could not move they had to obey they had
[1:17:04] to step out in obedience
[1:17:05] they had to step out in faith and only
[1:17:07] then could god make a move only then
[1:17:09] could the supernatural happen
[1:17:11] was when they allowed a supernatural
[1:17:14] need to have to come there
[1:17:17] right they had to give the opportunity
[1:17:19] for the supernatural by stepping into a
[1:17:20] place where only the supernatural could
[1:17:22] help them
[1:17:23] amen if they were going to make it
[1:17:26] across
[1:17:27] if the ark was going to be held and not
[1:17:29] lost the only way they were going to do
[1:17:31] it in obedience was if god came on the
[1:17:32] scene amen
[1:17:35] the message zacchaeus the businessman
[1:17:36] it's a beautiful quote brother brown
[1:17:38] says you know really
[1:17:40] the first step is just a little
[1:17:43] out of our reach we have to accept it
[1:17:46] by faith yeah it's just a little more
[1:17:49] than the human mind can explain
[1:17:51] you can't explain god if you do then
[1:17:53] he's no more accepted by faith
[1:17:55] you have to believe him he that cometh
[1:17:57] to god must believe that he is and a
[1:17:59] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:18:01] after him
[1:18:02] he says strange how god gets men to do
[1:18:05] things ridiculous
[1:18:07] so but you know if you're determined you
[1:18:09] want to see jesus
[1:18:11] you'll do things ridiculous if you're
[1:18:14] determined
[1:18:16] if you want to if you're really sincere
[1:18:19] if you want to really know what it's all
[1:18:21] about
[1:18:23] and then ministry is not just preaching
[1:18:26] ministry is obedience to the holy spirit
[1:18:28] ministry is leading the way
[1:18:30] when others fall back when others lack
[1:18:32] the courage to do it amen
[1:18:33] it's walking in faith trusting that god
[1:18:35] has a provided way
[1:18:36] for what you are bringing to the people
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:41] we've got to be able to put ourselves
[1:18:42] into perceived danger when he says
[1:18:45] step forward you got to put your
[1:18:47] reputation on the line you got to put
[1:18:48] your life you got to put your testimony
[1:18:50] on the line
[1:18:50] and trust that if god has called you he
[1:18:52] will back up what he has called you to
[1:18:54] do amen
[1:18:55] amen like i said everyone comes out and
[1:18:58] they're looking at these priests
[1:19:00] and they're walking slowly towards the
[1:19:02] water carefully
[1:19:03] walking towards that water amen but i
[1:19:06] want you to put yourselves in the
[1:19:07] sandals of those priests as they're
[1:19:08] walking towards that water
[1:19:10] and they see that that water is raging
[1:19:12] and they're getting closer and nothing's
[1:19:14] happening
[1:19:15] now remember the red sea what happened
[1:19:17] the waters parted and then they went in
[1:19:20] okay this is not the same thing this is
[1:19:24] step in and the waters will roll back
[1:19:26] and then like the song not by my not by
[1:19:28] power but by my spirit right
[1:19:30] step in the waters will roll back it
[1:19:32] wasn't the waters will roll back and
[1:19:33] step in now it's step
[1:19:34] in the waters will roll back and they're
[1:19:36] getting closer and nothing
[1:19:38] is happening in fact i can pretty much
[1:19:40] guarantee that the water probably got
[1:19:41] worse
[1:19:43] because that's the way god does it
[1:19:44] doesn't he he tests your faith he riles
[1:19:46] things up so that you say
[1:19:48] i'm crazy person if i do this amen
[1:19:52] they have to put their lives on the line
[1:19:54] for this one verse 14 says and it came
[1:19:56] to pass
[1:19:57] when the people removed from their tents
[1:19:59] to pass over jordan and the priests
[1:20:00] bearing the ark of the covenant before
[1:20:01] the people
[1:20:02] and as they bear the ark were coming to
[1:20:05] the jordan
[1:20:06] and the feet of the priests that bear
[1:20:08] the ark were dipped in the brim
[1:20:10] of the water for jordan overfloweth all
[1:20:14] his banks all the time of the harvest
[1:20:17] it says that the waters which came down
[1:20:19] from above
[1:20:20] stood and rose up upon a heap very far
[1:20:23] from the city adam
[1:20:25] that is beside zeratin and those that
[1:20:27] came down toward the sea
[1:20:29] of the plain even the salt sea failed
[1:20:31] and were cut off
[1:20:32] and the people passed over right against
[1:20:36] jericho what a site that must have been
[1:20:38] they step in
[1:20:39] and the waters roll back and they don't
[1:20:41] just roll back to the bottom because
[1:20:43] that's
[1:20:43] you know that's what you'd expect the
[1:20:44] waters just go there but it says it
[1:20:46] backed it all the way up to the city of
[1:20:48] adam that's 29 kilometers away the water
[1:20:50] backed up
[1:20:52] it held steady and it just built up in a
[1:20:54] wall
[1:20:55] kind of like there was an invisible dam
[1:20:56] there and it built up
[1:20:58] for 29 kilometers back that's how long
[1:21:00] it took them to cross over
[1:21:02] built up 29 kilometers of water behind
[1:21:04] them in a big dan
[1:21:06] while they crossed over amen
[1:21:11] verse 17 says and the priests that bear
[1:21:13] the ark of the covenant of the lord
[1:21:15] stood firm on dry ground in the midst of
[1:21:18] jordan
[1:21:18] he didn't just part back the waters he
[1:21:20] made it so they could pass through him
[1:21:22] and it wasn't muddy
[1:21:23] wasn't soft it wasn't covered in debris
[1:21:25] so they couldn't cross
[1:21:26] it was dry ground and they could all
[1:21:28] pass over there was a way made where he
[1:21:30] told them there was going to be a way
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:32] and all the israelites passed over on
[1:21:34] dry ground until all the people
[1:21:36] were passed clean over jordans so that
[1:21:39] entire time
[1:21:40] those priests stood in the middle of the
[1:21:43] river
[1:21:43] because they kept walking to the middle
[1:21:45] they stood in the middle of the river
[1:21:47] and they held the word until everyone
[1:21:49] had crossed over to the other side
[1:21:52] you've got to stand there and you see
[1:21:54] the water building up
[1:21:56] so god's given you a miracle but now you
[1:21:58] see
[1:21:59] destruction standing there the entire
[1:22:02] time and it's getting worse and worse
[1:22:03] the longer you stay the worse the
[1:22:05] potential destruction is
[1:22:07] but they stand firm holding the word
[1:22:09] until everybody gets across
[1:22:11] and is safe on the other side every dog
[1:22:14] every cow
[1:22:15] every donkey every mom dad child
[1:22:18] every single one tense possessions
[1:22:20] everything crossed over
[1:22:22] and they're standing there watching that
[1:22:24] wall of water
[1:22:25] build up in front of them and trusting
[1:22:27] the power of the word that put them in
[1:22:29] that position
[1:22:30] to hold it until they could get to the
[1:22:32] other side amen
[1:22:36] amen i want to do a quick summary of
[1:22:39] what we've just gone through amen so we
[1:22:40] can have
[1:22:41] confidence in our leadership so we can
[1:22:44] have confidence in where we're standing
[1:22:45] and what we're claiming and what we're
[1:22:46] looking to in the word amen
[1:22:48] i want to because there's a cycle that
[1:22:50] happens here and the first thing is that
[1:22:51] the holy spirit had to lead
[1:22:53] and then god comes down but he's typed
[1:22:55] in joshua and joshua is giving the
[1:22:57] orders
[1:22:57] the holy spirit is the one that's giving
[1:23:00] the orders and the israelites did not
[1:23:01] move
[1:23:02] until joshua told them to amen the
[1:23:04] believer does not move until the holy
[1:23:06] spirit tells you to move amen
[1:23:08] now i can imagine there's some angst
[1:23:09] there because they're sitting on the
[1:23:11] banks of the jordan
[1:23:12] and first thing that's rolling your in
[1:23:14] your head is
[1:23:15] why are we crossing in the spring this
[1:23:17] is the worst time for it and then
[1:23:20] they're
[1:23:20] waiting and they're seeing the river get
[1:23:22] higher and higher and worse and worse
[1:23:24] and the angst is building up because
[1:23:26] it's saying we didn't have much of a
[1:23:27] chance to cross in the first time
[1:23:29] place but now it's worse than it ever
[1:23:31] was and now what are we supposed to do
[1:23:34] where is joshua leading us this guy
[1:23:37] couldn't fight his way out of a paper
[1:23:38] bag this guy does not have any project
[1:23:40] management skills
[1:23:41] he is not looking at what we're facing
[1:23:43] here today right
[1:23:45] why are we sitting against the river
[1:23:46] that's impossible and it's getting worse
[1:23:48] and we're not moving amen
[1:23:50] but sometimes we know that god gets
[1:23:52] things and lets them get worse
[1:23:54] why so we can fully know that it is god
[1:23:57] that made us get through it
[1:23:58] and not our own skills our own intellect
[1:24:00] our own ideas our own thoughts our own
[1:24:02] strength
[1:24:03] right even our own leadership he lets it
[1:24:06] get to the place where it takes the
[1:24:07] supernatural to move forward
[1:24:09] and we'll recognize then that god is in
[1:24:11] it and not only that god is in it but
[1:24:13] that god is with us and he has ordained
[1:24:15] it
[1:24:15] and that's why we get to go through
[1:24:17] something like this is because he has
[1:24:18] ordained it
[1:24:19] and he's made a way through it amen god
[1:24:21] does all things well and sometimes it
[1:24:23] takes chaos
[1:24:24] to teach us that god is with us that he
[1:24:27] can make peace out of a storm that he
[1:24:28] can make a way through the river
[1:24:30] when it's at its deepest amen
[1:24:33] said this he says look at it this way
[1:24:35] all too many read the bible where it
[1:24:37] says in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized
[1:24:39] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:24:40] christ for the remission of sins
[1:24:42] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:24:44] holy ghost and just pass right on
[1:24:46] they don't see it if they saw it now
[1:24:48] listen to this he says
[1:24:49] if they saw it by getting in the spirit
[1:24:52] they would know that if they want to
[1:24:54] receive the holy spirit they need to
[1:24:55] repent
[1:24:56] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:24:58] jesus and then god would be duty bound
[1:25:00] to fulfill his word by filling them with
[1:25:02] the holy ghost
[1:25:04] they never get in his spirit or it would
[1:25:07] happen to them exactly as the word says
[1:25:09] he's talking about getting in the spirit
[1:25:11] we've got to be led by the holy spirit
[1:25:13] he says you've got to get in the spirit
[1:25:14] pray to god for a revelation by his
[1:25:17] spirit that's the first step
[1:25:18] get in the spirit he says let me just
[1:25:20] use another illustration suppose you
[1:25:22] need healing
[1:25:23] what does the word say well we have read
[1:25:25] it countless times but
[1:25:26] did not get in the spirit when reading
[1:25:28] it
[1:25:29] he says did we ask god for his spirit to
[1:25:31] teach us the real truth of it
[1:25:33] if we did we would call the elders
[1:25:34] confess our sins be anointed and prayed
[1:25:36] for
[1:25:37] and that would be that now that's not
[1:25:39] the only way
[1:25:40] right we've got people believing for
[1:25:42] healing in this church and they didn't
[1:25:44] come up and get prayed for it
[1:25:45] because there is another way and that is
[1:25:46] the way of the centurion of great faith
[1:25:48] and what not right
[1:25:49] so this is not to put anyone down that
[1:25:51] has not done this that's looking for
[1:25:52] healing
[1:25:53] but he says this is the primary way
[1:25:55] right
[1:25:56] because not everybody has faith to just
[1:25:57] walk like that
[1:25:59] but for the ones that do praise the lord
[1:26:01] but he says for those that don't
[1:26:02] come this way because there's a way laid
[1:26:04] out he says
[1:26:06] he says it might not so he says we would
[1:26:09] call the elders confess our sins be
[1:26:10] anointed and pray for and that would be
[1:26:12] that
[1:26:13] it might not come immediately but in his
[1:26:16] spirit
[1:26:16] it's all over there's no other court of
[1:26:19] appeal
[1:26:20] god will fulfill his word he says all we
[1:26:23] need to get in the spirit
[1:26:24] and then things will be done don't go
[1:26:27] through the
[1:26:28] acts first get in the spirit and then go
[1:26:31] through the acts
[1:26:32] and watch what god will do amen we see
[1:26:34] the word sitting there and we say okay
[1:26:36] do it boom boom boom boom boom
[1:26:38] he says no get in the spirit so you'll
[1:26:40] know which portion is for you now
[1:26:42] here today tomorrow he says and then do
[1:26:45] what you've been revealed to do
[1:26:47] and then watch what god will do don't
[1:26:49] just go around willy-nilly like a
[1:26:50] chicken with your head cut off
[1:26:52] right go to the portion that the holy
[1:26:54] spirit is calling for you
[1:26:55] and walk on that and walk on that and
[1:26:57] walk on that
[1:26:58] until it's yours right because that's
[1:27:00] what he has anointed for you for today
[1:27:03] leave tomorrow for tomorrow do today
[1:27:05] what he's anointed for you today amen
[1:27:07] you've got to be led of god and that is
[1:27:09] through the holy spirit for the believer
[1:27:10] amen
[1:27:12] now i want you to show something in the
[1:27:14] scriptures turn to acts 16 if you will
[1:27:16] because this can be a tricky thing
[1:27:17] and it can be a very frustrating thing
[1:27:21] i have some personal experience with
[1:27:23] frustration
[1:27:26] and this would frustrate me to no end
[1:27:29] what we're going to read about here
[1:27:30] but i want you to see the the to see how
[1:27:32] the leading of god moves
[1:27:36] when you have gifts when you have
[1:27:37] callings when you're placed somewhere
[1:27:39] and things don't seem to be happening
[1:27:41] this is a a great story
[1:27:43] for those days when you're frustrated
[1:27:44] read acts 16
[1:27:46] verse 6. this is speaking of paul of
[1:27:49] course it says now when they have gone
[1:27:51] now forgive me if i say these words
[1:27:52] wrong i'm just going to rip through them
[1:27:54] and trust that they are correct amen
[1:27:57] if anyone wants to correct me they can
[1:27:59] do so after church
[1:28:01] now when they had gone through phrygia
[1:28:03] and the region of galatia
[1:28:05] and were forbidden of the holy ghost to
[1:28:08] preach the word
[1:28:09] in asia so they're walking it's too bad
[1:28:11] we don't have
[1:28:12] the thing today because i printed out or
[1:28:14] i put a map of the of the
[1:28:16] of the travel that they're going through
[1:28:18] here and they're literally
[1:28:19] walking through asia and they aren't
[1:28:22] allowed to preach the holy spirit
[1:28:25] forbids preachers to preach
[1:28:28] okay they're preachers and god's turned
[1:28:31] them into hikers
[1:28:33] and there's nothing a preacher likes
[1:28:35] more than hiking right
[1:28:37] no a preacher he preaches that's what he
[1:28:39] wants to do the calling of god is on his
[1:28:41] life
[1:28:41] to preach and if he's not preaching he's
[1:28:43] not fulfilled and he gets frustrated
[1:28:45] right and they're walking through this
[1:28:48] is the apostle paul the prophet for the
[1:28:50] age is walking through asia
[1:28:52] and the holy spirit says you can't
[1:28:54] preach here
[1:28:56] you can't do your job here
[1:28:59] and he's got to keep walking and every
[1:29:01] day they're seeing people
[1:29:02] they're seeing situations they're seeing
[1:29:04] sick people they're seeing idolaters
[1:29:06] they're seeing people that need the
[1:29:07] gospel
[1:29:08] and the holy spirit says you cannot
[1:29:11] preach here
[1:29:15] verse 7 it says after they were come to
[1:29:17] mizea
[1:29:18] they assayed to go into bithynia but the
[1:29:20] spirit suffered them not
[1:29:22] the holy spirit says not here either so
[1:29:25] they dip into asia
[1:29:27] if you see it kind of the way it goes is
[1:29:29] i'll draw a map
[1:29:31] by memory so you kind of got the ocean
[1:29:34] here
[1:29:36] okay like this and they're they're here
[1:29:38] and you've got bithynia
[1:29:41] and you've got asia okay and they're
[1:29:44] coming through here
[1:29:46] and they're going to here and they come
[1:29:49] up in here
[1:29:50] and the holy spirit says no they're
[1:29:53] coming to hear
[1:29:54] holy spirit says no okay
[1:29:57] this is not fun in those days they
[1:29:59] didn't have a car this is not a couple
[1:30:00] hours drive
[1:30:01] this is days and weeks of no no
[1:30:05] no no no okay
[1:30:09] preacher's not preaching prophet's not
[1:30:11] prophesying healer's not healing
[1:30:13] week after week no no no
[1:30:20] let me put it this way they had a desire
[1:30:22] to do something for god
[1:30:24] and god said no and it was a godly
[1:30:26] desire
[1:30:27] it was a good desire it was a scriptural
[1:30:30] desire
[1:30:31] but the holy spirit said no
[1:30:35] just because you want to do it just
[1:30:36] because you can place it in the word
[1:30:38] does not mean
[1:30:39] today is the day amen and there's
[1:30:41] nothing more frustrating than feeling
[1:30:43] that you're supposed to be doing
[1:30:44] something and you're not doing it
[1:30:47] amen you're walking around now you would
[1:30:49] say
[1:30:50] they're doing a lot of walking here and
[1:30:52] they are 100
[1:30:53] out of the whole out of the leadership
[1:30:55] of the holy spirit because they're not
[1:30:57] doing their job
[1:30:58] and everywhere they go he's saying no no
[1:31:01] no no no
[1:31:02] and you'd say brothers what are you
[1:31:04] doing
[1:31:06] you're not doing your job you obviously
[1:31:08] miss the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:31:09] here
[1:31:10] they were led to go here but when they
[1:31:13] get there he says don't do anything amen
[1:31:16] verse 8 says and they passing by isaiah
[1:31:19] came down to troas
[1:31:21] and a vision appeared to paul in the
[1:31:22] night there stood a man of macedonia and
[1:31:25] prayed him saying
[1:31:26] come over to macedonia and help us
[1:31:29] and after he had seen the vision
[1:31:31] immediately we endeavored to go into
[1:31:33] macedonia
[1:31:34] assuredly gathering that the lord had
[1:31:36] called us
[1:31:38] for to preach and gospel unto them
[1:31:41] so finally they come down
[1:31:44] to here
[1:31:48] and guess what where's macedonia
[1:31:53] big mac
[1:31:57] right where they needed to be this is
[1:31:59] the shortest
[1:32:00] and easiest distance they could have
[1:32:01] come down here but there's all these
[1:32:03] islands and things down here making it
[1:32:04] difficult to get through here
[1:32:05] this is the shortest easiest route for
[1:32:07] them to get cheapest way to get there
[1:32:09] is right here the holy spirit is telling
[1:32:11] them no no
[1:32:12] no no no no until they get to here walk
[1:32:15] and walk and walk in
[1:32:16] every day no no no and then they get to
[1:32:18] there
[1:32:19] and then he gets a vision says macedonia
[1:32:21] needs you
[1:32:22] and they're right where they need to be
[1:32:24] at the exact time they need to be there
[1:32:26] having been frustrated this entire time
[1:32:29] and then they get there and there's a
[1:32:30] macedonian call comes and they said as
[1:32:32] soon as we got the vision
[1:32:33] we said surely this is finally it right
[1:32:38] verse 11. so again we'd be looking at
[1:32:42] those men saying you guys have lost it
[1:32:44] you you've gotten ahead of yourself you
[1:32:47] think you're called to all the world to
[1:32:48] preach well obviously you're not
[1:32:50] because we've got a bunch of people here
[1:32:51] that need the gospel and you're not
[1:32:52] preaching to them and now you're saying
[1:32:54] it's the holy spirit make up your mind
[1:32:55] what are you
[1:32:57] amen verse 11 says therefore leucine
[1:33:00] from troas
[1:33:01] we came with a straight course to
[1:33:03] samuthracia
[1:33:04] and the next day to neapolis so they
[1:33:06] come right over to samuthracia then they
[1:33:08] go here
[1:33:09] and they're just working their way right
[1:33:10] to where they need to be and from thence
[1:33:12] to philippi which is the chief city of
[1:33:14] that part of macedonia in a colony
[1:33:16] and where we were in that city abiding
[1:33:18] certain days
[1:33:19] and on the sabbath we went out of the
[1:33:21] city by a riverside where prayer was
[1:33:23] want to be made
[1:33:24] and we sat down and spake unto the woman
[1:33:25] which was women
[1:33:27] which resorted there and a certain woman
[1:33:29] named lydia
[1:33:30] a seller of purple of the city of
[1:33:33] thyatira which worshipped god heard us
[1:33:36] now listen to this all of this
[1:33:38] frustration
[1:33:39] all of this long dusty walking leads
[1:33:42] them to this
[1:33:43] woman and it says whose heart the lord
[1:33:46] opened that she attended under the
[1:33:49] things which were spoken
[1:33:50] of paul and when she was baptized and
[1:33:53] her household she besotted saying
[1:33:55] if ye have judged me to be faithful to
[1:33:57] the lord come into my house and abide
[1:34:00] there
[1:34:00] and she constrained us amen so what was
[1:34:03] it
[1:34:03] god had a person prepared to receive
[1:34:07] his word and he led those men
[1:34:10] through asia through bithynia into
[1:34:12] macedonia
[1:34:13] purely to go meet the need of the one
[1:34:17] that was ready to receive the gospel for
[1:34:19] her age
[1:34:21] all of that walking all of that
[1:34:22] frustrating all of that
[1:34:24] no no no led them exactly to where they
[1:34:27] needed to be
[1:34:28] and there they sat and stayed for a
[1:34:30] while and built up a church there and
[1:34:32] and developed the believers there in
[1:34:33] these different things amen the holy
[1:34:35] spirit took them to where the people
[1:34:36] were ready for the message that they had
[1:34:39] asia was going to get their gospel
[1:34:41] bithynia was going to get their gospel
[1:34:43] but it wasn't the time yet macedonia was
[1:34:46] ready
[1:34:47] and that's where the holy spirit took
[1:34:48] them and in all of their frustration he
[1:34:50] was taking them exactly where they
[1:34:52] needed to be
[1:34:52] this nice beautiful gentle curve right
[1:34:54] to the port of troas
[1:34:56] where they could go directly straight to
[1:34:58] where they needed to be
[1:34:59] to get where the holy spirit had moved
[1:35:01] and prepared hearts
[1:35:02] for the word that they were preaching
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] and that brings me to the second point
[1:35:08] and that's that
[1:35:09] we're talking about moving in the right
[1:35:11] direction you've got to move
[1:35:13] in the right direction you can't presume
[1:35:15] that you're moving in the right
[1:35:17] direction amen
[1:35:18] what did brother brown say it meant to
[1:35:19] presume to venture
[1:35:21] without authority which is why we said
[1:35:24] you have to be led of the holy spirit
[1:35:26] because that gives you your authority
[1:35:27] and with authority now comes what
[1:35:30] the power to back up what you've been
[1:35:32] authorized to do
[1:35:34] so they have paul has full confidence
[1:35:36] now that he's where he needs to be
[1:35:38] amen so it's not enough to take a step
[1:35:41] you've got to take it in the right
[1:35:43] direction you've got to be led
[1:35:44] by the holy spirit when you're doing it
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:47] think of it this way think about the
[1:35:48] priests that were coming to jordan
[1:35:50] with the word now can you imagine if
[1:35:52] they if they put together a conclave of
[1:35:54] priests
[1:35:55] and said joshua doesn't know what he's
[1:35:57] doing the river's getting higher
[1:35:59] we need to get out there and get this
[1:36:01] thing across before it gets so high that
[1:36:02] we can't go at all
[1:36:04] can you imagine if the ministry got
[1:36:05] together and decided on a plan of attack
[1:36:07] to go into jordan
[1:36:09] and the holy spirit hasn't told them to
[1:36:10] do it what would have happened
[1:36:12] they'd have done the exact same thing
[1:36:13] that they did before but when their
[1:36:15] hit their water the water wasn't going
[1:36:17] to roll back was it exact same action
[1:36:20] wrong time amen right time right season
[1:36:24] right direction authorized to move
[1:36:27] that's what we're looking at amen
[1:36:29] amen now i keep saying ministry
[1:36:33] because it's talking about priesthood
[1:36:35] amen but when we start talking about
[1:36:36] priests
[1:36:37] it's not just ministries that stand
[1:36:38] behind the pulpit is it we've got a high
[1:36:40] priest of the home
[1:36:42] right we've got fathers we've got
[1:36:43] husbands that have to be found in the
[1:36:45] exact same line of thinking and the
[1:36:47] exact same
[1:36:48] cycle of the moving of the holy spirit
[1:36:50] as the man behind the pulpit has to
[1:36:52] amen so don't think that this is all on
[1:36:54] brother gerald and brother jonathan
[1:36:56] tonight
[1:36:57] or this morning amen this is on every
[1:37:00] man that's sitting in this congregation
[1:37:02] to say
[1:37:02] am i being led of the holy spirit and
[1:37:05] when i
[1:37:06] am led of the holy spirit am i moving
[1:37:07] when he tells me to move
[1:37:09] where he told me to move to do what he
[1:37:11] sent me to do to believe what he said to
[1:37:13] believe
[1:37:13] and if i am then i have confidence that
[1:37:15] he is going to give the power
[1:37:17] behind his word to back it up amen amen
[1:37:22] and then after that paul he gets to
[1:37:24] macedonia okay i kind of this is funny
[1:37:26] because i imagine maybe paul wasn't
[1:37:27] frustrated
[1:37:28] i may be speaking of myself that i would
[1:37:30] have been frustrated but i tend to think
[1:37:31] they would have been frustrated
[1:37:32] you're wanting to preach the gospel and
[1:37:34] you can't but paul gets to macedonia and
[1:37:36] he's walking around remember
[1:37:37] and there's that girl with a spirit
[1:37:39] remember following him she had a spirit
[1:37:40] of divination
[1:37:41] and she's following him around and she's
[1:37:44] saying these are the the servants of god
[1:37:45] that lead you
[1:37:46] you know that to lead you to eternal
[1:37:48] life and that and she follows him for
[1:37:50] days now i would tend to think me
[1:37:52] frustrated john would have turned around
[1:37:55] and boom
[1:37:56] cast her out cast that demon right out
[1:37:57] of her but it says she followed for days
[1:38:01] and he did nothing he did nothing he let
[1:38:04] her follow him around
[1:38:06] and testify to everybody with a familiar
[1:38:08] spirit with a demon on her
[1:38:10] and he did nothing about it but then it
[1:38:13] says
[1:38:14] paul was grieved right
[1:38:17] that's the holy spirit grieving that's
[1:38:19] not just paul grieving
[1:38:20] and he turns around and he casts that
[1:38:22] demon right out of her
[1:38:24] why he was waiting for the holy spirit
[1:38:27] to authorize him to do that work amen
[1:38:29] he's fully authorized to cast out demons
[1:38:31] but he's waiting for the spirit to do it
[1:38:32] because she's testifying to them
[1:38:34] and the people trust her so he let her
[1:38:37] testify for a while and then he freed
[1:38:39] her
[1:38:39] from the very thing that god had been
[1:38:40] using for a while god had allowed that
[1:38:42] demon to testify of his servants for a
[1:38:44] while
[1:38:44] they turned around he took it right out
[1:38:46] of her in an instant amen
[1:38:50] third thing so we have the leadership of
[1:38:51] the holy spirit you have the ministry
[1:38:53] moving
[1:38:54] not just behind the pulpit but the
[1:38:55] husbands and the fathers amen
[1:38:58] then after that the people have to
[1:39:00] follow the holy ghost as it moves in
[1:39:01] their particular ministry
[1:39:03] again whether it's men behind the pulpit
[1:39:05] whether it's your husband whether it's
[1:39:06] your father these different things
[1:39:08] the people have to move as the ministry
[1:39:10] moves with the word amen
[1:39:12] that's what joshua said he said as soon
[1:39:13] as you see them move he said follow out
[1:39:16] give him a bit of space let him figure
[1:39:17] out what's supposed to happen here let
[1:39:19] him figure out where to go
[1:39:20] but when they figured it out you get in
[1:39:21] behind and you follow and go right past
[1:39:23] them to the other side amen
[1:39:25] now we're not talking nicolaianism right
[1:39:28] we're not talking about follow a man
[1:39:29] blindly
[1:39:30] we're not talking about following a
[1:39:31] ministry blindly i think some of the
[1:39:33] greatest
[1:39:34] issues we've had in the message in the
[1:39:35] past 10 years have been because people
[1:39:37] followed a ministry
[1:39:38] as opposed to the holy spirit at times
[1:39:40] they gave no allowance for a failure of
[1:39:41] a man amen
[1:39:43] right paul said in corinthians first
[1:39:45] corinthians 11 1 said be ye followers of
[1:39:48] me
[1:39:49] even as i also am of christ
[1:39:53] that's how we follow amen is as they
[1:39:56] follow christ we have confidence to
[1:39:57] follow them each one
[1:39:58] because what the ministry is going to
[1:40:00] take us into higher heights deeper
[1:40:02] depths of the word
[1:40:03] and you've got to be able to trust that
[1:40:04] the holy spirit is moving
[1:40:06] and you'll see him moving in those men
[1:40:09] in your husbands in your father's
[1:40:11] that he's going to take you to a greater
[1:40:13] place of revelation a greater place of
[1:40:15] reality
[1:40:16] a greater place of healing a greater
[1:40:17] place of resolution
[1:40:19] amen all of these things they're going
[1:40:20] to take it as brother gerald loves to
[1:40:21] say
[1:40:22] put it in the people's lap all right
[1:40:26] fathers husbands we've got to put it in
[1:40:28] our family's lap but we've got to lead
[1:40:30] the way
[1:40:30] we don't just give it we've got to lead
[1:40:32] that's how we put it in their lap as we
[1:40:33] lead
[1:40:34] and then we give them the opportunity to
[1:40:35] follow behind amen
[1:40:39] and then the fourth part is now you've
[1:40:40] got to start walking
[1:40:42] you've got to start walking on your own
[1:40:44] land amen once you're in the promised
[1:40:46] land
[1:40:47] you've got a particular portion that's
[1:40:48] there just for you joshua
[1:40:50] held the people together for 10 years
[1:40:52] but after 10 years he dispersed them and
[1:40:53] said now go and take your place
[1:40:55] and every one of us has a different
[1:40:57] place of battle amen we've got different
[1:40:59] things we're fighting the tribes were
[1:41:00] all spread out
[1:41:01] throughout is the land of canaan and
[1:41:03] every one of them face different
[1:41:04] technologies they face different terrain
[1:41:07] right they face people that had
[1:41:08] different technology different weapons
[1:41:10] different styles of warfare
[1:41:12] and every one of them had to fight based
[1:41:14] on what they were facing
[1:41:16] right i don't face the same battle that
[1:41:18] you face because i'm fighting
[1:41:20] in a different part of land it's all
[1:41:21] part of the promised land but my battle
[1:41:23] is not always the same as yours
[1:41:25] so we've all got to be able to adapt
[1:41:27] we've all got to be able to have
[1:41:28] leadership
[1:41:29] for how to defeat the enemy in our lives
[1:41:31] right we've all got particular
[1:41:33] scriptures we've all got particular
[1:41:34] methods we've got a way of praying we've
[1:41:36] got a way of seeking god
[1:41:37] some people fast some people just pray
[1:41:40] some people turn on a tape and listen to
[1:41:42] it some people go out in the wilderness
[1:41:45] right we don't all fight the same way
[1:41:47] but we've got to be led of the holy
[1:41:48] spirit
[1:41:49] on what is our land how to take it and
[1:41:51] once we've got it how to hold on to it
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:54] it's got to go beyond the ministry
[1:41:55] that's for sure it can't just stay in a
[1:41:57] man behind a pope but it can't just stay
[1:41:58] in mommy and daddy
[1:41:59] can't just stay in papa amen it's got to
[1:42:02] go into
[1:42:03] every single member of the family amen
[1:42:08] now that's going to get pretty daunting
[1:42:09] at times isn't it we face some pretty
[1:42:12] big things haven't we brother bob
[1:42:13] cancer right
[1:42:17] i've faced it in my family not
[1:42:18] personally you face cancer
[1:42:22] we'll see if you believe everywhere that
[1:42:24] the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:42:26] right these different things that we
[1:42:28] faced before brother chad
[1:42:31] how many babies did it take brother keep
[1:42:34] pressing
[1:42:35] that's a different battle i've never
[1:42:36] struggled to have children
[1:42:39] right but sometimes there's a battle you
[1:42:42] gotta fight because he's doing what
[1:42:44] he's showing you that you've got an
[1:42:45] inheritance but it is a battle
[1:42:48] and you gotta keep moving and you gotta
[1:42:50] keep stepping and you gotta know
[1:42:51] you've gotta know that he's the one
[1:42:53] that's leading and guiding you in that
[1:42:55] i mean you've got to have a personal a
[1:42:57] personal
[1:42:58] conviction that this is him leading you
[1:43:02] and in that you'll be able to face
[1:43:04] whatever you're going
[1:43:05] through amen we've got to dwell
[1:43:09] brother brahm said you've got to get in
[1:43:10] the spirit
[1:43:12] and that is not just a great song
[1:43:13] service
[1:43:15] not even close not even close
[1:43:19] you've got to get alone with god you've
[1:43:22] got to settle down you've got to be
[1:43:23] quiet
[1:43:24] and you've got to seek him with all your
[1:43:26] heart with all your soul and say lord i
[1:43:28] need you here amen
[1:43:29] the first step is always the hardest
[1:43:31] though isn't it right because the first
[1:43:33] thing remember we read that quote
[1:43:34] brother brownie says
[1:43:35] you have to surrender the first step is
[1:43:38] surrender
[1:43:38] and surrender means i have no strength i
[1:43:41] have no
[1:43:42] input i have no thoughts and i have no
[1:43:44] ability
[1:43:45] moses signed up for a job that had a lot
[1:43:47] of talking and he couldn't talk
[1:43:50] okay what kind of idiot signs up for a
[1:43:53] job where you have a
[1:43:55] speech impediment and you're supposed to
[1:43:57] talk a lot
[1:43:59] stupid right but i i'm speaking frankly
[1:44:03] right
[1:44:04] stupid to take a job as a speaker and
[1:44:05] you can't speak very well
[1:44:07] but he surrendered to the call and then
[1:44:10] god said i'll give you a mouthpiece
[1:44:12] i'll give you somebody that can talk for
[1:44:14] you
[1:44:15] right god had a provision for the fault
[1:44:19] for the failure for the inability of
[1:44:21] moses all he was looking for was a
[1:44:23] surrendered vessel that was willing to
[1:44:24] take on the job
[1:44:25] that god had put on his shoulders amen
[1:44:27] look at david i love david
[1:44:30] because david and goliath have a chat in
[1:44:32] front of everybody
[1:44:34] so david comes up remember he comes to
[1:44:36] the army and he talks to his brothers
[1:44:38] goliath comes out and dave's like who's
[1:44:41] this
[1:44:42] and why is he still alive
[1:44:45] and they're saying have you seen the
[1:44:46] mountain of muscle standing before you
[1:44:49] he's like yeah so why is he still alive
[1:44:52] you haven't answered my question
[1:44:54] and so he's talking a big talk and he
[1:44:57] says i'll do it
[1:44:58] i'll take care of it you know just give
[1:45:00] me a second i'll take care of this
[1:45:02] so they go to saul and they say hey
[1:45:03] we've got a guy here says he can take
[1:45:04] care of this
[1:45:05] so saul brings him in and david says hey
[1:45:07] yeah he's no different than the bear and
[1:45:08] the lion that i killed and
[1:45:10] god's with me so yeah he's dead good is
[1:45:12] dead don't worry about it i'll take care
[1:45:14] of it you know
[1:45:15] but now david goes in front of the army
[1:45:16] and him and goliath have this big chat
[1:45:18] about who's going to kill who
[1:45:20] now it's all great until this point but
[1:45:23] david still has to step into range of
[1:45:25] goliath at some point
[1:45:27] right but what i love about david is
[1:45:29] david doesn't just step
[1:45:31] david runs david is so confident
[1:45:35] that god is with him that he runs into
[1:45:38] certain death
[1:45:39] he faces a man that has spent his entire
[1:45:42] life
[1:45:42] specializing in separating your head
[1:45:45] from your shoulder
[1:45:46] and he walks in with a stick some rocks
[1:45:48] and a sling
[1:45:49] and he runs towards this man
[1:45:53] why he knows that he's led to do it
[1:45:57] and he knows he's on his land and so he
[1:45:59] knows that guy
[1:46:01] has to hit the ground amen
[1:46:04] brother brown says this he says just
[1:46:05] like david with the slingshot see
[1:46:07] harnessed himself and he went down
[1:46:10] finally god had a
[1:46:12] man that was subject to him harnessed to
[1:46:14] him
[1:46:15] that could not move until the word of
[1:46:18] god moved him
[1:46:19] if people would just do that today then
[1:46:21] he was his prisoner
[1:46:23] a prisoner of love yoked up in the bond
[1:46:25] of love with god as
[1:46:26] paul was yoked up in the bond of love
[1:46:30] to god amen with surrender comes a
[1:46:33] listening ear for the holy spirit
[1:46:36] amen to what allow you to hear what the
[1:46:38] spirit is saying
[1:46:40] one ear to go in but not to go out amen
[1:46:43] it comes with it comes a humility that
[1:46:46] says lord
[1:46:47] i cannot do this the humility is in
[1:46:50] recognition that i have nothing to offer
[1:46:53] on this
[1:46:54] task in this role in this ministry in
[1:46:56] this position
[1:46:57] in whatever you call me to do i have i
[1:46:59] bring nothing to the table
[1:47:01] except a willing heart that's it
[1:47:05] because we're talking about the
[1:47:06] supernatural when we talk about the word
[1:47:08] we're talking about the supernatural
[1:47:09] and you are never going to be able to do
[1:47:11] it on your own amen
[1:47:13] amen but you've still got to be able to
[1:47:15] surrender humble yourself
[1:47:17] listen and take that step in the right
[1:47:19] direction even like we read in that
[1:47:21] quote earlier the
[1:47:22] first step is always by faith because
[1:47:23] the first step is always
[1:47:25] out of reach just a little bit do you
[1:47:27] ever see a little kid reaching for
[1:47:28] something
[1:47:29] and he's this far away from getting it
[1:47:32] and he can't get it
[1:47:35] michael you probably see it and and
[1:47:36] sammy and whatnot they're looking to get
[1:47:38] it and they just
[1:47:39] can't get it that's what he's saying
[1:47:41] here it's out of your reach you cannot
[1:47:43] get it i don't care how smart you are i
[1:47:45] can't
[1:47:45] i don't care how fast you are how strong
[1:47:47] you are how skilled you are how
[1:47:48] disciplined you are how patient you are
[1:47:50] this is going to overcome everything
[1:47:52] that you bring to the table
[1:47:54] the only way you're going to get through
[1:47:55] it is if you surrender and humble
[1:47:57] yourself to me
[1:47:58] and then you step out amen you say lord
[1:48:00] this is your doing
[1:48:01] and on that basis alone i'm taking this
[1:48:03] step because it makes no sense
[1:48:05] for me to try this on my own amen we're
[1:48:07] a crazy people
[1:48:10] to the world because we'll step out on
[1:48:11] something that they know they could
[1:48:12] never do
[1:48:14] amen we're never going to personally
[1:48:16] achieve
[1:48:18] through our own skills through our own
[1:48:20] our our own strengths what the holy
[1:48:22] spirit has called us to do through the
[1:48:23] word amen
[1:48:25] brother braham says this he says and you
[1:48:27] know it's exactly the way the word is
[1:48:28] written
[1:48:29] he says you've got to be what he says
[1:48:30] you've got to be sure it's according to
[1:48:31] the word
[1:48:32] and then the holy spirit will never go
[1:48:34] against the written word of god
[1:48:35] never ever ever somebody says that
[1:48:37] they're wrong
[1:48:39] it's just just that simply says you know
[1:48:41] it's exactly the way the word is written
[1:48:43] god is duty bound to you so he says if
[1:48:46] you know that it's exactly the way the
[1:48:47] word's written
[1:48:48] god is duty bound to you to back that up
[1:48:50] then
[1:48:51] he certainly is don't matter about that
[1:48:53] why they say to make fun of
[1:48:55] god is a jealous god remember suffering
[1:48:58] for his word's sake as growing pains of
[1:49:00] his grace
[1:49:01] this is from that message from cadre
[1:49:02] diggs amen suffering for his word's sake
[1:49:05] is growing pains of his grace
[1:49:07] when you suffer for his word's sake it's
[1:49:09] just growing pains
[1:49:11] remember we spoke last service about the
[1:49:12] honor is not in the doing it's in being
[1:49:15] chosen to do it
[1:49:16] and when god puts a difficulty in front
[1:49:18] of you when god puts a stress in front
[1:49:19] of you when god puts a situation in
[1:49:21] front of you
[1:49:21] it is his grace to say i've anointed you
[1:49:24] i've appointed you i've chosen you to go
[1:49:26] through this
[1:49:27] and it's because i know you can go
[1:49:28] through it amen and now you can walk
[1:49:30] boldly
[1:49:31] because you're stepping into something
[1:49:32] that in your own mind you would never
[1:49:34] step into in the first place
[1:49:36] and then when you start stepping into
[1:49:37] the realm of the unknown where only
[1:49:39] faith can guide you
[1:49:40] you know that it's god calling you
[1:49:42] because you'll never step there of your
[1:49:43] own free willy man and then you can come
[1:49:45] up to me and say brother jonathan this
[1:49:46] is gonna happen
[1:49:47] this is gonna happen i prayed for this
[1:49:49] we're calling for this we're expecting
[1:49:51] it and i'll say
[1:49:52] praise the lord because you're stepping
[1:49:54] into something that you would otherwise
[1:49:55] never step
[1:49:56] into you've been led and anointed to do
[1:49:58] it and now we can join together
[1:49:59] and we can do what we can praise the
[1:50:01] lord for finished work i love what ron
[1:50:03] spencer said he says don't pray for my
[1:50:04] healing he said praise god for my
[1:50:05] healing
[1:50:07] right that's the attitude we really
[1:50:08] ought to take praise the lord for what
[1:50:10] he has done
[1:50:11] if he's called us into it he's seen the
[1:50:13] end from the beginning and it's a
[1:50:14] finished work in his side and it's only
[1:50:16] up to us
[1:50:16] to to take what the trial of our faith
[1:50:18] and move through to the other side in
[1:50:20] our time amen
[1:50:22] but says the same holy spirit that led
[1:50:24] simeon led you here tonight
[1:50:26] what did the holy spirit lead simeon to
[1:50:29] the manifested word the reality of the
[1:50:32] word the fulfillment of scripture was
[1:50:34] what
[1:50:34] simeon was led to he was led to the
[1:50:37] christ the messiah the anointed one
[1:50:39] he says the same thing that led whole
[1:50:41] the same holy spirit that led simeon
[1:50:42] if i can add this in to the manifested
[1:50:45] word to the anointed word
[1:50:46] led you here tonight don't be scared to
[1:50:50] drink
[1:50:50] walk right up freely with a lot of
[1:50:52] boldness we come
[1:50:54] boldly to the throne of god for god is
[1:50:56] faithful who has promised
[1:50:57] us he says don't be scared reach up and
[1:51:00] get it it's yours
[1:51:01] he's led you right up to the fountain he
[1:51:04] says now if you're thirsty drink
[1:51:06] just drink abundance don't drink till
[1:51:08] you can't drink no more
[1:51:09] drink till you get so drunk on the
[1:51:11] salvation of god you'll not listen to
[1:51:13] the critics not listen to your feelings
[1:51:15] any symptoms
[1:51:16] you'll look to calvary and say god i
[1:51:18] want to hear the roars of calvary
[1:51:20] that's all i hear he says amen there
[1:51:24] you are i want to ask you do you have
[1:51:28] a direction from the holy spirit do you
[1:51:31] have an
[1:51:31] unction in your life do you have a word
[1:51:34] that has been quickened
[1:51:36] to you today amen do you have an answer
[1:51:38] sitting in front of you that you haven't
[1:51:40] taken yet
[1:51:42] amen you've got the word you've got the
[1:51:45] training
[1:51:46] you've got the anointing
[1:51:49] what about the first step amen
[1:51:53] one step in the right direction when god
[1:51:54] says go forward that's when you want to
[1:51:56] move
[1:51:56] that's right you don't want to wait
[1:51:58] that's right
[1:52:00] brother said by one spirit we're all
[1:52:01] baptized into a variety store
[1:52:03] and this is the variety store right here
[1:52:06] this is the variety story he says
[1:52:07] there's a whole store of things in here
[1:52:10] and every blessing and every promise in
[1:52:12] here was given to mankind
[1:52:14] that was given to mankind is for every
[1:52:16] person that's baptized into it
[1:52:19] you have the holy spirit everything in
[1:52:20] here belongs to you
[1:52:22] you don't i'm sorry you'll get some of
[1:52:25] it but not all of it amen
[1:52:27] he says just walk right up and possess
[1:52:30] yours
[1:52:31] it's yours it's yours
[1:52:34] there's no prices in here right there's
[1:52:37] no this is only for so and so it is for
[1:52:39] whosoever will if you're in the store
[1:52:41] because you are baptized into it by the
[1:52:43] spirit everything in there is a freewill
[1:52:45] gift
[1:52:46] everything that you have need of is
[1:52:48] yours there's no limitation
[1:52:50] right there's no you can only take two
[1:52:52] because we got to save some more for the
[1:52:53] other family
[1:52:54] no he says come up and drink until
[1:52:56] you're so drunk
[1:52:57] that all you hear is calvary right so
[1:52:59] you've got more than you can
[1:53:01] more than you can fill yourself with
[1:53:03] take it with you fill your pockets with
[1:53:05] it
[1:53:05] give it to your kids to take some out
[1:53:07] with you because there's an
[1:53:08] inexhaustible supply that's in the story
[1:53:10] man
[1:53:10] he says there's something up high i have
[1:53:12] to get sometimes i have to climb high to
[1:53:14] get it
[1:53:15] it's in there but you've got to climb up
[1:53:17] and get it there's a little bit of work
[1:53:18] sometimes
[1:53:19] it's a little out of my reach but i get
[1:53:21] a ladder and get to it
[1:53:23] if you know it's free and you know it's
[1:53:24] for you why would you say well i'm not
[1:53:25] going to do the work to go up and get it
[1:53:27] he says find me a ladder and go get it
[1:53:30] he says i want to see what it's all
[1:53:31] about don't you
[1:53:33] amen if the holy spirit is calling you
[1:53:34] if the holy spirit is wooing you if the
[1:53:36] holy spirit is pulling you if the holy
[1:53:38] spirit is pushing you
[1:53:40] then god has always made a provision for
[1:53:41] what he's calling for what he's offering
[1:53:44] for what he's putting in your heart to
[1:53:45] claim amen
[1:53:46] he doesn't offer you a promise that he
[1:53:47] can't fulfill
[1:53:49] amen as we read earlier god is duty
[1:53:51] bound to back his word up
[1:53:54] and guess what if it has to be
[1:53:55] supernatural so be it
[1:53:58] don't shy away because you're asking for
[1:54:00] the supernatural amen
[1:54:01] brother brahma had this beautiful quote
[1:54:03] he says where god is
[1:54:05] the supernatural takes place for he
[1:54:08] is supernatural
[1:54:12] we don't want to just focus on the
[1:54:13] natural we want to say lord supernatural
[1:54:15] you're a supernatural god guess what to
[1:54:17] god supernatural is natural
[1:54:19] right if i could put it that way it's
[1:54:20] supernatural to us but to god it's just
[1:54:22] another walk in the
[1:54:23] park it's another day at work right this
[1:54:26] is what he does
[1:54:27] he does the impossible right so it's not
[1:54:30] supernatural to him it's just the same
[1:54:32] thing that he's always done and always
[1:54:33] been
[1:54:33] and all we're saying is lord we're going
[1:54:35] to believe you for it amen
[1:54:37] i went hunting for bighorn sheep back in
[1:54:39] alberta
[1:54:40] and the area where we hunted
[1:54:44] you could only access it by foot by law
[1:54:48] so you could only hike in or you could
[1:54:50] bring in pack animals but you couldn't
[1:54:51] ride a quad an atv
[1:54:53] a dirt bike electric bike nothing like
[1:54:55] that you had to take in your own gear
[1:54:57] and so you tried to strip down every bit
[1:54:59] of extra weight out of there
[1:55:00] because you'd go in 15 20 30 kilometers
[1:55:03] into the back country
[1:55:04] and you had whatever you carried in you
[1:55:05] had to carry out plus any animals you
[1:55:07] got
[1:55:08] okay so it was a big deal to go in there
[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:11] so i didn't have a pack animal so it was
[1:55:14] all on me so my pack weighed about 70
[1:55:15] pounds
[1:55:16] for a five-day trip and so we walked in
[1:55:18] there and we started
[1:55:20] at about 2 500 feet amen
[1:55:23] and you start the alberta's relative you
[1:55:25] know edmonton i think is about 2000 feet
[1:55:27] so we didn't hadn't come up very high we
[1:55:28] were still in the foothills
[1:55:29] and everything was easy to start you
[1:55:32] start walking drop down into a valley
[1:55:33] cross a couple rivers get your feet wet
[1:55:35] and then you slowly start to climb but
[1:55:36] it's still real gradual
[1:55:38] it's not it's not that difficult 70
[1:55:40] pounds didn't feel like much
[1:55:42] but then you started to come into the
[1:55:43] real foothills and it started to get a
[1:55:45] little
[1:55:46] steeper you know but there came a point
[1:55:48] where we came up to the first real
[1:55:50] mountain
[1:55:51] and i've got 70 pounds on my back and
[1:55:53] i've been walking for six hours
[1:55:56] and i'm facing that mountain and i've
[1:55:57] never been to that mountain before
[1:55:59] i know i've got to get across the
[1:56:01] mountain because that's where the sheep
[1:56:02] are
[1:56:02] allegedly they weren't
[1:56:06] but we think they are and i've got to go
[1:56:09] over that mountain
[1:56:10] and i'm looking up at that mountain and
[1:56:12] i'm saying hey
[1:56:14] no sir let's go around the mountain but
[1:56:16] guess what
[1:56:17] go around the other way there's another
[1:56:19] mountain you go the other way there's
[1:56:20] another mountain
[1:56:22] right there comes a point where you got
[1:56:23] to climb the mountain if you want to get
[1:56:24] where you're going to have to go amen
[1:56:28] in total we climbed to seven thousand
[1:56:29] feet that day we went from twenty five
[1:56:31] hundred feet to seven thousand feet
[1:56:33] that's forty five hundred
[1:56:34] foot climb that's 450 stories
[1:56:38] okay i think scotiabank is what 12 15
[1:56:40] stories
[1:56:41] so 30 scotia banks up the mountain
[1:56:44] right it's not all nice easy walking
[1:56:48] at the bottom it's brush and trees it
[1:56:51] starts with trees then it turns to brush
[1:56:54] then you start getting boulders in the
[1:56:55] brush
[1:56:57] and then after that you start to get
[1:56:59] shale
[1:57:00] right which is slippery underfoot so you
[1:57:03] got all different terrain but you still
[1:57:05] got to go up and over it
[1:57:06] because to get sheep you got to go where
[1:57:07] sheep go amen
[1:57:11] and i'd look at the bottom of that thing
[1:57:12] and i'd go ugh
[1:57:15] because we didn't just do one mountain
[1:57:16] we did multiple mountains
[1:57:19] because you're always looking for the
[1:57:20] animals
[1:57:22] and so we'd set up a camp and then we'd
[1:57:24] strip down as much of our gear as
[1:57:25] possible but i was still carrying 25
[1:57:26] pounds of gear
[1:57:27] plus a rifle no matter where i went
[1:57:29] because you had to be able to survive if
[1:57:30] you got stuck out in the weather
[1:57:32] right and i'd look up at a hill and i
[1:57:34] mean some of these hills were so steep
[1:57:36] that as i was climbing i put my hand on
[1:57:39] the side of the mountain to hold me
[1:57:40] steady
[1:57:41] okay that's steep you can't walk up that
[1:57:45] like this
[1:57:46] you've got to go side you've got to
[1:57:48] sidestep your way up that entire
[1:57:49] mountain
[1:57:51] and you know how we got up one step at a
[1:57:54] time
[1:57:55] all i could tell myself was just go one
[1:57:58] more step
[1:57:59] toughest hunting i've ever done in my
[1:58:00] life bar none tough as hunting
[1:58:03] and it's just one step at a time one
[1:58:06] step at a time and guess what mountains
[1:58:08] i thought would take us all day we'd
[1:58:09] finish in two or three hours
[1:58:11] one step at a time and all i was saying
[1:58:13] to myself was just keep putting
[1:58:15] one foot ahead of the other one foot
[1:58:17] ahead of the other and what was i
[1:58:19] looking for
[1:58:20] i was looking to get to the mountaintop
[1:58:22] right
[1:58:23] the goal was there i could see the goal
[1:58:25] but i had to go
[1:58:26] one slogging step after another
[1:58:30] until i got to the top of that amen
[1:58:32] guess what i was committed
[1:58:34] to making it to the top i wasn't there
[1:58:36] to sit down and camp in rose weenies
[1:58:38] i was there to try and hunt sheep so i
[1:58:40] was committed to what i was doing and on
[1:58:41] that basis i said
[1:58:43] one step in front of the other they're
[1:58:44] not going to walk down so we can shoot
[1:58:46] them we got to go up to get them one
[1:58:48] step at a time amen
[1:58:51] and mountains that i thought i wouldn't
[1:58:53] climb i climbed multiples
[1:58:55] in a day because i was committed
[1:58:59] to going to the other side because what
[1:59:02] i was looking for i believe to be
[1:59:04] on the other side amen but here's the
[1:59:06] other thing you think it's tough going
[1:59:08] up a mountain
[1:59:09] one step at a time you know what the
[1:59:11] challenge is coming down the other side
[1:59:13] just one step at a time you try going up
[1:59:16] shale that's tough
[1:59:17] we'd follow where the sheep went and all
[1:59:19] you'd see is a little tiny indentation
[1:59:20] and we followed it where the sheep walk
[1:59:22] because they know where it's best to go
[1:59:24] coming down there's no such thing
[1:59:25] because we've got to go in a certain
[1:59:26] direction
[1:59:27] shale every foot step you take there's
[1:59:30] the risk of falling out from underneath
[1:59:32] you and you go tumbling all the way down
[1:59:34] thousands of feet right so the challenge
[1:59:37] now
[1:59:38] is to what hold your steps
[1:59:41] keep yourself in control as you come
[1:59:42] down and here's the thing often times
[1:59:44] when we get up on a mountaintop
[1:59:45] experience
[1:59:46] what can happen up there sometimes pry
[1:59:49] takes hold right
[1:59:50] i had something to do with this and we
[1:59:52] launch off the other side
[1:59:56] because why there's another valley we
[1:59:57] got across and there's another mountain
[1:59:59] waiting for us
[2:00:00] so we launch off the other side you know
[2:00:02] what happens is we tumble down from
[2:00:04] victory
[2:00:05] because we forgot about the god that
[2:00:06] brought us to the top in the first place
[2:00:08] amen
[2:00:09] and our biggest challenge and sometimes
[2:00:10] we take a step and we would skid for 10
[2:00:13] or 20 or 30 feet
[2:00:14] and you're just waiting for something to
[2:00:15] grab hold so that you can stop
[2:00:17] there's it's almost like a rodeo coming
[2:00:19] down sometimes you know
[2:00:20] and you look up and i've got pictures
[2:00:22] unfortunately i only have one in here
[2:00:23] but
[2:00:24] i mean pictures where you look up and i
[2:00:25] mean it's shale and it's it's a 60 70
[2:00:27] degree slope
[2:00:28] it's absolutely brutal right and you
[2:00:31] lived but the thing is you had to take
[2:00:32] it one step at a time because if you
[2:00:33] presumed
[2:00:34] that because you got up it you could
[2:00:36] come down it just as easily you'd end up
[2:00:38] with a broken leg or broken arm or both
[2:00:40] right and you don't want that you want
[2:00:42] to have everything available to you to
[2:00:43] cross
[2:00:44] over the next valley and climb up the
[2:00:46] next mountain amen
[2:00:49] jeremiah 29 11 says for i know the
[2:00:51] thoughts that i think towards you saith
[2:00:54] the lord
[2:00:55] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[2:00:57] give you an expected end
[2:00:59] i mean there's a prophesied end there's
[2:01:01] a it's not just a prediction it's a
[2:01:02] prophesy it's a guaranteed end
[2:01:04] that's what he's saying here amen an
[2:01:06] expected end when god expects things
[2:01:08] they happen that's all about god god god
[2:01:11] is an expectation based on knowledge not
[2:01:13] based on
[2:01:14] perhaps maybes when god is expecting
[2:01:18] it's because it's going to happen amen
[2:01:20] verse 12 says then shall you call upon
[2:01:22] me
[2:01:23] and you shall go and pray unto me and i
[2:01:26] will hearken unto you
[2:01:28] and you shall seek me not just seek me
[2:01:31] says you shall seek me
[2:01:32] and find me when
[2:01:35] when you shall search for me with
[2:01:39] all your heart amen when your total
[2:01:42] commitment
[2:01:42] is to god that's when you find him not a
[2:01:46] lackadaisical walking around in one day
[2:01:48] out the next
[2:01:49] hearing here one way the other day
[2:01:50] another way no no no when your whole
[2:01:53] heart your whole mind your whole body
[2:01:55] is centered on finding the will of god
[2:01:57] in your life
[2:01:58] that's when you're gonna find it amen
[2:02:00] when you say lord i'm living my life for
[2:02:02] you and
[2:02:03] on that basis i'm trusting you to lead
[2:02:04] me that's when god steps on amen
[2:02:07] you've got to be committed what does
[2:02:08] commitment mean taking a step
[2:02:10] in the right direction you're not
[2:02:12] committed until you start walking the
[2:02:13] way you've been talking
[2:02:15] right david wasn't committed until he
[2:02:18] ran towards goliath
[2:02:19] that's when he was committed all of that
[2:02:21] before was talk
[2:02:22] but now this was the showdown amen was
[2:02:24] will you walk out
[2:02:26] and back up the words that you've talked
[2:02:27] about will you let yourself be put in a
[2:02:29] place
[2:02:30] where god alone can save you amen
[2:02:33] one step where you're trusting solely
[2:02:37] in god to keep you that's what
[2:02:39] commitment is
[2:02:40] when you can't save yourself if it all
[2:02:42] goes wrong from that point
[2:02:44] that's what commitment is amen
[2:02:49] says god is true to his promise no
[2:02:52] matter what he has to do
[2:02:54] bankrupt the heavens before he would let
[2:02:56] his word go defeated
[2:02:58] he never made a promise that he couldn't
[2:03:00] keep
[2:03:01] i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases
[2:03:04] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[2:03:05] shall recover
[2:03:06] amen if thou can't believe all things
[2:03:10] are possible
[2:03:11] i love it when sister loved when sister
[2:03:13] priscilla's saying only believe
[2:03:14] brother gerald's here we're going to
[2:03:16] sing only believe guess what
[2:03:18] we sang it again today that's why the
[2:03:20] angel loved it is because the purpose of
[2:03:22] that ministry was to get us
[2:03:23] to believe and when we sing that song
[2:03:26] with revelation
[2:03:28] it is tremendous but if we sing it
[2:03:31] by form by habit it loses everything
[2:03:34] doesn't it
[2:03:35] but when you can sing it because you've
[2:03:37] got a need in your life where
[2:03:39] only thing that is left is for you to
[2:03:40] believe in god to move
[2:03:42] that song becomes a reality in your life
[2:03:44] amen
[2:03:46] but the brahman says as you spread your
[2:03:48] faith god will let you take over the
[2:03:50] territory
[2:03:52] what he was talking about was somebody
[2:03:53] said i had a crippled arm
[2:03:56] and we prayed for it and you said i was
[2:03:59] healed
[2:04:00] and all i can move is my pinky he said
[2:04:03] so move your pinky right he says it may
[2:04:07] not be done in your body yet but he says
[2:04:09] you couldn't move your pinky yesterday
[2:04:10] so move your pinky and then the next day
[2:04:12] the next one moves and then the next one
[2:04:13] the next way he says pretty soon you'll
[2:04:15] be moving your arm
[2:04:16] he says move what god has moved on
[2:04:18] already take the healing he's given you
[2:04:21] take the step that he's given you and
[2:04:23] keep looking for the rest of it he says
[2:04:24] if it's only a pinky if it's only your
[2:04:26] little finger
[2:04:26] wave the little pinky and give god the
[2:04:28] glory for it amen he says as you spread
[2:04:30] your faith by wiggling your pinky
[2:04:32] by wiggling the little victory he says
[2:04:35] god will let you take over the territory
[2:04:37] it's yours
[2:04:38] god promised you your health again he
[2:04:41] says hallelujah
[2:04:42] why i feel good oh god spread me out
[2:04:45] he's saying i've got a crippled arm
[2:04:47] spread me out let me reach out
[2:04:49] amen footsteps is victory he told joshua
[2:04:52] everywhere the souls of your foot trod
[2:04:54] i'll give it to you
[2:04:55] footsteps was victory brother and i'll
[2:04:57] tell you today let's trod on the lands
[2:04:59] that god gave to us divine healing
[2:05:02] powers of god everything
[2:05:06] amen if the musicians would come
[2:05:09] amen he says let's trot on the lands
[2:05:11] that god gave to us
[2:05:15] let's all stand together if we would
[2:05:20] beautiful thing about taking one step is
[2:05:22] it doesn't matter where you are today
[2:05:25] it doesn't matter if you haven't given
[2:05:26] your life to the lord it doesn't matter
[2:05:29] if you haven't been baptized
[2:05:31] doesn't matter if you don't believe a
[2:05:32] thing there's always a place
[2:05:34] where one step in the right direction
[2:05:36] will bring you to a promise of god amen
[2:05:39] maybe you've been baptized and you
[2:05:40] haven't received the holy ghost
[2:05:43] there's one more step waiting for you in
[2:05:45] the right direction amen where brother
[2:05:46] brother gerald talked about he said i
[2:05:48] didn't have the holy ghost so i went and
[2:05:49] i prayed until i got it
[2:05:51] what was he doing he was showing
[2:05:52] commitment he was making steps he was
[2:05:55] stepping towards god
[2:05:56] scripture says draw near to him and
[2:05:58] he'll draw near to you
[2:06:00] right take that step toward him and say
[2:06:03] lord
[2:06:03] this is the promise i'm not calling for
[2:06:06] it of myself i'm calling for it because
[2:06:08] you
[2:06:08] said to call on my name so i'm calling
[2:06:11] on your name
[2:06:12] amen and maybe even an experienced
[2:06:13] believer god's calling you to greater
[2:06:15] heights
[2:06:16] and deeper depths you're going to have
[2:06:18] to step out in faith someday
[2:06:20] you want to see a reality of god you
[2:06:22] want to see a supernatural god it is
[2:06:23] going to require you to take
[2:06:25] a step that you have never been willing
[2:06:27] to take before amen
[2:06:29] amen i've seen in my own life stepping
[2:06:31] into ministry and every day
[2:06:33] i step up here it's a new testament
[2:06:35] faith
[2:06:36] amen but it's not just there it's as a
[2:06:39] husband it's as a father
[2:06:41] and then it's as an employee these
[2:06:42] different things we get challenges day
[2:06:44] by day
[2:06:44] and god is going to put this god is
[2:06:47] going to allow the squeeze to happen to
[2:06:48] get us
[2:06:49] to a place where we will say lord your
[2:06:51] word and your word alone
[2:06:53] is where i'm going to rest my soul i'll
[2:06:56] put my very life in your hands
[2:06:58] and i'll step where you tell me to step
[2:07:00] i'll go where you want me to go
[2:07:02] because it's all i've got left i don't
[2:07:05] want to get to a place of desperation
[2:07:08] i'd rather choose than be forced
[2:07:11] amen and that's my prayer today is that
[2:07:13] we would choose
[2:07:14] and not be forced that god would not
[2:07:16] have to pull out the whip
[2:07:18] but that he would rather be wooing us
[2:07:20] that he would be
[2:07:21] calling us to step in
[2:07:24] rather than him taking out the whip and
[2:07:26] cracking it on us a couple times to say
[2:07:27] come on son
[2:07:29] come on daughter i've got a little more
[2:07:31] for you here you don't have to dwell
[2:07:32] under that
[2:07:33] you don't have to be oppressed you don't
[2:07:34] have to deal with that habitual sin
[2:07:36] you don't have to have a relationship
[2:07:37] suffering like that right amen you don't
[2:07:40] have to have this angst in your life day
[2:07:41] in and day out
[2:07:42] you don't have to be out of fellowship
[2:07:45] these different things amen but you can
[2:07:47] have exactly what i promised but you're
[2:07:49] going to have to commit
[2:07:50] and you're going to have to commit by
[2:07:51] taking a step in the direction that i've
[2:07:53] laid on your heart amen
[2:07:55] amen let's just bow our heads together
[2:07:59] heavenly father lord it's a great
[2:08:02] comfort
[2:08:03] to hear these things in your word or but
[2:08:06] it's a tremendous challenge for our
[2:08:08] faith
[2:08:09] to take them off the pages and put them
[2:08:11] into our lives lord god
[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:08:15] lord i pray that these words would not
[2:08:18] just fall over the pulpit
[2:08:20] and land on the ground lord but that
[2:08:21] they would find lord fertile ground in
[2:08:24] the hearts

[2:08:42] deliverance
[2:08:43] or for salvation or for direction

[2:08:52] ordained for we pray that you would give
[2:08:54] it to them this morning heavenly father
