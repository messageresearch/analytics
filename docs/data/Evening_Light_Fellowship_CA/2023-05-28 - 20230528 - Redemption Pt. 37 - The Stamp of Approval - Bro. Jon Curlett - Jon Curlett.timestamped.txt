[41:17] closer to you we pray in Jesus Christ's
[41:20] name we ask it amen
[41:23] God bless you if you would turn to Luke
[41:25] chapter 9.
[41:27] Luke chapter nine amen we've
[41:29] we're thankful to have sister delfina's
[41:31] mother here visiting with us for a while
[41:33] amen God bless you Sister
[41:35] there's also sister Maureen's birthday
[41:37] yesterday so a belated happy birthday to
[41:40] her
[41:41] and then of course the the big news is
[41:43] that we welcomed Wesley Mark Coffey into
[41:47] the world this weekend brother Kim or
[41:49] brother Paul and Sister Kim so they're
[41:51] headed home today Lord willing and just
[41:54] trusting that God will continue to give
[41:55] her healing and Grace Just in these
[41:58] these coming days and weeks and of
[41:59] course brother Paul and the family as
[42:01] well it'll be a a new life for Michael
[42:03] as well he's no longer the only child
[42:05] now he's going to start to see Mama
[42:07] pulling away a bit and daddy pulling
[42:09] away a bit and now he's going to take
[42:10] second place for a while so that's hard
[42:12] on him too it's hard on him and it's
[42:14] it's a it's a period of him growing and
[42:16] and life-changing so we'll want to
[42:18] remember him as well
[42:19] hey man it's good to be in service
[42:21] thankful for the sunshine if only to
[42:23] show delfina's mother that it's not
[42:25] always rainy and cloudy and windy in
[42:27] Newfoundland amen amen it's wonderful to
[42:29] have it amen Luke chapter 9 verse 28
[42:32] says and it came to pass about an eight
[42:35] eight days after these Saints he took
[42:37] Peter and John and James and went up
[42:39] into a mountain to pray and as he prayed
[42:42] the fashion of his countenance was
[42:44] altered and his raiment was white and
[42:46] glistening and behold they're talked
[42:49] with him two men which were Moses and
[42:50] Elias who appeared in glory and spake of
[42:53] his decease which he should accomplish
[42:55] at Jerusalem but Peter and they that
[42:57] were with him were heavy with sleep and
[42:59] when they were awake they saw his glory
[43:01] and the two men that stood with him
[43:04] and it came to pass as they departed
[43:06] from him Peter said unto Jesus Master if
[43:09] it is good for us to be here and let us
[43:12] make three Tabernacles one for thee one
[43:14] for Moses one for Elias not knowing what
[43:17] he said
[43:18] and while he thus spake there came a
[43:20] cloud and overshadowed them and they
[43:22] feared as they entered into the cloud
[43:24] and there came a voice out of the cloud
[43:26] saying this is my beloved Son hear him
[43:30] and when the voice was passed Jesus was
[43:33] found alone and they kept it close and
[43:36] told no man in those days any of those
[43:38] things which they had seen amen God
[43:41] bless you you can have your seats May
[43:42] bless the reading of his word
[43:45] man I want to take a we're continuing on
[43:47] our series on Redemption of course but I
[43:50] want to take us now into the the full
[43:52] thought of adoption and and I want to
[43:54] take as a title for this service and
[43:55] Lord willing Wednesday night as well the
[43:57] stamp of approval and and I think as
[44:00] we've been preaching so much on adoption
[44:01] and and like I said in the last service
[44:03] or two it feels sometimes like a
[44:05] checklist and and it seems like like
[44:07] we're preaching this big massive thing
[44:09] that you're supposed to be and you are
[44:11] supposed to be it remember the the way
[44:13] to get there is Progressive it's God
[44:15] building us up bit by bit but also in
[44:17] that we we talked about the pain and the
[44:19] suffering and the chastenings and we
[44:21] also enjoyed that service I know but the
[44:23] thing is is that we get to a place
[44:24] sometimes and especially when the
[44:26] ministers dwelling on it that we can
[44:28] feel like everything is bad everything's
[44:30] tough and this idea of uh this process
[44:32] of adoption in the this period of time
[44:34] before you're truly adopted into the
[44:36] family of God that it's difficult and
[44:38] it's all difficult and it's all pain and
[44:40] it's all learning and it's all schooling
[44:42] and there's no good times and there's no
[44:44] enjoyable times it's just a slog through
[44:46] life and I kind of want to dispel that
[44:48] this morning I want to maybe take us up
[44:50] to a little higher plane because I want
[44:53] to remind you that Jesus went through an
[44:54] adoption process and that's what we're
[44:56] going to go through today I want to show
[44:57] you the ultimate example of what
[44:59] adoption looks like and if God's own son
[45:01] in the perfect flesh had to go through
[45:03] it then how much more do we have to go
[45:05] through it but yet he still had to go
[45:07] through it amen and so I want to show
[45:09] you through through his life what
[45:11] adoption looks like and what that
[45:12] process looks like not just so we'll see
[45:14] the pain and the suffering but we'll see
[45:16] the victories and we'll see the glory
[45:18] and we'll see the the love and we'll see
[45:20] the just the the overcoming that was in
[45:22] all of those things and we can take
[45:24] courage and we can take some Joy this
[45:26] morning that in all of this we're going
[45:27] to have highs and there's going to be
[45:29] good times and God can use us even
[45:31] before we're adopted of course he can do
[45:33] that and in Hebrews 5 Paul would say
[45:35] this so also Christ glorified not
[45:38] himself to be made in high priest but he
[45:41] that said unto him Thou Art my son today
[45:43] have I begotten thee he's pointing out
[45:45] that the glory of Christ was not in that
[45:47] he said it but that it was foretold of
[45:49] him in the first place that it was found
[45:50] in the word and it says though he were a
[45:53] son yet learned he obedience by the
[45:55] things which he suffered
[45:58] but we don't want to dwell just on the
[45:59] suffering he says and being made perfect
[46:02] he became the author of Eternal
[46:04] salvation unto all them that obey him
[46:07] and we look at the things that he
[46:09] suffered and he was born under a cloud
[46:11] he was born under a bad name he was born
[46:13] out of wedlock as far as the world was
[46:15] concerned he was born before his parents
[46:17] were officially married and then he was
[46:19] born in a bad Town remember he was born
[46:21] in in he came from a place called
[46:23] Nazareth he wasn't born there but he
[46:24] came from there he lived there and then
[46:26] you know and when Philip comes to
[46:28] Nathanael Nathanael says to him can
[46:30] anything good come out of Nazareth he
[46:32] was born on the wrong side of the tracks
[46:33] today maybe we'd say he was born up in
[46:35] Shea Heights or over in stab Court
[46:37] somewhere or something to say can
[46:39] anything good come out of there can
[46:41] anything good come out of that Ministry
[46:42] can anything good come out of that
[46:43] church he was born under a cloud they
[46:46] called him a drunk throughout his life
[46:47] they called him many things and he had
[46:49] to suffer through a reputation that was
[46:52] not Stellar maybe the way some of ours
[46:53] are being born into good families and
[46:55] good homes with a good reputation in
[46:57] these things he didn't have those sorts
[46:59] of things but through all of this
[47:02] he what he conquered
[47:04] and there was Victory inside of those
[47:06] things but I want you to realize that
[47:08] even in those early days Christ was the
[47:10] same as you and I he was sinless he was
[47:13] in perfect flesh but yet he was the same
[47:16] as you and I he did not even have the
[47:18] Holy Spirit upon him at that point he
[47:20] had to go through his early life as Adam
[47:22] did and as Eve would have done it he was
[47:24] a Son of God just like Adam remember it
[47:27] says in Luke 3 38 it says who was the
[47:30] son of Enoch who was the son of Seth
[47:32] which was the son of Adam which was the
[47:34] son of God Jesus Christ was the second
[47:37] Adam and so he was born exactly the way
[47:39] Adam was in terms of his flesh and the
[47:42] sinlessness and the Perfection that was
[47:44] there Adam was no different than Christ
[47:46] and so everything Christ went through he
[47:48] went through to prove that Adam could
[47:50] have done it
[47:51] that it was up to Adam to do it or not
[47:53] to do it but he was in the same
[47:55] situation he was in the same flesh and
[47:57] he could live a sinless life and we know
[47:59] that Adam was not fooled by Satan but
[48:01] rather he willingly chose to go with Eve
[48:04] to go with his wife into sin so that he
[48:06] could go with her and Trust the
[48:08] Redemption process later down the road
[48:10] but we look at Jesus life and in Luke
[48:13] 2 40 speaking of Jesus it says and the
[48:16] child grew and waxed strong in spirit
[48:19] he grew strong he increased in his
[48:22] Spirit he was filled with wisdom and
[48:24] what was upon him was the Holy Spirit
[48:26] upon him no and the grace of God was
[48:28] upon Him church I want you to realize
[48:31] that Grace has a lot of power Grace has
[48:34] so much to do with our lives especially
[48:36] early on in life my wife and I were
[48:38] talking about this on our walk yesterday
[48:39] how that you see that some people will
[48:41] do the exact same thing you do and they
[48:44] get destroyed for it and yet God's grace
[48:46] and he brings you in and you just get a
[48:47] little tap on the hand or sometimes you
[48:49] don't get anything because he's
[48:50] preserving you for a future he's
[48:52] preserving you according to his word
[48:54] because you're a part of him you're in
[48:56] his word and he's got to bring you there
[48:58] so his grace will keep you and Christ in
[49:00] the days of his youth it was the grace
[49:02] of God that kept him amen but the grace
[49:04] of God always brings you to a faith that
[49:06] pleases God and that's what it was doing
[49:09] in Jesus it was bringing him to a walk
[49:10] of Faith even before the Holy Spirit
[49:13] could come upon him
[49:14] see yourself in the scripture today what
[49:17] he went through we've got to go through
[49:18] and I'm thankful for Grace because Grace
[49:20] has kept me so far but then he's given
[49:22] me the Holy Spirit to do a greater work
[49:24] in my life but the grace keeps us for so
[49:27] long
[49:27] he knew who he was without a shadow of a
[49:30] doubt Christ knew who he was by the word
[49:32] that he was the son of God that he was a
[49:34] messiah and we see when he went to
[49:36] Jerusalem with his family with his
[49:38] parents at the age of 12 and he goes
[49:40] there and they leave after the after the
[49:42] feast and they're headed home and they
[49:44] don't realize he's not with them and
[49:46] then they go through the Caravan where's
[49:47] Jesus oh we don't have him we thought he
[49:49] was with you and they have to go all the
[49:51] way back to the temple and they find him
[49:52] there and he's teaching and asking
[49:54] questions and he says why are you mad
[49:57] don't you know that I must be about my
[50:00] father's business
[50:01] at 12 years old he knows who he is how
[50:04] by the word he has found his place in
[50:08] the word and he believes it completely
[50:10] and wholeheartedly and even at the age
[50:12] of 12 he's given himself completely to
[50:14] that and he says I've got to be about my
[50:16] father's business not carpentry
[50:19] but to be in the word
[50:20] and to be the Fulfillment of the word
[50:24] it says after that though
[50:26] he says that he he went down with them
[50:28] and came to Nazareth and was subject
[50:30] unto them but his mother kept all these
[50:33] sayings in her heart and Jesus increased
[50:35] in wisdom and stature he's growing and
[50:38] growing its line upon line precept upon
[50:40] precept the perfect Son of God growing
[50:43] into his position
[50:45] it says and he found favor with God and
[50:48] man and I took 30 years
[50:51] 30 years for perfect flesh to come to
[50:53] the place where God could come down and
[50:56] anoint him for purpose and he spent 30
[50:58] of those years growing in wisdom growing
[51:01] in stature and getting to a perfect
[51:03] place where God was ready to work with
[51:04] him
[51:05] you say if it took him 30 years how am I
[51:08] going to get there if perfect flesh
[51:10] comes down and God has to work with him
[51:12] for 30 years before he gives him the
[51:14] Holy Ghost and then has to wait another
[51:16] three years to have to adopt him what
[51:19] hope do you and I have
[51:21] you and I have the same hope that Christ
[51:23] did that it was written in the word of
[51:25] him and therefore it's going to happen
[51:27] we have to find our place in the word we
[51:29] have to find our message recognize our
[51:31] day and its message not that it's just
[51:34] to us but that is about us that it is
[51:36] for us and that we can find our place
[51:38] and then we start to walk and we believe
[51:40] it and God comes down and he seals our
[51:42] belief with the Holy Spirit and it takes
[51:45] us into the word and so we're not just
[51:47] believing it we're not just looking
[51:48] outside it and saying oh that's
[51:50] wonderful Revelation 10 7 is wonderful
[51:53] praise the Lord but you move to
[51:54] Revelation 10 8 and you take the book
[51:56] and you start to eat it and it starts to
[51:58] come out of your life amen
[52:00] but he started the same as You and I by
[52:03] faith under the grace of God he saw
[52:05] himself in the word and he said that's
[52:07] me
[52:08] that's me and he started to live like
[52:10] the word said he lived like the word
[52:11] said not started he did it that was his
[52:14] perfection in there but you start with
[52:16] Grace under the word of God and then he
[52:18] gives you Faith to move further and
[52:19] further into it amen
[52:21] but watch the progression because I want
[52:23] you to see yourself in the Life of
[52:24] Christ because remember in Romans 8 29
[52:28] it says that for whom he did for no he
[52:31] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[52:33] the image of his son that he might be
[52:36] what
[52:37] the first
[52:38] born of many Brethren so what he went
[52:42] through we've got to go through what He
[52:44] Is We will be he's the first of many
[52:46] that are coming behind him and so what
[52:48] his process is is what our process is
[52:50] going to be he didn't skip anything
[52:54] he didn't get a jump start on us all he
[52:56] had was perfect flesh sinless flesh but
[52:58] he went through everything the way we
[53:00] were the same Temptations the same
[53:02] trials the same issues the same people
[53:03] the same desires every single bit of it
[53:06] was there for him amen so in other words
[53:08] as throughout Palestine in Romans we are
[53:11] just like Christ in terms of where we
[53:12] are in the plan of God
[53:14] what he did with him he's going to do
[53:16] for you
[53:18] and the effects that he had in him he's
[53:20] going to have on us
[53:22] why because we're written into the word
[53:24] and we've just got to find our place in
[53:26] the word and say what is my message for
[53:28] my day and can I step into these things
[53:30] it's like we spoke about in the last
[53:32] service in that that seed of the Lily
[53:34] everything that was ever going to be in
[53:36] that Lily was in it in seed form
[53:38] and when the seed of God is inside you
[53:40] everything you're going to be is there
[53:42] already and God placed it there and
[53:44] nothing's going to stop it from coming
[53:45] forth nothing's going to stop him from
[53:47] coming forth it just takes like like we
[53:49] said last service getting in the
[53:51] presence of the Sun the s-o-n getting in
[53:53] the presence of God to bring out what's
[53:55] inside of you and it'll take you all the
[53:57] way to the fruition of of the perfect
[53:58] image that God had intended
[54:00] but watch Jesus he's 30 years old now
[54:03] and it says and Jesus when he was
[54:05] baptized went up straightway out of the
[54:07] water and low the heavens were opened
[54:09] unto him and he saw the spirit of God
[54:12] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[54:14] him and lo a voice from Heaven saying
[54:17] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[54:20] pleased you know what that tells me that
[54:22] means you can please God before you ever
[54:24] get the Holy Ghost by simple obedience
[54:27] by simple Faith by reading the word of
[54:29] God and stepping into it you can please
[54:31] God
[54:33] he can't give you the Holy Ghost until
[54:35] you obey Acts 2 38 it pleases God when
[54:38] you repent and you're baptized in the
[54:40] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[54:41] of sins and then he gives you the Holy
[54:43] Ghost you've got to do that
[54:45] you've got to do that and then he can
[54:46] lead you further into truth and further
[54:48] into purpose
[54:49] we know that that Jesus was walking by
[54:52] faith up to this point we don't know
[54:53] what gifts he had maybe he had some
[54:56] maybe he had none we don't know if he
[54:57] saw Visions If he if he if he had voices
[55:00] or dreams or anything like that we
[55:01] generally don't know that but we know
[55:03] that he was walking by faith up to this
[55:05] point because the Holy Ghost was not
[55:06] given to him
[55:07] God was not indwelling his Temple just
[55:09] yet he was an ordinary man yet sinless
[55:12] and we'll read that quote later where
[55:13] brother random talks about it
[55:15] but he says then when Christ came on
[55:17] earth when he was baptized in Jordan as
[55:20] the washing of the lamb at the Brazen
[55:21] labor notice then John bear record
[55:23] seeing the spirit of God like a dove
[55:25] coming from above and it settled on him
[55:29] that in and of itself is not special
[55:31] because men of old wrote scriptures as
[55:33] the Holy Spirit inspired them they were
[55:36] anointed temporarily and you saw with
[55:38] the prophets you saw with David you saw
[55:40] it with Moses and these different men
[55:41] they had the anointing they had the
[55:43] spirit of God on them temporarily but
[55:46] watch this it settled on him and it went
[55:48] into him God coming to his Temple Glory
[55:54] see yourself in this God coming into his
[55:57] Temple he was coming into him he was now
[56:00] indwelling he says God was in Christ
[56:02] reconciling the world to himself that
[56:04] was his Temple
[56:07] he said he was the firstborn of many
[56:09] Brethren so that means that there's got
[56:11] to be other temples that are coming
[56:12] behind and we've got to be able to
[56:14] receive the Holy Spirit the same way
[56:16] that Christ did
[56:18] even in this sinful flesh
[56:21] that's why we have to be what repent and
[56:24] be baptized put ourselves under the
[56:26] blood and then we come out sinless and
[56:28] then God can indwell the temple that
[56:29] he's he's ordained from the foundation
[56:31] of the world Amen
[56:33] listen this is the path that we must
[56:35] follow it means and it means we have to
[56:37] believe as Christ did the word says what
[56:39] we're going to be
[56:41] that's the greatest thing the greatest
[56:42] revelation we can have is that we're in
[56:44] the word that it is for me it is about
[56:47] me and it is me
[56:48] you get a revelation that you are in the
[56:51] word and the word is in you then nothing
[56:53] will stop you because you'll keep
[56:55] pressing because whatever's in you is
[56:56] going to come out remember we said last
[56:58] service you overcome by what you are by
[57:01] what's inside you you if you're the word
[57:02] you overcome by the word that's how
[57:04] Christ overcame by the word if you're
[57:06] emotional then you'll try to do your pep
[57:07] talks and you'll try and work your way
[57:09] up and it'll fall flat if you're
[57:10] intellectual you'll try and and believe
[57:13] your way into it and you'll try and use
[57:15] logic and you'll try and use Doctrine to
[57:17] get you into it and that'll fail as well
[57:18] but if you get the word inside you the
[57:20] person of the word the Holy Spirit
[57:22] that's what's going to take you across
[57:23] the finish line today
[57:25] Christ we saw in Paul would talk about
[57:27] he says in the seed singular Christ in
[57:30] him
[57:31] everyone else comes through that was the
[57:34] victory that was in Isaac was Christ
[57:36] that was the original seed that was the
[57:38] one that was coming the overcomer
[57:40] but then John would say this he said
[57:42] verily verily I say unto you except a
[57:45] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[57:46] die it abideth alone
[57:48] so we had to see the week come up we had
[57:50] to see Christ grow and mature into the
[57:53] perfect Son of God but he says now he's
[57:55] got to die because otherwise if he
[57:57] doesn't die then he's going to be the
[57:59] only one
[58:00] he's already said there's going to be
[58:01] many Brethren so it means he's got to
[58:03] die he says but if it die it bringeth
[58:06] forth much fruit it'll bring forth the
[58:08] same thing that he was it'll bring forth
[58:10] more sons of God it'll bring forth more
[58:12] Daughters of God it'll bring forth
[58:14] children of God just like Christ was
[58:17] it'll bring forth the word
[58:19] that's what he's going to have to do in
[58:20] all of this but listen to this quote to
[58:23] get an idea of what was happening at
[58:24] that scene with John it says now he was
[58:26] the son of God when he was born we've
[58:29] been saying this all through this series
[58:30] on adoption you're born a son
[58:33] Jonathan and Jensen and Samuel are my
[58:36] sons as soon as they are born
[58:38] but they're not adopted the way the
[58:40] scripture talks about it until they come
[58:42] to a place of maturity but they're born
[58:43] a son
[58:44] but when he was baptized by John on the
[58:47] Jordan they saw the Holy Spirit
[58:49] descending like a dove and remained on
[58:52] him like I said there were many men
[58:53] before that that the Holy Spirit had
[58:55] descended on but it always went back
[58:56] again because they were under the blood
[58:58] of bulls and goats but now it stays here
[59:01] amen and it what is it it's Christ
[59:03] ushering a new age by way of example of
[59:05] men that are going to be reunited with
[59:07] God
[59:08] men that are going to have access to God
[59:10] women that are going to have access to
[59:12] God not just access to them but they're
[59:13] going to have him the relationship is
[59:15] going to be restored
[59:17] it says in him being the word then the
[59:19] word begin to show itself
[59:22] you might be born the word as in you are
[59:24] a son or daughter of God the word is in
[59:26] there but as soon as you get the Holy
[59:28] Spirit that's when the word starts to
[59:30] show itself the word began to manifest
[59:33] itself why the Holy Spirit was in there
[59:37] speaking the word of God that's what
[59:40] causes us to be quick and that's the
[59:41] quickening power we're looking for is
[59:43] the holy spirit inside us that takes
[59:45] this end time message that takes the
[59:47] word that's written about us and makes
[59:49] it live day to day
[59:51] that brings us to a place of overcoming
[59:53] that brings us to a place of trust that
[59:55] brings us to a place of relationship in
[59:57] our lives
[59:59] it wasn't until Christ comes and he is
[1:00:02] baptized with the Holy Spirit the way we
[1:00:03] are that God is indwelling flesh
[1:00:07] as the first time we see it and we know
[1:00:09] that there's not going to be just one
[1:00:10] but there's going to be many of those
[1:00:12] amen he was called to be Messiah
[1:00:15] he was called to be the anointed one he
[1:00:17] was called to be the Redeemer he was
[1:00:18] called to be the deliverer but until
[1:00:20] this happened none of it was possible
[1:00:21] but as soon as he gets the Holy Spirit
[1:00:24] Everything Changes
[1:00:26] and watch the very first thing watch the
[1:00:28] order of events because it's for our
[1:00:29] admonition today it says then was Jesus
[1:00:32] led up of the spirit in the wilderness
[1:00:34] to be tempted of the devil in another
[1:00:36] part of the scripture says the Holy
[1:00:38] Spirit drove him
[1:00:40] forced him into it and led him into it
[1:00:42] and it led him there for 40 days and 40
[1:00:44] nights to be tempted I was listening to
[1:00:46] brother Donnie Reagan for a few minutes
[1:00:47] earlier this week and he was talking
[1:00:49] about fasting he says if God calls you
[1:00:51] to fast he says then you won't be hungry
[1:00:54] and he points to this scripture and he
[1:00:56] says that's proof that when God wants
[1:00:58] you to fast you won't be hungry and as
[1:01:00] soon as God wants you to stop fasting
[1:01:01] you'll get hungry and he says and then
[1:01:03] you need to eat
[1:01:04] but notice that Satan doesn't come and
[1:01:06] tempt him while he's not hungry
[1:01:08] he's in the fast scene and he and he's
[1:01:11] he's going through it and there's
[1:01:12] nothing there but as soon as the 40 days
[1:01:14] is over then he's hungry and then the
[1:01:16] Temptation comes because he doesn't have
[1:01:17] food with him and then Satan comes and
[1:01:19] he tests him to try and produce food out
[1:01:21] of out of stones bred out of stones and
[1:01:22] these different things
[1:01:24] this is the real start of Jesus training
[1:01:27] and the first thing he does is he's
[1:01:28] taken in and he's tempted to what will
[1:01:31] he stay with the word or will he use
[1:01:33] this newfound power that he has this
[1:01:35] life of the holy spirit for himself and
[1:01:37] why was it because Jesus Christ the man
[1:01:40] the flesh the body wasn't proven to
[1:01:43] God's satisfaction yet that seems an odd
[1:01:46] thing to say about the the manifested
[1:01:47] Son of God but in in point of fact he's
[1:01:49] not the manifested Son of God yet
[1:01:52] he's got a lot more to do before he
[1:01:53] comes to that point but he's got to be
[1:01:55] proven the same way each and every one
[1:01:57] of us and we know he passed that
[1:01:58] Temptation with Satan we covered that in
[1:02:00] the last service but I wanted to talk to
[1:02:02] you about this because I want you to see
[1:02:04] that this time of this process leading
[1:02:06] up to adoption is not all pain and
[1:02:08] sorrow and rough times and and just
[1:02:10] learning there's a beauty in it and
[1:02:12] there's a victory in it and there's a
[1:02:14] glory in it that's being manifested
[1:02:16] through the children of God as they come
[1:02:17] through this process
[1:02:19] watch this this is right after the
[1:02:21] Temptation it says and Jesus returned in
[1:02:23] the power of the spirit into Galilee and
[1:02:26] there went out a Fame of him through all
[1:02:28] the region round about and he taught in
[1:02:30] their synagogues being glorified of all
[1:02:32] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:02:34] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:02:36] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:02:38] day and stood up for to read and there
[1:02:41] was delivered unto him the book of the
[1:02:42] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[1:02:44] the book he found a place where it was
[1:02:46] written
[1:02:47] now remember he's been in the Tabernacle
[1:02:49] he's been in the temple he's been in the
[1:02:51] synagogue in Nazareth many times
[1:02:53] the word has been sitting there for
[1:02:55] hundreds of years and he has never read
[1:02:57] this scripture
[1:03:00] why
[1:03:02] remember he was called to be the Messiah
[1:03:04] he was the son of God he was born the
[1:03:06] Son of God he was ordained to it all but
[1:03:09] until he gets the spirit he can't read
[1:03:11] the scripture
[1:03:13] but Watch What Happens he says this is
[1:03:16] what he reads the spirit of the Lord is
[1:03:19] upon me
[1:03:20] until the spirit of the Lord was upon
[1:03:22] him he can't read that
[1:03:24] it's all prophecy until he has it but as
[1:03:26] soon as he reads it now he can say it's
[1:03:28] today
[1:03:29] he says the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:03:32] me because why he has anointed me to
[1:03:35] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:03:37] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:03:39] preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:03:40] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:03:42] at Liberty them that are bruised he'd
[1:03:44] been doing this all before he came there
[1:03:46] and he proved it and now he's coming in
[1:03:48] he's saying why and he's pointing to
[1:03:50] back in the word where it said he was
[1:03:51] going to do this to preach the
[1:03:53] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[1:03:55] closed the book and gave it to the
[1:03:57] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[1:03:59] all them that were in the synagogue were
[1:04:01] fastened upon him and he began to say
[1:04:04] unto them this day is this scripture
[1:04:07] fulfilled in your ears and all bear him
[1:04:10] witness and wondered at what
[1:04:12] the gracious Words which proceeded out
[1:04:15] of his mouth and they said unto him is
[1:04:18] not or they said is not this Joseph's
[1:04:20] son
[1:04:22] Jesus has just gotten the holy spirit
[1:04:23] this is maybe mere days or weeks after
[1:04:26] he's gotten it and he's already coming
[1:04:27] out and he's saying I am him I am the
[1:04:30] Messiah I'm the anointed one I'm the
[1:04:31] deliverer I am the one that has been
[1:04:33] prophesied all throughout time
[1:04:36] I'm what you've been waiting for it's me
[1:04:38] the day is here the time is here the age
[1:04:40] is here this is the moment it's coming
[1:04:43] to pass right in your midst today
[1:04:47] the same thing has to happen today
[1:04:50] not just through a prophet
[1:04:52] but through a people
[1:04:54] that we can say this day the scripture
[1:04:56] is fulfilled amen
[1:04:58] what a service that ought to have been
[1:05:00] in that synagogue that day
[1:05:02] when God indwelling flesh
[1:05:05] Christ the God man
[1:05:07] is sitting in the church and he's saying
[1:05:10] the word is being fulfilled in your
[1:05:12] midst
[1:05:13] what that ought to do to us today
[1:05:16] because he's here the same way except
[1:05:18] the Corporal body brother Branham said
[1:05:20] he's here in our midst and he's bringing
[1:05:22] to pass that which was written for this
[1:05:25] day this day this scripture is being
[1:05:28] fulfilled he had fulfilled it all but he
[1:05:31] was in the anointing and his work was
[1:05:33] starting and he was going to do all of
[1:05:34] it amen
[1:05:36] we say is it time
[1:05:39] I was reading that that sermon by
[1:05:40] Brother Jason Watkins on the end of all
[1:05:42] things
[1:05:43] and he says there it's time God's
[1:05:45] wrapping up with the Gentiles the next
[1:05:47] thing he's got is the 144 000 for the
[1:05:49] Jews to to seal them in and then
[1:05:51] everything's over he's wrapping
[1:05:52] everything up we're at the end of the
[1:05:54] end
[1:05:55] this is it church we are so close to
[1:05:57] going away it's not funny is it time
[1:05:59] brother John it is time it is time it is
[1:06:03] time it is time we ought to be an
[1:06:04] expectation we ought to be in surrender
[1:06:07] we ought to be in the word of God we
[1:06:09] ought to be on our knees saying God
[1:06:10] don't leave me behind don't let me hold
[1:06:13] you back don't let me hinder the moving
[1:06:16] of the Holy Spirit don't let me hinder
[1:06:17] the change that's going on in these
[1:06:19] things and yet they've rejected him
[1:06:21] right there
[1:06:23] that should have been the shoutiness
[1:06:24] most Hallelujah glory-filled service
[1:06:27] that they had ever had and yet they
[1:06:28] rejected him and they tried to kill him
[1:06:30] they led him to a cliff and they were
[1:06:31] going to throw him off the cliff and it
[1:06:33] but it wasn't his time and so he walked
[1:06:35] right through the crowd and he continued
[1:06:36] his ministry was it a trial yes
[1:06:39] was it tough for him he's there he's
[1:06:40] preaching he's under the anointing and
[1:06:42] it was the start of a great ministry and
[1:06:44] the first thing they did was rejected
[1:06:45] him
[1:06:46] but Watch What Happens through all of
[1:06:48] these things he spends the next three
[1:06:49] three and a half years and he's building
[1:06:51] up his disciples and he's going around
[1:06:52] and he's preaching the word and he's
[1:06:54] bringing he's setting the word in order
[1:06:56] he's getting them realigned with what
[1:06:57] God really intended for these different
[1:06:59] things and he raises the dead and he
[1:07:01] walks on water and he feeds five
[1:07:03] thousand here and he he takes Five
[1:07:05] Loaves and two fishes and he magnifies
[1:07:07] it in and has 12 baskets left over
[1:07:11] he's not even adopted yet church and yet
[1:07:14] in all of that look at the Miracles look
[1:07:15] at the signs and wonders look at the
[1:07:17] wonderful things that God had for him
[1:07:19] throughout his adoption process
[1:07:23] I don't think I'm adopted yet
[1:07:26] maybe I am
[1:07:28] but I don't think so
[1:07:30] because I think there's a lot further
[1:07:31] God has to take me but that doesn't mean
[1:07:33] that God hasn't done things in my life
[1:07:35] that God hasn't used me in my life and I
[1:07:37] know you guys have seen it as well
[1:07:38] listen we are going we are not just
[1:07:41] going to see things but we have seen
[1:07:42] things we're not just going to see
[1:07:44] Miracles we have seen Miracles we're not
[1:07:46] just going to see Heelys we are seeing
[1:07:48] healings we're not just going to see the
[1:07:50] supernatural we have seen the
[1:07:51] supernatural in this process we've seen
[1:07:54] in my own family myself we're Witnesses
[1:07:56] of all of those things
[1:07:58] so don't look at it and just say we're
[1:08:00] just going to have to go through school
[1:08:01] and slog know the glory of God is being
[1:08:04] revealed bit by bit as he grows you as
[1:08:06] well
[1:08:07] and that's why people miss it is because
[1:08:09] we don't go from A to Z in a moment in
[1:08:12] the twinkling of an eye that's the final
[1:08:14] changes the twinkling of an eye but
[1:08:16] everything's so Progressive people don't
[1:08:17] realize the revealing of Christ in your
[1:08:19] life
[1:08:21] but it's happening nonetheless the
[1:08:23] question is can you see it
[1:08:25] what matters is that you see it not that
[1:08:27] everybody else does can you see the
[1:08:29] change can you see the glory of God what
[1:08:31] was God doing through Christ he was
[1:08:33] proving and testing and showing that
[1:08:35] that flesh was perfectly surrendered to
[1:08:37] him
[1:08:38] that's what he was showing through all
[1:08:40] of this that's what was going on he was
[1:08:42] being prepared to do something that no
[1:08:43] one had ever done Christ was going to do
[1:08:45] something that nobody had ever done
[1:08:47] before
[1:08:49] we'd have people that hadn't seen death
[1:08:52] but we hadn't seen people that had died
[1:08:53] and come back to life and lived
[1:08:55] eternally
[1:08:57] he was going to have to lay his life
[1:08:58] down willingly and raise it up again and
[1:09:00] go back
[1:09:01] to beside the Throne of God Amen
[1:09:07] when we were in school
[1:09:09] maybe not all of us but most of us had
[1:09:11] moments of great achievement
[1:09:14] of Joy where we went through the we went
[1:09:17] through the semester we went through the
[1:09:18] year and we wrote the final exam and we
[1:09:20] got an A on it or maybe we just passed
[1:09:22] and that was Victory enough but my point
[1:09:25] is that through all of those things
[1:09:26] there was a victory there was a moment
[1:09:28] of achievement you know we I remember
[1:09:29] every year we used to have our our
[1:09:31] sports day and we go out and we'd all
[1:09:33] have to compete and we'd have to run all
[1:09:34] the Sprints and the the longer races and
[1:09:37] the shot put and the javelin and all
[1:09:39] these different things and guess what
[1:09:40] people won medals people got first place
[1:09:42] or got Podium finishes and those things
[1:09:44] and we look at that and say we train for
[1:09:46] those things or maybe we didn't but in
[1:09:48] the end we got something out of it and
[1:09:50] that's what I want you to understand is
[1:09:51] that through all of this there's
[1:09:52] something in it for you and there's an
[1:09:54] enjoyment and there's a piece and
[1:09:56] there's a love that can come through all
[1:09:57] of this there's a satisfaction there's a
[1:10:00] using of God that happens through all of
[1:10:02] this because God grows you and as he
[1:10:04] proves you and tests you he'll use you
[1:10:06] in the areas that he's proven you at
[1:10:08] absolutely we see that through all all
[1:10:10] things you look at David David as soon
[1:10:13] as God anoints him to be king he goes
[1:10:14] back to the sheep and you say well
[1:10:16] what's so big about that but in that
[1:10:18] sheep Duty that he had he was doing what
[1:10:20] he was killing a lion and he was killing
[1:10:22] a bear even as a young man with weapons
[1:10:25] that would never do that normally
[1:10:27] what was it God was proving through all
[1:10:29] of this that he was with him and that he
[1:10:31] was going to take him all the way to
[1:10:32] kingship if he just waited out if he'd
[1:10:35] just go through the process what was he
[1:10:37] doing he was showing David the
[1:10:38] anointings on you to do this and that
[1:10:40] means Victory belongs to you
[1:10:42] as long as you stay with the word as
[1:10:43] long as you stay with what I've told you
[1:10:45] to do what is it in the time of proving
[1:10:47] there is always victory there is always
[1:10:49] victory in there because otherwise how
[1:10:51] can you be proved
[1:10:53] there's always got to come a victory
[1:10:54] there's always got to come an anointing
[1:10:57] that that takes you to overcoming power
[1:10:58] why because God doesn't waste his time
[1:11:01] God's not wasting time just so he can
[1:11:03] say you're perfect he's growing you and
[1:11:05] he's maturing you so that he can use you
[1:11:07] as you move through
[1:11:09] yeah you know I trust my oldest son to
[1:11:11] go out and start my car
[1:11:13] and you know what that's a help to the
[1:11:15] family
[1:11:16] it's a little help but it's a help I
[1:11:19] don't trust him to drive the car I don't
[1:11:21] trust him to move it around in the
[1:11:23] driveway but I trust him to start it and
[1:11:25] get it warmed up in the winter so that I
[1:11:26] don't have to go to do it or Blanca
[1:11:27] doesn't have to go and do it and you
[1:11:29] know what that's a thrill for him the
[1:11:31] first time and the second time the third
[1:11:33] time then he just starts to see we're
[1:11:34] using him
[1:11:35] but my point is is that for him the
[1:11:37] first time he goes out and he starts
[1:11:38] that car and there's nobody around what
[1:11:40] is it it's a thrill the first time God
[1:11:42] uses you for something there's a thrill
[1:11:44] that comes with it you're like yes he's
[1:11:47] finally trusting me he finally believes
[1:11:49] I'm ready to do something
[1:11:51] all of us boys want to drive immediately
[1:11:53] I saw brother Mark out there with
[1:11:54] Michael the other day in this parking
[1:11:55] lot and he had Michael driving the car
[1:11:57] why Michael wants to drive the car maybe
[1:11:59] it was Rafi I don't remember
[1:12:02] but what he's moving the wheel
[1:12:05] and brother Mark's working the pedals
[1:12:07] and he's also controlling the wheel to
[1:12:09] make sure he doesn't go too crazy with
[1:12:10] it
[1:12:11] but sometimes what do we want to do we
[1:12:12] want to drive the car right away if I
[1:12:14] can start it I ought to be able to drive
[1:12:16] it but we want to jump straight to full
[1:12:18] adoption which is doing 100 kilometers
[1:12:20] an hour on the highway
[1:12:22] when we've only just been given the keys
[1:12:23] to start it
[1:12:24] you've got to build through the process
[1:12:26] but there's a blessing there's a joy
[1:12:28] there's a there there's something
[1:12:29] there's a satisfaction that comes
[1:12:31] through these things what about the
[1:12:33] first time you you know you I remember
[1:12:34] the first time I operated a uh a
[1:12:37] lawnmower and I used to walk with Dad
[1:12:38] and he'd he'd be pushing the mower like
[1:12:41] this but it had a lower bar here and I
[1:12:43] would walk in front of his feet and put
[1:12:45] my feet put my hands on the middle bar
[1:12:46] and push it and I don't know how he put
[1:12:48] up with it because you know you're
[1:12:50] trying to move quickly with the mower
[1:12:51] and I'm just this little short kid I'm
[1:12:53] so short that I'm pushing that chest
[1:12:54] height into the middle bar of the of the
[1:12:56] lawnmower and yet dad would let me mow
[1:12:58] the lawn with him and what a treat that
[1:13:00] was and what was he doing I wasn't
[1:13:02] helping him in any way in fact I was
[1:13:04] probably hindering him a bit but he was
[1:13:06] getting me used to what I was going to
[1:13:08] have to do later and then what a
[1:13:09] thriller was the first time that I got
[1:13:11] to mow the lawn by myself
[1:13:14] until I learned that they were using me
[1:13:15] again
[1:13:16] but that's not the principle we're going
[1:13:18] at today the thing is it was a thrill to
[1:13:19] do it wasn't it you go out there and you
[1:13:21] fired up here in Newfoundland we don't
[1:13:23] get enough grass but we do know about
[1:13:24] snow blowers and the first time that Dad
[1:13:26] says all right son you can use the snow
[1:13:28] blower
[1:13:29] and what is it he starts it and he gets
[1:13:32] it in position and then he tells you go
[1:13:34] forward
[1:13:35] and all you do is a straight cut don't
[1:13:37] you slow and easy
[1:13:39] you're not close to the cars you're not
[1:13:41] close to anything that's of value and he
[1:13:43] gets you to go forward maybe he lets you
[1:13:46] pull it back and then he aligns it again
[1:13:47] and then forward and back forward and
[1:13:49] back and it's just a little bit but
[1:13:50] there comes a day where what he says all
[1:13:52] right
[1:13:53] go do the go do the driveway son and you
[1:13:56] got to start it and you got to move it
[1:13:58] and you got to keep from hitting cars
[1:14:00] but there's a thrill through all of this
[1:14:01] that hey he trusts me I can do this he
[1:14:04] sees it I'm capable of doing it and then
[1:14:06] our focus is what help me not to hit the
[1:14:08] cars
[1:14:09] help me not to grind up something that
[1:14:10] I'm not supposed to put through the
[1:14:12] Snowshoe right but there's that that
[1:14:14] thrill that comes with it amen
[1:14:16] we think about our our young sisters and
[1:14:19] the first time the mama says you can
[1:14:20] bake cookies
[1:14:23] it's always the neatest little thing
[1:14:24] because they're there and they're mixing
[1:14:26] things up you know Samuel likes to do it
[1:14:28] he likes to get up there and get his
[1:14:29] hands all dirty and these different
[1:14:30] things but but the girls they do that
[1:14:32] and they make those cookies and it's
[1:14:34] such a simple thing to an adult but to
[1:14:36] the little children to the young girls
[1:14:37] it's such a big deal because it's their
[1:14:39] first bit of baking
[1:14:41] and what is it pretty soon after a while
[1:14:43] they'll say mama can I make some cookies
[1:14:44] and mama says sure go do it you
[1:14:46] understand the equipment you understand
[1:14:48] the process you understand how to
[1:14:50] operate these things and now go do it
[1:14:53] what am I getting at there's an
[1:14:54] enjoyment in the learning
[1:14:56] there's something that comes with these
[1:14:58] things
[1:15:01] sometimes I think the problem is that we
[1:15:03] put pressure on ourselves to be super
[1:15:04] Christians immediately
[1:15:08] if you're performance driven
[1:15:10] you want to be a super Christian right
[1:15:12] now
[1:15:13] it's what I wanted to be didn't happen
[1:15:15] and guess what it won't happen for you
[1:15:16] either why because God builds us bit by
[1:15:18] bit
[1:15:19] he's building us up into the stature of
[1:15:22] a perfect child of God a perfect son and
[1:15:23] daughter of God so he's building us up
[1:15:25] bit by bit I I have the same enthusiasm
[1:15:29] is a habit killer
[1:15:31] enthusiasm is a habit killer because
[1:15:33] what happens is we want to be a super
[1:15:35] Christian and so brother John's been
[1:15:37] speaking about devotions and reading
[1:15:38] your Bible and praying and so do we say
[1:15:40] what do we say we say I'm going to go
[1:15:42] and I'm going to have an hour worth of
[1:15:43] devotions every single morning first
[1:15:45] thing and you haven't been having
[1:15:46] devotions all along
[1:15:48] or it's been sporadically for a few
[1:15:50] minutes here and there
[1:15:51] and what do you do you get up the first
[1:15:53] morning you get up an hour early and
[1:15:55] you're tired but you go do it because
[1:15:56] your enthusiasm is there and you said
[1:15:58] you do it the second morning you get up
[1:16:00] but maybe you're only up 15 minutes
[1:16:01] early third minute you're up and you're
[1:16:03] 45 minutes early by the end of the week
[1:16:05] you're not having devotions at all
[1:16:06] you're just back to sleeping in
[1:16:08] why because you tried to run a marathon
[1:16:11] on your first day of running
[1:16:13] I'd rather you spent 10 minutes a day
[1:16:17] for the rest of the year
[1:16:19] than last a week at an hour a day and
[1:16:21] then just lose the Habit altogether
[1:16:22] you've got to build yourself up into it
[1:16:24] you got to build yourself up into it you
[1:16:26] got to give yourself the time listen
[1:16:27] it's not easy to get up in the mornings
[1:16:29] to get up early and give the first part
[1:16:31] of your day here it struck me when
[1:16:32] brother Dwayne was here he was talking
[1:16:34] to me church I don't know about you he
[1:16:35] said what's the first thing you do in
[1:16:37] the morning you pick up your phone
[1:16:39] you know what that is now that's not the
[1:16:41] first thing that was for me
[1:16:43] I don't pick up my phone phone I stay
[1:16:46] there and I pray for just a couple
[1:16:47] minutes for the start of my day then I
[1:16:50] go take my shower and then I go down and
[1:16:52] I have my devotions but the first thing
[1:16:53] I do is I give a part of my day to God
[1:16:55] and say Lord this is your day order it
[1:16:57] keep me in it
[1:16:59] but the thing is you can't run a
[1:17:01] marathon your first day of training
[1:17:02] you've got to work your way up to it
[1:17:04] don't think that your enthusiasm is
[1:17:06] going to take you through remember I
[1:17:08] keep telling that story about my mother
[1:17:09] that that wore makeup and she said Lord
[1:17:11] I know you don't want me to wake wear
[1:17:13] makeup that's what Jezebel did but I
[1:17:15] like my makeup and so she said Lord you
[1:17:18] take me take it away from me and in six
[1:17:20] months the Lord took it away from her
[1:17:21] Bit by Bit by Bit
[1:17:23] listen let him Build You Up Bit by Bit
[1:17:25] by Bit sometimes he's going to give us
[1:17:27] big jumps and we'll we'll plan we'll
[1:17:29] we'll Plateau for a bit and then we'll
[1:17:30] get a big jump but usually the growth of
[1:17:33] God that he has in our lives is just
[1:17:34] gradual and we've got to be able to rest
[1:17:36] in the gradual work of him and not put
[1:17:38] pressure on ourselves because why it's
[1:17:41] not up to us to fulfill it it's up to
[1:17:43] him it's his word it's his promise it's
[1:17:45] his prophecy all we have to do is
[1:17:47] surrender ourselves to it
[1:17:49] but we do have a choice we do have a
[1:17:51] decision and let me say this you're not
[1:17:53] going to get up earlier if you don't go
[1:17:54] to bed earlier
[1:17:56] you're not going to have the right
[1:17:57] habits if you're not taking out some of
[1:17:59] your old habits as well you're going to
[1:18:00] have to make room and that's your
[1:18:02] decision to do
[1:18:03] but start slow
[1:18:05] and get a taste for it
[1:18:07] start seeing the effects of it in your
[1:18:09] life and pretty soon you'll want it more
[1:18:11] and more and more and you'll realize the
[1:18:13] benefit of it and you'll realize the
[1:18:15] need for it and you'll realize that when
[1:18:16] you feed on that other things start to
[1:18:18] magically fall away
[1:18:20] that is the way it is because what under
[1:18:22] the preaching or the hearing of the word
[1:18:24] under the reading of the word will come
[1:18:26] Faith to draw you into what God has for
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:29] don't try and do it yourself amen
[1:18:32] it's God that's got to do the work
[1:18:33] except the Lord build the house they
[1:18:35] labor in vain
[1:18:39] it's his working it's our surrendering
[1:18:41] it's us saying Lord I need you in these
[1:18:43] things
[1:18:44] but the very things that Jesus was doing
[1:18:46] and through all of these three three and
[1:18:47] a half years were proving him even so
[1:18:49] much that the priesthood had to
[1:18:51] privately not publicly but privately
[1:18:53] agree we know that no man can do these
[1:18:54] things except God be with them
[1:18:57] that was even the testimony of his
[1:18:58] enemies the ones that ultimately put him
[1:19:01] on the cross amen was that they but yet
[1:19:03] in all of that in all of that he was not
[1:19:06] adopted by God yet
[1:19:08] that they could say your life is so God
[1:19:11] like that we know that God is with you
[1:19:12] and yet he wasn't even fully adopted
[1:19:15] he was a holy ghost-filled man just like
[1:19:18] we are
[1:19:19] sinless but in flesh
[1:19:24] Jesus adoption ceremony we read at the
[1:19:26] beginning we'll read it again in a
[1:19:28] minute that just that came just mere
[1:19:30] months before his crucifixion and I
[1:19:32] don't know the exact timeline I I didn't
[1:19:34] spend a ton of time on it I'll be honest
[1:19:35] because it doesn't matter for my point
[1:19:37] but some say it's as far away as eight
[1:19:39] months before and then traditionally
[1:19:40] they say it's 40 days before his
[1:19:43] crucifixion but we're talking about a
[1:19:44] man a child of God a Son of God that was
[1:19:46] adopted just at the very end of his life
[1:19:50] and it was to prepare him for that thing
[1:19:52] that we talked about earlier
[1:19:54] that's why I don't worry about adoption
[1:19:58] what I ask myself is am I in the process
[1:20:01] because the timeline belongs to God
[1:20:03] adoption will happen in God's time I was
[1:20:06] listening to adoption number four this
[1:20:08] morning and brother Bram says this and
[1:20:09] it's not in this I just wrote in my
[1:20:11] notes he says Don't Be Afraid
[1:20:14] everything's all right
[1:20:16] everything works all along
[1:20:18] he says keep your heart right
[1:20:22] he's talking about adoption
[1:20:24] he's saying no I preached everything to
[1:20:26] you about what you are supposed to look
[1:20:27] like as a son and daughter of God and he
[1:20:29] says don't worry
[1:20:31] God will take you through
[1:20:32] you got the Holy Ghost Keep Your Heart
[1:20:34] Right and God will bring you through
[1:20:35] this entire process amen
[1:20:38] amen it's a promise to us and all I want
[1:20:40] all my prayer is this Lord don't let me
[1:20:42] waste your time
[1:20:44] don't let me waste your work listen if
[1:20:47] all I'm doing is starting the car for
[1:20:49] somebody that's higher up the ladder let
[1:20:51] me start the car if all I'm doing is
[1:20:53] praying for the needs of the church if
[1:20:54] all I'm doing is mowing the grass so
[1:20:56] somebody else doesn't have to do it and
[1:20:58] can put their efforts and gifts into
[1:20:59] something else let me be that let me let
[1:21:02] me be effective where I'm at right now
[1:21:04] today let me not just be looking forward
[1:21:06] to the future and saying well when I get
[1:21:08] this and when you give me that and no no
[1:21:10] no no Lord let me be effective today let
[1:21:13] me have Victory today let me have have
[1:21:15] something that I can do for your kingdom
[1:21:17] today right where I'm at and what I have
[1:21:19] found is when my mentality is Lord use
[1:21:21] me where I'm at miraculously I get used
[1:21:25] I can't tell you how many times I've
[1:21:27] I've testified and witnessed to people
[1:21:29] over the last couple of months
[1:21:32] just about where we're at and what's
[1:21:34] going on
[1:21:35] and what is it it's God saying I'll use
[1:21:37] you where you're at son
[1:21:39] I'll use you where you're at
[1:21:41] I'm not trying to draw them to me I'm
[1:21:42] not trying to draw them us I'm trying to
[1:21:44] draw them to Christ I'm putting it out
[1:21:45] there to see what happens
[1:21:47] will they nibble the bait
[1:21:49] will the life be salty will the
[1:21:51] testimony be salty enough to get them
[1:21:52] through these doors so they can hear the
[1:21:54] word of God that's it
[1:21:56] that's it takes God to save them
[1:21:59] but he's got to use a voice somewhere
[1:22:01] and I believe we've got a lot of voices
[1:22:03] here we got a lot of lives here that can
[1:22:04] be a testimony to the things of God that
[1:22:06] are happening in this age amen
[1:22:09] I want to apply what I know now if I
[1:22:11] pass the test Lord help me not to be
[1:22:13] delinquent and just say well we'll put
[1:22:14] it on the Shelf let me use what I've got
[1:22:16] however little it is today
[1:22:20] let's look at that adoption scene we'll
[1:22:22] look at it from Mark 9 says and he said
[1:22:24] unto them verily I say unto you that
[1:22:26] there be some of them some of them that
[1:22:27] stand here which shall not taste of
[1:22:29] death till they have seen the kingdom of
[1:22:31] God come with power that was the day of
[1:22:32] Pentecost The Upper Room
[1:22:34] so after six days Jesus taketh them with
[1:22:36] him Peter taketh with him Peter James
[1:22:39] and John and leadeth them up into an
[1:22:41] high mountain apart by themselves and he
[1:22:43] was transfigured before them and his
[1:22:45] raiment became shining exceeding white
[1:22:48] as snow so as no Fuller on Earth can
[1:22:51] wipe them and there appeared unto them
[1:22:53] Elias and Moses and they were talking
[1:22:55] with Jesus and Peter answered and said
[1:22:57] to Jesus Master it is good for us to be
[1:23:00] here let us make three Tabernacles one
[1:23:02] for thee one for Moses one for Elias and
[1:23:05] he wished not what to say for they were
[1:23:07] sore afraid
[1:23:08] and there was a cloud that overshadowed
[1:23:11] them and a voice came out of the cloud
[1:23:13] saying this is my beloved Son
[1:23:15] hear him now remember when he's at
[1:23:17] Jordan being baptized by John he was his
[1:23:20] beloved Son then
[1:23:22] let me add to that it says in whom I am
[1:23:25] well pleased
[1:23:27] before he had the Holy Ghost on him yet
[1:23:29] his life pleased God
[1:23:31] your life can please God Church simple
[1:23:34] obedience will please God
[1:23:36] but when you get the Holy Ghost how he
[1:23:38] takes you from a place of not just
[1:23:39] pleasing him but to a place where you
[1:23:41] speak for him because what he's doing
[1:23:43] here is that nothing about Christ has
[1:23:46] changed and who he was but what now the
[1:23:48] trust is there now the proof is there
[1:23:50] now God is satisfied with what that the
[1:23:53] idea that that human flesh is so
[1:23:55] surrendered to him that he can allow it
[1:23:57] to have authority that he can allow it
[1:23:59] to have power that he can allow it to
[1:24:01] speak and what is it what is it it's God
[1:24:03] saying I'll be silent from heaven now
[1:24:05] and the voice on Earth speaks for me
[1:24:09] that's the power and authority that's
[1:24:11] why Jesus could say all power and
[1:24:12] authority on heaven in heaven and in
[1:24:14] Earth is given to me this is where it
[1:24:16] was
[1:24:17] speak it and it'll happen
[1:24:19] whatever you say will happen
[1:24:21] but I want you to realize that this
[1:24:22] happens after he has raised the Dead
[1:24:25] Walked on Water cast out demons
[1:24:28] multiplied food created things fished
[1:24:31] with money in its mouth
[1:24:32] that all happened before he ever said
[1:24:35] hear ye him
[1:24:36] this is Christ's adoption ceremony right
[1:24:39] here and it's God placing his authority
[1:24:41] in him and he becomes God's absolute and
[1:24:43] he becomes God's voice on Earth
[1:24:45] Prophet God would say this he says
[1:24:47] everything that he gave him possession
[1:24:48] over will take place God adopted his own
[1:24:52] son like that Jesus he says walking as
[1:24:55] an ordinary man
[1:24:57] what an ordinary man meaning he was in
[1:24:59] flesh
[1:25:01] with the Holy Spirit just like you and I
[1:25:03] are in flesh with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:07] he says but one day upon mounts trigger
[1:25:09] Mount Transfiguration he took three as a
[1:25:12] witness Peter James and John he says
[1:25:13] that's hope faith and charity he called
[1:25:15] them out and he separated Jesus from
[1:25:17] them and he overshadowed him and the
[1:25:19] Bible said his raiment Shine Like the
[1:25:21] Sun and its strength what was it he says
[1:25:24] that special robe God adopting his own
[1:25:27] son and they saw Moses and Elijah appear
[1:25:30] and so forth then they show him and they
[1:25:32] saw Jesus only and when he looked back
[1:25:34] then God the Father after putting the
[1:25:36] robe on his son said this is my beloved
[1:25:38] Son hear ye him no wonder Jesus could
[1:25:41] say all the powers in Heaven and Earth
[1:25:43] is given unto my hand for he was adopted
[1:25:46] by his father unto the Glorious kingdom
[1:25:48] of God
[1:25:49] he went through the exact same process
[1:25:51] that we go through
[1:25:53] the prophet of God's saying catch the
[1:25:55] type
[1:25:56] recognize that this has to happen for
[1:25:58] you and then he would continue in the
[1:25:59] message of hidden life he says now I
[1:26:02] believe that this is the time that the
[1:26:04] church has arrived at today that the
[1:26:06] next great move in the church is for God
[1:26:11] the move is for God
[1:26:14] not for building up our numbers not for
[1:26:17] great this not for great dad not for big
[1:26:19] finances not for big recognition
[1:26:21] recognition but our move is for God
[1:26:25] that it's a people that are seeking
[1:26:27] after and following after the things of
[1:26:29] God that they're taking the whole word
[1:26:31] of God and they're they're embracing it
[1:26:33] and it's becoming engrafted into them
[1:26:34] and that word is coming forth again
[1:26:37] he says for after we've seen the false
[1:26:39] alarms what the false alarms Luther
[1:26:43] it was a part and then it failed and
[1:26:45] then it was Wesley and then it failed
[1:26:47] and then it was Azusa Street and then
[1:26:48] they failed they all went into
[1:26:49] denomination but it was building up and
[1:26:51] the life of God kept moving he says
[1:26:53] there's been many false alarms where we
[1:26:55] thought it was it but it wasn't it now
[1:26:57] is the time he says but now God will
[1:27:00] place in his church correctly Apostles
[1:27:02] prophets teachers evangelists not
[1:27:04] man-made Seminary bought but God will
[1:27:07] place into the church not theology run
[1:27:09] overs and overnights but God will place
[1:27:12] in the church as God has chosen and as
[1:27:15] the Holy Ghost has tutored this church
[1:27:16] and raised it up and in there God will
[1:27:20] adopt into the position his sons they're
[1:27:23] already his sons but whether they are
[1:27:26] worthy of the position that he has for
[1:27:29] them
[1:27:30] it's no wonder that John spoke about the
[1:27:32] false Ministries in the and the and the
[1:27:34] the ravening Wolves and the ones that
[1:27:36] came among them and he says the the
[1:27:38] issue is that they they challenge the
[1:27:40] idea that Christ came in the flesh
[1:27:42] because if Christ doesn't come in the
[1:27:44] flesh then we have no example and we
[1:27:46] have no process and we have nothing to
[1:27:48] look forward to and then we can have a
[1:27:50] religion of our own making without the
[1:27:52] word power of God in our lives without
[1:27:54] the the changing power of the holy
[1:27:56] spirit in us we can believe any Doctrine
[1:27:58] we can do anything and we see it in the
[1:28:00] world today we see it in the
[1:28:01] denominations today they say we believe
[1:28:03] the word of God but they forget that
[1:28:05] it's supposed to be God in flesh not
[1:28:07] just there but after that because he was
[1:28:09] the first among many brethren
[1:28:11] so it was supposed to happen in our day
[1:28:13] so when they said Christ did not come in
[1:28:15] the flesh they denied that the Son of
[1:28:17] God came down and indwelt Humanity then
[1:28:19] what were they saying is you don't have
[1:28:20] to have it either
[1:28:22] and more to the point they'd say I don't
[1:28:24] have to have it
[1:28:26] and so you could have a minister that
[1:28:27] could say and do whatever he wanted from
[1:28:29] behind that Pulpit control the people
[1:28:30] turn them into a man-made denomination
[1:28:32] and the power in the life of God went
[1:28:34] completely out of it
[1:28:36] Ichabod was written over the door the
[1:28:38] glory of the Lord has departed and what
[1:28:40] would happen is they would have a dead
[1:28:41] Gospel of their own making and the
[1:28:42] people will be damned by it and that's
[1:28:44] what we see today sincere people damned
[1:28:47] because it's men that say it's not the
[1:28:49] way it used to be
[1:28:51] look at it
[1:28:52] the Baptists don't even believe in the
[1:28:54] Holy Ghost
[1:28:55] and that's the only thing that's going
[1:28:57] to get you across the finish line is the
[1:28:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] look at look at the Catholics they don't
[1:29:03] believe it
[1:29:04] certainly not as we do if they do
[1:29:07] all of them what is it they want an
[1:29:09] aspect of it they want a portion of it
[1:29:10] because that's what they identify with
[1:29:12] but they don't want the whole thing and
[1:29:14] that's why they deny Christ this is what
[1:29:16] John said he said beloved believe not
[1:29:18] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[1:29:20] they are of God because many false
[1:29:22] prophets are gone out into the world
[1:29:24] hereby know ye the spirit of God every
[1:29:27] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:29:29] is come in the flesh is of God
[1:29:34] he notice he didn't say has come he said
[1:29:36] is come present tense today
[1:29:39] he was there Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ
[1:29:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:46] you've got to believe that he wasn't
[1:29:47] just there two thousand years ago you
[1:29:49] got to believe he's here today in flesh
[1:29:50] in you and I
[1:29:52] that's what we're resting in that's what
[1:29:54] we're trusting in is that the same thing
[1:29:55] that he had is the same thing that we
[1:29:57] have we have it in part he had it in
[1:29:59] fullness we know he says in every spirit
[1:30:01] that confesses not that Jesus Christ has
[1:30:03] come in the flesh is not of God and this
[1:30:06] is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye
[1:30:08] have heard that it should come and even
[1:30:11] now already is it in the world
[1:30:16] what's he trying to get us to see
[1:30:18] he's saying find your place in that word
[1:30:22] recognize what Christ was and recognize
[1:30:24] you're the exact same thing
[1:30:27] find your place in the word under grace
[1:30:30] to give you Faith to step into it and
[1:30:33] God will bless you with the Holy Spirit
[1:30:34] and it'll bring you to full
[1:30:35] manifestation amen well we'll become
[1:30:37] that word by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:39] in our life what was the Life of Christ
[1:30:41] for to give us assurance that the
[1:30:43] process works
[1:30:44] that the power is there
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:48] that there's something here where we
[1:30:49] don't have to stay in our current
[1:30:51] condition
[1:30:51] that we don't have to be overcome by
[1:30:53] this flesh that we don't have to be
[1:30:54] mired in the things that hold us back
[1:30:56] but we can have something that raises us
[1:30:58] up like The Lily out of the muck that we
[1:31:00] spoke of last service
[1:31:02] but if we look at the outward if we look
[1:31:04] at the the public show Christ's most
[1:31:06] amazing Ministry was pre-adoption
[1:31:09] pre-adoption
[1:31:12] he had the signs and wonders he walked
[1:31:14] on water
[1:31:15] Walked on Water Church before he was
[1:31:17] ever adopted
[1:31:19] that shows what the power of God can do
[1:31:21] in US
[1:31:23] but it was bringing him to a greater
[1:31:25] place but the public show Ministry was
[1:31:27] all pre-adoption
[1:31:29] it was all pre-adoption
[1:31:31] and then God steps down he starts to do
[1:31:34] something with them
[1:31:35] why because that wasn't his only purpose
[1:31:37] it was building up to his real purpose
[1:31:41] go back to Luke 9. this is speaking of
[1:31:43] when he's on the mountain there says and
[1:31:45] as he prayed the fashion of his
[1:31:46] countenance was altered and his raiment
[1:31:48] was white and glistening and behold
[1:31:49] there talked with him two men which are
[1:31:51] Moses and Elias now you say what did
[1:31:53] they talk about
[1:31:56] was it this great uplifting conversation
[1:31:59] it says who appeared in glory and spake
[1:32:01] of his decease which he should
[1:32:03] accomplish at Jerusalem they spoke of
[1:32:05] his death
[1:32:07] in the adoption ceremony aft and that
[1:32:10] adoption ceremony he steps into his
[1:32:12] ultimate purpose he steps into the great
[1:32:15] role of Redeemer of Savior
[1:32:18] and what they're doing is they're
[1:32:19] telling him and they're confirming to
[1:32:21] him the word of what's going to happen
[1:32:22] to him at Jerusalem Jesus has already
[1:32:25] talked about this he knows it's going to
[1:32:27] happen he's told the disciples about it
[1:32:28] but now these two prophets come and they
[1:32:30] say this is the last stage of your
[1:32:32] ministry this is the final portion and
[1:32:35] this is what you required adoption for
[1:32:37] because without adoption you would not
[1:32:39] have been able to do it Christ had to be
[1:32:41] built up the same way we were what was
[1:32:43] it they were saying here is your true
[1:32:45] Kingdom Purpose here is the Apex here's
[1:32:47] the peak of your ministry is going to be
[1:32:49] to go to Jerusalem and die
[1:32:52] amazing
[1:32:54] not go and raise the dead from somebody
[1:32:57] else not go and feed another five
[1:32:58] thousand not go and and fly around the
[1:33:01] temple or something no your greatest
[1:33:03] Ministry is going to be that you're
[1:33:04] going to lay down your life for the sins
[1:33:06] of the world
[1:33:08] what is it as soon as this happens
[1:33:09] Christ moves and everything focuses on
[1:33:12] getting him to Jerusalem
[1:33:15] the signs and the Wonders minimal just a
[1:33:17] couple here and a couple there
[1:33:19] died away we saw it in the prophets
[1:33:20] Ministry did we not
[1:33:22] that he had the signs and the wonders
[1:33:24] for 20 odd years 25 years
[1:33:27] 30 years maybe 20 years certainly 15
[1:33:29] years and then what happens is the word
[1:33:31] opens
[1:33:32] and all of a sudden he says I'm making a
[1:33:34] turn
[1:33:35] and everything changes after that
[1:33:37] same thing happened with Christ
[1:33:39] Everything Changes
[1:33:40] what was he doing he was paying the
[1:33:42] price coming to pay the price for our
[1:33:43] sins and redeem us he spent three of
[1:33:46] those years showing us what it meant to
[1:33:48] be a Son of God showing us what the
[1:33:50] first Adam should have done and he was
[1:33:52] showing power and authority and Dominion
[1:33:54] Adam had all of those things in the
[1:33:56] creation he was showing us what Adam
[1:33:58] looked like he was showing us what our
[1:33:59] lives can look like he was showing us
[1:34:01] that we don't have to live in in pain
[1:34:03] and in in suffering from the things of
[1:34:05] this flesh that we don't have to be
[1:34:07] bound up by the things we don't have to
[1:34:08] live a failed or a defeated life he was
[1:34:10] showing us all those things but that was
[1:34:12] just proving who he was
[1:34:15] proving he could go through life
[1:34:16] sinlessly so that he could what be the
[1:34:19] acceptable lamb he spent all of those 33
[1:34:22] years proving he was the acceptable lamb
[1:34:24] and then God comes down and says I
[1:34:26] accept you
[1:34:27] you're it and God puts his stamp of
[1:34:29] approval on him and says you are the
[1:34:30] lamb
[1:34:31] you're the perfect lamb and I accept you
[1:34:33] as a sacrifice now go and do your job
[1:34:36] now do the ultimate thing that I've
[1:34:38] called for you
[1:34:40] everything he did to that point church
[1:34:42] was temporary
[1:34:44] that that that that young man that he
[1:34:46] raised in Maine
[1:34:48] he still died
[1:34:51] the sick that he healed they got sick
[1:34:53] later
[1:34:55] the food that he multiplied was digested
[1:34:58] and they still needed food the next day
[1:35:00] everything he did prior to that even
[1:35:02] raising of Nazareth Lazarus was
[1:35:05] temporary
[1:35:06] but now he's moving into an eternal work
[1:35:09] now he's moving into an eternal work
[1:35:12] and that's where we ought to see
[1:35:13] ourselves is that we are not only part
[1:35:16] of an eternal work we are the
[1:35:18] manifestation of an eternal work
[1:35:22] amen
[1:35:25] what did he show he showed the power of
[1:35:28] God
[1:35:29] and yet we still couldn't come back to
[1:35:31] God
[1:35:32] he showed what we could have
[1:35:34] but yet we couldn't have it
[1:35:36] he showed what we could do
[1:35:38] and yet we couldn't do it
[1:35:41] he had to redeem us back because his
[1:35:44] ultimate goal was redeem
[1:35:45] redeem
[1:35:47] not just show who he was but to show us
[1:35:50] who we are and that required Redemption
[1:35:52] that required us to be able to come back
[1:35:55] into the presence of God
[1:35:59] we look at all these things he did we
[1:36:01] talk about The Walking On The Water we
[1:36:02] talk about the multiplying
[1:36:04] those were wonderful things and I
[1:36:05] imagine those were shouting meetings
[1:36:09] can you imagine when they realized that
[1:36:13] the food was multiplying as they put
[1:36:15] their hand in
[1:36:17] can you imagine
[1:36:19] when that dead boy was raised in name
[1:36:22] Lazarus has been dead
[1:36:25] many days
[1:36:27] and they rolled a stone back and he
[1:36:29] comes out can you imagine the kind of
[1:36:31] services those were if I could put it
[1:36:33] that way
[1:36:35] and yet that's not the greatest thing
[1:36:38] that's not the greatest part of his
[1:36:39] ministry
[1:36:41] in all of those times
[1:36:43] Christ had great victories he had
[1:36:45] overcoming power he had great
[1:36:47] demonstrations of God in him
[1:36:50] and yet he was constantly tired
[1:36:54] he was so tired remember he could sleep
[1:36:55] in the boat when they thought they were
[1:36:57] going to drown
[1:36:58] he was constantly reviled he was rebuked
[1:37:02] he was rejected
[1:37:04] people tried to kill him
[1:37:06] it was constant stress and sorrow and
[1:37:09] yet the power of God was still with him
[1:37:12] yet the blessings of God were still with
[1:37:14] them and he still had great moments of
[1:37:15] Victory and power and overcoming and
[1:37:18] these different things
[1:37:19] you don't have to wait to adoption to
[1:37:21] overcome
[1:37:22] that's what God's doing is he's
[1:37:24] overcoming you all the way through and
[1:37:26] when he gets you completely overcome
[1:37:29] that's when he adopts you
[1:37:31] but you're going to have habits taken
[1:37:32] away before you come to adoption
[1:37:34] you better have
[1:37:36] because that's the working of the Holy
[1:37:38] Spirit you're going to grow in Grace
[1:37:40] you're going to grow in knowledge you're
[1:37:41] going to grow in wisdom and God's going
[1:37:43] to use you in special ways
[1:37:45] but he's bringing you to a place where
[1:37:47] you'll be perfectly surrendered in every
[1:37:49] aspect amen
[1:37:52] why did Jesus Christ have to go through
[1:37:54] all of those things
[1:37:56] because he was going to have to be okay
[1:37:58] with more pain than any man had ever
[1:37:59] endured
[1:38:00] and ever will endure
[1:38:02] he had to be able to take the ultimate
[1:38:04] rebuke
[1:38:05] the ultimate rejection
[1:38:07] the ultimate shame
[1:38:09] crucified naked
[1:38:12] he had to be able to willingly keep
[1:38:14] himself at that whipping post and let
[1:38:16] them rip the muscles and the skin off
[1:38:18] his body until his bones showed through
[1:38:22] he had to endure a face being more beat
[1:38:24] up than any man's face has ever been
[1:38:25] beaten up
[1:38:27] willingly he had to have the character
[1:38:29] he had to have the commitment he had to
[1:38:31] have something in his life that was
[1:38:32] proven before he could ever do it
[1:38:36] and he couldn't have done it until then
[1:38:39] that's what adoption was it was saying
[1:38:41] you're ready to go do what I really
[1:38:43] brought you here for
[1:38:47] what is it he had to have the character
[1:38:48] to stay and go through that entire
[1:38:50] process and believe that the word that
[1:38:53] told him he had to die
[1:38:55] was as true as the word that says he was
[1:38:57] going to pick up his life again
[1:38:59] he had to have a faith to lay down his
[1:39:01] life and trust that God that Spirit
[1:39:03] would come and raise up that body all
[1:39:04] over again he had to believe that by raw
[1:39:06] unadulterated faith
[1:39:09] so he had to have he had to have
[1:39:11] something inside of him that held him
[1:39:13] and kept him through that entire process
[1:39:14] to bring him to the greatest Victory
[1:39:16] known to humanity
[1:39:18] the victory to lay down your life and
[1:39:20] pick it up again and Reign eternally
[1:39:24] think of this
[1:39:27] he's just the first one
[1:39:30] he's just the first one
[1:39:32] it's for you and I
[1:39:34] not just for him
[1:39:36] not just for the disciples
[1:39:38] that's the argument we hear from most of
[1:39:40] these things when it comes to the
[1:39:41] baptism of the Holy Spirit when it comes
[1:39:42] to the signs and wonders when it comes
[1:39:43] to all these things they say that was
[1:39:44] only for the apostles
[1:39:46] and anything true
[1:39:48] it's for Sons and Daughters of God alike
[1:39:52] yesterday today and forever because it's
[1:39:54] Christ in us the hope of glory doing all
[1:39:55] of these things
[1:39:57] Romans 8 says the spirit itself beareth
[1:39:59] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:40:01] children of God
[1:40:03] and if children then heirs Heirs of God
[1:40:06] and Joint heirs with Christ if so be
[1:40:08] that we suffer with him that we may also
[1:40:10] be glorified together for I reckon that
[1:40:13] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:40:15] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:40:17] that she shall be revealed where
[1:40:20] in US
[1:40:22] remember he says if the same spirit that
[1:40:24] raised Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:40:27] you it will Quicken your mortal body
[1:40:29] mortal
[1:40:31] mortal here and now today
[1:40:35] it's the same spirit amen you're called
[1:40:37] to walk off this Earth without seeing
[1:40:39] death just like Christ raised up and
[1:40:41] went
[1:40:42] we don't have to wait for a resurrection
[1:40:44] Enoch walked off
[1:40:48] he's a type of the Bride
[1:40:50] and that walk he knows the scripture
[1:40:53] the way it reads is Enoch walked with
[1:40:56] God and he walked and he walked and he
[1:41:00] walked and he walked and he walked and
[1:41:03] he walked
[1:41:05] brother Brown would say something like
[1:41:06] he said one day he says that one foot
[1:41:08] just kind of came up a little bit and he
[1:41:10] said you know what
[1:41:12] I might as well keep going
[1:41:16] why don't you start
[1:41:19] once you start keep going
[1:41:22] but you gotta walk
[1:41:23] you gotta walk
[1:41:25] you gotta walk you gotta walk
[1:41:28] keep going
[1:41:30] don't slack off amen
[1:41:33] listen he says there's a glory that
[1:41:35] shall be revealed in US
[1:41:37] that's not all future tense
[1:41:40] listen we sit here today
[1:41:42] and we are Paul said it's to the praise
[1:41:44] of the of the to the to the Gloria or
[1:41:47] the praise of his of the glory of his
[1:41:49] grace
[1:41:50] that's what's sitting here today we are
[1:41:51] to his glory right now
[1:41:54] we are to his glory right now but
[1:41:55] there's a greater glorification coming
[1:41:57] but don't ignore the glory that's in you
[1:41:59] right now that you can live as a son and
[1:42:01] a daughter of God that you can live in
[1:42:02] overcoming power that you can have
[1:42:03] victory over the world in the things of
[1:42:05] the world today and that there's a
[1:42:07] blessing in it and there's an enjoyment
[1:42:08] in it amen we see that adoption if we
[1:42:11] want to get down to the root of it
[1:42:12] adoption is about glorification
[1:42:16] and not glorifying you
[1:42:20] it's glorifying God through you
[1:42:23] because remember Jesus said I can only
[1:42:24] do what the father said
[1:42:26] I kind of do what he shows me it's about
[1:42:28] glorifying who the father through us
[1:42:31] but guess what you get some of that
[1:42:33] glorification
[1:42:34] because it's through you
[1:42:37] it's through you and so there's a
[1:42:39] benefit to you through all of this even
[1:42:40] as we get into the very end of these
[1:42:42] things amen
[1:42:44] Paul said as I said we're to the praise
[1:42:46] of the grace Glory of his grace let's
[1:42:49] Stand Together
[1:42:51] Stand Together
[1:42:56] we grow from babies and babies are
[1:42:59] helpless
[1:43:01] we looked at little Wesley Mark Coffey
[1:43:03] over there this morning he's helpless
[1:43:06] and you know what they say A baby is
[1:43:08] amazing if it can hold its head up when
[1:43:11] it's born Selena was amazing
[1:43:13] they marveled because they held her and
[1:43:15] the the nurse's hand just moved and
[1:43:17] Selena's head stayed up even though she
[1:43:18] was horizontal she said wow she's so
[1:43:20] strong
[1:43:22] is anybody odd
[1:43:25] or amazed that brother Dale can keep his
[1:43:28] head up today
[1:43:30] no because as adults keeping your head
[1:43:32] up is no big deal
[1:43:34] but for a child a baby a newborn baby
[1:43:36] keeping your head up is a is an absolute
[1:43:38] miracle and we see the first time that
[1:43:40] that baby can grab onto something and
[1:43:42] pull themselves up we say oh growing so
[1:43:45] fast so strong so amazing
[1:43:47] and then look out when they start to
[1:43:49] walk I mean wow we're just amazed and
[1:43:52] yet every single one of us can walk all
[1:43:54] day every day we could walk for 30
[1:43:55] kilometers today brother Joe if you and
[1:43:57] I said let's walk 30k today we do it and
[1:43:59] we wouldn't even think about it and yet
[1:44:00] that baby takes one step and we're wow
[1:44:02] amazed and the baby loves it
[1:44:05] the toddler loves it and then they move
[1:44:07] into the next thing and you know I've
[1:44:09] got my my video of Jensen over in BC and
[1:44:11] we had a little little small Nets that
[1:44:13] we put down in the garage and I've got a
[1:44:14] picture of him and he does the Alex
[1:44:16] eviction Slap Shot where he does the one
[1:44:17] time and he comes right down onto one
[1:44:19] and he fires it up like that and he's
[1:44:21] looking at the net and I'm right behind
[1:44:22] the net and the ball goes right up in
[1:44:24] the top Corner perfect shot
[1:44:26] yes
[1:44:28] amazed
[1:44:30] that's what's happening is God is
[1:44:32] growing us
[1:44:33] there are amazing moments where you say
[1:44:35] Glory
[1:44:38] I can overcome
[1:44:40] Glory
[1:44:42] I can humble myself
[1:44:45] Glory
[1:44:46] I can surrender
[1:44:50] he can use me
[1:44:52] you're just a little toddler brother
[1:44:54] John doesn't matter
[1:44:55] I'm growing in Grace I'm growing in
[1:44:58] Christ
[1:45:00] don't
[1:45:02] don't endure the journey
[1:45:04] don't just endure it see that there's a
[1:45:07] benefit in there amen the great test is
[1:45:10] not how far you can run or how fast it's
[1:45:12] will you run
[1:45:14] will you run you know we go through all
[1:45:16] the these times in school and our
[1:45:18] parents raise us and then we become 18
[1:45:19] and we get to choose what we want to do
[1:45:21] you know and the question is what are we
[1:45:23] going to do with it all
[1:45:25] I'll tell you what you're going to do
[1:45:26] with it what you've been doing with it
[1:45:29] until God changes you
[1:45:31] but how you were when you were 17 years
[1:45:33] 364 days and and 23 minutes and and you
[1:45:38] know the last second before you turned
[1:45:40] 18 whatever you did before 18 is what
[1:45:42] you're going to do after 18.
[1:45:44] but what's going to happen is as you
[1:45:45] step into responsibility
[1:45:48] you're going to forget to do things
[1:45:50] maybe you'll get your own apartment
[1:45:51] sister Delfina and you'll forget to do
[1:45:53] your wash the first week
[1:45:55] and then you'll go to school and you
[1:45:56] realize I don't have any clean clothes
[1:45:58] guess what you won't forget to do your
[1:46:01] wash again will you
[1:46:03] it's a rough experience but then you get
[1:46:04] to enjoy the benefits of taking care of
[1:46:07] yourself of having the clean clothes of
[1:46:09] having a Sanctified life if I could put
[1:46:11] it that way we make mistakes
[1:46:13] but what we do is we learn from those
[1:46:15] and we get the benefits and we get
[1:46:17] enjoyment from it amen God works through
[1:46:19] us what happens is we start to say I
[1:46:21] need to watch out for that
[1:46:24] that's a Temptation for me that's an
[1:46:25] issue for me
[1:46:27] and God starts to pull us through those
[1:46:28] things and all of a sudden we're
[1:46:30] starting to work for the kingdom not
[1:46:31] just for ourselves everything we did for
[1:46:34] school was for school and was for
[1:46:35] self-glorification really
[1:46:37] but once we finish school now we're in
[1:46:38] it for something else and it's supposed
[1:46:40] to be for the body of Christ listen to
[1:46:42] these last two quotes brother Brian says
[1:46:45] well that's where the church needs to be
[1:46:47] tonight it needs to be to a place that
[1:46:49] God will call you off somewhere and do
[1:46:51] what throw his glory over you spread his
[1:46:56] power upon you and place you into the
[1:47:00] body where when you speak something
[1:47:02] happens
[1:47:04] that's what the church is needing
[1:47:06] tonight but if our character goes down
[1:47:08] instead of going up
[1:47:10] how's he going to do it
[1:47:12] he says we've got to continue
[1:47:15] to believe every work of God
[1:47:18] and seek after righteousness and do that
[1:47:21] which is right in the sight of God
[1:47:24] when how often
[1:47:26] daily calling on him
[1:47:29] and daily about his work getting others
[1:47:33] to come into church trying to get
[1:47:34] somebody to come serve the Lord all the
[1:47:36] people you work for the Milkman the
[1:47:37] postal man the Iceman whoever it is all
[1:47:40] you come in contact with speak to them
[1:47:42] about the Lord speak it with seasonable
[1:47:44] words sweetly don't jump onto them just
[1:47:48] speak it with sweetness that they'll say
[1:47:50] say that lady's a real lady she spoke to
[1:47:53] me about the Lord that man I've never
[1:47:55] seen such a man he's the nicest man I
[1:47:57] ever met you know I'd like to have his
[1:48:01] religion
[1:48:03] daily calling on him
[1:48:06] my wife and I were as we were walking
[1:48:08] yesterday we were talking about this
[1:48:09] idea that
[1:48:12] we need to be refreshed in the presence
[1:48:15] of God
[1:48:16] that a Sunday morning service or
[1:48:18] Wednesday night service isn't enough but
[1:48:20] what we find is as you're walking with
[1:48:22] God and you're giving God time in your
[1:48:24] day-to-day life
[1:48:25] daily
[1:48:26] daily
[1:48:28] then you'll find that the answers come
[1:48:29] more easily you'll find that leadership
[1:48:32] comes more easily and you're sacrificing
[1:48:34] your time for a far greater benefit
[1:48:36] because when you're in the word and
[1:48:38] you're in the presence of God you slide
[1:48:40] more easily into his will
[1:48:42] and there's a great there's there's a
[1:48:44] great benefit there's a great blessing
[1:48:45] to being able to find the will of God
[1:48:47] for your life personally
[1:48:49] and being able to be used and having the
[1:48:51] right response you know it's it's it's
[1:48:53] funny how
[1:48:55] you know I I speak of of my issues with
[1:48:58] bad drivers and we experienced a number
[1:49:00] of them on the way to church this
[1:49:01] morning
[1:49:02] and
[1:49:04] you know when when you're dealing with
[1:49:05] and the thing is they don't know they're
[1:49:06] bad drivers and that's the hardest part
[1:49:09] but we're dealing with people that don't
[1:49:10] know they're bad drivers and when it
[1:49:12] comes to God
[1:49:13] but you know the first thing that
[1:49:15] because I said the Lord Lord I don't
[1:49:16] like this temper I have towards these
[1:49:18] people there's too many of them I'll
[1:49:19] always be unhappy if I'm on the road
[1:49:21] I said Lord you got to take it away from
[1:49:22] me you know the first thing he did he
[1:49:24] made me have a couple bone-headed
[1:49:26] moments on the road he let me make a
[1:49:28] couple mistakes and that one got me
[1:49:30] humble to realize that they're not all
[1:49:33] stupid
[1:49:33] otherwise that makes me stupid
[1:49:35] and they're not all you know uh
[1:49:38] inexperienced because I was experienced
[1:49:39] I still made the mistakes but he humbled
[1:49:42] me down to do that
[1:49:43] so that I could put myself in their
[1:49:45] place and realize hey
[1:49:47] you needed some Grace there how about
[1:49:50] some Grace for them that's what he's
[1:49:51] saying here seasonable words can you
[1:49:53] imagine this
[1:49:55] somebody cuts me off nearly hits me and
[1:49:58] I pull up next to him and I'm
[1:49:59] gesticulating and yelling and rolling
[1:50:01] down my window because I want to have a
[1:50:02] conversation and then I run into him in
[1:50:04] that parking lot out there and I asked
[1:50:05] them to come in and hear the word of God
[1:50:06] you know what they'd say if that's your
[1:50:08] religion I don't want it
[1:50:11] right
[1:50:12] but what God has to do so many times is
[1:50:14] humble us to realize
[1:50:16] we've got to be at their level sometimes
[1:50:18] to understand where they're at
[1:50:19] to speak a seasonable word
[1:50:21] to touch them where they're at
[1:50:24] and bring them in
[1:50:26] to give them an opportunity amen not put
[1:50:28] pressure on them
[1:50:29] not to flash up sometimes the hardest
[1:50:31] thing we've got to do is give up our
[1:50:33] right for a harsh reaction for the sake
[1:50:35] of their soul
[1:50:38] for a chance to restore them back to
[1:50:40] bring them into life amen
[1:50:42] that's what we're looking for daily
[1:50:43] going about his work that's what we're
[1:50:47] going to talk about over the next few
