[39:54] lord your grace to them and be with us
[39:56] all we pray in jesus name amen you may
[39:59] be seated
[40:01] so just to give all my
[40:04] conditions here first
[40:08] this is this is all this all was quick
[40:11] and um
[40:12] you know so it's just put together
[40:15] i'm filling in for paul
[40:17] for sunday school and uh
[40:20] so this was kind of a carryover the next
[40:22] next uh he's gone for a month
[40:25] so i was filling in and we've done one
[40:27] already and this was going to be the
[40:29] second one on this subject so i did have
[40:32] some notes so i had to quickly
[40:34] at 12 o'clock uh put all these uh things
[40:38] uh uh together and uh it was quick so i
[40:42] just put in all those uh
[40:45] things first before we start
[40:49] so i was just gonna you know look at the
[40:51] uh
[40:53] the general principles here of
[40:55] the the scriptures we did talk last time
[40:58] in the sunday school about election and
[41:00] we talk about predestination
[41:02] and just those basic things that are in
[41:05] the message and in the word so we just
[41:07] want to one of the things was the blood
[41:09] which is the
[41:11] just definitely a basic component of all
[41:13] of this and just to help us understand
[41:15] these things
[41:18] so
[41:19] here we uh we want to
[41:24] so we want to understand you know it
[41:26] with these topics the the
[41:27] the uh
[41:29] uh
[41:29] really the
[41:31] to understand the foundation of which
[41:33] the everything is built on
[41:35] so
[41:36] i need my
[41:38] i'll get organized here yet
[41:41] this is probably not on is it
[41:47] takes a second okay
[41:50] so here
[41:52] just looking here
[41:53] in in genesis
[41:55] as we start with
[41:57] we talk about blood sacrifices and unto
[41:59] adam also and to his wife did the lord
[42:02] god make coats of skins and clothe them
[42:05] so it's it's talking about the sin that
[42:07] was in the garden of eden
[42:08] and we know that uh you know god set it
[42:11] up so that there wasn't any any blood
[42:13] but only when the sin was caused in the
[42:15] garden
[42:16] that they did come in with a blood
[42:18] sacrifice
[42:19] and there's no different today
[42:22] and the most important thing to remember
[42:23] is that you need a blood sacrifice and
[42:26] that did not change you know we're under
[42:28] that ever since the beginning
[42:30] so i
[42:32] uh so with this you know god has to see
[42:34] you clothed in in a sacrifice and the
[42:38] only sacrifice is blood
[42:40] so if i go here
[42:46] and almost all things are by the law
[42:48] purged with blood and without shedding
[42:50] of blood there is no remission that's
[42:51] basic
[42:52] so that didn't change with jesus christ
[42:54] our our sacrifice was the blood that was
[42:56] shed on crop on the cross
[43:00] and for the life of and in
[43:02] leviticus 17 11 for the life of the
[43:05] flesh is in the blood
[43:06] and i have given it to you upon the
[43:08] altar
[43:10] to make an an atonement for your souls
[43:13] for it is the blood that makes an
[43:15] atonement for the soul so the life is in
[43:17] the blood and that's why it had to be a
[43:18] fact a living sacrifice that had to die
[43:21] for your sin that's pretty basic all of
[43:23] us should know that anyway but the life
[43:25] is in that blood so when that blood it
[43:27] comes out of that sacrifice it's it's
[43:30] dead and it and it's a remission for
[43:32] your sins
[43:33] and in the old testament it was only for
[43:35] a year
[43:36] because it was an animal blood it wasn't
[43:38] it wasn't the blood
[43:40] they could not be redeemed by any
[43:42] anybody's blood it had to be an animal
[43:45] because no one could be a redeemer
[43:48] because everyone was born in sin
[43:51] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[43:53] speaking lie so
[43:55] it was trapped there in the old
[43:56] testament there was no one to do it and
[43:58] that gets me ahead so
[44:03] so here
[44:04] adam and eve you see sinned in the
[44:07] garden just to go through the through
[44:09] the first part in genesis
[44:11] and what did god do god performed the
[44:12] first sacrifice he went down
[44:15] with his daily daily uh a routine to go
[44:18] down to the
[44:19] the adam and eve in the garden and adam
[44:22] adam uh and he called for me couldn't
[44:25] find him and he said you know when he
[44:27] saw him he said you're naked and that
[44:28] was a you know the uh
[44:32] the giveaway point was that you know
[44:34] they were naked and they knew these
[44:36] things they had a revelation of
[44:38] something that they never had a
[44:39] revelation before since the last visit
[44:42] right so
[44:43] so that's what triggered them there is
[44:45] that they were naked
[44:47] and adam had
[44:48] adam had brother brian kind of alludes
[44:51] that brother man had access to brother
[44:53] brown adam had
[44:55] access to heaven
[44:56] you know he he could see these things
[44:58] and he could see he had ac of course he
[45:01] had control of the whole earth he had
[45:03] the deed and he was in control of the
[45:05] whole earth he wasn't in control of
[45:06] anything else it was just the earth it's
[45:09] not like he could he had
[45:11] control of the moon or something he
[45:12] didn't
[45:15] he just had control of the earth so
[45:19] so he could he could go back and forth
[45:22] it seemed you know in heaven and i
[45:24] that's not surprising because brother
[45:25] branham could a prophet could he could
[45:27] you know see things in heaven and see
[45:29] you know when he went on behind beyond
[45:31] the curtain of time so i'm sure adam did
[45:33] as the first son but eve didn't have
[45:35] that it seemed
[45:37] uh brother branham alludes you know she
[45:39] she didn't have that knowledge you know
[45:42] he did he knew he knew that when it
[45:44] happened he knew that you know that
[45:47] there was going to be a penalty here for
[45:48] this he understood it he understood the
[45:51] covenant there with the tree of life but
[45:54] she uh she didn't she only knew it by
[45:56] experience she she understood it then
[45:58] that okay this is this is not good and
[46:01] then of course we know that adam went
[46:03] with eve and because he was going to
[46:05] save her and it was a type of christ
[46:07] saving his bride and
[46:09] his life and
[46:11] his dna ended up in in eve and that
[46:15] because part of him was in her that god
[46:18] couldn't take her life right so that's
[46:20] what happened so
[46:21] so what he had to do was he had to to
[46:24] slay those those innocent
[46:26] animals and he had to and brother
[46:29] branham says they walked out of eden
[46:31] with those skins around them and it was
[46:34] slapping on their legs and blood was
[46:36] dripping down and they were covered with
[46:38] those skins
[46:40] and that that is and so god when he
[46:42] looked down at them he didn't see
[46:45] he didn't see the sin because if he sees
[46:47] the sin
[46:48] in that time he it would be death
[46:51] you know uh and
[46:53] we don't see it in our age because we're
[46:55] under grace
[46:56] so there's people who are walking around
[46:59] without us without a sacrifice and
[47:01] enveloped in a sacrifice
[47:04] for their sins that god cannot see
[47:08] and so believers ourselves you know we
[47:11] we had that covering and if you read
[47:13] that interview that private interview
[47:15] interview that's
[47:17] that i gave out last time
[47:19] uh to the sunday school class
[47:22] he's talking with sister georgia bruce
[47:25] and it was before a sermon
[47:27] and uh it must have been uh recorded
[47:30] accidentally anyway they they
[47:32] transcribed it and it's about two pages
[47:34] long and it it's talking to the sister
[47:37] who she feels she's asking brother
[47:39] branham various questions but you know
[47:41] am i saved you know and he explains
[47:43] about that that god when he looks down
[47:45] at you sister he he only sees the blood
[47:48] he doesn't see your sins because you're
[47:51] covered with the blood right and you
[47:53] have to be like that and there's there's
[47:55] if he didn't then he he has to bring
[47:58] judgment upon that person but like i
[48:00] said in this age he doesn't because
[48:03] we're under grace
[48:05] and uh so what happens is is when you
[48:09] leave this earth
[48:10] and you don't have that sin covering you
[48:13] go to a not so good place you go to hell
[48:16] right
[48:17] and you wait until your judgment and
[48:19] that's where you'll you'll stay
[48:22] and then if you're found guilty at the
[48:24] judgment then you are go go into the
[48:26] lake of fire
[48:28] but the believer doesn't because he
[48:30] doesn't have that sin he he goes into
[48:32] to uh into that six dimension
[48:35] with uh
[48:36] you know underneath the seventh
[48:38] dimension where god god is waiting for
[48:40] the rapture really of all the church
[48:43] that's where we go but once grace
[48:44] finishes on this earth that's it god
[48:47] comes and he'll destroy
[48:49] he'll destroy because he has no covering
[48:50] and death i guess we we just basically
[48:52] pretty well understand that
[48:56] so adam knew that death was the answer
[48:59] and um
[49:01] and that
[49:02] you know they had left the garden
[49:04] and they
[49:06] uh
[49:06] they had no longer access to the garment
[49:08] and things changed things changed the
[49:11] line that was nice to them is not nice
[49:12] to them no more
[49:14] and they they really became adam would
[49:16] become like us and like you would you
[49:18] know uh not have that
[49:20] mediator anymore between you and you
[49:23] would you would uh not be sure that god
[49:25] is speaking to you or not being i'm sure
[49:27] adam went into that mode you know he
[49:29] wasn't sure all the time and he had to
[49:30] make sure however we make sure and
[49:32] that's the way it was you know and of
[49:34] course uh you know that made it we can
[49:36] relate to that for sure
[49:38] so here
[49:40] he went and found two animals as i said
[49:42] and god killed those animals then he
[49:44] took the skins of those animals and he
[49:45] wrapped adam and eve with skins and that
[49:48] was the first sacrifice because without
[49:50] the shedding of blood there is no
[49:51] remission i should have just clicked
[49:52] this
[49:54] blood
[49:55] had had to be shed doesn't change it
[49:58] hasn't changed since that's the covenant
[50:00] we're under
[50:01] god had said this day you eat thereof
[50:04] that day you die
[50:06] something had to die something had to
[50:07] pay the price
[50:09] and it had to be blood because why in
[50:11] leviticus the life was in the blood god
[50:14] could could have taken adam and eve and
[50:16] smitten them dead but they would
[50:18] but where would the rest of god's seed
[50:20] come from so he couldn't eliminate those
[50:22] because that's where you know it started
[50:24] and this that's where the life was going
[50:26] to come for the rest of the population
[50:27] of the earth they were all supposed to
[50:29] come through adam and eve
[50:32] and god took the animals and killed them
[50:34] and he took the skins and he wrapped his
[50:36] children in those skins they left the
[50:38] garden of eden like that and then when
[50:40] god looked at adam and eve what did he
[50:42] see he saw the sacrifice this is a this
[50:44] is our first review
[50:46] he saw that there was a blood atonement
[50:48] for their sins it didn't go away with
[50:50] their sins but it covered their sins so
[50:52] their sins still remain but they still
[50:54] had to do with sacrifice every time why
[50:56] because that it was only the blood of an
[50:58] animal and the life couldn't go back on
[51:00] the person to
[51:01] to to redeem them
[51:03] the blood they couldn't pay the price
[51:05] they couldn't fully pay the price god
[51:07] just accepted the sacrifice for a year
[51:09] which happened for four thousand years
[51:11] right through the law
[51:12] the blood of jesus christ is greater
[51:14] than that because it actually does
[51:18] does away with the sin
[51:21] and in the beginning god gave us the
[51:23] type from which everything else has to
[51:25] flow
[51:27] we have to be wrapped in our sacrifice
[51:29] you can raise your hand and accept jesus
[51:31] christ as your savior and that's the
[51:32] beginning of your process
[51:34] brother brian says if you raise your
[51:36] hand and accept jesus christ as your
[51:37] savior and you die at that point you
[51:39] have salvation
[51:40] but there is a progression in the life
[51:42] of a christian
[51:43] right
[51:44] there is a that's a start there is a
[51:47] progression
[51:48] you know you have to get to that last
[51:50] point which is adoption and you get the
[51:52] you get the authority of god in your
[51:54] life right
[51:55] you go from accepting christ as your
[51:57] savior and you're convicted of your sins
[51:59] and you begin to sanctify your life and
[52:01] you do a lot of that work through the
[52:03] help of you know the holy spirit right
[52:04] going through there
[52:06] and you start to clean your life up and
[52:08] make it more acceptable
[52:10] unto god and that's part of the that
[52:12] process and the progression of the life
[52:14] of a christian and we should have all
[52:15] experienced that but we're all at
[52:17] different levels and the holy spirit
[52:19] is working in our lives amen
[52:22] and that's good
[52:24] see where i am here
[52:30] usually with the sunday school i do give
[52:32] out a handout and a lot of this is the
[52:33] handout so i'm just gonna i'm using it
[52:35] here
[52:36] so cain also uh
[52:38] wanted to watch cain and abel also
[52:40] wanted to worship
[52:42] worship god and and cain did as well and
[52:45] kane is almost like he was a hard worker
[52:47] and he was a worker in the field he was
[52:49] almost like esau he reminded me of esau
[52:51] and a part of them
[52:53] desired this and came
[52:56] uh abel kept to sheep and kane worked in
[52:58] the field and he knew and and and cain
[53:02] uh and abel knew that it was blood he
[53:04] had the revelation that it was blood
[53:06] and and but god and god had respect unto
[53:09] abel when he's when god accepts that
[53:11] sacrifice he gives respect unto that
[53:12] person right you know and when you say
[53:15] when you uh accept it you know he has
[53:18] respect unto you
[53:20] and why did why did uh god refuse
[53:24] uh because it shows election and the
[53:27] only access i have to god is through
[53:29] jesus christ that's the only access
[53:32] through the blood he god sees the blood
[53:35] and
[53:37] only through the blood that i can even
[53:39] approach him
[53:40] and it's through through the sacrifice
[53:43] on calvary
[53:45] and if i have a need i go to calvary i
[53:47] go back to calgary we can never forget
[53:49] calvary calvary is the most important
[53:52] thing everything was done at calgary
[53:54] calgary cavalry
[54:00] calvary
[54:02] everything was done there i for i didn't
[54:04] forget i just forgot how to say it
[54:06] that's the difference
[54:08] so
[54:09] you know when you know we
[54:11] we are entitled to everything that
[54:13] christ died for
[54:14] you know at calvary so if he if you uh
[54:17] read isaiah 53
[54:19] and
[54:20] he was he
[54:22] you know by stripes were healed you know
[54:24] those stripes that he took on that day
[54:26] you know we were healed by that we can
[54:27] claim that everything that he died for
[54:30] there
[54:30] he
[54:31] he i thought you had a question then
[54:34] uh i you know you can claim every
[54:37] everything that he he uh he said he died
[54:40] for then right you can go back there any
[54:42] time it doesn't matter and he will honor
[54:44] it right he will honor it if you ask
[54:46] and that's where you go you still go to
[54:49] calgary calgary cavalry
[54:55] calvary
[54:57] i'll never forget it
[55:03] he's translating all that is he
[55:12] so anyway with noah the next was noah
[55:15] and just not going to spend much time
[55:17] here i know but
[55:18] god brought that rain on no it was a it
[55:21] was a destruction it was a
[55:23] judgment and
[55:26] you know
[55:27] and
[55:28] in that case there
[55:30] uh with noah he uh
[55:33] you know he
[55:35] he
[55:36] had destroyed the earth by by water and
[55:39] he had promised that he wouldn't do that
[55:40] anymore
[55:41] and then when he looked down when it
[55:43] when it rains now and he looks down he
[55:45] he there's a there's a rainbow i saw one
[55:47] the other day
[55:48] and when he looks and he looks through
[55:50] that rainbow and he reminds him of his
[55:51] covenant so you know that's what that's
[55:53] what happened in in that day
[55:55] so he's under that and we're under that
[55:57] covenant still today
[56:00] so with job job sat down on the ashes
[56:03] so 9 30 30 33. he didn't know what was
[56:06] wrong
[56:07] job didn't know what was wrong there was
[56:08] a conversation in heaven between god and
[56:10] satan and he didn't and they they knew
[56:12] what was going on but job didn't know
[56:14] what was going on true through all his
[56:16] trials and judgments and everything that
[56:18] he went through
[56:19] and he he ended up
[56:22] he ended up
[56:24] sitting on those ashes from the
[56:25] sacrifices right because he believed
[56:27] that he was he was covered he had done
[56:30] what god required right and and that's
[56:32] where he stood and sat in those ashes
[56:34] and threw ashes on himself and dealt
[56:36] with all his uh other people who came
[56:38] visit
[56:39] so if i wash myself with snow water and
[56:42] make my hands never so clean yet shall
[56:46] thou plunge me in the ditch and my own
[56:48] clothes shall afford me if he is not a
[56:50] man as i am that i should answer him and
[56:54] we should come together in judgment
[56:56] neither is there any days man be betwixt
[56:59] us that might lay his hand upon his book
[57:02] both what's a daiseman anybody know
[57:04] it's a mediator right he didn't have a
[57:07] mediator so it was him and god and he
[57:09] there was no one in between
[57:10] and he thought he had done the sacrifice
[57:12] but now he didn't know and he said if i
[57:14] had a mediator to explain this to me
[57:16] right
[57:19] in genesis it says and behold the word
[57:21] of god came unto him saying
[57:23] thou shalt not be thine
[57:25] air but he he that shall come forth out
[57:28] of thine own bowels shall be thine ear
[57:31] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[57:34] look now toward heaven and tell the
[57:36] stars if thou be able to number them and
[57:39] he said unto him so shall thy seed be
[57:41] and he was believed in the lord and
[57:43] accounted it to him in righteousness
[57:46] right talk about abraham here
[57:50] here's my notice my animations now god
[57:53] uh
[57:54] so with job he went to the place where
[57:56] he offered his sacrifices to god because
[57:58] that's where that's what he relied on
[58:00] right
[58:01] and god made a covenant with abraham but
[58:03] with abraham it was all unconditional
[58:06] talking about this genesis 15. so
[58:09] that that is the covenant that we're
[58:10] under now right we're not under the law
[58:14] the law ended on calvary right at that
[58:16] day that's the law was over the old
[58:18] testament was over the new testament
[58:20] started on pentecost right
[58:23] and it all ended there that covenant and
[58:25] the old covenant and the new covenant
[58:28] so there was there was no
[58:30] adam was
[58:31] abraham never
[58:33] never had a conditional covenant up to
[58:35] that time and almost every time since
[58:38] there was a condition so if you do this
[58:40] then this will happen if you sin you
[58:42] will be well you have to pay for that
[58:44] sin right but
[58:46] abraham never never did that although he
[58:48] was in the flesh and he still had a
[58:49] sacrifice he still had to do that part
[58:51] of it but his condition his covenant
[58:54] that he had with god was was not quite
[58:56] so we see in
[58:58] in there and i won't read it but you see
[59:01] they had the
[59:02] the agreement and when in the in in
[59:05] those times when they had an agreement
[59:06] they would take an animal and sacrifice
[59:08] an emerald cut it in two and they would
[59:10] sit in between it and they would make
[59:12] their covenant whatever it is however
[59:14] they had it and they would tear it and
[59:15] one would have the other and then if you
[59:17] went against that covenant you would be
[59:19] like that dead animal on the side that
[59:21] would be your punishment right if that
[59:23] happened right but in this case you
[59:25] remember when he when he sat down with
[59:27] abraham in that in that scene in genesis
[59:30] you know
[59:31] abraham went to sleep
[59:33] and because god did it all
[59:35] you know there was still the sacrifice
[59:37] and everything but
[59:38] abraham didn't partake because he had no
[59:42] there's nothing he had to do it was
[59:44] going to be done and it's because he
[59:46] believed
[59:47] right and and we're under that covenant
[59:49] now
[59:50] we're under because of the royal seed
[59:51] that was given to the raw seed and we're
[59:53] under the royal seed so we have to come
[59:56] it's unconditional we
[59:58] it's totally totally in god's hands as
[1:00:02] long as we believe
[1:00:03] so the thing is that we have to do is
[1:00:05] believe right and if you believe you do
[1:00:08] what is expected of you right and he
[1:00:11] he you know he has respect unto you once
[1:00:14] you believe and adam could believe
[1:00:17] abraham could believe
[1:00:18] he didn't have any trouble believing
[1:00:20] there wasn't a time having made mistakes
[1:00:23] but we if we go to hebrews 11 and
[1:00:25] there's no mistakes there right he
[1:00:27] doesn't look through that he looks
[1:00:28] through that covenant and that sacrifice
[1:00:30] and he saw
[1:00:33] abraham as righteous even then when he
[1:00:35] was dealing with
[1:00:36] with
[1:00:39] sarah
[1:00:40] and sarah laughed you know god said why
[1:00:42] did you laugh and then there was another
[1:00:44] point where abraham laughed and god
[1:00:46] didn't say nothing right because he was
[1:00:47] righteous
[1:00:56] so it all relied on god god
[1:00:58] god declared the whole covenant relied
[1:01:01] on god
[1:01:02] he made it with himself and do you think
[1:01:04] that was going to going to be broken if
[1:01:06] he makes a covenant with himself it's
[1:01:08] his word is never going to be broken and
[1:01:10] and we're that's what we rest on today
[1:01:13] we're under that covenant right
[1:01:14] you know if you read
[1:01:16] romans 4
[1:01:17] god declared abraham righteous because
[1:01:19] you have believed the promises i am
[1:01:22] declaring you righteous
[1:01:26] from that point on abraham was always
[1:01:28] considered righteous and when you accept
[1:01:30] jesus christ god looks at you
[1:01:33] and you are righteous he has declared
[1:01:35] you righteous if he's already made the
[1:01:37] judgment call that you you are righteous
[1:01:39] then you are you are because he says you
[1:01:42] are it's not about it's not about you
[1:01:44] but it's about him whatever god gives
[1:01:46] you he'll never take away from you
[1:01:48] if he gives it to you if he gives you
[1:01:49] the holy ghost you'll never take it away
[1:01:51] you cannot he can't he will never take
[1:01:53] it back it's yours forever it's just
[1:01:55] like the lutherans they have
[1:01:56] justification once they gave them
[1:01:58] justification they still believe in
[1:01:59] justification they're still justified
[1:02:01] and they will never take it back now
[1:02:02] they didn't move on
[1:02:04] but they didn't the methodists you know
[1:02:06] and sanctification they still have it
[1:02:08] they believe it they'll preach it they
[1:02:10] still do it and god counts it to them
[1:02:12] for righteousness right because they
[1:02:14] didn't believe it you know in those days
[1:02:16] right and they still believe it today
[1:02:18] and same with the pentecost they had the
[1:02:21] the gifts of the holy ghost right they
[1:02:23] didn't have the person but they had the
[1:02:25] the gifts of the person right in that
[1:02:27] day and they still hadn't right
[1:02:29] we all know that right and he'll never
[1:02:31] take him back
[1:02:32] he'll never take it back and you have
[1:02:33] the token the token life it's the person
[1:02:37] the person of god right and he'll never
[1:02:39] take it back if you've got it you never
[1:02:41] have to worry about god taking anything
[1:02:43] like that back
[1:02:45] and that's a blessing
[1:02:46] blessing
[1:02:49] and if you have the holy ghost he says
[1:02:51] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:02:52] redemption you are sealed you have the
[1:02:55] holy ghost and all you have all you have
[1:02:57] to have is the holy ghost and how do you
[1:02:59] get the holy ghost acts 2 38 hasn't
[1:03:01] changed right
[1:03:02] and it's still today
[1:03:09] so now we get to the law
[1:03:13] talking about the blood sacrifice right
[1:03:15] just the focus here today
[1:03:17] for thou art and holy people unto the
[1:03:20] lord thy god the lord thy god has chosen
[1:03:22] thee to be a special people unto himself
[1:03:25] we can put ourselves into that
[1:03:27] in this covenant in the new covenant
[1:03:30] he's talking about the old covenant here
[1:03:31] now
[1:03:32] the lord did not set his love upon you
[1:03:35] nor choose you because you were more in
[1:03:37] number than any people for you were the
[1:03:39] fewest of all people
[1:03:41] it sounds familiar but because the lord
[1:03:43] loved you and because he would keep the
[1:03:46] oath which he had sworn unto your
[1:03:47] fathers has the lord brought you out
[1:03:49] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[1:03:52] of the house of
[1:03:54] abandonment for the hand of pharaoh king
[1:03:57] of egypt and redeemed that means to take
[1:04:01] take away from the control that you're
[1:04:02] in and take you out of that right so
[1:04:04] that's what that's for redemption
[1:04:07] god didn't call us because we're the
[1:04:09] biggest number of people or because
[1:04:10] we're the richest of people for sure
[1:04:12] right
[1:04:13] but we're in the mind of god right we're
[1:04:16] in the mind of god in the beginning and
[1:04:17] he he calls you up because he loves you
[1:04:20] he loves you why else would he do he he
[1:04:22] didn't have any other reason only that
[1:04:24] he loved you
[1:04:26] he called us because he loved us as i
[1:04:28] said
[1:04:30] when you look at predestination why does
[1:04:33] god love you it's because you're part of
[1:04:34] him right we went through that in our
[1:04:36] sunday school
[1:04:37] in exodus and moses came and called for
[1:04:40] the elders of the people and laid before
[1:04:42] their faces all those words which the
[1:04:44] lord commanded him and all the people
[1:04:47] answered together and said all that the
[1:04:48] lord has spoken we will do and moses
[1:04:51] returned the words of the people unto
[1:04:54] the lord so that was their covenant so
[1:04:56] everything that you said we would do we
[1:04:58] will do that's if then right else
[1:05:01] you know so it's not
[1:05:03] not like abraham this wasn't you know
[1:05:04] this was a different covenant they
[1:05:06] wouldn't believe so he set up a law so
[1:05:08] they would further try to understand god
[1:05:11] and he just dumped it on them with the
[1:05:13] 100
[1:05:14] 614 rules and they could never keep it
[1:05:17] they could never keep it all
[1:05:19] and there was no redemption
[1:05:21] there was no redemption in it because it
[1:05:22] was the same sacrifice year over year
[1:05:24] over year it would go on for eternity
[1:05:28] there was no way
[1:05:30] because there was no one able to redeem
[1:05:32] to redeem
[1:05:35] the law was imperfect the law never
[1:05:37] dealt with the problem of redemption
[1:05:40] the law merely showed what god was like
[1:05:44] and it took six thousand years to show
[1:05:46] what god was like right
[1:05:48] you know
[1:05:49] especially
[1:05:50] it is established a priesthood and the
[1:05:53] priesthood became a mediator
[1:05:55] so the so that's what god established in
[1:05:58] the law was a mediator someone between
[1:06:00] god and man right and that was the
[1:06:02] priest now we see what happened that
[1:06:05] became the one that joel was looking for
[1:06:07] that day star right that he didn't have
[1:06:10] but it was imperfect because the priest
[1:06:12] never fully comprehended god the priest
[1:06:14] really didn't do a great job at this
[1:06:17] they could never really comprehend the
[1:06:18] magnitude of god's judgment and his
[1:06:20] wrath
[1:06:21] they did the best they could by reading
[1:06:23] and studying the law but if you start
[1:06:25] looking at the priesthood in the old
[1:06:26] testament you find that they failed
[1:06:28] miserably in their job right you see all
[1:06:30] the
[1:06:31] things that were written about them in
[1:06:33] there and you know that they didn't
[1:06:36] they didn't fulfill what they were
[1:06:37] supposed to fulfill because they were
[1:06:39] human
[1:06:41] god had to raise up prophets he used the
[1:06:43] prophets then to bring the word because
[1:06:45] they couldn't count on the mediator to
[1:06:47] do it the priest
[1:06:48] so the prophets became the word
[1:06:50] because the priesthood had failed
[1:06:53] the government had failed everything had
[1:06:55] failed and god always has a voice in
[1:06:58] there
[1:06:59] he will always have a voice
[1:07:04] this is my
[1:07:06] no
[1:07:07] and moses came and called for the elders
[1:07:09] of the people and laid before their
[1:07:10] faces all these words and god commanded
[1:07:13] and all the people answered together and
[1:07:14] said all that the lord has spoken we
[1:07:16] will do
[1:07:17] i think i just read that tonight
[1:07:21] moses came down from the mountain and he
[1:07:24] rehearsed all the contract the law with
[1:07:26] the people the people made a statement
[1:07:28] all that the lord has spoken we will do
[1:07:31] there were there there were obligations
[1:07:33] that went with this covenant they said
[1:07:35] they will do it fine no problem
[1:07:38] he took the blood of the sacrifice and
[1:07:39] he sprinkled it upon the book
[1:07:41] upon the tabernacle upon the people and
[1:07:44] they were set apart for god for the
[1:07:47] sacrifice and that's what the blood does
[1:07:49] right the blood will will
[1:07:52] separate a people unto god right and in
[1:07:56] our day it's the same day it's the same
[1:07:58] thing in the new covenant the blood of
[1:08:00] jesus christ separates us
[1:08:02] right it separates us to god we're set
[1:08:06] apart for god so it's not the world and
[1:08:09] god it's god
[1:08:11] you know that's what that's what his
[1:08:13] expectation is
[1:08:14] by the sprinkling of the blood
[1:08:16] and we can't be bringing things in
[1:08:19] because
[1:08:20] eventually in our day god is gonna
[1:08:23] you've got the fullness of god
[1:08:25] in it's a token that's gonna be in you
[1:08:28] right the fullness of the life of god
[1:08:30] and so he is going to take control of
[1:08:32] you in this age that is that is what the
[1:08:35] prophet preached in the token it'll be
[1:08:38] the life of christ in us the full life
[1:08:40] not like pentecost that was only the the
[1:08:42] gifts part right it wasn't the full life
[1:08:44] it wasn't the full person it was the
[1:08:45] gifts of the person and in this age it
[1:08:48] will be the person
[1:08:49] and he he that means you will have to
[1:08:52] you will have to to uh die
[1:08:56] your your desires and your so that means
[1:08:58] you can't be in there with stuff that
[1:09:01] god doesn't want because he
[1:09:03] if you're still alive and you still have
[1:09:04] these desires that aren't his desires
[1:09:07] and you have these things that that are
[1:09:09] not what god expects because he you are
[1:09:11] separated unto god
[1:09:13] then he he will not come into you
[1:09:15] in in a fullness right you won't see
[1:09:18] that adoption in there he has to fully
[1:09:20] trust you in the last time
[1:09:22] so you can't bring things in with you
[1:09:24] and have these desires and you have a
[1:09:27] life to your own your life has to die
[1:09:28] your desires has to die so you have you
[1:09:31] have you have no desire for the the
[1:09:34] world and that's what he's saying
[1:09:35] because we're totally separated
[1:09:37] right we have to be in that in that
[1:09:40] in that way because god will not share
[1:09:43] the throne with you
[1:09:44] in you right he's only going to take it
[1:09:47] himself you have desire so so when it
[1:09:50] comes like we can't see the we can't see
[1:09:52] the future
[1:09:53] we can't see we can read the word or
[1:09:54] whatever and see what's god's going to
[1:09:56] happen but for my future i can't tell
[1:09:57] what i'm going to do
[1:09:59] you know i could look at you and say you
[1:10:00] got the holy ghost in it i wouldn't
[1:10:02] really know
[1:10:03] you know god doesn't god doesn't tell me
[1:10:06] you have to hold it looks like it but i
[1:10:08] don't really know god knows because he
[1:10:09] knows the future you could you could you
[1:10:11] you know
[1:10:12] you think someone's got the you've seen
[1:10:14] it in your own experience you've seen
[1:10:16] people and you think they got the holy
[1:10:18] ghost and they fall away and they
[1:10:20] couldn't have the holy ghost you know
[1:10:22] but we don't know it so you can't judge
[1:10:24] it you know you can't judge anybody it's
[1:10:26] only god knows
[1:10:28] and and god knows if you got the holy
[1:10:29] ghost
[1:10:30] and you know if you got the holy ghost
[1:10:31] and god doesn't tell anyone you know
[1:10:34] that you got it
[1:10:37] it's a it's a it's an individual affair
[1:10:40] so
[1:10:41] in this age
[1:10:42] you have to die you really have to die
[1:10:44] in this age because we'll come to a a
[1:10:47] period of adoption
[1:10:48] and adoption is your your name is under
[1:10:51] check right
[1:10:52] so the owner
[1:10:54] the owner the
[1:10:55] father has a business
[1:10:57] and he raises his son up they this is
[1:11:00] what brown uses as the example
[1:11:02] and he he authorizes
[1:11:05] it so that the son can write his name on
[1:11:07] the check and be just as good as the
[1:11:09] father so he has all the power
[1:11:11] and that's where we have to come
[1:11:13] right we have to come to that to that
[1:11:15] point where we can write our name on the
[1:11:16] check and if we say something then god
[1:11:19] will god make it come to pass right
[1:11:22] and you know branham had power in his
[1:11:24] life you could see it
[1:11:26] and and we talked about elijah you know
[1:11:28] elijah had power
[1:11:30] and when he he was uh
[1:11:32] tormented
[1:11:34] tormented by those children he called a
[1:11:36] bear out a couple of bears out to
[1:11:39] destroy those children he had power to
[1:11:40] do that and god permitted it
[1:11:42] burban said he shouldn't have right but
[1:11:45] he had power he had to
[1:11:46] hit the power to do that to speak it and
[1:11:48] it will come to pass right and brother
[1:11:50] brown had the same thing when he had
[1:11:51] those those kids in the
[1:11:55] those young people in the in the service
[1:11:58] and they were making out in the service
[1:11:59] and program said don't do that you know
[1:12:01] he said it three times and then the
[1:12:03] voice came to him and said you know
[1:12:06] whatever you say right and uh
[1:12:09] and he he said
[1:12:11] and he and it was quiet on the tape and
[1:12:13] he's thinking about it and he says i
[1:12:14] forgive you right
[1:12:16] and uh he he it was the same example as
[1:12:19] elijah with the children right you know
[1:12:22] it's something he didn't want to do but
[1:12:24] he had you have to have that
[1:12:26] those uh attributes of that humility and
[1:12:28] that control and all of those things in
[1:12:30] order to do that so
[1:12:32] so it's important
[1:12:35] and that's what we're trying to get to
[1:12:36] we're trying to get to where we have
[1:12:38] that power right
[1:12:40] hebrews for when moses had spoken every
[1:12:43] precept to all the people according to
[1:12:44] the law he took the blood of the calves
[1:12:46] and the goats and water with water and
[1:12:48] scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkle
[1:12:51] both the book and the people saying this
[1:12:54] is the blood of the testament which god
[1:12:56] has enjoined unto you
[1:12:59] so we are separated unto god by the
[1:13:00] sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ
[1:13:03] they are obligat there are obligations
[1:13:05] to the covenant
[1:13:08] it's not uh it's not obligations like
[1:13:10] you have to do this or you have to do
[1:13:11] this and i'll do this it's not that kind
[1:13:14] of conditional kind of obligation it
[1:13:16] takes it takes and it separates us onto
[1:13:19] unto him
[1:13:21] and there's expectations around that
[1:13:23] right we're expected to do to
[1:13:26] to do as you know as abraham did is to
[1:13:29] believe to believe god believe the word
[1:13:31] right and follow the word
[1:13:33] but he's not going to lay it right out
[1:13:34] for you
[1:13:35] and once you separate unto god there are
[1:13:37] certain expectations of the life that
[1:13:39] you will live and the things you will do
[1:13:41] there are and brother brian explained
[1:13:43] those things to us
[1:13:44] and you know in order for us to have
[1:13:47] that power you have to read
[1:13:49] the bible
[1:13:50] and you have to listen to the message
[1:13:52] you know and you have to
[1:13:54] to and those things are what build up in
[1:13:56] you and and you know like if someone is
[1:13:59] reading their bible and listening to the
[1:14:01] message and praying right and he gave
[1:14:03] you the simplest things to do read your
[1:14:05] bible and pray
[1:14:06] but it's so hard
[1:14:08] especially in this age because there's
[1:14:09] so many spirits that have been led out
[1:14:11] into our environment and you see that in
[1:14:13] revelation 9. and
[1:14:15] hell was opened up and all of these evil
[1:14:17] spirits came in and they're tormenting
[1:14:19] you
[1:14:20] and it's hard for you to have this
[1:14:21] presence of god around you all the time
[1:14:24] it'll you know it's like when brother
[1:14:25] brown you know he used to call up people
[1:14:27] and they'd uh
[1:14:29] they'd come up to him and there's that
[1:14:31] presence around them there's no there's
[1:14:33] no spares in coming in that presence in
[1:14:35] brother madam in the prayer line right
[1:14:37] and he and people would feel it and he
[1:14:40] said you feel that oh yeah i feel that
[1:14:41] right
[1:14:42] and you know you feel it and you you
[1:14:43] have great faith you believe right and
[1:14:46] in all those things but when they walked
[1:14:47] away
[1:14:48] get out of that presence and then boo
[1:14:50] you know i i don't know if i'm healed or
[1:14:52] not you know and they had doubt you know
[1:14:54] and that was that's the spirit you know
[1:14:56] and that's what happens and you meet
[1:14:58] people and i don't know if you find it
[1:15:00] yourself but you know if you're reading
[1:15:02] and praying you know a lot of times
[1:15:04] you're sitting down and if you're having
[1:15:05] fellowship and someone is saying
[1:15:07] something even if it's someone in the
[1:15:08] world or whatever and they're saying
[1:15:10] something then the scriptures come to
[1:15:11] your mind and messi a quote comes to
[1:15:13] your mind and there's another scripture
[1:15:15] and another scripture and you say this
[1:15:17] and you think this and you think you're
[1:15:18] constantly this uh these things are just
[1:15:21] coming into your mind because it's part
[1:15:22] of it
[1:15:23] right but you see other people who
[1:15:25] aren't doing it and they're sitting
[1:15:26] there and they're quiet you know they
[1:15:27] might be natural quiet on time but that
[1:15:29] that that is like that but you know
[1:15:32] there's there's people just don't have
[1:15:34] really anything to say you know and you
[1:15:36] just wonder if you know that what they
[1:15:38] need to do is just get into the word and
[1:15:40] get into the praying and you know if and
[1:15:42] i know it's tough a lot of times you
[1:15:44] know you don't
[1:15:46] always have the time because it's so
[1:15:47] busy but you know you really got to
[1:15:49] fight you know that's a battle right
[1:15:51] that's the greatest battle right
[1:15:54] but in this age it's tough you know
[1:15:55] brother brown says it himself you know
[1:15:56] uh years before
[1:15:58] it was different you know pray all night
[1:16:00] and
[1:16:01] they'd have meetings pray all night and
[1:16:03] whatever you know is
[1:16:05] long gone and so no one says it's going
[1:16:07] to be easy
[1:16:10] but it's you know
[1:16:12] you know we're in that covenant of
[1:16:13] abraham and you can rest on that you
[1:16:15] know that's that's the company we're not
[1:16:17] under the law
[1:16:18] you know we're under the
[1:16:20] covenant of abraham
[1:16:23] as christians we're expected to live and
[1:16:24] conduct ourselves in certain ways and we
[1:16:26] don't bring
[1:16:27] and we don't bring an approach upon what
[1:16:29] we say to be the covenant that we live
[1:16:32] under
[1:16:41] i seem good i must pull up here my
[1:16:44] it's going to bring all this up here
[1:16:48] so in leviticus and
[1:16:50] uh just
[1:16:51] let me look at this
[1:16:54] and if a sojourner
[1:16:57] or stranger wax rich by thee and the
[1:17:00] brother that dwelleth by him wax poor
[1:17:01] and sell himself unto the stranger so
[1:17:04] we're talking about now rejec uh kinsman
[1:17:07] redeemer this is what we're talking
[1:17:09] about here so as i said in the in the
[1:17:11] old testament there was no way to redeem
[1:17:14] out of that covenant right you had to
[1:17:16] sacrifice every year every year every
[1:17:18] year because every every human
[1:17:21] is
[1:17:22] is uh
[1:17:23] uh you know has sinned right
[1:17:25] every every human has been born in sin
[1:17:28] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:17:30] speaking lies so there's no one that can
[1:17:32] redeem it out because there's no one
[1:17:33] like that and the only one is a kinsman
[1:17:36] redeemer would have to be a human
[1:17:38] who could who had no sin and we know who
[1:17:41] that was but
[1:17:42] so in the in leviticus it does have a
[1:17:46] scripture in there and a law that would
[1:17:47] take care of that so verse 48 and after
[1:17:50] that he is sold he may be redeemed again
[1:17:52] one of his brethren may redeem him so if
[1:17:54] someone was sold and a relative could
[1:17:56] redeem him and in this case buy him ring
[1:17:59] either his uncle or his uncle's son may
[1:18:01] redeem him or any that is nigh of kin
[1:18:04] unto him and his family may redeem him
[1:18:06] or if
[1:18:07] or if he be able he may redeem himself
[1:18:09] if he can do it
[1:18:11] so because the law was not perfect it
[1:18:13] had to come to a place where the law of
[1:18:15] redemption had to take effect
[1:18:16] the law of redemption was spelled out in
[1:18:18] the kinsman redeemer brother preached on
[1:18:20] that we
[1:18:21] familiar with that but who would redeem
[1:18:24] us everyone that is born is born in sin
[1:18:26] none of us redeem anybody else if we die
[1:18:29] we die for our own sins
[1:18:31] so how would we die for someone else's
[1:18:33] sins
[1:18:34] you know we can't because we're sinful
[1:18:37] right and that's the scene in in
[1:18:39] revelation 5
[1:18:40] you know when there's the book is there
[1:18:41] and no one can take the book who can
[1:18:43] take the book and you know the prophets
[1:18:46] you know screamed out right
[1:18:49] but who could redeem us
[1:18:52] god had to come and become our kinsmen
[1:18:55] god had to take on human flesh and god
[1:18:57] in human flesh began to understand us
[1:19:00] god dwells in his realm and i imagine he
[1:19:03] had some inclination of what we were
[1:19:05] like you know so but he came right into
[1:19:07] our realm right so he understood things
[1:19:09] you know christ knew what it was like to
[1:19:11] lose a person they were close to like
[1:19:13] lazarus right
[1:19:14] you know he knew what it was like to be
[1:19:15] sick or tired or you know he learned
[1:19:17] those things god learned those things
[1:19:19] through being in that in that form of
[1:19:22] jesus christ right
[1:19:24] so god came down and he on the left and
[1:19:26] he came in jesus christ oh no at the end
[1:19:29] now we have a mediator we actually have
[1:19:32] someone that can sit there between us
[1:19:34] and god and he can reconcile us to to
[1:19:37] the two so now we have me all in the new
[1:19:39] in the old testament they didn't right
[1:19:42] they brought in the law they brought in
[1:19:43] priests but that didn't work right they
[1:19:45] had to bring prophets to straighten up
[1:19:46] the priests but in in this case now in
[1:19:49] when christ came on the scene there was
[1:19:51] a kinsmen redeemer so there was a way
[1:19:53] out
[1:19:54] and we reconciled through the blood of
[1:19:56] jesus christ so
[1:19:58] here's the whole world in sin and the
[1:20:00] only way that it could be redeemed is
[1:20:02] that some there had to be a sacrifice
[1:20:04] for people's
[1:20:06] sin
[1:20:06] and it couldn't be an animal because
[1:20:08] that wasn't that wasn't long term it was
[1:20:10] only for a year
[1:20:12] but if you had a person who had no sin
[1:20:13] and that life could go back on the
[1:20:15] person then the sins are purged forever
[1:20:18] past present future and that's what this
[1:20:20] this world need great design
[1:20:23] and he can reconcile us too we
[1:20:25] reconciled through the blood of jesus
[1:20:27] christ because that paid the price for
[1:20:29] our redemption that's the only thing
[1:20:30] that could
[1:20:31] pay the price according to leviticus 25.
[1:20:35] we reconciled through the blood of jesus
[1:20:36] christ because
[1:20:38] that paid the price of our redemption so
[1:20:40] the blood that was in christ that life
[1:20:43] that was in the blood of christ could
[1:20:44] come back on the believers we call it
[1:20:46] the holy ghost right to come back and
[1:20:48] and bring us to another level right it
[1:20:51] could reconcile us with god so christ
[1:20:54] was the mediator so that god could see
[1:20:57] us
[1:20:58] through the blood of a of a of jesus
[1:21:01] christ
[1:21:02] we reconciled through the blood of jesus
[1:21:04] christ because that paid the price for
[1:21:06] our redemption so that that need for the
[1:21:09] bloodside never changed it still is the
[1:21:11] same it was always the same god said it
[1:21:13] has to be the same rate to the end right
[1:21:15] that was the final thing which was
[1:21:17] necessary to bring us into the very
[1:21:18] presence of god until christ died it was
[1:21:21] not possible for a man to come
[1:21:23] for a man to approach into the presence
[1:21:25] of god it was not possible until jesus
[1:21:29] christ it very really there
[1:21:35] and the lord said unto the serpent
[1:21:37] because thou has done this thou art
[1:21:38] cursed above all the catalan above every
[1:21:40] beast of the field upon the belly shall
[1:21:42] though go and dust shall thou eat all
[1:21:44] the days of his life genesis 3 and i
[1:21:47] will put an enmity
[1:21:49] between thee and the people and between
[1:21:51] thy seed and her seed
[1:21:53] and it will bruise thy head and thou
[1:21:54] shalt bruise his heel she she didn't
[1:21:57] have a seed right a woman doesn't have a
[1:21:58] sea
[1:21:59] seed has to be put into her but god
[1:22:01] himself formed within mary
[1:22:03] what was necessary to bring forth the
[1:22:05] body that god could come in he became
[1:22:07] the woman's seed and god was his father
[1:22:11] philippians who being in the form of god
[1:22:13] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:22:15] god he was equal with god he was god he
[1:22:18] was god he was god in human flesh john 1
[1:22:21] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:22:23] word was with god and the word was god
[1:22:25] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:22:27] among us that's god god is the word
[1:22:29] right
[1:22:31] he was god if he wasn't god then he
[1:22:33] wouldn't he
[1:22:35] he
[1:22:36] he doesn't have salvation if he wasn't
[1:22:39] god then he we have nothing
[1:22:41] if you don't believe that jesus christ
[1:22:42] was the son of god and his blood wasn't
[1:22:44] sufficient for our sin then you have
[1:22:46] nothing right if you believe that many
[1:22:48] believe it does people in the message be
[1:22:51] everything rests upon the sacrifice
[1:22:53] everything without exception amen
[1:22:58] romans 5 17-19
[1:23:03] for if by one man's offense death
[1:23:06] reigned by one much more they which
[1:23:08] receive abundance of grace and not the
[1:23:10] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[1:23:12] life
[1:23:12] by one
[1:23:14] jesus christ therefore as by the offense
[1:23:16] of one judgment
[1:23:18] came upon all men to condemnation that
[1:23:20] was in the garden with adam
[1:23:23] even by the righteousness of one the
[1:23:25] free gift
[1:23:26] came upon all men unto justification of
[1:23:29] life for as by
[1:23:30] one man's disobedience many were made
[1:23:33] sinners but by the obedience of one
[1:23:36] christ shall many be made righteous
[1:23:38] right
[1:23:41] you are not righteous because of what
[1:23:42] you do
[1:23:43] you are righteous because of what he did
[1:23:45] there is no right you have no
[1:23:47] righteousness right
[1:23:49] it's not about us it's about him it's
[1:23:50] what he did
[1:23:52] so here it's just i've just shown that
[1:23:55] each one of these lines is a is just
[1:23:56] every year you know and there had been a
[1:23:58] sacrifice that they had a priest as a
[1:24:01] mediator and those blood sacrifices were
[1:24:04] every year but there was no end to it
[1:24:06] right
[1:24:07] there had had to be the the law
[1:24:11] that the law of redemption had to come
[1:24:13] into practice the kinsmen redeemer
[1:24:15] because the law couldn't take away sin
[1:24:17] the law could not redeem the law could
[1:24:19] take take by offering a sacrifice but
[1:24:22] the law would only cover sin for a year
[1:24:25] the priest would take the sin and roll
[1:24:26] it over to the next year in the next
[1:24:28] year on a day of atonement the priest
[1:24:30] would go in there and put the blood on
[1:24:31] the mercy seat and the sins would roll
[1:24:34] over by the next year
[1:24:37] then they would have to do that every
[1:24:39] year
[1:24:40] the sacrifice the animals didn't do the
[1:24:42] job it did not redeem the blood of jesus
[1:24:44] christ did what the law could not do i'm
[1:24:47] just going fast here just because we
[1:24:49] kind of touched that
[1:24:51] in whom we have redemption
[1:24:53] through his blood the forgiveness of sin
[1:24:56] according to the riches of his grace in
[1:24:58] ephesians we have that redemption true
[1:25:00] to blood
[1:25:03] in colossians 1 giving thanks unto the
[1:25:05] father which has made us
[1:25:07] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[1:25:09] of the saints in life who had delivered
[1:25:11] us from the power of darkness and has
[1:25:13] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:25:15] dear son in whom we have redemption
[1:25:18] through his blood even the forgiveness
[1:25:20] of sins right so paul teaching there
[1:25:22] that with that mediator
[1:25:25] the true mediator the true kinsman
[1:25:27] redeemer
[1:25:28] you know we have redemption we're not
[1:25:30] under that bondage anymore we're
[1:25:31] redeemed we're not under the control of
[1:25:33] something anymore of sin right and we
[1:25:35] have the life of god in us through the
[1:25:37] blood because the life is in the blood
[1:25:39] and the forgiveness of all our sins
[1:25:42] since we did
[1:25:43] the sins we doing the sins we will do in
[1:25:46] the future is all covered by the blood
[1:25:48] god doesn't see it he just looks down he
[1:25:50] sees the sacrifice he sees the blood of
[1:25:52] jesus christ and you see it in
[1:25:53] revelation 1 and you see jesus in there
[1:25:55] for the church ages mediating right
[1:26:00] right here
[1:26:01] you know
[1:26:04] so these are connected these verses when
[1:26:05] he died he only paid for our sins but he
[1:26:08] he not only paid for our sins but he
[1:26:10] redeemed us
[1:26:12] redeemed is to purchase and bring us
[1:26:13] back he brought us back into fellowship
[1:26:15] with god
[1:26:17] that's what reckless reconciliation is
[1:26:19] all about taking two opposing forces and
[1:26:22] taking them and bringing them back where
[1:26:24] they can have union and fellowship once
[1:26:25] again right so everything changed in
[1:26:28] year in that
[1:26:29] in the time when jesus was on the earth
[1:26:33] the whole thing was reversed that's what
[1:26:34] the blood of jesus christ did
[1:26:37] and then when jesus was on the cross he
[1:26:39] said his last words it is finished what
[1:26:41] was finished it was the plan of
[1:26:42] redemption it was finished
[1:26:44] satan had no control anymore right
[1:26:47] that's what the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:49] did but jesus wasn't finished he still
[1:26:51] had to go through
[1:26:52] you know the the uh seven church ages
[1:26:54] and that others but that segment of it
[1:26:57] was finished you know of his
[1:26:59] uh
[1:27:01] you know kinsmen redeemer function where
[1:27:03] he would be on the earth in flesh right
[1:27:06] of man
[1:27:07] that's what the blood of jesus christ
[1:27:08] did god used our redeemer he was the
[1:27:10] sacrifice for our sin he was the one
[1:27:12] that made it possible for us to get back
[1:27:14] into god
[1:27:22] colossians 1 13 who has delivered us
[1:27:24] from the power of darkness and has
[1:27:26] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:27:28] dear son amen you are no longer have to
[1:27:31] listen to the darkness you no longer
[1:27:33] have to listen to what satan tries to
[1:27:34] tell you turn him off how do you turn
[1:27:37] them off get into christ you get into
[1:27:39] christ and there's no receiving station
[1:27:40] for satan
[1:27:42] so if if you've got half of christ you
[1:27:44] know half of you is you know focused on
[1:27:46] that then you get half but if you get
[1:27:48] full
[1:27:49] you got you got the power
[1:27:52] you start praising him and worshipping
[1:27:54] him and all of a sudden there is a
[1:27:56] barrier
[1:27:57] satan's transmitting all the time but
[1:27:59] you get into him into christ and all of
[1:28:01] a sudden
[1:28:02] you shut it all off right and you can
[1:28:05] you can distance yourself from that he
[1:28:07] still attacked the flesh but it becomes
[1:28:09] less and less and that you're you're
[1:28:11] made more aware of it all the time and
[1:28:13] how he does it
[1:28:18] that's gonna i had a piece in there but
[1:28:20] i'm gonna skip that
[1:28:23] so i i went through this last sunday it
[1:28:25] was uh it was regarding election
[1:28:28] and it's just a story that that brother
[1:28:30] branham tells
[1:28:32] and i just want to use it just to show
[1:28:34] like you know there's
[1:28:36] brother brown used it as a
[1:28:38] if you heard him tell a story he he
[1:28:40] talked about the yard goods
[1:28:42] and he said he was explaining election
[1:28:45] and he put a god put a pattern down and
[1:28:48] this is the mind of god and that pattern
[1:28:50] was the elect that's who he chose that's
[1:28:52] the elect right
[1:28:54] and the rest it was the same material
[1:28:56] but it was he called it the remnant so
[1:28:58] we would call it the wise versions and
[1:29:00] the full foolish versions of water right
[1:29:02] here but it was all god's seed
[1:29:05] and
[1:29:06] and it was here it was it was all the
[1:29:08] same material but the remnant never came
[1:29:11] to the
[1:29:12] to receive the holy ghost
[1:29:14] so they didn't go in the rapture
[1:29:16] and it's the same as matthew 25
[1:29:19] and 1-13 where they came to the end and
[1:29:22] some had oil and some didn't have oil
[1:29:25] and
[1:29:27] uh
[1:29:28] i just for the next part there i just
[1:29:30] wanted to show it and i i just put it up
[1:29:32] here is what berber brown said before
[1:29:34] the foundation of the world in the mind
[1:29:36] of god he took one piece of goods and he
[1:29:38] lays it out and he lays a pattern of
[1:29:40] election on that and all inside the
[1:29:42] pattern our election
[1:29:45] and everything outside of pattern is
[1:29:46] remnant but it's all the same material
[1:29:49] it's all god it was all in god's mind
[1:29:51] and if it was it was in god's mind it's
[1:29:53] eternal and it will always be right it
[1:29:56] can't be it it'll go back to god in the
[1:29:59] end it's just the one doesn't get the
[1:30:01] moisture the moisture is a person the
[1:30:03] difference between pentecost head and
[1:30:05] what we've had under the opening of the
[1:30:07] seals is one is a gift and and under the
[1:30:10] opening of the seals one is a person one
[1:30:13] is the gift of the person the other is
[1:30:14] the person himself the only way the
[1:30:16] whole person is in you
[1:30:18] is if you are if you are dead to
[1:30:20] yourself token life the whole person is
[1:30:23] in you if you're dead and that's because
[1:30:25] he's not going to share a throne with
[1:30:26] you
[1:30:27] he will not share a throne with you you
[1:30:29] have to die
[1:30:30] inside yourself so your desires are gone
[1:30:33] for what i want right so if you're
[1:30:35] saying well i'm gonna go uh and do this
[1:30:38] and this well
[1:30:40] you know that could be your desire it
[1:30:42] might not be his desire right
[1:30:44] so you sit back and you say the lord
[1:30:46] willing right and you say lord
[1:30:49] i'm not sure which path to take here if
[1:30:52] you could help me you know just like
[1:30:53] david waited for the moving of the the
[1:30:56] mulberry trees right and then he went
[1:30:59] when he saw them all he's when he he
[1:31:01] went when he saw god move and show him
[1:31:03] where to go right and where we have to
[1:31:05] become to that like i want to do this
[1:31:07] and i want to do that and
[1:31:09] after a while uh well you could get down
[1:31:11] a rough road like that right
[1:31:15] and we've all done because of our
[1:31:16] desires this is why i saw this and
[1:31:19] someone's doing this and i want to do
[1:31:20] this well that's not the way it is for
[1:31:24] the adopted sons and daughters of god
[1:31:26] right
[1:31:26] the ones who have died you know in this
[1:31:29] world
[1:31:31] you're born again by believing every
[1:31:33] word of god
[1:31:34] read your bible and pray
[1:31:37] and that's not easy is it
[1:31:45] it was it was a god this is just
[1:31:48] swinging over a little bit now and it's
[1:31:49] almost coming to an end here but it's
[1:31:50] just changing a little bit here that's
[1:31:52] why i used that there it was a god man
[1:31:54] he was the son of god
[1:31:56] he was of the new creation brother
[1:31:58] brahms talking about new creation
[1:32:00] man and god met with
[1:32:02] met and joined he was the first of this
[1:32:04] new new race he is the head of this new
[1:32:07] race first second corinthians therefore
[1:32:09] if any man being christ he is a new
[1:32:11] creation
[1:32:13] because god is making a new creation
[1:32:15] all things have passed away behold all
[1:32:17] things have become new
[1:32:19] but now he is stan from the laodicean
[1:32:21] church age
[1:32:23] but now he is standing in the midst of
[1:32:24] the church and he stands there revealing
[1:32:26] who he is in the last age he calls
[1:32:27] himself the author of the creation of
[1:32:29] god i just thought this was interesting
[1:32:31] this is another creation this has to do
[1:32:34] with the church this is a special
[1:32:36] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:32:39] of the church
[1:32:40] the heavenly reichroom created his own
[1:32:42] bride and the spirit of god he came down
[1:32:45] and created in the virgin mary the cells
[1:32:47] from which his baby was born i want to
[1:32:49] repeat that he created the very cells in
[1:32:51] the womb of mary
[1:32:53] for that body it was not enough for the
[1:32:55] holy spirit to simply give life to a
[1:32:57] human ovum
[1:32:59] supplied by mary
[1:33:00] god created you
[1:33:02] for this day for this hour so he can
[1:33:04] manifest himself through you
[1:33:06] that's the whole plan and we see that in
[1:33:09] christ the mystery of god revealing the
[1:33:11] three things he wanted to do
[1:33:13] he
[1:33:14] manifest through a person on the earth
[1:33:17] and then through a church god created
[1:33:19] you for this day he created you for this
[1:33:22] time you were to come to the very image
[1:33:24] of god that the very image of him that's
[1:33:27] guaranteed that will happen because
[1:33:29] there's a remnant that's going to make
[1:33:31] it i mean there's a bride that's going
[1:33:33] to go in the rapture
[1:33:34] in the pattern these ones are elected to
[1:33:36] go there's nothing can stop them
[1:33:38] there's nothing
[1:33:40] you know if you look at the judgment in
[1:33:42] in in revelation 20
[1:33:44] that they're they're up with christ
[1:33:46] right they're not in being judged they
[1:33:49] don't get judged they were they they
[1:33:52] they already received their judgment and
[1:33:54] they were in christ and received their
[1:33:56] judgments romans 81 they have no
[1:33:57] condemnation
[1:33:58] so he will not lose one of them he said
[1:34:02] if i got 19 1999 i will not lose that
[1:34:05] other one there's a special group that
[1:34:07] he has
[1:34:08] that it's not whosoever will
[1:34:11] they they won't have a choice they will
[1:34:13] make it and if if you're part of that
[1:34:16] elect
[1:34:17] and if you are
[1:34:18] you know a renegade of some type or you
[1:34:21] don't do what god does god will take you
[1:34:23] home
[1:34:24] you know and you'll lose your reward
[1:34:26] you know in heaven but
[1:34:28] you're still one of his and he will have
[1:34:30] that elect there's nothing going to stop
[1:34:32] that
[1:34:32] they're going
[1:34:34] god says jesus said you know you've
[1:34:36] given them to me and i'll not lose one
[1:34:41] it's his spirit that works in you he's
[1:34:43] bringing you to that perfection he's
[1:34:45] bringing you to the very image of
[1:34:46] himself but you have to let him he'll do
[1:34:48] it anyway but it's much easier if you
[1:34:50] let him
[1:34:51] right
[1:34:53] when it finally drops down into your
[1:34:54] heart that's when you recognize that you
[1:34:56] are a child of god
[1:34:58] and you you get that revelation you know
[1:35:00] once once you start you know into your
[1:35:02] process you know come into the holy
[1:35:05] ghost
[1:35:06] so i i just did this up and i just
[1:35:07] showed that in layer to see and there's
[1:35:09] many things going on in later to see it
[1:35:11] that could be uh drawing you or you have
[1:35:14] desires for and it's
[1:35:16] it could be in social media i mean you
[1:35:18] can get hooked on that stuff and you
[1:35:20] know uh personally you know i don't have
[1:35:22] much to do with it but you know
[1:35:24] especially in the new generation they do
[1:35:26] you know and there's all kinds of
[1:35:27] religious stuff you know that's going on
[1:35:29] and stuff on the internet and politics
[1:35:32] it could be drawn into that and fashion
[1:35:35] entertainment sports
[1:35:37] you know
[1:35:38] festivities like christmas or whatever
[1:35:40] and families
[1:35:41] drawn into that and et cetera et cetera
[1:35:43] there's a lot of distraction in laodicea
[1:35:48] and the same as in the other ages but
[1:35:50] then he's saying there's going to be a
[1:35:51] new creation
[1:35:53] right that he's going to have a bride
[1:35:55] and he said i call you no more church
[1:35:57] i'll call you abroad i'm going to take
[1:35:58] you out of leia to see you and i'm going
[1:36:00] to separate you unto me right that's
[1:36:02] what he's talking about
[1:36:04] so you know
[1:36:06] he's going to bring you over what are
[1:36:07] you going to bring over with you you
[1:36:09] want to bring in over any of that
[1:36:11] you know he doesn't want any of that
[1:36:13] he's building a new creation that's part
[1:36:15] of the laodicea all that stuff you know
[1:36:18] he wants to dead you that's in this in
[1:36:20] his bride right
[1:36:23] so this is he refers to as adam's
[1:36:25] creation this is the first creation
[1:36:28] and here is god's creation the one he
[1:36:30] started in 63.
[1:36:33] the man was of the old
[1:36:35] order or creation now in union with
[1:36:37] christ he has become the new creation of
[1:36:40] god
[1:36:41] the new creation is not the old creation
[1:36:43] made over it could not be called a new
[1:36:44] creation this is exactly what it says it
[1:36:46] is it's a new creation it's another
[1:36:48] creation distinct from the older one
[1:36:51] he is he is the first of the creation he
[1:36:53] is he was god created in the form of man
[1:36:56] now by his spirit he is creating many
[1:36:58] sons unto himself god the creator
[1:37:01] creating himself a part of this creation
[1:37:03] we are no longer a part of adam's
[1:37:05] creation
[1:37:06] adam's creation does not apply to us
[1:37:09] right
[1:37:10] all adam's creation goes down into a
[1:37:13] fire
[1:37:14] the people in the world are under adam's
[1:37:16] creation and they will suffer and die
[1:37:17] under adam's creation in the tribulation
[1:37:20] the bride is a is is in a different
[1:37:22] creation
[1:37:24] we're in heavenly places right
[1:37:26] heavenly places with christ jesus we are
[1:37:28] god men and god women living within our
[1:37:31] human vessel to bring us to the very
[1:37:33] image of himself and if you want to
[1:37:35] associate the world and do the things of
[1:37:37] the world then you will die in adam's
[1:37:39] creation
[1:37:41] romans 6 1 when
[1:37:43] what shall we say then shall we continue
[1:37:45] in sin the grace may abound i saw this
[1:37:47] in the commentary it says shall we
[1:37:49] continue under the old creation
[1:37:51] that grace may abound or shall we get
[1:37:53] into christ once you're into christ then
[1:37:55] you are part of grace right
[1:37:57] that's always interesting so i just had
[1:37:59] this this was an old uh
[1:38:02] diagram that i had to show what happens
[1:38:04] on the day of the rapture just before
[1:38:06] and just after
[1:38:07] but i just wanted to show that you know
[1:38:09] here
[1:38:11] what i really wanted to show that in the
[1:38:12] manifestation of the sons of god we're
[1:38:14] all waiting for the manifestations of
[1:38:16] the son of god and it's kind of it spans
[1:38:18] over two periods because there is
[1:38:21] there is some uh
[1:38:23] there is some of that
[1:38:24] right before the rapture but but and
[1:38:27] then there is and it
[1:38:28] it's talked about being right after the
[1:38:31] rapture also at the manifestation of
[1:38:34] sons of god but that goes on for a long
[1:38:35] time because you know it's like jesus
[1:38:38] when he finished on camera he said it's
[1:38:39] finished but it wasn't finished he had a
[1:38:40] lot of work to do right
[1:38:42] and then he comes through the bra the
[1:38:44] church age and now he's talking about
[1:38:46] another creation here and then he's
[1:38:47] talking about after
[1:38:49] the seven church ages and he has to deal
[1:38:51] with
[1:38:52] the the jews and the tribulation and all
[1:38:54] of that and bring judgment and then he
[1:38:56] has the judgment part we still go
[1:38:58] through the millennium the general
[1:39:00] resurrection
[1:39:01] gog and magog and the white throne
[1:39:03] judgment so all of that has to go on and
[1:39:05] then after that is the new heavens and
[1:39:07] the new earth and then there's in
[1:39:08] revelation 22.
[1:39:10] the wind up there and he has god has
[1:39:13] still got a lot of work in different
[1:39:15] forms because we know he's son of man so
[1:39:18] god son of david in these different
[1:39:20] periods you know he'll be son of david
[1:39:21] in the millennium right
[1:39:23] and also with the manifestations because
[1:39:25] we have a lot of work to do
[1:39:27] you know you think it's over all the
[1:39:28] rapture's on uh but we have a lot of
[1:39:30] work to do
[1:39:31] because we go right up to the judgment
[1:39:32] we're right up there to the judgment
[1:39:34] and brother i'm even alluded that we
[1:39:36] have to get ready for that you know over
[1:39:38] the time that's in between then and
[1:39:40] things so so the manifestation of sons
[1:39:42] of god goes on a lot but it keeps going
[1:39:44] on after that's that's the way i see it
[1:39:46] that's me saying that right
[1:39:48] so just just to give you an idea of the
[1:39:51] the way it is so this is from the latest
[1:39:54] in church age this is the true
[1:39:55] revelation of god this was his purpose
[1:39:57] getting down to the end
[1:39:59] this purpose took form through election
[1:40:02] this is why he could look right down to
[1:40:04] the last age
[1:40:06] when all would be over and see himself
[1:40:08] still in the midst of the church as
[1:40:10] author of this new creation of god his
[1:40:13] sovereign power brought it to pass by
[1:40:15] his own decree he elected the members of
[1:40:18] this new creation he predestinated them
[1:40:20] to the adoption of children according to
[1:40:23] the good pleasure of his will by his
[1:40:26] omniscience and
[1:40:28] omni omnipotence he he brought it to
[1:40:32] pass
[1:40:33] how else could he know that he would be
[1:40:35] standing in the midst of the church
[1:40:36] receiving glory from his brethren if he
[1:40:38] did not make sure
[1:40:41] all things he knew and all things he
[1:40:43] worked out according to what he knew in
[1:40:44] order for his purpose and
[1:40:47] good pleasure to be brought to pass and
[1:40:50] god you know
[1:40:51] you know jesus talked about you know the
[1:40:54] sparrows and the grass you know he you
[1:40:56] know he knows all about that and he
[1:40:57] doesn't know about his elect he knows
[1:40:59] everything about his elect right we know
[1:41:01] that
[1:41:04] it's not you and me it's him it's
[1:41:06] learning to rest in him and relax in him
[1:41:08] it's allowing him to do things he wants
[1:41:10] to do through us
[1:41:12] god predestinated to the adoption of
[1:41:14] children according to what he wants to
[1:41:16] do in his power he's bringing it to pass
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:20] amen
[1:41:22] second last slide
[1:41:24] so here in the token now remember
[1:41:26] hebrews 13 10 20 everlasting god's
[1:41:30] blood-bound promise makes us free from
[1:41:32] sin we're free from sin
[1:41:35] amen there is no sin in him sin
[1:41:38] self
[1:41:39] flesh worship him and show forth his
[1:41:42] promised power
[1:41:43] god's power
[1:41:44] blood
[1:41:45] bound token-bound covenant
[1:41:48] people has the spirit of jesus christ in
[1:41:50] here that he that believeth on me the
[1:41:53] works that i do shall he do also
[1:41:56] displaying the covenant see so we are
[1:41:58] free from sin we don't have to sin
[1:42:00] sin is unbelief and we don't have to
[1:42:02] disbelieve
[1:42:03] get into christ and you won't be
[1:42:06] disbelieving because his presence will
[1:42:07] be there and it will encourage you as
[1:42:10] the adopted sons and daughters of god
[1:42:11] and i say here read your bible and pray
[1:42:16] the god who is rich in mercy i'm only
[1:42:18] saying this not to mix up doctrine but
[1:42:20] to straighten it out that we might get
[1:42:22] away from fear and scare
[1:42:24] you don't know who you are you are not
[1:42:26] going to be
[1:42:28] but now you are the sons of god
[1:42:30] you always were the sons of god because
[1:42:33] i showed in the elect you were there in
[1:42:35] the mind of god
[1:42:36] you were the signs of god but you we had
[1:42:38] spiritual amnesia
[1:42:40] jesus came and he knew as a child he
[1:42:42] knew who he was he knew he was the son
[1:42:44] of god right but we didn't
[1:42:46] until
[1:42:47] the holy ghost came out and found us you
[1:42:50] know so you weren't saved in that day
[1:42:52] when you're at the altar it's just a
[1:42:53] holy ghost
[1:42:55] revealing to you that you're a son of
[1:42:58] god he just went out to look for you and
[1:43:00] find you
[1:43:01] and give you that revelation you know
[1:43:03] that you're the son of god right
[1:43:05] and then you receive the holy ghost and
[1:43:07] you really realize oh i'm i didn't start
[1:43:09] here i started right back here
[1:43:11] i was in the mind of god and if i was a
[1:43:13] part of god who's eternal then i will be
[1:43:15] eternal
[1:43:16] always right
[1:43:18] and that's what you learned in this age
[1:43:21] is those things
[1:43:22] so i don't need to go to the altar every
[1:43:24] time the holy ghost found me
[1:43:26] you know now i'm in my flesh and i have
[1:43:28] trouble here there whatever
[1:43:30] but the more that i come closer to him
[1:43:33] the more i drop myself the more i die
[1:43:36] then
[1:43:37] then you don't sin you know it doesn't
[1:43:39] reach you you know you have it in
[1:43:41] control and then you go on as an adopted
[1:43:43] son of god god and then you get power
[1:43:45] right
[1:43:48] for when god had you in his thinking at
[1:43:50] the beginning you have to be some part
[1:43:53] of you your life that's in you now had
[1:43:55] to be with god before there
[1:43:58] well then he before he even became
[1:44:00] material on the earth before there was
[1:44:02] anything but god you were one of his
[1:44:04] attributes he knew what your name would
[1:44:07] be he knew the color of your hair you
[1:44:09] would have he he knew all about you the
[1:44:12] only thing happened is when you being a
[1:44:14] sinner right
[1:44:16] so he knew you because how did you know
[1:44:17] barbara says you know uh you were
[1:44:20] you're the son of
[1:44:22] this person under discernment you know
[1:44:24] and he would he would bring back
[1:44:25] everything but didn't know it but god
[1:44:27] knew it who went back like four
[1:44:30] generations in his
[1:44:32] in a person's life or told them what
[1:44:33] they did yesterday or last year and
[1:44:35] nobody knew it and they knew so he knows
[1:44:37] those things right because he's
[1:44:39] he knows god knows you right
[1:44:41] and it's you know it's uh reassuring
[1:44:43] right
[1:44:44] it helps you builds your faith right
[1:44:47] so over here i just had you know um
[1:44:49] power and authority because we do have
[1:44:51] power
[1:44:52] it says we have power and authority we
[1:44:54] have authority over say we can we can
[1:44:56] rebuke satan you know because he's lost
[1:44:58] his power at calvary he had no more
[1:45:00] power he didn't have reign over anymore
[1:45:03] you know it's just now a bluff as they
[1:45:05] call a fake
[1:45:06] you know and so he doesn't really have
[1:45:08] the power you can say boo devil and he
[1:45:10] he can go you know if you're if you're
[1:45:12] talking in the name of the lord right
[1:45:15] and all your sins you know it's like
[1:45:16] they they're in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:45:18] there is no sin if you if you were it's
[1:45:21] like if you were
[1:45:23] someone who
[1:45:24] who went up before a a judge now on this
[1:45:28] earth in a course you know he would look
[1:45:30] back and say well you know you have no
[1:45:32] you have no uh a charge against you and
[1:45:35] you have no record there's no record up
[1:45:36] here there's nothing it's not like you
[1:45:38] you did it
[1:45:40] and they they they pardoned you you had
[1:45:42] nothing when god looks at you you've got
[1:45:44] no record he doesn't see anything
[1:45:47] he just sees oh that was that was a that
[1:45:49] just gets laid back on the devil's head
[1:45:51] all of that things that you did
[1:45:53] you don't have any he's just he's the
[1:45:54] blood he looks through and he sees the
[1:45:56] blood of jesus christ he still sees it
[1:45:59] you know so you're not
[1:46:01] you're
[1:46:02] you don't have that anymore you're not
[1:46:03] like a human
[1:46:04] an unbeliever who would have sinned and
[1:46:06] they would go in god's presence with sin
[1:46:08] they wouldn't happen
[1:46:09] and it means that you're a son and
[1:46:11] daughter of god because you had that
[1:46:13] so you know you're not in this this
[1:46:15] realm you're not a sinner saved by grace
[1:46:17] right
[1:46:18] you know you're a son of god right and
[1:46:20] brother branham started to realize that
[1:46:22] also
[1:46:24] i'm not i'm only saying this
[1:46:27] not to mix up doctrine but to straighten
[1:46:29] it out that we might get away from this
[1:46:31] fear and scare you don't know who you
[1:46:33] are you are not going to be but now you
[1:46:35] are the sons of god you are the sons of
[1:46:37] god right
[1:46:39] see you always were the sons of god
[1:46:41] nothing changed
[1:46:43] it's like said you went you went in
[1:46:45] under sin and you know
[1:46:47] under ephesians 2 and under the
[1:46:50] the spirit of disobedience
[1:46:52] you know and you were like those in the
[1:46:53] world
[1:46:54] but when you went to the altar when god
[1:46:57] drew you the holy spirit found you he
[1:46:59] draws you to the altar
[1:47:01] he he takes that away
[1:47:02] and you you you always were a son of god
[1:47:05] you didn't become a son of god when you
[1:47:07] receive salvation right he just found
[1:47:10] you
[1:47:14] you just gotta start believing it and
[1:47:16] acting like it right
[1:47:18] and and using that power and authority
[1:47:20] that you do have in you and if you
[1:47:21] listen to
[1:47:22] uh
[1:47:25] everlasting water from the rock that
[1:47:27] message he talks a lot about it for when
[1:47:29] god had you in his thinking at the
[1:47:31] beginning you have to be some part of
[1:47:33] you your life that's in you now had to
[1:47:35] be with god before there
[1:47:38] and no one talked like this
[1:47:39] you'd never see a theologian or anyone
[1:47:41] talking like this this is a prophet
[1:47:42] talking before the foundation in the
[1:47:44] mind of god way back there
[1:47:47] well when he before he even became
[1:47:49] material here on earth before there was
[1:47:51] anything but god you were one of his
[1:47:53] attributes he he knew what your name
[1:47:55] would be he knew the color of your hair
[1:47:57] you see that in the discernment line
[1:47:58] right we know that
[1:48:01] and you would have he knew all about you
[1:48:03] the only thing happened is is when
[1:48:05] you're being a sinner i think i just
[1:48:07] read that
[1:48:08] so here's here's the brother brian he
[1:48:10] says what was it there was another
[1:48:12] william branham a little spot of eternal
[1:48:14] life down there
[1:48:17] from the genes of god the word of god
[1:48:20] that was placed in there
[1:48:21] each one of you
[1:48:23] can think of similar things it was
[1:48:25] working so this is the last message he
[1:48:28] preached right and this is coming from
[1:48:31] the second last page in that message
[1:48:36] but yet all at once i looked up and i
[1:48:38] said i'm not a son of charles and ella
[1:48:40] branham his mother i'm not a son anymore
[1:48:42] i know now i'm not that's not my
[1:48:45] heritage
[1:48:46] there's something calling like my little
[1:48:48] eagle i'm not a chicken there's

[1:59:11] when that life starts to live itself out
[1:59:13] in all of us
