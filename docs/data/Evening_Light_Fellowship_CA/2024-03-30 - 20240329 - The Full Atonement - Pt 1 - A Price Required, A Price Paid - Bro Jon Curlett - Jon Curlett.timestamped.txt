[51:36] 2 amen greet each one here tonight and
[51:40] amen it's a wonderful weekend this is
[51:43] the weekend that matters most of all for
[51:45] all believers amen amen he had to die
[51:48] but he had to rise again and tonight
[51:50] we're in commemoration of his death but
[51:53] every day ought to be a commemoration of
[51:55] his of his res resurrection of his
[51:57] raising up of the power of the holy
[51:59] spirit in the believer's life amen so we
[52:02] don't want to just remember it today and
[52:04] through the weekend but let every day be
[52:06] a a commemoration amen of the great work
[52:08] that was done at Calvary and then we
[52:10] certainly want to remember the family
[52:12] for brother Ian Brenton brother AB
[52:13] sister Olive brother Barry sister
[52:15] Darlene sister Leah brother Chad and the
[52:17] different ones that are out there and uh
[52:20] the funeral should be sometime this
[52:21] coming week Lord willing and we'll share
[52:23] those details as we get them but just
[52:25] remember them and in prayer as well they
[52:27] wanted me to mention that there's
[52:28] Refreshments after service for those
[52:30] that want to and can stay so uh don't
[52:32] rush out too quickly amen Genesis 2
[52:36] verse1 15 says and the Lord God took the
[52:38] man and put him in the Garden of Eden to
[52:40] dress it and to keep it and the Lord God
[52:42] commanded the man saying of every tree
[52:44] of the garden thou mayest freely eat but
[52:46] of the tree of the knowledge of Good and
[52:48] Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[52:50] day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[52:53] surely die amen God bless you you can
[52:55] have your seat and not a very warm
[52:58] scripture that we open up with amen but
[53:00] it's not a very warm thing that put
[53:01] Christ on the cross and this is where we
[53:03] see God lay down the law so to speak but
[53:07] I just want to take a little minseries
[53:08] this weekend from what we've been
[53:10] preaching on and I guess everything
[53:12] really plays into it but when brother
[53:13] Andrew do was here he he talked about
[53:15] the fullness of the atonement and that
[53:17] stuck with me ever since and just been
[53:19] dwelling on it and studying on it a bit
[53:21] and so I thought this would be the best
[53:22] time to maybe bring it and and just see
[53:24] what the Lord will do with it and it's
[53:26] just services and when it comes to the
[53:28] atonement everything is under the
[53:29] atonement we'll see that the seven seal
[53:31] book is under the atonement and all
[53:33] these things and we'll only go so far
[53:34] with it this weekend but I just want to
[53:36] dwell on that this this weekend and I
[53:38] want to take a title tonight of a price
[53:40] required and a price paid amen and we
[53:42] know uh what happened in in the Garden
[53:45] of Eden and Adam's wife was seduced and
[53:47] she was tricked and she did what God
[53:50] said not to do and I'm not going to
[53:51] dwell on sin a lot this evening I think
[53:53] we know enough about Sin we we know the
[53:56] effect of that but I want you to see
[53:57] that the first thing that happened as
[54:00] soon as they transgressed God's word Was
[54:02] Fear set in and fear separated them from
[54:06] God God did not separate himself from
[54:08] them they separated themselves from God
[54:11] Amen and the scripture says that we do
[54:13] not have a spirit of fear if you're
[54:15] scared to approach God tonight that is
[54:17] not the spirit of this age that is not
[54:19] the spirit of the Bride that's not the
[54:20] spirit of the believer that Spirit has
[54:22] been thoroughly conquered at Calvary
[54:25] amen we do not need to be under spirit
[54:26] of fear we don't have to wonder if he
[54:28] will accept us we don't have to wonder
[54:30] if he's looking for us if he wants us to
[54:32] be in his presence that has been
[54:33] completely dispelled and even in a time
[54:36] of sin God did not turn them away
[54:38] immediately he went looking for them
[54:40] amen amen but we see that what happens
[54:43] here is that Adam partook and Eve was
[54:46] tricked but Adam did it willingly Adam
[54:49] knew what he was doing and there was a
[54:51] transgression in there and we see that
[54:53] what happened after that is man just
[54:54] dropped into an abys and he just went
[54:57] further and further away from God and he
[54:59] dropped deeper and deeper into unbelief
[55:01] and deeper and deeper into sin and he
[55:02] turned into a beast because a man
[55:05] without God is a beast that's what he
[55:07] turns into he goes back to that satanic
[55:09] nature rather than the god nature
[55:11] because the god nature is what makes us
[55:13] human it's a satanic nature that makes
[55:15] us Fallen amen and so we see what
[55:17] happens here is that man degraded to a
[55:20] point and we see it even with Noah that
[55:22] he degraded to a point that the
[55:23] scripture says that the every thought of
[55:25] his mind was evil continually there was
[55:28] no good in it but this was the starting
[55:30] point of it the starting point of it was
[55:32] when God said don't do something and
[55:34] they went and they did it and we know
[55:36] what happened in in Genesis and what God
[55:38] Said there the consequence of it and he
[55:40] said but of the tree of the knowledge of
[55:42] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[55:43] for in the day that thou eatest thereof
[55:46] Thou shalt surely die God declared in
[55:48] this verse that they would die the day
[55:51] that it happened amen and there was a
[55:52] price that would have to be paid and God
[55:54] said death's the price but we look at
[55:57] death as as as loss of breath and loss
[55:59] of life but death is not that death is
[56:01] separation from God because what happens
[56:04] and we'll see that God has to fulfill
[56:06] his word so there's a natural death but
[56:08] there's a Supernatural death that
[56:09] happens and that Supernatural death
[56:11] comes by separation from God and so God
[56:14] said the day that you do this is the day
[56:16] that you have to separate from me and
[56:18] they couldn't even comprehend that they
[56:20] couldn't even comprehend what death
[56:21] meant because death did not exist at
[56:23] that time sin did not exist God said
[56:25] don't do something and they couldn't
[56:27] even comprehend the effects of it cuz
[56:29] life was so perfect back then there was
[56:31] no there was no shame there was no fear
[56:32] there was no worry there was none of
[56:34] these things but God's word have been
[56:36] declared and he says the day you do it
[56:37] is the day that you're separated from me
[56:39] that's the day that you're going to die
[56:41] and we see though that God is gracious
[56:44] because after they sin what happens they
[56:47] recognize they're naked and what do they
[56:49] do they hide from God there's fear there
[56:53] and there's worry and there's anxiety
[56:55] and they hide from from God but the
[56:57] grace of God comes through the garden
[56:59] and he's saying Adam Where Art Thou
[57:01] because when he came down in the cool of
[57:03] the evening brother Brandon would say he
[57:05] would sit there and he would lay their
[57:06] heads in his lap and he would calm then
[57:08] he would soothe them as they went to
[57:10] sleep each night and God came down to
[57:12] soothe them and all of a sudden they
[57:13] weren't there to be
[57:15] soothed but the grace of God said I'm
[57:17] still seeking even when you don't
[57:20] deserve it even when you broken my word
[57:22] you transgressed my word god came and he
[57:25] said where are you Adam and finally he
[57:28] called long enough that Adam said I'm
[57:30] here but I'm
[57:32] scared I'm scared why are you scared
[57:36] Adam because I'm
[57:39] naked I'm not fit to be in your presence
[57:43] the way I am the way you made me now is
[57:45] no longer
[57:48] good and God said who told you you're
[57:51] naked you've been naked all
[57:54] along but what made you to unfit for my
[57:57] presence Adam what
[58:01] changed church if there's something we
[58:03] ought to know today it's that sin takes
[58:05] us further than we ever
[58:08] anticipated they had no idea what they
[58:10] were in for and sometimes I think as
[58:14] children of God we think that we'll get
[58:16] away with it because we're children of
[58:18] God it's because we're children of God
[58:21] that we don't get away with it because
[58:24] he holds us accountable to his word in
[58:26] the good and in the bad amen and we see
[58:29] what happens the deeper effects of sin
[58:32] and we step away from the protection of
[58:34] the word what does it do it opens us up
[58:36] to everything that Satan has for us you
[58:39] know I was talking to my wife about this
[58:42] just this week and I you know we look at
[58:44] people that have left the message and
[58:45] some of them just go back to religion
[58:48] and they're sad but you know what most
[58:50] do is they go back to Beast nature they
[58:53] don't even have that cloak of religion
[58:55] and I told her I I ran across a young
[58:58] lady and it was it was suggested as a
[59:00] friend on my
[59:01] Facebook and I looked at that and I said
[59:03] I don't recognize that person the ne the
[59:05] last name's right but who is that person
[59:07] and I realized she was a daughter of a
[59:09] family that had left this message about
[59:11] 10 years ago and I clicked on her
[59:14] profile and the pictures that I saw of
[59:16] her there she would look like a
[59:19] prostitute and she was happy and proud
[59:22] to be that
[59:23] way that poor young lady
[59:26] had no idea what she was going to turn
[59:29] into when her parents walked away from
[59:31] this message another young sister walked
[59:34] away and within a year she was pregnant
[59:36] out of wedlock had a baby the father
[59:38] left and then a couple years later
[59:39] another man did it to her and now she
[59:41] sits there today with two young children
[59:42] and no fathers
[59:44] around another married a young woman and
[59:47] was divorced within a year this is what
[59:50] happens when we get out from under it
[59:52] why did they go that route church
[59:54] because Satan showed them the pleasure
[59:56] of that decision but he never showed
[59:58] them the consequences of the decision
[1:00:01] because remember what the scripture says
[1:00:03] to Eve it says and when she saw that it
[1:00:06] was
[1:00:07] pleasurable when she was convinced that
[1:00:10] it was good she tried to get somebody
[1:00:12] else to do it and that's what happens
[1:00:14] you'll find when people leave the word
[1:00:15] is they'll tell you of the pleasures
[1:00:17] they have because it's too soon for the
[1:00:19] Harvest to be
[1:00:20] shown but Satan will never tell you the
[1:00:23] Harvest that's coming down the road when
[1:00:24] you leave the protection of the word
[1:00:27] they were seduced to make a decision
[1:00:28] based on how it was going to feel rather
[1:00:31] than what it was going to
[1:00:32] produce
[1:00:34] amen Satan tells us it's pleasurable and
[1:00:36] he is right it is pleasurable for a
[1:00:39] season you know the scripture says that
[1:00:41] Moses rejected the pleasures of Egypt
[1:00:44] for a season while choosing rather to
[1:00:46] suffer the afflictions of the children
[1:00:48] of Israel because that was his place
[1:00:50] that's where he knew that he was
[1:00:52] supposed to be but somebody always has
[1:00:54] to pay a price someone always has to pay
[1:00:57] a price and we'll find as we go through
[1:00:59] this today you know who pays the price
[1:01:01] those who did no wrong the innocent pay
[1:01:03] the price of the guilty every single
[1:01:05] time parents when we step out of line
[1:01:08] who pays the price most our children
[1:01:10] right the ministry when we step out of
[1:01:12] line who pays the most the congregation
[1:01:15] the innocent suffer for the guilt of the
[1:01:18] ones that did it in the first place amen
[1:01:20] the innocent always suffer but we see in
[1:01:23] Galatians 6 Paul would say be not
[1:01:24] deceived God is Not mocked in other
[1:01:27] words God will not be mocked God won't
[1:01:30] be made a fool of he says for whatsoever
[1:01:32] a man Seth that shall we also re reap
[1:01:35] this is the law of the Harvest and this
[1:01:37] is a law of God church and this is the
[1:01:39] best thing you can read in your Bible
[1:01:42] because what happened in the beginning
[1:01:43] was God sowed a seed and he SED it in
[1:01:46] your heart and he swed it in my heart
[1:01:48] and what did he do he sowed the seed of
[1:01:50] a son or daughter of God in there and
[1:01:52] what God's saying is here is whatever is
[1:01:54] sown is what's going to come out
[1:01:56] that is the anchor that holds me day in
[1:01:58] and day out whether I feel like a child
[1:02:00] of God or whether I don't is the seed of
[1:02:02] God is inside of me and that is the
[1:02:05] anchor is that I am a child of his but
[1:02:08] he says now listen you're going to sow
[1:02:10] as well and whatever you sow is what
[1:02:13] you're going to
[1:02:15] reap whatever decisions you make we sow
[1:02:18] temporary seeds every single day by way
[1:02:20] of our decisions amen and he says for he
[1:02:23] that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[1:02:26] reap
[1:02:27] corruption you s after this human nature
[1:02:30] you sow after the desires of this body
[1:02:32] and this mind that we have you reap
[1:02:34] corruption he says but he that sth to
[1:02:37] the spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[1:02:41] Everlasting everything we do is good or
[1:02:44] bad and what determines good or bad the
[1:02:46] will of the Lord if you're in God's will
[1:02:48] it's good and if you're outside of the
[1:02:49] will of God it's not good anything
[1:02:53] that's for God is good and anything
[1:02:54] that's against God is bad
[1:02:56] so it's in the word it's in God's will
[1:02:58] that's what determines if you're sowing
[1:02:59] good seed to the spirit and everything
[1:03:01] else is to the Flesh and it reaps
[1:03:02] corruption he says but let us not be
[1:03:05] weary in well-doing in other words let's
[1:03:07] not be weary in sewing to the
[1:03:11] spirit why because that doesn't always
[1:03:14] reap things so good immediately you
[1:03:17] don't always get the good feeling of
[1:03:19] sowing in the spirit you don't always
[1:03:20] get the good feeling of sewing in the
[1:03:22] word but he says if we do that for in
[1:03:24] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:03:28] if we stay with it if we hold to the
[1:03:31] sewing that we swed in the first place
[1:03:33] by the Spirit by the word of God then
[1:03:35] that's going to produce what God Said
[1:03:37] but you've got to hold on to it because
[1:03:38] God doesn't tend to do things like this
[1:03:41] when it breaks out of the ground it
[1:03:42] seems immediate but it's been growing
[1:03:44] all along you've got to seow the right
[1:03:46] thing there scripture says there that we
[1:03:48] reap corruption if you go back there
[1:03:50] it's talking about the length of time
[1:03:54] there's a time that you s and there's a
[1:03:56] time that you reap and the thing is when
[1:03:57] you sow something bad it takes a while
[1:03:59] to bring corruption but nonetheless
[1:04:01] corruption is all you get it's death
[1:04:03] it's destruction it's Mayhem it's
[1:04:06] chaos it's separation from God Amen the
[1:04:10] pleasure is immediate when you swow to
[1:04:13] the flesh but the corruption starts from
[1:04:15] there and it just goes and it goes and
[1:04:17] it goes and it produces death amen
[1:04:19] that's what Satan's trying to do get us
[1:04:21] to sew to the flesh to the lust of the
[1:04:23] eyes the lust of the the flesh that he
[1:04:26] he'll get us to Fritter away our time
[1:04:28] and get stuck on things of this life
[1:04:30] rather than sowing to the spirit
[1:04:32] focusing on the things that matter to
[1:04:33] God we look at Adam's Harvest Adam had a
[1:04:36] moment of pleasure with his wife and
[1:04:38] then as soon as he finishes that he has
[1:04:41] time to think now he has time to take
[1:04:43] his action and run it by the word of God
[1:04:45] and he realizes I'm in trouble and fear
[1:04:48] sets in he was scared to face up to God
[1:04:52] the very one that had the closest
[1:04:53] fellowship with Adam now he's scared to
[1:04:55] step into his presence he doesn't want
[1:04:57] to do
[1:04:59] it but we see that he was gracious we
[1:05:02] look at G Genesis 3 it says and he said
[1:05:04] who told thee that thou was naked hast
[1:05:06] thou eaten of the tree wherever I
[1:05:08] commanded thee that thou should us not
[1:05:09] eat and the man said it was the woman's
[1:05:15] fault really she made you do it
[1:05:18] Adam the woman who thou gavest to be
[1:05:20] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[1:05:22] did eat you notice he says the woman you
[1:05:24] gave me he's almost putting it back on
[1:05:26] God you gave me a flawed
[1:05:32] wife and the Lord God said unto the
[1:05:34] woman God doesn't answer anything he
[1:05:36] just follows it down the line what is
[1:05:38] this thou Hast done and the woman said
[1:05:40] the serpent beguiled me and I did
[1:05:42] eat and the Lord God said unto the
[1:05:45] serpent because thou Hast done this you
[1:05:47] notice he never asked the serpent what
[1:05:48] did you do he knew what had been
[1:05:51] done he says because thou Hast done this
[1:05:54] thou are cursed above all cattle and
[1:05:56] above every beast of the field and upon
[1:05:58] thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt
[1:06:00] thou eat all the days of thy life he
[1:06:02] says and I will put enity between thee
[1:06:04] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:06:06] her seed it shall bruise thy head and it
[1:06:09] shall Thou shalt bruise his heel and
[1:06:11] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[1:06:13] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:06:15] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[1:06:17] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:06:19] husband and he shall rule over thee and
[1:06:21] unto Adam he said because thou has
[1:06:23] hearkened under the voice of thy wife
[1:06:25] and has eaten of the tree of which I
[1:06:27] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[1:06:28] of it curs it is the ground for thy sake
[1:06:31] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:06:33] days of thy life Thorns also and
[1:06:35] thistles shall it bring forth to thee
[1:06:37] and thou shalt eat of the herb of the
[1:06:39] field and in the sweat of thy face shalt
[1:06:42] thou eat bread till thou return under
[1:06:45] the ground for out of it thou was taken
[1:06:47] for dust Thou Art and unto dust thou
[1:06:49] shal return but I want you to consider
[1:06:52] something here because God has already
[1:06:54] declared that death was the
[1:06:56] penalty but yet what do we see here we
[1:06:59] don't see death as the way we would
[1:07:02] think of it we see what
[1:07:05] consequences but we don't see
[1:07:08] death not this day not
[1:07:12] now what is it there's a Grace that's
[1:07:14] being applied
[1:07:16] here but God has to fulfill his word he
[1:07:18] can't go against his own word what we
[1:07:21] see here is righteous consequences for
[1:07:23] their
[1:07:24] actions they're going to die all right
[1:07:26] he tells it to Adam in verse 19 he says
[1:07:28] You Came Out of the Dust you're going
[1:07:29] back to the dust you're going to die one
[1:07:31] day
[1:07:32] physically but there's something else
[1:07:34] has happened to give you Grace for now
[1:07:37] and we see it in verse 21 because what's
[1:07:39] happened here is love has projected
[1:07:42] that's what happen is love is projected
[1:07:44] and now Grace is doing what producing
[1:07:47] what is needed for love to take
[1:07:49] place nothing's deserved here but watch
[1:07:53] what love does verse 21 it says unto
[1:07:56] Adam also and his wife did the Lord God
[1:07:58] make coats of skins and clothed them
[1:08:00] what did he do he gave them a covering
[1:08:02] for the thing that was separating them
[1:08:03] from his presence he calmed them down he
[1:08:06] settled the fear and anxiety for a
[1:08:09] moment but if you know one thing is that
[1:08:12] you can't have skins unless something
[1:08:16] dies and this is where we see the
[1:08:19] provision of Grace because of love
[1:08:22] something had to die I want to set the
[1:08:24] tone for this week with this quote
[1:08:27] brother B said God requires
[1:08:32] Perfection I want you to dwell on that
[1:08:34] this entire weekend God requires
[1:08:37] Perfection Because by the end of it I'm
[1:08:39] hoping we'll have a greater revelation
[1:08:40] of what God's done for us God requires
[1:08:44] Perfection amen he says we want to bear
[1:08:46] that in mind that there's nothing just
[1:08:48] partway can go in the presence of God
[1:08:51] catch that nothing partway can go in the
[1:08:54] presence of God
[1:08:56] he says it must be perfect our worship
[1:08:59] everything now in the Garden of Eden God
[1:09:01] had Adam and Eve in the garden and they
[1:09:03] sinned and transgress the laws of God by
[1:09:05] sinning and Disobedience and when
[1:09:07] transgression comes disobedience is the
[1:09:10] transgression of the law and the law of
[1:09:12] God him being holy just unadulterated
[1:09:14] holy therefore no spot of unholiness can
[1:09:17] ever stand in his
[1:09:20] presence so if sin came in the world by
[1:09:23] transgression then sin must be dealt
[1:09:26] with before the sinner can ever stand in
[1:09:29] the presence of
[1:09:30] God he says every law has a penalty for
[1:09:33] the penalty of transgressing God's law
[1:09:36] is death and it had to project death to
[1:09:39] the human race and all of the human race
[1:09:40] is under the penalty of this law now
[1:09:43] when Adam and Eve had sinned there was
[1:09:45] no way no other remedy that they could
[1:09:47] ever stand in the presence of God again
[1:09:50] except this sin be dealt with and no man
[1:09:53] can commit a sin of any type no matter
[1:09:55] how liter or how big that individual sin
[1:09:58] has to be dealt with before the one who
[1:10:00] committed it can ever stand in the
[1:10:02] presence of the holy
[1:10:04] God but watch this he says and then love
[1:10:08] of God went out for his subject and when
[1:10:12] Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace
[1:10:15] produces the object of the love amen
[1:10:20] Love by Grace produces a solution he
[1:10:23] says and God by forn knowledge when he
[1:10:25] loved his race so well yet with the
[1:10:27] penalty he caused the substitutionary
[1:10:30] death to take place in the Garden of
[1:10:32] Eden remember God can't break his word
[1:10:35] but he can add to it he can interpret it
[1:10:39] but he can't break
[1:10:41] it he says that was he substituted an
[1:10:45] innocent creature a little lamb that
[1:10:46] knew no sin and it went for a substitute
[1:10:49] to work and to die in the stead of the
[1:10:51] guilty Sinner and it was a lamb slain to
[1:10:54] hold the life of his subjects so we saw
[1:10:56] that they were clothed with skins what
[1:10:58] was it a lamb had died for their sake
[1:11:01] that's their clothing their clothing was
[1:11:03] to prove that something else had taken
[1:11:05] their place it was a
[1:11:08] covering it did not fix the sin but it
[1:11:11] covered the results of it it was just a
[1:11:14] covering though amen it covered their
[1:11:17] nakedness it made them not scared now to
[1:11:20] stand in his
[1:11:21] presence amen it helped calm them down
[1:11:24] but it was just a respit
[1:11:26] it was just a momentary break from the
[1:11:29] effects of what had
[1:11:30] happened brother Brown would continue he
[1:11:32] would say grace provided a preparation
[1:11:36] Grace is love and God so loved his
[1:11:38] Fallen creatures that he provided a
[1:11:40] preparation to stand them in his
[1:11:42] presence before judgment God went and
[1:11:44] killed sheep or animals and put skins on
[1:11:46] them to cover them up and blood was
[1:11:48] first made before the Judgment the
[1:11:51] Judgment was through the blood of course
[1:11:52] and then he shed the blood of the
[1:11:54] innocent to cover up the guilt of the
[1:11:57] guilty so it was just a respit it was
[1:11:59] just a temporary thing that he did there
[1:12:02] it did not stop the law from taking
[1:12:05] effect did not did not stop them from
[1:12:07] being taken out of his presence it did
[1:12:09] not stop death but it took them away
[1:12:11] from the immediacy of what they deserved
[1:12:14] of what the law of God had declared amen
[1:12:17] death was coming but it wouldn't be
[1:12:18] immediate why because they were being
[1:12:20] separated from the Tree of Life which is
[1:12:22] Christ that was the source of eternal
[1:12:24] life as to be in the presence of God and
[1:12:27] so he separated them and then so there
[1:12:29] was this slow death after that until
[1:12:32] they would die and no man lived a
[1:12:33] thousand years scripture says a thousand
[1:12:35] years is as a day in the eyes of God no
[1:12:38] one made it past the day in God's eyes
[1:12:41] every single one died physically but
[1:12:43] they had that separation but I want to
[1:12:46] jump back from this because we see what
[1:12:48] he did but we've got to see that God has
[1:12:50] a preparation even before he does this
[1:12:53] and how he's going to do it and it's a
[1:12:56] secret of this whole mystery of the
[1:12:57] atonement is found in the scripture we
[1:12:59] read where he said and I will put enity
[1:13:01] between thy seed and the serpent seed he
[1:13:04] says what the serpent seed she had a
[1:13:06] seed and he had a seed and then he
[1:13:09] quotes and he shall bruise thy head and
[1:13:11] you shall bruise his heel he says a
[1:13:13] bruise there means to make an atonement
[1:13:16] so the Prophet by the word interprets
[1:13:18] that phrase there and says he's saying
[1:13:21] there I'm going to make an
[1:13:23] atonement now what does it mean to atone
[1:13:25] what is an atonement it means to cover
[1:13:28] to remove from evidence to hide to make
[1:13:32] amends to satisfy the requirement or to
[1:13:34] make reparation in other words it means
[1:13:37] to
[1:13:38] undo everything that had caused the
[1:13:40] problem in the first place to atone
[1:13:43] means to unravel the effect as if it
[1:13:46] never happened in the first place the
[1:13:48] prophet of God will continue he says now
[1:13:50] when there was a trouble God has always
[1:13:53] been the god to meet the need he says
[1:13:56] when there is a need for his people and
[1:13:59] you know that and God promised that he
[1:14:01] would Supply their need yet when they
[1:14:03] had did wrong and they had sinned and
[1:14:05] done things that was wrong yet when they
[1:14:06] had need of healing he's talking about
[1:14:08] the Brazen serpent God even made an
[1:14:10] atonement for healing when there was no
[1:14:12] atonement yet see God made it in the
[1:14:15] face of every difficulty God Will Make A
[1:14:18] Way of Escape he will do it if you'll
[1:14:21] just have faith and believe him that
[1:14:24] tells that under the atonement is a way
[1:14:27] of Escape for everything that sin has
[1:14:29] placed in our lives that no matter what
[1:14:32] Satan has on you what he thinks he has
[1:14:34] on you what he tries to place on you
[1:14:36] what he plagues you with what he fights
[1:14:38] you with the way out is through an
[1:14:39] atonement because God has a provided way
[1:14:42] for every one of his children to make a
[1:14:44] way of Escape amen church if we ever
[1:14:47] inject ourselves into the into the
[1:14:50] solution what are we going to do we're
[1:14:52] going to end up sitting on the curb
[1:14:53] wondering what went wrong cuz we can't
[1:14:56] make an atonement for ourselves we
[1:14:58] cannot do it amen everything that we
[1:15:01] have is a temporary covering and our
[1:15:03] favorite way of it is
[1:15:05] religion what trying to make ourselves
[1:15:08] acceptable rather than taking the
[1:15:10] acceptable way that's it amen we read
[1:15:13] already that God requires Perfection I
[1:15:16] don't know about you I ain't perfect so
[1:15:18] if I am not perfect in myself why would
[1:15:20] I ever inject myself into a process that
[1:15:22] requires Perfection I have no place in
[1:15:25] this thing amen but God said I'm going
[1:15:28] to
[1:15:29] atone I'm going to make a way amen I'm
[1:15:32] going to satisfy my own requirement
[1:15:34] because he's the only perfect one we
[1:15:36] fell and since the days of Adam and Eve
[1:15:38] we have only Fallen further and further
[1:15:40] away naturally speaking everything we do
[1:15:42] is is destructive but God would say I'm
[1:15:46] going to do it I'm going to bruise his
[1:15:48] head and he's going to bruise my heel I
[1:15:50] personal pronoun God himself was going
[1:15:52] to step down and make a way God saying
[1:15:55] you can't do it you tried it doesn't
[1:15:58] work so I've got to do it this is mine
[1:16:00] and mine alone to do I think it's
[1:16:02] amazing sometimes that we think we can
[1:16:04] save
[1:16:05] ourselves and you say brother John I
[1:16:07] don't believe it then stop
[1:16:08] trying our actions bely our words when
[1:16:12] we say yes he does all things he's my
[1:16:15] provider he's my healer he's my this
[1:16:16] he's my that and then we go out and we
[1:16:18] try and do it all ourselves and we don't
[1:16:21] let go and say Lord I'm your child and
[1:16:24] I'm trying to step into your word so
[1:16:27] just let me be quiet and still for a bit
[1:16:29] and let you do the work let you be the
[1:16:32] provider let you be the healer let you
[1:16:33] be the
[1:16:34] guide let you open the
[1:16:37] doors amen I've always said this that I
[1:16:40] believe that the the great attribute of
[1:16:42] the True Believer is rest and it's rest
[1:16:45] in the finished work that he does all
[1:16:46] things well he'll never leave us he'll
[1:16:49] never forsake us and he's our all in all
[1:16:51] that is where we rest
[1:16:53] amen i' rather go straight to his way
[1:16:56] like save the time save the time we beat
[1:16:59] around the bush and we try and we try
[1:17:01] and we try and open doors and we try and
[1:17:03] make things happen and what happens is
[1:17:05] we just get tired and we get frustrated
[1:17:07] and we get wore out and we get
[1:17:11] snippety and then we finally say this is
[1:17:13] not the way a Believer is supposed to
[1:17:15] act and we realize that's exactly it I
[1:17:18] haven't been believing I've been working
[1:17:20] too hard I've been trying too hard I've
[1:17:22] been trying to make it happen myself and
[1:17:24] it's taken me completely out of the
[1:17:26] workings of God in my life and the holy
[1:17:28] spirit's pushed away we got to step back
[1:17:30] and let him do these things but I want
[1:17:33] you to see here that right there in
[1:17:35] Genesis 3 he made an unconditional
[1:17:37] Covenant he said I'm going to bruise his
[1:17:41] head and he's going to bruise my heel
[1:17:45] there is nothing of me in that there's
[1:17:47] nothing of you in that he said it's my
[1:17:49] work and mine
[1:17:52] alone God didn't even tell him to keep
[1:17:54] sacrifice icing they did it by
[1:17:57] Revelation but God never made a law that
[1:18:00] they had to sacrifice after that until
[1:18:04] Moses until they chose a law over the
[1:18:08] grace of God when they tried to take
[1:18:10] works and God said all right I'll give
[1:18:12] you works and you'll just condemn
[1:18:15] condemn yourself all the more but you'll
[1:18:17] never see him requiring
[1:18:19] sacrifice he made the sacrifice
[1:18:23] there but God had already provided a
[1:18:25] covering for them we see it much later
[1:18:27] when God's talking to Abraham and we see
[1:18:30] that Abraham was called by Grace not by
[1:18:32] performance Abraham was just walking
[1:18:34] around like brother Mark talks about
[1:18:36] living under a mushroom maybe Abraham
[1:18:37] was a Roman Catholic you know just
[1:18:39] bobbing along doing a thing and God just
[1:18:43] sovereignly called him we have no idea
[1:18:46] of Abram's life prior to that but all we
[1:18:48] know is God just went down and he said
[1:18:49] Abram I'm going to make a great nation
[1:18:51] out of
[1:18:52] you h
[1:18:56] seriously it's that simple isn't it
[1:18:58] brother Mark he calls and you say okay
[1:19:02] where did that come
[1:19:05] from whatsoever a man SWS he'll reap
[1:19:08] whatsoever God SWS he'll reap and he's
[1:19:11] just reaping what he soow before the
[1:19:12] foundation of the world and he wrote a
[1:19:14] name in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:19:15] that's what he's coming back
[1:19:17] for and we're just realizing it amen
[1:19:20] we're of Abraham's seed we're of faith
[1:19:22] not of works there is a works that
[1:19:25] follows but we don't get in by works we
[1:19:27] get in by faith Amen in acceptance of
[1:19:29] the righteousness of Christ amen the
[1:19:31] promise that Abraham gets has nothing to
[1:19:32] do with his morality his Holiness his
[1:19:36] performance his Works none of that it's
[1:19:38] by grace that he's
[1:19:39] called listen this is Genesis 12 now the
[1:19:42] Lord God or the Lord had said unto Abram
[1:19:45] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:19:46] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[1:19:48] a land that I will show
[1:19:52] thee and I will make of thee a great
[1:19:56] nation and I will bless thee and make
[1:19:59] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:20:00] blessing and I will bless them that
[1:20:02] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[1:20:04] thee and in thee shall all families of
[1:20:06] the earth be
[1:20:07] blessed what did you do to deserve it
[1:20:09] Abraham
[1:20:11] nothing I was living the exact same as
[1:20:13] the person next to me and God came down
[1:20:16] and said I'm going to bless you above
[1:20:18] everybody else on this
[1:20:20] Earth Church you're no different than
[1:20:22] Abram tonight no less the same lineage
[1:20:27] The Original Seed the word seed by faith
[1:20:32] amen God comes out here and he says I
[1:20:35] will I will I
[1:20:38] will that's what a one-sided Covenant
[1:20:41] that's what an unconditional Covenant
[1:20:42] looks like is when one person says I
[1:20:44] will I will I will and we see all the
[1:20:47] way through Abraham's life what did
[1:20:49] Abraham do to deserve
[1:20:51] this nothing what would Abraham do to to
[1:20:54] deserve this nothing quite the
[1:20:58] contrary he'd obey disobey obey disobey
[1:21:01] in the land out of the land in the land
[1:21:03] out of the land fing the child not by
[1:21:05] Sarah messing up
[1:21:07] constantly but he would always come back
[1:21:10] because God would keep drawing him back
[1:21:12] that's the grace that's pulling him into
[1:21:14] the Covenant the grace pulls you into
[1:21:17] his Covenant we don't earn our way into
[1:21:19] it
[1:21:20] amen but this is God's unconditional
[1:21:22] Covenant and he says Abraham
[1:21:25] in you shall all families of the earth
[1:21:28] be blessed that's a supernatural promise
[1:21:31] that's not a natural lineage that's a
[1:21:33] supernatural lineage that he's talking
[1:21:35] about there and all Abraham had to do
[1:21:37] was be obedient and he was disobedient
[1:21:40] at times but he'd come back and Obey and
[1:21:42] every time he came back and obey God
[1:21:43] would confirm God would confirm God
[1:21:45] would confirm and then finally God did
[1:21:47] exactly what he said he was going to
[1:21:49] do God will bring us back time and time
[1:21:54] and time again again church amen we'll
[1:21:57] step out we'll have a besetting sin
[1:22:00] we'll make bad decisions we'll waste our
[1:22:02] time we'll waste our gift whatever it
[1:22:04] might be and God is gracious and he just
[1:22:06] keeps pulling us back pulling us back
[1:22:08] pulling us back because whatsoever God
[1:22:10] SWS God's going to reap and he has sowed
[1:22:13] word children
[1:22:16] amen but once Abraham separated from his
[1:22:18] family completely once he got into total
[1:22:20] obedience and God will bring us to that
[1:22:22] place he'll bring us to a a place of
[1:22:24] total
[1:22:25] obedience Abraham took his time remember
[1:22:28] he took his father or father-in-law with
[1:22:30] them and then he took lot with him and
[1:22:32] once he separated from all those God
[1:22:33] said no you got to separate yourself
[1:22:35] once he separated himself then God
[1:22:36] started to deal with them on the
[1:22:37] Covenant we see it now in Genesis 15 it
[1:22:40] says after these things the word of the
[1:22:42] Lord came unto Abraham in a
[1:22:43] vision okay this is God coming down to
[1:22:45] confirm the promise he said fear not
[1:22:48] Abraham or Abram I am thy shield and thy
[1:22:52] exceeding great reward Christ is our
[1:22:55] reward that's the greatest thing we have
[1:22:57] here is him we're not here for worldly
[1:23:00] wealth and recognition and these things
[1:23:02] but we're here to what receive him he is
[1:23:04] the greatest thing that we're looking
[1:23:05] for in this but watch how this scene
[1:23:07] plays out and Abraham said Lord God What
[1:23:10] wilt thou give me seeing I go childless
[1:23:12] he's saying God it doesn't matter what
[1:23:14] you give me if I don't have somebody to
[1:23:15] inherit it it dies with me it dies with
[1:23:19] me what's the point he said and the
[1:23:21] steward of my house is this elar Eleazar
[1:23:23] of Damascus because he's a servant and
[1:23:26] Abram said behold to me thou has given
[1:23:27] no seed and behold one born in my house
[1:23:29] is mine Heir a servant is mine Heir and
[1:23:32] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[1:23:33] him saying this shall not be thine Heir
[1:23:35] but he shall come forth out of thine own
[1:23:37] bowels shall be thine
[1:23:40] Heir he says and he brought him forth
[1:23:42] abroad and said look now toward heaven
[1:23:45] and tell the Stars if thou be able to
[1:23:46] number them and he said unto them so
[1:23:49] shall thy seed be he's confirming the
[1:23:51] promise of Genesis 12 which we just read
[1:23:54] and it says and he believed in the Lord
[1:23:56] and he counted it to him for
[1:23:59] righteousness now watch now this is God
[1:24:01] coming up now to to talk about how he's
[1:24:03] going to prove it and he said unto him I
[1:24:05] am the Lord that brought thee out of the
[1:24:07] of er of the caldes to give thee this
[1:24:09] land to inherit what's he's doing he's
[1:24:11] reminding Abram I'm the one that started
[1:24:13] this Abram you didn't start this I
[1:24:16] started it it's my promise to you not
[1:24:18] your promise to me I'm here Abram and
[1:24:21] even though it looks like nothing's been
[1:24:23] happening I've been here all along I've
[1:24:26] been here all along and now that you're
[1:24:28] in a place of obedience I can keep
[1:24:30] moving with you that's all I was waiting
[1:24:33] on Abram I didn't go anywhere I just
[1:24:36] needed you to get into the line needed
[1:24:39] you to get into where I told you to be
[1:24:40] and as soon as you did that look here I
[1:24:42] am it's a lesson for us church if it
[1:24:44] seems like God has pulled away have we
[1:24:46] pulled away from him or has he pulled
[1:24:48] away from us are we in obedience or are
[1:24:51] we in iniquity cuz at this stage pretty
[1:24:54] much much everything we do as iniquity
[1:24:55] church we know better we know better
[1:24:59] there's not much hidden now there's no
[1:25:00] room for ignorance anymore we know what
[1:25:02] we ought to be doing and we all know
[1:25:03] what we ought not to be doing by
[1:25:05] now but God says listen I'm the one that
[1:25:07] started this and he said Lord God
[1:25:09] whereby shall I know that I shall
[1:25:11] inherit
[1:25:13] it Abram saying God sounds good prove it
[1:25:18] nothing's happened nothing's changed in
[1:25:19] my life I'm getting older and older all
[1:25:22] I've got is a servant he's a good
[1:25:23] servant he's a faithful servant but he's
[1:25:25] not my son Lord how are you going to do
[1:25:28] that and he said unto him take me an eer
[1:25:31] of 3 years old and a she goat of three
[1:25:33] years old and a ram of three years old
[1:25:35] and a turtle dove and a young
[1:25:38] pigeon this is God saying this is how
[1:25:40] I'm going to prove
[1:25:42] it and he took unto him all these and
[1:25:45] divided them in the midst and laid each
[1:25:48] pieace one against another he says but
[1:25:50] the vers divided be them divided he not
[1:25:53] so he killed one of the big animals and
[1:25:55] he split them in half and he put the two
[1:25:57] sides on either side and then he put a
[1:25:59] bird one on either side and he didn't
[1:26:00] separate those birds it says and when
[1:26:03] the fowls came down upon the carcasses
[1:26:04] Abram drove them away so of course
[1:26:07] anytime you kill an animal the birds
[1:26:08] come when I killed a Moes last fall you
[1:26:11] wouldn't believe how bold those birds
[1:26:13] were to get in there and try and steal
[1:26:14] something from me and the funny thing is
[1:26:16] I could put out a little tender bit for
[1:26:17] them and they come right into whatever I
[1:26:19] wanted but they just came in and what
[1:26:21] did they do they want that fresh kill
[1:26:24] and so what does Abram do Abram tries to
[1:26:26] inject himself into the promise and he
[1:26:29] tries to beat them all off he tries to
[1:26:31] keep it clean he tries to make it work
[1:26:34] he tries to make it
[1:26:36] acceptable it says but when the sun was
[1:26:38] going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram
[1:26:41] and lo an Aur of great Darkness fell
[1:26:44] upon him so Abraham's been immobilized
[1:26:46] now Abram's been taken out of partaking
[1:26:49] in this
[1:26:50] Covenant okay he's helpless to do
[1:26:55] anything and he said God said unto Abram
[1:26:57] know of assurity that thy seed shall be
[1:27:00] a stranger in a land that is not theirs
[1:27:02] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[1:27:03] afflict them 400 years and also that
[1:27:06] Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[1:27:07] judge and afterward shall they come out
[1:27:10] with great
[1:27:11] substance it says and thou shalt go to
[1:27:13] thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be
[1:27:15] buried in a good old age but in the
[1:27:17] fourth generation they shall come hither
[1:27:19] again for the iniquity of the amorites
[1:27:21] is not yet
[1:27:22] full catch verse 17 it says and it came
[1:27:27] to pass that when the sun went down and
[1:27:29] it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and
[1:27:33] a burning lamp that passed between those
[1:27:36] pieces and in the same day the Lord made
[1:27:39] a covenant with Abram saying unto thy
[1:27:40] seed have I given this land from the
[1:27:42] river of Egypt under the Great River the
[1:27:44] river
[1:27:46] Euphrates now this is quite a scene if
[1:27:48] you can imagine it Abraham kills the
[1:27:50] young
[1:27:51] cow three-year-old cow
[1:27:55] lb splits it in half puts two sides then
[1:27:59] he takes a goat splits it in half puts
[1:28:02] the two sides over then he takes a male
[1:28:04] sheep splits it in half puts them there
[1:28:07] and then kills a pigeon and a dove and
[1:28:08] lays them both there this is buckets and
[1:28:11] buckets of blood and gore and mess it is
[1:28:14] gruesome it's
[1:28:17] disgusting but God said this is how I'm
[1:28:19] going to confirm the Covenant in this
[1:28:22] big mess that's here
[1:28:25] and it's not a super it's not this
[1:28:26] natural
[1:28:28] Covenant that's only a part of it but
[1:28:30] it's going back to Genesis 3 where God
[1:28:32] says he's going to bruise my heel and
[1:28:33] I'm going to bruise his head because
[1:28:35] remember he's confirming the Covenant
[1:28:37] that in all thy seed shall all the
[1:28:39] families of the earth be blessed or in
[1:28:40] thy seed shall all families of the earth
[1:28:42] be blessed thy seed
[1:28:43] one not seeds we know Paul talks about
[1:28:46] that later he says not seeds as in many
[1:28:48] but sees as in one Christ he says this
[1:28:51] is how the Covenant is going to be
[1:28:53] fulfilled yes you Abraham you've got a
[1:28:55] land and you've got a natural seed but
[1:28:57] that's not what I'm working with you in
[1:28:59] you I've got a a supernatural seed
[1:29:01] that's coming and it's a seed of Faith
[1:29:02] it's a word seed it's a predestinated
[1:29:04] seed and it's going to come and it's
[1:29:06] going to produce one that'll do exactly
[1:29:09] what's shown right
[1:29:12] here the prophet of God would take us to
[1:29:15] this scene he says look when he come
[1:29:17] down and show to Abraham what he was
[1:29:18] going to do he says first he put Abraham
[1:29:21] to sleep now Abraham you don't have
[1:29:24] nothing to do with it I say praise the
[1:29:27] Lord that he's not trusting in me to
[1:29:30] make this work he says now he said
[1:29:32] Abraham he put him to sleep said I'll
[1:29:33] show you how I'm going to do it how I'm
[1:29:35] going to keep my Covenant and he took
[1:29:37] those animals now watch when Abraham
[1:29:39] went to sleep showing death must come to
[1:29:41] Every Creature then before him went a
[1:29:44] burning furnace and a burning furnace
[1:29:46] represented hell that every sinner
[1:29:48] deserve to go to hell he says and then
[1:29:51] beyond that by the sacrifice on the hill
[1:29:53] went to little white light what was it
[1:29:55] it's the pillar of fire Christ that went
[1:29:58] in between each one of those pieces of
[1:30:00] sacrifice he says now the Covenant see
[1:30:02] they made different covenants different
[1:30:04] people's Customs but the Oriental custom
[1:30:07] was to kill a beast and stand in between
[1:30:09] this beast and then write it out over
[1:30:11] here you find in Leviticus they write
[1:30:13] out their agreement and that agreement
[1:30:15] is tore in two over this dead beast and
[1:30:18] they take an oath over the dead beasts
[1:30:20] that if they break this Covenant May
[1:30:22] their body be as this dead Beast
[1:30:24] and they give each one a
[1:30:28] piece everyone that's part of a covenant
[1:30:31] gets a piece of the Covenant hold it in
[1:30:33] your minds he says and then they're sent
[1:30:36] away and when they come back those two
[1:30:38] pieces has to dovetail just exactly the
[1:30:40] same pieces he says how beautiful the
[1:30:43] Covenant is confirmed when the two match
[1:30:45] up again torn apart reunited that's the
[1:30:50] proof of the
[1:30:51] Covenant he says God making a covenant
[1:30:54] showing pre-show that I have sworn that
[1:30:56] I'll do it in your seed I'll bless all
[1:30:59] the nations of the world read it he says
[1:31:01] I'll bless the Gentiles I'll bless the
[1:31:02] black man the yellow man the white man
[1:31:04] I'll bless everyone through your seed
[1:31:06] for out of you will come Kings and
[1:31:07] princes how are you going to do it Lord
[1:31:09] he says I'll show you how and he showed
[1:31:11] him on the hillside where those pieces
[1:31:13] represented he says and any Bible
[1:31:16] scholar here knows that each one of
[1:31:18] those was a clean animal that
[1:31:19] represented the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:31:22] Christ he was the ram he was the heer
[1:31:25] that made the Waters of Separation when
[1:31:27] you had the Waters of Separation through
[1:31:29] he says now we have the washing of
[1:31:31] washing by the word by the Water by the
[1:31:33] word of the separation from sin through
[1:31:35] the word through
[1:31:36] believing he says and the pigeon and the
[1:31:39] turtle dove was Divine Healing that all
[1:31:42] was in
[1:31:44] Christ nowhere here do you see you and I
[1:31:48] in our in our natural side of things
[1:31:51] remember he says God took Abraham
[1:31:53] completely out of the Covenant God
[1:31:56] required death so he gave them a
[1:31:57] temporary covering in the garden by way
[1:31:59] of the death of an innocent lamb now
[1:32:01] he's coming to Abraham and he's saying
[1:32:03] now Abraham I'm going to atone for sin
[1:32:05] this is not just about a land of Canaan
[1:32:07] this is not just about the children of
[1:32:09] Israel this is about all of
[1:32:11] humanity All Families on Earth are going
[1:32:14] to be blessed he says I'm not going to
[1:32:16] do something temporary now I'll give you
[1:32:19] temporary for a while but something has
[1:32:21] to happen because the Deb load's
[1:32:23] building up and all I'm doing is
[1:32:24] covering the
[1:32:25] interest but it's just building and it's
[1:32:27] building and building and it's going to
[1:32:29] be messy and gruesome and Abraham you
[1:32:31] can't do it you don't have it in you to
[1:32:33] do it so I've got to take you out of the
[1:32:35] way and I'm going to do it and I'm going
[1:32:37] to do it alone I've got to pay the price
[1:32:40] I've got to take the only part that's
[1:32:41] available you can't do
[1:32:43] it he says the only thing you're going
[1:32:46] to know is that when the work's done
[1:32:48] you'll be back in my presence that's how
[1:32:50] you know it's done that's how you know
[1:32:51] it's effective is that you get to come
[1:32:53] back in my presence presence again
[1:32:55] Abram Abraham's all about having a son
[1:32:58] God's all about restoring the children
[1:33:00] restoring the family of God back to
[1:33:01] himself and he did it through a faithful
[1:33:03] line that started with Abraham we know
[1:33:05] that Christ did not come through any
[1:33:07] natural birth there's no natural DNA of
[1:33:09] Abraham up through the up through that
[1:33:11] line that came into Christ but Naturally
[1:33:13] Speaking when we look at it we would say
[1:33:14] he was a son of Abraham he was the son
[1:33:17] he was the Seed of Abraham that way amen
[1:33:19] but God's saying there's much more going
[1:33:21] on here Abraham than just this I'm going
[1:33:23] to do something in your day but this is
[1:33:25] going to be something that takes care of
[1:33:26] everything that's happened up to this
[1:33:28] point amen our blessing is in the the
[1:33:31] spiritual Seed of Abraham not in the
[1:33:32] natural seed God said I'm going to come
[1:33:35] down it was him walking in the midst I'm
[1:33:38] going to be torn apart I'm going to be
[1:33:40] made a mess of I'm going to be torn into
[1:33:43] two I'm going to be
[1:33:45] broken and in that will be an atonement
[1:33:49] for everything that's happened before
[1:33:50] this and what's he telling Abraham he
[1:33:52] puts him to sleep Abraham you can't
[1:33:55] start it you can't stop it you can't
[1:33:57] deserve it you can't do anything you're
[1:34:00] just the
[1:34:00] beneficiary and that's the grace of God
[1:34:03] you just get the
[1:34:06] benefits Israel under the law we know
[1:34:10] what happened brother Brandon would say
[1:34:11] that they turned down God and they took
[1:34:13] the law they chose a
[1:34:16] man and when he did it he gave them
[1:34:18] atonements and you go looking in
[1:34:20] Leviticus especially and they've got an
[1:34:21] atonement for everything they got an
[1:34:23] atonement at for diseases they got
[1:34:24] atonement for family issues they got
[1:34:26] atonement for mistakes and failures and
[1:34:28] sins and unknown sins and all these
[1:34:30] different things and every time you made
[1:34:32] an atonement something had to
[1:34:33] die and it was just animal after animal
[1:34:36] being di being killed and being killed
[1:34:38] and mess after mess and it was a bloody
[1:34:40] mess and all it did was was absorb the
[1:34:44] wrath of God temporarily that's all it
[1:34:46] was it never resolved anything it never
[1:34:49] changed people it never changed
[1:34:51] situations it just covered things up
[1:34:53] temporarily and God even ordained a day
[1:34:56] of atonement every year for people to
[1:34:58] dwell on all the wrong that they' done
[1:35:00] and we read it in L viticus and he says
[1:35:02] and the Lord God spake unto Moses saying
[1:35:04] also on the 10th day of the seventh
[1:35:06] month there shall be a day of atonement
[1:35:08] it shall be in holy convocation unto you
[1:35:10] and you shall afflict your souls and
[1:35:12] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[1:35:14] Lord he says you'll afflict your souls
[1:35:16] that word afflict means humiliate humble
[1:35:18] be down W bowed down with the weight
[1:35:21] basically dwell on all of your
[1:35:23] shortcoming and your failures and your
[1:35:25] flaws and your sins of the year not a
[1:35:28] fun
[1:35:29] day every year you had to dwell on why
[1:35:34] you were
[1:35:35] unworthy what a horrible
[1:35:38] Feast it's not this is not a Christmas
[1:35:40] event that's for
[1:35:42] sure sit there and go over in your mind
[1:35:45] how you failed every single day of this
[1:35:49] year how you thought you were doing so
[1:35:52] well and then you failed
[1:35:54] repeat repeat
[1:35:58] repeat they needed to be reminded why so
[1:36:01] they'd start looking for the
[1:36:03] solution so they'd say there's got to be
[1:36:06] a day where enough is enough where this
[1:36:09] can change where we can go back to the
[1:36:11] way we were he was developing a hunger
[1:36:13] and a thirst in them to be restored back
[1:36:16] it says and you shall do no work in that
[1:36:17] same day for it's a day of atonement to
[1:36:19] make an atonement for you before the
[1:36:21] Lord your God for whatsoever Soul it be
[1:36:23] that shall not be afflicted in that same
[1:36:25] day he shall be cut off from among his
[1:36:27] people he says you've got to take time
[1:36:28] out to realize what is going on in your
[1:36:31] life that you need me and that You' got
[1:36:34] to come the way that I tell you to he
[1:36:36] says and whosoever soul it shall be that
[1:36:37] doeth any work in that same day the same
[1:36:40] soul will I destroy from among his
[1:36:41] people God's law was serious and God
[1:36:43] said this is a serious deal you better
[1:36:45] do it he says or I'll cut you off from
[1:36:47] the whole Tabernacle you won't ever get
[1:36:49] in my presence
[1:36:51] again the day you eat thereof is the day
[1:36:53] you die
[1:36:54] he'll give them what they deserved by
[1:36:56] the law amen but what effect did this
[1:37:00] day of atonement have on the people
[1:37:02] except to cause sorrow shame
[1:37:05] embarrassment maybe
[1:37:07] fear it never changed
[1:37:10] them but it only reminded them of how
[1:37:12] separated they were from God that they
[1:37:15] needed him that they needed the blood of
[1:37:17] a lamb that they needed a sacrifice that
[1:37:19] they needed something greater than
[1:37:21] themselves it never lifted them up it
[1:37:24] always pushed them
[1:37:26] down like I said God was developing them
[1:37:29] in them a cry for a messiah for somebody
[1:37:31] that would take their sins that would
[1:37:33] make a way back to the presence of God
[1:37:36] but all this did was it held back the
[1:37:38] righteous Judgment of
[1:37:39] God and remember what would happen is
[1:37:42] that the priest had to go in and he had
[1:37:44] to go in for his own sins first and then
[1:37:46] when God accepted that he went in and he
[1:37:47] sacrificed for the entire nation and the
[1:37:50] people could take a collective sigh of
[1:37:53] of Rel
[1:37:54] when he came out that second time alive
[1:37:56] and God had accepted that sacrifice and
[1:37:58] they knew their sins were pushed back
[1:38:00] another
[1:38:01] year but in another year they would come
[1:38:03] back around and they're back in the same
[1:38:05] place waiting and seeing is he going to
[1:38:07] forgive us or is he
[1:38:09] not never change the people never change
[1:38:12] their desires never change their Natures
[1:38:15] just cover them
[1:38:18] temporarily Paul talks about in Hebrews
[1:38:20] 10 he says for the law having a shadow
[1:38:21] of good things to come and not the very
[1:38:24] image of the things he says it's
[1:38:25] pointing to something it's not the thing
[1:38:27] but it's pointing to something he says
[1:38:28] can never with those sacrifices which
[1:38:30] they offered yearby year continually
[1:38:33] make the comers there unto perfect he
[1:38:35] said for all of that every year coming
[1:38:37] in year after year day of atonement
[1:38:39] making sacrifices making atonements he
[1:38:41] says it never made them perfect and
[1:38:43] never made them acceptable In God's
[1:38:45] Presence never did he says for then
[1:38:48] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:38:50] if it was effective he says wouldn't
[1:38:52] they have stopped doing it
[1:38:54] he says because that the worshippers
[1:38:56] once Pur should not have had any more
[1:38:58] conscience of sin in other words if the
[1:38:59] atonement was truly
[1:39:01] effective wouldn't it take away the
[1:39:03] guilt on their conscience wouldn't it
[1:39:06] have taken away the
[1:39:07] nature that was causing them to
[1:39:10] sin he says but in those sacrifices
[1:39:13] there is a remembrance again made of
[1:39:15] sins every year nothing ever went away
[1:39:18] nothing was ever dealt with it just
[1:39:20] pushed it off it kicked the can down the
[1:39:22] road he says for is not possible that
[1:39:24] the blood of blls and goats should take
[1:39:26] away
[1:39:27] sins brother Brown would say it this way
[1:39:30] he says and under the Old Testament the
[1:39:32] law was when a man sinned he brought a
[1:39:33] lamb to the altar say if he transgressed
[1:39:36] any of The Commandments he brought the
[1:39:37] lamb and he laid it on the Altar and he
[1:39:39] laid his hands upon the lamb and he
[1:39:41] confessed his sins that he was wrong and
[1:39:43] knew that he was guilty the law required
[1:39:47] death this is our
[1:39:50] position he says and he brought the lamb
[1:39:52] in his said the throat of the Lamb was
[1:39:54] cut and it began to kick its little feet
[1:39:57] and bleeding he said if you've ever seen
[1:39:58] a lamb slaughtered what a pitiful cry
[1:40:01] the poor little fellow trying to bleed
[1:40:03] and his jugular vein is cut and he kicks
[1:40:05] and quivers and as he straightens out
[1:40:07] then Quivers again and bleeds and the
[1:40:09] blood gushes out it bathes his little
[1:40:11] wool in the worshipper hands and as the
[1:40:13] worshipper realiz him for committing
[1:40:15] adultery for lying stealing whatever his
[1:40:18] guilt was or even evil
[1:40:21] thinking he says what whatever it was in
[1:40:24] the least Shadow he was guilty because
[1:40:26] he was it was his nature now catch this
[1:40:28] he says he was a guilty person not maybe
[1:40:31] by desire but by Nature he was
[1:40:34] guilty Paul would talk about in Romans 7
[1:40:38] who will deliver me from this body of
[1:40:39] death when I want to do good evil is
[1:40:41] present with me and when I it just seems
[1:40:43] no matter what I do no matter where I go
[1:40:45] I can't do the thing that I want to do I
[1:40:48] intend to do it and then I don't do it I
[1:40:50] want to do it and then I don't do
[1:40:52] it
[1:40:54] he says and he had to recognize that
[1:40:56] this little innocent lamb died in his
[1:40:57] place and he felt sorry for the little
[1:40:59] thing you say I don't mean to do it
[1:41:01] brother John that doesn't matter if you
[1:41:03] do it in the eyes of God it doesn't
[1:41:06] matter under the law we're talking under
[1:41:08] the law we're talking you'd say God I
[1:41:10] didn't want to do it I got tricked into
[1:41:13] it can I say
[1:41:15] this if you keep getting tricked into
[1:41:17] something maybe you're not being so
[1:41:19] tricked after
[1:41:20] all if you know where you're going and
[1:41:23] you keep getting tricked you're not
[1:41:24] being tricked you're doing it willingly
[1:41:26] knowing what's going to happen that's
[1:41:28] iniquity and God deals with that
[1:41:30] completely differently for a child of
[1:41:32] God if you keep getting tricked in the
[1:41:35] same place doing the same thing you're
[1:41:37] fooling yourself that it's Satan and
[1:41:40] there's a desire that has to be taken
[1:41:41] care of inside of that little heart of
[1:41:43] ours I speak by experience amen you got
[1:41:46] to cut those things out brother Joe and
[1:41:48] I were talking just this week and I said
[1:41:50] listen I I was talking about social
[1:41:52] media I think I've shared over over the
[1:41:53] pulpit you go on to social media and
[1:41:55] they will offer things to you no matter
[1:41:56] what they've got an algorithm and
[1:41:58] they're trying to get you hooked and so
[1:42:00] they'll offer stuff and for guys
[1:42:02] eventually they're going to throw women
[1:42:03] at you no matter what you click or don't
[1:42:06] click they're going to throw it at you
[1:42:07] and I said enough is enough I'm not
[1:42:09] doing anything I ought not to do on here
[1:42:11] but they keep throwing it at me I said
[1:42:12] I've got to get that out of my life
[1:42:14] because eventually I'll click on
[1:42:16] it why cuz I'm a red-blooded man and in
[1:42:19] a moment of weakness I'll do something I
[1:42:21] not to do so what do I do I take it away
[1:42:24] knowing that that is the place of
[1:42:26] Temptation why CU Satan would say no no
[1:42:29] no every time you do that you'll get
[1:42:30] tricked no no no I know you're waiting
[1:42:32] for me there Satan so I just get you out
[1:42:35] okay I'm using my own life as an example
[1:42:37] so you don't think I'm preaching at you
[1:42:39] I'm saying that's what I've had to do
[1:42:41] because if he can knock me down it
[1:42:43] bleeds into the
[1:42:45] congregation I've got to hold a
[1:42:47] standard and Satan will use anything he
[1:42:49] can to knock me down and that Spirit can
[1:42:52] go right through the church
[1:42:54] amen let's stop him when we know where
[1:42:56] he's at let's not keep going
[1:42:59] back let's hold
[1:43:01] him don't walk on his land kick him off
[1:43:04] of
[1:43:06] yours he says and but that man as soon
[1:43:09] as that lamb died with the blood of the
[1:43:12] Lamb upon his hands he walked away from
[1:43:13] the building with the same desire in his
[1:43:15] heart that he had at the beginning why
[1:43:18] he says cuz life lays in the blood your
[1:43:20] life is in your blood and the life and
[1:43:22] the blood of the animal of the Lamb was
[1:43:23] animal life therefore when its little
[1:43:25] cor pusles were broken and the life went
[1:43:27] out of that animal it could not come
[1:43:29] back to the worshipper because the
[1:43:30] worshipper was a human being he says the
[1:43:33] blood made a covering but it could not
[1:43:36] perfectly atone we're talking about the
[1:43:39] full atonement tonight he says it could
[1:43:41] atone but not perfectly he says for the
[1:43:44] man left the building with the same
[1:43:46] desire to sin as he had in the first
[1:43:48] place so if you get a full atonement
[1:43:51] what'll it'll do it'll change
[1:43:54] you that's what a full atonement does is
[1:43:57] it doesn't cover it
[1:43:58] changes it changes the situation and it
[1:44:01] changes you he says but doing this he
[1:44:04] was looking forward to a time when there
[1:44:06] would come a perfect lamb come this was
[1:44:09] all a type it was pointing to God's
[1:44:11] Great provision and he did it on the
[1:44:13] burnt offering because it was the only
[1:44:15] way he knew about so you see when the
[1:44:17] blood was pouring the life went out from
[1:44:19] the animal it could not come back to the
[1:44:20] man for one was animal one was man
[1:44:23] he said an innocent animal to a guilty
[1:44:26] man and we see the brutal deaths of
[1:44:29] animal after animal after animal and
[1:44:31] what was it doing it was pointing to the
[1:44:33] righteous Judgment of
[1:44:35] God that was his right to claim
[1:44:38] death not that he wanted it not that
[1:44:42] he's a bloodthirsty God but he says
[1:44:43] that's what happens when you when you
[1:44:45] transgress my word and so you saw maybe
[1:44:48] millions and millions of animals killed
[1:44:51] to try and cover up those sins to hold
[1:44:53] off the wrath of a of a just God Amen
[1:44:56] but God's word has to be satisfied but
[1:44:59] the thing is he said I'm going to
[1:45:01] satisfy it I'll give you a temporary fix
[1:45:04] brother Matt you know all about
[1:45:05] temporary fixes don't you when you don't
[1:45:07] have the part you need you put one in
[1:45:09] that'll work for a short time it won't
[1:45:11] last the way it's supposed to but it's a
[1:45:13] temporary fix God says I'll give you
[1:45:15] something temporary until I come and fix
[1:45:17] the real
[1:45:19] issue think of it thousands of years now
[1:45:22] and what's happening is Adam and Eve
[1:45:26] they just do one little
[1:45:27] sin and it's a pile just one little
[1:45:31] thing but every year what happens is a
[1:45:33] pile just grows and grows and grows and
[1:45:36] the only thing that covers it is the
[1:45:37] millions and millions of animals that
[1:45:39] they're killing every year but the
[1:45:40] pile's still there the sin's still there
[1:45:44] the problem's still there the proof is
[1:45:45] still there the debt has not been paid
[1:45:49] and so it's just building and it's
[1:45:51] building and it's a building and look
[1:45:53] even before uh you know when Noah was
[1:45:55] there we talked about earlier where the
[1:45:57] thoughts of men were evil continually
[1:45:59] had got to the place where God wiped out
[1:46:01] the entire world except for eight people
[1:46:03] because of how bad it was that's how
[1:46:05] great the sin was in God's eyes he says
[1:46:06] I've got to destroy this and I'll start
[1:46:09] again with just eight and what did that
[1:46:12] do one of the eight was still
[1:46:14] bad cuz we're all born and sin shaped in
[1:46:17] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:46:19] even Noah his chosen vessel failed
[1:46:24] no matter what he did it did not resolve
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:27] issue the sin issue the unbelief issue
[1:46:31] and all that's building up what would it
[1:46:33] look like if we if we we we built up the
[1:46:36] sins I think I I spoke on this many a
[1:46:39] couple years ago where if you you said
[1:46:41] each one of us had a book of sins and I
[1:46:42] calculated we'd have if we had one word
[1:46:45] per sin we could do about a thousand
[1:46:46] pages in our life if we did a certain
[1:46:48] number every day we'd have enough books
[1:46:50] to go back into the moon back and forth
[1:46:51] back and forth many times that's the
[1:46:53] sins of the world built up what would
[1:46:55] the wrath of God look like if he truly
[1:46:57] judged us for
[1:46:58] that remember what we just read not just
[1:47:01] what you do what you think the attitude
[1:47:05] the
[1:47:06] response the
[1:47:09] inclination every single one of it
[1:47:11] building up and up and up I've told the
[1:47:13] story of how I dreamed of hell until I
[1:47:15] got the Holy Ghost and this is literally
[1:47:17] what it was was the
[1:47:18] inevitable Judgment of your sins coming
[1:47:21] back on you remember brother Rah says
[1:47:22] hell is solitary because you sit there
[1:47:26] and you think about everything you
[1:47:28] shouldn't have done that you did and
[1:47:31] everything you ought to have done that
[1:47:32] you
[1:47:33] didn't what a horrible place to be stuck
[1:47:36] there thinking it could have been
[1:47:40] different you say what does that wrath
[1:47:42] look
[1:47:43] like well we know what it looked like
[1:47:46] because he took it all out on Christ and
[1:47:48] Christ came down specifically to offer
[1:47:52] himself as a sacrifice to atone for our
[1:47:56] sins Isaiah 53 says who hath believed
[1:47:59] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:48:02] Lord
[1:48:04] revealed he's speaking of Christ now he
[1:48:06] says for he shall grow up before him as
[1:48:07] a tender plant and as a root out of a
[1:48:10] dry ground he had no form nor cless and
[1:48:13] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:48:15] that we should desire him he is despised
[1:48:18] and rejected of men in other words we
[1:48:22] turned our back on him as if he had done
[1:48:24] something
[1:48:28] wrong as if he was the
[1:48:32] problem he says a Man of Sorrows
[1:48:34] acquainted with grief we hid as it were
[1:48:36] our faces from him he was despised him
[1:48:39] we esteemed him not we wouldn't even
[1:48:40] look at him not even worthy of looking
[1:48:43] at
[1:48:45] him it says surely he had borne whose
[1:48:48] griefs
[1:48:50] ours and carried our sorrows yet we did
[1:48:55] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[1:48:57] Afflicted we're saying this was his
[1:48:59] fault he must have done something that's
[1:49:02] what the priesthood was saying when they
[1:49:04] crucified him and the people he must
[1:49:07] have done something wrong to deserve
[1:49:09] this we put it all on
[1:49:13] him it says he was wounded for our
[1:49:17] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:49:19] iniquities that word iniquities means
[1:49:21] for our depravity for doing Unthinkable
[1:49:24] and unspeakable things before a holy God
[1:49:28] and refusing to do the things he asked
[1:49:30] us to do so what we did was completely
[1:49:33] unacceptable before him and then we
[1:49:35] wouldn't even do what he asked us to do
[1:49:37] either he says the chastisement of our
[1:49:40] peace was upon him so in other words the
[1:49:42] punishment required to give us peace and
[1:49:44] rest God took it out on
[1:49:47] him it says and with his stripes we are
[1:49:50] healed he was with ripped and torn
[1:49:54] within an inch of his life they
[1:49:56] destroyed his back until the bones
[1:50:00] showed through it looked like raw
[1:50:02] hamburger hanging off of
[1:50:05] him so that we could be
[1:50:09] healed he did not say we were healed he
[1:50:13] did not say we would be healed he says
[1:50:15] we are healed yesterday today and
[1:50:20] forever that's why the birds weren't
[1:50:22] horn the pigeon and the dove those were
[1:50:24] what they held together there's no
[1:50:27] tearing them apart it's always available
[1:50:29] Divine Healing is always available to
[1:50:31] the children of
[1:50:33] God he says all we like sheep have gone
[1:50:38] astray
[1:50:40] all and we have turned everyone to his
[1:50:43] own way we've done what we thought was
[1:50:45] right what we thought was good what we
[1:50:48] thought was our
[1:50:51] right I'm a free man man I'm a free
[1:50:53] woman I can do whatever I want I can
[1:50:54] think whatever I want I can dress
[1:50:56] however I want I can be whoever I want
[1:50:58] to
[1:50:59] be right he paid the price for our
[1:51:03] decisions he says and the Lord ha laid
[1:51:05] on him the iniquity of us
[1:51:09] all I want to stop here as we start to
[1:51:12] close tonight because we're speaking on
[1:51:13] a price required and a price paid and I
[1:51:16] want us to see what we
[1:51:18] deserved I want to see us to see what
[1:51:21] we've been saved from
[1:51:23] well we've been spared
[1:51:25] tonight it says and there God showed
[1:51:27] Abraham what he was going to do through
[1:51:29] that seed of Isaac he would bring forth
[1:51:30] his only begotten son Christ and was
[1:51:32] slain Yonder between the heavens and
[1:51:34] earth when the sun went down and
[1:51:36] Blackness over the Earth he says and
[1:51:38] there he tore him
[1:51:40] apart tore him
[1:51:44] apart God pulled his soul out of him and
[1:51:47] he wrote a covenant with the families of
[1:51:49] the earth when that precious
[1:51:51] unadulterated blood of the almighty God
[1:51:53] dripping down emanuel's veins he says he
[1:51:55] tore that soul out of him and he said my
[1:51:58] God my God why hast Thou forsaken
[1:52:01] me all he knew was Unity with
[1:52:05] God he knew no sin he knew no smut he
[1:52:11] knew no Blackness he knew no Darkness he
[1:52:14] knew no
[1:52:15] fear and in the end God tore him apart
[1:52:19] so much that he took his own Spirit from
[1:52:22] him and the man the body was left saying
[1:52:26] my God my God why have you forsaken
[1:52:30] me he went from being pure as pure could
[1:52:35] be to as black and smutty as we could
[1:52:40] all lay on him every single thing that
[1:52:43] we've ever done collectively dumped on a
[1:52:46] vessel that only knew
[1:52:49] Holiness you take a shower
[1:52:53] and then you go outside and somebody
[1:52:54] throws you in the mud how you going to
[1:52:57] feel take that and multiply it by a
[1:52:59] million million million times and that
[1:53:02] what he felt he went from Pure as the
[1:53:04] driven snow to having every weight of
[1:53:07] every sin the feeling when we do
[1:53:10] something wrong how do we feel that
[1:53:12] guilt that embarrassment that shame he
[1:53:15] had that just dumped on him in one Fell
[1:53:17] Swoop from every one of us every sin in
[1:53:20] the past every sin in the present every
[1:53:22] sin in the future dumped on him and in
[1:53:24] the end he says God why have you
[1:53:26] forsaken
[1:53:28] me he said his face full of mockery spit
[1:53:31] a crown of cruel mockery pulled down
[1:53:33] over his brow his nails driven were
[1:53:35] Roman spikes his back Riven until his
[1:53:37] rib showed through swinging on the cross
[1:53:40] screaming dying a sinner's death and the
[1:53:43] sin of the world upon him and there God
[1:53:45] rived his side tore his soul out of him
[1:53:47] when he said into thy hands I commend my
[1:53:49] spirit and dropped his head and the
[1:53:51] Earth shook and belched out its Rock he
[1:53:53] says there he is there's God's covenant
[1:53:57] there's the fulfilling of it then he
[1:53:59] tore the soul of his own son and
[1:54:02] separated a covenant and he threw the
[1:54:05] body onto the
[1:54:08] ground tore the body
[1:54:11] apart but there's a covenant that he
[1:54:13] pulled out of
[1:54:15] that imagine now scripture says he who
[1:54:19] knew no sin became our
[1:54:23] sin he didn't just have sin he became
[1:54:29] sin he personified it he became
[1:54:33] it remember he was Prince of Peace
[1:54:37] Mighty God Everlasting
[1:54:40] father now his name is
[1:54:44] Sin Sin he became
[1:54:49] sin he was the man of sin he was a
[1:54:53] person of sin he wasn't
[1:54:55] just holding it he became
[1:54:58] it he was the despised and rejected
[1:55:03] one the fullness of God in
[1:55:06] flesh became the effect and the weight
[1:55:11] and the fruit of every bad and wrong and
[1:55:17] evil thing we've ever
[1:55:20] done like that
[1:55:24] the weight of the sins of a hundred
[1:55:26] billion people on
[1:55:30] them body wrecked destroyed mangled
[1:55:34] beyond
[1:55:35] recognition Isaiah said as many were
[1:55:37] astonished at thee his Visage his face
[1:55:40] was so marred more than any other man
[1:55:43] and his form more than the sons of men
[1:55:45] he looked worse than any man has ever
[1:55:48] looked what it means here is that he
[1:55:50] didn't look like a man anymore more
[1:55:53] that's how beat up he was that's how
[1:55:55] wrecked he was that's how destroyed his
[1:55:57] body was prophet of God said God gave
[1:55:59] him a body that could take the abuse and
[1:56:02] live because it would have killed any
[1:56:04] other of us he gave him a body that was
[1:56:07] built to handle the suffering long
[1:56:08] enough for him to fulfill every portion
[1:56:10] of the scriptures that were written
[1:56:12] about him and then he would voluntarily
[1:56:13] give up his
[1:56:16] life Isaiah 53 continues it says he was
[1:56:19] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[1:56:22] not his mouth he's brought as a SL lamb
[1:56:24] to the slaughter and as a sheep before
[1:56:26] her shears is dumb so he openeth not his
[1:56:28] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[1:56:31] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:56:32] generation for he was cut off out of the
[1:56:34] land of the living and for the
[1:56:36] transgression of my people was he
[1:56:38] stricken and he made his grave with the
[1:56:40] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:56:42] because what he had done no violence
[1:56:45] neither was there any deceit in his
[1:56:47] mouth he hadn't done a
[1:56:50] thing catch for verse 10 yet it pre
[1:56:54] pleased the Lord to bruise him to crush
[1:56:58] him to break him this is the bruising
[1:57:02] that was talked about in Genesis 3 you
[1:57:04] say Satan bruised him death bruised him
[1:57:07] but God poured his wrath out on that
[1:57:10] body the scripture says that it
[1:57:12] literally pleased
[1:57:14] God to just pour it out all on
[1:57:17] him did God enjoy it that's not what it
[1:57:20] means by pleasing
[1:57:22] he could unload it he could get it off
[1:57:25] the books you business owners when you
[1:57:28] got when you're in the red what are you
[1:57:29] trying to do you're trying to get the
[1:57:30] debts off and God's trying to get the
[1:57:32] debts off the book He's pleased because
[1:57:35] this the debt is being satisfied the
[1:57:37] price is being paid and when the price
[1:57:39] is paid and an atonement is made now he
[1:57:41] can start the process of bringing his
[1:57:43] children back that's why it pleased him
[1:57:45] but he had to do it because he's a
[1:57:46] righteous God and judgment has to follow
[1:57:49] the law amen because out of this would
[1:57:52] come something that was far
[1:57:55] greater and Christ it says took it all
[1:57:57] without
[1:57:59] complaint somebody says something to us
[1:58:01] and we flash
[1:58:02] off and he took out the sin of every
[1:58:05] single human being on this planet and
[1:58:07] never opened his mouth once to defend
[1:58:10] himself yet knowing he had done nothing
[1:58:12] wrong knowing not believing knowing he
[1:58:16] had done nothing wrong his face so beat
[1:58:19] up that he didn't even look like a man
[1:58:20] anymore his back shredded looked like
[1:58:23] hamburger hanging in shreds off of his
[1:58:26] back his rib showing through that was
[1:58:29] what I
[1:58:30] deserved that's what I should have
[1:58:32] looked like that's what you should have
[1:58:34] looked like under the law of God under
[1:58:37] the word of God under judgment under
[1:58:39] righteous judgment I should have had to
[1:58:41] do
[1:58:42] that but he took it he took it for you
[1:58:45] he took it for me and what is it he
[1:58:47] tread The Wine Press of God's Wrath
[1:58:51] alone
[1:58:52] he did it willingly laid his life down
[1:58:56] as a
[1:58:57] sacrifice that specially made body he
[1:59:00] sacrificed it he laid it all on the line
[1:59:02] for you and I that we could benefit that
[1:59:05] we could be under a total and full
[1:59:09] atonement I want to just read this in
[1:59:11] the Amplified in verse 10 it says that
[1:59:13] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:59:15] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:59:17] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:59:19] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:59:21] his hand so see what happens there as we
[1:59:23] have yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:59:24] him then there's a period of time he put
[1:59:27] him to grief a longer period of time and
[1:59:30] then it says out of that comes this
[1:59:32] great thing it says he shall see his he
[1:59:35] shall when you and he make his life an
[1:59:37] offering for sin and he's risen from the
[1:59:39] dead in the time to come he shall see
[1:59:41] his spiritual Offspring you know who
[1:59:43] that is you and I this is the joy that
[1:59:46] lay before Christ why he did it he says
[1:59:49] he'll prolong his days and the will and
[1:59:51] pleasure of of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:59:53] his
[1:59:54] hand it says he shall see the travail of
[1:59:57] his soul he'll see what he went
[2:00:00] through you saw what he did in the in
[2:00:02] the Garden of Gethsemane that's where he
[2:00:04] travailed and he travailed so much that
[2:00:07] he sweated drops of
[2:00:09] blood and then he travailed on the cross
[2:00:12] so much that the blood and the water
[2:00:15] separated that's how hard he suffered
[2:00:18] that's how hard he worked to stay in the
[2:00:20] will of God
[2:00:22] he says he shall see the travail of his
[2:00:24] soul and he shall be satisfied
[2:00:28] Hallelujah when God satisfied that's all
[2:00:30] that matters when God says the debt is
[2:00:33] paid that means the debt is paid that
[2:00:35] when Satan comes our way and tries to
[2:00:37] lay it on us you could say he said he
[2:00:39] was
[2:00:40] satisfied the debt is paid you can't
[2:00:43] hold me with that it's under the blood
[2:00:46] he took the price he took the debt he
[2:00:49] paid it God is s Saied it doesn't exist
[2:00:53] it ain't on the Bucks
[2:00:55] anymore sinless spotless today because
[2:00:59] of what he did God was satisfied that
[2:01:02] means no more sacrifices needed that
[2:01:04] means no law is
[2:01:06] needed that means no more days of
[2:01:09] atonement it means god is
[2:01:13] done with dealing with us through
[2:01:16] animals and he's now ready to come
[2:01:19] back and deal with us as Sons and
[2:01:21] Daughters Direct
[2:01:22] he says and by his knowledge shall my
[2:01:24] righteous servant justify many for he
[2:01:27] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[2:01:29] will I divide him a portion with the
[2:01:31] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[2:01:33] the strong because he ha poured out his
[2:01:35] soul unto death and he was numbered with
[2:01:38] the transgressors and he bear the sin of
[2:01:40] many and made intercession for the
[2:01:43] transgressors what did he say he said
[2:01:46] I'm going to bruise his heel I'm going
[2:01:48] to bruise his head he's going to bruise
[2:01:49] my
[2:01:50] heel but he said it's going to be a full
[2:01:53] atonement it's going to
[2:01:55] unravel this sick twisted thing he's
[2:01:58] tried to do with humanity and I'll
[2:02:01] redeem my people and bring them back to
[2:02:03] where they can be my children where they
[2:02:04] can be my bride at my side where they
[2:02:06] can come into my presence where they can
[2:02:09] stand and they can ask and they can pray
[2:02:11] and I'll hear them and I'll answer them
[2:02:13] and I'll lead them and I'll guide them
[2:02:14] and I'll feed them and I'll provide for
[2:02:16] them I'll give them
[2:02:20] rest
[2:02:25] it was Satan that bruised him
[2:02:27] absolutely it was Satan that drove that
[2:02:30] thorn of death into
[2:02:32] him but he didn't drive it in prophet of
[2:02:35] God would say he saw it coming and he
[2:02:36] took it and he anchored it in him that
[2:02:39] Stinger of death he says and it killed
[2:02:41] that
[2:02:43] bee and he doesn't have a stinger
[2:02:45] anymore he'll take you but he can't keep
[2:02:50] you Christ God in flesh took every punch
[2:02:54] took every stroke of that loaded
[2:02:56] whip if any of you have ever seen that
[2:02:59] that movie The Passion of the
[2:03:02] Christ you watch that whipping scene and
[2:03:04] they start with just a light
[2:03:06] Whip and what happens is Jesus doesn't
[2:03:09] Buckle under it and so what they do is
[2:03:11] they take out that cat of Ninetails and
[2:03:14] it's a long whip and in the end they've
[2:03:16] just got 90 degree angles of
[2:03:18] Steel and you see a scene there where
[2:03:20] they take it and they they try it out on
[2:03:22] a table of wood first and it hits the
[2:03:25] wood and it Yanks wood chunks out and
[2:03:28] then they turn around and they start
[2:03:30] going one by one two men back and forth
[2:03:32] because it takes energy to do it and
[2:03:34] they wore themselves
[2:03:36] out ripping his back apart with
[2:03:40] steel and you see the final picture and
[2:03:43] this is just a movie church it was worse
[2:03:45] than that and you see Christ and he's
[2:03:48] tied to the post and his hands are up
[2:03:51] and there's just 10 or 15 ft of blood
[2:03:55] and muscle in One Direction and in
[2:03:57] another where those two men just threw
[2:03:59] that whip at him and then yanked the
[2:04:00] flesh out threw it in yanked it out
[2:04:03] until what his whole back was just
[2:04:06] nothing just a
[2:04:08] mess ribs showing
[2:04:11] through his whole body
[2:04:15] exposed why so you and I could have our
[2:04:19] healing he kept himself there
[2:04:22] so we could have our
[2:04:25] healing he says when we look at Christ
[2:04:27] you see the penalty the only one God
[2:04:30] himself made flesh God coming to the
[2:04:32] Earth and he took on him the sin of all
[2:04:34] of us and the judgment and the wrath of
[2:04:36] almighty God was poured out upon his
[2:04:38] body and there it was Riven at the cross
[2:04:41] that's the real judgment he tread The
[2:04:42] Wine Press of the wrath of God
[2:04:45] Alone we've got each other many
[2:04:48] times but everyone forsook him that day
[2:04:52] he says alone he walked the road alone
[2:04:55] he died with no help from an angel from
[2:04:57] a man from his church from his mother
[2:04:58] from his Brethren from his father
[2:05:00] forsaken by God man and nature he was so
[2:05:04] forsaken that Earth wouldn't accept him
[2:05:06] and Heaven wouldn't either so he had to
[2:05:07] die in between he died alone to show us
[2:05:11] that even nature itself can't help us in
[2:05:14] the hour of death there's no friend no
[2:05:16] Priest No Pope no Pastor it's death he
[2:05:19] says but there was one who took it for
[2:05:24] us church we
[2:05:26] fail we fail so many
[2:05:30] times and if we think about a righteous
[2:05:32] God we say why is he not taking it out
[2:05:35] on
[2:05:37] me because he took it out on him he
[2:05:40] doesn't need to beat you he beat Christ
[2:05:43] he doesn't need to whip you he whipped
[2:05:45] Christ he doesn't need to crush you he
[2:05:47] crushed
[2:05:48] Christ so you're sitting there and
[2:05:50] you're saying I deserve more you do
[2:05:52] deserve more I deserve more but he
[2:05:56] already took it out the wrath of God has
[2:05:59] been
[2:06:00] satisfied that's why we don't get what
[2:06:03] we deserve
[2:06:04] anymore but remember there's always
[2:06:07] consequences but the consequences are
[2:06:09] not what you
[2:06:11] deserve consequences are what you sow
[2:06:14] and that is not what you deserve you
[2:06:16] deserve death under the law but he
[2:06:18] satisfied the law he brought a perfect
[2:06:20] atonement and so we sit there and we say
[2:06:23] God or we look at
[2:06:27] others remember brother brandom God why
[2:06:30] don't you just wipe it all off the
[2:06:32] Earth God came and he showed him that
[2:06:36] slap every time we sin that was Christ
[2:06:40] getting slapped in the face every
[2:06:43] time brother Braham had a lot more grace
[2:06:45] after
[2:06:46] that but that's what we deserve was to
[2:06:48] be wiped
[2:06:50] off but he paid need it he made an
[2:06:53] atonement for
[2:06:55] us he said what did he do the wrath of
[2:06:59] God was upon us for being Sinners is
[2:07:01] that right no one could save himself
[2:07:04] there's nothing we could do we're all
[2:07:05] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[2:07:07] the world speaking lies and what did he
[2:07:09] do he came to the Earth Hallelujah and
[2:07:11] he trod the wine press all the wrath of
[2:07:14] almighty God was poured out upon him he
[2:07:18] quotes Revelation Thou Art Worthy oh
[2:07:19] Lamb of God for you were slain
[2:07:22] taking the sins of the world upon him
[2:07:24] and he bore our sin that God poured out
[2:07:27] the fierceness of his wrath upon him he
[2:07:29] says never a man died like that man he
[2:07:33] suffered until the blood and the water
[2:07:36] separated in his
[2:07:38] body this is what we
[2:07:41] deserved and at the end of it says when
[2:07:45] Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
[2:07:47] he said it is
[2:07:49] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[2:07:51] up the
[2:07:52] ghost what atonement had been
[2:07:56] paid and
[2:07:59] accepted it's not the end of the story
[2:08:02] but the price was
[2:08:04] paid it says and behold you want to know
[2:08:07] if it was an effective atonement it says
[2:08:09] and behold the veil of the temple was
[2:08:11] rent in two from the top to the bottom
[2:08:14] remember he had the outer Court you had
[2:08:15] the inner court and then you had the
[2:08:16] holy of holies and that's where the very
[2:08:18] presence of God was the shikina glory of
[2:08:20] God and only one person could go in
[2:08:23] there once a
[2:08:24] year and they had this massive curtain
[2:08:27] that was there and it was soundproof and
[2:08:28] it was thick and baffled and it was
[2:08:30] supposed to just take everything from
[2:08:32] the outside and block it out and it was
[2:08:33] just you with God and only the high
[2:08:35] priest would go in there once a year and
[2:08:37] when Christ died that that that veil was
[2:08:39] torn from the top to the bottom showing
[2:08:42] who did it God did what was he saying
[2:08:46] access granted you can come back red or
[2:08:50] yellow black or white sinner whatever
[2:08:53] access back to God has been granted and
[2:08:56] there's another place to meet him now
[2:08:58] and it's not in a temple like
[2:08:59] that but he was going to meet him
[2:09:01] someplace else he was going to meet him
[2:09:03] by way of his Covenant
[2:09:06] amen the Covenant wasn't fulfilled but
[2:09:10] the price was
[2:09:11] paid because remember the Covenant is a
[2:09:14] tearing
[2:09:15] apart but then there's a putting back
[2:09:17] together
[2:09:19] again he tore it apart
[2:09:22] now he's got to put it back together
[2:09:25] again you can only enforce the Covenant
[2:09:27] when both halves are there and what's he
[2:09:30] got to do he's got to take what he tore
[2:09:31] out of Christ and put it back together
[2:09:33] again to satisfy his promise to his
[2:09:37] children he's unraveling the effects of
[2:09:40] sin the musicians would
[2:09:42] come Paul said it this way but God
[2:09:46] commendeth his love toward us and that
[2:09:48] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[2:09:51] for us amen God bless you let's
[2:09:56] stand there's no deserving
[2:09:59] this there's no working in a way that'll
[2:10:02] somehow make it easier or
[2:10:06] better there's nothing you can
[2:10:10] do to satisfy God's
[2:10:13] requirement for
[2:10:15] sin but what you can do is take his
[2:10:18] provided
[2:10:19] way that's a great greatest thing that
[2:10:21] God could ever ask us to do is say take
[2:10:24] my provided
[2:10:25] way don't try anything just take my way
[2:10:29] that's how we show him we love him
[2:10:31] that's how we show we accept him is when
[2:10:33] we say I'll take your way I'll take the
[2:10:36] price you
[2:10:37] paid and then I won't let Satan keep
[2:10:39] trying to make me pay it so many times
[2:10:41] the things that hold us back are because
[2:10:43] we think we don't deserve it we don't
[2:10:46] deserve it but he makes us worthy I
[2:10:50] don't make myself worth if he calls me
[2:10:52] now into his presence then I want to be
[2:10:54] in his presence if he says you're worthy
[2:10:56] then I'll say I'm worthy if he says
[2:10:58] you're spotless then I'll say I'm
[2:10:59] spotless and I'm not going to let Satan
[2:11:01] tell me otherwise I'm not going to let
[2:11:03] me tell me otherwise amen but I'm going
[2:11:06] to take the effect of what he did here
[2:11:08] on the atonement and say I take his
[2:11:10] righteousness CU he took my sin that's
[2:11:13] the swap he gave us that's the trade
[2:11:15] that happened at Calvary was he said I'm
[2:11:17] going to take your place and you get to
[2:11:18] take my place and there's a benefit
[2:11:21] there's a blessing under that and
[2:11:22] there's access to God that comes under
[2:11:24] that robe of
[2:11:25] righteousness but there's a restoration
[2:11:28] that's going on in all of this there's a
[2:11:30] Redemption that's going on and it's
[2:11:32] bringing back all that were torn apart
[2:11:33] in Christ prophet of God would say he
[2:11:36] says you aren't even judged now he says
[2:11:38] because you were in Christ on that cross
[2:11:40] and you took every punishment you were
[2:11:42] ever going to take right then and there
[2:11:44] you were in Christ
[2:11:45] then he says and you're in Christ
[2:11:48] now
[2:11:50] amen what a glorious place we stand in
[2:11:52] this evening every sin taken care of if
[2:11:56] our conscience bothers
[2:11:58] us he's greater than our
[2:12:01] conscience he's just and quick to
[2:12:04] forgive amen there ought to be no fear
[2:12:08] to come into the presence of God you
[2:12:10] know we're going to take communion in a
[2:12:12] few
[2:12:13] minutes and the scripture says that
[2:12:15] you're not supposed to eat
[2:12:18] unworthily that doesn't mean that we
[2:12:19] don't make mistakes
[2:12:21] it means make it right before you
[2:12:25] partake don't let Satan hold you back
[2:12:28] don't let your mistakes don't let a
[2:12:30] besetting sin don't let a habit don't
[2:12:31] let a whatever it could be that Satan
[2:12:33] would throw your way hold you back from
[2:12:35] coming up and saying I'm taking the full
[2:12:37] atonement here I'm taking the emblems of
[2:12:39] his atonement tonight and in that is our
[2:12:41] healing in that is our deliverance in
[2:12:43] that is our provision everything that we
[2:12:46] have need of is in that atonement we'll
[2:12:48] see but we've got to accept it we've got
[2:12:51] to say that was an atonement for
[2:12:53] me not just for my brother not just for
[2:12:56] my sister not just Mom not just dad not
[2:12:58] just Nan not just pop that was for
[2:13:01] me he became my sin so that I could take
[2:13:05] on his righteousness and that's why
[2:13:07] we're coming tonight is because he
[2:13:09] called us to do it he told us to do it
[2:13:11] he made a way for us to do it to stand
[2:13:14] in his very presence accepted in the
[2:13:18] Beloved and he'll withhold no good thing
[2:13:20] from us
[2:13:22] he's trying to bring us back to Eden and
[2:13:24] we're on that road amen let's bow our
[2:13:28] heads Heavenly
[2:13:32] Father Lord May nothing hold us back
[2:13:34] from your
[2:13:36] presence Lord May nothing hold us back
[2:13:38] from seeking
[2:13:40] you Lord let us not try and look at our
[2:13:43] worthiness or our Good Deeds or gifts or
[2:13:46] whatever we might have
[2:13:47] Lord but Lord may we just come humbly to
[2:13:50] your throne of Grace and say Lord we're
[2:13:53] here because you
[2:13:54] called lord and we're just trusting you
[2:13:56] to complete the work you've started in

[2:14:14] create a picture of words here this
[2:14:16] evening Lord but we can't imagine the
[2:14:20] agony Lord and
[2:14:22] alone completely forsaken by God and man
[2:14:27] Lord and you did it so that you could
[2:14:28] bring us back into relationship and
[2:14:30] fellowship with you Lord how we worship
[2:14:33] you and praise you for it Lord we thank
[2:14:34] you for your goodness Lord we thank you

[2:14:44] serve you more and more each day Lord

[2:14:49] us this evening Lord May there be
[2:14:52] Deliverance May there be healing May

[2:23:36] 11 1 Corinthians chap 11 I'll read the
[2:23:40] first verse in the congregation the next
[2:23:42] and we'll alternate and I'll join
[2:23:44] together on the 34th verse as we
[2:23:47] normally
[2:23:49] do
[2:23:55] 1 Corinthians
[2:23:59] 11:23 Paul says for I have received of
[2:24:01] the Lord that which also I delivered
[2:24:04] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[2:24:06] night in which he was betrayed took
[2:24:19] bread and after the same manner also he
[2:24:22] took the cup when he had sued saying
[2:24:25] this cup is the New Testament in my
[2:24:27] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[2:24:29] it in remembrance of
[2:24:36] [Music]
[2:24:38] me wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[2:24:41] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:24:42] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:24:45] and blood of the
[2:24:49] Lord
[2:24:54] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:24:55] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:24:58] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:25:06] body for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:25:10] should not be
[2:25:18] judged he didn't say will be destroyed
[2:25:21] he said I'll chasen you I'll bring you
[2:25:23] back to what's right he says wherefore
[2:25:26] my brethren when you come together to
[2:25:28] eat t one for another and if any man
[2:25:32] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[2:25:35] not together unto
[2:25:37] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[2:25:40] order when I come
