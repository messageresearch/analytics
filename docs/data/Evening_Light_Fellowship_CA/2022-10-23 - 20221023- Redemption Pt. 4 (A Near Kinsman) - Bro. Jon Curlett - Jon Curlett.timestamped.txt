[49:14] have an announcement this morning and
[49:16] one of Paul and sister Kimberly have
[49:18] asked me to announce that they have a
[49:20] baby that will be due in late May or
[49:22] early June Lord Willie so we praise the
[49:25] Lord for that I believe what happened is

[49:44] and bring it all the way to a healthy
[49:47] baby amen as the Lord would bless them
[49:49] amen God bless you it's good to be here
[49:51] in service again this morning we're
[49:53] going to pick right up where we left off
[49:54] in the last service and Revelation 5
[49:57] verse 1 says and I saw on the right hand
[49:59] of him that sat on the throne a book
[50:01] written within and on the back side
[50:03] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[50:05] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[50:07] noise who is worthy to open the book and
[50:10] to loose the seals thereof and no man in
[50:13] Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the
[50:14] Earth was able to open the book neither
[50:17] to look thereon and I wept much because
[50:20] no man was found worthy to open and to
[50:22] read the book neither to look there upon
[50:24] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[50:27] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[50:29] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[50:32] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[50:34] Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the
[50:37] midst of the throne and of the four
[50:38] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[50:40] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[50:43] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[50:45] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[50:48] the Earth
[50:49] and he came and took the book out of the
[50:52] right hand of him that sat upon the
[50:54] throne and when he had taken the book
[50:56] The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty
[50:58] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[51:00] every one of them Harps and golden vials
[51:02] full of odors which are the prayers of
[51:04] saints and they sung a new song
[51:07] amen do we sing a new song this morning
[51:10] don't we amen they were under the law of
[51:12] sin and death but all of a sudden
[51:13] something happened and now they sang a
[51:15] new song and they said Thou Art Worthy
[51:17] to take the book and to open the seals
[51:20] thereof for thou was slain and Hast
[51:22] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[51:25] every Kindred and tongue and Nate people
[51:27] and nation and has made us unto God our
[51:31] God Kings and Priests Our God Amen this
[51:35] is a personal God and it's not just a
[51:37] God but our God and has made us unto our
[51:40] God Kings and Priests and we shall reign
[51:43] on the earth amen God bless you can have
[51:45] your seats this morning and as I

[51:49] with our series on Redemption and this
[51:51] morning I want to take a title of a near
[51:53] Kinsman

[51:56] familiar for us but we're building a
[51:58] platform we're building a foundation so
[52:00] we can go a little higher and a little
[52:01] deeper as we go through these things and

[52:07] out the fact that on our phone uh on on
[52:09] our own certainly on our phone
[52:12] um we are not worthy amen you'll never
[52:14] find your phone makes you worthy amen
[52:16] but on our own in our flesh in our
[52:18] fallen condition we could never be
[52:20] worthy even if we lived a perfect life
[52:22] we said we could not be worthy if you
[52:25] remember and we talked about it because
[52:27] our very birth is condemned our very
[52:29] birth is sinful and because of that even
[52:31] if you lived a perfect life you were not
[52:33] an acceptable sacrifice for us amen we
[52:35] couldn't meet the standard of Holiness
[52:37] or righteousness that God had that God
[52:39] requires by his word and because of that
[52:42] that meant that we could never come
[52:43] fully into the presence of God be
[52:45] restored back to the fellowship that's
[52:46] required to give us dominion and eternal
[52:49] life as we need it amen amen so in other
[52:51] words we were without hope
[52:53] we were without hope and even today
[52:55] people are without hope until they
[52:57] realize that in and of themself they
[52:59] can't make it amen it's a it's a world
[53:01] of self-love if you notice these days
[53:03] and and they say love yourself and
[53:05] you're great the way you are and all of
[53:07] these things and guess what we are great
[53:08] the way we are if we fall into God's
[53:11] purpose and plan to use what we are amen
[53:13] but there still has to come A change in
[53:15] and of ourselves and our minds will
[53:16] never get us there our education will
[53:18] never get us there the the good raising
[53:20] of our parents will never get us there
[53:22] there is no hope in this Fallen flesh
[53:24] for us if we don't have a change in our
[53:26] bodies and in our minds amen
[53:28] we looked at what it took to to even
[53:30] keep God's Wrath off of us and it was
[53:32] death
[53:33] death was a requirement there had to be
[53:35] blood and and that was the the proof
[53:37] that a price has been paid was always
[53:39] that there was blood somewhere and he
[53:40] could see that blood amen and we know we
[53:43] read it in the last service in Romans 6
[53:45] 23 it says for the wages of sin is death
[53:48] in other words the price that has to be
[53:50] paid for sin is death every single time
[53:52] but the gift of God is eternal life
[53:55] through Jesus Christ Our Lord then we
[53:57] finish with this this scripture in
[53:59] Romans 5 6 to give us some hope and
[54:01] we're getting into the hopeful part now
[54:03] we're getting into the good part amen we
[54:05] went down in the valley last time in the
[54:07] in the Valley of the shadow of death is
[54:09] where we were yesterday or away in the
[54:11] last service because we are in our human
[54:12] condition and that's where death lies
[54:14] but then we read this scripture to
[54:16] finish out and it says for when we were
[54:18] yet without strength in other words when
[54:20] we couldn't do it on our own in due time
[54:22] Christ died for the ungodly amen so we
[54:25] want to talk about our great Redeemer
[54:27] this morning and we know he couldn't
[54:28] have been exactly like us because
[54:31] exactly like us has failed amen we know
[54:33] that he had to be related and that he
[54:35] couldn't come by natural bloodline the
[54:37] way that we have amen and so when we
[54:39] look at that if we realize that he came
[54:41] a different way and by a different
[54:42] bloodline then you also have to realize
[54:44] that your bloodline is not what you
[54:46] think it is and your family is not what
[54:48] you think it is amen because if he's
[54:50] going to redeem you you've got to be in
[54:52] his family he doesn't come to your
[54:53] family but he brings you to him amen so
[54:55] you've got to recognize that there's
[54:57] something above and beyond this body in
[54:59] this family that you've been born into a
[55:01] church you've come into and all these
[55:02] different things you've got to realize
[55:04] there's a different bloodline there's a
[55:06] different father that's there there's a
[55:07] different Spirits that's there and
[55:09] that's what unites him with him that's
[55:10] what makes him a near Kinsman is not
[55:12] where you stand today but where you
[55:14] stand in relation to him and in that
[55:16] Royal bloodline amen it's a natural it's
[55:18] not a natural bloodline it's a spiritual
[55:20] bloodline and it's a it's a Royal
[55:21] bloodline and it's a it's a it's a
[55:23] bloodline of Kings and Priests as we
[55:25] just read in Revelations amen amen we're
[55:28] not all Kings and Priests here now if we
[55:30] look at it the sisters don't even
[55:31] qualify for yet but yet in his bloodline
[55:33] we are all Kings and Priests with him
[55:35] amen
[55:37] we know that redeemers we talked about
[55:39] this last time they only come to redeem
[55:40] those that are in the family
[55:42] you can't be a redeemer if you're not a
[55:44] member of the family amen and so what
[55:46] did they do they only come to redeem
[55:48] those that are lost
[55:49] those that are missing something those
[55:51] that are broken those that are sick
[55:53] those that are out of the original place
[55:55] of inheritance the land or the position
[55:57] or the place that God gave them amen so
[56:00] amen if you think you're good you can't
[56:02] be redeemed if you think you are whole
[56:04] you can't be redeemed If You Think You
[56:05] Are Holy you can't be redeemed because
[56:07] your recognition is that you have need
[56:09] of nothing it's the laodicean condition
[56:11] I don't need a redeemer I don't need
[56:13] more because I have everything I need
[56:15] amen so he's not coming back because
[56:17] you're in a state of perfection or a
[56:19] state of health or a state of
[56:20] spirituality because he had lots of that
[56:23] when Jesus Christ came on the earth they
[56:25] had lots of spirituality they had great
[56:27] men Good Wonderful ministers and all
[56:29] these different things but that wasn't
[56:30] what he came for he came for those that
[56:32] were what lost he came for those that
[56:34] were in prison he came for those that
[56:36] were bound he came for those whose
[56:38] Hearts have been broken that's the ones
[56:40] that he came for so to be redeemed you
[56:41] have to be in a broken lost failed
[56:43] condition and until you get to that
[56:45] place you'll never recognize your need
[56:47] for a redeemer amen but what we know
[56:49] know that before all of that you are
[56:51] deemed healthy you were deemed whole you
[56:53] were deemed worthwhile you were deemed
[56:56] perfect you are deemed spotless before
[56:58] the foundation of the world but we drop
[56:59] into this condition and this is what we
[57:01] need to be redeemed back out of amen and
[57:04] we talked about how the beauty of
[57:05] redemption is that it doesn't look at
[57:07] you
[57:08] amen Redemption doesn't look at you but
[57:10] it looks at the one that is redeeming it
[57:12] looks at the sacrifice and says is that
[57:14] perfect and if that's perfect then they
[57:16] don't care what you say they don't care
[57:17] what you do all they're looking at is is
[57:19] that sacrifice perfect and so for us we
[57:21] had a perfect sacrifice and it was our
[57:23] Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet would
[57:25] say this and the message it is I he says
[57:27] he's praying at the beginning he says we
[57:29] just humbly bow our heads in humiliation
[57:31] Lord
[57:32] I noticed he doesn't say humility he
[57:35] says in humiliation
[57:37] why because we are worthless
[57:39] there's nothing we're bringing here
[57:40] there's even in our greatest state in
[57:43] our greatest day yet we fail him
[57:46] so he says we come in our bow our heads
[57:48] in humiliation Lord and thank you to
[57:50] know that we were once alienated from
[57:52] God without hope without Christ without
[57:55] God and why we were yet sinners Christ
[57:58] died in our stead to reconcile us back
[58:00] to the great family of God so we could
[58:03] not be able Lord by human speech to ever
[58:05] express the Adoration of our hearts for
[58:07] thy goodness and mercy to us but father
[58:10] in our simple humble childlike way
[58:14] receive our Thanksgiving Lord
[58:17] amen I love brother Dale's prayer this
[58:19] morning how many times did he say Lord
[58:20] we thank you and we love you and we
[58:23] appreciate you why because we're sitting
[58:25] in a place of redemption having no
[58:27] worthiness that ever will bring us back
[58:29] to it amen it's all his work in the last
[58:32] Source we spoke of Adam and how he was
[58:34] the Perfect Image the perfect reflection
[58:36] of God in human form amen and we know he
[58:38] was the son of God he was a Son of God
[58:40] if you look in the lineage it goes back
[58:42] to Abram and or Adam and it says he was
[58:44] who was the son of God Amen but yet in
[58:47] that he paid up he he fell out of the
[58:50] will of God he fell out of the word of
[58:52] God and in doing that he had to pay a
[58:54] price and the price for unbelief for sin
[58:57] was death and that's all we've had ever
[58:58] since Adam a Son of God brought us to
[59:01] death
[59:03] amen and then God set that precedent and
[59:05] we spoke last time and I'm just covering
[59:06] it briefly because we want to build on
[59:08] this this morning that death was
[59:10] supposed to take hold of Adam and Eve as
[59:12] soon as they sinned because he said the
[59:14] day you do it that's the day you're
[59:15] going to die amen and we talked last
[59:17] time about how there's two things is
[59:19] death is separation from God
[59:22] and we'll get into why that is in a
[59:23] little bit and then there is to lose
[59:25] one's Breath of Life That's the other
[59:26] death and we saw that God met that
[59:28] requirement in Genesis 3 because he said
[59:30] unto Adam also unto his wife did the
[59:32] Lord God make coats of sin and clothe
[59:34] them so something died and God set a
[59:37] precedent here because something had to
[59:39] die to make them those clothes and what
[59:40] were those clothes it was a covering for
[59:43] their sin
[59:45] literally it was a literal covering for
[59:48] the literal area for which they had
[59:49] sinned amen so the the original
[59:51] sacrifice was a covering for the sin of
[59:54] the person that committed it and it was
[59:56] proof that a life had been paid amen
[59:58] because there was blood there and
[59:59] brother bam says he talks about them
[1:00:01] leaving the the Garden of Eden he says
[1:00:04] he hears The Slap
[1:00:05] as they're walking as that that skin of
[1:00:08] the Lamb is hitting off them in the
[1:00:10] blood running down their legs from the
[1:00:12] from the Fresh kill of that lamb just
[1:00:14] flowing down them and Eve saying will we
[1:00:17] ever get back will we ever get back well
[1:00:19] was it they're sitting there and they
[1:00:21] knew that something had died for them I
[1:00:23] can't imagine the weight of of guilt and
[1:00:25] shame that was on them as they walked
[1:00:27] out of the presence of God not knowing
[1:00:29] if they could ever get back and knowing
[1:00:31] that something had died
[1:00:33] knowing that something had died for them
[1:00:35] and that's the only reason they could
[1:00:37] walk out with their life spared that
[1:00:38] morning or that afternoon amen why
[1:00:42] because the only response God has for
[1:00:45] sin is Wrath
[1:00:47] it's the only thing it's the only thing
[1:00:49] remember we said in the last time that
[1:00:51] that the very penalty up front he says
[1:00:53] the day you eat the rest of the day you
[1:00:55] die that's God's Wrath that's the only
[1:00:57] thing that he can express to sin is
[1:00:59] wrath and in Romans 1 it says for the
[1:01:01] wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
[1:01:04] against all ungodliness and
[1:01:06] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:01:08] truth in righteousness
[1:01:10] so God's Wrath has to be expressed and
[1:01:12] he made a way and the way that he made
[1:01:14] it was he said something innocent and
[1:01:16] perfect can take my wrath and as long as
[1:01:18] something can absorb that wrath then
[1:01:20] I'll pass over and I'll move Beyond it
[1:01:22] and we'll continue on there and in
[1:01:24] Leviticus 17 11 it says for the life of
[1:01:27] the flesh is in the blood and I have
[1:01:29] given it to you upon the altar to make
[1:01:32] an atonement for your souls for it is
[1:01:35] the blood that makes an atonement for
[1:01:37] the soul now that word atonement means a
[1:01:39] covering
[1:01:40] we saw it in the Garden of Eden they had
[1:01:42] a covering over their bodies to hide
[1:01:44] their nakedness so atonement was a
[1:01:46] covering it was a coating and it was a
[1:01:50] pacifier and what was it it was
[1:01:52] pacifying the wrath of God it was
[1:01:55] absorbing that punishment so that God
[1:01:57] would say all right I've done what I
[1:01:58] said I was going to do now I can move on
[1:02:00] and they can move on as well and they
[1:02:02] don't have to die
[1:02:03] but the thing is this Blood this
[1:02:05] atonement was never perfect
[1:02:07] it was not completely affected because
[1:02:09] they had to do it how often every year
[1:02:11] didn't they and then in some cases they
[1:02:14] had to do it after certain sins they had
[1:02:16] to come and do it regularly so this was
[1:02:18] something they had to keep doing and
[1:02:19] doing and doing year after year for
[1:02:21] themselves for their family for their
[1:02:23] households all these different things it
[1:02:25] was there so that it could what keep
[1:02:27] absorbing the wrath of God year after
[1:02:29] year after year but it never took away
[1:02:31] the sins it only covered it and you see
[1:02:34] that in type in the in the Garden of
[1:02:35] Eden it didn't take away their sin it
[1:02:37] just covered what had caused them the
[1:02:38] problem in the first place now we
[1:02:40] remember that God told Moses in the
[1:02:42] Passover he said the blood shall be to
[1:02:44] you for a token upon the houses where
[1:02:47] you are and when I see the blood I will
[1:02:50] pass over you and the plague shall not
[1:02:52] be upon you to destroy you when I smite
[1:02:55] the land of Egypt so the blood was a
[1:02:57] token it was a proof that the price had
[1:02:59] been paid that a death had been caused
[1:03:01] and when God saw it he moved on
[1:03:04] he passed over right he overlooked what
[1:03:09] was inside the house because on the
[1:03:10] outside of the house was blood that
[1:03:12] proved that the price had been paid so
[1:03:14] he didn't go in he could not go in and
[1:03:16] see the sin that was inside the house
[1:03:18] because there was a covering on the
[1:03:19] outside that said the price has been
[1:03:21] paid you have to move on and so he made
[1:03:23] a way for them to do that amen
[1:03:26] now in Hebrews 9 22 Paul speaking of
[1:03:29] this says and almost all things are by
[1:03:32] the law purged purified so by almost all
[1:03:35] things by are by the law purified with
[1:03:38] blood he says and without shedding of
[1:03:41] blood is no remission
[1:03:43] so I want to say something here because
[1:03:45] the blood is the price that's required
[1:03:47] to pay our debt but they paid that price
[1:03:49] over and over with the land but why was
[1:03:51] it not sufficient to actually take away
[1:03:54] the sin why can't it only cover it
[1:03:56] temporarily
[1:03:57] the prophet of God answers it for us and
[1:04:00] he says because the life that was in
[1:04:02] that blood could not come back on the
[1:04:03] worshiper because your life is Tainted
[1:04:07] what is inside of us is Tainted and the
[1:04:09] idea was that the innocent life of what
[1:04:11] was killed would come back on you so
[1:04:14] that you could be restored back to
[1:04:15] innocence you could be restored back to
[1:04:18] Purity but the life of a lamb won't mix
[1:04:20] with the life of a human
[1:04:22] right so he said the worshiper would
[1:04:24] come in and he would sacrifice but the
[1:04:27] life of that lamb couldn't come on him
[1:04:28] because it's not compatible with human
[1:04:30] life and so he would go out and he would
[1:04:32] have the same thoughts he would have the
[1:04:34] same desires he could still hate he
[1:04:36] could still do wrong nothing was changed
[1:04:38] about the worshiper he came in and went
[1:04:40] out the same person
[1:04:41] he says that's why it could not be a
[1:04:44] sexual time in and time out it had to
[1:04:46] come every year because the worshiper
[1:04:48] was never changed the sacrificer was
[1:04:50] never changed
[1:04:53] so what if he isn't changed then he's
[1:04:55] got it he's going to keep sinning he's
[1:04:56] going to keep cutting he's got to keep
[1:04:58] it covered and that's why he keeps
[1:04:59] coming back year after year after year
[1:05:02] now to understand exactly why that won't
[1:05:04] work we've got to look at what it means
[1:05:06] to redeem and we covered this in a
[1:05:08] previous service but we'll go into some
[1:05:09] depth here and let Leviticus 25. and
[1:05:12] this is Moses speaking of their land
[1:05:14] amen we'll see you when it comes to
[1:05:15] Redemption you have two types of
[1:05:16] redemption you have Redemption of the
[1:05:18] land but you also have Redemption of the
[1:05:20] bloodline
[1:05:21] and that's really what we want to get
[1:05:22] into is because the land is is
[1:05:24] positioned in the land is possession but
[1:05:27] you also want life and we'll see that
[1:05:29] Redemption is all about restoring life
[1:05:31] that's its purpose is to restore life to
[1:05:33] keep the bloodline going that was the
[1:05:35] main condition or the main idea for it
[1:05:38] but we're talking about land this
[1:05:40] morning and said the land shall be not
[1:05:41] sold forever for the land is mine this
[1:05:43] is God speaking for you are strangers
[1:05:45] and sojourners with me and in all the
[1:05:48] land of your possession you shall Grant
[1:05:50] a Redemption for the land If thy brother
[1:05:52] be wax and poor and has sold away some
[1:05:54] of his possession and if any of his kin
[1:05:57] come to redeem it then he shall redeem
[1:05:59] that which his brother Soul so we've got
[1:06:01] three requirements here for the Redeemer
[1:06:03] so he had to be a Kinsman that means he
[1:06:06] had to be a relative or a bloodline
[1:06:07] member of the family amen a stranger
[1:06:09] couldn't do it and he had no right to do
[1:06:11] it if a stranger came up and went to the
[1:06:14] man that owned that land and said I want
[1:06:16] to redeem it for Jonathan he'd say are
[1:06:18] you a relative of Jonathan if he said no
[1:06:20] then he'd say sorry you can't have it he
[1:06:22] didn't have an obligation to give it
[1:06:24] back to anyone unless they were a
[1:06:26] Kinsmen Redeemer they had to be a
[1:06:28] relative and you had to prove that you
[1:06:30] were a relative you had to have the
[1:06:32] marriage certificates you had to have
[1:06:33] the genealogy there to show how you were
[1:06:35] tied to that person that you had a right
[1:06:38] to take back what they had lost
[1:06:39] otherwise they didn't have to give it
[1:06:41] back
[1:06:43] right they knew the name that was on the
[1:06:46] title deed and if you couldn't show a
[1:06:48] relationship to the name that was on the
[1:06:49] title D you couldn't get it back for
[1:06:52] them
[1:06:53] the second thing was that the Kinsmen
[1:06:55] had to be willing to redeem
[1:06:57] he couldn't be forced to do it so I
[1:07:00] couldn't go to my brother Nathan and say
[1:07:01] Nate I've fallen in hard times buy my
[1:07:04] land back for me I couldn't force him to
[1:07:07] do it he had to be willing to do it I
[1:07:09] couldn't you know say I'm going to tell
[1:07:10] Mom I'm going to tell Dad if you don't
[1:07:12] I'm going to spread it all around that
[1:07:13] you're refusing to do it you got
[1:07:14] millions of dollars in the bank and you
[1:07:16] won't pay 300 Grand to get my land back
[1:07:18] for me I couldn't force him to do it he
[1:07:21] had to be willing to do it amen and we
[1:07:23] talked about in previous verses how it
[1:07:24] had to be a special person to redeem
[1:07:26] land because we know what land costs
[1:07:28] it's not cheap and especially if it has
[1:07:30] a land on it or a house on it it's got
[1:07:33] farm and improvements and everything
[1:07:34] these days would be hundreds and
[1:07:36] hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[1:07:38] dollars and you stop and think about
[1:07:40] would I pay hundreds and hundreds of
[1:07:41] thousands of dollars to redeem my
[1:07:43] brother's land back
[1:07:44] would brother Joe go and redeem Paul's
[1:07:46] land back for him or vice versa
[1:07:48] most of us would say not not on my life
[1:07:51] not going to happen I can barely afford
[1:07:54] what I've got
[1:07:55] and now you want me to come and redeem
[1:07:56] yours amen but I want you to understand
[1:07:58] something because when Redemption
[1:08:00] happened it was because the Redeemer had
[1:08:03] stayed with the word of God and God had
[1:08:06] so blessed him in staying with the word
[1:08:08] in staying with his position that he
[1:08:11] could rely on God to continue to bless
[1:08:13] him even though he incurred greater debt
[1:08:15] or took on a bigger burden why because
[1:08:17] his Hope was in the Lord his trust was
[1:08:19] in the Lord he had stayed through thick
[1:08:21] and thin he had proved that if you
[1:08:23] stayed with the word that God would
[1:08:24] bless them with health and with good
[1:08:26] crops and animals and all these
[1:08:28] different things so he didn't worry if
[1:08:30] that brother lost it yet again because
[1:08:32] what his Redeemer was faithful and true
[1:08:34] he was staying with the promise and so
[1:08:36] he knew God was going to make it back up
[1:08:38] to him if he needed it again he had a
[1:08:40] trust that was there and that's why he
[1:08:42] wasn't worried to go in and maybe spend
[1:08:43] all of his money to redeem his brother
[1:08:45] back he knew that there was more were
[1:08:46] coming where he got it from amen
[1:08:53] and then the last thing is that the
[1:08:55] Kinsmen had to be able to redeem it
[1:08:57] so he had to be a Kinsman he had to be
[1:09:00] willing but he had to be able because it
[1:09:03] does me no good if you say brother I'd
[1:09:04] like to redeem your land for you and you
[1:09:06] say how much money do you have and you
[1:09:07] say 12.32 cents that's not going to
[1:09:10] redeem my land your willingness does not
[1:09:12] make it make you a redeemer amen you've
[1:09:14] got to be able to do it and they didn't
[1:09:15] do payment plans back then they didn't
[1:09:17] have credit cards back then you had to
[1:09:19] come in with the full sum on that one
[1:09:21] day or else they couldn't redeem it you
[1:09:23] had to have the full price for the debt
[1:09:25] that was owed otherwise no Redemption
[1:09:27] would happen that day amen
[1:09:29] so we're talking about a situation where
[1:09:31] we've lost our position with God and the
[1:09:33] price that is required therefore is a
[1:09:35] perfect innocent willing human life
[1:09:39] that's what's got to be paid because it
[1:09:40] has to be death it has to be a near
[1:09:43] Kinsmen and they have to be willing to
[1:09:44] do it and it has to have the it has to
[1:09:46] have the full price it has to be
[1:09:48] Perfection it has to be innocent amen
[1:09:50] so you think about that I can't redeem
[1:09:52] you
[1:09:53] and you can't Redeem Me
[1:09:55] because as much as I might be blood
[1:09:57] related
[1:09:58] and I might be willing yet I'm not able
[1:10:01] because I lack perfection in and of
[1:10:02] myself so I can't do it I can't redeem
[1:10:05] you I can't redeem my family I can't
[1:10:07] redeem my wife I can't redeem my kids
[1:10:08] it's impossible all I can do is point
[1:10:10] them to the same one that's doing the
[1:10:12] redeeming work for me amen there is a
[1:10:14] great Redeemer over all of us and that's
[1:10:15] the one we point to when I'm standing up
[1:10:17] here I'm not redeeming anybody I'm just
[1:10:19] pointing you to the Redeemer and it's
[1:10:21] the same thing we do as husbands and as
[1:10:22] fathers and these different things amen
[1:10:24] it has to be somebody that is perfect
[1:10:26] and so we don't do it we can't do it
[1:10:29] and we know who did it and it was God
[1:10:31] himself and he pointed to it through the
[1:10:32] through the Old Testament he says it
[1:10:34] about a hundred times I just picked a
[1:10:36] few here he said in Isaiah 47 as for Our
[1:10:39] Redeemer the Lord of hosts is his name
[1:10:41] the Holy One of Israel in Isaiah 62 he
[1:10:45] says and they shall call them the holy
[1:10:47] people the redeemed of the Lord and thou
[1:10:50] shalt be called sought out a city not
[1:10:53] forsaken that's Mount Zion and Jerusalem
[1:10:55] then we look at the prophecy for the
[1:10:57] Messiah who is the Redeemer and says For
[1:11:00] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:11:03] given and the government shall be upon
[1:11:05] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:11:06] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:11:09] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[1:11:12] peace now you're going to get very
[1:11:15] confused if you don't understand godhead
[1:11:16] with that scripture a child is born a
[1:11:18] son is given he's the Mighty God and
[1:11:20] he's the Everlasting father how do you
[1:11:22] have a child a son and an everlasting
[1:11:24] father all in the same person
[1:11:26] it doesn't fit three don't go into one
[1:11:28] the way that you think they want them to
[1:11:30] do it amen he says of the increase of
[1:11:32] his government and peace there shall be
[1:11:34] no end upon the throne of David and upon
[1:11:36] his kingdom to order it and to establish
[1:11:39] it with judgment and with Justice from
[1:11:41] henceforth even forever the Zeal of the
[1:11:43] Lord of hosts will perform this it's his
[1:11:46] Zeal it's his commitment it's his
[1:11:48] Covenant that's going to do it your Zeal
[1:11:50] is not what makes you redeemed it's his
[1:11:52] Zeal to do it remember in the Book of
[1:11:54] Ruth then then Naomi says listen he
[1:11:56] won't rest till he's done what he said
[1:11:58] he was going to do it's the Zeal of Boaz
[1:12:00] that gets the Redemption done not the
[1:12:02] Zeal of the Bride
[1:12:04] my man
[1:12:06] the prophet of God will put it this way
[1:12:07] this is 1949 this is about as early as
[1:12:10] you get in his ministry that's recorded
[1:12:12] it says and then the only way that God
[1:12:14] could ever redeem him would be to come
[1:12:16] down and redeem him himself not in
[1:12:19] another not send somebody else he
[1:12:21] couldn't send an angel that wouldn't be
[1:12:23] right why because an angel is not in
[1:12:24] line with the humanity he says but the
[1:12:27] only way God could redeem the man was
[1:12:30] come down himself to redeem it God in
[1:12:34] flesh that's the way it had to happen
[1:12:35] amen we spoke of Adam and him being a
[1:12:38] Son of God and there was potential for
[1:12:39] us to live eternally all the way from
[1:12:41] the Garden of Eden the potential was
[1:12:43] there but the potential was also there
[1:12:45] to what go the way of knowledge of a
[1:12:47] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and
[1:12:50] so we know he fell and so we needed a
[1:12:52] redeemer we needed a restart we talked
[1:12:54] about we needed another kick at the can
[1:12:55] to see if we could get back to eternal
[1:12:57] life amen and so we needed a second Adam
[1:13:01] we needed a second Adam because Adam was
[1:13:03] the Perfection we needed another
[1:13:04] Perfection to come and kick start this
[1:13:06] all over again and we go on Corinthians
[1:13:08] and Paul's talking about this and he
[1:13:10] says and so it is written the first Adam
[1:13:12] was made a living soul and the last atom
[1:13:15] was made a quickening spirit now I want
[1:13:19] you to catch something because a living
[1:13:20] soul is one man
[1:13:22] it can only affect one man there's only
[1:13:24] one Soul when you say a living Soul
[1:13:25] there's living Souls all throughout this
[1:13:27] building they're individuals so the
[1:13:30] first Adam was an individual living soul
[1:13:32] but Paul says the last Adam was made a
[1:13:35] quickening spirit now we know Spirit can
[1:13:38] be divided
[1:13:39] we know that it can be because we have
[1:13:41] the Holy Spirit so he says the last item
[1:13:43] was made of quickening spirit how be it
[1:13:45] that which was not first which is
[1:13:47] spiritual but that was his natural so he
[1:13:49] says the first living Soul was natural
[1:13:50] it was Adam
[1:13:52] he says and afterward that which is
[1:13:54] spiritual he says the second Adam is a
[1:13:55] spiritual atom the first one was natural
[1:13:57] the second one is spiritual the first
[1:14:00] man is of the earth earthy and the
[1:14:03] second man is the Lord From Heaven so
[1:14:06] you've got to quickening Spirit he says
[1:14:07] it is the Lord From Heaven so when
[1:14:09] Christ came Paul Paul looking backwards
[1:14:11] in the scripture calls him the last Adam
[1:14:13] he calls him a quickening spirit so his
[1:14:16] purpose is to do what Quicken that means
[1:14:20] to give life which means that something
[1:14:22] must be dead
[1:14:23] if it's a quickening spirit you don't
[1:14:25] need a quickening spirit to something
[1:14:26] that's been quickened to something
[1:14:27] that's alive but rather this is a
[1:14:29] quickening spirit to give life to
[1:14:31] something that's dead and what is it
[1:14:33] it's a bride that's fallen and she's in
[1:14:35] the law of sin and death right he's got
[1:14:37] to make her live one Adam Falls and we
[1:14:39] die as a result and then the second Adam
[1:14:41] comes and we live as a result amen he's
[1:14:44] undoing the work of the first Adam the
[1:14:46] first Adam put us in a death condition
[1:14:48] under the law of sin and death and then
[1:14:50] the second Adam puts us in a life
[1:14:52] condition under the law of Grace of the
[1:14:55] law of God which is Grace and a merit of
[1:14:57] favor amen Adam the first Adam brings
[1:14:59] death in a following condition the
[1:15:01] second Adam's a quickening spirit and he
[1:15:02] gives us a living condition and then he
[1:15:05] takes the dead he makes them live he
[1:15:06] takes the broken and he heals him he
[1:15:08] takes the the worthless and he makes
[1:15:10] them worthy amen these are the things
[1:15:12] that he's doing he's bringing us to a
[1:15:14] place back to where we were supposed to
[1:15:16] be in the Garden of Eden
[1:15:18] I want to see you to see something this
[1:15:20] morning we've covered this before but
[1:15:21] again just to touch on it briefly so
[1:15:23] much ties into this I struggle to preach
[1:15:25] it because you want to go off in all
[1:15:27] these different directions and I'm
[1:15:28] trying to stay tight to my notes this
[1:15:29] morning because it makes more sense if I
[1:15:32] if I keep it tight this way but Adam in
[1:15:34] his original form we remember was a
[1:15:36] spirit he was a spirit man and then
[1:15:39] after that he what he was he couldn't
[1:15:41] contact Humanity or he couldn't contact
[1:15:43] nature they couldn't contact him and so
[1:15:46] God put him into a human form so that
[1:15:48] they could see feel here touch smell him
[1:15:50] all these different things he put him
[1:15:51] into a form so he could interact with
[1:15:53] his Creation in the senses that they had
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:56] so God makes him a body and then we see
[1:15:58] Christ coming by prophecy and he's a
[1:16:00] quickening spirit the first Adam was
[1:16:02] natural when it comes to humanity and
[1:16:04] the second Adam is a spiritual body and
[1:16:06] he's from heaven
[1:16:07] so it's a spiritual body that we're
[1:16:09] working with here now we taught before
[1:16:11] that Christ took the same path as Adam
[1:16:13] he's in spirit form and then he drops
[1:16:15] down into a body amen spare first body
[1:16:18] second he has to if he's a second Adam
[1:16:20] he's got to follow the same path
[1:16:22] and so we see in Hebrews 10 he says
[1:16:24] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:16:26] he saith sacrifice an offering thou what
[1:16:29] is not but a body hast thou prepared me
[1:16:32] it's the same thing he did for Adam Adam
[1:16:33] had a body prepared for his Spirit to
[1:16:36] step into in the Amplified it says hence
[1:16:38] when Christ entered into the world he
[1:16:40] said sacrifices and offerings you have
[1:16:42] not desired speaking to God he says but
[1:16:45] instead you have made a body ready a
[1:16:47] body for me to offer
[1:16:50] right so he's made a body for him to
[1:16:52] step into to be offered as a sacrifice
[1:16:55] amen and so Paul said is speaking Jesus
[1:16:58] words there and he's saying God you
[1:16:59] didn't want the sacrifices of bulls and
[1:17:01] uh and lambs and goats and all these
[1:17:03] things but you made a body to step for
[1:17:06] me to step into and that is the body you
[1:17:08] want me to offer back to you to pay the
[1:17:10] price that will be the ultimate
[1:17:12] settlement for the sin of the people
[1:17:13] amen so it's no different than Adam's
[1:17:16] creation story a spirit put into a body
[1:17:18] but if we look then at the birth of
[1:17:21] Jesus we something that's quite that's
[1:17:22] quite different and this is where we
[1:17:24] want to spend some time this morning so
[1:17:26] in Luke 1 it says the angel came into
[1:17:27] her Mary and said hail now that our
[1:17:31] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[1:17:33] blessed art thou among women and when
[1:17:35] she saw him she was troubled at his sane
[1:17:37] and cast in her mind what matter of
[1:17:39] salutation this should be and the angel
[1:17:41] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[1:17:44] found favor with god listen under the
[1:17:47] law of sin and death when God talked to
[1:17:48] you it was rarely a good thing
[1:17:50] but the first thing he says here is as
[1:17:52] soon as she's troubled he says no no no
[1:17:54] don't worry fear not this is good news
[1:17:56] this is a good message
[1:17:59] he says and behold thou shall conceive
[1:18:01] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[1:18:03] shall call his name Jesus and he shall
[1:18:06] be great and shall be called the son of
[1:18:07] the highest and the Lord God shall give
[1:18:09] unto him the Throne of his father David
[1:18:10] so this is a fulfillment of Isaiah 9
[1:18:13] where we're ready to be the the the the
[1:18:15] counselor the Mighty God Prince of Peace
[1:18:17] Everlasting father this is the person
[1:18:19] that's going to do it
[1:18:21] he says and he shall reign over the
[1:18:23] house of Jacob forever and of his
[1:18:25] kingdom there shall be no end
[1:18:27] the Mary said unto the angel practical
[1:18:31] how shall this be seen I know not a man
[1:18:33] she says I've never been intimate with
[1:18:35] the man so how is this one going to
[1:18:36] happen
[1:18:38] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:18:40] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:18:42] the power of the highest shall
[1:18:43] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[1:18:46] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:18:49] be called The Son of God Amen so
[1:18:51] remember he says a body has thou
[1:18:53] prepared me
[1:18:55] and what you have to realize what's
[1:18:57] happening here because Jesus is being
[1:18:59] born the way we were meant to be born
[1:19:02] you've got to catch this amen look at
[1:19:04] how the body is created the Holy Ghost
[1:19:06] shall come upon the woman overshadow her
[1:19:09] and it produces a holy thing
[1:19:13] the prophet of God said it this way he
[1:19:14] says there's only one person could be
[1:19:16] the word and that was Jesus he was God's
[1:19:19] Spoken Word by a virgin birth
[1:19:21] I'm a perversion see I'm the result of a
[1:19:24] union between my father and mother this
[1:19:26] has to die that's me see the body that
[1:19:29] has to die it wasn't so with Jesus he
[1:19:31] was the word he was born virgin amen he
[1:19:34] said brother there's no woman man or
[1:19:35] nothing else had nothing to do with him
[1:19:37] the woman was the incubator that's right
[1:19:40] and he nursed her breasts and so forth
[1:19:42] that might have been true about that but
[1:19:44] let me tell you he was God that's who he
[1:19:47] was wasn't no sex about it at all he had
[1:19:50] to be free from sex to bring forth life
[1:19:53] through that blood notice he says to
[1:19:55] bring forth life through that blood
[1:19:58] because the life of that blood is going
[1:19:59] to have to come on the people after he
[1:20:01] sacrifices so it cannot be tainted by
[1:20:04] Humanity's Fallen condition
[1:20:06] but to bring forth life through that
[1:20:08] blood as we'll get to in a few minutes
[1:20:10] and then we look he was the word
[1:20:13] so the prophet of God has said and I've
[1:20:14] I've mentioned this over the pope but
[1:20:16] not read the quote and I'll read it in a
[1:20:18] moment where the prophet of God said in
[1:20:20] Eden children would have been born by
[1:20:22] the spoken word and guess what that'll
[1:20:24] choke a denominational believer
[1:20:26] because they'll say where do you get
[1:20:28] that from you get it right here in Luke
[1:20:31] you see how birth was supposed to happen
[1:20:33] amen this is a sinful way that we have
[1:20:36] it happen today but there was a
[1:20:38] different way but the prophet of God
[1:20:39] says it just so you have the quote he's
[1:20:40] speaking of Eve he says now you see the
[1:20:43] seed that she was holding so Eve had an
[1:20:46] egg inside of her
[1:20:48] he says and it was ready to be made
[1:20:50] alive but it needed seed from a man
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:53] so the seed that she was holding and
[1:20:56] would have finally become a mother by
[1:20:59] the will of God through a spoken word
[1:21:03] she would have finally become a mother
[1:21:05] but she couldn't wait because what she
[1:21:09] was trying to fulfill the Commandment be
[1:21:11] fruitful and multiply so she has the
[1:21:14] means within her but she doesn't know
[1:21:16] how to make it happen and she listened
[1:21:19] to the serpent who said I've got a way
[1:21:21] for this to happen rather than what
[1:21:23] waiting on God
[1:21:28] I want you to catch something here and
[1:21:29] we're going to touch on three different
[1:21:30] things two today and one in a later
[1:21:32] service because brother Branham would
[1:21:34] talk about the seven seal book that
[1:21:35] titled deed to Redemption that we hope
[1:21:37] that in the the scripture we read there
[1:21:39] in Revelations 5. and he said the book
[1:21:41] that is written within is then completed
[1:21:44] when this Angel ceases he says now
[1:21:47] please understand this when the seventh
[1:21:49] Angel's message is completed the godhead
[1:21:51] mystery the serpent seed mystery and all
[1:21:55] the other mysteries of these things
[1:21:58] speaking again of that book he would say
[1:22:00] it is a book a mysterious book it's the
[1:22:02] book of redemption a mysterious book you
[1:22:05] say it's simple Christ came he redeems
[1:22:07] us back what's so what's so difficult
[1:22:08] about this no he says this book is a
[1:22:11] mysterious book this is a mysterious
[1:22:13] book I was reading there just this
[1:22:15] morning where brother Brown says he was
[1:22:18] talking about the Holy Spirit he says
[1:22:19] and God just gave them a little bit in
[1:22:21] Luther's day and then a little bit more
[1:22:23] on Wesley's day and then he says he
[1:22:24] comes in here and he gives us more
[1:22:26] because there's more to be fulfilled
[1:22:27] there's more to be revealed in there and
[1:22:29] so he gives the spirit in accordance
[1:22:31] with what's to be revealed and there's a
[1:22:33] Redemption that's happening here that
[1:22:34] hasn't happened in any of these so he's
[1:22:36] got to give more here because it's a
[1:22:38] Redemption that takes us all the way off
[1:22:39] the planet we've talked about this
[1:22:40] before
[1:22:41] amen so there's a mystery there because
[1:22:43] it's never happened before
[1:22:46] he says we'll get into that in a little
[1:22:47] while and we know that this book of
[1:22:49] redemption will not be thoroughly
[1:22:51] understood it's probed at through these
[1:22:54] six Church ages but at the end when the
[1:22:56] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:22:58] mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends
[1:23:00] that these fellows probe that he says
[1:23:02] all through here they probed at this
[1:23:04] listen Paul had it
[1:23:06] because this man only preached what Paul
[1:23:08] preached
[1:23:09] right he only preached the same message
[1:23:11] and as somebody pointed I think it was
[1:23:13] Ellie said to the other day in his
[1:23:14] prayer he said that he got the same
[1:23:16] results that this guy did right
[1:23:18] so there's nothing here that wasn't
[1:23:22] known in and of itself in terms of
[1:23:24] understanding but there's a revelation
[1:23:26] by experience that we're going to have
[1:23:28] that nobody else had before we'll get
[1:23:30] into this I'm getting ahead of myself he
[1:23:31] says he winds up all the loose things
[1:23:33] that these fellows probe that because
[1:23:34] they were in truth here at the beginning
[1:23:37] truth went down
[1:23:39] and then it built up
[1:23:41] here has been trying to figure out how
[1:23:42] this is going to work what's in that
[1:23:44] seven seal book what are those Mysteries
[1:23:46] of the Seven Seals
[1:23:48] and he says at the end he's going to
[1:23:49] wind up all the Loose Ends that means
[1:23:52] they were tied together at one point
[1:23:53] they came apart as men went into
[1:23:55] denominations and tried to make things
[1:23:57] happen their own way and then now he
[1:23:59] ties them back up together again so that
[1:24:00] they form the right picture so we can
[1:24:02] understand what this Redemption plan is
[1:24:04] all about
[1:24:05] that he says and the Mysteries comes
[1:24:07] down from God as the word of God and
[1:24:10] reveals the entire revelation of God
[1:24:13] then the godhead and everything else is
[1:24:16] settled all the Mysteries serpent seed
[1:24:18] and whatever more is to be revealed he
[1:24:20] says it again he says now you see I'm
[1:24:22] not just making that up it's thus saith
[1:24:24] the Lord I'll read it to you out of the
[1:24:26] book The Scriptures he says that the
[1:24:28] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[1:24:29] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:24:31] that's been declared by his holy
[1:24:33] prophets that's the prophets who wrote
[1:24:35] the word at the sounding of the seventh
[1:24:37] Church age the last Church age all the
[1:24:40] Loose Ends that through these Church
[1:24:41] ages has been probed at will be wound up
[1:24:44] together
[1:24:46] he says again the Seven Seals holds the
[1:24:49] mystery of the book and until we can see
[1:24:52] what those Seven Seals has sealed in
[1:24:54] we're only presuming them things so
[1:24:57] there's something very critical behind
[1:24:59] those Seven Seals
[1:25:00] now brother Branham he's pointing
[1:25:02] forward to the opening of the seals and
[1:25:05] he would say that they've been lost
[1:25:06] since the time of the Apostles and in
[1:25:08] one place we just read he says through
[1:25:10] these Church ages another place he says
[1:25:13] these denominational years
[1:25:15] he says it's been lost and it's been
[1:25:17] Unwound and it's been messed up and he
[1:25:19] would specifically mention serpent seed
[1:25:21] and godhead and he's preached on both
[1:25:23] those things to this point but now that
[1:25:26] as God is opening it up to him he
[1:25:28] realizes how much further they're tied
[1:25:30] into the Plan of Redemption then perhaps
[1:25:32] he understood before because these are
[1:25:34] part and parcel he says to what it takes
[1:25:36] to understand what's under those Seven
[1:25:38] Seals what is it because when you read
[1:25:41] the book of Revelation when you read
[1:25:43] this entire book is a book of redemption
[1:25:45] you've got to read it in the context of
[1:25:48] redemption and so you've got to
[1:25:50] understand godhead in the context of
[1:25:52] redemption you've got to understand the
[1:25:54] sir the serpency in the context of
[1:25:57] redemption because that's what's sealed
[1:25:58] up is the Plan of Redemption so he says
[1:26:01] you've got to you know we'll talk about
[1:26:03] it but you're gonna have to read this
[1:26:04] book with understanding
[1:26:06] right because everybody probed at it but
[1:26:09] they didn't have understanding
[1:26:10] they didn't have understanding so you've
[1:26:12] got to have understanding to read what's
[1:26:14] on it remember brother Brown talked
[1:26:15] about the Capstone and he pried it off
[1:26:17] and he said look on these things
[1:26:19] and guess what they looked on it for a
[1:26:21] while and then one went here and one
[1:26:22] went there and they went off and did
[1:26:23] their own things why because they didn't
[1:26:25] understand
[1:26:26] they didn't understand it and so they
[1:26:28] say what's the point of looking at if I
[1:26:29] don't understand I'm just going to go
[1:26:31] back to my Ministry but he said stay
[1:26:33] here stay here because what there's a
[1:26:35] revelation coming that'll make plain
[1:26:37] what is written here if you'll just stay
[1:26:39] there
[1:26:40] right so we've got to read it in the
[1:26:42] context of redemption by the
[1:26:43] understanding of the Holy Spirit now to
[1:26:45] give you just an example of this in
[1:26:47] Daniel 9 it's Daniel says yea while I
[1:26:50] was speaking in prayer even the man
[1:26:51] Gabriel who had seen in the vision at
[1:26:53] the beginning being caused to fly
[1:26:54] swiftly touched me about the time of the
[1:26:57] evening oblation and he informed me and
[1:27:00] talked with me and said oh Daniel I am
[1:27:02] now come forth to give thee skill and
[1:27:04] understanding
[1:27:06] Daniel's wondering what's going on
[1:27:08] what's going on what does this mean and
[1:27:10] so an angel comes to the prophet and
[1:27:13] gives him an understanding of what's
[1:27:15] hidden why so that Daniel could sit
[1:27:17] there in his closet and just say well
[1:27:19] now I know what's there no so Daniel
[1:27:22] could take it and write it down to give
[1:27:23] a timeline to the children of Israel as
[1:27:26] to what was going to happen in their
[1:27:27] future because what they were going to
[1:27:29] stay in Babylon for a while weren't they
[1:27:31] he gave them a timeline then he had a
[1:27:33] timeline to what the Messiah then he had
[1:27:36] a timeline after that to what the
[1:27:38] tribulation it's all revealed to Daniel
[1:27:40] what so that the people will understand
[1:27:42] what's going to happen
[1:27:44] it wasn't just for Daniel it was for all
[1:27:46] of us
[1:27:47] he says at the beginning of thy
[1:27:49] supplications the Commandment came forth
[1:27:51] and I've come to show thee for thou art
[1:27:54] greatly beloved amen it's the Beloved
[1:27:56] that get to understand therefore
[1:27:58] understand the matter and consider the
[1:28:01] vision and then he goes in to explain
[1:28:02] what's going on then we come to our time
[1:28:05] and John says this he says and we know
[1:28:07] that we are of God
[1:28:09] you've got to know you're of God and the
[1:28:11] whole world lieth in wickedness
[1:28:14] and we know that the Son of God is come
[1:28:16] and hath given us an understanding that
[1:28:20] we may know him that is true and we are
[1:28:23] in him that is true not just to know him
[1:28:26] but to be in him that is true even in
[1:28:29] his son Jesus Christ this is the true
[1:28:32] God and eternal life
[1:28:34] not just to know him but to be in him he
[1:28:37] says that is the true God and eternal
[1:28:39] life so you've got to understand godhead
[1:28:41] there don't you you've got to understand
[1:28:42] how he fits into it and how you fit into
[1:28:45] it as well
[1:28:46] so let's bring us back to this message
[1:28:48] this morning we spoke of Jesus being
[1:28:50] born by a Virgin by the Holy Spirit by
[1:28:52] the spoken word of God right God said
[1:28:54] the angel Gabriel
[1:28:55] and he said this is going to happen and
[1:28:57] then it happened no Humanity involved no
[1:29:00] no Decisions by man no decision by women
[1:29:03] Mary couldn't have stopped it from
[1:29:04] happening if she tried
[1:29:07] she couldn't have stopped it
[1:29:08] the word went forth the spoken word went
[1:29:11] forth and as soon as it did she was
[1:29:12] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and a
[1:29:14] baby was formed in her belly
[1:29:16] there was no stopping it it was going to
[1:29:18] happen now brother Brahm said we would
[1:29:20] have been born by the same way but what
[1:29:21] happened the serpent beguiled Eve he
[1:29:24] gave her a different way to produce what
[1:29:26] God wanted her to produce amen and so
[1:29:28] Humanity fell into what a new way of
[1:29:31] producing children
[1:29:32] so if you don't understand serpent seed
[1:29:34] you won't understand why we are sinful
[1:29:36] in the first place amen if you don't
[1:29:38] understand why your natural birth is
[1:29:40] wrong you won't understand your need for
[1:29:42] a redeemer because you'll say I live a
[1:29:44] good life or maybe I lived a perfect
[1:29:45] life that ought to be good enough right
[1:29:47] and not realize that your very existence
[1:29:50] is proof of sin
[1:29:52] the fact that you are alive today and it
[1:29:54] wasn't by the spoken word of God reveals
[1:29:56] a very sinful nature because that is the
[1:29:58] original act that caused him to sin in
[1:30:00] the first place your existence is proof
[1:30:02] that your parents sinned
[1:30:04] in the in the essence of they did what
[1:30:06] they were not supposed to do in the
[1:30:07] Garden of Eden amen so what was the tree
[1:30:09] of knowledge of Good and Evil the tree
[1:30:11] of knowledge of Good and Evil was what
[1:30:13] the means to produce life outside of the
[1:30:15] way that God had said it was to be done
[1:30:20] what it was it it was to be fruitful and
[1:30:21] multiply of your own accord rather than
[1:30:24] waiting on the word of God waiting on
[1:30:25] the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit God
[1:30:27] said don't do it that way and guess what
[1:30:29] they did it that way and the scripture
[1:30:31] never says that we lost access to the
[1:30:33] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you
[1:30:35] ever noticed that we have no problem
[1:30:37] accessing the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:30:39] and Evil
[1:30:40] but it did say we lost access to the
[1:30:42] Tree of Life
[1:30:43] so that means the tree of knowledge of
[1:30:45] Good and Evil is with us today show me
[1:30:47] where it is
[1:30:48] don't literally show me where it is but
[1:30:51] guess what if you go to the world and
[1:30:53] say where's the trillion knowledge good
[1:30:54] and evil because that's supposed to
[1:30:55] still be available
[1:30:57] they can't tell you
[1:30:59] why because they don't understand
[1:31:00] serpent seed right they don't understand
[1:31:03] why we truly need a redeemer they go
[1:31:04] back to I did wrong rather than I am
[1:31:06] wrong they don't understand why it
[1:31:08] requires blood
[1:31:10] they don't understand that because your
[1:31:12] blood is Tainted and there was a
[1:31:13] Breaking of a blood
[1:31:14] in that original act amen
[1:31:17] so the question is how would God have
[1:31:19] done it
[1:31:20] we know the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:31:21] and Evil did it but how would God have
[1:31:23] produced life well we have the answer
[1:31:25] there in in Luke amen but listen let me
[1:31:29] put it this way if you wanted Apple life
[1:31:31] where would you go
[1:31:34] apple tree
[1:31:36] if you want to pair life you'll go to
[1:31:38] pear tree
[1:31:39] if you want life where do you go the
[1:31:41] Tree of Life they would have gotten it
[1:31:43] from the Tree of Life and what is the
[1:31:45] Tree of Life
[1:31:47] it's not an apple tree remember brother
[1:31:49] Brown says they ate apples and they made
[1:31:51] their eyes come open realized they were
[1:31:52] naked and passed the apples right it
[1:31:54] couldn't have been that tree it couldn't
[1:31:55] have been a natural tree the way that we
[1:31:57] think of trees prophet of God says this
[1:31:59] the Holy Spirit guarded the tree of life
[1:32:01] until the atonement was made and now the
[1:32:03] holy spirit is running the people to the
[1:32:05] Tree of Life Adam and Eve was trying to
[1:32:07] get to the Tree of Life
[1:32:09] trying to get to it now their children
[1:32:11] are trying to stay away from the Tree of
[1:32:12] Life the Holy Spirit was guarding it and
[1:32:14] now it's bringing them to it and they
[1:32:16] refuse to hear the spirit's voice
[1:32:18] because the same adversary that caused
[1:32:20] them to sin in the beginning is keeping
[1:32:22] them away from the Tree of Life guess
[1:32:24] what the world is consumed with the tree
[1:32:25] of knowledge of Good and Evil speaking
[1:32:27] literally you notice how centralized the
[1:32:29] world is everything is centralized
[1:32:31] around centralized around that tree of
[1:32:33] life that tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:32:35] Evil everything is about sensuality
[1:32:37] these days
[1:32:38] more and more and more why because that
[1:32:40] distracts them from the Tree of Life
[1:32:42] but then he would say keeping them away
[1:32:45] from the Tree of Life and Jesus Christ
[1:32:47] he says is the tree of life so here's
[1:32:49] where God godhead comes in because if
[1:32:51] you believe in three Gods then you're
[1:32:53] going to have some real problems with
[1:32:54] this because he says we've got the Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit overshadowing
[1:32:58] but yet the Holy Spirit overshadows but
[1:33:00] the one that's born as a son the one
[1:33:02] that's born as a child the one that's
[1:33:04] born is the Mighty God and the one
[1:33:06] that's born as the Everlasting father so
[1:33:07] you've got God producing God you've got
[1:33:09] a father producing a son how is that
[1:33:11] going to work it doesn't work you've got
[1:33:12] to understand godhead and I'm not
[1:33:13] getting into godhead this morning amen
[1:33:15] but then you see where he says he's also
[1:33:17] a quickening spirit so we've got a
[1:33:19] father
[1:33:20] right from Isaiah 9 it says he's the
[1:33:22] mighty mighty God the Everlasting father
[1:33:24] then we go in to Luke and he says he's a
[1:33:28] son that's given right well he said in
[1:33:31] Isaiah 2. and then we come and Paul
[1:33:32] calls him a quickening spirit so we have
[1:33:34] Father Son and Holy Spirit in one person
[1:33:36] amen that's being born that never
[1:33:37] existed before how you fit that into
[1:33:39] three persons
[1:33:41] it doesn't work
[1:33:42] doesn't work right you've got to
[1:33:44] understand it in the idea of the
[1:33:45] manifestations of the spirits of God or
[1:33:47] the attributes of God rather than one
[1:33:49] two three or just one even like this
[1:33:51] amen it's the ability of God to take on
[1:33:53] a different form to achieve what he's
[1:33:55] planning to achieve amen amen
[1:33:58] so what if we look at what was supposed
[1:34:00] to happen then in the perfect will of
[1:34:02] God and Eden you'd have been born by the
[1:34:04] word of God and it would have been by
[1:34:06] the Tree of Life who is what Christ who
[1:34:08] is what a quickening spirit
[1:34:10] right so just as Mary had had a child by
[1:34:13] what the overshadowing of the Holy
[1:34:15] Spirit Well what had been happened is
[1:34:17] you would have been born by the way of
[1:34:18] life which would have been the
[1:34:19] overshadowing of the Holy Spirit on the
[1:34:21] woman to Quicken what was inside her and
[1:34:23] a baby would have come forth
[1:34:25] that's simple amen very simple amen you
[1:34:28] wouldn't have had any desire or
[1:34:30] sensuality because why the life that was
[1:34:32] in Adam and his wife would have been in
[1:34:35] you because why the life comes through
[1:34:37] the blood of the father
[1:34:39] so you'd have the same life that Adam
[1:34:41] had you'd have had the same life that
[1:34:42] the woman had and you would have just
[1:34:44] continued on in eternal life because why
[1:34:45] you came from eternal life you came from
[1:34:48] a quickening spirit you came from Mighty
[1:34:50] God you came from Everlasting father
[1:34:52] so that's why you would have lived
[1:34:53] forever and ever was because you would
[1:34:54] have had the same father you would have
[1:34:56] had the life of his blood inside of you
[1:34:58] if we want to put it that way amen and
[1:35:00] if you want to see a difference look at
[1:35:01] Cain because Cain had a different father
[1:35:03] look how different he was than able why
[1:35:05] because the life of the father that he
[1:35:07] had was different than the life of the
[1:35:09] father that Abel had
[1:35:11] Even Adam as a fallen man had a
[1:35:13] different spirit and nature that
[1:35:15] followed his bloodline than Cain who had
[1:35:16] the blood of the serpent in him right
[1:35:19] the prophet God puts it this way he says
[1:35:22] now look I want you to notice something
[1:35:24] and when this the only way that God
[1:35:26] himself could ever redeem this man was
[1:35:28] to come down and take his place and that
[1:35:30] was a law that was given by Moses of
[1:35:32] redemption that it had to be done
[1:35:34] through a Kinsmen Redeemer a man first
[1:35:36] who was worthy a man who was worth the
[1:35:38] price a man who would make his public
[1:35:40] testimony and redeem the Lost estate of
[1:35:42] somebody that had fallen and then God
[1:35:45] was worthy and then God was worthy he
[1:35:48] came down some 1900 years ago in the
[1:35:50] form of a baby born in a manger
[1:35:52] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost not born
[1:35:55] by sexual desire he was God God's blood
[1:35:58] was in him that's key scripture says
[1:36:01] we're saved by the blood of God
[1:36:03] the blood is always the blood of its
[1:36:05] father never its mother we know that
[1:36:07] I've taught that before here in times
[1:36:09] and you know that the baby has not one
[1:36:10] Speck of its mother's blood in it not a
[1:36:12] bit no nothing does it's always the
[1:36:15] blood of the male a hen can lay an egg
[1:36:17] but if it isn't fertilized it'll never
[1:36:19] hatch no matter how pretty the egg is
[1:36:21] how well she warms it it will always be
[1:36:24] infertile it'll lay right there and rot
[1:36:27] right there and rot that's right unless
[1:36:29] the male bird has been with a female
[1:36:31] bird and the germ of life he says comes
[1:36:33] from the male
[1:36:35] therefore when Mary knowing not a man
[1:36:38] she was with the male God the almighty
[1:36:41] Jehovah and he overshadowed her and God
[1:36:44] is the creator that created a blood cell
[1:36:46] in the womb of Mary knowing no man at
[1:36:48] all that's why brother Branham said you
[1:36:50] can receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:52] Ghost without
[1:36:55] sensation
[1:36:57] Mary didn't feel a thing
[1:36:59] but she had life within her one moment
[1:37:01] she didn't one moment she did Why
[1:37:03] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit a
[1:37:06] quickening spirit you can have life
[1:37:08] inside of you and not realize exactly
[1:37:10] what's happening amen now you'll notice
[1:37:12] eventually because Mary started showing
[1:37:13] signs of Life didn't she but that moment
[1:37:16] she didn't have a clue whether anything
[1:37:17] had actually happened
[1:37:19] it took a while for it to show he says
[1:37:21] and that brought forth the very creative
[1:37:23] blood of God to redeem us from our life
[1:37:26] coming in here being born of sexual
[1:37:28] desire and then that blood was drawn out
[1:37:31] of Emmanuel's veins on calvary's cross
[1:37:33] and today has the same saving redeeming
[1:37:37] holy power that it did the day the
[1:37:40] transfusion was made out at Calvary you
[1:37:43] believe it he says amen now that's right
[1:37:45] we're Redeemed by the blood of God and
[1:37:47] the Bible says we are bought by the
[1:37:49] blood and Redeemed by Blood God's own
[1:37:53] blood so Christ was born by what the
[1:37:55] overshadowing of the Holy Spirit and
[1:37:57] what was it it was a sign of the new
[1:37:59] birth required by us
[1:38:02] he was being born the way that we needed
[1:38:04] to be born
[1:38:05] because we need to be born by what the
[1:38:07] spirit
[1:38:08] the quickening Spirit by the word of God
[1:38:11] and Paul talks about this being born
[1:38:13] again what not a flesh but by the What
[1:38:15] Spirit by the word he was showing us
[1:38:18] that we had to have a new birth in the
[1:38:20] form that he was birthed in
[1:38:23] you couldn't stay in your Fallen flesh
[1:38:24] that way amen as I said before our own
[1:38:27] first birth condemns us it's the literal
[1:38:29] act that the serpent and Eve committed
[1:38:32] in Genesis 3 and then Adam and Eve did
[1:38:33] right afterwards our literal existence
[1:38:35] is proof that that there has been sin
[1:38:38] amen so we can't get away from that amen
[1:38:40] we have to be born again by the word of
[1:38:42] God by the holy spirit so the thing is
[1:38:44] if you have to be it's not enough to say
[1:38:46] the Holy Spirit overshadowed you have to
[1:38:48] be a part of the word of God
[1:38:50] that's what is in the book of redemption
[1:38:52] is what who is in the word of God the
[1:38:56] names that are there that can't be
[1:38:57] removed amen you got a book of life but
[1:38:59] then you have the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:00] which is the sealed book of redemption
[1:39:02] and that's the ones who were sealed and
[1:39:04] redeemed before the foundation of the
[1:39:06] world whose names are written and so
[1:39:08] their names are a part of the word their
[1:39:10] identities and their attributes are part
[1:39:12] of the word and so that is the thing
[1:39:14] that what sends forth a quickening
[1:39:16] spirit to bring forth the word that was
[1:39:19] spoken before you ever came into
[1:39:20] existence before you ever knew anything
[1:39:23] before there was ever time it was back
[1:39:25] in eternity before there was ever a
[1:39:27] speck of anything your name was written
[1:39:29] in that Lamb's Book of Life and so that
[1:39:31] word comes forth as the seals are ripped
[1:39:33] off and your name is called forth the
[1:39:35] quickening spirit is going out to do
[1:39:38] what bring to life that which is said in
[1:39:40] there and to bring you back to the what
[1:39:41] the title deed of your Redemption that
[1:39:43] shows you what you have access to
[1:39:45] because of who he made you from the
[1:39:47] beginning amen that's what's happening
[1:39:49] under those Seven Seals it's not a new
[1:39:51] doctrine
[1:39:52] listen prophet of God said this clearly
[1:39:55] he says he can't you can't add one word
[1:39:57] or take one from his word and he can't
[1:39:59] do it either so he can't give us a new
[1:40:02] doctrine to take us out
[1:40:04] that would be unfair
[1:40:06] once the word is given that's it it's
[1:40:08] sealed and he doesn't do one bit more
[1:40:10] and he doesn't take away one bit from it
[1:40:11] it's already there so under the Seven
[1:40:13] Seals is not Doctrine but what is it
[1:40:15] it's a revelation by experience of the
[1:40:17] Redemption plan of God
[1:40:19] including what going into that little
[1:40:21] room where it's just you and him right
[1:40:23] it's an experience Revelation not just a
[1:40:27] doctrinal revelation you need to
[1:40:28] understand what's going on we teach
[1:40:30] because it's it's it's good for us amen
[1:40:32] but teaching is not what's going to get
[1:40:33] you in there it's going to be the
[1:40:34] experience of what that teaching is
[1:40:36] talking about that's going to take you
[1:40:37] off of this planet amen
[1:40:39] what is it when you get in what when
[1:40:42] you're born by that Holy Spirit what
[1:40:43] does it do it puts you in that bloodline
[1:40:47] now you're kin to him
[1:40:50] and until you are he can't do anything
[1:40:53] with you you got to be born again so the
[1:40:55] thing is you got to die out of this one
[1:40:57] and you got to be born into another one
[1:40:58] by the word by the quickening power of
[1:41:01] the Holy Spirit and that's what gives
[1:41:02] him access to say there we go that's the
[1:41:05] one I can redeem right there
[1:41:07] you always were that's the beauty of it
[1:41:08] you always work you always were a part
[1:41:11] of it it's not that you hit you go out
[1:41:12] and in and out and in these things but
[1:41:14] when you realize that that lets you know
[1:41:16] that hey when that Redemption call goes
[1:41:17] up when he walks into the pawn shop you
[1:41:19] say hey that's me
[1:41:21] that's me yeah you're talking about meal
[1:41:23] yes I want to go with you and you submit
[1:41:26] yourself now into that Redemption
[1:41:27] purpose and plan so he can do something
[1:41:29] in your life
[1:41:30] probably God would say this again he
[1:41:32] says and so there he spoke to me and
[1:41:34] said the Seven Seals will be opened the
[1:41:37] seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the
[1:41:39] Bible that's been closed up since the
[1:41:40] foundation of the world will be revealed
[1:41:43] and we yet a humble little group
[1:41:46] compared with all the world we've
[1:41:49] enjoyed these blessing hearing those
[1:41:51] Mysteries then he says marriage divorce
[1:41:54] serpent seat all these different
[1:41:57] questions has been completely revealed
[1:41:59] to us not by man but by God himself
[1:42:02] that's open those seven Mysteries now I
[1:42:04] want you to pay attention to this
[1:42:06] because he summarizes what those seven
[1:42:08] Mysteries are he says of what the church
[1:42:10] was
[1:42:13] not here
[1:42:14] not here
[1:42:16] way back
[1:42:17] before the world began
[1:42:19] of what the church was how it was in
[1:42:22] Christ where
[1:42:23] Ephesian Church age no no no no he says
[1:42:26] in the beginning and how it will be
[1:42:29] revealed in the last day what the church
[1:42:33] the church that's the mystery that's
[1:42:36] under there is what Christ and abroad
[1:42:38] United and the revealing It's the final
[1:42:39] mystery of God being revealed is him in
[1:42:42] us and what's that going to look like
[1:42:43] amen because you say what in the world
[1:42:45] does that have to do with us what does
[1:42:47] marriage and divorce have to do with the
[1:42:48] calling out of a bride we'll get into it
[1:42:50] later what does God have to do why does
[1:42:52] it matter because you got to realize
[1:42:53] that you are part of it before it ever
[1:42:55] began as as time as we know it in these
[1:42:57] different things amen and the other
[1:42:59] thing is this is because if you don't
[1:43:00] understand those you don't understand
[1:43:02] how we got out of our place and if you
[1:43:04] don't understand how we got out then you
[1:43:06] don't know how we get back in
[1:43:08] right because if you don't understand
[1:43:10] why you're in a fallen condition you
[1:43:12] don't understand why you need a new
[1:43:13] birth
[1:43:14] if you don't understand that your birth
[1:43:15] has to be by a quickening power rather
[1:43:18] than by your dad's power
[1:43:20] then you won't understand why you need
[1:43:21] to have a new birth if you don't
[1:43:23] understand why you need a redeemer if
[1:43:25] you don't understand what you used to
[1:43:26] have then you don't understand why you
[1:43:28] need a redeeming person
[1:43:29] because you don't realize you had
[1:43:30] anything else all of these things are
[1:43:32] tied in marriage and divorce is going to
[1:43:34] be a huge one we'll spend a whole
[1:43:35] service on it not on marriage and
[1:43:36] divorce itself but how it relates to
[1:43:38] Redemption because it's all about life
[1:43:40] it's all about bringing us back to these
[1:43:41] things amen we need Rapture and faith we
[1:43:44] need wrap stream Faith this is where
[1:43:46] it's all leading to his rapturing faith
[1:43:47] but how do you get Faith it's by hearing
[1:43:49] amen and how does that hearing come that
[1:43:52] word hearing means what understanding
[1:43:53] and understanding comes by the word of
[1:43:55] God
[1:43:56] by the word of God every single time
[1:43:58] we're talking about what seeing things
[1:44:00] as God meant us to see them and
[1:44:02] accepting it and believing it so that he
[1:44:04] can do what what the word said
[1:44:07] it's all he's waiting for is for us to
[1:44:08] accept it and believe it and then he'll
[1:44:10] do it
[1:44:12] he'd say this Faith cometh by what
[1:44:14] hearing now not just listen with your
[1:44:16] ear but if you hear that means you
[1:44:18] understand it and you accept it he says
[1:44:21] I hear you I believe it see it's hearing
[1:44:23] but Stephen said you stiff-necked
[1:44:25] uncircumcised in the heart and ears see
[1:44:27] uncircumcised they could hear it with
[1:44:29] the ears but uncircumcised they couldn't
[1:44:32] believe it see
[1:44:33] and then Paul would talk about he says
[1:44:35] the holy spirit in your life does what a
[1:44:37] circumcision of the heart what does that
[1:44:40] do it takes away the things that block
[1:44:41] your hearing that block your eyes that
[1:44:43] block your ears and allows you to hear
[1:44:45] what the spirit of God is saying to the
[1:44:47] churches and accept it and believe it
[1:44:49] and step into it I heard brother Brown
[1:44:51] say something this morning he said the
[1:44:52] gospel is to manifest the word of God
[1:44:55] that's what he's bringing us into the
[1:44:57] full manifestation of the word of God
[1:44:58] for our day amen this is what we're
[1:45:00] talking about in this series it's so
[1:45:01] much deeper it's so much deeper and like
[1:45:04] I said it's been three years of dwelling
[1:45:05] on some of these things it's so much
[1:45:07] deeper than we ever imagined because one
[1:45:08] thing ties into another ties into
[1:45:10] another ties into another and you can't
[1:45:11] get away everything's tied up remember
[1:45:13] he talks about the prophet of God tying
[1:45:15] those loose ends together and what you
[1:45:17] see is that everything touches
[1:45:18] everything it's a twisted chord it's a
[1:45:20] it's a wound chord and everything's
[1:45:22] touching everything and you can't touch
[1:45:23] anything without pointing it back to
[1:45:24] Redemption somehow it seems amen
[1:45:26] what is it it's a seven seal plan what
[1:45:29] is it showing us the Redemption of God
[1:45:30] and how he's going to do it amen but
[1:45:33] it's funny because inside there is a
[1:45:34] mystery of how
[1:45:35] and we don't know how exactly it's going
[1:45:37] to work but we experience the how on a
[1:45:40] daily basis because we see what he's
[1:45:42] doing in our life and we don't always
[1:45:43] understand how but we know it's being
[1:45:45] done and the only question we don't know
[1:45:47] and nobody knows is when
[1:45:49] is when
[1:45:51] because we know that even when we see
[1:45:52] the Saints arise it's a 30 to 40 day
[1:45:54] period
[1:45:55] and so we don't know if it's going to be
[1:45:57] 30 31 32 halfway through the 33rd
[1:46:00] we don't know we don't know when that's
[1:46:02] up to him and Jesus said only the father
[1:46:04] knows that it's it's only one one one
[1:46:07] one thing knows it and so that's the
[1:46:09] only thing that he's held back is when
[1:46:10] is he going to do it but the prophet of
[1:46:12] God said there's only one thing left
[1:46:13] that I see he says and that's the going
[1:46:15] away of the church amen so we're in
[1:46:18] Redemption season
[1:46:19] because that's the final part of
[1:46:21] redemption is when he takes us away to
[1:46:23] be with him amen let's stand together if
[1:46:25] we would
[1:46:27] amen
[1:46:30] more of a Bible study I know this
[1:46:32] morning
[1:46:32] but again sending a foundation we don't
[1:46:34] want to preach out of a message book
[1:46:36] we want to take it back to the
[1:46:37] scriptures and then take what the
[1:46:39] prophet said and point us to where the
[1:46:40] scripture lines up with that it's
[1:46:42] amazing the things he says and boy if
[1:46:44] you pray about it and wait on it long
[1:46:45] enough and you see where he got it from
[1:46:47] it's absolutely it's astonishing the
[1:46:51] things that he pulled out of scripture
[1:46:52] and the only way it could happen was
[1:46:53] that he was a prophet amen that God
[1:46:55] would show him those things because it
[1:46:57] sometimes it hangs on literally one or
[1:46:58] two lines in obscure places and you see
[1:47:01] where he pulls these things from since
[1:47:02] is absolutely amazing but remember how
[1:47:05] he said he says after those Seven Seals
[1:47:07] he says the Bible became a brand new
[1:47:09] book because he saw now so often what
[1:47:11] we're stuck in is the Here and Now and
[1:47:14] what what happened when he opened those
[1:47:15] Seven Seals was he saw from beginning to
[1:47:17] end and he saw the great big plan of God
[1:47:19] he saw the purpose of God and then he
[1:47:21] saw how we tied into it he saw how our
[1:47:23] Redemption was going to happen and I
[1:47:24] think that's what changed his life was
[1:47:26] that he saw that God was doing something
[1:47:27] in a way that he'd never seen it before
[1:47:29] that's what we have to do this message
[1:47:31] is about taking us off this Earth amen
[1:47:33] about redeeming us back to that place
[1:47:35] and that's what we want to dwell on in
[1:47:37] these things and some of it's going to
[1:47:38] be mysterious in the sense that it's a
[1:47:40] mystery it's something that was hidden
[1:47:42] and being revealed and then like I said
[1:47:44] there's an experience that goes along
[1:47:45] with it because you're going to know if
[1:47:46] you're pregnant by the word of God Amen
[1:47:48] like I said Mary knew after a while she
[1:47:50] didn't know initially perhaps but maybe
[1:47:52] the next morning she woke up and she was
[1:47:53] going
[1:47:54] why am I throwing up oh oh morning
[1:47:57] sickness
[1:47:58] morning sickness then a month or two
[1:48:01] later you know maybe she's getting a
[1:48:02] little pooch in front she says okay this
[1:48:05] is happening and then pretty soon what
[1:48:07] happened what nine months later out come
[1:48:08] a baby and that was what the word
[1:48:10] manifested amen amen lots of little
[1:48:13] bumps and things along the road and
[1:48:15] difficulties but in the end the word of
[1:48:17] God wasn't going to be stopped and it's
[1:48:18] the exact same thing for you and I
[1:48:19] because there's going to be bumps on the
[1:48:21] road there's going to be struggles
[1:48:22] there's going to be trials there's going
[1:48:23] to be persecutions there's going to be
[1:48:25] people saying things about us amen but
[1:48:27] in the end what matters is what he said
[1:48:29] about us and whether we'll submit and
[1:48:31] let him do what he wants to do in our
[1:48:32] lives amen I mean let's bow our heads
[1:48:34] together Heavenly Father
[1:48:38] Lord when we see the care you have for
[1:48:40] us
[1:48:41] Lord when we see the Precision you have
[1:48:44] Lord how clearly
[1:48:45] and yet how simply you declare these
[1:48:48] things in your word Heavenly Father Lord
[1:48:50] it gives us Lord Assurance it gives us
[1:48:52] Comfort Lord that like Boaz you're not
[1:48:54] going to stop until you fulfill Lord you
[1:48:56] won't rest Lord that it's your Zeal
[1:48:59] that's going to make this Redemption
[1:49:00] plan happen and Lord all we want to do
[1:49:03] Lord is to rest in what you've said Lord
[1:49:06] that we not go out there and try and
[1:49:07] make it happen Lord but that we'd rest
[1:49:10] in the gifts Lord you've given gifts
[1:49:11] you've given food in due season Lord you
[1:49:14] provided us to wait on you and Lord may
[1:49:16] we not just be useless Lord but may we
[1:49:18] be ready to go at your word or that when
[1:49:21] you call we would be ready to go back
[1:49:22] into our inheritance Lord this is the
[1:49:25] time lord we're not waiting anymore Lord
[1:49:27] not that we're presuming to move out
[1:49:29] Lord but this is the fullness of
[1:49:31] redemption happening even in this day
[1:49:33] Lord so we know the land is ours Lord we
[1:49:35] know that what's written on the title
[1:49:37] deed of Our Lives Lord has been given to
[1:49:39] us to possess Lord and what you're
[1:49:41] asking us to do is step out by Faith
[1:49:43] Lord under the unction of the Holy
[1:49:45] Spirit to walk around this landlord and
[1:49:47] that our footsteps would be possession
[1:49:49] so Lord Lift us up into a higher realm
[1:49:52] of Faith Lord we don't want to get into
[1:49:54] mysteries for the sake of mysteries Lord
[1:49:56] but Lord may you just make it so simple
[1:49:58] and clear to us how you've planned this
[1:50:00] out Lord that we would know and believe
[1:50:02] and accept and understand it Lord and
[1:50:05] say just like Mary be it unto me
[1:50:07] according to your word Lord would you
[1:50:10] just grant us that Grace this afternoon
[1:50:12] and throughout the week or just be with
[1:50:14] us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[1:50:17] it amen amen
[1:50:20] let's sing that song
[1:50:24] greater than all my sin 1189 is the
[1:50:27] blood that still
[1:50:31] greater
[1:50:43] [Applause]

[1:50:54] free
[1:50:58] to praise him
[1:51:04] I know that the bus
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:18] sunrise
[1:51:21] I cannot fall
[1:51:24] off all it's greater than all the blood
[1:51:29] of the land
[1:51:33] greater than ourselves
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:57] to praise him
[1:52:02] I know that the Earth
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:07] [Applause]
