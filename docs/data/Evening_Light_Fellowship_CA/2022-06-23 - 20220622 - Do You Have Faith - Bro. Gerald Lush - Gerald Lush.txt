for the soul but for the body amen but we want to experience it in the soul and believe that we're going to experience it in our body amen praise the lord because we're going to receive a glorified body by the grace of god amen so god bless our sister rosalie and brother ed as they travel tomorrow uh some i believe it's late in the afternoon and to give them a safe journey amen and to give our again sister rosalie amen uh uh a good report at the doctors and at the hospital for the glory of god let's give the glory to jesus amen and tell of his wonderful love amen and so be in prayer and we'll see what the lord will do when our brother is coming i think i think they'll just be here for thursday and maybe friday and if they'd be oh yeah no they'll be here until saturday so they'll be driving back on saturday so the lord blessed them i don't know if they'd be able to stay for the water baptism or not but we'll leave that with the lord amen so god's grace to us all right and turn with me again to luke chapter 18 and let's begin to read at verse 1. i want to share some thoughts with you on the subject that our brother jonathan collette has been ministering on for a number of times and that is faith but i just want to go a little further with it and to take a different approach to faith and to go beyond just saying faith is this faith is that but let want to challenge faith do you have faith amen and his faith in control of your life are you governed by faith as the bible says sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god and brother if it's the spirit of god it's faith amen father it's all faith because without faith it is impossible to please him amen so brother i trust by grace that we have faith and we have the faith that pleases god amen well brother he's got it predestinated he's got it for ordained the faith that he that he wants you to have in the day you're living in in the hour you're living in and the age you're living in this is what god wants you to believe amen now i understand again by the grace of god that god wants the bride to believe this amen because he's given er of faith that brother sister he's not giving the others there's many others that profess to be christians many others professionally believers yeah but they're not all going in the rapture they're not going to be united with jesus as as the bright bride amen to the right group amen because why because we're going to be in the city we're going to basically make up the new jerusalem amen where others are going to be outside the city amen so they're not bright but they're still going to be there that's why i always try to encourage believers look keep your attitude right your spirit right to those out there because i've experienced it over the years but you know with fellowship with believers oh my they'd be looking down their noses at all of them are there and this one over there oh they go to this church they go to that church you better leave them amen and leave it in the hands of the lord amen because by the i trust by the grace of god that we'll see them outside the city amen and they'll be coming to the city just to fellowship with us we'll go outside the city to fellowship with them amen keep your spirit rape and your attitude right and understand again because again there are many that don't understand it amen that there many are called few are chosen but the calls are not lost amen so i believe that they're going to be there amen but there is he's got he chose the bride out of all that was called he chose a right amen so that we're going to sit with him in his throne praise the name of the lord oh the bible says oh there this is what it's going to bring there the bible says leaders and and rulers and so on in the world there are those that are going to be faithful they're those that are going to be christian and they're going to bring their glory and their honor into the city amen we're going to be in the city but they're just going to come in and visit and go back amen they'll live outside the city but i pray grace of god that we are amen we've got our we've got our our passport we've got what we need so that we oh yeah we we got access to the city oh yeah others don't have access they can come in and visit when we're there but they got to go back out again and live outside the city oh brother it's going to be a wonderful place and a wonderful spirit oh that's going to be wonderful do you think that there's going to be not going to be any unbelief there's not going to be any doubt there's not going to be no devil amen nothing nothing negative everything's going to be positive whether it's those outside the city whether it's the bride in the city it's going to be that positive spirit that positive faith amen that we believe and just saying why is it going to be like that because there won't be no devil there amen he knows the time is short he knows his time is short or just what is time yes he knows his time is short do we know our time physically is short but not spiritually amen because we're going to enter into a glorified body by the grace of god please in the name of jesus have faith praise the lord we're not going into a dream no no it's not not a dream no no it's going to be a reality it's going to be a real city we're going to be real people there's going to be going to be a real king and we're going to be the queen amen by the grace of almighty god so shall god be the glory god help us to have that faith amen that pleases him brother it's the faith it requires of the bride he's not asking that faith of them out there but he's asking that faith of those that you have professed to be the bride you expect in eternity to go into the city live in the city amen to have to have the rights in the city god help us amen and in luke chapter 18 verse 1 he said and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men not always to pray and not to faint amen always commit everything to the lord always stay in touch with god always stay in fellowship with god amen if you're walking in the spirit how can you forget god you can't if you're walking in the spirit and your sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit brother you're in constant awareness of his presence you can't get away from it no no no no matter what you're doing no matter where you're going he's with you as i've said even if i'm driving sometimes i'm talking to the lord amen you can't forget him brother uh if if you've got if th what's going on out there it's going to distract you and you you don't think about the lord and you're not going to talk to the lord and oh yeah you're not going to hear him when he when he wants to tell you this and tell you that he wants you to do this he wants you to do this go here go there oh brother sister i pray grace that we're going to be in the spirit so that we're going to be more sensitive to him brother don't let the devil distract you with because of what's going on over there in the world what's going on even in your job what's going on even in your home amen don't let satan distract you to the place where you forget god where you ignore jesus amen where you are not conscious that he is with you let us let us be conscious of his presence even in our worship here he is amen he's where he has gathered us amen he's there in the midst he'll never leave us never forsake us praise the name of the lord let's have that faith do we have that kind of faith it's not just to do i want to explain this concerning what faith is and faith is not just saying well i believe in god i got well you got faith oh no it's believing amen is believing what god wants us to believe amen when we when he wants us to believe it how he wants us to believe it amen it is god and not only that faith has to control us it's not you controlling faith it's faith controlling you amen and that's what i want to challenge us onto tonight amen does faith control you amen are you are you there to control faith well control what control what we believe we believe this we believe that no no brother you don't have to worry about that if faith is in control you go forth and live it reflect it amen god help us brother amen not to control faith let faith control you amen amen if you control faith you might question it if you might question this if it's revealed this is revealed that's revealed why why this why that you listen you don't question faith you follow it because you're led by the spirit of god amen and again verse 1 and they speak a parable unto them to this end that men not always to pray and not to faint let's not faint or get weak in our faith saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenger lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him amen are we calling on the lord morning noon and night are we in fellowship with him are we in contact with him amen because why in this world we constantly have need of him amen and brother we get out of this world we're going to need him we need him to take us all through this through this through this amen when we get into eternity we'll need him amen praise the lord so brother i pray grace that we have a real real real faith amen that we truly believe god amen and that faith is controlling us we're not controlling it amen so brother and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen god's grace that he's finding that faith in you and me god bless you you may be seated turn with me to romans chapter 1 share with you some scriptures concerning faith and again the faith not just a faith that says well i believe in god oh and i i believe the message brother it's a faith that controls us amen it's a faith that governs us it's a faith that leads us amen and it's just not us saying well i believe in god and and i believe the message i believe this is this is right here the the the prophet and what he preached there what he said there and what god said here in the bible amen brother it goes beyond just saying i believe it it goes it goes to the extent to the to the to the opportunity where it controls you amen do you i tell you that that proves whether or not you really really believe it if it controls you and if it governs all that you do morning noon and night amen because i tell you this that we are the seed of god we are the sons and daughters of god there's no way that we can we can we forget god there's no way that we can go through the day and not think about god no way we can go through a day and not talk to god amen and not not consider eternity and not consider well the new heaven and the new earth not just going to heaven but going to a new heaven and a new earth by the grace of god but because that's where we come from and that's where we want to get back to amen so i pray the grace of god help us to have that faith that pleases god amen the faith that pleases god is not just to say i believe that i believe genesis 1 and i believe this right there i believe this this doctrine right here oh yeah i believe that right there in revelation brother do we believe the plan purpose and pattern of god amen are we there to promote the plan and the purpose and the pattern of god are we there to to to constantly give ourselves into his under his control and say lord not my will thing be done amen we're here to live for him we're here to do what he wants us to do amen when he wants us to do it where he wants us to do it and how he wants us to do it so is god in control of your life amen well i got faith but i'm talking but if you really got the real faith that god wants you to have he's in control because lord brother sister too to have that faith he has to control your thoughts your words and brother if he controls your thoughts your words he controls your deeds amen it controls your life amen because you have given yourself over to him amen realizing lord that i was born this way i was born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies lord because because of what happened back there lord six thousand years ago but lord i'm so glad that you also amen you saw that was going to happen you knew this was going to happen and you provided a redeemer amen praise the lord hallelujah so that receiving your redeemer lord hallelujah that he would come the anointing would come and it would change our thoughts our attitudes amen it would give us hallelujah give us power over the devil give us power over the enemy power over the world we're living in amen what and what give us the faith press on you're on your way home amen you're not you're you're not just here just to oh you're gonna have to endure this and endure that and then you're gonna die and you're gone no no we come from heaven we're going back to heaven amen we come from glory we're going back to glory amen we were with god and we're going back to be with him amen but the thing of it is we've been we're here and we're tested and we're tried and and and what is what's what's god doing doing he's revealing his love he's revealing his concern amen and he wants to bring out your love and your concern amen go praise the lord not loving the church not loving this not loving that brother it's loving him oh it's not loving oh i love this doctrine i love this teaching love that brother brother the teaching or the doctrine is reflecting him amen it's the law of him hallelujah it's revealing jesus is revealing god amen amen it's giving us the revelation of his nature it's giving us the revelation of his character amen it's giving us the revelation of his plan and his purpose and his pattern amen oh brother it's not just it's not just oh the the devil god did this god did this and the devil came in and did that well i tell you the if the devil did this and the devil came and did that god allowed it god knew it was going to happen and god permitted it for a reason amen before he was oh praise the lord he was going to bring out islam and he was going to bring out yes your love amen hallelujah because again that the prophet of god said why he said god don't want us there and love him because we got to love him no no he said he love him because we want to love him amen love him now because now we know that it is not just he's god so i better i better i better love him and i better serve him no no he he allowed this to happen to so that he could bring out his character so you will see see god his actions and his reactions oh my he's god thank you lord that's wonderful what you've done what you're doing and what you will do it's wonderful thank you amen so you love him for himself by the grace of almighty god amen so the lord help us brother amen that we're going to have the faith that pleases god the faith amen motivated by love amen oh love gives it love receives it love responds to it amen it's it's a it's a eternal relationship oh thank god amen let's understand it that it's just not temporal and it's not like i said the the god this god did this but the devil came in and like we sometimes we we thought the devil is tricking god huh he's not tricking god not bullying me how could he trick god when god knows the end from the beginning amen so god knows he knew about the devil amen that he said you walked up and down in the close of fire you were you were you were an angel up there amen amen and yet and yet this happened and the enemy got and the devil got cast out so god knew all about it before it happened amen he knew what was going on he knew what was going to happen amen because he god had a plan god had a purpose god had a pattern amen god was working it out amen and brother his seed is going to going to come in line with it however the devil is there to get others to try and cause trouble you see that's what he's that's what he's the devil is trying to do all down through for all these years with the angels in heaven he was trying to cause trouble with god amen and when he came when god came down and created man on the earth the enemy came down and again god's permitting it for a reason amen and and the devil comes down amen again just to just to torment the lord amen just to try okay and be cause trouble for the lord oh yeah but god is allowing it for a reason amen god's bringing out his nature and his character and god's bringing out your nature and your character amen just don't think it's god knows you how are you responding how are you reacting amen brother are you reacting as the seed of god and the sons and daughters of god amen praise the lord brother it's going to come from the inside out amen because your nature is going to come from the inside out your natural nature and now your spiritual nature is coming out of your heart by the grace of god oh not you not just your brain no no one time is your feelings and your brain when it comes to natural you're going to reflect the your mom your dad your parents your grandparents and so on amen it's going to come out of you as you is your mind is the brain and and the senses of your flesh oh yeah you and your feelings oh yeah you're reflecting the old nature but being born again you're going to reflect is nature god's nature amen amen god help us the brother that we're and sister through that we're going to reflect god's nature are you going out there as a seed of god as sons and daughters of god not just church members no brother there's a lot of church members out there brother they're no different than the sinners that are out there when it comes to their thoughts and their motives and their objectives and what they're living for and how they're living amen the only difference between the the sinner and and them professing christians or the preferences professing christians going to a church we go to church you know on sunday or or wednesday or whatever some go for a few minutes other go for an hour two hours somewhat longer than that amen they feel that they now they can go on at a church and go do what they want to do themselves no no brother as seed of god as the sons and daughters of god our entire lives is given over to what god wants us to do amen we're going to go there and we're going to reflect the nature of god the nature of jesus amen and brother i tell you if you're born again you don't have to force yourself to do it it's natural amen amen you're not forcing yourself to act like mom and dad no no it's the nature it's in you brother there's a nature in you to what what for to reflect god to reflect jesus amen you don't have to force yourself to do this fortune no no no i'm born again and now it's just becomes a natural thing out of my soul and out of my heart yeah oh it's like there have been others that you know that god has blessed down through the ages and god has called them goddess and so on and they've had an experience with god amen and they go there and they're living a certain life and and their sinners are there says oh they're christians and so on by the grace of god as i said that when i was working even for the even for the military amen for for quite a while and again this one time when i was i was there and and this gentleman came over to me and tapped me on the shoulder and i said yes i said what do you do what do you want oh he said i just want to i just wanted to let you know that i know he said that you are a christian i said you do you know that oh yes he said i know it he said he said nobody they didn't have to tell me that he said i know and i saw i said well thank the lord to god be the glory well he said that's good he said but i know he said by your spirit and your attitude he said you're christian amen why because that's the nature of your nature of my heavenly father amen not the nature of my natural father and other nature i'm a natural mother no no but it's it's a spiritual nature now that takes control over that natural one god help us you're going forth to reflect not jordan the not the nature natural nature of mom and dad but the spiritual nature of god that's in control amen and oh yeah we know that it's got to control that physical nature you got it's there to control that oh yeah by the grace of god amen because oh well i'm going to act like dad i'm going to act like mom and and the holy ghost is there amen when the enemy is there to try to get you to bring out that natural nature the holy ghost is there amen to convict you to stay with the spiritual nature what do do what god wants you to do how god wants you to do it amen and when god wants you to do it and where brother sons and daughters of god again are led by the spirit of god amen and brother if if you are truly seed of god you will be led by the spirit of god amen that's like us like in the natural because you're you're you're you're this this man and this woman's child amen that in the natural you will experience their nature yeah it was passed on to you naturally but the spiritual birth takes control amen amen and oh yeah that that old nature is still there and the enemy is working on that but god is there by the holy ghost to keep reminding you stay with this follow my leadership amen this is what i want you to do amen by the grace of god brother do we have that faith real faith not believing the doctrine believing this believing that it's amen is having an experience a new birth amen this this this yeah praise the lord there's too many got intellectual faith and it's all based on what it's all based on on a denominational creed oh we believe this we believe that and so on brother i tell you this if you're born again a seed of god you won't need no creed you've got the word amen and the holy ghost is there and what what's he going to do he will bring it automatically bring out the word amen oh it will you just can't get away from the word it is written it is written it is written amen this is the true faith brother sister and i pray grace i'll tell you this if it's a true faith if it's a holy ghost faith amen by the by the grace of god by the anointing of the holy ghost amen that it it controls you you don't control faith faith controls you oh yeah but again now if it's intellectual it it'll control you not you can rather you control it but brother let the faith control you and brother this too it's gonna it's gonna be just so natural as it were and whereas one time we would do this we'd act this way react this way but then when you're born again oh everything changes your attitude is different your spirit is different your reaction is different amen and people people have noticed changes in people and say what happened to you because they knew that they would react this way they react that way they do this they say that but all of a sudden after they're born again oh they're different their different attitude a different spirit different actions different reactions amen because now it's not just them it's the holy ghost in them it's god in them amen it's the nature of god by the spirit in them so in your job in your life do you have the nature of god is the nature of god in control in what you do and how you do it what you say how you say it how you react amen to circumstances situations oh over the years i've seen many many even so-called believers brother they didn't react with the nature of god or they went to church but they reacted with their own nature now when this happened that happened and they reacted this way they're not christian they profess to be christian but they never they haven't been born again to get god's nature to get god's nature you've got to be born again and you'll go out and you'll talk like god you'll act like god you'll react like god amen like god yeah now they may not think oh well that's god in in this one if there's person out there spiritual they will recognize god in in the christian but others would just think oh they're different they got a different attitude they got a different spirit oh yeah amen so brother let's have the faith that pleases god amen amen the faith that pleases god is god in control amen it is not you it is not the devil just by by by the letter of the word no no it's the holy ghost the spirit of the word in you praise the lord we're not going forth reflecting just the letter the letter the letter no we're going for reflecting the the spirit of the word of god amen by the grace of god and again in romans chapter 1 and verse 16. and he said for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ no way for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith amen go with me to galatians chapter 2. let me share with you the scripture galatians chapter 2. let's begin to read that verse let's let's read it verse 15. we who are jews by nature are not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ amen we are justified by the faith of jesus praise the lord and brother he comes to give you that revelation amen he comes to convict you of your need of him and brother if he justifies us amen by the faith of jesus we're justified amen by the grace of god we need jesus he sanctifies us we need him amen again without him we can do nothing amen and if we are truly born again as the seed of god sons and daughters of god this is true that it's not you living it's jesus living in you that's i am is that your your nature when you act a certain way you react in a certain way is it jesus are you really conscious of jesus are you really conscious of your godly nature most are not they're conscious of doctrines and theology but not their nature and brother without this you're not going to eternity without this you'll not be you'll never be in the resurrection you won't be in the rapture you've got to have the nature of jesus amen to identify with the resurrection and the rapture because as he resurrected we resurrect as he was raptured we rapture with his anointing amen god help us brother to realize it god help us to believe it amen so he said again in verse 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law even we have belief or rather but by the faith of jesus christ amazing even we have believed in jesus believe in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ amen oh brother god help us amen his again is not just believing that jesus oh he came and look what he did he laid down his life for us and he and he picked it up again amen he resurrected praise the lord yes but brother we are justified by what he did amen even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by his faith by the faith of jesus oh my god help us to believe amen god helps to believe with a perfect faith amen a faith that controls us not you controlling your faith is your faith controlling you by the grace of god there's too many controlling their faith it's just doctrine the prophet said this the prophet said that well that's good but the thing of it is is it is it influencing your life it's not just your head not just your doctrine not just your theology but is it is it influencing you onto eternal life the word amen brother we're justified by what jesus has done we're justified by what jesus is doing amen just think this is not just a good doctrine and for this and for that and it's going to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen brother it's justifying us in the presence of god let's acknowledge that we're justified by the hearing of the word we're justified by receiving the word oh yeah but no words is going to give us this faith yes but we got to mature you got to be born again amen amen and with the new birth comes the revelation of what justification you're justified and sanctification you're sanctified is what god has done what god is doing through our lord jesus christ see i tell you without him you can do nothing you need jesus you need him every day you need him every hour you need him every moment yes amen oh well i believe what jesus did but do you believe what he's doing see he's come back to reveal it in you and me he's come back to make it flesh and you and me amen it was made it made flesh in him and in that body called jesus now he's come back to be in you what for justified and sanctify you and me oh brother sister again without him we can do nothing oh that's all right all i got to do is believe what he did no yes believe what he did but believe what he's doing and believe what he what he will do amen he did this at calvary good but then he came back amen to share it with us because why because jesus was justified jesus sanctified jesus did this jesus did that now he's come back to reveal it in you and me come back to make it live in you and me god of us keep our spirits right lord lord keep our attitudes right amen lord i i well what will our spirit be like what will our attitude be like it'll be humble amen if there's anyone with humility it'll be the sons and daughters of god amen jesus was humble amen did oh yeah peter would rebuke him for this and rebuke him for that amen because he never comprehended jesus humility now he would minister to this one minister to that one amen he humbled himself to minister to sinners to you and me amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah oh brother sister grace i pray grace that we have faith that's controlling us and if it controls you it'll humble you definitely amen grace faith revelation oh brother sister or not just building us up building us up intellectually so that we know doctrines oh we know but we know more about this about the word of god than they know out there in those churches oh god has revealed this god's revealed that it's exactly but brother it wasn't to highlight us and make us better than them out there is to humble us oh yeah to humble us into what into into our unity with our lord jesus christ into awareness with jesus to humble ourselves and to recognize jesus what he did wha you need him we need him yet you need jesus why do you need him you need him because of this what he did and that will humble you when you consider what he did for you what he had to do for you it'll humble you lord you had to do this yes my son i had to do this because this was your nature and this is what you needed we needed jesus but yeah we needed jesus but we needed what he did that's why he did what he did and he come back oh yeah oh yeah he knew that to redeem us he had to do that to get us back he had to do that amen to give us the i want to bring us to that that opportunity of being born again he had to do that he had to suffer he had to he had to humble himself he had he had to endure those things and and and lay down his life oh yeah brother just think what he did christ on the cross have you considered what he endured on the cross he was naked now all the paintings they don't have him naked they have a lot lot almost all of his clothes is gone but when it comes to the the lower part of his body there they usually have a garment around there but brother when he died on the cross he had nothing he was totally naked he endured that he enjoyed it for you he didn't do it for me amen if he endured all these things to redeem you and me what were we willing to endure what are we willing to do amen and endure for him take our stand for jesus god help us oh yes he has ordained it in such a way well god predestinated god ordained it in such a way that he would have to experience this at calvary he would experience this in dealing with man and and being rejected by man and by brother god also predestinated it so that we would have to bring out this you bring out this in you bring up that in me look what he brought out in himself in jesus christ through his predestination for redemption amen so what's he bringing out in you and me requiring that what in our experience of redemption and we're going to go forth oh lord did i i experienced this you mean to tell me i got to take this stand and i got to take that i got to bear this reproach i got to bear that yes my son you do all down through and even the church ages there was almost 70 million christians laid down their lives they were killed because they were christians because they took their stand for the word in their day are we going to take our stand for the word in this hour to the point of being rejected oh well they won't be the hour's coming when we will that hour's coming i pray grace that god is giving us the faith that we will need in that hour that we have the faith wherein that we will make the sacrifice that he made in as it were willing to sacrifice everything what for for the gospel sake for the kingdom of god's sake amen for the glory of god for the resurrection for the rapture amen by the grace of god take your stand for the truth so you're not going to compromise with family friends neighbors not by any means you know do your neighbors know who you are i trust they do did he know your your faith amen because of the stand you take and you are totally separated onto the lord and it's just not sometimes just not the way you dress or or you know you won't do this you won't do that are you totally separate unto the lord is your life reflecting jesus are you reflecting jesus christ god help us let's see galatians chapter 2 verse 17 again but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor why through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god amen oh brother sister are you living for god are you living for god do you know god do you really know do you really have fellowship with him when you humble yourself in the in in the evening the day is over it's finished you really humble yourself they to thank god for for what he did for you for his grace to you through the day did you or did you experience any grace through the day amen i pray grace to us amen that at the end of the day we want to thank god for grace amen thank god for for helping us strengthen us encouraging us amen protecting us oh what do you protect us from well ask the lord you let him know he'll let you know amen oh brother see that you may you you may go through the day and think oh no well the lord didn't do this oh yes he did there are things that the devil would would have done to you and if god wasn't on the scene you you pay a big price oh yes because i tell you this the devil's come down with great wrath knowing his time is short and brother i tell you the devil is there to attack the believer but the angels of god are there god is there to protect you so don't think oh well i went through the day nothing happened this didn't happen that didn't happen that's right why because of the grace of god because if god was there to protect you the angels of god were there to protect you and brother if they weren't oh what you would endure what the devil would do to you brother let's thank god for his grace through the day amen we take things too many believers take things too lightly yeah but i tell you if you really got the revelation of redemption of salvation oh no you don't take anything lightly thank you jesus that you brought me through this day yeah or don't take it for granted oh that's all right i just made it through the day that's all right don't own by yourself say thank you jesus why because the devil was there oh yeah but god was there to protect you from the devil don't think you oh i never had no problems and i read this why i pray god that you got the understanding the revelation of what he has done and what he's doing to protect you just think if he didn't protect you what would happen to you thank god for such grace amen so he said again in verse 17 if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid amen and if i build for again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor he said for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god amen yes live to the lord and verse 20 he said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live why because we got his resurrection power is anointing yet not i but christ liveth in me praise the lord and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god oh grace brother that we have his faith amen considering his faith what he did for us and what he's doing we need that faith hallelujah so he said and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me amen by grace so he said i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain but it came by grace not the law it came by the love of god not the law amen and he voluntarily laid down his life and was crucified that we would live amen and we would experience his faith and it says i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me thank you jesus praise the name of the lord go with me to another scripture to ii peter chapter 1 2 peter chapter 1. again wanting to emphasize perfect faith wanting to emphasize faith that controls us amen it's not just to think about what is your faith well i believe this i believe this i believe that when it comes to doctrine and and theology no no faith is christ in us amen controlling us praise the lord so brother not you controlling faith but let faith control you and what is faith faith is a firm conviction producing a full acknowledgement of god's revelation and truth do we have that firm conviction amen by the holy ghost producing a full acknowledgement of god's truth god's word god's revelation amen yes our faith is our personal surrender to jesus amen we have surrendered to him amen our faith is the life inspired by surrendering to jesus amen the life you reflect is a testimony that you have surrendered to him amen it's not you in control it's jesus in control not you that lives is christ living in you just think of that no matter what you're doing where you're going is christ in you the job you're doing is jesus doing it if it's not you that lives christ lives in you your brother is controlling what you're doing how you do it when you do it where you do it that's why that oh yeah you're not gonna you're you're gonna be different from all the others that you work with all the others that you live with all the others that you that you have fellowship with sometimes out there in the world neighbors and so on yeah again it's tremendous as i said that when we sold that house there in paradise and the neighbor across the road trying to wanted her daughter to buy it but she wouldn't do it she was she was really interested in at first but until her mother expressed the fact that that the owners was a pastor and his wife and she said they were this they did this they did that and so on well it frightened the daughter she wouldn't buy it they said why not no she said considering she said the ones that lived there she said my mother told her this and and we did this we did this we did that and she said there they were he was a pastor and his wife oh my she said no considering she said what i would do in that house she said well i bought it no sure i wouldn't do it she said considering she said who lived there god respect her for that most definitely amen or his most definitely the lord will bless him for that god help us amen to reflect jesus and in second peter chapter one and beginning to read at verse 1. simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ amen precious faith is your faith precious grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power has given to unto us all things that pertain under life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue and whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises amen exceeding great and precious promises not just promises but you're exceeding great and they're precious amen are we going to respect it or we would respect you know for if we were associated with certain individuals out there you know but how are we going to respect because of our association with jesus oh we think oh well one you think it would be tremendous or great if you knew the the queen or or the prince or the princess and so on and you were associated with them oh yeah friends of them and so on oh brother what about jesus what about jesus people put emphasis too much on the natural but not on the spiritual grace of god to us so he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature oh god help us partakers of his nature amazing having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence giving all diligence oh brother god help us add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge the knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ hallelujah but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see a fire off just think you add this to your faith and if you don't have it oh my lord grace to us please seriously consider what we have read here and amen because he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins amazing this is serious make your calling and your election sure amen do you seriously apply the word to your life and say lord is this me amen besides this he said give all diligence and add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and we're referring to spiritual attributes spiritual not natural to temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity amen and it is divine love for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall be neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen because in again i pray grace that we are not barren we're not unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ because the bible said again in verse two grace and peace be motivated unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord amen according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue oh brother let's have respect unto the knowledge of our lord jesus christ because he that lacks these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins and wherefore he said the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure amen be really sincere amen let's not assume it take it for granted no let's make her our calling and election sure for if we do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ amen and amen and amen just a couple of more scriptures go to first peter chapter 2 first peter chapter 2 and verse 21. for even iran to were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps so we're following the steps of jesus and brother it's not just following a man's this man or following this woman you know what no no it's the following the steps of jesus amen let's go back in you can go back rather and just just read the gospels wherein they give the give the revelation of jesus in matthew mark luke john amen and let's compare our lives to the life of jesus compare our attitude to jesus attitude our actions and reactions to his is tremendous oh well we can't live that life can we yes how well he laid down his life picked it up again and said sent the life of his blood back to us the life of his blood revealing his nature amen so that now the the anointing of the holy ghost in you is going to bring forth the nature of jesus praise the lord and as he laid his life down for us we lay our lives down for one another amen again in first peter 2 and 21 for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps so you are you living the life of jesus are you reflecting the example that jesus reflected and it says refer to jesus who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again and when he suffered he threatened not just committed himself to him that judges righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed i pray grace lord through the power anointing of the life of of jesus blood that we are dead to sin amen one more scripture ephesians chapter 4. praise the lord and ephesians 4 and verse 4. there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling amen one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all making our calling and election sure let's make sure that we have our relationship with one lord and one faith one baptism one father one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all grace of god that we have such faith for the glory of god amen reflecting not just reflecting doctrine and theology and and the letter of the word but reflecting the person of the word our lord jesus christ amen brother this is a faith that controls us it's not us controlling the faith no it's the faith controlling us by the grace of god we appreciated all that our brother jonathan was ministering concerning faith but brother i trust by the grace of god hallelujah that we're going to we're going to judge our faith by the word of god to make sure that we have holy ghost faith amen make sure that we have the faith that god amen wants us to have the faith that god has ordained and predestinated for us to have amen it is the faith that cometh by the hearing of the word amen bear with me it's like i preached one time and the audience got real quiet and they're all looking at their pastor who was sitting in a front pew and he turned around and again as i said there might have been a couple hundred people there in the church and he turned around and looked down at the congregation and he just shook his head no he didn't he didn't agree with what i was saying amen but then i said all right i said i'll give you the scripture i'll give you the word because i told them and they didn't believe it i said i want to know that i have been resurrected and not only that i said i've been raptured and they got real quiet they never heard it before and the preacher the pastor didn't agree with it and he just shook his head you know no no no no no no and i said all right i'll say i'll prove it to you and i read ephesians 2. and i said you as he quickened i said resurrected yes i said yeah i said who were dead in trespasses and sins i said yeah we were dead and sin i was dead and seeing and i said i had experience in the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost and i said i was quickened i was resurrected spiritually i said in my soul i experienced resurrection and to believe for that resurrection in my body yeah i said what it begins in the inside your finish on the outside amen and i said yeah and what about raptured and they said wondering yeah what about the rapture you're raptured yes i'm raptured and again they found it hard to believe well i said i'll give you the scripture and i said it's ephesians 2 1 i've been resurrected and i trust you've been resurrected you've experienced resurrection in the new birth amen because you were dead now you're alive and then i said go on down and i said we're in let's see oh yeah and i said but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ amen praise the lord well christ was resurrected so he spiritually resurrected us in our souls he said by grace ye are saved and he said again god hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus i said we've been raptured and the problem god said yeah we've been cut up into heavenly places in christ and what's going on there you've heard me preach this a number of times and the prophet of god said what's going on there in heavenly places in christ and the prophet said the word is being revealed so i said i challenged them now i said i want you to answer me have you been resurrected amen have you been quickened and have you been caught up into a heavenly place in christ to catch the revelation of the word the word is being revealed hallelujah we've been raptured amen we've been caught up amen together and he has made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen i trust by the grace of god amen that we're not controlling our faith our faith controls us amen and if our faith controls us it's raising us up amen it quickens us makes us alive in christ and resurrects us and raptures us in christ amen raised up into heavenly places where the words revealed to give us the faith for the physical changes that we're looking for amen to god be the glory amen i trust by the grace of god make your calling and election sure make sure amen that your faith controls you is not you controlling your faith amen it is the faith by the revelation of the word of god amen is controlling you amen it's not you by the letter of the word controlling it there was a thought i had there concerning this and it says the individual who lives walks by faith is misunderstood and they misunderstand why what where and when of that person's life amen even other believers misunderstood the prophet in his faith walk and they did they misunderstood him they misunderstood now they're misunderstanding believers amen concerning the walk that they're walking to talk concerning the life that they're living god have mercy on us amen the lord bless you amen again let's make sure that our faith is controlling us not us controlling our faith amen if our faith controls us then god by faith controls is controlling us amen lord bless you let's stand and let's sing blessed assurance
