[27:04] we've been listening to the story of
[27:07] moses taking the
[27:09] children of israel out of egypt and
[27:12] their
[27:13] way in the desert and this
[27:16] is in exodus and it says and when they
[27:19] came to mara
[27:20] they could not drink of the waters of
[27:22] marah
[27:23] for they were bitter
[27:28] therefore the name of it was called mara
[27:31] and the people murmured against moses
[27:33] saying what shall we drink
[27:36] and he cried unto the lord and the lord
[27:38] showed him a tree
[27:40] which when he had casted into the waters
[27:43] the waters were made sweet
[27:49] there he made for them a statute and an
[27:52] ordinance
[27:53] and there he proved them and said if
[27:56] thou wilt diligently hearken to the
[27:58] voice of the lord thy god
[28:00] and won't do that which is right in his
[28:02] sight
[28:03] and will give ear to his commandments
[28:05] and keep all his statutes
[28:08] i will put none of these diseases upon
[28:10] thee which i have brought upon the
[28:12] egyptians
[28:13] for i am the lord that healeth thee
[28:17] when this is called fields notes they
[28:19] were just really good
[28:21] um these bitter waters were in the very
[28:24] path
[28:25] of the lord's leading and stand for the
[28:28] trials of god's people
[28:31] which are educatory sorry and not
[28:33] punitive which means inflicting
[28:35] or intended as punishment the tree is
[28:39] the cross
[28:40] christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[28:42] of the law being made
[28:44] curse for us for it is written cursed is
[28:47] everyone that hangeth on a tree
[28:49] which became sweet to christ as
[28:52] the expression of the father's will for
[28:55] jesus said unto peter put up thy sword
[28:58] unto thy sheep the cup
[28:59] which my father hath given me shall i
[29:02] not drink it
[29:04] and when our mars are so taken we cast
[29:07] the tree
[29:08] into the waters in romans
[29:12] he has and not only so but we glory in
[29:14] tribulations also
[29:16] knowing that tribulation worketh
[29:18] patience and patience experience
[29:21] and experience hope and hope maketh not
[29:24] ashamed
[29:26] because the love of god is shed abroad
[29:28] in our hearts
[29:29] by the holy ghost which is given unto us
[29:41] [Music]
[29:52] so
[30:07] from the love of my own comfort
[30:15] from the fear of having nothing
[30:23] from a life of worldly passions
[30:37] [Music]
[30:48] need to be accepted
[30:55] from the fear of being lonely
[31:05] [Music]
[31:16] me
[31:20] and i shall not want
[31:24] no i shall not
[31:42] no i shall not want
[31:50] i shall not want
[31:57] from the fear of serving
[32:01] others
[32:04] from the fear of death or trial
[32:12] from the fear of humility
[32:34] [Music]
[32:40] i
[32:49] i shall
[33:06] i shall not
[33:15] i shall not want
[33:26] [Music]
[34:18] so
[34:27] [Music]
[34:43] when i test
[35:08] he lies awake there all alone
[35:12] most every night
[35:17] looking back on all of his mistakes
[35:25] wishing through the tears that he could
[35:29] just go back
[35:33] cause there's a lot of things he'd like
[35:36] to change
[35:41] he just can't forgive himself
[35:45] and forget
[35:49] even though god already did
[35:54] if he can love someone
[35:58] and find the good within
[36:02] in spite of what they've done
[36:06] no matter where they've been
[36:10] if he can let it go
[36:14] and set the deader free

[36:22] you and me
[36:26] why can't we
[36:33] there been times i've been so hurt by
[36:37] someone else
[36:40] i didn't wanna give a second chance
[36:48] i let all the bitterness
[36:52] take control
[36:56] and took grace into my
[36:59] own hands
[37:04] but even jesus said whoever's done
[37:08] no wrong
[37:12] let him throw the first stone
[37:17] if he can love someone
[37:21] and find the good within
[37:23] [Music]
[37:25] in spite of what they've done
[37:28] no matter where they've been
[37:33] if he can let it go
[37:36] and set the deader free
[37:41] if he can keep forgiving
[37:45] you and me
[37:49] why can't we
[37:54] he was hated and rejected
[37:58] betrayed by those he trusted
[38:02] even hanging on the cross
[38:06] he said father please forgive them
[38:12] if he can love someone
[38:16] and find the good within
[38:20] in spite of what they've done
[38:23] no matter where they've been if he can
[38:28] let it
[38:32] set the deader free
[38:35] if he can keep forgiving
[38:39] you and me
[38:43] if he can love someone
[38:47] and find the good within
[38:51] in spite of what they've done
[38:54] no matter where they've been
[38:58] if he can let it go
[39:02] and set the deader free
[39:06] if he can keep forgiving
[39:10] you and me

[40:16] other
[40:18] as we all make mistakes and we all
[40:21] we all hurt each other not intentionally
[40:23] but it happens
[40:25] and that's where that's where we humble
[40:28] ourselves and that's where forgiveness
[40:30] kicks in and that's where god comes
[40:31] right on the scene amen
[40:34] it's uh speaks volumes that i'm not a
[40:38] preacher you'd never get out of the song
[40:40] service

[45:48] a close on joshua
[45:50] uh you know he's we've covered the major
[45:52] battles we've covered the major issues
[45:53] we've
[45:54] learned the lessons from him and as we
[45:56] start to do that
[45:57] there's not a whole lot left in the book
[45:59] of joshua but as we finish with him
[46:00] we're going to transition more into
[46:02] ephesians because there's a lot more
[46:03] depth in ephesians
[46:05] joshua's a type but in ephesians we get
[46:06] to see paul dealing directly with the
[46:08] believer
[46:09] right there's there's no there's no
[46:10] types there's no shadows anymore now
[46:12] it's
[46:12] it's direct instruction a minute
[46:14] something that we can take and apply
[46:15] directly we don't have to filter it
[46:17] we don't have to say well that was for
[46:18] another day that was a message for
[46:19] another people
[46:20] but that's a message just for us amen we
[46:22] don't go through types and shadows now
[46:24] but the holy spirit is speaking
[46:25] expressly to the bride through the
[46:27] message of paul the apostle amen
[46:29] amen but as we start on this path today
[46:31] on a worthy life we want to look at it
[46:33] from the starting point all the way to
[46:34] the finish line
[46:35] for joshua amen it's a wonderful thing
[46:37] to be born and raised in a christian
[46:39] home
[46:39] it's a wonderful thing to have an
[46:41] atmosphere set for you to have a new
[46:43] birth it's a wonderful thing to have the
[46:44] proper instruction
[46:46] from the very beginning you know we had
[46:47] some friend some believers over the
[46:49] other day and we were commenting how
[46:50] just being raised in a christian home
[46:52] being raised around the message is a
[46:54] tremendous thing and there's a
[46:55] tremendous blessing in it
[46:56] because you don't tend to get caught up
[46:58] in the things that trip you up later on
[47:00] in life
[47:00] when people make mistakes they tend to
[47:02] make them early on in life because they
[47:04] lack the instruction because they don't
[47:05] know what is right and what is wrong
[47:07] and so they get sucked into things that
[47:09] will change their lives forever
[47:10] and whether it's the sensuality of the
[47:12] world whether it's drugs and alcohol
[47:13] whether it's a focus on a career
[47:15] amen these things that you could if you
[47:17] get stuck at the beginning it's very
[47:18] hard to break the cycle later on
[47:20] and so when you're raised around
[47:21] believers when you're raised going to
[47:23] church
[47:23] there's a blessing that's with it
[47:24] there's a hedge of protection that comes
[47:26] with just simple
[47:27] obedience to the word while you're young
[47:29] and then it keeps you from going down
[47:30] certain paths
[47:31] and in the end you're you're certainly
[47:33] better off than a typical worldly person
[47:36] amen you're
[47:36] you're a good citizen if nothing else
[47:38] when you're raised around church amen
[47:40] but that is not the starting point
[47:42] amen when we're talking about a worthy
[47:43] life it is not the starting point to
[47:45] hang around holy ghost-filled believers
[47:46] to have holy ghost-filled parents that's
[47:48] a benefit but your life doesn't start
[47:51] until you get the
[47:52] life of the holy ghost amen until you
[47:53] get the life of god until he calls you
[47:56] that's when the starting point is for
[47:57] you and until he calls you
[47:59] you can't do anything for his his
[48:01] kingdom
[48:02] right why because you can't do it the
[48:04] way he wants you can have the right
[48:05] motive and the right objective
[48:06] sometimes you can do good things but if
[48:08] it's not done the way he wants in the
[48:10] in the intent that he wants then it's
[48:11] actually not considered good amen you've
[48:13] got to have the full package when it
[48:14] comes to god amen
[48:16] and you'll know when you're called
[48:17] because you'll it'll consume your mind
[48:19] amen these young men that came to the
[48:21] lord and then talking with my own son it
[48:22] was dwelling on him and he couldn't get
[48:24] away from it
[48:25] and when i was in that same boat that's
[48:26] exactly the way it was is you can't get
[48:28] away from the call of god
[48:29] amen it's something that drops in and it
[48:31] consumes your your thought it consumes
[48:33] your times you know listening to
[48:35] brother brother mark's testimony and his
[48:36] testimony that and just
[48:38] the how it just it completely
[48:40] overwhelmed their life
[48:41] amen when god comes on the scene it just
[48:43] completely overwhelms you and you can't
[48:45] get away from what he's calling
[48:46] you to do amen whether it's a surrender
[48:48] in your life whether it's a call to a
[48:50] ministry whether it's a call to a
[48:51] particular place to live a church a
[48:53] spouse
[48:53] it can be so many things but when god's
[48:55] moving it consumes you
[48:57] until you surrender to it amen if you're
[48:59] a true son or daughter of god
[49:00] brother brahm said if he's calling you
[49:02] and you reject it and you
[49:03] reject it reject it then pretty soon
[49:05] that goes away and you know you're not a
[49:06] son or a daughter of god
[49:08] because the will to do it goes away amen
[49:09] the desire to do it goes away and it's
[49:11] god was giving you a chance
[49:12] and then you crossed over that line
[49:14] between judgment and grace amen
[49:17] but as we look at joshua we want to see
[49:18] where his calling was laid out
[49:20] the beautiful thing with joshua is that
[49:21] before he ever gets his call
[49:23] he has a track record of being the right
[49:25] kind of man for the job amen joshua has
[49:27] gone through many
[49:28] many testings many trials amen the first
[49:30] thing that happened after they crossed
[49:32] over was moses went up to get the word
[49:33] of the lord and what did the rest of
[49:34] israel do
[49:35] they made a calf they made a golden calf
[49:37] and joshua's not identified with that
[49:39] worship
[49:39] he stayed firmly on the side of the word
[49:41] when they spoke against moses joshua
[49:43] stayed with moses he stayed with the
[49:45] messenger for the hour
[49:46] amen when they go over jordan and they
[49:48] look over the land he is one of only two
[49:50] that says we are more than able to take
[49:52] the country amen
[49:53] we're more than able to take it because
[49:54] god said and so all the way through this
[49:57] we see that joshua
[49:58] has stayed with the message he stayed
[49:59] with the word of his hour he stayed with
[50:01] the prophet of his hour
[50:02] and he hasn't moved from that one iota
[50:04] amen he's always stayed where god wanted
[50:06] him to stay amen
[50:07] and it's funny because when god calls
[50:09] joshua there's really only two people he
[50:11] can call it's joshua caleb
[50:12] everyone else is dead when you're
[50:14] looking for an experienced believer it's
[50:15] joshua or caleb really
[50:16] unless he's going to raise up a really
[50:18] young person to do it so it's joshua
[50:20] caleb and then god starts to do that
[50:22] and he starts to to say josh was going
[50:24] to be the next man
[50:25] but we see how god has prepared that man
[50:27] all the way through life
[50:29] he has proven him right he has showed
[50:31] the people that this is a man that can
[50:32] be trusted that this is a man that has
[50:34] stayed with god
[50:35] all the way throughout his life and now
[50:37] i'm going to step him into a bigger
[50:38] position
[50:39] i'm going to put a greater
[50:40] responsibility on his shoulders but you
[50:42] can trust him because you look at his
[50:43] track record and he's done the right
[50:44] thing all along the path amen
[50:46] it's interesting to me how god always
[50:48] prepares the man for the position
[50:50] he doesn't just drop somebody in usually
[50:51] but he's prepared his path
[50:53] all the way to bring him to where he is
[50:55] when god puts him into that elevated
[50:57] position amen
[50:58] joshua's been through the ringer he's
[50:59] been through the desert he's been over
[51:00] the mountain he's done all of it
[51:02] and he stayed true to god through it and
[51:04] so god now says this is my
[51:05] this is the next man for the job if we
[51:07] look in numbers 27 this is joshua's
[51:09] calling
[51:10] it said and the lord said unto moses get
[51:12] thee up into this mount to baram
[51:14] and see the land which i have given unto
[51:15] the children of israel
[51:17] and when thou hast seen it thou shalt
[51:19] also be gathered to thy people as aaron
[51:21] thy brother was gathered
[51:22] in other words once you go up on the
[51:23] mountain and look over canaan i'm going
[51:25] to take you home with me
[51:27] and for ye rebelled against my
[51:29] commandment in the desert of zinn
[51:30] in the strife of this congregation to
[51:32] sanctify me at the water before their
[51:34] eyes
[51:35] that is the water of maraba and kadish
[51:37] in the wilderness of sin
[51:38] remember moses he struck the rock twice
[51:41] right he wasn't supposed to do that and
[51:42] he disobeyed god and he glorified
[51:44] himself rather than god
[51:46] and so god said because of that you
[51:47] don't get to go into the land
[51:49] amen moses broke the type there we know
[51:52] so he's not allowed to go in so moses
[51:54] comes back to god and he says and moses
[51:56] spake unto the lord saying
[51:58] let the lord the god of the spirits of
[52:00] all flesh set a man
[52:02] over the congregation which may go out
[52:04] before them
[52:05] and which may go in before them and
[52:07] which may lead them out
[52:08] and which may bring them in that the
[52:10] congregation of the lord be not a sheep
[52:12] which have no shepherd
[52:14] he says god you need to replace me then
[52:16] these these people need a shepherd
[52:18] they need a leader they need somebody to
[52:19] take them through to do everything that
[52:21] you've called them to do
[52:23] verse 18 says and the lord said unto
[52:24] moses take thee
[52:26] joshua the son of nun a man in whom is
[52:29] the spirit and lay thine hand upon him
[52:32] and set him before elizar the priest and
[52:34] before all the congregation
[52:36] and give him a charge in their sight and
[52:39] thou
[52:39] shalt put some of thine honor upon him
[52:42] that all the congregation of the
[52:44] children of israel may be obedient now
[52:46] notice here it says moses is to put some
[52:48] of his honor that doesn't just mean
[52:50] honor it says authority he's supposed to
[52:51] give him partial
[52:52] authority over the children of israel
[52:55] but you see that he can't
[52:57] god doesn't tell him to give all of it
[52:59] to him he just says give some of it to
[53:01] him
[53:02] because there's a transition that's
[53:03] happening and one thing you'll always
[53:05] see in the scripture
[53:06] is that god can anoint two men for the
[53:07] same position amen so
[53:09] god doesn't say i'm gonna put everything
[53:11] on him now he says there's a transition
[53:13] coming so
[53:14] because the people know and trust you
[53:16] stand them up in front of the church
[53:17] and lay your hands on them and say this
[53:19] is god's choice and give him some author
[53:22] give him some honor
[53:23] and put your authority on him but he's
[53:25] not ready just yet this is not his time
[53:27] yet but he's being prepared to step into
[53:28] your shoes
[53:29] he says stand in front of the
[53:30] congregation and do that so that they
[53:32] know that you've endorsed this
[53:33] and because you've endorsed it they know
[53:35] that i've endorsed it because you'll
[53:36] never do something like this unless i
[53:37] tell you to do it in the first place
[53:39] amen they trust that moses is god
[53:40] speaking remember when god called moses
[53:42] he says you will be god to them and
[53:44] aaron will be their prophet
[53:45] so when moses is standing there that's
[53:47] god that's god laying his hands and
[53:49] saying this is going to be the next one
[53:50] to lead the children of israel amen
[53:52] god wasn't going to leave them without
[53:53] proper leadership in other words
[53:56] verse 21 says and he shall stand before
[53:58] eliza are the priests
[53:59] who shall ask counsel for him after the
[54:01] judgment of
[54:02] yurim before the lord at his word shall
[54:05] they go out and at his word shall they
[54:06] come in
[54:07] both he and all the children of israel
[54:09] with him even all the
[54:11] congregation now this going out and
[54:12] coming in is a reference to proper
[54:15] leadership in israel because what would
[54:16] happen
[54:17] is he would go in to the tabernacle to
[54:20] seek the will of god
[54:21] and then he would come out to lead the
[54:23] people into battle
[54:24] amen so he had to go in and say lord
[54:26] what is your will and then he had to
[54:27] come out and tell the people
[54:29] this is god's will and if he came out
[54:31] and they were defeated
[54:32] then that meant that he had missed the
[54:33] will of the lord and if he kept doing
[54:35] that pretty soon he wasn't allowed to go
[54:37] in
[54:37] because he wasn't going to be allowed to
[54:38] come out and lead them amen the proof
[54:40] was in the pudding that if he found the
[54:42] will of the god they would have victory
[54:43] they would have discernment they would
[54:45] have the things that they needed they
[54:46] would find the will in the path of god
[54:48] and they would be victorious every day
[54:49] of their life
[54:50] so he had to go in and find the will and
[54:52] then come out and bring the people to
[54:53] god's perfect will
[54:55] and if he failed then the people
[54:56] wouldn't allow him to do it anymore and
[54:58] then we see that with david
[54:59] it says when david was made a captain
[55:01] remember he was made general
[55:02] and then he was reduced to a captain and
[55:04] he went out he went in and came out
[55:06] before the people
[55:07] and he found favor with the people
[55:08] because every time that david went out
[55:10] after coming into the presence of god
[55:12] he always found victory amen and so this
[55:14] is what joshua's saying
[55:15] but you notice here he says he'll stand
[55:17] before eliza are the priests joshua's
[55:18] got a conduit right now
[55:20] there's a priest standing between him
[55:21] the priest is supposed to inquire on the
[55:23] urim thumb and
[55:24] as to what is the will of god do we do
[55:25] this or do we do that so we see he even
[55:27] hear a transition for joshua that he
[55:29] does not have the direct contact with
[55:30] god yet
[55:31] amen there's still a barrier there's a
[55:32] priesthood between him why because god
[55:34] is still with moses
[55:36] right he's got to go through somebody
[55:37] else but now when that transition is
[55:39] full
[55:39] you'll see god now step from moses to
[55:41] dealing directly with joshua
[55:43] and then you see that transition happen
[55:46] 22 it says and moses did as the lord
[55:48] commanded him and he took joshua
[55:49] and set him before eliza the priest and
[55:51] before all the congregation
[55:53] and he laid his hands upon him and gave
[55:54] him a charge as the lord commanded
[55:57] by the hand of israel amen so this is
[55:59] joshua's calling now he knows that he is
[56:01] going to be the next leader of israel
[56:03] but he knows it but he hasn't
[56:04] experienced it i want to draw a
[56:06] distinction there because
[56:07] you can know what you're supposed to do
[56:08] but until god puts you in the place to
[56:10] do it
[56:11] you're not supposed to try and do it can
[56:13] you imagine the confusion that would
[56:14] have happened if joshua went out and
[56:15] tried to lead the people before moses
[56:17] had been called away
[56:18] right now you'd have two people vying
[56:20] for the same position vying for the same
[56:22] influence in the group you can't have
[56:23] that happen right one man's in charge
[56:25] one man's waiting in the wings to step
[56:27] in but until one is out the other one
[56:28] never steps in
[56:30] amen you'll see that whether it's in a
[56:31] regular church today a pastor with an
[56:33] assistant pastor
[56:34] you can't have those two men vying for
[56:36] the same position amen you've got one
[56:38] man's anointed for it and one man may be
[56:40] getting ready for it but he's not
[56:41] anointed in that position yet and god
[56:42] won't anoint him for that position
[56:44] until that other one is stepped aside
[56:46] amen and you'll see that through all the
[56:48] different gifts in the body
[56:49] amen we've got song leaders we've got
[56:50] these different positions there is a
[56:52] major anointing on the one and then
[56:54] there is a minor anointing there's a
[56:55] preparing anointing
[56:56] if i could put it that way to get that
[56:58] next one ready and you'll never have
[56:59] conflict when god's working
[57:01] because the anointing will only lead
[57:02] that one amen the second one is waiting
[57:04] to be anointed and appointed to that
[57:06] position
[57:07] amen you'll see it even with jesus amen
[57:10] jesus said at the age of 12 he says
[57:12] i must be about my father's business at
[57:13] the age of 12 and it's not until the age
[57:15] of 30 that the holy spirit drops down
[57:17] upon him
[57:18] and he is now appointed and anointed for
[57:20] his work
[57:21] amen you can know it but that doesn't
[57:22] mean that you are yet ready for it and
[57:24] it doesn't mean you should start to try
[57:25] and do it on your own that's for sure
[57:27] amen now so we know after this moses
[57:29] goes up on the mountain he looks across
[57:31] god takes them away and now joshua
[57:33] becomes the man to lead the israelites
[57:34] now we've covered joshua's his
[57:37] commission but i want to read it again
[57:39] just so we can see what god told him to
[57:41] do just for the sake of com
[57:42] completion here this morning but this is
[57:44] where joshua's stepping in now he's not
[57:46] just appointed
[57:47] but now he's anointed god's saying now
[57:49] is your time now is your place
[57:51] it's time for us to step over and it's
[57:53] time for you to start moving into what
[57:54] i've called you to be
[57:55] amen so turn to joshua chapter one if
[57:57] you would i'll put it up here but just
[57:59] to have it in your scriptures because
[58:00] we're gonna be here for a little bit
[58:05] amen joshua chapter one now this is
[58:07] joshua's vocation if we could call it
[58:09] that way
[58:09] this is his life's calling this is
[58:11] joshua's purpose now coming
[58:13] to the forefront this is this is the day
[58:15] amen this is the day that joshua's gonna
[58:17] step in
[58:18] to everything that god has prepared him
[58:20] for up to this point
[58:22] joshua 1 1 says now after the death of
[58:24] moses the servant of the lord it came to
[58:25] pass
[58:26] that the lord spake unto joshua the son
[58:28] of nun moses minister
[58:29] saying moses my servant is dead now
[58:32] therefore arise go
[58:34] over this jordan thou and all this
[58:36] people unto the lamb which i do give to
[58:38] them
[58:38] even to the children of israel this is
[58:40] phase one cross over jordan
[58:42] every place that the soul of your foot
[58:44] shall tread that have i given unto you
[58:46] as i said to moses notice he gives the
[58:48] command and then he gives the benefit
[58:50] he says go over and as soon as you're
[58:52] over everywhere that your foot treads
[58:54] belongs to you
[58:56] amen verse 4 from the wilderness and
[58:58] this level lebanon even unto the great
[59:00] river
[59:00] the river euphrates all the land of the
[59:02] hittites and unto the great sea toward
[59:04] the going down of the sun shall be your
[59:06] coast
[59:06] so he says these are your borders and
[59:08] this is what you're supposed to go do
[59:11] amen this is phase two conquer every
[59:12] city and kingdom within the borders that
[59:14] god has laid out
[59:15] there shall not be any man be able to
[59:17] stand before thee all the days of thy
[59:19] life
[59:20] as i was with moses so i will be with
[59:22] thee i will not fail me nor forsake thee
[59:25] again this is your border go in and take
[59:27] it and here's the promise no one's going
[59:28] to be able to stand before you within
[59:30] those borders
[59:31] be strong and of a good courage for
[59:33] under this people
[59:34] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[59:36] land which i swear unto their fathers to
[59:38] give them
[59:39] again what is he supposed to do once
[59:40] you've conquered it divided up amongst
[59:42] the people
[59:42] as you're supposed to again only be thou
[59:45] strong
[59:46] and very courageous that thou mayest
[59:47] observe to do all according to all the
[59:50] law
[59:50] which moses my servant commanded thee
[59:52] turn not from it to the right hand nor
[59:54] to the left
[59:55] that thou mayest prom prosper wither so
[59:58] ever thou goes
[59:59] this is how you conquer he says stay
[1:00:01] with the word stay with the law that
[1:00:02] i've given moses don't go to the left
[1:00:04] don't go to the right
[1:00:05] don't deviate stay 100 with what i told
[1:00:07] you through moses
[1:00:08] and you'll be okay the book of the law
[1:00:11] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:00:13] amen you have to speak it thou shalt
[1:00:15] meditate there in day and night you have
[1:00:17] to dwell on it you have to think about
[1:00:18] it
[1:00:19] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:00:21] to all that is written there
[1:00:22] so you speak it and you think on it in
[1:00:24] order to do it
[1:00:25] amen for then after you've done that
[1:00:28] thou shalt make thy way
[1:00:29] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[1:00:32] success amen the word can't be usurped
[1:00:34] and if the word is never usurped if it's
[1:00:36] never if the preeminence is never given
[1:00:38] to anything but the word then you can
[1:00:39] only be victorious is what he's saying
[1:00:41] here
[1:00:42] amen so what we see here is god has laid
[1:00:43] out a complete path to success for
[1:00:45] joshua
[1:00:46] he's told him where to go he's told him
[1:00:47] what belongs to him he's told him that
[1:00:49] nobody can stand before you
[1:00:50] he's told him how to make sure he's
[1:00:52] walking in the will of god amen
[1:00:54] god's given him a full pathway to
[1:00:55] success and god doesn't take a believer
[1:00:57] and just drop them in the middle of a
[1:00:58] pack of lines and say defeat the lions
[1:01:00] he gives us a pathway he gives us a word
[1:01:03] he gives us a message he gives us a way
[1:01:04] of doing things
[1:01:05] and then he says stay with that and
[1:01:07] you're going to be successful but i've
[1:01:09] told you how to do it so you're not
[1:01:10] allowed to deviate now amen god doesn't
[1:01:12] wink at ignorance in this age
[1:01:13] we're looking at a seventh church age
[1:01:15] here everything is open that we need to
[1:01:17] do to go on a rapture amen
[1:01:18] we have every word that we need we have
[1:01:20] every truth we have every anointing
[1:01:22] we have every promise that is required
[1:01:24] right here and all he's saying is don't
[1:01:26] deviate from it i've told you how to do
[1:01:28] it
[1:01:28] i'm training you i'm preparing you but
[1:01:30] stick with the word and you'll make it
[1:01:31] all the way through to the end
[1:01:33] and you'll be able to fulfill what i've
[1:01:34] called you to do in your life amen
[1:01:36] amen what is it god calls us out and
[1:01:39] then he trains us
[1:01:40] and he prepares us and he molds us and
[1:01:42] he shapes us to get us in the condition
[1:01:44] where we can do what he has called us to
[1:01:45] do
[1:01:46] and that is what is going to be a worthy
[1:01:48] life amen is to do what god has called
[1:01:49] you to do
[1:01:50] in your day amen and i can only speak
[1:01:52] for myself
[1:01:53] is that he never stops training he never
[1:01:55] stops molding he never stops beating the
[1:01:57] dross out as the scripture talks about
[1:01:59] he never stops refining our character
[1:02:02] refining the way we look at things we're
[1:02:03] finding the filter that we have
[1:02:05] to draw us closer and closer to him and
[1:02:07] i see our pastor nodding back there and
[1:02:09] if he's nodding that means he's still
[1:02:10] doing it with him too amen
[1:02:11] that is a constant work a man of
[1:02:14] sanctification that god is doing in our
[1:02:15] lives to draw us away from the world
[1:02:17] and a constant working inside of us to
[1:02:19] make the world more and more of a
[1:02:21] preeminence
[1:02:22] until we come to that stature of a
[1:02:23] perfect man or woman in christ amen
[1:02:26] amen then when he's got us to the place
[1:02:29] where we can start
[1:02:30] because remember he prepared joshua
[1:02:32] joshua went through many trials many
[1:02:33] tribulations many situations
[1:02:35] and that was just training to get him to
[1:02:37] this point and when god determines
[1:02:38] you're ready to start
[1:02:40] your tr your job then that's when we
[1:02:42] kick off amen that's not the start he's
[1:02:44] been training you all along the holy
[1:02:45] spirit's been a tutor the holy spirit's
[1:02:47] been working in your life sons of god
[1:02:48] and
[1:02:49] daughters of god are led by god to bring
[1:02:51] them to that place but there comes a
[1:02:52] point
[1:02:52] brother brahm says that's adoption where
[1:02:54] he says all right now it's time for you
[1:02:55] to do something for me
[1:02:57] i've done all of this for a purpose now
[1:02:58] it's time for you to step out
[1:03:00] and do what i've really called you to do
[1:03:01] in this time and in this age
[1:03:03] brother braham says this for instance
[1:03:05] there was a man in the bible by the name
[1:03:07] of moses who had got all of his training
[1:03:09] he knowed all the theology amen can we
[1:03:11] say that we have that probably today
[1:03:13] do we have all of the theology we've had
[1:03:16] an open book before since 1963 when the
[1:03:19] seven seals were opened brother brown
[1:03:20] said this became a new book it became an
[1:03:22] open book
[1:03:23] we have all of the theology we could
[1:03:24] ever ask for amen
[1:03:26] and we've had it up to it it's coming
[1:03:28] out of our years we have so much
[1:03:29] theology we have
[1:03:30] doctrine we have truth in the in terms
[1:03:32] of the letter amen and
[1:03:33] with this message we have everything we
[1:03:35] need in terms of theology
[1:03:37] he says he knew everything that he
[1:03:39] should know now i believe there's
[1:03:41] greater revelation coming but in terms
[1:03:43] of knowledge i believe
[1:03:44] it's pretty much there for us we're
[1:03:45] looking for revelation now to make it a
[1:03:47] reality
[1:03:48] even if he would have needed any
[1:03:50] education he could teach the masters in
[1:03:52] israel or in egypt
[1:03:54] he didn't need one thing and the bible
[1:03:55] tells us he was learned in all the
[1:03:57] wisdom of the egyptians
[1:03:58] why he could teach their scholars he
[1:04:00] could teach their scientists things he
[1:04:02] was key to the very point when it came
[1:04:04] to intellectual
[1:04:05] but yet it taken god 40 years to beat
[1:04:08] all of that out of him
[1:04:09] out there in the saiyans and when he got
[1:04:11] all of his intellectual conceptions of
[1:04:13] god beat out of him
[1:04:15] out there in the sands the metal was
[1:04:17] ready to be molded over
[1:04:18] now i'm not for a minute saying that
[1:04:20] god's going to beat out all the theology
[1:04:21] of the message
[1:04:22] amen but what he's going to do is he's
[1:04:24] going to take it out of our conception
[1:04:26] and he's going to bring it now in his
[1:04:28] reality amen because so often what's
[1:04:30] holding us back is that we're expecting
[1:04:31] god to do things in a certain way
[1:04:33] and god's ways are not our ways amen we
[1:04:35] might have the holy ghost but god's
[1:04:37] thinking is way different than our
[1:04:39] thinking amen
[1:04:40] i mean look at me where i'm standing
[1:04:42] today how many would have said that's
[1:04:44] the way to go
[1:04:45] how many would have said john you should
[1:04:46] leave for 16 years go all around north
[1:04:49] america in multiple churches with
[1:04:51] multiple pastors
[1:04:52] multiple situations some good some not
[1:04:54] so good and then come back to
[1:04:56] newfoundland why not just stay here
[1:04:58] why not make it simple that would have
[1:04:59] been really simple wouldn't it but
[1:05:01] that's not god's way of training a man
[1:05:03] and we'll see later on what brother bram
[1:05:05] has to say about it actually we'll see
[1:05:06] in this next scripture
[1:05:07] he says that's the way god takes his men
[1:05:09] and beats out all their fears
[1:05:11] all of their intellectuals and then the
[1:05:13] great master potter puts them on the
[1:05:15] wheel
[1:05:16] and begins to mold them over again
[1:05:19] workmen worthy it's god's man then who
[1:05:22] could train a man more than god himself
[1:05:25] he says watch the way he trains them god
[1:05:28] has to get a man away from the things of
[1:05:30] the world so he can get him quiet
[1:05:32] so he can listen to god that still small
[1:05:35] voice then
[1:05:36] once in contact with god he becomes
[1:05:39] fearless then
[1:05:40] notice that he don't care what anyone
[1:05:42] says he's been in the presence of god
[1:05:45] he knows god in the power of his
[1:05:47] resurrection
[1:05:48] amen that's one thing i can testify
[1:05:50] myself is i don't care what people say
[1:05:52] now that i've been in the presence of
[1:05:54] god amen why because he has laid his
[1:05:56] calling he has laid his anointing on me
[1:05:58] to do what i'm doing
[1:05:59] and i don't care if somebody thinks i
[1:06:00] have a gift or doesn't think i have a
[1:06:02] gift
[1:06:02] if i'm where i'm supposed to be or where
[1:06:04] i'm not supposed to be i don't care what
[1:06:05] people think about my past i don't care
[1:06:07] what people think about my future
[1:06:08] because i am consumed by what he has
[1:06:10] anointed me to do and what he has called
[1:06:12] me to do and that is my focus amen
[1:06:15] moses didn't walk down and people walk
[1:06:17] looking at them with a walking stick
[1:06:18] saying moses how are you going to do it
[1:06:20] with this stick are you kidding me have
[1:06:22] you seen the swords they come out with
[1:06:23] this year have you seen the 2021 sores
[1:06:25] that the egyptians have and you're going
[1:06:27] up with a stick
[1:06:28] moses wasn't looking at that he was what
[1:06:29] commissioned to go and deliver them and
[1:06:31] he had god's judgment in his hand
[1:06:33] that's all that mattered to him amen now
[1:06:36] you might say well that's moses
[1:06:38] amen we've talked about this before
[1:06:39] that's joshua you know we're talking
[1:06:41] about the greats of the bible we're
[1:06:43] talking about
[1:06:43] i mean moses the only one greater than
[1:06:45] him was john the baptist the scripture
[1:06:46] says
[1:06:47] except for christ himself moses was the
[1:06:49] greatest prophet in fact
[1:06:50] he's the one that christ is compared to
[1:06:52] he'll raise up a prophet like unto
[1:06:55] right that's how great a prophet moses
[1:06:57] was we say well that's a great man
[1:06:58] that's a great woman you know we look at
[1:07:00] these heroes of the faith and say well
[1:07:02] yes god had to do something special with
[1:07:03] them
[1:07:04] listen we're about to go in a rapture
[1:07:06] folks god's going to have to do
[1:07:07] something special with you and you're
[1:07:08] pretty special
[1:07:09] if he's called you to do what's only
[1:07:11] happened a couple times in history
[1:07:13] amen so the same thing that he these
[1:07:15] people went through is the same thing
[1:07:16] god's got to put us through amen
[1:07:18] he's got to prepare us to do his work
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:21] brother braham says this god trains his
[1:07:23] men trains his men
[1:07:25] then anoints them gives them experience
[1:07:28] takes them through the rigid training
[1:07:30] down through the sands of burning
[1:07:32] punishment trying and testing
[1:07:35] amen how many of us have signed up for
[1:07:37] that willingly
[1:07:38] but that's the way god prepares his
[1:07:40] people amen is he does
[1:07:42] what he he trains them then he anoints
[1:07:44] them puts them through experience
[1:07:46] through this burning sands of punishment
[1:07:48] amen amen what is he doing he's getting
[1:07:50] you to the point where you'll obey him
[1:07:51] every single time
[1:07:52] when he says it amen he's getting you
[1:07:54] ready to to not look to the left or the
[1:07:56] right you've got
[1:07:57] blinders on and all you can see is the
[1:07:59] word ahead of you and what god has
[1:08:00] called you to do amen
[1:08:02] he says not only does he do that to his
[1:08:04] prophets but he does it to his children
[1:08:07] okay we're all children
[1:08:10] we've only got two potential prophets
[1:08:11] here and that's myself and brother
[1:08:12] gerald as ministers brother braham said
[1:08:14] that's your modern day prophet amen
[1:08:16] but the rest of us are we're all
[1:08:17] children amen so this everything he says
[1:08:19] here
[1:08:20] applies to us every single person in
[1:08:22] this room amen
[1:08:24] every son that cometh to god must be
[1:08:26] chastened and tried
[1:08:27] tested by his word see when the pinch
[1:08:30] comes
[1:08:30] the strong time when it faces death are
[1:08:33] you able to stand there on the word of
[1:08:35] god and say god said so that settles it
[1:08:38] amen you've got to come to the place
[1:08:40] where you're resting on the word and the
[1:08:41] word alone
[1:08:42] and brother branham points us to hebrew
[1:08:44] 12 and we'll read it really quickly
[1:08:45] because it sets us up for this topic
[1:08:47] beautifully
[1:08:48] about what it means to have a worthy
[1:08:49] life but you've got to go through the
[1:08:51] training before you can step into that
[1:08:52] portion of your life that's worthwhile
[1:08:54] hebrews 12 5 says and ye have forgotten
[1:08:57] the exhortation which speaketh unto you
[1:08:58] as unto children
[1:09:00] my son despise not thou the chastening
[1:09:02] of the lord no faith nor faint when thou
[1:09:04] art rebuked of him
[1:09:06] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:09:08] and scourgeth every sum
[1:09:10] whom he receiveth if ye endure
[1:09:12] chastening god dealer with you as
[1:09:14] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:09:16] chasteneth not
[1:09:18] amen every father in here has spanked or
[1:09:19] disciplined their child at some point
[1:09:22] but we don't go around spanking
[1:09:23] disciplining other kids do we
[1:09:26] but if he be without chastisement we're
[1:09:28] of all our partakers in other words
[1:09:30] everyone gets chastisement from god if
[1:09:32] they're a son or daughter of god
[1:09:34] then are ye bastards and not sons so
[1:09:36] it's that simple if your life is
[1:09:38] untouched by the hand of god if it's all
[1:09:39] a life of ease and pleasure and luxury
[1:09:42] guess what god ain't dealing with you as
[1:09:44] a son or daughter of god it's that
[1:09:45] simple
[1:09:45] so when we look and we're calling for
[1:09:47] god to put those things into our life
[1:09:48] what we're asking him to do is duck out
[1:09:50] from chastising us from correcting us
[1:09:52] from training us amen
[1:09:53] he's going to use what he needs to get
[1:09:55] us to the place that he wants us to be
[1:09:58] he said furthermore we have had fathers
[1:09:59] of our flesh which corrected us and we
[1:10:01] gave them reverence
[1:10:02] shall we not much rather be in
[1:10:04] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:10:06] and live
[1:10:07] for they barely for a few days chastened
[1:10:09] us after their own pleasure
[1:10:10] in other words we had leadership he says
[1:10:13] and they gave us a hard time they
[1:10:14] chastened us they did things to us that
[1:10:16] didn't feel very good
[1:10:17] he says they did it for their pleasure
[1:10:19] but he
[1:10:20] which is god our father he does it for
[1:10:23] our prophet that we might be partakers
[1:10:25] of his holiness
[1:10:26] so he does it with purpose amen he's got
[1:10:27] a reason for what he's doing it says now
[1:10:30] no chastening for the presence seemeth
[1:10:32] to be joyous but grievous
[1:10:33] nevertheless afterward it yielded the
[1:10:36] peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:10:38] unto them which are exercised thereby
[1:10:40] like i said god's chastising is
[1:10:42] purposeful his training is purposeful
[1:10:44] and though it's difficult
[1:10:45] it comes out and it always has an effect
[1:10:47] amen and if it doesn't have an effect
[1:10:49] he'll put you through it again
[1:10:50] and again and again until the effect is
[1:10:52] there because if we resist
[1:10:54] so much often what happens is we he
[1:10:56] backs off he says okay
[1:10:58] you don't want to do this we won't do it
[1:11:00] we'll let you go back to the way you
[1:11:01] were doing things for a little while
[1:11:02] until you start asking me until you
[1:11:04] start crying out until you get desperate
[1:11:06] and say god
[1:11:07] this is more than i want i'd rather do
[1:11:09] it your way than sit here and do things
[1:11:10] my way amen
[1:11:12] amen amen like i said before god doesn't
[1:11:14] just throw us to the wolves he works on
[1:11:16] us and he works on us and he works on us
[1:11:18] until we get to that place where we can
[1:11:19] be of use where he can trust us amen
[1:11:22] and the thing is we're not here to
[1:11:23] reflect a christ of 2000 years ago
[1:11:25] i mean that's sort of that's where
[1:11:26] denominations get in trouble these days
[1:11:28] is they're looking to a christ of 2000
[1:11:30] years ago
[1:11:30] and saying let's be like that and the
[1:11:31] word has moved on from 2000 years ago
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:35] what we do is we have people that sit
[1:11:36] there and say i want to be the christ
[1:11:37] that was revealed in
[1:11:39] but guess what the word has moved on
[1:11:41] since 1963. the word says if
[1:11:43] our pastor said it the other day if we
[1:11:45] walk in the light walking means you're
[1:11:47] moving
[1:11:48] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:11:50] light amen then we have fellowship with
[1:11:51] him and the blood of jesus cleanses us
[1:11:53] from all our sins
[1:11:54] that word is continually moving the word
[1:11:56] was opened in 1963
[1:11:57] but it's taking decades and decades and
[1:11:59] decades for men to dig into that and
[1:12:01] pull out everything that's in there
[1:12:02] and the prophet said i only hit the
[1:12:04] highlights right so what's happening is
[1:12:06] that five full ministries digging into
[1:12:08] it
[1:12:08] and they're pulling the people up in
[1:12:10] faith i was listening to brother jason
[1:12:11] demars the other day
[1:12:12] and we'll get into this when we start
[1:12:14] when we minister on the five full
[1:12:15] ministry lord willing
[1:12:16] but he says he he it talks about that
[1:12:19] perfecting of the saints he says it is
[1:12:21] not perfectionism maturity
[1:12:22] he said it is preparation as in the
[1:12:25] five-fold ministry is preparing
[1:12:27] the people for what the rapture
[1:12:31] we don't mature you we give you what you
[1:12:33] need to mature we give you what it takes
[1:12:35] to please god
[1:12:36] and then god comes down he blesses it
[1:12:37] because it's his word for the hour
[1:12:39] and it's what prepares you amen but
[1:12:41] there is a maturing process but that
[1:12:43] word is not the mature that we're used
[1:12:44] to that perfection we're used to
[1:12:46] but rather it's a preparation of the
[1:12:47] people we'll give you the tools we'll
[1:12:49] give you exactly what's needed for your
[1:12:50] day to get you ready to meet the
[1:12:52] challenge of the hour
[1:12:53] amen amen so we want to reflect the
[1:12:56] christ for our day amen
[1:12:58] amen now we've spent 10 services talking
[1:12:59] about joshua's deeds
[1:13:01] but now we want to go to the end of it
[1:13:03] all amen to see what it looks like and
[1:13:04] we read this at the beginning of the
[1:13:05] service
[1:13:06] joshua 11 verse 15 says as the lord
[1:13:09] commanded moses his servant so did moses
[1:13:11] command joshua
[1:13:12] and so did joshua he left nothing undone
[1:13:15] that all of the lord commanded moses
[1:13:17] i mean if there's one thing that i would
[1:13:18] like to say at the end of this life it's
[1:13:20] to have a scripture written about me
[1:13:21] this way amen that god would say
[1:13:23] he did he left nothing undone that was
[1:13:25] commanded to him
[1:13:27] amen that you would walk to the end and
[1:13:28] he would say well done thou good and
[1:13:30] faithful servant enter into the joys
[1:13:32] of thy lord amen that we would be able
[1:13:34] to say lord i've left nothing undone
[1:13:36] that you've called me to do everything
[1:13:38] that you've asked i've done it
[1:13:39] and i've not just done it but i've done
[1:13:41] it the way you told me with whom you
[1:13:42] told me to do it when you told me to do
[1:13:44] it amen
[1:13:45] amen that would be grace amen that would
[1:13:47] be grace to us if we could do it
[1:13:49] but joshua is commended here he's noted
[1:13:51] for leaving nothing undone he has con he
[1:13:53] has finished the work that god gave him
[1:13:55] to do amen amen
[1:13:56] amen does joshua perfect no but it
[1:14:00] doesn't note it here does it
[1:14:02] it doesn't notice imperfections amen
[1:14:04] when you go to the faith chapter in
[1:14:05] hebrews
[1:14:05] it doesn't note their failures it notes
[1:14:07] that they did in the end what god
[1:14:09] called them to do amen and that's where
[1:14:11] i want my place to be is that he looks
[1:14:12] past the failure and says in the end he
[1:14:14] still got there
[1:14:15] amen by my grace by my strength by the
[1:14:17] power of my spirit he still got there
[1:14:19] and he finished the work that i put him
[1:14:20] on earth to do amen
[1:14:23] amen joshua paid a price and the
[1:14:25] children of israel paid a price every
[1:14:26] time he failed but yet in the end
[1:14:28] he finished the work that god had called
[1:14:29] him to do verse 16 says so joshua took
[1:14:32] all that land the hills
[1:14:34] all the south country the land of goshen
[1:14:36] and the valley and the plain and the
[1:14:37] mountain of israel and the valley of the
[1:14:39] same
[1:14:40] even from the mount halak that goeth up
[1:14:42] to seer even under belgaud in the valley
[1:14:44] of lebanon
[1:14:45] under mount hermon and all their kings
[1:14:47] he took and smote them
[1:14:48] and slew them amen let me put it this
[1:14:50] way joshua beat everyone
[1:14:52] everywhere every time amen there was
[1:14:54] nobody that could stand before
[1:14:56] them it didn't matter what type of
[1:14:57] terrain they had it didn't matter what
[1:14:58] kind of weapons they had if they had
[1:14:59] horses and chariots if they had the
[1:15:01] world's longest spears or strongest bows
[1:15:03] it didn't matter what he faced
[1:15:05] everywhere that he went he was able to
[1:15:07] defeat the enemy amen
[1:15:08] amen amen that's a type for us is that
[1:15:10] every time we go in
[1:15:11] no matter what we're facing if we've
[1:15:13] never faced it before if we've never had
[1:15:15] a victory there before
[1:15:16] yet god is there to give us that victory
[1:15:18] amen we saw a prophet coming this day
[1:15:20] and it didn't matter what stood before
[1:15:22] him
[1:15:22] everything had to bow at the name of
[1:15:24] jesus christ amen
[1:15:25] how many times how many times did
[1:15:28] something come up
[1:15:29] and he would rebuke that in the name of
[1:15:30] jesus christ and in that instant they
[1:15:32] were healed
[1:15:33] amen we saw every we saw limbs
[1:15:35] lengthened
[1:15:36] and then in india there was a there was
[1:15:37] a young one there that had his leg
[1:15:39] lengthened
[1:15:40] in front of everybody we saw eyeballs
[1:15:42] created in eye sockets
[1:15:44] amen we saw cancers go away
[1:15:47] instantly we saw goiters drop off
[1:15:50] amen we saw the lame heal we saw the
[1:15:53] death here we saw the dumb speak
[1:15:55] amen we saw cancer heal we saw arthritis
[1:15:57] healed we saw
[1:15:58] everything that you could ever imagine
[1:16:00] every enemy that you could imagine
[1:16:01] female trouble nervousness all of these
[1:16:05] things
[1:16:06] complexes how many times do they come up
[1:16:08] and they're coming up for a physical
[1:16:09] need and brother branham goes to what
[1:16:11] an emotional need right and says this is
[1:16:13] another issue you got to deal with here
[1:16:15] but by his stripes you are healed amen
[1:16:17] in the name of jesus christ you are
[1:16:18] healed
[1:16:19] what is it no matter what came up no
[1:16:21] matter the terrain no matter the country
[1:16:23] no matter the level of unbelief yet when
[1:16:24] that angel was there nothing could stand
[1:16:26] before him amen amen
[1:16:29] if it is with him then who how is it
[1:16:30] with us we'll see what happens here amen
[1:16:34] i'm going to read this quote and this is
[1:16:35] a very well-known quote nobody reads the
[1:16:38] second half and we're going to read that
[1:16:39] in a later series because it's
[1:16:40] absolutely incredible
[1:16:41] but i want to share that a little bit
[1:16:42] later but just listen to this
[1:16:44] speaking of beating the enemy everywhere
[1:16:48] every time amen brother braham says this
[1:16:50] and expectations and the word of god
[1:16:52] will defeat satan
[1:16:53] any place any time anywhere
[1:16:56] and on any condition that's what joshua
[1:16:59] faced
[1:17:00] everything everywhere and he defeated
[1:17:03] every single one of them why
[1:17:04] because the word of god was in his mouth
[1:17:06] it was in his mind and he was walking
[1:17:07] according to what god had said
[1:17:09] he says that's right that's what it is
[1:17:11] it's god's word heaven
[1:17:12] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:17:14] will never fail he says believe it
[1:17:16] look at joshua if there's somebody that
[1:17:18] stretched his commission to the limit
[1:17:20] it was joshua as we read last time this
[1:17:22] is the only man ever
[1:17:24] to call on the sun and the moon to stand
[1:17:26] still and it stood still for almost a
[1:17:27] day
[1:17:28] you talk about stretching your
[1:17:29] commission he's he took it to the max
[1:17:31] there's nobody's ever called on
[1:17:33] something like that to happen
[1:17:34] amen and no matter what happened he
[1:17:37] pulled on it he pulled and he pulled and
[1:17:38] he said lord this is what you've called
[1:17:40] me to do
[1:17:40] and then he do it and he'd do it and
[1:17:42] he'd do it and he do it and he did it
[1:17:44] for 10 long years
[1:17:45] and then he never slacked off he never
[1:17:47] took his foot off the gas it was just go
[1:17:49] go go go and he's under man he's under
[1:17:52] trained
[1:17:52] in terms of car you know speaking
[1:17:54] currently he doesn't have the type of
[1:17:56] weapons he doesn't have the kind of
[1:17:57] technology
[1:17:58] that the people they're facing right
[1:18:00] he's never taken a fortress before he
[1:18:01] comes over here
[1:18:03] and yet he goes through here and he just
[1:18:04] wipes everybody out why
[1:18:06] because he believed this the word of god
[1:18:08] will defeat them where
[1:18:09] any place anytime anywhere and on any
[1:18:12] condition amen
[1:18:13] amen with joshua he had no fallbacks
[1:18:16] when they crossed the river jordan they
[1:18:18] didn't have food stores the mana stopped
[1:18:20] falling quickly
[1:18:22] they had to defeat in order to eat all
[1:18:24] right in order to keep going they had to
[1:18:26] defeat they had to have victory in the
[1:18:28] camp amen
[1:18:28] god's pulled back on that blessing why
[1:18:30] because he's training the people
[1:18:32] for a time where he's not going to hand
[1:18:33] feed them all the time and then he's
[1:18:35] training them to
[1:18:36] to do what step into the word step
[1:18:38] forward in faith and take what he's
[1:18:39] promised
[1:18:40] and not just rely on him to do
[1:18:41] everything supernaturally now but to
[1:18:43] take what he's given them and let that
[1:18:44] feed them amen
[1:18:46] amen but listen to what he says now
[1:18:49] verse 18. joshua made war
[1:18:53] a long time with all those kings amen
[1:18:56] how many of us have signed up for a long
[1:18:58] war
[1:19:00] amen it's not a sprint we sometimes we
[1:19:02] think well once i finish this one once
[1:19:04] this battle's over then i'll get a break
[1:19:06] guess what
[1:19:06] there's another fortress there's another
[1:19:08] army there's another weapon waiting for
[1:19:10] you over the hill
[1:19:11] amen it's going to be one after the
[1:19:12] other after the other until we get out
[1:19:14] of here
[1:19:14] why because we've been called to be an
[1:19:16] overcomer amen you can't overcome
[1:19:17] without battles
[1:19:18] amen you've got to have a victory to be
[1:19:20] an overcomer and so these are just going
[1:19:21] to cycle through
[1:19:22] over and over again yeah you'll get a
[1:19:24] break you'll get a chance to heal up
[1:19:25] there's no doubt about it but god's
[1:19:27] going to keep pushing us and pushing us
[1:19:28] and pushing us through
[1:19:30] until we've got the victory over
[1:19:31] everything and then the last thing
[1:19:32] that's defeated is what
[1:19:33] death and hell amen the keys of the the
[1:19:35] keys are in his hands
[1:19:36] he's got the keys to death hell in the
[1:19:38] grave and so he just unlocks that up and
[1:19:40] we just walk out of here amen
[1:19:42] total victory for each and every one of
[1:19:43] us why isn't it all a supernatural
[1:19:46] instantaneous victory
[1:19:48] why can't we just have the supernatural
[1:19:49] doing everything every time
[1:19:51] why do we have to struggle why do we
[1:19:52] have to fight why do we have to wait
[1:19:54] why do we have to sit there and just
[1:19:55] look to god and say god why aren't
[1:19:57] things happening
[1:19:59] why isn't it that everything doesn't
[1:20:00] just happen like this why don't we just
[1:20:01] speak the word every time
[1:20:03] when a situation comes up why don't we
[1:20:05] speak the word and it happened then
[1:20:07] i'm not saying don't speak the word but
[1:20:08] i'm saying why is the effect of it not
[1:20:09] immediate every time
[1:20:13] it's because we're in a process amen and
[1:20:16] we've got two things happening and there
[1:20:17] they seem contradictory times is
[1:20:19] one is god is the same yesterday today
[1:20:21] and forever
[1:20:22] so he's here in our midst but he's got
[1:20:24] to prepare us and that means we've got
[1:20:25] to have character
[1:20:26] and character requires what battle and
[1:20:29] victory because brother brown said
[1:20:30] character is a victory
[1:20:31] you can't have that character without a
[1:20:33] battle so you've got god jesus christ
[1:20:34] the same yesterday today and forever but
[1:20:36] you got him preparing to bride at the
[1:20:38] same time
[1:20:38] and so he doesn't do everything when you
[1:20:40] want it but yet he uses it for its
[1:20:42] purpose
[1:20:43] scripture talks about what you put a bit
[1:20:45] in a horse's mouth
[1:20:46] and you make it do things and god does
[1:20:47] the same thing with our trials and
[1:20:48] temptations
[1:20:49] as he uses it to affect in our lives and
[1:20:51] it's for a supernatural effect it's for
[1:20:53] a kingdom effect
[1:20:54] and he's bringing us to a place where
[1:20:56] we're going to step off this earth
[1:20:57] without seeing
[1:20:58] death amen what's he doing is he's using
[1:21:00] those things to mold us and shape us
[1:21:02] amen how are you going to have faith if
[1:21:03] you never have to use it
[1:21:05] right if you never have to wait how are
[1:21:06] you going to have patience we look
[1:21:07] through all of this
[1:21:08] how are you going to have faith if
[1:21:09] everything comes immediately how are you
[1:21:11] going to have strength if you don't work
[1:21:13] strength comes by what you have to work
[1:21:15] it you have to exercise it discernment
[1:21:17] has to be exercised the scripture says
[1:21:19] so you're going to get strength by
[1:21:20] working against something that's maybe
[1:21:22] heavier than you can handle right now
[1:21:23] knowledge you have to learn hey man you
[1:21:25] have to groan at temperance
[1:21:27] it's got to be shaped when you temper
[1:21:28] something what happens is you take it
[1:21:30] and you
[1:21:31] if you're you're temporary metal then
[1:21:33] you've got to hold it at a certain
[1:21:34] temperature and then you've got to cool
[1:21:35] it at a certain rate to give it strength
[1:21:37] and then it's a process that has to
[1:21:38] happen patience how do you exhibit
[1:21:40] patients unless you're in a situation
[1:21:41] that would typically cause impatience
[1:21:44] i mean it's got to be exercise godliness
[1:21:46] a constant work of sanctification
[1:21:48] sanctification is not a one-day event
[1:21:49] amen this is happening every day
[1:21:51] brotherly kindness he puts you in a
[1:21:53] church where nobody's perfect
[1:21:55] right and all of a sudden your brotherly
[1:21:56] kindness has to be built up and then
[1:21:58] we're capped with what his love
[1:21:59] amen his life within us amen it's an
[1:22:02] entire process that's molding us and
[1:22:03] shaping us
[1:22:04] what to make us into what he wants us to
[1:22:06] be amen
[1:22:11] so often we're looking to the outside
[1:22:12] well i conquered this i conquered that i
[1:22:14] conquered this disease
[1:22:15] i conquered this demon i can't conquer
[1:22:17] this tormentor i conquer in this
[1:22:19] situation that but the victory that he's
[1:22:20] looking for is an internal one before
[1:22:22] there's ever an external one amen that
[1:22:24] means that there's got to be
[1:22:25] a bit of a delay between what we say and
[1:22:27] what happens amen
[1:22:29] now sometimes god does it supernaturally
[1:22:30] and that's his grace amen i remember
[1:22:32] blanking when she had gallbladder
[1:22:34] trouble
[1:22:34] and we were in dallas texas and brother
[1:22:36] joe adams was there amen and he called
[1:22:38] her up to pray for her
[1:22:39] he laid hands on her and he cast that
[1:22:40] thing out and she was literally
[1:22:41] instantaneously healed
[1:22:43] there are those moments we have those
[1:22:44] moments of instantaneous healing and
[1:22:46] that's just god being god
[1:22:47] amen but he otherwise used puts us
[1:22:49] through a process even the scripture
[1:22:51] says
[1:22:51] if you lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:22:53] recover amen doesn't say they'll be
[1:22:55] instantaneously healed it says they'll
[1:22:56] recover
[1:22:57] and then there's a process of time and
[1:22:58] that's the testing of our faith they
[1:23:00] mean it's the proving of your faith
[1:23:03] listen because we want it easy
[1:23:06] if we're honest we want it easy does
[1:23:09] anybody here want a difficult life
[1:23:11] in and of your your flesh certainly
[1:23:12] doesn't amen your mind doesn't want it
[1:23:15] amen but what is it is it is is that
[1:23:17] we've got to be able to look at those
[1:23:19] things through those filters
[1:23:20] and say this is god that's in it and
[1:23:22] then we've got to be able to rest in
[1:23:23] that because otherwise we're going to go
[1:23:24] back
[1:23:25] and we're going to say god's with us
[1:23:26] every time life is easy and guess what
[1:23:29] he can be there when it's easy but it's
[1:23:30] not his way of doing things but listen
[1:23:31] to what brother branham says here about
[1:23:33] that easy way of things
[1:23:34] when god's just always supernatural he's
[1:23:36] speaking of the children of israel when
[1:23:38] they're going through
[1:23:38] the desert he says now we find that
[1:23:40] they'd already seen these miracles
[1:23:42] look what was with them they had a
[1:23:44] smitten rock with them they could drink
[1:23:45] from it
[1:23:46] they had an everlasting fount of water
[1:23:48] in front of them after they complained
[1:23:49] granted but they had a fount of water
[1:23:51] just coming out
[1:23:52] without end okay they had all the water
[1:23:55] they needed
[1:23:56] he says they had a brass serpent with
[1:23:57] them for healing
[1:23:59] oh my they had a prophet with them that
[1:24:01] had the word of god wouldn't we love to
[1:24:03] have brother branham here today
[1:24:04] i would love to have brother branham
[1:24:05] here today i would much prefer to sit
[1:24:07] there and listen to the prophet and read
[1:24:08] his quotes
[1:24:09] amen i'd love to have him there
[1:24:13] over the prophet was a pillar of fire
[1:24:16] that was doing the leading and not one
[1:24:17] time had it ever failed them
[1:24:19] glory he says oh i feel like shouting
[1:24:21] wouldn't we love to have that here
[1:24:23] wouldn't you love to have the pillar of
[1:24:24] fire here leading us
[1:24:26] it'd be amazing wouldn't it it'd be
[1:24:28] absolutely tremendous for us to be able
[1:24:29] to look up and see the very
[1:24:31] uh representation of the presence of god
[1:24:33] in our midst day
[1:24:34] and night a cloud by day and a pillar
[1:24:37] fire by night and a prophet that every
[1:24:38] time he speaks whatever he says comes to
[1:24:40] pass
[1:24:41] we'd love it but that's the easy life
[1:24:45] amen that's the easy life he says look
[1:24:48] it hadn't failed god doesn't fail he
[1:24:51] cannot fail and remain god
[1:24:53] he's still god the smitten rock the
[1:24:54] brass serpent a prophet an atonement
[1:24:57] and sacrifice everything grace had
[1:24:58] provided for them already
[1:25:00] and after god had done all these things
[1:25:03] they were like a lot of people today
[1:25:05] they have to be babied around god
[1:25:07] doesn't want babies god wants men and
[1:25:10] women
[1:25:11] because when everything's provided you
[1:25:13] don't grow
[1:25:14] amen if all we do with samuel is give
[1:25:17] him everything he wants and never get
[1:25:18] him to learn
[1:25:19] and obey and grow and take
[1:25:21] responsibility for his actions
[1:25:22] he will always stay as a spoiled child
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:26] when everything is given to you you do
[1:25:27] not grow amen when he holds back
[1:25:30] what happens when you hold back from the
[1:25:31] body it leans up doesn't it
[1:25:33] starts to eat some of the fat that's
[1:25:34] grown on us amen when you start to work
[1:25:37] it it starts to strengthen itself
[1:25:38] and it's healthier if it's worked than
[1:25:40] if it's not
[1:25:41] and he says god's doing the same thing
[1:25:43] he doesn't want babies he wants men and
[1:25:44] women
[1:25:45] now this is we read this this isn't the
[1:25:47] same quote but he comments on the same
[1:25:49] guy he says i like old buddy robinson's
[1:25:50] testimony
[1:25:51] he said lord give me the backbone the
[1:25:53] size of a salon put plenty of knowledge
[1:25:54] in the gable end of my soul
[1:25:56] and let me fight the devil as long as i
[1:25:58] got one tooth left and then gum on him
[1:26:00] until i die
[1:26:01] right he's saying let me keep going at
[1:26:02] it he says that's what we need
[1:26:04] courage not a wishbone but a backbone a
[1:26:07] real spirit-filled heart
[1:26:09] filled with the holy ghost sanctified by
[1:26:11] the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:13] living in a life walking in the path of
[1:26:15] god keeping his commandments
[1:26:17] claiming every promise as your own
[1:26:19] property
[1:26:20] he says hallelujah i mean that's what we
[1:26:22] want to be able to say is lord
[1:26:24] let me surrender to the process let me
[1:26:26] accept the process
[1:26:27] because i like the results a lot more
[1:26:29] than if we do things my way
[1:26:31] amen brother branham says
[1:26:34] oh how that we need on this journey that
[1:26:36] we're in now to find a place of rest
[1:26:38] and to feast on the word of god so that
[1:26:40] it'll give us strength
[1:26:41] night after night go to the room and
[1:26:43] rest and come back the next morning
[1:26:45] fresh
[1:26:45] and eat more for there's a great journey
[1:26:47] and a great battle ahead for the church
[1:26:49] that's us i believe we've been children
[1:26:52] long enough
[1:26:53] amen can we say amen to that this
[1:26:55] morning have we been children long
[1:26:56] enough
[1:26:57] amen we've had the theology we've had
[1:26:59] the training we've had the truth we've
[1:27:00] had
[1:27:00] maybe the understanding but that's not
[1:27:02] enough to go into rapturing man we don't
[1:27:04] want to stay as children anymore
[1:27:07] he says god's going to turn his children
[1:27:09] in
[1:27:10] his church into manhood now and we
[1:27:12] played and frolicked his children but
[1:27:14] now we're going to have to put away
[1:27:16] childish things
[1:27:17] and take on manhood maturity i believe
[1:27:20] it was paul who said when i was a child
[1:27:22] i spake as a child
[1:27:23] because he thought as a child but it's
[1:27:25] time that we begin to think like
[1:27:27] men and women now for we've got to get
[1:27:29] down to business
[1:27:31] amen and we want to get down to business
[1:27:32] because we see situations in our lives
[1:27:34] and our families in our bodies
[1:27:36] in our church whatever it might be and
[1:27:38] we say this has been around long enough
[1:27:41] amen this has been in our situation
[1:27:43] we've been in this situation for long
[1:27:45] enough
[1:27:45] it's time for us to start moving into
[1:27:47] the promises of god it's time to start
[1:27:49] reading the title deed and saying
[1:27:51] this needs to be taken away and we need
[1:27:53] to take this back
[1:27:54] amen we need to kick things out and we
[1:27:56] need to add to us the things that he's
[1:27:58] promised to us amen
[1:27:59] amen so there's going to be battles
[1:28:00] there's going to be long drawn out
[1:28:02] fights
[1:28:02] there's going to be difficulties there's
[1:28:04] going to be trials and temptations amen
[1:28:06] sometimes it takes more strength to sit
[1:28:08] back and wait on god than it does to go
[1:28:09] into the battle
[1:28:10] i mean sometimes it takes more strength
[1:28:12] to just say lord it's in your hands
[1:28:15] right so many times we actually feel
[1:28:17] better because we're doing something but
[1:28:19] it's not always for us to do
[1:28:20] it's for us to believe and let him do it
[1:28:23] and then when he says move if he says
[1:28:25] move then we do it
[1:28:26] but we wait on the lord we wait on the
[1:28:28] lord and we talked about them going
[1:28:30] around jericho and for six days there
[1:28:32] was nothing happening
[1:28:33] and yet they were there in obedience
[1:28:34] amen that's the difficult thing
[1:28:36] the waiting that's the trial of your
[1:28:37] faith is the waiting but then when god
[1:28:39] moves then it happens so quick usually
[1:28:41] it's usually a very quick tumble from
[1:28:43] nothing
[1:28:44] to everything's done it's taken care of
[1:28:46] and you're moving on to the next one
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:47] celebrating the victory amen listen when
[1:28:49] you get cancer can you heal yourself
[1:28:52] no you've got to pray and wait for god
[1:28:53] to move amen
[1:28:55] when you've got a temper can you take it
[1:28:57] away no
[1:28:58] amen i can say that one amen what do you
[1:29:01] have to do pray and wait for god to move
[1:29:02] on the scene amen
[1:29:04] if you lack godly character can you add
[1:29:05] it to yourself no
[1:29:07] so what do you do pray and wait for god
[1:29:09] to move on the scene and what's he going
[1:29:10] to do
[1:29:11] this is what we're looking for what's he
[1:29:13] going to do he's going to put you in a
[1:29:14] situation that requires it he's going to
[1:29:16] put you in a situation that requires it
[1:29:18] he's going to put you in a situation
[1:29:19] that requires
[1:29:20] it and he's going to keep doing that
[1:29:21] over and over and over again until
[1:29:23] you've got enough
[1:29:24] of what he requires of you to do the job
[1:29:26] that's at hand amen
[1:29:27] amen it takes great strength to hold
[1:29:30] yourself to the word of god when
[1:29:31] every shred of evidence every sign every
[1:29:34] idea every thought
[1:29:35] says it's wrong and then when you look
[1:29:38] at yourself in the mirror when you look
[1:29:40] at the situation when you look at
[1:29:41] whatever it might be and say nothing's
[1:29:43] changing nothing's changing nothing's
[1:29:45] changing
[1:29:46] in fact it's looking worse than it did
[1:29:48] right
[1:29:50] hold to the word hold to the word and
[1:29:52] say lord
[1:29:53] you said it i didn't say it and all i'm
[1:29:55] doing is i'm holding you to what you
[1:29:57] said amen
[1:29:58] amen amen what does it mean to be a
[1:30:02] believer
[1:30:03] does it mean to accept the truth
[1:30:07] it does but it means you act on it as
[1:30:09] well because brother braham said
[1:30:10] remember what he said he says if you
[1:30:12] believed it you'd act on it
[1:30:13] amen so we don't believe intellectually
[1:30:16] we believe by our actions amen we show
[1:30:18] what we believe by how we live our life
[1:30:20] we show what we believe
[1:30:21] by how we do things or how we don't do
[1:30:23] things as the case may be amen
[1:30:25] we are not believers in intellectualism
[1:30:27] only that's brother branham just
[1:30:29] spent you know he spends how many quotes
[1:30:31] how much time in his ministry saying get
[1:30:33] it out of your head and get it into your
[1:30:34] life
[1:30:35] amen act on it don't just think about it
[1:30:37] don't just acknowledge it intellectually
[1:30:38] don't just say yes
[1:30:39] that's the starting point but he says
[1:30:41] now you put it into action
[1:30:43] because he says the holy spirit will say
[1:30:44] yes say yay amen to every word of god
[1:30:47] but it doesn't just stay there but
[1:30:48] rather it brings it now forth into your
[1:30:49] life and it puts it into action amen
[1:30:52] watch now as we continue with joshua
[1:30:54] because we see here that god
[1:30:56] orchestrates battles for joshua because
[1:30:58] the thing is joshua going through the
[1:30:59] land after he started getting a bunch of
[1:31:01] victories
[1:31:02] maybe those people would have come out
[1:31:03] and said we give up we don't want
[1:31:05] anything to do with you you can have
[1:31:06] what we
[1:31:07] what we have we'll just leave but look
[1:31:09] at what happens in verse 19 it says
[1:31:11] there was not a city that made peace
[1:31:13] with the children of israel
[1:31:14] save the hivites the inhabitants of
[1:31:16] gibeon all others they took in battle
[1:31:19] there's not a single city that threw up
[1:31:21] the white flag and said we surrender
[1:31:23] it says for it was of the lord to harden
[1:31:26] their hearts
[1:31:27] that they should come against israel in
[1:31:29] battle that he might destroy them
[1:31:31] utterly
[1:31:32] and that they might have no favor but
[1:31:34] that he might destroy them
[1:31:35] as the lord commanded moses what was
[1:31:37] joshua's commission
[1:31:38] destroy them it was not get them out it
[1:31:41] was to destroy them
[1:31:43] amen sometimes we think if we can just
[1:31:45] get him out that's enough
[1:31:46] no he said destroy them leave nothing
[1:31:48] left leave no heritage leave no
[1:31:50] sign leave no child behind talk about
[1:31:53] leaving no child behind
[1:31:54] they left no child behind him and there
[1:31:56] was no trace no remnant of that disease
[1:31:59] of that idea of that concept of that
[1:32:01] hybrid
[1:32:02] element amen speaking as a believer now
[1:32:05] there was nothing left for anybody to go
[1:32:07] back and say
[1:32:08] this is what used to be here it was done
[1:32:10] it was gone it was a finished work
[1:32:12] and he says that it was of the lord to
[1:32:15] harden
[1:32:16] their hearts and then joshua's
[1:32:17] commission was destroyed
[1:32:19] and so god made it sure that he would
[1:32:21] have to destroy that there was no chance
[1:32:23] for his conscience maybe to click
[1:32:25] in and say well they don't want to die
[1:32:26] so we'll just let them go kick them out
[1:32:28] put them out past the borders and then
[1:32:29] we'll just let them go
[1:32:30] no it says god hard in their hearts
[1:32:32] because the lord had commanded him to
[1:32:34] destroy them so god sets up the
[1:32:36] situation to require destruction
[1:32:39] so when you look in your life when
[1:32:42] something comes up against you as what
[1:32:43] has god called you to do to it
[1:32:45] and then does god call us to just kick
[1:32:47] it out so it can come back again and
[1:32:49] again and again no he says destroy it
[1:32:51] amen get rid of it completely now
[1:32:54] sometimes that might take a couple
[1:32:55] battles before there's total destruction
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:57] and you'll see that in your life with
[1:32:58] habits and and it'll go out and then
[1:33:00] it'll come in and then it'll go out a
[1:33:01] little longer and then it'll come in
[1:33:02] then it'll go out longer
[1:33:04] then it'll come in and then you finally
[1:33:05] defeat that thing for the final time and
[1:33:06] it's done and it never has any influence
[1:33:08] on you
[1:33:09] and then certain things with young men
[1:33:10] will be different than certain things
[1:33:11] with young women
[1:33:12] for men it's the lust of the eyes and
[1:33:14] these things for women it can be fashion
[1:33:15] it can be
[1:33:16] you know beautification these different
[1:33:18] things you know acknowledgement from the
[1:33:19] world whatever it might be
[1:33:20] but you'll see a lot of times there's a
[1:33:22] back and forth of back and forth before
[1:33:23] that thing's done but when it's done
[1:33:24] it's done
[1:33:25] amen because god does all things well
[1:33:27] amen god does a total victory god
[1:33:29] doesn't leave things halfway done
[1:33:30] and his children don't leave things
[1:33:32] halfway done amen
[1:33:34] amen so what we're pointing to though is
[1:33:36] that if you're facing a battle it's not
[1:33:37] because that person necessarily wants
[1:33:39] it's not because that spirit necessarily
[1:33:41] wants it
[1:33:41] but it's because god has hardened that
[1:33:43] thing to come against you so that you
[1:33:44] can destroy it
[1:33:45] and then god has lured satan into battle
[1:33:47] with his bride
[1:33:48] so that he can train her so that he can
[1:33:50] do what he can refine her
[1:33:52] and so that he can give her the victory
[1:33:54] because to get to
[1:33:55] to get the the reward for every age you
[1:33:57] had to overcome
[1:33:58] and without a victory you can't be an
[1:34:00] overcomer and then so he brings satan
[1:34:02] into battle now
[1:34:03] he hardens the hearts he brings people
[1:34:05] into your life he brings situations into
[1:34:07] your life so that you can overcome it
[1:34:09] and you can get the reward for the age
[1:34:11] amen god's using satan
[1:34:13] as a tool to train his bride amen
[1:34:16] because he defeated him and we'll get
[1:34:17] into this
[1:34:18] this next next thing amen he defeated
[1:34:21] satan and we've got to do the exact same
[1:34:22] thing
[1:34:23] amen we don't walk out of here because
[1:34:25] he did it but rather he wants him to be
[1:34:27] under our feet as well amen
[1:34:31] brother braham says now christ was
[1:34:32] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:34:34] devil
[1:34:35] that was his purpose was to destroy the
[1:34:37] works of the devil because this world is
[1:34:38] the works of the devil at this point it
[1:34:40] is in a fallen condition
[1:34:41] and he came to redeem it back and to
[1:34:43] make sure that we could come back to
[1:34:44] that eating condition
[1:34:46] he says you believe that now i can't
[1:34:47] explain all this i'm just going to go
[1:34:49] through it quickly now hit the high
[1:34:50] places so you won't stay too long
[1:34:52] christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:34:54] works of the devil is that right
[1:34:55] you believe that he says what was he
[1:34:58] god's word which destroys the works of
[1:35:00] the hybrid
[1:35:01] the devil notice that hybrid and brother
[1:35:04] branham hits hybrid religion
[1:35:06] hybrid word constantly why because we
[1:35:09] have added something to it
[1:35:10] satan added something to it he changed
[1:35:12] something and it made it of no effect
[1:35:14] and so he says the word comes to destroy
[1:35:16] the works of the hybrid
[1:35:18] amen that's why we have to take every
[1:35:20] word and only that word scripture says
[1:35:22] if any man adds to it
[1:35:23] or takes out of the word he says his
[1:35:25] name will be taken out of the book of
[1:35:26] life
[1:35:26] amen so we've only got to stay with what
[1:35:28] the word says we don't add to it and we
[1:35:29] don't take away from it
[1:35:31] he says he's going to destroy the works
[1:35:32] of the hybrid is that right
[1:35:34] he was done to do that he was born to
[1:35:36] that to destroy the works of the devil
[1:35:39] so if christ is doing that in his day
[1:35:41] what's he doing in our day
[1:35:42] amen he's got to destroy the works of
[1:35:44] the hybrid and then he's got to destroy
[1:35:46] the works of the adding to and the
[1:35:47] taking away
[1:35:48] that satan's done to try and limit the
[1:35:50] power of the church amen
[1:35:51] amen he says now his body is to do the
[1:35:54] same
[1:35:56] because the body is head and body
[1:35:58] together
[1:35:59] catch that the body is head and body
[1:36:01] together we've got christ the head and
[1:36:03] we are the body
[1:36:04] he says so if they're they're one thing
[1:36:05] together then whatever he's done
[1:36:07] you got to be doing as well he says that
[1:36:09] right of christ is the head was the word
[1:36:11] his body has to be the same thing as his
[1:36:12] head was
[1:36:13] is that right a church of the word born
[1:36:16] of the word
[1:36:17] virgin born from the word remember when
[1:36:19] we covered the seed
[1:36:20] everything that was in that seed that
[1:36:22] seed that they talk about in scripture
[1:36:23] that peter calls it
[1:36:25] nothing can be added to or taken away
[1:36:26] from it that's why he says we are virgin
[1:36:28] born of the words because the word is
[1:36:30] what was inside us
[1:36:31] and it hasn't been changed from eternity
[1:36:33] amen that's the thing that's coming
[1:36:34] forth in you is the very thing that god
[1:36:36] placed before
[1:36:37] you ever had an idea in your head amen
[1:36:40] not denominational now virgin born from
[1:36:43] the word the way the body
[1:36:44] operates is by the head is that right he
[1:36:46] says now the body carries the works
[1:36:49] and carries on the works and does the
[1:36:51] works that the head commands it to do
[1:36:53] but the head said this he says that's
[1:36:55] how we do things the head said to
[1:36:57] you want to put the scriptures down i'll
[1:36:59] give it to you john 14 12
[1:37:01] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:37:04] amen so like i said when you're facing a
[1:37:06] battle know that god has
[1:37:07] ordained you to face that battle as long
[1:37:10] as you're with the word as long as
[1:37:11] you're in the boundaries that he's laid
[1:37:12] out
[1:37:13] i mean so often we get into trials and
[1:37:15] temptations because of our own lusts
[1:37:16] because of our own ideas
[1:37:18] because we've decided to go a different
[1:37:19] way and when you're fighting that battle
[1:37:21] your best thing is to back away
[1:37:22] and then because when they did it at ai
[1:37:24] what happened they failed
[1:37:26] right you're not going to win a battle
[1:37:27] that god hasn't ordained but if you know
[1:37:29] you're walking in the line of duty as we
[1:37:31] covered last service
[1:37:32] then you can say this one's got to fall
[1:37:34] and if he doesn't fall today then he'll
[1:37:36] fall tomorrow and if not tomorrow the
[1:37:37] next day the next week the next month
[1:37:39] it doesn't matter i'm going to keep
[1:37:40] chopping until it falls down before me
[1:37:42] amen
[1:37:43] when you look at joshua joshua didn't
[1:37:44] face the small men
[1:37:46] joshua didn't face the little armies the
[1:37:47] little cities joshua faced
[1:37:49] giants all around was giants
[1:37:52] he had giants over here he had giants
[1:37:54] over here he had giants over here
[1:37:55] we'll read it in the next one everywhere
[1:37:57] around joshua is giants
[1:37:59] and he's facing big battles big people
[1:38:02] way bigger than him
[1:38:04] and yet joshua defeats samoa
[1:38:08] joshua and the israelites the the
[1:38:09] ex-slaves are the greatest warriors of
[1:38:12] their time
[1:38:12] facing the greatest warriors that the
[1:38:14] world could produce at that time
[1:38:16] listen to this verse 21 says at that
[1:38:18] time came joshua and cut off the anakims
[1:38:20] from the mountains from hebron
[1:38:22] from debye from anab and from all the
[1:38:24] mountains of judah and from all the
[1:38:25] mountains of israel joshua destroyed
[1:38:27] them utterly with their cities
[1:38:29] there was none of the anakims left of
[1:38:31] the children of israel only in gaza in
[1:38:33] gath
[1:38:33] and in ashdod there remained who came
[1:38:36] from gath
[1:38:37] goliath the only ones left were in the
[1:38:40] land that joshua didn't
[1:38:41] didn't take every single giant he
[1:38:44] destroyed that was in
[1:38:45] the boundaries that god had given them
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] so joshua took the whole land according
[1:38:51] to all that the lord said unto moses
[1:38:53] and joshua gave it for an inheritance
[1:38:56] unto israel according to their divisions
[1:38:58] by their tribes
[1:38:59] and the land rested from war amen amen
[1:39:02] hallelujah i'm ready for the rest
[1:39:05] but unfortunately we've got to fight a
[1:39:06] long time first
[1:39:08] amen are you with me amen are you ready
[1:39:11] for it amen but when you look at
[1:39:12] joshua's call as we read we look at
[1:39:14] joshua's commission and then we see here
[1:39:17] what is it joshua had a worthy life now
[1:39:19] what's make joshua
[1:39:20] what made joshua worthy because we've
[1:39:22] got to get this in our head right
[1:39:24] because so often what we think is if we
[1:39:25] do the good thing then we're worthy
[1:39:28] amen we bring nothing to him that's
[1:39:29] worthy and anything that we do
[1:39:31] does not make us worthy of the price
[1:39:33] that he has paid amen there's nothing
[1:39:35] you can do
[1:39:36] to warrant the sacrifice that christ
[1:39:37] paid at calvary there's nothing you can
[1:39:39] ever do that would ever
[1:39:40] match up to the price that he paid so
[1:39:42] stop trying
[1:39:44] amen but what makes us worthy is what
[1:39:46] when we do what he has asked us to do
[1:39:48] that is a worthy life it is is deemed
[1:39:51] worthy because it's what he told us to
[1:39:53] do right he says this is what will make
[1:39:55] your life worthwhile
[1:39:56] and this is what makes you worthy in my
[1:39:58] sight is when you do something that i've
[1:40:00] told you to do
[1:40:01] amen because the scripture says and i
[1:40:02] repeat it often and it says that in that
[1:40:05] day they're going to come to me and say
[1:40:06] lord lord did not we do what cast out
[1:40:08] devils in thy name
[1:40:09] right did we not prophesy in thy name
[1:40:13] did we not do many wonderful works in
[1:40:15] thy name
[1:40:16] and they do but he says what only he
[1:40:20] that does the will of the father
[1:40:22] will enter the kingdom amen it's the
[1:40:24] will of god
[1:40:25] in your life that makes you worthy that
[1:40:27] makes you worthy but makes your life
[1:40:29] worthy if i could put it that way
[1:40:30] your worthiness is through the blood of
[1:40:31] christ amen we have his righteousness
[1:40:33] that's our worthiness
[1:40:34] but to make your life worthwhile to make
[1:40:36] it something that god values is to do
[1:40:38] what he has asked you to do and you'll
[1:40:40] see and we've read it before where so
[1:40:42] where you get a man or woman and they
[1:40:43] get disappointed they get hurt they get
[1:40:45] offended and they step away
[1:40:46] and god sends a warning says you should
[1:40:48] come back and if you don't what does he
[1:40:49] do he takes them off the earth
[1:40:51] what is it their life now has lost its
[1:40:53] worthiness right
[1:40:54] god knows that he can't do anything with
[1:40:56] them so he just takes them away and take
[1:40:58] takes that that blemish if you will away
[1:40:59] from from him because he doesn't want it
[1:41:01] there so he just takes them off
[1:41:02] because they won't do what he says he
[1:41:03] says i'm just going to take you home
[1:41:04] then
[1:41:05] amen why you've got to be found walking
[1:41:07] in the will of god amen
[1:41:09] joshua had a singleness of purpose here
[1:41:11] we don't ever hear of joshua taking a
[1:41:13] vacation
[1:41:14] he doesn't go take one one city and then
[1:41:15] come back to the villa that he captured
[1:41:17] in the first round
[1:41:18] you know and then go out again and then
[1:41:20] maybe do a bit of politicking around and
[1:41:22] make sure everybody's still on board
[1:41:23] with this plan joshua just goes from
[1:41:25] city
[1:41:26] to city to city to city to city and why
[1:41:29] because everywhere they go they're
[1:41:30] taking food they're taking provisions
[1:41:32] they're taking stores they're taking
[1:41:33] everything they need to take the next
[1:41:34] one
[1:41:35] they just roll on and they roll on and
[1:41:37] they roll on and they roll on just bang
[1:41:39] bang bang bang bang he took 31 kingdoms
[1:41:41] 31 cities 31 kings in 10 years
[1:41:45] never stop some of these things took
[1:41:46] months
[1:41:48] right one after the other just bang bang
[1:41:50] bang singleness of purpose he says this
[1:41:52] is what i'm here to do
[1:41:53] and this is what i'm going to do and
[1:41:55] guess what by the end of it joshua was
[1:41:56] old and stricken in years the scripture
[1:41:58] says
[1:41:58] it wore him out but that was what made
[1:42:01] his life worthy was that he did what god
[1:42:03] had told him to do amen he put
[1:42:05] everything into it
[1:42:06] he put everything into it right there
[1:42:09] was nothing joshua held back from this
[1:42:10] work
[1:42:11] amen and that's the thing that i believe
[1:42:12] we need to come to is where we put
[1:42:14] everything we've got
[1:42:15] into living for christ amen into doing
[1:42:17] what god has called us to do and call
[1:42:19] and what he's called us to be in this
[1:42:21] age and giving every single
[1:42:23] absolute bit of our attention of our
[1:42:26] energy of our focus of our time
[1:42:28] put everything into that and i believe
[1:42:30] that's what's going to bring results
[1:42:31] is when everything from that world is
[1:42:33] separated from us and all we're doing
[1:42:35] is being focused on the word of god
[1:42:36] being made manifest in our lives
[1:42:38] our portion is to be the manifested sons
[1:42:40] and daughters of god amen so let's
[1:42:42] be it amen it's got to be with
[1:42:43] singleness of purpose amen
[1:42:45] most people can't put push themselves
[1:42:47] for 10 years
[1:42:49] right you'll see it in ministers
[1:42:51] especially they get in the saddle and
[1:42:52] they go they go
[1:42:53] they go they go you'll see it in the
[1:42:54] missionaries especially these guys that
[1:42:56] go back and forth overseas and they're
[1:42:57] in airplanes and
[1:42:58] time zone changes and sleepless nights
[1:43:00] and rough conditions
[1:43:01] and they'll absolutely destroy their
[1:43:03] bodies and their health
[1:43:05] doing it because that's what's driving
[1:43:06] them is to do what god has called them
[1:43:08] to do
[1:43:09] and they'll literally destroy their
[1:43:10] bodies in doing it but in the end he's
[1:43:11] going to say that well done now good and
[1:43:13] faithful servant amen
[1:43:14] you gave me everything you had to give
[1:43:16] amen that's where i want to be found
[1:43:18] amen he put his heart and soul in his
[1:43:21] mind into it
[1:43:22] and it took his life that's what made
[1:43:24] him old was doing the work
[1:43:25] amen but god preserved him through it
[1:43:27] god allowed him to finish the job and
[1:43:29] then he called him home amen
[1:43:31] speaking of the singleness of purpose
[1:43:33] now brother brahms speaking of elisha
[1:43:34] and elijah now remember what elisha said
[1:43:37] to elijah he says
[1:43:38] i want a double portion of your spirit
[1:43:40] right and elijah said that's a big thing
[1:43:42] to ask
[1:43:43] he says and so he said if you'll stick
[1:43:46] with me and if you see me go
[1:43:48] he says then you'll get the double
[1:43:49] portion so elisha had to stay with
[1:43:52] elijah throughout the day
[1:43:53] go all over and if he stayed with him
[1:43:56] and then he saw him get raptured away
[1:43:57] then he would get the double portion now
[1:43:59] this is what brother brahm says i tell
[1:44:00] you
[1:44:01] when god sets a man for a world task he
[1:44:03] has got to have something better than
[1:44:05] the world has got
[1:44:06] amen he has got to have something better
[1:44:09] than the church has got
[1:44:11] he has got to go for a double portion
[1:44:13] amen i believe we all need a double
[1:44:15] portion today it's not just we're not
[1:44:16] just talking ministry now
[1:44:18] amen each one of us needs a double
[1:44:19] portion to do what god is called because
[1:44:21] it's getting darker
[1:44:22] and darker and darker remember this was
[1:44:24] completely dark when the angel put it on
[1:44:26] the
[1:44:26] on the wall we're facing total darkness
[1:44:28] and when you look out today
[1:44:29] there is no light out there there's a
[1:44:31] few people trying to be light
[1:44:33] yes right but it's darkness still amen
[1:44:35] because god's moved on he's not in there
[1:44:37] anymore
[1:44:37] he's gone out and he's he's he's
[1:44:39] fellowshipping with the bride amen
[1:44:42] he says and if there was ever a time
[1:44:43] that a double portion is needed it's
[1:44:45] today
[1:44:46] in the realms of the people he's not
[1:44:47] talking ministry now he's not talking
[1:44:48] prophets he says in the people
[1:44:50] something better than something higher i
[1:44:53] mean how many want something better and
[1:44:55] something higher
[1:44:56] amen say lord lift me up a higher plane
[1:44:58] as we sing you know
[1:45:00] it's going to take less of the world
[1:45:02] that's for sure he says i think beans
[1:45:04] and cornbread is very good but sometimes
[1:45:05] i have to reach up a little higher
[1:45:07] and we do that we've got to we've got to
[1:45:10] keep climbing
[1:45:11] now listen to this he says israel was
[1:45:14] backsliding if it kept
[1:45:16] staying on the same ground she has got
[1:45:19] to be moving on
[1:45:21] or moving back he says and that's the
[1:45:23] way the church is
[1:45:25] why because she was told to possess all
[1:45:28] of it
[1:45:29] not some of it not rest when you've got
[1:45:31] enough to fit the whole group on
[1:45:32] but take everything that god has told
[1:45:34] you to amen her commission was to
[1:45:36] possess
[1:45:36] footsteps his possession and it's the
[1:45:38] same thing for the bride our commission
[1:45:40] is to go in a rapture so we don't stop
[1:45:42] until we go in that rapture
[1:45:44] and then we keep pressing the battle he
[1:45:46] says so as they went along
[1:45:48] it wasn't but a few minutes until elijah
[1:45:50] said you've asked a great thing but
[1:45:52] nevertheless if you see me when i go you
[1:45:54] can have what you've asked for
[1:45:56] he says now that has to be singleness of
[1:45:58] motive
[1:45:59] singleness of heart singleness of i
[1:46:02] keeping your eye on the promise
[1:46:05] he says i not eyes right only let it see
[1:46:09] one thing and that's the word
[1:46:10] and this one can wander around a bit and
[1:46:12] see the periphery and what's going on
[1:46:14] over here and get distracted
[1:46:15] but if you're looking with one on the
[1:46:16] word then you won't notice anything else
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:19] he says hum if you're sick this morning
[1:46:22] if you are afflicted there is one great
[1:46:24] promise
[1:46:25] not by elijah but by god himself if thou
[1:46:28] canst believe when you pray believe that
[1:46:30] you get what you ask for
[1:46:31] and you shall receive it no matter what
[1:46:33] the doctor says how much this goes or
[1:46:35] that goes
[1:46:36] keep single on the promise amen keep
[1:46:38] looking to the promise
[1:46:40] we look to it for the salvation of our
[1:46:41] children we look to it for
[1:46:43] for god's growth in our family we look
[1:46:45] to it in the ministry we look to it for
[1:46:47] healing in our
[1:46:48] in our midst we look to it for
[1:46:49] deliverance we look to it for changing
[1:46:51] amen building us up in the stature of
[1:46:52] god amen all of these things we're
[1:46:54] looking for
[1:46:55] he says keep looking to the promise and
[1:46:57] be single in it
[1:46:58] be a singleness of purpose look to the
[1:47:00] promise and look to nothing else
[1:47:02] and just hold there and believe amen
[1:47:04] amen make your life's purpose to receive
[1:47:06] and be what the word says about you
[1:47:08] or for you as the case may be amen
[1:47:12] thing with joshua by the end he's old
[1:47:13] and stricken but yet there was still a
[1:47:14] work for him to do
[1:47:16] and that was to divide up the land amen
[1:47:18] that's a beautiful type of the holy
[1:47:19] spirit doing what setting the church in
[1:47:21] order that's what the book of ephesians
[1:47:23] is setting the church in order
[1:47:24] to place them where they need to be and
[1:47:26] then giving them a task to do in their
[1:47:27] own little land amen
[1:47:29] amen but when joshua does this now he's
[1:47:31] not a type of the holy spirit in that
[1:47:33] sense because there's something else
[1:47:34] that happens
[1:47:35] when this goes on and we'll see it it is
[1:47:37] the holy spirit it's a type in that
[1:47:38] sense but
[1:47:39] this portion we're looking at here the
[1:47:41] next the next bit of scripture in joshua
[1:47:42] 23 if you want to turn there
[1:47:44] this is now a man transitioning out okay
[1:47:47] it's not the holy spirit transition you
[1:47:48] know because the holy spirit never
[1:47:49] leaves
[1:47:50] amen god's always there god's word is
[1:47:52] always here so when joshua
[1:47:53] talks here in 23 this is not joshua the
[1:47:56] holy spirit talking this is joshua a man
[1:47:58] joshua a leader joshua prophet if we
[1:48:00] want to put it
[1:48:01] that way speaking so joshua 23 verse 1
[1:48:03] says and it came to pass
[1:48:05] a long time after that the lord had
[1:48:06] given rest unto israel from all their
[1:48:08] enemies round about
[1:48:09] that joshua waxed old and stricken in
[1:48:11] age
[1:48:12] and joshua called for all israel and for
[1:48:14] their elders and for their heads and for
[1:48:16] their judges and for their officers and
[1:48:18] said unto them
[1:48:19] i am old and stricken in age and ye have
[1:48:21] seen all that the lord your god had done
[1:48:24] unto all these nations because of you
[1:48:26] for the lord your god is he that fought
[1:48:28] for you
[1:48:29] behold i have divided unto you by lot
[1:48:32] these nations that remaineth
[1:48:33] to be an inheritance for your tribes
[1:48:35] from jordan with all the nations that i
[1:48:37] have cut off even under the great sea
[1:48:39] westward
[1:48:40] now listen to this i mean this is joshua
[1:48:43] the man speaking now
[1:48:45] and the lord your god he shall expel
[1:48:47] them
[1:48:48] from before you and drive them out
[1:48:51] drive them from out of your sight and ye
[1:48:54] shall possess
[1:48:55] their land ye shall possess
[1:48:58] their land as the lord your god hath
[1:49:01] promised unto you where's joshua here
[1:49:04] where's joshua in this scripture does it
[1:49:06] say and joshua leads you
[1:49:08] no it says and ye shall possess their
[1:49:10] land as the lord
[1:49:11] your god hath promised to you so now
[1:49:14] there's a promise unto you
[1:49:15] and to your children and as many as the
[1:49:17] lord our god shall call amen
[1:49:19] you're going to take your land and god's
[1:49:21] going to push them out from before you
[1:49:23] to allow you to take your land be
[1:49:27] ye therefore courageous to keep and do
[1:49:30] all that is written in the book of the
[1:49:32] law of moses that you turn not aside
[1:49:34] there from to the right hand to the to
[1:49:36] the left
[1:49:36] what commission is this this is joshua's
[1:49:40] commission
[1:49:41] the joshua commission never changes does
[1:49:43] it
[1:49:44] what happens is joshua comes and goes
[1:49:46] moses comes and goes but the commission
[1:49:48] stays the same
[1:49:48] he's repeating the very words that god
[1:49:51] gave him for his commission
[1:49:52] and saying now you guys take your
[1:49:53] commission amen this is now on your
[1:49:56] shoulders to do it i'm leaving but
[1:49:58] you've got a work to do
[1:49:59] and he's repeating the very words that
[1:50:00] god told him to do amen
[1:50:02] he says that you came not among these
[1:50:04] nations these that remain among you
[1:50:06] neither make mention of the name of
[1:50:08] their gods nor caused to swear by them
[1:50:10] neither serve them nor bow yourselves
[1:50:12] unto them
[1:50:14] but cleave unto the lord your god as you
[1:50:16] have done unto this day
[1:50:17] for the lord had driven them out from
[1:50:19] before out
[1:50:21] driven out from before you great nations
[1:50:22] and strong but as for you
[1:50:25] no man has been able to stand before you
[1:50:26] unto this day he's reminding you look
[1:50:28] you've had lots of victories
[1:50:31] one man of you shall chase a thousand
[1:50:35] one man of you shall chase a thousand
[1:50:38] amen for the lord your god he it is that
[1:50:41] fighteth for you
[1:50:43] as he has promised you amen what are we
[1:50:46] seeing here we're not a scene
[1:50:47] seeing an end to the work of god we're
[1:50:49] not seeing an end to the presence of god
[1:50:51] we're not seeing an end to the
[1:50:52] commission of god but we're seeing a
[1:50:54] handoff
[1:50:55] of the commission of god right what's he
[1:50:58] saying
[1:50:58] when i leave god's staying when i move
[1:51:01] off the scene god will still be present
[1:51:03] and the same thing that he told me i'm
[1:51:05] now supposed to tell you and you're
[1:51:07] supposed to finish the work that i
[1:51:08] started amen
[1:51:09] amen we had a prophet come and do
[1:51:12] everything like joshua did
[1:51:15] and then what happened he laid it in our
[1:51:17] laps he said go do the same thing amen
[1:51:20] right i was just listening to jesus
[1:51:22] christ the same yesterday today forever
[1:51:24] brother brown calls people up
[1:51:25] my discernment tells them what their
[1:51:26] issue is lays hands on them
[1:51:28] and then they're healed and then what
[1:51:30] does he do he says you
[1:51:31] lay your hand on the one next to you and
[1:51:33] next one he says and every one of you
[1:51:35] pray for the one next to you
[1:51:36] don't pray for yourself pray for the one
[1:51:38] next to you and you just hear this roar
[1:51:39] go up throughout the churches that
[1:51:41] people realize
[1:51:42] hey he's commissioned us to do the same
[1:51:43] thing the god that's with him is with us
[1:51:45] as well
[1:51:46] and if we believe then he does the same
[1:51:47] thing amen what is it it's a handoff of
[1:51:49] the commission
[1:51:50] from now just the man of god to the
[1:51:52] people of god and saying
[1:51:53] press forward don't stop you've won
[1:51:56] everything so far
[1:51:57] god's still with you and if you'll do
[1:51:59] the same thing i did stay with the word
[1:52:00] that god gave moses if you'll stick with
[1:52:02] the word then he'll do continue to do
[1:52:04] the same thing until you have won
[1:52:05] everything in your own property in the
[1:52:07] land that i've given you amen
[1:52:11] it's the problem in jeffersonville today
[1:52:13] unfortunately
[1:52:14] they're stuck with a man they're stuck
[1:52:16] on a man they said god's still with that
[1:52:18] man
[1:52:18] guess what god isn't with brother
[1:52:19] branham anymore he's with his bride he's
[1:52:21] moved on
[1:52:22] amen and there what they're doing is
[1:52:23] they're looking to a man then to take
[1:52:25] them back and that's why they're looking
[1:52:26] for him to come back
[1:52:27] right they're not recognizing the the
[1:52:29] present god unveiled before them
[1:52:31] right he's in the bride now he's not in
[1:52:33] brother branham he's not working with
[1:52:34] brother brown he's working in a bride
[1:52:36] now and if you're looking for that man
[1:52:37] to come back to give you rapture in
[1:52:38] faith we've got problems
[1:52:39] big problems amen amen amen listen to
[1:52:43] that one man of you shall chase a
[1:52:44] thousand do we need an army
[1:52:46] do we need a big army hey if it's one
[1:52:48] against a thousand it doesn't take many
[1:52:50] to put the flight anything that comes
[1:52:51] against you amen
[1:52:52] amen amen what's he saying he's saying
[1:52:54] nothing can stand
[1:52:56] nothing can stand before you don't look
[1:52:57] at numbers don't look at size don't look
[1:52:59] at situations don't look at
[1:53:00] symptoms he's saying one of you can put
[1:53:03] a thousand to flight
[1:53:04] and we see it we see it in the
[1:53:06] scriptures time and time again amen
[1:53:09] listen to this this is what brother
[1:53:10] braham says we find out that samson
[1:53:11] think of that with an old brittle
[1:53:13] jawbone of a mule
[1:53:14] that had been laid out on that prairie
[1:53:15] for many years and anyone knows you
[1:53:17] could hit it against the rock and fly to
[1:53:19] pieces it's brittle it's dried out it's
[1:53:20] not strong
[1:53:22] he says in samson they said samson the
[1:53:24] philistines are pounding he looked
[1:53:26] around he had nothing in his hand
[1:53:27] and here was a thousand philistines
[1:53:29] standing there so he just reached down
[1:53:30] and picked up this whole jawbone
[1:53:32] and you think of those helmets with
[1:53:33] sometimes an inch and a half thick over
[1:53:35] the top of their heads
[1:53:36] and he took that mule's jaw donut
[1:53:38] jawbone and beat down a thousand
[1:53:39] philistines
[1:53:40] huh them sticking up in the rocks hiding
[1:53:43] said you want some of it come on down
[1:53:48] it was a paradox that says but the
[1:53:50] spirit of the lord was upon him
[1:53:52] that's what made the difference and then
[1:53:54] we spoke about shamgar defeating 600
[1:53:56] philistines with a
[1:53:56] with a stick with a blunt iron tip on it
[1:53:59] what was it he had enough
[1:54:00] he got sick and tired of it brother
[1:54:02] brown says a spirit of indignation
[1:54:04] righteous indignation flared upon him
[1:54:05] and that's what caused him to do it
[1:54:07] what was the difference the spirit of
[1:54:09] the lord was upon him
[1:54:10] it was a paradox to see a man with
[1:54:12] well-armed men
[1:54:13] trained men to fight with long spears
[1:54:15] and knives and so forth helmets and
[1:54:17] armors
[1:54:18] and this one man standing alone in the
[1:54:19] field with the jawbone of a mule
[1:54:21] and beat down a thousand of them he said
[1:54:23] but it's the truth the bible said it was
[1:54:26] a man that could take the gates of gaza
[1:54:28] that way down there probably eight tons
[1:54:29] apiece big brass gates
[1:54:31] and they fenced him in one night said
[1:54:33] well we'll get him
[1:54:34] said we'll comb every hair in here until
[1:54:36] we find him and we'll get him but this
[1:54:38] little shrimp
[1:54:39] come out about midnight looked out there
[1:54:40] and the gates was in his way
[1:54:42] so he just picked them up and put them
[1:54:43] upon his shoulders and walked up the top
[1:54:45] of the hill and sat down on them
[1:54:47] it was a paradox remember samson
[1:54:50] wasn't this big muscular man scripture
[1:54:53] says the spirit of the lord came upon
[1:54:55] him and then he did mighty deeds he
[1:54:56] wasn't this built man
[1:54:58] i mean that's why that's what the world
[1:54:59] would paint him as that's what
[1:55:00] denominations would paint a mess
[1:55:01] no brother batman says he's a shrimp
[1:55:04] right
[1:55:05] but when the spirit of god came on him
[1:55:06] nothing could stop him amen
[1:55:08] are you listening church when the spare
[1:55:10] of the lord came on you
[1:55:12] nothing can stop you amen he says you
[1:55:14] can't fence god in
[1:55:17] you can't tie him in nowhere he is god
[1:55:19] sure
[1:55:20] great victory said he's won samson god
[1:55:22] used him and made a paradox
[1:55:24] he used anybody as long as you'll take
[1:55:27] his word if you're ordained for the
[1:55:28] cause
[1:55:30] oh i'm weak hey join the group
[1:55:34] i am weak but thou art strong amen we
[1:55:36] got here by admitting our weakness
[1:55:39] amen but he says what he'll use anybody
[1:55:41] if you'll take his word if you're
[1:55:42] ordained for the cause
[1:55:44] it goes back to the question of who you
[1:55:46] are are you ordained for the cause are
[1:55:48] you a child of god are you a son of god
[1:55:49] are you a daughter of god
[1:55:51] amen or are you sitting here in this
[1:55:52] church as a grandchild resting on your
[1:55:55] parents or your grandparents experience
[1:55:57] amen but if you're ordained for the
[1:55:58] cause if you are a holy ghost-filled
[1:56:00] person
[1:56:01] then you are ordained to take anything
[1:56:02] that stands before you
[1:56:04] amen amen again don't get caught up in
[1:56:07] well that was samson
[1:56:09] amen what does he say here if you'll
[1:56:11] take his word and you're ordained for
[1:56:12] the cause the same thing happens to you
[1:56:14] when the spirit comes mightily upon you
[1:56:16] you're going to do something that you
[1:56:17] never realized you could ever do before
[1:56:20] amen what was samson before the spirit
[1:56:22] came on him
[1:56:23] a shrimp
[1:56:27] what was samson before the spirit came
[1:56:28] on him a shrimp a nobody a nothing i
[1:56:31] could probably beat him in an arm
[1:56:32] wrestle
[1:56:33] okay he's not a strong man he's not a
[1:56:35] man that does courageous deeds
[1:56:37] before the spirit of god comes on but
[1:56:39] drop the spirit of god on him and
[1:56:41] nothing
[1:56:42] can hold him back amen he kills three
[1:56:44] thousand
[1:56:45] when he knocks down a temple at the end
[1:56:46] of his life he pushes a temple down with
[1:56:48] his bare hands folks
[1:56:50] can you imagine push the temple down
[1:56:53] with his bare hands
[1:56:55] he kills a thousand with the jawbone
[1:56:58] he breaks ropes as if they are wax hot
[1:57:01] wax
[1:57:03] everything he does is supernatural when
[1:57:06] the spirit's on him
[1:57:07] and guess what he was one of the most
[1:57:09] flawed men in the scripture
[1:57:10] samson had deep issues he had issues
[1:57:13] with women he had issues with lust he
[1:57:15] had issues with popularity
[1:57:17] and it kept pulling him back and in the
[1:57:18] end it killed him amen but when the
[1:57:20] spirit of the lord was on him he did
[1:57:22] things that nobody else could ever
[1:57:23] imagine
[1:57:24] we have the indwelling amen as i said
[1:57:27] before there is
[1:57:28] the power of the spirit that worketh in
[1:57:30] us that we're looking to amen
[1:57:32] this is something that's always with us
[1:57:33] god is always with us god is always
[1:57:35] around us god is always available to us
[1:57:37] if we're under the blood amen and so the
[1:57:40] spirit
[1:57:40] can drop mightily on us at any time amen
[1:57:43] there's no hindrance now there's nothing
[1:57:44] to hold back the power of the bride
[1:57:47] except will you take his word and
[1:57:50] recognize you're ordained to use it amen
[1:57:52] amen god didn't come to us by chance i
[1:57:55] mean i think one of the greatest
[1:57:56] revelations we can have is that you
[1:57:58] always were a child of god
[1:57:59] and there's nothing you can do to
[1:58:00] deserve it and there's nothing you can
[1:58:01] do to change it
[1:58:02] amen you are there before the foundation
[1:58:04] of the world and you're where you are
[1:58:06] today because he has called you
[1:58:07] and he has ordained you for a purpose
[1:58:09] and it is to be the spoken word for this
[1:58:11] age
[1:58:12] amen it is a spoken word we are a spoken
[1:58:14] word bride that's what brother branham
[1:58:15] said amen
[1:58:16] what is something that god has said was
[1:58:18] going to happen he wrote it down for us
[1:58:20] and now we are here to manifest today
[1:58:22] man
[1:58:24] god doesn't give us the holy ghost as a
[1:58:25] reward
[1:58:27] it's not a reward we do it by obedience
[1:58:30] and there's a process to get it but god
[1:58:32] doesn't give us the holy ghost as a
[1:58:33] reward he gives us to us because it's a
[1:58:34] requirement for the age
[1:58:36] amen we have to have that token and you
[1:58:37] can't live the life that he's calling
[1:58:39] you to live
[1:58:40] unless you have that holy spirit amen
[1:58:43] it's a promise to us but it's not a
[1:58:44] reward every son and daughter of god has
[1:58:47] to have that holy
[1:58:48] spirit because the word has to be the
[1:58:50] word amen and that holy spirit
[1:58:52] comes from that word amen in the
[1:58:53] beginning was the word where was with
[1:58:55] god
[1:58:56] the word was god and the word was made
[1:58:57] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:58:59] amen it's still dwelling among us i mean
[1:59:01] that's next service by god's grace amen
[1:59:03] so what's joshua saying here keep
[1:59:05] pushing keep pressing don't slack off
[1:59:07] just because i'm gone doesn't mean that
[1:59:08] god stopped moving that there's no power
[1:59:11] there's no strength and then be
[1:59:12] courageous because he's going to keep
[1:59:14] doing the same things with you
[1:59:15] if you'll do what i did while i was here
[1:59:17] amen
[1:59:18] listen to this because what's he saying
[1:59:20] is if you do take
[1:59:21] he said don't go to other gods don't
[1:59:23] even mention their name
[1:59:25] don't don't get alliances don't do any
[1:59:26] of these things he says
[1:59:28] stay separate from it and destroy all
[1:59:31] you're looking to do is destroy the
[1:59:32] works of the devil amen
[1:59:33] take out the people that are in the land
[1:59:36] but the ramp said in christ as the
[1:59:37] inexhaustible fountain of life we are
[1:59:39] planted in him by the holy spirit
[1:59:41] and then just drink from him what he's
[1:59:44] saying is there's no limit
[1:59:46] on god for you there's no limit on power
[1:59:49] there's no limit on strength there's no
[1:59:50] limit on character
[1:59:52] the inexhaustible fountain the holy
[1:59:54] spirit gives you access to that
[1:59:56] every person that's a christian he says
[1:59:57] the devil don't care how much you come
[2:00:00] to christ as long as you don't drink
[2:00:02] get in the presence we talk about an
[2:00:04] atmosphere get in the presence what good
[2:00:05] is it if you don't yield to it
[2:00:07] amen if you don't let it have an effect
[2:00:08] in your life he says
[2:00:10] the devil don't care how much you come
[2:00:11] to christ as long as you don't drink
[2:00:13] you can stand at the table in your mouth
[2:00:15] watering and say well i'm here i'm here
[2:00:18] you're afraid to turn your faith loose
[2:00:20] see
[2:00:21] he said he blames it on our faith he
[2:00:23] says you have a lack of faith that you
[2:00:24] won't take that word
[2:00:27] he says i love guns a man in the last
[2:00:30] meeting in minneapolis the brother know
[2:00:31] my weakness i love to hunt
[2:00:33] he gave me a rifle and how i love it
[2:00:35] hunting and rifles and fishing he said
[2:00:37] i've got the rifle saying at home just
[2:00:38] to go hunting if i never use it it'll
[2:00:41] never do me no good
[2:00:42] he says and when you receive the holy
[2:00:45] spirit
[2:00:45] everything you have need of for life
[2:00:47] earth's journey
[2:00:48] is in you then let me read it again and
[2:00:52] when you receive the holy spirit
[2:00:54] everything that you have need of for
[2:00:55] earth's journey is in you then
[2:00:58] the power that worketh in you has
[2:01:00] everything you'll ever need
[2:01:02] amen amen when you take a little bit of
[2:01:05] infinity
[2:01:06] of eternity what do you have
[2:01:09] no math majors in here you can't take a
[2:01:12] bit of affinity
[2:01:13] you can't because it's undefinable so
[2:01:15] what you have is infinity and then
[2:01:16] infinity and you have it and i have it
[2:01:18] and every one of us has eternity
[2:01:19] because you can't break up eternity and
[2:01:22] then it's just always there
[2:01:23] amen so you have the same thing that he
[2:01:25] has amen
[2:01:27] but we have it in a body that's
[2:01:28] condemned that's the only limiting
[2:01:30] factor for us
[2:01:31] he says turn it loose and let it go to
[2:01:34] work see
[2:01:34] let your faith lose and believe god
[2:01:37] that's what joshua's saying
[2:01:38] let your faith loose i've showed it to
[2:01:40] you i've proved it to you moses proved
[2:01:42] it to you
[2:01:42] now it's in your laps it's up for you to
[2:01:44] do now it's up for you to say this is
[2:01:46] for me
[2:01:47] it wasn't just for him and god doesn't
[2:01:49] just listen to him and god doesn't just
[2:01:51] back him up
[2:01:52] but now god backs me up amen and if i'm
[2:01:54] doing what he was doing then god will
[2:01:56] continue to back me up all the way to
[2:01:57] the rapture amen
[2:01:59] he says oh my what god could do with
[2:02:01] this little group right now
[2:02:03] what he can do if he can ever get one
[2:02:05] person in his grip
[2:02:06] just so he can hold that one person
[2:02:08] brother brown points out time and time
[2:02:10] again god only needs one person
[2:02:12] and then sometimes it's a woman like
[2:02:14] jail
[2:02:15] remember when she had to kill that man
[2:02:17] he raised up a woman to do it
[2:02:20] most times it's a man when it comes to
[2:02:21] spiritual leadership that's the way it's
[2:02:22] supposed to be in the scripture
[2:02:23] but there are women that get stirred up
[2:02:25] too amen miriam got stirred up to lead
[2:02:27] them in worship didn't she
[2:02:28] and then we see it all through the
[2:02:29] scriptures don't let your gender hold
[2:02:31] you back from saying god won't use me or
[2:02:32] can't use me
[2:02:33] amen in the in the the temple
[2:02:37] he he took the he took christ to who
[2:02:39] anna and simeon
[2:02:41] he had a man and a woman ready and
[2:02:42] waiting and looking amen
[2:02:44] amen don't let god look down on you sis
[2:02:46] you know don't look down on yourself
[2:02:47] sisters and say
[2:02:48] well this is just for the brothers
[2:02:49] because brother brown keeps saying
[2:02:50] manhood and men and sons and
[2:02:52] the scripture's got to pick a gender you
[2:02:53] know amen
[2:02:55] but we're all members of the bride of
[2:02:57] christ amen we're all
[2:02:59] supposed to be there on that day amen
[2:03:00] we've all got to be spiritual we've all
[2:03:02] got to be led by the spirit amen we've
[2:03:04] all got to have the holy spirit working
[2:03:05] in us and if it's working in us then
[2:03:07] it'll be working in us
[2:03:08] amen it's not stagnant it's not sitting
[2:03:10] there but it's going to be doing
[2:03:11] something that's going to have an effect
[2:03:12] on those around us amen
[2:03:14] was he say god if he can ever get one
[2:03:17] person
[2:03:18] in his grip just so he can hold that one
[2:03:20] person he can put
[2:03:21] ten thousand to flight with that one
[2:03:23] person
[2:03:24] joshua says one will make ten we'll make
[2:03:27] a thousand run you know where the
[2:03:28] scripture says
[2:03:29] one will put ten thousand to flight it
[2:03:31] actually says the enemies
[2:03:33] he says if you don't serve god he says
[2:03:34] one of them will make ten thousand of
[2:03:36] you run
[2:03:39] do you know that ten 000 is the promise
[2:03:42] to
[2:03:42] your enemies if you're out of the will
[2:03:44] of god
[2:03:46] mean that you have no strength when
[2:03:48] you're out of the will of god
[2:03:49] nothing you can do your theology your
[2:03:51] your church entity
[2:03:52] how much you've been you you've studied
[2:03:54] the message that has nothing to do with
[2:03:55] it when you're out of the will of god
[2:03:57] a little tiny demon can make you run
[2:03:59] like a little scared girl
[2:04:02] that's what he says amen but when you're
[2:04:05] on
[2:04:05] his side and then when god's working
[2:04:07] through you lebron says you can put
[2:04:09] anything to flight
[2:04:10] anything to flight nothing's going to
[2:04:12] stand before you with one person with
[2:04:14] genuine faith he can put ten thousand
[2:04:16] devils running as hard
[2:04:17] as they can go remember in his meetings
[2:04:20] he talked about them screaming one to
[2:04:21] the other
[2:04:22] right screaming for help scream him for
[2:04:24] help one man
[2:04:25] and none of those demons there could
[2:04:27] touch him he says yes sir amen i'm so
[2:04:29] glad aren't you
[2:04:31] it's not just brother branham it's not
[2:04:32] just joshua it's not just moses it's not
[2:04:34] just jesus christ
[2:04:35] this is a commission for the entire
[2:04:37] bride amen we're talking about a worthy
[2:04:39] life now
[2:04:40] and then gideon was the lowest man in
[2:04:42] the lowest family of the lowest tribe of
[2:04:44] all of israel
[2:04:45] and he beat 120 000 plus midianites with
[2:04:48] 300 men
[2:04:49] right it's not great lineages
[2:04:52] you know it's not these tremendous
[2:04:54] bloodlines it's not well my dad was in
[2:04:57] or my grandfather was in brother
[2:04:58] banham's uh services and
[2:05:00] and he got his hands laid on him and he
[2:05:02] was told that he was going to be the
[2:05:03] the next big this at no no no no no he
[2:05:06] says any man
[2:05:07] that he can get his grip in any person
[2:05:09] he can get in his grip
[2:05:10] that's what's going to send ten thousand
[2:05:11] running before him amen
[2:05:14] god's looking for somebody that will
[2:05:15] believe and obey that's it believe and
[2:05:17] obey
[2:05:18] and you'll see a bunch of nobodies in
[2:05:20] the scripture a bunch of nobodies in the
[2:05:22] scripture doing things and gideon was
[2:05:23] one of them
[2:05:24] remember what he said thou mann of valor
[2:05:25] and he looks around who
[2:05:27] are you talking to right no it's not
[2:05:29] that's not what we're that's not what
[2:05:30] he's looking for he's looking for
[2:05:31] somebody that'll believe and obey
[2:05:33] amen brahm said now if somebody can
[2:05:35] become one of his people
[2:05:37] god can use them if they're ready to
[2:05:40] forget
[2:05:41] that they are somebody amen
[2:05:45] that's a tough thing to walk in thinking
[2:05:48] you're something
[2:05:49] and then he won't have anything to do
[2:05:51] with you until you say i am
[2:05:53] nothing i am but dust as the scripture
[2:05:56] says
[2:05:58] if you are ready to forget that you're a
[2:06:00] somebody and become
[2:06:02] a nobody then god can use you and make
[2:06:04] somebody out of you
[2:06:06] see but you've got to forget that you're
[2:06:08] so important
[2:06:09] we see that with moses right moses is
[2:06:11] raised we read it in last service
[2:06:13] raised as a deliverer told you're going
[2:06:15] to be a deliverer god's chosen you
[2:06:16] you're going to be a mighty man
[2:06:18] you've got a tremendous work you're
[2:06:19] going to fulfill prophecy and moses had
[2:06:21] all of the understanding he had all the
[2:06:23] intellectual conceptions
[2:06:24] and then one day he decided i'm going to
[2:06:26] be a deliverer and what did he end up
[2:06:27] with
[2:06:28] one dead egyptian right why he had been
[2:06:31] told he was a somebody
[2:06:33] he was going to be a somebody and that
[2:06:35] god was going to use him
[2:06:36] he was a deliverer but when he tried to
[2:06:38] do it his way
[2:06:39] he just got in his own way and he made a
[2:06:41] big mess of it and god had to take him
[2:06:43] out there for 40 years
[2:06:44] and beat out his idea that he was a
[2:06:46] somebody right
[2:06:47] got him married had him looking after
[2:06:49] sheep in the desert
[2:06:51] and finally god got him to the place
[2:06:53] where he realized i'm a nobody
[2:06:55] can't even talk that's how bad it got i
[2:06:57] can't even talk
[2:06:59] amen lebron continues he says and
[2:07:01] sometimes when we think we're somebody
[2:07:03] he says the highest hierarchy of heaven
[2:07:05] became flesh in a
[2:07:07] foot wash flunky when he come to wash
[2:07:09] mortal's feet when he come to the earth
[2:07:11] he didn't come
[2:07:12] to be a big somebody god always takes
[2:07:14] the nobodies to make somebody out of
[2:07:15] them
[2:07:16] that's the trouble with the people today
[2:07:18] they're trying to be a somebody
[2:07:20] you'll see people seeking after gifts
[2:07:22] seeking after ministry seeking after
[2:07:24] position
[2:07:24] seeking after money seeking after
[2:07:26] influence why because they want to be
[2:07:28] somebody
[2:07:29] now sometimes that comes from a godly
[2:07:31] desire
[2:07:32] they want to actually say be able to say
[2:07:35] i'm doing something for god i've got
[2:07:36] something
[2:07:37] but the thing is he's got to choose you
[2:07:38] he's got to place you he's got to show
[2:07:40] you what he wants you to be
[2:07:41] amen peter was a great fisherman but
[2:07:44] when he called him he didn't say peter
[2:07:45] i'm going to have you set up a school of
[2:07:46] fishing for
[2:07:47] christian boys well he said i'm going to
[2:07:49] make you a fisherman
[2:07:50] peter never fished again except when he
[2:07:52] was backslid
[2:07:54] peter wasn't a fisher anymore and then
[2:07:56] he was a minister
[2:07:57] and then god took him completely out of
[2:07:58] his vocation and turned him into
[2:08:00] something else amen
[2:08:01] sometimes we come and we say god i've
[2:08:03] got gifts i've got talents
[2:08:05] use them no no no no that's not what we
[2:08:08] do brother bob and i were talking about
[2:08:10] this the other day
[2:08:10] what do we do we come we say lord here i
[2:08:12] am amen
[2:08:14] if you want to use what i've got use it
[2:08:16] but if you want me to lay it aside
[2:08:18] i'll do that as well amen and i can see
[2:08:20] the older people saying that's true
[2:08:22] and the young people will learn that
[2:08:23] sometimes we're so intent that god has
[2:08:25] gifted me
[2:08:26] that we try and force the issue and say
[2:08:27] lord use me in that area
[2:08:29] amen no no no we say lord humbly to thy
[2:08:31] cross i bring
[2:08:33] what can't bring anything just myself
[2:08:36] lord use me how you want me to be used
[2:08:38] amen let's just stand together if we
[2:08:40] would
[2:08:41] he says he says you want to become a
[2:08:44] nobody
[2:08:45] god takes something that there's nothing
[2:08:47] to to make something out of it and prove
[2:08:50] that he's got it let me tell you when
[2:08:51] god does a work in your life and you
[2:08:53] know what you had
[2:08:54] or didn't have as the case was and then
[2:08:57] he put something in there you know that
[2:08:58] god's moving in your life amen you know
[2:09:00] that he's put something in there that
[2:09:01] you have never had amen that worthy life
[2:09:04] is a life where god has used you to
[2:09:05] prove his word for his day
[2:09:07] that's all joshua was doing god had
[2:09:09] given them a word he had given them a
[2:09:10] promise he had given them the time to do
[2:09:11] it and they said let's be the word for
[2:09:13] our day
[2:09:14] amen that's what we're called to do is
[2:09:15] to be the word for our day you've got to
[2:09:17] recognize your message
[2:09:18] so you can know what you're supposed to
[2:09:19] be if you get the message wrong you're
[2:09:21] going to get the life wrong as well
[2:09:22] and that's why brother braham said you
[2:09:24] have to recognize your message and your
[2:09:25] day
[2:09:26] is because you'll be reflecting a word
[2:09:27] from a different age and it's of no use
[2:09:29] that's not worthy anymore amen you've
[2:09:31] got to be what god is that day amen
[2:09:33] amen we want to be able to say lord
[2:09:38] you're looking for supernatural and what
[2:09:41] i've got
[2:09:41] will not be supernatural unless you take
[2:09:43] it and use it
[2:09:45] and guess what if you don't take it and
[2:09:47] use it then it's going to hinder the
[2:09:48] supernatural
[2:09:49] amen talking with a friend of mine
[2:09:51] yesterday
[2:09:53] you know about ministering and whatnot
[2:09:54] and he was he was
[2:09:56] talking to me about some things in my
[2:09:57] own life and he said you know if you use
[2:09:58] that
[2:09:59] and you fall back on that it's going to
[2:10:00] it's going to cause your ministry to
[2:10:02] fail
[2:10:02] because he says you can step into that
[2:10:04] so easily you've got to be
[2:10:06] you got to be able to se step back and
[2:10:08] just say lord
[2:10:09] do what you want in this service do what
[2:10:11] you want with the people
[2:10:12] get me off my notes be able to move me
[2:10:14] around in these different things he says
[2:10:16] because you can step into that
[2:10:17] intellectual side so easy
[2:10:18] and that's something i've got to keep
[2:10:20] under a prayer blanket amen
[2:10:21] to say lord don't let me get caught up
[2:10:23] and study so that i don't hear your
[2:10:24] voice
[2:10:25] and then don't let my natural gift get
[2:10:27] in the way of my spiritual gift
[2:10:29] amen that's what we each one have to do
[2:10:31] we have to be able to say lord
[2:10:32] use me as you want and let me lay it
[2:10:34] aside if you need me to lay it aside
[2:10:36] amen let's just bow our heads heavenly
[2:10:39] father
[2:10:40] lord we know that we bring nothing that
[2:10:42] makes us worthy
[2:10:43] but lord we don't want to come to lay
[2:10:46] our crown at your feet with no jewels in
[2:10:47] it heavenly father
[2:10:49] and lord those jewels are things that
[2:10:50] and and souls and people that you've
[2:10:53] lord called lord that we bring something
[2:10:55] to you and your word says it's going to
[2:10:57] be tried by fire lord every work that we
[2:10:59] do
[2:10:59] every man's work every woman's work will
[2:11:01] be tried by fire
[2:11:03] and lord it can be destroyed or we know
[2:11:05] we can't be lost but our works can be
[2:11:07] destroyed but we want to take our lives
[2:11:09] lord
[2:11:09] yield them to you submit them to you
[2:11:11] lord so that they would have an eternal
[2:11:12] effect heavenly father
[2:11:14] that we can bring something to offer you
[2:11:15] to lay at your feet
[2:11:17] and lord it never lord it would stand up
[2:11:19] against the great price that you paid
[2:11:21] for us
[2:11:22] lord but we want to be able to say we
[2:11:23] did what you called us to do heavenly
[2:11:25] father
[2:11:26] lord we pray that you would just
[2:11:27] minister to your people
[2:11:29] lord help us to surrender anew this
[2:11:31] morning lord that we will find our way
[2:11:33] to your cross
[2:11:34] lord to lay down everything that would
[2:11:36] hinder us heavenly father and to step
[2:11:38] forward in liberty lord where you freed
[2:11:40] us
[2:11:40] and you're using us and you're leading
[2:11:42] and guiding us lord we pray
