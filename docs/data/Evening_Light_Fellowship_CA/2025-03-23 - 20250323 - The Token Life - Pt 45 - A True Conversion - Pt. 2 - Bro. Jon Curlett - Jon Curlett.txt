as we hear Lord may we receive in our soul lord may it do a wonderful work in each one of us we pray Lord so many not here this morning Lord sick and Lord things going on Lord we pray a special Grace to them Lord that you would go to the Collins house and sister Becky Lord each one Lord that you be with brother Grant Lord the the yugos Lord each one Lord we pray your ministering Grace to them Lord bless us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 first verse second Peter chapter 1 and God bless you um we'll hopefully finish this thought today and uh spoke with brother Barry yesterday and he's to take the Wednesday night service as well Lord willing as the Sunday service and then he's spending his Saturday with the married couples so remember him and sister Becky in prayer as they travel that they get here safely and no issues and and uh that they'd have a restful time even with all the work amen and that they'd be a blessing and that they get a blessing as well am mean God bless you second Peter chapter 1 and verse one remember last service we read where Jesus said to Peter he said Satan has desired to sift you as wheat but I want you to see the finished uh test testimony of Peter here and he says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ this is when it's all said and done now he says to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're going to continue our little thought on a true conversion this morning Amen in last service we covered Peter's calling we covered his ministry we covered his position ition we covered his foundational Revelation and we saw that even with those signs and wonders and walking with Jesus every day Peter was still a man that couldn't seem to get it right consistently he had these moments of great faith Peter and Jesus are the only two people to walk on water and yes Peter fell afterwards but he walked on water he had these moments of tremendous Faith he was a man of bulldog faith maybe we'd say today but then he had those moments where he was just so caught up in himself and his Humanity came out and his intellect or lack thereof baby came out and he just couldn't seem to get things right he just couldn't stay consistent and last service we finished with a few episodes where we saw Peter was resisting Jesus or even rebuking or correcting Jesus and it's a strange thing to think of somebody correcting our Lord and savior you know but I don't like to leave Peter out here on a limb by himself because so many times we may not go to God like Peter did or go to Jesus and take him by the lapels and say now Jesus forbid that these things happen but yet by our own attit itude and by our response to things that are going long we can sit there and we can correct God you know so often what we can do is we can we can look at situations in our life and we can say God forbid that I have to go through this why is this happening to me why hasn't this changed and our attitude and our response to God is one of correcting God for how he's using things in our life to get us to a certain end and we can sit there and we can get an attitude and we can get a a certain way of responding and we can get tucked up in ourselves and we can get bitter we can get angry we can get into Despair and our response to those things is actually us trying to correct God because we're not accepting him for what he's doing in our life we're not trusting him for what he has as a plan for us amen and so in our Humanity we can start to question God and we are doing it no differently than Peter did it's just we don't have the physical body to lay hold of to talk about these things listen to this what brother B he says see how people are even getting bitter he says they're getting against God he says because they pray and pray and pray and nothing happened what is it they want the situation to change it may be a life situation it may be a situation for healing it might be a situation for deliverance per for provision they pray and pray and pray and nothing happens he says and they turn against God that's what Peter did he turned against Christ he literally tried to turn him away from the word he became a stumbling block he he was a stumbling block to Jesus it wasn't effective but Peter got completely out of kilter because he didn't agree with what was going on in the situation and we can do the exact same thing our response to God shows where we're at in that moment spiritually listen we can all get dried out we can all get frustrated the grind of Life the the struggles that we go through it seems like sometimes certain things never end and our attitude starts to build up in a way that it starts to correct God and it's not supposed to do that what is it we're supposed to be at rest in the time of a storm amen he's a shelter in a weary land he's a rock where we can go for support and and for shelter and these things and so we go we end up going away from that idea that God does all things well and all things work together for our good and we forget our position in him and therefore we try and move him to where we want him to be it's not supposed to be that way and with Peter we see these flashes of absolute Faith followed by absolute Carn it and it's the push and pull of Peter's Soul's Desire combating with his human nature and because he's unconverted he's more prone to the human nature than he is to the spirit of God and so he keeps falling flat on his face amen and so we see that Peter's been baptized by Jesus he's been ordained to minister by Jesus he's been uh Justified he's been Sanctified and yet Peter still doesn't have that anchor that he needs so that when storms rise up he can can sit still or when he doesn't understand something he can be quiet and just let things roll out and let God do what he wants to do and he just couldn't learn to be to be still in trust he just wanted to always be doing something you know Jesus said you know we're going to need some swords tonight here's a sword that's good Peter and then Peter uses a sword Jesus didn't want him using a sword but Peter in the moment because they Jesus said bring swords well that must mean he wants me to use the sword see he wouldn't sit still and let God show him what was supposed to go on and this we're going to look at one more little thing because we've got to see the negative before we can see the positive because if there's one thing the new birth is it ought to show a contrast there ought to be a difference between what we were before and what we were after and so I I'm not trying to beat Peter up but it's here for our admonition so we can learn and we can grow and we can even see ourselves in these things and we see in Matthew 17 remember Peter was part of that select group he's he's he's the trifecta uh of Jesus disciples him and John and Peter James and John were the three of them and it says and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up unto an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elisha talking with him and answered and then answered Peter so this Supernatural event is going on and Peter says unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here listen there's nothing wrong with saying I'm happy to be in the presence and seeing the supernatural but his response is now if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias now Peter has no revelation of what's happened here he's in the moment and he comes up with some good intention and he shares them with Jesus and it's a perfect example of what happens when an unconverted person has a supernatural experience and how they respond to it it Peter's seen the glorification of Jesus it's a prefigure of what's coming down he's had a a Heavenly experience in an Earthly unconverted condition and Peter gets all worked up about this he has no revelation of what happens he just knows it was tremendously important and so what he's saying here is he's saying let's commemorate this let's do something to to remind ourselves of what's happened on this mountain today Peter has the best of intentions here but we know good intentions aren't always right intentions he's got good intentions but none of them is acceptable to God and if Peter got his own way with his own choice and his own ideas his own ideas would have destroyed him right here it's a scary thing to look at listen to this he says now Peter got all inspired again remember remember the scripture says after 6 days Peter has just said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Peter had inspiration that was right after that he says to Jesus Lord forbid it that these come and Jesus said you are inspired by Satan now he comes along he says Peter got all inspired again question is who inspired him I don't doubt people are inspired church but the question is where's the inspiration coming from he says Peter got all inspired again and wanted to have a real Fellowship it's inspiration it's just not God's inspiration and he said let us build here three Tabernacles he was going to really have some Den minations he said now we're going to build one for Moses one for Elijah one for you we'll just have a segregation here we'll have three different churches and now we'll have three different denominations all represented here and Peter thought he was just doing fine when he did that we'd say what's the big deal brother John listen to what the big deal is okay this is a long series of quotes but I want you to catch this because remember our human nature is contrary to the spirit of God and so what ideas it comes with what intentions it comes up with might seem good but that doesn't make it right and he says now Peter said it's good for us to be here let us build three Tabernacles we'll build a seminary here for Moses we'll build a seminary for Elijah and all that want to worship under the law and so forth let them worship they look Peter and them watching Moses Moses represent the law God gave the children of Israel the law because they wanted the law God didn't want them to have it that's man's choice chice he says in Exodus 19 they said you give us something to do to Merit our Salvation we'll keep a law if you'll give it to us in other words he says but it never was God's plan and he says it's better just to quit planning yourself and just use his plan I find that much easier to take his plan they've had 14600 years of the law and what has It produced nothing nothing good religion bondage from Men hasn't done anything good and now Peter's saying let's build a tabernacle to commemorate that he says there stood Moses the law Peter said well some of us keep the law now there's no flesh justified by the law so next after God's law stood there the next that stood Was Elijah and Elijah represented God's justice the prophets he says in so much that Elijah pulled fire out of heaven and killed the 50 so Peter wanted God's law and God's justice so then while Peter was speaking wanting to build his Tabernacle and asked God if he could do it then they looked back and saw Jesus only so Peter's build trying to build up now a commemoration to the things that could do nothing for them except condemn them to death if Peter had his way he'd have divided the people into death and Justice Law And Justice he says there stood Jesus representing God's love not law not justice but in him was met the Fulfillment of of both Law And Justice this is my beloved Son he says no more self-made stuff he says listen to your tutor he says that's the reason Peter could say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God Law And Justice were met in Christ and it's God's love to the human race for God so loved the world and then he prays he says merciful god this morning as I plead for this audience we don't plead for law we don't ask for any law we do not want to be judged by our own Merit I do do not want your Justice Lord no not for your judgment to come upon me never Lord but I plead for your mercy he said hear ye him why should I hear him hear him he says he is the only one that has salvation Mary Joseph all the other saints were great people but only him hear ye him he's the only intercessor he's the only mediator between God and man is Christ Jesus that he says why do I hear him the law could not give me peace he can Justice could bring me nothing only condemnation he gives me peace and Reconciliation he said the law could condemn me because I get sick and the law requires that I have both both Law And Justice he says the laws of nature and the justice of God are executed upon me so I must pay the penalty but I turn my affections and my eyes this morning from both law and justice and look at the love of God who reconciled me back to him through Grace and not through law and through justice but through reconciliation he paid the price to bring man and God together to make them one now that's a long set of quotes but I wanted us to understand this this morning that when we take our own thoughts and apply them to spiritual events and the word itself we're going to produce something that separates us from God not that draws us back to God Peter would have bound the people for another thousand years why by splitting them into camps splitting them into groups and they'd have missed that there's only one way back and it's through Christ Jesus and they'd have been serving law they'd have been serving Justice self-justifying themselves by those things and getting nowhere he just set the church back another thousand years it's so easy to get caught up in the event in the moment in the anointing even but what comes immediately to our mind or to our hearts or to our lips in that moment may not be true inspiration from God just because it comes quickly does not mean it's God Amen we have to check it and we do that by waiting on him and checking against the word God's not in a rush Church God's not in a rush he'll make all things plain in his own time amen we must be yielded to the spirit not driving the spirit we're not here to use the spirit the spirit's here to use us and that's what Peter had forgotten see Peter's trying to make something happen instead of letting it happen God's way church we got to let God be God he is Sovereign he knows all things he's got the plan he's got the purpose he's got the power he's got all these things listen God doesn't do Supernatural events just to do them he does them with purpose and our purpose is to find his purpose in those things listen when we come to church and have a wonderful church service it's not about having a wonderful church service it's about finding what God wants for me and you in that moment so that his word can take hold of our lives and change us listen I think it's great that we can come in and be uplifted emotionally listen if we're if we go out sad I think something's wrong because even correction ought to encourage us you look at remember what brother Aon Oglesby preached a little bit about a camp he said thy rod David said thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now you look at a shepherd's Crook and a shepherd's staff the crook is for the Sheep the rod is for the animals that come after the Sheep so one is for their defense and one is for their training and teaching there's a little bit of both going on so when we go out of church and we've receiv received correction we ought to say praise the Lord because he only corrects his children but he encourages his children too and he shows his love and and his appreciation and his encouragement in these things so we ought not to walk outside every time these emotions are built into us for a purpose but not to control us not to determine these things amen so Peter thought that the best purpose out of this this this huge uh event on on this mountain would be to commemorate it with three Tabernacles amen and it wasn't God giving him those thoughts it was Satan trying to bind the church again that's a scary thought this is a man with signs wonders or day Ministry Justified Sanctified walking daily with Jesus and he's under a satanic inspiration and interpretation of the Transfiguration of Jesus Christ we have to be so careful church because in ourselves we can get caught up and Peter got caught up a little bit here amen emotion is just a response to something else amen it's not inspiration emotion is not inspiration and emotion will not hold us I'm not super emotional I've gotten more emotional as life goes on for some reason I trust it's the softening of the spirit that's what I'd like to think maybe not but I get more emotional as time goes on Amen but that won't hold us Supernatural events won't hold us what'll Hold Us is when the Holy Spirit anchors the word in our soul for eternity that's what's going to hold us and that's what Peter didn't have here ra says it this way he says I'm so sick and tired of seeing little petty Hollywood revivals so-called where people come in and get emotionally stirred up for a couple hours or a day or two or a week or two and go out and that's all of it we call it Camp syndrome right Revival syndrome where all you only have the victory for as long as the emotions and the feelings of that Revival are in you and then when it's gone guess what you're right back to where you were before that's not Revival that's emotional stirring it's a Hollywood Revival it's a pretend Revival it doesn't mean the spirit of God wasn't there it doesn't mean the true word wasn't preached but it means that you received a motion not an implanting of the word of God that anchored amen that's the difference he says brother you can be worked up by a Revival you can have emotion you can have good intentions all those things are fine but we don't need that today he says we need a baptism of the Holy Spirit to change the emotion and the intellect and the view the habits the life of the people and put them back on the right road again he says outside of a blood transfusion from Calvary all our reformations won't do any good at all and we see it with Peter Peter is the epitome of emotional religion he's so passionate he's so caught up he's so committed he has all the right words he's got the Zeal there and nothing seems to Anchor him down amen he's got tons of opinions tons of ideas tons of inspiration and it's rarely correct because he's so wrapped up in these things he means nothing but good but left to his own devices left to that inspiration Peter would lead himself to destruction and he'd led a bunch of other people with it as well church we are sheep we are sheep that's why we need a shepherd and sheep are the dumbest animals there are they can't defend themselves they can't lead themselves they can't feed themselves they need somebody watching over them 247 and from the pulpit all the way back we're all sheep we need a Shepherd we need a guide we need a guard we need somebody that can take us through amen this human nature this sheep nature it's destructive it's deceptive it's delusional all these things come on that's what we are in this human nature amen listen Peter's not an atheist Peter's not an Infidel Peter has been raised uh under the word of God serving the one true God and he's still getting it wrong it goes to show our parents raising us right is not going to settle us it's not going to Anchor us it's not going to give us the new birth we need a personal experience with Jesus Christ to settle our soul amen it takes that personal experience he says now many of them teach that just to come up and be recognized before the congregation and so forth as a sinner that you want to accept Christ as a personal savior that that is the new birth he says many believe that water baptism is the new birth and some of them believe that you're born of the water when you're baptized in the water and there's so many different versions of it lots of them many believe that to recite a Creed and Believe on a doctrine of a church just accept and say I believe in the holy church of Soo I believe God to be the savior of man and so forth and from this day on become a member of this church and fellowship with the Christians they believe that's born again he says he says and although the Creed that they reite I do not believe that they that we could criticize it some of them are pure and holy some of them are real scriptural he says but the scripture is not applied in the right place listen Satan preaches out of the Bible he just misapplies the scripture you say brother JN how do you know that because that's what he did with Jesus it is written and Jesus would say it is also written Peter's pre or Satan preaches straight out of the Bible Church but he twists it he misapplies it he says and even applying the scripture I believe that the new birth is something beyond that even though how well you might mean it I believe that the new birth is far beyond your good intentions and your thoughts and Minds he says it's beyond that you want a great example of that look at the Apostle Paul before he was converted Paul was a man that was taught by gel in the scriptures the greatest teacher one of the greatest teachers of that time Paul sat at his feet Paul learned the scriptures Paul applied the scriptures and in applying those scriptures with Zeal he persecuted Christ in the true church why under a natural influence not that of the Holy Spirit and that means it's satanic if it's not the holy spirit it's got to be satanic amen so Peter's been taught Peter's been trained Peter's been around the super Supernatural events of Jesus ministry he's had it operating through him and yet he is still not where he needs to be is Peter a child of God yes but Peter is not yet converted and that's what need needs to happen inside of his life and we see at the at the even the very end of Jesus Ministry in the Last Supper we see that Jesus pointing to the hardship and the difficulties coming ahead and we we see how how Peter just can't seem to get things right we read this last time and it said the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you his wheat remember in the old days when they brought in wheat they bring it in and it was attached to stocks you know you your wheat you know it stands about this tall when it's when it's healthy and and ready for Harvest and so they just go in and they they bind it in sheeps and they bring it in and they beat it with a stick to get all of the wheat kernels off but when they do that they get lighter portions that aren't good to eat it's called chaff and so what they do then after they've beaten it with a stick is they throw it up in in the air and they let the wind take away the lightweight stuff which is the junk and the kernels fall back down and that's the good stuff and Jesus is saying Peter Satan wants to take you and he wants to beat The Living Daylights out of you and then he wants you to throw you up into the storms of life and let him just scatter you that's what God that's what Satan wants to do remember what Jesus said the thief cometh not but to kill and destroy Satan has no good intentions for any of us if you're a child of God he definitely doesn't but even for his own children he has nothing good intended for you because he's contrary to God he says Satan this or Peter Satan wants to destroy you beat you up and then just leave you on the side of the road but I have prayed for thee Hallelujah that what thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren notice here what he says Peter does he say Peter that your courage fail not that your morals fail not no he says Peter that your faith fail not why is that church because Peter faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word and Peter has attached himself to the word of God long before this he said to whom else can we go thou Hast the words of life and his faith was there even if his courage wasn't there even if his strength wasn't there even if his discipline wasn't there Peter's Faith was there and so it's not Peter's Faith that's going to hold him it's the faith of God in Peter in his word that's going to hold Peter through this and he's he's he's prophesying to Peter he says Peter here's what I've done and here's the effect of that you're going to be converted and when you do Peter go strengthen your brethren and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death now did Peter mean this church I think Peter thought he meant it but Peter stirred up with emotion but when push comes to shove Peter's not going to do this Peter's not even willing to identify with him much less go to prison or death we've got to be careful how we say things we see here words are cheap words are cheap but it takes something in us to make it live and Peter's got all the bravado of a lion here and yet when the moment comes he's going to skull away like a little alleycat and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before thou Hast shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me I want to take us over to Matthew 26 because Matthew uh opens up this a little bit it says and Jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepher and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad Jesus is prophesying using the scripture that's already written and he says all of you is Jesus a prophet yes it's the word he's the word speaking the word what he says is true he cannot tell a lie now we see Peter flare up here sorry and then he says but after I'm risen again again I will go before you into Galilee so their failure is not going to stop him from coming back to them what a wonderful thing to hear you're going to fail but I'm going to still come to you he says but then je Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended brother Mark Here I Come Peter says Jesus this guy he's going to fail you sister Moren you're going to fail him brother Bob brother Bob sister Brenda they're definitely going to fail him sister Justine we already know you failed Him Sister Lydia it's coming brother Levi yeah right but me me I'll never do that can you imagine Church stabbing your fellow brothers and sisters in the back though they do it I won't do it I would never do that come on that's what Peter's saying Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples Les my favorite phrase delusions of Competency this is not about competency this is about commitment Peter is so delusional in his own strength I'll never deny you I'll die with you tonight before I deny you everyone says yeah me too [Music] right I love how Jesus comes back Jesus says nevertheless what I say is true he says but I'm going to take you through Peter I've already prayed you through Peter I'm not going to look at your failure I'm going to take you through and the work that I do because you turn me down it'll perfect you and it'll bring you to a place where you can actually live the word you're talking about Jesus held him to his words you'll notice it was just a little further down the road than Peter anticipated Jesus says Peter I God made a preparation for you I love that knowing our failures knowing the certainty of our failures he has a way prepared for every single one of us to make it through he said before the has throw three crowed three times you'll have denied me Thrice three times he said but Peter I pray for you he says listen that's not all of it see Satan will remind us of the failures he'll remind us of the things we don't do he'll remind us of the things we won't do he'll remind us of the things we can't do and Jesus says Peter it's true you're going to fail but that's not all of it let's hear the full counsel of God he says I have prayed for you and after you are converted then strengthen your brethren after you are converted he had shouted he had probably danced in the spirit he had done all kinds of things but he hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet and he said after you are converted then strengthen your brethren he says that's true carry out his plan I love how God can tell the truth about us even when it's not so great but he never leaves us in that condition and he says to Peter he says Peter when I'm done with you you'll be converted and when you're converted you go help people that are in the same condition you are right now Peter you go have patience for people that can't seem to get it right Peter you go have Grace for people that talk more way above where they live Peter you go have some longsuffering for people that can't seem to get it right he says because freely you've receed freely give Peter you go be me to them after you've been converted we all know the story that follows Peter is in the garden he can't even pray with Jesus he's the he's one of the three that Jesus pulls forward with them and he says hey come pray for me pray with me help me out here and they all keep falling asleep then when everybody comes and they arrest Jesus Peter draws out his sword and he cuts off the ear of the servant of the high priest Jesus heals it says Peter put it away whoever lives by the sword dies by the sword again completely in wrongly interpreting the situation and then they take Jesus to the high priest's home and Peter follows after Jesus and he's out there and he's by the fire trying to stay warm and three times people come up to him and they say hey you're a disciple of Jesus aren't you and he denies and he denies and he denies and in fact the third time the scripture says he curses and swears now that's not foul language like we would say today but in those days they would invoke a judgment from God to to to to make it uh abundantly clear that they were telling the truth so he might have said may God strike me dead if I'm a disciple of Jesus that doesn't sound like the Peter that said I'll go to prison end to Death will it he completely fails in the moment and the scripture says that as soon as he says that on the third time Jesus looks at him Jesus could see this and hear this going on the whole time and then Jesus looks at him and then the rooster cowls three times and what does Peter do he runs away and he weeps bitterly the scripture says completely demoralized all his Revelation all his passion all his excitement and all his signs and wonders and when push comes to shove and his life is on the line maybe he denies Christ completely Peter lost everything he thought he had at that moment this is a horrible horrible day for Peter he thought he was so great he thought he had it all he you know he he's going to have the keys to the kingdom he's got the Cornerstone the the foundational Revelation he's got signs and wonders and in one moment everything disappears and he's got nothing and he's out and he's hiding himself away from everybody scared to death total complete failure in his own eyes we see after this that Peter is scared he goes and he HS up in a room with the other disciples hiding from the Jews and the authorities because he doesn't want to be jailed or or killed and then the women come and tell him that Jesus is written risen and he doesn't believe that all faith is gone Church it would seem all Revelation gone but I want you to catch something because when the women are there and the angel speaks to them the angel gives them a message and remember an angel speaks as the Oracle of God angels don't speak of their own they come with a message so this is a Heavenly message that the Angels give the women and look at this amen I want you to catch this this is so beautiful and the angel said but go your way tell his disciples and Peter you know why Church because Peter didn't think he was his disciple anymore Peter thought he'd failed one too many times go and tell my his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee and there shall you see him as he said unto you I literally cried yesterday when I read that when I was studying because Peter has failed and failed and failed he's no doubt in the depths of Despair he's despondent he's wore out he's scared he's fearful he's helpless he's hopeless he's worthless he's lost and God sends him a personal message go tell Peter go tell Peter that his failures and his his absolute rejection of Christ has not stopped him he goes before you into Galilee Peter and he'll meet you there Peter what you have done will not stop him from coming to you again Peter made have thought he crossed the line he says make sure you let Peter know I personally called him out go there Peter I'm going to meet you it's going to be okay and yet even after that message Church Peter doesn't believe yet Peter gets a message from an angel and he disbelieves it he goes to the tomb and the scripture says he wonders about it he doesn't believe he's risen just goes to show Church even a message from almighty God won't do the dirt do the work it takes the holy spirit in our lives to Anchor us it's the only thing that'll do it finally after that we see that Jesus meets with him and the other disciples he spends 30 to 40 days with them and yet we see in all of that that Peter is reverted to his old way of life we would say Peter's backsliding he's forsaken his ministry he's forsaken the everything that had to do with Jesus ministry he's back fishing that's all he's doing he's fishing nothing to do with moving the gospel or the kingdom of God forward gave up on his ministry gave up on his his walk with Christ really I think Peter gave up on himself I keep failing I'm just not going to try anymore and so he went back to doing what he could only do fish you can see Peter's just beating himself on these things but yet in the end Peter is one of the 12 that's commissioned by Jesus to go forth and preach it's an interesting in thought to consider how much they' done in their Ministries and yet Jesus said but until you go and preach you've got to go and T they had done signs and wonders they had preached the gospel they' healed the sick they'd raised the dead they cast out demons and Jesus says you're not yet fit to preach this gospel listen they were fit to preach the past gospel but that was not the true gospel it was pointing to the message coming it was pointing to the true one their first one they preached by experience and it was of God God was in it God ano to them for it but Jesus says for this one you need a personal experience as well before you can preach this you got to know what you're preaching not up here you got to have it in here this is what he said in Luke he said and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it beho Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem it's that message of reconciliation we spoke about he says and ye are Witness of these things you have been you are and you're going to be Witnesses of these things they're going to have a personal witness not a hearsay witness it's God to be personal to them they have to experience it themselves he says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but te ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high there is no commentary here on Peter's mistakes Jesus is holding nothing against Peter Church why there's no expectation of conduct to an unconverted believer you're on your own it it's a personal choice day by day but you don't have power so he's not holding against them that they acted in a way consistent with not having power but he says you need power to move home from here you can't move on unless you have power amen he's saying Peter I still want to spend time with you Peter I still want to be with you Peter I forgive you and I paid your mistakes but Peter you need more than you've had before Peter you need to go get some power before we can move forward Jesus wasn't harboring a grudge against Peter so the only thing that could hurt Peter was Peter's issues with himself Peter needed that conscience Purge as brother Grant talked about Peter needed a cleansing of his soul so that he could move forward but I love how Jesus said to Peter Peter I prayed that your faith won't fail and we see here that Peter only has enough Faith to obey the word to take him to the upper room doesn't have faith to do anything else he only has Faith to take him to the upper room church that's all God has to give us is Faith for the step we're taking too often we're sitting here and we're looking forward to everything that's coming All the Troubles all the trials all the problems all the questions all the concerns and we're saying Lord I don't have faith for that but all he needs to give us is Faith for today to take the next step when we take that step he'll give us faith and life for the next step he has revealed the whole Plan of Redemption but he's only given them faith for the first part don't get ahead of ourselves church that's when we get ahead of God and we lose Faith because we're trying to do tomorrow to today what is going to be done tomorrow go and do what he's given you faith for today Peter just needed Faith to obey and then stay until God does the work and until then just stay awaited out amen your faith is just meant for this step this trial this question this concern this hardship Jesus just said obey my word and T have faith to T Peter and I'll do the rest of the work we know that Peter was with the 120 or the 119 others in the upper room that receed the spirit and we see this dramatic shift in Peter as soon as he comes down from that room cuz before this Peter was hiding out Peter was back to his old way of living he wanted nothing to do with Ministry he wasn't associated with Christ but we see that after Peter receives the baptism of the holy spirit in his soul not an anointing on him but an anointing in him we see this completely uh dramatic shift in his life amen and it's not that Peter doesn't have emotion or passion anymore like I said before Peter's got that Bulldog faith God made us passionate for a reason it's okay to be passionate but that isn't the driver that's not the lead it's not the guide amen I believe that God used Peter just as he was amen but Peter's not a loose cannon anymore anybody know what a loose cannon is it's a nautical term see in the old days they had these huge Wooden Ships these great battleships and they would have cannon on them but you have to realize that on a ship everything has to be tied down and so these these cannons they would ride in rails and they'd have ropes that would limited them so that when they fired the cannon it would rock back the ropes would catch it and it would stay in the grooves and then they winch it forward and then they reload it and they fire again but the thing is with a loose cannon when it fired the first time you might hit the enemy but the problem with the Loose Cannon is that one or two of the ropes had let go and it got out of the grooves and so now the cannon is rolling around in a ship that's doing this constantly so the first thing out of a loose cannon was you maybe hurt the enemy but after that it's rolling around the the the the the the ship and it's running over equipment and people and it was supremely dangerous you didn't want loose cannons on ships they could literally sink a ship one Loose Cannon and that's what Peter was before this sometimes he hit the mark but most of the time he didn't but Peter comes down from on the day of Pentecost church and Peter never misses the mark he hits it perfect every single time remember but we see even up in the upper room he was still a loose cannon remember what he did he drove the choosing of ma of Matias as the replacement Apostle for Judas and he completely forgot that God chooses the apostles not men Peter's still under that denominational influence that we see all throughout this he's still a loose cannon out there and poor Matias got put into a situation where he never thrived because he wasn't meant to be there he got tied in based on that Apostles decisions but then Peter comes down after he receives the Holy Spirit and he comes down from the upper room and he hits the mark perfectly because now Peter's under a new inspiration there's a difference now in Peter it says in Acts 2 it says and Peter standing with the 11 lifted up his voice see before this Peter wouldn't stand and be counted and recognized now he stands up with all of them and he said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seen it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoken by the prophet Joel Church Peter's gotten over his past Peter's not preaching about himself anymore Peter's not worried about himself he's saying we've received the promise and he takes them back into the word Peter's gotten over his fear of being identified with Christ Peter's gotten over his fear of being seen in public and identified with the message of the hour Peter's gotten over his worries about saving his life he's gotten over his concerns of what people will think about him too why Church why is Peter different because Peter went up into that room but Christ came down out of it it's not Peter anymore it's the spirit of Christ Living in Peter that is speaking now oh it's still in a body of flesh called Peter but there's a different voice there's a different inspiration there's a life inside of Peter that has to come out it's not Peter speaking now it's Christ speaking through him it's the spirit of truth that was promised to him coming down and Peter yielding to the spirit of Truth hits the mark every single time it's not Peter opening the word it's the spirit opening the word it's not Peter speaking it's the spirit speaking through Peter he's a yielded vessel rather than trying to do it on his own Amen brother Brown would say this he says but if you just try to do it you're going to fail and you have to fail that's the reason you have your ups and downs and ins and outs and all the things you're doing it's because you try to do it you you say oh I believe I'm all right now that isn't it he says no it's the holy spirit that comes in he takes the place he takes out all the old roots of bitterness the old anger the temper and jealousy and the love of the world of things takes it all out of you and then you're a new creature brother Grant had preached that that wonderful portion of that service on the purging of the conscience being required for Perfection amen I want you to consider this morning how far Peter had fallen from Grace if we could say it that way three times denied Christ swore and orth he wasn't part of his disciples went back to his old way of living disbelieved Christ have raised from the dead denominational thinking from start to finish almost and yet Peter comes down and he has had his conscience completely purged Church Peter wasn't hung up on himself anymore good or bad see that's the thing so often we want to be set free from the bad we've got to be set free from the good as well cuz Peter's good ideas and intentions were all contrary to the word of God Peter comes down and he doesn't have a thought in his mind of what he's going to do it is the spirit of God now flowing through him see Peter's been purged from his sin from his conscience but he's been purged from his dead works of trying to do it his way see you can be forgiven but you got to come into the yielding part as well that's part of the purging that's part of the Perfection amen and now Peter comes down and he's not just unburdened by sin but he's unburdened by his own stinking thinking that's what Peter needed power over was his own nature his own ideas his own thoughts his own appear his own opinions and now he's yielded to the spirit and Peter's been purged and in that purging he has stepped into Perfection not sinless Perfection yielded Perfection yielded Perfection he says what do you care what the world thinks what do you care what your neighbor thinks he says our conscience has died and we're regenerated and Born Again by the spirit of God to serve the true and living God we ought to be able to stand up and say I am a child of God I believe in Jesus Christ I believe he's the way the truth and the life and there is none other than him we need to be able to stand up and be identified Church we're going to be tested on that if you haven't you will be if you're a child of God Amen but we see here now Peter ain't a loose cannon Peter is a weapon in the hand of God it's not Peter Swinging The Sword it's God swinging Peter amen that's what we're talking about here and what is he doing he's got the it's it's the discernment of the word and it goes in and it sees where the people are at it sees the need and it brings a solution with them amen because Peter has not only caught the inspiration of the message he has manifested the very message that he's talking about see it's not about getting up here and preaching it's about getting up here and demonstrating that we have what we're talking about amen we are not to be talkers we're to be Walkers let our talk match our walk and Peter comes down Peter is not preaching Peter is the preaching Peter's had his conscience purged that's why he's preaching a reconciling message CU he knows the message of reconciliation Works cuz his conscience has been purged he knows that the power of the spirit is available not because it's coming but because it's here he has it he's a personal witness of these things amen he's pointing them back to Joel 2:28 and Ezekiel 36 and just like Jesus in his first sermon said this day this scripture is fulfilled Peter under the same anointing says this day is this scripture fulfilled we're in the word brothers and sisters we're in a time we're in a season where God is coming down to fulfill exactly what he said and he said listen you've been looking for this and you're looking for the Messiah and you missed him but you didn't stop him even when you killed him but he's come back in the form of the spirit to produce the word that he promised to us a thousand years ago this this day the scriptures fulfilled Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah he's saying he's wien today and he's here to live inside of you you killed him but he rose again and he's he will forgive you if you ask and he'll come in and he'll do exactly what he promised so many years ago Peter preaches the word under the true and perfect anointing of the spirit of Truth and he got a perfect result why he's yielded to perfection that's it we're going to get into this a little later Peter ain't perfect Peter ain't sinless in terms of his actions but he's yielded and that's the works of God Amen remember Jesus said the works that I do you shall do also and we showed that work was to fulfill the word for your day yes it involves preaching it involves teaching it involves healing it involves signs and wonders it involves gifts of the Spirit all these different things that that's part and parcel of a healthy church amen but to to f to do the works of Christ is to do what the word says you're supposed to do and every age has a certain thing they're supposed to do we see in Revelation 2 and 3 amen so wherever we are whatever our role is whatever our responsibility whatever our position each one of us has something we're supposed to be doomed for the kingdom of God and in doing that we are doing the very works of Christ not everybody's going to lay hands on people and they'll be healed but some will some will encourage some will raise children some will help others raise children some will preach some will teach some will handle Sunday school they'll have offices in the church some will be evangelists out in the community but every single one of us will do the works of Christ because we'll do what the word says we're supposed to do in our role amen doesn't mean we don't battle doesn't mean we don't fight but it means we have victory in those things and I want you to see the victory in Peter because we're talking about a true conversion here this morning and I want you to see the difference because before Peter was Brave with Jesus but as soon as he's gone he becomes a coward Peter would stand on water but then the situation would overcome him Peter would declare his intentions to stay close to God but then as soon as times get tough then Peter just Falls like a limp noodle he has no consistency he has no strength Peter couldn't hold himself to what he said he believed and I believe he believed it but he needed power to make it work that's all that's all but now he comes out of a new birth experience in the upper room filled with the spirit and watch Peter's attitude and actions now so Acts 2 he's gone through acts Acts 2 and preach to them 3,000 Souls saved now in Acts three it says now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother womb mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seen Peter and John about to go into the temple asked in alms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk he says and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones Reed strength now a lot of the people people in the in in Christendom wrestle with this scripture today because they say that is a power that was only given to the apostles they say it's not here today well they say that because they don't have that experience in their church but I want you to consider that the power of healing is not what we're talking about because Judas had this power Judas had power to heal so if they're saying that power is only for the apostles they've got a problem because Judas was the son of predition a false pretended brother and he had power to heal but what is it it's power to yield Jesus said you'll do the same works I do and Jesus said I do nothing except the father shows me first Peter is not going around after the day of Pentecost Peter see Peter before would have went on a Revival high and he would have went and he would have healed everyone in Jerusalem today Peter goes the day after the greatest Revival in Jerusalem Peter goes out and how many people does he heal one why he's yielded he's yielded there is a time where they heal everybody but this is showing the yielding of Peter not the personal wielding of power that everybody thinks it was this is showing the how specific God works and we'll see here that the reason is is because they're going to look for something to to go after these disciples for and this is it it's a public Miracle at the temple everybody knows this guy he's been there 40 years and what is it it's God bringing attention to these disciples to the ministry of reconciliation amen it's not Peter healing now it's the Holy Spirit working through Peter telling him what to do when and what and how and Peter obeys because it's the same thing that Jesus did because it's the same spirit it's got to work the same way and just as they criticized Jesus for healing and for what he did they did the same to Peter and John in Acts 4 and they pull him in front of the Jewish religious Council and watch this change now we're talking about a true conversion it says and they laid hands on them and put them in the hold until the next day for it was now even tied so they put him in their own prison but watch Peter's response now in the face of criticism I jump to verse eight here it says so they they they went after him and and these things it says then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of the E of Israel if you let us go we'll never do this again please don't kill me no that's what Peter would have said before he says if we do this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is made whole he's saying if we're if if this is all about us healing this guy and you're wondering how it's done here's your answer be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand before you hope Peter ashamed of Jesus Christ now he says if you have any question about what's gone on it's all down to Jesus Christ who you crucified by the way Peter's got his boldness now he said this is the stone which was said at not of the builders which has become the head of the corner see before Peter had this Revelation remember the Cornerstone the foundational Revelation now he's preaching it because he knows what it really means now he says neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness the same Peter that we used to know the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were wow in unlearned and ignorant men they marveled why because they were not unlearned and they were not ignorant and they had nothing that Peter had and they're sitting there saying how in the world does he have what I can't get after all my decades and Decades of study says and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus Peter had denied Jesus now Peter identifies himself with Jesus church did you ever notice Peter hasn't done anything here he doesn't hasn't done before but now they finally take notice of him why it's a different Peter it's a different Peter now amen it says but when they had commanded them to go outside of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable Miracle have been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we can't deny it they said listen and everybody knows this is a miracle but that it spread no further upon the people let us straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus so here's the challenge now Peter is backed down three times before this refused to be identified and now they say listen if you do this we're going to kill you what's Peter going to do but this is a wonderful butt because it's showing a difference between the past and the present it says but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken to you more than to God judge ye he's putting them right in their place and he's saying listen we answer to a higher power than you he says for we cannot notice it's not will not we cannot it is impossible for those that have received the spirit to recant their faith we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard Jesus said ye are witnesses they'd seen it they'd heard it they'd experienced it they got it they weren't going to give it up because somebody said you can't do it anymore he says so when they have further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorify Peter for that which was done no no no no no for all men glorify God for that which was done what do you see these Trends today with all these prophets me me me me me where's the giving the glory to God people are LED down the path blind leading the blind but the the glory the honor and the praise went to the right person here it said and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord see they didn't sit down and say Brothers what shall we do church when you realize you have access to the throne of Heaven you'll start using it we have a place to go for answers this morning I'm not saying God doesn't use brothers and sisters but as a group they came together they said here's where we're at and in one Accord they went to the throne of grace it said they lifted their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is he said and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy word what is their request church God save us God changed the circumstances God don't have them kill us no their prayer is God give us boldness to do what you've told us to do they're not pleading for themselves they're saying Lord don't let my courage fail don't let this body fail in doing what you told us to do before they were running away trying to preserve themselves now they're saying Lord preserve us to your purpose rather than to our comfort they had lost all fear of death they lost all fear of rejection they said just give us boldness to keep doing what we're doing by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by thy name of thy holy Child Jesus they're saying Lord ratchet it up let us do more for you if this causes problems let's keep causing the problems according to your kingdom will he says and when they had prayed the place was sh Shake him where they were assembled together that's what happened the first time church this is just a couple days later a couple days later and they're having the same experience they had on the day of Pentecost and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness they got exactly what they asked for because what they asked for was the will of God that's it they weren't asking for God to make life easy they were asking God to take him through let us keep doing what you've asked us to do and so we see Peter after this and Peter speaks with boldness remember they take him into the eventually they they they chain him up in the inner hold and he's got multiple doors to go through multiple sets of guards he himself is is Chained down and the angel of the Lord comes down blinds the guards opens the door sets him free from his chains and he walks out why God's got a purpose God's got a plan and circumstances change at his at just a touch of his can church and Peter's learned to trust but we see Peter as he starts to step into his ministry and remember what Jesus said he said Peter I'm going to give to you the Keys of the Kingdom what are the Keys of the Kingdom Church acts 238 it's the path of Salvation repent and be baptized for the REM repent uh and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit that's the keys to the kingdom and we see Peter opens up that door to eternal life with the Jews on the day of Pentecost and then he goes down to the Gentiles and he opens it in the key the key to the kingdom to Cornelius and then he goes down to Samaria eventually and he opens that to the to the mixed Believers to the ones that are half Jew and half Gentile and so he's opened up the doors to the entire world at that point but before that nobody could go preach somewhere and somebody get the Holy Ghost unless Peter came first until he went to those three separate groups and after that anyone could preach the word and as long as it was the true word and accepted by faith people could get the Holy Ghost but nobody got the Holy Spirit until Peter went and unlocked that key that door with that key but I want to read a quote here and I've read this before when we are St talking about um um you know going God's way I forget um I forget the what I had as had as the title but I want to hammer this down as we're nearly done today remember Peter was praying on his roof and the Holy Spirit said hey there's some men coming go with them and so Peter did exactly that and and he's going with the Gentiles and we have to realize something that Peter has had a lifelong aversion to Gentiles they are his persecutors they they are the ones that put them in bondage remember it was ceremonially unclean for Peter to go into a gentile's house and so these Gentiles come to his door and the Holy Spirit says Peter go with them and Peter goes to them and he says to Cornelius he goes into the house doesn't want to go in the house he's unclean as soon as he steps in by all of his religious training and he says to Cornelius what am I supposed to do what do you brought me here for said well I had a vision it said go get you and that you would lead us to Salvation And so Peter preaches the word Peter does exactly what he's been doing with everyone else and he says and while he was yet speaking the Holy Ghost fell on those Gentiles then he said can a man forbid water that the should not be baptized he said see it's still the guide speaking not Peter it was the Holy Spirit the guide on the day of Pentecost and it's still the Holy Spirit speaking to these Gentiles it's not Peter he says because that was a bunch of gentiles they were unclean and dirty to him it says and he didn't even want to go we're talking about a true conversion a true conversion church is going to make us uncomfortable in this flesh against everything we've been raised up in everything we want to do everything we like to do we're going to go to people we don't like we're going to do things we don't really want to do he says but the guide said I'm sending year you he says you do things you don't think you would do when the guide gets complete control and when you let him guide you see sometimes we want to do something see it's not just that he makes us uncomfortable in doing things we don't want to do in this flesh but sometimes we want to do things and he says no and we've got to be uncomfortable and say okay even with our good intentions even with our good thoughts he says oh how wonderful it is to be led by the Holy Spirit he's the god guide he said he spoke through Peter and told him what he must do then when they all received the Holy Ghost he said we can't forbid water seeing that these have received the Holy Ghost like we did at the beginning and they baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus he says now who led him to do that wasn't Peter's will wasn't Peter's desire wasn't Peter's Direction he said it was that gu that was in him he says didn't Jesus tell them take no thought what you're going to say because it's not you that speak it's the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the speaking I want to close on a high note this morning and I thank you for your patience but I want you to see how great this change was in Peter because church when God wants to use you he's going to use you and he's not going to just use you as a little wimpy thing he's going to give you a backbone he's going to let you stand on the two your two feet on the word of God and he'll do something through you and he'll let you do things and he'll have you do things you never thought you could do you may not even want to do but he'll do a wonderful work amen God's going to take us through the trials of this age and the trials of this life and he does it by setting us on Wings of Faith we're under an eagle anointing now that lifts us up above those things that carries us through those things and so just like Peter wasn't held back by religious Traditions or family traditions or cultural Traditions God's not going to let those things stop us either God's not here to let these little things these little isms these little ideas that we have hold us back he'll break him the holy spirit will break him cuz he's molding us into His Image but I want you to see Peter's final condition Peter the coward Peter the denier Peter the backslider Peter the failure Peter the satanic stumbling block okay do we have a good picture of what Peter started out as Church religious and all of those things okay acts 5 it says and by the hands of the Apostles remember they prayed at the ends of Acts four end of Acts 4 and they said Lord just magnify your work here's what happens and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and the rest D no man join in and of the rest D no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women what a wonderful thing but I want you to catch this okay this is the end result of Peter the horrible Peter the failure listen to this in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the city cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one is God held back by our failures Church Peter is so full of the spirit of God that the sun shining on him and casting a shadow on a person will heal them that's what God think of our failures he can take an imperfect flawed and cracked vessel and turn it into a Powerhouse of the Holy Spirit one quote one scripture he says I can see that old fisherman Church we've got no excuses this morning for how little we are without a grammar school education couldn't even sign his own name an ignorant and unlearned man with so much God in him till the people passing through the streets wanted his shadow to pass over them everyone was healed he says why God in his people hallelujah God in his people where are Peter's failures in that where's Peter's Denial in that where's Peter's rejection in that where's Peter's backsliding Church purged it's in the see of God's forgetfulness never more to be remembered amen look at this Paul said to Timothy if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself amen God bless you let's stand this morning why did Peter make it through church remember what Jesus said Rejoice not because the demons and devils are subject to you but Rejoice because your names are in the book of Heaven Peter's name was written down in the book of Heaven Before Time Ever began and so when Peter failed God wasn't looking at Peter God was looking at that name and that name was a part of his word and Peter was ordained from that moment to eternal life and so when Peter denies God what's God looking at Peter no he's looking at the word he says I've still got to get him to eternal life when Peter turns down when Peter backslide when Peter seems to have failed in every way God's not looking at Peter God's looking at the word and he says even though he denies me I can't deny him because I've tied him to me through my word his name's in the Lamb's Book of Life Peter's ignorant and unlearned church and he writes two books of the New Testament he's so full of the Holy Ghost that his shadow passing over a person can heal them you talk about a difference you talk about a contrast this is a man that used to hide in the shadows and now he's standing out there for all to see and declaring a living Christ amen that's what a true conversion is to declare Jesus Christ is alive and well today not dead Creeds not I'm a member of a church I'm a member of him I'm a part of his body I'm a part of his bride and I'm an example of what he does when he takes a vessel and he fills it with himself amen I think it's so beautiful that we can look at a man like that so completely flawed so completely diluted in his own capabilities and God could turn him into one of the greatest men of the scriptures amen what can he do with you this morning I'm just a little this or that doesn't matter he's attached himself to you and he's got a work for you to do he's got a promise attached to your name this morning and he's going to do it and all he's doing is saying will you just believe me just take that next step just do that next thing I'm telling you to do say what I've told you to say be where I've told you to be sit still like I've told you to sit still and just rest and trust that my word will produce what it says in your life amen God bless you this morning let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord it humbles us this morning Lord to know that you have condescended to live in a converted person Lord that a working of your word by your spirit can take these flawed and hopeless and worthless vessels Lord and turn them into vessels of Honor fit for your service Lord and it's not that we're fit in ourselves Lord but it's your presence that makes us fit it's the presence of the spirit that confirms to us Lord the Perfection of your work Lord you're the one that says we're perfect you're the one that says we're sinless you're the one that says we're spotless Lord I pray you help us to realize that if we'll yield to you you'll do a wonderful work Lord if we'll rest if we'll trust if we'll wait on you Lord you'll bring us all the way through Lord I pray if we've Fallen not if Lord Lord I pray that where we've Fallen Lord that all we need to do is recognize our repentance Lord and come right back to you Lord you're not looking at us you're looking at Christ Lord and you're not looking at our acts you're looking at the action you took before the foundation of the world to write our names in The Book of Life Lord I'm so thankful this morning we've heard your voice I'm so thankful we've received your word Heavenly Father Lord I pray you help us to dwell on it day by day Lord Lord that we would see the working of your spirit to make it live in US day by day Lord for those that need to take a step forward for those that need to commit their lives truly into your hands Lord and have a Pentecostal experience of being filled with the spirit Lord I pray you help them to do that Lord Minister now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen he has forgiven me 958 I think we might have a and then we go into my chains are
