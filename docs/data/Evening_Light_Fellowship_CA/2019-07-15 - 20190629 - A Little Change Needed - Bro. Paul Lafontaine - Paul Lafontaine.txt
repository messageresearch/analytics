heart for us to hear so being prayer for him as he comes was him being unto me according to thy word amen we had the same spirit that that Mary had she was willing to subject herself to God to let him have his way amen praise the Lord and Jesus himself his one brother said he was meek and he was lonely and yet he had all the power of heaven and that's where we have to come to I believe that we talked about it at dinner the other night with brother Paul we talked about subjection and humility the things that are most needed and to be able to be like Christ they have all the power of heaven within us by grace the power of the Holy Ghost within each and every one of us so may God minister to that need tonight through brother Paul so let's sing that be it unto me according to your word and he will come [Music] the truth [Music] [Music] praise the Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord greetings in the name of the Lord tonight it's good to be in the presence of the Lord and hear the good singing and really was blessed by the children tonight I think they really blessed us with the scriptures and also there are wonderful spirits and out of the mouths of babes we have that purity of worship and when we can all learn from them Kenway Amen just that believing in the Lord praise the Lord well it's a joy to be with you again tonight we're going to come and sing a few songs if it's okay with you and sister Kimberly has helped us out last night and she had a song that she wanted me to play for her and I wonder she wanted to do that tonight first and then we can sing a couple there with my wife a man she had a wonderful song that she wanted to do so I'll be glad to play for her she's done so much for me through the years as my secretarial duties that she used to help me with at the church and so I'll be glad to help her tonight in this special amen you love the Lord tonight praise the Lord [Music] the city was Jerusalem the time was long ago the people called him Jesus the crime was the law of his shoe and I'm the one to blame [Music] I caused him all this pain he gave himself the day he wore he brought me a love that no one else could give and I brought him cause to cry and though he taught me how to live I taught him how do you do and I'm the one to blame I cost him all this pain he gave himself the day he my crown he could have called him holy father instead take me away won't you take me away he could have said not guilty so I'm gonna stay I'm not gonna pay but he walked right through those gates and then on up that hill and as he fell beneath the weight he cried and I'm the one to blame I caused him all that pain gave himself the day he won't my crew so I'll sing it with me till my trophies [Music] someday [Music] hallelujah

man you make us feel comfortable praise the Lord and we hope we make the Lord feel comfortable [Music] a little bit faster here the song the Lord gave me oh my many many years ago it's called I'm ready to move and sister Rebecca and I were living in this house and so the neighborhood kind of got bad we had quite a few things that happened in the neighborhood and so we don't looked at want to know one another one day and said I think we're ready to move they decide to go so during the time we were making the process of move and I said that's a good thought for a song because you can move from neighborhood to neighborhood and is still not good enough for the believers were we're ready to move to another place that's when the Lord gave me this song well this world a never get snow bad seems like I've been here forever seems the same so it's time to be a Pingo [Music] change relocation [Music] everything bad I need is an order ready now to cross the board to a bad new country right I hold a little revelation despacio translation [Music] [Applause] [Music] relocation [Music] the Holy Ghost here to prove when I'm ready to move I've got the Holy Ghost here to prove that I'm ready to move oh my god the Holy Ghost here to prove [Applause] me man praise the Lord hum he's ready to go tonight a man getting tired of this old world Amen we belong to another place from another country I was born for another country and I'm looking forward to that time the chains of the body praise the Lord we're excited about it and becomes more real every day doesn't it praise the Lord well let's stand to read the word tonight and just spend some time in the Word of God we once again want to say for thank you for your hospitality and we just enjoyed the fellowship and I know I'll enjoy it the rest of the weekend and that we bring you greetings from our church there at home and I'll be having service tomorrow and we're looking forward to what the Lord has for us here praise the Lord and nice to meet all the new folks here tonight that's joined us may God bless you we hope to get to shake your hand and we know that we feel right it comfortable with the message of the last days and what God is doing for us can you say man and no one minister no one minister in this message has a full handle on all things to bring the bride to perfection it takes a five full ministry no one minister understands at all god set it up probably to keep us humble can you say Amen but it's not one-man show can you say Amen but it's a fivefold ministry bringing the bride to perfection so I'm just a portion of that tonight but I want to be faithful in my portion I want to be faithful to put my shoulder to the wheel with brother Gerald was ministered for so many years here and been faithful to the message of the hour and so part he's part of the fivefold ministry I am and the brothers you've been having in and so we're just here to serve the Bride of Christ but it is an important place the fivefold ministry is so crucial important to us as the scripture said in Ephesians to bring the people to perfection can you say Amen so we need the fivefold we don't need the counterfeit but we need the real true faithful ministry working underneath the headship of the Prophet God sent for this day and preaching that message we would have no message of our own we have no contribution of our own but were to be faithful to what God has brought through his prophet and we realize God always uses live ministry always live ministry until when the Prophet brings the word then he leaves the fivefold ministry God called men to bring the bride to the place she needs to be so we're here tonight to help out with that I want to read from first samuel tonight chapter 1 and we're going to speak a little bit and continue a little bit last night we took the expectation of mature sons and we trust people that we need to be according to the Word of God and we don't want to be under false expectations or misled under expectations that are not of God but we do want to be expecting the real expectations of God of what's coming and what where he's taking us in our lives we want to be under expectation for that constantly amen so first samuel chapter 1 and you remember last night in speaking about that we were speaking of the two final stages of adoption and there's two final stages according to romans that we read last night and that is the one that's obvious the one that gets preached about quite often and we're just saying about it is the rapture that's the final adoption that's the final adoption to wit Paul says in other words we're looking to that day when that's the final take change of the body but we realized a few scriptures before last night that he said the manifestation of the sons of God and that is related to something we come to before the rapture and that is that all creation is waiting for not just the rapture but also for sons to take their position in a maturity can you say man so that's why our expectations are of mature sons and maturing and becoming the sons on this earth that God needs us to be burning all the immaturity is out of us so last night I was saying that we often hear a lot about the second part of adoption in the rapture but we don't hear a lot of sermons about the manifestation of the sons of God and what that really means and that's why I preached it last night because my expectation is see my life and the people of my church come to a place of maturity in the Word of God that we're no longer as I love the picture that brother read last night and I didn't get to that scripture but it fits in so perfectly leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ we move on can you say man he that uses milk and the word is unskillful in the Word of God so as the Prophet said we need a church to come to maturity so that she's ready to be able to handle things and be under Dominion in this life over the domain that God has given us so it's one thing to preach about us one thing for you say to say Amen but what either desires we really get contrite before the Lord and say Lord take all the immaturity zout of me because you need a parameter individual towards the Word of God that's what you need there's enough immature people there's enough people in Christianity that are immature there's enough babies sometimes even around the message they just want to be babied this one say while I'm in a message church I'm fine listen we got to grow out of that God's wanting us to take our position so just like we hear messages on that part of adoption rapture rather than manifested sons tonight I'd like it to take it deeper and I want to speak on the little change needed and we realized that that that fits as well because the change that's talked about a lot is the rapture the change of our bodies but I'm going to show us tonight through Hannah here in the Bible and other women of the Bible if I have time that there were just before the promise came to pass the full promise there was a little change needed in their lives so it's not the big change I want to talk about the little change and sometimes little changes are just as important as the big ones what's happening your life now is isn't very important to contribute to going in a rapture so want to speak about a little change needed a little change needed and so we begin here in 1st Samuel chapter 1 there was a certain man of Rama the afem of mount ephraim and his name was Alcona and the son of jerem in the son of Elah who the son of tahoe the son of zu and aphrodite and i'll read his name again cuz we heard so many names there but the name of this husband is al Qaeda and al Qaeda had two wives the name of one was Hana and the name of the other was pnina and pnina had children but hannah had no children and this man went up out of his city to her yearly to worship and to sacrifice under the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of elephant and phineas the priest of the Lord were there and when the time was that out Kenai offered he gave two pennant Penta his wife and to her sons and daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave up worthy portion was a double portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore to make her fret which means to worry because the Lord had shut up her womb and as she did so year by year she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat and then Alcona her husband said to her his wife why weepest thou why are either stile not why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than 10 sons so Hannah rose up after a head she had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli the priest set up a seat by a post to the temple of the law of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and she vowed about and said O Lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget that had made but will give unto thy handmaid a man-child she'd ask that every year now she had asked that that's the that's the same request every year but something now has happened if you give me the child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there show no razor come upon his head so it's the same prayer but it was more to it this year and so a little change was needed her prayer changed her attitude changed let's pray Heavenly Father we pray that you'll anoint the word tonight we pray father that you'll help us to get out of the way Lord God the songs of Zion has been sung the children have sung to us Lord God I'm glad to be gathered in a place Lord the company of the Lord and the Bible even says the company of angels are around us and Lord this is the most important place to be here tonight there isn't a place in this city or this this province that would be more important than to be right here Lord where you could meet with your people and God I pray that we'd be a vessel used of you tonight we pray you move every hindrance out of the way and Lord help our minds and hearts to receive your word in Jesus name Amen now I bless you want you to shake somebody's hand before you take your seat and greet them say god bless you praise the Lord now saints of God we want to look at this section of Scripture here and I've ministered some of these things in other places you may have heard me but I want to bring it in line with our series this weekend and talking about the change that's needed in our lives and also the maturity that we come to and it's when I begin to speak of Hannah tonight and if we have time I'd like to go into Esther as well this is only two women out of the Bible that the Lord led me to when I studied this because there was a minister who come through our church you know I like to get fed too sometimes and we have ministers in and sometimes the word can just break open sometimes through these brothers I had a brother come through and he dealt with the subject of humility and he said many good things about the level that there were I can't remember all he said but he was taught us that there were levels of humility in every human being but there are levels of humility that the bride comes to that is not for the rest of the world there's levels of humility you know it takes humbleness for someone to give to the United Way to give charity to give up some of their money and give the charity so they may not be even a Christian but it takes a certain humility to give that money can you say mad but but I do believe that God's calling for a deeper humility in us and so when he broke that open then I begin to search and look at the different women of the life as you know of the Bible we you know when you study the women of the Bible there's a mystery behind the women of the Bible of the Old Testament for the bride of Jesus Christ and you begin to look at these women's life and you see God's writing the mystery of the bride and these women and so when I did it I begin to study several of them and I discovered that there was something that happened in many of them and that is before the promise that God gave them before it was manifested before it came to its climax before it came to the time that they wanted to come to it quite often you see in these women a greater level of humility that they reach in their lives in order to trigger the us to bring it to pass and I begin to look at that same I praise God look at that little action there look at that little action there and every one of them there was some small action that they did that in order to trigger the promise it brought it into motion and brought the promise to pass so it's along with brother Gerald said to us last night at the end he says you know God we're not waiting on God God's waiting on us he's given his promise can you save the Holy Ghost is here to make it come to pass so God's waiting on us so we need to look at our lives and say Lord I know I'm a believer I know I believe I'm a predestinated believer before the foundation of the world I'm serving you I'm worshiping you I loving you I'm serving you every day but Lord if there is anything that's lacking in my life that would hinder bring in this promise to pass god I pray you'll deal with my life and that's what the bride in humility is saying because we can just stay status quo believers and say I'm in the message and it's good enough but the bride the true bride is saying I want something deeper than that amazing to see these women and so now I'm just going to go into one or two of them tonight for lack of time although I will remind you that my my batteries in my microphone are for eight hours as the brothers have reminded me and then they said they go out to the store and buy more batteries if needed so that's gracious in it is I told don't tell too many preachers that you'd be in trouble praise the Lord but you know and then they said they might get some redbull or something to go along with it which I may need I'm kind of tired this weekend but but you see now as we look at this hand let's take an of first now there are two wives of this man L cannot and right away we catch that that we can bring it up and show in the last days there's there's two groups within the Christian Church how many believe that the Bible teaches that there's two groups within the Christian Church as we find the Bible teaches and you can call it that I guess the most obvious thing is there's a foolish virgin there's five foolish virgins five wise virgins and they're virgins can you same in there they're Christians but one five have oil five don't have oil and so we realized that all of a sudden we really see a picture of the church now there's some within the church that are there there's two groups within the church but you see now when we bring it - Hannah Hannah buy predestination had a different purpose than al-qaeda's other wife Hannah had a deeper purpose can you say men so now if you watch it now she has a desire to have a child but she was not just gonna bring forth any child her child was a child of promise she was gonna bring forth Samuel so now we watch that Hannah even though she's a believer she has a purpose on her life she's there with her husband her husband loves her more he got all these factors going on but she's lacking bringing forth a child when the other when the other woman is bringing forth children she is not bringing forth any it would appear like she needs to be one-to-one to bring it forth and she goes into this very depressed mode to say lord I don't know what's happening I'm praying every year I want a child I want a child but you see now she didn't realize the purpose God had for her life is that there was a timing to this you're not supposed to bring forth just anything you're not like other women you're not like the rest of Christians out there you're not supposed to bring forth what they're bringing forth you're supposed to bring forth upon the Sun can you say that and that's why saints of God we cannot compare ourselves with the rest of Christendom I don't mean to get a pride to say we're matter we're not any better except for about the grace of God but you do need to realize don't compare yourself with them out there don't even compare yourself with a person sitting next to you God has a special calling on your life and the promise come into your life may take longer than what we see out there sometimes you look at the churches out there in these mega churches and all these other things and they grow to great numbers and you're looking so my look how blessed they are and look at all these numbers coming in to Christianity and they got so many thousands they bring to the Lord and sometimes you look at our little places you really whoa what's going on what's taking place here and you start to compare yourself and why is all that happening they have the same Bible that we have they believe then Jesus as well you understand and so you look at all that in your season looks like they're bringing forth they're bringing forth they're bringing forth and yet we're holding on to quite a different promise here and this cannot happen by man's orchestration this what God has given us through the message cannot just be humanly doubt dabbled with this has to come in your life in God's time so you cannot compare yourself with all these people and tonight I want you to know that I feel just as brother branham did I don't de Christianize anybody anytime God has dealt with somebody I say praise the Lord I'm not here to say that and I say the way the Prophet said it's not the people and denominations I believe they're sincere and they believe everything they know can you say it's the systems of denomination so don't ever think we're better than the people because they're sincere hearts like we are you see but you see now we at the same that we cannot compare ourselves but with what God has to bring forth from them is different than what a believer is in this hour and this is the part that Hannah couldn't catch because she went every year to the temple praising and worshipping God and and I should say in burden before God saying Lord I just want a child I want to have a child I want to bring forth but you see now as we move along in this story Hannah desired a child like any other wife would want a child but God chose her for more than that if you don't get anything else tonight I want to let you know brothers and sisters no matter who you are even our children God chose you for something more don't you ever forget that don't compare yourself with others God chose you for something more and it was more than just to have what she was to bring forth was not just another baby but to bring forth a profit the promise of that age she is supposed to bring for the promise of the hour the promise of the age and many of the women who typed the bride in the Old Testament didn't know if you ever studied this but many of the women in the Old Testament who typed the bride were barren while others around them were bringing four children Sarah Baron rebecca baron rachel baron they'll type the bride and there that their wounds are closed they're not bringing forth a and they're standing watching all these concubines or these handmade so whatever else it was and there may have in all kinds of babies babies babies these kind of like my church right now babies babies babies coming around it's just amazing I say bring them on praise the Lord will grow the church some way and then Paul and Kimberly came down and now baby here I guess it was in the water or something I don't know what you see but these women stood there bare and before God they couldn't bring forth and yet they're the chosen one as their brother said many are called but few are chosen and they're standing there having to watch others be blessed oh there's prosper I just had children when they're saying God's Eric right well why can't I bring forth it and then she even tried to inject your own ideas Abraham go go with Hagar and all that taking place according to to her own will can you say man and so yeah and you can't fault Sarah for that she had a promise she knew there was gonna be a promise she she news was so you can't fault her witch for trying saying Lord is supposed to come forth but yes according to God's will it's according to his way and it's according to his time but also it's according to the attitude and this woman where she comes to that all God now he's got the promise when he speaks it it's gonna happen but we want to take a look at ourselves tonight is everybody on board look at these women Sarah Rebecca Rachel there was a delay sometimes with them there was a delay in the promise there was it in between time there was a seventh seal in the suspense between life and death it seemed like a millennium I'm Colton brother Brandon from the seventh seal there there was a delay there was an in-between time and so for them at that time as I was saying last night is a very suspenseful very can be a very scary time it can be a very burdened time because you're seeing there's things to take place in our lives and bring forward the promise that we're not seeing all that yet and so we get a little anxious we get burdened but you see now there was a delay in the promise all these women but it had to come according to Doug on its promise not anything manufactured don't forget that the desire for women to have a baby in the Old Testament and even today if she's a normal woman the desire for a woman to bring forth a child in the Old Testament that held a mystery in it within itself can you say man the craving for those women to carry on the seed the godly seed was so intense that they were willing to do anything sometimes to carry that seed he wasn't just a lot of those women wasn't just having a baby it was there was some spiritual thing guiding them they wanted to carry the seed on and Tamar look what she was willing to do to carry that seed on so there's a mystery even behind the women that want to have a child to bring forth the right seed even know well I know women today brother Graham says they're gonna mother a dog and they're gonna mother a little thing a little snotty little dog and they've lost motherhood they don't have babies anymore brother Brett said they want to practice this and so they don't have to have these little snotty kids and so that's what happened to women but a true genuine woman there's a desire in her that God put in her to bring forth the child there's some sisters they're just not able and we pray and sometimes sisters and then though they will dump someone that's that's all fine that's only but you see even if she doesn't have a child God put within her a desire why you put that in there because for a woman bearing a child brings kind of a completion feeling to them like nothing else for a woman there's a fulfillment to Brady's Peter god there's a completion to it the prize Jesus Christ we've been serving the Lord all these years listen to this thing there's a craving can you say let this thing come to its completion I bring forth Christ and Paul said I travail in birth with you until Christ before me I'm fixing to have a good time tonight we don't have any other place to go we're going to just sit right on these things in ministry each one so praise the Lord the sirens are running here out here now notice Hannah is there's a fire start here that's why you're here siren there's a fire starting up in this building somebody say praise Allah notice now Hannah she's a doubly blessed woman she has a double portion for her husband he has another wife and she's bringing four kids but he loves Hannah more and he keeps certain portions to them and her kids but she give a double core so this is the bride how important it was I'd like a double portion on a lock speaks of the bride of Jesus Christ and the husband even loves her even more she has all of this but sometimes excuse me she has all this love she has all this double portion she's blessed she's chosen of god she's favored by her husband but yet something holds back from conceiving god shut up remove notice you have Hannah chosen she's blessed she has a double portion of God's blessing she has predestinated to bring forth the word of that day and she goes to worship every year not catching that full revelation and she just praise for her son to come even that there's something in it but she prays every year she goes back to the temple praise the same prayer the same thing Lord bless me Lord can be a child caught please give me a child she prays for God to give her this child every year now if you notice there's something else in Scripture in verse 6 her advocacy has adversary so it's not that just that she is burdened by the fact that she's not bringing forth what she wants to bring for the child she has an adversary he's against the promises he's against you be in the chosen one you have an adversary and Hannah had an adversary so just the burden of not being able to conceive was enough for a woman but she had an adversary that tormented her and the Bible says provoked her year after year after year she's living all year with this provoking adversary to make her feel no doubt the voices you hear sometimes you're not the chosen one what's something wrong what you do wrong with God something's wrong I don't have my microphone on here right something's wrong is that better brother sorry about that if I drop it just tell me all right just tell me I need my microphone so year after year she's being provoked and her adversaries there was the same voices probably that you hear look at you yeah your favorite of your husband but you can't even bring forth a child you you think you're the chosen one do you think you're special sounds like the voice of the devil anybody ever hear those voices you're not producing anymore they either just coming to church every week and you're just doing this you go to the Temple of Jerusalem every year look at all your sacrifices you're making your dedication to your husband look at you worshipping every year being faithful to go the house of God look at you and yet God doesn't you must have done something wrong she didn't do anything wrong she's God's chosen anyway no matter what the devil says she was the chosen one to brief how many know about this adversary provoking you how many have that whisper of the enemy in you in your ear every day the same one that had a hat you're not any of your not a good Christian you're not this you're not that always speaking to you look what you did look at your bass look what you did last week look at your look at all this and bread just to provoke or provoke or and all the while you're wanting to move on with the Lord and why can't I move on I can't go any further is anybody listening to me here tonight this is the provoker that's speaking in your ears this is the tormentor that speaks in our ears but I got good news for you because over there in Revelations he says Michael his angels were cast out and the accuser of our brethren was cast out of the heavenly atmosphere out of the atmosphere and that means there's a day coming well I'll never hear that voice in my ear again we ought to stop and shout awhile because there's a day coming real soon when you will never hear the accuser in your ear again [Applause] you'll never hear accusing voice again it'll be over you'll never hear my it'll be so odd to us you don't think we're gonna shout I think we're gonna shout cuz we're so used to the devil speaking to us and oppressing us and bringing us down and trying to read everything why isn't this happening in my life and reading into it and that's where you you overthink things and in the prayer lines and the prayer lines brother Graham says you seem to be a person to overthinks things you're crossing bridges before you come to and that person was in a spirit of depression because they overthink things well the devil helps us do that these guys going over here Devils got a sphere and things that hasn't even happened yet I'll tell your friends it's bad enough hearing what's happened then fearing what hasn't happened yet what a devil can you say man it's enough just to deal with everyday what's happened and he wants us to fear what he even happened what hasn't even happened tomorrow yet my friends we need to stand on our two feet with the power of God interval tell the devil get thee behind me Satan [Applause] and he's not given us the spirit of fear power and love and a sound mind we're not living by the spirit of fear we're living like the spirit of adoption that's in us it's taken us somewhere so here we find this adversary in enemy and each year she goes and prays and God don't answer and each year this enemy increases is provoking and increases his more pressure which I had another sermon to tell you of the pressure that's increasing on the bride of Jesus Christ the longer were here the more pressure in the Battle of the mind and why is it happening but Gerald why is it happening because we're the chosen ones we're gonna bring forth this promise we're the ones that's going in a rapture yeah let the devil talk all he wants to I'm one of the ones that's escaping this thing and whether it's gonna be tomorrow morning or whether it's gonna be 30 years from now it doesn't matter to me I'm one of the ones this is going to happen too [Applause] so more pressure comes in more prayer and this kind of frustrated her Alcona her husband after a while and I love the scripture it's God has a sense of humor because the husband's coming in saying why he gets frustrated with his wife I know none of your brothers ever get frustrated with your wife we just leave that alone but this husband got frustrated with her depression and her negativism and are constantly complaining and her constant God doesn't answer God has an answer and he's tried to shower her with gifts he gives her a double portion he keeps telling her I love you more than my other wife can you imagine a wife here on that how many times do I have to tell you [Music] is any husband's gonna raise your hand relate just a little bit to that there's an honest one right there how do I get this through how I get this through to this woman that can is trying to get it through I love you I've given you a double portion I don't love her as much as you I love you still not enough and you know what his last comment was he says hey anyway ain't are better than 10 sons but what am I chopped liver here I mean I'm better than 10 sons now that's a compliment that's a confident man brother Chad that's a confident man to say to his wife I'm better than 10 sons well you can think that way all you want to if your wife don't feel that way it does no good eat the button God's got a sense of humor I'm better than 10 sons Hannah still no smile no reaction just depressed all the time a spirit and a cloud hanging over her she's the child of God she's a daughter of God but she's taking this spirit of depression Devils got a provoked in their Abbess race with her all the time there's anything her husband says that can help pull that pull her out of it there isn't anything church can do to pull it out of it she can't just be pulled out of this let me tell you something there's a little change that need to happen in him there's a little change needed in her because there wasn't a problem with God's promise there wasn't a problem with the church there wasn't a problem with going to Jerusalem every year there wasn't a problem with the priest wasn't a problem with what he preached everything's in place why am I saying that because people tend to in their depression start to blame everybody else for their problems well can I get an amen it makes them feel better if they're in depression to start finding other people to blame it's the people in the church it's the way the pastor is preaching it said they didn't do their part somebody didn't shake my hand somebody didn't hug me if she's letting her depression dictate everything else around her we need to be careful with that listen friends I'm a practical preacher I could get down where we're living you want me to go deeper just keep saying Amen you can ask this to Kimberly she grew up as a child in my church and I can take this deeper I can really get down where I'm living and where you're living and I've been a pastor for 30 years as our brothers been 4050 years and you learned people after a while and people tend to find someone else to blame and a lot of times they're the problem in this case it wasn't a problem with the worship wasn't the problem with the priest there wasn't a problem with her husband wasn't a problem with the other women having babies there wasn't problem with that Hannah she's a child of God God loved her but there was a little change in humility that was needed there was a little change of attitude pastor and I spoke about that the attitude you know in this message we can get a prideful attitude the word is right the message is right we believe it but I'll say it the way I said it to him I believe through the years some people have rejected the message not because the message but the way it was presented to them because people aren't dumb they can sense pride they can sense a superior attitude and you're not going to sell anything I was telling brother Gerald brother branham and I can't remember the sermon but he mentions in 65 he says now if you've got a new product a new hammer it's a new modern invention and said the old hammer he says you don't go up to the guy that's hammering with the old hammer and tell him what are you doing with that old hammer damn or just yeah that ain't nothing you're not accomplishing anything and that's the way you present your product he said you don't do it that way said you go up and you compliment him for what he's doing so you're doing a good job there and said that's a great job you're doing and you compliment I find brother Browns attitude even just 65 complimenting what God's doing in those churches even though they weren't message churches now he's not holding back his preaching at all but his attitude is still a right spirit towards me I'm gonna say to you we need more of that in the message of the album I must feel at home because I don't normally say those things everywhere but I'm telling you I feel at home I'm telling you it's not the problem with the word it's not a problem with the Holy Ghost it's who's representing this thing [Applause] it's our attitude it's our pride let me tell you something you're no better except for the grace of God so I'm in the message I'm better you're no better except for the grace of God you're a human being like them you got a spirit you got a body you got see taste feels you got all this stuff you're living in the flesh like them can you say my so there's no reason to get a superior attitude I know brother brems says there's a super race it's Abraham's race I believe all that but I don't believe it when it takes it to a superior pride because to me if you're Abraham's race the super race you have more humility than anybody because you've you've come to dimensions of the grace of God more than you understand grace more than anybody and when you understand grace when you understand as our brother Bob said tonight that he's washed away there's a sea of forgetfulness when you understand what justification means when you understand that just about means just acceptance you never did it in the first place when you know forgiveness and justification the way that you know it then it makes us have more grace for others [Applause] [Music] hallelujah blessed be it's me somebody say praise the Lord blessed be his name god help us god help us to die to our pride god help us to die to a superior attitude we're nothing without the grace of God say I got the message and I know more than everybody else you don't need head knowledge that won't get you into a rapture Paul said knowledge puffeth up but revelation makes you more humble so you know when somebody's getting a true revelation and not just understanding the mysteries in their head when more humilities in their life plenty of head knowledge so much head knowledge in this message and so on dazzle preachers that can dazzle the people and everybody's caught up in the dazzling of the and I'm not against preaching deep things but listen it's time for the bride of Jesus Christ to grow and true not knowledge but true revelation that brings the humility and character of Jesus Christ that's my expectation praise the Lord so now it would appear like that God is holding this up but there's a little change needed and Hannah she needs something deeper before this comes to pass and in verse 11 is where we see this takes a place her prayer that year was different it was the same at the start but then but will hears her prayer different verse 11 but we'll give unto the Hamming a man-child as I've asked then I will give unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head listen friends her prayer now had a deeper revelation behind it could I could I be safe to say don't don't be offended but could I be say that Hannah she's a believer she's a daughter of God but she's a bit too self-centered she still got a little bit of self-centeredness because she's more caring about her desires and what she wants which is fine which is fine it's just that if she's the chosen woman she's not like the other wife okay so now they might be self focused I don't know what they are but this is the chosen woman of God so if she has a self focused attitude too much or selfishness too much that she's got a she's got to die out to it in order for something greater to take place those people they're so focused and look at that prize look at that so focus yeah don't put your fingers at them you're not supposed to bring forth but they are you're supposed to bring forth this could we say there's just a bit of self interest self focused they're still too much and she's in the message she's in the bride she's going to church she's listening to the message of the hour but there's a bit of selfishness there too just just I want this prayer I want this I want this I want this but now something happens to her prayer and she says if you'll give me this child I will take it now that listen friends this is humility this is humility at a deeper level I do this at home I come out here hope it's okay it's such a small building that I feel like I'm right in your face you talk about an action here now this did you we just not just need to stop and think about this because she has a desire to have a child so she can have it so she can hold it so she can take it home she can take care of him she can raise the child all that's there that's her desire but you take a woman that something has happened so deep in Hanna that she's willing to say before the Lord now if you'll give it to me I will take you all and I won't give it back see listen friends that's a revelation that level of humility that takes a revelation that takes a quite a change it's a little change but it's a big change she says Lord if you give it to me and this is where the prayer changed she said Lord if I if you will give me this child I will give it back to you as a Nazarite I'll give it to Eli the priest he'll be raised in the house of God he will be given for your man and then I don't know if she knew he would become a prophet but that's what he would become I'm gonna dedicate this child to you and I'm gonna give it and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth and the story goes on that Hannah she spake in her heart her only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she was drunk so now something happens to Hannah that she has now there's there's a greater victory that's come in her life she's given up instead of holding on to this highway she's giving it up we need to give up and let Jesus take over then we need a little change in our life to give up and she gave it up and when she did she gets so lost in the presence of the Lord and praising him that when Eli seen her there was a change in her worship because every year he's seen her worshiping she didn't look like this this year she was drunk in the spirit of the Lord why because she was released she was she gave it all to God she humbled herself she changed her attitude about this whole thing I tell you there's a great victory in your life when you give it all away you're gonna come to victories that you haven't felt before you're gonna become the feelings you never felt before you're a quiet quiet worshipper oh that's fine but sometimes when you come to these type of victories you're not a quiet worshipper you become an exuberant worship cuz you're not ashamed I'm gonna raise my god because I have had a victory take place in life praise Allah there's an internal victory no the greatest victories of the internal victories she didn't even have a baby yet yeah but she's got a victory [Applause] don't promise but she's changed that change of the body yet but she's changed she hasn't even been with her husband they even went home yet nothing's happened that way but she she's the one that's changed she's worshiping as if it's already happened she's worshiping as if she's already there didn't brother Brown say that we ought to worship in these temples as if we're already in that other temple over there I'll tell you that's the worship God likes to see I'm coming in with my trials I'm coming in with my things for the week I'm coming with people speaking against me my boss is all over me all this stuff happening my finances everything else but I'm coming to the house of the Lord and I'm going to worship as if none of that is going on it's an attitude it's a change in attitude oh and I'd love to talk about how that she she comes every year and she maybe has a special but when she sings especial every year temple it's the same special every year and it's depressing because their spirits depressed so every year she has the same special and people look at her say but this year this year when she came her special changed you say man every year they had to hear the same song every year and it was called woe is me sister Hanna could you come up and sing a special for us this year and everybody's going oh boy Oh Lord not sister Hanna and not because they know she got sing the same special she got such a cloud over that she just she just kills the whole service please don't let her sing it's gonna be the same song it was every year she gets up give me the key sister give her the key woe is me [Music] it's real creative lyrics woe is me I am down and brokenhearted I know he loves me but woe is me same song every year I just made that one up just now I'm a songwriter not very creative but woe was me the same song but this year after Eli said new year you're drunk what you're drunk she says I am not drunk but I have poured out my heart to the Lord so she said the Eli don't accuse me of being drunk isn't this like the day of Pentecost didn't they say they're as drunk men so the promise of God for that hour had been fulfilled and what's happening in them and they come like drunk men out of that upper room a victory had happened can you say this promise was fulfilled and so they come out of their drunken he says is Eli says this woman's drunk no I'm not drunk but I poured out my spirit to the Lord and God's done something for me this year there's a change in my heart what do you have a baby yet no I don't have the baby yet but something's changed in me and he Eli I want to sing a special again you are you sure you want to do I want to sing a special on this year how do I get in I want to see a special everybody's go Dungey have to sing it's gonna be the same song and okay go ahead and she gets up give me the keys sister she gets up there she goes give me that microphone turn this thing on I gotta have a good mic turn it loud i like it loud like Donny reagan so he says go criticize the musician he says I like it aloud so he says I could never say that to my church anyway I like it loud turn it up Gio said nobody's expecting what was me and she victory is mine victory is mine victory today is my she don't have a baby yet but I told Satan to get the victory too is my joy is my gorge oh yes ma'am yeah [Applause] [Music] well toad Satan to get thee behind Joe today his mind praise God Hanna do you have a baby yet no but victory today is mine and when she started to sing that friends that whole audience said what happened to Hanna she's a changed woman what in the world's going on she had a little change happening [Applause] she didn't care what people thought after that she didn't care what people thought she was gonna worship God her attitude changed her melody had changed everything changed within her heart and she didn't have a baby yet and that reminds me of something brother Branham said I like to study the prayer lines because we learned something in those prayer lines not just that God is a mighty healer and can heal heal every disease raise the dead open up the blind I see you still do it today but the healing campaigns if you listen to the prayer line you watch how the Holy Spirit deals with each person and I learned something from those if you're listening you learn how the Holy Spirit deals with an individual he still deals the same way and you see now one thing that brother Brown said is they come up many times do you say he'd pray for them and he says now go on your way rejoicing and be happy I love that go on your way now rejoicing and be happy now sometimes they were healed instantly I'm a miracle but sometimes they weren't healed yet but they were gonna get their healing brother Adam knew they had to keep their confession right and he says you don't hold your faith it'll come back on you again so he's teaching the people go on your way rejoicing be happy don't let the devil talk to you don't look at the symptoms you see God wanted us to act the right way even if we don't have our healing yet he wants us to rejoice as if we've already got it he wants us to have the right attitude go on your way rejoicing and be happy some people didn't do that they're going back to that depression went back to complaining oh I still feel it no no no no no no no no be happy claim the victory claim the promise of mine it's a prophet teaching us how to live as Christians that God does not want you to be happy after he gives you the miracle God wants you to be happy now praise the Lord all right I'm done with my special hand I just brought the house down that Sunday I'm telling you the place come unglued she started a revival in her own church you don't think you think when I'm preaching boy you're giving yourself a license to say look at this look at verse 18 and she said let thine handmaid find grace I'm in first chapter 1 4:18 so so I'm just letting you know I'm not off my rocker here I said in the Bible and she said let thy handmaid find Grace and I say so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad so that tells us every year at church her countenance was sad but now she has no baby yet she has no promise yet but her countenance is no longer sad now that's the right attitude God's looking for God looking at Joshua and Caleb and he's looking for the faith of Joshua and Caleb come back and here's all the bet evil reports and to rise up and say wait a minute everybody shut up quit talking negative we're more than able to take a life [Applause] God perks up his attention say that's what I want to hear that's what I got here right there yeah it perks up God's attention there into the land yet they haven't overcome anything yet but it's the attitude he's looking for able to take this I don't care about the Giants I don't care about the Wilson it doesn't matter God's giving us the promise we're going forward please be to God I know this is a simple message here tonight but I pray you're taking this from the Lord there's a little change needed in our lives just a little change maybe that'll bring the big change how many wants the big change we got to be willing say Lord changed me in the little thing praise God we want to get out of this earth can you say man what a new body praise the Lord here was a greater step of humility and unselfishness remember that this is a greater step in humility and unselfishness you'll find it throughout the women of the Bible who come to God's promise she's not thinking of herself no more listen when she said that say Lord I'll give it back to you where did that inspiration come from you think he came from herself where did the inspiration come from to ask for that child but to say I'll give it back to you she tapped into God's desire and God's predestinated plan she couldn't even ask for that they said she tapped into inspiration she tapped into God's plan she tapped into God's desire and purpose with his child she dies to her selfish motives and puts her design remember awesome at maturity last night this is one segment of it maturity is dying to our selfishness being self focused it's about me it's about my prayer requests is about my ministry all of us preachers got died of that not about us it's about others it's about his kingdom how can I serve his kingdom if my gift helps his kingdom great but if it doesn't get used no problem I'm serving his kingdom I want to see other people blessed who she made this decision for other people I'm giving up this child to serve in the house of the Lord and becomes a prophet I'm gonna add this in so I don't forget it do you know later god bless her with three sons and daughters so when we give to the Lord we live by the promise of the hour with the right attitude he can come around and give you the desires of your heart so she got a baby three of them three boys to take home with her and to hold and to raise can you say Amen three boys right brother Mark you got three boys three boys to take home of her own and she raised him she got blessed but first she had to have changed in her attitude changing her humility the inspiration came from the predestinated plan of God she dies to herself as mojin puts her desire in god's channel this child was to be a prophet and had to be dedicated that way so the thing holding this up was hannah needing her desire to go to the depth of submission and to lose all of her selfishness the other women did not have to have this level of humility don't expect it from others like brother Bram says if you're waiting for the church to have a revival don't sit around and wait for someone else to start it said let it begin in you and it'll spread out to other places don't sit around away for the church to have a revival let it begin in you and it'll spread out to other places what the truth that is we are not the same don't compare yourself the other wife was not called to this level of humility so don't look for it in other people we will talk about that in the morning a little bit don't look it for it in other people but what is God trying to do in you this is an individual revival it's not a national revival it's not a church revival it's an individual revival praise be to God her attitude change and her provoke her was gone her oppressor was gone can you say man her countenance was no longer sad I'll tell your friends just put a smile on your face boy the pastor would go crazy and preach like fire if people came to church with just a better countenance that their faith said that they wanted to be there I'll say it like my dad some Christians come to church and their faith looks like they've been baptized in prune juice so he says and he says if you're happy notify your face christians christians look just destroyed was me oh listen if you can't change your heart yet and you're still waiting god to change your heart just change your face just start there can you say man praise the Lord says Moses when he looked into the glory of the Lord that his countenance was changed can you say man I don't know all the happiness countenance was says now after Calvary that same glory that changed his face in his countenance that same glory now after Calvary could come and change the soul of man and kill the serpent nature and change the soul of man but it couldn't do it before Calvary so all it could change was his countenance and I've said to my people before I would love it if the glory of the Lord would just change your face first it changed Moses face let's start there [Applause] let's start there on Sunday mornings [Applause] Amen I hope you're having as good a time as I in this the Word of God it's our place is our position and she no longer had a sad countenance upon her face but something changed her in pastor's boy if we could see people to come to church this way you don't have to be somebody that you're not you can't be all different brothers and try to be somebody and you know the loud hallelujah is the loud Holly Louise from our dear brother here it's it's wonderful I mean but you don't have to try to be him he's got to be him but it's a distinctive loud hallelujah and I'm glad he does it because I'll know where to find him on the other side no child know where to find you just listen over there okay I get run over find by the chat so we'll know where he's at do you have to be like somebody else I'm not trying to rouse something up here tonight I'm trying to make something difference but I want to say Lord I'm saying Lord change the people that their change their attitude then we can approach the Lord with the right attitude and a happy attitude I'm happy to be a Christian I'm happy to be here and I want to hear whatever the word has for me in this Wednesday night whatever night it is I'm happy to hear it take it latch on to it I'm waiting for this promise to come to pass in my life amen her countenance was no longer sad she Heba had a deeper joy and a deeper humility with all this she went home and knew what happened she went home and conceived the promised King God opened her womb she conceived I love the Lord tonight pull that quote up brothers listen to this now and this gels it all together now this is in the message humble thyself 1963 this is after the seals and I would just say something about this okay I'm gonna just preface this a little bit I like when I study the things of God's done in this generation it's not just that it's Elijah's spirit that would restore all truths that were lost through the church ages he said he'd send Elijah to restore all things okay so we know that he done that according to his word restored all truths that all the loose ins all the reformers everything couldn't do it it took a prophet to do it so they preached a little truce but the Prophet gathers them all together at the end time restores us back to truth what happened in the garden how many gods is there you see but you see there's more to me to the messages more to that because I watch what God does personally to this brother brother Branham that is growing in this revelation and growing in the Lord and coming to his adoption I'm watching how God deals with him so if you're really a study of it you'll see certain things take place I'm gonna mention one to you and he mentions that after the seals he mentioned the message standing in the gap he mentions it in this humble thyself and then he further elaborates on it in Shalom it's not doctrinal things okay I'm not you get taught well enough that here but this is something that happened personal in brother brems life before the seals he started to get a complex speaks about understanding the gap he had developed a complex for the people who's preaching - and they weren't getting it and weren't every year I come back they get worse he started blasting calling them Ricky's and Rick Etta's and so he was doing those things and he actually had internally this was happening too he developed a complex against and he lost his feeling for the people everybody knows what I'm talking about this is happening personally in brother brems life he he was still a prophet he still preached the seals got the lamb broke the seal spoke him through his probably all this was happening but did you know while that's going on he's dealing with an internal thing of he's grown a complex almost ready to leave the field because there's I going in preaching every year and I see these short dresses I see all yeah I see all this coming back I see all this worldliness it continues to come in what's the use of even trying and when God shows him it wasn't the problem so much with criticizing them he had developed an attitude now all that was true there was people rejecting the word there was people who come back every year they wouldn't take go on with the word the problem wasn't with them that's gonna happen but he had changed his feeling and I'm here to tell you that he was dealing this through the seals because just after the seals then he preaches standing in the gap he catches a revelation of Moses God's people complaining and Moses stands in the gap like Christ if somebody doesn't stand the gap for those people they're acting ignorant they're acting they're acting against God they're complaining if somebody doesn't get ahold of Christ and stand in the gap there's no hope for him so he concludes by saying if I've lost my feeling for the people I've got to get over this or I can't help God's people properly I've got to overcome this you know find all this in the message standing in the gap and so he personally and when he comes saying he come to a personal victory himself he says I want that feeling back to the people he said and I'll let him explain it to you but then when stand in the gap he explains it and he says something about the feeling of the people and then I'm gonna jump to the Shalom I'm taking a lot of time tonight is it okay in in 1964 in shalom in that message he god breaks to him that this darkness that covers the earth while God is getting ready to shine the greatest light it's the worst darkness and it's gross darkness upon the people it says so he begins to describe the people and and as he describes him he said they're getting a worse and worse State and he's talking about a lot of Christians he's going to preach to their state gets worse and he says it's because gross darkness is upon the people and he starts making a comment he refers to Jesus saying for forgive them father for they know not what they do and he says I'm convinced friends he says these people they they want to be children of God they want to serve God but they've been so hindered by the denominational ideas and he explains this as saying that the darkness is hindering them so now that's true and that's a bad thing the darkness hindered him they hold back their rebellious to the Lord whatever it is that's fine but you see that can be happening but our attitude towards that is what brother Branham was being corrected on you know he preached the message 65 North it not he took the layout of scene age is the first time I've ever presented these things here this kiss came fresh today he takes knoweth it not but we know the Laodicean Church age he takes that he says because in the latest in age they're blind they're naked help me out they got all the characteristics of that church but they don't know it and knoweth it not that's the darkness because they want to do right but something keeps them from doing right now that's quite a way to look at it because you can be critical and say now they need to get themselves straightened out and just they're a bunch of Ricky's out there and just but you see now he's seen it deeper to see they want to do right but the darkness is holding them back should be the grace of God that God removed that darkness and shine light they come that's up to God but our attitude can't be this Ricky Rick enand he had the rebellious to the word he was seeing it deeper to say we're under a darkness that they don't even know what they're doing and then quoted in Shalom Jesus at the cross at the last hour he's saying Father forgive them at the last hour he's looking at these people crucifying him but he's saying he's the standing in the gap to the Father God forgives them because they don't know what they're doing I know what they're doing father you know what they're doing but they don't know what they're doing what an attitude what an approach to people that are rebellious what an approach to people who are rejecting this message what an approach to people who have been in the message and left it what good are we if we get up and just fight back at him it doesn't do any good I'm gonna try to intellectually get them back in the message that's just a waste of time what we need is the character of Christ shown that they see something deeper enough I'm just so mu Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he quotes it in Shalom looking at that darkness and he says I've been wrong to call them Rickey's and Raquette --is God showed me I was wrong to call them that prophets being corrected in his attitude after the seals you don't have to say amen to that I know I'm presenting some things here to think about but God's correcting his son and maturing his son after the seals so it's wonderful and did he go on in 64 and 65 and say Rick Etta's and Ricky's still yep does that mean he wasn't changing no I believe it's changed his heart changed and when he's blasting those things it's not a personal thing to go against those people he has to call things what they are he's Elijah but personally his spirit changed towards them can you say mad so I'm trying to be honest is that he went on and said that a few times did you see now by the Lord correcting him his spirit had to change about it because when he would say it before there was something tainted in his spirit - I'm gonna blast out this you know preachers can do that they can preach the message but project the wrong spirit and that's when I preach about maturity we need ministry and we need the people of God to not just have the message but project the right spirit it's been people sent message churches for years and they're hearing the quotes and they're hearing the message but the spirit that's coming across the spoke but sometimes is Nicolay attend sometimes there's a complex sometimes it's control over the people it's all kinds of other motives we need to purify ourselves of all other agendas all other motives get under the Holy Ghost get under humility preach the power of God to the people through this word let this message do what it was meant to do nothing attached to it no agendas to it no cry can you say men not blasting the people personally because of your anger your anger will not change God's people I'm not even angry tonight except that the devil I'm not angry you and I yell like this I'm burdened in my heart god help us the mature as believers that this message can produce what it was meant to produce for the Gerald thank God for a faithful man but I want to grow as a minister not just the corrugation I want to grow it took me that long to come to this quote you got the quote took me that long to set up that quote you get it though you know it's a personal thing standing there is a personal thing going on and Shalom he gets the answer forgive them probably forgive them they know not what they do now he says that to the seals he said now it's and this is a little it's not even a sermon it's just humbled myself he's just talking to the people notice humble thyself it's my time for consecration to God God's time to speak to me I must just have a little change in my own life somebody said prays alone now this is after the seals of the seals have been preached that the book of redemption has been open to the bride and he's saying personally but I need a little change in my own life and he's gonna explain what it is I need a little change in my own life not as I think that I am wicked but but I want to feel a little more closer to people you see the people that I've tried to tell this gospel truth to and they turned their back on it and walk away and laugh at it now to me that seems like an insult I don't care to me but to the things that I've been saying it's the truth trying to help them like shoving on a boat and say here here it is cross over here get out of that swirling stream you're gonna die you're going to Paris there and they just laugh at you and walk away well to me it feels like is they walk away there's nothing more I can do about it you see nothing more I can do but I want to run down the bank now and persuade them come on back he's changing there's a little change happening in him he's explaining the change he wants to see I want to go down and and and welcome them back or say come on back see I've got to have that feeling you see because I know there's something out there that hasn't come in yet you see I'm gonna fish till you see he said until the last fish is caught oh so much of this us for no more the message then they start setting dates when the door was closed and it's always when after they got in everybody everybody ever noticed when they set a date that the door that the Lambs off the mercy seat and the doors the doors been shut it's always after they got in it's interesting he said I want to he said I'm expecting something happen and and he said I want to do that now in order to do this I'm expecting something to happen in the Permian something and many of you remember the vision of the last poll that third poll rather you remember there was something happened just before that I seen that light come and go down into that place and said I'll meet you in there he's time together humble thyself he's tying together this thing in a price that he needs to get to to the third Pole in that little room that's why he says that message Intervale he says you got to find your secret place your secret place that little room is there some physical tent somewhere this is a tent vision Moses had a tent vision it's very biblical tent vision Moses added attentiveness had three parts to them God's 10 and this hour has three parts to it that's us the outer court to enter court the inner veil so what's the little root so finding your secret place it's a deeper walk it's a deeper thing it's a deeper love it's a victory in divine love he's coming to his victory in divine love personally he's coming to his adoption his victory in divine another place in humble thyself he says if we really want to see the third pole do something among us then he says we need to humble ourselves that was his answer we need to help our stars I'll tell you friends that's powerful if you didn't get anything else you can get brother Graham saying after the seals I just need a little change in my own life I need a consecration to God I need a I need time to God to speak to me well hasn't God has it God spoke through his seals but we're not stopping there parsley we're saying I need God to speak to me it's the personal thing as a church as the bride the seals were open dispensation leaf or the bride but you see those things have to break to you personally it's a personal revival and then God takes you through those little things like you did Hannah to bring you to a place of deeper humility a greater depth of human greater a better attitude this forgiveness this victory of divine love is anybody catching this mature love eternity we got the word but we need the maturity to handle the world that's why he could say this bride she knows what he wants done with the word can you say that's prophecy saying she knows what he wants done with it she has word but she knows what he wants done with it that's important to excuse me because people have handled the word wrong for many years got the message but handled it wrong lack of divine love oh my praise the Lord well I'm done with Hannah I don't know whether to go on with Esther or not praise the Lord he's taking the clock down I knew he was gonna do that he's headed out to get the road ball you want me to go on just a little bit sure I know some of you're a little tired but but you know we're here and I'm all the way you know so many thousand miles away from my home I don't have anywhere else to go I wouldn't know where to go I'd get lost it's getting cold out there tonight yeah I hear you got bears so I can I'd rather just keep preaching praise the Lord so let me just let me do a brief the summer here and just bring Esther in if that's okay with you and I'm not gonna go read the scripture because you know the story of Esther but I want to refer to this other woman because Esther was the last person you would think to be chosen in that day he was the last person to be chosen by the by the Gentile King to be the Queen last person that speaks of our lives were the last to be chosen can you say man we don't need some of us don't even know why we're sitting here tonight you were voted most most likely to not succeed losers can you say that yeah of all places in the world you shouldn't be sitting here tonight called and chosen by God has to be the bride of Jesus Christ you see voted least likely to succeed in class probably and all the thing in all your past and yet you're here tonight and Esther felt that way is what's happening here I'm chosen and she rises to the place to be in tight now the Queen the the wife of the King because the work first wife had rejected him and now he's gonna choose a bride Esther being a Jew she's the chosen person and yet she was chosen by the king and finally jumpin head after going through the process finally she stood there one day living in the palace of the king he's calling her bride because she's the bride now she's been married to him she's there in her own little Palace suffered The Passion of the King but she's there she's in her position all was going fine she was calling yourself bride the King was calling her by I think of this about the last 50 years and the message God has been speaking to his bride calling you bride you know your bride tonight she's sitting there and they're all is fine as far as being favored by the king just like Alcon his wife she's doubly blessed she's the bride there's no question about that nothing could change that now but she had an enemy she had a tormentor she had something rise up against her and so now this Haman this haman the agagite is what it's called I call it agitate comes from the root word agitate I'm just gonna call it that that's the root word Agra gite was his name but he's an agitator he's an oppressor and Haman begin to agitate and she had an enemy just like Hanna had an enemy and impress her and so a tormentor and so he had a jealous spirit and further hated the true people of God the Jews hated the Jews and the chosen people of God he hated them he detested them and there wasn't really a reason like in the days of Nehemiah that samulet and Tobiah were against Nehemiah building the temple they were just getting done do you really say why they were against him it's just a spirit against them the bride is gonna have this so we see religious brother brems saying two million two hundred thousand thousand demons released from the river Euphrates against the bride can you say man religious demons who hate and seek to kill the true elect just like they sought to kill the Jews but you see now Esther she come under this pressure of Haman and as soon as she come into her position as bride as soon as she come into that place that's when this agitation begin to rise and a minion derives speaks of our lives can you say Amen you didn't have too much trouble until you come in your position as I'm a southern daughter of God can you say man then you get this agitated rising up that hates you he loved you when you were in the world he loved you when you're out there partying you'd make a stand as the Son of God now you got a haven against you Astra had it hey man what'd she come into her position she had an enemy and as soon as she come into that there was an increase in pressure from her enemy and it kept getting worse the bride of Jesus Christ as she's grown in the Word of God and if she's been taken hold of her position in the Word of God the pressure has only increased on the true by - Jesus Christ through all kinds of different channels on the internet and people leaving the message and got all kinds of things against it the devil is working everywhere because he hates this message and he hates the people that believes it it's Satan it's not the brother it's Satan listen now try to bring this to a close she just like Hannah had to humble herself to come before the King Esther had to find a deeper level of humility in order for the promise to come to pass she's in the palace she's bribed but there was a little change needed and Esther can you say man there was nothing to change needed it was a change and so she had she could be comfortable there and she could be selfish there and say I'm the bride I'm into my son's Church and I got my message books and but you see now she was positioned for more than that my God had a great preference for that woman to be in the position she was in redemption was going to happen for that woman for all of her people it was going to come through Esther how powerful thing was that God's purpose was deeper than her just to sit in the palace and a message church and just keep hearing the king's word there was a deeper purpose and I'm gonna tell you tonight young people are there's a deeper purpose for your life it's not just to sit around and hear the word but we become living epistles of the Word of God we're positioned in this process of redemption Astra had a great thing there but she before she came to it she had to humble herself to come before the king even it was gonna be death if she did that and in order to do it she had to die to her selfishness because she could have stayed there as the Queen enjoyed all the benefits of it but it would be a tad selfish because she would have watched her people be killed you see you catch it her brother BAM says it's about others burn all the selfishness forgive them father they know not what they do Esther had she had to weigh this because even her her uncle there Mordecai was pleading in South Gotham Nash's pray pray pray he was at the temple steps praying trying to say God has positioned you for such a time as this perhaps you need to pray about this you need to consider it and she potted it because she's going to the king she's got to do that it's gonna take humility it's gonna change an attitude to go before him she may die she had all these things in her but she could have stayed in the safety of her palace I'm just drawing myself and my little message church here but you see that there's more people that need to hear this work can you say ma'am it's not just us for know Morgan they sit around say I'm the bride and Singh I'm the bride I'm the bride but yeah well what purpose does God has for your life does everybody listen in here tonight I'm gonna say this I believe that there's great potential in this area with this assembly I see a revival taking place in this church and I believe there's many souls they're gonna come to this assembly I just say that's my heart now I'm not saying that say the Lord but it may be but I'm just saying that's my heart God's doing something and I know when God begins to work this way you better be prepared to minister to more Souls because Newfoundland needs a greater revival can you say man there's still elected seat in this city there's still some souls to come and the recent ones that have come are evidence of that but don't just say us for no more God wants to do something in this assembly can you say Amen you know I'm not I'm not a TV preacher trying to you know be flashy here that's not what I'm doing that's what my heart is first thing I said to the brothers when I walked in this offer I said you guys are gonna have to build on you need to get plans to build on you'd even given the need more parking you're gonna need to our space is too small because I feel I see what's going on I'm not about numbers you know we're not about mega churches I'm about the burden of the bride of Jesus Christ we're not here to sit in our palace and just say I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride we're positioned for such a time as this for redemption for the last elected seed to come so be it amen means so be it how many would say amen to that today let it come to pass she humbles herself before the king she's still the queen but she's not fulfilling the final victory of her life she needed a little change in her to meet this challenge and it was a choice of staying to herself or unselfishly using what she had to appeal to the king for the sake of others she had power with the king she had favor with the king it was a greater depth of humility to go to the king and she's just behind the behind the curtains there and she just steps out it is a greater depth of humility to step out and go before him to see things change she didn't have to do that but she did she humbled herself deeper to help other people unselfish Esther drew near the Bible says she drew near we draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to us that's Bible she drew near the king how many after this weekend if you don't get anything else how many just want to draw near the king just want to draw closer to him I believe it's happening tonight just drawing closer to him forget about lesser things put less of things out of our mind just draw near the king and she drew near him and when she drew near the king he held out the scepter to her and those of you know the Bible no royalty when the scepters handed and you're gonna touch the scepter you're gonna have all power that's a huge huge action from the king because the scepter represents all of his power and she hate he hands it towards Esther what do you want bride what do you want I'll give it to you up to the half of my kingdom what's your desire you know what her desire was an unselfish request to save other people yeah [Applause] but honey but honey you've got everything I've given you all the food and all the thing and you've getting your in the palace and I blessed you so much I've given you everything aren't you satisfied to say no I prayed about it I'm not satisfied just with that there's other people that need help here they are my people she positioned herself in the inner court she drew closer to the inner court why it was something further she desired and she could have stayed in her part of the palace would still be queen but I want more I need more the scepter was held out to her as a huge move to touch and to touch it means you have all power what is your request Esther and she's nervous as a young girl and I'm gonna dramatize this just a bit and then I'm gonna quit she's nervous as a young girl because it shows her nervousness when the King asked her she didn't come right out with it and expose her enemy she said can you come to dinner at my place with Haman and I want to serve you a dinner kind of surprised the King well all right I guess we can do that she could have asked for anything right there but it shows she's just a little nervous I said sure we'll come they show up in the house finished a beautiful dinner Haman sitting there her enemy you know what she's doing she's inviting her King and her enemy in the same place to expose her enemy in the presence of the king glory what an action is he gonna let the King deal with him she's got power with the King you can't deal with some stuff the Devils doing to you bringing in the presence of the King let him deal with it yeah show she was still a little nervous because when she was a little nervous the next night it okay what do you want now I was wondering if you could come tomorrow night for another meal seize her faith is building to ask isn't that how your faith is sometimes you just yes you just growing until you get enough faith to ask I want you to come tomorrow night look okay we can come tomorrow night this was good food we enjoyed this may be better tomorrow night we'll come back she invites both of them the next night she's inviting her enemy in the presence of the king if you have a habit if you have something in your life if you have something that you need to overcome bring it to the Lord the best way to deal with demons is to expose them with honesty the brides learned how to expose her enemy you're not gonna hide so she could have let him go on do what he did but she arranged it so she's gonna expose that thing right in the presence of her king praise be to God we come before we're in the presence of the king that can change everything he's more powerful than your enemies and finally she asked and that King turned against a min and took care of him wit now him did all that need to do because why Esther had power with the king [Applause] Esther had power with the king she has she was under the promise of the hour she was part of redemption for that hour she was part of bringing redemption to others her people she was positioned to do it but I'm here to close this tonight by saying to you there had to be a little change in Esther before that full promise could come to pass all of a sudden now all changes Heyman's hung they change the law that changed everything so all of her people are delivered what you have within you friends is more powerful than what you realize we're finishing this work of redemption and if somebody sees light and somebody sees what Christianity is supposed to be and they see where we're going an adoption if they're gonna they're gonna see it they're gonna see it in you power redemption is on your life that spreads your position to be able to call others call others not some mechanical thing not some intellectual thing but the Spirit of God in you is that Esther that say I'll be used by God to finish this work of redemption it's powerful friends say well I'm just up here in Newfoundland we just go to this little church and there's some brother here and there brother sister don't you dare devalue what you have within you what you're holding in your soul is the most powerful thing that's ever hit planet Earth and the quicker you catch that and the quicker you offer humility with it the quicker God can fulfill his promise in your life my life let's give God praise free and sorry for clapping but the Bible says clap your hands all you people shout unto God with the voice of trial let's give him pay [Applause] praise Jesus thank you for positioning us this way thank you for the place that you put us in Lord we feel unworthy of this position just change our hearts Lord change I God change our attitude forgive us of our pride how many readers they forgive me of my pride lord help me die to my pride lord help me not to be superior in my attitude now I met that little change happened just now in our life the same that the prophet asks for I need a little change that I could love people more that I could forgive people more that I could offer that divine love that mature love Lord to people that are in need people that need you Lord God let me be that light to people that won't see their eyes are blinded Lord they don't want

hurry here change me Lord bring that little change in my life bring a greater humility in my life God that I could submit myself to you father I'm sorry for the things I've done I'm sorry for the times that I've misrepresented this message mom I'm sorry for those times that I didn't speak to somebody because I thought that I was better than I thought I was in the message I was better than that denominational person forgive me Lord for acting with an elite attitude superior and maybe that person sensed that superior attitude they didn't reject you Lord but they rejected the way I presented you are help me to present this message in the right way give me that victory and divine love or give me that the victory into my [Music] it's because of this decision this momentous decision will
