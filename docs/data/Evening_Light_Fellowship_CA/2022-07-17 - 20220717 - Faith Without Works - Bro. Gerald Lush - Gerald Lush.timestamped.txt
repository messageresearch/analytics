[51:01] heart and god revealed this god revealed
[51:03] that they and they believed it and they
[51:04] did it
[51:05] amen we go right back to the beginning
[51:08] in genesis and it says by faith abel
[51:11] what by faith where did he get that
[51:13] faith
[51:14] he didn't read it in this book
[51:16] no not by any means he never read this

[51:22] a revelation in his heart amen brother
[51:25] he knew god he met god he talked with
[51:28] god god talked to him but again let's
[51:30] understand that cain was there too
[51:32] and amen he knew he he knew oh he should
[51:35] give a sacrifice
[51:36] you know and abel oh yeah i want to i
[51:38] want to sacrifice to god and i should
[51:40] sacrifice to god but look at the
[51:42] sacrifice that abel made con concerning
[51:45] the sacrifice that cain made amen oh
[51:48] brother which one had the real faith
[51:50] amen the one that pleased god
[51:53] and in this day and in this hour brother
[51:55] there there there's cain over there and
[51:57] he's doing this and he's doing that but
[51:59] then there's an able brother and i trust
[52:01] by grace that we have the faith that
[52:03] abel had that we're going to offer the
[52:05] the perfect sacrifice we're going to
[52:07] offer amen by perfect faith amen what
[52:10] god requires of us in this day and in
[52:13] this hour amen brother what are we
[52:15] looking for
[52:16] i tell you this a a but cain and abel
[52:19] they were totally cut out they were
[52:21] totally out there of course they heard
[52:22] they weren't in the in the in the where
[52:25] where adam and eve was they were all put
[52:27] out
[52:28] amen so they knew they needed redemption
[52:30] if they can only get back to god
[52:32] we're going to get back into fellowship
[52:34] with god get back into contact with god
[52:36] amen and brother so by faith abel
[52:40] offered the more excellent sacrifice
[52:43] and you cannot like i said cain's
[52:45] sacrifice was excellent
[52:47] it was excellent
[52:48] amen but what about more excellent
[52:52] amen i trust that we are offering the
[52:54] more excellent sacrifice i trust that
[52:56] you are offering the more excellent
[52:58] sacrifice out of your heart today
[53:01] oh brother sister amen and again there
[53:04] and i believe that there's remember cain
[53:06] and abel was right there they and they
[53:08] had talked with god they had fellowship
[53:10] with god and so on but abel offered the
[53:13] more excellent sacrifice and i trust in
[53:15] our fellowship we're going to be like
[53:17] abel
[53:18] amen not king
[53:20] okay he believed god cain was worshiping
[53:22] god cain had a sacrifice amen oh yeah he
[53:26] had all of this on the altar amen oh man
[53:29] and then maybe it looked good maybe it
[53:31] felt good
[53:32] but
[53:33] why
[53:34] what about abel
[53:36] abel
[53:37] what are you offering what are you doing
[53:40] yeah altar is nothing but blood
[53:44] it didn't seem right
[53:46] no it didn't seem right to cain he felt
[53:48] my able shouldn't do that maybe he felt
[53:51] maybe that god wouldn't require that but
[53:52] that's what god required
[53:54] and abel offered it amen even though it
[53:57] was going to he was going he was going
[53:59] to kill the lamb and he was going to
[54:01] shed the blood all over the altar amen
[54:04] yeah but abel had that faith
[54:06] he had he had the more excellent faith
[54:09] offered the more excellent sacrifice i
[54:11] trust we're offering them more excellent
[54:13] sacrifice
[54:14] amen and what god requires in this day
[54:17] and what god required in these last days
[54:19] amen because religion is teaching you
[54:21] that oh you just do this just do this
[54:24] god love this god love that amen oh yeah
[54:27] they think it's this but the first god's
[54:29] concern is this
[54:31] amen believe the word amen that he has
[54:34] given to believe the word that he is
[54:36] giving what's an ordained to do
[54:39] oh as it was with abel bring him back to
[54:41] god
[54:42] bring him back into fellowship with god
[54:44] bring us back into fellowship with god
[54:46] amen not with a church but with god
[54:50] and not only that to get us out of time
[54:52] and into eternity
[54:54] amen and remember that was
[54:56] back there in in genesis and ain't
[54:59] enabled what happened brother man came
[55:01] from eternity into time
[55:03] he got trapped
[55:05] now it's getting back from time back to
[55:07] eternity
[55:08] we we need to offer that sacrifice that
[55:11] god's required in these last days
[55:14] amen not church
[55:16] just church no i'll do this and i'll do
[55:18] that no what does god require when it
[55:20] comes to his word

[1:00:06] sisters and and the young ones and so on
[1:00:08] and being caught up in a rapture i said
[1:00:10] my i said they need a revelation because
[1:00:13] i said the bible says there's not going
[1:00:15] to be no infant of days nor an old man
[1:00:17] that has not fulfilled his days
[1:00:19] so i said well how come that they would

[1:00:23] that's what they had in the painting
[1:00:25] i gave the book to somebody else

[1:00:53] old amen
[1:00:55] and uh yes our our brother david is
[1:00:57] young too but
[1:00:59] our brother david but's here but
[1:01:01] but he's younger than us but he needs to
[1:01:03] get younger
[1:01:05] yeah amen by the grace of god
[1:01:07] so let's press on by the grace of god
[1:01:09] sorry to keep you standing but that's
[1:01:11] all right
[1:01:13] brother i because i see people standing
[1:01:15] a lot lot longer when it comes to the
[1:01:17] things of the world out there
[1:01:19] oh yeah they'll stand and stand and then
[1:01:21] we'll complain
[1:01:22] keep on going no
[1:01:24] god's grace to us
[1:01:27] amen in hebrews chapter 11 and begin to
[1:01:29] read at verse 1.
[1:01:32] and he said now faith is the substance
[1:01:35] of things hoped for
[1:01:38] the evidence of things not seen
[1:01:43] so do you have the substance and do you
[1:01:44] have the evidence
[1:01:46] amen of eternal life
[1:01:48] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:01:51] report
[1:01:53] i trust we're obtaining a good report
[1:01:56] through our faith for the resurrection
[1:01:58] our faith for the rapture
[1:02:00] and through faith we understand that the
[1:02:02] worlds were framed
[1:02:04] by the word of god
[1:02:06] so that things which are seen
[1:02:09] were not made of things which
[1:02:12] do appear
[1:02:14] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[1:02:18] excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:22] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:02:26] righteous
[1:02:27] amen offer the more excellent sacrifice
[1:02:31] in this hour and in this last day what
[1:02:33] is the sacrifice god's requiring and it
[1:02:35] will testify of your righteousness
[1:02:38] amen that has been imputed to us through
[1:02:40] through jesus
[1:02:43] and it says god testifying of his gifts
[1:02:46] and by it he being dead
[1:02:48] yet speaketh
[1:02:50] verse 5 by faith enoch was translated
[1:02:55] that he should not see death
[1:03:00] and was not found because god had
[1:03:03] translated him
[1:03:04] for before his translation
[1:03:07] he had this testimony
[1:03:10] that he pleased god
[1:03:13] amen i trust we have that testimony amen
[1:03:16] because we're believing for what he not
[1:03:19] experience the resurrection and the
[1:03:22] rapture amen
[1:03:24] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:03:28] please him amen
[1:03:31] grace to us to understand without faith
[1:03:33] it is impossible to please him make your
[1:03:36] calling and your election sure
[1:03:39] how make sure your faith
[1:03:42] is the word
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:47] because without faith it is impossible
[1:03:49] to please him for he that cometh to god
[1:03:52] must believe that he is
[1:03:54] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:03:57] diligently seek him
[1:04:00] by faith noah
[1:04:01] being warned of god of things not seen
[1:04:04] as yet
[1:04:06] move with fear
[1:04:08] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:04:10] house and by the which he condemned the
[1:04:13] world and became heir of the
[1:04:15] righteousness which is by faith
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:20] see the importance of faith the
[1:04:22] significance of faith
[1:04:24] without it it's impossible to please him
[1:04:29] verse 8 by faith abraham when he was
[1:04:31] called to go out into a place which he
[1:04:34] should after receive for an inheritance
[1:04:37] obeyed
[1:04:39] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:04:42] went
[1:04:43] amen but by faith he so joined in the
[1:04:46] land of promise as in a strange country
[1:04:49] and dwelling in tabernacles with isaac
[1:04:52] and jacob the hairs with him of the same
[1:04:55] promise
[1:04:56] for he looked for a city
[1:04:58] which hath foundations
[1:05:01] whose builder and maker is god
[1:05:04] god bless his word you may be seated
[1:05:11] you can turn to james chapter 2
[1:05:15] and
[1:05:16] just want to read a verse from
[1:05:18] jude
[1:05:22] but it you can turn to james chapter 2.
[1:05:24] and it says in judah says blessed is he
[1:05:27] that readeth and they that hear the
[1:05:29] words of this prophecy
[1:05:32] and keep those things which are written
[1:05:35] therein
[1:05:37] for the time
[1:05:38] is at hand
[1:05:40] amen and the time is that end for us
[1:05:43] for the fulfillment of the word for this
[1:05:46] hour
[1:05:47] and in james chapter 2
[1:05:50] and beginning to read at verse 14.
[1:05:56] let's go back let's see
[1:06:05] verse

[1:07:37] reflecting it and so on in their their
[1:07:40] faith oh they were
[1:07:43] yeah
[1:07:44] what was the response
[1:07:47] well the person said oh thank you
[1:07:50] she said i don't think i'm going to buy
[1:07:51] it.
[1:07:53] she said why oh considering she said
[1:07:55] what i would do in that house
[1:07:57] she said what i would allow in that
[1:07:58] house and considering she said the life
[1:08:00] that they lived there she said i
[1:08:02] wouldn't want to do that
[1:08:04] god will honor them for that amen almost
[1:08:06] heavily i i thought i said that's what
[1:08:09] they said yes she said that's what they
[1:08:11] told me that they they couldn't buy that
[1:08:13] house because she said that they would
[1:08:15] go do things that wasn't exactly
[1:08:17] christian
[1:08:18] and they would allow those things in
[1:08:20] that house and because of that she said
[1:08:22] because of that you were you were a
[1:08:23] clergy because you and your wife were
[1:08:25] living
[1:08:26] living for them for the lord and that
[1:08:28] she wouldn't do it she didn't want to
[1:08:30] offend the lord amen god honored her for
[1:08:33] that amen
[1:08:34] amen oh brother i pray the grace of god
[1:08:37] and father if if she had that spirit
[1:08:39] what spirit would we have
[1:08:41] what spirit does god require us

[1:08:46] this refuse to do that and then want to
[1:08:48] offend god in this or that brother amen
[1:08:51] how much more are we want to have that
[1:08:53] same attitude
[1:08:54] that we don't want to offend god
[1:08:56] in what we're going to do with family or
[1:08:59] friends or neighbors
[1:09:01] no
[1:09:02] because brother sister if you're born
[1:09:04] again i tell you this you're you're now
[1:09:06] you're part of a different family
[1:09:09] absolutely a different family and the
[1:09:11] relationship with the natural
[1:09:13] is is down but the relationship with the
[1:09:15] spiritual is up
[1:09:17] the relationship with your spiritual
[1:09:19] family is more important now to you
[1:09:22] than
[1:09:22] the physical
[1:09:24] amen praise the lord because now we've
[1:09:27] been come together with an eternal
[1:09:28] family the other is going to pass away
[1:09:31] and you'll just leave it with the lord
[1:09:32] and pray the grace of god to
[1:09:34] your family
[1:09:35] pray the grace of god to friends and
[1:09:37] neighbors amen but you're going to put
[1:09:39] more and more fellowship in with the
[1:09:41] natural aim with the spiritual family
[1:09:43] and i tell you this first when we come
[1:09:44] to this word and first when we come to
[1:09:46] this message oh believers i don't it
[1:09:49] doesn't make a difference who they were
[1:09:50] whether they were young or old or in
[1:09:52] between amen i tell you this they were
[1:09:54] living for one another as believers
[1:09:57] oh yeah and and and the natural family
[1:10:00] was was becoming a little bit jealous
[1:10:02] well because it was it was i was
[1:10:04] challenged with it with a certain family
[1:10:06] member one time and then
[1:10:09] and because oh they said oh what's wrong
[1:10:11] with you they said you're spending more
[1:10:13] time with them than you do with us
[1:10:15] you're more caught up with them than you
[1:10:17] are with us
[1:10:18] why because they were natural family but
[1:10:21] again at the same time they were not
[1:10:22] exactly christian
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:25] but yet when we when we would go to an
[1:10:27] area where there was natural family we
[1:10:29] would just say hello we just maybe you
[1:10:31] know stop in for a moment and just move
[1:10:33] on to the believers
[1:10:34] amen well yeah and then we would we
[1:10:37] would stay with the believers
[1:10:39] yeah
[1:10:40] oh yeah because i remember listen let me
[1:10:42] show you with this this is tremendous
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:46] you're talking about god in nature and i
[1:10:48] remember one time that we went we went
[1:10:50] and we took our our pet with us and it
[1:10:52] was a cat
[1:10:53] yeah and and we went and we visited as a
[1:10:56] family member and we we just went in and
[1:10:59] and we're going to spend some time with
[1:11:00] the family there and and even the cat
[1:11:03] wasn't wasn't comfortable
[1:11:06] no
[1:11:07] oh the cat was oh it was joe's just so
[1:11:10] as out out of order and out of line oh
[1:11:13] my they said what's wrong with the cat i
[1:11:15] said oh she's not comfortable here i
[1:11:17] said for some reason
[1:11:18] i don't know
[1:11:19] and so after a little while that we
[1:11:21] didn't stay there very long after a
[1:11:23] little while we just moved on and two up
[1:11:25] to a believer's home
[1:11:27] and when we did oh my the cat went in
[1:11:30] what's the first thing she did
[1:11:31] the cat went in got up on the dress
[1:11:33] field went to sleep
[1:11:35] oh she's relaxing oh yes i said she's
[1:11:38] relaxing i said she didn't relax up the
[1:11:40] other house which she's reduction here
[1:11:42] because it was a believer
[1:11:44] a believer's home amen and i'll tell you
[1:11:46] this in that believer's home
[1:11:49] they even even
[1:11:50] clergy from other churches
[1:11:52] denominational churches that they would
[1:11:55] they would come into that home
[1:11:56] and and have prayer with brother this
[1:11:59] brother and sister
[1:12:00] why and why because they said oh we feel
[1:12:02] different here
[1:12:04] and yet this brother and sister didn't
[1:12:06] go to denominational church but that
[1:12:08] denominational clergy would come
[1:12:10] he always looked forward to coming to
[1:12:12] visit that that couple
[1:12:15] why because when he couldn't get into
[1:12:16] the home the atmosphere was different oh
[1:12:19] they felt the presence of god and the
[1:12:21] anointing was there oh yes
[1:12:23] and they said well now we want just want
[1:12:25] to share share the word with you and we
[1:12:26] want to pray with you
[1:12:28] so brother do they feel that way when
[1:12:30] they come into your home
[1:12:32] i pray the grace of god help us
[1:12:35] that you know what it is
[1:12:37] you know what it takes you've got to
[1:12:38] live in the spirit and you've got to
[1:12:40] walk in the spirit
[1:12:42] amen if you live in the spirit water in
[1:12:44] the spirit that means he's in control
[1:12:46] amen if he's in control out there he's
[1:12:48] in control in your home
[1:12:50] amen and that anointing is in your home
[1:12:52] praise the name of the lord
[1:12:55] god of us that we have that faith that
[1:12:58] pleases god
[1:12:59] amen all right sorry let's go to
[1:13:03] james chapter 2 again
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:10] and it again
[1:13:12] let me read it again verse 14. what does
[1:13:14] the prophet brought my brethren though a
[1:13:16] man say he hath faith and have not works
[1:13:20] can faith save him
[1:13:23] not without works
[1:13:27] faithful that works he's dead
[1:13:30] and there's many a believer
[1:13:32] that got a dead faith
[1:13:34] how many of us got living faith
[1:13:37] amen how many got faith that pleases god
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:43] praise the lord
[1:13:46] so faith without works is dead therefore
[1:13:48] he said if if it has not works can faith
[1:13:51] save him no
[1:13:53] it's a dead faith
[1:13:56] and if a brother or sister be naked and
[1:13:58] destitute of daily food
[1:14:01] and one of you say unto them
[1:14:03] depart in peace
[1:14:05] be warned and filled notwithstanding you
[1:14:08] give them not those things which are
[1:14:10] needful to the body what does it profit
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:15] even so faith if it hath not works is
[1:14:19] dead being alone
[1:14:21] now brother sister
[1:14:25] does your faith have works
[1:14:29] oh yeah
[1:14:30] yes sister atlanta i believe that
[1:14:33] that the healing was a work
[1:14:35] that god did
[1:14:37] amen
[1:14:38] so it wasn't faith without works it was
[1:14:40] faith with works
[1:14:42] amen showing that god was there showing
[1:14:45] that god was with her god within her
[1:14:47] amen i
[1:14:48] trust that god is with us god is in us
[1:14:50] amen by the grace of god praise the lord
[1:14:53] we know it is grace
[1:14:55] praise the lord
[1:14:57] do we have that faith and as i said
[1:15:01] yeah you can't have it
[1:15:03] if it's a living faith
[1:15:07] okay how can you just be just
[1:15:10] not express yourself
[1:15:12] not express it
[1:15:14] if you got a living faith
[1:15:16] and as i said i saw
[1:15:18] sister lana when she was testifying of
[1:15:20] god ailing her and
[1:15:22] she she ran down the the the aisle in
[1:15:25] the church there and brother tim
[1:15:26] pruitt's
[1:15:27] and she ran down the aisle back up again
[1:15:29] ran down the hall and back up again
[1:15:32] i said praise the lord
[1:15:33] i said there's an expression of faith
[1:15:36] and praise to the lord
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:39] how many of us want to praise the lord
[1:15:42] for what he's done for us

[1:18:12] okay i said lord bless you and said
[1:18:14] after we went on and he went on
[1:18:16] amen and again another time
[1:18:20] i was doing some work there and uh
[1:18:23] and and then
[1:18:24] some people passing by and one of them
[1:18:27] was a
[1:18:28] he was a soldier i think
[1:18:31] and he stopped and he said oh excuse me
[1:18:33] he said yes
[1:18:35] i thought he wanted me to do something
[1:18:36] there no he said just want to tell you
[1:18:38] he said that that i know you're a
[1:18:40] christian
[1:18:41] he said you don't have to tell us we
[1:18:43] know
[1:18:45] because you're living it i said oh
[1:18:47] i said well only by the grace of god oh
[1:18:49] yes he said well but i just want to let
[1:18:51] you know we appreciate it
[1:18:52] yeah and i've received other other
[1:18:55] others
[1:18:57] coming to me and saying the same thing
[1:18:59] amen but i wasn't i wasn't going to
[1:19:02] talking to them i wasn't going you know
[1:19:04] just being religious
[1:19:06] but as too many people it's just
[1:19:07] religious but they're not spiritual
[1:19:10] amen well religious
[1:19:13] talk the letter of the word talk the
[1:19:15] letter of the message oh yeah this
[1:19:17] doctrine that doctrine oh yeah but they
[1:19:19] don't have it spiritual
[1:19:21] yeah because why
[1:19:23] because their actions and reactions
[1:19:24] prove they don't have the anointing
[1:19:26] within them
[1:19:28] yeah they got the
[1:19:30] and brother the prophet god said you can
[1:19:31] be in the message but the message not in
[1:19:34] you
[1:19:36] and there's many of the message they're
[1:19:38] in the message
[1:19:39] but they're not the message is not in
[1:19:41] them
[1:19:42] amen because if the message is in you
[1:19:44] you're going to live it
[1:19:46] amen if you're in the message you're
[1:19:48] going to talk it
[1:19:49] but not walk it
[1:19:52] amen god help us brother sister
[1:19:54] no wonder when the son of man comes will
[1:19:57] he find faith
[1:19:59] what
[1:20:01] faith considering what god has done and
[1:20:04] considering the word that god has
[1:20:05] revealed surely he find faith if but
[1:20:07] there's going to be very few
[1:20:10] that's right brother why the prophet of
[1:20:12] god said he said well one time he said
[1:20:14] there might be 500 living saints go into
[1:20:16] rapture
[1:20:17] around the world
[1:20:19] and there's two million
[1:20:22] no i think he says five
[1:20:25] i'm not sure 500 million
[1:20:27] i'm not sure how many christians around
[1:20:29] the world
[1:20:30] but he says if there's one in a million
[1:20:32] he said there might be 500 going to
[1:20:34] rapture but brother i tell you this he
[1:20:36] lowered that and he lowered it and he
[1:20:38] lowered it tell him there another time
[1:20:40] he said it might be a dozen
[1:20:43] the problem someone said oh brother
[1:20:45] branham if god asked you if the lord
[1:20:47] asked you to go there and and pick up
[1:20:49] the bride he said would you do it he
[1:20:51] said i might get a dozen
[1:20:54] i said what
[1:20:55] yeah he said he might get a dozen
[1:20:58] and i it's getting fewer and fewer and
[1:21:00] fewer because more and more and more are
[1:21:03] becoming more denominational
[1:21:06] because in the messages the prophet god
[1:21:09] warned us that the people water he said
[1:21:11] what happens to the people he said god
[1:21:12] does this god does that and he said then
[1:21:15] after a short time he said they just go
[1:21:16] back into a denomination not not out
[1:21:19] there in denomination but a
[1:21:20] denominational spirit gets on them
[1:21:23] i trust by grace we don't have a
[1:21:24] denominational spirit
[1:21:27] no
[1:21:28] no the holy spirit the holy ghost amen
[1:21:31] so the the the word brother is not like
[1:21:34] a denomination or a creed and like i
[1:21:37] said to a lot of people this is this is
[1:21:38] one creed
[1:21:40] there's another creed oh yeah oh we
[1:21:43] believe this
[1:21:44] and we believe this
[1:21:47] brother what you believe you go and live
[1:21:50] it controls you
[1:21:51] amen knowing that it controls and
[1:21:54] governs what you're looking for
[1:21:56] and what you're believing for
[1:21:59] amen
[1:22:00] and what brother what has happened down
[1:22:02] through the years
[1:22:03] when it comes to all that god has done
[1:22:04] down through the ages oh they became a
[1:22:06] denomination and all they just believed
[1:22:09] the past not the present or the future
[1:22:12] oh god did this
[1:22:14] god revealed this but what's god
[1:22:16] revealing
[1:22:17] and what's god doing
[1:22:19] amen because the prophet of god warned
[1:22:21] us concerning the message of the hour
[1:22:23] now he said as you go on he said more is
[1:22:25] going to be revealed
[1:22:27] yeah
[1:22:28] he said so he said he said dig deeper
[1:22:32] amen
[1:22:33] amen brother sir that we're recognizing
[1:22:35] not just that god sent a prophet but
[1:22:37] brother recognizing the message says
[1:22:39] lord yeah praise the lord it was the
[1:22:41] opening of the seventh seals that's good
[1:22:42] praise the lord but yet where's the
[1:22:45] faith that it's ordained to give us yes

[1:27:08] you're looking for
[1:27:10] yeah
[1:27:12] yeah
[1:27:13] a man may say thou has faith and i have
[1:27:16] works
[1:27:17] show me thy faith without thy works and
[1:27:20] i will show thee my faith by my works
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:25] so are we reflecting our faith by the
[1:27:28] life we live
[1:27:31] huh sister lana's healing was a
[1:27:33] reflection of her faith
[1:27:35] oh yeah
[1:27:37] so we're going to go forth and reflect
[1:27:38] it in in other areas of our lives
[1:27:42] reflected in our separation unto the
[1:27:43] lord reflect there now our separation
[1:27:46] from sometimes from family friends and
[1:27:48] neighbors
[1:27:50] yeah it's a reflection of faith
[1:27:53] it's what we believe it's not that we
[1:27:55] it's not that we want this and what that
[1:27:57] we just want the will of god
[1:27:59] whatever god wants will do
[1:28:01] yeah
[1:28:02] by the grace of god
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:07] and thy belief is that there is one god
[1:28:10] thou does well
[1:28:12] yeah
[1:28:13] i think
[1:28:14] we don't believe in trinity
[1:28:16] well neither does the devil
[1:28:19] it says read there the devils the devils
[1:28:22] also believe and tremble amen
[1:28:26] amen so they believe this they believe
[1:28:28] that they believe the word and they
[1:28:29] tremble
[1:28:31] but there's believers that believe it
[1:28:32] and they don't tremble
[1:28:36] they don't have that fear of god
[1:28:39] and that i'm when i say fear of god
[1:28:41] means i'm not afraid of god
[1:28:43] no you have absolute respect for god
[1:28:47] that's what it means
[1:28:49] yeah people think oh the fear of god the
[1:28:51] fear of this the fear of the no there's
[1:28:53] certain things you're gonna you should
[1:28:54] be fearing the devil
[1:28:57] yeah
[1:28:58] but
[1:28:59] you don't have to fear god or fear jesus
[1:29:01] if you're
[1:29:02] his son and daughter
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:05] praise the lord
[1:29:07] so brothers sisters thou believers say
[1:29:10] there is one god thou do us well but the
[1:29:12] devils also believe and tremble
[1:29:16] so brother we ought to tremble too
[1:29:18] considering what god has done and what
[1:29:20] god is doing
[1:29:21] amen and considering why tremble
[1:29:24] considering that we are born in sin
[1:29:28] born and we're in this in this physical
[1:29:30] body
[1:29:32] and we're believing in longing and
[1:29:33] calling
[1:29:34] for resurrection
[1:29:37] calling for a glorified body
[1:29:39] to get out of here
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:43] please
[1:29:44] don't let this message don't let what
[1:29:46] god has done don't let it become just
[1:29:48] religion to you
[1:29:50] no let it become an absolute spiritual
[1:29:53] revelation it is god
[1:29:56] dealing with you very personally
[1:30:00] god god loves you amen and he's there to
[1:30:03] reveal his word he's amen he'll hide it
[1:30:06] from others but he'll reveal it to you
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:10] you'll give this he'll give this and
[1:30:12] give that to give them this faith this
[1:30:13] faith amen
[1:30:15] but he'll keep it from the others
[1:30:17] because they're not going to honor the
[1:30:19] way the bride will
[1:30:22] glory now remember again don't
[1:30:25] because i know there's many
[1:30:28] many many many believers that that
[1:30:30] looked on their noses that others out
[1:30:32] there don't do that
[1:30:34] because we're bride
[1:30:36] but still there's some of them are going
[1:30:38] to be saved that's right
[1:30:41] they're not bride
[1:30:43] so just just commit them to the lord and
[1:30:45] move on
[1:30:46] but keep your attitude right in your
[1:30:47] spirit right and again
[1:30:50] again what the the angel rebuked the
[1:30:52] prophet when he was looking at that
[1:30:54] woman walking down the street there and
[1:30:55] he was criticizing her and the angel
[1:30:57] said don't you do that
[1:30:59] he said some of them are my children
[1:31:03] amen not bright but they're not going to
[1:31:06] be in the city they'll be outside the
[1:31:08] city
[1:31:09] but they're going to be or as we know
[1:31:11] they're going to they're going to have a
[1:31:12] right attitude right spirit because god
[1:31:14] knows the heart
[1:31:16] yeah
[1:31:16] amen
[1:31:18] well yeah and they'll they'll be
[1:31:20] certainly a new creature when they get
[1:31:21] to glory for sure
[1:31:23] amen and god god's got a lot of their
[1:31:25] faith
[1:31:26] god honors their their respect
[1:31:28] amen so again brother we're bright but
[1:31:31] don't look down your noses at anybody
[1:31:33] else
[1:31:34] that's why the problem of god would
[1:31:36] respect if he no matter sometime when he
[1:31:38] was preaching
[1:31:39] oh yeah
[1:31:41] and they think that brother brown oh
[1:31:43] what after they opened the seals brother
[1:31:45] brown was would go to a certain place
[1:31:47] where he was asked to come and preach
[1:31:48] and he would preach
[1:31:50] there in one way and when he get to
[1:31:52] where all believers were he preached
[1:31:54] another way
[1:31:55] he said brother brown why'd you do this
[1:31:57] why'd you do that i i shared the quotes
[1:31:59] a few years ago where the problem of god
[1:32:01] said well he said listen i did it
[1:32:03] because he said they're not
[1:32:05] bride
[1:32:06] so he said i'm going to minister to them
[1:32:08] he said according to the way
[1:32:11] what their faith in god
[1:32:13] oh yeah not bright
[1:32:14] you'll minister to the bride one way but
[1:32:16] he's going to minister to the others
[1:32:18] another way
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:21] god help us
[1:32:24] don't get self-righteous
[1:32:27] there's too many self-righteous
[1:32:30] don't again please in the name of jesus
[1:32:32] keep your attitude right keep your
[1:32:33] spirit right toward them all
[1:32:36] right listen
[1:32:37] oh we shouldn't oh we shouldn't deal
[1:32:39] with this one shouldn't deal with that
[1:32:41] one oh wait a minute
[1:32:44] why
[1:32:45] no
[1:32:47] and if this was in your church
[1:32:49] considering what they did you shouldn't
[1:32:50] let them do this shouldn't what
[1:32:54] brother
[1:32:55] listen
[1:32:58] jesus talked to the woman at the well
[1:33:01] now and she had
[1:33:03] he said you you have five husbands
[1:33:05] and he said one you're now living with
[1:33:07] is not your husband
[1:33:11] and you need fellowship with her
[1:33:13] oh yeah did and he offended the
[1:33:15] disciples
[1:33:17] they decided to say you're talking to
[1:33:18] that woman they knew who she was
[1:33:21] because why because the tradition back
[1:33:23] there was that
[1:33:25] you there's certain time that you would
[1:33:26] that that you could go to the wall the
[1:33:28] well to get water and there's certain
[1:33:29] times that they would go to the well and
[1:33:32] you wouldn't go
[1:33:34] because of who that woman was
[1:33:36] that was the tradition
[1:33:38] and the disciples didn't understand why
[1:33:40] jesus would go up there where that woman
[1:33:42] was
[1:33:43] and talk to her
[1:33:45] whereas the jews they they wouldn't go
[1:33:49] because at a certain time that's when
[1:33:51] they were allowed to go to the well but
[1:33:52] nobody else would go
[1:33:54] yeah
[1:33:55] yeah
[1:33:57] but jesus went and talked to her
[1:33:59] yeah
[1:34:01] he rebuked the disciples
[1:34:04] why because oh yeah he said you had five
[1:34:07] husbands the one you're now living with
[1:34:08] is not your husband
[1:34:10] and she was living in sin
[1:34:12] and he talked to her this talked to her
[1:34:14] that oh and he struck her in the heart
[1:34:16] and she took off
[1:34:18] she said oh you're the messiah
[1:34:20] and she went and she gave witness to
[1:34:22] others and they came
[1:34:28] yeah responding to her faith and they
[1:34:30] came to jesus they said oh she said they
[1:34:33] said you're right
[1:34:34] he is
[1:34:36] the messiah
[1:34:37] amen brother so you don't know who god's
[1:34:41] going to use
[1:34:43] [Laughter]
[1:34:44] amen
[1:34:46] brother we think god's going to use the
[1:34:48] the righteous but i tell you the
[1:34:49] righteous he uses is those that are
[1:34:51] righteous in jesus name

[1:34:55] oh we think oh god's going to use this
[1:34:56] when god's going to use it or they
[1:34:58] they're not guilty of anything they're
[1:34:59] not guilty of this brother god's going
[1:35:02] to use the ones that are guilty of the
[1:35:03] worse
[1:35:05] yeah amen sister that's right
[1:35:08] because why sinners saved by grace
[1:35:12] and you'll use sinners saved by grace to
[1:35:14] be a witness to you

[1:35:41] humble themselves to acknowledge that we
[1:35:42] are sinners saved by grace

[1:35:59] is one god not a trinity but one god

[1:36:26] going to be in the city with the
[1:36:27] bridegroom but the others will be
[1:36:29] outside the city
[1:36:31] and knowing that the bible also speaks
[1:36:33] of those that will bring their glory and
[1:36:35] their honor into the city
[1:36:39] but they're not bright
[1:36:42] god help us

[1:36:54] faith without works is dead
[1:36:57] amen
[1:36:59] grace of god to us
[1:37:04] it was not abraham our father
[1:37:06] justified by works
[1:37:09] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[1:37:11] the altar
[1:37:13] sees thou out faith brought with his
[1:37:16] works
[1:37:17] and by works was faith made

[1:37:56] so brother
[1:37:58] and it's not just going to church
[1:38:01] is the life you live
[1:38:03] actions reactions the testimony you're

[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:08] to the people
[1:38:10] god help us
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:14] yeah it might be where you're going to
[1:38:15] school
[1:38:16] it might be where you're going to
[1:38:17] university
[1:38:19] amen it might be where you're working
[1:38:22] but you do it as a christian
[1:38:26] and again as i said i was working with
[1:38:28] the military
[1:38:30] and basically in the kitchen
[1:38:33] and
[1:38:35] not necessarily a chef there or
[1:38:38] maybe just a cookie that i would do
[1:38:40] something here something there they
[1:38:42] would call on me to do this or calling
[1:38:43] me to do that
[1:38:44] but i remember when i was taking that
[1:38:46] break and we were in the in the in the
[1:38:48] room there
[1:38:50] with a few others that we were taking
[1:38:52] the break usually a 15-minute break
[1:38:55] and again
[1:38:59] i haven't mentioned these things very
[1:39:01] much i don't want to boast about it but
[1:39:03] give god the glory
[1:39:05] and again when i was sitting in the room
[1:39:07] with others there just for a break
[1:39:11] there was a time when uh one or two
[1:39:13] people came again looked in the room
[1:39:15] says oh uh
[1:39:17] gerald
[1:39:18] i said yes i said what do you want me to
[1:39:21] do oh we said nothing we just want to
[1:39:22] let you know that we know you're a
[1:39:24] christian
[1:39:25] we appreciate that thank you
[1:39:28] i said lord i said what's all this about
[1:39:31] is to give him the glory
[1:39:34] i tell you whether they must have
[1:39:36] reflected they must have been seeing
[1:39:37] jesus
[1:39:39] experiencing jesus
[1:39:41] hell
[1:39:42] to god be the glory
[1:39:45] and i've been serving there one time
[1:39:49] and there was a big line up and
[1:39:52] there somebody came to the part of the
[1:39:53] line
[1:39:54] and they were they mentioned some things
[1:39:56] they said there's a certain thing
[1:39:59] and there was only me
[1:40:01] and the chef there behind the counter
[1:40:04] and
[1:40:05] he sort of
[1:40:07] shocked a number of people
[1:40:09] and i said excuse me
[1:40:12] i said you shouldn't say that
[1:40:14] i said you need to repent
[1:40:17] i said ask god to forgive you
[1:40:19] amen because he made some harsh remarks
[1:40:23] what it was i don't know now i don't
[1:40:24] remember but i do remember taking my
[1:40:26] stand and and the others that were in
[1:40:28] the line oh they they agreed
[1:40:30] yep yeah good good
[1:40:32] yeah
[1:40:34] and i believe the person did repent
[1:40:38] and ask forgiveness
[1:40:40] so our brother
[1:40:42] are we reflecting our faith by our works
[1:40:46] taking your stand
[1:40:48] at work
[1:40:49] at home no matter where it is
[1:40:53] especially at church
[1:40:55] you know taking your stand for the truth
[1:40:57] take a stand for the word

[1:41:01] example to to the other brothers and

[1:41:09] a sincere heart
[1:41:10] a right spirit
[1:41:12] and the right attitude
[1:41:14] because many times over the years they
[1:41:16] all over through the through the years
[1:41:17] with this message i i've seen people
[1:41:19] with bad spirits wrong spirits wrong
[1:41:21] attitudes
[1:41:23] self-righteous
[1:41:25] you know they point their oh yeah they
[1:41:27] would point their fingers down at this
[1:41:30] one that one out there especially if
[1:41:31] they were part of a denomination i said
[1:41:34] look believe them i says may the grace
[1:41:36] of god that they'll come to the word
[1:41:38] as you leave that with the lord and then
[1:41:40] they'll go and condem believers
[1:41:42] you know point their fingers at
[1:41:43] believers
[1:41:45] whether you forget it
[1:41:47] pray one for another
[1:41:49] amen by the grace of god
[1:41:52] keep your attitude right keep your
[1:41:53] spirit right
[1:41:54] amen
[1:41:57] are you bride
[1:41:59] bring forth the works of the bride
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:08] so again in verse 20
[1:42:10] 2
[1:42:11] see is thou how faith wrought with his
[1:42:13] works and by works was faith made
[1:42:16] perfect
[1:42:18] amen the prophet of god is preaching not
[1:42:20] perfect faith but the perfect revelation
[1:42:23] of the word but it will produce
[1:42:25] the perfect works
[1:42:27] that god's looking for amen
[1:42:29] what's god looking for now
[1:42:31] yeah thank god for healing and our
[1:42:33] sister elena
[1:42:34] but god's looking for what looking for
[1:42:36] the resurrection and the rapture
[1:42:38] the change of the body
[1:42:41] praise the lord
[1:42:43] and the prophet of god did say again let
[1:42:44] me say it he said if you don't believe
[1:42:46] for healing how can you believe for the
[1:42:47] rapture
[1:42:48] that's right brother because the right
[1:42:50] because the the rapture is the total
[1:42:53] healing of the body that's right
[1:43:00] so if you're sick
[1:43:02] let's believe god
[1:43:03] amen if you're not sick let's believe
[1:43:05] god for the change of the body
[1:43:07] lord uh lord i feel this in the body i
[1:43:10] sense this in the body we got to deal
[1:43:11] with this we got to deal with that
[1:43:13] that's all right my son

[1:43:17] trust me
[1:43:19] yeah believe for the rapture
[1:43:25] believe for the resurrection
[1:43:28] again how many of us
[1:43:30] father god said god is waiting on us
[1:43:34] and then he said another place he said
[1:43:37] yes and the dead in christ are waiting
[1:43:39] on us
[1:43:42] they're right there
[1:43:45] they're not over they're not out there
[1:43:47] in the grave
[1:43:49] no
[1:43:50] no
[1:43:51] that's the old body they do they they
[1:43:53] were living in
[1:43:54] that's that's the body that was under
[1:43:56] the curse
[1:43:57] yeah
[1:44:00] but he said
[1:44:01] there's going to be dust
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:05] and so that's gone so he they're gonna
[1:44:07] receive a glorified body
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:11] oh it'll be like that one when it comes
[1:44:12] to you you see them it'll be like that
[1:44:14] only they'll be around the prophecy
[1:44:16] around 20 years old
[1:44:18] when we get into that dimension and so
[1:44:19] brother sisters they're right here
[1:44:21] they're right there when the prophet of
[1:44:23] god went beyond the curtain of time
[1:44:25] oh
[1:44:26] he saw sister hope sister mita and they
[1:44:29] came running to him
[1:44:31] oh
[1:44:32] and they thought she should see he
[1:44:33] thought they were going to call him you
[1:44:35] know their their husband or whatever and
[1:44:36] they just referred to him as a mate
[1:44:38] you know and uh and they oh they
[1:44:40] welcomed them you made it you made it
[1:44:42] praise the lord
[1:44:44] yeah
[1:44:45] they were just
[1:44:47] a brother and a sister
[1:44:49] by the grace of god
[1:44:52] you know in eternity
[1:44:56] i pray grace lord almost have more and
[1:44:58] more faith
[1:45:00] that they're not up there they're not
[1:45:02] out of that cemetery they're right here
[1:45:05] and they are waiting on us
[1:45:08] because when that hour comes that we
[1:45:10] come to that perfect faith they're going
[1:45:12] to step into time
[1:45:14] and they're going to the power of god
[1:45:16] said they're going to they're going to
[1:45:17] step in and and meet with us
[1:45:20] yeah
[1:45:20] and then he said we're going to be
[1:45:22] changed into a glorified body and go
[1:45:24] into that dimension with them
[1:45:26] and then he said praise the lord he said
[1:45:29] well then we're going to look up
[1:45:31] and see and see jesus
[1:45:33] and we're going to rise to media
[1:45:36] in the resurrection and the rapture
[1:45:38] praise the name of the lord
[1:45:41] hallelujah
[1:45:42] god help us brother sister
[1:45:44] to have that perfect faith
[1:45:47] that god's required in this hour for the
[1:45:49] resurrection and for the rapture
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:56] so again verse 22 sees thou faith
[1:45:59] wrought with his works and by works was
[1:46:02] faith made perfect so is your faith made
[1:46:05] perfect by your works
[1:46:10] is your faith made perfect by the life
[1:46:11] you live in your actions and reactions
[1:46:15] amen so that god can trust you for more
[1:46:18] and more and more faith
[1:46:20] with more and more faith
[1:46:22] yeah
[1:46:24] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:46:26] saith abraham believed god
[1:46:28] and it was imputed unto him
[1:46:30] for righteousness
[1:46:32] and he was called the friend of god
[1:46:36] and you see then how that by works a man
[1:46:40] is justified
[1:46:42] i trust by grace that we're the friend
[1:46:44] of god
[1:46:48] that by works we are justified and not
[1:46:51] by faith only
[1:46:53] and many preach
[1:46:56] that it's only by faith
[1:46:58] no
[1:47:00] according to
[1:47:02] according to the the the scriptures
[1:47:04] right here it is faith and works because
[1:47:06] i tell you faith without works is dead
[1:47:11] but if it's faith producing the works
[1:47:13] then then it's a living faith and it's
[1:47:15] god in you is christ in you
[1:47:17] living it out
[1:47:19] amen
[1:47:23] oh my we got to have the balance of the
[1:47:26] revealed word
[1:47:27] you see then how by works a man is
[1:47:29] justified and not by faith only and
[1:47:31] likewise also was not rahab the harlot
[1:47:34] justified by works when she had received
[1:47:37] the messengers
[1:47:39] and had sent them out another way
[1:47:41] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:47:44] dead
[1:47:45] so faith without works is dead also
[1:47:49] if you truly got faith
[1:47:52] you will have the works that reflect the
[1:47:54] faith
[1:47:56] amen
[1:48:00] bear with me
[1:48:02] i'll try not to be too much longer
[1:48:13] he said faith
[1:48:15] this is the prophet
[1:48:17] in the message perfect faith
[1:48:19] he said faith is based
[1:48:21] on forgiveness
[1:48:24] a forgiving spirit
[1:48:29] and he said
[1:48:31] as we said this morning trying to get
[1:48:33] the church into the place to where we
[1:48:35] could really see apostolic times moving
[1:48:38] among us
[1:48:40] and he said it's just laying right at
[1:48:42] the door
[1:48:43] and we want it such a flow
[1:48:45] he said it'll be
[1:48:47] it'll be a help to us
[1:48:49] he said flow out to others
[1:48:52] and remember he said jesus
[1:48:56] he said he never used his power for
[1:48:58] himself
[1:48:59] he used it for others
[1:49:01] that's what it was said for and brother
[1:49:04] if we got the same anointing the same
[1:49:06] holy ghost in us we're living for others
[1:49:10] not just you and you ignore your
[1:49:12] brothers and sisters no you're there to
[1:49:13] help them you're praying for them
[1:49:16] you know
[1:49:17] god help us
[1:49:20] and you think sometimes he said why
[1:49:23] would a man that was so full of power
[1:49:25] like jesus would have to be ever ever be
[1:49:28] sick
[1:49:29] yes sir i read in some books somewhere
[1:49:32] where when we he raised up that boy the
[1:49:35] widow's son from nain
[1:49:37] and he said and he sat on a rock and
[1:49:39] groaned with a headache
[1:49:41] yeah
[1:49:43] and he said he bore our infirmity
[1:49:46] and he and to bear those infirmities
[1:49:48] means that he packed them
[1:49:50] and he said he had sickness he had
[1:49:52] temptations he had trouble he had
[1:49:55] frustrations just as we have because he
[1:49:58] had to be the right kind of a mediator
[1:50:01] amen so he had to be a partaker and the
[1:50:04] husband man of the fruit
[1:50:07] amen
[1:50:09] before he would know
[1:50:10] and the woman at the well and many
[1:50:12] things see they looked right into the
[1:50:14] scriptures amen jesus came to identify
[1:50:18] with you and me and to experience what
[1:50:19] you and i experience
[1:50:21] and he did
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:25] he did but he said not
[1:50:29] now he said we want to speak
[1:50:31] upon faith
[1:50:32] a different type of faith
[1:50:35] perfect faith
[1:50:37] he said that's a great thing
[1:50:39] and he said faith we're told in the
[1:50:41] bible faith cometh by hearing and you
[1:50:44] cannot be saved without faith and faith
[1:50:46] is something that you have to believe
[1:50:48] it's there that really nothing else will
[1:50:51] declare it
[1:50:52] but faith
[1:50:54] amen
[1:50:55] he that cometh to god must believe that
[1:50:58] he is
[1:50:59] and it's impossible to please god
[1:51:02] without faith
[1:51:04] and he said if you could see him
[1:51:06] it would be no more faith
[1:51:08] but he said you don't see god
[1:51:10] physically but spiritually
[1:51:13] amen god is there
[1:51:18] yeah and he's with you day in and day
[1:51:20] out he's there to help you he's there to
[1:51:22] encourage you he's there to reveal this
[1:51:24] reveal that do this do that
[1:51:27] where are you lord
[1:51:29] the works that you see is him he's there
[1:51:34] do you believe
[1:51:36] is he with you at home
[1:51:39] is he with you in your in your job
[1:51:42] i pray gracious with you in the church
[1:51:46] remember again
[1:51:49] he comes with
[1:51:50] the saints
[1:51:52] but the prophet told us the first one in
[1:51:55] church is the devil
[1:51:58] yeah
[1:52:00] yeah
[1:52:01] so i trust you come with jesus
[1:52:04] why because you got the devil to deal
[1:52:06] with
[1:52:08] amen
[1:52:09] most definitely he's there why because
[1:52:11] he's there to challenge the word
[1:52:13] he's there to challenge your worship
[1:52:16] amen oh brother sister god tells us that
[1:52:19] we're going to come with faith
[1:52:21] amen through our lord jesus christ
[1:52:25] and listen he said
[1:52:29] he said if you could see him it would be
[1:52:31] no more faith
[1:52:33] so anything that senses declares is no
[1:52:35] more faith it's a scientific fact it's
[1:52:38] not no more faith he said you have to
[1:52:40] accept him by faith
[1:52:43] he that cometh to god must believe that
[1:52:45] god
[1:52:46] must believe god and faith comes by
[1:52:48] hearing the word
[1:52:50] see you must believe
[1:52:52] he said this is god's word and you must
[1:52:54] come to god by the word just take the
[1:52:57] word amen and god's been dealing with
[1:53:00] you today today this afternoon god's
[1:53:03] dealing with you with through the word
[1:53:06] not brother gerald
[1:53:08] amen brother
[1:53:09] no it's not brother journal
[1:53:12] yeah and when you're back in the wild is
[1:53:14] it
[1:53:15] it's not temp brother temp road
[1:53:17] it's god
[1:53:19] yeah he's dealing with the people
[1:53:20] through the word
[1:53:22] oh
[1:53:23] well the bible says you know that god
[1:53:25] has through the ministry of the bible
[1:53:26] ministry god has set in the church amen
[1:53:30] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:53:34] so
[1:53:35] i can't do it
[1:53:36] in myself
[1:53:38] but again it's like the prophet of god
[1:53:40] said
[1:53:41] amen when he would come he would preach
[1:53:44] and then he would move get move into the
[1:53:46] the realm of of healing and praying for
[1:53:48] the sick now he said i got to get out of
[1:53:50] the way
[1:53:52] yeah i got to get out of the way so he
[1:53:54] could take over
[1:53:55] so he said because i said i can't do
[1:53:57] this
[1:53:58] and he couldn't
[1:54:00] he needed the holy ghost to do it he
[1:54:02] needed the anointing to do it
[1:54:04] discerning the thoughts and intentions
[1:54:05] of the heart and declare thus saith the
[1:54:07] lord you're healed thus saith the lord
[1:54:09] this thus saith the lord that amen god
[1:54:11] help us
[1:54:14] get yourself out of the way
[1:54:16] so that jesus has controlled you now
[1:54:20] amen he's ministering the word
[1:54:22] and he's receiving the word
[1:54:25] oh he's there to give you the word he's
[1:54:27] there he's in you to keep to take the
[1:54:28] word
[1:54:29] to become one with the word
[1:54:31] hallelujah
[1:54:35] he said listen
[1:54:38] abraham had to believe just what the
[1:54:40] voice told him
[1:54:42] amen
[1:54:43] that's the truth
[1:54:44] and again they never read the scriptures
[1:54:46] like you and i have
[1:54:48] you know to go back and and they'll read
[1:54:50] read the bible
[1:54:51] well i i believe god this i believe god
[1:54:53] that no no brother god was giving to
[1:54:55] them and they they had to write what god
[1:54:57] what you and i are reading now
[1:55:01] it was their experience
[1:55:03] is their faith
[1:55:05] oh yeah
[1:55:06] brother from genesis to revelation it's
[1:55:08] a revelation of faith
[1:55:10] the faith the faith of the of
[1:55:12] of the prophets the faith of abel and
[1:55:15] cain and the faith of yes of isaac and
[1:55:18] and and jeremiah and so on right on
[1:55:20] through
[1:55:21] to the faith of john the revelator
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:26] god revealed himself
[1:55:29] through
[1:55:30] them to the elect
[1:55:33] hallelujah
[1:55:36] see faith by hearing the word
[1:55:43] so where did faith get where did abel
[1:55:44] get the faith
[1:55:46] god must have spoke to abel in his heart
[1:55:49] not not just hearing the word with this
[1:55:51] these ears
[1:55:53] let him that hath an ear
[1:55:55] not ears
[1:55:56] let him that earthen ear hear the word
[1:56:00] amen
[1:56:01] where is that where is it it's in the
[1:56:03] heart
[1:56:06] there's too many think oh god i'm going
[1:56:08] to hear the word
[1:56:10] with these ears
[1:56:11] no
[1:56:14] got to hear it in your heart hear it in
[1:56:15] your heart
[1:56:16] by the grace of god
[1:56:22] that's like god ministering the word
[1:56:24] and there can be there can be two people
[1:56:27] and one said oh yeah that's right that's
[1:56:28] right and the other one say
[1:56:31] i don't understand what he's talking
[1:56:32] about
[1:56:33] where's the other follow those
[1:56:36] why because one is getting it in the
[1:56:37] heart and the other one is getting it in
[1:56:39] your head
[1:56:41] amen
[1:56:43] god's in the heart
[1:56:44] revealing his word
[1:56:47] amen i trust god is in your heart
[1:56:50] revealing his word to you
[1:56:54] amen and that what that praying the
[1:56:57] grace of god that that's why you're here
[1:56:59] and that's why you're going to church is
[1:57:00] because of the word
[1:57:04] amen there's a hunger and a thirst for
[1:57:06] the word
[1:57:07] and why because faith comes by hearing
[1:57:10] the word
[1:57:12] and you want to hear the word the word
[1:57:14] the word
[1:57:15] amen amen
[1:57:19] oh brother i got a bible so i can read
[1:57:21] it
[1:57:22] yes
[1:57:23] that's that's fine that's good
[1:57:25] but again you got to hear it preach
[1:57:27] because god has set in the church
[1:57:30] this ministry of that ministry for the
[1:57:32] perfecting of the saints it's not just
[1:57:34] to get you to read the bible
[1:57:35] intellectually but for you to hear the
[1:57:38] word being preached
[1:57:39] and trust that is not being preached
[1:57:40] intellectually but spiritually
[1:57:42] spiritual revelation
[1:57:46] amen
[1:57:50] he said again faith is actual substance
[1:57:54] amen of what god reveals
[1:58:00] now he said these are real deep lessons
[1:58:02] and i'll catch the top of it and then
[1:58:04] you go you dig down into it

[1:58:21] brother to get the faith that god
[1:58:23] god has ordained
[1:58:25] to us in the message of the hour
[1:58:28] oh yeah it's not just
[1:58:30] the opening of the seals and this
[1:58:33] and and the revelation of the guardian
[1:58:35] the revelation of water baptism the rest
[1:58:37] of the that's all is it but again
[1:58:40] brother the faith that god god wants all
[1:58:42] of that to give us the faith that
[1:58:44] pleases him
[1:58:45] amen that honors god respects god
[1:58:48] amen to get to get our attention
[1:58:50] oh brother sister what's it ordained for
[1:58:54] the brother ended all god did this
[1:58:56] through in the message of the earth
[1:58:57] there are three pools god did this god
[1:58:59] did this god did that but brother all of
[1:59:01] it is to bring us to resurrection and
[1:59:03] rapturing faith
[1:59:06] amen all that god did in luther was to
[1:59:08] bring him to justification and wrestling
[1:59:11] sanctification the pentecostals the
[1:59:13] baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of
[1:59:15] the spirit amen
[1:59:17] but brother now what god has done now is
[1:59:20] to is to give us
[1:59:21] yeah
[1:59:22] we got the faith of justification we got
[1:59:25] the faith of sanctification we got the
[1:59:27] faith of the gifts
[1:59:29] and the baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:59:30] now
[1:59:31] brother god is giving us the faith for
[1:59:33] the resurrection rapture to get out of
[1:59:35] here
[1:59:38] god gave them the faith to do this faith
[1:59:39] to do that but now he's given us the
[1:59:41] faith
[1:59:42] to go from time to eternity
[1:59:45] let's be more conscious of eternity
[1:59:49] and less of time
[1:59:51] god help us
[1:59:56] he said these are real deep lessons but
[1:59:58] he said i'll catch the top of it you dig
[2:00:00] down deep into it
[2:00:02] and he said notice that it's something
[2:00:04] that you possess
[2:00:05] not imagination
[2:00:07] yes you really have it it's just as real
[2:00:10] amen as you know that you're sitting in
[2:00:13] a church it's just as real as you hear
[2:00:15] my voice
[2:00:17] and it's a substance not imagination it
[2:00:20] is not emotion
[2:00:21] but it is something that you have
[2:00:25] and it comes to you by hearing the word
[2:00:27] of god
[2:00:29] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[2:00:31] word of god
[2:00:32] and that puts it back to where you your
[2:00:35] faith then is not in some individual is
[2:00:38] not in a man he said it's in god because
[2:00:41] god is the word and your faith is in god
[2:00:47] amen
[2:00:49] well it's in the word yeah
[2:00:51] god is the word
[2:00:57] he said you see somebody else he said do
[2:01:00] something by a word act of god a promise
[2:01:03] of god many of them say i can do that
[2:01:05] too
[2:01:06] and when they do you find them wrecked
[2:01:09] up out there somewhere it's got to be
[2:01:12] substance
[2:01:13] that now he said that is
[2:01:15] that is potentially a faith but when
[2:01:18] it's revealed to you it's a faith a
[2:01:21] perfect faith
[2:01:23] that cannot fail
[2:01:25] amen if it's revealed to you
[2:01:28] amen
[2:01:30] grace
[2:01:31] he said you must hear the word
[2:01:34] god's word is that all sufficient word
[2:01:36] and it's all you have need of is this
[2:01:39] word
[2:01:40] amen
[2:01:41] for there's many times that people have
[2:01:44] faith today tomorrow they haven't got
[2:01:46] faith
[2:01:48] the next day there's something
[2:01:50] but when god once anchors it you see
[2:01:53] there's nothing ever going to make you
[2:01:55] move from
[2:01:57] real faith
[2:01:59] amen
[2:02:01] no no
[2:02:03] once it strikes you in the heart that's
[2:02:04] it
[2:02:06] if it's only in your head oh yeah the
[2:02:08] devil will
[2:02:09] change it
[2:02:10] yeah
[2:02:11] if it's in the heart no
[2:02:15] it's forever see
[2:02:17] forever settled
[2:02:20] he said i want you to get this now the
[2:02:22] church has got to lift itself in the
[2:02:24] power of god how he said we are too
[2:02:27] close to the end now and i believe the
[2:02:30] church
[2:02:31] is in condition where we can teach it a
[2:02:33] little deeper things
[2:02:35] and rub some of this make-believe out
[2:02:37] and get into something real
[2:02:40] he said it's got to be something that
[2:02:42] you know
[2:02:44] amen
[2:02:45] you know it to be the truth
[2:02:48] he said god uses man
[2:02:51] man only
[2:02:52] god doesn't use machinery
[2:02:54] god doesn't use groups of man god
[2:02:57] doesn't use organizations
[2:02:59] god uses individuals always
[2:03:02] amen
[2:03:03] amen
[2:03:06] he said others have people come say oh i
[2:03:09] got all faith oh i sure have
[2:03:12] well what are you standing there for
[2:03:15] he said you your very actions prove you
[2:03:18] haven't got what you're talking about
[2:03:21] amen
[2:03:22] grace that we're going to go forth and
[2:03:24] live it
[2:03:24] amen
[2:03:26] what we talk we'll live
[2:03:28] by the grace of god
[2:03:31] brother
[2:03:33] you believe in the resurrection rapture
[2:03:35] you're going to live the life
[2:03:37] that's looking for the resurrection

[2:03:40] that's expecting the resurrection
[2:03:42] rapture

[2:07:32] us
[2:07:33] amen
[2:07:34] as i've said
[2:07:36] i remember going to a
[2:07:40] meeting
[2:07:41] in gamble
[2:07:43] and uh i remember when i i got out of a
[2:07:46] a not necessarily a vehicle i guess i
[2:07:47] don't know but i remember before i went
[2:07:50] into brother and sister barnes home and
[2:07:51] i looked
[2:07:52] up to the end of the town where where i
[2:07:55] was living at the time and right at the
[2:07:57] right on the
[2:07:59] on the where the the sky and the earth
[2:08:02] met i said oh
[2:08:04] what what in the world is that
[2:08:07] oh brother it was almost like this here
[2:08:10] but i could see and oh it was all
[2:08:13] it was just lit right up
[2:08:15] the rest of the sky was all dark but on
[2:08:17] the on the on the border there red
[2:08:20] blah blah broth above the earth was all
[2:08:23] this this light
[2:08:24] and it was like
[2:08:26] something like this i said this is and i
[2:08:29] was just a young boy
[2:08:30] i was just maybe
[2:08:32] in my late teens
[2:08:34] yeah when i saw it
[2:08:36] i said thank you lord
[2:08:38] amen
[2:08:40] had another time too
[2:08:42] i was
[2:08:44] just giving the experience
[2:08:48] i was
[2:08:49] in a home here in st john's east
[2:08:52] where my parents lived and i remember
[2:08:54] lying in a bed there
[2:08:57] and i turned
[2:08:59] i was praying and reading my bible and i
[2:09:02] just turned back
[2:09:03] laid back
[2:09:04] on the bed
[2:09:06] and when i did
[2:09:08] i looked
[2:09:12] and i saw the mountain
[2:09:16] you did yeah
[2:09:17] and there was the mountain
[2:09:19] and i and i climbed the mountain
[2:09:24] to see jesus
[2:09:28] they said yeah i said yeah
[2:09:30] i said oh lord oh lord
[2:09:33] i said don't leave me don't leave me
[2:09:37] amen i fell back on the bed and it
[2:09:40] disappeared
[2:09:43] amen
[2:09:44] do god be the glory
[2:09:46] i've had many experiences over the years
[2:09:49] of things that i have seen things that
[2:09:51] god has done
[2:09:53] for me and things that god has revealed
[2:10:02] he said again
[2:10:04] if you had perfect faith
[2:10:07] you would look right straight to god
[2:10:10] amen
[2:10:12] because your faith
[2:10:13] has done made it
[2:10:15] you have no need of these things he said
[2:10:18] do this do that no faith is done
[2:10:21] amen
[2:10:24] he said your genuine faith would do it
[2:10:26] right there he said look at that little
[2:10:29] woman with the blood issue
[2:10:32] and she said if i can only touch the
[2:10:34] border of his garment i'll be made well
[2:10:38] and as soon as she did it she said she
[2:10:40] felt within herself that her blood issue
[2:10:42] stopped she actually believed it
[2:10:46] do we believe
[2:10:48] as she believed for that do we believe
[2:10:50] for the resurrection and the rapture
[2:10:53] we're believing for the change of our
[2:10:54] body
[2:10:55] as sister
[2:10:57] atlanta was believing for the healing of
[2:10:59] her body
[2:11:01] so let's believe for the change
[2:11:04] amen
[2:11:06] hallelujah
[2:11:07] and brother
[2:11:08] that if she ran up down the aisles in
[2:11:10] the church
[2:11:12] that we're gonna run up and down
[2:11:14] in glory
[2:11:16] amen
[2:11:17] praise the lord
[2:11:23] he said now listen
[2:11:25] at first the disciples did not have this
[2:11:27] perfect faith
[2:11:29] they didn't have it because they had
[2:11:31] christ walking with him but then
[2:11:34] afterwards christ was in them
[2:11:36] and so you see it's hard then to have
[2:11:38] that perfect faith without the holy
[2:11:41] spirit
[2:11:42] it has to bring it
[2:11:44] and it does
[2:11:46] now you say the disciples didn't have
[2:11:47] perfect faith no for they had an
[2:11:50] epileptic child there
[2:11:52] that they were trying to cast this devil
[2:11:54] out of them and they couldn't do it
[2:11:56] and as the father seen jesus coming he
[2:11:59] said we have brought thy son to your
[2:12:02] disciple
[2:12:03] my son to your disciples and they could
[2:12:05] not cure him
[2:12:07] and afterwards the disciples asked jesus
[2:12:09] saying why could not we cure him and
[2:12:12] jesus said because of the lack of faith
[2:12:15] he said of your unbelief
[2:12:17] amen now remember they had the power
[2:12:20] jesus had given them power to heal the
[2:12:22] sick
[2:12:23] raised the dead cast out devils just a
[2:12:26] few days before
[2:12:27] but they had the power but not the faith
[2:12:30] to use the power
[2:12:32] amen he's given it to us let's have the
[2:12:34] faith to use it
[2:12:36] please in the name of jesus
[2:12:40] now he said here is the random
[2:12:42] tabernacle
[2:12:43] there's the church the bride today the
[2:12:45] holy spirit is here with the power but
[2:12:48] you haven't got that faith to move it
[2:12:50] see what i mean it takes faith to move
[2:12:53] it
[2:12:54] perfect faith to ignite the power of the
[2:12:57] holy spirit which we have now
[2:13:00] that's
[2:13:01] brother
[2:13:02] we need
[2:13:04] that faith
[2:13:07] we want to get out of here we want to go
[2:13:09] into a resurrection want to go into the
[2:13:10] rapture let's focus on our faith
[2:13:14] amen by the grace of god that we're
[2:13:16] going to be built up in the most holy
[2:13:18] faith
[2:13:20] and thank god that luther had faith
[2:13:23] wesley had faith the early pentecostals
[2:13:25] had the faith amen
[2:13:28] but now brother and sister
[2:13:30] god's looking for your faith
[2:13:33] in you and in me
[2:13:35] for the resurrection
[2:13:37] he did this he did this he did that he
[2:13:39] did that but now he wants to
[2:13:42] manifest the resurrection and rapture
[2:13:45] not only in jesus but jesus in you and
[2:13:47] me
[2:13:49] by the holy ghost
[2:13:52] and that's why god has done what he's
[2:13:53] done in this hour and in this age in
[2:13:55] sending the a prophet with the revealed
[2:13:58] word amen
[2:14:00] and confirmed is confirmed the ministry
[2:14:02] of the prophet with his own presence
[2:14:04] amen to get the attention of the bride
[2:14:07] and to give the bride the faith that he
[2:14:09] wants the bride to have
[2:14:11] to to be resurrected and raptured
[2:14:16] he said could you compare a christian
[2:14:18] today with them christians of long ago
[2:14:21] how them disciples walked in the power
[2:14:23] of the spirit moved by the holy ghost
[2:14:26] and he said just a prisoner as i
[2:14:28] preached on the other night a prisoner
[2:14:30] to the word
[2:14:32] and the will of god and he couldn't even
[2:14:34] move until god moved him wouldn't you
[2:14:36] like to see a church rise like that it's
[2:14:39] going to
[2:14:40] it's going back
[2:14:42] it's got to come
[2:14:44] he said it's on the road
[2:14:45] right now
[2:14:47] for the word identified himself
[2:14:50] what he was
[2:14:51] and the same word identifies us
[2:14:54] god help us
[2:14:56] amen
[2:14:57] and when it comes to being a prisoner
[2:14:59] for the word to the word
[2:15:02] we think if we go into jail we're a
[2:15:04] prisoner
[2:15:06] no you're a prisoner to the word now
[2:15:08] are you a prisoner now
[2:15:11] to the word
[2:15:13] you're just in the word if you're if
[2:15:15] you're in a natural jail you can't get
[2:15:17] out
[2:15:19] you're bound in
[2:15:20] oh i'm in prison
[2:15:22] yeah
[2:15:23] are we prisoners to the word
[2:15:26] by the grace of god
[2:15:28] yeah
[2:15:30] we're bound to the word for the word
[2:15:34] amen
[2:15:38] he said if you are a believer
[2:15:40] recognize yourself as a believer
[2:15:43] and recognize that these things are for
[2:15:46] you and if there's condemnation in your
[2:15:48] life straighten that first
[2:15:50] and believe
[2:15:52] amen
[2:15:56] he says jesus lived in a world that no
[2:15:58] one knowed about
[2:15:59] he was a hard person he lived in a world
[2:16:02] of perfect faith in the perfect god
[2:16:06] and if we live in a perfect faith of a
[2:16:08] christian to what we are we'd be a
[2:16:11] mystic to the world
[2:16:13] and the people wouldn't understand you
[2:16:15] you'd walk in the spirit and that's the
[2:16:18] way it is to all believers they are
[2:16:20] mystics
[2:16:22] and he said the people don't understand
[2:16:23] because they live in a world to
[2:16:25] themselves and jesus lived in a world
[2:16:27] that nobody else could touch the
[2:16:29] disciples couldn't understand him and
[2:16:31] when he spoke to them
[2:16:33] they they say this and they said that
[2:16:36] this is why you talk like in riddles he
[2:16:39] said we don't understand this how can
[2:16:41] this be
[2:16:43] and so when a man lives by faith walks
[2:16:46] by faith
[2:16:47] substance faith is isolated from the
[2:16:50] entire world
[2:16:52] i trust we have that faith so that we
[2:16:53] are totally separated unto the lord
[2:16:55] totally separated onto the resurrection
[2:16:58] totally separated to the rapture we are
[2:17:00] spiritual
[2:17:01] not religious
[2:17:03] spiritual
[2:17:04] by the holy ghost if you're spiritual
[2:17:07] god is
[2:17:09] catching us up with the revealed word
[2:17:11] for this hour
[2:17:12] luther for his day wesley for his day
[2:17:14] the pentecostals were their day and us
[2:17:17] for this hour
[2:17:19] the bride
[2:17:20] this is a bright age
[2:17:22] not a pentecostal age it's a bright age
[2:17:25] amen
[2:17:26] and brother
[2:17:28] he said
[2:17:30] when a man lives by faith walks by faith
[2:17:32] and i mean substance faith he is
[2:17:35] isolated from the entire world
[2:17:38] and becomes a new christian a new
[2:17:40] creature in christ
[2:17:41] now he said there now you're getting
[2:17:43] into bride material
[2:17:47] you're getting into a rapturing
[2:17:49] condition
[2:17:50] and that means for each one of us amen
[2:17:54] not just the pastor
[2:17:56] not just the deacons or the trustees
[2:17:58] that means for the laity and he said
[2:18:01] every individual walks in a world with
[2:18:03] god alone and you're baptized into this
[2:18:06] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[2:18:08] you and god he gives the orders and you
[2:18:11] pack them out
[2:18:13] whatever god says
[2:18:15] there's not a shadow of doubt anywhere
[2:18:18] you walk right on
[2:18:20] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[2:18:22] the world can talk you out of it
[2:18:24] amen
[2:18:25] he said you're coming into that perfect
[2:18:27] faith
[2:18:28] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[2:18:32] faith never fails yes
[2:18:35] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[2:18:37] faith and so it is now with those who
[2:18:40] have perfect faith are a mystic to
[2:18:42] others
[2:18:43] amen and we are taught to resist the
[2:18:45] devil and he will flee from us
[2:18:48] resist is to just simply turn him down
[2:18:51] amen
[2:18:53] and that is to just walk away from it
[2:18:56] amen faith believes that god will work
[2:18:59] it out i don't know how long he's going
[2:19:01] he's going to do it he'll do it anyhow
[2:19:04] amen
[2:19:05] because what faith will master all
[2:19:08] circumstances
[2:19:11] amen that's the truth that's right
[2:19:13] sister
[2:19:14] and he said have faith and love is real
[2:19:18] relations
[2:19:19] because you can't have faith unless you
[2:19:22] got love
[2:19:23] because your faith is in a god who is
[2:19:26] the very essence of love
[2:19:28] faith and love works together
[2:19:31] amen
[2:19:33] brother there's many with faith but they
[2:19:35] don't have laws
[2:19:36] that's the truth
[2:19:39] and brother if you've got love you're
[2:19:40] going to show it
[2:19:42] well brother if you got it
[2:19:43] it's just automatically
[2:19:46] going to
[2:19:47] express itself
[2:19:49] yeah
[2:19:50] not just natural law the spiritual law
[2:19:53] praise the lord
[2:19:58] remember again that jesus said if you
[2:20:00] say to this mountain be moved
[2:20:02] don't doubt
[2:20:04] he said but believe that what you said
[2:20:05] will come to pass you can have it
[2:20:08] amen that puts you back in the word
[2:20:12] now he said that's not skim milk
[2:20:14] he said it puts you back
[2:20:16] i know it's going to jump over the top
[2:20:19] of you here
[2:20:20] because he said it can't anchor because
[2:20:23] but he said real genuine faith catches
[2:20:26] that right now
[2:20:27] amen
[2:20:28] he said oh where should we be
[2:20:31] there's perfect faith
[2:20:33] no vision just speak the word
[2:20:36] never saw the squirrel he just said the
[2:20:38] scriptures
[2:20:40] what it was he said speak the word and
[2:20:42] that prophet spoke the squirrel into
[2:20:44] existence
[2:20:46] he says speak it don't doubt
[2:20:48] he said and i took god at his word
[2:20:52] amen
[2:20:55] i have to try to
[2:21:00] amen
[2:21:02] let me
[2:21:03] finish this message with this quote
[2:21:08] listen he said this is now coming into
[2:21:11] that third poll
[2:21:14] amen
[2:21:15] he said i'm working out something
[2:21:18] it's taking this charge of faith
[2:21:21] and going right back to begin and come
[2:21:23] in
[2:21:24] to kind of raise faith listen
[2:21:28] he said to kind of raise faith in a
[2:21:30] bracket
[2:21:31] where you have never noticed it that way
[2:21:34] before
[2:21:35] so where's our faith
[2:21:40] has our faith increased
[2:21:42] not just the revelation of this doctrine
[2:21:44] or that doctrine
[2:21:45] but the faith to believe and claim what
[2:21:48] god is doing
[2:21:52] listen
[2:21:56] he said not a faith
[2:21:58] but a perfect faith
[2:22:01] and he said watch a perfect god with a
[2:22:03] perfect heart keep a perfect promise by
[2:22:06] his perfect word amen which is sharper
[2:22:10] than a two-edged sword and a deserter of
[2:22:12] the thoughts of the heart
[2:22:14] and he said we are coming now to the
[2:22:17] perfection
[2:22:18] because the people as to come to this
[2:22:21] in order for the rapture
[2:22:24] so have we come and are we coming to
[2:22:26] that perfection
[2:22:31] perfect faith
[2:22:33] that you're living for god you're living
[2:22:36] you love the lord he loves you
[2:22:38] and you just live for him
[2:22:40] and your son as sons and daughters were
[2:22:42] led by his spirit
[2:22:45] he controls you
[2:22:46] he's controlling your love
[2:22:48] your your life is controlling your job
[2:22:50] he's controlling your actions and
[2:22:52] reactions with family and friends and
[2:22:54] neighbors you see god in control
[2:22:57] family friends and neighbors are not
[2:22:58] dealing with mom and dad brother sister
[2:23:02] cousins uncles and aunts they're dealing
[2:23:04] with jesus
[2:23:07] amazing
[2:23:09] dealing with jesus
[2:23:14] he said we're coming now to that
[2:23:16] perfection because the bible has to come
[2:23:17] to this in order for the rapture amen
[2:23:21] so have we got that perfect faith for
[2:23:23] the rapture
[2:23:24] and that's what's holding it away right
[2:23:26] now is waiting for that church to come
[2:23:29] to that perfect raptured faith
[2:23:35] we're still here because god's waiting
[2:23:40] i don't think the bride's gone
[2:23:42] if the bride's gone why am i still here
[2:23:46] if the bride's gone why are you still
[2:23:47] here
[2:23:55] i'm looking for it it means a lot of
[2:23:57] shaking down for me
[2:23:59] and it means a lot of shaking down for
[2:24:00] you
[2:24:02] but together we'll make it by the grace
[2:24:04] of god
[2:24:06] amen
[2:24:10] and he brings his message to a close and
[2:24:11] he said don't you love him and he said
[2:24:14] right now already begin a work in your
[2:24:16] body
[2:24:18] of your healing because that he promised
[2:24:20] it would happen
[2:24:22] and he said he said listen
[2:24:25] did you catch what i was saying tonight
[2:24:27] he said have you got the riddle of it
[2:24:30] he said if you say to this mountain
[2:24:33] don't doubt but believe
[2:24:36] amen
[2:24:37] he said i'm your brother
[2:24:39] standing as your brother an intercessor
[2:24:41] and i'm trying my best to hold you
[2:24:44] before god and i'm standing here right
[2:24:46] before the white throne
[2:24:48] he said pointing my finger to that
[2:24:49] bloody sacrifice and speaking through
[2:24:52] his name
[2:24:53] that it is
[2:24:54] done grace to perfect faith
[2:24:59] amen
[2:25:02] there's still some thoughts here that
[2:25:03] i've never expressed concerning faith
[2:25:08] amen maybe we'll do that another time
[2:25:11] we'll see
[2:25:12] as the lord leads
[2:25:14] but just to share this with you
[2:25:19] that the prophet preached
[2:25:22] 23 sermons on the subject of faith
[2:25:27] 23
[2:25:31] and the last sermon
[2:25:33] was perfect faith
[2:25:38] no
[2:25:39] the last sermon he preached on faith was
[2:25:42] november 1965 and it was entitled works
[2:25:45] is faith expressed
[2:25:48] so does your works reflect your
[2:25:50] faith amen
[2:25:56] and what is your faith expressing now
[2:25:59] it's not just going to church
[2:26:02] but again is it in your job in your home
[2:26:06] in your in your relationship with family
[2:26:08] friends and neighbors
[2:26:10] you're expressing faith
[2:26:12] amazing
[2:26:14] absolutely amazing
[2:26:20] in 1965
[2:26:22] before the rapture message
[2:26:25] the prophet referenced faith
[2:26:27] 36 times
[2:26:33] after the rapture message
[2:26:36] he referenced faith
[2:26:37] only
[2:26:38] six times
[2:26:44] from 1963 to
[2:26:46] 1964 amen
[2:26:51] he spoke of faith
[2:26:57] 1610 times
[2:27:02] that was from 1963 and 1964 just two
[2:27:06] years before the opening of the seals
[2:27:12] in 1962
[2:27:21] he referenced faith
[2:27:26] 1297 times
[2:27:28] amazing
[2:27:35] so is
[2:27:37] not
[2:27:39] i would say it is normal to preach on
[2:27:41] faith
[2:27:43] if he highlighted faith faith faith
[2:27:46] faith so often
[2:27:48] amen
[2:27:50] just think
[2:27:52] 1961
[2:27:56] amen
[2:28:00] let's see
[2:28:04] oh no through his entire message
[2:28:07] he emphasized oh yeah through his entire
[2:28:09] message
[2:28:10] he preached and emphasized faith
[2:28:14] 1610 times
[2:28:18] amen
[2:28:21] in 1961 just 94 times in 1960
[2:28:26] almost 900 times
[2:28:29] amen
[2:28:30] that he preached faith
[2:28:33] god help us brother
[2:28:36] to put the emphasis on faith as much as
[2:28:38] the prophet did
[2:28:40] faith faith faith
[2:28:43] amen just think
[2:28:45] that he
[2:28:46] emphasized emphasize emphasize faith
[2:28:50] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[2:28:52] times in his ministry

[2:28:57] i pray grace that we have the faith that
[2:28:59] pleases god
[2:29:01] amen and the question is do you control
[2:29:04] faith or does faith control you
[2:29:09] there are many that control faith
[2:29:11] but how many let faith control them
[2:29:14] so that you're going to live by faith
[2:29:17] by the grace of god
[2:29:20] amen
[2:29:27] praise the lord so many thoughts
[2:29:34] faith is a revelation of how
[2:29:37] what and how god wants us to do it
[2:29:40] amen by grace
[2:29:44] the first message that the prophet
[2:29:47] recorded
[2:29:48] on faith
[2:29:50] is entitled faith is the substance
[2:29:53] 1947
[2:29:55] and the last recorded message on faith
[2:29:58] is works is faith expressed
