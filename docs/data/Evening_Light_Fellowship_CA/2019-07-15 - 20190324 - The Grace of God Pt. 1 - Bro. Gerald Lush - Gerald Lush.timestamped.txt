[54:14] [Music]
[54:28] a man preach the name of the Lord God
[54:35] bless you turn with me to Zechariah
[54:38] chapter 4 and again to remember in
[54:44] prayer the family of the young man that
[54:49] died in gamble just a few days ago
[54:55] to my knowledge I'd never met him but
[54:58] again as I've said regarding his
[55:01] grandfather and his grandmother hard to
[55:05] believe that I'm looking at that many
[55:08] years that I was raised with his
[55:11] grandfather and his grandmother a man
[55:14] and in fact that family and our family
[55:20] were very close in fact it was the
[55:23] family that every year when the school
[55:27] closed for the summer holidays and
[55:30] vacation and to break that that family
[55:34] and our family would go to a place
[55:36] called Traverse Brook and there we would
[55:41] set up tents and they were military
[55:43] tents not just regular tents but they
[55:47] were military tents which meant they
[55:48] were very large and that family put
[55:52] their tent there and our family hadn't
[55:55] had right next to it a man and we we all
[55:58] lived together we all enjoyed his
[56:01] fellowship together amen and it was it
[56:04] was right next to the water as well and
[56:07] we all would all would eat at the same
[56:09] picnic tables and so on and so the
[56:15] grandfather that young man was one of
[56:18] one of that members of the other family
[56:20] he's just maybe two or three years older
[56:22] than I am but no doubt it is sad for
[56:25] them to have lost the way they lost him
[56:28] the loss there to lose their grandson in
[56:31] the last few days so the grace of God we
[56:34] pray and I wasn't aware of exactly what
[56:38] had happened until yesterday when we had
[56:41] fellowship
[56:42] myself sister Betty was asked over to
[56:44] her brother my brother Aaron in paradise
[56:47] and because there was a friend a man
[56:52] there was a friend that again
[56:55] we were neighbors when we lived in
[56:57] gamble and I haven't seen her I guess in
[57:01] almost 60 years but she came into the
[57:05] city and she wanted to meet with our
[57:08] family here again and of course she's a
[57:11] lady that did help my mother she's just
[57:15] like I said two or three years or three
[57:17] or four years no three or four years
[57:18] older than I am and so on so we had a
[57:21] time of fellowship but she did inform
[57:23] you as to the passing of that gentle
[57:25] that young man
[57:27] so the grace of God be with the family
[57:30] and the grace of God be with again our
[57:34] the friend that we met with and we we
[57:38] just know her as class and her name was
[57:41] class abbot and of course is she she's
[57:45] been married for over 60 years or no you
[57:49] know quite young no no over 50 years and
[57:53] believe it or not and I was shocked when
[57:57] I learned that they are now living in
[58:00] Deer Lake and they knew brother Claude
[58:05] Gail yeah
[58:07] so it oh yes they we know him yeah we've
[58:09] met him in different places amen I said
[58:12] good as I said just not long ago I said
[58:15] I had to do his funeral and and they
[58:18] remembered those things amen that oh yes
[58:22] he was in the home and seniors almond
[58:25] ear like as a yes he was you know so we
[58:28] pray the grace of God to class and her
[58:30] husband and her family a man so grace to
[58:34] us all brother well this is serious when
[58:37] it words they're not just get we're
[58:38] getting old but I'll tell you this the
[58:40] world is old the world is getting old
[58:43] and brother while the world needs the
[58:46] world don't recognize well we need I
[58:48] trust we do recognize and what we need
[58:51] as the right of Christ not not all
[58:53] believers recognized
[58:55] the need but we're going to highlight it
[58:57] within the neck I guess today and then
[59:00] hopefully it'll not hopefully but I
[59:03] assume it's gonna take a number of
[59:04] services to to get the full revelation
[59:07] of it of what we need and brothers
[59:10] sister and without it we're lost and oh
[59:14] well well that's where we might say well
[59:18] that that's that's Jesus or that's
[59:20] Calvary or that's this that's that no oh
[59:22] no what produced Jesus what produced
[59:26] Calvary what produced the revelation of
[59:29] the word brother it's the grace of God a
[59:32] man so any gonna be on that it is divine
[59:37] love but God is divine love a man but
[59:41] divine law projected grace a man so we
[59:46] want to get into though some of thoughts
[59:47] on grace a man grace in the beginning
[59:51] grace in the end knowing that you can go
[59:53] back to eternity and find the grace of
[59:55] God amen because there's a if it's in
[59:59] time it was in the mind of God in
[1:00:01] eternity our names are on the Lamb's
[1:00:04] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:00:06] the world a man so that was grace a man
[1:00:10] as the public of God said God when in
[1:00:12] the Garden of Eden he said I could have
[1:00:14] just waked the whole thing off again
[1:00:16] started again he did it before he could
[1:00:19] do it again you know but the second time
[1:00:22] he didn't do it we maybe we would feel
[1:00:24] well God the three is perfection so God
[1:00:27] would wipe it off and start again with
[1:00:28] the third no no so he could reveal what
[1:00:31] he want to reveal in another creation no
[1:00:36] in in the time of Adam and Eve
[1:00:38] that's when divine love projected grace
[1:00:41] a man so god help us that will recognize
[1:00:45] if there's anything we absolutely need
[1:00:48] it is the revelation of brace a man
[1:00:53] regardless of the age in which we live
[1:00:55] we go right back to the beginning is
[1:00:57] Grace and we're gonna think about Abel
[1:01:00] we're gonna think about Enoch is Grace
[1:01:03] well the Marigny is grace a man
[1:01:07] so we need the same thing amen
[1:01:10] in Zechariah chapter 4 and verse 1 and
[1:01:17] the angel that talked with me came again
[1:01:20] and waked me as a man that is wakened
[1:01:26] out of his sleep and said unto me what
[1:01:30] seest thou and I said I have looked and
[1:01:34] behold a candlestick all of gold with a
[1:01:38] bowl upon the top of it and is seven
[1:01:42] lamps there on a man coming right on
[1:01:46] down into the church ages he said which
[1:01:50] are upon the top thereof and two olive
[1:01:54] trees a man now we're getting go back to
[1:01:58] the Jews and two olive trees by it and
[1:02:02] those two olive trees representing the
[1:02:06] two messengers to Israel a man and to
[1:02:11] olive trees by it one upon the right
[1:02:13] side of the bowl and the other upon the
[1:02:15] left side of the bowl and so I answered
[1:02:18] and spake to the angel that talked with
[1:02:20] me saying what are these my lord then
[1:02:25] the angel that talked with me answered
[1:02:27] and said unto me knowest thou not what
[1:02:31] these me and I said no my lord then he
[1:02:36] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:02:38] is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel
[1:02:41] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:02:46] my spirit saith the Lord of oats
[1:02:49] alleluia who art thou o great mountain
[1:02:54] before survivable thou shall become a
[1:02:58] plane and he shall bring forth the
[1:03:00] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[1:03:04] grace grace unto it a man acknowledging
[1:03:10] that in all circumstances in all
[1:03:12] situations it is the grace of God so he
[1:03:16] said
[1:03:17] who are that oh great mountain before
[1:03:20] zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and
[1:03:23] he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:03:24] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[1:03:28] grace unto it and verse 14 said then
[1:03:32] said he these are the two anointed ones
[1:03:35] that stand by the Lord of the whole
[1:03:38] earth a man and there's a reference to
[1:03:41] revelation 11 and the gospel going back
[1:03:44] to the Jews and the two messengers god
[1:03:47] bless you may be seated there was a
[1:03:52] thought that was coming to me some time
[1:03:57] ago that I have not expressed but just
[1:03:59] express it
[1:04:00] concerning the Ministry of the word to
[1:04:03] the bride and what is the significance
[1:04:07] of it and what is the purpose of it that
[1:04:11] God is not just leaving us with just
[1:04:13] tapes of a prophet God is not just
[1:04:16] leaving us with the books of a prophet
[1:04:19] remember this puts us back into the
[1:04:21] world a man by the grace of God it it
[1:04:25] turns our hearts back by the grace of
[1:04:27] God but what is the purpose behind what
[1:04:31] God has done and behind what God is
[1:04:33] doing we know that it is Grace we know
[1:04:36] that it is unmerited favor we know that
[1:04:39] we don't deserve it because of the
[1:04:41] nature that we were born with and the
[1:04:44] nature of the flesh because as David
[1:04:47] confessed he said we're all born in sin
[1:04:49] and shaped an iniquity a man and he was
[1:04:54] asking God for grace he was
[1:04:57] acknowledging his sin he was
[1:04:58] acknowledging his nature but he's the
[1:05:01] Lord that's the way that I was born and
[1:05:03] going right back of course to the
[1:05:05] original sin so it is the grace of god
[1:05:09] but God dealt with David ganda with the
[1:05:13] others God wrote referenced David and he
[1:05:17] Fanny and he certainly gave grace to
[1:05:19] David a man because of David's attitude
[1:05:22] David was humble gave it recognized his
[1:05:26] need of it a man the grace of God he
[1:05:29] didn't hate it
[1:05:31] puffs himself up no no he elevated God
[1:05:34] to God be the glory
[1:05:35] so in the preaching and teaching of the
[1:05:38] word what is it that we as individuals
[1:05:41] are looking for are we looking just for
[1:05:44] teaching are we looking just for more
[1:05:46] information and that we will we'll know
[1:05:49] we'll learn more and more about the
[1:05:50] message or are we looking for
[1:05:53] instructions in righteousness are we
[1:05:56] looking for God to teachers what we need
[1:05:59] to be taught I mean looking for God to
[1:06:02] word through the preaching of the word
[1:06:03] to work on us in a very personal way a
[1:06:07] man not just appreciate in an impersonal
[1:06:10] but to preach it in a personal way
[1:06:13] because why because it's in the
[1:06:17] redemption is in the word the grace of
[1:06:20] God is in the word amen and what is God
[1:06:24] desiring to accomplish it is to perfect
[1:06:27] us it is to bring us more and more and
[1:06:30] more in line with the righteousness of
[1:06:32] our Lord Jesus Christ more and more in
[1:06:34] line to where to where we are we are
[1:06:36] going to die to ourselves and become
[1:06:38] alive to him a man so we're looking for
[1:06:42] God to minister the word to line us up
[1:06:44] with the word we're looking for God to
[1:06:46] minister to us through his word in a
[1:06:48] very personal way Lord and that he's
[1:06:51] going to get down and get personal with
[1:06:53] you get personal with me yes he got
[1:06:55] personal with you with I believe he got
[1:06:57] personal with Enoch he got personal with
[1:06:59] that of a need he got personal with Abel
[1:07:02] he got NES he even got personal with it
[1:07:04] with it with Cain a man and and Adam and
[1:07:08] Noah prayed by the grace of Almighty God
[1:07:11] so we've got to understand that we've
[1:07:14] got a hunger and we will if we aware the
[1:07:16] seat of God we're gonna honor and thirst
[1:07:18] for God to get personal with us and tell
[1:07:21] us this correct us air instruct us there
[1:07:24] what is it you want me to do how is that
[1:07:26] you want me to think how's that you want
[1:07:28] me to talk what do you want me to say
[1:07:29] where do you want me to go Lord what is
[1:07:31] your will it is not my real father line
[1:07:34] me down a man we could there's going to
[1:07:37] be there those there are missing the
[1:07:40] rapture missing the resurrect
[1:07:41] renessa were in that day they're gonna
[1:07:44] be there and they're gonna have a
[1:07:45] knowledge of the word of God and
[1:07:47] knowledge of the message and knowledge
[1:07:49] of this revelation that revelation but
[1:07:52] because he never applied it in a
[1:07:53] personal way
[1:07:54] amen and acknowledging the grace of God
[1:07:57] in at all and home of themselves they're
[1:07:59] not going to make it a man again not
[1:08:04] what they did but what they didn't do
[1:08:05] they failed to acknowledge grace they
[1:08:08] failed to apply grace a man they fail
[1:08:11] due to what for grace in action in their
[1:08:13] heart and in their souls and when his
[1:08:15] grace new grace humbles us amen grace
[1:08:19] brings us down and God brings us up a
[1:08:22] man when acknowledging the grace of God
[1:08:25] I'm a sinner saved by grace and so on it
[1:08:28] is by grace through faith that we are
[1:08:30] saying amen let's not just focus on the
[1:08:34] faith which is the revelation of the
[1:08:36] word but we got to focus on the grace
[1:08:38] and let's be thankful for the grace
[1:08:40] because without the grace there we would
[1:08:43] not have the faith as we ought to have
[1:08:45] it amen
[1:08:47] it would not be to us what it ought to
[1:08:49] be to us and that is eternal life amen
[1:08:52] praise the name of the Lord so is our
[1:08:55] faith that we have and all the things
[1:08:58] that we know and understand it is in my
[1:09:01] lighting grace is the magnifying grace
[1:09:04] in your heart and in your soul a man
[1:09:07] because as they were they're going to be
[1:09:09] there and they know this they know this
[1:09:11] they know that but they're not
[1:09:13] acknowledging grace a man they're not
[1:09:16] acknowledging the the love of God and
[1:09:18] the mercy of God toward them that I am
[1:09:20] and I am by the grace of God a man
[1:09:23] brother sister that I believe what I
[1:09:26] believe by the grace of God that I see
[1:09:29] what I see by the grace of God a man and
[1:09:32] again we want what is Grace it is the
[1:09:35] unmerited favor of God we don't deserve
[1:09:38] it
[1:09:39] amen because of our nature that we have
[1:09:42] in our flesh because of how we come into
[1:09:44] the world and sometimes it's because of
[1:09:46] what we're focusing on and not what God
[1:09:49] pleases God but what pleases us and what
[1:09:52] pleases the devil so remember that's
[1:09:54] what that's what
[1:09:55] you got to be careful of when it comes
[1:09:57] to our our walk with God when it comes
[1:10:01] to professing to believe when it comes
[1:10:03] to believing the older that I have the
[1:10:05] right faith and but is it the faith that
[1:10:08] pleases God a man or is it a faith that
[1:10:11] pleases us a man is it is it in my favor
[1:10:16] naturally is that in my favor in
[1:10:18] everyday living or as air is that in my
[1:10:21] favor eternally a man remember that
[1:10:24] after the devil finished with Adam and
[1:10:27] Eve they saw that it was good for food
[1:10:29] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:10:32] desired to make one wise a man this is
[1:10:35] absolutely amazing than they oh yeah
[1:10:38] when they listen to the devil this is
[1:10:41] what II revealed to them this is how
[1:10:44] that II gave them the false
[1:10:47] interpretation of the word and he only
[1:10:50] added a word may you take away a word
[1:10:53] you add a word any man and and and then
[1:10:56] individuals can walk away with the same
[1:10:59] revelation that Eve walked away with a
[1:11:01] man president says when the woman saw
[1:11:04] that the tree was good for food pleasant
[1:11:07] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:11:10] make one wise so we need the food and
[1:11:14] well yeah we need a more pleasant
[1:11:16] attitude and so on and oh yeah and we
[1:11:19] need wisdom but brothers you've got to
[1:11:22] get it from God by grace and not from
[1:11:24] the devil amen he'll make you make you
[1:11:27] believe that what he's giving you oh
[1:11:28] yeah you're gonna be as God's a man well
[1:11:33] brother you gotta say with the truth the
[1:11:34] whole truth nothing but the truth
[1:11:36] amen and acknowledging the acknowledging
[1:11:39] the grace of God behind it
[1:11:41] acknowledging the love of God that has
[1:11:43] projected it amen amen love love coming
[1:11:46] down with grace a man Oh Lord we don't
[1:11:49] deserve it all brother you went at him
[1:11:52] and he went into the garden and into the
[1:11:54] trees and hid themselves knowing knowing
[1:11:58] that they they had transgressed of the
[1:12:00] word knowing that they had ignored God
[1:12:02] knowing that they I turned their back on
[1:12:04] God a man press the truth because they
[1:12:07] were deceived by the enemy
[1:12:08] and they believed that they were going
[1:12:10] to be as gods but brother I truly went
[1:12:13] with when they got it and it all came to
[1:12:15] pass a man and they were experiencing
[1:12:17] the results of what they did they
[1:12:19] realized they were not like God amen
[1:12:22] brother and sister and in the light of
[1:12:24] all that's going on in the world today
[1:12:26] brother than anything we're going to
[1:12:28] just go along with this and go along
[1:12:30] with that and and all just have an
[1:12:32] intellectual knowledge of the word the
[1:12:34] mechanics but not the dynamics all
[1:12:36] brothers sister one of these days
[1:12:38] they're going to hide themselves a man
[1:12:41] among the trees of the garden amen
[1:12:43] because they miss the rapture because
[1:12:45] they missed the resurrection so brother
[1:12:48] we got to take the word in a very
[1:12:49] personal way according to the will of
[1:12:52] God is that accomplishing us what God
[1:12:55] wants it to accomplish
[1:12:56] Amen is that giving us a faith that God
[1:12:59] wants us to have a man now he gave a
[1:13:02] gave Adam and Eve faith here as I said
[1:13:05] good for food pleasant to the eyes good
[1:13:07] to be desired to make one wise but again
[1:13:10] it's gotta it's got to be the food that
[1:13:11] God wants us to have and it's got it's
[1:13:14] got to be the pleasant as there like the
[1:13:17] people to read the piece of the word the
[1:13:19] rest of the word and so on and the
[1:13:22] source of the word eternal life amen by
[1:13:25] the grace of God not natural but eternal
[1:13:27] and desired to make one wise having the
[1:13:30] wisdom of God and if you got wisdom get
[1:13:33] understanding
[1:13:34] a man so they got wisdom but they never
[1:13:37] gonna know you I was too late it was too
[1:13:40] late when they got understanding that's
[1:13:41] why they hid themselves among the trees
[1:13:43] of the garden and it is too late when to
[1:13:46] win a lot of believers are good at we
[1:13:47] get understanding and they're going to
[1:13:49] end up in the Great Tribulation looking
[1:13:51] for the rapture
[1:13:52] amen but it already and it already
[1:13:55] happened and passed and they didn't know
[1:13:57] it so brother sister let's not be hungry
[1:14:00] and thirsting for just teaching of the
[1:14:02] word teaching of the word I want to
[1:14:04] learn this I want to learn that but we
[1:14:06] want the word to have that God's desire
[1:14:08] affecting our lives and that is to
[1:14:11] Humble us because they that are humbled
[1:14:13] will be exalted amen there you put
[1:14:16] yourself down God's going to take you
[1:14:17] out by the grace of God amen
[1:14:21] we need the teaching of the word but at
[1:14:23] the same time he should magnify grace
[1:14:25] amen if we're gonna receive it in the
[1:14:29] right way recognize that as being of God
[1:14:31] it's going to Humble us Oh Lord Lord my
[1:14:35] lord it's your grace that I can see that
[1:14:38] it's your grace that I understand that
[1:14:40] if your grace that O Lord I pray that
[1:14:43] you have given it I pray Lord it's going
[1:14:45] to accomplish in me what you wanted to
[1:14:47] accomplish
[1:14:48] amen pray the grace of Almighty God it's
[1:14:51] one thing the new and again it's one
[1:14:53] thing to know it another thing to
[1:14:55] believe it one thing to know it another
[1:14:56] thing to do it a man to believe it and
[1:14:59] do it and he may end the groats and
[1:15:01] walking the light as he is in the light
[1:15:04] amen as I said I just come in and sit in
[1:15:07] it
[1:15:07] but walk in it amen so it absolutely by
[1:15:11] the grave is Grace in your life and
[1:15:13] you're experiencing grace with it you
[1:15:15] acknowledge the grace with it you are
[1:15:17] humbling yourselves what's it going to
[1:15:19] do it's going to control your life amen
[1:15:21] it's going to govern your life amen you
[1:15:24] again you got to you're going to have
[1:15:26] that that nature that jesus said not my
[1:15:29] real father
[1:15:29] thank me done praise the name of the
[1:15:32] Lord there's a lot of preachers with
[1:15:34] brother Aeterna there so they had that a
[1:15:35] anointing that Jesus had and they had
[1:15:37] the gifts that Jesus had they certainly
[1:15:39] wouldn't preach like Jesus preached a
[1:15:41] man and brother and the prophet of God
[1:15:44] was facing the same thing in his
[1:15:45] ministry he got their attention under
[1:15:48] the first and the second pole and
[1:15:50] finally you know but he started to get
[1:15:52] into the word into the word and they NDB
[1:15:55] had to come - brother bouncers brother
[1:15:56] Brown stop preaching this stop preaching
[1:15:58] that why because he was Eva's getting
[1:16:01] more and more personal amen and anything
[1:16:04] he was challenging the people to get
[1:16:06] personal with the word believe us now
[1:16:08] this amen as Jesus did with Martha saw
[1:16:13] the prophet of God it was God in him
[1:16:15] doing well it was God when Luther a God
[1:16:17] with Wesley God with the Pentecostals
[1:16:19] and others that God was using it was it
[1:16:22] had become personal with God amen and
[1:16:25] that's why revelry has way Luther got
[1:16:27] the revelation that he got he headed
[1:16:28] into that personal relationship with our
[1:16:31] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:33] get the resurrection and rapture we
[1:16:35] gotta enter into that personal
[1:16:37] relationship with Jesus a man by the
[1:16:40] grace of almighty god and the prophet of
[1:16:42] god went through with this sign of that
[1:16:44] sign got their attention and they're all
[1:16:46] coming to well just to see the gifts but
[1:16:50] they wanted healing they wanted signs
[1:16:51] and wonders and so on but but I got to
[1:16:54] the place where the probably begin to
[1:16:56] put a little emphasis here on the word
[1:16:58] little emphasis there on the word it was
[1:17:00] the grace of God a man what for now it
[1:17:03] wasn't just for their healing it was for
[1:17:05] their salvation
[1:17:06] Amen it is by grace through faith we are
[1:17:09] saved and there are some ourselves it is
[1:17:12] the gift of God a man they wanted they
[1:17:15] wanted the faith for the healing of
[1:17:16] their bodies but they didn't want the
[1:17:18] faith for the change of the body then he
[1:17:20] was a faith for this day in this hour of
[1:17:22] the resurrection and the rapture a man
[1:17:25] no no and and even those that well-known
[1:17:29] evangelist went over to the apartment of
[1:17:31] God and brother Branham and he said
[1:17:34] brother Branham he said you've got to
[1:17:36] stop preaching those things he said
[1:17:38] because the people are going to turn
[1:17:40] your turn away from you and in the power
[1:17:42] of God's the will he said brother who's
[1:17:45] going to preach it and he said we'll
[1:17:47] leave it to the pastor's well he said if
[1:17:48] they're not doing and he said somebody's
[1:17:50] got to do it
[1:17:51] a man so everybody so he kept on
[1:17:54] preaching it what for even he was
[1:17:56] bringing it into a new closer
[1:17:59] relationship with God he was he was
[1:18:02] trying to bring the believer any man get
[1:18:04] the attention of the believers to
[1:18:05] believe a man and I just believe in
[1:18:08] signs and wonders anybody
[1:18:10] he said go forth he shouldn't do this
[1:18:12] and do this and get the people to
[1:18:14] believe and what was he to get him to
[1:18:16] believe the word and what word he was he
[1:18:19] to get him to believe when we know what
[1:18:21] he had again Luther I believe and Wesley
[1:18:23] in the Pentecostals what is he had to
[1:18:25] get us to believe a man why God did
[1:18:28] there in Logar he did it because he got
[1:18:31] Luther to believe he did got Wesley to
[1:18:33] believe he got the Pentecostals of any
[1:18:35] Amen but now he's endeavouring to get
[1:18:38] another
[1:18:39] another group to believe a may another
[1:18:41] part of the bride to believe a man in
[1:18:44] this bright age they believe that they
[1:18:47] believe this they believe they then
[1:18:48] something else and God bless them but
[1:18:51] now brother sister God a God is
[1:18:53] challenging this generation to believe
[1:18:55] the word the resurrection a trifling
[1:18:59] faith a man not 90 night of healing
[1:19:02] anymore no go beyond that a man and he
[1:19:06] was challenging them in a very personal
[1:19:07] way a man to a play the word in a very
[1:19:11] personal way to their lives are you
[1:19:14] right with God do you wear the faith
[1:19:15] that pleases God not just for healing
[1:19:18] but for the change of the body by the
[1:19:20] grace of Almighty God ain't man
[1:19:22] the powder God said we a in 1953 I've
[1:19:25] said it before let me say it again he
[1:19:27] said listen he said we had I believe it
[1:19:31] was so many years of divine seven years
[1:19:35] of divine healing he said a memorial of
[1:19:38] divine healing and memorial what is a
[1:19:41] memorial you sort of a memorial for
[1:19:44] something that is past a man and he says
[1:19:47] that have been a memorial of divine
[1:19:49] Eenie and it was in 1953 that he said he
[1:19:52] begin to move from the signs and the
[1:19:53] wonders and begin to put more and more
[1:19:56] and more emphasis on the word amen to
[1:19:59] bring the people into a personal
[1:20:01] relationship with the word Amen brother
[1:20:05] it's got to be a personal relationship
[1:20:07] out of the heart with the Word of God
[1:20:09] that gives us the faith that pleases God
[1:20:12] a man because you can you can be healed
[1:20:15] and go to hell you're going to
[1:20:16] experience God in your flesh and go to
[1:20:18] hell ain't man but a you've got to have
[1:20:21] it you've got to get it in your soul
[1:20:22] it's got to be very personal in your
[1:20:24] soul and brother turn any revelation
[1:20:27] they may in the foundation thereof in
[1:20:30] our in our hearts and in our souls in
[1:20:32] what we believe in our faith if there's
[1:20:35] any foundation on which everything else
[1:20:37] is built it is the grace of God amen and
[1:20:40] it is a grace with that as the
[1:20:42] attributes of divine love a man and
[1:20:45] because why again as I said in a in
[1:20:48] Ephesians there where they say always my
[1:20:50] grace were saved by grace
[1:20:52] by grace no we're not we are saved by
[1:20:54] grace through faith let's take the whole
[1:20:58] truth and nothing by the truth amen
[1:21:01] don't leave this said only that nobody I
[1:21:03] believe in Satan that it that is
[1:21:05] preached Lanting he got among the
[1:21:07] churches he got among the evangelists he
[1:21:09] got among the preachers and they said oh
[1:21:11] that you're saved by grace you're saved
[1:21:13] by grace
[1:21:14] why because they weren't putting the
[1:21:16] emphasis on faith what God was doing in
[1:21:19] what God has done and what God was
[1:21:22] revealing oh they are they all pointed
[1:21:24] back to to Calvary that's right they
[1:21:26] pointed back to Calvary but that was God
[1:21:29] revealing himself in flesh you know he
[1:21:32] promised it right back there in the
[1:21:34] Garden of Eden he fulfilled it in the
[1:21:36] Alpha Ministry of Jesus but Jesus made
[1:21:38] other promises that he was going to
[1:21:40] fulfill in the in the Omega ministry in
[1:21:42] the last days the resurrection and the
[1:21:44] rapture a man what he was doing in the
[1:21:47] Old Testament through this province
[1:21:49] through this ministry in that ministry
[1:21:51] was pointing into the Messiah now
[1:21:53] through this for the church is plenty of
[1:21:57] us is plenty of - in Messiah Hall right
[1:21:59] a man but he's putting us - our Lord and
[1:22:02] our Savior the resurrection and the
[1:22:03] rapture because a man see this is why
[1:22:07] when he was getting close to the end of
[1:22:09] that doubtful ministry that's why he
[1:22:11] highlighted these things to Martha there
[1:22:14] concerning the resurrection and the
[1:22:16] rapture ain't man brother said anyway
[1:22:19] what believe us now this brother they
[1:22:23] think they were experiencing the grace
[1:22:24] of God in having fellowship with the
[1:22:27] Messiah 2,000 years ago but now there
[1:22:30] was that Messiah was going to do other
[1:22:32] things and it was going to be a
[1:22:34] challenge to our faith
[1:22:35] amen by the grace of God believe us now
[1:22:37] this a man that was not not just the
[1:22:41] whole I'm the Messiah and I do this and
[1:22:43] I do that and I do that but do you
[1:22:45] believe that I am the resurrection hey
[1:22:48] man hallelujah because they were moving
[1:22:51] from the revelation of just Messiah they
[1:22:53] were getting to go to get deeper into it
[1:22:55] by the grace of God to recognize the
[1:22:57] Messiah and yes he was our Redeemer he's
[1:23:00] our Savior but now
[1:23:02] amen hallelujah he would lay shed his
[1:23:06] blood lay his life down pick it up again
[1:23:08] amen he's our Redeemer a man but now do
[1:23:12] you believe he's our resurrection and
[1:23:14] her rapture because it's not just a
[1:23:16] redeemer is to resurrect us and rapture
[1:23:18] us and change us and take us back where
[1:23:20] we come from hey man
[1:23:23] Gaga was giving them the faith to
[1:23:25] believe the Messiah the Messiah to
[1:23:27] redeem a man redemption redemption
[1:23:30] praise the name of the Lord it was all
[1:23:33] future tense but now it is past tense
[1:23:36] and it is in the present tense do you
[1:23:39] believe that I am that I will be the
[1:23:41] resurrection I am the resurrection a man
[1:23:44] praise the name of the Lord as I was
[1:23:47] bringing up with after brother Marc

[1:24:17] light and before Abraham was I am
[1:24:20] and not only that winning when he got to
[1:24:22] the place where he was getting ready to
[1:24:24] leave the world like you and I what did
[1:24:26] he talk over hallelujah what a faith
[1:24:28] that he had Amen what revelation he had
[1:24:31] when he said in John John 17 he said I
[1:24:34] am he said no more in the world what I'm
[1:24:40] sure that he never never understood it
[1:24:42] but he said no more in the world what do
[1:24:44] you mean here they II was standing there
[1:24:45] is this able arm is this I was hurtin
[1:24:48] you're not I will be no more in the
[1:24:52] world he said I am no more in the world
[1:24:53] that was his faith a man that was the
[1:24:57] revelation of the word than he was that
[1:24:59] even that he was becoming one with that
[1:25:01] revelation a man that he was going to
[1:25:04] shed his blood and lay his life down he
[1:25:06] was going to do this do this and pick up

[1:33:28] taken away a lot he's taken away a lot
[1:33:31] from a lot of believers amen
[1:33:33] because they're not do not like to used
[1:33:34] to be no way the prophet of God was
[1:33:37] acknowledging it himself regarded
[1:33:40] regarding grace and God he got at the
[1:33:42] faith and and they weren't they weren't
[1:33:44] into the word like the you it were were
[1:33:45] a man even bound time and echo you know
[1:33:49] he was recognizing that they were they
[1:33:51] were getting cold and just saying after
[1:33:54] he preached church order just a soldier
[1:33:56] after he plays charge shorter there was
[1:33:58] a lot left
[1:33:59] BAM Tabernacle so did they recognize a
[1:34:04] prophet did they recognize the grace of
[1:34:07] God in the going for
[1:34:08] the word that no that you'd see that
[1:34:10] they wouldn't take that any man see it
[1:34:13] was all intellectual but it wasn't
[1:34:14] personal a may they never took it in a
[1:34:19] very personal way they never applied it
[1:34:21] to their own Arts in their own soul that
[1:34:23] ever applied it to their own age and
[1:34:25] sale or does that mean forgive me Amen
[1:34:29] Lord I'll follow your leadership I won't
[1:34:32] say anything unless I'm absolutely sure
[1:34:33] that it's the Holy Ghost in my soul it's
[1:34:36] not my aim at night mind my emotions and
[1:34:39] so on and again and we know why he
[1:34:42] preached church order it because there
[1:34:44] was a boss and anyone's there and as our
[1:34:47] brother Neville when he winning when he
[1:34:48] took brother Manuel and sister man you
[1:34:50] had to suffer in jeffersonville way back
[1:34:52] many many many years ago and he said to
[1:34:55] brother Manuel he said brother Manuel II
[1:34:56] said do you know why the prophet of God
[1:34:59] preached search order and the probably
[1:35:02] well the brother Manuel thought wow no I
[1:35:05] don't know exactly why I just assumed he
[1:35:08] said he just wanted to set everything in
[1:35:09] order he said that bad because the
[1:35:12] certain of the brothers and sisters
[1:35:13] weren't doing it you know exactly where
[1:35:15] God wanted done
[1:35:16] he said no brother he said lot of a lot
[1:35:20] of what was going on in Brown Tabernacle
[1:35:22] he said before this before he came to
[1:35:24] the pull of the preach he said with
[1:35:25] false anointed ones amen and he said
[1:35:29] that's why the Father God said when I

[1:35:33] now he says you got to meet before the
[1:35:35] service starts he said meet there in the
[1:35:37] room and he said if there's a gift let
[1:35:39] God give it and he said let there be
[1:35:41] other brothers here to judge it and if
[1:35:43] they feel it's the Lord he said they can
[1:35:45] write it down and bring it to the pulpit
[1:35:47] and we'll read it amen
[1:35:49] that's what the public got said and I
[1:35:51] rather never did expound it - herb - -
[1:35:54] brother Manuel that it was because of
[1:35:56] the false anointing in Brown Tabernacle
[1:35:58] a man and went in and he said don't do
[1:36:01] this
[1:36:01] you know because oh my Manny and he
[1:36:04] stopped the testimony meetings and I
[1:36:06] knew that and I even told him in in in
[1:36:09] central are you gonna stop this I said
[1:36:12] the prophet of God stop is you're going
[1:36:13] to stop it because they tell you they
[1:36:15] had they had long song services and they
[1:36:17] and they had testimony means as I said
[1:36:20] brothers were to get up there to testify
[1:36:22] and instead of testifying they preached
[1:36:24] that is the truth eyewitness said I
[1:36:27] snorted this and this shouldn't be and
[1:36:29] so on and I was just a young man and I
[1:36:32] went to the bathroom you're gonna stop
[1:36:34] that and eventually they did stop it

[1:36:38] Benham tyrannical and and then they
[1:36:40] stopped the the manifestation of the
[1:36:42] gifts of the Spirit tongues and
[1:36:44] interpretation and Brava see they they
[1:36:46] stop that inbound Tabernacle hey man
[1:36:48] why because there was too many false
[1:36:50] anointed ones Amen God was my grace
[1:36:53] coming out to minister the word through

[1:36:59] evidence went from Sonny's and wonders
[1:37:00] to grace they ever going from the gifts
[1:37:05] to the revelation of the word by grace a
[1:37:08] man that's what it was to put the
[1:37:12] emphasis on the word and to apply the
[1:37:13] word in a personal way a man but how

[1:42:47] resurrection and the spirit of the
[1:42:48] Raptors our rivers Lord we need it in

[1:43:03] world in Jesus day but you know what you
[1:43:05] know what I've set Jesus a lot o it was
[1:43:11] thus in this scene that's in yeah but
[1:43:17] what really upset Jesus and he
[1:43:20] questioned at a number of times was the
[1:43:22] lack of faith and that's the lack of
[1:43:27] grace acknowledged in their lives
[1:43:30] he saw ye of little faith where's your
[1:43:35] faith where's your faith where's your
[1:43:36] faith he rebuked them for a lack of
[1:43:38] faith he forgive them for a lack of
[1:43:40] faith and that's that's what that's what
[1:43:43] caused Jesus to grieve and the mourn he
[1:43:46] wanted to get out he get out and he'll
[1:43:49] do this you'll do that and he come back
[1:43:51] everybody with the anointing and he
[1:43:53] would give them faith grace through
[1:43:55] faith hey man oh yeah constantly oh why
[1:44:00] couldn't your decide was it is because
[1:44:01] of lack of faith where's your faith

[1:44:06] woman that touch the board of His
[1:44:07] garment

[1:53:28] the message of grace was preached in
[1:53:31] 1961 in Jeffersonville we'll get to it
[1:53:38] maybe in another service but I want to
[1:53:42] share these thoughts with you this was
[1:53:46] in the message desperation if you apply
[1:53:50] the message as we were ministering on
[1:53:53] convinced and concerned if you are
[1:53:56] personally convinced you are personally
[1:53:58] concerned but not wouldn't the natural
[1:54:01] things of life but with the spiritual
[1:54:03] with what God is doing hey man that's
[1:54:07] what Joel Joel was was persuaded up he
[1:54:12] said the Lord giveth the Lord taketh
[1:54:14] away
[1:54:14] blessed be the name of the Lord but he
[1:54:18] still wanted to understand why God
[1:54:20] permitted what he permitted why God
[1:54:23] allowed what he allowed why God was to
[1:54:26] let the devil do this but the devil do
[1:54:28] that amen
[1:54:30] Joel better revelation that there was a
[1:54:32] divine purpose and reason behind it do
[1:54:35] we have that revelation all we think
[1:54:38] well if it's God we don't have to worry
[1:54:40] with this we don't have to worry about
[1:54:41] that listen oh my god did with Joel in a
[1:54:43] very personal way God dealt with the
[1:54:46] prophets in a very personal way God
[1:54:48] dealt with it his apostles in a very
[1:54:50] personal way and all down through the
[1:54:53] ages very personal amen the grace of God
[1:55:00] amen who was it that I was referring to
[1:55:06] joke very personal see I pray God you
[1:55:12] recognize that no don't don't just go
[1:55:15] back and read it as a history book no no
[1:55:18] read it as as God's God talking to you
[1:55:22] God showing you this God showing you
[1:55:24] that and and Joel's wife all she said
[1:55:27] that once you curse God and die go
[1:55:28] commit suicide
[1:55:33] it's because a foolish woman didn't say
[1:55:37] she was but she spoke like one amen no
[1:55:42] he wanted to he wanted to be God and God
[1:55:45] amen amen
[1:55:47] and God sent this comforter that
[1:55:49] comforter I preached on some years ago
[1:55:51] the four approaches to the message I
[1:55:55] preached on I believe might have been on
[1:55:57] Empire Avenue the four approaches to the
[1:55:59] message you know and it was this
[1:56:02] comforter that comforter another
[1:56:03] comforter three of them and then there
[1:56:06] was then there was the fourth that
[1:56:09] represented Jesus hallelujah
[1:56:13] well it wasn't the first one the second
[1:56:15] or the third it was the fourth that
[1:56:17] brought job into the prayer into the
[1:56:18] presence of God amen a man and and God
[1:56:25] dealt with Joel in a very personal way
[1:56:27] and he was dealing with his faith
[1:56:30] others were dealing with job's works but
[1:56:37] God was dealing with jobs paid a man he
[1:56:42] was challenging Joel's faith job was
[1:56:45] getting personal with Joe God's getting
[1:56:47] personal with you a man as the Bride of
[1:56:50] Christ are you personal with God amen so
[1:56:57] Joe and after after that job's got quiet
[1:57:02] praise the Lord
[1:57:03] you've got to do anything you you saw
[1:57:08] that your mouth yeah
[1:57:12] North oh there goes me but for the grace
[1:57:15] of God like drug the angel
[1:57:18] silence brother branham when he was
[1:57:20] condemning that woman and so on and you
[1:57:23] come here and he showed brother Bram his
[1:57:26] own sin that's right
[1:57:29] praise the Lord and the father of God is
[1:57:33] added to change toward that other person
[1:57:35] I've got our attitude when we recognize
[1:57:40] we're saved by grace God and God like
[1:57:43] God was revealing the Joel amen Joel
[1:57:45] this
[1:57:46] where were you where were you where were
[1:57:48] you when I did this where were you when
[1:57:50] I did that Joubert recognized them
[1:57:53] indeed that he was a sinner saved by
[1:57:56] grace
[1:57:56] anybody that what he knew he knew only
[1:57:59] by the grace of God a man and when and
[1:58:02] when when they all the others went to
[1:58:04] offer their sacrifices to God God went
[1:58:07] and told him he said go get Joel to pray
[1:58:08] for you
[1:58:09] a man got Joel bet humbled himself God's
[1:58:14] grace to us I'll tell you really if if
[1:58:18] just if there's any attribute of the
[1:58:20] bride in this last hour is humility why
[1:58:23] because she got the revelation of grace
[1:58:29] grace unmerited favor humbles you when
[1:58:36] you got the understanding of it in
[1:58:51] he referred to Jesus and this message
[1:58:53] right here desperation he said Jesus
[1:58:55] went a little further and he said if
[1:59:02] Jesus went a little further he said how
[1:59:06] much more ought we to go a little
[1:59:09] further amen
[1:59:12] when we recognize the are we living do
[1:59:15] we really believe in the rapture god
[1:59:21] help us yeah
[1:59:26] how much more on we tickle a little
[1:59:28] further and notice the scripture says
[1:59:31] here in Luke that he prayed earnestly
[1:59:33] brother sister if Jesus had to pray
[1:59:36] earnestly how much more have we got to
[1:59:39] pray earnestly amen
[1:59:42] and if Christ the God of heaven made
[1:59:46] flesh had to pray earnestly that how
[1:59:48] much more are we he says sinners saved
[1:59:51] by grace pray earnestly amen if the
[1:59:59] decision showed the son of God into
[2:00:01] despair he said what will it do to you
[2:00:04] and I
[2:00:05] he said desperately we must cry it's
[2:00:13] unfortunate that too many are lacking
[2:00:15] the revelation of grace amen
[2:00:20] too many are lacking the revelation of
[2:00:25] the atmosphere we're living in and the
[2:00:30] conditions that we're dealing with
[2:00:31] everything the weakness of the flesh if
[2:00:36] you recognize it
[2:00:37] you got the revelation of it you're
[2:00:39] gonna be desperate to get out of it amen

[2:01:16] mind that was in Christ being you so
[2:01:20] you're going to think like him not like
[2:01:22] the devil god help us he said God in
[2:01:27] these last days has manifested himself
[2:01:30] so to us by His great signs and power
[2:01:33] should make us desperate and he said
[2:01:36] that's right and is willing to heal us
[2:01:39] save us ought to throw sin to all in the
[2:01:42] desperation easier to get that healing

[2:05:45] I told him I was resurrected and I was
[2:05:48] raptured didn't respond don't got me

[2:05:59] quiet until I told him the patience I've
[2:06:05] been quickened resurrected spiritually
[2:06:08] in my soul and I said and I've been
[2:06:10] raptured up doing every place in Christ
[2:06:12] when they got it
[2:06:14] that changed changed the atmosphere and
[2:06:17] it got noisy a man a man God gave them
[2:06:22] the revelation god help us to get into a
[2:06:25] very personal relationship with the
[2:06:27] resurrection very personal with the
[2:06:30] rapture

[2:06:37] me now it's me now they were looking for
[2:06:41] the change in Jesus the resurrection in
[2:06:43] Jesus now Jesus is looking for the
[2:06:46] resurrection and rapture in the bright
[2:06:49] praise the Lord thank God brother I find
[2:06:55] such a lack of desperation
[2:06:58] everybody's desperate for the natural
[2:07:00] things of life but they're not desperate
[2:07:02] for the spiritual how many are really
[2:07:05] desperate for the resurrection and the
[2:07:07] rapture Jesus was desperate to get out
[2:07:11] of this world how many artists like him
[2:07:15] desperate to get out of this whole world
[2:07:17] why because he wants to judge it he's
[2:07:21] going to burn it with fire he's going to
[2:07:24] create a new heaven and new earth he's
[2:07:28] he's enduring it for 6,000 years and one
[2:07:31] day with the Lord as those thousand
[2:07:33] years a thousand years is one day a man
[2:07:35] now we're going into eternity by the
[2:07:38] grace of God
[2:07:42] people are desperate for the natural
[2:07:44] things of life but they're not desperate
[2:07:47] for the spiritual there are very very
[2:07:49] few that are desperate for the spiritual
[2:07:51] things of life I'll finish with a couple
[2:07:54] of quotes in the message how can I
[2:07:56] overcome
[2:07:59] he said overcome means to recognize the
[2:08:03] devil and every one of his tricks and he
[2:08:09] said lots of people say there is no
[2:08:11] devil it's just a thought
[2:08:13] don't you believe that there is a real
[2:08:15] devil and he's just as real as you are
[2:08:19] anybody he said a real devil and you
[2:08:23] must recognize him real you must know
[2:08:26] that he's a devil and he said then the
[2:08:31] same time you recognize him and know
[2:08:33] that is the devil and he is against you
[2:08:38] thought word indeed he's against you
[2:08:42] then he said to overcome you must
[2:08:46] recognize that God in you is greater and
[2:08:49] mightier than II is the one that is in
[2:08:54] you has already overcome the devil and
[2:08:57] it is by is grace you are more than a
[2:09:02] match for Satan amen he said there's
[2:09:06] there a real overcoming it is by grace I
[2:09:12] pray you got that grace in your life
[2:09:16] that you recognize Satan won't deceive
[2:09:19] you you you're gonna be more wiser than
[2:09:23] Satan that's right
[2:09:25] God's gonna reveal this to you and you
[2:09:28] got power over Satan amen grace brother
[2:09:33] that's grace if you really got grace in
[2:09:35] your life grace is there
[2:09:37] oh I'm redeemed Jesus died to save me
[2:09:40] and so on yeah he died to save you but
[2:09:41] he died to get in you he rose again to
[2:09:44] get in you amen
[2:09:47] he rose again to share is his
[2:09:49] resurrection with you and he rose again
[2:09:52] to share his rapture with you okay well
[2:09:56] what a rapture you mean tell me I'm
[2:10:00] raptured yes you are
[2:10:01] well what's the evidence the word has
[2:10:07] been revealed the prophet of God said
[2:10:10] what's going on in heavenly places in
[2:10:11] Christ he said the word is being
[2:10:13] revealed amen and it being revealed in
[2:10:19] your heart not your head
[2:10:22] he's to remember greater is He that is
[2:10:25] in you than he that is in the world that
[2:10:29] he's in you in your heart in your soul
[2:10:31] grace thank God just consider your life
[2:10:39] and that God is in you that Jesus is in
[2:10:42] you amen the resurrected Lord is healing
[2:10:46] and I knew you giving you the revelation
[2:10:49] of the resurrection the faith for
[2:10:51] resurrection of faith for the rapture
[2:10:53] the faith to get out of this world and
[2:10:56] with him wonderful he's the greater is
[2:11:01] He that is in you than he that is in the
[2:11:03] world he said you must recognize that
[2:11:05] the Holy Spirit that is in you has
[2:11:08] already overcome this thing and he is in
[2:11:12] you and you can overcome by him he said
[2:11:15] that's exactly sensible amen let's
[2:11:22] believe God hidden and revealed in
[2:11:23] simplicity it's very simple
[2:11:27] and and it's so simple God is asking us
[2:11:30] believe us though this it's not God
[2:11:33] doesn't make it complicated
[2:11:34] you got believers that are that they're
[2:11:36] taking the message and taking the word
[2:11:38] and taking this and they're making it
[2:11:40] complicated and Oh bigger that's a
[2:11:43] prophecy to make it bigger than what it
[2:11:44] is some make it smaller than what it is
[2:11:47] and but God is it in simplicity what got
[2:11:52] what he said he was going to do he's
[2:11:53] gonna do how he was gonna do it he's
[2:11:56] gonna do it it's simple I want I like
[2:12:00] some of us we know concerning certain of
[2:12:03] the Brethren over there who believe this
[2:12:04] and believe that and be something else
[2:12:06] yet profess to be believers but yet what
[2:12:09] are they doing they're taking the
[2:12:10] message and they're making this thought
[2:12:12] there and that thought there or the
[2:12:13] scripture or even the scripture and
[2:12:14] they're making it bigger than what it is
[2:12:16] and they're adding to it or they're
[2:12:18] taking away from it and making a smaller
[2:12:20] than what it is it's not scriptural
[2:12:23] because it's buries what God started and
[2:12:27] what God is going is doing and what God
[2:12:29] is going to do is simple it's very
[2:12:32] simple we understand it and it's going
[2:12:36] to end God is gonna do it by using us
[2:12:38] and working through us and it's well
[2:12:41] he's fulfilling his word people want to
[2:12:45] make it brother the mysteries have been
[2:12:48] have been revealed God has come down and
[2:12:51] he's been made simple what he's going to
[2:12:54] do but there are they're there their
[2:12:56] so-called ministries today online what
[2:12:59] are they doing they're complicating it
[2:13:01] and where the angel came down and broke
[2:13:03] the seals - they're putting the seals
[2:13:07] back together they are oh yeah what was
[2:13:13] revealed now they're doing it in such a
[2:13:16] way so as they're putting it and they're
[2:13:18] sealing it back again oh it's only for
[2:13:20] the right yeah no no Jesus was there
[2:13:24] they could see him they could hear him
[2:13:26] they could touch him he eat he would
[2:13:29] drink oh yeah Jesus did this Jesus said
[2:13:32] that but yeah they never recognized him
[2:13:36] as Messiah
[2:13:38] the accuser Mabini devil under the
[2:13:43] influence of the devil
[2:13:44] yeah this is absolutely amazing and but
[2:13:48] it was all simple it was right there and
[2:13:53] he spoke the word just plain right there
[2:13:56] he did he didn't make it more
[2:13:58] complicated
[2:13:58] he made it more simple and it way it was
[2:14:02] the simplicity of it they just couldn't
[2:14:04] accept a man because why because the
[2:14:08] Jews back then they were looking for a
[2:14:09] messiah well they didn't believe the
[2:14:11] Messiah was going to come and redeem
[2:14:13] them from their sins they were there
[2:14:14] looking for a messiah to come and redeem
[2:14:16] them from the control of the Roman
[2:14:18] nation but they needed a spiritual
[2:14:24] Redemption first and then God would take
[2:14:27] them not under control of the Roman
[2:14:29] nation you take them out of the world by
[2:14:31] grace so that you're no longer subject
[2:14:33] to natural you're subject to this the
[2:14:36] kingdom of God the king of kings and the
[2:14:39] Lord of lords so brother sister be on
[2:14:44] your guard
[2:14:45] don't get caught up with the foolishness
[2:14:50] of false teachings and false doctrines
[2:14:52] concerning the message of the hour
[2:14:55] because you see if I got it here that
[2:14:59] we're dealing with even in this hour
[2:15:01] we're dealing with with ministries all
[2:15:07] around the message we're dealing with
[2:15:09] false ministries around the messies
[2:15:10] program that they're they're preaching
[2:15:13] preaching perverted revelation of the
[2:15:16] message that's right I know there's a
[2:15:21] certain country that always professed
[2:15:25] ibly the message professed ibly the
[2:15:26] message and yet I saw pictures where
[2:15:28] they wrote on the streets in the public
[2:15:30] and William Branham is God we don't
[2:15:34] abandon wasn't God not the way they're
[2:15:37] saying or when read him was Jesus Christ
[2:15:40] or how they're saying this when it's God
[2:15:42] this one's God no no we're all gods
[2:15:45] because we're sons and daughters of God
[2:15:48] amen god help us brother stay in
[2:15:53] simplicity he promised this he promised
[2:15:55] that he's doing it yeah simple as I said
[2:16:00] he promised the resurrection what's the
[2:16:02] resurrection Oh the Dead coming back to
[2:16:04] life oh they're gonna come into our body
[2:16:07] oh there there right there and oh yeah
[2:16:11] the living Saints are gonna be raptured
[2:16:12] what do you mean it's like that brother
[2:16:14] challenged me on an email and he said
[2:16:18] brother he says you're preaching the
[2:16:20] rapture and I added on the on our
[2:16:24] homepage
[2:16:24] and he said he said that word rapture is
[2:16:27] not in the Bible
[2:16:29] so he said I don't believe that I said
[2:16:33] brother I said what is the word rapture
[2:16:39] mean I said it means this so I said is
[2:16:43] that in the Bible I see yes it is and I
[2:16:46] gave him the scripture and I said also I
[2:16:49] said let me emphasize this I said the
[2:16:51] word rapture is English and I said but
[2:16:55] now I said you don't speak English I
[2:16:57] said that's not your normal language
[2:17:00] your language you're born with as you
[2:17:02] look you're born with this language I
[2:17:04] said so I said I said what what is the
[2:17:07] word I said then you would use to
[2:17:09] translate this I said that which we
[2:17:15] shall be changed in a in a moment the
[2:17:17] thinking of and I will caught up with
[2:17:18] the with the saints of God that word
[2:17:21] that died in Christ so I saw brother
[2:17:27] apply the word in your language apply
[2:17:31] the word in the English language and I
[2:17:34] said it'll all come back to the
[2:17:35] scripture that we're gonna be cut off
[2:17:38] raptured and as the rapture means cut
[2:17:41] off
[2:17:42] so I said tell me those words in your
[2:17:44] language
[2:17:45] and I said would I believe it because
[2:17:50] it's in your language I said brother get
[2:17:52] the revelation of it and I said it's God
[2:17:56] in simplicity
[2:17:58] amen I said he did it 2,000 years ago
[2:18:01] and now he's gonna do it again hey man
[2:18:04] brother god help us and again you know
[2:18:09] why there's so many gonna miss it it's
[2:18:11] because it's simple and they missed the
[2:18:14] simplicity know what God is doing when
[2:18:17] he said he comes as a thief in the night
[2:18:19] that simple that's very simple we know
[2:18:24] what that means and a man that's in
[2:18:29] Christ and knows that he's overcome the
[2:18:31] things of the world he said it has no
[2:18:34] more ties to you at all you're free
[2:18:36] oh I pray God that's you and me by grace
[2:18:42] we're free from the influence of the
[2:18:45] world do what you got to do and move on
[2:18:49] and he said walk in the light as he is
[2:18:53] in the light and the blood of Jesus
[2:18:55] Christ cleanses us from all sin we have
[2:18:58] fellowship one with another forever see
[2:19:02] we have fellowship one with another
[2:19:04] forever and yet there's a lot of
[2:19:09] believers don't fellowship with nobody
[2:19:13] only in church thought Elvis
[2:19:20] grace we have fellowship one with
[2:19:24] another for every sit and I got a
[2:19:28] scripture reference there in Isaiah 43
[2:19:30] he said now he said I feel like shouting
[2:19:34] shouting Christian and he said it
[2:19:37] overcome everything and was over comer
[2:19:40] and reflected the beauty and the glory
[2:19:42] of God and he said that's the way every
[2:19:45] believer does that's the way Noah did
[2:19:48] that's the way lot did that's the way
[2:19:50] Moses did Joshua Daniel Shadrach Meshach
[2:19:55] and he said John the Baptist Zacharias
[2:19:59] Elizabeth and Simon he said that's the
[2:20:02] way you're real Christian does a man
[2:20:05] overcome and reflect the beauty and
[2:20:08] glory of God that is Grace in your life
[2:20:12] have you got grace you're an overcomer
[2:20:15] you got grace you're reflecting the
[2:20:17] beauty of God in your life amen
[2:20:22] many are many Christians through the
[2:20:25] ages and believers there dare to condemn
[2:20:28] I put this one down put that one down
[2:20:31] out there in the world no no brother
[2:20:35] it's grace for me it's grace for them
[2:20:39] again remind you this is personal and
[2:20:45] it's the grace of God when God gets
[2:20:48] personal with you why when he like he's
[2:20:52] you know whether it were the angel told
[2:20:55] whether round or God told whether round
[2:20:57] not to call those young people Ricky's
[2:20:59] and Rick Addison brother Brown called
[2:21:05] Ricky's Red Hatters and he criticized
[2:21:07] them and condemned them dangerous that
[2:21:09] don't do that
[2:21:10] he says some of them are my children or
[2:21:15] as Amy said a woman out there dressed
[2:21:18] with with this on that on he said is he
[2:21:20] side criticized the sin but don't
[2:21:23] criticize her he said he don't know she
[2:21:27] could be a seed of God
[2:21:29] oh where are we gonna be surprised who
[2:21:32] made it and surprised who didn't make it
[2:21:36] hey man god help us remember all brother
[2:21:43] I believe this I'd be that yes but we're
[2:21:44] bright God's require more of the bride
[2:21:48] then he then he does up the others oh
[2:21:51] yeah so you'd better leave if they got
[2:21:54] it an experience with God or there are
[2:21:56] some faith in God you encourage them
[2:21:58] live live the the bride life and see if
[2:22:02] they're going to hunger and thirst for
[2:22:03] it just even in the fellowship with
[2:22:11] denominational family every Sunday they
[2:22:16] drive by here and they go to a certain
[2:22:20] church just out there oh they they look
[2:22:24] here to see you Emma knees here they
[2:22:28] respect us and yet when in conversation
[2:22:33] with them there they write knowledge
[2:22:36] they said you know that years ago one of
[2:22:42] them said they were when they were young
[2:22:43] that we went to a certain church and
[2:22:46] even in that church and it wasn't
[2:22:47] Pentecostal and it wasn't Salvation Army
[2:22:49] and they say even in that church they
[2:22:52] said that the people would get up and
[2:22:54] and shout and praise the Lord and sing
[2:22:56] and and they said to his one there was
[2:23:00] one man there he get up and testify and
[2:23:03] he was praising God and shouting in his
[2:23:06] testimony and he was taught it was a
[2:23:10] tall gentleman she said and he'd get up
[2:23:13] and he's to any stets stand on the seat
[2:23:15] and then he'd step from one seat to the
[2:23:19] other one seat to the other and say it
[2:23:22] praising God and thanking God for saving
[2:23:24] his soul but and this didn't somebody
[2:23:28] else would do this somebody else do that
[2:23:29] or say that but she said there's none of
[2:23:32] that now no I said I know
[2:23:37] you find that in very few very it was
[2:23:40] hardly any churches out there with it
[2:23:42] yeah oh yeah sister Barnes told me one
[2:23:47] time she said brother Joe she said I
[2:23:49] used to go to the-- said the United
[2:23:51] Church and when she was just a young
[2:23:53] woman and she said oh my
[2:23:55] she said we sing and we praise the Lord
[2:23:57] and she said the anointing were so
[2:23:59] powerful she said that they had back
[2:24:02] then it wasn't electricity it was oil
[2:24:04] lamps they had hanging from the ceiling
[2:24:06] and she said all mine
[2:24:08] she should you look up and she said the
[2:24:11] oil lamps were shaking and moving back
[2:24:13] and forth she said there was so much
[2:24:16] power so much anointing is so much
[2:24:19] shouting and praising God she said in
[2:24:21] the United Church yeah what would they
[2:24:27] be doing in the Salvation Army but they
[2:24:29] were they were doing in the Pentecostal
[2:24:31] church all brother sister the power of
[2:24:34] God and what's he doing now in the
[2:24:38] bright church he's giving us work well
[2:24:42] we're going beyond that now we're going
[2:24:45] into the resurrection and the rapture
[2:24:47] more power more 90 and is absolutely
[2:24:52] controlling your life it is the grace of
[2:24:55] God amen grace not just bringing us into
[2:25:00] the rain into justification
[2:25:01] sanctification the baptism and the gifts
[2:25:04] no grace is bringing us into the
[2:25:07] resurrection and the rapture the climax
[2:25:11] of it the completion of it by the grace
[2:25:14] of God amen
[2:25:19] he said look Jesus showed us how it's
[2:25:23] done how did he do it by the word and
[2:25:26] that's how he's done it he was the word
[2:25:28] and if you abide in me and my words
[2:25:31] abide in you
[2:25:31] he said you're back to the word again
[2:25:34] the word of promise how do I overcome
[2:25:38] not me but the word that's in me he said
[2:25:43] the word of God then I overcome the
[2:25:44] things of the world because it's the
[2:25:46] word in me and he said listen in the 40
[2:25:51] days of temptation by God's Word Jesus
[2:25:54] overcame and he said Satan made three
[2:25:58] major assaults upon him in that
[2:26:01] temptation and he said but he met him
[2:26:05] with the word amen
[2:26:08] thus saith the Lord it is written now
[2:26:13] here's a good thing sometimes Satan can
[2:26:15] take you and when you think you're doing
[2:26:17] the will of God he said you can make a
[2:26:20] proposition and he says you'll fall for
[2:26:24] it yes sir and he said now let's just
[2:26:27] take for instance like our sister and he
[2:26:30] said they're pretty and he can get you
[2:26:32] to a place that you let your hair grow
[2:26:35] out and you didn't realize it looks so
[2:26:37] nice on you and the first thing you know
[2:26:39] easy to get to a feeling a little stuck
[2:26:42] up a little above something else some of
[2:26:45] you may and he said you want you know
[2:26:48] what I mean and he could take the same
[2:26:50] thing proposition it with you and he
[2:26:53] said that's right you got to go you got
[2:26:56] to overcome that just remember you're
[2:27:00] living for God you have objective and
[2:27:02] that's Jesus Christ outside of that
[2:27:04] there's nothing else counts except him
[2:27:06] and secondly for your family thirdly for
[2:27:10] yourself the first for God the next for
[2:27:13] your family the next for you you are
[2:27:15] number three that's the end of the road
[2:27:17] you put yourself class amen but he said
[2:27:20] you want to be like the world you want
[2:27:23] to be like to your sisters and
[2:27:24] denominations and he talked about his
[2:27:26] sister's changing their hairstyles and
[2:27:29] so on he says you don't want to be like
[2:27:32] the old
[2:27:32] no more he said you won't be like your
[2:27:35] sisters out there in the denomination so
[2:27:38] god help us
[2:27:39] brother is my prayer amen
[2:27:42] I pray more more grace in our lives
[2:27:46] grace
[2:27:48] listen grace in control if grace is in
[2:27:51] control
[2:27:52] grace is lining you up with the word
[2:27:55] grace is keeping you in line with the
[2:27:57] word grace is going to keep you on the
[2:27:59] straight and narrow amen so let's stay
[2:28:03] in line by the grace of God amen
[2:28:16] he said he would be a show-off and now
[2:28:19] that does it God's servants to be a
[2:28:22] show-off
[2:28:23] he said it hits you but you've got to
[2:28:29] give the glory to God he said Alleluia
[2:28:32] he said we give the glory to God amen
[2:28:37] praise the Lord he that overcomes all
[2:28:41] the worldly things of this age what will
[2:28:44] they do all was sit with him in his
[2:28:46] throne and he said and go in the rapture
[2:28:50] when he comes
[2:28:51] well he's come and we are moving on in
[2:28:56] the rapture by the grace of God amen god
[2:28:59] bless you let's tan
[2:29:09] we want to bring in more thoughts on
[2:29:12] grace grace magnified to the extent that
[2:29:17] grace takes over in Genesis and grace
[2:29:19] take grace takes over in the book of
[2:29:22] Revelation it's all Grace and again to
[2:29:28] leave you with this scripture that he
[2:29:29] shall bring forth the headstone thereof
[2:29:32] with shoutings crying grace grace grace
[2:29:37] unto it amen

[2:29:41] of rapture with crying's of grace grace

[2:29:49] of God amen don't away we will be
[2:29:52] delivered out of this world it's the
[2:29:54] grace of God the only way we'll get
