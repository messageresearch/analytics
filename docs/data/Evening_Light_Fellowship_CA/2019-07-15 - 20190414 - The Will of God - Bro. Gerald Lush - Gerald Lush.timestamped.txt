[51:35] power of God now in our lives because
[51:38] now we believe now in the present tense
[51:44] praise the name of the Lord all things
[51:48] are possible because now I believe
[51:55] praise the name of the Lord Amen god
[52:00] bless you turn with me to the book of
[52:02] proverbs chapter 6 the book of proverbs
[52:05] chapter 6 as we go into the word and
[52:13] maybe I might have ministered on it some
[52:15] time ago but we'll see there are a
[52:21] number of scriptures that I want to
[52:22] share with you please let's pay
[52:24] attention to the word a man man it's
[52:31] called on to ribbet to believe the truth
[52:33] whole truth and nothing but the truth
[52:36] Amen God gives us his word and God has
[52:39] instructed us not to head or to take
[52:40] away but to leave it the way that it is
[52:43] amen and to believe it the way that God
[52:46] has written it and let him by the grace
[52:49] of God and by the Holy Ghost let him
[52:51] bring it to pass
[52:53] amen it is in his way is time whether
[52:56] it's in your life or somebody else's
[52:58] life a man let him do it
[53:00] amen it's not doing what's right in your
[53:02] eyes is doing what's right in the eyes
[53:04] of God a man and there's too many still
[53:08] doing what's right in their own eyes and
[53:10] they're acting as human beings but not
[53:13] as the sons and daughters of God I mean
[53:15] they're gonna do what they do as a god
[53:17] amen because ye are God's you're the
[53:21] sons of God amen
[53:22] so we're going to go there and live as
[53:25] God you're going to talk as God you're
[53:28] going to do this and do that as God
[53:31] would do it amen
[53:32] so brother it's it's a reflection that
[53:34] it's not me that lives as Christ that
[53:37] liveth in me
[53:38] there's this tremendous brother what God
[53:40] requires of us in these last days
[53:42] well he's required it all down through
[53:44] the ages and it wasn't it wasn't man as
[53:48] a worry and enable it was God enable it
[53:51] was God with Abel it was God with Noah's
[53:54] God with Enoch brothers sister amen you
[53:57] talk about being in the will of God they
[54:00] must have been in the will of God most
[54:01] definitely and to receive what God
[54:04] wanted them to receive to do what God
[54:06] wanted them to do and and to say what
[54:08] God wanted them to say a man see they
[54:12] they're born they were born again God
[54:15] had control there and God has control of
[54:18] us through the finish work of Calvary
[54:20] amen
[54:21] they had a relationship with God you and
[54:24] I got a relationship with God amen
[54:26] so the grace of God to us as we go in
[54:29] and that's what I want to share with you
[54:31] in some thoughts on the will of God a
[54:33] number of scriptures and again we're
[54:36] familiar with the message that the
[54:38] prophet of God preached in 19 and 65 in
[54:41] November 19 and 65 and it was entitled
[54:45] trying to do God a service without his
[54:48] will amen you could be you could be
[54:51] doing this for God doing that for God
[54:53] but it's not the will of God and there
[54:55] there are thousands and thousands today
[54:58] guilty of that oh they I'm doing this
[55:01] for God I'm doing that for God but check
[55:03] it with the word a man and check it with
[55:05] the Holy Ghost in your heart is it the
[55:08] will of God amen
[55:10] so we've got it we've got to conclude as
[55:12] Jesus did not my real father dying be
[55:15] done
[55:15] amen and brothers over this is good yeah
[55:19] but that doesn't mean as God wants you
[55:21] to do it Amen the devil does some good
[55:23] things too you know and to deceive the
[55:26] people so brother what we do we got to
[55:29] do more the will of God and we got to do
[55:31] it for the glory of God amen god Elvis
[55:35] that what we're doing today is according
[55:38] to his will
[55:38] well we will do after the service is
[55:41] acordes will what you do at work at
[55:43] school no matter where it is it's
[55:45] according to the will of God amen
[55:48] but there's too many again as there was
[55:51] with Israel sorters with with the
[55:53] Gentiles
[55:53] there's too many that's doing what's
[55:55] right in their own eyes yet religious a
[55:58] man just like Cain
[56:00] so raised to us to fight to submit
[56:03] ourselves to the will of God and in
[56:06] proverbs chapter 6 and verse 1 my son if
[56:11] thou be surety for thy friend if thou as
[56:15] stricken Dyan with a stranger thou art
[56:21] snared with the words of thy mouth that
[56:23] are taken with the words of thy mouth do
[56:27] this now my son and deliver thyself when
[56:30] thou are come into the hand of a friend
[56:33] go humble thyself amen and make sure
[56:38] they go not sleep to thine eyes or
[56:44] rather give not sleep to thine eyes nor
[56:46] slumber to thine eyelids deliver thyself
[56:50] as a roll from the hand of the unter and
[56:53] as a bird from the hand of the Fowler go
[56:57] to the ant thou sluggard consider her
[57:00] ways and be wise and it says which
[57:05] having no guide overseer or ruler
[57:09] provided her meat in the summer and
[57:13] gathered her food in the harvest
[57:15] how long will those sleep o sluggard
[57:18] when will they rise out of thy sleep
[57:21] god bless his word he may be seated go
[57:27] back to proverbs chapter 5
[57:36] just showing you with the scriptures the
[57:38] faith comes by hearing the word amen and
[57:41] in proverbs 5 he said in verse 1 my son
[57:45] attain unto thy wisdom and bow die near
[57:50] to my understanding that thou mayst
[57:55] regard discretion and that thy lips may
[58:00] keep knowledge
[58:02] amen and back to chapter 6 again the
[58:11] scriptures that I have shared with you
[58:12] before quite some time ago and he said
[58:17] verse 16 he said these six things that
[58:21] the Lord hate do we ate them yay seven
[58:29] are an abomination unto Him a proud look
[58:33] a man do we hate it that we're not
[58:38] looking in the mirror we're not going to
[58:40] the stores to get what we feel we want
[58:43] to get so that we're going to look proud
[58:44] we're going to look good in the eyes of
[58:46] man what out here look in the eyes of
[58:48] God and the question is what is the will
[58:51] of God amen because some can control it
[58:56] others let it control them a man
[58:59] others can dress no matter what they
[59:01] want to do it there but again doesn't
[59:03] bother them doesn't matter to them as
[59:05] long as it's proper decent clothing and
[59:08] so on so he said a proud look and a
[59:11] lying tongue and hands that shed
[59:14] innocent blood and an heart that devises
[59:17] wicked imaginations
[59:21] he says feet feet that be swift in
[59:28] running to mischief amen we're hid hurry
[59:33] to do their to do what we want to do
[59:35] sometimes and as and it's the mischief
[59:37] it is sin in the eyes of God but not
[59:40] running to do what God wants us to do
[59:42] amen now I'm any gonna lay down their
[59:45] lives as he did many years ago
[59:48] and it says the false witness that
[59:49] speaketh lies and he that soweth discord
[59:52] among brethren these are the things that
[59:56] God hates a man were there to encourage
[1:00:01] one another in the Lord Amen and give
[1:00:04] God the glory and so he said my son keep
[1:00:08] thy father's commandment forsake not the
[1:00:11] law of thy mother and bind them
[1:00:13] continually upon thine heart and tie
[1:00:15] them about thy neck and when thou goest
[1:00:18] it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it
[1:00:21] shall keep thee and when the way cos it
[1:00:24] shall talk with thee amen
[1:00:27] God is our Father and our mother a man
[1:00:31] if we recognize the natural father and
[1:00:34] mother what about our spiritual father
[1:00:36] and mother a man we want a close
[1:00:39] relationship with the natural how much
[1:00:41] more do we wanted with the spiritual a
[1:00:43] man the eternal because the natural
[1:00:46] passes in the way because when we get
[1:00:49] the glory they're not going to see that
[1:00:51] woman and say that's mom no no if she
[1:00:54] makes it it's it's your it's your sister
[1:00:56] in the Lord and you're not her son
[1:00:58] you're your brother in Christ a man see
[1:01:02] all of these things changed and again as
[1:01:04] I said in that book that somebody gave
[1:01:07] me one time and I turned around of years
[1:01:09] later and I gave it back to somebody
[1:01:10] that belonged to that denomination and
[1:01:13] in that and once they read what it was
[1:01:14] but in that book they're paintings of
[1:01:17] the resurrection and right they said
[1:01:19] this is the resurrection and in the
[1:01:21] painting oh my it was Jesus up there in
[1:01:23] the cloud that's fine that's good but
[1:01:26] the rest of it was wrong the
[1:01:27] resurrection here they err they had
[1:01:30] little boys and little girls coming out
[1:01:31] of the grave and there they had old men
[1:01:34] and old women coming out of the grave
[1:01:35] and here they had others judge me in
[1:01:39] their Middle Ages who were coming out of
[1:01:41] the grave but the thing of it is in
[1:01:43] glory there there there there no old
[1:01:46] people there's no there's no babies
[1:01:48] there's no young people there's no
[1:01:50] infant of days nor nor an old man that
[1:01:52] has not fulfilled his days the Bible
[1:01:55] says that so but - why Jesus came to
[1:01:58] change that and give us the give us and
[1:02:01] heater
[1:02:01] body a man has eternal sons and
[1:02:05] daughters of God a man and brother I
[1:02:07] tell you this in any ringing glory and
[1:02:09] in heaven any it's eternity
[1:02:11] it is not time a man no way the angels
[1:02:14] are not getting old
[1:02:15] amen God's not getting old amen our
[1:02:19] theophany bodies are there that are
[1:02:20] getting old
[1:02:21] amen they're waiting for us to come back
[1:02:24] in a in a redeemed form and and receive
[1:02:28] that go into the oven e and receive
[1:02:30] glorified bodies a man Jesus came to
[1:02:33] accomplish all of that a man God God
[1:02:36] gave the promise from the beginning
[1:02:38] praise the Lord right now from the
[1:02:40] beginning right on to the end I'm when
[1:02:42] I'm going to receive but like again that
[1:02:44] what happened in the Garden of Eden and
[1:02:46] many of many many feel that well God did
[1:02:50] this and the devil did that but your God
[1:02:52] knew it and God allowed it and God
[1:02:54] permitted it and was all for a reason
[1:02:56] because God wanted to reveal his
[1:02:58] character and again
[1:03:01] Eve she said because she was a byproduct
[1:03:05] amen she wasn't that she wasn't of the
[1:03:08] original creation because God created
[1:03:11] Adam a man under the dust of the earth
[1:03:14] God made him a man in in his own image
[1:03:16] as it were and but he took he took part
[1:03:19] of Adam and made the woman a man so she
[1:03:22] was a byproduct and that was the
[1:03:24] weakness that she had a man so that when
[1:03:28] the enemy came he we could not do TV
[1:03:30] Adam but he they deceived the woman but
[1:03:34] when he deceived the woman and she went
[1:03:37] to the man and any and he saw what she
[1:03:40] had done and she expanded in this this
[1:03:43] and this well he couldn't he could have
[1:03:46] went back to where he fellowship with
[1:03:48] God and told God about it that in and
[1:03:50] told God maybe that he wanted another
[1:03:52] woman a man that he would want to
[1:03:54] divorce her a man but no so what did
[1:03:59] Adam do what he did Adam Adam submitted
[1:04:02] himself to her a man anything he did
[1:04:05] what the serpent had done to her and so
[1:04:07] on why did he do that a main thing God
[1:04:10] for the message of the hour they gives
[1:04:12] us understanding he said Adam but
[1:04:14] himself in sin Lisa with eat so he said
[1:04:17] that God redeeming him would redeem her
[1:04:19] a man praise the Lord hallelujah and
[1:04:23] understand - when God came down and
[1:04:25] judge them God judged the woman and God
[1:04:27] said to the serpent but God didn't judge
[1:04:29] the man he judge the earth for the man a
[1:04:32] man and he said to the woman he's now he
[1:04:35] said no he said impatiens you till you
[1:04:38] bring forth children a man and give
[1:04:41] birth and to the serpent he said now he
[1:04:43] said he says you're not going to no
[1:04:45] longer walk as a work but he said what
[1:04:47] are you going to do is you're gonna
[1:04:48] you're going to be going to the dust of
[1:04:50] the earth
[1:04:50] amen his legs come off his arms come off
[1:04:53] because people still think that he that
[1:04:55] he was he was a snake no no no back then
[1:04:58] he was the missing link between man and
[1:05:00] beast a man and he and he walked he had
[1:05:05] arms he could talk with man a man so
[1:05:08] close to the hand that he could could
[1:05:10] mingle with man a man that's why the
[1:05:12] serpent got in and he used the or the
[1:05:15] devil got in and he used the serpent to
[1:05:16] the CV amen and God came down and he
[1:05:20] cursed the woman and I put a curse on
[1:05:22] her and he put a curse on the serpent
[1:05:24] and then as I said the legs come off the
[1:05:27] and then the arms and you know and I'm
[1:05:29] not a few years ago I believe it was
[1:05:31] that I got a report regarding the what
[1:05:34] the scientists had discovered in certain
[1:05:37] serpents that they discovered just going
[1:05:40] and going in the dust of the earth and
[1:05:42] they discovered there well there's
[1:05:43] something here in the serpent and
[1:05:45] there's something down here in the
[1:05:46] serpent and they were wondering what it
[1:05:48] was we know what it was if this is where
[1:05:50] this is where the arms were and this is
[1:05:52] where the legs were a man but God cut it
[1:05:55] off and he said dust shalt thou eat all
[1:05:58] the days of thy light a man so he was no
[1:06:01] longer an upgrade creature now he was
[1:06:03] cursed and put down but when it comes to
[1:06:05] the man God come to the man and he's
[1:06:08] know she should have done what you did
[1:06:09] this is over because you did it he said
[1:06:12] I cursed the ground for your sake amen
[1:06:15] and in the sweat of your brow so you
[1:06:17] bring for a man so so the curse is and
[1:06:21] again
[1:06:21] that ought to humble our sisters and the
[1:06:24] brother God has warned us that we are
[1:06:26] living in in in a woman's world and that
[1:06:29] is the truth because more and more and
[1:06:32] more the women are taking control more
[1:06:34] and more the world the women are
[1:06:35] expressing what they feel and what they
[1:06:38] want and so on and trying to force the
[1:06:40] world to yield to their will a man then
[1:06:44] again that proves that we are back in
[1:06:46] the Garden of Eden again and so the
[1:06:49] sisters need to be on their guard a man
[1:06:52] by the grace of Almighty God don't think
[1:06:54] I'm a believer so I have a Christian and
[1:06:56] I'm this right I don't have no worries
[1:06:58] oh yes you do Amen you could understand
[1:07:01] that that curse is still there amen amen
[1:07:04] but it's only through Christ are we
[1:07:07] going are we redeemed amen so this is
[1:07:10] tremendous that God sent a prophet to
[1:07:13] bring out these revelations and to bring
[1:07:15] out these mysteries in these last days
[1:07:17] so that we may know that what happened
[1:07:21] in the beginning and we all know what's
[1:07:22] going to happen in the end a man by the
[1:07:25] grace of Almighty God a man thank God so
[1:07:29] brother I pray the grace of God help us
[1:07:30] that we're going to be we're going to
[1:07:32] stay with the will of God amen
[1:07:35] hey man the will of God and that will of
[1:07:37] God is right now for us it is revealed
[1:07:39] in the Word of God amen back here in the
[1:07:43] Garden of Eden the will of God was
[1:07:45] revealed personally from God to Adam and
[1:07:47] Eve but after the fall a man God was
[1:07:51] going to deal with him by faith it is by
[1:07:54] grace through faith
[1:07:55] after the God put him out of the garden
[1:07:57] God was going to deal with with Adam and
[1:08:00] Eve and Abel and Enoch and Noah and all
[1:08:02] of them and what is it by grace through
[1:08:04] faith a man so and they would be they
[1:08:08] would find the will of God by grace
[1:08:09] through faith now we do know that even
[1:08:12] in the Old Testament they were going the
[1:08:14] Bible says by faith they did this by
[1:08:16] faith they did that and so on so that
[1:08:18] was the grace of God for them to reveal
[1:08:21] the faith that pleased God and what it
[1:08:24] what is the faith it is the revelation
[1:08:26] of the will of God it is a revelation
[1:08:29] what God wants them to do amen
[1:08:33] not just to believe in God
[1:08:34] not just to believe this or believe that
[1:08:37] you got to believe the will of God for
[1:08:38] your life amen because it becomes a very
[1:08:42] personal situation
[1:08:44] a man so brother-sister that this is the
[1:08:47] important thing
[1:08:48] it's the the payor we think faith is
[1:08:50] believe in this doctrine faith is
[1:08:52] believing that doctor faith is believing
[1:08:54] the revelation of the will of God for
[1:08:57] you
[1:08:58] amen and part of it is believing the
[1:09:00] truth
[1:09:01] part of it is believing the word but God
[1:09:04] in control of you wants to do this God
[1:09:06] in control of you wants to do that Amen
[1:09:08] so it's not my will thing be done amen
[1:09:12] you're not going to do what's right in
[1:09:13] your own eyes you're going to do what's
[1:09:14] right in the eyes of God
[1:09:15] we're gonna live free to do that you got
[1:09:18] to live in the spirit a man you got to
[1:09:21] live in the spirit and you got to walk
[1:09:22] in the spirit now brother you're not
[1:09:24] you're not doing what your natural human
[1:09:27] spirit once you're going to do what the
[1:09:29] Holy Spirit wants hey man amen praise
[1:09:32] the name of the Lord that's why God
[1:09:34] ordained are they ordained this remain
[1:09:36] to stay in the will of God and that is
[1:09:39] by grace through faith brothers by grace
[1:09:42] through faith in the old testament by
[1:09:44] grace through faith in the new testament
[1:09:45] a man but there are so few that are
[1:09:50] recognizing what go to the will of god
[1:09:52] and they are not in the will of god they
[1:09:54] are out of the will of god amen they

[1:10:57] a man brother sister I pray their grace
[1:11:00] here to her to our brother Columbo I
[1:11:02] pray that glacier to his wife here and
[1:11:05] his daughters and so on the old mine not
[1:11:09] my will then be done
[1:11:11] brother it's the will of God that has
[1:11:13] taken us back hey man we got to get into
[1:11:16] the revelation of the will of God to get
[1:11:18] back get into the revelation will of God
[1:11:20] to please God a man by the grace of
[1:11:23] Almighty God amen
[1:11:25] so brothers sister again is a tremendous
[1:11:28] testimony tremendous witness and again
[1:11:31] for those that you got well you agree
[1:11:34] either going to acknowledge it or deny
[1:11:35] it and even where our brothers had to be
[1:11:37] here brother Alec to be here hey man
[1:11:40] praise the name of the Lord maybe and
[1:11:42] yet maybe there are others they were
[1:11:44] here and laughed and they should be here
[1:11:47] amen say but that man is doing what's
[1:11:50] right in his own eyes they're doing why
[1:11:52] they feel is good and what they feel
[1:11:54] they'll enjoy and whatever you know what
[1:11:56] they feel is better for them but when
[1:11:59] brother I tell you this what God
[1:12:01] considers better is one thing will you
[1:12:03] consider matters another well you
[1:12:05] consider best for you you know oh it's
[1:12:08] good for me well well good what do you
[1:12:11] mean it's like again like I said my
[1:12:13] father has told us often and we were
[1:12:16] growing up he said you're good well he
[1:12:18] said there are two kinds of good you're
[1:12:20] good or good for nothing so he said what
[1:12:23] are you and so it's to make sure you
[1:12:26] shoes are good make sure you're good for
[1:12:28] something not good for nothing
[1:12:30] a man so to be good for something you
[1:12:32] had to be in the will of God a man 9 my
[1:12:35] real father then be done and others of
[1:12:38] vast majority of believers that are not
[1:12:40] in the will of God amen no way they're
[1:12:45] not in the will of God where they are
[1:12:46] they're not in the will of God what
[1:12:48] they've done and where they did it and
[1:12:50] how they did it and so on just how do
[1:12:53] they think because I'm in the message
[1:12:55] and I'm in a message Church the other
[1:12:57] maybe God don't want you to be in this
[1:12:59] when the church organ or that message
[1:13:01] maybe God if they're there God want some
[1:13:03] here Amen hi brother a witness that over
[1:13:07] over the years and I could go and tell
[1:13:10] that tell this brother this tell that
[1:13:11] brother this or sister this and then
[1:13:14] they're not gonna do believe me they're
[1:13:16] gonna do what's right in their own eyes
[1:13:18] a man and others know Anna for the glory
[1:13:22] of Almighty God there are others set
[1:13:24] back over the years they have said
[1:13:26] listen why don't you go ask for the
[1:13:28] journal and and see see what the will of
[1:13:30] the Lord is amen and I'm still getting
[1:13:33] getting getting the emails still
[1:13:35] counseling the people still trying to
[1:13:37] get them to the revelation of the will
[1:13:39] of God amen
[1:13:40] and again as I say there are others that
[1:13:43] have said oh I don't like being around
[1:13:45] brother Jareau lost reason because he
[1:13:46] knows what I'm thinking and that's the
[1:13:49] truth and I said what I said if I knew
[1:13:52] whether thinking I'm not going to say
[1:13:53] anything so and then the power of God
[1:13:56] did the same thing he would walk away
[1:13:59] and so on amen
[1:14:01] but no that's just I give the glory to
[1:14:04] God brother and I believe that God has
[1:14:06] called me and I trust I trust by the
[1:14:08] grace of God as the prophet said I hope
[1:14:09] you don't believe me behind when he
[1:14:11] comes a man even the Prophet was
[1:14:14] acknowledging that he knew he said are
[1:14:16] you looking for mistakes easily I got
[1:14:18] lots of them he's like a lot of mistakes
[1:14:21] a man so he such I trust he said he
[1:14:24] won't leave me behind he said when he
[1:14:26] comes and we think all this as one
[1:14:28] person don't have no worries that's
[1:14:30] brother branham oh yeah because the
[1:14:32] privacy right on through the Bible and
[1:14:35] then the Apostles right on through the
[1:14:37] scriptures brother they've made their
[1:14:39] mistakes and then they're trying when
[1:14:41] God found them out of his will not in
[1:14:43] his will hey they were doing what was
[1:14:45] right in their own eyes are following
[1:14:47] their own leadership and not God's
[1:14:48] leadership oh yeah
[1:14:50] no brother there that we could I like
[1:14:53] the the Ministry of certain prophets and
[1:14:56] I can i light even the Ministry of Paul
[1:14:58] the Apostle and there were things that
[1:15:00] Paul did and he was
[1:15:01] the will of God Avengers think it was
[1:15:04] things that he did and getting out of
[1:15:06] the will of God brother o mine the devil
[1:15:08] is the devil is there to torment you the
[1:15:10] devil is there to detest you has to work
[1:15:13] because because Paul explains one thing
[1:15:16] in where then it wasn't the will of God
[1:15:18] and he said we did this and we did that
[1:15:20] we did this and he said we got to the
[1:15:22] place where we wish we were dead
[1:15:24] yeah because they were they had to
[1:15:27] endure this and they were that and it
[1:15:29] wasn't God that led him into it it was
[1:15:31] it was they was their own leadership it
[1:15:33] was what they were thinking in their
[1:15:35] minds when not following the leadership
[1:15:36] in their hearts a man it was the will of
[1:15:39] the devil but not the will of God hey
[1:15:42] man and he gave Satan a controlling our
[1:15:45] thoughts and to get us to do what our
[1:15:47] thoughts are saying instead of following
[1:15:49] revelation of what God wants us to do
[1:15:51] hey man
[1:15:53] see again Cain when did the revelation
[1:15:56] of what the devil wanted to do and his
[1:15:58] nature Abel and do what God wanted him
[1:16:01] to do hey man he had a revelation was my
[1:16:04] paid by faith by faith by faith man
[1:16:07] again Ebru zebras 11 is tremendous
[1:16:11] revelation of God dealing with his sons
[1:16:13] and daughters all down through and it is
[1:16:15] by faith and is my faith what is it it
[1:16:19] is the revelation of the will of God he
[1:16:21] always a revelation of this a revelation
[1:16:23] of that yeah but the revelation that God
[1:16:26] wants you to enter into a oneness with a
[1:16:28] man that is his will a man even in your
[1:16:34] everyday living and I I just that I had
[1:16:38] an email from a brother and he said
[1:16:40] brother he said you are my elder Easy's
[1:16:42] and he's a and he's the pastor himself
[1:16:44] but he said I consider you to be my
[1:16:47] elder brother and he said brother would
[1:16:49] you Lisa would you please counsel me I
[1:16:51] need help please tell me what to do in
[1:16:54] these circumstances and these situations
[1:16:57] and he highlighted three or four
[1:16:59] situations that he that he was dealing
[1:17:01] with anyone accounts as to what to do
[1:17:04] and how
[1:17:05] what is the will of God a man so brother
[1:17:09] what is the will of what is the will of
[1:17:11] God that I should do here what does the
[1:17:13] will of God I should do in this
[1:17:14] situation in these circumstances and so
[1:17:17] I I have counseled him about three times
[1:17:20] on certain things and no he said I'll be
[1:17:23] back he said there's another issue he
[1:17:25] said that I want you to counsel me on
[1:17:27] amen so brothers sister the oh my god
[1:17:31] have mercy on us but that we're there
[1:17:33] were going to be found in the will of
[1:17:35] God not in the will of the church not in
[1:17:38] the will of the devil not in the will of
[1:17:40] you just religion but in the will of God
[1:17:42] which is the Word of God amen amen
[1:17:46] and again it's got to be according to
[1:17:48] God's revelation and it's got it
[1:17:51] according to the way that God wants this
[1:17:53] will see it and the way that God wants
[1:17:55] us to believe it and the way that God
[1:17:57] wants us to do it amen
[1:17:58] and so that was so that it's going to
[1:18:00] control everything else that we do amen
[1:18:03] again there's not me that lives us
[1:18:05] Christ I live within me just thinking
[1:18:07] all your ideas it's the Lord it's the
[1:18:10] Lord it's the Lord amen anyway listen

[1:18:15] want you to help me today nyjah's Lord
[1:18:18] protect me but lord I want you to help
[1:18:20] me so that I'm going to do your will I'm
[1:18:22] going to do it the way you want me to do
[1:18:24] it I'm going to I'm going to act the way
[1:18:25] that you want me to hack I want to talk
[1:18:27] the way you want me to talk and so on
[1:18:29] amen praise the name of the Lord brother
[1:18:32] it is a challenge that again and again
[1:18:35] there's no wonder jesus said Strait is
[1:18:37] the gate and narrow is the way and
[1:18:39] through their me they find it
[1:18:40] amen because there's not many they're
[1:18:43] going to let go of what they want to do
[1:18:45] and just stay with what God wants them
[1:18:47] to do a man because they feel that
[1:18:50] they're over I'm not going to enjoy life
[1:18:52] if I do this I'm not going to enjoy life
[1:18:55] if I let that go let that go if I don't
[1:18:57] do this I don't do that or if I don't go
[1:18:59] here and go there I won't enjoy like

[1:19:03] to have light now in no way they're
[1:19:07] going to be kicked out they're going to
[1:19:08] be cut out but as they get ahead by the
[1:19:10] grace of God as I told our brother Billy
[1:19:13] Paul when when we were down there a
[1:19:16] couple of years old
[1:19:17] and I said hello and he just ran and
[1:19:20] shook my head and he said thank you
[1:19:22] thank you thank you brother for what
[1:19:24] you've done and I said brother listen
[1:19:26] what we did we did for the glory of God
[1:19:28] and I said what we and I said we lived
[1:19:31] for the glory of God I said we didn't
[1:19:33] live for ourselves we live for Jesus and
[1:19:35] I said we weren't looking for the next
[1:19:38] long holiday we were looking for a
[1:19:39] holiday there so we could go here and go
[1:19:42] there go somewhere else
[1:19:43] I said we were looking for those
[1:19:44] holidays so that we could so we could go
[1:19:47] fellowship with their brothers and
[1:19:48] sisters somewhere else
[1:19:49] amen maybe that's the absolute truth
[1:19:52] money amen amen but yet people want to
[1:19:56] know and all due respect they want to go
[1:19:58] to Florida or they want to go there and
[1:20:00] they want to go there holiday and so on
[1:20:05] well brother our holidays back there
[1:20:07] years ago our holiday shows that we
[1:20:09] enjoyed it only if we were with the
[1:20:11] brothers and sisters in the faith we
[1:20:14] enjoyed it by going here to help them
[1:20:16] going here they do a fellowship with
[1:20:19] them going there to encourage them a man
[1:20:21] by the grace of God oh it was wonderful
[1:20:24] hallelujah because why we be we're the
[1:20:27] Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost amen
[1:20:29] we were feeding on the word we were
[1:20:31] looking for eternity they were looking
[1:20:33] for eternity and so on see if brother
[1:20:36] Mike what a tremendous thing it is to be
[1:20:38] in the will of God and to live for God
[1:20:40] and to have the revelation reality in
[1:20:43] you that is not you to live 9 let me
[1:20:46] live it as trace living in me hey man
[1:20:48] and if Christ is living in you what's he
[1:20:50] going to do he's going to do this he's
[1:20:52] going to do that he's a man even the
[1:20:54] early church they went from house to
[1:20:56] house to house the house and fellowship
[1:20:58] fellowship fellowship fellowship morning
[1:21:00] noon and night by the grace of Almighty
[1:21:02] God brother sister and the individual
[1:21:05] with that attitude in that spirit that's
[1:21:07] the ones Alleluia that's the ones who
[1:21:09] are dating for the rapture that's the
[1:21:11] ones that are going in the resurrection
[1:21:12] that's the ones they may are going to
[1:21:14] the marriage supper of the lamb by the
[1:21:16] grace of God amen that's what they are
[1:21:19] living for they're not living for this
[1:21:21] world because this too shall pass away
[1:21:23] and brother then we are we're living in
[1:21:26] an age where in the private oh God said
[1:21:28] this is
[1:21:29] faster dude that is past dude that is
[1:21:31] past due even the company of the Lord is
[1:21:33] past due buddy buddy should we hunger
[1:21:36] and we thirst for it
[1:21:38] amen because we know that we're living
[1:21:40] in the hour of the resurrection
[1:21:42] we're living in the are the rapture this
[1:21:43] way and we believe it is past dude and
[1:21:46] he's for that that's why we're hungry
[1:21:47] and we're thirsting for it hey man and
[1:21:49] but where why are we where are we
[1:21:51] holding back he says it's for maybe for
[1:21:54] this brother for that sister for
[1:21:56] somebody else he said we're holding back
[1:21:58] and praying the grace of God to them
[1:22:00] maybe the last one to come in a man by
[1:22:03] the grace of Almighty God they can be
[1:22:06] realized now according to the will of
[1:22:08] God and the will of God is the word of
[1:22:11] God and according to the will of God
[1:22:12] brother sister that there is very little
[1:22:15] in the scriptures left to be fulfilled a
[1:22:18] man because practically 99% of the truth
[1:22:23] is fulfilled there was a time when the
[1:22:25] part of God so we are three minutes to
[1:22:27] midnight but brother I was save early a
[1:22:29] few seconds to midnight and I'd say a
[1:22:32] few seconds in the mind of God because
[1:22:34] 1,000 years there's one day as I and one
[1:22:37] day as a thousand years a man so brother
[1:22:40] closed early to the resurrection I
[1:22:43] closed early to the rapture because
[1:22:45] there is very little left to be
[1:22:47] accomplished in the earth it is a
[1:22:49] woman's world and then the Antichrist is
[1:22:51] rising in popularity and another thing
[1:22:55] we see what's going on in Israel a man I
[1:22:58] could explain to you concerning the
[1:22:59] prophecy we don't have the time but a
[1:23:01] concern the prophecy about America and
[1:23:03] about Russia and about Israel and about
[1:23:07] and about England and in other states
[1:23:09] the things of the prophet of God
[1:23:11] mentioned he said America crossed the
[1:23:14] line between mercy and judgment he said
[1:23:16] in nineteen and fifty seven I read that
[1:23:19] age and run that time they crossed the
[1:23:21] line well what do you mean cross the
[1:23:23] line between mercy and grace a man
[1:23:26] between between the grace of God and the
[1:23:28] judgment of God and America has been for
[1:23:31] many years now under the term it of God
[1:23:34] and that's why we are witnessing what's
[1:23:36] going on there now that was not the
[1:23:38] America that I knew back in back fifty
[1:23:40] years ago no
[1:23:42] no there's not the America that I knew
[1:23:43] forty years ago maybe thirty years ago
[1:23:46] but in those last number of years
[1:23:47] everything has changed and is changing
[1:23:49] around the world I pray God give us eyes
[1:23:53] to see a man again that we're going to
[1:23:56] look through his eyes and we're going to
[1:23:58] see that we are it has come to pass and
[1:24:00] it is coming to pass Amen why what has
[1:24:03] come to pass the prophecy concerning the
[1:24:06] end of the end time and we're in the
[1:24:08] public artistry there's coming a germ
[1:24:10] warfare and and that's on the earth now
[1:24:12] hey man old brother a view a view if you
[1:24:16] have checked your the internet and some
[1:24:18] of the news here some of the news there
[1:24:20] and they're warning about these diseases
[1:24:22] these diseases these diseases and it's
[1:24:24] all around the world and it's as our
[1:24:27] brother George and sister Rebecca spoke
[1:24:30] and a number of years ago in the
[1:24:33] believers international monthly letter
[1:24:35] that they sent out and they were they
[1:24:39] were dealing with German the term
[1:24:41] warfare and they they highlighted the
[1:24:43] fact that is not going to be new germs
[1:24:45] it's going to be it's going to be the
[1:24:47] old germs that are going to come back
[1:24:49] and they and what the cures are they
[1:24:53] that they profess to have back years ago
[1:24:56] is not going to work anymore
[1:24:57] a man so they said it's not the old new
[1:25:01] germs there's going to be the old germs
[1:25:02] a man and God according to his word is
[1:25:05] permitting it brother and sister brother
[1:25:07] and again in Matthew 24 and other
[1:25:11] references in the Bible concerning what
[1:25:13] we are going to witness in the last days
[1:25:15] we are witnessing a man it is coming to
[1:25:19] pass the scripture has been fulfilled
[1:25:22] and is being fulfilled what is left it
[1:25:25] is very absolutely very little when it
[1:25:28] comes to the Bride of Christ and the
[1:25:30] Gentile Church
[1:25:32] in Israel and Russia and what's going on
[1:25:36] in the Middle East brothers sister
[1:25:38] everything is happening so quickly a man
[1:25:41] and again this Benjamin Netanyahu they
[1:25:45] elected again as the Prime Minister of
[1:25:48] Israel he just barely got in but
[1:25:50] understand he is the Prime Minister now
[1:25:52] for the third season a man the third
[1:25:55] time brother sister is serious and it's
[1:25:59] all for a divine purpose I believe it's
[1:26:02] according to the will of God that he got
[1:26:03] elected back it's according to the will
[1:26:05] of God what's going on in Israel and it
[1:26:08] is according to the will of God what's
[1:26:10] going on in in the United States Amen
[1:26:12] God has promised itíd amen the American
[1:26:16] has crossed the line
[1:26:18] amen between mercy and judgment amen and
[1:26:21] they don't know the the churches across
[1:26:23] the line because they're part of God the
[1:26:26] messages inside the Father God preached
[1:26:28] the message the indictment and he said I
[1:26:31] and I do this this generate not only the
[1:26:33] church but I indict this generation and
[1:26:36] the governments and the world and the
[1:26:38] churches and religious people in data
[1:26:40] for the second crucifixion of the Lord
[1:26:43] Jesus Christ the second crucifixion of
[1:26:45] the word it is serious brother sister
[1:26:48] Aaron the world if you got the Holy
[1:26:50] Ghost and you got the baptism of the
[1:26:53] Holy Ghost and you were and it's Christ

[1:31:12] because that one is driving us to the
[1:31:14] other one amen what's going on in this
[1:31:17] world is driving us to that dimension
[1:31:19] and what God is doing
[1:31:21] amen amen me brothers sisters not far
[1:31:25] away here here's Katie doing what he did
[1:31:28] and Eira's able to but he did it wasn't
[1:31:31] very far from Abel because the Bible
[1:31:34] says he offered the more excellent
[1:31:35] sacrifice so brother the will of God is
[1:31:39] the more excellent sacrifice a man
[1:31:43] praise the name of the Lord the way the
[1:31:46] will of God and II know a man was the
[1:31:49] resurrection and the rapture the will of
[1:31:51] God in Nora
[1:31:52] amen watch what Noah did amen we're in a
[1:31:56] few souls were saved by water hey man

[1:32:14] a few that were saved by water in the
[1:32:16] days of Noah and then and the few was
[1:32:18] ain't a man so brother still we never we
[1:32:22] would never forget it because of the way
[1:32:24] that my mother would bring it out or the
[1:32:26] way that my father would bring it out a
[1:32:28] man and there's too many scriptures area
[1:32:31] in Proverbs that my father would quote a
[1:32:34] man so we thank the Lord that they had
[1:32:36] an experience with God
[1:32:37] a man and anyway in transfers they were
[1:32:40] concerned it was the will of God
[1:32:42] haebang quote the scriptures remind your
[1:32:46] children of this Christmas tree raise
[1:32:47] them up in the nurture and the
[1:32:49] admonition of the Lord amen and that's
[1:32:52] the Word of God that's the will of God
[1:32:54] amen you want to know how to raise your
[1:32:56] druid nurture and admonition of the Lord

[1:33:03] reminding them of the word and point
[1:33:05] them to the word amen
[1:33:06] highlighting the highlighting to them
[1:33:08] and let him know hey men that heaven and
[1:33:10] earth pass away by the earth what the
[1:33:12] word will never pass away hey man
[1:33:14] and God is creating a new evident a
[1:33:16] newer amen - they're going to focus as
[1:33:19] well on the natural because I'll tell
[1:33:21] you there's a lot of there to distract
[1:33:23] our our young people there's a lot a
[1:33:26] there to distract mom and dad there's a
[1:33:27] lot of there to distract even Grandma
[1:33:29] and Grandpa that is the absolute truth
[1:33:31] because the Devils are there to try to
[1:33:33] get us all out of the will of God amen
[1:33:36] and yet at the same time get us to think
[1:33:40] we are in his will amen when we were out
[1:33:43] of his will
[1:33:43] hey man God had mercy on his brother and
[1:33:46] Elvis said by the Word of God that will
[1:33:48] find the will of God and we're going to
[1:33:50] live the will of God by the grace of God
[1:33:53] amen faith is they give a say the faith
[1:33:57] is a revelation of the will of God amen
[1:34:00] so let's get into the revelation of
[1:34:02] their will of God remember they want my
[1:34:05] faith in Hebrews there they did this
[1:34:07] they did that and everything when it
[1:34:09] comes to
[1:34:12] what they did by faith amen
[1:34:16] it says faith is the substance of things
[1:34:18] old for and it is the evidence of things
[1:34:22] not seen
[1:34:23] it is substance and evidence so what my
[1:34:27] faith declares is more real than what my
[1:34:29] senses declare a man because he said by
[1:34:33] it the elders obtained a good report and
[1:34:37] through faith we understand the worlds
[1:34:39] were framed by the Word of God so that
[1:34:41] things which are seen were not made of
[1:34:44] things which to appear and it goes on
[1:34:47] down by faith able by faith a man he
[1:34:50] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:34:52] sacrifice than Cain by which now listen
[1:34:56] you get a blessing what is the blessing
[1:34:59] that Abel got Amen god responding to a
[1:35:05] bizarre sacrifice and it says he offered
[1:35:09] under God a more excellent sacrifice
[1:35:11] than Cain a man by which he obtained
[1:35:17] witness that he was righteous a man your
[1:35:25] righteousness is being in his in the
[1:35:27] will of God Amen hallelujah the
[1:35:33] righteousness of God is its provoked /
[1:35:37] provoked promoted rather to those who
[1:35:39] are going by the faith of God and the
[1:35:41] will of God oh my are you in the will of
[1:35:45] God it's like the problem of God said if
[1:35:50] you're working in a job and he said his
[1:35:53] position came up a new position higher
[1:35:56] more pay and he said and there was two
[1:35:59] of you
[1:36:00] he said qualified are you gonna claim
[1:36:05] that position he said no it not if
[1:36:08] you're a Christian
[1:36:12] where's the will of God each if you're a
[1:36:17] Christian you'll step back and you'll
[1:36:19] say no I won't take it give it to the
[1:36:21] over Oh somebody else will come as

[1:36:27] higher position you're gonna get more
[1:36:29] money you're gonna get this you're gonna
[1:36:30] get that and some people Oh make no
[1:36:33] wonder the Bible says the love of money
[1:36:34] is the root of all evil
[1:36:38] yeah at the I'm more interested in money
[1:36:40] than they are in the word the will of
[1:36:43] God
[1:36:44] yeah god help us burn just think that
[1:36:51] you will go to hell because one same
[1:36:54] spirit the rich man this is amazing
[1:37:01] amen Jesus so much a guy gave to the
[1:37:07] poor well that struck his heart to show
[1:37:13] that he wasn't in the will of God
[1:37:15] oh he was by the letter of the word
[1:37:18] jesus said do this do this do this do
[1:37:21] this always I've kept those ceases from
[1:37:24] my youth up what we couldn't say that no
[1:37:30] way

[1:38:00] God yeah he was God but the rich he said
[1:38:08] this is what you gotta do you know why
[1:38:11] you know why Jesus gave him that command
[1:38:12] he knew that's where his weakness was a
[1:38:15] man not the little God it was doing
[1:38:18] what's right in his own eyes and the
[1:38:21] prophet of God told him you gotta sell
[1:38:23] all you got give to the poor in the way
[1:38:27] not many gonna do that but the Bible
[1:38:31] says he lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:38:35] brother if you put more inches on some
[1:38:37] natural things than you do on the
[1:38:39] spiritual and it hinders it hinders God

[1:48:45] believers than your natural yeah if
[1:48:50] you're born again oh yeah you're
[1:48:55] attracted to your heavenly family amen
[1:48:59] the natural passes away and he said oh
[1:49:03] so ever shall do the will of God the
[1:49:06] same is my brother and my sister and
[1:49:10] mother amazing so who is your mother who
[1:49:16] is your brother who is your sister is
[1:49:18] they that do the will of God a man so
[1:49:22] you are my brothers sisters mother and
[1:49:26] your Center says father a man only those
[1:49:30] that do the will of God
[1:49:32] not oniy there's not many draw this line
[1:49:40] right there there's a number of
[1:49:43] believers today that are more caught up
[1:49:45] with their natural families than they
[1:49:47] are their spiritual
[1:49:49] Jesus got caught up with his spiritual
[1:49:52] not the natural even when he went back
[1:49:55] to Capernaum and his stepbrother who
[1:49:58] would call him they would say oh oh I'll
[1:50:01] come you you did that there did that
[1:50:03] there did that you you won't do nothing
[1:50:04] here
[1:50:05] he said because of your unbelief he
[1:50:10] rebuked him for their unbelief he was
[1:50:14] putting the emphasis on the spiritual
[1:50:15] sons and daughters of God they were his
[1:50:18] brothers and sisters and he told us if
[1:50:21] we're if we do this and walk in the
[1:50:23] light and say it obey his word we are
[1:50:25] his brothers and his sisters he we don't
[1:50:29] he won't stop to consider the Sirians of
[1:50:31] our relationship the significance of
[1:50:34] what we do identifies our relationship
[1:50:39] so whosoever shall do the will of God
[1:50:43] the same is my brother and my sister and
[1:50:47] my mother those that do the will of God
[1:50:50] for their lives and everyday living they
[1:50:55] are his brothers sister and mother amen
[1:51:00] turn with me to Romans chapter eight
[1:51:05] Romans chapter eight
[1:51:19] it says in verse 26 likewise the spirit
[1:51:27] also helpeth our infirmities for we know
[1:51:30] not what we should pray for as we ought
[1:51:34] but the Spirit itself maketh
[1:51:36] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:51:39] cannot be uttered and either search of
[1:51:43] the heart knowing what is the mind of
[1:51:45] the Spirit because he maketh
[1:51:48] intercession for the saints according to
[1:51:51] the will of God so when you pray in the
[1:51:54] spirit when you pray you got to pray in
[1:51:57] the spirit because the Spirit would make
[1:51:59] it a session according to the will of
[1:52:00] God for you and for your everyday living
[1:52:05] it's not what you feel you've got to do
[1:52:07] is what God wants you to do so he said
[1:52:14] he that search of the hearts knoweth
[1:52:16] what is the mind of the Spirit the Holy
[1:52:20] Spirit because he maketh intercession
[1:52:22] for the Saints according to the will of
[1:52:26] God a man Romans chapter 12 again the
[1:52:32] significance is based on the will of God
[1:52:36] Romans chapter 12 and verse 1 I beseech
[1:52:42] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[1:52:45] God that ye present your bodies a living
[1:52:50] sacrifice amen not just going to church
[1:52:57] but God wants to use you over there for
[1:52:59] something God wants you to do this God
[1:53:02] want you to do that amen
[1:53:05] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:53:09] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:53:12] reasonable
[1:53:15] it's your reasonable service amen I
[1:53:20] think you were singing here concerning
[1:53:22] what Christ has done for you for us
[1:53:25] I've been mentioned in prayer but what
[1:53:27] Christ has done for us what ought we to
[1:53:29] do for him
[1:53:29] brother we consider what he's suffering
[1:53:32] and and today in this generation people
[1:53:37] avoid suffering they avoid suffering for
[1:53:41] the gospel sake they don't want to
[1:53:42] suffer for this brother for this sister
[1:53:45] no they do well I'll just leave it to
[1:53:51] them
[1:53:51] go on what does God wants you to do amen
[1:53:56] the Bible tells us that the week got a
[1:53:58] support strong the strong rather got us
[1:54:01] some more the weak yeah so are you
[1:54:06] supporting the weak are you there for
[1:54:09] your brother and sister are you praying
[1:54:12] for them do you love them amen
[1:54:17] love to the extent you can't forget him
[1:54:20] amen and he said so he said which is
[1:54:24] your reasonable service and be not
[1:54:28] conformed to this world but be
[1:54:30] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:54:33] that ye may prove what is that good and
[1:54:38] acceptable and perfect will of God so
[1:54:44] you think you're in the will of God
[1:54:45] because you believe the message no he
[1:54:49] you're in the will of God wouldn't when
[1:54:50] he's in you and he and he's living is
[1:54:53] living the message out through you not
[1:54:56] talking it through your tongue living it
[1:54:58] through your life Amy you're separated
[1:55:02] unto the Lord for the resurrection in
[1:55:04] the rapture God's doing something see
[1:55:06] listen who was in the will of God when
[1:55:10] they came out of Egypt look all they saw
[1:55:12] what God didn't heed you surely they
[1:55:15] knew that God was able to destroy the
[1:55:17] enemy and in in the promised land but no
[1:55:20] no they they they were just caught up
[1:55:22] with themselves and they were fearful oh
[1:55:25] they just didn't believe amen
[1:55:28] they refused the will they wanted the
[1:55:30] will of God to come out of it you
[1:55:33] and face the Egyptians but they didn't
[1:55:36] want the will of God to go into the
[1:55:37] Promised Land
[1:55:37] oh I want the will of God to come out of
[1:55:43] here I want I don't want to be subbing
[1:55:45] through this and subject to that yeah
[1:55:48] and there's people commended nominations
[1:55:50] think they don't have to be subject to
[1:55:52] anybody it's like I said it at the altar
[1:55:55] one time when we were praying dead
[1:55:56] certain certain believers said oh thank
[1:55:59] you Lord for delivering us from the
[1:56:00] churches now we don't have to be snobby
[1:56:02] 20 men that was a lie of the devil
[1:56:08] become more subject because God has said
[1:56:11] in the church the five full ministry
[1:56:17] that they asked the prophet of God in
[1:56:20] the opening of the seven seals in
[1:56:22] questions than answers they said oh does
[1:56:26] the bride ever ministry yes he said the
[1:56:30] bride's got a ministry said and he says
[1:56:32] been there he says since since the day
[1:56:34] of Pentecost he said God has said in the
[1:56:37] church he sort of fivefold ministry and
[1:56:38] he listed them that was his answer to
[1:56:40] the question in the seals and wonders I
[1:56:46] quoted I believe the last service that
[1:56:48] he's the popular pastor the pastor he's
[1:56:51] as a judge he's judged by the word oh
[1:56:57] yeah he said even the Evangelist has got
[1:57:00] to have a pastor amazing grace of God
[1:57:07] brother let's prove what is that good
[1:57:11] acceptable and perfect will of God God
[1:57:16] is testing your subjection as I said if
[1:57:19] you're not something here you won't be
[1:57:20] something there oh yeah because there's
[1:57:25] gonna be there's gonna be a thought he's
[1:57:26] there they're gonna be subject father
[1:57:30] God has exhorted us he said if you're if
[1:57:34] you're here and you're subject you're
[1:57:36] all over over the people you'll be over
[1:57:37] to people there
[1:57:39] people don't realize that that's that's
[1:57:43] one place they think in heaven or we can
[1:57:45] do what we want to do know if anybody
[1:57:49] does everything decently and in order is
[1:57:51] God and I tell you heaven is in its
[1:57:54] decent and in order very bad that's
[1:57:58] right
[1:57:59] these are above these these are next
[1:58:01] below below the law there's also side
[1:58:03] the city oh we still got something to do
[1:58:07] as I said don't get the idea you're
[1:58:11] going to a dream world fairy tale a lot
[1:58:15] of ideas of having her dreams oh we
[1:58:19] won't have to do this we won't have to
[1:58:21] do that God is testing you and I'll tell
[1:58:24] you if he's testing anyone that's too
[1:58:26] bright because she got to sit with him
[1:58:29] and it's wrong so brother leaders prove
[1:58:34] what is that good acceptable and perfect
[1:58:36] will of God
[1:58:39] all right go to me with Ephesians
[1:58:41] chapter 6 I let her finish with the
[1:58:46] scriptures
[1:58:47] Ephesians chapter 6 amen and in verse 1
[1:59:00] it says children obey your parents in
[1:59:02] the Lord for this is right honor thy
[1:59:05] father and mother and this is obey your
[1:59:10] parents in the Lord for this is right
[1:59:13] honor thy father and mother which is the
[1:59:16] first commandment with promise that it
[1:59:19] may be well with thee and thou mayest
[1:59:21] live long on the earth and ye father's
[1:59:23] provoke not your children to wrath but
[1:59:27] bring them up in the nurture and
[1:59:29] admonition of the Lord amen servants
[1:59:34] will be into the hem that are your
[1:59:36] masters according to the flesh with fear
[1:59:40] and trembling in singleness of your
[1:59:44] heart as unto Christ not with eyeservice
[1:59:47] as men pleasers but as the servants of
[1:59:51] God oh Christ
[1:59:53] doing the will of God from the heart
[1:59:56] amen
[1:59:57] see it's the will of God now it's got to
[2:00:02] be from the heart
[2:00:03] it's expounded we're given the
[2:00:06] understanding of revelation of what the
[2:00:07] will of God is and where it is if you're
[2:00:12] born again the will of God is in the
[2:00:15] heart you're living out of your heart
[2:00:19] your attitude your spirit when you meet
[2:00:22] people you're doing the will of God
[2:00:25] there's a spirit comes out amen praise
[2:00:29] the Lord
[2:00:30] so he said doing the will of God from
[2:00:33] the heart and with good doing service as
[2:00:36] to the Lord and not to me okay you do to
[2:00:42] what God wants to do not what man wants
[2:00:44] to do a man turn with me again to the
[2:00:51] book of Hebrews chapter 6 I'm proving by
[2:00:58] the word what the Scriptures has to say
[2:01:03] concerning the will of God and the
[2:01:06] significance of the will of God and how
[2:01:08] that God wants you to walk in his will
[2:01:17] in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 36 and
[2:01:23] the Bible says others had trial of cruel
[2:01:26] mockings and scourgings came over of
[2:01:31] bonds north eleven bonds and
[2:01:34] imprisonment where they suffered a lot
[2:01:38] but God of prevent permitted it so I'd
[2:01:40] be the will of God he wanted it to bring
[2:01:44] out their faith amen
[2:01:47] in 1036 for ye have need of patience
[2:01:53] that after you have done the will of God
[2:01:56] you might receive the promise amen
[2:01:59] give me two patience that after you've
[2:02:02] done the will of God you might receive
[2:02:04] the promise
[2:02:06] amen so brother the will of God is very
[2:02:10] significant amen now let's go to first
[2:02:14] Peter just a couple more scriptures
[2:02:17] first Peter chapter 4 and verse 14 first
[2:02:28] peter 4:14 if he be reproached for the
[2:02:31] name of Christ happy are you for the
[2:02:35] spirit of glory and of God rested upon
[2:02:38] you and on their party is evil spoken of
[2:02:41] but on your part he is glorified they
[2:02:45] may but let none of you suffer as a
[2:02:48] murderer as a thief as an evildoer or as
[2:02:52] a busybody in other men's matters yet if
[2:02:59] any man suffer as a Christian let him
[2:03:01] not be ashamed but let him glorify God
[2:03:04] on this behalf for the time has come the
[2:03:07] judgment must begin at the house of God
[2:03:11] and if at first begin at us what shall
[2:03:15] the end be of them that obey not the
[2:03:18] gospel and the righteous scarcely be
[2:03:23] saved if the righteous scarcely be saved
[2:03:25] where shall the ungodly and sinner
[2:03:28] appear wherefore let them that suffer
[2:03:32] according to the will of God we suffer
[2:03:36] suffer according to the will of God
[2:03:39] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[2:03:42] and well doing as unto a faithful
[2:03:45] creator amen if you're suffering
[2:03:49] according to the will of God commit your
[2:03:52] soul to him amen as on to a faithful
[2:03:56] creator amen
[2:03:58] judgment begins at the house of God -
[2:04:01] what to test those that are in the will
[2:04:04] of God or out of the will of God
[2:04:09] so are you in the will around don't go
[2:04:14] by your mind go by your heart amen
[2:04:18] first John chapter 2 familiar Scripture
[2:04:28] first John 2 and verse 15 love not the
[2:04:34] world
[2:04:36] amen
[2:04:38] neither the things that are in the world
[2:04:43] If any man love the world and it's
[2:04:47] referring to the ways of the world and
[2:04:49] and what the world is offering and so on
[2:04:52] If any man love the world the love of
[2:04:55] the father is not in him
[2:04:57] for all that is in the world the lust of
[2:05:01] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[2:05:03] the pride of life is not of the Father
[2:05:06] but is of the world and the world
[2:05:10] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[2:05:13] that doeth the will of God abideth for
[2:05:17] ever go back to the will of God again
[2:05:19] what is the will of God for you in this
[2:05:24] world amen
[2:05:26] what does God want you to think out as
[2:05:28] God wants you to walk talk and act and
[2:05:30] react amen
[2:05:33] according to the will of God praise the
[2:05:37] name of the Lord he that doeth the will
[2:05:39] of God abideth forever see the
[2:05:42] significance make sure you're in the
[2:05:44] will of God
[2:05:45] don't don't just assume it make your
[2:05:48] calling and election sure it make your
[2:05:51] call and election sure you got to make
[2:05:52] sure you're in the will of God know that
[2:05:57] your election is in the will of God amen
[2:06:02] your calling is in the will of God amen
[2:06:09] the prophet of God said I would rather
[2:06:11] have a church with 50 people in the will
[2:06:15] of God than to have five
[2:06:19] out of the will of God sure God can do
[2:06:24] more with a man in his will in one hour
[2:06:26] than he could with a man out of his will
[2:06:29] in 50 years
[2:06:31] he is stumbling and staggering like
[2:06:34] shooting in the dark but when man is
[2:06:36] really in the will of God
[2:06:38] and knows his calling he should abide
[2:06:40] there amen
[2:06:43] Jesus on his way up the devil always
[2:06:46] doubted that being any more than a
[2:06:48] prophet he didn't believe that he was
[2:06:50] Emanuel how could God the Creator ever
[2:06:53] stand and that somebody tell him if you
[2:06:56] be the Son of God command the stones to
[2:06:58] be turned to bread
[2:07:00] how could he in pilots courtyard and
[2:07:02] there he was with a rag around his face
[2:07:05] the Roman soldiers spitting in his face
[2:07:08] jerking on the beard and the blood
[2:07:11] pouring through with a crown of thorns
[2:07:13] on his head and his blood running freely
[2:07:16] down his side and Satan watching that
[2:07:20] and Satan said that can't be the Son of
[2:07:23] God it just can't be he wouldn't put up
[2:07:26] with that but he put up with it for you
[2:07:28] and me now we're we willing to suffer
[2:07:32] for him as he suffered for us he said
[2:07:37] but the sons of God put up with anything
[2:07:39] as long as they know they're doing the
[2:07:42] will of God and that's what he come to
[2:07:49] that's what every genuine believer has
[2:07:52] to do separate yourself from doubters
[2:07:55] and unbelievers and walk with Christ
[2:07:59] it's life to you and Abraham did such a
[2:08:04] thing in 25 years later we find him
[2:08:07] still believing the promise he had
[2:08:09] focused his mind to the will of God by
[2:08:12] the Word of God and believed it and if
[2:08:15] we can focus ourselves to the plan of
[2:08:17] God to what God wants us to do and what
[2:08:20] God promised us he's to let everything
[2:08:23] else alone he said no matter how long it
[2:08:25] is just keep believing just
[2:08:28] thing abran waited 25 years for the
[2:08:31] child and Mort longer he waited
[2:08:34] physically the more impossible it seemed
[2:08:38] amen
[2:08:40] God was letting to go let it go let it
[2:08:42] go until it would be America and God
[2:08:46] allows things in your life your life and
[2:08:48] I and brothers and sisters from life
[2:08:53] until what until there's prune that your
[2:08:56] life is a miracle yeah you wouldn't bill
[2:08:59] do it without the will of God amen
[2:09:05] working out the miracle of Christ in you
[2:09:08] amen
[2:09:11] he said Paul could not go to a certain
[2:09:14] places that he wanted because the Spirit
[2:09:16] forbade him remember many times that
[2:09:18] Paul was trying to go some place
[2:09:20] thinking there is where I could have a
[2:09:23] great meeting but the Spirit forbid him
[2:09:27] now he said does that clearly state and
[2:09:30] prove that Paul was a prisoner to Jesus
[2:09:32] Christ he was harassed to his word by
[2:09:35] the spirit he so I like that and he we
[2:09:39] feel well oh we got to be a witness we
[2:09:41] got to go here we got to go there we got
[2:09:42] to do this got it no you got to be led
[2:09:44] by the spirit what does God want you to
[2:09:46] go there this guy wants to do this
[2:09:48] because the prophet of God said we're
[2:09:50] not going to reach everyone with this
[2:09:52] message
[2:09:52] he said only the elect but with the bit
[2:09:57] with the the basics of the gospel of our
[2:10:01] Lord Jesus Christ the world will receive
[2:10:03] that witness and it is I've already
[2:10:04] brought that out concerning and that
[2:10:06] just not only Internet television and
[2:10:09] radios and all that stuff and but it's
[2:10:11] in Madonna love magazines going around
[2:10:14] the world amazing absolutely amazing and
[2:10:18] it's only again the last couple of weeks
[2:10:20] I saw two or three other magazines and
[2:10:23] they're they're famous magazines but
[2:10:25] again it's they're focusing on spiritual
[2:10:28] something spiritual
[2:10:30] to them this religious foster spirit
[2:10:33] what is it it's a witness to the world
[2:10:35] the whole world got to receive that
[2:10:37] witness but when it comes to the message
[2:10:39] that's just for the bright for the
[2:10:42] resurrection and the rapture amen and it
[2:10:48] says Paul was bound by a chain and by
[2:10:50] fetters of love to do the will of God
[2:10:52] and that only regardless of our green
[2:10:55] the pastor was here on this side or that
[2:10:58] site he had to go the way the leader and
[2:11:01] the yoke went Oh tonight if we as
[2:11:05] Brenham Tabernacle could only become
[2:11:07] prisoners to our own selfish being to
[2:11:12] our own ambition and we could completely
[2:11:14] surrender ourselves and be yoked to
[2:11:17] Christ no matter what the rest of the
[2:11:20] world thinks no matter what the rest of
[2:11:22] the world does we are yoked with fetters
[2:11:25] of love we are prisoners to Christ amen
[2:11:29] and the will of God is usually contrary
[2:11:33] to our will amen god help us that we're
[2:11:38] going to seek the will get in the will
[2:11:42] no matter what no matter what it's for
[2:11:45] don't you it don't you make the decision
[2:11:47] find God's will as I said there's many
[2:11:52] today in different parts of the world
[2:11:54] and they shouldn't be her out of the
[2:11:57] will of God you know and it's like a
[2:12:04] missionary one time he said to a lot of
[2:12:07] the preachers in America he said please
[2:12:10] he said dose it don't send any American
[2:12:14] evangelists he said I think at the time
[2:12:17] he was in Africa or somewhere like that
[2:12:19] he said don't send any American
[2:12:21] evangelists please he said there just
[2:12:24] couldn't lead the people astray because
[2:12:26] what he was experiencing and he was not
[2:12:29] African but he was in Africa but what he
[2:12:31] was experiencing was a lot of things
[2:12:34] that was contrary to the word country to
[2:12:36] the message yeah and they were there to
[2:12:39] promote their own ministries
[2:12:41] but not what God was doing not the will
[2:12:43] of God there will a men so he said
[2:12:47] please you American Eve and just stay
[2:12:49] home so brother and I get a lot of
[2:12:53] emails sometimes for this for this for
[2:12:55] this for this for this and just I got it
[2:13:00] one again yesterday someone asked
[2:13:01] another question would you please
[2:13:03] explain this question not yesterday it
[2:13:05] was last week this is what about this
[2:13:09] ministry I said well brother I cannot
[2:13:14] condone that ministry I'm sorry I said
[2:13:19] 30 years ago I said we have problems
[2:13:21] with that ministry so please in the name
[2:13:23] of Jesus don't submit yourself to that
[2:13:26] ministry and and that was the brother
[2:13:28] was from Africa but the minute the
[2:13:32] ministry is referring to was not an
[2:13:34] African ministry it was from another
[2:13:38] Western type ministry so brother caught
[2:13:43] helpless again straight us away gate
[2:13:46] narrow is the way and do there be that
[2:13:48] find it why again it's the scripture
[2:13:51] fulfilled
[2:13:52] he said there's gonna be such going on
[2:13:56] in the last days that he said would
[2:13:58] deceive the very elect impossible now
[2:14:01] brother sister if it's that bad you
[2:14:04] should be on our guard
[2:14:05] and we should make sure were in the will
[2:14:08] of God we are doing what God wants us to
[2:14:11] do when he wants us to do where he wants
[2:14:14] us to do the will of God
[2:14:16] he's what matters not my real father
[2:14:19] dying to be done brother I could even go
[2:14:22] through the scriptures even the Old
[2:14:23] Testament and prove where this one got
[2:14:25] out of the will of God that one got out
[2:14:26] of the will of God
[2:14:27] you know maybe only once but God had to
[2:14:30] go after him and bring him back into his
[2:14:32] will because they did when God reveals
[2:14:35] his will the devil is there to get you
[2:14:38] out of it a man oh yeah just just
[2:14:42] constantly I thought so even even now a
[2:14:44] number a number of number of prophets in
[2:14:49] the Old Testament
[2:14:50] they just just one thing they got had
[2:14:52] the will of God you know we got to stay
[2:14:56] in the will of God then the brother and
[2:15:02] one prophet not out of the will of God
[2:15:05] and it cost him his life
[2:15:06] he didn't cost him his Redemption or his
[2:15:09] salvation but it cost him his life on
[2:15:11] her Tod cut it off now there's a number
[2:15:15] there like that
[2:15:16] and you come on down even - even into
[2:15:18] the New Testament again there are those
[2:15:20] that got out of the will of God now even
[2:15:23] down to this hour there are many that
[2:15:24] are out of the will of God amen because
[2:15:28] they're doing what's right in their own
[2:15:29] eyes grace
[2:15:31] god bless you to stay
[2:15:40] you make your call unless you're sure
[2:15:43] again well now you know to make my
[2:15:47] called an election sure I gotta make
[2:15:49] sure I'm in the will of God amen let's
