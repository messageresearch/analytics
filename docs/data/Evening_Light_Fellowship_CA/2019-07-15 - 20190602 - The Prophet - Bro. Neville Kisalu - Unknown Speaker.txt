thank the Lord amen the blood is applied through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it is the life of the blood in us that's right it is the life of the blood in me it is the token that God's looking for and without it you're not saved amen without it the blood is not applied but the life of the blood is there amen and it's going to bring forth the Life of Christ that's why now that's why we can say it's not me that lives it's Christ that live with in me amen thank the Lord so God bless you all for coming and again the Columbo family and uh our brother Jean Paul Amen brother from onario he's a French brother again of course from the Congo as as as the columbos are so uh God bless him glad to have him with us we enjoyed his Fellowship last night at brother Columbus and also to we're going to welcome our brother Neville and uh we'll let him say the rest of it his name but we're I never as I said we never dreamed that we'd have brother Neville ministering to us but again not the brother Neville of the pastor in Brenham Tabernacle but the brother Neville that is the pastor of uh of our brother John's Church in Ontario and the church in in Washington so we welcome them amen and they all had Fellowship I think some time ago in in the Congo the columbos and our brother Jean and our brother Neville so uh so God is God is mysterious in what he does how he does it when he does it where he does it amen it's up to him there the reason that he brought them here amen never let let them stay in the Congo amen so he brought them here and he brought our brother Neville to to United States and to Canada our brother Jean and so on so to God be the glory brother God is God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform amen and again this book right here the Bible brother it is absolutely when it comes to the Natural man it is very mysterious amen because they fail to comprehend God's plan God's purpose and God's pattern amen they they'll quote this scripture and move on quote that scripture but they they're not able to apply it to understand the the plan of God the pattern of God and the purpose of God am amen because he in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and he had a plan he had a he had a purpose and he had a pattern amen I trust that he's working out his plan and his purpose and his pattern in our lives and this is why so many fail to recognize what God has done what God's doing what he's going to do because they can't they can't catch it in the word of God oh this is just God's book you know and or the words are good and so on but but it's God's plan amen it's the revelation of his plan it's the revelation of his purpose it's the revelation his pattern how he's going to do it and how he is doing it and that's why we're here is because we recognize the plan the purpose and thank God we recognize the pattern amen it's scripture it's the word so God help us no wonder he said walk in the light don't just don't just talk it walk it amen and live in the light by the great not just can say I believe this I believe that go let your light reflect it let your life reflect it by the gra of almighty God there's too many that are going by the letter of it but they don't have the Dynamics and see brother and sister the Dynamics is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and without it we're lost it it is God's it is God's response to our faith when we when we repented when we got baptized then God God's not looking to God God appreciates that but what God's looking is in your heart amen is it faith or and and the revelation of the word the Dynamics of the word convicting you is it the life of the blood convicting you and you're responding to that conviction or is it just the the the mechanics letter of the word oh well I want to be good I want to this I want that what does God want amen that's the thing let's not do what's right in our own eyes let's do what's right in the eyes of God Amen let's go forth and reflect what God is doing now amen not what he did even 50 years ago not what he did a 100 years ago for sure amen because where we're going now is a far cry from from where the others what God required of the others God's requiring what he's requiring of us the resurrection and the Rapture and that's the end of it for the Gentile dispensation amen that's the truth it goes into the great Great Tribulation so God give us Grace that we're going to be part of the Resurrection part of the Rapture by the grace of God and the married supper of the Lamb oh it's tremendous so to God be the glory let's pray Grace that as the word Goes Forth we pray the anointing our brother Neville that God's going to anoint and him and it'll be Jesus preaching not brother Neville amen see as brother vam says I got to get myself out of the way so and so he can do it amen not only signs and wonders but the ministry of the word so the ministry got to get themselves out the way so the Holy Ghost is ministering the word and we got as at the con ation you got to get yourself out of the way to receive it amen to receive it into your soul not into your head so the grace of God brother that we're not we're not down here not even down here we're up here the the the the Capstone has come down amen it is the crowning of what God has done down through the Gentile Church ages amen and the crowning what's he going to Do's he's going to take us up amen he come down to redeem us now he's going to to take us up amen by the grace of almighty God so the Lord bless you we uh I'll try not to be too long but uh because we have fellowship at brother marks this afternoon sometime because our our brother John here is as his flight at six o'clock back to Ontario amen so we're glad to have our brother John from from Ontario and our brother Neville of course as I said he Pastors in Ontario and he Pastors in Washington so God is using our brother so amazing isn't it God maybe take an American or Canadian and send them to Africa you take an African and send them to America amen because because we need it amen so to God be the glory see it's it's God's plan it's God's purpose God predestinated it see again like brother brother Barry coffee said he said when he was here last time I ministered he said listen he said every area and everything in your life is predestinated so it's important to find the will of God stay in the will of God Walk In The Light so so it's going to manifest the predestinated will of God Amen as uh we trust that they believe and feel that and that we believe it and feel that that it was the will of God for for those that are here to be here amen and I I believe it's was the will of God for others to be here but they're not here amen so remember you can go to hell for what you didn't do not because of what you did amen what you didn't do and as much as you've done it unto the least of my brethren you've done it to me and Jesus said as much you didn't do it you didn't do it to me amen so God help us that we'll respect and honor and reverence one another in the fear of God and thank God for salvation thank God for Redemption thank God for yes justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the new bir amen the prophet did say before the seals that all you had to do is repent and be baptized you're born again but he said oh he said and after the seals he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth amen it is you're born again is God receiving your faith coming into your heart driving the devil's influence out and putting the influence of the word in the Holy Ghost again it's Christ that liveth in you and in me so does your life reflect Christ amen does your attitude reflect Christ does your words reflect Christ amen amen your spirit your motives your objectives God help us amen so the Lord bless us and again God bless our brother John from Ontario and our brother uh Columbo and his family go they just are not long back from from Israel our brother brought me the tie amen so uh so I thank the Lord for that it brings to remembrance things that we saw in Israel amen with our brother George and our brother Ruben finklestein is still the tour guide and he's but 82 I believe 82 years old amen so God and and not only that it's only this morning that I received an email from Brother Ruben so he calls me brother I call him brother amen so God bless our our brothers and sisters in Israel understand this we know it now that God is leaving us and going back to the Jews but brother I press I trust by Grace we got the faith that pleases God and what is the faith that pleases God now Resurrection rapturing Faith amen that's why God did what he did because we needed it to get it to get resurrection and rapturing Faith praise the Lord we're we're on our way on not going going to happen it's already happening amen it's cut you out of that into the word and the word is catching you up amen praise the name of the Lord so let's stand and we're going to sing only believe and turn to our brother Neville amen and pray the grace of God to anoint our brother to bring forth the Revelation that you need the Revelation that I need the Revelation that they might need online amen also to to bring greetings from our brother Clarence stri in uh just near botwood there in central newf L uh he called asking us to remember him in prayer he is he is 80 years old now so but we've known each other for 50 years or more and so we pray the grace of God his brother Clarence he's having trouble with his back he did have hip replacement surgery he may have to have more surgery so he is to see the doctor I believe on Tuesday and of this coming week or Thursday so he said I want us to remember me in prayer Amen brother Clarence stride so God bless the Saints amen give God the glory amen I pray that there will be a confirmation that the blood is applied to your life because you're going to receive the word the life of the blood amen To God Be The Glory Hallelujah let's sing only believe and we'll turn it to our brother Neville amen welcome our brother Neville thank God for brother to brother Colo for for arranging it and bring bringing the Brethren it's good amen we need it you know the B the Bible the Bible tells us you know to to get together and fellowship one another and it says much more as you see the day approaching or brother it's it's here look and what God said this is going to happen that's going to happen that's going to happen and what now he said when that happens look up but there's a lot of Believers not looking up no no they're still looking to Doctrine amen or they're still maybe into into this message or that message brother Billy Paul brother Billy Paul said take the message Mage and put it in the word amen he said don't take the message around just the message only no he said put it into the word and and he said preach the word by the grace of God so brother sister I pray Grace that we will not let that Spirit get on us so that we're just caught up with the with the mechanics but not the Dynamics the prophet of God saw that before he left he said he knew that he said there's more mechanics there is Dynamics but we're he we need the Dynamics to get into Rapture that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost revealing the faith that pleases us that we need to get out of time and into eternity God help us by Grace amen God bless brother NE [Music] only [Music] only all things are possible only Bey be [Music] ho all things are [Music] possible let's believe Jesus is here [Music] Jesus Hallelujah all [Music] areus is [Music] here here [Music] all things [Music] are Jesus is here Lord I God bless you my brother [Music] amen take the liberty of the

Jesus and make himself known unto us Lord we depend on you Hallelujah hallelu you know what's in our hearts Lord meet our needs oh God this morning am oh that's what we came for bless each one of us yes Jesus we ask we ask you this morning oh God to forgive all our shortcomings our mistakes amen may you wash Us by your blood which is the message of the hour sanctify us oh God L we need and we

those who are online father we ask that the service and all the blessing got to them as well amen Lord we thank you we commit everything into your hands in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray Lord amen hallelujah you may have your seats amen God bless you and it's such a privilege to be before you this morning amen and it has been a while it was in my heart to come and visit you because I heard so many good things about you from my brother gas Colo and I think it's true and I really enjoyed the Adoration the worship the way you sing really wonderful Hallelujah so keep it up L amen keep it up so my name is brother ne ne kiso and kisu means work that's in KES uh language uh what should I tell you about myself so I'm a father the Lord and I have a wife and we have five children praise the Lord four girls and one boy they've almost grown up so the youngest she's 16 tamama and the oldest she's 26 so pray for us and what I do I'm a scientist you you you'll have an idea maybe when we get toward the end of the service why I'm telling you I'm a scientist amen amen amen I don't believe people because people tend to think especially those who criticize brother Bram they think people who believe in brother the brandham because they didn't go to school but that's a mistake that's right amen amen amen I'm a doctor I did my PhD so I moved from the Congo came to the states I went to school in California I did microbiology immunology and molecular genetics right now I'm working for the federal government in the US the Department of Health and Human Services I'm doing research because I really want to find a cure for malaria and by God's grace I was able I think I made an invention hallelujah amen I now have an antibody I'm still working on it perfecting it so let's say you want to go to visit Africa or any endemic regions from maler they can give you just one shot and you can be there for 3 6 month for a year you don't have to care to to worry you don't have to take the pills because I was thinking for years what can we do for malaria I used to suffer with malaria twice in the Congo when I was young maybe twice a month I used to say someday if they have a vaccine I'll be the first one to have it amen so I didn't know how the Lord led me I went to the states completed my Studies by anywhere I was thinking to do some something else it didn't work out and I came back to malaria now the Lord has used me to help something that could help people amen so we bless His holy name amen so when I speak to you this morning I'll I'll be speaking to you about the prophets when I speak to you about the prophet it doesn't mean that we are nothing in this life that's why we came to the prophet no amen that's right we went to school I got the highest degree they can confer you in the states I know what I'm talking about God has made himself known to me through this message hallelujah amen amen so I believe everybody who follow us this morning even those who are online you will understand what's my position is this morning amen so thank you for your patience again my name is brother nille I have two small churches I'm pastoring one in the Washington DC area in the states and the other one in Otawa Ontario as Pastor jald said and I came with brother jeanclaude he's one of our brothers in the church and we came brother Columbo said it's my 60 years anniversary and he wanted us to come and spend that time with him and I said that that's a a great opportunity so I can come and see all of you because I heard so much good things about you these are true that's true amen so pray for me this morning as we Minister I truly like what the prophet said it won't be our brother let it be the Lord Jesus Christ because there is nothing good in me there is nothing that I can do to help you all of us we need the Lord Jesus Christ to help us this amen amen amen and we'll be having special meetings I invited the pastor last night we had such a wonderful Fellowship you know what's great about this message when you meet each other even though in this life you haven't met before but the first time you meet you can see that you can connect perfectly so we got connected so well with the pastor and the prophet say it only only takes one minute to know if someone has the holy spirit amen it doesn't have to take a sermon just one sentence they can tell you you can feel you can sense that person has got the thing so I believe the pastor here has got has got it he has the holy spirit amen so thank you Pastor we'll be having H special meetings in all in two weeks from now so from Friday June the 14th through June the 16th so those who can come you are the most welcome and I really wanted brother Gerald to come but he said he cannot make it but I was praying I said Lord that's what he said I'll keep praying am amen I'll keep praying if he can make it that will be perfect and wonderful am so thank you so much and remember as you in your prayers we really need your help this work this is the hardest work it is on this Earth ministering for the body of the Lord amen it's very hard it requires so many sacrifices but if that's what the Lord want us here we are Lord use us amen use us Lord so this morning I want to greet both our churches they follow us and many Believers in the US who follow us I not this morning they are connected amen we greet you this morning in the wonderful name of the Lord the presence of the Lord is here this morning amen and we wait upon Him amen shall we stand as we open our Bible to 1 Samuel chapter 8 as I told you I really want to speak on the prophets can we say amen amen and the pro the Pastor T me have the Liberty yes amen amen amen and I know you believe the prophet amen can we say amen amen because the prophet is our absolute do you believe it amen thank you 1 Samuel chapter 8 and it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons Jud judges over Israel now the name of his first born was Joel and the name of his second ABA there were judges in BBA and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside at luck and took brides and perverted judgment amen then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel andto Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in the ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations listen what they ask for we want to be like the rest of the people so they knew knew we weren't as the rest of the people we are a separated group of people am now they want to be like the rest of the people but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel listen what the Lord says hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected the who was Samuel the prophet of God amen amen God is telling him they are not rejecting thee but they have rejected me that I should not reain over them when you reject the prophet you reject God that's right amen according to all the works which they have done since the the day that I brought them out of Egypt even unto this day where with they have forsaken me and served other the gods so do they also unto thee amen so be careful when you deal with a prophet we need a revelation when we see a prophet what does it mean amen who a prophet is yes I'll jump let's go toward the end of the chapter the prophet told them this is what will happen when you have your king they said no we want a king that would lead us to the war but you remember they got their King they had saw remember that there was a war they said give us a king that will lead us to war there was a war Goliath was there but the king could not lead them to war amen amen verse 19 nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles when the battle came up the king could not go and fight for them amen we need a prophet amen amen shall we pray father help us this morning amen Lord Lord we count on you thank you for all you have done for us in this day you took one of us a son of man you send us a prophet messenger Amen to bring us back to you oh Lord we cannot exchange it with any other thing amen that's a great treasure so this morning may you reveal unto us oh God your words because we wait upon the bless your children bless each one of us in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seat and let's read again so pray for me I really need your help amen I was reading one of one of the reformers I think it was span he said if you took out Mr Emon from the church you'll have a dead adoration a dead worship amen amen so keep Mr amen here amen let's read second Peter chapter 2 second Peter chapter 2 verse 20 and 21st knowing this that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation amen for the prophecy now listen the prophecy came not in all time by the will of men but holy men of men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so the prophet were speaking as they were moved by the holy spirit so it means it's not the prophet who speaking it's the holy spirit it's the great God who is speaking and let's finish with Hebrews 138 any message Believers remember that scripture amen that's right I'll begin at verse 7 Hebrew 13 remember them which have the rule over you remember them remember in Mal malach 4 it says remember the law of Moses we will get there here our Father Peter says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God who Faith follow considering the end of the conversation Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] amen amen he hasn't changed butam says God doesn't change his nature that's right he can change his form right but regarding his nature he's the same when he's acting you will remember it's always God because we'll act always the same way amen amen the prophets we will go from one Court to another Court one scripture from another scripture I was praying the Lord I was I was asking to the Lord I told him Lord I want you this morning to remember where we are take us from this Earth and bring us into your presence amen that's we will forget that we are here amen amen amen that's right brother Bram says in the exposition of the seven Church ages chapter 10 he says this listen to me this age started just after the turn of the 20th century Leia as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost it is in our time the church needs to be the CH bride the same bride the same church the head at the Pentecost that's right am what a Time amen the church need to understand where are we at what time are we living here we need to understand what must be our position this is the time the church needs to go back what the church used to be at Pentecost and that's why the prophet came Malachi for to take us bring us back to the Pentecost [Music] amen we know that there must be no necessity be a return of dynamic power that's right that's right what a time that's why in our church I took almost a year teaching on the church I was talking to the pastor yesterday people the church need to understand what's Church you remember brother Brandon preached a message five definite identifications of the true amen Church in that message he asked five questions he dealt with five questions the first one was what's the church because sometimes we think the church it is this building in part yes but we need also to see the other facet it means the body of Christ Church means the kingdom of God God is ruling over you you become his prisoner amen so we went through that we haven't finished yet we have we just turning around because the prophet how many time I can't the prophet pronounce this word church I don't if it 30,000 time or something like that the prophets but before I get there I want to greet you with something in the message humble thyself humble thyself paragraph 77 you know people want Power Church listen that's to you m Jesus people want power and really they don't know what power is the way up is now amen always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power am remember that evening light Tabernacle the prophet says you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy amen a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it am amen that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise just wait upon the Lord as a church be like Rebecca listening towards El is telling her this is what Isaac likes this is what your God likes be quiet amen and in question is answers question and answers number four 197 brother Bram says this look at all of us that took our vows and marched around the altar we seen them come and go one from the other have you noticed those who stayed with the message how they went watch people who stayed with the message as they live this world what we call death brother Bram said have you noticed have you been ever been near someone who has been the message when they are passing away How Sweet It Is amen now he's asking now think of the ones who got away from the message how they went think of it that's why be merciful if you have a good church like the one you have here especially the men of God you have here amen the pastor be very grateful to the Lord people of God God doesn't not care about the number how many you are in your church how many got saved in the day of Noah how many eight people only one family how many people were on Earth in that day Jesus said as it was in the day of Noah so shall it will it be in the coming of the son of man there were so many people like today how many got saved just eight people God doesn't care about how many you are but if you have a man of God that keep you in the word of God be merciful church amen and that's why the prophet says in the exposition of the seven Church age chapter 5 I'll go right straight to that brother say the last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is the end time now as all know this is the end time as all know for Israel is in the Homeland at any time now he will come according to Malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the world he will be in indicated pointed out in the words Revelation 10:7 and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did Elijah yes and be ready for Mount Zion Showdown right now listen many will misunderstand him even his own Believers in this message many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth church when he comes against that they will not believe amen that's why brother Ram said we need a strip down we really need to empty ourselves now listen even true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers even through ministers you'll see a great Pastor he misunderstands the prophet messenger amen that's why pray for your pastor that's why I pray for your minister because brother Bram says there there is something important where you go to church amen am what they teach you in that church and who teaches you it's really important because brother says that the church is like a boat that will take you to your final destination and the captain of that boat it's really important to have a good Captain who knows where you go amen amen amen so pray for your pastor because in the end time evangelism paragraph 143 brother Bram says and it's always it's always friends the leaders each time through the change of this dispensation has got the people all messed up yeah amen the ministers these are the guys that always mess up things that's why people get in confusion that's it hasn't been so much the people if the gospel would have stayed in the Pulpit where it belongs now you see because the pulit is weak that's why we see even in message churches things don't go very well because the pulpit is so weak it's the leaders it is the preachers yes amen that are confusing people but the promise said my people shall not be in confusion that's right am pray for your pastor again about your pastor Ephesian CH that message brother Bram preached paragraph 135 brother Bram was reading the scripture in the Revelation I think chapter 2 verse four and four and five he it says remember therefore from on that have fallen now he gives the interpretation because as we'll see this morning the prophet is God's interpreter of his word can we say amen Amen brother 136 paragraph he said all the words if you got a god-filled pastor like the one you have here filled with the Holy Ghost and you try to hold him under your finger and say well if he says anything about us having a robbed qu if he says anything about about us wearing makeup we will just excommunicate him so you threaten your pastor brother Bram says don't you worry God will do it before you get a chance to amen don't worry he'll go out and preach to stones on the street before he had compromise with that kind of stuff because the true servant of God cannot compromise with the TRU amen if you kick me out God will take me amen you got a pastor that's really tells you the truth you ought to honor God and stay in the spirit and worship God realizing that you are going to be lost if you don't see that's why I'm telling you pray for your pastor you need to worship God and I believe you truly worship God in this church amen amen but people live today like this is the only thing there was you see people everything they do is to go to work come back home they have two three jobs they forgot going to church they think the only life is this one you don't realize you got a s that's going to live here and go somewhere that's true that's right brothers and sister we are going somewhere amen and when you go somewhere what do you do you make reserv at the hotel where you are going to stay we are going somewhere we better make our reservations amen and you seal your destination right here the way you live and the way you do out holding grudges and mean and everything and then run to church on Sunday morning the Prophet said oh mercy shame on you amen amen you see people the way we live now it's like this is the only life we don't care about God look at people as soon as you wake up your hands are on your cell phone you want to see what messages you have received even Christians Believers in this message we don't start our day dedicating Our Lives to God the first thing you wake up I tell you brothers and sister the cell phone that invention came to distract the bride amen it didn't come from for people in the world it came to distract you yes always tell my church my wife can testify if she were here the first thing I do in morning anyway when I sleep I sleep on my bed usually I have back in the morning when I wake up usually I sleep in my office right on the floor when I sleep on the floor I feel better and it gives me opportunity when I wake up at night listening to the voice of God in this last day and you can feel the presence of God in my D room amen and I can go into prayer I don't know why when I'm sleeping by my wife on the bed she sleep she's she's very comfortable in on her bed and I ask him do you have back no I don't have back but why every time I'm sleeping on that bed on that mattress I have back I need to sleep on the floor in my office I just lay down there uh we have the carpet but I put a little bit uh a blanket that's where I lay down listen to The Prophet at sometime I can pray I can pray but if it happened I was sleeping with her when when I wake up in the morning I wake up with my knees I don't like my foot to touch the the the floor first first thing I like sleeping over the bed and I fall down like this hallelujah amen I commit my life to God read my Bible and then I can see if I have a message maybe a Believer needs some help but what we do with Believers today first thing set phone because the devil knew the prophet spoke about television the prophet is no more there now I need to go with something they will not detect it it will take their full attention remember what Elisha he asked something to Elijah you remember what he asked for give me a double portion that's right amen what you have what Elijah told him you have asked very difficult hard thing but let me tell you you'll have it if you see me going if focus on me your focus on me amen don't be distracted focus on me you'll get a double portion of what I had brother says he Lash represent the bride pay attention to what Malachi 4 did focus on that you will get a double portion you'll be feasting in your bedroom amen Jehovah jar paragraph n after all you are just six foot of ground this is that serve the Lord by his Prophet you are what can you repeat for me you are what 6 I'm 6t tall you are 6 ft of ground I was standing by big at Museum here some time ago I love Arts music and in this Museum there was was two young fellows looking at analysis of a human body of a man that weighed 150b you know how much you are worth if you weigh 150 you worth 84 cents amen that's the value of your body can we say amen amen that's why if you fall down here we take you we bring you to the cemetery nobody wants to stay with you there because you are only off 84 cents let's say you are walking on the street and you see a bill of a dollar are you going to get down and take it if you take it the first question will be who's this dollar because it has no value but imagine you are working in downtown so many many people and you lose $100 it's unlikely you'll hear somebody asking I found $100 who whose $100 is this one you are worth 84 cents that's what your body is why should I care for 40 84 cents why should have waste my time day after days you don't show up to church am you go from walk to that one you go from this place to that place at the end of the day 84 cents nobody want to stay with you at the sem amen even your wife used to call you dear honey or your wife used to call honey your children who used to love you you go to the cemetery they lay you down there that's it everybody goes back home can we say amen amen that's why I love Malachi 4 amen the words that came out of his mouth these are words of knowledge words of wisdom words of life that's right amen hallelujah he says you got enough white wash about you to sprinkle a hand's Nest just a little bit of and so forth Just worth 84 think of it sister putting $1,000 mean c on nose turn up if it will Rin you'll drone and thinking you are somebody when you are only worth 84 cents amen that boy that boy over there said one looked over and said John we are not very much after all are we I thought this was my chance the prophet said now I want to speak to these two young fellows I tapped him on the back I said that's truly boys but you got a soul that's worth 10,000 wordss amise Lord you s that you neglect is worth 10,000 wordss amen how worth is just one world this world how much money who knows you you all you all went to school right how worth is this only world that we have even myself I don't know how much but it's billion trillions you cannot buy it nobody has the money to buy just one word now the prophet comes and tells us your soul is worth 10,000 words think of it amen that's right take care of that Soul amen take care of your soul let the 84 cents go watch that soul for it will live forever and he says that's true friends amise the Lord that's why the prophet said Christ is the mystery of God revealed and now you have got Types on that you've got Types on what we believe can we say Amen because as a church we need to know what we believe in we need to understand what the teaching of our church what are our doctrines in this message and the prophet says here you've got the tpes on what we believe you've got the tpes on discipline in the church how we behave ourself in the Church of God that's why I was telling you we have already taken a year just to to teach on the church how you behave in the church how we got to come here together and see together in Heavenly places how do you go to church amen what condition you need to be in when you go to church amen it's in the message don't stay home can we say Amen don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out y to get him here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray amen amen if you don't feel the pressure and the church today is Wednesday if you have your church on Wednesday today is Sunday I need to run and go to church dedicate my life take care of my soul amen because it worth 10,000 WS if you don't have that feeling the prophet advise you start praying something is wrong with you and to finish with my [Music] greeting perseverance paragraph 8 so be in prayer can we say amen amen what whatever you do just look up today and pray pray that's all that's the only hope that we have is prayer amen when I see the life of brother branam lately during our Wednesday prayer meetings we took the whole Bible from the beginning you all see God people they like worshiping God they like praying am we took Abraham as soon as God revealed himself unto Abraham the Bible said he built an altar amen so he can give himself a sacrifice on that altar that's right amen amen Elijah the prophet when he came the first time the first thing he did is to restore the altar do you remember that in the Bible Jesus his life was prayer brother bram's life he said the success of my Ministry is the time I stand in prayer with God Amen because that's the only hope that we have is prayer amen amen and with that now let's get started with the prophets in the message I will rece St follow me carefully nowadays a lot of things going on it seems the church has lost its identification it seems in this message we don't really grasp the Revelation who a prophet is and that's why you see people everybody can come on and they post things even on the internet anything they can put there and the BR is reading all this our foolishness excuse me but to me that's foolishness amen I will restore paragraph 58 now there is a difference between prophecy a gift of of Prophecy and a prophet can we say amen amen right it will be hard for me to finish talking about the prophet in just one service because it's a whole teaching right but pray for me so I can add one more Stone to build this body of Christ amen did you know that there is a difference in between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet and there is where you brethren in the L went off now if a brother came from the L church when he hears it it must be the grace of God otherwise he'll say William brandham is a false prophet why because he's attacking his Doctrine amen but the prophet is Right somebody make a prophecy and you call them a prophet that's wrong can we say amen amen amen the next time you've seen an nrow usually these people that profess that's one of one of the gifts in the body that's right amen and the prophet said it can go from one person to another person you can prophesy today and that's it for the rest of your life it can be like that and usually if you don't watch over the prophecies in the church you will see errors will be coming through this gifts that's why the prophet said that's why the fivefold Ministries there to watch over these gifts am but today what we see people can even leave a church they say they don't want my gifts it's not your gifts that's right it's God's gift but the operation need to be in the order in Perfect Harmony to what the prophet told us somebody make a prophecy and you call a prophet that's wrong the next time you've seen an error a gift of Prophecy and a prophet different right the gift of Prophecy and the prophets these are two different things God in s times spoke to the fathers to the prophets these last days through his son Jesus Christ a gift of Prophecy is in the body do you get me and two or three has to say before it to see to be judged when it's spoken amen when a brother or sister gives a prophecy in the church it needs to go before two or three judges right they need to tell us whether it's true or false because God doesn't lie and the prophet gives an example let's say you need you live near the railroad we come to church that's why I keep telling the Believers you need to get to church on time the prophet said before the service begins already be there praying I was telling people do you believe God has taken away the gifts from the church no the gifts are still there but the way we behave when you come to church the service has already started how can you speak in tongue because the tongues and the prophecies the prophet say they happened before the service begins now when you come after the service has begun how can you speak in tongue and be in order with God's word hallelujah the gifts are still there but we don't understand how to take care of them amen amen you give a prophecy brother you live by the ra railroad tomorrow take your family out because at 2: p.m. a train there will be a wre a trend crash leave your home with your family at 2: p.m. something will happen you bring your prophecy to the judges there will be two or three the judges would look at it God will give them the wisdom can we say Amen am they will have the wi wisdom to tell okay this is from God this is not from God because as I said in these prophecies maybe I have something against you amen and we come to church and I give a prophecy against you because I have something against you if that's the case the judge must say no we know this brother has an issue with that brother or that sister has an issue with the sister he says this probably because of the issue Brother come on you need to fix it we won't accept this prophecy this time can we say amen amen if it comes from God tomorrow if it were me I'll take my family maybe go on top of the mountains are see around the islands honey let's go far away at 2: p.m. we must see a train coming and stuck down my home when you see it happen brother Bram says God is with you amen because God cannot lie if it doesn't happen what you do you call the person who gave the prophecy and the judges they bring them in front here the pastor lay his hands on them to cast out all these evil spirits am that's what the prophet says here when they give a prophecy it must be brought in front of the church it must be brought in front of two or three before it's given to the church but you've never seen nobody stand before Moses Isaiah Jeremiah have you seen people coming to Moses say oh I want to judge your prophecy what you said it doesn't happen you cannot judge a prophet that's why the prophet says there is a difference between the gift of Prophecy and a prophet K tried to stand before Moses one day you remember what happened when K stood before Moses what happened not only he died but even his family innocent people family members because that sin against God's prophets it took all everybody in the family so you need to be very careful be very careful daddy mommy be very careful because your action can ruin the entire family K tried to stand before Moses one day and the word swallowed him or the Earth swallowed him up see but a prophet is born it's election amen all through life it's the word of the Lord just as it comes to them brother Bram said the same thing I'll jump to the message after the one that that was about to appear on the screen let's go to joah jar I'm repeating this I'm laying out a foundation for what I want to say Amen now there is a difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet one is a gift of Prophecy and the other one is a prophet a gift of Prophecy must be judged by two or three spiritual men it can come upon one person to night be on another person tomorrow night and on another one the next night am what it is is a gift in every local body a church but a prophet is different they are born prophets amen and they come up prophets all that they say must be true amen amen you didn't say Amen amen amen everything a prophet says must be the true every time and it cannot be recognized as a prophet in the office if it's not true then it's not the prophet of God in the revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 212 I'm going what in red a prophet is the word amen can we say amen amen we know that the word Prophet means a Divine Divine interpreter of the word it's him who tells you yes this is what it means amen listen friends I'll give you an example do you remember Joseph brother Bram said Joseph was a prophet can we say amen amen amen Joseph was in Egypt and the king of Egypt Pharaoh he had a dream he saw seven fat C CES or cows he also saw seven skinny cows and the skinny cows ate the fat cows now Pharaoh he didn't know what it meant it was like a prophecy amen and Joseph came he was God's interpreter God's revealer of the word of God he came he told Pharaoh what did you see oh I saw seven skinny cows eating seven fat cows I'm trouble what does it mean Joseph told him oh what you saw it's not cows do you remember that I know you saw cows but I know what it means these are seven years of abundance they will be eaten up by seven years of nothing now if you were there there is nothing written about it who would you have believed Joseph was there he told Pharaoh what you saw this is what it means it's not seven cows God was speaking to you by symbols but as a prophet I tell you what you saw seven years of abundance and seven seven years of emptiness we have nothing so be prepared and because Pharaoh believed what the prophet told him he prospered that's right amen amen amen amen you remember King nebuchad with Daniel the king dreamed the dream he forgot what he saw and the Prophet Daniel came he told him I see what you dream no brother Bram said many people brought to me their dreams and they would not tell me everything the dream they will tell Prophet The Prophet brother this is what I dreamed I dream this this would look at them and tell them you didn't tell me everything this is what you left off this is what you left off this is what you left off that serve the Lord this is what your dream means you can go in peace exactly as it happened with Daniel the king said I forgot what I have dreamed first tell me what I have dreamed and then I will know that the interpretation is right is correct oh King what you ask nobody can do that except the gods whose dwelling are not among the son of man this is what the magician said back there in Babylon they will judge you people of this age they will tell you we wanted somebody like that in our day how come God sent you one and you missed him Daniel said oh King I see I see a big tree and I see verett coming make their nest upon the tree oh that tree oh King it's you like in Genesis the tree of life it's aen can we say Amen Daniel told him that tree it's you oh King it was not written anywhere but when the king accepted what the prophet told him he prospered can we say Amen am let me repeat that quotation a prophet is the word we know that the word Prophet means a div Divine interpreter of the word the div Divine word is written and the prophets has the Divine spirit of God within him and you know the prophet in the Old Testament was called God how many knew that that's why in the unpon unpardonable sin 123 brother Bram says this if you need these quotations I left them with brother M you can get them from from him sin Let Me begin 1:22 I had a place I wanted you to show to show you the first place of this scof here what he wrote in a footnote here I believe it's found in Romans the thir chapter he said here as he interpreted it through Webster of course in footnote he said sin is rejecting the revealed will of God Amen sin is rejecting the revealed will of God 12 123 sin in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of God or will of God when God has revealed something as his will and to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject God can we say Amen exactly what we read in 1 Samuel chapter 8 they rejected the will of God that was to be led by a prophet and by doing so they blasphemed amen let me repeat that sin in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of God or will of God when God has revealed something as his will and to to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject God how many blasphemers we have in this message let's go to Exodus chapter 18 brother M yeah it's there you remember the children of Israel they come out of Egypt they were going to the promised land they were in the wilderness and they met Jetro Moses father-in-law when Jetro the priest of Midian Moses father-in-law heard of all that God has done for Moses and for Israel his people and that the Lord has brought Israel out of Egypt then Jetro Moses father-in-law took zipora Moses wife after he had sent her back and her two sons of which the name of the one was gam for he said I have been an alen in a Strange Land and the name of the other was elzar for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from The Sword of pharaoh and Jetro Moses father-in-law came with his sons and his wife unto MOS Moses Into the Wilderness where he encamped at the M of God and he said unto Moses I thy father-in-law Jetro I'm come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her so go quickly let's go toward the end now Jetro meets with Moses now listen verse 14 Jetro was with his son-in-law Moses he saw what's going on with Moses with the people people coming before Moses from the morning through the evening a long line waiting to he from Moses verse 14 and when Moses father-in-law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even why the people they came since the morning they stand by you since the morning until until the evening now here how Moses answers are you following me and Moses said unto his father-in-law listen because the people come unto me to inquire of God let me repeat that before because the people come unto me to inquire of God if they want God they come ask me what they must do can we say Amen remember there is a promise Malachi 4 remember Moses my servants what happened with Moses Moses told us when people they want to inquire for God they want some advice how to find God they come to meet the prophets when they have a matter they come unto me and I judge between one and another and I do make know them know the statutes of God and his laws I'm the one who tells them what God has said I have God's laws for them they have to listen to me that's why you see them they come to me since the morning un evening they come to listen what the Lord has said can we say amen I read a script scripture Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I told you God doesn't change his nature he can change his form what kind of men he's using in that age but he stays the same can we say amen amen in the message what a vision Vision I'm not comparing myself with a prophet no sir I'm just a poor sinner Saed by Grace but the gift that the lord gave the prophets and made them prophets they were God's mouth peace amen amen a prophet is God's mou peace when he's speaking God is speaking to you you receive what the prophet says you receive What God Says remember first Samuel chapter 8 God told Samu they are not rejecting you because you didn't go to them by yourself I'm the one who sent you they are rejecting me am when you see somebody he's rejecting the prophet he's rejecting God our radio something which is really good the prophet heard the word of the Lord and no Prophet ever did do anything just upon his own desire he if he did it first it was after God had taugh him amen can we say amen God keeps his word but because they failed to hear Moses you remember children of Israel all the time Moses why did you do this Moses why you did this Moses why you remember even one time he's the one who came with the law children of Israel your God said you cannot get married to another people you remember that it was a law on the next day God told him oh you need to take a wife not from the children of Israel we need to go to the nations take an Egyptian as your wife he could only obey he went and took zipora you remember in the Bible even his brother Aaron who was a a priest a minister amen he wasn't happy Miriam the big sister he thought I am your big sister I was born before you I'm the one who put you on the river so you won't die what happened you told us the Lord told you don't go outside to take a wife now you are you are breaking the law yourself was God happy was God happy God came down he told them don't you fear God there is no Prophet like Moses I speak to him mouth to ear I've never done it before why you didn't fear God because of that the lack of respect amen humanly speaking they were right isn't it humanly speaking Aaron and Miriam they were right but it wasn't right before God because God is the one who told Moses go out take a wife there because you represent Jesus Christ he will have a bride of Nations am you are a type of Christ they didn't see it they were leaning on their own understanding and that's how they got out of the will of God brother Bram say the message trying to do God the service there are five mon five mon to do God the service it must be according to the time in the season Accord with the person God has sent and that's the prophet if you do something which is outside of what the prophet told us you are out of the will of God let me follow I'll go quickly so we can finish Luke 7 verse 12 you can go down brother Matthew it's down there a Prophet is the grace of God Amen that's right when you see a prophet that means the grace of God Has Come to Us amen go through the entire Bible you will see see every time God sent Moses to Israel it was Grace for them they had light amen those who refused them they were under judgment Luke 712 it was the Lord Jesus Christ the prophet said he never attended a funeral service the Lord Jesus never attended a funeral service name me one in the Bible there is none every time you went to the funeral it was over it was the end of your funeral they made a mistake he was somewhere and they were going to bury somebody but they want to bring life and death together it doesn't work now when he came n to the gate of the city behold the was was the dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not this is the good way you took don't weep what will happen Hallelujah and he came and touch the beer he didn't scream as we scream and that that bear him Stood Still or we are the presence of Life stand still and he said young man I say unto thee I who created Thee I say unto thee arise Lord and He that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother now verse 16 and there came a fear or no why would you Fe when you meet with somebody who raising up your day why would you fear why you cannot Rejoice be excited thank God they had fear but and they glorify God saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that God has visited his people when you see a prophet that means God has visited his people how would you reject God's visitation I don't understand let's go to Exodus chapter 3 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Nidia and he led the flock of the to The Backs side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb where which mountain hor remember the law of Moses which I have given him it's or that's the promise of Malachi 4 let's go back to hor what happened in horb I want to take my time so we can read the entire chapter and get into chapter 4 you will understand what Malachi 4 is about and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see the great sight why the bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called him out of the midst of the Bush Pillar of Fire somebody was in that Pillar of Fire now we'll start talking you just see a pill of fire on the head of brother but that's that's a person what is it shame on me ah thank you you see you need somebody to reveal you the truth you need somebody to show you the light especially in this time message Revelation book of symbols we only have symbols there so we need a prophet to give us the true interpretation this fire says as you see there it's a person that's why Bram called this picture it's not my picture it's the picture of the Angel of the Lord I was just standing there when they took the picture can we say Amen Moses said I'll turn aside verse three and see the great sight why the bush is not burn and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush God was speaking God the Bible says God the prophet thought that it was the pillar of fire amen it is God and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh he put off thy shoes for from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father now he's revealing himself to Moses what means this Pillar of Fire I am the god of D father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God Amen Moses will ask you I saw exactly what you saw in your time what did I said in my book of Exodus it was God how come you forgot verse seven and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people I have seen now God is talking I've seen the Affliction of my people which is which are in Egypt and have heard their cry God hears the Cry of his people that's why I keep telling the Believers we need to to tell God what we need because he hears he listen I have heard the Cry of my people by reason of the task Masters for I know their sorrows and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians listen the convers between God and His prophets he said I have seen what's going on that's why I came down myself I'll do the job but read the book of Exodus you will never see God going before Pharaoh I want my people to go out he went veiled in His prophets Pharaoh refused to do what the prophet was telling him he was condemned amen I have come down to deliver them remember we are in another Exodus this is the Third Exodus the same situation will happen because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever prise the Lord amen amen and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians op press them come now therefore now the music changes myself I have come down to deliver them now he tells His prophets now come therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh I will deliver them I will be in you they won't see me amen I'll be veiled in the flesh only the elect will get the Revelation come now therefore and I will send you unto Pharaoh remember my law in hor that's what Malachi 4 that promise says I I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt now two people will take them out God first said I have come down to take them out of the land of Egypt now he tell His prophets now I have come I'm calling you now you go before Pharaoh it's you you will take them out of the land of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt who am I Lord and Moses and he said certainly God said certainly I will be with thee amen that's what the secret was I send thee I'll be not even with thee but in thee am and this shall be a talken unto thee that I have sent thee to believe that it's me who have sent thee when th has brought forth the people out of Egypt He Shall Serve God Upon This Mountain remember one day to confirm that it's me you will see you will come back by this way and you'll serve God on this mountain God is commissioning his Prophet 13 Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers had sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them now Moses God is instructing His prophets the prophet is asking question okay I'm okay to go I don't want to go but in case I go they'll ask me what our fathers God's name listen verse 14 and God said unto Moses my name is I am that I am can we say Amen you know when Jesus came he was telling them I am who I am the same God that met Moses was standing before the children of Israel they could not recognize him and the prophet say the same way the gospel went from Israel into to the Nations we will bring them back the gospel because we have also rejected God manifested today in the flesh amen I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you and God said more of Unto Moses thou th shall thou say unto the of Israel the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob had sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my Memorial unto all generations go now God is commissioning him now go and gather the Elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me remember he was alone no church was with him you you only have to believe him by faith amen you only have to give to have confidence in him or that's it for you you will tell Pharaoh saying this I have surely visited you I have visited you because there is a prophet in the land and seen that which is done to you in Egypt and I have said I'll bring you up out of the Affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the hites and the amorites and the parasites and the hites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey and they shall hearken unto thy voice the voice of the son I love that voice amen I love that voice they will hearken unto thy voice Moses you'll be speaking it won't be your voice it will be my voice it will resonate in their hearts amen because a man cannot speak like and thou shal Come Thou and the Elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto him the Lord God of Hebrews had met with us and now let us go we beseech the three days journey into the Wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord Our God see what the prophet came for to take them out so they can serve their God Amen in my teaching of the church I mentioned earlier that the said Church means called out people that have been called out for what to sacrifice to serve our God that's what the Third Exodus is about come out of all the system of the denominations get into the bride serve our God 19 and I'm sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand God knew and I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I do in the midst of in the midst thereof and after that will let you go did you see God coming down and smiting Egypt with Mighty Works did you see him he came down he say I want to create flies it was Moses that was doing it but God and His Prophet they were so in harmony God was working his Prophet now he's speaking at uh what do we call it first personal pronoun I I I but we see when things are being fulfilled it's no more I it's he the prophet who was doing it's he the prophet who was doing amen verse 21 and I'll give these people favor in the sight of the Egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and of her that soet in her house jewels of of silver and jewels of gold and remens and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and he shall spoil the Egyptians you see even the first the first calling out it was a family affair amen you see the last verse we we read take things put your children put them on your son put them on your daughters and go out all of you I want all of you to go out and serve God I don't want Daddy is praying in the bedroom and kids are praying playing video games here that's not a Christian home Mommy is praying there dad is somewhere else doing I don't know what chapter 4 remember hor that's what Malachi said chapter 4 God is still talking to his prophets and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord had not appeared unto thee that's true they won't believe me how come I just go and tell them God met me and then they believe me they won't we need something more and the Lord said unto him what is in thine hand now God want to commission him more and he said AR you know brother said a rod means a Ministry can we say Amen a Ministry a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it God is training his Prophet so a snake he fled God said hold on hold on calm down and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tear oh my goodness he fled just to see the snake he fled now God is telling him take it by the the te God he'll turn around and bite me but obedience he said Lord since it's you who said it I'll take it by the tail maybe he came God said no move on move on move on the tail was there take it by the taar he took it what happened and it became a rod in his hand amen from God this is God who speaking to me nobody can do this because you need to go through an experience you won't forget amen when you meet God the prophet said it's an experience you won't forget nobody can take you out of that we can have so many impersonators we we can have so many people criticizing the prophets but I know what experience I went through it won't touch me a bit and God told him that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob had appeared unto thee and the Lord said further more unto him put now th hand into thy bosom now second son Moses said what will happen I don't know am I going to punch my baby and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was lepos as SN oh oh I'm sick now they will quarantine me I cannot live not even with my wife and my children and my people that's it and he said put thy hand into thy bosom again put it back obedience he put it back we don't see Moses fasting with God why my hand has become leers like this why God and he put his hand into his bosom again and plaed it out of his bosom and behold it was T again as is all the flesh noral amen now the Lord told him and it shall come to pass if they will not believe the if they don't believe when you speak to them nether Heen unto the voice of the first sign when you see the prophet doing a sign something there is a voice that they will believe the voice of the L sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also those two signs brother Bram also had signs the first one what was it taking people by the hand and he will know what disease it was second sign he knew the thoughts in the mind of people the third one he was dealing now with the soul of the Bride the spoken word when on my way here in the plane I read a lot what historian says about the prophet oh it was amazing all of them recognize the Revival in the 20th century the initiator it was William Bram he did so many things he's the only evangelist who successfully run meetings in every continent in these last days they said he was not not after money he was very honest his managers took advantage of him his salary would be 7,000 a year his manager would get 80,000 he had a very stet cord of moral very strict he didn't like corruption in the church today we let down the bars amen the Sheep go out and God's come in he really he really lived Holiness first n if and it shall come to pass if they will not not believe also these two signs nether to divorce that thou shall take of the water of the river now the third sign and put it upon the dry land and the water which thou thou Tak out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land and Moses said down to the Lord oh my Lord oh my Lord I'm not eloquence neither here to for nor since thou spoken unto thy servants but I'm slow of speech and of a slow tongue he could not speak well now he takes it as an excuse listen what God will tell remember Malachi 4 the Lord said by the prophet Malachi 4 remember my Lord which I gave in horor with Moses behold I will send unto you Elijah the prophets now listen God is training His prophets and the Lord said unto him Moses you tell me you cannot speak well who had made men's mouth or who make the DB or death or the seeing or the blunt have I not I the Lord now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth am it will be impossible for you to say something which is wrong because I'll will be with your mouth am and teach thee what that shall say your teaching it will be my teaching the only thing I will do is put my words in your mouth you'll be there just as a mouthpiece because I'm the one who's going down there to deliver them just stand still Moses let me get into you I'll be with your mouth I'll be I'll be the one who will be speaking 13 and he said oh my Lord send I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou will send no Lord if even though you'll take care of my mouth no don't send me the prophet said that's attitude of a true man that has been called by God when you see somebody I want to do it I want to do it sometimes the prophet said no they can't do it amen verse 14 and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said said is not Aaron the levite thy brother now listen what's a levite a levite was his a priest in the Old Testament amen am in the New Testament brother Bram said these are ministers am the fivefold minister Moses you cannot speak that true but don't you have a brother who is a Le levite don't you have the fivefold ministry in the the body of Christ brother he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed I tell people we need to go back to the teaching of the Bible That's where brother Bram brought us back and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said is not Aaron the Le levite thy brother I know that he can speak well the levite will speak well the priest the minister that I have anointed I have called they will speak well don't worry Moses Hallelujah and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee he's coming to see you because Aon you we meet the Lord when we go to the prophet amen can we say Amen behold he come for to meet thee and when he see thee when he sees you he will be glad in his heart I ask myself I ask my brothers the ministers brother when Aaron saw the prophet he rejoiced in his heart the Bible said he was glad to see the prophet how come you are a minister of God you are a levite called of God and you hate the prophets who called you that's not the Bible my Bible said when the levit saw the prophet he was glad in his heart and I'm glad when I when I know that I'm behind the prophet amen what kind of ministers are you now verse 15 and thou shalt speak unto him now since you cannot speak before people this is now what I'm telling you here in Horeb from now on this is the law you my Prophets You shall speak unto Aaron the levite the levite need to listen to you can we say amen and put words in his mouth my prophets I speak to you in your tongue you take the words you put in the mouth of the Levites of the priest and I'll be with thy mouth the mouth of the prophets and with his mouth the mouth of the Levites now God is paying attention to two mouths amen the mouth of the prophet and the mouth of a true servant of God amen when I see people today people say we don't need ministers we don't need pastors I tell them you don't believe your Bible this is the blueprints that's what Malachi said remember in hor what happened go back there I saw the Prophet there and the Levites God telling the prophet take your words put them in his mouth I'll be with your mouth and I'll be with his mouth as long as I'm repeating what the prophet said God is paying attention to my mouth amen and I will teach you what you shall do now listen verse 16 and he shall be the spok man unto the people he'll be what he will be thy Spoken Man spok man unto the people it means Aaron will come oh this is what the Lord said to Moses Moses told me to tell you in the message Genesis chapter 1 or chap second chapter what happened there it wasn't a fruit the Earth this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened and when they believed it the whole congregation was blessed you remember one time he sent ministers to go as as a spies or as what when they went as come huh spies they went he sent 12 one from each tribe there were Chiefs of tribes there were ministers they went there they came back because they didn't repeat what the prophet said it brought trouble in the assembly in the church except for two people Joshua and Caleb they calm down the people we are more than conquerors who is with you is greater than the one who is in the world Amen he shall be the Spoken Man unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth the levite the minister will be your mouth my prophet and that shall be to him instead of God because the prophet that the God we listen to not the God We Adore we worship no the God we listen to because it's God speaking to him I read you the quotation prophets were M pieces of God am I'm about to close that's such a wonderful group of people I have prepared I don't know how many pages but speak to this mountain I'm landing slowly you know when you land first you have been in PLS right is it good is it good you see sometimes you go like this oh my so you need to go slowly you go slowly until you Lear so I'm learning slowly forgive me speak to this mountain it's a very powerful message but the BR I'm delivered in California he was thinking about Mark 11 if you say to this mountain be moved it shall happen unto you he said I was not understanding that's why I could not preach on it amen but today you see a minister he doesn't understand something he comes before you he start talking to you they ask him questions he doesn't know what he was talking about the prophet says this as Justice are scooted down to kind of get get myself warm he was hunting that's where the squarrels were created now he is telling us the story that scripture came to me again whatso you say believe that what you say shall come to pass and you can have what you say well I thought why does that scripture keep coming to me when I can preach on it because I don't know nothing about it do you hear what the prophet says I didn't know nothing about it so I cannot preach on it I could not go before a congregation and try to explain that scripture well I sat there a little bit I thought there is only one thing to it now the prophet start thinking of himself by himself I'll say Jesus told that to the disciples and gave them the that Authority that was about a year and 6 months before the atonement was made so if it wasn't in the atonement it was the other side of the atonement so if anybody ever ask me that question I'll just tell them that it was the other side of the atonement it's the only thing I know now the prophet he start thinking by himself if they ask me a question this is how I'm going to answer he forget that he's a prophet a prophet don't say things by themselves amen now let's go what the Lord will tell him because Jesus was still a living the atonement was not made and he was not wounded for our transgressions no by his stripes we were were we healed yet so he just gave them that power or the side of the atonement what's going on 36 and then all of a sudden as he was thinking if they ask me this is what I'm going to do this is what I'm going to tell them something spoke to me and said what about the prophets can we say Amen what about the prophets well I began to see that it began to unfold to me the voice said what do you think that takes place in the meeting when you are standing there when you are before the people what's going on do you think you are the one who knows those people so today you can start thinking how you going to answer to them do you think you are the one who knows those people do you think that it's you that can predict and say to those people that you are going to do a certain certain thing and a certain certain thing that has happened to you and a certain certain thing will happen to you do you think that's you saying it at the Judgment bar he will ask you the same question brother Bram say oh my it means so much it's never left me and I thought surely Lord surely not lord it's you it's not me who knows those people amen well then the Lord asked him again do you think it's you talking Church do you think it's a prophet talking do you think it's brother Bram talking the Lord is asking him when you are before people the one who's talking do you think it's you talking no he answers no do you think it was the prophets talking have not you just got through preaching on the subject that the prophet was so Anointed with the holy spirit that it was wasn't them that done the speaking it was the Holy spir Spirit in them crying out you just p on it then whatever you say if you are anointed W be you saying it it would be the Holy Spirit saying it a prophet like Moses amen it won't be your it's not you how would you know I can see you or I see you in a red dress in front of a lady maybe 60 70 years I can see you when you were 3 years old I see your parents you had a red dress you were playing in front of your house I see oh oh a car hits you a black car hits you I see they take you to the physician I can hear the physician examining you he says there's nothing he can do or I see he even refer you to another physician that one he's younger than the previous one he looks at you oh I see he performs an operation on you and it seems they left something in you it has been bothering you it's not your Affliction it's something they left in your body or I see you are not alone in this building you came with your husband he could not make it this morning he stayed at the hotel or your mother is with you the person standing by you it's your mother sister thus said the Lord go back you are healed who's talking do you think it's you surely lord it's not me it's you the same God that sent Moses and went in Moses the same went with His prophets Church don't let anybody don't let anybody take you away The Treasure of great price amen no age has seen what we have seen name me one one time brother BR was trying to flee from us he tells the story in the message standing in the gap he wanted to leave that the prophets of O stay in the mountains come down when he had that serve the Lord tell the people and go back God told him no these were prophets of the Old Testament you have more gifts than all of them since Adam or EA up to date you have more gifts you have a great ministry if you go up there your wife he would leave you do you know the prophet said Jesus had more success in his ministry in brother BR Ministry than he had in his own Ministry he that many dead then he did his in his own Ministry do you know that how many the Lord raised up do you know how many three how many cases brother Bram reported that we re from six the double he said he had more success in Jefferson than he did in his entire ministry here on Earth who's talking and the prophet said that's right if a person through the atonements Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with God so close that he can be wrapped so complet in God by the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking these things it's because the blood of Jesus Christ now God can come back and live in US maybe I'll read just one or two quations and I will close because it's almost 2 p.m. I don't know where my time went God bless you church is this the sign of the answer listen the prayer of brother 57 Heavenly Father some time ago I preached upon the subject of pres presuming and presuming is to Adventure without Authority and maybe tonight Lord I have took upon myself to interpret something to the people without having a vision of it remember I told you a prophet is The Interpreter of God's word amen therefore Lord check me what the points is to be checked close my mouth Lord you did close the lion's mouth in the den with Daniel that it did not hurt him Lord I pray that if I should try to interpret something wrong listen you will have power to close my mouth there he said I'll be with your mouth Moses now here is praying you have the power if I'm about to say something wrong you still have the power as you close the mouth of the Lions close my mouth Lord you did close the Lian mouth you still have power to close the mouth but if it is the truth then Lord bless it and send it forth and you know the conditions and what's right at hand and that's why I come even to this very last moment at the pit to try to interpret these things and I pray thee to help us bless this little church the prophet knew how to pray how to bring down God's spirit you know when I came to the message the first thing I used to do we didn't have all the books we didn't have the internet sometimes I had a whole book just the prayers of the Prophet I'll mark them down in my notebooks and I'll read them because he really knew how to get the spirit of God among people to his prayer bless this chair this little church this group that comes here under the roof that sojs with with us here in the city coming out of many states oh when the evening Shadows are falling we are so glad to have a place to come it's the evening time amen when the world is so confused and do not know where they are standing we are glad that the name of the Lord is a mighty tower and the rightous run into it and I safe just not so many words but a revelation amen amen so we pray father as the evening lights would come at the setting of the Sun and we believe that's the time that we are living in the setting of the Sun and we must solemnly thank the Lord from all our hearts for the things that you have done for us and Lord down through the age I thank you for letting the visions that you have given every one of them just perfectly and every interpretation of dream has been exactly that way amen so we know it's only it could could only be you Lord for we are morals all born in sin and there is not a s thing in us now listen praise the Lord but to think that you could take such a thing as a human being and wash them by the water of the world and by the blood of Christ am and stretch forth that hand in such a way till the person doesn't use their own thinking but let the mind of Christ who knows all things let it come in and speak and use a tabernacle he said thank you Father amen you came down am man he empates himself let the mind of God that knows everything comes in amen and he starts revealing these things living in a tabernacle he says Thank You Lord it really went deep in my soul the first time I heard that prayer I said oh God a prophet like Moses what a privileged people we are you know with these things we can create our own world we can create our own world with this message it's so wonderful don't let anybody fool with you keep this message but Bram said someday I'll be gone listen to my voice if the Lord takes me before his coming remember I have spoken to you in the name of the Lord listen to my voice it wasn't his voice it was the voice of God thank you Father for the M let's read the last scripture the one question and answers that the scriptures that follow I put together so many things if we want all these quotations for M has has them we won't have time do you think that's God Almighty would give me the ministry he has got around this the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had do you think God our Father Almighty he will give me the same Ministry that Jesus had with Supernatural signs and things which has never been seen since the New Testament God gives me such a Ministry and let me walk in error like that the prop says what certainly not he won't give me a Ministry like the ministry of Jesus had everybody even his opponents recognize the ministry had was unique it was unique now he gives me such a Ministry and let me walk in Hell the prophet said no certainly not there is no mistake mistakes are in the people in the minds of people the devil trying to send more people to Hell amen if you receive a prophet a prophet is God's mercy I don't have the time to read you that he even said the children of Israel they didn't need the king to be prosperous they only needed the prophets in the way of a true Prophet can we say Amen amen thank you brother M if we finish 2 Chronicle 2020 it says and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of teor and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said that's when he went to meet with Ahab they went to to war he told them hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall he be established believe His prophets so shall he Prosper am that's may God bless you amen thank you for your attention Pastor you have the puet pray for me and may God bless you richly bless you we love you thank you amen thank God for the word again it wasn't our brother Neville it was the Lord amen uh I don't know if he noticed it or you noticed it but the last quote there uh brother Bram was praying and right the last the paragraph there he prayed for brother Neville he prayed for pastor Neville amen I said well brother rown maybe didn't know but the Lord knew that he he was going to be here sh sharing sharing the quote with us Amen to make it to make it a blessing to us amen and he prayed for the bride of Christ and he prayed for pastor Neville amen well we we just think of the pastor and Bram Tabernacle but we've got another Pastor Neville so God bless him and thank God for the ministry of the word through that Pastor and uh I'm reminded of the time when brother Neville was going from time to Eternity and he was maybe heard his 70s and he a brother was with him a ministering brother and he said brother Neville uh he said do you have anything for the church he said before you go to tell the church and yes he said brother he said tell the tell the Believers he said that what they're looking for he said it's already come and it's already here so thank the Lord amen why because God is here and everything that God God has got in his plan and purpose and pattern is here with him amen even what he had in years gone by if what's there for the future amen that's that's that's good we believe that we believe that what do we believe in this amen believing what God has done in this hour and and God is doing in this hour he's still doing it God is still working working on on the ministry of his word what for to give us the resurrection and rapturing faith that we need see the faith that pleases God through the prophet brother again you you got to hear the messenger he said now the man Moses was very Meek and above all the men which were upon the face of the Earth Moses was more Meek than any of them anything God's looking for in The Bride is humility and meekness amen and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream amen this is what our brother was bringing out the significance of the ministry of a prophet and brother Prophet did not end in the Old Testament amen God had promised God had used prophets to the in the among the Gentiles and promised for the last day in Malachai 4 to turn as he did to John John the Baptist he was turning the hearts of the the Old Testament fathers to the Pentecostal children amen but they said I was send you another Elijah and he said turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers amen and brother that's what God has been doing what God is doing Amen to give us to give us the Revelation that they they needed then amen father what did they need they needed the Resurrection The Life Redemption and we natur spiritually get back in fellowship with God we need Redemption physically amen he came the first time the alpha to redeem our souls he has come the second time the Omega to redeem our bodies amen this is tremendous the promise the plans and the purpose of God the pattern of God see the word doesn't change it's an absolute plan it's not it's not just something dropped in here and then you dropped something else there something else there everything everything is in order amen the whole truth as he said the whole truth nothing but the truth we believe it because we got to believe it all because we got to look at it all to see the to see the whole plan of God and the whole purpose of God and the whole pattern of God but thank God for the prophet that highlighted these things in this last day amen there it wasn't highlighted in the in in the in the previous Church ages at all they they just highlighted this just this just this right there but not the overall plan but when we come to the end we need to we need the revelation of the plan we need the revelation of the purpose of God to know that we're at the end we need the revelation of the pattern of God to know we're at the end this is how God this is what God was wants this is this is his purpose this is how he's how he's doing it and how and I done it amen Amazing Grace brother thank God it is Grace Grace Grace Grace it is wonderful and so thank God for the ministry of the word concerning God and His prophets so let's pay attention to the to the to the word that God speaks through his servants and tell that remember this too as the prophet of God has said he said this is the Judgment seat he said over the going the word is going over the altar he said the Judgment seat and so on and he God is judging you by the word God has judged us today by his word God is what for God is looking for our response to that word not necessarily a verbal response response yes sometimes but he's looking for your Holy Ghost response in your soul amen what is your attitude toward what you have heard today in your soul amen by the grace of almighty God praise the name of the Lord that we receive it not in our heads but in our hearts amen where's where's faith faith is on the inside of the inside but that's where that's where we got to have it to experience the resurrection to experience the Rapture because the prophet of God did say he said you can be healed and go to hell he said it's because it's just a natural thing a physical thing you're believing in your head and and many times that's why they only sought the prophet was the signs and wonders many times they came to Jesus not for the word but they came for the signs and the Wonders he said you gave what Jesus went they said why did you come he you came he said because you ate of the Loaves and were filled because it was a miracle and they wanted wanted Jesus to do it again amen well brother as the Propet of God said I believe I mentioned last service again he said Lord he said they're calling me in the hotel there he said they want to come to see me is they want to come he said they want to see me or you they want to see William brandom but just because of the gift that he had we got to look beyond the gift and see God as he said it's not hearing William brandom it's not hearing Moses it's hearing God Amen it's the voice of God and sometimes God hidden in reveal in Simplicity oh my brother sister you'll speak TR through this brother sometimes he'll speak through a sister whatever you know sometimes he might be speaking to you through a child amen but God give us Grace to recognize it that's why we got to walk in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the light live in the light so that we're going to recognize God Amen recognize the revelation of the word so he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream amen and if there's anything that that a prophet is is is humble as Moses was Meek above all men that were upon the face of the Earth and as was testified by a Roman Catholic bishop when William Ram was taken off the scene he said it is any man that he that you would meet that had love he said with William Brandon he said you just had to talk to him and you knew it oh yes you knew that spirit that he had that anointing that was on him and brother sister again our brother brought out that you discern a brother Spirit a sister Spirit just by talking to them just for what sometimes they'll say something you know whether it's God or not amen and whether it's out of their heart soul but not their minds but there's got to be holy ghost in your soul amen as the prophet said that you can do it in your head repent you can be baptized just intellectually going going by the letter of the word and he said but he said not spiritually no no he said because what is it he said that's just dead Works he said if it's but if it comes out of your soul he said that's the living work the Living Word of the Living God but I pray that your your repentance was not a dead work I pray your water baptism was not a dead work amen but was the Living Word of the Living God coming to pass in your life what is it it's Redemption amen praise the Lord not Church going Redemption not religion Redemption by the grace of God thank the Lord thank God for his word and thank you brother Neville Amen brother Neville the second I don't know I don't know if the if the Lord has another brother NE the third it might be we'll see I don't know if his son is Neville amen but thank God God again it's amazing you never know what God does and how God does it amen but the thing it is is is to have the spirit and have the anointing to recognize God by the grace of God so thank God for the ministry of our brother Neville amen let's stand I'm going to turn it to our brother
