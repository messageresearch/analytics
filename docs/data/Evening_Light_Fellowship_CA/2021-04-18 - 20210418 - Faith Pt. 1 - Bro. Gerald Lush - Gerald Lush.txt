lord [Music] praise the amen hallelujah praise the lord amen thank god to god be the glory because i'll tell you great things he has done i just pray grace that we got the faith to recognize what he's done and what he's doing and what he will do amen that keeps us pressing on with the faith amen the faith that pleases god amen not the faith that pleases you when you're in your head amen not faith of pleasing your neighbor or others in the church is the faith that pleases god amen and that's what god's looking for the faith amen he's got a yet there was a faith in every age and he was looking for those that believed what he would reveal in that age praise the name of the lord so brother i trust that we reveal what he did what we believe what he did reveal and we believe what he is revealing amen you're taking you're going on one step at a time it's not just say oh god told me this or you're going to stay there no that's just another step forward amen and of course the church ages is a testimony of what god has done and god revealed it here reveal it there amen just think faith praise the lord and brother sister where he began that's where he's going to end amen amen brother he started with faith now he's going to look for that faith amen in your heart and mind and that's what i want to eventually measure minister on this afternoon or this morning amen is faith exactly the faith that pleases god faith in the scriptures and and i want to show you the emphasis that god puts on faith to the extent that god said without faith it is impossible to please him amen you got to have faith and brother we got to have the right kind of faith amen not in your head got to be in your heart amen sure why because in your heart it's a testimony that that faith controls you amen from the heart if you've got it in your head like the problem of god said you couldn't have you could have the holy ghost he said in your flesh he said he said 24 hours a day and he said and go to hell amen because it's not in the soul amen what god is looking for when it comes to faith he wants not the faith of your mouth he's looking for the faith out of your heart amen the faith not that controls what you're saying it controls what you're doing amen it is the faith that controls your lived everyday living amen because we're walking by faith living by faith it is faith that controls us thought word and deed amen all based on faith it's all based on the revelation of the will of god amen not all mine and as i ministered on it and i said yeah now the bride's going to come to that place that jesus came when he when he bowed in prayer and he said not my will father thine be done amen even though there came an angel to minister to him an angel to it to encourage an angel to strengthen that physical being amen but yet he said not my will thine be done so brother goddess god is going to allow us to stay just as long amen on television bring out that that confession you bring up that testimony oh lord i believe what you did but lord not what i will what you will amen oh brother it's coming down to that because that's the only ones that are going in a rapture are those who have surrendered and yield to the will of god amen not my will thine be done and jesus laid down his life and picked it up again he endured what man did to him and brother is the seed of god in this hour we endure by the grace of god amen oh yeah we're in the door because the enemy's going to be there so deceitful oh yeah to make you believe you're in the will of god because you believe the message and as i said you know the devil believes the message but look what he's doing but again as i said also i said look at the faith that the message gave william bran or not brother brown but but the devil oh yeah he's come down with great wrath knowing his time is short well how do you know his time is short by by what god's doing amen he knew what god started with he knew what god was doing through the ages and then he knew what god was doing in the last stage amen to make an end of all things and he knows his time is short and that's why we're seeing so much unbelief and we're seeing so much of the devil's works amen more people are more cut out with their flesh and less and less with their soul amen and we'll show you that scripture again in just a moment brother where jesus indicates the kind of faith that will be here at the end of the age amen oh it's tremendous the emphasis and i want to share those scriptures with you the emphasis that the bible is putting on faith the emphasis that the seed of god put on faith amen not and again brother sister is not just a knowledge in your head it's what's in your heart amen god's not looking for faith in your head or in your flesh he's looking for faith in your heart amen why because if it's in your heart it controls you oh yeah it's in your heart it controls your everyday living brother you walk with him you talk with him your every thought your thinking is is the influence of christ in us it is our faith on the inside of the inside by the grace of god amen so i trust by the grace of god god help us to have faith in our hearts not knowledge in our heads but faith in our hearts and we know that faith is a revelation amen it is but many of them got many many even believers around the message they got it in their heads they got it in their flesh and maybe even in their spirits but it's not in their heart amen if it's in your heart it's going to control you thought word and deed no matter what you do if it's in control in your heart whatever you do it's going to be the will of god amen because you're because god in your heart is not going to lead you to do this lead you to do that lead you to say this say that no not by any means if it's in your heart brother it keeps your focus on eternity it keeps you focused on the will of god for your life again not me that liveth is christ that liveth in me amen if he lives in you he's got control of you so grace of god to help us to recognize that we have true holy ghost faith amen and again remind you and is a tremendous warning and he said you can have faith you can have the holy ghost anointing in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell why because it's not in control from the soul god help us the lord bless us amen let's stand and we'll sing only believe as we go into the thoughts on faith and the emphasis that the bible puts on faith hey amen and not just the intellectual revelation of the word no no the bible says no no you can have that but still not have faith the bible says they're going to do this they're going to do that but where's their faith they didn't they enter in got this we enter in and get this but not faith god help us amen that what we have we believe it in our hearts not we're not going to leave it to the head we're not going to leave it to our flesh it's our souls amen amen and faith real true genuine holy ghost faith is a testimony that god's in control of your life amen because it's not what you believe in your head it's what you believe in your heart amen it's listening only believe and also welcome our brother and sister ellsworth here this morning amen and keep keep both of them in prayer amen because even our sister elsewhere has experienced weaknesses in her body and we prayed for them last night before they went to bed and our sister got up since he felt better when she got up this morning praised the name of the lord so we pray that grace to our brother ellsworth and what he's enduring and what he what he's doing right now the test amen so the grace of god be with him when he returns there on monday amen praise the lord oh yeah we'll go through it sometimes god wants you to do this god wants you to do this amen but let's let's make sure it's the will of the lord and we are led by the spirit amen so you see like i said about that uh that that woman one time that came in the prayer line and the father god told her to go out and he said you go out and when you get off the bus somewhere and he said you're gonna see a woman there a man and she's gonna oh she's gonna ask what's wrong with your child your boy and you tell him and she oh just think he said now he said she she's going to tell you that she knows a doctor at a certain area there and that he can he can he can look after it and he can do it and he said you obey her just think we thought if his faith all faith just going to be going oh god's got to do it it's got to be this miracle that miracle brother it's the miracle that ears god and the miracle that believes god and the miracle that obeys god amen so brother let's follow the leadership of the holy ghost amen so lord bless you let's sing only believe and keep sister betty in prayer as well she's having a number of pains in her hip and her back and and one of her legs so the grace of god to us amen and our faith there ever an hour every age that faith is challenged it's the last age amen there's a beginning challenge of faith and there's an end time challenge of faith amen a challenge that they never they never add in luther's day wesley's day or even the early pentecostals but now brother why why is our faith more challenged now because now we're in the aids that he prophesied how things are going to get worse and worse and worse amen but in in all that we're seeing and all that we're experiencing god help us to have faith amen believe god hallelujah [Music] all things are possible [Music] yes amen praise the lord amen amen jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible [Music] jesus jesus is here amen hallelujah amen thank you jesus yes all things are possible because of his presence [Music] amen [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] yes lord in our prayers to believe with that complete belief amen so that we have absolutely no question we have no doubt we believe it is written we believe thus saith the lord hallelujah we believe lord what you have done but lord we thank you for that grace to believe what you're doing amen and to believe lord what you will do amen knowing that we have this faith to press on we have this faith to move on hallelujah keeping our eyes on calvary keeping our eyes lord on glory amen father we're thankful for what you've done we thank you for what you're doing amen to bring us more and more to that perfect faith amen the perfect faith lord the faith that pleases you and grace oh god alleluia in the challenge of the word praying the grace that we have is faith in our hearts it is grace lord of faith in our souls lord not then again or not in our flesh not in our minds but on the inside of the inside knowing lord that you're you're controlling not the flesh not just our spirit but you control the soul amen and lord you project that right anointing into our into our spirits and you project that right anointing lord into our flesh to show hallelujah and to bring forth christ in us the hope of glory amen so lord we commit ourselves unto your care father for the going forth of your word the ministry of your word so that it is not brother jerome lord hallelujah not brother joel giving the word but the holy ghost from the heart and lord not these brothers and sisters receiving it acknowledging it the lord alleluia the sons and daughters of god acknowledging lord the truth of it and the reality of it lord in our souls amen so lord that is not me that lives is not my brother and sister that lives is christ living in us oh lord what a testimony what a faith to know that it's god controlling our thoughts our words and our deeds lord it is god it is christ in us controlling our feelings o my lord i pray in the name of jesus that you have more and more control amen and lord in the name of the lord jesus christ that we die more and more to ourselves and become more and more alive to jesus more and more alive to your will amen not my will but thine be done in these last days father grace as we committed all into your care again the sick the lowly the suffering we pray your anointed upon them in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray the grace of god amen in control father of of their entire being amen shall show again to the world that you're reflecting yourself through that brother through that sister amen christ in us the hope of glory to god be the glory lord lead us lead us lead us father according to your will not my will but thine be done and grace lord that we are subject to that leadership grace said we're going to follow that leadership grace lord that we're not going to sacrifice father just just for ourselves but for the glory of god amen to god be the glory great things you have done and great things you're doing be with us we pray in the name of our lord jesus christ and lord for your glory your honor your praise forgive us of our sin forgive us of any any anything lord that we doubt or disbelieve of us to believe with that complete belief amen that we believe it is written we believe what you've done amen thus saith the lord hallelujah you have vindicated it to be the truth grace that will follow on in the name of our lord jesus christ for your glory amen and amen and amen praise the lord hallelujah now i believe [Music] amen [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen god bless us and uh god bless brother jonathan is he here oh he's not here okay we pray the grace of god oh his own with sick jensen okay we pray the grace of god to him amen to give us the faith we need turn with me to luke chapter 18. i want to share with you some scripture we may be able to get to some quotes here but if not this this morning or this afternoon i want to share with you the scriptures we're in that the lord is putting the emphasis on faith amen i pray the grace of god that we're putting the emphasis on faith and we can narrow it down narrow it down to this message that message this doctrine that doctrine and that's basically all it becomes but not faith oh i see this and i see this and i believe this and i believe that but faith cometh by hearing the word amen it's giving us the faith to believe god giving us the faith to claim the promise of god amen giving us the faith to get into the will of god amen not my will let him be done but i tell you jesus did it but there's not many believers going to say that because why because more often than not that the will of god for them is going to be contrary to what they want oh yeah but again if you're a seed of god you don't care what god wants you to do where how and when he wants you to do it you're going to do it amen you're not even a question because it's god in you so lord i follow your leadership amen by the grace of god amen so in luke chapter 18 and beginning to read at verse 1 and e jesus spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint amen so the grace of god that we'll pray but not faint amen saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god and as the prophet said god doesn't fear himself amen and this is god in control so he said although i fear not god nor regard man amen and it says yet because this widow troubled me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she wearing me are we going to continually come to the lord as much as she came to him amen oh yeah you you've got it if you want it you'll call for it by the grace of god amen and the lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not god avenge his own elect amen which cry day and night unto him amen and praise the lord if we've got a relationship with god we're in communion with god amen we consult the lord by the grace of god when you walk you're thinking his thoughts amen when you talk you're going to express his thoughts praise the lord because it's not you it's christ in you amen praise the lord and he said avenge is the only lack which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them amen thank god for that grace and i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth god bless his word you may be seated the thing that pleases god is what he's looking for and it is faith but he's indicating the unbelief of the of the last days to the extent that he said when the son of man comes will he find faith well brother sister is he finding faith in us and i'm not referring just to the letter of the word the letter of a message that god spoke by the prophet no but do we have the revelation of it in our hearts is it in control of us not in control of our heads not in control of our thoughts not in control of our arguments no no it's in control of our lives so again the truth is that it's not me it's not you that lives it is christ the word living in us amen is not you in control and you're following your feelings no no and you're following maybe your spirit no no it's following the leadership of the holy ghost christ in us amen because in our flesh we're going to do one thing in our flesh we all i feel to do this i feel to go here feel it go there but you know what is the leadership of god in your heart amen it's not what you want to do it's what god wants to do in you is what god wants to do through your life amen there's too many today whether it's out there in denominations whether it's around the message there are too many just doing their own thing what they want to do where they want to do it how they want to do it and when they want to do it but they're not really seriously considering the will of god amen is this the will of god by the grace of god and it takes again that anointing within yes with our brother ellsworth and sister elder there to believe that that god allowed all this to happen to bring us to this place just think of that amen god allowed this to happen in our brother's life in our sister's life amen to bring them into this place of fellowship with the saints amen by the grace of almighty god amen is what god permitted and what god allowed and god predestinated even concerning our brother visual that may oh well he just left india and he come into canada and he come into newfoundland to take a university course and so on yeah but was that his decision or was it god's decision amen was that is his choice and a conviction within his own mind i'd like to do this i'd like to do that i want to do this i want to do well was it god in him hungry and thirsting for it was god in him convicting him to do this convicting him to do that amen again as i look back in my own life and i see i see this and i see this and i see that oh my the the number of things that i've done in my life when it comes to our work there worked there did this did that and so on i said oh my i said it i must be the lord you know even as i worked in a department store and one of the managers i was just stood there at a certain counter and one of the managers came over and says excuse me excuse me yes he said do you preach and uh well i said yes sometimes i preach always i just want to know i thought there's something different here amen and yet at the same time they're depending on me to do this and do that amen for their business and only that they would they would depend on me to to gather the employees together and exhort them as to what they should do and how they should do it and and so on and oh yes they say we want you to do it come on you could you to explain it just get them together in there in that room amen and tell them what to do and how to do it because when i when i started that business i i did i didn't start as as part of management but i ended up as part management i started in another place i didn't end up this way but but it went out went higher and higher and higher i was doing the will of god amen for the glory of god amen no matter where i was no matter what job it was and those that i were associated with i wasn't ashamed of the testimony i wasn't ashamed of what god had done for me amen and the witness that he wanted me to give them amen as i told you one time before and and then they the certain customer came in and they wanted to know this and know this and i said one minute i'll find out and i went to a management that's a little higher than me and always said you go tell her this no i said i'm not telling her that i said if you want to you can do it but i'm not going to do it and why because they wanted me to lie to her oh yeah and leave her with the impression they did this when they didn't do it amen and so and that's exactly what he did he went and told her but i didn't and they knew that and again as i said there was issues there and we had problems there one time and i just walked around calmly and everybody else was all all torn up and all oh my they were really nervous and then finally the again the manager one the manager came in and said mr lush how can you be so calm we need this we got to have this we need it now with it within in the hour i said well we'll get it within the hour i still worry about it and i said the lord provide and he did amen because what they were looking for just within the half hour so whatever i found it amen i said come here i'll show you well they were amazed but again i gave the glory to god amen no matter where it was cooking or business or management amen i give the glory to god by the grace of god and again as again as i said as i mentioned one time before that i i was sitting in an office behind the desk and and income the janitor and oh he said uh mr lars i got a question to ask you i said okay what is it he said you understand that you only got a grade 9 diploma and and he said you're here behind the desk and he said i got i got a grade 11 diploma that's what the grades were back then but he said i got the top diploma and he said how come you're here behind the desk with grade nine he said and i'm out there with a with a with a broom and a mop and and doing this and doing janitor work and he said i got i got all these uh diplomas well i said i guess i said it's all in the hands of the lord amen i told them it wasn't me it was god in control amen and again as i said say amen let's give a good witness of jesus give a good witness of god amen that he's in control of your life i don't care what you're doing amen you're going to reflect jesus it's not you that lives now you're doing the job it's good it's jesus amen by the grace of almighty god and i discovered later i didn't know at the time but i discovered that there was someone told me they said oh mr luft did you know that they wanted you to go there and man manage their store and another one said oh yeah they wanted him they said can we get him they they saw me in that the store the original store there but again oh they were starting this business this business that business they said we want him and i no i i didn't know it at the time but i was following god's leadership amen to god be the glory amen will give the glory to jesus and tell of his wonderful love amen it is our faith and it is faith in control amen it is not doctrine it is not theology oh yeah god said this god said that i believe this i believe that no brother it's going to contr whatever god said i'll tell you this you're going to surrender to it and god's going to control your life amen god's going to troll control what you do how you do it and where you do it why for because you're going to be a witness amen and and others are going to recognize that anointing and and that spirit in you that life in you oh and this this brother this gentleman he's different this sister is different oh my what makes him different it's jesus amen is god going to bless and i pray grace that is god blessing us today amen the grace of god is god blessing you amen now not the devil because the devil can bless you too but make sure it's god amen and and what you're doing you're doing it for the glory of god brother shester that in these last days i'll tell you it's a challenge for us to make our our faith the calling which is our faith our calling and election sure amen make your faith sure so brother it is you're in the will of god by the grace of god amen the true faith puts us in the will of god amen the true faith keeps us in the will of god amen i'm not going to reason with god i'm just going to follow his leadership amen and as i've said i've been a janitor well why did i go from a janitor to the management amen well that was god in control amen brother it's tremendous the things that i can say and witness concerning what god has done for me and what god is doing for me amen i pray god to give you that witness and that testimony you can go and tell them what god has done for you and what god is doing for you and that you're not living according to your own will but the will of god amen we're here because of the will of god and we believe that our brother god brought our brother and sister ellsworth amen for his will amen for their lives amen it's not man it's not the devil doing it god did it amen if you're if you're a believer and you're filled with the holy ghost god's in control amen when you go here and you do this oh my i pray grace that we have that true anointing in our souls in our entire beings no matter what you do it's it's it's the grace of god in your life it is god leading you amen and you're going to do it for the glory of god you're not going to go and do it forget god no no you're gonna he's gonna be with you more and more and more amen by grace amen so brother sister again we're living in the hour that jesus spoke of when he challenged us saying when the son of man comes will he find faith amen so is he finding the faith that pleases him is he finding that faith in you is he seeing that faith in your heart in your soul amen not in your flesh or in your body but in your soul amen because what god does unto eternal life is out of the soul amen it is the eternal life on the inside the inside that's controlling your spirit it is the eternal life on the inside of the inside that's controlling your flesh and your thoughts amen what for to bring it subject to the will of god amen so brother god brings us all to that place to bring us down to where we're going to confess not my will thine be done oh yeah god's going to put that pressure on us and that test on us amen to bring it out amen because oh my look what jesus went through as an example for you and me that he went through this test of faith the trial of faith amen oh yes because brother wasn't just for you it wasn't just for me it was it was for all the predestinated seed of god around the world amen and i thought about israel my lord i said forgive me i said i don't mean to keep coming and talking to you i said i know there's millions and millions around the world that are consulting you forgive me lord amen well you you mean tell me god wants that well the prophet of god brother as the billy brother billy paul said he went when looking for brother brown to get him to come to the pulpit and he he said he was in his office in an office there and he was on his knees amen and he said and he said he surprised billy paul with what he said and he said lord he said forgive me he said for not not mentioning this when when i spoke to you and he was interrupting god again amen oh yeah brother he he respected god amen and he didn't want to put too much trouble in god's hands no no but by the faith that god gave him he was he was going to do this and do that to please god and he said lord forgive me and amen for coming back again but he just prayed he said lord this this i want you to do amen i wonder how many of us think think of that about god and many of us are sensitive to that we're we're all mine we're we're troubling god we're putting god in more trouble by putting ourselves in more trouble oh yeah we're letting the devil lead us instead of jesus amen brother god help us to have the faith that pleases him amen so i pray grace that he's going to find that faith in these last days in you and me but he said i tell you that he will avenge them speedily but nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth will he find that faith that believes god will he find that faith that believes the word of god and brother not just to go say i believe i believe but it you manifest it in your life it controls you amen amen it controls what you're saying what you're doing where you're going everything amen oh god have mercy on us and help us lord to be truly truly controlled and governed by faith faith a revelation of the will of god not my will oh brother just in this hour we've got to come to that place more and more than we thought we did or would in any other age not my will time to be done how many are believers here how many of you are saying not my will thine be done that you come to that place and time in your life amen that there's a conviction maybe and and then and you feel it's the lord lord what is it you want me to do lord where's that you want me to go lord not my will thine be done and he'll reveal it amen knowing that you're going to obey it praise the lord amen let's go to hebrews chapter 10 the book of hebrews chapter 10. again just to share the scripture with you and the emphasis that's put on faith amen not intellectual knowledge but the spiritual revelation of the word and in hebrews chapter 10 and verse 36 for ye of need of patience amen i'll tell you this i meet a lot of believers that need patience oh yeah during a hurry do this and hurry do that say wait on the lord oh but he wants god to do it now ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god after ye have done the will of god we need patience make sure you're doing the will of god that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry praise the lord the just shall live by faith amen but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him the just those who are justified in christ you're living by that faith that is finished in christ amen are we the just ones in these last days amen but just notice that justice is going to live by faith yeah but if any man draw back if you got faith you won't draw back faith is going to put you forward not back amen if any man draw back from full obedience or full surrender amen oh yeah you're drawing back god is taking it this far this far this far but then all of a sudden we stop god wants us to go on to surrender more and more to his leadership amen not your feelings but his revelation amen god's grace believing that it was that faith that brought our brother viciously here is that faith amen that brought our brother jonathan and sister blanc and the family here again amen oh my brother how many is there in this world today in the will of god and many are following the leadership of christ in them amen not many because even many are believers just believe in the message and going on doing what they want to do they're not living for christ to living for this world amen they're caught up with this world but the bride is caught up with jesus the bride is caught up with the word the bride is caught up with what god has done and with what god is doing and brother the most important ones in our life is the body of christ it's the believer amen we're living if you're living for christ you're living for one another amen that's right that's the truth brother why i pray god that we got that faith i pray god that would really truly been anointed with that faith oh yeah because i'll tell you this there were certain individuals that i had to deal with over the years that were that that felt oh you should give us more attention because we're this because we're that you know but all you're concerned about is when you come here and oh you're going you're going down to mac mc barnes yeah or you're going down to julie barnes that's all you come and go come and go and when you would drop in sometimes and say hello to to family members oh yeah but they challenged us they challenged us on one time and oh they said all you're doing is going back and forth to them you're with them with them with them you're not with us just you just drop in and say hello and go on oh yeah why because brother sister burns is my brothers and sisters in christ amen they're they're my they're my family eternal oh yeah in an eternal relationship we come from eternity we're fellowshipping here in time and we're going back to eternity amen see it proves the new birth you're born again amen if you're born again you've got a new nature amen it's not the nature of mom and dad not the nature of grandma grandpa it's the nature of jesus it's the nature of god and that's why that's why it was what you do it's got a spiritual emphasis on it amen not natural you're not kind of you're not focusing on the natural anymore you're focusing on spiritual by the grace of god amen god of us to have the faith that pleases him this is the faith that pleases god where you give him preeminence and you give your the sons and daughters of god the preeminence the family of god the preeminence oh yeah by the grace of god for he said yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith amen are we living by faith morning noon and night are we living by faith every day yeah are you are you living by the by the leadership of the holy ghost christ in you every day and every hour doesn't matter what choice or decision you make is not you it's jesus made it and you're following his leadership amen so the just shall live by faith a revelation of the will of god and it goes beyond doctrine oh yeah is christ in control amen by the grace of god and it says if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him if you if you're going to draw draw back and you'll draw yourself away from the will of god and do what you want to do well god will have no pleasure in you god have mercy for he said we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul amen whatever god wants to do and how great the separation he wants to bring in your life in my life your will be done lord amen consider what jesus endured amen consider what jesus took his stand for amen oh yeah turn even his family turned against him well he went to he went to capernaum and that was where his family was and they said this and this well you do that out there they were we would call them his step-brothers and they said you you're going over there and you do this you do that but he said er capernaum you won't do nothing yeah and he said well he said because of the wrong belief he said where there's faith you do this faith you do that you're responding to faith amen god help us amen brother we'll go forth and we're going to reflect jesus no matter how evil it gets how sinful the world gets how dark the world gets yet we're going for this as the light of the word by the grace of god representing jesus hallelujah oh brother i pray grace that we have the seriousness of faith and what it means amen and again oh yeah well let's believe this believe that yes but if we're truly believing in the heart hallelujah we're in a fellowship with jesus amen not william branham jesus brother brown said he said i'm not the messenger he said he is he said that's your problem he said i'm i am a son of man revealing the son of man amen and he's your trouble is you don't see the other angel amen brother i pray grace that we see the other angel amen that we have that faith that's based on yes we thank you for the word lord well good praise the lord what does it what does the revelation teach me or there's no trinity oh the revelation teaches oh yeah the water baptism in his name brother the revelation of the word is to give us the faith that pleases god to move on amen not just stop there and stop there you keep on going keep on going amen this is revealed that's revealed amen unto a brother it goes to there's perfect faith that his works has faith expressed what doctrine is that oh god it water baptism this this oh what about wisdom versus faith that message oh my the message is oh yeah this was 1957. he preached on faith alone amen and of course in in 1965 december just a couple weeks before lord took him home he preached on the rapture amen and god what god has done is to give us rapturing faith yeah he said the rapture is already on the rapture is already gone amen but what god through the revealed word is giving us is the revelation it's the faith that's going to put us into the rapture amen by the grace of almighty god so it is tremendous brother concerning all the messages that the prophet of god preached on faith amen in hebrews 11 and verse 1 faith is the substance and in one of his messages the prophet highlighted this verse and he says see this is this is the reality of god's will he said oh see he said faith is a substance amen so too many to a lot of people these books are the substance or the tapes or the cds they're the substance no it's christ in us it's more real than the book amen christ said us is more real than those cds or the tapes amen by the grace of god so faith is the substance of things hoped for and it is the evidence of things not seen amen so brother the world will wonder what caused you to live like this what caused you to do this do that oh because they they don't see it they don't understand it they can't comprehend it but for us it's faith oh yeah and there was neighbors one time across where we lived somewhere else and they were they said oh who are they look at the way they live yeah that was not us it was jesus and it got their attention oh yeah they knew it well he says you're you're different from everybody else well by the grace of god we're not going to boast over that we're boasting over jesus that makes us different amen votes over jesus that gives us the wisdom he gives us oh my brother sister grace lord that we have the faith that pleases you amen do you have the faith that god's looking for in you too many feel yeah i got it i got the message no no i tell you what god wants the faith he wants is control over your life it's a control over what you do how you do it when and where you do it showing that you followed his leadership by the grace of god it is substance and the prophet highlighted these words substance and evidence faith is the substance of things hoped for well if his substance is more real than your sight what faith declares is more real than what our senses declare amen and it is the evidence of things not seen for by it by faith the elders obtained a good report and if they got a good report that's what god's looking for in you is faith amen so you're going you're going to make the right confession amen you're going to express the right faith the right belief the right word amen and express it the way that god wants you to express it in your life it's more than your tongue it's your life amen if there's anything that god wants us to see in us reflecting faith is the life you live amen that you that brother that sister that son that daughter oh what are they they're doing this they're doing it yeah but that's that's what i want them to do amen grace to us that you're in the will of god by the grace of god amen again by it the elders obtained a good report are we going to get a good report because of our faith i trust we do so that faith is in control amen faith controls us faith is governing us brother we just follow god's leadership amen that pleases god for through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and he goes on to say by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice amen then cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous amazing how righteous are you well as your faith declares it now it's not having the knowledge in your head as the power of god highlighted and speak the word only he said you got the mechanics but you don't have the dynamics and a lot of a lot of so-called believers today they got the mechanics of the message they got the mechanics of the revealed word but they don't have the dynamics brother without the dynamics we can't go in the rapture without the dynamics we won't be changed god's grace to us amen that we got the mechanics and the dynamics god's grace that the mechanics is in control or the dynamics is in control amen oh the word the message listen i'll tell you if any god wants you to do more than anything else he wants you to live the word more than talk it walk the talk sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god and they walk in the spirit amen grace to us are you walking in the spirit is that why you're here you're walking in the spirit amen if you walk in the spirit you're going to walk according to the will of god you walk in the spirit you're going to walk according to the word of god amen grace grace grace grace amen so by faith the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen do not are not we're not made of things which do appear and again by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice keynes was excellent yeah be careful don't look down your noses to those out there going to this church in that church because some of some of them are offering excellent sacrifices amen as i told you about that that gentleman that oh that we met somewhere and he was in a senior zone and after after this chapel one time the nurse came in and said pastor this gentleman wants to see you oh i said okay i was wondering where he was he wasn't in the chapel service no she said he's bedridden so she said he would like to see you and i went up to see him and he was a he was of the anglican church and oh praise the lord and he was glad that when he saw me walk into his room and oh praise the lord i always so glad you came his pastor said i want you to pray for me and he because he knew that his hour was coming to leave and go out of time and into eternity but he said you know he said pastor i i believe he said i'm going to be in glory he said i believe and he went and he got it i got his bible he opened it up and he said there's there's there's me right there he said he said i'm gonna be number with this group and i i said yes you are you're right amen and i prayed for him and knowing that when i looked at his bible oh he had this underline that underlined this marked and that my oh this is amazing yes he said he said because he said even my family said they said they don't like it they said because when they come to visit me he said the the the open book the open bible is is on the table and he said they know that every time they come to visit me is all of our conversation comes back to the bible it comes back to the word and they said they don't like that they want to close the bible push it aside but he said not me and i said brother look what you've got done here you are i underlined this now that's yes he said that's a blessing to me and i thank god for it i believe i believe he's in glory today that was quite a number of years ago amen do god be the glory amen so brother sister there are those are there that are offering an excellent sacrifice there yeah excellent but the bride is offering more excellent amen because abel moffatt offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain if this was more excellent than cain's must have been excellent considering all that he had sacrificed and he had laid on the altar yeah all what he had grown and everything and we laid there like i said thanksgiving day is it it's a tremendous testimony of cain's seed the seed of cain because all that they'll lay on the altar for thanksgiving days oh my is this this this might be flowers and and vigils they grow on this and this oh i've seen it on the altars but what god wants is your you you want the altar amen praise the lord amen so brother not only that because of what abel offered he was righteous amen god saw righteousness and brother how righteous are you yeah well it's dependent on on on your faith right does god see your righteousness by faith you believe this you believe that you and and you're not just believing it by and saying oh yeah i believe it or i believe it yeah well go show me don't tell me show me amen by the grace of god and by faith enoch was translated praise the lord that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god with what faith he believed amen what god revealed he believed well god revealed he kept and fed on amen praise the lord so he said why verse six he said without faith it is impossible to please him i don't care what you do brother if you're not going by faith you don't please god you can do this you can do this you can do that but is it faith or is you you're just just your nature good nature no if it's a holy ghost nature it's going to be faith god did him with you god leading you sons and daughters of god led by the spirit of god amen and it's by faith amen so that amen you're not going to do what you want to do you're going to do what god wants you to do amen but there's 2 million too many today so-called believers they're just doing what they want to do and they think oh god thank you for the message yeah thank god for the message the lord the lord will appreciate it if you're going to surrender to it don't appreciate it if you're going to let the message control you amen so there's not you that lives as christ the word living in you so he said without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him not just seek him but you seek him diligently amen god of us to pay attention to the word amen god help us to bring ourselves in line with the word amen because god is going to judge you by the word amen brother so are we diligently seeking him amen and do we have the faith that pleases him god have mercy on us i believe that gentleman of that anakin church that time a few years ago he had the faith that pleased god amen again because this is this is where god was dealing with him down there this is where god's dealing with somebody else up here and you and me further up oh i said thank you jesus for that revelation amen so brother grace that we have the faith that pleases god amen for he that cometh to god must believe that he is amen not he was and will be he is present tense and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently how many of us here are diligent in our faith most believers are not they started out diligent oh yes definitely years ago but then there's fewer and fewer and fewer who are really diligent they're really caught up with the word and lord i want more of your word i want more of the faith for the resurrection rapture lord i pray in the name of jesus don't let it become too common to me amen because that's what happened to those in luther's day wesley's age the pentecostal age it became too common just doctrine just this it was a creed and as i said these books are the creed that a lot of believers believe they believe the doctrine yeah but brother what god wants to be in control of you your your everyday living amen he wants to live out his life through you by the grace of god amen turn with me to the book of acts have to give you a couple more scriptures the book of acts chapter 15. amen let's start at verse 1. oh my lord again whether the faith that pleases god is god hidden and revealed in simplicity amen you're not going to show off oh i i believe this i believe that you explain this make a big big big bigger than what it really is the power of god said don't do that he said don't make it bigger than what it is and don't make it smaller than what it is leave it the way that it is amen and yet there are those out there and breathing is under a false anointing they are making the message bigger than what it is or they're making it smaller than what it is but god wants those that are just leaving it the way that it is and walk in the light amen and show that the word is made flesh in them and that not just made flesh but the word is in control of you amen it's one thing for you to change the way you dress and act and and so on but he wants to be in control of you in leading you what is is god going to lead you to what you do today i pray god he's grace that he's in control are you gonna be found in the will of god today are you gonna be found in the will of god tomorrow oh yeah i'm just gonna do what god wants me to do god help us that's that's a tremendous challenge to us amen so in acts 15 and certain men which came down from judea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved when therefore paul and barnabas add so small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem under the apostles and elders about this question and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phineas and samaria declaring the conversation of of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren when and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them amen giving god the premise in their lives oh how many are really living for god how many really want to give god the glory how many really want to testify to what he's done for you today what he did for you yesterday and what you believe he's going to do tomorrow yeah giving god preeminence amen not just he's a thought he's a good thought and oh god did this i believe this and i believe that no he's your lord he's your savior amen is your fellowship and it says and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done done unto them well if you did it what are you going to say god did to you what's your testimony what has god done for you today what did he do for you yesterday do you have any proof that he's with you and he's in you and he was leading you grace but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe and god which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us amen and put no difference between us and them or the jew or the gentile there was no difference he said purifying their hearts by faith amen for the jew they felt it was circumcision but brother it was for the jew faith what he was looking for this is what god wanted in the jews oh they said well we did this we did that yeah we can go and say we did this we did that but what god's looking for in you is his faith do you have faith real genuine holy ghost faith amen controlling your thoughts your words your deeds and he's your leader you do nothing without consulting the lord in all thy ways acknowledge him amen by the grace of god but yet there's too many believers they're still doing their own thing and saying we believe the message we believe that but brother outside the church and just when they're when they're going to say this and say that oh yeah but then when it comes to the rest of their days and the rest of their weeks or months or years they're going to do what they want to do not what god wants them to do god help us it's a challenge a challenge a challenge to our faith brother do we have the faith that pleases god you can have faith that pleases your your preacher you're gonna have faith that pleases you your wife you're gonna have faith that pleases your husband oh yeah mom and dad oh yeah that's my faith but does it please god amen how many are really stopping to consider their faith lord does this please you am i in your will please lord grace of god again it's like the story i told you about sister burns that she was washing the clothes that time and and for two hours i believe it was the devil that talked to her the devil was discouraging her and one of the reasons might have been because she spent so many hours in her house alone that was when brother barnes was working still working and my brother sister her the doors were locked when she went to bed they were they're locked when she got up they were locked through the day locked when she went to bed again oh yeah because nobody came to visit her yeah amazing but then amen the devil went down downtown until amen like the problem of gods that didn't struck you struck his heart and her and her heart and her faith she said get the behind me satan amen and she said the atmosphere went from dark to light amen praise the lord amen verse 8 says and god which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith brother not a physical circumcision but spiritual in our hearts amen grace of god then go to first corinthians chapter 16. i'll try to give you another couple of scriptures and then we'll move on to another service first corinthians chapter 16. and what i'm showing you by the word is the emphasis that's put on faith pay day faith amen not just on your professing christian and you're separated from this separate from that again is like i said when i was needing at the altar and that other believer next to me was praying and thanking god for deliverance out of denominations and she said now she said we don't have to be subject to any man i said lord she needs a revelation i so i pray lord that you'll deal with her in her heart because she felt that that was to her that was the uh that was the oh the blessing of coming out of a church i don't have to submit to this one but yet yet in questions and answers i said i'm the seals and the prophet someone asked brother brown brother branham does the bride have a ministry he said yes it's been there he said ever since the day of pentecost and he said it's a fightful ministry and he said is this this and this and this he and he and he read it and so on but yet there there's believers today feeling that since we come to the message oh we don't have to be we don't have to be subject to this we don't have to do that oh yes you do the brother that that'd be an evidence of your faith that you really got faith in your heart amen because you're going to line up with the word by the grace of god amen so brother that that's not going to change the will of god so you you don't have to be subject to a pastor you'd rather be subject to this one or that one no no definitely not i'll tell you this if you've got the holy ghost and you've got a holy lord's faith you're going to be more subject oh you're going to be you're going to be there to surrender by the grace of god amen again are you are you willing even in this issue are you willing to say not my will thine be done amen exactly grace of god no there's too many doing their own will but not god's will yeah grace of god amen again in first corinthians 16 let's see let's read start read verse 12. as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time while you go you should go even when the time is not convenient it's according to the will of god and he said watch ye stand fast in the faith amen and quit ye you like men be strong and let all your doings be done with charity divine love amen watch and stand fast in the faith to follow god's leadership not what you feel not what you want to do what god wants you to do when and where he wants you to do it amen we'll go to one other scripture here and that's in romans chapter one go back a couple of books to romans chapter one amen praise the name of the lord thank you jesus romans chapter 1 verse 1 paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated under the gospel of god amen we're separated under the gospel amen which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son jesus christ our lord amen that's all he's your savior is he your lord and to be lord he's in control which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith brother all the way through the new testament the emphasis is put on faith pay faith amen for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name among whom are ye also the call of jesus christ and to all that be in rome beloved of god called to this be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ for i first i thank my god through jesus christ for you that your faith your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world amen so is our faith spoken of amen not just not just doctrine but the life that we live the life that god is living out through you and me amen it says that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son and with that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers praise the lord hallelujah why hallelujah because our faith is spoken of throughout the world by the grace of god go with me to verse 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation amen the power of god unto salvation and for us it is the power of god unto the resurrection and the rapture considering what god has done what god is doing amen so i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed amen from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith amen all through the ages the emphasis is faith and faith that pleases god by the grace of god amen we'll have to stop there praise the name of the lord hallelujah in the message perfect faith he did say jesus had perfect faith he had it and it became and it come because he was the word and you become the word and you become the you become the word and you receive the word and if you abide in me and my words abide in you amen he said ask what you will and it shall be done for you amen when you pray believe that you receive what you asked for and ye shall have it and it will be given to you if we got a true genuine faith amen not just going by the letter of the word but in but it's in your heart amen it's the revelation of god in your soul amen praise the lord and he said now he said watch if you abide in me and my word in you you can ask what you will and it will be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer and see that you've got to recognize your position as erect jesus recognize his position amen god help us to recognize who we are brother it wasn't man it was god it wasn't william branham it was god and god for the prophet didn't reveal everything because the problem of god did tell us that he had a lot of things that he could tell us but he said he they'll be with me when i go to my grave he said they'll be in my heart amen but i believe god that god is is revealing to to us now amen what the prophet took what took with him to his grave amen and he's showing us how serious everything is god help us to believe he said if you are a believer you should recognize yourself as a believer recognize that these things are for you if there's condemnation in your life you should straighten that out first amen then god will god is going to honor your faith amen and you should god help us he said peter was doing all right till he got scared and the word told him he could walk on the water he was scared first and he thought it oh he said lord if it be you bid me to come to you on the water help us not to believe lord not to disbelieve brother but to believe with a complete belief amen peter started out jesus had come wow the water was calm and oh okay lord i'm going to come walk why in the world would he get frayed because the water got a little bit rough and he doubted oh yeah lord as long as you're in our lives and you're doing this everything is going good that's good lord i i believe you but then maybe sometimes god lets things get rough you know like the waters that peter stood on sometimes the waters of our life would get rough sure are we gonna are we gonna still leave it with god and keep walking amen praise the lord wonderful i pray the lord help us amen no matter how rough it gets that we're going to still believe him we're going to still trust him amen in all thy ways acknowledge him by the grace of god hallelujah amen he said he was scared oh he thought it was a ghost he said and he said lord if it be you bid me to come on to you on the water and say come on and that's just the same as james 5 14 the same as mark 16. it's the same god that said it come on and so he started walking and he done all right and got down out of the ship and started walking but when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared and he said what come in his mind first thing i'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk and the next thing he said well he look at his symptoms yeah but you don't look at your symptoms stay with the promise yeah stay with the promise amen praise the lord when he believed he could walk and he walked but god but he rather he got scared in his belief then his substance left him see that's right amen and he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance amen whereas paul was saying that faith is the substance of things over and the evidence of things not seen praise the lord amen the substance would have went all right over the top of that white cap and went right on to him oh yeah he could if he didn't if he didn't worry about it well if he started he would finish this is amazing that he started and he walked on the water yeah and and he moved on toward jesus but then all of a sudden maybe he just saw maybe behind jesus or to the or to the right oh he saw this wave coming up coming up and he got scared but jesus wasn't scared jesus was still walking come on no he sunk and jesus said to take him by the hand lift them up amen to god be the glory amen brother if it is god's will just trust the lord and keep claiming the promise amen and pleading the blood of jesus amen oh my praise the lord he said the substance would have went right over the top of that weight cap and went right on to him see if he has the perfect faith but he didn't have it i pray and i'll tell you whether we need anything to go from time to eternity we need anything to get out of here and into the rapture it's perfect faith amen and brother god has the the revelation of the word in these days and the rev the opening of the word the opening of the seventh seals is to give us the perfect faith for the rapture yeah what god did brothers not just to say he did this he did this he did this he did it for a reason he did it for a reason that not because the bible says he's going to do it bible says he's going to do it why was he going to do it and why did he do it was to give us perfect faith for the rapture amen but how many are really really believing with that perfect faith god help us and they have really put their lives into the hands of god amen soul body and spirit lord it's all under your control not my will thine be done so we're going to come more and more to that position as time goes on and brother just think of the world we're living in now that our the whole world is controlled by covid19 just think it's just not just not america it's just not canada just not the western world it's the whole world they're all governed by these rules by these regulations they're changing this changing that and i know things are getting even more strict and more strict in in ontario getting more strict in british columbia getting more and more strict yes in in quebec and and other parts and other places around the world yeah knowing that just think there's been so many you know thousands of people that have been fined an issue is issued this and they got to pay pay this to the government pay that to the government why because they didn't do what the government ordered them to do when they went from one country to another they didn't do what the government wanted to do when they came out of that country and into canada oh yeah and there are so many hundred and hundred and hundred and maybe thousands that are that are being sued for so many thousand dollars god have mercy i pray we're seeing the seriousness of it of the world in which we live what would grandmother and grandfather think if they came back to this world they would want to get out and get out of it again they would want to stay not by any means so i pray god i pray god that we're not going to take for granted and not going to take it lightly always just as just this it's just this brother there's more to it than just this the devil has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short it's serious i pray god will not take it for granted but when we see these things look up because your redemption draw at night amen oh yeah brother if you don't let god separate you from the world the flesh and the devil god's gonna god's gonna allow all these things to happen to put more pressure on you see if you're going to yield to him and his leadership amen so that he's going to he wants more and more and more control of your life amen it's not you can oh just believe in the message believe in the word believe this doctrine this this doctrine no you've got to believe god and follow his leadership all down through brother the faith that god looks for is faith that believes him faith that trusts him faith that'll follow his leadership and his counsel but it's too many saying yeah i believe the message so that's all i got to do now amen i'm just waiting for the rapture but god's going to let a lot of things happen in the world to bring out real faith real faith amen he's going to put it on your doorstep to bring the real faith oh it's coming down it's going to get like i said it's getting worse and there's things that are going to and more serious is going to happen amen brother he knows what he got to do to bring out that faith he knows what he got to do to get you to yield to him he knows what he got to do to get you to that place where jesus came not my will time be done amen amen he's going to bring it out he allowed this to happen that will happen and maybe brother you get to a place where you know your life is at stake and and there's nothing you can do oh my lord not my will thine be done it's beyond my control is beyond my brother's control my sister's control lord jesus we're just following your leadership and we're going to look up lord because you told us that when we see these things happen our redemption draws not it's closer to what we think i pray god we're not going to be among not be left here looking for the rapture as the prophet said they'll be looking for the rapture say oh i thought there was to be a rapture yes it's already happened and you didn't
