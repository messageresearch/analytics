[36:22] little more of you inside of us lord
[36:23] that you kick a little more of us out

[37:04] where they are
[37:05] lord we give this now to you in jesus
[37:07] christ's name we're praying it
[37:09] amen
[37:10] amen god bless you thank you musicians
[37:12] that'll be it this evening
[37:14] amen if you'll turn in the scriptures to
[37:16] matthew chapter 6
[37:19] and then matthew chapter 6 we we start a
[37:22] new series tonight
[37:25] i don't know if anybody's excited about
[37:26] it but we're going to start a new series
[37:29] i'm excited about it
[37:31] and a little nervous
[37:34] amen matthew chapter 6 immense good to
[37:36] have the
[37:38] the right side loaded up here tonight i
[37:40] i expect great things from the right
[37:42] side of the church and uh
[37:44] the left side
[37:45] it's uh
[37:46] the left side you guys are going to have
[37:48] some heavy lifting to do here tonight
[37:50] but
[37:50] amen
[37:52] we can do all things through christ
[37:53] which strengthens us amen matthew 6 very
[37:56] familiar scripture it says after this
[37:57] manner therefore pray ye
[37:59] this is jesus speaking our father which
[38:02] art in heaven
[38:03] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[38:06] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[38:08] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[38:11] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[38:13] our debtors and lead us not into
[38:16] temptation but deliver us from evil
[38:18] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[38:21] and the glory forever
[38:24] amen amen you can have your seats this
[38:26] evening may god bless the reading of his
[38:28] word like i said i want to start a new
[38:30] series here tonight and this has been on
[38:32] my heart it's it's kind of tough when
[38:33] you're preaching this a series but you
[38:35] know that it's got to end and so you're
[38:37] looking for the mind of the lord and
[38:39] you're praying and dwelling on things
[38:40] and you're getting pieces here and there
[38:42] and it's kind of only just in the last
[38:43] couple of
[38:44] weeks maybe the last month that it
[38:46] started to form a bit of a picture and
[38:49] i'm in anticipation for this i'm a
[38:50] little nervous this is going to be very
[38:52] practical it's going to be very personal
[38:54] and any time it gets personal it always
[38:56] gets awkward amen and and the thing is
[38:59] that some of our some of our things that
[39:01] uh that we are and the way we are is
[39:03] very outward and so when the minister
[39:05] starts speaking you can think that he's
[39:06] preaching to you and guess what
[39:08] sometimes he is
[39:10] amen but usually he's speaking to
[39:13] himself and god has dealt with him on it
[39:16] and those sorts of things so
[39:17] this shouldn't be an uncomfortable
[39:19] service here today but i guarantee you
[39:20] there will be moments of
[39:21] uncomfortableness in the next few months
[39:23] by god's grace amen but if i step on
[39:25] your toes then just know that he stepped
[39:28] on mind probably before he stepped on
[39:29] your yours amen it's like i said it's
[39:31] going to be very practical we'll be
[39:33] getting down into our day-to-day lives
[39:34] into the very core of our being what we
[39:36] do how we spend our time uh what we're
[39:38] building on this earth
[39:40] you know the way that we reflect christ
[39:42] and and the words we say the things we
[39:44] do the images we project uh the
[39:46] reputation we develop all of these
[39:47] things we're going to be digging deep
[39:49] into that amen but maybe an interesting
[39:51] way to start it is with the lord's
[39:52] prayer and i want to take from that
[39:55] a series called thy kingdom come
[39:57] and i want to preach tonight on on earth
[40:00] as it is
[40:01] in heaven amen now let's go back to the
[40:03] scriptures and if you'll hold your place
[40:05] there in matthew but i'm going to go to
[40:06] luke 11 because luke 11 tells us why
[40:09] jesus gave this prayer amen he's going
[40:11] to this is this is why he he went into
[40:14] this and and it says in luke 11 and it
[40:16] came to pass that as he was praying in a
[40:18] certain place when he ceased one of his
[40:21] disciples said unto him lord teach us to
[40:23] pray as john also taught his disciples
[40:27] amen so the reason that jesus comes and
[40:29] gives us the lord's prayer somebody
[40:30] comes and says lord we see you praying
[40:33] how do you do it tell us how you do it
[40:36] teach us how to talk to god they said
[40:38] john came the prophets came and and and
[40:40] they taught their disciples but now
[40:42] you're here and we want to know how it
[40:43] is that you have effective communication
[40:45] with god we want to know how it is that
[40:47] you approach god we want to know how it
[40:49] is that you go before god how your
[40:51] relationship is there show us how to do
[40:53] it so that we can have the same effect
[40:54] with our prayer life as you seem to have
[40:56] with yours and then there's a desire in
[40:58] their heart there to see what in their
[41:00] life what they saw with jesus amen
[41:04] so we're praying people amen we're
[41:06] praying people as believers as
[41:07] christians we're a praying people and so
[41:09] we ought to be able to fit our prayers
[41:11] within the prayer that jesus gives us
[41:13] here amen so if we go to matthew 6 and
[41:16] verse 9 says after this manner therefore
[41:18] pray ye our father which art in heaven
[41:21] hallowed be thy name and we're going to
[41:23] spend the next half of the service on
[41:25] just this this portion here there's so
[41:27] much in here it's so deep but i want to
[41:29] start with the first bit and it says our
[41:31] father because the the the basis of
[41:34] prayer is always relationship amen that
[41:37] you have to know that you are talking to
[41:39] somebody that is related to you that has
[41:41] made you a relation to him that he is
[41:43] your father that he is not just somebody
[41:45] else's father but he is your father that
[41:47] he is your god and you're coming to him
[41:49] because you are a child of his amen you
[41:52] call him father because you are his
[41:54] child you cannot call him father if you
[41:56] are somebody else's child amen so the
[41:58] first
[41:59] the first approach is always on the
[42:00] basis of relationship and that he is
[42:02] yours and not just somebody else's
[42:05] but then he says what which art in
[42:07] heaven
[42:08] now this is our father but it's looking
[42:09] and it's showing the sovereignty of god
[42:12] and his position in relation to ours as
[42:14] we sit here on this earth and that's
[42:16] that he is in a position of control he
[42:18] is in a position of authority he's in a
[42:21] position of sovereignty that is above
[42:23] where we are right now amen we are down
[42:25] here and he is up there and this is a
[42:27] submissive admission that he is your god
[42:30] and not just your father amen that he is
[42:33] the one that you answer to and he is the
[42:35] one you look to and he is the one that
[42:37] you're going to put in the highest place
[42:39] of preeminence in your life amen in
[42:42] heaven is where he reigns amen but the
[42:44] other thing i want you to catch here is
[42:46] that our relationship because he is in
[42:47] heaven is going to be in the heavenlies
[42:49] amen it is going to be supernatural it
[42:52] is going to be spiritual it is not going
[42:54] to be a physical relation such as we
[42:56] have on here with the people around us
[42:58] that doesn't mean you can't have a
[43:00] physical relationship in that you can
[43:02] feel them with your five senses that you
[43:03] can't talk to them through your inner
[43:04] five senses and these different things
[43:06] but rather this is still a relationship
[43:08] that is not the same as what you have
[43:10] here on this earth that you do not
[43:11] connect to him you do not touch him the
[43:13] way that you touch him and connect with
[43:15] somebody here but it is through a
[43:17] heavenly relationship that you're going
[43:18] to be contacting him amen
[43:20] but he says now after that he says
[43:22] hallowed be thy name
[43:24] and this is where we get into the crux
[43:26] of why we pray this way that word hallow
[43:28] means keep holy
[43:30] to separate from profane things and
[43:33] dedicate to god to consecrate to
[43:36] sanctify and to purify so what he's
[43:40] saying here is our prayer should be lord
[43:42] keep your name holy keep your name pure
[43:45] keep your name separate from sinful and
[43:48] ungodly things
[43:49] now why is that so important why do we
[43:51] need to pray to god to keep his name
[43:53] clean
[43:54] and why are we so concerned about it why
[43:56] is that something we should be praying
[43:57] it seems like that should be god's
[43:59] problem not our problem amen i don't go
[44:01] around telling you to keep my name clean
[44:03] i'm responsible for my own name aren't i
[44:05] amen and brother ali is responsible for
[44:07] his name and brother bob's for his name
[44:09] or brother mark's for his name i don't
[44:10] go around saying brother mark let me
[44:12] keep your name clean brother mark keep
[44:14] your name clean that's not my prayer my
[44:15] prayer is lord keep me clean amen and he
[44:17] takes care of his name and his family
[44:19] and i keep care of my name and my family
[44:21] amen
[44:22] but before we can understand why we have
[44:24] to pray lord keep your name holy we have
[44:26] to understand what that name is and why
[44:28] it's important
[44:29] and then so if we go back to john 5 the
[44:31] question that you want to ask here is
[44:32] what is the father's name
[44:34] what is the name of god if you went and
[44:36] asked that in denominations today you
[44:38] get a lot of different answers right
[44:40] they'd say his name is jehovah and they
[44:41] go into the redemptive names of of god
[44:44] and they they go into yahweh and yeshua
[44:46] and all these different things you get
[44:47] all these sort of different answers but
[44:49] we have to go to the scripture to say
[44:50] what is god's name
[44:51] so john 5 39 says search the scriptures
[44:54] for in them ye think ye have eternal
[44:56] life and they are they which testify of
[44:59] me
[45:00] but ye will not come to me that ye might
[45:01] have life i receive not honor from men
[45:04] but i know you that you have not the
[45:06] love of god in you
[45:08] i am come in my father's name
[45:11] jesus comes in his father's name and you
[45:13] receive me not and if another shall come
[45:16] in his own name him will ye receive
[45:19] philippians 2 10 says that at the name
[45:21] of jesus every knee should bow of things
[45:25] in heaven of things in earth and of
[45:27] things under the earth
[45:30] colossians 3 17 says and whatsoever you
[45:32] do in word or deed do all in the name of
[45:35] the lord jesus giving thanks to god and
[45:38] the father by him
[45:40] amen so what is the name of jesus what
[45:42] is the name of god the name of god is
[45:45] jesus
[45:46] it has to be because jesus said i come
[45:48] in my father's name and everything that
[45:50] we do after jesus comes is in the name
[45:52] of jesus now god will not share his
[45:54] glory with anyone else god will not put
[45:56] somebody else ahead of him so if he's
[45:58] saying to do everything in my name that
[46:00] has to be the name of god i'm in the
[46:01] name of god is jesus
[46:03] brother brahm says this he says god put
[46:05] his name in jesus brother matt thanks
[46:06] for getting this all worked out it's
[46:08] working beautifully thank you i
[46:09] appreciate it
[46:10] god put his name in jesus do you believe
[46:13] that he was the son of god and every son
[46:15] comes in his father's name he said i
[46:17] come in my father's name and you receive
[46:19] me not i come in my father's name you
[46:21] come in your father's name amen we have
[46:24] people that are coming in the colombo
[46:25] name we have people that are coming in
[46:27] the coffee name we have people that are
[46:28] coming in the curlet name
[46:30] right each one of us comes in the name
[46:32] of what our father and he says jesus is
[46:34] no different jesus come in his father's
[46:36] name so his father's name is jesus
[46:40] amen that's the only thing that we
[46:41] identify god with amen
[46:43] so you say okay we pray that jesus name
[46:45] will be kept pure holy and undefiled
[46:48] but jesus name is already pure holy and
[46:50] undefiled why are we having to pray for
[46:52] jesus name to be hallowed for it to be
[46:54] holy for it to be kept separate and
[46:55] clean and pure in these different things
[46:58] but remember he didn't say hallowed be
[47:00] thou
[47:00] he said hallow be thy name amen there's
[47:04] something attached to his name there's
[47:06] something identified with his name that
[47:07] has to be kept holy there's something
[47:09] attached to his name that has to be kept
[47:11] clean there's something attached to his
[47:12] name that has to be kept pure and it's
[47:15] something that we have to keep in prayer
[47:16] in order to keep it that way if i can
[47:18] put it that way
[47:20] let's see if we dig deeper into the
[47:22] scriptures here i'm just setting a
[47:23] foundation tonight this will be more
[47:25] teaching than anything just setting a
[47:27] foundation for where we'll go over the
[47:28] next few months
[47:29] and then we're looking at what is god's
[47:31] name
[47:32] and why does something have to be kept
[47:33] holy that's attached to god's name
[47:36] first kings 9 it says and it came to
[47:38] pass when solomon had finished the
[47:39] building of the house of the lord in the
[47:41] king's house and all solomon's desire
[47:43] which he was pleased to do that the lord
[47:45] appeared to solomon the second time as
[47:48] he had appeared unto him at gibeon
[47:50] and the lord said unto him i have heard
[47:52] thy prayer and the supplication that
[47:55] thou has made before me now watch what
[47:57] he says here and i have hallowed this
[48:00] house
[48:02] this is solomon's temple he's built this
[48:03] is the greatest temple ever built in the
[48:06] jewish history
[48:07] he says i have hallowed this house which
[48:10] thou
[48:11] has built
[48:13] to put my name there forever
[48:16] and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
[48:18] thou permanent perpetually so solomon
[48:20] had built a permanent home
[48:23] for god to dwell in remember before this
[48:25] he dwelt in tents and tabernacles made
[48:27] of skin and cloth and all these
[48:29] different things but solomon comes and
[48:31] he takes all the materials that david
[48:32] have pulled together he gets more from
[48:34] his allies and he builds this beautiful
[48:37] tent out of or this beautiful temple out
[48:39] of stone and cedar wood and he has it
[48:41] overlaid with gold and all these
[48:42] precious things and he builds the most
[48:44] beautiful temple that the jews have ever
[48:46] seen amen and now god comes down after
[48:49] this is done he says i am so pleased
[48:51] with what you've done
[48:53] now why was he why was he pleased with
[48:55] it he was pleased with it because it was
[48:57] built according to the order that god
[48:59] had given moses in the first place moses
[49:01] did not build a temple of his way of his
[49:04] thinking of his preference but he built
[49:06] it according to the standard that god
[49:08] had given moses for the temple in the
[49:10] wilderness and the difference was he
[49:12] built it out of something permanent
[49:13] stone rather than something that could
[49:15] be lifted up and taken and moved day by
[49:17] day amen but he built it according to
[49:20] the the blueprint of god
[49:22] and god says i'm pleased with it because
[49:25] you've done it the way i told you and
[49:27] you did it out of your own heart's
[49:29] desire
[49:30] that i didn't force you to do it but
[49:32] rather you had a desire to build
[49:34] something for me in my blueprint and my
[49:37] pattern and he says i'm so happy with
[49:39] this that i'm going to put my name on
[49:41] this temple and i'm going to let it be
[49:43] known that this is the place where you
[49:45] can worship me this is the place where
[49:47] you can find me this is the place where
[49:49] i will be anytime you need to come get
[49:51] me remember they could turn their eyes
[49:53] at any time towards jerusalem and that
[49:55] temple and they could hear from god he
[49:57] said that's all they had to do was look
[49:59] to where he had put his name
[50:02] he's identified himself now with this
[50:04] temple amen
[50:05] now god's so pleased with it he says you
[50:07] built it he says but i have hallowed it
[50:10] i have made it how holy how did he make
[50:13] it holy
[50:14] it wasn't when he put his name there it
[50:15] was when he put his presence there and
[50:18] that's what allowed him to put his name
[50:20] there amen at our houses sometimes you
[50:22] see somebody that has a a name on their
[50:24] mailbox so they put a plaque on their
[50:26] house and says you know the curlettes
[50:28] the coffees the columbos and that
[50:30] identifies who's in that building and
[50:33] you know that if you go to that building
[50:35] and knock on the door who's going to
[50:36] answer a coffee a columbo or a curlet
[50:39] based on the name that's on the house
[50:40] and this is no different here amen
[50:42] that he's put his name there and said if
[50:44] you come knock on the door i'll answer
[50:46] you i'm going to dwell in this place
[50:49] amen the shekinah glory went behind the
[50:51] veil in there and if you remember when
[50:53] they when they when they dedicated that
[50:55] building the power of god came down so
[50:57] great that they couldn't even speak
[50:59] amen it was so powerful that the people
[51:01] were mute before the presence of god and
[51:03] then the holy spirit came down and that
[51:05] cloud came down remember it was an
[51:07] amazing time because they built it the
[51:09] way he wanted it built and he was
[51:10] pleased to come down and show himself
[51:12] and the people amen
[51:14] but if we look as the scripture
[51:16] continues that there are conditions to
[51:18] god keeping his name there
[51:20] right it's not just i'm going to put my
[51:21] name there and it'll be there
[51:22] perpetually but if we look at verse 4
[51:25] god starts to put some conditions on
[51:27] this because god's admonition to solomon
[51:29] is not just keep the temple pure but his
[51:32] admonition to solomon is solomon you've
[51:34] got a house to build now and you've got
[51:36] a kingdom you're trying to build and
[51:38] you've got a family to raise and you've
[51:40] got things you want to do and he's
[51:41] saying i want to dwell there as well
[51:44] i don't just want to dwell in the temple
[51:46] but i've got to dwell in the rest of
[51:47] your life as well you can't just put me
[51:49] in a box over here but solomon there's
[51:51] things you've got to do in your life to
[51:53] keep me in a place of worship that you
[51:55] have access to
[51:56] verse 4 says and if
[51:59] amen here's the condition if thou walk
[52:01] before me as david thy father walked in
[52:04] integrity of heart and in uprightness
[52:06] and do according to all that i have
[52:08] commanded thee and will keep my statutes
[52:10] and my judgments then
[52:12] in programming we have an if then
[52:14] statement right if you do this then then
[52:16] something else happens then i will
[52:18] establish the throne of thy kingdom upon
[52:20] israel forever as i promised to david
[52:23] thy father saying there shall not fail
[52:25] thee a man upon the throne of israel he
[52:27] says you can always stay in authority
[52:29] and kingship in israel if you'll follow
[52:33] the word if you'll serve me as your
[52:35] father serve me then your name will
[52:37] never leave the throne and if solomon
[52:39] had obeyed it they would still be on the
[52:40] throne today amen he says but if you
[52:44] shall turn at all from following me ye
[52:47] or your children and will not keep my
[52:50] commandments and my statutes which i
[52:52] have set before you but go and sower
[52:54] other gods and worship them then will i
[52:56] cut off israel out of the land which i
[52:59] have given them now it's not just
[53:01] solomon that's affected it's everybody
[53:03] that's under his authority is affected i
[53:06] want you to catch that it's going to be
[53:07] key as we move through everyone under
[53:09] authority of failed leadership gets
[53:11] pulled to the side
[53:14] then will i cut off israel out of the
[53:16] land which i have given them and this
[53:17] house which i have hallowed for my name
[53:19] will i cast out of my sight doesn't
[53:21] matter that's in my pattern if you're
[53:23] not serving me i'm not going to be in
[53:24] your midst that's what he's saying and
[53:26] israel shall be a proverb and a byword
[53:29] among all people in other words you guys
[53:31] will be has-beens you had it and you
[53:33] lost it and now it's no longer with you
[53:36] and you don't have a way back to get it
[53:37] amen
[53:38] what he's saying is he's saying solomon
[53:40] the temple's great
[53:41] i love this i love the temple i
[53:43] appreciate it thank you for the temple
[53:44] but i'm more concerned about the temple
[53:46] that you're building amen i'm more
[53:47] concerned about the kingdom that you're
[53:49] building and whether or not you'll serve
[53:50] me than i am about this beautiful temple
[53:53] that you've built me amen but he says if
[53:55] you'll stay with the word i'll be there
[53:56] for your praise i'll be there for your
[53:58] worship i'll be there for your prayer
[53:59] i'll be there for your need i'll be
[54:01] there for your defense i'll be there for
[54:02] your victory i'll be there for your
[54:04] strength i'll be there for your
[54:05] encouragement i'll be there for your joy
[54:07] i'll be in the midst of all of you if
[54:09] you will stay with the word
[54:11] but if you don't then you'll be a
[54:12] has-been
[54:14] it's that it'll be as if you never had
[54:16] me in the first place
[54:17] that's a scary place to be having tasted
[54:20] of the heavenly gift amen but not able
[54:22] to renew yourself unto repentance again
[54:24] amen
[54:25] amen so we see there is a place where
[54:27] god puts his name so this is we go to
[54:30] the old testament to see the type and
[54:31] shadow right and then we'll go into the
[54:33] new testament to see the fulfillment of
[54:34] that in a different way man but there's
[54:36] a place where god puts his name and it's
[54:38] a place of worship
[54:40] it's a place of sanctuary remember you
[54:42] could go in and lay hold on the horns of
[54:43] the altar and they could not take you
[54:45] out and they could not touch you unless
[54:47] you had shed innocent blood
[54:49] otherwise you could stay in there and
[54:50] they couldn't take you out amen it's a
[54:52] place of rest it's a place of direction
[54:54] it's a place of leadership amen but it's
[54:57] reliant on whether the life you're
[54:59] living is in accordance with the word of
[55:00] god amen what is it god's saying i'll
[55:03] put my name wherever i am giving full
[55:06] and complete preeminence
[55:08] that's what he's looking for amen and we
[55:09] know that eventually solomon failed
[55:12] why did solomon fail solomon failed when
[55:14] he tried to build the kingdom according
[55:16] to the way everyone else built the
[55:17] kingdom when he started taking on
[55:19] alliances to strengthen the kingdom and
[55:22] what did that do that caused strange
[55:24] marriages with women that did not serve
[55:26] god and they turned his head from what
[55:29] worship eventually he allowed them to
[55:31] worship their way in his house and that
[55:34] eventually caused him to do the things
[55:36] that he shouldn't be doing he allowed
[55:37] what strange gods in he allowed strange
[55:39] beliefs he allowed strange doctrines he
[55:41] allowed different influences he allowed
[55:43] political alliances he allowed things
[55:45] from the outside world to come in and
[55:46] start to dictate the way he lived his
[55:48] life and it eventually it pulled him off
[55:50] of the word of god amen
[55:52] and what happened after he dies god
[55:54] destroys his kingdom and then it splits
[55:56] up because his son decides to listen to
[55:58] young counselors instead of wise
[56:00] counselors and he says you know they
[56:02] whipped you with this but i'm going to
[56:03] whip you with scorpions and these
[56:04] different things and he listens to young
[56:07] hotbloods that thought they knew
[56:08] something rather than the wise elders if
[56:10] you remember and so what the kingdom
[56:12] split off them they said you can't be
[56:13] king so now you've got rhea bowman
[56:15] jeroboam believe and then from there it
[56:16] just declines steadily and one's going
[56:18] into slavery and then the next one's
[56:19] conquered and they're fighting
[56:20] themselves half the time and the kingdom
[56:23] eventually splits into one big mess they
[56:24] go into slavery they get pulled back
[56:26] eventually they rebuild the temple but
[56:28] they never get the glory back that they
[56:30] had in those days amen god was still in
[56:33] the temple when they rebuilt it but it
[56:35] was not in the way it was before and it
[56:37] was this constant back and forth this up
[56:39] and down in their life amen
[56:41] and that goes all the way until jesus
[56:42] comes on earth and then jesus comes on
[56:45] earth and he meets the woman at the well
[56:47] in samaria and they start talking about
[56:48] worship and where we can meet god
[56:51] now listen to this this is john 4 it
[56:52] says this is a woman at the well
[56:54] speaking she says our fathers worshiped
[56:56] in this mountain and ye say that in
[56:59] jerusalem is the place where men ought
[57:00] to worship why because he said that's
[57:02] the place that i'm putting my name and
[57:04] if you turn towards that temple and pray
[57:05] i'll hear you so she says you say we've
[57:07] got to pray in jerusalem we have prayed
[57:10] on this mountain she says who's right
[57:12] and jesus saith unto her woman believe
[57:15] me the hour cometh when ye shall neither
[57:17] in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[57:19] worship the father
[57:21] ye worship ye know not what and we know
[57:24] what we worship for salvation is of the
[57:26] jews
[57:27] but the hour cometh and now is
[57:32] that the true worship when the true
[57:33] worshipers shall worship the father in
[57:36] spirit and in truth for the father seek
[57:40] as such to worship him amen in other
[57:42] words
[57:43] time
[57:44] is changing
[57:45] now is a time of change he says the time
[57:48] is coming and now is this is a time of
[57:50] transition of worship this is a time of
[57:53] transition of where i've put my name
[57:56] he says it's someplace else even now and
[57:59] when when in the in the very short term
[58:02] it's going to move even from there and
[58:04] it won't matter where you are
[58:06] something else is going to be where his
[58:07] name is and you're going to have to know
[58:09] where that name is because that's the
[58:10] only way you can worship him is if you
[58:12] know where his name is
[58:14] he says god is a spirit
[58:16] and they that worship him must worship
[58:18] him in spirit and in truth
[58:21] in contrast rather than in a temple made
[58:23] with stone
[58:24] what he's saying is you don't now get to
[58:26] worship because you came to the place
[58:27] where i am now there's going to be a
[58:28] requirement of you and it's that you
[58:30] worship me in spirit and in truth
[58:33] you've got to have a life and you've got
[58:35] to have it right
[58:36] there's two things you can't just have
[58:37] it right if you have the spirit you'll
[58:39] get it right but if you don't have the
[58:40] spirit you'll still get it wrong even if
[58:42] you think you know what's right amen
[58:44] amen so then christ comes and he dies
[58:47] and we get a full transition don't we
[58:49] because the what happens in the temple
[58:50] is the veil is torn from top to bottom
[58:53] showing that god had torn the veil not a
[58:55] man and that what ichabod was written
[58:58] over the door of the tabernacle now the
[59:00] glory of the god is departed
[59:02] and now there's no shekinah glory in the
[59:04] temple
[59:05] now what happens after that
[59:07] the priests go and they sew that curtain
[59:09] right back up and they go on pretending
[59:12] that the presence of god is behind the
[59:13] veil stone but guess what
[59:16] the man is no longer fresh
[59:18] they had to lie
[59:20] for hundreds and thousands of years
[59:23] they're still lying today the temple's
[59:25] not there but until the temple was
[59:26] destroyed they had to lie about the
[59:28] presence of god being in that temple
[59:30] because when they went back there there
[59:31] was no fresh mana anymore it had rotted
[59:34] there was no budding blossom almond
[59:36] almond rod there anymore right because
[59:38] remember in that presence the manna
[59:40] always stayed fresh and the almonds
[59:41] always budded didn't they they went back
[59:43] there and it was now a dried stick and a
[59:45] rotted maggoty mess that they would have
[59:46] had to clean out after a couple days
[59:48] after a day 24 hours after that 24 hours
[59:51] then they would have had maggots in the
[59:52] manna in there because there was a pot
[59:53] inside of the holy of holies remember
[59:56] right
[59:56] what is it teaching us don't pretend
[59:58] god's in your life amen if the if what
[1:00:01] you're getting is maggoty and messed up
[1:00:03] don't pretend that god's there go find
[1:00:05] where his name is supposed to be and
[1:00:06] that's where you'll find the place of
[1:00:08] worship amen
[1:00:09] you better know that he's in your life
[1:00:11] don't be sewing up something that's
[1:00:12] ripped up and say he's still there don't
[1:00:14] pretend i can't imagine what that meant
[1:00:16] to the young men that were in the
[1:00:17] priesthood then and they got to go in
[1:00:19] for the first time into what they felt
[1:00:21] was going to be the shekinah glory and
[1:00:22] it was nothing like the book of moses
[1:00:24] said it was supposed to be there was no
[1:00:26] presence there was no ah there was no
[1:00:27] fresh manna there was no almonds there
[1:00:29] was nothing it was dead back there and
[1:00:31] the priesthood had been lying to them
[1:00:33] the entire time about it can you imagine
[1:00:35] you get behind there and you realize
[1:00:36] god's not even here anymore what would
[1:00:38] that have done
[1:00:40] what would that have done to you amen
[1:00:43] amen what happened what god's name was
[1:00:44] in a temple building but then it moved
[1:00:46] into what a temple of flesh
[1:00:49] what did jesus say he says destroy this
[1:00:51] temple
[1:00:52] where was the name in this temple
[1:00:54] it says destroy this temple and i'll
[1:00:55] raise it up again in three days amen it
[1:00:57] moved into a temple of flesh and so when
[1:01:00] jesus christ walked the earth what
[1:01:01] happened god took his name off of a
[1:01:03] temple of stone and put it in a temple
[1:01:05] of flesh and that was god's name and you
[1:01:06] had to worship there but what happens
[1:01:08] when he leaves amen
[1:01:11] god was in a man's body but then christ
[1:01:13] dies where does the name go because he
[1:01:15] always has a place on earth for his name
[1:01:17] there's got to be a place
[1:01:20] look at the words in gethsemane when
[1:01:22] jesus is praying
[1:01:24] john 17 9 says i pray for them he's
[1:01:26] praying for us here
[1:01:28] i pray not for the world but for them
[1:01:29] which thou has given me for they are
[1:01:31] thine and all mine are thine and thine
[1:01:34] are mine and i am glorified in them and
[1:01:36] now i am no more in the world but these
[1:01:39] are in the world and i come to thee holy
[1:01:41] father keep through thine own name
[1:01:45] those whom now has given me that they
[1:01:48] may be one as we are
[1:01:51] he says while i was with them in the
[1:01:53] world i kept them in thy name
[1:01:57] that those that thou gave us me i have
[1:02:00] kept and none of them is lost but the
[1:02:02] son of perdition that the scripture
[1:02:03] might be fulfilled and now i come to
[1:02:06] thee and these things i speak in the
[1:02:08] world that they might have my joy
[1:02:10] fulfilled in themselves what was jesus
[1:02:14] joy scripture says he says my meat is to
[1:02:16] do that which the father sent me to do
[1:02:18] to do the father's will he says i want
[1:02:20] them to have joy in them the way i have
[1:02:22] joy in me
[1:02:24] the same thing
[1:02:25] he says
[1:02:26] now i come to thee and these i speak
[1:02:29] these things i speak in the world that
[1:02:30] they might have my joy fulfilled in
[1:02:32] themselves i have given them
[1:02:35] thy word
[1:02:36] and the world had hated them because
[1:02:38] they are not of the world even as i am
[1:02:40] not of the world
[1:02:42] i pray not that thou should take them
[1:02:44] out of the world but that thou should
[1:02:45] keep them from evil
[1:02:48] remember what the scriptures what we
[1:02:50] said hallowed be thy name keep your name
[1:02:52] holy keep it clean keep it pure he says
[1:02:54] they are not of the world even as i am
[1:02:56] not of the world sanctify them through
[1:02:59] thy truth and then he says thy word is
[1:03:02] truth as thou hast sent me into the
[1:03:04] world even so have i also sent them into
[1:03:07] the world and for their sakes i sanctify
[1:03:09] myself that they might also be
[1:03:11] sanctified
[1:03:13] made pure clean holy fit for service
[1:03:16] through the truth
[1:03:18] he says neither pray i for these alone
[1:03:20] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:03:22] me through their word there's a work
[1:03:24] coming and they're going to bring more
[1:03:25] people to him just as he brought them to
[1:03:27] god amen that they may all that they all
[1:03:31] may be one
[1:03:33] as thou father are to me and i in thee
[1:03:36] that they also may be one in us that the
[1:03:39] world may believe that thou hast sent me
[1:03:43] me
[1:03:44] there's a personal pronoun there he says
[1:03:46] that they may also be one in us
[1:03:50] that what the world may believe that
[1:03:52] thou has sent me amen they're gonna
[1:03:54] believe that christ came because of what
[1:03:56] we do he says and the glory which thou
[1:04:00] gavest me i have given them that they
[1:04:03] may be one even as we are one
[1:04:07] what's he doing jesus is teaching us to
[1:04:08] pray and he's saying lord god hallow
[1:04:11] your name sanctify your name make your
[1:04:12] name holy make your name separate make
[1:04:14] your name clean and then he comes along
[1:04:16] in the garden of gethsemane he says god
[1:04:19] i've kept your predestinated children in
[1:04:21] your name now sanctify them clean them
[1:04:25] up so they can serve you like i do
[1:04:27] and then they'll do it through the word
[1:04:29] that i've given them
[1:04:31] that's how he's going to keep his name
[1:04:32] clean but he's telling us pray that the
[1:04:34] name gets kept clean what in you
[1:04:37] right you're the one that has to be kept
[1:04:38] clean you're identified with his name
[1:04:40] you're identified with christ amen so
[1:04:43] you're the one that's got to pray that
[1:04:44] you don't make his name look bad
[1:04:47] because when people look at us they
[1:04:49] identify what that jesus has been with
[1:04:51] us amen that we profess christ and so
[1:04:54] we're identified with them so he says
[1:04:56] you've got to keep yourself under prayer
[1:04:57] that your life will be the reflection of
[1:04:59] him the way mine is in the exact same
[1:05:01] way
[1:05:03] what is it jesus leaves the earth and on
[1:05:05] the day of pentecost god puts his name
[1:05:07] in flesh once again amen what is it
[1:05:10] we do not replace jesus christ we are
[1:05:12] not a replacement
[1:05:14] catch that we do not replace christ we
[1:05:16] do not take that position in our lives
[1:05:18] amen but we get his name
[1:05:20] we get his name we are not him in the
[1:05:22] sense that we replace him but we are a
[1:05:24] portion of him amen we are a reflection
[1:05:26] of him as we'll see in a little bit amen
[1:05:28] he puts his quickening power inside of
[1:05:30] us and paul says we're now baptized into
[1:05:33] christ so we are him in the sense that
[1:05:35] we are a part of him but we are not
[1:05:38] everything of him amen he's the head and
[1:05:40] we are the rest if we can put it that
[1:05:42] way amen like we said before in the last
[1:05:44] series amen we go to him we are joined
[1:05:46] to him and he adds us to the body we've
[1:05:48] got to come to christ and then he places
[1:05:50] us within the body by the holy spirit
[1:05:53] paul says this in ephesians 3 for this
[1:05:55] cause i bow my knees unto the father of
[1:05:57] our lord jesus christ of whom the whole
[1:06:00] family in heaven and earth is named so
[1:06:03] there you are there we're named there's
[1:06:04] where the name is now is in us the name
[1:06:07] is in us and we're the reflection that
[1:06:10] has to be kept holy and clean and pure
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:13] amen you are bone of his bone and your
[1:06:15] flesh of his flesh you're a new creation
[1:06:16] you're a new creature in christ here
[1:06:19] he says that he would grant you
[1:06:21] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:06:23] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:06:26] in the inner man
[1:06:28] now the inner
[1:06:30] where is the inner veil amen it's the
[1:06:31] holy of holies in the temple he says you
[1:06:33] got to have that strength you got to
[1:06:34] have that presence in your holy of
[1:06:36] holies so you have strength to live out
[1:06:38] the life that you have need of to purely
[1:06:40] reflect christ's name amen he says why
[1:06:43] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:06:45] faith and that ye being rooted and
[1:06:47] grounded in love may be able to
[1:06:49] comprehend with all saints what is the
[1:06:52] breadth and the length and the depth and
[1:06:54] height and to know the love of christ
[1:06:57] which passes knowledge that ye might be
[1:06:59] filled with all the fullness of god
[1:07:03] remember he said lord put the glory and
[1:07:05] then that i had this is what he's saying
[1:07:08] he's saying this process this new
[1:07:10] creation that you become is to exactly
[1:07:13] do that is to express the fullness of
[1:07:15] god through a multi-member body called
[1:07:17] the bride
[1:07:19] and you've got to be able to reflect
[1:07:21] that on a day-by-day basis not just
[1:07:23] sunday and wednesday when we come to
[1:07:24] church but in everything that we do and
[1:07:26] say we want to be filled with the
[1:07:28] fullness of god so that that's what's
[1:07:29] being reflected and lived out inside of
[1:07:31] us amen amen
[1:07:33] so if we're filled with the fullness i'm
[1:07:34] guaranteeing you then the name comes
[1:07:36] with the fullness doesn't it
[1:07:37] and then the fullness in my family is
[1:07:39] going to be in is going to be reflected
[1:07:41] in my wife amen her and i together are
[1:07:44] the fullness of colette amen amen me
[1:07:46] without her is not is not complete and
[1:07:48] her without i am not complete i mean
[1:07:50] together we are the fullness the bride
[1:07:51] and the groom together is the fullness
[1:07:53] of god amen and we'll get into that a
[1:07:55] little deeper as we move further into
[1:07:56] the series
[1:07:58] brother or brother he is a brother
[1:08:00] brother paul
[1:08:02] says in first corinthians know ye not
[1:08:04] that ye are the temple of god and that
[1:08:07] the spirit of god dwelleth in you notice
[1:08:09] they keep saying temple temple temple
[1:08:11] they don't say this for no good reason
[1:08:13] why doesn't he just say house why
[1:08:15] doesn't he say tent why doesn't he just
[1:08:17] say dwelling place but they always say
[1:08:18] temple because he's pointing you back to
[1:08:20] god put his name in a temple and it was
[1:08:23] identified as a temple every time
[1:08:25] whether it was the tabernacle in the
[1:08:26] wilderness whether it was in christ who
[1:08:28] called himself a temple now paul says
[1:08:30] you're a temple in the same way because
[1:08:32] he puts his name in a temple every time
[1:08:34] and now it's in a temple of flesh inside
[1:08:36] of us amen that's why paul calls us
[1:08:39] temples is because it's a place
[1:08:40] dedicated to doing what worshiping god
[1:08:43] that's what a temple is it was a meeting
[1:08:45] place for god it was a place to worship
[1:08:47] god it was a place to give god praise
[1:08:48] and honor and glory amen
[1:08:51] ephesians 2 says for we are his
[1:08:53] workmanship created in christ jesus unto
[1:08:56] good works created in him unto good
[1:08:59] works which god had before ordained that
[1:09:01] we should walk in them here's a
[1:09:02] beautiful thing he's got a plan for
[1:09:04] everything that we're going to do every
[1:09:06] good work we're going to do good meaning
[1:09:07] it's of god he's got it planned out so
[1:09:10] there's something waiting for every one
[1:09:11] of us whether we realize it or not he's
[1:09:13] got a plan of good things of good works
[1:09:15] for us to do
[1:09:17] wherefore remember that ye been in times
[1:09:19] past gentiles in the flesh who are
[1:09:21] called uncircumcision by that which is
[1:09:23] called the circumcision in the flesh
[1:09:24] made by hands the jews said you're not a
[1:09:26] part of this is is what he's saying that
[1:09:29] at that time ye were without christ
[1:09:31] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[1:09:33] israel and strangers from the covenant
[1:09:35] of promise having no hope and without
[1:09:37] god in the world
[1:09:39] but now in christ ye who were sometimes
[1:09:43] who sometimes were far off are made nigh
[1:09:46] by the blood of christ for he is our
[1:09:48] peace who has made both one and had
[1:09:51] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:09:53] between us having abolished in his flesh
[1:09:56] the enmity even the law of commandments
[1:09:58] contained in ordinances for to make in
[1:10:01] himself of twain
[1:10:03] which is of two one new man he says i'm
[1:10:06] gonna make in myself what i'm gonna take
[1:10:09] one here and i'm gonna take one there
[1:10:11] and i'm gonna put them together and
[1:10:12] we're gonna be one again as we were in
[1:10:14] the beginning that's what he's taking us
[1:10:16] back to what do we have we have a bride
[1:10:18] and we have a bridegroom we have christ
[1:10:19] and mrs jesus christ coming together he
[1:10:21] says i'm going to make a new man out of
[1:10:23] all of this
[1:10:24] amen a new creation he says in doing so
[1:10:27] i'll be making peace
[1:10:28] and that he might reconcile both unto
[1:10:31] god in one body by the cross having
[1:10:33] slain the enmity thereby and came and
[1:10:36] preached peace to you which were far off
[1:10:38] and to them which were nigh for through
[1:10:40] him we both have access by one spirit
[1:10:43] unto the father
[1:10:46] he says now therefore ye are no more
[1:10:48] strangers and for foreigners but fellow
[1:10:51] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:10:53] household of god the temple of god
[1:10:56] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:10:58] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:11:00] himself being the chief cornerstone
[1:11:03] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:11:05] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[1:11:08] the lord and in whom ye also are builded
[1:11:12] together for inhabitation of god through
[1:11:15] the spirit amen amen
[1:11:18] so where are we that we should be called
[1:11:19] by his name we're in christ and so paul
[1:11:22] says you've got to be in christ and when
[1:11:23] you're in christ you have christ's name
[1:11:25] it's not just that we come in he comes
[1:11:27] into us by the holy spirit but that holy
[1:11:28] spirit is what brings us into him really
[1:11:30] we're not two entities now we're one
[1:11:32] entity we're in him the same life the
[1:11:34] same spirit the same influence the same
[1:11:36] mind all these different things going
[1:11:38] through us as it is in him and that's
[1:11:39] what makes us one amen is we've got the
[1:11:42] same thing that's driving our lives
[1:11:44] inside of us
[1:11:45] brother brahm says this he says all
[1:11:47] things was given to christ and all that
[1:11:48] god was he poured into christ and all
[1:11:51] christ was he poured into the church and
[1:11:53] in that day you'll know that i'm in the
[1:11:55] father and the father of me and i in you
[1:11:58] and then he says all the privilege that
[1:12:00] the believer has if they could only
[1:12:02] accept it
[1:12:03] listen you are a co you are a joint heir
[1:12:06] you are co-heir with christ that's what
[1:12:09] he's saying you're one with him what he
[1:12:11] has you have
[1:12:12] what he has authority over you have
[1:12:14] authority over but he has power over you
[1:12:17] have power over whatever he has strength
[1:12:19] for you have strength for amen amen
[1:12:22] everything that he has is available to
[1:12:24] you amen why because he's added you in
[1:12:27] under his name and you're a part of him
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:30] stephen when he's talking to his test to
[1:12:32] his accusers before they stone him he
[1:12:34] says listen god isn't dwelling in the
[1:12:36] temple in jerusalem anymore now he
[1:12:38] wasn't rubbing it in their face he was
[1:12:40] letting them know that he knew
[1:12:42] he was letting them know i know you've
[1:12:44] been behind the holy of holies and he's
[1:12:46] not there anymore and i'm confirming to
[1:12:48] you that he's moved on to someplace else
[1:12:50] and you better figure out where he moved
[1:12:52] on to because your worship is dead right
[1:12:54] now because you're worshiping in a place
[1:12:56] where god hasn't put his name and his
[1:12:58] presence is no longer there
[1:13:00] he says this he says but solomon built
[1:13:03] him a house we read about it he says
[1:13:05] howbeit the most high dwelleth not in
[1:13:07] temples made with hands as saith the
[1:13:09] prophet heaven is my throne and earth is
[1:13:12] my footstool what house will you build
[1:13:15] me and this is where we're going with
[1:13:17] this series is what house will you build
[1:13:18] me what house are you building and what
[1:13:21] house are you trying to build and does
[1:13:22] the pattern that you're building match
[1:13:24] the pattern that god has laid out for
[1:13:25] every aspect of your life
[1:13:27] he says what house will you build me
[1:13:29] saith the lord or what is the place of
[1:13:32] my rest
[1:13:33] now we want to put a balance here amen
[1:13:35] because people don't come to us to
[1:13:37] receive salvation
[1:13:38] they have to come to christ amen
[1:13:40] remember a woman doesn't bring forth she
[1:13:42] receives life and then she manifests it
[1:13:44] out amen but she does not create life
[1:13:47] but she manifests it she brings what is
[1:13:49] placed in her and brings out more than
[1:13:51] what was put in
[1:13:52] she multiplies what is put into her and
[1:13:55] brings it out into into an amazing
[1:13:58] portion of life amen so you can't come
[1:14:00] to a woman to receive life you can only
[1:14:02] come to a woman to give life and the
[1:14:04] true church of christ only receives life
[1:14:05] from him amen and that means that the
[1:14:08] only life a true church a true wife of
[1:14:10] christ can bring forth is what his life
[1:14:12] over and over and over again so when we
[1:14:14] bring people to church we don't say come
[1:14:16] to church because we have to have the
[1:14:17] truth or we're right we say come to
[1:14:20] church so we can introduce you to christ
[1:14:21] because he's the one that gives us life
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] amen if you come to church to get life
[1:14:26] you'll die because that's what a
[1:14:28] denomination is is they're saying come
[1:14:30] to us rather than come to him for life
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:34] brother brahm says this he says church
[1:14:36] wherever you are what you belong to it
[1:14:38] makes no difference now it does make a
[1:14:40] difference he's not saying you can go
[1:14:41] stay in catholicism you know that that's
[1:14:44] not what he's saying here but he's
[1:14:44] saying the church you're in is not the
[1:14:46] defining factor here but there's one
[1:14:49] thing you must know you've got to be in
[1:14:51] christ not around christ not with christ
[1:14:54] you've got to be in christ or you're
[1:14:56] dead you can't live outside of him your
[1:14:59] church might be all right as a building
[1:15:01] your fellowship might be all right as
[1:15:03] men but when you deny the body the blood
[1:15:05] the word of jesus christ you're dead the
[1:15:08] minute you do it it's god's chosen place
[1:15:10] of worship this is where his name is
[1:15:12] exactly
[1:15:14] there is where he chose to put his name
[1:15:16] not in the church but in the son jesus
[1:15:18] christ that's why i kept saying we have
[1:15:20] to be in christ that's why paul said
[1:15:22] you're baptized into christ it's because
[1:15:25] you've got to be in him not just with
[1:15:27] him
[1:15:28] he says now notice safety lied only in
[1:15:31] the place of his choosing in his lamb
[1:15:34] and in the name of the lamb notice it
[1:15:36] was a male lamb a he not a her not a
[1:15:39] church she but his name not her name
[1:15:42] where he was going to meet the people
[1:15:44] was not in her name but in his name him
[1:15:46] the lamb now we say the church the great
[1:15:49] mighty church she did this and she did
[1:15:50] that she's weighed the storms we picked
[1:15:52] up in population we're great in numbers
[1:15:55] we don't say that here do we
[1:15:57] we're a mighty church she's a great
[1:15:58] thing but god never said anything about
[1:16:01] ashi
[1:16:03] he said him
[1:16:04] him is the meeting place the lamb not
[1:16:06] the church not her name but his name he
[1:16:09] didn't put her name anywhere he put his
[1:16:12] name in him that's why now listen to
[1:16:14] this all we must do our word or deed we
[1:16:19] must do it all in the name of jesus
[1:16:21] christ if we pray we got to pray in the
[1:16:24] name of jesus if we ask petition we've
[1:16:26] got to ask it in jesus name if we walk
[1:16:29] we walk in jesus name if we talk we talk
[1:16:32] in jesus name if we baptize we've got to
[1:16:35] baptize in the name of jesus christ for
[1:16:37] all that we do in word or indeed do it
[1:16:40] in the name of jesus christ
[1:16:43] so when he said hallowed be thy name
[1:16:46] this is what he's talking about is go
[1:16:48] this far to the point where your prayer
[1:16:50] is lord everything that i do
[1:16:53] let it be done in your name that your
[1:16:55] name would not be blasphemed that i
[1:16:56] wouldn't make what your name appeared
[1:16:58] dirty that i wouldn't make your name
[1:17:00] appear sinful that your name will be
[1:17:02] kept clean because everything that i do
[1:17:04] i'm doing in your name not doing it
[1:17:06] according to something else amen
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:09] so as we read in this quote we want to
[1:17:11] do everything in our lives in the name
[1:17:12] of jesus christ amen so when we're doing
[1:17:15] something or when we're about to do
[1:17:17] something our question should be does
[1:17:18] this reflect the holiness of the name
[1:17:20] because that's the first thing that word
[1:17:22] hallow means is to keep it holy so what
[1:17:24] i'm about to do does it reflect the
[1:17:26] holiness of god
[1:17:28] that standard alone would probably have
[1:17:29] us stop doing half the things we do in
[1:17:31] our lives today
[1:17:32] does this make god look holy
[1:17:35] does this reflect the holiness of god or
[1:17:38] is this just something i want to do on
[1:17:39] my own that's a high standard isn't it
[1:17:43] god help us is right amen
[1:17:45] first peter 2 9 says but you this is us
[1:17:48] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[1:17:52] priesthood a holy nation of peculiar
[1:17:55] people we're weird we're different
[1:17:58] we better be different because we're
[1:17:59] serving a holy god and we're supposed to
[1:18:01] be reflecting him he says how is it that
[1:18:04] you're peculiar that you should show
[1:18:06] forth the praises of him who had called
[1:18:09] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:18:12] light we're supposed to be reflecting
[1:18:14] light not the darkness that we come out
[1:18:16] of amen remember a long time you see
[1:18:19] those people walking around with those
[1:18:20] bracelets that had wwjd on it and it
[1:18:23] represented what what would jesus do
[1:18:27] they weren't really thinking about it
[1:18:28] but it was a great sentiment and
[1:18:30] sometimes i think we ought to be wearing
[1:18:32] them because it will remind us is this
[1:18:34] exactly what jesus would be doing right
[1:18:35] now in this time that we're living in in
[1:18:37] the age that we're living in in the
[1:18:39] trials and tribulations we're facing in
[1:18:41] the in the time of the greatest
[1:18:43] deception is what i'm doing right now
[1:18:45] what jesus would be doing if he were
[1:18:46] here is this what he would be telling
[1:18:48] his disciples to do if he were here or
[1:18:50] am i just doing something of my own
[1:18:51] making amen
[1:18:53] what did jesus say he's saying pray that
[1:18:55] your life will match up to the life of
[1:18:57] jesus such that there will be a heavenly
[1:18:59] holiness and purity that is pleasing to
[1:19:01] god
[1:19:02] not self-pleasing but that it will
[1:19:04] please him this is my beloved son in
[1:19:07] whom i am pleased to dwell amen may he
[1:19:10] be pleased that we're doing something
[1:19:11] with the holy spirit that he gave us
[1:19:14] brother braham says this he says we are
[1:19:15] flesh and bone of him
[1:19:18] as long as we are the bride of christ
[1:19:20] do you believe that he says all right he
[1:19:22] died for us and we died to ourselves and
[1:19:25] are buried in his name that we would be
[1:19:28] no more of the world but in him of who
[1:19:31] of which both the family in heaven is
[1:19:32] named after jesus christ he says that's
[1:19:35] ephesians 1 21. he says for the family
[1:19:38] for both heaven and the family in heaven
[1:19:40] what's the family in heaven named
[1:19:42] jesus
[1:19:43] what's the name what's the family on
[1:19:45] earth named well that's the house of god
[1:19:48] where the blood's at is that right
[1:19:49] that's the door that's the gate that's a
[1:19:52] place where he put his name and the word
[1:19:54] was made flesh and dwelt among us not us
[1:19:56] now he says jesus
[1:19:58] he says
[1:19:59] now what does this look like
[1:20:01] you say now that's an interesting thing
[1:20:03] he says it's the word reflecting and
[1:20:06] sparking off the age that you're living
[1:20:08] in that's what this looks like when
[1:20:09] you're bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:20:11] flesh it's the word reflecting and
[1:20:12] sparking off the age that you're living
[1:20:14] in
[1:20:15] that's what he was when he was here he
[1:20:17] reflected the word for his age that's
[1:20:19] what moses was moses reflected the word
[1:20:21] for his age that's what jacob's was and
[1:20:24] that's what the rest of them was
[1:20:25] sparking off that word of god the
[1:20:27] reflector that god was reflecting
[1:20:29] himself so we are what a reflection
[1:20:33] we're supposed to be a reflection he
[1:20:35] says and come to that perfect image of
[1:20:37] god jesus christ god's masterpiece was
[1:20:41] struck that he might take the rest of
[1:20:43] them for a bride
[1:20:45] that's been
[1:20:46] reflectors
[1:20:48] he says moses was in him joshua was in
[1:20:51] him and if you are in him you were in
[1:20:54] him before the foundation of the world
[1:20:56] the family of god
[1:20:58] catch this you suffered with him
[1:21:01] you died with him you went to the cross
[1:21:04] with him and you raised with him and now
[1:21:08] you're still with him sitting in
[1:21:10] heavenly places doing what
[1:21:12] reflecting the message of the age to the
[1:21:15] world the light of the world that's
[1:21:19] where we are amen that's why we've got
[1:21:21] to pray lord keep your name holy because
[1:21:23] his name is being reflected through us
[1:21:25] it's the only thing the world can see
[1:21:27] today and if we're getting it dirty by
[1:21:29] our own living
[1:21:31] then what happens the light is cloudy
[1:21:34] remember the scripture talks about it'll
[1:21:35] be neither dark nor light it'll be murky
[1:21:38] that's what happens when you get your
[1:21:40] life messed up like this amen
[1:21:42] the way what is it the way we operate
[1:21:44] the way we think our motives our
[1:21:46] objectives our actions our reactions are
[1:21:48] all supposed to be reflective of how god
[1:21:51] operates
[1:21:53] that's a tough call that's a tough
[1:21:55] standard that everything we do would be
[1:21:57] reflective of how god does it
[1:22:00] not how god wants
[1:22:02] but how god did it amen we can look to
[1:22:04] christ and see exactly what he did time
[1:22:06] and time again you can see him whether
[1:22:08] it was them making fun of him whether it
[1:22:09] was them rebuking him whether it was
[1:22:11] them putting them down whether it was
[1:22:12] them beating him spitting him on the
[1:22:14] face making fun of his gift whatever it
[1:22:16] was we see how he acted in every
[1:22:18] situation amen
[1:22:20] it's not that we don't have an example
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:22] but notice here what brother braham says
[1:22:24] he says what reflecting the message of
[1:22:27] the age to the world
[1:22:29] so what is a reflection
[1:22:31] does a reflection add to itself can a
[1:22:33] reflection do anything to make itself
[1:22:35] more or less a reflection is merely an
[1:22:37] image of something else on a surface and
[1:22:40] all we can do is keep the surface clean
[1:22:43] right that's what we've got to do is
[1:22:44] keep the surface clean the image that's
[1:22:46] coming in is perfect the only thing that
[1:22:48] will mar the reflection is a flaw on the
[1:22:51] mirror
[1:22:52] on whatever surface it is
[1:22:54] so we've got to what he's saying is keep
[1:22:56] your mirror clean
[1:22:58] that's all we are we're a reflector he's
[1:22:59] saying keep the mirror clean so that the
[1:23:01] work can bounce off you cleanly
[1:23:03] you look at some of the things that they
[1:23:05] do in in
[1:23:06] in
[1:23:07] these these huge telescopes and they
[1:23:10] will polish these things
[1:23:12] to they have to polish them and clean
[1:23:14] them with lasers
[1:23:16] so that they can get a perfect
[1:23:17] reflection because they're looking so
[1:23:19] far into the universe that the slightest
[1:23:21] imperfection will warp the image and
[1:23:23] they'll get a bad image
[1:23:25] they've got to have a perfect reflector
[1:23:27] in there and they've got all these
[1:23:28] individual pieces and if one piece is
[1:23:30] not only
[1:23:31] flawed but out of position
[1:23:34] then the reflection is ruined for the
[1:23:36] entire image
[1:23:37] right the whole group has to be like
[1:23:40] this the whole set of mirrors we'd like
[1:23:43] to build just one big curved mirror but
[1:23:44] you can't do it so they build it in
[1:23:45] small pieces and they put it together
[1:23:47] that's what he's doing is he's building
[1:23:49] a small a group a big group of mirrors
[1:23:52] made of many small ones and what he's
[1:23:53] saying is all of those mirrors have to
[1:23:55] be clean and then they've got to be holy
[1:23:57] they've got to be separate amen
[1:24:00] that's what hallowed be thy name means
[1:24:03] we just spent 10 pages of notes telling
[1:24:05] you what hallowed be thy name means
[1:24:07] that's how deep this is okay this wasn't
[1:24:09] just some words that jesus said to pray
[1:24:12] this is the the depth of what he said
[1:24:14] here is incredible and we're only going
[1:24:16] to cover it for one service but when he
[1:24:19] says hallow be thy name that was our
[1:24:21] commitment that we would look to him to
[1:24:23] keep our lives clean to be a reflection
[1:24:25] of him every day of our lives amen
[1:24:28] verse 10
[1:24:29] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:24:32] earth as it is in heaven thy kingdom
[1:24:34] come
[1:24:36] whose kingdom
[1:24:39] the kingdom of our dreams
[1:24:42] of our anticipation
[1:24:44] of our skills of our education of our
[1:24:47] gifts
[1:24:48] no thy kingdom
[1:24:50] lord what you want done let that be what
[1:24:53] comes into our life let that be the
[1:24:54] thing that we're serving amen but what
[1:24:57] is the kingdom of god what is the
[1:24:58] kingdom of heaven because that's what
[1:24:59] he's talking about here thy kingdom it's
[1:25:01] got to be the kingdom of god in the
[1:25:02] kingdom of heaven because he's our
[1:25:04] father in heaven and he's god amen so
[1:25:06] those are both the same things what is
[1:25:07] the kingdom of heaven jesus said matthew
[1:25:10] 4 17 and from that time jesus began to
[1:25:12] preach and to say repent for the kingdom
[1:25:15] of heaven is at hand that means it's
[1:25:17] coming and it'll be here soon
[1:25:20] john 3 says there was a man of the
[1:25:22] pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:25:24] jews that same came to jesus by night
[1:25:26] and said unto him rabbi we know that
[1:25:28] thou art a teacher come from god for no
[1:25:31] man can do these miracles that thou
[1:25:32] doest except god be with him and jesus
[1:25:35] answered him answered and said unto him
[1:25:37] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[1:25:40] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:25:42] kingdom of god.
[1:25:44] so he says the kingdom of god the
[1:25:45] kingdom of heaven is coming and then he
[1:25:47] says unless you're born again you can't
[1:25:49] see it you can't even understand the
[1:25:51] things of god you can't understand the
[1:25:53] way god operates you can't understand
[1:25:54] the way god structures things you can't
[1:25:56] understand the will or purpose of god
[1:25:58] none of this happens he says unless
[1:26:00] you're born again it's the only way to
[1:26:02] understand it's the only way to receive
[1:26:03] it is to be born again what does it mean
[1:26:06] to be born again you got to die and
[1:26:08] something else has to come out right an
[1:26:10] old life has to go down and the new life
[1:26:12] has to come up we know what that is we
[1:26:14] become a new creature in christ amen you
[1:26:16] have a new life and that life is the
[1:26:18] holy spirit god's own life inside of you
[1:26:20] that's the new birth amendment jesus
[1:26:22] says you cannot see it you can't
[1:26:24] understand anything about the kingdom of
[1:26:27] god
[1:26:27] unless you have the holy spirit
[1:26:30] that's a tremendous statement
[1:26:32] because you'll see people out there and
[1:26:33] they're handling the word without the
[1:26:35] holy spirit
[1:26:37] and they have no clue and the thing is
[1:26:38] they could have a clue about 99
[1:26:41] but that one percent is what will
[1:26:42] destroy it
[1:26:44] why the mirror has to be perfect
[1:26:46] right it has to be clean
[1:26:49] clean not perfect clean
[1:26:52] i mean it's not perfection that's going
[1:26:53] to do this but there's got to be
[1:26:54] cleanliness to it amen and there's a
[1:26:56] cleanliness that comes by one thing and
[1:26:57] that's through the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:59] amen so what is being born again it's
[1:27:01] the experience of god living inside of
[1:27:03] you that he has changed you into
[1:27:05] something that you didn't used to be and
[1:27:07] that you never could be until he came
[1:27:09] into you
[1:27:10] brother braham says this he says christ
[1:27:12] had to die to make us all alive to
[1:27:14] quicken us is that right
[1:27:16] he says so it's only true no matter what
[1:27:18] church you belong to how many times you
[1:27:20] shook hands with the preacher how many
[1:27:22] names you got on the book or how many
[1:27:23] churches you belong to it doesn't mean
[1:27:26] that you've got to absolutely accept the
[1:27:28] death of jesus christ
[1:27:30] he says and not only that but you've got
[1:27:33] to die yourself
[1:27:35] you've got to die to every thought of
[1:27:37] the flesh so that you can receive the
[1:27:39] mind of christ and walk from henceforth
[1:27:41] not of your own but of his mind the mind
[1:27:44] of christ in you
[1:27:46] that's the only way you can stay alive
[1:27:50] stay alive
[1:27:52] it's got to be a continuous thing
[1:27:54] he says that's the only way i can stay
[1:27:56] alive all i live by is by the holy
[1:27:59] spirit
[1:28:00] what a statement can we say that all i
[1:28:03] live by is by the holy spirit that is a
[1:28:05] challenge my brothers and sisters
[1:28:07] all i live by is the holy spirit
[1:28:10] jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:28:13] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:28:16] out of the mouth of god
[1:28:18] amen and it's not by words that we live
[1:28:20] we have to take those words amen but we
[1:28:22] don't just talk a good talk we don't
[1:28:24] just preach a good sermon we don't just
[1:28:26] you know spew out doctrine and truth and
[1:28:29] this and that and the other thing but
[1:28:30] there's something else that has to
[1:28:31] follow those words amen
[1:28:33] matthew 7 21 jesus says not everyone
[1:28:36] that sayeth unto me lord lord shall
[1:28:38] enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:28:41] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:28:45] which is in heaven
[1:28:46] amen there's got to be a life there's
[1:28:48] got to be an action there's got to be an
[1:28:50] obedience to the word that comes with
[1:28:52] the receiving of that word because
[1:28:53] otherwise you never received it you just
[1:28:56] took it into your head and you didn't
[1:28:57] believe it enough you didn't have faith
[1:28:59] enough to put it into action you didn't
[1:29:01] believe the consequences of not doing it
[1:29:03] enough to do it brother brown says if
[1:29:05] you believe if you truly believed you do
[1:29:07] what he said
[1:29:08] but so often we don't because we don't
[1:29:10] truly believe it yet
[1:29:12] amen none of us are sitting here with
[1:29:14] all the faith to take it all let's not
[1:29:16] pretend that amen i'm not pretending it
[1:29:17] up here there's many things that i don't
[1:29:19] have the faith to claim yet amen but i
[1:29:22] believe it and i'm trusting him to bring
[1:29:23] the faith to allow me to step into it
[1:29:25] and make it a reality in my life amen
[1:29:28] amen so what is it the kingdom of heaven
[1:29:32] is entered by what doing the will of the
[1:29:35] one that controls the kingdom
[1:29:37] you can't be in the kingdom and be a
[1:29:39] willing subject if you're not doing what
[1:29:40] the king says from that kingdom and
[1:29:42] that's why you have to have the new
[1:29:43] birth is because that puts a king in
[1:29:45] your life that overrides everything that
[1:29:48] we would ever do or say amen that takes
[1:29:50] care of our desires it takes care of our
[1:29:52] thoughts it takes care of our actions it
[1:29:54] takes care of our reactions and brings
[1:29:55] them subject to the king that's in the
[1:29:57] throne of our heart amen
[1:29:59] so what is it jesus is saying when he's
[1:30:01] saying what thy kingdom come he's saying
[1:30:03] pray that the kingdom of god comes to
[1:30:05] you
[1:30:06] pray that the holy ghost comes to you
[1:30:08] pray that you actually get the
[1:30:10] opportunity for this amen but after that
[1:30:12] pray that you're a part of it pray that
[1:30:14] you're seeing it and pray that you're
[1:30:16] included in it amen thy kingdom come in
[1:30:19] me don't let it just come to brother bob
[1:30:21] but let it come to me don't let it just
[1:30:23] come to sister justine but let it come
[1:30:25] to me make sure you're a part of it not
[1:30:27] just seeing it not just affiliated with
[1:30:29] it but make sure you're in the kingdom
[1:30:30] with the others that are in the kingdom
[1:30:32] amen we don't get in by association it
[1:30:35] is a one-on-one relationship you don't
[1:30:37] get in because i'm filled with the holy
[1:30:38] ghost and i don't get in because you're
[1:30:39] filled with the holy ghost we each one
[1:30:41] have to have our portion amen we each
[1:30:43] one have our light
[1:30:46] that kingdom come and then he says thy
[1:30:48] will be done now we're getting to the
[1:30:49] crux of the matter amen thy will be done
[1:30:53] where's our will in this
[1:30:55] does anyone see anything about my will
[1:30:56] in that scripture
[1:30:58] no it says thy will be done let what you
[1:31:01] want be done in my life let what you
[1:31:03] believe to be the best thing be done in
[1:31:04] my life let my mind be subject to your
[1:31:07] mind let my heart be subject to your
[1:31:09] heart let my life be subject to what the
[1:31:12] word of god what did brother branham
[1:31:14] quote said scripture he says man shall
[1:31:15] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:31:17] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:31:19] god
[1:31:23] but the brahman says this he says we
[1:31:24] find today that the modern world church
[1:31:26] and also that the spiritual church are
[1:31:28] both pregnanted to give birth to sons
[1:31:31] there's going to be two births happening
[1:31:34] one of them a denominational birth is
[1:31:36] going to be given one of these days at
[1:31:38] the world council of churches which will
[1:31:40] produce to the world the antichrist
[1:31:41] through a denomination that's exactly
[1:31:44] the truth i may not live to see it i
[1:31:45] believe i will but you young people
[1:31:47] remember that you heard a minister say
[1:31:49] that that will finally wind up and that
[1:31:51] is the mark of the beast when she forms
[1:31:53] that world council of churches and shall
[1:31:55] give birth to her son the antichrist
[1:31:58] so if satan's kingdom is producing an
[1:32:00] antichrist what does god's kingdom got
[1:32:02] to produce
[1:32:03] a christ
[1:32:05] he says the other is pregnanted by the
[1:32:07] word of god and will bring forth the
[1:32:10] body the finished body of jesus christ
[1:32:13] which is the bride
[1:32:16] he says the body of christ isn't
[1:32:17] finished yet he says how many knows that
[1:32:20] a man and a woman is one and christ is
[1:32:22] one body the word the bride will have to
[1:32:24] be the rest of that body and the two
[1:32:27] together makes the one body again like
[1:32:30] adam was at the beginning man and his
[1:32:31] wife are one why
[1:32:33] male and female created he him
[1:32:36] male and female created he then they
[1:32:38] were one to start and then they were
[1:32:39] divided and put into bodies amen he says
[1:32:42] it's the same thing we've been divided
[1:32:43] and now we've got to come back into
[1:32:44] oneness
[1:32:45] he says like adam was at the beginning
[1:32:47] man and his wife are one now she the
[1:32:50] true bride is so sold out to him that
[1:32:53] she uses no mind of herma of her own his
[1:32:56] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:33:00] is his word you'll hear somebody say
[1:33:02] what
[1:33:03] the lord told me
[1:33:05] or god's will is such and such and if it
[1:33:08] doesn't line up with the word they are
[1:33:10] under another spirit and there's only
[1:33:12] one other spirit from the holy spirit
[1:33:13] and it is a denominational antichrist
[1:33:16] spirit
[1:33:16] now that sounds harsh but it's true and
[1:33:18] you can have the holy spirit and be
[1:33:20] under another spirit in portions of your
[1:33:21] life
[1:33:22] because why god's continually working on
[1:33:24] us pushing out the enemy and filling
[1:33:26] that up with his word
[1:33:28] but we're in a battle right now amen
[1:33:30] we're in a battle right now and the soul
[1:33:31] is sealed but everything else is still
[1:33:33] subject to what an antichrist spirit and
[1:33:35] so there's that battle going on back and
[1:33:37] forth and you've got to be subject in
[1:33:39] every area of your life to that holy
[1:33:40] spirit before we get out of here and so
[1:33:42] he's working in us to kick out the
[1:33:44] antichrist spirit in our life in that
[1:33:46] certain portion and replace it with the
[1:33:48] holy spirit to have full control over
[1:33:50] each and every one of us
[1:33:51] and you can't say it's not true because
[1:33:53] every day we do things we ought not to
[1:33:55] do and you didn't do it by the holy
[1:33:56] spirit so there was another spirit that
[1:33:58] had control of that area of your life
[1:34:00] amen so we want to do what in this
[1:34:02] series what we're going to be looking at
[1:34:04] is what is the spirit
[1:34:06] that's developing the kingdom in our
[1:34:07] life because kingdoms are built by
[1:34:09] spirits
[1:34:10] that's what you'll see that's what he's
[1:34:11] saying here there's what there's two
[1:34:13] bodies going to come out and one's going
[1:34:14] to be an antichrist and the other one's
[1:34:16] going to be the bride of christ there's
[1:34:17] something being built there's a kingdom
[1:34:19] being created here and based on the
[1:34:21] spirit that's on you that's what the
[1:34:23] kingdom's going to be in your life so
[1:34:25] you may have your marriage under perfect
[1:34:27] submission to the holy spirit but if
[1:34:29] your career is not then you're going to
[1:34:30] build a career that has a kingdom that
[1:34:32] looks like satan's not gods and you've
[1:34:34] got to understand what god's pattern
[1:34:36] looks like for a career versus what
[1:34:37] satan's looks like amen for your
[1:34:40] marriage for your ministry for your
[1:34:42] gifts for your family all of these
[1:34:45] different things how it all plays in man
[1:34:47] versus woman
[1:34:48] right god has a pattern for the way a
[1:34:50] man acts the way a man is god has a
[1:34:52] pattern for a way a woman looks in his
[1:34:54] and we're going to get into that what is
[1:34:55] the pattern in heaven because remember
[1:34:58] what thy kingdom come let the heavenly
[1:35:00] pattern be reflected in the earthly
[1:35:02] creature and the earthly creation and
[1:35:04] that's what's going to bring us into
[1:35:06] that fullness of the bride of christ
[1:35:07] amen is when what's in heaven the images
[1:35:09] in that's in heaven is reflected in our
[1:35:11] lives in every way
[1:35:13] amen that's a challenge to us i believe
[1:35:18] so what we say lord we pray we say lord
[1:35:20] i want such and such lord do this lord
[1:35:22] do that
[1:35:23] no he's saying by the end here
[1:35:26] our will will be 100 according to his
[1:35:28] word and so we won't be saying lord give
[1:35:31] me such and such we'll say lord your
[1:35:33] word says and i'm praying for your word
[1:35:35] i'm asking for your word i'm claiming
[1:35:36] your word because that's where my
[1:35:38] confidence lies amen but notice the
[1:35:40] order if we look at the scripture again
[1:35:42] he says thy kingdom come
[1:35:44] thy kingdom come means you've got to get
[1:35:45] the holy ghost first thy kingdom's got
[1:35:47] to come at me the holy ghost has to come
[1:35:49] in me when the holy ghost comes to me
[1:35:51] then i will pray thy will be done in
[1:35:54] earth
[1:35:55] as it is in heaven amen you won't be
[1:35:57] praying thy will correctly until the
[1:35:59] kingdoms come inside of you and the work
[1:36:01] has started the seed has been quickened
[1:36:03] and then from there now god something
[1:36:05] got something to build out of your life
[1:36:07] amen
[1:36:08] on earth as it is in heaven this is
[1:36:11] this is the the the inspiration for this
[1:36:13] entire series we're going to be doing is
[1:36:15] lord let what's on in heaven be
[1:36:17] reflected in earth let me subject
[1:36:20] everything that i do
[1:36:21] to what the heavenly pattern and then to
[1:36:24] the word pattern that's what we're
[1:36:25] talking about we don't have to go look
[1:36:26] to the unseen we've got it written here
[1:36:28] we've got the pattern here for every
[1:36:30] part of our life so if we can go in here
[1:36:32] and see the pattern then we can pray
[1:36:34] lord let me reflect the pattern
[1:36:37] i've been thinking these last few
[1:36:38] mornings just
[1:36:40] in prayer and and i've been thinking god
[1:36:42] because there were some things there
[1:36:43] were some changes i was looking for in
[1:36:45] my life
[1:36:46] and guess what it doesn't happen
[1:36:47] overnight does it but all of a sudden i
[1:36:49] started looking back and i started
[1:36:52] saying lord thank you for the victory
[1:36:54] because i looked back and all of a
[1:36:55] sudden i started seeing victory where
[1:36:57] there didn't used to be victory i
[1:36:59] started seeing the word made manifest
[1:37:00] where the word didn't used to be
[1:37:02] manifest where my personal flaws were my
[1:37:04] genetic makeup where the things i got
[1:37:06] from my mom things i got from my dad
[1:37:08] things i got from old complexes things
[1:37:10] i've got from what somebody said they
[1:37:12] were influencing me and i had to say
[1:37:14] lord
[1:37:16] this
[1:37:16] does not look like this
[1:37:19] amen and so i want the mirror to be
[1:37:22] fixed i want the mirror to be cleaned up
[1:37:25] and so lord help me to clean it up
[1:37:28] but i'm not saying lord let me clean it
[1:37:30] up i'm saying lord let you clean it up
[1:37:32] so i can reflect it because me cleaning
[1:37:35] it up just spreads the dirt around
[1:37:37] that's all that happens amen we don't
[1:37:38] have the
[1:37:39] the bleach
[1:37:41] amen but it's the blood of christ
[1:37:43] covering it it's the overcoming power of
[1:37:44] the holy spirit that starts moving and
[1:37:47] all he's looking for is a surrender
[1:37:48] vessel that says i need help that i've
[1:37:51] got a flaw i've got an
[1:37:53] unclean portion here that needs you and
[1:37:56] unless you come and take it i can't
[1:37:58] reflect you and i'm gonna struggle and
[1:38:00] your name is going to be blasphemed
[1:38:03] because i can't live the way you said i
[1:38:04] should live so lord help me to live the
[1:38:07] way you want me to live in this area of
[1:38:08] my life in that area of my life and this
[1:38:11] weakness and this flaw and this failure
[1:38:13] and if you can come in there now
[1:38:15] then the word of god will be holy in my
[1:38:17] name the name of god will be reflected
[1:38:19] in here and i won't be what
[1:38:21] it won't be something that pulls it down
[1:38:23] amen that makes it look common amen but
[1:38:25] rather it lifts it up and says there is
[1:38:27] a victory in christ amen there is a life
[1:38:29] that you can live that is not of
[1:38:31] yourself and he can take something out
[1:38:32] and he can clean it and he can fix it
[1:38:34] until you can perfectly reflect the
[1:38:36] image that he had of you before the
[1:38:38] world began amen
[1:38:40] amen we're in a kingdom now
[1:38:42] amen and within that kingdom are many
[1:38:44] houses many castles there's many
[1:38:46] different people look around this church
[1:38:48] this is a kingdom of sorts
[1:38:50] amen and what do we have we have project
[1:38:52] managers we have marketing people we
[1:38:54] have retirees we have accountants we
[1:38:56] have engineers we have mill rights and
[1:38:58] machinists we have men we have women we
[1:39:01] have wives we have single ladies we have
[1:39:02] single men we have children we have
[1:39:04] teenagers we have infants we have all
[1:39:06] sorts of things in the kingdom don't we
[1:39:08] of all different walks of life of the
[1:39:10] different families different backgrounds
[1:39:12] different heritages different colors
[1:39:14] different countries of origin
[1:39:17] everything in here is different but it's
[1:39:19] all part of that same kingdom amen it
[1:39:21] has so many parts and pieces just look
[1:39:23] at me
[1:39:24] okay so i am first of all what a man
[1:39:28] i'm a husband
[1:39:29] i'm a father i'm a son i'm a brother i'm
[1:39:33] a minister i'm an assistant pastor i'm
[1:39:36] an employee and i'm a citizen of canada
[1:39:37] as well
[1:39:38] that's nine different kingdoms
[1:39:41] that need to be governed by god in my
[1:39:43] life because each one of them requires
[1:39:45] different responsibilities different
[1:39:46] characteristics of me the thing that
[1:39:48] makes me a good father does not
[1:39:49] necessarily make me a good employee at
[1:39:51] the same time because if i apply the
[1:39:52] same requirement to employees as i do
[1:39:55] to my employment as i did to my family
[1:39:57] then i put too much emphasis on my
[1:39:59] employment and all probability
[1:40:00] why because god gave me the family
[1:40:02] before he ever gave me the job and he
[1:40:03] requires me to hold on to the family
[1:40:05] before he requires me to hold on to the
[1:40:07] job and then so there's those kingdoms
[1:40:09] have to be put into god's order and
[1:40:11] they've got to be put into god's
[1:40:12] priorities and then god's got to what
[1:40:15] reflect himself in me in each of those
[1:40:17] areas so i've got to have certain
[1:40:18] attributes as a father i've got to have
[1:40:21] certain attributes as a son i've got to
[1:40:23] have certain attributes as a husband and
[1:40:25] all these different things
[1:40:27] but what is the one thing i didn't
[1:40:28] mention
[1:40:30] what i am a child of god and that is the
[1:40:33] kingdom that is over all of those and
[1:40:35] the minute i elevate something over the
[1:40:37] over the the kingdom of what which i
[1:40:40] where my father is my heavenly father is
[1:40:42] then all of a sudden i get out of order
[1:40:44] underneath it and all of a sudden the
[1:40:45] kingdom falls apart
[1:40:47] my entire kingdom falls apart i mean
[1:40:49] there's little portions within that that
[1:40:50] have to be in order but if i don't put
[1:40:52] it all under the umbrella of god's
[1:40:54] headship that's where i'm a son and he's
[1:40:56] the father then i'm going to get into
[1:40:58] trouble aren't i
[1:41:00] amen what's jesus saying he's saying let
[1:41:02] the kingdom of heaven let the holy
[1:41:03] spirit be what be what defines your life
[1:41:06] in every single one of the roles that
[1:41:08] you play as a son or daughter of god
[1:41:10] amen every single one of those things i
[1:41:12] mentioned father husband son brother
[1:41:15] minister employee all of those are
[1:41:17] subject to influence
[1:41:20] and every one of those means that
[1:41:21] there's an aspect there where the enemy
[1:41:23] can get in
[1:41:24] and equally there's an opportunity for
[1:41:26] the holy spirit to get in as well
[1:41:28] something's got to dominate something's
[1:41:30] got to control something's got to have
[1:41:31] the influence and jesus is saying pray
[1:41:34] that the kingdom of heaven pray that the
[1:41:35] holy spirit is the one that brings you
[1:41:38] to his will so that what happens in you
[1:41:40] is what he wants and what he's ordered
[1:41:42] to happen in heaven amen that what we do
[1:41:44] here reflects what he wants done in
[1:41:46] their amen in other words in heaven
[1:41:48] there is a divine order
[1:41:49] there's a divine way of doing it and it
[1:41:51] defines everything from worship to
[1:41:53] authority to servanthood to fatherhood
[1:41:56] to husbandry
[1:41:57] amen and with all of those if you have a
[1:42:00] husband then you automatically have a
[1:42:01] wife if you have a father you
[1:42:02] automatically have a mother amen and so
[1:42:04] the bride's portion and the bride's
[1:42:07] requirement is reflected also in what he
[1:42:09] does and we'll get into that as well as
[1:42:11] we go through this amen
[1:42:13] so now this prayer takes on a different
[1:42:15] look doesn't it because now this is all
[1:42:17] about me
[1:42:19] being what subject to the holy spirit so
[1:42:22] that god can do what he wants to do in
[1:42:23] this age
[1:42:25] that's what this is about as he's saying
[1:42:26] in all of these things humble yourself
[1:42:28] get yourself under the leadership of
[1:42:30] that heavenly kingdom of the holy spirit
[1:42:33] and then through that
[1:42:34] let your sonship be there as the sonship
[1:42:36] is in heaven let your father should be
[1:42:38] as a followership in heaven let your
[1:42:40] employment be as the employment in
[1:42:41] heaven let your worship be as the
[1:42:43] worship in heaven all of these things
[1:42:44] will be according to the heavenly aspect
[1:42:47] amen so what's he saying say lord
[1:42:50] let your pattern be my pattern
[1:42:53] let everything i do be according to the
[1:42:54] pattern that you've laid out it may may
[1:42:56] your order be my order let your beauty
[1:42:58] be my beauty that your character be my
[1:43:01] character let your purpose be my purpose
[1:43:03] let your priority be my priority and in
[1:43:06] all of those once those boxes get
[1:43:08] checked then all of a sudden you start
[1:43:09] to see what christ reflected in you and
[1:43:12] the name is not made unholy
[1:43:17] amen
[1:43:18] says this he says see what the world
[1:43:20] calls great god calls foolish
[1:43:24] and what the world calls foolish god
[1:43:25] calls great
[1:43:27] he says that's right so don't mind to be
[1:43:28] called foolish
[1:43:30] on the flip side if the world is telling
[1:43:32] you you're great
[1:43:35] we got a problem don't we
[1:43:37] because the world's supposed to think
[1:43:38] we're foolish
[1:43:40] not great
[1:43:41] so if we're getting accolades from the
[1:43:43] world
[1:43:44] we've got a problem now if they if their
[1:43:45] accolades are that you're a great worker
[1:43:48] that's good because we're supposed to be
[1:43:50] a hard worker we're supposed to be
[1:43:52] diligent don't don't get that confused
[1:43:54] but if they're saying you're great
[1:43:55] because they identify with what you're
[1:43:57] saying or doing then we've got a problem
[1:43:59] because we're supposed to be foolish in
[1:44:01] their eyes
[1:44:03] he says because remember you can't have
[1:44:05] the mind of christ in the mind of the
[1:44:07] world at the same time
[1:44:10] you can't be in your way and god's way
[1:44:13] at the same time
[1:44:14] you have to get out of your own way to
[1:44:16] let god have his way that's the only way
[1:44:20] you're ever going to do anything you've
[1:44:22] got to get away from your own thoughts
[1:44:24] your own reasons he says don't try to
[1:44:26] reason
[1:44:27] just believe
[1:44:30] a couple short ones here he says if the
[1:44:32] life of christ be in you
[1:44:34] if the mind of christ be in you
[1:44:36] then we're concerned and do the things
[1:44:39] of christ
[1:44:42] if the mind of christ is in us
[1:44:45] then we will recognize that word to be
[1:44:47] the truth and it lives right through us
[1:44:50] he says you can't help it it's christ
[1:44:55] amen
[1:44:56] thank you jesus this is a high standard
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:01] that the word would be living through us
[1:45:03] he says you can't help it if you're a
[1:45:04] part of the word you can't help it why
[1:45:06] because it's christ so now we start
[1:45:08] looking at a man being a man differently
[1:45:11] we start looking at being a woman
[1:45:12] differently because we've got to look at
[1:45:14] it through his eyes hey man we started
[1:45:15] looking at our families differently we
[1:45:17] start looking at the local body
[1:45:18] differently we start looking at politics
[1:45:20] differently we start looking at the
[1:45:21] condition the world is indifferently
[1:45:23] because we're looking at it through the
[1:45:24] mind of christ and his life is within us
[1:45:27] to quicken that which we need of to make
[1:45:29] it through this age
[1:45:30] but now we're pulling things through a
[1:45:32] filter that is not our own we're pulling
[1:45:33] it through the eyes of the word we're
[1:45:34] pulling it through the things that
[1:45:36] matter to him and so when things are
[1:45:38] going crazy around us like they are it
[1:45:40] doesn't matter to the mind of christ
[1:45:42] because he's got a plan and purpose in
[1:45:43] it all and all we're looking for is lord
[1:45:45] what's your purpose in all of this
[1:45:46] craziness that we're going through and
[1:45:48] we don't get sucked into the craziness
[1:45:50] we're just sitting there saying lord
[1:45:51] what would you have me do in the
[1:45:52] craziness
[1:45:54] you know what would you have me reflect
[1:45:55] in all of this when the whole world's
[1:45:57] going crazy when people are getting
[1:45:58] sucked in the silliest sucked into the
[1:46:00] silliest of things with their time and
[1:46:02] efforts and strengths and gifts lord
[1:46:04] what would you have me put my efforts
[1:46:05] into so that they could see christ in me
[1:46:07] the hope of glory amen
[1:46:09] amen
[1:46:11] so this is what we want to drive into
[1:46:13] our gender
[1:46:15] our marital status our relationships our
[1:46:17] jobs our ministries our callings and we
[1:46:19] want to compare what we're doing right
[1:46:21] now to the heavenly pattern and say lord
[1:46:24] does it match up
[1:46:26] and we'll always go to the heavenly
[1:46:27] pattern first
[1:46:29] then we'll see what happens when we fell
[1:46:31] and then we'll see what the restoration
[1:46:32] looks like and our goal is to look at
[1:46:34] what the restoration looks like not at
[1:46:36] what the curse is in between amen
[1:46:39] amen we want to look at the into what
[1:46:40] god thinks about these things and then
[1:46:42] compare what we're doing and how we're
[1:46:44] thinking with the word of god
[1:46:46] amen because what we're feeding on can
[1:46:47] color our thinking if it's not the word
[1:46:49] of god and i guarantee you as we go
[1:46:51] through this and i speak of this
[1:46:52] personally we'll start to see satan
[1:46:55] trying to hide as an angel of light in
[1:46:56] areas of our life
[1:46:58] it's just like i said unless you're
[1:47:00] sinless
[1:47:01] you can't say that you don't have any
[1:47:03] satanic influence in your life so the
[1:47:04] goal here is to show the heavenly
[1:47:06] pattern you compare to that and say
[1:47:08] where is satan working in my life
[1:47:09] where's satan working in my marriage
[1:47:11] where's satan looking in my identity
[1:47:13] we're saying looking at how i spend my
[1:47:15] time
[1:47:16] we're saying working in my music
[1:47:18] all of these different things whatever
[1:47:19] it might be if we can take it back to
[1:47:21] the heavenly pattern then that scripture
[1:47:23] says that which maketh manifest is light
[1:47:25] and so if the word comes and it points
[1:47:27] and it puts a finger on our life that's
[1:47:29] god amen and we can say satan now you're
[1:47:32] exposed and we can now do what we can
[1:47:35] loose the holy spirit to kick that out
[1:47:36] because we say lord i'm going to
[1:47:37] surrender to your word rather than what
[1:47:39] i thought was the word i was going to
[1:47:41] surrender to your holy spirit rather
[1:47:42] than what i thought was the holy spirit
[1:47:44] because the word says this and what i
[1:47:46] thought says that
[1:47:47] and only the word can be true amen so
[1:47:50] let's go back to the word and that'll
[1:47:51] expose satan for the liar that he is and
[1:47:53] all of a sudden he has no power in our
[1:47:54] lives
[1:47:55] amen
[1:47:59] finishing this off
[1:48:01] jesus said give us this day our daily
[1:48:03] bread and many gave him fresh manna
[1:48:05] every day
[1:48:06] amen
[1:48:08] we read there where it says man shall
[1:48:09] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:48:11] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:48:12] god him and that's a fresh anointing a
[1:48:14] fresh food a fresh energy
[1:48:17] right the fresh kill of the word was
[1:48:18] what brother adam called it every day he
[1:48:21] says after the eagles are done with it
[1:48:23] the other ones come and they feed on it
[1:48:25] he says and that's why you get all these
[1:48:26] crazy things and
[1:48:28] forgive me i i
[1:48:29] i'll mention it just because it's it's
[1:48:31] horrible at the same time i guess
[1:48:34] but you know the youtube algorithm
[1:48:36] throws weird things your way sometimes
[1:48:38] and i've seen these church fail videos
[1:48:40] and what they call
[1:48:42] holy ghost filled services now
[1:48:44] it is incredible
[1:48:46] that what they've taken what the holy
[1:48:47] ghost did even the azusa street revival
[1:48:50] and what they do now the craziness they
[1:48:52] call they've got they've got i saw a
[1:48:54] prophet in africa that was trying to do
[1:48:56] the brother branham thing but what
[1:48:57] happened was he forgot what he was
[1:48:58] supposed to say and the person forgot
[1:49:01] what she was supposed to say and so they
[1:49:02] got it all mixed up and he's trying to
[1:49:03] make it look like he's got discernment
[1:49:05] up there what is it they're feeding on
[1:49:07] on what a rotten word from another age
[1:49:10] from another time god already came and
[1:49:12] vindicated that and then what happens
[1:49:14] after that is all of the copycats come
[1:49:15] behind it and try to make it look like
[1:49:17] they had what he had amen but what
[1:49:19] happened the word has moved on the life
[1:49:21] has moved on there's a fresh word every
[1:49:22] day that's drawing us back to what the
[1:49:25] original source say man it's coming from
[1:49:26] the original source
[1:49:28] jesus said and forgive us our debts as
[1:49:30] we forgive our debts other places says
[1:49:32] forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
[1:49:35] those that trespass against us amen
[1:49:38] that one we need help on doesn't it
[1:49:41] don't we what he says don't ask
[1:49:43] forgiveness if you're not giving
[1:49:44] forgiveness amen let us be merciful in
[1:49:46] order to obtain mercy amen
[1:49:50] he says and lead us not in temptation
[1:49:53] but deliver us from evil scripture says
[1:49:55] that god doesn't tempt us he says but we
[1:49:57] do it when we're led aside of our own
[1:49:58] lusts that's what happened
[1:50:00] but god does what he allows us to be
[1:50:02] tried
[1:50:03] amen but we don't get sucked we don't he
[1:50:06] doesn't he doesn't pull us into things
[1:50:07] but we get pulled into things and then
[1:50:09] we got to decide what do we really
[1:50:11] believe what do we really want here what
[1:50:12] do we really have living inside of us he
[1:50:15] says and lead us not into temptation but
[1:50:17] deliver us from evil now watch this he
[1:50:19] says
[1:50:21] after all this is done after this prayer
[1:50:23] comes through
[1:50:24] when this prayer is made manifest it
[1:50:26] says for thine is the kingdom
[1:50:29] it starts with him
[1:50:30] and it finishes with him
[1:50:32] thine is the kingdom
[1:50:34] thine is the power we're not going to
[1:50:35] get there on our own we're not going to
[1:50:37] do this of our own but the power that
[1:50:39] brings us is his he says and the glory
[1:50:42] is yours as well he says forever
[1:50:45] amen the the reflection of our life that
[1:50:48] that perfect reflection is all of his
[1:50:51] power and is all of his holy spirit
[1:50:53] working in us and the glory that comes
[1:50:55] out of it all belongs to him as well
[1:50:56] amen what we're doing is for him it's
[1:50:58] not for us and then it says what amen
[1:51:02] so be it
[1:51:03] right be it unto me according to thy
[1:51:05] word is what he's saying amen let's
[1:51:07] stand together if we would
[1:51:12] like i said just setting the foundation
[1:51:13] here
[1:51:15] and then that we'll start looking at
[1:51:17] heavenly patterns we'll start looking at
[1:51:19] kingdom patterns
[1:51:20] for some of the things that for the way
[1:51:22] we live for who we are how we identify
[1:51:25] all these different things and
[1:51:27] we'll start digging in amen
[1:51:30] pray for me it's uh when you start
[1:51:32] digging into personal things
[1:51:34] there's a there's an element of self
[1:51:36] that can easily creep in and i want to
[1:51:37] stick it just with the word and then we
[1:51:40] want to take it back to the scriptures
[1:51:41] and if the scriptures can't say it then
[1:51:42] i don't want to say it i don't want to
[1:51:44] be colored by that and that takes uh
[1:51:45] that takes a lot of prayer and that
[1:51:47] takes a lot of just you've got to be
[1:51:49] real careful with it so and then just
[1:51:50] pray for me as i go through this
[1:51:52] and we'll trust god the blessing today
[1:51:54] man let's just bow our heads if we would
[1:51:57] heavenly father
[1:52:00] lord we love that lord when the enemy
[1:52:02] comes in like a flood the holy spirit
[1:52:04] raises up a standard lord god
[1:52:06] and lord you've been challenging me
[1:52:09] lord and we're bringing that challenge
[1:52:10] now to your people
[1:52:12] lord that we would now look at ourselves
[1:52:14] more completely through the the filter
[1:52:16] through the mirror of the word lord god
[1:52:18] and lord that we want to compare the
[1:52:20] image of what we see
[1:52:22] versus what we're supposed to see
[1:52:24] heavenly father and lord as we start to
[1:52:26] dive into these things lord may we just
[1:52:28] be honest with ourselves lord may we
[1:52:30] just humble ourselves not look to the
[1:52:32] left or right
[1:52:33] lord not look to the brother or sister
[1:52:35] that's sitting next to us but lord may
[1:52:37] we look to our own selves lord may we
[1:52:39] say lord let me be the reflection let me
[1:52:42] do my part let me be what you've made me
[1:52:44] to be lord and then we'll hold up the
[1:52:46] other one in prayer if we've got time
[1:52:48] left lord we pray your grace to your
[1:52:50] people lord strengthen us encourage us
[1:52:52] lord we don't want to beat ourselves
[1:52:54] down lord we know that when your word
[1:52:56] corrects it always gives us a remedy
[1:52:58] lord it always gives us a way of of
[1:53:00] returning back to you and lord that's
[1:53:02] what we want to focus on is that your
[1:53:04] word is made away and it's through the
[1:53:05] blood of jesus christ lord in the
[1:53:07] quickening power of the holy spirit in
[1:53:09] our lives lord may we just look to you
[1:53:11] for all these things for we're trusting
[1:53:13] you now in your name we ask and pray
[1:53:16] amen
[1:53:18] let's sing that song i am resolved no
[1:53:21] longer to linger 223

[2:12:28] bless the lord let's just sing before we
[2:12:30] go listening 742 i was born to be a
[2:12:32] dwelling place seems appropriate
[2:12:37] after what was preached and
[2:12:40] we'll come to that by grace i would say
[2:12:42] at the end of the series we will
[2:12:46] certainly
[2:12:47] or certainly believe that that we were
[2:12:49] truly born to be a dwelling place and we
[2:12:51] want to clean everything out so that god
[2:12:53] can actually be the one who dwells in
[2:12:56] this dwelling place
[2:12:57] amen
[2:12:58] and
[2:13:00] one part of john was was preaching or
[2:13:02] teaching
[2:13:04] all i could see was
[2:13:07] the purpose of god here is to take me
[2:13:09] out
[2:13:10] is to eliminate me
[2:13:12] right all my thoughts all my ideas
[2:13:15] take me out of this right and let god
[2:13:18] take control that
[2:13:20] seems to be where you're going here
[2:13:21] right
[2:13:22] and that's that's the way i feel that's
[2:13:24] the way the voice is speaking to me
[2:13:26] and i'm going to hold on to that because
[2:13:29] i'm trying not to sing lies here
[2:13:32] you know to be honest
[2:13:34] i want you know and i believe we all do
[2:13:36] as as the bride of christ
[2:13:38] to humble ourselves completely and not
[2:13:40] exalt ourselves in any way not at all
[2:13:44] not at all let god do the exalting i'll
[2:13:46] just be glad to just like we're saying
[2:13:48] to cast our crowns at the feet of his
[2:13:50] jesus those who grace abounds and those
[2:13:53] who found the feet of jesus what does
[2:13:55] that mean you've humbled yourself to
[2:13:58] come down to that level
[2:14:00] to the feet of jesus christ
[2:14:03] amen sorry about that but i just feel
[2:14:05] that that's
[2:14:06] that's where god wants us to go
[2:14:08] the raptures might take place
[2:14:12] would we want to hold on to anything
[2:14:13] that doesn't please christ
[2:14:15] that doesn't make sense right when you
[2:14:17] think about it
[2:14:18] amen let him have praise
[2:14:21] and
[2:14:22] make this a prayer
[2:14:24] i'm going to ask brother man to come and
[2:14:25] close in prayer
[2:14:27] and just make this a prayer god help me
[2:14:30] to let you have me as a dwelling place
[2:14:33] amen let's just say it

[2:14:37] was born
