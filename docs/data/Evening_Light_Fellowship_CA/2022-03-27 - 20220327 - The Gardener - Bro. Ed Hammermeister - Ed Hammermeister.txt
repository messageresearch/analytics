in the house of the lord amen sure appreciate the musicians and the specials and the atmosphere and and just the gathering that is here and you know i'm the one who came to minister but i feel like i got ministered to a little bit so i i thank you for this fellowship and certainly have enjoyed the atmosphere and and the fellowship everywhere we go in the world there's nothing like the life of christ in the body of christ and it was a number of years ago my wife and i we went to ukraine actually and we were in donetsk it's the russian part of of ukraine and we were there for i think 54 56 hours we had three services we couldn't speak the language and we left it was with like tears in our eyes because we become bonded together with those people that just can't be reproduced so we feel like that here a little bit too like it's we'd like to take some of you home with us and you know we we've certainly enjoyed it and and uh i'm gonna miss some things here i'm gonna miss some of the singing and the worship i'm gonna miss the pitter-patter of feet in the morning and uh and as i said earlier you know they've got three boys and so i'm not pointing to selena doing all of that i'm pointing to the boys doing all of that so but uh they've been a blessing so and this morning i think jensen had said he said are you is this the last service and and i thought he's going to say oh thankfully but he didn't he said i love special services and i thought wow that's great that's a great expectation to have so we've certainly enjoyed it i think brother dale if you've enjoyed the time here and enjoyed having you just pray for the perfect will of god in brother dale's life we sure appreciate him i know he's got a family back home that really loves them too and we appreciate them in the church but we want god's will in all things so so this morning we we want to look to the word of god again and and sometimes you know we we just want to be ourselves and so i want to be myself this morning i learned a long time ago i i played football i played sports when i was younger i played the high school football team i wasn't saved at the time but i was i was a junior that year and i i watched the first game of the season and the captain came out and the coaches left the room and were in the room and and the captains are there and the big burly guys and so they picked up their helmet and they threw it against the wall are we gonna kill them are we gonna and everybody just jumped around and rallied around and we all ran out in the field and we just burned into the field so the next year i was captain of the team and i thought well that's what captains do so i picked up my helmet threw it again so are we going to kill him and everybody sat there like oh you got to be who you are so i can't be the fiery evangelist i got to be brother ed and so that's what i want to be and and we we just we certainly don't want to to be more than we're not and um you know so we want to just let god have his way do you do you know i just want to sing a little bit of that song let your word be born in the manger of my heart and just before we turn to the word this morning [Music] let's start with this be it unto me be is it oh okay there it is okay let your word be born in the manger of my heart [Music] is [Music] let's sing it one more time [Music] on the way [Music] [Music] amen as we bow our heads this morning heavenly father we're here this morning and lord we're so thankful for your bringing us together this way today lord we know that you've had a purpose from the very foundation of the world and lord you've looked into the yawns of time you know even where we're at you know where every life is at this morning you know every detail of our lives you are god and there is no one like you oh lord father we're so grateful that we have a heavenly father we're inviting you this morning one more time lord would you come into our midst today lord may it be known by the breaking of bread by the word that it's you that's in our midst lord it's not the working of man but it's you it's jesus that we really want to see lord come to every heart come to every person oh god we invite you this morning take the frailty of man the insufficiencies but lord may you be that missing part lord the part we can't do oh lord you are that one father this morning we ask your blessing your anointing upon the word as we open the pages of the bible may you o lord give the inspiration the unction may you give the revelation may you drop it in our hearts and may you also bring the forth a manifestation father we know we're in that hour may you bless us now we thank you for it in jesus name amen amen thank you to the musicians god bless you well we'll invite you to turn to the book of genesis genesis chapter 2 and i'll just cover all of genesis to revelations in my opening scriptures i'll go in genesis 2 and then in revelations 8. how does that sound and then we'll we'll just try and preach a little in between genesis 2 we'll start reading in verse 1 and it's a seed chapter it's so much always in these books as we read verse 1 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and he sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all the work which god created and made verse four these are the generations of the heaven heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground so it looked like it was all quiet it looked like there was nothing happening but there was something at work that could not be seen and it began to manifest and plants began to come up and all of these things and it seemingly didn't didn't know how it came but it came from within it came from a mist of the earth it wasn't an outward rain it wasn't all these other things but it was a mist of the earth and it watered the whole face of the ground verse 6 verse 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil we find from that a river went forth it parted had four heads but drop down to verse 15 and the lord god took the man and he put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it to dress it and to keep it revelations chapter 8 just read one verse i might not come to this till later in the service but i will the lord willing bring it into where we go revelations eight i'll just read from verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen god bless his word this morning you may have your seats i'm going to ask you also to turn over to john chapter 20 john chapter 20. and not that this isn't relevant but it's maybe not so much in the entire theme of where i'm going but i do want to bring this in and i'll just read a little portion of this it was the first day of the week when cometh in verse 1 cometh mary magdalene early it was yet dark unto the sepulcher and seeing the stone from the sepulcher now i'll i'll forego some of the reading but she it was early and she'd come to the sepulcher where jesus was and saw the stone rolled away so the first thing she did she went to his disciples and she called simon peter and she called john and and he said they've taken the lord away and peter began to go forth and the other disciple and it says they ran together then the scriptures also declare that john was faster than peter because he outran him and he came first and you know it's interesting that john wrote this and he didn't put his own name because he wasn't boasting but he said the other disciple that was with peter outran him you know and so sometimes it was like in the third person and so it says in verse five and he stooped down he looked and he saw the linen clothes lying yet he went not in um so he's standing there he came up to it he's respectful but peter you know the bold one he followed him he just burst right in he saw the clothes there this is really interesting to me and in verse 7 and the napkin which was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but it was wrapped together in a place to itself so it was interesting they thought you know out of all of the analogies they stole his body what kind of a soldier is going to steal his body or disciples going to steal his body then take the napkin off his head and fold it quietly down on the side and leave the rest laying there all of these things are for a reason can you imagine what happened somewhere in all of this jesus awoke he arose he took the napkin off he folded it he left the clothes it was the lord it was him that was working so then he it says in verse 8 then came in the other disciple and and it said they didn't know the scriptures that the lord had risen from the dead and they went home but mary she remained in verse 11 mary stood outside the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked at the sepulcher and now here's an amazing thing two angels were sitting and she saw two angels in white sitting there one at the head the other at the feet wherein the body of jesus had lain and they they began speaking to her and said woman why are you weeping she said because they've taken away my lord and i don't know where they've laid him and when she thus said she turned back now she's just speaking to angels and now she turns around and she saw jesus standing but she didn't know it was jesus and jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh thou now she goes from this experience of the angels these events and everything and then she sees him and then she says this next verse she supposed him to be the gardener you know so she thought oh this is just one of the workers that's here he's the gardener and she said sir if you have if thou has borne him hence tell me where you've laid him and i will take him away and out of all the words she heard these next words that would come for had the most profound effect on her and it was jesus himself saying unto her and he said mary now there's nothing so great as to hear your own name amen and yet to hear your own name from the lips of god or jesus would be the greatest name to know that he has spoken personally to you that's the greatest thing that we could ever have and she so posed him to be a guardish as mary and turned herself and said rabboni which is to say master now i'm not going to read into all of the rest but he'll he said don't touch me and and mary came to the disciples but i'm drawing from this and like i said this may not be as much where i'm going but i want to speak this morning and this may seem simple but i want to speak on the gardener and so i'm going to ask you just to bear with me as i do that i was talking to brother ron spencer one time and he was sharing to me he was at some special meetings and there was quite a crowd that was gathered and he'd spoke three services and he's coming up to the sunday morning service and he said this is the one that he'd actually prepared for and this is something god had laid on my heart and it seems strange but i i'm just following the lord and this this example will tell you that but he said he was coming to the last service he'd preach the saturday night and now he's coming to the sunday morning and as he's coming that saturday night he's looking at his text he's saying that's not going to work and and the lord directed him to a scripture about the woman caught in adultery and he's going lord this is a convention these are seasoned uh believers these are are all people they've gathered this this is this is like not this doesn't fit in my mind this this doesn't fit and and he couldn't get away from and he said i've learned long time ago he says just follow the lord so i'm i i'm doing the same thing and so brother ron as he tells the account he says he came to this service and you know he apologized for what he was saying and he did all of these things and and he started preaching it and he he was going into the service and as he's going into the service he's about two-thirds of the way through and there's a weeping and there's a wailing and and a woman just comes running up to the front and casts herself at the altar and starts weeping and crying and what he didn't know is she was a prostitute who was going to kill herself the night before and some believer had invited her to the service hallelujah god knows everything amen and brother ron said it taught him a huge lesson god is so sovereign he knows what he's doing so this morning we believe that same god i'm not saying it's the same way but i i so appreciate the lord i so appreciate him being mindful of every one of us he knows everyone here today he knows all things go with me to the book of matthew chapter 11. i want to speak first of all if i break this into little thoughts i want to speak a little bit on our expectations and on our expectations and i'm going to use john for a moment here and this is in matthew chapter 11 verse 2 and and now john was the forerunner before jesus christ he was a part of the five comings of elijah he was the forerunner that was identified in malachi 4. there's another forerunner identified in malachi 4. but but he he's he's he's one of them now matthew chapter 11 would talk about this and i want to read verse 2. john was in prison and when john had heard in prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and he said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another and jesus answered and said unto him so here is john he's the one who in the spirit had seen jesus had seen his coming was at the river was baptizing him pointed to him said behold the lamb of god and now he's out from under that anointing and he's asking this question and brother bannon would say his eagle eye got filmed over but he's asking the question to his disciples go ask jesus are you the one that should come or do we look for another now in other words he must have had an expectation he knew the anointing he was under he knew what he was pointing to he knew this was god's fire burning through his bones and he looked at it but when he saw the manifestation he's thought this can't be it this this is surely this isn't it i'm expecting more and so here he's sitting there and he's saying art though he that should come or do we look for another and jesus answered and he said unto him go and show john again the things that you do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and then he says these words in verse 6 and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now so there was an offense that came with what the eye would look on in the ministry of jesus and i'm going to read this a little bit out of the message that that brother branham would speak and it's entitled the forgotten beatitude in 1961 but he says john said he knew that was the messiah john said i don't know him but it's the one that the wilderness in the wilderness he says i upon whom you see the spirit descending that will baptize with holy ghost and fire verse and the brother man says but when the trouble set in jesus come and showed the messiah that he was the messiah but then something went wrong john had introduced the messiah with a fan in his hand going to burn up the chaff and he turned out the works of christ he was and it says this he was meek and lowly and it worried him now this is amazing because the expectation is you know i'm setting for something greater but he's meek and he's lowly and it worried him this is exact words he says he didn't know what to say he said now there's something wrong here somewhere now it seemed he hadn't believed it seemed he had believed the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working out right now don't just put john over here put yourself that way how often have we gone through things and we think this can't be god this surely this isn't it and yet in in the middle of all this it's not working out right you know whatever our our personality is sometimes there's some of us that build bridges and and we think it has to be a certain way you know and and if this doesn't come this way you know we cross our bridges before we come you know sometimes we come to church and we think it has to be in this order it has to be this way and if it's not that way it throws us for a loop but god does things in his own way and we want to be able to always be open you know i there was a brother i think it was brother doug mckees i may be wrong on that but uh my brother brother was sharing it with me the other day and it was just profound to me brother daniel andes who had grown up around jeffersonville and he he tells the story how brother doug had in his mind that you come to the pulpit you always dress a certain way you have long sleeves you do such and such you do this and he'd come to a meeting and brother branham was preaching and in the middle of the service brother madam takes his coat off and he had short sleeves on and brother doug was horrified he goes this can't be a man of god he has short sleeves on and brother bam took his took them off for a little bit and then he put his coat back on and he and then he just said something across the pulpit i don't know what it was see it's not always what we think [Laughter] i think god knows exactly where we're at i think it was said in prayer this morning again we don't try and put god in a box we we don't try and predetermine the manifestation the manifestation and we're living in manifesting times we don't try to do it we want to just create the atmosphere and the place for god to work and whatever he chooses to do he chooses to do i i i appreciate all of that so brother madam goes on to say it's not working out right and many times we think that too it isn't working out right as long as we know that he's here what difference does it make it says it's working right maybe it isn't working according to the way we think it ought to work but it's working according to the way that god wants it to work so we went into that a little bit when we read mark chapter 11 yesterday when we predetermined there has to be a certain manifestation jesus spoke to the tree you didn't know i didn't know that it would start to dry up from the roots we thought maybe the fig trees any the branches will wither but it started from the roots it was evident god had spoken to it and so here we sometimes we're we're building our relationship not on what our eyes can see but on trust and upon faith and sometimes we pray things and we pray for situations and we think it's going to happen this way you know we think oh i whatever your need may be it's a financial need and sometimes we begin to work it out and we think okay i know it's not right to buy lottery tickets but this is a good you know it's for a hospital charity and maybe this is how god will solve all my issues that's generally not the way god works and so we always look for god to fulfill himself he works in an unusual way he displays his characteristics in an unusual way and it goes beyond our thinking it operates on a level beyond what we think so christ's expectation you know here i i always marvel at at uh at our human nature and you you type in the words prone to think and and brother baby says too often that's how man's prone to think and i found myself many times in that side yeah i've been prone to think that way you know jesus calling the disciples he called a peter he called an andrew he called simon the canaanite who they called simon the zealot i mean a matthew who was a tax collector and and i don't know if you've seen any of that of the chosen but it kind of brought some thoughts to my mind i thought you know these disciples they're going you picked him and he says i picked you didn't i and and so we sometimes think you know who's in charge here and what's this whole thing about but god's in control he knows how it is so sometimes we think oh you know this you know the message and we take the message and we try to make it fit who what we think it should be if you come from a pentecostal background you think well it's going to be signs and wonders it's going to be this and that happening every service and and and if you're if you allow that to carry forward you push into something and it's about the sister that came to brother branham and she wanted the holy ghost and brother bannon would say to her and she was a fine sister she had the holy ghost but she desired to have speaking in tongues and brother adam looked he says and i saw that she was born in a split condition under a four i don't know what that means any any and he said this so i advised i asked the lord to help her and allow her to speak in tongues so it would help her but he says you see if you do that to everybody you know you'll cause somebody it's not our natural makeup the holy ghost expresses himself in many ways our our natural is sometimes god uses a minister to bless us and and we think oh this is the minister this is the guy for the hour this is the one i want to follow i'm going to stream all his services i i made that mistake years ago and i i had a minister that came through and was a blessing and i thought next time we come and i was just looking at this is going to be tremendous and and i was looking to him and it just like it's not the same what's going on and and it was i realized keep my eyes on god first see if we could we'd build a perfect minister we'd build we'd build somebody fiery like brother donnie we'd somebody we'd have somebody like brother paul who could who could speak or it could just drop into a song at the end of the service then we'd take somebody who'd go into deep things in teaching and we'd build this minister in our mind you know and we think and if we had that everybody would be running around the country after this one guy but god so designed it he took little parts of everybody and he gave a little bit to this one he gave a little bit to that one a little bit to that one and what we need to see is christ in every one of those gifts and we don't need to just look on a personality or look on a man but we need to see him he's the one who's in the center of it all he's the main one the message you know and we we group the message oh it's just a further part of this it's this and this i'll give you an example our pastor brother harold used this and i found it to be a blessing but there was these four blind men they went to a circus and so they all went to the circus and they all went to see the elephant and they came back with a report and they were comparing notes okay what did you see in the elephant and you know what do you think an elephant is and so one of them said it's a trunk it's like a tree trunk i put my arms around it's a tree trunk for sure and the other guy says you're crazy it's not a tree trunk it's a wall i touch this item it's a wall i can tell you right now it's a wall and the other guy says what were you two guys looking at blind man right where were you two guys looking at what were you feeling and the last guy said the one guy says well you know what it's like a rope i was there and he was touching his tail it was a rope i felt it it was a rope i don't know where you guys getting the wall thing from i don't know where you're getting the you know the the trunk thing from and the last guy said oh you guys are behind it it's like a vacuum cleaner hose i saw it it's a trunk i i felt it it's a vacuum and they're all comparing notes they didn't know is the was was the message one of those things or was it all of those things the message is everything it is signs and gifts it is wonders it is emotion it is work it is teaching it's all of those things it's god in every part of it so we don't put god in a box we want to allow him to be god we want to allow him to be who he is and he's he is everything amen we were going through church order at home one time and and i came across the thing where brother madam said jesus was a trustee he was a deacon he was a minister he was all of these things in one and he takes out he was a trustee because he was able to get the gold coin out of the fish and he was he was a deacon because he set this in order and he was the teacher and he was the minister it's all a part of him that's the one you want to see i'll tell you what it's when there was up on mount transfiguration and and there was moses and elijah there and and then peter's going let's build three tabernacles one for this and this well when the when the voice spoke from heaven and the thunder cleared there was one left and that one was jesus there was none other when this whole thing is over it won't be our favorite preacher it won't be everything there'll be one there when we get to heaven there'll be one there that's the one we need to see now we can't look at and get caught up with these things as much as that's our human nature but we want to have him we want to see him in the center amen so there's an expectation sometimes if we're not careful we allow our expectation to to go in a certain way and and whether it's our our nature it's our order or whatever these things are we we want to be able to see jesus in it all just to finish the quote here's john the baptist he says i introduced the messiah he had the fan in his hand i thought he was going to purge the floors i thought he was going to take the wheat to the garner i i thought he was going to take the axe to the root of the tree he's going to take all the trash and burn it up this great mighty man but here he comes meek and lowly something must have went wrong somewhere there's no doubt something's wrong somewhere you know we we came out of if you look at the message and how it came and how it said in malachi 4 it would arise with healing in his wings and we saw a first pull and it was a manifestation that that actually really touched the flesh realm and and and it touched the flesh realm and brother ben had a sign that he would it would show up in his flesh and then the second pull came and it went into the spirit realm and he could discern and it seemed like it was coming higher and yet the third pull we were all are expecting oh yeah it's speaking the word into existence and all of these things and it seemed like that wasn't how it actually went it seemed i went up up and then it dropped down and you can see that in the reflection of brother branham's life in the mountain range in idaho where it says you know here's your life in the ministry these seven peaks and this is when this is the first pool this is the second pool and then it dropped down it seemed like it wasn't as prominent or as visible but yet it was the greatest and brother man would say that third poll it won't be a public show it's going to be greater than all the rest but it's not according to our thinking or our expectation and and and you know much of the world is now looking you know as we're coming to world war three this the coming of the lord is here you know different people have different expectation i don't know what they call those groups of people that prepare for the tribulation they give them a name and and they you know they're they're got goods and you can go on to these websites and they're talking about the coming of the lord and says and you can buy your canned goods here and you can buy these things here they're preparing for something else but that's not the expectation we're under we're looking for one there's a man that can turn on the light he's gonna come just in time he's never been late yet he will be here just in time he'll take care of my situation he's always been faithful [Music] now we took this let me let me finish this off i just john became dismayed like many of us do we see things that's going on that isn't just right we become dismayed don't be weary the brother man says the devil got a hold of him in in jail there he said i throw him in jail and and so he he put a blanket over him he got him all caged up like an eagle in the cage that's the way he does to many there's many a good man in that shape today we think it ain't working out right but it's working right so we don't look with our eyes just stay about the father's business don't don't worry about trying to produce something or manifest something we're we're sheep we can't manufacture wool we bear wool we just eat food we we those things and the world comes out naturally amen luke chapter 23. i just want to go back to this just for a moment we read this yesterday about pilate and and how jesus came before him and and pilate and you know jesus just changed the narrative sometimes you know you people come and the devil you know makes his boasts like a goliath over david he makes his boast in the time you live in people that have gone for the message well what about this what about this and you know what sometimes you don't answer a word other times you just change the question say okay what's your ministry and what are you pointing to we had two men that have been going around the country to to message churches all over tearing them down and well not tearing them down but coming to be critical and coming to do this and coming to do that and they they they've been notorious i don't know if maybe newfoundland so out of the way that they haven't come here but but i i don't know what it is and and some brothers you know some of the minister friends i got said yeah we showed them a little five-fold ministry and then i go you didn't actually punch them no we didn't do that but we ushered them out rather briskly he said so and and and and and so these two men came in and i happened to know one of them and i thought like how in the world did you ever end up in this state and i he came to our church and i kind of circumvented it i just addressed him from the book nice to see you why don't we chat after service you know and and so we chatted after service we met two hours they were just telling us everything that's wrong with the message everything that's this and this and this and then i finally said okay what's your ministry amen and it says where's your fruit where's what you're what are you pointing to well that's not who we're here we're just against i mean there's people like that all over the world that are against things there's nothing positive you know you you try and be positive people say spring's coming yeah but it won't be too long before winter's here again you know it's a nice day out there well it'll probably snow tomorrow and like i'm not going just leave me alone don't have me don't hang around me please and so you know it's it's there's these people like that so here's jesus he changes the narrative to pilate but now i want you to look at there's a manifestation happening jesus is the word that is born and and he's coming to the fullness of the word and as the word comes to the fullness and that's we maybe didn't articulate it quite right yesterday but the seed there you know there's a there's a promise of a seed that was born of a woman and and in the garden of eden when when god when satan heard god addressed that there'll be a seed born of a woman i'll tell you what his attention was on two things that was a woman and that was the seed that would come through that woman because he knew that was what was raised up it was prophesied that that would bruise his head so every time you look in the bible you can look at god meeting abraham and sarah there was a womb there there was a promise there but the day that they had the visitation sarah was cranky brother branham would say it that we just outright he'd said it and he says why because satan was trying to upset the apple card every time you look at god doing something so here it was that way at the birth of mary at the birth of jesus when mary was there but now the word is coming to fullness and manifestation and as it's coming to fullness and manifestation everything starts to gather around it because we're spirit beings we are the spirit of god by the seed word of god and as we're the seed every other in a spirit realm you can't detect it but it starts to come against you i i know people that have come and stood for this message and and you want to believe that don't believe it but why do you have to stop drinking why do you have to stop smoking why do you have to stop doing this why do you have and what the people don't like is the life if they're of a contrary life now some will respect it god bless them for it group of friends that i had one day five guys i used to hang around with and uh i i left and i just had to go my way and and it was a year later one of my friends he invited me to be a best man at his wedding and and i at first thought you know we were best friends and everything we'd agreed on this years ago and when it came to it i just i realized i'm not where i used to be i'm a christian if i go to this wedding i'll have to participate in toast i'll have to participate in dancing and i told him rod i'm gonna come to the wedding but why don't you have somebody else be the best man i'll just just be there and so i went there i ended up sitting at the table with a lot of my former friends and were sitting there you know they'd all looked at me and said something's wrong with ed like he's gone off he's he's way this so as the evening went on a little bit the program was going on they were drinking and and all sudden one of the guys across the table he says so who says you got to go to church every sunday anyway and everybody's looking at me i go so you're talking to me you're talking to me yeah i'm talking to you and it was like at that moment god just gave me a thing and this other this fella his name was ron and i said ron you just got married i said do you go home every night because you have to no i want to that's the same way i feel about church i don't have to i want to everybody nodded said that's pretty good they went back to drinking i went back to being safe and i was okay so so you know we thank god for that but when the word comes on the scene when the life comes on the scene when that seed comes forth that's when the devil rises up now listen to this narrative this is in luke chapter 23 this is actually a similar passage to what we read in john 18 yesterday but it says you know and this is when pilate or when jesus comes before pilate pilate sends them to herod because it was inherits jurisdiction and then herod sends them back to pilate and this in verse 11 and herod with his men at war of war set at naught and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him to pilate now here listen to this next scripture and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together before that they were at enmity among themselves when the word rises listen there's only two spirits in the world when the word rises all the other spirits gather in unity against it that's what's going to happen to israel that's what's going to happen to the bride now i'm i'm going to take my jacket off today and i'm wearing long sleeves in case anybody's worried about that now i'm just going to bring it right down to home and i'm not going to mince words when you look at the what they call the believe the sign people and when they made their stand and they ate what they called their humble pie and made their apology there was another man over in jeffersonville who also you know had a similar disputation these two had nothing in common nothing in common but when when one of them stood up the other one in jeffersonville i i happened to follow and i caught the dialogue and he said let's pray for our brothers as they take their stand now same spirits we're living in the same world that jesus lived in we've got a seed we've got a life of god it's not our own life it's not our own seed but it's the same manifestations around us so i i just dropped that in quickly so when the word comes on the scene then then all these other things happen let's go over to galatians chapter 4 verse 19. galatians 4 verse 19. now the galatians were an interesting people because you know they they they had their dues and their don'ts and they loved their dues and their don'ts and and and paul was trying to swing them over to grace and he was trying to get this thing and and he began to be worried about them because you know he started telling him you observe times and seasons you do all these things i fear for you but it comes down to this in verse 19 and this is paul's burden for them and he says my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you so paul's burden was not just to get them that the tapes not just to get them the letters if i can call it that the epistles but it was to see a manifestation of life paul was a real husbandman and i'm just going to use that phrase i'm going to come to it a little bit in the message here but a husbandman is different than a hireling a higher length the bible says in one place a higher length days are or one year it says another place they're three years you look at this there can be a lot of hireling preachers it can be somebody just says hey i'm i'm here i'm available how much are you gonna pay me what's my salary i got it but somebody who's actually born for the job somebody who has a burden for the people that's whose god god looks at as a husbandman and i'm saying that doesn't apply to us to ministers that applies to fathers that applies to deacons we have more of an interest in it as as in of being our own work this is god's work and it's greater than what we can do and we've been entrusted with it therefore we take great care in how we handle things are you with me i'm moving towards things here so paul's burden was till christ be warm so again satan is after that seed i'm going to tie this through with something that brother brahma says in a message we have seen a star and come to worship him he says when christ jesus was being formed in mary that's when the persecution set in that's when it started that's the same thing in you when christ the hope of glory is formed in you that's when you are dying and when christ is coming to life watch the persecution set in watch trouble start on every road watch the devil go on a rampage when christ is formed in you so as we come closer to that don't worry about these things they're going to be there but we got our mind fixed on one thing it's that i may be as christ is that i may be that part that he wants me to be nothing more nothing less and he says and as christ was being formed in mary quickly come the king's commandment all you people and here christ was becoming a full baby ready to be livered right till the time of the persecution brother bran will go on and say this baby's been formed a long time it's it's coming in the last days when the completeness the fullness of the godhead the fullness of christ is to be manifest in the people he said so he promised it in his word and that's when unusual things happen that's the reason our great social lives and things can't understand it it's foolishness to them now watch they're forming a council of churches and when the church is beginning to get on its feet when the great supernatural begins to work they'll all go into a group and they're going to try and stop this stuff just exactly like it was then that's why we make much of these meetings much of our times together but i'll tell you there's a there's a quotation in brother and he relates it to um uh it's it's in 1950 and i think it's in the angel of the lord message and he refers to it and he says and he says those who follow the pillar of fire he says they'll have a rough time then he's talking about when when this persecution comes and all these things but he says but they'll be ready for the translation at that time i'm looking for his life to rise not not what i can produce not what i can manufacture but it's him among us that's what we're looking for let me let me bring this right into this this thing because it's it's it's our expectation sometimes that we look and sometimes we you know we try to manifest you know i got to be a christian i got to show myself approved and you know maybe i gotta sing louder maybe i gotta do this maybe i gotta make sure that i'm and it's not about what we do when you get to heaven you know there's not gonna be somebody saying okay how do you see serpentine okay check uh did you baptize okay check did you do this and sometimes that's the way we approach god in our life here that's not what we we want we till christ be formed in us where you're so in tune you know it's not yourself you know i i love a good cup of coffee and sometimes you know i'm in a hurry and alberta tends to go a little faster pace than newfoundland and sometimes you go and and and you just you come into a line and it's just to a tim hortons or whatever it is and you come in and there's a car that comes right in front oh man and you know you get upset i thought i have to wait a little longer i i just learned a little bit over time i think you know what so what that gives me a little chance to listen to a message or do something a little more and i don't worry about it and you know as important as coffee is sometimes and it's important sometimes but i'll tell you what they're you learn a little bit and you just learn okay it's not my nature you go listen to to the statue of a perfect man and brother madam will talk it says every believer has some elements or characteristics of faith virtue faith virtue patience slow down it and and and all of these things in themselves but he says but there's parts of it that we need god to come in and fill us you go listen to blasphemous names and i think it's in that or maybe it's statue it's the one just before but it's it's about the rock box in heaven and how it couldn't contain it and it's a wonderful study and it just came to me but but go look at it it's about god pouring a virtue in and it took honey to make it stick and and honey was representing the brotherly love and all of these things it's i i shouldn't i gotta slow down here okay now let me let me read the the further part of this here um this message has been a blessing to me it's how can i overcome and brother and brother let me read first from rising of the sun satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine and i i would say shamefully to us sometimes we have majored more on correctness of doctrine on mechanics than we have on manifestation but i believe god is changing that because i i i've learned something there are people we all come from walks of life and i don't look at where they're standing right now but i look at their trajectory which way are they pointing what are they trying to overcome and i'll work with anybody as long as that trajectory is there and even when it's not i'll work to get them turned around but we need to not analyze people you know sometimes we'll look and say okay that skirt is so long or that isn't long enough or they didn't do this and and we measure so much on that but what is their trajectory what's behind them what's behind that struggle and and we need to work with that so satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in your doctrine if you miss the life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how many churches you went how good you are it doesn't matter one thing unless you're born again and i say this you got to know it for yourself don't depend on somebody else you got to know it yourself how can i overcome brother branham would say in the past ages a christian could be for his profession beheaded for belonging to christ he could be killed put out of his ministry misery but now the enemy okay i gotta force myself to slow down i was i was visiting somebody one day and uh i was just trying to say thank you for the hospitality and it says and i came out and said thank you for the hostility so you gotta you gotta slow down sometimes you gotta watch your words a little bit anyway um he says now the enemy has come in it's a great age of deception christ said the two spirits would be so close in the last days he would deceive the very elected if possible now we're talking about two spirits he says people can live so close a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers and liars or gamblers they can live above that and still not with it that's right now a good message for that is and knoweth it not where brother branham will go through and he deals with those three realms and he says many times we serve god from a good conscience or or you know you can even have a good message conscience i you know i shouldn't do this i shouldn't do that but it goes deeper than that it goes where it begins to change your desires it's not so much out of fear it's out of what i can't do but it's about i've got liberty to do whatever because i'm in christ and in christ whatever he wants to do with me so he said this is the age of the personal life of christ the chemical of his body that was in him if we're trying to follow the message of the hour we should live constantly in the life of christ because if you don't do it and you lay around it says he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not it's a sin you become dodi rotten you're you have to stay in the life of christ then your fruit bearing so it's about staying in your channel it's not being more religious it's not about proving anything to god or proving anything to your parents or proving anything to the deacons or the the ministers look at what i'm doing no it's just about being you and being honest i i i'm just gonna be a little bit more transparent it's not about me coming here and talking down to anybody i'm a brother like all of you it's about me yielding to him and allowing him for our brothers who are leaders in our home it's not about us taking a top down approach and saying okay first of all say the message says i'm the head of the home and you pull out the quotes furthermore it says that you're all subject to me pull out the quotes and then you add in and i'm german so that entitles me to be more militant than everybody else no it's not about that so it's it's more about i'm the leader i've got a responsibility i've got to humble myself it's i read a book and and maybe some of my thoughts evolve out of this it's greater than that but um it was about a man in iraq his name was stanley mcchrystal he was the general in charge of leading the forces of of the united states and all of its you know people against the fighting of the al-qaeda forces and he said it was a war like no other war that we'd ever fought he said the enemy was in in every it wasn't in one geographic location it was in multiple locations and the enemy was empowered with an ideology many of them believing in the muslim or the uh the faith there that the minute they die for the cause they're going to cross over into the other side and there's 10 virgins waiting for them so many of them are empowered by this ideology they're willing to give their lives as wrong as it was they had a greater force than the united states coming against them and so this this general realized very quickly that their approach was up here i'm the general i've got my team of generals we spread out over all these locations then we got our captains and we got our lieutenants then we've got our sergeants and then we've got our foot soldiers so the orders come down they go by the time they got the orders down to the foot soldiers the enemy had moved the enemy had done something different it wasn't working the foot soldier said this doesn't work this is good for nothing and sometimes we're that way we we ca if we're not easy we can have this disconnect you know on one hand we've got the seals and the opening of the word and you know we we pull this ideology in church and then we get out of church and it's like monday okay i'll just do whatever i can do i can you know i'm this and you just just get the revelation no that's not how we do it so so this general he he actually said i realized i had to change our entire structure he said it couldn't be this top down i said i began to empower our soldiers at every level he told the captains now you have leeway you're entitled you're in a position you've got this much to do you do it you've got that authority just report back when you can and we need to be more flexible and i'm saying the world around us has changed it's not so much about going to movie theaters it's not so much about televisions it's about little devices it's about you know we got to be very careful i i i met a man it was a client of ours and i went to his home and he was a nominal christian he wasn't a message christian i admired what he did in his family when they came home there was a place at their back entrance they had actually eight kids that was admirable in this day and then i went in the back entrance all the phones were dropped in the back entrance they didn't come in the house when we're at the supper table he said we don't bring the phones to the supper table we interact i thought that's a good thing for us to learn we ought to recognize the influences the world that that was in a movie theater and in a television years ago is right at at the footsteps of our children and if we're not careful we need to be on top of it we need to be flexible and part of it is an example ourselves part of it is being transparent i don't know everything i need god as much as we all need god and we need to humble ourselves and be open to that men to wives and mothers to children and fathers to children this is part of of being a gardener is creating an atmosphere yeah now this this this man he wrote this book it's called a team of teams and in the book he when he recognized it he got a lot of resistance these these are generals says i've worked my way up the ranks to be put down and let you give orders direct to people below me he was a lot of resistance sometimes our mindset our expectation is at a different place and he says i realized my role wasn't a top-down approach anymore i realized my role had to be that of a gardener he actually used these words and in his book he had a little section entitled the gardener and he says and he gave these different rules and he said it was not so much about giving orders as it was creating an atmosphere for things to flourish and for people to be successful so the the atmosphere we create in our homes as fathers as husbands i'm pointing to us first as ministers we need to start to create an atmosphere for god to work among his people not for us to bark out orders and you know follow me and and that works i believe in that i believe in leadership of the holy ghost but i believe that we're seeing a time where it's not just you know the transition between moses and joshua is amazing to me because moses we've all seen the ten commandments and everybody looks and hears moses flowing hair and standing at the red sea and lifting his hands and and the red sea parting and you know and later on israel had so been accustomed to watching that and then they watched that and yet after they were fighting a battle and moses couldn't lift up his hands and israel started to lose the battle so her and and and aaron went up and they held his hands and when he held his hands so their faith was in the vessel god used but when they crossed over jordan it was now it was a different focus and joshua said you've not gone this way before and they began to cross the jordan so now crossing the red sea well it was moses lifting us now it was a different focus what was it an ark went before and there was the levites carrying the word it wasn't the levites pointing to themselves it was the levites drawing attention to the word and that's what our obligation is the word goes before us and in fact he told him he says now he says when the ark is here you stand so many so much distance back so that everybody can see the word and when you see the word that's where you'll draw your strength from now that's where you're gonna get your inspiration from the word is gonna go before you now the same god of moses now drops down into a level where nobody can see it the same way and as he drops down to that level as soon as the priest put their the levites put their foot in the water the water started to recede was it the priests that did that or was it the word that they were carrying that did that you know it's it's sometimes we if we're not careful we have an inferiority complex or we think more of ourselves than we ought oh you know and and if we if we ever lose sight that it's god in us we're lost [Music] you know we got to remember the ministry we're under is the son of man ministry and if we ever separate from that we're lost you know you can take the little story of the donkey that was carrying jesus he'd never been ridden on before and jesus sat on him and he became tame and humble that's not characteristic of a donkey but there was a presence there was something that went with him and as jesus rode that donkey and that donkey's now jesus is riding on him and the donkey is is looking and and there's leaves coming and hosannas and the donkeys think wow this is i'm really something you know wow they're all they're all cheering me no they were cheering the word that he was carrying and if we're not careful we take that so here's the donkey and you know man i'm the donkey i'm the one you know and and you know jesus gets off and the donkey's led into a stable you separate the the what's carrying the gift from the son of man it's just another donkey and a stable you take your ministry you might think i got a great ministry and you think oh look at everybody can rally around me i can do this and this and the minute you separate from the son of man you're lost you're you're another preacher that's just there everybody can look at you you're aimless you're walking around we have got an authority we have got a a word from heaven we've got a life that we're caring and god is seeing to that he's going to bring every word to pass i i believe that with all my heart so he said what must we do we must be about the father's business he said this is in seed is not air the wheat would cry back the grain what must it do vindicate malachi 4. vindicate luke 17 30. hebrews 13 8 john 14 12 revelations 10 the opening of the seals all of these mysteries and things that's the father's business for the hour now as i said you can easily make that a disconnect you think i can't explain it to anybody no you can't but i just believe it and then i i i i always tell our people i said if somebody asks you it's not your business to have to explain it just just tell them i think the greatest witness you can have as brother branham would say what jeffersonville needs is lived voices and he says more than trying to preach a sermon live a sermon and he says so all you need to do is just live that life and when somebody asks you say listen i can't explain it all to you but this is what i believe and and and and i i'll just point you to our pastor i pointed to the message i'll do whatever you know and if you can share it fine share it do whatever you can but we need to remember it's not in ourselves it's god who is in us we have this treasure in earthen vessels now i'm gonna just just keep going here and brother branham would say now remember he was the eleazar he was the forerunner and just like john was the forerunner i'll i'll go just a step further in my notes here for a minute but brother branham would would say and uh and and he as as the lease are he would say in present stage of my ministry now he's in 1962 in in september i got i got to save some of this because i got to come to something but brother branham says this was his hope i hope he'll let me crown my ministry of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the cloth of the word i hope he'll crown me and let me say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world now he preaches he's in another message and he's he's just talking about presenting something to god and this is in in the message hear ye him he says father he's praying make our lives so sweet and so full of the spirit so gentle and so kind and sweet that the whole world would long and see jesus oh let it be written with that if our character hasn't been just right forgive us lord and now he says now i present them to you they are the fruits of this message and now you are giving them we are you you are giving them to jesus as love gifts and they are love gifts from the father to the son no man can pluck them from your hand god may they live sweet humble lives may they be filled with the spirit and become your servants may i never see them or sh if i never see them or shake their hands may i do it in another land where we sit at the great wedding supper you you talk about a desire that a and a burden of of a prophet you know i'll i'll i'll just try and save this a little bit as we we go on here you know we're so we the devil can put us under pressure and say if you be a daughter of god if you be a son of god then do such and such and and we if we're not careful we start to listen to that and we and it starts to pull us into different places and different channels it was i think our my wife was expecting with our daughter so this would have been some time back we went to um prince edward island and it's the land of girls with red hair and so we thought it would be fitting that we should go there and i did see that somewhere on the travel list here you have a redhead cove somewhere so i was hoping we could see that for her sake but uh any rate we went there and some believers had referred us to some people they knew that had they'd witnessed to in the message and they were holiness people and so we didn't know believers on the island we were there for five days and and when we went there we we met them and they said well they're having a church service on sunday so we came up to the church service it was probably about half an hour before and there was not a car in the parking lot and so we drove around and we got a coffee went around and got a coffee and then we came back and it was like it was full at 15 too and i go wow okay we better step in and we walked in and the church was full and you know and and and uh and i i noticed like the the sisters all had long dresses and they had long hair and and and and you know they at about a certain time they started praying they all knelt down and started calling on god and i i truthfully i felt backslid and and i thought my these people got something you know and and i'm i'm there and i'm i'm looking at it and i did notice that all the sisters even though they had long hair they had these little hats on too and uh so we we went to the service and it was a good service it spoke to me i think god can speak to you in any service if you had a seed of god in you and we went out for lunch with them after and they welcomed us as visitors and and this was a visiting minister they had in and he was there and that evening he was really talking about getting the holy ghost and and i noticed something now because as we came in in the evening service and we sat down and everybody was kind of talking to each other and and such in fact i i had started praying like they were in the morning i was there a little earlier and somebody tapped me on the soldier i was bringing are you new here i said yeah i'm new here yeah i'm just talking to the lord and and and i realized and it was like a 10-2 and like a switch went off they went from talking amongst each other and they dropped on their knees and started praying and i thought this is just a form it's not genuine it's not and then i realized in the evening this was a upc movement and then at the evening the end of the service there was a young man and they were trying to make sure he got the holy ghost and there was a group of men around him trying to make him speak in tongues for all that it's worth and i i and there was like it was pressure pressure pressure listen friends that's not of god that's not as as much as they're trying and they see it it that's not how god manifests himself and we can do the same thing in the message of the hour i was very grateful i had just listened to the message questions and answers on the holy ghost as i'd come on the plane that way and it just struck me how pertinent this is and and and they just said well how do you know if you don't have the holy ghost and i said well brother i didn't say brother branham i said but the bible says it says that john had the holy ghost from his mother's womb and and they go well that was just one of a kind and and i i'm so grateful for this truth it's friends it's a liberty it's a freedom it's not bondage it is not a bondage amen so so we believe that and and we want to build everybody up and we want to do this now i want to just quickly go back i was reading these quotes back to matthew 11. this is where john had been talking about uh whether he saw jesus or not and at the end of this chapter jesus the lord speaks and he says this in matthew chapter 11 verse 28 he says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me now he doesn't say now listen to the doctrine make sure you get my tapes no he says take my yoke learn of me i am meek and lowly in heart now this is an approach that we need to it's a hard thing to come down to and he says i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and he says at that time jesus went i won't read i won't read chapter 12 but if i just take that i i remember reading this years ago and i remember i came back to the lord and i came in the message um you know when i was after a few years in the world and god really did at work and i'm so thankful for it and and and i came in and now all of a sudden i find out there's this is the truth this is the message now there's a church here and there's a church here and there's a church there and i i honestly couldn't tell you the difference in doctrine at that time i i wasn't at that place but what i did learn is that there's a spirit that follows things and i and there was a group of and i watched the young people and i just just watching and i still watch i always watch and and as i watch and i noticed there was fellowship between different churches and young people but this one church there was zero fellowship it was like a hard wall it was cut off i'm not going to mention names but it made me recognize there's a different spirit following that and it and then i also realized it sometimes you can present the truth but you can present it harshly or wrongly or you can present it in a way that isn't conducive to life i i just gave the example you can be the father and the head of a home in german and all these things and in irish or whatever you want to be but you know you can do that and you can make your home a military camp i'll tell you what that may hold the children for a while begrudgingly but when they get old enough to say i don't want that jesus we need to present christ with what we do we need to we need to be the gardener in our home we need to create the atmosphere we need to be able to do these things and present it brother bannon would would say this in the message desperations right after he preached the token he said friends we're living in the last days when the seven seals have been opened and make the whole thing known in one great big body of the bride uh until this church is perfected by the bride group in this last days and then we'll all together be taken up and then he just stops if you listen on a tape he says it's like the token jesus christ the holy spirit is among us we should reverence that we can't humble ourselves enough taking off your shoes it wouldn't expel it it says it wouldn't satisfy it but a life that brings forth the fruit of the spirit okay now i i i bring all of this and i set this groundwork i'm going to just go into a little bit of a channel here on on something and i'm going to just start to bring in something on the seals and i'm going to bring this in this way now brother branham preaches ten messages in what we call the seals seven seals he starts with a message called god in simplicity and and it's and i i don't know if you're like me but i when i opened the seals book and said okay i've heard that i i just i would i would okay let me get to the meat of the matter what seal one what's seal two you know and and we we bypass that but if we do that we actually miss the approach to god and and he he actually if you listen to brother he he speaks it and he comes all the way to the end of the seventh seal and he says now now i see what god was doing he says and and he's he's connecting something that started god in simplicity was ordained to go into the seals i had a brother he didn't understand it he'd read the church age book he he really probably never caught the revelation the message and he says i read the church age book i catch it and intellectually you can pick it all up i read the seals and he says i read all the seals and brother madam explains he didn't explain the seventh what is the seven seal mystery you know that would be a platform for me to step up and say well let me tell you no i didn't say that i said only god can reveal that and make that real to you and i said and i said go back and that's why i always encourage people listen to the voice listen to the tapes take time and immerse yourself don't just pick a quote here and there just go into there's so many nuggets in there brother branham will the bride have a ministry before the rapture he says and he's almost with the bride of a ministry oh and he's almost like surprised at the question oh of course it consists of prophets and and and pastors and apostles and and evangelists and teachers he says it's going on right now and he says it'll be so humble oh friends what is a true minister does he point to your himself or does he point to christ we need to be like john was he says i must decrease he must increase i i i don't want to just see him in in my study and in my notes i want to see him in the people i want to see him in my kids i want to see him in the church i want to see a manifest in a greater way it's not enough for a husband to say i got it you know there's no let it be that it just permeates and into our relationships into our workplaces friends the little story i told you about my wife going to houston meeting this guy these things they could be in all our lives i i i have a job i work at i have a business i run i i have a minister at a young i have a man who was a baptist um another gal who was a pentecostal worked for me and and they they noticed they said we know that you're busy on the weekends and they said and and he came to me and it's daryl he came to me one day and he says you know his dad was a baptist minister he says and and he says i don't serve god the way i should he's quite often golfing on a on a saturday or sunday but he he would say maybe i can do something to help you he says why don't you just take mondays off or monday mornings off or whatever you want i'll cover it i'll make sure i got you covered but in doing that maybe i can help the kingdom of god i said god may he honor them for that i had the lady the gal that worked for us at the time she and and it was at a time that we probably really needed her and and she had an offer to go back to a government job that was going to pay her up to ten dollars more an hour and she just said listen i need to let you know i've got this offer coming and and um she was at pentecostal gallon she she she says and i said okay well you know i understand and so i'm praying about it and so i'll pray about it too and after about 10 days she comes back to me says you know i feel it's the will of the lord for me to stay here i say god bless her for that you know i have people that i meet and i i don't know about you but i think there's a tribulation coming not everybody will be part of the message i don't want to see them go through anything and i say god and and if we really think about it they might not understand what you and i believe in doctrine but i believe there'll be something they'll have seen in our lives and how why do you say that brother eddis because there'll be those that are called foolish virgins that will give their lives in the tribulation they might so i met someone i knew someone they're not here anymore this is the time we're in the you know there's no end for the earth anymore they had something i'm going to give my life for something i i believe that that god is he's a god not of just a box called the message but it permeates it layers down and goes to people around us in the lives i you know i love it when i i told you about going shopping on holidays my wife i you know i i just sometimes love it because i i you know i'll let her take the cart and she'll walk ahead of me and and people are looking she's wearing a dress she's dressed she's got this aura about her she's and i'm kind of standing back and watching people ah that's my wife and i said and it's it's a great thing there's a brother years ago he was telling me the two brothers was two couples husband and wife husband and wife and they were traveling they were going along a road trip in the united states and they came to a lookout point and they're at a lookout point and the two husbands got out and they're just taking a picture and they're talking they happen to meet a a couple an older couple there and they're talking to the older couple and as they're talking to him he said they're at this lookout and they got to that they were christians and that they believed the message of william branham and these two men said hey we were in william branham's meetings and he said really he says yeah with such and such he says well did you know that there's actually tapes and i meant no we didn't know anything about that but we were in the meetings and said well let me tell you like it wasn't just that that was the message that was the shout you know there's more there's tapes there's there's churches all around it came with god's word to the hour and they're trying to explain these men are looking there and and he says you know he looked at these men they're older men their wives are short hairs they're wearing pants and things and they're trying to say no this is the life of god this is it you know by this time they've been talking a considerable time sometimes sometimes it's sometimes it's the sisters that talk longer than the brothers but there are times brother brother brother daniel he told me he says because his wife was just fellowshipping with people i said oh there's going to be invalids tonight this is why oh she's talking their arms and legs off again and but you know he just he you know these brothers were there and so their wives kind of came up behind them and beside them and and now everything that they had just shared here's this woman stands up beside and the men are looking this is a display of the message oh friends it's it's glorious it's beautiful and we need to treasure it and we need to we need to invest into it we need to give our time to it and into our children i remember our son caleb he's he had difficulty in school my daughter was an academic but caleb was was like he was a struggle it was difficult he had to leave sort of this christian based area that we were in to go to a specialty school specialty learning and and it was just it was a burden and we prayed and we labored for him and and we we had to tell the teacher because they had halloween they had all these things and you know he's not going to participate in things so anyway one day he had a substitute teacher he's about eight years old he had a substitute teacher and they're going to go to a rally in the in the gym and in the gym they're going to play this we will rock you song or something and and everybody's going to dance around the whole gym and and he comes up to the teacher he says i can't go there to the substitute teacher i can't go there no just go anyway he says no my mom would not want me to do this i'll just go anyway he says you don't know my mom [Laughter] caleb was so expressive it was it was a joy he he said many things that stuck with us you know oh man you don't know my mom you know what i think these things are real i think if we invest in them i i you just just think about this there's a little girl who grew up in the time of elijah little girl she she's she's in a home she's you know just a little maid and syrian bands came and they took her captive and she ended up in the home of naaman and she's in the home of naaman and she's there and this her name is a leper and one day she's away from everything she's away from her home she's away from her family but but somehow she was taught right she grew up in an atmosphere there was something in it now she didn't know all the things but she knew that all things are possible god can do everything and she grew up in this atmosphere and as she grew up in this atmosphere she sees the mistress crying and there's a mistress is crying she just says what's the matter says my husband's a leper oh and never had a leper been cleansed in israel yet but out of a little girl growing up in the right atmosphere with uh with and i'd say this with a father and a mother as a gardener and creating an atmosphere and doing things this woman this little girl under inspiration oh if he could only go back to israel we've got elijah the prophet did that come from i'll tell you what it's because there was something created and out of that you don't know how it'll manifest i say this invest in it do everything you can plug into it plug into one another encourage one another help your children it'll be wonderful i believe we'll see more of god my my my okay i want to get into this with the seals now brother branham takes god in simplicity i don't know you're all pulling me into different directions here maybe i'm doing that myself but whatever now brother branham hears questions and answers the seals he's preached to six seals now he's coming up to the sunday morning and then that night is the seventh seal and he says now take my advice brother don't put your own interpretation to nothing go and live a good christian life you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it you'll wind away again from the thing now you're all conscious there's there's something happening it's happening and i know what it is now i'm not saying it it's the grace of god that lets me know it it's something tremendous it's going on right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it and he says but so help me with this bible in my hand i know what it is now he says this again i'll i'll tell you uh you you fast forward uh it's one of the messages in 65 but brother or maybe 63. brother adam talks about that that cap that he comes up to and with the crowbar he ripped off the thing and there was and it says light has never shone on this before and he tells the brother now you just stay and you look on this don't go anywhere else he says and i slipped away and he says and i watched them a few stayed but others went this way others went that way others went that way keep your eyes on the real thing don't go into your own things brother i'm saying don't put your own interpretation so he says now we're living in a time where just be real humble be a christian try to live god live honest with your fellow man love those who don't love you he says don't try to make any dot dot dot you see when you do it only makes a mysterious something and you mess up the real program of god oh you don't have to figure it all out this is i'm here lord let your word be born in my heart he said yesterday afternoon something happened in my room i'll never be able to leave it now church you're not supposed to know these things now that doesn't mean forever he says he says it'll happen but he says in one place he says it'll be a little more in season so as as we just said on on friday nights when you're walking in the unfolding you're not looking at something but now you're looking with real time you're seeing it all around you not just the anointing on your first eyesight but now it's going into your understanding and your reality of everything now as you walk in it and you say oh that's what this is that's what this is why because it's it's in a secret place it's not a public show it's to the individual so brother branham will go on and he'll he'll just say this every time you do that he said let your testimony be in love with the people because if you don't you're going to twist yourself out into something don't try to make no interpretation and when that seal comes up in front of you don't try to interpret just live humble go right on with the message and i already shared the quote about you know is will their bride have a ministry they ask a question should evangelists continue in the field they ask him other questions because in the mind of people their expectation it's the end and and we we can't do it and brother branham he tries to work through it and people quitting their jobs and and just selling their houses and not going on and he's trying to tell them no no no no just go on and he says should evangelists continue in the field in this hour of course you should if jesus comes in the morning preach today like it's going to be 10 years don't get scrupled up i'm trying to warn you don't be honor peculiar don't change nothing continue in there if you're building a house put it up if jesus comes tomorrow i'd rather be faithful at my duty continue on there's more of this i can read if you're planting wheat plant your wheat if you're digging potatoes go on and dig a mountain well nobody'll eat them that doesn't make a difference then he says somebody told him sell the farm should i and what do we do and he says don't do that he says let your children have the farmer they can eat off and do all these things i'll put my crop in today i'll be a farmer be a mechanic be whatever he made you and then a fellow came to him he says here you can have these keys a man told his pastor i bought a new car i'm not going to ge i'm going to give you the second keys what are you giving them to me for well if the rapture comes i won't be needing them you can have them there's a lot of faith there but you're a pastor right it says we mustn't be that way the pastor is going to miss it we mustn't be that way my my my okay i i gotta just take this a little further let's go back to genesis chapter 1 verse 26 are you good yet well i don't know what know what the time is and you know how bad my watch is i've already shared that a couple of times so genesis chapter 1 now in here brother branham would say verse i i you could read verse 26 27 god created but in verse 28 and chapter one god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and be and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing so this is the command now it's given to adam in theophany form and it's when it was adam and eve together but now in in and you you realize all of genesis chapter 1 that was spoken but genesis 2 now that was six days in genesis 1. genesis 2 was the seventh day and and god was resting there was nothing happening it was quiet now if you take the perspective of the angels they heard all these things if you take the perspective of lucifer who's watching all of this you know and and brother branham in christ the mystery of god revealed he says about the seventh seal he said don't try and figure it out he says but it's revealed in every type in the bible and he says and and i say who is the central theme of the bible it's christ so he says now take it back to genesis 1. here god speaks he's done speaking now the earth itself being a womb and the womb had to receive that word and because god said let it bring forth it always says let the earth bring forth and let it do this now under the seventh day under a day of rest now we see these are the generations and all of a sudden something started growing and i imagine the devil was looking how did that happen and then something else started growing how did that happen because it was god unseen unknown hidden and it wasn't seen and so you know the devil could look at it the same way denominations look at the message and say how did this message get into every country and everything because it's god it's not a program it's god who's in it the same god of genesis is the same god here how did god come into my life when i was a renegade didn't want it it was god that was working how does he come into our families and change them it's god that's doing it and and so it's all happening that way so here here all of this is happening now now think of i'll try and condense my thoughts here think of the earth as a womb and the seed had to be planted in it now let's go just a step further god god talks about um jesus had to be made manifest he was that real germ of life the real seed but in order for him to be manifest he had to have a womb and it was it was taken by someone had a receiving set i i don't know what went on with mary mary a young girl many young girls had tried to think i'll be the virgin that conceives but mary maybe heard that in the service one time and her heart was warmed so she had to be able to receive to open her mind to that to believe that and that's the way we need to be just to have a welcome and receiving spirit to the things of god in the prayer line brother mama says oh my you've got a welcome spirit around you you know god can work with that kind of a spirit that's an atmosphere that we create in our in our being and around us so he would i'm going to go ahead now he reads in spoken word is the original seed eve would have brought forth the child now it doesn't say adam would have he says eve eve was the womb that was there but satan he was attacking the womb and he said and he got her to disbelieve she would have finally done it and then brother evan says did not god tell her multiply and replenish the earth now the command was given to adam but the manifestation was through eve now i want you to look at this because the earth is a womb but the woman the church is also a womb to reproduce christ again paul would tell the church he would say to the women naturally speaking you will be saved in child bearing now that is that is a part of what the woman is here for that's not the only thing but he says that's a part of what she's here for but he's also talking to the church spiritual when you're bringing forth children when the life of god is flowing through your church that's when the church is prospering the life of god is going on in the church so so now brother ram says now about eve he says what happened before adam got to her she was already a mother and and he says she she hybrid god's word so the devil came in he injected himself but he says it was to have come through eve now eve didn't think she was wrong eve thought she was right and he says it happened to eve's children it happens in this last day so what we need to have is a receiving set that allows the word to be able to have a betting ground to work in go with me just for a moment to genesis 9 you're in if you're still in genesis 1 genesis 9 this is just after the flood and and in genesis 9 now the flood noah comes out of the flood and there's a rainbow and god says this is my covenant and and then the sons of noah came forth from the ark shem ham japeth ham was the father of canaan which was the serpents he'd crept through the middle of that but in verse 20 it says this and i i've always kind of just marveled at this a little bit and noah began to be a husbandman and he planted a vineyard so in other words noah couldn't make things grow but like adam was given the original con the original commission you know he says you are here to dress and keep it keep it in the right channel keep it in the right place and it says now you can you can tie this right back to cain and abel if you actually look in in genesis 4 here's cain and abel they're immediately identified by their occupations what their passion was one was a tiller of the ground that was cane and the other was a keeper of the sheep now you think well tilling the ground that's a good thing but if you actually look what kane did with the ground he brought out minerals he brought out things to build cities with he did all those things it was a different inspiration but but what he lived by became the seeds of civilization if you look at at at uh abel he he just worked with the sheep he was humble he was simple this is where now god is under the first stage of redeeming the earth here comes noah out and the first thing is he's a husband man he's he's one who's whose basis is not to try to recreate but just to work with the economy of god replenish the earth and and and noah began to work with that and do those things i'm moving quickly now i'm going to take a few examples first kings chapter 17. i'm i'm using that as a stage now i'm going a little further first kings 17 this is where in the time of elijah there was elijah the prophet he was a great man he comes and stomps in verse 1 before the king says there'll be no dew or rain according to my word he goes up into the brook cherish and as a cherith and as he's there the ravens brought food and flesh and after a while the brook dried up and there was no rain in the land partly because of his own prophecy but how was god going to sustain him next verse and the word of the lord came to now go down to zarapath which belongs in zidane and dwell there i have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee now a woman is a type of the receiving and she was a widow woman she was dead to her first husband but she was and i'm not saying to bring this into a natural relationship but it's a type of we who may have been out in a relationship in a church world or something but we're dead to that and and we're the woman where the receiving set and so he's given that command he goes down he meets this woman gathering sticks and he tells her to get him water and a vessel that he may drink and and he says and and he tells her to give it to her and and and she says i uh in verse 11 and she was going to fetch it so she started moving old friends that's so important when when the bible says when moses saw the pillar of fire he reverenced it and he took off his shoes and when god saw that he stopped then god visited him there was a prayer line the other day i was listening to him brother madam says he says oh there's a sister oh it's passed over you in the audience and then he goes oh you're looking for it he's come to you he comes to those that are ready to receive him ready to desire him so so it's it's about creating that atmosphere so here this woman she had something in her she's going to fetch it he says bring me i pray the a morsel of bread and verse 12 and she said as the lord god lives i don't have a cake i don't have a handful of meal i'm gathering two sticks but she was going she was already moving and as she was moving now in verse 13 elijah says fear not go and do as thou hast said make me a little cake bring it unto me after that make for me and for thy son and then and then he's saying that thus saith the lord the barrel of meal shall not waste neither the crews of oil fail until the day the lord sends rain on the earth now this was happening in secret she had a barrel of meal in her house she had this you know we we have a church it's right in the middle of a residential area and our neighbors look you know these people they gather on sunday morning they gather on sunday night they gather on wednesday they they they seem to be always you know going about their they've got this membership is good and it's this and in the time of pandemic they went and they did this and what's going on in there it's the same thing that was going on here spiritually speaking there was always food there was always something sustaining so it was happening and and so that that barrel of meal now look at she created a place and whatever happened thereafter because after that her son passed away and she cried unto god and and she calls on elijah have you brought my sins to my remembrance i've sold out to this and and under selling it out every need was taken care of and so it was this now i'm going to just jump ahead a little bit and i want to just say this elijah and elisha is a type so there's four miracles in elijah there was eight miracles under elisha but what elijah did was almost on a more national scale it was speaking to the king it was it was calling down fire was doing different things but now under elisha it goes to another level and if you actually look at an elisha the first thing that happens i think was was that there was this an army was coming and elijah he had to say something before he could say anything he had to create an atmosphere he said bring me a minstrel i i i got to get in the spirit i got to get in the move and then he prophesied but now look at all the things that happened it was on a common level it was a worker who lost his acts and elisha under the word of elisha he made that axe head to float that god is still our god today it may not be on the level of brother branham but it's come down to our level he's interested in your job and your schooling he's interested in all of these things that's the god that's moving with us and among us and there was different things there was the pot the meal the meal was this and that and and and it was at a level that was an everyday level and i could read more of it and you you'd all know in second kings and you could read in second kings chapter two and it was about the shunamite woman you know it was just so simple she was an old woman she never asked for anything but she felt for the prophet and she created a room said let's build a little room for him a place where we can put a bed let's create an atmosphere let's just be a gardener for the word of god let's create something where god's prophet can be sustained and be helped and and friends the message we have would be nothing if there wasn't somebody to receive it it wouldn't be anything if there wasn't a receiving set thank god that he sent the receiving said he placed something in us now you've got to culture it you've got to nurture it and this woman did that and so and it so came to pass and time he said to go he's like she's done so much good for us what is she lacking she's old and she doesn't have a child and he began to immediately speak and life came forth now look at how this condescends and brings to a level we you can read a further part of this story in in second kings eight where this elijah told that woman to go away for seven years there's going to be a famine in the land at the end of the seven years she comes back right at the time that they're talking about elijah and this woman and the great things he did and then the king empowers a messenger she says restore that woman all she lost restore everything to her and then he says and give her back that and give her everything her lands and all that she lost in that time this is types that pertain to us i'm going through it quickly but i i just trust you catch where we're going one more second kings four let's just turn to this one second kings four this is the cried a certain woman verse 1 of the wives of the sons of the prophets and again it's a woman it's a betting ground my husband is dead now in this case her husband was a servant of god under elijah and he says you know elijah elisha you know that my servant feared the lord now the creditors have come to take unto him my two sons to be a bond bond men and elijah said unto her what shall i do for you and then he asks this question what is in your house now this this comes right down to the level not about what happened when brother branham was in the meetings or in portland or or what happens at church but it comes right to our house and there's a need and he says he says i have nothing except this pot of oil and now he says go borrow the vessels not a few vessels all empty vessels don't borrow a few but when you get them all come in and now he says shut the door it's just you in the house i'm not going to come god's already with you and under that atmosphere as she began to pour according to the word it multiplied it multiplied it multiplied friends our expectation i don't know how god does these things friends we we our kids they've gone through struggles but i'm thankful for where they're at and where god's taking them and i think that it's possible that we can we can bring them up and we can claim them and we can have them and that is the greatest thing that we can have and she did that i i already read i told you about the story of naaman you know you could even you could go to others and and that are there other incidents and and different things under this time but it's god that's working in the midst of them now let me go just just give me about another 15 minutes here and then we'll we'll just try to wind this up isaiah 40 had this is going back to what i read in in in the earlier in the thing but isaiah had 40 had one of the greatest prophecies about a messenger and it would talk about the voice of him crying in the wilderness make straight in the desert a highway for our lord and the terminology he uses is amazing every valley shall be exalted chapter 40 verse 4 now and he says and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain now it was simple or it seemed like it was so put a picture in the minds of the people and and there's other prophecies but the leaders the religious leaders in israel at the time of jesus they weren't looking for one that was meek and lowly they were looking for a general and and even john the baptist you know his work was so important let me just slow down just for a minute just can you you're with me still i don't want to wear you and i know there's a meal planned and i i promise i won't interfere with that brother branham and i i want you just to think about this john's work was so important god would not let him stay among the mainstream he had to pull him aside into the desert and when he came out he used language like vipers and snakes and things but he was completely sold out to god brother branham comes and you know his story his life story is amazing but he comes out and he met this dr davis and he had the visions and he says oh that's of the devil and and you know he tried to get away from it but but god kept leading him and then you know it was it was when he had um along the way he went to that meeting at mishawaka and uh you know there was on a level he'd never experienced before and and he saw the things happening and he came back and he told his wife we're going to go up there those people want us and his mother-in-law told him and said you're not bringing my daughter to that trash and brother branham said okay i won't that was a hard hard lesson how does god form us how did god form the prophet now i want you just to think about this god had to bring the word that from the book of genesis there was parts of it that were held sealed daniel would refer to it seal up those things john on the isle of patmos seal up those things that were uttered but now god's got to prepare a vessel on earth to proclaim that but look how pure the betting ground had to be and god had to create this so the first thing so brother branham did that and he lost his wife and she knew why and bill brother brother branham knew why and then he lost his daughter and that was a hard hard lesson that was family now he's out with ministers they're going to africa and he had a vision that said go to india first and he's telling the brothers brother bosworth one of his greatest friends and brother brothers just said brother branham you could be wrong i heard one time where a vision adam had a vision and something and he says and brother madam was couldn't believe it and he spoke to god he says you can go but you're going to pay for it and he was was not falling and he took an amoeba as he called it and he was deathly ill for months and months and months and after that it came out and now you know you look at the purging the purging that was going the purging the purging now we're coming down to 1962 brother branham has a vision of a brown bear and as he has the vision of this bear he's out with a number of men hunting i think was brother bud southwick and brother branham were the older brothers and then there was a number of younger brothers brother billy paul brother biscuit brother bud's son a few others and and some of this you'll see in tape some of it you can hear through by the biscuit's testimony but as he goes into that he has this vision of a mammoth brown bear and they're there and that night before they're at the campfire and the old men the the young men are just sort of kidding the old men you know you couldn't do you couldn't hit you know with your gun this and this and they're making fun of brother bud and brother branham now just just a human being feeling sorry for brother bud the next day he goes hunting with brother bud contrary to the vision and the other brothers the young brothers they talk about it brother biscuit shares in his testimony they're hunting and then they saw this huge brown bear come down and then he just caught a whiff of them and he went back up and he took off and then the next day it started to rain and for four days it rained rained rained they couldn't hunt anymore at the end of those days they're packing up to go out and brother brother branham tells brother biscuit he says i how long before we go it's probably another three hours he said i just got to go up and he went up to seek the lord and he comes back and he says all of this rain is because of me i was disobedient he says but it's over and god said we'll ride out dry. and brother biscuit says right out dry are you kidding we've been soaked and he says he was sitting there on his horse and just a little break a blue sky and a little waft of air comes through and it comes and also it just does all of this and he's and they're riding out in sunshine now i say all of this because you can go back in september of 1962 and you listen to some of the prayer lines and brother branham is confessing his sin in prayer and he's saying lord forgive me the other day there on the mountain and he's talking about to make a vision pass you have to be in the right place and he says and i missed it and he says forgive me lord i felt sorry for that old man and he says and i didn't want to have him hurt but i didn't realize i was hurting you you can hear it on a tape in a prayer line and i thought the molding and the school that that man had to go through now this is 1962 and he refers to it in a couple of messages but i almost view it as the last bit of humanity that was of brother branham that could have been gotten in god's plan and after this it wasn't now no more family it wasn't no more ministers it wasn't even human compassion anymore now it says lord whatever you want exactly prepared to deliver the seven seals which he said i would have done the wrong thing he says something came in the room now this was so sovereignly god it was not william branham it was not his thoughts but this was a vessel prepared that was going to give it to give out this word now i'm using this none of us are a prophet but neither do we see sometimes our humanity gets in the way we allow things to come we need to create an atmosphere you know if we're always proud i don't make mistakes i don't do this he that humbles himself he that makes himself little that makes him nothing this was the womb god was going to use for for the bringing forth of the word what about the womb for the manifestation of the word how we need to not just say oh that's just so and so no we need to reverence we need to create an atmosphere where our children learn to respect not not just the the prophet and the things we believe but even our homes our families our wives all of these things we want an atmosphere we're gardeners we're we're not we can't make it happen but we can create the atmosphere for god to come in and drop and do what he wants to do so here john yeah i won't read it all but you you can read in matthew chapter chapter 3 where he comes forward and and he identifies jesus and and then there's a further part of this in john chapter one and then he goes further and he he makes these words i must decrease he must increase and i i'll just be honest with you friends there was a time i was a young man as a minister and i thought oh man just to go on the mission field and i'll just do this it's adventure it's this and this i i would still have a heart for that but i i also would think oh it'd be wonderful just to go and preach and do these things i've kind of come to the place and said lord i don't want anything but what you want i i and i think if we're honest as ministers in fact lord if if i could just sort of hide in this room and you could take this i would rather that you would do this now that kind of an attitude i would say this if it's in the ministry i think that's wonderful i think it's even greater for those that are in any church and say lord wherever you take this service whatever you do i'm with you lord i'll move with you because you're in control and so what do we do when we come we've got to create an atmosphere we've got to create a place now you could say john was the forerunner in john chapter 3 he talks about being you know he talks about his desire and i'll maybe read this one if i can just just briefly in john chapter 3 and and this is in verse 27 john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven you yourselves bear me witness i am not the christ but i am him that sent before him now look at these words he that hath the bride is the bridegroom the friend of the bridegroom which stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice thereby my joy is fulfilled it wasn't when john's ministry was decreasing i'm my ministry's over i got to give it over no that was his whole purpose he wasn't just looking at him he wasn't he wasn't the donkey that was carrying the word and saying i'm the donkey look at me no he was saying this is the word look at him look at him look at him that was his joy our joy is when we can see that the life that's in us is not our own doing when it's his life when it's god working with our children sovereignly i think that ought to be the thing that we look for when it's god working in our homes we need an atmosphere the lease are of this day oh my let me let me read this one one one one part i read it early in present stage brother miss i hope he lets me crown me he said there's going to be a bride look at brother branham's desire and and he said he's going to have a bride she's going to be without spot and wrinkle and they're going to appear before him that way he says and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready the word that we're clothed in that's how we get ready and he says oh lord if you can take this evil spirit for me i'll serve you that's up to you but you've got something to do too the bride has made herself ready oh god cannot push us through a pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcomes you got nothing overcome you he pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself brother branham would say do you want the word to have the preeminence in your myth or do you want to see a deity in your midst he says then welcome and receive the word that's what will bring forth that thing you know i i look at paul even paul i'm just slowly winding my thoughts down here paul would say in second corinthians 10 you know he's he's talking just just about himself and his own ministry paul he had to leave everything and and do that and he he's he's chastening the corinthians in verse 7 he says do you look on things on the outward appearance if any man trust himself that he's christ let him think this again that he is christ even as we are christ now drop down to verse 10 and they say paul says for his letters now his own letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is contemptible god allowed it to be that paul's greatest ministry was going to be from a prison was going to be from his epistles because even paul's appearance would would bring they'd say what's with him i remember brother tim pruitt telling me one time he said he was called somewhere to minister a man had only heard this is before the days of internet had only heard of brother tim pruitt and heard tapes of him and did different things and and he he came and he says brother tim i want to invite you for meetings okay sure i'll come you know when he comes and brother tim comes and this man is looking and and brother tim comes out you know just small little guy hobbling out like this and and and and he's got this sign and he says i'm tim pruitt and he says no you're not i've heard tim pruitt preach he's a big guy he's six foot four his powerful voices no i'm tim pruitt it's like a stumbling block you know and so if if we had brother branham here everybody would be acting like him but god saw dana we'd only have the voice so we could still see christ in our midst that's the thing we ought to look for brother branham would even talk about it he'd say about moody you know they moody was in england and he said he he was there he was a great and you know and the reporter went up and he just recently reported on another great animal evangelist and said this man is eloquent he's a doctor of divinity he's got the best best grammar that i've ever heard he holds the people in psychology that same reporter went up to see dwight moody says i don't see what there's anything in him that's attractive to anybody first thing is he's as ugly as can be he says the next thing is he's a physical wreck the next thing is he's got no education his grammar is the poorest i ever heard he's got a wine and a wheeze when he's preaching i don't see nothing in dwight moody that would attract the attention of anybody mr moody was brought the article he reads and he chuckles and he says certainly not they don't come to see me they come to see god he says that's the way we got to look at it it's not our outward appearance we gotta we gotta keep our focus on christ that's the one we want to look to paul would even talk in ii thessalonians let me as i slowly bring my thoughts down ii thessalonians chapter two and he's he's speaking here and he and he talks a little bit about his what he presented to the people and how he presented it so sorry first thessalonians chapter two and and he i don't know if i want to read all of this but he would he would say verse one you ourselves brother know our entrance into you was not unto you it was not in vain even after we had suffered before and were shamefully detreated we were bold to speak the gospel with much contention with much contention our exhortation was not of deceit or uncleanness and he says in verse 4 we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel so we speak not as pleasing men but god which tries our hearts neither at any time used we flattering words as you know or a coke of covetousness god is our witness nor sought we glory neither of you or yet of others that we might have been burdensome as apostles in verse seven this is paul he says but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children i think if we can recognize the spirit of christ he speaks to us he ministers to us he brings things to us paul sets an atmosphere for all of these things you know i think we can bring that right down to our homes and and we could we could read this in different places but paul would talk in ephesians chapter 6 in verse 4 and he says and you fathers now he is this is twice in the scriptures he makes this statement i think it's interesting he says provoke not your children to wrath you think well how would i provoke my children to wrath by just being a male alpha figure you think you know like you think well you know all men you know we're men we fix things we got this under control no we don't always got it under control you know i had to bring out the difference one time in the church between being a macho and being a man and macho is just a man who doesn't have no control over his spirit and it's just on on on running on testosterone only but here paul says you fathers provoke not your children to wrath what are you doing you're a gardener if we could if we could just change our mindset and say whatever my gift is in my home let me create an atmosphere if my gift is to sing let me create an atmosphere if it's to be a song leader if it's to be an amen or let me create an atmosphere let me create that atmosphere who knows what god will do and he says bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the lord he goes on to say in colossians chapter 3 you could read much of this but he also talks to the wives in verse 18 wives submit yourself to your own husbands as it is fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them you know i had to tell my wife you know you go through marriage and it's nice in the beginning it's honeymoon it's nice and there's some trials and i had to tell her i said you know a husband is somebody who sticks by you through all the troubles you wouldn't had if you stayed single remember that [Laughter] so she's also said to me you know i i've gone to a lot of places with you that i never would have gone myself so newfoundland is one of them so [Laughter] but he says husbands love your wives be not bitter against them children obey your parents what is all of this talking about an atmosphere a creating an atmosphere what's happening under the seventh seal we're just doing our regular things we're staying in the word we're not trying to be super spiritual we're just loving god we're obeying the message and out of that comes all kinds of things supernatural things that we don't even know how did that happen i don't know but god just did it that's how god does things and again he says in verse 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged you can take the word of god and use it as a hammer that's something us hammer meisters have had to watch and be careful don't just be a hammer meister be be a servant of god so so this is all part of it i'm gonna wind down with these thoughts you can go to the seals the sixth seal brother bannon would talk and he relates matthew 24 and he relates the the questions turn with me to matthew 24 just as we we conclude with this matthew 24. you know when when i said children obey your parents i didn't hear a lot of amens from the children some moms saying amen you know when when it said wives obey your husband's husband amen amen but i think we're hitting everybody here today okay is that right we're all submitting ourselves matthew 24 so they asked him these three questions about the coming of the lord and jesus in first verse 4 he answers them now you can go in the sixth seal and and brother branham will take these verses of jesus and relate them to all of the seals he'll relate you know chapters verses 4 and 5 to the first seal i think five and six if you're not careful he actually mixes the verses up in one thing but if you follow it through and look in your bible it actually all works and so it it goes and he relates it to under that writer come and see and and then they'll be you know a black horse rider and with this and this but now the time of the seventh seal there is something in the seventh seal there's it's omitted like there's silence in heaven there's nothing given but if you read matthew 24 you know because it actually talks about the parable of the fig tree and all of these things and then it goes into what emulates luke 17 30 how it says that the days of noah you know the flood will happen now if you read from verse 40 down to verse 51 and if you really take it and if you want to take it and say this is the conditions at the coming of the lord and it and it would just talk about everyday life it says here's two in the field one will be taken one left two women grinding one taken one left and then it says watch therefore you don't know the hour you don't know how this is going to turn out you don't know how it's going to happen but god's going to do it and we're going to be doing regular things so he's saying now some you know if the goodman of house would know be ready and it says in verse 45 be a faithful and wise servant you know and verse 46 blessed is that servant and you know he that's listening you know i'll make him a ruler over things verse 47 verse 48 but if he says the lord delays his coming and he begins in verse 49 to smite his fellow servants the lord will come in a day he's not looking for him so it sets the conditions so it's telling you conduct your lives in the right way you don't know when this is going to manifest you don't know when this is going to be fulfilled but i believe as we get closer he says you don't know the day or the hour i think we can see the season listen i'm i really am closing now and and and you look at all the things that are happening around us we've got roles to follow we've got different things i could take time some of these i would leave to the the pastors and and and those that labor in the church to take and i think you've had some of that there's there's many things we could talk about upbringings you know you look at in the bible brother brahm talks about david and he says david david he he how did he get david get where david got he says well his father jesse read him stories at night about the bible and things and that produced a david you know my mother god bless her she she didn't have an easy life but she i caused her much grief she said i was the furthest away but she prayed for all of us as kids and when she saw me turn god was gracious and and gave her a son that that's laboring for god and i say that because my pride would say no no you didn't you didn't do that well god called me i know that but i i had too much pride to say she was part of that but god gave that to her just as a desire listen how brother branham talks just as i use this in the in the church age book he talks about i know your works i know your labor revelations two verse two and he says how you've borne you've had patience for my name's sake and then he makes this commentary how beautifully the savior praises and commands his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows there's a weakness among them but he doesn't cry out against it isn't that just like the lord he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage us in the wrong matters and then he says we could learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families we could learn a good lesson in that god deals with each of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saint of god for god is not ungracious to forget your labors of love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone it has a reward and a blessing of god let's be good gardeners let's be husbandman i didn't get into timothy and how he says the husbandmen must be first partaker we need to live what we believe what we talk about let's have the musicians come and work we'll close you know christ is revealed in every type in the bible and if we can catch the bible and the attitude thereof uh i i believe it's it's there's things that we are designed to catch and see that others don't catch and see because we are part of him we are recipients we're part of what what he would want oh my i i i'm not sure which way we'll go we'll we'll sing do you know this i don't know if i got the words right jesus lamb of god um okay that's that's the one if we could sing that how many are happy to be a christian i'm i'm not what i ought to be i'm not but i believe he's working with me let's stand together let me sing this i'll whenever i don't know what the word is or the song number is but if i'll need help on this one for sure brother bob i'm sure you can [Music] you are my strength when i am weak you are the treasure that i see [Music] is [Music] you are [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] bless the lord

everything grow right amen he is the widow's oil in her room he's the one that was with the shunammite woman he's the one that was with the little girl in in a land he's the one that was the fourth man in the fire he's the one that was with the prophet he's the one that's with us now he's in every type it's him the seventh seal is christ that's him coming down that's him in our midst brother a brother from africa i just was thinking of it he'd shared shared this with me and it was such a blessing but he would just say you know if you look for him you'll see him in every book of the bible it says in genesis he's the promised seed of the woman in the exodus he is the i am in leviticus he's the high priest in numbers he's the cloud and the pillar of fire in deuteronomy he's a prophet like unto moses in joshua he's the captain of our salvation in judges he's a lawgiver in ruth he's the kinsman redeemer our boaz in samuel he's the trusted prophet in second samuel he's david the king in
