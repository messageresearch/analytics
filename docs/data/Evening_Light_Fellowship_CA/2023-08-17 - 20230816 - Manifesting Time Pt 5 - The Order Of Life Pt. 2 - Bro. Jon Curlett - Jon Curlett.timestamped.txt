[40:56] Lord that we found a shelter in a time
[40:59] of storm

[41:02] refuge you are our strength you are our
[41:04] Rock You are our Hiding Place Lord that

[41:21] your provision we're thankful Lord for
[41:24] promises for that which we have need of
[41:25] but haven't yet received Lord because
[41:27] we're looking to you the author and
[41:29] finisher of our faith so Lord we pray
[41:32] you once again Lord Minister by Your
[41:33] Word Lord that you would look into our
[41:35] lives and hearts Lord that you would
[41:37] Lord discern the very needs that we have
[41:39] Lord the very root of our problems Lord
[41:41] that you would secure us Lord by your
[41:43] word and your word alone or may we rest
[41:46] on that strong Foundation that Firm
[41:48] Foundation that can't be moved Lord and
[41:50] may we know it Lord that it's you that
[41:52] speaks Lord that it's you that's working
[41:53] in US Lord have your way now we pray in
[41:56] Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen
[41:59] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[42:01] Ezekiel 36 again Ezekiel 36.
[42:05] amen good to be in the house of the Lord
[42:07] tonight
[42:09] a few missing I see but
[42:11] and then trusting that we've gathered
[42:12] into to hear his word amen and trust him
[42:15] to come on the scene and
[42:17] reveal himself a little more to us amen
[42:19] certainly want to keep praying for
[42:21] brother Bob and sister Brenda I spoke to
[42:22] him yesterday and they're still quite
[42:24] weak so uh we certainly want to keep
[42:26] remembering them trusting that they'll
[42:28] be well and good certainly by the
[42:30] weekend and into next week Lord willing
[42:32] amen Ezekiel 36 and 25
[42:36] says then will I sprinkle clean water
[42:38] upon you and ye shall be clean from all
[42:40] your filthiness and from all your Idols
[42:42] will I cleanse you a new heart also will
[42:45] I give you and a new spirit will I put
[42:48] within you and I will take away the
[42:50] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[42:52] give you in heart of Flesh and I will
[42:54] put my spirit within you and cause you
[42:57] to walk in my statutes and you shall
[42:59] keep my judgments and do them and you
[43:02] shall dwell in the land that I gave to
[43:03] your fathers and you shall be my people
[43:05] and I will be your God Amen God bless
[43:08] you you can have your seats this evening
[43:10] and we're going to continue on that
[43:12] title that we had last time and we're
[43:13] speaking on our series on manifesting
[43:15] time and and for a thought tonight we
[43:18] want to continue with this idea of the
[43:20] order of life and last service we spoke
[43:22] about the process of giving birth and we
[43:24] showed how that a human birth starts
[43:26] with a conception and it concludes with
[43:28] a functioning body that's born and it's
[43:30] delivered out of the mother and it's all
[43:32] part of a birth process but we tend to
[43:34] focus on when the baby comes out right
[43:35] rather than when the baby is conceived
[43:38] at the beginning amen we don't
[43:39] commemorate the time of conception but
[43:41] we commemorate the time when it actually
[43:43] is manifested as what happened nine
[43:45] months previous to that amen life
[43:47] started at conception but it's not a
[43:49] living Soul Brother Branham taught us
[43:51] and the scripture teaches us until it
[43:52] comes out of the mother and the Breath
[43:54] of Life is put into it then we talked
[43:56] about the calling of God and how it was
[43:58] before we ever did right or wrong like
[44:00] the scripture says that God said Esau
[44:02] have a Jacob have I loved and Esau if I
[44:04] hate it it said neither one of them
[44:06] having done any evil it says that the
[44:08] election of God might stand amen that
[44:10] the election of God might stand and so
[44:12] we know that it's a total work of Grace
[44:14] and it's a calling of God and that that
[44:17] word called the actual word is invited
[44:19] but it reminds me that it's like an
[44:21] invitation like when our parents call us
[44:23] for supper
[44:24] because the first time it's a it's an
[44:27] invitation
[44:28] and if you come right away then it's an
[44:30] invitation but if you don't come then
[44:32] there's a compulsion there's a
[44:34] compelling hand that says you better get
[44:36] to the supper right now because I'm
[44:38] serving supper and I'm not going to
[44:39] serve it to nobody there's got to be
[44:41] somebody to eat it and we remember in
[44:43] the in the parable of the wedding supper
[44:45] and and he said he sent them out into
[44:47] the highways and the byways and the
[44:48] ditches and the hedges and and that's
[44:50] where he went and he grabbed us and he
[44:52] didn't grab us the first time the first
[44:53] time he says I'm inviting you but then
[44:55] if we don't come easy then he grabs onto
[44:57] us and he says you're going to come by
[44:59] hook or by crook because I've got to
[45:00] fill my wedding house I've got to have
[45:02] somebody to eat this supper and we know
[45:04] it's the predestination of God it's the
[45:06] calling of God it's not just
[45:07] happenstance or any of these things but
[45:09] rather it shows the work of Grace
[45:10] because the people that that actually
[45:12] come into the wedding supper are nothing
[45:14] like the ones that were first invited
[45:15] and then looking at them naturally
[45:17] looking at them in the way they're born
[45:19] and the way they live in and of
[45:20] themselves there's nothing worthy to go
[45:22] into the wedding supper and yet he says
[45:23] I've got a place prepared I've got a
[45:25] meal prepared I've got garments prepared
[45:27] I've got Transportation prepared I have
[45:29] everything prepared for you to get all
[45:30] the way through you just have to say
[45:32] I'll take it now brother Bob had shared
[45:34] this quote with me earlier this week and
[45:36] in talking about the grace it says now
[45:38] remember that it was his grace and his
[45:41] mercy and that alone that gives you the
[45:44] only hope that you have he says no
[45:47] matter what you would ever do past
[45:50] present or future there is nothing
[45:52] nowhere that can anyways come near hear
[45:55] what Christ did for you amen we look at
[45:59] what he did and we look at the price
[46:00] that he paid even coming down from Glory
[46:03] coming down from glory to dwell in in
[46:06] flesh and Fallen Earth and dealing with
[46:08] sin the way that he had to and to be
[46:10] surrounded by that that took do you talk
[46:12] about Grace for for one to leave the
[46:14] Throne of Heaven to leave the portals of
[46:16] Heaven as the songs would say and to
[46:18] come down and dwell with Mankind and
[46:20] step into Fallen flesh the way that he
[46:22] had to boy you talk about Grace but then
[46:24] we talked about the in First Corinthians
[46:26] 6 that when God called you he
[46:28] automatically made a way he says not
[46:30] those that I called I Justified those
[46:32] that I Justified I Sanctified and those
[46:34] that I Sanctified I glorified amen but
[46:36] it's not just an invitation but it's an
[46:38] invitation where like I said like at the
[46:40] wedding supper he's provided the
[46:41] transportation he's provided the
[46:43] clothing he's provided the directions
[46:44] he's provided the food he's provided
[46:46] everything we have need of to get across
[46:49] the Finish Line in this walk that we
[46:50] call Christianity amen he's already made
[46:53] us acceptable to him he's already given
[46:54] us a robe of his righteousness of his
[46:56] will of his grace of his works and all
[46:58] of these different things and so it's
[47:00] just by grace that we have to say I'll
[47:02] take it I'll take it and we will walk
[47:04] into these things then we looked at
[47:06] justification and and how the truth of
[47:08] justification is that you didn't even
[47:09] sin in the first place brother Branham
[47:12] said at first he says now justification
[47:13] is as if you didn't and then the further
[47:16] on he went in his Revelation he got to
[47:18] the final place and he said she is
[47:20] perfect she never did it in the first
[47:22] place and I want to read a quote here he
[47:24] says I'll go and prepare a place for you
[47:26] take you out of this pest house and
[47:28] deliver you into my father's house amen
[47:30] there you are take you out of this old
[47:31] Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare
[47:34] a place a perfect place where no evil
[47:36] exists no sickness exists no old age
[47:39] exists no death exists it's a perfect
[47:42] place calling you to that Perfection and
[47:46] you have to be perfect to get there
[47:48] we look at that idea of perfection say
[47:50] we've got to be perfect here no no
[47:52] you've got to be in his Perfection it's
[47:55] not your Perfection you're never going
[47:56] to have Perfection here the way that we
[47:58] look at his Perfection it's his robe of
[48:01] righteousness it's his Holiness that we
[48:03] put on it's his spirit it's his life
[48:04] that is the Perfection that he's seeking
[48:06] and we'll get into this more as we get
[48:08] into not the service tonight but in
[48:10] future Services what that Perfection
[48:11] looks like he said the Bible said so
[48:13] Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even
[48:16] as your father in Heaven is perfect he
[48:18] says it's a perfect Kingdom so it must
[48:21] be a perfect people come he says because
[48:24] you have to stand and be married to a
[48:26] perfect Son of God and you must be a
[48:28] perfect bride so how can you do it
[48:30] through anything else but the perfect
[48:32] word of God which is the Waters of
[48:35] Separation that washes us from our sins
[48:37] amen what is our Perfection when the
[48:39] word has a perfect work when the word
[48:42] does what it's supposed to do when we
[48:43] let it have free reign in our life it
[48:45] says it washes us from our sins amen
[48:47] that's right the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:49] think of it the dripping bloody word and
[48:52] amen the blood the word of God bleeding
[48:54] blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir
[48:57] she stands perfect virgin unadulterated
[49:02] he he said this in 1965 20 days before
[49:06] he died she stands perfect virgin
[49:08] unadulterated he says she never sinned
[49:11] in the first place amen he says she was
[49:14] trapped into it now that's a hard thing
[49:16] for us to to even comprehend because we
[49:19] have memories of our failures you know
[49:20] some of us we have pictures of our
[49:22] failures we've got scars of our failures
[49:25] we've got physical and mental and
[49:27] emotional trauma that has been ingrained
[49:30] inside of us and we have all of these
[49:31] reminders of everything that we did
[49:33] wrong inside of us we don't need God to
[49:36] remind us we don't need Satan to remind
[49:37] us we have our own reminders we've got a
[49:39] memory we've got a conscience we've got
[49:41] all these things and all you have to do
[49:42] is go hang out someplace where you used
[49:44] to be drive by somewhere that you used
[49:46] to go do something and you'll remember
[49:48] those things and it reminds you that
[49:49] you're not perfect
[49:51] but Satan tries to bring those things up
[49:54] to get us off the idea that wrapped in
[49:56] his robe of righteousness under the
[49:58] blood of Jesus Christ we never even
[50:00] sinned in the first place
[50:02] amen so don't let your memories try and
[50:04] trap you don't let your the your
[50:06] conscience of things that are are in
[50:08] your past hold you because under the
[50:10] blood they never happened in the first
[50:11] place that's what we want to be reminded
[50:13] of here you know last service I talked
[50:15] about shame for a little bit and I said
[50:17] Christ came to take away our shame but
[50:19] let me tell you the only reason you even
[50:21] have shame is because you got an
[50:23] invitation to come up higher
[50:25] there are people walking around in the
[50:27] world doing things that you are perhaps
[50:29] ashamed of today and there is no shame
[50:31] in them because they don't even realize
[50:33] there's anything wrong with it the
[50:35] reason you can even feel shame in the
[50:36] first place is because you've come out
[50:38] of it you come to a higher plane you
[50:40] come to a higher calling you've stepped
[50:42] out from this human nature and you've
[50:44] stepped into a glorified nature you've
[50:46] stepped into a Godly nature and that's
[50:48] what gives you shame of what you were of
[50:50] what you did in these different things
[50:51] amen we were in the ditches and the
[50:53] hedges when he called us whether we like
[50:55] to think of it that way or not
[50:57] amen but it's because we got that
[50:59] invitation to a wedding supper that we
[51:02] realize hey I'm in a shameful condition
[51:04] now we look back in Revelations 3 this
[51:06] is the laity in church age it says I
[51:08] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[51:10] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[51:13] white Raymond that thou mayest be
[51:14] clothed and that the shame of thy
[51:17] nakedness do not appear he says in
[51:19] anoint thine eyes with ice have the thou
[51:21] mayest sea now this is the message to
[51:23] the final Gentile Church age these are
[51:26] the instructions to get out of here
[51:28] you want to know how to get out of here
[51:30] this is how you do it if you have shame
[51:32] then there's a remedy and he says the
[51:34] remedy is that you take the clothing
[51:36] that he's provided
[51:38] you take what he's provided you wrap
[51:40] that around yourself and your shame is
[51:42] gone what is it it's the robe of his
[51:44] righteousness which is his will which is
[51:46] his word which is his grace which is his
[51:49] provision which is his own Holiness and
[51:52] our message has been sent in this in
[51:54] this time to let us know how to get rid
[51:55] of our shame
[51:57] so the only thing that would hold us
[51:59] back from from not being from being
[52:02] pressed into that shame is that
[52:04] religious spirit of a laodicean
[52:06] because the laodicean spirit is I don't
[52:08] have need of anything I have everything
[52:11] I need of I'm rich and I'm increased of
[52:13] goods and I have need of nothing it's a
[52:14] religious spirit it's a prideful spirit
[52:16] it's a deceiving spirit that says I
[52:19] don't have to even listen to what's
[52:20] coming over the pulpit because that's
[52:22] for everybody else I'm just going to go
[52:24] in a rapture
[52:26] it's that Pitchfork religion that
[52:28] brother Steve Clark talked about where
[52:29] everything that comes over the pulpit
[52:31] you've got somebody else to land it on
[52:33] that's a religious spirit that's a
[52:35] laodicean spirit is when you can come to
[52:37] the house of God when you can read the
[52:39] word and there's never a correction
[52:40] applied
[52:42] listen the isab that he's talking about
[52:44] will make you see what you really are
[52:46] and it'll bring you to a place where you
[52:48] say I need something more than what I've
[52:49] got
[52:50] Proverbs said this he said Proverbs says
[52:53] this when Pride cometh then cometh shame
[52:58] shame comes when you don't accept the
[53:00] word of God because you'll find yourself
[53:02] down a road that you didn't even realize
[53:04] you're walking and you'll get so far
[53:06] down the road and all of a sudden
[53:08] hopefully by God's grace your eyes will
[53:10] come open and you'll say oh my goodness
[53:11] what was I thinking what was I doing
[53:13] what was I believing
[53:16] what kind of leadership was this that I
[53:18] was under because I'm so far away from
[53:19] the word of God and I've got such a far
[53:21] road back what is it pride takes us
[53:23] further down that road than we could
[53:24] ever imagine he says but with the lowly
[53:27] is wisdom amen God help us to walk into
[53:30] what he thinks about us what he sees in
[53:32] US rather than what we think about
[53:34] ourselves amen amen if we're standing
[53:36] still remember brother Brown said we're
[53:38] backsliding because God's always trying
[53:40] to bring us into a higher maturity
[53:42] always trying to grow us amen but it's
[53:45] that resistant proud stubborn attitude
[53:47] that says I'm fine right where I am
[53:50] I don't know about you I'm not happy
[53:52] where I am as in I'm not satisfied to
[53:54] stay here I'm thankful for what he's
[53:56] given I'm thankful for what he's done
[53:58] like brother Brown says about that color
[54:00] woman she says I know that I'm not what
[54:02] I used to be and I'm not what I'm
[54:04] supposed to be
[54:05] but thank God I'm not what I used to be
[54:07] I used to be something I'm supposed to
[54:10] be something and I'm somewhere in
[54:11] between but I'm glad at least I've moved
[54:12] away from what I used to be amen
[54:15] listen the scripture says whosoever
[54:17] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[54:20] and then that's our rest is that we
[54:21] believe in this word of God Amen and the
[54:24] only thing that's going to cause us to
[54:25] be shamed in the end is that we didn't
[54:26] heed the call and we didn't obey the
[54:28] word
[54:29] because he's going to say you had a
[54:31] witness in front of you this whole time
[54:32] this whole world has had a witness this
[54:35] whole world there's going to be no
[54:36] excuses in the end and the only shame
[54:38] will be that we see it and we don't do
[54:39] it we don't accept it we don't go the
[54:41] way that God says amen then we talked
[54:43] about sanctification I'm going to pick
[54:45] up there for just the first portion of
[54:46] this service to clarify what that is
[54:48] because justification says you didn't
[54:50] sin in the first place and then
[54:52] sanctification comes right behind and
[54:54] says yeah but you're still dirty
[54:56] and it's a bit of a paradox but it's the
[54:58] process of the working of God it's the
[55:00] order of eternal life and the the
[55:02] process of sanctification has to bring
[55:04] us to a realization that the way we're
[55:06] living is not in line with the word and
[55:09] the process of sanctification is to get
[55:10] our life cleaned up so that our the word
[55:12] is reflected in that portion of our life
[55:15] amen is to get those things out of our
[55:17] life that would hold back the presence
[55:18] or the indwelling of God
[55:20] brother Bob says this he says you never
[55:23] hear God say go back
[55:27] never go back go forward as long as
[55:30] you're in the line of duty now we've
[55:32] received justification and don't know
[55:34] what sanctification means it's the line
[55:36] of duty go forward if you're Sanctified
[55:38] and never received the Holy Ghost it's
[55:40] the line of duty go forward if you're
[55:42] sick and you can't get well you've done
[55:43] all the doctor told you to do and still
[55:45] you can't get well your line of duty is
[55:47] to go forward he says go forward speak
[55:50] to the people and then go forward just
[55:52] keep moving on Amen so that's why I said
[55:55] in this at the start of this series
[55:56] don't worry if you say brother John I
[55:59] feel like I'm at the beginning
[56:01] I've just been baptized I've just been
[56:04] Justified but my life still has a lot of
[56:06] cleaning up and needs to do don't worry
[56:08] about where you're at just worry that
[56:10] you're in the process
[56:11] as long as you're in the process you're
[56:13] okay because what he starts working he's
[56:16] going to finish her working
[56:18] so don't don't be worried if you're not
[56:20] to the Finish Line be worried if you
[56:22] haven't started if you haven't even
[56:23] started in this race if you haven't
[56:24] started in this process of coming to
[56:26] eternal life amen you're coming through
[56:28] it just keep moving forward
[56:31] don't get down because you're not maybe
[56:33] as far ahead as you think you are or
[56:35] thought you were but just hold on to
[56:37] where you're at and say Lord I want to
[56:38] keep moving forward from where I am
[56:40] don't go back to anything don't rest and
[56:43] say well this is as much as I've got no
[56:45] keep pressing forward
[56:48] talking about sanctification Paul said
[56:50] this to Timothy he said study to show
[56:52] thyself approved unto God a Workman that
[56:54] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[56:56] dividing the word of truth but Sean
[56:59] profane and vain bablings
[57:01] in other words look at what you're
[57:03] talking about
[57:05] remember we talked last last service
[57:07] about Paul said everything is lawful
[57:09] unto me but everything's not expedient
[57:12] watch what you're dwelling on and don't
[57:14] get uh caught up in things that have
[57:16] nothing to do with the word of God that
[57:18] have nothing to do with the gospel that
[57:20] have nothing to do with the kingdom of
[57:21] God that have nothing to do with your
[57:23] Eternal destination there are so many
[57:25] people including Believers that are
[57:26] caught up in the politics of the world
[57:28] in the economies of this world in the
[57:30] careers of this world and all of this
[57:31] mess that's here and it's a total trap
[57:33] of the devil don't get caught up in it
[57:35] because there's no coming out of it it's
[57:37] all got to burn
[57:38] if it's going to burn it ain't worth
[57:40] getting caught up in that's for sure he
[57:42] says for they will increase unto more
[57:44] ungodliness dropping down to verse 19 he
[57:46] says nevertheless the foundation of God
[57:49] stand is sure having this seal the Lord
[57:52] knoweth him that are his and let
[57:54] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[57:56] apart from iniquity in other words if
[57:58] you call yourself a Christian act like a
[58:01] Christian is what he's saying here
[58:03] if you take the name of Christian you
[58:04] better act like Christian and today that
[58:06] word that phrase has no meaning
[58:08] whatsoever to most people because you
[58:10] you look at what people call themselves
[58:12] Christians and you look at the the
[58:14] bandwidth of the the the difference
[58:15] between ones are on this side and that
[58:17] side and we have people that will go
[58:19] around dressed in no clothes cursing
[58:20] smoking drinking fornicating all these
[58:23] different things and call themselves a
[58:24] Christian
[58:25] and then you've got the true beliefs
[58:27] over here True Believers over here and
[58:28] they're living a completely different
[58:29] life Paul's saying if you take on the
[58:31] name of Christ you better Live the Life
[58:32] of Christ
[58:34] he says but in a great house there are
[58:38] not only vessels of gold and of silver
[58:40] remember in my father's house are many
[58:42] mansions
[58:43] he says there also of gold and silver
[58:45] also of wood and of Earth and some to
[58:48] honor and some to dishonor so there's a
[58:50] diversity of vessels there's a diversity
[58:52] of responsibilities there's a diversity
[58:54] of callings within the kingdom of God
[58:56] and that means some of us are placed low
[58:58] some of us are placed in the middle and
[59:00] some of us are placed high in terms of
[59:02] responsibility
[59:04] and there is a higher honor for those
[59:06] that are in higher responsibility but
[59:08] the other thing is there's a higher
[59:09] price to pay as well
[59:11] most of us would love to be like Paul or
[59:13] like Peter or like brother Branham or or
[59:16] one of these great Heroes of the faith
[59:18] but how many of us want to go through
[59:19] the trials and tribulations and testings
[59:21] that they went through to get there how
[59:24] many of us are willing to have a thorn
[59:25] in our flesh to get the revelations that
[59:27] Paul had
[59:28] to go out on the back side of the desert
[59:30] for years and years and years to let the
[59:32] Holy Spirit teach us
[59:34] to have to get knocked off of your horse
[59:36] in public and see everybody see you made
[59:38] a fool of in front of everybody
[59:40] that's what it takes how many of us
[59:42] would be willing to be crucified upside
[59:43] down like Peter
[59:45] this is the the the the level of
[59:47] character that's in these sorts of
[59:48] Heroes of the faith that's what's
[59:50] required to be there and God knows how
[59:52] to put it in but I'll tell you if you
[59:54] want to be a big shot in the kingdom of
[59:55] God you got to be ready to be humbled
[59:57] because that's the first thing he did to
[59:58] every one of them was he humbled them
[1:00:00] amen but watch this we're talking about
[1:00:03] sanctification he says if a man
[1:00:05] therefore Purge himself from these
[1:00:09] Purge himself justification is yours by
[1:00:12] faith through Grace
[1:00:14] you've gotta you've got to accept You've
[1:00:16] Got to Believe In the finished work of
[1:00:17] Calvary but now we're looking at
[1:00:19] sanctification you've got something to
[1:00:21] do here too you get to decide you get to
[1:00:24] act you get to choose
[1:00:26] Paul says to Timothy if a man therefore
[1:00:28] Purge himself from these things
[1:00:31] you purge it
[1:00:33] you say I don't want it in my life Lord
[1:00:36] this ought not to be here I'm walking
[1:00:38] away now you keep me away from it you
[1:00:40] make a choice every day of your life are
[1:00:42] you going to be Sanctified or are you
[1:00:44] going to be dirty
[1:00:45] he says he says if a man therefore Purge
[1:00:48] himself he shall be future tense
[1:00:51] a vessel unto honor
[1:00:53] Sanctified and meet for the Master's use
[1:00:56] acceptable for the Master's use and
[1:00:59] prepared unto so it's a current process
[1:01:02] for future events
[1:01:04] you're being prepared Now for Something
[1:01:06] in the future prepared unto every good
[1:01:10] work amen notice he says if a man Purge
[1:01:12] himself sanctification is absolutely a
[1:01:15] work of the Holy Spirit by conviction
[1:01:18] by conviction you're not responsible for
[1:01:21] your ignorance but if he shows it in the
[1:01:23] word if it is shown here clearly that
[1:01:25] you not not to do it then the Holy
[1:01:27] Spirit working with you is going to say
[1:01:28] so don't do it stop doing it you've
[1:01:30] heard it so stop doing it and you get to
[1:01:32] make a choice there but it's under
[1:01:34] conviction now not under condemnation
[1:01:36] amen but you've got to decide to let
[1:01:39] things go remember brother Brandon would
[1:01:40] talk about spirits and he'd say if you
[1:01:42] love it too much God will never take it
[1:01:44] off of you you've got to decide I don't
[1:01:46] like it
[1:01:47] and you really got to not want it and
[1:01:49] sometimes that takes us getting to a
[1:01:51] place of great shame of Great Depression
[1:01:53] of great bondage even before we say this
[1:01:56] is overcoming me to the point where I
[1:01:59] can't even stand to live without it that
[1:02:00] means I got to get rid of it
[1:02:02] where we're so addicted to something
[1:02:04] we're so held by something we're so
[1:02:05] Bound by something we get into
[1:02:07] desperation and that's when God comes on
[1:02:09] the scene because we say I'm sick of
[1:02:11] this
[1:02:12] I'm sick of loving it I'm sick of
[1:02:13] needing it I'm sick of wanting it I'm
[1:02:15] sick of seeking it I need this out of my
[1:02:17] life and that's when the Holy Spirit can
[1:02:18] do a work to kick it out of your life
[1:02:21] but if you've invited it in if you've
[1:02:23] opened the door then he's not going to
[1:02:24] kick it out
[1:02:25] you got to start trying to kick it out
[1:02:27] before he'll move in today man but
[1:02:29] sanctification is where you get to your
[1:02:31] own thoughts and your own mind and you
[1:02:32] get to receive the word or you get to
[1:02:34] reject the word and if you'll just agree
[1:02:36] with the word mentally that's not going
[1:02:38] to do it but you're going to have to
[1:02:39] take it into your mind and now put it on
[1:02:41] your lips put it in your life and say
[1:02:42] now I want it to be in my life not just
[1:02:45] in my mind amen
[1:02:47] and when you do that God's not going to
[1:02:49] use you fully but God can use you in a
[1:02:51] Sanctified condition absolutely and
[1:02:52] we'll prove it by the scriptures as we
[1:02:54] go through this series amen but it's the
[1:02:56] work of the Holy Spirit preparing you
[1:02:58] for good work in the future which is
[1:03:00] your Kingdom Purpose which is God's will
[1:03:02] for your life
[1:03:03] he says flee also youthful us but follow
[1:03:06] righteousness Faith charity peace with
[1:03:09] them that call on the Lord out of a pure
[1:03:12] heart the prophet of God will put this
[1:03:13] way he says the word Saint means the
[1:03:15] Sanctified ones in other words we must
[1:03:18] contend for the faith that was once
[1:03:20] delivered to the Sanctified ones
[1:03:22] sanctification means to be called out
[1:03:25] set apart
[1:03:28] cleansea cleansed and set apart for
[1:03:31] service
[1:03:32] now we're coming into this idea of
[1:03:34] adoption and we're getting into the mean
[1:03:36] of the message this evening because this
[1:03:37] is a working of the Holy Spirit but you
[1:03:40] do not yet have the Holy Spirit
[1:03:43] you can have an atmosphere of the Holy
[1:03:45] Spirit you can be surrounded by the Holy
[1:03:47] Spirit you can be in church services
[1:03:49] where the holy spirit is and it does a
[1:03:51] cleaning work on you but you do not yet
[1:03:53] have the Holy Spirit
[1:03:55] and literally your life can be Crystal
[1:03:57] Clean and yet you don't have the Holy
[1:03:59] Spirit but it's absolutely the
[1:04:01] supernatural working of the holy spirit
[1:04:03] in your life
[1:04:06] that's what does it it's the Holy Spirit
[1:04:07] working on you amen it's cleaned up by
[1:04:10] by conviction of the Holy Spirit and
[1:04:12] it's the training of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:13] that's doing it and it's God testing us
[1:04:15] to see what we'll do when he puts his
[1:04:17] word in front of us
[1:04:18] this is literally a portion of the
[1:04:20] tutoring of the holy spirit that we talk
[1:04:22] about in the adoption process it's
[1:04:24] telling you what's right and seeing if
[1:04:26] you'll do it seen if you'll obey it
[1:04:29] but after that we come to the and really
[1:04:31] these are these are things that happen
[1:04:32] within themselves sanctification and
[1:04:35] this new heart new spirit but that's
[1:04:37] what we've read at the start of this
[1:04:38] service this idea of a new heart and a
[1:04:39] new spirit he says a new heart also will
[1:04:41] I give you and a new spirit will I put
[1:04:43] within you and I will take away the
[1:04:45] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:04:47] give you and heart of Flesh now the
[1:04:49] first bit he says is a new heart and the
[1:04:52] scripture is very clear about the
[1:04:53] difference between the old one and the
[1:04:55] new one the old one is Stony and the new
[1:04:57] one is fleshy now I don't know about you
[1:04:59] but when I compare flesh and stone
[1:05:01] there's a few things that stand out if I
[1:05:03] compare this to stone stone is way
[1:05:06] harder than flesh
[1:05:08] stone is not yielding Stone does not
[1:05:10] give it does not bend it is completely
[1:05:13] resistant to change or external Force
[1:05:15] it's unmoving it's very difficult to
[1:05:18] change and if you want to do anything
[1:05:20] with stone you need very heavy very
[1:05:22] powerful or very abrasive equipment
[1:05:25] when you're working with stone you can't
[1:05:27] go up there or it takes an awful lot of
[1:05:29] time you can stick a stone in a river
[1:05:30] for a thousand years and it'll smooth it
[1:05:32] out or you can put it under uh some sort
[1:05:35] of a Sandy mechanism and you can smooth
[1:05:37] it in 30 seconds
[1:05:38] but you need something very powerful
[1:05:40] very abrasive to work with stone but by
[1:05:42] contrast flesh is soft it's yielding
[1:05:45] when flesh goes up against stones stone
[1:05:47] winds every time doesn't it
[1:05:50] flesh is is easy to work with it's easy
[1:05:52] to manipulate our bone our body compared
[1:05:55] to muscle it's just not durable at all
[1:05:57] compared to Stone
[1:05:59] so this this heart that we have is
[1:06:01] something that can be worked with in
[1:06:03] other words
[1:06:04] that it's not resistant it's not
[1:06:06] stubborn it's not unmoving but it's
[1:06:08] something that God can work with and the
[1:06:09] prophet puts it this way he says so God
[1:06:11] had to give you a new heart not a
[1:06:14] patched up one
[1:06:15] a new heart and he says that's your
[1:06:18] intellect that you think with a new way
[1:06:21] of thinking
[1:06:23] he says then when he gave you a new way
[1:06:25] of thinking yes this is what it looks
[1:06:27] like yes that's right the Bible looks to
[1:06:29] be reasonable I used to didn't believe
[1:06:31] that I believe it now
[1:06:34] now there is your great Revival see they
[1:06:37] say yeah sure I don't want to go to hell
[1:06:39] I want to accept Christ that's all right
[1:06:41] that's good that's just your first step
[1:06:45] when you can agree with the word that
[1:06:47] just means you've got a new heart
[1:06:50] and we have turned that like I said
[1:06:52] before we can agree with the message and
[1:06:54] we think that we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:55] no that's just the work of a new heart
[1:06:57] potentially
[1:07:00] to look at it and say yeah that seems
[1:07:02] reasonable like he says and I want to do
[1:07:03] it that's a new heart that does it
[1:07:05] brother Branham said this is why there
[1:07:07] are so many people so many Christians
[1:07:09] wrecked on the side of the road is this
[1:07:11] spot right here
[1:07:12] now remember it's not Pitchfork religion
[1:07:14] today we want to look at our own lives
[1:07:16] here this is our messenger talking to us
[1:07:21] behold I send you
[1:07:23] Elijah he didn't come to the
[1:07:26] denominations he didn't come to the
[1:07:27] world that that's not believing he came
[1:07:29] to Believers so this is our message this
[1:07:31] is for us
[1:07:32] this is for you and I this evening amen
[1:07:34] this is our Elijah so let's not put it
[1:07:37] on somebody else in the Pew let's look
[1:07:39] at our own lives amen
[1:07:41] like I said know where you're at and
[1:07:43] keep pressing onward
[1:07:45] notice how this is a work of the Holy
[1:07:47] Spirit but the baptism of the holy
[1:07:49] spirit is not till the end of the new
[1:07:52] heart and the new spirit and then he
[1:07:53] says I'll put a new spirit within you
[1:07:56] but I want you to consider the way
[1:07:57] brother Brown talks about this he says
[1:07:59] if the Holy Spirit brooding over mankind
[1:08:02] that's already nothing but dust of the
[1:08:04] earth he says the holy spirit is the
[1:08:06] only one who can brood
[1:08:09] eternal life into you your
[1:08:11] intellectuality no matter how brilliant
[1:08:13] you may be is totally rejected by God
[1:08:17] your denominations means not that much
[1:08:19] to God and in the in the I took it out
[1:08:21] of here but he says he snaps like that
[1:08:23] says you're a great teacher of theology
[1:08:25] doesn't mean that to God it takes the
[1:08:27] brooding of the Holy Spirit to bring you
[1:08:29] into the fellowship of God to give you
[1:08:32] eternal life to raise you up at the last
[1:08:34] day he says accept a man be born of the
[1:08:36] spirit and water healing no wise enter
[1:08:38] in
[1:08:39] this idea of brooding is a key concept
[1:08:41] and brother Brandon would come to this
[1:08:42] over and over and over again because
[1:08:45] he's showing the work and the effect of
[1:08:47] the Holy Spirit as contrasted with the
[1:08:51] indwelling of the holy spirit amen you
[1:08:54] can't confuse the two the brooding is
[1:08:57] not the indwelling the brooding is the
[1:08:59] presence the anointing the atmosphere of
[1:09:02] God around us with us
[1:09:06] but that's the thing that brother Brown
[1:09:07] says you can have that on your flesh 24
[1:09:09] hours a day and go to hell
[1:09:11] because it's not in you but it's around
[1:09:13] you
[1:09:15] he says and the great Holy Spirit over
[1:09:17] the Earth as a mental picture he says
[1:09:18] we're going to make it like wings with
[1:09:20] his great Wings around the earth
[1:09:22] brooding making love cooing he's
[1:09:23] treating it like a bird like a head he
[1:09:26] says come come the father has ordained
[1:09:28] you come I'm coming to perform what the
[1:09:31] father's word has said he says it says
[1:09:33] soaking in I've come to manifest what
[1:09:36] the father has spoken
[1:09:39] brood he says and after a while
[1:09:43] it's a process of time don't look for
[1:09:45] immediacy
[1:09:49] there is a moment where you come to life
[1:09:51] but there's nine months before that and
[1:09:53] this is what he's saying there's a
[1:09:54] brooding there's something that's going
[1:09:55] on in the meantime he says and after a
[1:09:58] while there begin to come some petroleum
[1:10:00] moving across the earth a little bit of
[1:10:02] this and that and a little Easter Lily
[1:10:03] comes up in the Earth
[1:10:05] he says what brought it the Holy Spirit
[1:10:10] brooding
[1:10:11] then along Along come the Dahlia the
[1:10:14] Azalea and the other bushes then Along
[1:10:16] come the vegetation he says the Holy
[1:10:19] Spirit brooding
[1:10:21] everything was in there
[1:10:24] everything was in there
[1:10:26] but the presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:28] brings it to life
[1:10:31] this is absolutely key the presence of
[1:10:33] the Holy Spirit brings it up it brings
[1:10:36] out he says what the in the in the last
[1:10:39] verse quote he says I'm here to bring
[1:10:40] out what the father said
[1:10:42] so it's bringing out the word amen that
[1:10:45] went forth he says then Along come the
[1:10:47] vegetation come the trees the plant
[1:10:49] light then after a while birds begin to
[1:10:51] fly from the dust of the earth he says
[1:10:53] the Holy Spirit brooding them together
[1:10:56] and sent them into the air what causing
[1:10:59] the Earth to form into a bird and then
[1:11:02] Life coming into it and it flying away
[1:11:04] he says then Along Came the animal life
[1:11:07] the Holy Spirit brooding this was all
[1:11:10] remember script says and the and the
[1:11:12] spirit of the Lord the presence of the
[1:11:13] Lord moved across the face of the Earth
[1:11:14] that's what he's talking about the
[1:11:15] brooding the atmosphere that what is it
[1:11:18] it's the Holy Spirit going out from God
[1:11:19] to do the work of the word it's the
[1:11:22] power of the word amen listen we look at
[1:11:25] this and he's talking about plants he's
[1:11:27] talking about birds he's talking about
[1:11:28] trees none of those things had the Holy
[1:11:31] Spirit
[1:11:32] but the presence of the Holy Spirit has
[1:11:35] an effect
[1:11:37] even if you don't have a soul the
[1:11:39] presence of the Holy Spirit has an
[1:11:40] effect
[1:11:42] remember brother Branham he goes and he
[1:11:43] walks into that field with the bull
[1:11:45] that animal has no soul but the Holy
[1:11:48] Spirit had an effect on that animal
[1:11:50] that's how my that's how Adam even
[1:11:52] before he was in flesh he was leading
[1:11:54] them as the Holy Spirit leads up us
[1:11:55] brother Branham says by the spirit there
[1:11:57] was an effect there was an atmosphere
[1:11:59] amen what does the Holy Spirit do it's
[1:12:01] meant to produce the word of God it's
[1:12:03] the power of God to perform his word to
[1:12:07] manifest it that's what it's meant to do
[1:12:08] that's why we believe in anointed
[1:12:10] preaching
[1:12:12] because it's what the Holy Spirit
[1:12:14] bringing out what's inside of you that's
[1:12:16] why we believe in anointed song leaders
[1:12:18] in anointed musicians you can't just
[1:12:21] come up here because you have a gift to
[1:12:22] play you have to be anointed
[1:12:26] that's what makes the difference listen
[1:12:28] sister Maureen would say time and time
[1:12:30] again there are way better players than
[1:12:32] her 100 maybe not in this church but a
[1:12:36] hundred percent but I'll tell you she's
[1:12:38] got an anointing that very few ever have
[1:12:41] why because she's got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:44] that's the Difference Maker the
[1:12:46] Difference Maker is not the gift
[1:12:48] the Difference Maker is not the gift the
[1:12:50] Difference Maker is when the gift is
[1:12:51] yielded to the Holy Spirit not to money
[1:12:55] not to influence not not to some desire
[1:12:59] not to some program but to the Holy
[1:13:01] Spirit to use you for his purpose to do
[1:13:05] what to bring out the word the very
[1:13:08] things of God that are inside of us that
[1:13:10] worship leads us into the presence of
[1:13:12] God and that is in and of itself a holy
[1:13:14] spirit an anointing movement that brings
[1:13:16] us into those things amen
[1:13:19] even people that don't even know they're
[1:13:21] a child of God can come into that
[1:13:23] presence and they realize they're in
[1:13:25] something different
[1:13:27] because it has an effect everything
[1:13:28] responds to the Holy Spirit some can't
[1:13:31] take it
[1:13:32] and some love it and they don't even
[1:13:34] know what it is
[1:13:35] because they get arrest they get a piece
[1:13:38] they get an energy from it whatever it
[1:13:39] might be people have all sorts of things
[1:13:41] for it they talk about it they talk
[1:13:42] about you have an energy about you they
[1:13:44] talk about you have a light around you
[1:13:46] all these different things I've heard it
[1:13:47] all
[1:13:48] and what is it it's the Holy Spirit on
[1:13:49] you there's a presence there's an
[1:13:51] anointing that surrounds us as we walk
[1:13:53] through this world today
[1:13:55] but brother Brandon would say he says
[1:13:56] it's not just in this earth he says it's
[1:14:00] in this earth the Holy Spirit Broods
[1:14:02] over this Earth and he says the holy
[1:14:03] spirit is brooding with this new heart
[1:14:05] and this new spirit it's brooding over
[1:14:07] you to produce the very thing inside of
[1:14:09] you just like he did with the Earth back
[1:14:11] in Genesis 1.
[1:14:13] what is it it's just like we talked
[1:14:15] about in adoption the tutor is bringing
[1:14:17] out what's in the Sun
[1:14:20] and he's in the presence of the Tudor
[1:14:22] he's not in the presence of the father
[1:14:24] he's in the presence of the Tudor and
[1:14:25] the tutor is bringing out what's in him
[1:14:27] good or bad
[1:14:29] because that's what student is bringing
[1:14:30] forth whatever's inside that's the work
[1:14:32] of the holy spirit amen what is it it's
[1:14:35] to show what's already inside the earth
[1:14:36] human flesh by the word of God what I
[1:14:40] have in here is by the word of God
[1:14:42] before the foundation of the world and
[1:14:43] it's the work of the Holy Spirit to
[1:14:45] bring it out listen to this he says if
[1:14:48] you won't accept righteousness then
[1:14:50] unrighteousness will take over
[1:14:52] if you won't receive Christ the world
[1:14:54] will take you you can't go out that door
[1:14:57] the same person you were coming in here
[1:14:59] you can't be he says the Holy Spirit
[1:15:01] brooding wooing calling he says oh if
[1:15:05] you'll come I'll take away that Stony
[1:15:07] heart see sanctification church is about
[1:15:10] surrender
[1:15:11] sanctification is about laying down your
[1:15:13] rights remember laodicea means people's
[1:15:15] rights I don't have to do it
[1:15:19] I like this I like that I believe this I
[1:15:22] believe that no no no no sanctification
[1:15:24] is about surrender to what the word says
[1:15:28] and that alone that alone you're not
[1:15:31] surrendering to the pastor you're not
[1:15:32] surrendering to the preacher you're not
[1:15:33] surrendering to Mom and Dada you're
[1:15:35] surrendering to the word
[1:15:36] amen and the Holy Spirit will lead you
[1:15:38] to the word every time he says oh if
[1:15:40] you'll come I'll take away that Stony
[1:15:42] heart if you'll come I'll place a new
[1:15:44] spirit in you and if you'll come I will
[1:15:47] come into this new spirit see you've got
[1:15:49] to choose you've got to surrender you've
[1:15:51] got to make a choice he says then when
[1:15:54] the Devil comes back what does he find
[1:15:55] he says he finds his old Tin Can Alley
[1:15:58] God sent his big bulldozer down and cut
[1:16:01] the thing all the pieces bulldozed it up
[1:16:03] and scraped it all off and a Hallelujah
[1:16:05] Avenue is built there it ain't the same
[1:16:07] place there's a big modern home built
[1:16:10] there he says the Holy Spirit has
[1:16:12] brooded big beautiful flowers of
[1:16:15] Salvation standing up
[1:16:18] where once was dirt and filth and
[1:16:21] garbage things rattling around nobody
[1:16:23] wanted to be in your life he says now
[1:16:25] there's big beautiful flowers of
[1:16:27] Salvation standing up you don't have to
[1:16:29] try to impersonate anything it's a new
[1:16:31] heart it's a new dwelling place it's a
[1:16:34] new spirit he says everything is new
[1:16:37] it's a beautiful picture isn't it it's
[1:16:39] eaten all over again it's a garden of
[1:16:42] God and the thing is that sometimes it
[1:16:43] doesn't look like anything's happening
[1:16:46] you ever look at a new build when
[1:16:48] they've got a property and they're going
[1:16:49] to put a house on it somebody's bought
[1:16:51] it somebody's paid for it they've got
[1:16:53] the plans approved they've got the
[1:16:54] permits approved but you don't see
[1:16:55] anything of that going on all you see is
[1:16:57] that that land is supposed to be turned
[1:16:58] into a house and you don't see all the
[1:17:00] work that's going on in the background
[1:17:01] and then what happens is in a day what
[1:17:03] happens a bulldozer comes in and he
[1:17:04] levels all the trees he flattens it out
[1:17:06] next day a backhoe comes in and he digs
[1:17:08] out the foundation the next day they're
[1:17:10] pouring the foundation and then the next
[1:17:12] day after that they get they wait a
[1:17:13] couple days then they start framing it
[1:17:15] out we've got one going up by our house
[1:17:16] in a week they've got a house completely
[1:17:18] framed
[1:17:19] from nothing to house in a week
[1:17:21] but the thing is we didn't see all that
[1:17:23] work that was going in behind the ground
[1:17:25] behind the back that's the way it is
[1:17:27] with us sometimes we're looking we're
[1:17:28] saying nothing's happening like in the
[1:17:30] Garden of Eden when the Holy Spirit was
[1:17:32] brooding over it those plants were
[1:17:34] growing before they ever came out
[1:17:36] and if you are watching you'd say
[1:17:37] nothing's happening
[1:17:39] that kid's been in services for seven
[1:17:41] years and nothing's happening
[1:17:44] no no no just trust the brooding of the
[1:17:47] Holy Spirit
[1:17:48] it'll bring forth its thing in its own
[1:17:50] season and in its own time God's got a
[1:17:53] time for each and every one of them amen
[1:17:56] but you get that new heart and all of a
[1:17:57] sudden brother Brown says it's a
[1:17:59] different way of thinking and all of a
[1:18:00] sudden the word starts to make sense it
[1:18:03] starts to sound right it starts to
[1:18:04] resonate inside of us right the things
[1:18:07] of God start to have an attraction to
[1:18:09] you you're drawn to these things and and
[1:18:11] you start to say hey
[1:18:13] that that seems like something I'm
[1:18:15] really interested in
[1:18:17] and that starts to move you now into a
[1:18:20] change inside of your life
[1:18:21] but then after that he says then he said
[1:18:23] after that then I'll give you a new
[1:18:24] spirit so your thoughts are changing
[1:18:27] you're open to the word you're open to
[1:18:29] leadership
[1:18:30] you're open to change
[1:18:32] you're open to letting go you're open to
[1:18:34] surrender
[1:18:35] then he said after that then I'll give
[1:18:37] you a new spirit what's that he says a
[1:18:39] new desire I want to do right
[1:18:44] that's a great evidence that God's
[1:18:45] working in your life you at least want
[1:18:47] it
[1:18:48] you got to want it before you do it
[1:18:50] if you don't want it you're never going
[1:18:52] to do it
[1:18:53] but if you're at least wanting it and
[1:18:54] not doing it hey at least you're in the
[1:18:56] race
[1:18:57] amen he says a new desire but watch what
[1:18:59] he says now he says now I know I'm a
[1:19:01] Christian I'll smoke one more and then
[1:19:03] I'll throw it away
[1:19:05] see and I'll just see I'll just stay
[1:19:07] home tonight you know I'll just he says
[1:19:09] all these little just just that's
[1:19:11] exactly he says Eve stopped just for a
[1:19:13] moment that's all she had to do notice
[1:19:15] he said the old Spirit was just one more
[1:19:18] just this just that I'll put it off a
[1:19:21] day I'll put it off a week I won't go to
[1:19:22] church I won't do this I won't do that
[1:19:24] it was always able to just slide away
[1:19:27] from making that right decision
[1:19:30] knowing it's right but the desire isn't
[1:19:32] really there yet he says then he gives
[1:19:34] you a new desire the human nature is
[1:19:36] that you keep kicking your decisions
[1:19:38] down the road
[1:19:39] why because it's going to hurt
[1:19:41] giving up cigarettes is going to hurt
[1:19:42] giving up drinking is going to hurt
[1:19:44] giving up movies is going to have given
[1:19:45] up friendships whatever it is that's in
[1:19:47] your life it's all going to hurt amen
[1:19:49] but he says the new spirit is a new
[1:19:51] desire and that's what changes things
[1:19:53] it's not knowing what's right and wrong
[1:19:55] but it's wanting to do what's right and
[1:19:58] what's wrong
[1:19:59] lots of people have an intellectual
[1:20:01] conception of things that are right and
[1:20:02] wrong but they don't do them
[1:20:04] and there's no desire in them why
[1:20:06] because they don't have a new spirit
[1:20:08] and I'm talking even within this world
[1:20:10] not much less inside the church amen but
[1:20:12] he says this new spirit is a desire to
[1:20:14] do them not just to know them I mean not
[1:20:17] just to sit in church and not head at
[1:20:18] what's coming over the pulpit but a
[1:20:20] desire in you to go live it to put it
[1:20:23] into action amen you go make a decision
[1:20:25] that's a hundred percent according to
[1:20:26] the word and Watch What Happens
[1:20:28] you're going to face opposition
[1:20:31] somebody's going to get mad somebody's
[1:20:32] going to offend it somebody's going to
[1:20:33] leave somebody's going to stop talking
[1:20:35] to you somebody's gonna not like it
[1:20:37] because everything in this world is
[1:20:39] contrary to the word everything
[1:20:41] is contrary to the word amen everything
[1:20:43] every societal thought every human
[1:20:45] inclination is anti-word
[1:20:48] you start to do things right it's going
[1:20:50] to cause pain it's going to cause
[1:20:52] discomfort it's going to cause
[1:20:53] separation that's what the word does is
[1:20:55] it separates us from the world
[1:20:58] and guess what you need a new spirit to
[1:21:00] help you push through the pain to do the
[1:21:02] right thing
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] this gospel isn't meant to be just
[1:21:08] spoken over a Pulpit or reading a book
[1:21:10] it's meant to be lived
[1:21:11] the gospel is a way of life not a way of
[1:21:14] talk I mean that's what we're supposed
[1:21:16] to be doing everything remember what the
[1:21:17] angel told John in Revelation 10 he says
[1:21:19] it's sweet in the mouth but it's bitter
[1:21:21] in the belly and you need a new spirit
[1:21:22] to help you get to the bitter belly part
[1:21:25] because you've got to eat it you've got
[1:21:26] to become a part of you amen your old
[1:21:28] spirit will refuse it it'll say one more
[1:21:30] cigarette one one more service I won't
[1:21:33] go to whatever the case might be these
[1:21:34] are brother bradham's words not mine
[1:21:36] right but the new spirit will accept it
[1:21:38] knowing that it's not going to sit very
[1:21:39] well knowing that it's going to be a
[1:21:41] difficult thing to deal with
[1:21:43] he says he said he'd give you a new
[1:21:45] spirit now that spirit is in God's
[1:21:47] spirit that's your spirit God gives you
[1:21:50] a new spirit then he says I'll put my
[1:21:51] spirit in him but the thing God has to
[1:21:54] do is give you a new spirit make your
[1:21:56] nature a little more gentle and settle
[1:21:59] down or he couldn't even live with you
[1:22:03] when you see God working on a person
[1:22:05] brother Brown says they'll be more
[1:22:07] gentle
[1:22:08] and they'll settle down
[1:22:11] you know what does that
[1:22:13] humility
[1:22:16] because you realize
[1:22:19] I ain't such a big fish
[1:22:21] that's all
[1:22:22] you realize I got a lot of work to do
[1:22:26] that in the the view in the mirror of
[1:22:29] the scripture
[1:22:30] I'm a little nothing
[1:22:32] and so it humbles us and we get a little
[1:22:34] more gentle and we settle down he says
[1:22:37] so he has to get you fixed up first
[1:22:39] before he can come in I'll give you a
[1:22:43] new spirit it's the working of the Holy
[1:22:44] Spirit he says then you take him
[1:22:47] anywhere you go all kinds of places he's
[1:22:49] got to get you fixed so you can
[1:22:51] entertain him right when he means
[1:22:52] entertain like entertaining somebody in
[1:22:54] your home you can have somebody in your
[1:22:56] home he says you can have him in your
[1:22:58] home you can have him in your life once
[1:22:59] he cleans you up properly
[1:23:01] you get a new spirit and the things that
[1:23:03] that bothered you and tainted your life
[1:23:05] and cause you shame and anger and hurt
[1:23:07] start to Fall Away
[1:23:08] you start to let grudges go
[1:23:10] you start to let bygones be bygones
[1:23:13] you start to let these habits drop away
[1:23:15] and then you're open to change you're
[1:23:16] open to leadership you're you're open to
[1:23:18] worship you're open to expressing what
[1:23:20] you hear rather than just nodding your
[1:23:22] head to what you hear amen condemnation
[1:23:24] under this turns to conviction
[1:23:27] where you don't walk away because you're
[1:23:29] upset or because you're hurt or you're
[1:23:31] offended but you step into it because
[1:23:33] you know that when he says it there's
[1:23:35] always a remedy to bring you to it that
[1:23:37] when he sets that requirement when he
[1:23:39] sets that word before you he has a way
[1:23:41] made already for you to produce what he
[1:23:43] says is in you
[1:23:45] right condemnation goes out the door
[1:23:47] amen
[1:23:49] what you start to breathe some fresh air
[1:23:52] you ever notice maybe this is just me
[1:23:55] but you know in the summer on the few
[1:23:57] days when it gets so hot that you have
[1:23:59] to turn your air conditioning on your
[1:24:00] car and turn the recirculation fan on so
[1:24:02] that there's no outside air coming in
[1:24:04] and so it's just the same error over
[1:24:06] again what you don't realize is it gets
[1:24:08] stale after a while
[1:24:09] and all you have to do is hit that
[1:24:11] restart button and turn it off
[1:24:13] and in about five seconds you'll get
[1:24:15] just this
[1:24:16] and you're like oh my goodness I was in
[1:24:18] stale air this whole time
[1:24:20] that fresh air coming in try it
[1:24:21] everybody's going to try it now
[1:24:23] but that's what this is like is you
[1:24:25] start to realize there's a freshness
[1:24:27] there's a newness of life there's a
[1:24:30] freedom that you had no idea was there
[1:24:32] and not only that but you want to be in
[1:24:34] it even if it's not easy
[1:24:36] it's a new desire inside of you amen
[1:24:38] you're starting to realize that life is
[1:24:40] more than just jobs vacations
[1:24:42] relationships money cars whatever it is
[1:24:45] sports you're realizing there's more to
[1:24:48] this than just a Daily Grind and then we
[1:24:50] die
[1:24:52] he says
[1:24:54] you get a new spirit you quit your
[1:24:56] drinking
[1:24:57] you get a new spirit you quit your line
[1:25:00] you get a new spirit listen to this you
[1:25:03] can do most anything with that spirit
[1:25:06] but that isn't what God's talking about
[1:25:10] that's one of the most powerful things I
[1:25:12] think he's ever said when it comes to
[1:25:14] the difference between the Holy Spirit
[1:25:15] and the new spirit he says you can do
[1:25:17] almost anything with that Spirit but
[1:25:21] that's not what God's talking about he
[1:25:22] says a new spirit he said I'll give you
[1:25:24] now watch I'll give you a new heart and
[1:25:25] a new spirit why he'd have to give you a
[1:25:27] new spirit to live for him while you
[1:25:30] couldn't even live with yourself with
[1:25:31] the spirit you had you couldn't live
[1:25:32] with your neighbor you couldn't
[1:25:33] associate with the next man on the next
[1:25:35] corner you couldn't associate with these
[1:25:37] Christians while you'd have an awful
[1:25:39] you'd you'd have had an awful spirit so
[1:25:41] he has to give you a new spirit I'll
[1:25:43] give you a new heart a new spirit now
[1:25:46] watch and I'll put my spirit in you
[1:25:48] there's the difference he says I'll put
[1:25:50] my spirit in you
[1:25:53] he says and that's where you find it so
[1:25:55] hard that you go down to church and you
[1:25:56] get a different concept you know what I
[1:25:59] believe I ought to go to church then you
[1:26:00] go back home and say hallelujah I got it
[1:26:02] no you haven't then you go down to
[1:26:05] church and you say oh I believe that
[1:26:06] something's happened I don't look at
[1:26:07] things the way I used to Hallelujah he
[1:26:09] says in a few days you find yourself
[1:26:11] right down into the same old Route you
[1:26:14] were doubting reasoning and everything
[1:26:16] else
[1:26:17] he says well now a pastor so-and-so said
[1:26:19] that wasn't right I don't believe it's
[1:26:21] right I'll just take his word for it and
[1:26:23] I'll tell you I'm going to do this and
[1:26:24] do that and you find yourself up and
[1:26:26] down in and out he says see you just
[1:26:29] didn't go far enough
[1:26:31] you want an Evidence you don't have the
[1:26:33] Holy Ghost
[1:26:35] it's the ups and downs and in and outs
[1:26:38] it's a lack of an overcoming life
[1:26:41] where you take the word that's coming
[1:26:43] over the pulpit but you don't have the
[1:26:44] power to make it live
[1:26:46] he says you can have a new heart and a
[1:26:48] new spirit and that's a working of the
[1:26:49] Holy Ghost but you don't have the Holy
[1:26:51] Ghost yet
[1:26:52] you quit this you quit that
[1:26:55] but he says that's not it that's not
[1:26:56] what we're talking about
[1:26:58] now listen to this he says oh you say
[1:27:00] brother Branham I got all the evidences
[1:27:04] he says I know but we're not talking
[1:27:06] about evidences we're talking about the
[1:27:10] product
[1:27:12] we're talking about the product that's
[1:27:14] right yes sir I've seen Heathen show
[1:27:16] watch how he frames it I've seen them
[1:27:18] speak with tongues I've seen them lay
[1:27:19] down a pencil and write in unknown
[1:27:20] tongues and a witch raise up and read it
[1:27:22] interpret it and tell the truth if a man
[1:27:24] could speak with tongues if a man could
[1:27:26] shout if a man could see Visions if a
[1:27:28] man could do any of these other things
[1:27:29] that he can do without Divine love they
[1:27:34] are lost
[1:27:35] he says that's right in other words he
[1:27:37] says every evidence that you've got
[1:27:40] they've got
[1:27:41] and they're heathens
[1:27:43] the prophet of God went around the world
[1:27:45] seven times he's seen it all he's seen
[1:27:47] demonic power he's seen witches he's
[1:27:49] seen all of these different things and
[1:27:51] he says every evidence that you guys are
[1:27:52] claiming he says I've seen heathens do
[1:27:55] it
[1:27:55] that declare nothing of Christianity
[1:27:57] that absolutely do not have the Holy
[1:27:59] Ghost do not believe the word of God he
[1:28:01] says and they shout they speak with
[1:28:03] tongues they they see Visions they
[1:28:05] interpret they do all of these different
[1:28:06] things he says every evidence you've got
[1:28:07] they've got and yet they don't have
[1:28:09] Divine love
[1:28:10] so he said how can that be evidence he
[1:28:12] says the product is what matters the
[1:28:14] evidence is not enough
[1:28:16] evidence is he said Christ is in the
[1:28:19] heart see so don't be deceived by signs
[1:28:22] and evidences there's all kinds of signs
[1:28:25] the Bible said in the last days false
[1:28:26] prophets would rise up and show such
[1:28:28] signs it would deceive the very elective
[1:28:30] possible he says come back to the Bible
[1:28:34] signs now notice I'll give you a new
[1:28:36] spirit and I'll put my spirit notice the
[1:28:39] new heart is right in the middle of you
[1:28:40] and the new spirit is put in the middle
[1:28:41] of your new heart and his spirit is put
[1:28:43] right in the middle of the new spirit
[1:28:47] so I read all of that and the prophet is
[1:28:49] putting up a sign that's saying don't
[1:28:50] stop with the cleaned up life don't stop
[1:28:53] with speaking in tongues don't stop with
[1:28:55] having these gifts or manifestations
[1:28:56] he's saying go back to what the Bible
[1:29:00] says about what the true sign is of a
[1:29:02] holy ghost filled believer
[1:29:04] don't stop because you're not drinking
[1:29:06] anymore don't stop because you agree
[1:29:07] with the pastor those are all great
[1:29:08] things be joyful of it but we're not
[1:29:11] talking about evidences evidences he
[1:29:13] says we're talking about the product
[1:29:16] now I want to spend some time on this
[1:29:17] because here's the thing we all want to
[1:29:20] believe we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:22] we all want to believe we're right with
[1:29:24] God we all want to say we've been
[1:29:26] changed and we've had a new birth and
[1:29:27] we're real Believers that's good we
[1:29:29] ought to be able that's something we
[1:29:31] ought to want but the human condition is
[1:29:33] to seek that which confirms what we
[1:29:35] believe rather than looking at all of
[1:29:37] the evidence
[1:29:38] and brother Brown says that's the
[1:29:40] problem is you chose evidences rather
[1:29:42] than all of the evidence
[1:29:43] you're looking at one thing rather than
[1:29:45] the whole thing
[1:29:47] you're looking at one thing and saying
[1:29:48] that makes me a Christian rather than
[1:29:49] looking at everything and saying is this
[1:29:51] Christian
[1:29:52] because the goal is not to have
[1:29:53] evidences the goal is to be Christ the
[1:29:56] Hebrews 13 8 is our message amen Jesus
[1:29:59] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:30:01] forever amen
[1:30:03] so we don't want to go around trying to
[1:30:05] find evidences but we want to see Christ
[1:30:06] inside of us you know when I when I was
[1:30:09] speaking last service and I spoke about
[1:30:10] the watches and it struck me as I was
[1:30:13] just dwelling on this and studying you
[1:30:15] look at all those pieces of that watch
[1:30:18] and if you put them all together and you
[1:30:20] close that watch up and it has a
[1:30:22] see-through backing like a lot of them
[1:30:23] do or even a see-through front you'd say
[1:30:25] that watch has all of the evidence
[1:30:29] of being a watch
[1:30:31] but without the mainspring the product's
[1:30:33] no good
[1:30:34] it has every evidence
[1:30:36] but it doesn't have a power
[1:30:38] it has every part except the thing that
[1:30:42] makes it a watch
[1:30:44] a Christian has Christ
[1:30:47] not evidences
[1:30:48] and brother Brown says you've taken the
[1:30:50] evidences rather than the Christ
[1:30:52] you've taken one portion rather than the
[1:30:55] the satisfying portion which is himself
[1:30:59] ever ever you know you look at this
[1:31:01] watch
[1:31:02] and that could be sitting there and
[1:31:04] maybe you go into a into a store and
[1:31:06] it's a used watch and everything looks
[1:31:07] great
[1:31:08] and the only question you have to ask is
[1:31:10] but will it keep time
[1:31:12] because what makes it a watch is that it
[1:31:14] tells time not that it has the parts of
[1:31:17] a watch the parts of awat don't make it
[1:31:19] a watch what makes it a watch is that it
[1:31:21] can tell time and that it can tell time
[1:31:22] accurately
[1:31:24] what makes us a Christian is not that we
[1:31:26] have the parts of the Christian it's
[1:31:27] that the parts of a Christian work
[1:31:29] together to make us christ-like
[1:31:31] amen you ever drive a car I'm a car guy
[1:31:33] you ever get in a car look good on the
[1:31:36] outside it has four wheels has a
[1:31:37] steering wheel paint looks good nothing
[1:31:39] seems completely off and then you get in
[1:31:41] you turn it on you drive in it seems
[1:31:42] like all of the parts are just flying in
[1:31:44] close formation but not touching each
[1:31:45] other
[1:31:46] where the car just doesn't seem to work
[1:31:48] right
[1:31:49] where it seems like the transmission is
[1:31:50] clunky and the engine doesn't respond
[1:31:52] and you go around a corner and it just
[1:31:54] almost flops over on itself and it's
[1:31:55] shuttering in that it's got all the
[1:31:57] parts of a car but when you actually try
[1:31:59] and use it as a car it's not a good car
[1:32:02] that's the difference between evidences
[1:32:04] and product
[1:32:06] and you'll find that when you get into a
[1:32:08] bad car they're selling you on the
[1:32:09] features rather than the function
[1:32:12] and that's what he's saying he says you
[1:32:14] focused as Christians on the features of
[1:32:16] a Christian rather than your function as
[1:32:18] a Christian he says the evidences are
[1:32:20] fine but what's the product of all those
[1:32:22] evidences what is the life that's behind
[1:32:25] it what is the end result is it
[1:32:26] evidences or is it an eternal life is it
[1:32:28] reading your Bible or is it living your
[1:32:30] Bible
[1:32:31] because a Christian reads his Bible but
[1:32:33] if you don't live it then what does that
[1:32:34] make you
[1:32:36] a hypocrite for now
[1:32:37] certainly not filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:39] amen he says you've forgotten about the
[1:32:41] you you've forgotten the real goal to be
[1:32:44] Christ not to just check off a bunch of
[1:32:46] lists things on the list that say I'm a
[1:32:48] Christian the goal is not to have
[1:32:50] evidences the goal is to represent
[1:32:52] Christ to be Christ in all of these
[1:32:54] different things to have what the
[1:32:56] authority of the word acting in every
[1:32:57] part of our life that's what makes us
[1:32:59] christ-like
[1:33:00] really the evidences are supposed to
[1:33:02] come from us we're not supposed to bolt
[1:33:04] them on
[1:33:06] remember brother Brown says a sheep
[1:33:07] Bears wool it doesn't manufacture it and
[1:33:10] it doesn't add it it just doesn't the
[1:33:12] evidences are a product of Christ in US
[1:33:14] rather than a precursor
[1:33:17] it's Christ coming out of us rather than
[1:33:19] us bolting them on you see these guys
[1:33:21] again carving they go around and they
[1:33:23] got a car and they want to make it look
[1:33:24] fast what do they do put a big wing on
[1:33:26] it and they put a loud exhaust on it and
[1:33:28] you know what it makes it slower and it
[1:33:30] makes it less efficient
[1:33:31] but it looks fast and that's all they're
[1:33:33] interesting is looking fast not being
[1:33:36] fast that's the problem with evidence is
[1:33:37] it makes you look like a Christian
[1:33:39] without letting you be a Christian
[1:33:41] evidence are just gifts the prophet said
[1:33:43] and he said the heathens have them just
[1:33:45] as much as Christians do
[1:33:48] and he said every one of them could be
[1:33:50] reproduced without the holy spirit so he
[1:33:52] says they weren't definitely the right
[1:33:53] product and he says they're not even the
[1:33:54] right evidences
[1:33:55] that's why they latched on to to
[1:33:57] speaking in tongues
[1:33:59] speaking in tongues are so simple you
[1:34:01] get up there and go and they say you got
[1:34:03] the Holy Ghost and you're going in
[1:34:05] that's easy
[1:34:07] we love easy we love simple
[1:34:10] we love a quick check mark and speaking
[1:34:12] in tongues was the easiest check mark
[1:34:13] you could get because you don't even
[1:34:15] have to be able to do it you can just
[1:34:17] mimic speaking in tongues
[1:34:19] and they'll tell you now you'll know but
[1:34:21] nobody else will you can look like a
[1:34:23] Christian a holy ghost-filled Christian
[1:34:24] just because you're mimicking the way
[1:34:26] people speak in tongues they do it all
[1:34:27] the time it's easy
[1:34:29] but it's not scriptural
[1:34:32] I'm going to close with a long quote and
[1:34:35] a short quote
[1:34:39] because I want to just wrap this up the
[1:34:40] way the prophet brought it to us listen
[1:34:43] questions and answers he says this is
[1:34:45] the question they said do you believe
[1:34:46] that God gives the Holy Spirit to
[1:34:48] everyone that is truly a born-again
[1:34:50] Christian at the time they accept
[1:34:52] salvation or you do you believe that
[1:34:55] this is a different work of Grace that
[1:34:57] in the experience of most Christians
[1:34:59] comes later that's a great question
[1:35:02] he says now Christian friend a person
[1:35:04] cannot be born again until they have
[1:35:07] received the Holy Spirit period
[1:35:12] he says see you can't you are not even
[1:35:14] converted until you receive the Holy
[1:35:17] Ghost he says I'm not saying you're lost
[1:35:19] before you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:35:20] because you're not he says there is one
[1:35:23] work of Grace only one work of Grace and
[1:35:26] that's the Holy Spirit now I'm going to
[1:35:28] jump just interject another quote here
[1:35:30] because I want to make a clarification
[1:35:32] it's a big clarification because we've
[1:35:35] been talking time and time again about
[1:35:36] the difference of the working of the
[1:35:37] Holy Spirit as opposed to the indwelling
[1:35:39] or the baptism of the Holy Spirit I want
[1:35:41] to do this because brother Bradham makes
[1:35:42] a big deal of this this thought right
[1:35:44] here and I wanted to put it in in he
[1:35:46] says it better in a different place and
[1:35:48] so I wanted to inject it here before we
[1:35:50] continue with the original quote he says
[1:35:52] now then there was justification
[1:35:54] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:56] Ghost not three different dispensations
[1:35:58] not three works of Grace but one work in
[1:36:02] different manifestations
[1:36:04] he says the same Holy Spirit was with
[1:36:06] Luther under justification was under
[1:36:10] Wesley with sanctification is in the
[1:36:14] church now in the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:15] Ghost he says it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:36:17] not two Holy Spirit certainly not three
[1:36:19] it's the same Holy Spirit he's saying
[1:36:21] what happened in the previous Church
[1:36:23] Ages was the Holy Spirit working and
[1:36:26] moving and it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:36:28] that's given today but what was with
[1:36:30] them is in US
[1:36:33] there's a working and then there's an
[1:36:35] indwelling
[1:36:36] because remember Martin Luther he drank
[1:36:38] he smoked he cussed he was an
[1:36:41] anti-semite he hated Jews
[1:36:45] that wasn't a holy ghost-filled man but
[1:36:47] he had a portion
[1:36:49] he had a working that was there now
[1:36:51] brother Bram jumps right back to this he
[1:36:53] says just like there's one God and three
[1:36:55] manifestations Father Son and Holy
[1:36:57] Spirit one God he says only one now
[1:36:59] there is one work of Grace but three
[1:37:01] manifestations there's a manifestation
[1:37:03] of justification by faith a man believes
[1:37:06] God says yes sir I believe that I
[1:37:07] believe there's a true God and now for
[1:37:09] my personal savior I accept Jesus Christ
[1:37:11] his son is my personal savior now that's
[1:37:13] what's called justification by face
[1:37:15] faith which the disciples receive first
[1:37:21] see we look at the the upper room is the
[1:37:23] holy as the only work in the whole in
[1:37:25] the disciples but he says no no they
[1:37:27] received this first
[1:37:28] he says now the next thing is this man
[1:37:30] will go out and today he might Smoke
[1:37:32] Drink curse do things that it's that his
[1:37:35] habits is hanging on to him it's just
[1:37:37] rooted in there he says it's Spirits
[1:37:40] habits are spirits
[1:37:43] the Bible said they're unclean spirits
[1:37:45] in men now maybe he's lost well for
[1:37:47] instance men sometimes especially men
[1:37:49] become lustful sex maniacs and not only
[1:37:51] that but just lustful the way women
[1:37:54] dress in things today no wonder they are
[1:37:55] but the woman becomes the same way
[1:37:58] lustful Spirits get on them and they're
[1:38:00] nice little ladies and they put on short
[1:38:02] clothes and little bitty things around
[1:38:04] them that looks terrible and they get
[1:38:05] out why they don't want to be bad but
[1:38:07] they don't realize that that old passion
[1:38:10] demon spirit is working on them what's
[1:38:13] he pointing to Original Sin
[1:38:15] this is the original demon this is the
[1:38:17] original possession he says they don't
[1:38:19] do that to appear before God
[1:38:21] listen in the Bible times taking your
[1:38:23] clothes off was a sign of demon
[1:38:24] possession
[1:38:26] and today it's a sign of normalcy in the
[1:38:28] world
[1:38:29] taking your clothes off is not normal
[1:38:31] it's never been normal except under the
[1:38:34] influence of Satan he says Mary
[1:38:36] Magdalene
[1:38:39] didn't realize the spirits that was on
[1:38:40] her see
[1:38:42] well now when you get that kind of a
[1:38:44] spirit on you or men you get out there
[1:38:45] and start lusting for women you say well
[1:38:47] it's human nature he says not like that
[1:38:49] he says see no it's a spirit the Bible
[1:38:53] said it was a spirit that's right so the
[1:38:55] thing to do then the blood of Jesus
[1:38:57] cleanses you from lust and passion
[1:38:59] that's called sanctification the word
[1:39:02] sanctification means to be cleaned and
[1:39:04] set aside for service he says now that
[1:39:07] lust Spirit leaves you under
[1:39:09] sanctification
[1:39:10] because remember the house has to be
[1:39:12] cleaned out before he can come in
[1:39:16] now remember it has no power over you
[1:39:18] except you give it
[1:39:19] amen the word exposes it for what it is
[1:39:22] and then you say I want it or I don't
[1:39:25] and if you want it it stays and if you
[1:39:27] don't want it then the word will put it
[1:39:28] out and the Holy Spirit will do that
[1:39:29] work it's a working of the holy spirit
[1:39:31] in sanctification to clean you out
[1:39:35] he says let a little lady nice go to
[1:39:37] church she sings in the choir but she
[1:39:38] has to mower grass with a little pair of
[1:39:40] shorts on I know I'm not speaking to the
[1:39:41] choir here today
[1:39:43] all right but just consider this thought
[1:39:45] let her get Sanctified one time and let
[1:39:47] her put on a pair he's saying she won't
[1:39:48] do it see let that man that'll almost
[1:39:51] have a wreck looking at that woman in
[1:39:52] the yard let him get Sanctified one time
[1:39:54] and go down the street he'll keep his
[1:39:56] mind on what he's doing Sanctified not
[1:39:59] filled with the Holy Ghost sanctify will
[1:40:01] do this
[1:40:02] he says that's exactly right if he gazes
[1:40:05] sideways he'll turn his head this way
[1:40:07] the holy spirit says turn your head
[1:40:09] brother Graham would say the first look
[1:40:11] that that's okay he says but if you look
[1:40:13] again that's the problem you can't help
[1:40:15] what you see you don't know what's
[1:40:16] coming your way but if you keep looking
[1:40:18] at it that's on you
[1:40:19] he says the holy spirit says turn away
[1:40:21] now are you going to do it or are you
[1:40:23] not
[1:40:24] he says that's it that sanctification
[1:40:27] notice the Holy Spirit working with him
[1:40:29] in sanctification he does not have the
[1:40:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost and yet he's
[1:40:33] turning his head
[1:40:36] he says now in this person that's been
[1:40:39] called by God there's manifestations of
[1:40:42] gifts and he's pointing to the final
[1:40:44] work he's pointing to adoption he's
[1:40:45] pointing to the infilling of the Holy
[1:40:47] Spirit and he says you're here for a
[1:40:49] purpose and that purpose is to manifest
[1:40:50] the gift of God in your life but it's
[1:40:52] not always a gift of tongues or
[1:40:54] interpretation of these different things
[1:40:55] but there's a word that's coming out of
[1:40:57] you that God placed in there and he says
[1:40:59] that's going to come out in the end
[1:41:00] that's what the indwelling of God is
[1:41:02] supposed to do it's supposed to bring
[1:41:03] out whatever that gift is inside of you
[1:41:05] he says now a very dear friend of mine
[1:41:07] Endeavor the other day was discussing
[1:41:08] this we with me that used to be here and
[1:41:10] preach in the city very fine man as far
[1:41:12] as I know but you see he was in Nazarene
[1:41:14] he thought that sanctification was the
[1:41:16] baptism of the Holy Spirit which it is
[1:41:18] not there's no scripture to show that
[1:41:20] I'll prove that in a little bit by the
[1:41:22] Bible see that it isn't you're not
[1:41:23] sealed by sanctification you're sealed
[1:41:26] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit now
[1:41:28] listen to this a ceiling is the
[1:41:31] completing of the work
[1:41:36] a ceiling is the completing of the work
[1:41:39] we're going to get into this with
[1:41:40] adoption this is a game-changing
[1:41:42] statement a ceiling is a completing of
[1:41:46] the work
[1:41:49] so that means that it comes at the end
[1:41:51] not at the beginning
[1:41:53] you don't start with the Holy Ghost and
[1:41:55] get adopted
[1:41:56] you get the Holy Ghost as your adoption
[1:41:58] because it's a finished work it's a
[1:42:00] ceiling of something that's already done
[1:42:02] he says that's the reason it couldn't be
[1:42:03] sealed under Luther Wesley either one it
[1:42:06] had to come to the baptism before the
[1:42:07] church was sealed away till the day of
[1:42:09] redemption you see he says now oh no
[1:42:11] they're not lost they're saved certainly
[1:42:13] they are now sanctification is the same
[1:42:15] work of Grace that saved you Jesus said
[1:42:17] no man can come to me except the father
[1:42:19] draws him he says so it's the holy
[1:42:21] spirit all along
[1:42:24] but that's a portion of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:27] he says this is a greater portion of the
[1:42:30] Holy Spirit and then when you receive
[1:42:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:42:34] the completion of the Holy Spirit taking
[1:42:37] up its Abode in you to manifest with
[1:42:39] gifts speaking with tongues
[1:42:41] interpretation of tongues Gifts of power
[1:42:42] wisdom knowledge and understand and
[1:42:44] there's a lot more to that as we're
[1:42:45] going to get into it in a much much
[1:42:47] further down the road but he says the
[1:42:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:42:50] completion
[1:42:52] justification that's a portion of the
[1:42:54] working sanctification it's a portion of
[1:42:56] the workingness the holy spirit all
[1:42:57] through it he says but in the end you
[1:42:59] get the Holy Spirit rather than just it
[1:43:01] working with you
[1:43:04] see it's the holy spirit all along it's
[1:43:06] a portion absolutely why because it's
[1:43:08] the word being brought out that's what
[1:43:10] the Holy Spirit does is it's bringing
[1:43:12] out what's inside of us it's the seed of
[1:43:14] God and you coming to life and it's
[1:43:16] matching what God said it should be It's
[1:43:18] Supernatural and it's the Holy Spirit
[1:43:19] brooding over our lives creating an
[1:43:22] atmosphere for change for cleansing for
[1:43:26] accepting for surrendering
[1:43:29] all of these different things amen but
[1:43:31] the prophet reminds us of the baptism
[1:43:33] the Holy Spirit the indwelling is a seal
[1:43:35] it's a ceiling of a completed work
[1:43:39] it's a sign that everything in there has
[1:43:40] been said in order and it's been done
[1:43:42] right it's a sign that it's acceptable
[1:43:44] and it's bound for eternity
[1:43:46] now remember the sealing of the holy
[1:43:48] spirit is what in the soul because
[1:43:50] that's what's eternal
[1:43:52] that's what's Eternal it's not the body
[1:43:53] that's doing the body's still going to
[1:43:55] be a fight but amen there's a greater
[1:43:56] life than just living clean and and
[1:43:59] talking clean and attending church so
[1:44:01] the prophet's saying there's more to it
[1:44:03] than just not drinking and not smoking
[1:44:04] and coming to church he says that's not
[1:44:06] it that's good that's a portion of it
[1:44:08] but that's not the completion of it
[1:44:10] there's far more than that listen to
[1:44:12] this this is our closing our closing
[1:44:13] quote he says God intended this church
[1:44:16] to be a powerful Church
[1:44:19] a glorious Church a church that the
[1:44:22] whole world could look upon as a bride
[1:44:23] of Christ well accepted and espoused and
[1:44:26] to live in such an atmosphere and
[1:44:29] conduct itself in such a way that God
[1:44:32] will be proud of this church to present
[1:44:33] it to Christ at the coming of the Lord
[1:44:39] that's what we're supposed to look like
[1:44:43] that's to come up a little higher
[1:44:46] that's what adoption looks like
[1:44:48] he says
[1:44:50] it should live in that characteristic in
[1:44:53] the church and it should be living that
[1:44:56] way but we find out that many times that
[1:44:59] with good intentions that people are
[1:45:01] trying to make themselves act like
[1:45:03] Christians they're trying to say well I
[1:45:05] am thus and I must live this way
[1:45:09] now if the church could only not look at
[1:45:12] it in that way
[1:45:14] this can't be about a must
[1:45:16] brother Brian would say when you get the
[1:45:17] Holy Ghost your very desires have
[1:45:20] changed
[1:45:22] it's no more he says you have no more
[1:45:24] conscience of sin there's nothing in you
[1:45:25] that has a desire for sin so you don't
[1:45:27] have to force now your body that's a
[1:45:30] fight
[1:45:31] that's a fight that's always going to be
[1:45:32] a fight but in the Inner Man in the
[1:45:34] inner woman it ain't a fight it's done
[1:45:37] it's sealed hey the battle's over there
[1:45:39] the victory's been won you know what you
[1:45:41] believe
[1:45:42] and that means you'll fight to be what
[1:45:44] you believe
[1:45:45] he says God never intended Christianity
[1:45:47] to be governed by denominations neither
[1:45:50] by Creeds listen Creeds alone make us
[1:45:52] legalists
[1:45:53] that's all Creeds do is they make us
[1:45:54] legalists that's a that's when we get
[1:45:57] the I must
[1:45:58] rather than the I am
[1:46:00] because Creed say You must
[1:46:02] whereas Christ in US says I am
[1:46:06] that's Hebrews 13 8. God only allowed or
[1:46:09] intended for the church to be governed
[1:46:10] and carried on by Creeds and denominate
[1:46:12] Nations and intellectuals he says then
[1:46:14] we do not need the holy spirit in the
[1:46:16] church it's success would largely be
[1:46:18] largely placed upon the intellectuals of
[1:46:20] the best of us then what would be our
[1:46:22] church would have he says that will be
[1:46:24] what our church would have the better
[1:46:26] intellectuals we would have in our
[1:46:27] church the more Progressive our church
[1:46:29] would be and guess what that's that's
[1:46:30] what the world has today
[1:46:32] I'm not convinced they're intellectuals
[1:46:34] but they look for the greatest of this
[1:46:36] and the greatest of that and none of
[1:46:37] them are looking for the actual Holy
[1:46:38] Spirit they're not looking for Christ
[1:46:40] himself living through a man
[1:46:43] they're just picking the best one the
[1:46:45] one that has the greatest Vision the
[1:46:46] greatest programs the greatest speaking
[1:46:47] ability the best looks the best
[1:46:49] combination of all of those things
[1:46:50] ideally he says that's not the way it's
[1:46:52] meant to be he says but in the word in
[1:46:56] the word I find that God did not intend
[1:46:58] for the church to be governed by
[1:47:00] intellectual or by any Theology of man
[1:47:02] but the Holy Spirit was given to the
[1:47:05] church to govern and control the body of
[1:47:08] Christ and I think in doing that with
[1:47:11] that in mind and in God's program we
[1:47:13] will never be successful no matter how
[1:47:15] good our intentions are until we get
[1:47:18] back into the center of God's program
[1:47:19] where the Holy Spirit controls
[1:47:23] amen God bless you let's stand this
[1:47:25] evening what is it
[1:47:27] he's saying we need to get back to the
[1:47:28] original word
[1:47:30] we need to get back to the original life
[1:47:32] we need to get back to the original
[1:47:33] Power he says we need to get back to our
[1:47:36] eating condition where we walk with God
[1:47:38] and we talk with God and we're in that
[1:47:41] Eternal relationship with him he says
[1:47:43] what we ought to be he says we ought to
[1:47:46] be walking in it our characteristic
[1:47:48] ought to be that we're walking with God
[1:47:50] walking according to the word amen
[1:47:52] amen I hope you know preaching things
[1:47:56] like this and
[1:47:59] maybe there's some of us are saying you
[1:48:01] know what I'm not as far ahead as I
[1:48:03] thought and that's not an easy thing to
[1:48:04] hear sometimes
[1:48:06] but the idea is like I said
[1:48:08] are you moving
[1:48:09] or are you standing still
[1:48:11] as long as you're moving thank God for
[1:48:14] it and keep moving amen but the point of
[1:48:16] this is is we've got to get to a place
[1:48:18] where we know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:48:21] that we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:48:22] that that's the game changer brother
[1:48:24] Brown says that's what makes the
[1:48:25] difference when you have it and when you
[1:48:28] know you've got it
[1:48:30] because when you know you've got it then
[1:48:32] there's things that he can do with you
[1:48:33] in ways that he can use you that he's
[1:48:35] never been able to do before amen but
[1:48:37] we've got to go through the process
[1:48:38] there's no jumping there's no skipping
[1:48:40] you know what we look in scriptures and
[1:48:42] this is one of the the the the hard
[1:48:44] points of scriptures that we look at it
[1:48:46] and we see and scripture doesn't record
[1:48:48] the day to day
[1:48:50] it records the highs and it records the
[1:48:52] lows
[1:48:53] but it doesn't say that brother Joshua
[1:48:55] went to work for three years
[1:48:58] and then you know what it does in some
[1:49:00] cases it says that that's that Samson
[1:49:02] ruled for 20 years and judged and then
[1:49:06] we hear all of the bad stuff he did and
[1:49:07] then we hear the mighty Victory we only
[1:49:09] hear the high points and the low points
[1:49:11] and we think that our life has to be
[1:49:13] high points all the time no no no no
[1:49:17] brother bam talked about that humble
[1:49:18] Victorious Christian walk
[1:49:21] we ain't all walking around raising the
[1:49:23] dead day in and day out if we did that
[1:49:25] the world would know who we were
[1:49:27] and this church would be full
[1:49:29] and we'd have to put the old pews back
[1:49:30] and we'd probably have to get a newer
[1:49:31] building a bigger building
[1:49:34] that's not what it's about but see we
[1:49:36] think that this adoption is going to
[1:49:38] make us walk around doing Mighty works
[1:49:39] all the time no no no you'll see that he
[1:49:42] wants you doing right what you're doing
[1:49:43] right where you are but you'll be
[1:49:45] anointed to do it and you'll know you're
[1:49:48] anointed to do it and when you know
[1:49:49] you're anointed to do it you'll do it
[1:49:51] differently
[1:49:52] and you'll realize what's given to you
[1:49:54] in everything that you're doing because
[1:49:56] you've been positionally placed by
[1:49:58] Christ to be right where you are doing
[1:49:59] right where you are whether it's a
[1:50:01] housewife at home whether it's a a young
[1:50:04] sister at work whether it's a father at
[1:50:06] work whether it's a minister Deacon
[1:50:07] whatever it is when you're positionally
[1:50:09] placed there and you're anointed to do
[1:50:10] it it's a game changer and you realize
[1:50:13] that you've got Authority in every one
[1:50:15] of those places that God has put you to
[1:50:17] what use the word to produce the Kingdom
[1:50:20] Purpose that he's placed inside of you
