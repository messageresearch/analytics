[41:24] The
[41:25] potter's hand.
[41:30] Yes, Lord. Lord, surely that's our
[41:33] desire, our prayer, our confession,
[41:36] Lord, this evening is that we desire to
[41:37] be led by your spirit, Lord, to let it
[41:40] do the work, Lord. Let it change us. Let
[41:43] it lead us. Let it guide us. Let it mold
[41:45] us, Lord. Let it show us your perfect
[41:48] will and your way in our life, each one.
[41:50] Heavenly Father, Lord, what a perfect
[41:52] song to start the service off with this
[41:54] evening, the start the preaching of the
[41:56] word. Lord, we pray you'd just be with
[41:58] us now, Lord. continue, Lord, to speak,
[42:00] to minister to our lives, Lord. Open up
[42:03] our hearts, Lord. Show us things we
[42:04] haven't seen before, Lord. May you just
[42:07] do a changing work in us this evening.
[42:09] Heavenly Father, each one, Lord.
[42:11] Minister now we pray, Lord, remembering
[42:13] those that aren't here, Lord. Those that
[42:14] are sick in the hospital, Lord, praying
[42:16] a special grace to them, each one. In
[42:19] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[42:22] Amen. God bless you. Turn to Romans 14
[42:24] if you
[42:25] would. Amen. Beautiful day. Nice to have
[42:28] some sunshine and not much wind.
[42:30] Certainly enjoyed it. Thank the Lord for
[42:32] it. Good to see the Collins back again.
[42:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Glad you got back
[42:36] safely. You left and we got snow. I
[42:39] don't know how that works, but we're
[42:41] glad that uh it's gone now and trusting
[42:43] that we won't have any more for the rest
[42:45] of the spring and summer season. Amen.
[42:47] Want to definitely remember brother
[42:48] Gourd Snow. Brother Matt came and told
[42:50] me about it just before I came to the
[42:51] pulpit here. We want to remember him and
[42:54] uh we'll we'll see about visiting. He's
[42:56] asked brother Matt to confirm with him
[42:58] before anyone goes to visit. So, please
[43:00] check in with Brother Matt and I'm sure
[43:01] the deacons will perhaps send a note out
[43:03] as we get some direction on that. But
[43:05] remember him and Sister Eileen as he
[43:07] goes in for open heart surgery on
[43:08] Friday, Lord willing. Amen. Romans
[43:11] chapter 14 and verse 17 says this, "For
[43:14] the kingdom of God is not meat and
[43:16] drink, but righteousness and peace and
[43:19] joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in
[43:22] these things serveth Christ is
[43:23] acceptable to God and approved of men.
[43:26] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[43:28] seats this evening. And we're going to
[43:30] continue this thought we've been
[43:31] preaching on on uh no room for fear. And
[43:34] I'm going to take a a third service on
[43:36] on this idea of of standards. And we
[43:39] talked last service about sacred cows
[43:41] and these things where we have personal
[43:43] standards and we preach or enforce or we
[43:45] we require certain things on on not just
[43:48] in our own lives, but we take it and we
[43:50] we try and get other people to do it.
[43:51] And oftentimes with the absolute best of
[43:53] intentions uh sometimes to keep somebody
[43:55] safe, keep them from what we think would
[43:58] be a bad decision or something like
[43:59] that. But we're never called in
[44:00] scripture to enforce those things if
[44:02] it's not a word standard. And that's why
[44:04] we call them sacred cows. They're not
[44:06] there because they're in the word. Amen.
[44:07] If it was a word, it would be a word
[44:09] standard. But we'll see as we go through
[44:11] this that it's okay to hold those
[44:12] beliefs. You have beliefs. That's
[44:14] wonderful. It's okay to hold them. And
[44:16] I'm not telling you not to hold them.
[44:18] I'm saying be careful how you push them
[44:20] on other people. Be careful how you you
[44:22] present them to other people. Amen.
[44:24] Because what's wrong with forcing is
[44:26] that you don't let the spirit do the
[44:27] work. That's what happens there. Amen.
[44:29] Is that what we're looking for is not a
[44:32] a a personal conviction. We're looking
[44:33] for a word answer. Because if you have a
[44:35] word answer, then the Holy Spirit will
[44:37] enforce a word answer because the Holy
[44:39] Spirit's there to bring us into all
[44:40] truth. It's to bring us into the word.
[44:42] It's to bring us to manifest the word of
[44:44] God. And that's a work of the spirit.
[44:46] It's not the work of laws and dos and
[44:47] don'ts and rules and regulations and
[44:49] personal standards as those may be.
[44:51] Amen. But the problem with a a word
[44:54] standard enforced by the spirit is that
[44:55] it's in God's timing, not in my timing.
[44:58] It's not in your timing. And so often
[44:59] that can be a frustration, especially if
[45:01] you see somebody doing something you
[45:03] think is going to cause them pain or
[45:05] suffering or or issues sometimes very
[45:07] quickly and you just want to get in
[45:08] there and say, "Don't do it." All the
[45:10] parents smiled at me just then cuz
[45:12] that's the way we treat our kids. But we
[45:14] have to at some point let them go and
[45:17] when it comes to others in the
[45:18] congregation that we can only go so far
[45:20] because we're God's children, not each
[45:21] other's children. And we can't always
[45:23] treat each other that way though we
[45:24] might like to. There's a time for blind
[45:26] obedience and that time is when you have
[45:28] children in your home. That's where
[45:29] you're teaching them blind obedience.
[45:31] Listen, when when my kids are one and
[45:32] two and three and four, when I say do
[45:34] it, they better do it because you're
[45:36] teaching them to keep them safe. You're
[45:38] teaching there to protect them. And so,
[45:40] they have to learn to obey very quickly
[45:42] because it could be a matter of life and
[45:43] death sometimes. But as they grow older,
[45:46] what do we start to do? We start to
[45:48] teach them why. We start to give them
[45:50] understanding now to go with their
[45:52] obedience so that they can come to a
[45:54] place where they start to do it by
[45:55] choice and understanding rather than
[45:57] just because mama or dada has a standard
[46:00] in the house and these different things.
[46:02] So therefore, as we raise our kids, we
[46:04] ought to have a word principle or a word
[46:05] standard for everything we do.
[46:08] Everything. We're Christians. We live by
[46:09] the word. Amen. We live by the word. We
[46:11] ought to have a word standard or
[46:13] principle for these things. But
[46:14] remember, I'm saying principle because
[46:16] the scripture doesn't talk about
[46:17] everything. You won't find Facebook in
[46:19] the Bible. You won't find Instagram in
[46:21] the Bible. You won't find motorcycles in
[46:23] the
[46:24] Bible. You won't find any of these
[46:26] things there. So, you've got to go to a
[46:27] word principle rather than a scripture
[46:30] that that that maybe deals with those
[46:31] things specifically because why do we
[46:34] usually take an absolute stance on
[46:35] things? It's because we see what's
[46:37] coming down the road so many times. And
[46:39] so, we say, "I see where that's probably
[46:41] going to go and so I'm not going to
[46:43] start it at the beginning." And that's a
[46:44] wise thing to do. But the thing is, it
[46:47] can often be a personal thing for us,
[46:48] not something that's universal to
[46:50] everybody else. If we look at something
[46:51] that's not producing the word, if it's
[46:53] not producing the fruit of the spirit,
[46:54] we ought to say, "I don't want anything
[46:56] to do with that." But that's a personal
[46:58] choice, and that's between us and God.
[46:59] Amen. When we look at why people do it,
[47:02] and if that's something that ought to be
[47:04] satisfied by our relationship in Christ,
[47:05] the question becomes, why would I ever
[47:07] do that in the first place? If we're
[47:09] looking for peace, guess what? Alcohol
[47:12] will never be the answer. Weed will
[47:14] never be the answer. Uh relationships
[47:17] outside of marriage won't be the answer.
[47:19] None of those things are going to do it.
[47:21] If it's got to be satisfied in Christ,
[47:22] you can't look outside of Christ the
[47:24] word to get it. And therefore, we've got
[47:26] to look at these different things. Amen.
[47:27] But see, so how so many times what
[47:29] happens is we're looking at the thing or
[47:31] we're looking at the habit or the event
[47:33] and we don't ask the question, which is
[47:35] why am I looking for this in the first
[47:37] place? See, so often we're focused on is
[47:40] this right or wrong? And that's not the
[47:42] question we should be answering. The
[47:43] question we should be asking ourselves
[47:45] is why am I asking and who is leading me
[47:48] to ask this or what is driving this sort
[47:50] of thing? You we can take something as
[47:53] simple as drinking alcohol. We we drink
[47:55] wine for communion. Therefore, wine in
[47:58] and of itself cannot be wrong because we
[48:00] drink it. You say we're drinking it in a
[48:02] religious observation of some sort.
[48:04] Doesn't matter. If it was wrong, it'd be
[48:06] wrong. But in context, it's right. But
[48:10] when you look at the origin of wine, the
[48:12] first time wine was created was by Noah.
[48:14] And if you look at the results of wine,
[48:16] you'd say you probably shouldn't have
[48:17] wine in your life. Go read it sometime.
[48:20] The results of Noah's uh producing wine
[48:23] for the first time was he got drunk and
[48:25] some really bad things happened and
[48:27] curses came out of it. Amen. Why do most
[48:29] people in North America drink? To loosen
[48:32] up, to relax, to lower inhibition.
[48:36] Church, I'm not preaching we should
[48:37] drink tonight. Brother Brown says, "If
[48:39] you've had a real experience for Christ,
[48:40] you will not drink alcohol." I believe
[48:43] that. But the thing is, why do people go
[48:45] to alcohol? They go for a release. They
[48:48] go to lower their inhibitions. They go
[48:50] to change themselves. Many times, why
[48:52] would you, as a believer, ever want to
[48:54] change yourself temporarily and
[48:57] uncontrollably? There's nothing there
[48:59] for the believer. So, why would you say
[49:01] wine is okay? What are you looking for
[49:04] out of that thing? That's the question
[49:06] we need to be asking. Amen. Listen, we
[49:09] look at the end result of that and we
[49:10] ought to say, "That's not for me."
[49:12] Because listen, there is no way. There
[49:13] is no half drunk. You're either in or
[49:16] you're out. You're either drunk or
[49:17] you're not drunk. And the line between
[49:19] that varies from every person. And you
[49:21] don't know when you've gone too far. And
[49:23] so, you are now out of your senses.
[49:25] You're out of your control. And that is
[49:27] never a state that a believer is
[49:29] supposed to be in. We're supposed to be
[49:30] aware. We're supposed to be vigilant.
[49:32] We're supposed to be in the battle day
[49:34] in and day out. And that means we've got
[49:36] to have our senses around us. The
[49:38] scripture says our body is a temple for
[49:39] the Holy Ghost. And that means we need
[49:42] to have it under submission at all
[49:44] times. And when we take something that
[49:46] takes away our ability to control that
[49:48] body, that's going to lead us down a
[49:50] path of pain. It's never going to be in
[49:51] the will of God to do that. Paul said,
[49:53] "Be vigilant." Satan's going around like
[49:55] a roaring lion seeking who he may
[49:57] devour. And I want to focus on that a
[49:59] little bit because I've spent two
[50:00] services telling you you don't have to
[50:02] abide by somebody else's personal
[50:04] convictions. But does that mean we don't
[50:06] have personal convictions? Does that
[50:08] mean we don't support them? Does that
[50:09] mean we don't have standards? Absolutely
[50:11] we do. Absolutely we do in these things.
[50:14] Amen. But I don't want to preach we
[50:15] don't have a standard at all. But we
[50:17] have to get a word standard. That's what
[50:19] we're looking for in all these things. I
[50:21] find we're really good at stopping the
[50:23] big things.
[50:25] But we ought to be good at stopping the
[50:27] big things. If if I was to come over to
[50:29] your house tomorrow with a six-ack of
[50:31] beer, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get
[50:33] past the front door with that. We're
[50:35] good at stopping the big
[50:37] things. If I was to bring uh somebody
[50:40] over that's half-dressed and say, "This
[50:41] is my friend. We want to come in and
[50:42] talk to you." You'd say, "Brother John,
[50:44] one, that shouldn't be your you
[50:46] shouldn't be in your in in in that kind
[50:48] of condition with that kind of a person.
[50:49] Two, why don't we let him get some
[50:51] clothes on before we bring him in the
[50:52] house? We're going to hold a personal
[50:54] standard for our homes. Amen. So, we
[50:57] aren't throwing those things away, but
[50:59] it's the big things that we get, but but
[51:02] but to to to come down to where we want
[51:05] to catch where this thing really is and
[51:07] what it really does, that takes
[51:08] discernment. Remember, Brother Brand,
[51:10] brother Barry read that that quote from
[51:12] Spurgeon where he said, "Disern is not
[51:14] the ability to know right and wrong, but
[51:16] nearly right and right." And nearly
[51:18] right is where you need the discernment.
[51:20] And so often when it comes to personal
[51:22] standards, it's often the difference is
[51:24] that somebody has discernment to see
[51:26] where it can go. And the other one may
[51:27] not have that yet. Not always, but
[51:30] sometimes that's it. Okay? We have to be
[51:33] able to look down the road and see
[51:34] what's going to be the probable impact
[51:36] of these things because Satan is a
[51:38] master of deception. He's a master of
[51:40] seduction. Amen. He knows how to play on
[51:42] our flesh. He knows how to play on our
[51:44] ego. He knows how to play on our need to
[51:46] relax. those little guilty pleasures
[51:49] that we have. Listen, it can just be
[51:51] chocolate. Amen. A bag of chips and
[51:57] pop. I said that for Sister Morin
[52:00] because I never believed that that would
[52:01] be her guilty pleasure. Looking to her,
[52:02] you'd never say chips and pop. Clearly,
[52:04] it has no power over
[52:07] her. Amen. But we have these things that
[52:10] can be they can start out so little and
[52:13] then all of a sudden they balloon into
[52:15] your life and you're having all sorts of
[52:17] issues, all sorts of trouble. Your
[52:18] time's gone, your energy's gone, your
[52:20] family's failing, your relationships are
[52:22] struggling, and you're saying, "What
[52:24] happened?" And and I guarantee you, you
[52:25] can usually look and find one thing that
[52:27] came in small and it grew up into
[52:29] something really big.
[52:31] Amen. Think about it. You take a polar
[52:34] bear, a polar bear uh uh cub into your
[52:37] house. He's real cute and cuddly when he
[52:39] first comes out, isn't he? You let that
[52:41] polar girl grow up in your house, what's
[52:43] going to happen? See, he's cute and
[52:44] cuddly when he comes in. And that's the
[52:46] way Satan brings it in. Cute and cuddly.
[52:48] Have a dog sometime. That's why they're
[52:50] cute and cuddly is so that you don't
[52:52] kill them in the first week for all the
[52:54] messes they make in your house and the
[52:55] things that they chew up over their life
[52:57] and these different things. Satan brings
[52:59] it in nice and appealing to the senses,
[53:01] to the flesh. He makes it appear
[53:03] harmless and then next thing you know
[53:05] you got problems and you can't find the
[53:07] place where it came in. It came in cute
[53:09] and cuddly. It came in under the radar
[53:11] of our discernment. Brother Bram says it
[53:13] this way. He says, "Satan is very
[53:14] subtle." See, and he does it so easy. So
[53:18] subtle. Just a little teeny bit here and
[53:21] a little bit there and then you let it.
[53:23] He says he's got plenty of time. So he
[53:26] just runs a little bit in here and a
[53:27] little bit in here. And the first thing
[53:29] you know, the people are just gradually
[53:31] moved into it. See, he doesn't come in
[53:34] bold as brass. He comes in sly, slick,
[53:38] just a little bit at a time. Remember, I
[53:40] remember the first camp we had while I
[53:41] was here, and I think it was Brother Joe
[53:42] talked about finger holds and tow holds
[53:44] turning into strongholds. That's the way
[53:47] Satan does it. He says, "What would have
[53:49] happened of a woman back when I was a
[53:51] boy, 16 years old, if she'd have walked
[53:53] down the street like she does today in
[53:54] this stripped tease form? Why they'd
[53:56] have had her in jail?" He says, "If it
[53:58] was wrong then, it's wrong now." But you
[54:00] see, Satan just began to cut off the
[54:02] skirts and lower them down, and it'll
[54:04] come to pass that there's somebody will
[54:06] design one that's a little beyond the
[54:08] bikini to a fig leaf. He says, "You
[54:10] remember?" And it's practically there
[54:12] now, church. We are so far beyond this.
[54:14] You look at celebrities today, they are
[54:16] wearing body hugging, they're wearing
[54:18] nothing, and they're wearing see-through
[54:20] at the same time. It's way beyond this
[54:23] fig leaf. We die for a fig leaf in those
[54:25] things. It's amazing. It's nasty. It has
[54:29] gone beyond moral conscience. They are
[54:32] completely insane. Their conscience has
[54:34] been seared with a hot iron. That's
[54:36] celebrities. But you just walk down the
[54:38] street and every woman's got tight pants
[54:39] on. Those silly yoga pants. And the tops
[54:42] are getting tighter and smaller and and
[54:44] more and more revealing. What is it? It
[54:47] came in bit by bit. They would they
[54:49] would just go one step beyond what was
[54:52] acceptable. And then once people got
[54:54] used to that, they go another step and
[54:55] another step and another step. If
[54:57] Brother Brandham called that a strip
[54:58] tease in 1963, what would he say in
[55:01] 2025? It's sick. It's gone beyond it.
[55:04] It's gone into insanity.
[55:05] Amen. What am I trying to say? What's
[55:08] Paul trying to say? Try the
[55:11] spirits. Look further down the road than
[55:14] how it feels today about what you want
[55:16] today. That's how we get that's how we
[55:19] have a 70% obesity problem in North
[55:21] America is that we look at what we want
[55:23] now rather than what we want down the
[55:24] road and we make a decision that hurts
[55:27] us in a severe way. That's why we need a
[55:29] word standard because the word reveals
[55:32] the truth. It'll show you things to
[55:34] come. It'll show you what's beyond that
[55:37] single decision you're going to make if
[55:39] you'll take it to God and be prayerful
[55:40] about these things. Listen, there's some
[55:44] things you can do that I can keep in
[55:45] balance and there's some things you do I
[55:46] can't keep in balance in both ways. And
[55:48] we've got to be able to go to God and
[55:49] ask him to lead us and guide us into
[55:51] those things. He would say in first
[55:54] John, he says, "Beloved, do not put
[55:55] faith in every spirit, but try test the
[55:58] spirits to discover whether they proceed
[56:00] from God. For many false prophets have
[56:03] gone forth into the world. Try the
[56:04] spirits doesn't mean give it a shot and
[56:06] see how it goes.
[56:08] No, it means test it, check it out,
[56:11] prove it, let it prove itself before you
[56:14] take it on. Nobody's in a rush, church.
[56:18] Nobody's in a rush to try new things. We
[56:20] ought not to be as believers. If
[56:22] something's new, if something's
[56:23] different, if you've never done this
[56:24] before, there's no reason to rush into
[56:26] it now. If you've gotten along with it
[56:28] so far, you're okay to do it for another
[56:29] little while. Wait and see what it does
[56:31] for that person before you ever step
[56:33] into it. But there's more to this and
[56:36] we'll see this as we go through. Paul
[56:38] says there's false prophets have gone
[56:40] forth. Now Paul was dealing with false
[56:42] ministers, pretended brothers, men
[56:44] seeking influence, men looking for
[56:46] money. But you don't have to be a a a a
[56:48] minister to be a false prophet because
[56:50] we have people constantly around us that
[56:52] are preaching things. They're preaching
[56:54] lifestyles. They're preaching their
[56:56] liberty. Hey, we've all had it. Somebody
[56:58] comes up and says, "Hey, you want to do
[56:59] this?" And you say, "Man, I never do
[57:00] that. Oh man, I've got liberty. That
[57:02] doesn't bother me at all." And what do
[57:04] they do? They preach to you their
[57:06] liberty in Christ, trying to get you to
[57:08] do what they do. And your conscience
[57:11] says, "No way." Hopefully, you've got a
[57:13] word answer for it. But they're
[57:15] preaching, they're preaching to you
[57:17] something that they're convinced of, and
[57:18] so they come to you and try and get you
[57:20] to do it. Because the more people they
[57:21] can get to do it, the more they're
[57:23] convinced that it's okay. The hardest
[57:26] thing to do, church, is stand by
[57:27] yourself. And I'll tell you this, as a
[57:29] believer, you're going to have to stand
[57:31] on your own two feet with your own
[57:33] convictions and say, "This is where I'm
[57:35] at." And it's okay if nobody else agrees
[57:37] with me. Though none go with me, still
[57:40] I'll
[57:41] follow. Me and Jesus got our own thing
[57:44] going. We've got to have that courage to
[57:46] stand and do that. Amen. And if you give
[57:48] people like that enough time, it'll show
[57:50] where the true inspiration was between
[57:52] behind what they did. Talking with some
[57:54] brothers after the last couple of
[57:56] services, and that's what they say.
[57:57] People come in, they tell you certain
[57:58] things, tell you to do certain things,
[58:00] tell you to not do certain things. And
[58:01] after a while, they go back and those
[58:04] men had gone off into the world. They'd
[58:06] left the Lord, and they realized that
[58:08] the dos and don'ts that they were
[58:09] preaching had nothing to do with the
[58:10] word of God. And so, some of us went
[58:13] back and we brought things back in
[58:14] because there was nothing wrong with it.
[58:15] We were just in obedience because those
[58:17] people we thought knew more than we did.
[58:20] But the end result was that those people
[58:21] fell off. So clearly, it wasn't that
[58:24] that was holding them. Nothing was
[58:26] holding them. That's for sure. I preach
[58:29] that we have to have a word standard,
[58:30] but that means we have to have a full
[58:33] word standard. And so often we'll find
[58:35] is what we're doing is we're going in to
[58:37] try and find
[58:39] permission. We're trying to find
[58:41] something that says yes, you can do it.
[58:43] And I'll tell you this, we're really
[58:44] good at reading our Bibles and reading
[58:46] the message to find things we
[58:48] want. But the spirit of truth will take
[58:50] you into all the truth. Brother Brand
[58:52] said, "The Holy Spirit will tell the
[58:54] truth on you." So, he'll take you to the
[58:57] full truth if you're willing to keep
[58:58] looking. If you're willing to wait, if
[59:00] you're willing to take your time on
[59:02] these things. Amen. Can I ask it? Let me
[59:04] look at it this way. The question we
[59:07] don't need to ask is, is this right or
[59:09] wrong? The question we need to ask is,
[59:12] who is leading me into
[59:14] this? Why am I going in this direction
[59:17] in the first place? Because the question
[59:19] is, are we seeking permission or are we
[59:22] seeking direction?
[59:25] Scripture says that sons of God are
[59:29] led. That means we are seeking
[59:31] direction, church, not just permission.
[59:34] Because you go looking for yeses and nos
[59:36] in terms of things, you'll find anything
[59:38] you want. You'll find anything you want.
[59:41] But if you go and say, "Lord, what is
[59:43] your will? What is your direction? What
[59:45] would you have me do?" That's a
[59:46] completely different prayer than right
[59:48] than than dos and don'ts and right and
[59:50] wrong. because we can go into there and
[59:52] we'll we can say I have a right to do
[59:55] this. Remember what Balam did. Balam
[59:58] after he got direction went and sought
[59:59] permission. And we saw how that turned
[1:00:01] out. And in his permission, he went
[1:00:04] against his direction cuz God said, "If
[1:00:06] they're still here in the morning, you
[1:00:08] can go with them." And when he got up in
[1:00:09] the morning, they weren't there. And he
[1:00:10] still chased after them. Why? Because
[1:00:12] there was an issue in his heart that was
[1:00:13] seeking permission rather than
[1:00:15] leadership. There was a problem on the
[1:00:17] inside. Look at what Paul said. because
[1:00:20] he talked about the ways of life that we
[1:00:22] deal with in Corinthians. And you look
[1:00:24] at the Corinthians, Corinthians were a
[1:00:25] rugged bunch. The Corinthians were those
[1:00:27] kinds of people that they couldn't show
[1:00:29] you pictures of their life before they
[1:00:30] came to the Lord because it would shock
[1:00:32] you. They were the worst of the worst.
[1:00:35] The Corinthians were raw seed, as
[1:00:38] brother Mark likes to say. They were
[1:00:40] rough. Listen, they were thieves. They
[1:00:42] were drunkards. They were revilers. They
[1:00:44] were extortioners. They were
[1:00:46] fornicators. They were homosexuals.
[1:00:51] These were rough
[1:00:54] people. What cleaned them up, church?
[1:00:57] Church standards, dos and don'ts. Listen
[1:01:01] to what Paul said. He says, "And such
[1:01:03] were some of you. But you are
[1:01:07] washed." What washes us, church? The
[1:01:11] word. You are sanctified. What
[1:01:14] sanctifies us? The word and the blood.
[1:01:18] He says, "And you are justified in the
[1:01:21] name of the Lord and by the spirit of
[1:01:26] our God." What is it that got them from
[1:01:29] being fornicators, homosexuals,
[1:01:32] extortionists, drunkards? It wasn't a
[1:01:34] church standard. It was a supernatural
[1:01:37] birth by the Holy Spirit. That's what
[1:01:40] got them into sons and daughters of God.
[1:01:43] And even with all their problems,
[1:01:45] church, they were sons and daughters of
[1:01:48] God. He says, now Paul says this, okay,
[1:01:51] now Paul's talking about life in
[1:01:53] general. Here, all things are lawful
[1:01:55] unto me, but all things are not
[1:01:57] expedient. All things are lawful for me,
[1:02:00] but I will not be brought under the
[1:02:02] power of anything of any. Paul's talking
[1:02:05] about all aspects of life. Now, those
[1:02:07] things that are not forbidden of
[1:02:09] scripture, he says, if it's not
[1:02:10] forbidden in scripture, anything's
[1:02:12] lawful. anything goes. But then he says,
[1:02:15] "But not all things are." It says down
[1:02:17] there, "Not everything is
[1:02:20] helpful. Everything's lawful." He says,
[1:02:22] "But I won't be controlled by anything."
[1:02:26] So Paul's saying these, he's speaking
[1:02:28] about areas where the scripture is
[1:02:29] silent or where the scripture is gray.
[1:02:33] And there are places where scripture is
[1:02:34] silent and there are places where
[1:02:35] scripture is gray, church. We have to
[1:02:37] accept that. And so he's talking now
[1:02:39] about areas of personal
[1:02:42] conviction. And so this is relating to
[1:02:44] now a personal relationship with Christ
[1:02:46] to determine what you're going to do
[1:02:48] with your life. He says what know ye not
[1:02:52] that your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:02:54] Ghost which is in you which ye have of
[1:02:56] God and ye are not your own. So that
[1:03:00] means I'm not here to look around and
[1:03:02] what am I allowed to do and what am I
[1:03:03] not allowed to do. He says for you are
[1:03:06] bought with a price. Therefore glorify
[1:03:09] God in your body and in your spirit
[1:03:13] which are gods. Amen. You are his and
[1:03:16] therefore your purpose now is not to say
[1:03:18] what can I do and what can I not do but
[1:03:21] the purpose of our life is to glorify
[1:03:24] God. So I find this church and we'll get
[1:03:27] into this maybe a little more as we get
[1:03:29] deeper into this service. When your
[1:03:31] focus is to glorify God, you have a lot
[1:03:33] less time for dos and don'ts and what am
[1:03:35] I allowed to do with my life? Because
[1:03:38] your purpose is now focused on one thing
[1:03:40] and that's to glorify God. And so we
[1:03:43] come back now into why do we have a
[1:03:45] standard or why are we seeking liberty
[1:03:47] and the question becomes what is the
[1:03:49] influence? Who is it that is behind this
[1:03:52] change that I'm trying to bring into my
[1:03:53] life? Either to take something out or to
[1:03:56] add something in. What spirit is driving
[1:03:59] this? And where is it taking me? Is it
[1:04:01] taking me to glorify God? Or is it
[1:04:03] taking me someplace else? Like I said
[1:04:05] before, I have a really hard time
[1:04:07] believing that the spirit's giving you
[1:04:08] liberty to shorten your skirt, sisters,
[1:04:10] because it's taking you away from
[1:04:12] modesty. Why would he ever do that? I
[1:04:15] don't believe that's the spirit that
[1:04:16] does it. Tighter clothes. I'm sorry. I
[1:04:18] don't believe that's the liberty of the
[1:04:19] spirit. Because it's taking you away
[1:04:21] from what he wants you to be. But people
[1:04:24] say, "Well, I don't have a standard."
[1:04:25] Yes, but what is the spirit doing to
[1:04:27] change you? because you'll walk closer
[1:04:30] to God as the spirit leads you, not
[1:04:31] closer to the standard of the world
[1:04:33] every single time. Paul says, "Seek to
[1:04:36] glorify God with your life." And that
[1:04:38] puts a completely different angle now on
[1:04:40] standards, on dos and don'ts, about what
[1:04:42] we can and what we can't do. Because now
[1:04:44] our motive and our objective start to
[1:04:46] play in. It's not just about right and
[1:04:48] wrong. I'm going to make this as
[1:04:50] complicated as I can tonight. You are
[1:04:52] now we start adding motive and
[1:04:54] objective. And I'll tell you this, it
[1:04:55] matters. Motive and objective matters a
[1:04:57] whole lot. Listen, if something's
[1:05:01] right, that's good. If something's
[1:05:04] wrong, it's wrong. No matter what motive
[1:05:06] or objective, church, if it's wrong,
[1:05:08] it's wrong. If it's wrong, it's wrong.
[1:05:10] Nothing you can say about the reason
[1:05:12] you're doing it is going to change the
[1:05:13] fact it's wrong. But if it's right, now
[1:05:16] motive and and objective come in behind
[1:05:18] it. Because you can take a right thing
[1:05:20] and make it wrong with motive, with
[1:05:23] objective or the play, the priority you
[1:05:26] give it in your own life. It can be
[1:05:28] right in its purpose and in its place,
[1:05:30] but if you elevate it above where it's
[1:05:32] supposed to be, you'll make it wrong.
[1:05:34] Can I give you an example so you can
[1:05:36] understand what I'm talking about? The
[1:05:38] scripture says that a man is required to
[1:05:41] work to provide for his family. It is a
[1:05:44] requirement for men to
[1:05:46] work. Paul said if a man doesn't provide
[1:05:48] for his family, he's worse than an
[1:05:50] infidel.
[1:05:51] And in the that the old church, in the
[1:05:53] Old Testament church, those that refused
[1:05:55] to work were not allowed to benefit from
[1:05:58] the church itself in terms of financial
[1:06:00] support or help. You had to take care of
[1:06:02] your family. And from Genesis, God has
[1:06:05] declared the man is to support his
[1:06:07] family. So that is a word requirement.
[1:06:10] Is it right for a man to work? By the
[1:06:13] word, it is a word requirement. It is
[1:06:15] not only a right, it is a requirement.
[1:06:18] But what happens now if a man starts to
[1:06:20] work so much that he starts to miss
[1:06:23] church? Because he's got a word
[1:06:25] requirement to provide for his family,
[1:06:27] but he's also got a word requirement to
[1:06:29] come and be a part of the body of
[1:06:30] believers to hear the preaching of the
[1:06:32] word and to assemble hims together with
[1:06:34] the local
[1:06:35] body. Because what happens is what? We
[1:06:39] take something that is a requirement and
[1:06:42] we elevate it too far.
[1:06:45] Paul said, "I've never seen the
[1:06:46] righteous forsaken nor seed begging
[1:06:48] bread." That's what he said. But what do
[1:06:51] we say? We say, "God
[1:06:53] understands." Church, God doesn't
[1:06:56] understand. God says, "No, I don't
[1:06:58] understand because I've given you a
[1:06:59] promise that if you'll seek first the
[1:07:01] kingdom of God, I'll add all these
[1:07:03] things. I know you need to eat. I know
[1:07:04] you need a house. I know you need a car.
[1:07:06] I know you need all these things, but
[1:07:08] seek me first. Do what I require first,
[1:07:10] and I'll take care of you in every other
[1:07:12] way." God says, "I don't understand, oh
[1:07:13] ye of little faith. I put a promise in
[1:07:16] front of you and you're sitting there
[1:07:17] saying, "God understands my needs." No,
[1:07:20] God doesn't. God understands his word.
[1:07:22] And he put a word there to take care of
[1:07:23] this situation. I told that story about
[1:07:26] that brother that brother Cadrey Diggs
[1:07:27] talked about. They said they were going
[1:07:29] to fire him if he didn't work night
[1:07:31] shifts on on days when they had church.
[1:07:33] He said, "All right, fire me." And by
[1:07:34] the end, they were paying him to go to
[1:07:36] church. Why? because he stood for the
[1:07:39] principle of the word and put his work
[1:07:41] where it belonged according to the
[1:07:43] word. Paul never said, "Forsake not the
[1:07:46] working of yourselves and all the more
[1:07:48] as you see the day approaching." He
[1:07:50] said, "Forsake not the assembling of
[1:07:54] yourselves." And so we got
[1:07:57] people, and I find we're like this in
[1:07:59] different areas of our
[1:08:02] life, is that we just say, "God will be
[1:08:06] okay with it.
[1:08:08] And what we do is we miss the
[1:08:10] opportunity for a supernatural event in
[1:08:12] our life because we're too busy doing it
[1:08:14] our way and putting it in word
[1:08:17] priority as opposed to physical
[1:08:20] priority. Cuz you say, "I can survive if
[1:08:23] I don't go to church. I can't survive if
[1:08:25] I don't have money in the bank."
[1:08:27] Really? What does it profit a man if he
[1:08:29] gains the whole world and loses his
[1:08:31] soul? How are you going to be an
[1:08:33] overcomer in this world if you're not
[1:08:35] going to church? You can't do it. God
[1:08:38] has put a five-fold ministry
[1:08:40] specifically to get you ready for the
[1:08:42] rapture. And then we say, "God will
[1:08:44] understand." No, God won't understand
[1:08:46] because he's provided what you need to
[1:08:47] get in the rapture. And you say, "No,
[1:08:48] work is a higher priority. Can't do it.
[1:08:51] Can't do it. God does not understand it.
[1:08:53] God does not wink at it.
[1:08:56] Church, we've got to keep things in
[1:08:58] their priority sequence." That's the way
[1:09:00] the word calls it. What did Brother Bram
[1:09:02] say? He says God first, family second,
[1:09:06] self third every single time. And we
[1:09:10] tend to find that self and family get
[1:09:12] elevated above God way too many times.
[1:09:15] We're more than willing to short change
[1:09:17] God and expect him to
[1:09:20] understand. God's not winking, church.
[1:09:23] God is not winking at these
[1:09:25] things. When's the last time we limited
[1:09:28] the world for the sake of God? In the
[1:09:30] big things. In the big things. Now, oh,
[1:09:33] we'll do little things, but in the big
[1:09:35] things, when's the last time we put our
[1:09:37] foot on the brake and said, "You know
[1:09:38] what? Enough's enough. God has the
[1:09:40] priority." That's what he's looking for.
[1:09:42] That's what a believer does is God first
[1:09:45] in every single thing.
[1:09:48] Amen. Paul said this. He says,
[1:09:51] "Brethren, you've been called into
[1:09:53] liberty. Only use not liberty for an
[1:09:56] occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
[1:09:59] one another." I found one thing. We
[1:10:02] don't need as much as we think we need.
[1:10:04] We live a fabulous lifestyle in North
[1:10:06] America. I've traveled all over the
[1:10:07] world. I've been to South America. I've
[1:10:08] been in the Bios of Mexico. I've been
[1:10:10] down in South America into into uh
[1:10:14] um Argentina. Thank you.
[1:10:18] Chile. You talk about
[1:10:20] poor. I've been in in Mexico and these
[1:10:22] places where they just have houses that
[1:10:24] are just tin
[1:10:26] walls, a tin roof. That's it.
[1:10:30] they survive. There are believers in
[1:10:33] Africa that have tiny little homes like
[1:10:36] that. Church, what we need is a whole
[1:10:40] lot more of God. We don't need a $1,500
[1:10:43] phone and a $2,000 computer and a 3,000
[1:10:45] foot house and two $50,000 vehicles. We
[1:10:48] don't need it. We think we do, but we
[1:10:50] don't. You get down to the brass tax and
[1:10:53] if you've ever had hardships in your
[1:10:54] life, you'll find that your life just
[1:10:56] narrows down to what's really critical.
[1:10:58] And you'll find it's food, shelter, and
[1:11:02] health in the physical. Food, shelter,
[1:11:05] and health. You need clothing
[1:11:09] obviously. I'll tell you what, you take
[1:11:11] away the word of God and fellowship and
[1:11:12] you're going to die real quick cuz
[1:11:14] that's the comfort of a believer. I
[1:11:16] don't mean physically die. I'm saying
[1:11:18] you will start to crumble. Your life
[1:11:20] will start to crumble. These different
[1:11:22] things, we've got to keep these things
[1:11:23] in priority sequence.
[1:11:26] That's why Paul said, "All things are
[1:11:28] lawful, but I won't be bought under the
[1:11:30] power of any." How are you brought under
[1:11:31] the power? You say, "Well, I'm not
[1:11:33] giving everything to it, but if you put
[1:11:34] it in a higher priority than it's
[1:11:36] supposed to be, it has power over you."
[1:11:38] And the only thing you can do with that
[1:11:39] is you can kick it out or you can put it
[1:11:41] down in its priority. And if God has
[1:11:44] been displaced out of priority in your
[1:11:45] life, there's a problem. There's a
[1:11:47] problem every single time. We've got to
[1:11:50] be able to push those things back. But I
[1:11:52] want to go into Romans 14 tonight.
[1:11:55] And this is a scripture that is often
[1:11:56] used and abused, if we could put it that
[1:11:59] way, for people about having differences
[1:12:01] of standards and personal convictions
[1:12:03] and these things. And I wanted to go
[1:12:04] through this and I put it all in the
[1:12:05] amplified version tonight. We're going
[1:12:07] to do the whole thing um just so that it
[1:12:10] gives us a bit more of a of a context
[1:12:12] for how this goes and fleshes it out a
[1:12:14] bit. Paul says, "As for the man who is a
[1:12:16] weak believer," now the word there weak
[1:12:18] means a novice, somebody that is new to
[1:12:20] the faith, new to this particular belief
[1:12:23] that we have. He says, "Welcome him into
[1:12:25] your fellowship, but not to criticize
[1:12:27] his opinions or pass judgment on his
[1:12:29] scruples or perplex him with
[1:12:32] discussions. Don't overwhelm him. Don't
[1:12:36] try and put a bunch of things on him.
[1:12:38] Don't try and clean him up. Don't try
[1:12:40] and set him free. Just accept him in."
[1:12:45] Okay. He says, "One man's faith permits
[1:12:49] him to believe he may eat anything,
[1:12:51] while a weaker one limits his eating to
[1:12:54] vegetables." This is why I don't eat
[1:12:57] vegetables. It's for weak men, weak
[1:13:02] believers. But I want you to catch
[1:13:04] something here because people have
[1:13:06] abused this scripture far too
[1:13:08] long. Paul is not talking about daytoday
[1:13:12] life. He's talking about food.
[1:13:16] And we'll see this as he goes. He
[1:13:17] emphasizes over and over again. He's
[1:13:20] talking about people that took the law
[1:13:22] of Moses. Now, the law of Moses did not
[1:13:24] require vegetables only. God's a god of
[1:13:27] balance. But some people in their zeal
[1:13:31] went to vegetables only. You'll find
[1:13:33] this with the 7th day Adventist. Some of
[1:13:35] them eat some meat. Most of them don't.
[1:13:37] They've gone zealous with it. And so
[1:13:39] he's talking now about Jews that had
[1:13:42] converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[1:13:45] but they're carrying all these habits
[1:13:46] like brother Vichel did out of his East
[1:13:48] Indian culture. He's carried them in and
[1:13:51] now he's saying, "Listen, you guys are
[1:13:52] all in liberty. You're enjoying the
[1:13:54] bacon." This guy, he can't stand that.
[1:13:58] And he's saying, "You've got to be
[1:13:59] careful with something like this." And
[1:14:01] he's talking about food. Okay.
[1:14:07] Now you think for me somebody comes in
[1:14:09] and says I can only eat vegetables. I'd
[1:14:11] say you're under a yoke of bondage in my
[1:14:13] heart. I would never tell them that. But
[1:14:15] I'd say you're under a yoke of bondage.
[1:14:16] I would feel sorry for that person. I
[1:14:18] would have sympathy for that person. I
[1:14:20] would want to lay hands and pray for
[1:14:22] that person. Absolutely I would. What a
[1:14:24] miserable life I would say. But yet it
[1:14:27] is completely normal to them. Brother
[1:14:30] Vashel, it's completely normal for you
[1:14:31] to just eat vegetables and sauces. And
[1:14:34] he loves it. He loves it.
[1:14:37] completely normal. And I would say, "Oh,
[1:14:39] ye of little
[1:14:42] faith." But it's what? It's the way
[1:14:44] they're brought up. It's just the
[1:14:47] remnants of their old beliefs.
[1:14:50] Okay? He says, "Now let him let not him
[1:14:53] who eats look down or despise him who
[1:14:56] abstains." So if I'm eating bacon, I
[1:14:58] can't look down and say, "That guy's an
[1:15:00] idiot." He needs a revelation.
[1:15:03] He says, ' Don't you do that, John. He
[1:15:06] says, 'And that not him who abstains
[1:15:07] criticize and pass judgment on him who
[1:15:09] eats. Brother Vel can't look at me and
[1:15:10] say to look at that loser. Look at that
[1:15:13] unbeliever eating his bacon and enjoying
[1:15:15] it no
[1:15:17] less. He says, "For God has accepted and
[1:15:20] welcomed him." You see, church, we can
[1:15:22] be self-righteous on both sides of the
[1:15:24] issues. Okay, we're here preaching
[1:15:26] balance. I hope this is the last service
[1:15:28] I'm going to preach on this. Okay, you
[1:15:29] only have to sit through this service
[1:15:30] and we're done.
[1:15:33] Self-righteousness can exist on both
[1:15:34] sides of the
[1:15:36] tables. People that do, people that
[1:15:38] don't can both be self-righteous and
[1:15:40] criticize those on the other side. Okay?
[1:15:43] Paul says, "Nobody's supposed to do
[1:15:45] it." He says, "Who are you to pass
[1:15:48] judgment on and censure another man's
[1:15:50] household servant? It is before his own
[1:15:52] master that he stands or falls, and he
[1:15:54] shall stand and be upheld, for the
[1:15:56] master, the Lord, is mighty to support
[1:15:59] him and make him stand." He says, "God
[1:16:01] will take care of those people. God will
[1:16:04] take care of the ones in liberty and God
[1:16:05] will take care of the ones that seem to
[1:16:06] be in weakness. God will take him
[1:16:08] through. He's a child of God. He'll
[1:16:11] answer to God and God will work with him
[1:16:14] the way he
[1:16:15] is." Paul didn't say that guy needs a
[1:16:17] revelation. He says he's weak in the
[1:16:20] faith. He's new to what he believes and
[1:16:23] he's just making baby steps and we've
[1:16:25] got to let him make them that way.
[1:16:28] He says he's weaker because he's limited
[1:16:30] himself in an area that God never
[1:16:32] required. Okay? Now this he says one man
[1:16:36] esteems one day is better than another.
[1:16:38] Paul's talking about food and holy days.
[1:16:40] He's talking about religious remnants
[1:16:43] here church. He's not talking about
[1:16:44] personal standards. He's talking about
[1:16:46] religious remnants. I want to make that
[1:16:48] very clear. He says one man esteems one
[1:16:50] day better than another. Oh well we meet
[1:16:52] on Saturday. Well we we meet on Sunday.
[1:16:54] They always used to meet on Saturday.
[1:16:56] church Friday night and into Saturday.
[1:16:58] And then after a while, they finally
[1:17:00] started to meet on
[1:17:02] Sundays. Why? Cuz it was traditionally
[1:17:04] that they went to church on a Friday
[1:17:07] night. And so they just continued that.
[1:17:09] But eventually they switched to Sunday.
[1:17:12] And we say it's because it's in honor of
[1:17:14] the resurrection. But they just switched
[1:17:16] it. Maybe they could get church access
[1:17:18] better. Who knows? Who knows? So they
[1:17:22] switched it.
[1:17:24] He says, "Let everyone be fully
[1:17:26] convinced, satisfied in his own mind."
[1:17:28] So here we come to a principle now for
[1:17:30] our convictions in and of themselves. Be
[1:17:33] convinced in yourself rather than open
[1:17:36] to being convinced. Don't go around and
[1:17:38] say, "Brother Mark, what do you think?
[1:17:40] Brother Bob, what do you think? Brother
[1:17:41] Matt, what do you think? Brother John,
[1:17:43] what do you think?" No, you take it. I'm
[1:17:48] going to speak to the brothers. We run
[1:17:49] the house. We're the heads of
[1:17:50] households.
[1:17:52] Take it before God. Read your Bible.
[1:17:56] Pray and wait. If there is no rush,
[1:18:00] there is no
[1:18:01] rush. And let yourself be convinced by
[1:18:04] the word and the personal conviction of
[1:18:06] the Holy Spirit. Because otherwise,
[1:18:08] what's going to happen is inevitably,
[1:18:10] Brother Mark and I are going to have a
[1:18:12] slightly different opinion. And so,
[1:18:13] you're going to go hang out with Brother
[1:18:14] Mark, and with him, you'll hold his
[1:18:15] conviction. When you're with me, you'll
[1:18:16] hold my conviction. And pretty soon, it
[1:18:19] turns you into a two-faced believer.
[1:18:21] because you're convinced of other people
[1:18:23] rather than convinced in
[1:18:25] yourself and it'll erode trust of people
[1:18:28] around
[1:18:29] you. You don't want to do that. You need
[1:18:31] to be convinced of your own self and
[1:18:33] stand on your own two feet once you're
[1:18:35] convinced. He said, "He who observes the
[1:18:37] day observes it in honor of the Lord. He
[1:18:40] also who eats eats in honor of the Lord
[1:18:42] since he gives thanks to God while he
[1:18:44] who abstains abstains in honor of the
[1:18:46] Lord and give thanks to God." Look at
[1:18:48] what he's saying. And he's saying,
[1:18:49] "Whatever you do, whether you do it or
[1:18:50] whether you don't do it, you do it unto
[1:18:53] God. It's to glorify him. It's to honor
[1:18:56] him. So don't worry about what brother
[1:18:58] so and so or sister so and so thinks.
[1:19:00] You're doing it unto God. And he'll
[1:19:02] approve or disapprove in your life.
[1:19:04] He'll let you know if it's right or
[1:19:05] wrong. Cuz listen, church, we've always
[1:19:08] got people on either side of these
[1:19:10] things. We got people who agree and we
[1:19:12] got people that disagree. We're never
[1:19:13] going to please everyone. If you've been
[1:19:15] in church for more than six months,
[1:19:17] you'll know you can't please
[1:19:19] everybody. But what do we do? We have to
[1:19:21] be humble enough to say, "It's not my
[1:19:23] way or the highway." We've got to be
[1:19:26] able to lay ourselves down sometimes,
[1:19:28] both on the letting and on the not
[1:19:31] letting. Everybody's supposed to have
[1:19:34] that ability to lay some things down.
[1:19:36] Not to go against your conscience, but
[1:19:38] to move past it. Let it go with other
[1:19:40] people. He says, "None of us lives to
[1:19:43] himself, but to the Lord. And none of us
[1:19:45] dies to himself but to the Lord. He
[1:19:47] says, "For if we live, we live to the
[1:19:48] Lord. If we die, we die to the Lord." So
[1:19:50] then, whether we live or die, we belong
[1:19:52] to the
[1:19:53] Lord. And for Christ died and lived
[1:19:56] again for this very purpose, that he
[1:19:58] might be Lord both of the dead and of
[1:20:00] the living. Why do you criticize and
[1:20:02] pass judgment on your brother? Or you,
[1:20:05] why do you look down upon or despise
[1:20:06] your brother? For we shall all stand
[1:20:08] before the judgment seat of God. He
[1:20:11] says, "For it is written, as I live,
[1:20:13] says the Lord, every knee shall bow to
[1:20:15] me and every tongue shall confess to God
[1:20:17] and acknowledge him to his honor and to
[1:20:19] his praise." He says, "And so let each
[1:20:22] of us give account of who?"
[1:20:26] Himself. I answer for me, you answer for
[1:20:29] you. That's the way God works. It's an
[1:20:31] individual affair. Remember, we read
[1:20:32] that quote. Brother Abraham says, "It's
[1:20:34] a bunch of individuals in an individual
[1:20:36] body. You answer to God for your own
[1:20:38] life." He says to give an answer in
[1:20:41] reference to judgment to God. He says,
[1:20:43] "Then let us no more criticize and blame
[1:20:45] and pass judgment on one another, but
[1:20:47] rather decide and endeavor never to put
[1:20:50] a stumbling block or an obstacle or a
[1:20:52] hindrance in the way of a brother." Now,
[1:20:54] let's stop here because this is where
[1:20:55] this scripture gets abused so many times
[1:20:57] because we have people that say, "Well,
[1:20:59] I don't believe in so and such, such and
[1:21:01] such or or so and so or whatever." And
[1:21:04] they say, "And therefore, you cannot do
[1:21:06] that. You are not allowed to have that
[1:21:07] around me. you are not allowed to be
[1:21:09] that around me. You're not allowed to
[1:21:10] talk about that around me because I
[1:21:12] don't believe in it. That is not what
[1:21:14] Paul said here and we'll take it as we
[1:21:16] go down through this. Otherwise, what
[1:21:18] we'd have is a notebook. All right. So,
[1:21:20] these are the things that brother Bark
[1:21:21] and I don't agree on and I can't do
[1:21:23] those things or talk about them. And
[1:21:24] then there's Sister Moren and then
[1:21:26] there's Sister Brenda and brother Bob
[1:21:28] that no, Sister Justine, I agree on
[1:21:29] everything, but Sister Lydia, we've got
[1:21:31] some
[1:21:32] issues. You know what they have today?
[1:21:34] They have pronouns. They have pronouns
[1:21:36] that are not just he or she. They have
[1:21:38] all sorts of other ones. And what are
[1:21:39] they doing? They're expecting you to
[1:21:40] keep a notebook of what everybody wants
[1:21:42] to be called by. It's insanity to think
[1:21:44] that we would have to sit here and live
[1:21:46] our lives based on what everybody around
[1:21:48] us thinks. It's never been a
[1:21:50] requirement. It's never been a
[1:21:53] requirement. That's the spirit of
[1:21:55] Leodosa where nobody can be offended by
[1:21:57] anything. Nobody can grow up. Nobody can
[1:22:00] move past. Nobody can mature. That's not
[1:22:02] what Paul is talking about. That verse
[1:22:04] 13, the King James verse, King James
[1:22:06] version has two things in it. One of
[1:22:07] them is here and the other one is is
[1:22:09] slightly different. The first thing he's
[1:22:10] there is he says let us no more what?
[1:22:14] Put a stumbling block in front of
[1:22:17] somebody. Now a stumbling block is
[1:22:20] something that causes someone to fall
[1:22:23] and
[1:22:26] sin. Not fall and get
[1:22:29] offended. Not fall and have a negative
[1:22:31] emotion or feeling. Not fall and think
[1:22:34] less of you. fall and sin. This is you
[1:22:38] doing something that is against the word
[1:22:41] of God. He says you ought never to do
[1:22:43] that. If there is a clear word standard,
[1:22:46] you do not do that because if you do it
[1:22:48] and they respect you and look at you as
[1:22:50] a spiritual peer or authority, they'll
[1:22:52] think they can do it because you do it.
[1:22:55] Mom and dad, we need to be real careful
[1:22:57] because we got a bunch of people looking
[1:22:59] at us and are we putting stumbling
[1:23:00] blocks in front of
[1:23:02] them? We have to be so careful.
[1:23:08] So this is Paul saying don't do
[1:23:11] something that would cause somebody to
[1:23:14] have a sinful effect in their
[1:23:17] life. So this doesn't apply to facial
[1:23:21] hair. If somebody doesn't believe in
[1:23:23] facial hair and I've got a beard, this
[1:23:25] doesn't that's not a stumbling block to
[1:23:26] them because facial hair isn't a sin. If
[1:23:28] they see my facial hair and grow facial
[1:23:30] hair, that's not a sin. They're okay.
[1:23:32] And if they're offended by it, that's
[1:23:34] their fault and their problem, not mine.
[1:23:37] Because it's not a sin. That's not a
[1:23:39] stumbling block to them. And we'll get
[1:23:41] to the next thing in a little bit. Amen.
[1:23:43] Now, here's the thing. That may cause a
[1:23:46] strain in our fellowship, right? If you
[1:23:49] don't believe that beards are okay and
[1:23:50] I've got a beard, that may cause a
[1:23:52] strain in our
[1:23:53] fellowship. But here's the thing. We're
[1:23:56] not here to
[1:23:57] cuddle little pet doctrines or ideas or
[1:24:00] personal standards if they're not
[1:24:02] according to the word. Sometimes the
[1:24:04] best thing we could do is say, "Brother
[1:24:05] or sister, what scripture is it that
[1:24:08] causes you to think this is such a wrong
[1:24:10] thing?" But the thing about that is is
[1:24:12] that it it it puts it bald-faced out
[1:24:15] there and it puts them on the spot. And
[1:24:18] that can be very difficult to do. But
[1:24:20] the thing is this, would we rather they
[1:24:22] continued in that false
[1:24:25] assumption and letting that thing have a
[1:24:27] a bondage over them? Or would we rather
[1:24:30] call it out and say, "Brother, sister,
[1:24:32] I've never read a scripture that said
[1:24:34] tells me that wearing a that having a
[1:24:36] beard is wrong. Can you tell me where it
[1:24:37] is that you get that from?" And if they
[1:24:40] can't, then you would say, "Well,
[1:24:41] brother, sister, then why is it a
[1:24:43] problem?" And you can have a discussion
[1:24:45] about it. But otherwise, what happens is
[1:24:47] we start to tiptoe around each other.
[1:24:51] And it can turn into a form of spiritual
[1:24:54] bullying because you're trying to put on
[1:24:56] me what you think is wrong. And now I've
[1:24:59] got a tiptoe around you about all these
[1:25:00] little things that we've got going on.
[1:25:02] And it turns into a form of trying to
[1:25:04] bring us that's a doineering nature of a
[1:25:06] legalist. Legalists want you to live by
[1:25:09] their rules. And it is a dominant
[1:25:12] spirit. Absolutely. It is. You have
[1:25:14] never met a passive legalist in my life.
[1:25:17] They always want you to live according
[1:25:18] to their rules. Amen. You can be a bully
[1:25:23] by being
[1:25:24] passive, by pulling back, by not
[1:25:28] engaging, by sitting things out, by
[1:25:31] sitting back with your arms crossed and
[1:25:32] a frown on your face every time because
[1:25:35] you've got problems with just about
[1:25:36] everything that people
[1:25:38] do. That's not the life of a believer.
[1:25:41] Scripture says we're led by the spirit
[1:25:42] of God. That means we're in action.
[1:25:44] We're moving. We're the hands and feet
[1:25:47] of God, church. If our personal
[1:25:49] convictions have us sitting at home on
[1:25:50] our couch and that's all we do, there's
[1:25:52] a problem. We're supposed to be about
[1:25:54] the father's business. We're supposed to
[1:25:57] be up and doing these things. How can be
[1:25:59] a witness if we can't move out of our
[1:26:00] own house? We can't get up out of our
[1:26:02] couch. If we can't be around things that
[1:26:04] might offend us or hurt us or cause us
[1:26:06] discomfort. We grow by discomfort,
[1:26:09] church. There are some things we need to
[1:26:11] be able to just get over. And I'm going
[1:26:13] to talk about some of those. I'm going
[1:26:15] to talk about myself in a little bit by
[1:26:17] God's grace. So Paul said we never put a
[1:26:19] stumbling block. We never do something
[1:26:21] that causes somebody to go against the
[1:26:23] word. But then he says we never he says
[1:26:28] give them occasion to fall. Now this
[1:26:30] one's different. This is a snare. It's a
[1:26:32] trap. It's something that causes a
[1:26:34] person to lose their balance and be
[1:26:38] overcome or captured by something. Now I
[1:26:41] have, in other words, this is something
[1:26:43] that you can handle and you can keep in
[1:26:46] balance, but they can't. And this is one
[1:26:49] where now we get into some personal
[1:26:51] standards. Let me give you an example,
[1:26:54] perfect example of of this kind of
[1:26:55] thing. A bottle of ketchup. You put a
[1:26:58] bottle of ketchup in front of me. It's
[1:27:00] okay. I'll take a little bit and I'll
[1:27:02] squirt it on my plate. But you put that
[1:27:04] in front of Brother Joe or Brother
[1:27:05] Vichel. By the end of the meal, they're
[1:27:07] drinking it. They baptized their food in
[1:27:11] ketchup. I can handle ketchup. Brother
[1:27:14] Joe and brother Vichel, they can't
[1:27:15] handle ketchup. Now, I'm being humorous,
[1:27:18] but I'm going to get
[1:27:19] serious. But they can't do it. And so,
[1:27:22] when Brother Joe's around, what do we
[1:27:23] do? We don't put the bottle out. We put
[1:27:25] out a small bowl of ketchup. Just one of
[1:27:27] these little serving things, right?
[1:27:29] Because otherwise, we're going to need
[1:27:30] ketchup at Costco the next day. And
[1:27:33] Brother Vichel's barely any better. They
[1:27:36] look at food as a carrier for ketchup.
[1:27:39] But here's the thing. We have all sorts
[1:27:41] of little habits and things that can be
[1:27:43] the exact same way where we will
[1:27:45] automatically go to that every single
[1:27:47] time and it will completely consume our
[1:27:48] time. It'll consume our energy. It'll
[1:27:50] consume our relationships. It'll consume
[1:27:52] everything we do. And we've got to be so
[1:27:54] careful about that. We've got to be so
[1:27:56] careful about those
[1:27:59] things. I'm not talking about not doing
[1:28:02] things that make you
[1:28:04] uncomfortable. That's not what Paul's
[1:28:06] talking about. That's why I said
[1:28:07] sometimes we need to be uncomfortable.
[1:28:09] But we're talking about things that take
[1:28:11] you out of balance in your life. That's
[1:28:14] where we have to be
[1:28:15] careful. Amen. There are some people
[1:28:19] they can't handle brother ball. Do you
[1:28:22] remember brother ball? That's basketball
[1:28:24] that brothers play. Classic example
[1:28:27] would be the coffees and my
[1:28:29] father. They were playing a friendly
[1:28:31] game for about the first three minutes.
[1:28:33] And by the end, dad had his hand slashed
[1:28:35] open with glass after having put his arm
[1:28:37] through the wall trying to brace himself
[1:28:39] from a body check from brother Bob and
[1:28:41] brother Mark or brother Barry and
[1:28:43] brother Mark simultaneously. And sister
[1:28:46] Moren was left to stitch it up and pick
[1:28:48] up the pieces. What did we learn from
[1:28:50] that?
[1:28:51] Brothers, some people can't handle
[1:28:54] playing
[1:28:55] sports. They're going to get angry.
[1:28:58] They're going to get involved. I'm not
[1:28:59] criticizing anybody. I think everyone
[1:29:02] gets what's coming to them. And my
[1:29:04] father certainly got what was coming to
[1:29:05] him.
[1:29:08] Okay, you know what I'm talking about.
[1:29:10] I'll never forget it. I'll never forget
[1:29:13] it. But what did we learn? Don't play
[1:29:16] basketball with brother
[1:29:18] Lanny. At least not with the coffees.
[1:29:21] Maybe there's another brother that dad
[1:29:23] could play basketball with. But for that
[1:29:24] moment and for that sport and for that
[1:29:27] group, that's probably not the best
[1:29:28] thing for them to do in the future. and
[1:29:29] they probably never played it
[1:29:33] again,
[1:29:35] right? But I'm preaching to myself and
[1:29:38] I'm going to take this down now to where
[1:29:39] this can go. Some of you know that I
[1:29:42] have something called misophonia. And
[1:29:44] misophonia is is when you are aggravated
[1:29:47] by certain sounds. And for me, it's
[1:29:49] people crunching on their food and
[1:29:51] chewing on their nails, among other
[1:29:53] things. If you're sitting behind me in
[1:29:54] service clicking your pen, you're in
[1:29:56] risk of limb and life.
[1:29:59] repetitive clicky sounds, crunchy
[1:30:01] sounds, they drive me crazy. And
[1:30:03] sometimes I have to leave the table if
[1:30:05] we're eating really crunchy food because
[1:30:07] I'm being overcome by the feeling of
[1:30:10] what I'm hearing and I can't express it.
[1:30:13] Okay? I can I can hear you clipping your
[1:30:17] nails or biting your nails a mile away.
[1:30:19] There's people that sometimes chew their
[1:30:20] nails or clip their nails in church. I
[1:30:22] know when it's happening every single
[1:30:23] time without fail. Without fail. And
[1:30:26] it's really, really aggravating to me.
[1:30:29] Now, it feels wrong to me, but does that
[1:30:32] make you chewing nails or or crunching
[1:30:35] on your food wrong? No. But I have a
[1:30:38] very strong a visceral emotional and
[1:30:42] mental response to that. I can be
[1:30:45] sitting there, church, in seething
[1:30:47] internal
[1:30:50] rage. Okay? I I'm being honest this
[1:30:53] evening. Okay?
[1:30:55] And so what is my requirement then? Is
[1:30:58] it a fair and balanced requirement that
[1:31:00] because of the potential for you to
[1:31:02] crunch in my ear and make me rage that
[1:31:06] you can never eat crunchy
[1:31:10] food? Is it reasonable? Whenever I come
[1:31:14] over to your house, should you remember
[1:31:16] brother John can't stand people eating
[1:31:20] carrots? No. No.
[1:31:24] That's something I need to deal with.
[1:31:27] It's not wrong to crunch on crunchy
[1:31:30] food. But I can feel so caught up in
[1:31:33] those
[1:31:34] moments. And that person has no idea
[1:31:37] what they're doing to
[1:31:40] me. But I can't go around the church and
[1:31:43] saying, "Brother Chad, if you crunch one
[1:31:45] more time, I'm never coming to your
[1:31:47] house again.
[1:31:52] Why am I not over it,
[1:31:54] church? Because I'll tell you this. I
[1:31:56] believe there's deliverance. But it's
[1:31:58] easier for me to have my
[1:32:01] family deal with my occasional outbursts
[1:32:04] or separating from the table than it is
[1:32:06] for me to go to God and say, "God, would
[1:32:08] you take care of this for me? I believe
[1:32:10] he can heal us of everything we have. I
[1:32:14] believe it. Listen, we're built certain
[1:32:17] ways. I'm not talking about a
[1:32:18] personality change, but something that
[1:32:20] interferes with relationships, something
[1:32:22] that interferes with
[1:32:23] fellowship. I've got to get to the
[1:32:25] place, church, where I want to get rid
[1:32:27] of that more than I want you to bow down
[1:32:29] to
[1:32:29] it. Now, I don't project that on you.
[1:32:32] Some of you know about it, some of you
[1:32:35] don't. But we can take those things and
[1:32:37] because the emotion that comes with that
[1:32:39] is so strong, we can turn it into an
[1:32:41] offense. We can turn it into something
[1:32:43] that they need to deal with. Church, the
[1:32:45] problem is not you for crunching your
[1:32:47] food. Everybody crunches their
[1:32:49] food. The problem is me for how I react
[1:32:52] to
[1:32:53] it. But the thing is
[1:32:57] this, we can take a natural issue with
[1:33:00] the natural response and we can turn it
[1:33:02] into a spiritual issue. I could say if
[1:33:05] you love me as your pastor and brother,
[1:33:08] you would never have raw vegetables ever
[1:33:11] served in my presence.
[1:33:14] out of respect for the ministry and for
[1:33:17] the love of God, don't serve raw
[1:33:20] vegetables. Nobody's going to do this
[1:33:22] again. I I didn't think about this. I
[1:33:24] didn't think about this. I I may
[1:33:25] actually get my way, but listen, I can
[1:33:27] do that. I could do that. We're
[1:33:29] laughing. We're laughing. But K, don't
[1:33:32] we do that? Let it slip to Sister Moren.
[1:33:35] Sister Moren, it drives me nuts these
[1:33:38] these vegetables. And next thing you
[1:33:41] know, sister, she never does it. And
[1:33:43] nobody else gets to have that because
[1:33:45] I'm in the
[1:33:46] house. What is it? I'm projecting my
[1:33:49] needs now, my issues, my natural
[1:33:52] problems. And that's all it is is a
[1:33:54] natural problem. And I'm saying you guys
[1:33:56] aren't allowed to enjoy
[1:33:58] anything. And I can bully you with
[1:34:01] that. I can make you bow down before the
[1:34:04] altar of my misophonia.
[1:34:10] We can take other things then and I'm
[1:34:12] using myself because if I preach against
[1:34:14] myself usually it'll relax the people
[1:34:16] enough to hear what I'm going to say.
[1:34:18] But I'll tell you this and you go talk
[1:34:19] to the deacons in this church, you take
[1:34:20] talk to deacons in any church I've been
[1:34:22] because I've been all around the world
[1:34:24] at this point and every church I've been
[1:34:26] to. What happens is people will take
[1:34:28] those things and we will spiritualize it
[1:34:31] to make it so we don't have to deal with
[1:34:33] it and we put the reaction on everybody
[1:34:36] else.
[1:34:41] Okay. Why? Because spiritual people
[1:34:44] respect spiritual issues. And so if we
[1:34:46] make it a spiritual issue, then people
[1:34:49] have to respect it and have to deal with
[1:34:50] it. And so people will take this
[1:34:52] scripture we've been reading. They'll
[1:34:53] say, "Say you have to accommodate me.
[1:34:55] The scripture says you've got to
[1:34:56] accommodate me. I struggle with this and
[1:34:57] I have a problem with this and I have a
[1:34:59] problem with that." Paul says, "Such
[1:35:01] were some of
[1:35:02] you, but you are washed. You're
[1:35:04] sanctified. You're justified. You're
[1:35:06] cleansed. all of these different things.
[1:35:08] People say you you're not allowed to
[1:35:09] offend me, church. We're allowed to
[1:35:10] offend each other in these things. I'm
[1:35:13] not saying go around offending. I'm
[1:35:15] saying we can't go around like a bunch
[1:35:16] of children saying you can't do it
[1:35:18] because it bothers me. It makes me feel
[1:35:20] weird. It makes me feel bad. I don't I
[1:35:23] wouldn't go anywhere and eat with
[1:35:24] people. I can't stand people that chew
[1:35:26] with their mouth open. I can't stand
[1:35:27] people that chew loudly. You don't even
[1:35:29] have to crunch. Just chew loudly. I'm
[1:35:31] getting some nods here. We may have a a
[1:35:34] misophonia anonymous after service.
[1:35:36] Brother Chad, I'm in. Yep. Mashed
[1:35:39] potatoes every
[1:35:41] day. But we can get
[1:35:44] there. Talk to your deacon sometime.
[1:35:47] Have you ever dealt with somebody that
[1:35:48] spiritualized an issue and it kept them
[1:35:50] from addressing it? And what happens is
[1:35:52] all the rest of us are left to pick up
[1:35:54] the mess that they leave behind? 100%.
[1:35:57] It's happened in every church I've been
[1:35:59] to. Kids are born a certain way.
[1:36:03] and they turn it into a spiritual matter
[1:36:05] rather than that's just the way they
[1:36:06] are. They've got DNA, they've got
[1:36:09] disease, they've got conditions, they've
[1:36:10] got this, they've got that. Sometimes
[1:36:12] it's cuz they just haven't been raised
[1:36:13] right and they turn it into a special
[1:36:17] thing. We all have our weird things.
[1:36:20] We've got our little idiosyncrasies. We
[1:36:22] got little things we like and don't
[1:36:23] like. Big things. I mean, consider this.
[1:36:26] I don't like the way most people eat,
[1:36:28] church. That's a pretty big thing.
[1:36:29] That's a pretty big thing.
[1:36:33] We've all got them. We've all got them.
[1:36:36] And it can be the way people dress. It
[1:36:38] can be the way people talk. It can be
[1:36:40] the way people do things, the way people
[1:36:41] don't do things. Whatever it is. And
[1:36:43] Satan will take those and he'll elevate
[1:36:45] them into something spiritual so that we
[1:36:47] force the issue on everybody else
[1:36:49] instead of our own selves. And what are
[1:36:51] we doing? We're sitting here helpless
[1:36:54] and
[1:36:55] bound by our own nature, by our own
[1:36:58] flesh, by our own issues, whatever that
[1:37:00] might
[1:37:02] be. And in the end, and again, I'm
[1:37:05] speaking from personal experience,
[1:37:07] people elevate those things to the point
[1:37:08] where their problem becomes a sign of
[1:37:12] sior
[1:37:14] spirituality. God's honest truth. I can
[1:37:16] I could give you a name and a condition
[1:37:17] today.
[1:37:20] That's what
[1:37:23] happens. We enforce that bondage on
[1:37:25] other
[1:37:27] people. People clothe themselves with a
[1:37:30] spiritual title and it makes them
[1:37:32] untouchable outside of
[1:37:34] correction. Pretty soon it's just a mess
[1:37:37] everywhere and people are walking around
[1:37:39] just trying not to step in it. It's a
[1:37:41] horrible, horrible thing to deal
[1:37:43] with. What did Jesus say? What did Paul
[1:37:46] say? He says, "Judge ourselves." judge
[1:37:49] ourselves. Judge ourselves.
[1:37:57] If you ever met somebody that keeps
[1:37:59] going from church to
[1:38:01] church and every church is a
[1:38:04] problem. Who's the problem? It's not the
[1:38:07] churches. Every church has problems. No
[1:38:10] church is
[1:38:11] perfect. I like the way one minister say
[1:38:13] he said, "If the church was perfect, it
[1:38:15] was imperfect the day I landed.
[1:38:18] because I'm going to bring my
[1:38:19] imperfections in. Somebody that keeps
[1:38:21] pointing to everybody else, they're not
[1:38:23] judging
[1:38:24] themselves. And everybody's paying a
[1:38:26] price because of
[1:38:28] it. Paul says this, "Now I know and I am
[1:38:31] convinced, I'm persuaded as one in the
[1:38:33] Lord Jesus that nothing is forbidden as
[1:38:36] essentially unclean, defiled, and unholy
[1:38:38] in itself." Church, remember, he's
[1:38:40] talking about food and h and and and
[1:38:43] holy days here. He's not talking about
[1:38:46] everything in life. He's talking about
[1:38:48] religious remnants, okay? He's not
[1:38:51] talking about jewelry and motorcycles
[1:38:53] and hairstyles and sports and these
[1:38:54] things. He's talking about freedom in
[1:38:56] Christ from the old laws. He says, "But
[1:38:59] nonetheless, it is unclean to anyone who
[1:39:02] thinks it is
[1:39:03] unclean. If you think it's unclean,
[1:39:06] don't do it. Never do it." He says it's
[1:39:09] unclean to you. It's a personal
[1:39:10] conviction. But if your brother is being
[1:39:12] pained or his feelings hurt or if he's
[1:39:15] being injured by what you eat,
[1:39:18] misophonia would apply here. No, it
[1:39:22] wouldn't. If you're eating something
[1:39:24] that I believe was wrong by my religion,
[1:39:26] he says, "That's a problem." He says,
[1:39:28] "Then you're no longer walking in love.
[1:39:30] You have ceased to be living and
[1:39:32] conducting yourself by the standard of
[1:39:34] love toward him. Do not let what you eat
[1:39:37] hurt or cause the ruin of one for whom
[1:39:40] Christ died. Again, notice the elements
[1:39:42] here. This is a novice, somebody that is
[1:39:45] new to the faith that hasn't grown into
[1:39:47] full maturity with residual beliefs from
[1:39:50] the system they came out
[1:39:52] of. That's why Paul said at the
[1:39:55] beginning, leave them alone. Don't try
[1:39:57] and force everything on them. Don't
[1:39:59] overload them. Relax. Let the Lord do a
[1:40:01] work. Okay. This chapter is specifically
[1:40:05] about residual beliefs from old systems.
[1:40:09] Okay? It's not about us coming up with
[1:40:12] new things and forcing people to come up
[1:40:14] and deal with it.
[1:40:16] Okay? It's somebody dealing with
[1:40:18] religious culture shock, if we could put
[1:40:20] it that way. He says, "Do not therefore
[1:40:23] let what seems to be good to you be
[1:40:25] considered an evil thing by someone
[1:40:26] else." He says, "In other words, do not
[1:40:28] give occasion for others to criticize
[1:40:30] that which is justifiable for you. For
[1:40:33] all," and this is where we opened our
[1:40:34] service. He says, "After all, the
[1:40:36] kingdom of God is not a matter of
[1:40:38] getting the food and drink that one
[1:40:41] likes." He says, "But it is instead
[1:40:44] righteousness, that state of which makes
[1:40:46] a person acceptable to God, and heart
[1:40:48] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." So,
[1:40:51] we're now not looking for rights and
[1:40:53] wrongs and and dos and don'ts and am I
[1:40:55] allowed or not am I allowed. He's
[1:40:56] saying, "We're focused now on that which
[1:40:58] is pleasing to God and the peace and the
[1:41:01] joy that comes from the Holy Spirit."
[1:41:03] That's what we ought to be focused on,
[1:41:05] not on whether or not I can eat steak
[1:41:08] around a brother that doesn't believe in
[1:41:09] eating food, eating meat. He says, "He
[1:41:12] who serves Christ in that way is
[1:41:14] acceptable and pleasing to God and is
[1:41:16] approved by men." Now, catch verse 19.
[1:41:18] This is the key to this whole thing. He
[1:41:20] says, "Let us then definitely aim for
[1:41:23] and eagerly pursue what makes for
[1:41:26] harmony and for mutual upbuilding." And
[1:41:29] everyone starts at the harmony
[1:41:31] part. Do what keeps the
[1:41:34] peace. But that is not the end of the
[1:41:37] scripture. It is for peace and for
[1:41:41] harmony and for mutual upbuilding.
[1:41:45] He says it's for edification and
[1:41:48] development of one another. In other
[1:41:50] words, this is for growth's sake, not to
[1:41:54] leave somebody in the condition they're
[1:41:56] in. He says, "But you allow this and you
[1:41:58] you you respect their their beliefs for
[1:42:01] a while so that they can grow and have
[1:42:03] time to listen and let the word do a
[1:42:06] work. Let the spirit do a work. Let them
[1:42:08] relax.
[1:42:10] Get comfortable about where they are and
[1:42:13] what they're doing.
[1:42:15] It is. And we don't know this because
[1:42:16] we're raised in this message. But when
[1:42:18] you come out from a system that has
[1:42:21] completely blinded you for all of your
[1:42:23] life and you come into light, it can be
[1:42:25] overwhelming. Isn't that right, brother
[1:42:27] Vichel? So much is changing. Brother
[1:42:29] Mark would know this and brother Sister
[1:42:31] Moren and and brother Bob and sister
[1:42:32] Brenda certainly brother Chad coming out
[1:42:35] of the world perhaps would know this a
[1:42:36] little bit. But but you come in and
[1:42:39] everything is new.
[1:42:42] He's saying, "Don't enforce all this
[1:42:44] stuff on these poor people. They're just
[1:42:46] coming into life. They're just coming
[1:42:47] into light. Let God do the work." He
[1:42:50] says, "But the purpose of this harmony
[1:42:52] is so that they can grow and that you
[1:42:55] can grow. But if they don't
[1:42:59] grow, there's a
[1:43:01] problem. And we can't sit around with a
[1:43:03] bunch of sacred cows because people
[1:43:06] refuse to grow up.
[1:43:08] If they don't grow up, it becomes their
[1:43:10] problem, not the church's problem. Does
[1:43:13] that make sense? We're both supposed to
[1:43:16] mature and your liberty should not
[1:43:18] infringe on mine or vice versa. But
[1:43:21] we're both supposed to grow. We're both
[1:43:23] supposed to mature in Christ.
[1:43:28] Amen. Verse 20. Lost my place. He says,
[1:43:31] "You must not for the sake of food."
[1:43:33] Remember, Paul's telling us context
[1:43:35] here. Religious remnants, food and holy
[1:43:37] days, not everything in life, but things
[1:43:39] that are tied specifically to old
[1:43:40] religion. You must not for the sake of
[1:43:42] food undo and break down and destroy the
[1:43:44] works of God. Everything is indeed
[1:43:46] ceremonial, clean and pure. Peter knew
[1:43:49] that. Peter found that out, right? When
[1:43:51] that sheet dropped down with all these
[1:43:52] things, he says, "What God has called
[1:43:53] clean, let no man call unclean." He
[1:43:55] says, "But it is wrong for anyone to
[1:43:57] hurt the conscience of others or make
[1:43:59] them fall by what he eats.
[1:44:04] We got to give them time to grow up. He
[1:44:06] says, "The right thing to do is to eat
[1:44:09] no meat or drink no
[1:44:13] wine at all or do anything else if it
[1:44:16] makes your brother stumble or hurts his
[1:44:18] conscience or offends or weakens him."
[1:44:20] Again, people will take that and they'll
[1:44:22] run with it to bind you to their
[1:44:23] personal convictions. Paul's talking
[1:44:25] about religious
[1:44:27] remnants, not just whatever you decide
[1:44:30] that offends you or bothers you. He says
[1:44:33] your com personal convictions on such
[1:44:35] matters. He says exercise them as in
[1:44:38] God's presence, keeping them to
[1:44:39] yourself, striving only to know the
[1:44:41] truth and obey his will. Blessed, happy
[1:44:44] to be envied is he who has no reason to
[1:44:46] judge himself for what he approves, who
[1:44:49] does not convict himself by what he
[1:44:51] chooses to do. But the man who has
[1:44:53] doubts, who has misgivings, an uneasy
[1:44:55] conscience about eating, again, we're
[1:44:58] talking religious remnants, and then
[1:45:00] eats, perhaps because of you, stands
[1:45:02] condemned before God because he's not
[1:45:04] true to his convictions, and he does not
[1:45:05] act from faith. For whatsoever does not
[1:45:08] originate and perceive from faith is
[1:45:10] sin. And he says, "Whatever is done
[1:45:12] without a conviction of its approval by
[1:45:14] God is sinful." Now, Brother Brham would
[1:45:17] expand this and because the world looks
[1:45:19] at sin as as the things you do. But
[1:45:20] remember what brother Bram said. He says
[1:45:22] sin is unbelief. So we the the King
[1:45:25] James version says for what is not of fa
[1:45:26] whatsoever is not of faith is sin. We
[1:45:28] would say whatsoever is not of faith is
[1:45:31] unbelief. And that makes perfect sense.
[1:45:34] If you don't believe it, it can't be
[1:45:35] from faith. And if you don't believe it
[1:45:37] and you don't have faith, why would you
[1:45:39] ever do it, church? Why would we let
[1:45:41] some other believer ramrod us into doing
[1:45:43] something that we're uncomfortable with?
[1:45:45] Don't do it. Walk away. Stand on your
[1:45:47] own two feet. God bless you. And we
[1:45:50] ought to be able to let somebody walk
[1:45:51] away with as much grace as they have for
[1:45:53] walking away and not judging us for
[1:45:55] doing what we're doing. It's a two-sided
[1:45:57] coin. Grace and not self-righteousness
[1:45:59] on both sides. Brother Bram has this
[1:46:02] beautiful quote. He says, "If there's a
[1:46:04] question, men come and say, do you think
[1:46:06] it's wrong to smoke?" Listen, it take
[1:46:08] out smoke and put whatever you want
[1:46:10] there. Is it wrong to do it? He says,
[1:46:13] "What are you asking it for?" If it's a
[1:46:15] question in your mind, leave it alone.
[1:46:19] He says, "For anything you don't do by
[1:46:21] faith is sin." That's right. It's got to
[1:46:23] be by faith. So, how can you smoke and
[1:46:25] have faith? See, it's right in your own
[1:46:26] conscience that shows you that you're
[1:46:28] wrong. So, if it's uncertain, you better
[1:46:30] leave it alone cuz that might be the one
[1:46:32] thing that keeps you out of the kingdom
[1:46:34] of
[1:46:34] God. That's heavy. That's heavy. That's
[1:46:38] why we don't need to go around and
[1:46:40] shouldn't go around trying to convince
[1:46:42] people to do what we do.
[1:46:45] If we go against their conscience and by
[1:46:48] whatever reason, whether it's out of
[1:46:49] friendship, whether listen, some of us
[1:46:51] don't stand up so well as others. And we
[1:46:53] can be bowed over by people telling us
[1:46:56] to do things or by by group think or or
[1:46:58] by social pressure or spiritual
[1:47:00] pressure, whatever that might look like.
[1:47:03] We've got to be so careful that I don't
[1:47:04] that we don't go up to somebody and say,
[1:47:06] "Hey, come do
[1:47:08] this." And if they say no, or they he
[1:47:11] say, "Hey, that's okay." And just let it
[1:47:14] go. We should not try and convince
[1:47:16] somebody of those things. God has worked
[1:47:18] with their conscience to hold them back.
[1:47:20] Don't cross the barrier. Okay? Don't try
[1:47:23] and sway them. God works with them
[1:47:25] sovereignly. It comes back to that
[1:47:27] question I started out with earlier,
[1:47:28] which is who are we asking and why are
[1:47:32] we asking? Who's doing the asking? Who's
[1:47:35] driving this from the inside? Is it me
[1:47:37] or is it something else? What's driving
[1:47:40] us to make a change in our life? What's
[1:47:41] the influence? Is it another believer?
[1:47:43] Is it the pastor? Is it the five-fold
[1:47:45] ministry? Is it something we read? Is it
[1:47:47] somebody we hang out with? I'll tell you
[1:47:50] this. If you honestly tell me what
[1:47:53] you've been feeding on the last little
[1:47:55] while, you won't have to tell me why
[1:47:58] you're asking. Cuz it'll tell you why
[1:48:00] you're asking. If all you've been doing
[1:48:02] is is watching YouTube and being on
[1:48:04] Facebook and Instagram, guess what,
[1:48:06] church? I'm going to tell you right now,
[1:48:08] it probably isn't of God. But if you've
[1:48:10] been listening to the word, you've been
[1:48:11] reading your Bible, you've been praying,
[1:48:13] you've been you've been just enveloping
[1:48:16] yourself in the good things of God, and
[1:48:18] you got something you're moving towards,
[1:48:19] I've got a lot more confidence in your
[1:48:20] request then because what you're feeding
[1:48:22] on will drive you towards it. And I'll
[1:48:24] tell you this, sheep that are wellfed
[1:48:26] don't go into strange pastures. They
[1:48:28] don't need to cuz they're fed by what
[1:48:30] they already have.
[1:48:32] Amen. Paul said it this or sorry,
[1:48:35] Solomon said it this way. He says, "Let
[1:48:36] us hear the conclusion of the whole
[1:48:38] matter. Fear God and keep his
[1:48:40] commandments. For this is the whole duty
[1:48:42] of men. For God shall bring every work
[1:48:44] into judgment with every secret thing,
[1:48:46] whether it be good or whether it be
[1:48:49] evil. Listen, God's going to make it
[1:48:50] plain. God's going to make it plain one
[1:48:53] way or the other. And we can wrap it in
[1:48:55] a cloak of spirituality. We can wrap it
[1:48:56] in a cloak of I've got rights. We can
[1:48:58] wrap it in a cloak of the Bible doesn't
[1:48:59] say I can't. But God's going to show
[1:49:01] whether he was behind it or whether you
[1:49:03] were behind it. And there's a lot of
[1:49:05] people doing a lot of good things. And
[1:49:06] at the end, remember what he said,
[1:49:07] "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:49:08] iniquity. I never knew you." He didn't
[1:49:10] say it wasn't good. It just wasn't his
[1:49:12] will. That's it. That's why I'm saying
[1:49:15] this isn't about dos and don'ts or
[1:49:16] rights and wrongs. It's what does God
[1:49:18] have for me to do in my life on a daily
[1:49:20] basis. That's what ought to be driving
[1:49:22] the believer. We look at Eve. Eve got
[1:49:24] seduced by the potential of something
[1:49:26] beyond what she had right already. Eve
[1:49:29] had
[1:49:30] perfection. Eve's a daughter of God in a
[1:49:34] perfect body. And Satan comes and he
[1:49:36] says something that's a little bit
[1:49:38] different. And she stopped and she
[1:49:39] listened. And then she listened a little
[1:49:41] bit more. And by the end of it, she gave
[1:49:43] herself over completely to a lie and
[1:49:46] lost everything she had. Lost everything
[1:49:48] she had. You look at what you're feeding
[1:49:50] on every day and you'll find out pretty
[1:49:53] quickly where your inspiration's coming
[1:49:54] from. It's that simple. It's that
[1:49:57] simple. If what you're feeding on is the
[1:50:00] word, what'll come out is the word. And
[1:50:03] if you're feeding on something that's
[1:50:04] other than the word, then what's going
[1:50:05] to come out is something other than the
[1:50:07] word every time, church. That's the way
[1:50:08] that these things work. Amen. The spirit
[1:50:11] of God will drive you to faith and
[1:50:12] action in the word. It'll drive you to
[1:50:15] something sure because it's building on
[1:50:18] a foundation. Remember, it's building on
[1:50:20] a cornerstone of the word of God. So, if
[1:50:21] we're being led by the spirit, it's
[1:50:23] going to take us to a sure foundation,
[1:50:25] not into the waters of maybe it's okay
[1:50:26] or not okay. That's not the point of
[1:50:28] God. God's point is to take you to what
[1:50:30] is proven, to what is sure, what is
[1:50:32] steady, what is
[1:50:34] unchanging. Sons of God are led by the
[1:50:36] spirit of God. Amen. He takes you where
[1:50:39] he wants you to
[1:50:41] go. We'll see it as we move on in this
[1:50:43] series in the next couple of services
[1:50:45] that if we put our energy into being
[1:50:48] led rather than into our energy into
[1:50:51] getting permission, we'd be so much
[1:50:53] further
[1:50:55] ahead. Being led is what matters. And
[1:50:58] the scripture defines children of God as
[1:51:00] those that are led. So what's the
[1:51:03] purpose of my will? The purpose of my
[1:51:06] will is to yield it, to surrender it so
[1:51:09] that he can lead the sheep. That's the
[1:51:11] only reason I've got anything in terms
[1:51:13] of free will in these things. I found
[1:51:15] out if we're about the father's
[1:51:16] business, we don't have a whole lot of
[1:51:18] time for these
[1:51:19] questions. Listen, I would love to have
[1:51:21] a motorcycle someday. Me and brother
[1:51:24] Chad were making plans. But the simple
[1:51:26] fact is this, church. I'm I'm not being
[1:51:29] sounding self-righteous. This is a this
[1:51:30] is the truth. I'm too busy to have a
[1:51:34] motorcycle right now. So it doesn't
[1:51:36] matter if it's right or wrong. Doesn't
[1:51:38] matter if people agree or disagree
[1:51:39] because I'm not getting one because I
[1:51:41] don't have time to ride it. That's what
[1:51:43] I'm saying is when we're about the
[1:51:44] father's business, most of these
[1:51:46] questions become
[1:51:48] moot. Mothers,
[1:51:50] fathers. Listen, my wife's going away in
[1:51:54] a week or two to California and I'm
[1:51:55] going to have to be mom and
[1:51:57] dad. Bing dad's bad enough being a
[1:52:00] pastor. Now I got to be a mom on top of
[1:52:02] it. Mothers, if you're about your
[1:52:04] motherly duties, you're not going to
[1:52:05] have a whole lot of time for anything
[1:52:07] else. I see what it looks like. You
[1:52:09] don't have time to question if this is
[1:52:11] right or wrong because you're too busy
[1:52:12] maintaining the house, taking care of
[1:52:14] the kids. I think everyone here now
[1:52:16] except for sister Leah is is
[1:52:17] homeschooling their kids and she's
[1:52:19] helping her her husband run a business
[1:52:20] as well as being a mom and wife church.
[1:52:24] If you're about the father's business as
[1:52:26] adults, we don't have a whole lot of
[1:52:28] time for anything
[1:52:30] else. And so most of these questions
[1:52:32] become academic rather than real. It's
[1:52:35] the young people. It's the young people
[1:52:37] that have time on their hands. And so
[1:52:39] they're like, "Well, what do I do now,
[1:52:40] Mom? What am I going to do now, Dad? I'm
[1:52:42] so bored. What can I do? Can I watch
[1:52:44] this? Can I do that? Can I go here? Can
[1:52:46] I go there? And that's when we usually
[1:52:48] get into the real questions because mom
[1:52:50] and dad are too busy, too busy being
[1:52:54] adults, running a household, leading the
[1:52:56] household, whatever that might be to do
[1:53:00] that. I'm not here to preach a message
[1:53:03] of standards and dos and don'ts. We've
[1:53:04] got standards, church. You want to talk
[1:53:06] about personal standards, you come talk
[1:53:07] to me anytime. I'll tell you my personal
[1:53:08] standards. Happy to do it. And I've done
[1:53:10] it many times.
[1:53:12] But I I'm going to preach a word
[1:53:15] standard and I'll share my personal
[1:53:17] standard if you want it. But we got to
[1:53:19] stick with the word and what it says.
[1:53:21] But the bigger thing is that I'm here to
[1:53:23] preach the liberty of being led by the
[1:53:25] spirit of God. That's what the gospel
[1:53:27] is. The gospel is good
[1:53:28] news. The good news is that Christ can
[1:53:31] come down and live inside of you and do
[1:53:34] the same works that he did before. He
[1:53:35] can destroy the works of the devil in
[1:53:37] your own body through your own hands,
[1:53:39] your own feet, your own mouth, your own
[1:53:42] mind, whatever that might be. That's
[1:53:44] what I want to preach. I want to preach
[1:53:45] victory, not
[1:53:47] rules. Rules didn't produce anything,
[1:53:49] church, except denomination and death.
[1:53:53] It's not going to do it. Yes, we warn
[1:53:54] people. Yes, we look at current events.
[1:53:56] Yes, we look at technologies. We look at
[1:53:58] new things that come out and we talk
[1:53:59] about these things. And sometimes we
[1:54:01] preach about them and we warn the
[1:54:02] people. We have to do those things.
[1:54:04] Amen. But our goal is not to get you to
[1:54:06] conform. Our goal is to get you to a new
[1:54:08] birth and let Christ do the work that
[1:54:10] all of us want you want want to see done
[1:54:12] in your life. Isn't it the most
[1:54:14] wonderful thing, fathers and mothers,
[1:54:16] when you don't have to tell your kids
[1:54:18] what they have to do anymore, cuz
[1:54:20] they're doing it themselves.
[1:54:22] That's when you know I can let my hands
[1:54:24] off the wheel here more or less is when
[1:54:26] they start doing it out of their own
[1:54:28] choice, out of their own heart, rather
[1:54:30] than because mom and dad told me to or
[1:54:32] because I'll get spanked if I don't or
[1:54:33] I'll lose privileges if I don't. But
[1:54:35] they just start to do it because they
[1:54:36] bought in. That's what the new birth is.
[1:54:38] You've been born again and you're doing
[1:54:40] it now from the heart. Not because the
[1:54:42] church does it. Not because people will
[1:54:44] look down on you. Not because people
[1:54:45] will put you out. Not cuz people will
[1:54:47] say things about you, but because
[1:54:48] there's a life there's a
[1:54:51] lifesp.
[1:54:55] Amen. Scripture and a quote as we close.
[1:54:57] He says, "Fear thou not, for I am with
[1:55:00] thee." We're talking about no room for
[1:55:03] fear. Fear thou not, for I am with thee.
[1:55:06] Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I
[1:55:09] will strengthen ye. Yay, I will help
[1:55:11] thee. Yay, I will uphold thee with the
[1:55:14] right hand of my righteousness. This
[1:55:16] series on the token life is all about
[1:55:18] getting you into Christ. That's what it
[1:55:22] is. And then once he's in you to let his
[1:55:24] life live throughout you. And then it's
[1:55:27] exactly as
[1:55:28] this. Why are we not scared, church? Cuz
[1:55:31] he's with us. Why are we not weak? Cuz
[1:55:34] he is with us. Why are we not helpless?
[1:55:37] Cuz he's with us. Why are we righteous?
[1:55:40] because he is with us. It's all him. And
[1:55:44] that takes the fear right out of it.
[1:55:46] It's not me. It's Christ in me that's
[1:55:48] doing this whole work. That's the
[1:55:50] promise that Christ gave. I'll be with
[1:55:52] you even in you to the end of the age.
[1:55:54] He's the one that's going to take us all
[1:55:56] the way through. That's the great
[1:55:57] commission. That's Acts 2:38. Brother
[1:55:59] puts it this way as we close. When the
[1:56:01] worshipper puts his hands on the head of
[1:56:03] the dying lamb of Calvary and confesses
[1:56:06] his sin and God recognizes that to be
[1:56:08] truthful from his heart, he confesses
[1:56:10] his sin. That circling life called the
[1:56:12] Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ turns back
[1:56:15] into the worshipper and he is purged and
[1:56:18] has no more desire for sin. For he is
[1:56:21] led by the spirit of God and not his own
[1:56:24] life from then on. We're turning a
[1:56:25] corner now. We're going away from dos
[1:56:28] and don'ts. We're going away from
[1:56:29] legalism. We're going into leadership.
[1:56:32] He says he'll make
[1:56:35] mistakes
[1:56:38] certainly. I'm going to speak to the
[1:56:39] elders. Have we made mistakes since we
[1:56:42] got the Holy Ghost? Show of hands,
[1:56:45] please. Okay. We make
[1:56:48] mistakes. We make mistakes every day.
[1:56:53] We're going to make wrong choices. We're
[1:56:55] going to make wrong steps. We're going
[1:56:56] to get trapped. We're going to get
[1:56:57] fooled.
[1:57:00] He says he'll make mistakes
[1:57:02] certainly, but that life will hold him.
[1:57:07] Amen. Less than that life will hold him.
[1:57:12] We're talking about no room for fear. My
[1:57:15] fear cannot be that if I do this, he'll
[1:57:18] send me to hell. If I do that, he'll
[1:57:20] cast me out. If he'll do this, he's
[1:57:22] going to do this. If I do that, he's
[1:57:23] going to do that. That's not what
[1:57:25] controls the believer. What is it? It's
[1:57:27] perfect love. It's perfect life in the
[1:57:30] believer that holds us. We're going to
[1:57:32] make
[1:57:34] mistakes. We can't have a a hammer, a
[1:57:37] sword over our head all day long if we
[1:57:40] don't do everything perfectly that he's
[1:57:42] going to judge
[1:57:43] us. No, that life will hold him. The
[1:57:47] blood covers and the life takes us
[1:57:49] through. Amen. That's why we have no
[1:57:51] fear. And that's what we're going to get
[1:57:52] into. I trust you've been okay. these
[1:57:56] three services. I know it's been very
[1:57:58] personal in some cases, it's very direct
[1:58:00] in some
[1:58:01] cases, but I felt the Lord wanted us to
[1:58:04] go there and I've got to follow that
[1:58:06] leadership as much as it's uncomfortable
[1:58:07] for me as it may be for you at
[1:58:10] times. Amen. But we want to we want to
[1:58:12] live by his leadership, church. We don't
[1:58:15] want a a bunch of people that do it
[1:58:17] because they have to. That is not a
[1:58:19] happy place to be. That is the most
[1:58:21] miserable Christian in the world is the
[1:58:23] one that does it because he has to.
[1:58:26] Who's the happy one, church? Who's the
[1:58:28] joyful one? It's the one that says, "I
[1:58:30] want to do it." And even when this flesh
[1:58:33] doesn't want to, there's something
[1:58:34] inside of me that keeps me going, keeps
[1:58:36] me fighting, keeps me coming back even
[1:58:38] after I fall and says, "Pick yourself
[1:58:41] up, son." A just man, a righteous man
[1:58:44] falls seven times and rises up again.
[1:58:47] Amen. We'll make mistakes certainly, but
[1:58:49] that life will hold us. Amen. Amen. God
[1:58:51] bless you. Let's bow our heads. Lord
[1:58:54] Jesus, Lord, I'm thankful for your
[1:58:56] boldness and your
[1:58:58] courage. Lord, I'm thankful for your
[1:59:01] spirit that leads and guides, Lord. And
[1:59:03] I'm thankful for truth that we can rest
[1:59:06] on, Lord. I'm praying you'll just take
[1:59:08] these three services, Lord, that we've
[1:59:10] preached on this. And Lord, as we turn
[1:59:13] this corner on no room for
[1:59:15] fear, Lord, may we leave behind those
[1:59:18] things that bind us. Lord, if there is
[1:59:21] any lingering fear, Lord, may you just
[1:59:24] cast it out this evening. We pray. May
[1:59:25] we go in perfect liberty of the spirit
[1:59:27] tonight, Lord, that you are with us. You
[1:59:30] have chosen us, Lord. We are already
[1:59:32] justified. We are already sanctified. We
[1:59:34] are already cleaned. We are already in
[1:59:37] your presence as perfect sons and
[1:59:39] daughters. Lord, our rest is in you. Our
[1:59:41] peace is in you. Our comfort is in you.
[1:59:43] Our assurance, Lord, is in this witness
[1:59:45] of the spirit that lives within us.
[1:59:48] Lord, I pray you deliver us from every
[1:59:50] fear, Lord, and set us free to worship
[1:59:53] you exactly as you'd have us to do it.
[1:59:55] Lord God, grant us grace, Lord, one for
[1:59:58] the other. Lord, we all have our little
[2:00:00] isms, our own little ideas, our own
[2:00:02] little Lord, strange things that we have
[2:00:04] and do and wonder and don't like. And
[2:00:08] Lord, I pray you give us grace and love
[2:00:10] one for another. Amen. Lord, that in
[2:00:12] this preaching even, Lord, that your
[2:00:14] love would come through, Lord, not in
[2:00:15] hardship, Lord, but Lord, in a in an
[2:00:18] offer of liberty, an offer of mercy, an
[2:00:21] offer of unity and harmony, Lord, beyond
[2:00:23] that which we've ever had before. Grace
[2:00:26] to your people, Lord, we pray in Jesus
[2:00:29] Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[2:00:32] in your presence.

[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:40] Heavenly
[2:15:41] Father, I trust that can always be our
[2:15:44] desire, Father. And yet our testimony as
[2:15:47] well, Lord, that we love you more every
[2:15:49] day. And the more we know you, Lord,
[2:15:54] Father, it just it just takes a
[2:15:58] yielding, Lord, Father, to yield to the
[2:16:02] desire, Father, to feed upon the word
[2:16:05] and to thereby just drawing closer and
[2:16:08] closer to you. And Lord, the more we
[2:16:12] feed, the more we see, Father, the the
[2:16:15] word unfolding before us, Lord, and in
[2:16:17] our lives, Lord, and all around us, then
[2:16:20] the more we would love you,
[2:16:23] Father. Lord, I just want to thank you,
[2:16:25] Father, for the word that we've heard
[2:16:27] tonight in these past few services,
[2:16:29] Father. So thankful, Lord, to to know
[2:16:32] you are mindful of us, Father, to the
[2:16:35] point where you show us where we're
[2:16:37] wrong, where we make our mistakes. And
[2:16:39] father, you want you you use the
[2:16:42] ministry, Father, the pastor, Father, to
[2:16:44] point out those things, Lord. And it's
[2:16:47] all designed, Lord, to get us ready for
[2:16:49] the change of the body. And Father, we
[2:16:51] just pray, Lord, that you would help us,
[2:16:53] Lord, by grace to take that word,
[2:16:55] Father, and embrace it, Lord, and let it
[2:16:57] live, Lord, in us, Father.
[2:17:00] And Lord, as we go from here tonight,
[2:17:02] Lord, help us, Father, by grace, Lord,
[2:17:04] to be mindful of you, Lord, knowing that
[2:17:07] you're mindful of us, Father. And that,
[2:17:09] Lord, as the word says, Lord, that we
[2:17:11] are just but flesh. And Father, Lord,
[2:17:14] you you look at us, Father, and all the
[2:17:16] mistakes that we make. But, Father, it
[2:17:18] is grace for all of that, Father. And we
[2:17:21] thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for
[2:17:23] blessing us the way you do, for meeting
[2:17:25] our needs and ministering, Lord, to us
[2:17:27] in such a mighty way, Lord. Father,
[2:17:30] Lord, by grace that we might, Lord, by
[2:17:32] have that faith, Lord, that we'll claim
[2:17:34] a rapture. So Lord, we ask you bless
[2:17:36] those, Lord, that are not here tonight,
[2:17:39] Father, those that are sick and
[2:17:40] afflicted. There's many sicknesses,
[2:17:42] Lord. Father, we know the devil is going
[2:17:45] about as a roaring line, Lord, seeking
[2:17:47] whom you may devour. And Lord, he's
[2:17:49] casting things upon us. But Father, we
[2:17:53] know, Lord, that nothing is too hard for
[2:17:55] you. And Lord, we're praying that you
[2:17:57] would touch each one. Father, let faith
[2:17:59] rise, Lord, to claim the promise of
[2:18:01] divine healing, Lord, in each and every
[2:18:03] one, Father. And we pray, Lord, for
[2:18:05] Brother John, especially as well,
[2:18:07] Father, Lord, that you would just give
[2:18:09] him the faith, Lord, that claims to
[2:18:11] promise to heal his eye because, Lord,
[2:18:13] again, there's nothing too hard for you.
[2:18:15] So, we're just, Father, just committing
[2:18:17] them into your hands tonight as a body,
[2:18:20] Lord, singular, Lord, agreeing all in
[2:18:22] one, Father, for the healing, Lord, of
[2:18:24] that eye. Because Lord, we know, Father,
[2:18:27] that it's him, Lord, that will bring the
[2:18:29] word to us. It was him, Lord, that you
[2:18:32] use, Lord, to to feed us and to have our
[2:18:35] faith increased. So, we pray your
[2:18:36] blessing upon him and upon all, Father,
[2:18:39] as we go here tonight, Father, may you
[2:18:41] go to our homes with us. Keep us safe,
[2:18:43] Lord, by grace and help us to love you
[2:18:45] and serve you till you take us home. In
[2:18:47] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
