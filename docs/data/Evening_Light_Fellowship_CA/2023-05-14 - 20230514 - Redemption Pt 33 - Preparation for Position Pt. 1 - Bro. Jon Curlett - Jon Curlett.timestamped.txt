[43:06] God bless the mothers today
[43:08] amen those that are those that will be
[43:12] amen prophet of God said that they are
[43:14] the backbone of the nation
[43:17] he said and when they attacked
[43:18] motherhood and when they took it away he
[43:20] said they broke
[43:21] the nation's Spirit that's how important
[43:23] a mother is amen so we praise the God we
[43:26] praise God for Holy Ghost filled
[43:29] Godly women
[43:31] amen that can raise their children in
[43:33] the nurture and admonition of the Lord I
[43:35] mean I believe each one that's here is a
[43:37] product in part of a good mother
[43:40] amen that God has granted us those Grace
[43:42] that Grace to be raised in a home most
[43:44] of us with a father as well hopefully
[43:45] that that believes in trusts in the Lord
[43:48] Jesus Christ amen but we're thankful
[43:49] from others that have been faithful and
[43:51] today a mother is not very respected the
[43:54] way they used to be they they're more
[43:55] respected for their jobs and what they
[43:57] do out in the world and they're trying
[43:58] to get them away from it and give their
[44:00] children over to other people to raise
[44:01] men you'll never find in the scripture
[44:03] where where it it shows those sort of
[44:06] things for a mother to back away from
[44:07] those situations but she's supposed to
[44:09] stay with it amen so we're blessed to
[44:11] those that have been able to do it and
[44:13] and have given their lives literally
[44:15] given their lives for for us to raise us
[44:17] as children amen

[45:22] amen God bless you Ephesians 1 and verse
[45:24] 5.
[45:25] very familiar scripture No Doubt says
[45:27] having predestinated us unto the
[45:30] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[45:32] himself according to the good pleasure
[45:34] of his will to the praise of the glory
[45:37] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[45:39] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[45:42] Redemption through his blood the
[45:44] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[45:45] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[45:48] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[45:49] Prudence having made known unto us the
[45:52] mystery of his will according to his
[45:54] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[45:57] himself amen God bless you you can have
[45:58] your seats this morning and we're we're
[46:01] finally stepping into the last portion
[46:02] of this series on Redemption and and
[46:05] I've been talking about adoption and and
[46:07] what not again like he have kept
[46:08] pointing forward to it well now we're
[46:10] here now we're in the Final Phase so if
[46:12] you've been enjoying it then then we've
[46:14] got a little ways to go and if you wish
[46:16] I'd just move on then we'll be moving on
[46:17] shortly as well so one way or the other
[46:19] it should be good amen but we're going
[46:21] to spend some some time on this because
[46:22] we're at the end of the Gentile
[46:24] dispensation we're at the end of God
[46:25] God's plan for the Gentiles before he
[46:27] turns back to the Jews and that means
[46:29] he's got to wrap everything up and that
[46:31] means that as the scripture talks about
[46:32] there is a final manifestation of the of
[46:34] the sons of God so I want to take for a
[46:37] title this morning we're in in
[46:38] Redemption as I said but I want to talk
[46:40] about preparation for position amen
[46:43] preparation for position and and we know
[46:45] that as God is wrapping things up that
[46:47] that elect lady that bride of Jesus
[46:49] Christ those ones that were chosen from
[46:51] the foundation of the world from before
[46:52] the foundation of the world that he's
[46:54] got a final move that he does with that
[46:56] last age bride and she will be just like
[46:58] they had in the book of Acts Prophet God
[47:00] tells us that if there's another Vine
[47:02] that if it puts forth another Branch
[47:04] she'll do the same work she'll put forth
[47:06] a second book of Acts amen not a book of
[47:08] beliefs
[47:10] remember it's called the book of The
[47:11] Acts of the Apostles not the book of the
[47:13] beliefs of the Apostles amen at some
[47:16] point our beliefs have to be put into
[47:18] action amen there has to be a reflection
[47:20] in our day-to-day life of the decisions
[47:22] we make of the of the way we spend our
[47:24] time of the way we spend our energy that
[47:26] it reflects what we believe that we
[47:27] would be not hearers only but that we
[47:29] would be doers also amen we'll get into
[47:31] that a little bit later and I know that
[47:33] for many of us certainly the older ones
[47:35] no doubt they've heard this many times
[47:36] before but just the way that I've got to
[47:39] do it I've got to start from the bottom
[47:40] and build us up so for the older ones
[47:42] maybe hold on and and just get here but
[47:44] the younger ones maybe haven't heard
[47:46] this and and haven't had it taught to
[47:48] them so I'll be teaching more this
[47:49] morning rather than preaching probably
[47:50] but just to set a foundation of of what
[47:53] it means we talked here in Ephesians 1
[47:55] about the adoption of children and I
[47:57] want to go through that adoption process
[47:58] over the next few Services because that
[48:01] word adoption means something quite
[48:02] different today than it meant back then
[48:04] because today when we talk about
[48:06] adoption it talks about bringing
[48:07] somebody that's not in your family into
[48:09] the family but the the adoption process
[48:12] in those days was was quite a bit
[48:14] different and and sometimes we forget
[48:16] that the Bible is an Eastern book it's
[48:18] not a western book it's not an American
[48:19] book it's not a Canadian book it's a
[48:21] western it's an Eastern book and so we
[48:23] have to look at it through the eyes of
[48:24] the Eastern world and their traditions
[48:26] and that's how we we start to understand
[48:28] these things and and what adoption
[48:30] really is so in Galatians 4 Paul says
[48:33] Paul says this he says now I say that
[48:36] the air as long as he is a child
[48:38] different nothing from a servant though
[48:41] he be the Lord of all but he is under
[48:43] tutors and governors until the time
[48:45] appointed of the father and he's
[48:47] pointing to what this adoption process
[48:49] looks like and what he's saying here is
[48:51] he says is that the in order to be
[48:53] adopted you had to be a member of the
[48:55] family see here in North America to be
[48:57] adopted you can't be a member of the
[48:59] family but if we started with it with
[49:01] this in the scriptures if adoption was
[49:04] only for somebody that was born into the
[49:06] family as a son
[49:08] in other words you got it because of who
[49:11] you were in the family they couldn't add
[49:14] to it they couldn't take away from it
[49:15] but if you were a part of the family
[49:17] then you were able to go through this
[49:19] process of adoption amen so it was a
[49:22] reflection of their bloodline it was a
[49:24] reflection of their origin it was a
[49:25] reflection of who their father was
[49:27] That's What mattered most was not who
[49:29] you were but who your father was that's
[49:31] what allowed you to come into this
[49:32] adoption process amen so this this idea
[49:35] of adoption the Scripture it doesn't
[49:37] mean it the way we think but it's rather
[49:39] putting someone into a position of
[49:41] responsibility it would be called the
[49:43] placing of a son
[49:44] and it was put into a position of
[49:46] responsibility so not just you are my
[49:49] son but he puts you into the family
[49:50] business he puts you into what matters
[49:52] to the family you take on things that
[49:54] matter to the father and the family and
[49:56] you take those responsibilities on
[49:57] because he knows that you're ready to to
[50:00] take those things on Amen so I want you
[50:03] to understand that adoption is not
[50:04] because you did something in and of
[50:06] yourself and it's no different for us as
[50:09] children of God you don't have adoption
[50:11] because you went out and earned a place
[50:13] that would do it you've got to earn it
[50:15] in a way but you're given the
[50:16] opportunity because you are a child of
[50:19] God and that was before you ever did
[50:21] anything before you ever chose God
[50:22] before you ever took a step towards God
[50:24] he has already put a place there for you
[50:27] and we read in Ephesians 5 there where
[50:29] he says that he has showed us the
[50:30] mystery of his will and the Mystery of
[50:32] his will is how you fit into the family
[50:34] of God what you're supposed to do with
[50:36] your life and so each one that is born
[50:38] has a place that they must fit because
[50:41] God doesn't have children for the sake
[50:43] of children today maybe what happens is
[50:45] is that that a husband and wife have
[50:47] children because they want intimacy
[50:49] because they want pleasure but God
[50:51] doesn't do it that way God has children
[50:52] for purpose and it is for the use and
[50:55] the kingdom of God he's got a place
[50:57] exactly prepared for them and he's got a
[50:59] path prepared for them specifically to
[51:02] take them to where he wants them to be
[51:03] that's where this adoption process looks
[51:06] like amen it's because you are a child
[51:08] of God because you're a part of the
[51:09] family of God because he chose you
[51:11] before the foundation of the world
[51:12] that's why you're going to be adopted
[51:14] amen
[51:16] now I as we read here in Galatians 4
[51:18] Paul is saying here he says that the air
[51:20] so the one that's going to inherit
[51:22] everything that the father has the one
[51:24] that's going to get all of his money all
[51:26] of his property all of his business all
[51:28] of these things he says that son starts
[51:31] out no different than a servant
[51:34] in other words his authority his
[51:36] responsibility what he is allowed to do
[51:39] with with the father's things and and
[51:41] whatnot all of that he says he starts
[51:43] out no different than a servant
[51:46] because why he's just a child and when
[51:48] you're our child you think as a child
[51:49] you act as a child you do as a child but
[51:52] there has to come a day where you become
[51:53] a man and you put away childish things
[51:55] but as long as you're a child then the
[51:58] father can't use you as long as you
[51:59] think and act as a child then the father
[52:01] can't use you so he's got to put you
[52:03] through a process until you're shown
[52:05] yourself worthy to take over or to step
[52:08] up next to the father and do the work
[52:09] that he has for you
[52:11] so what did he do because he starts as a
[52:14] child at this level and he wants to
[52:15] raise him not just to a man because a
[52:18] man you can look at him and say he's a
[52:20] man but he's got to be a man that's
[52:21] worthy that is similar that is the same
[52:23] as the father so that he can do the
[52:25] father's work and so he's got to take
[52:27] him from here all the way up to here and
[52:29] how does he do it in verse 2 it says
[52:31] that he put him under tutors and
[52:33] governors until the time appointed of
[52:35] whom
[52:36] the father so it wasn't the son that
[52:39] could say Lord I'm ready Daddy I'm ready
[52:41] but the father had to say son you're
[52:43] ready
[52:44] we don't determine when we're ready for
[52:46] God to use us God determines when we're
[52:48] ready for God to use us and we'll sit
[52:50] and we'll sit and he'll work in her work
[52:52] until we get to the place that he sees
[52:54] himself in us and then he'll put us into
[52:56] action but until that time we've got to
[52:58] suffer through the tutors and Governor's
[53:00] stage of our life before God is ready
[53:02] for us
[53:03] Prophet God puts it this way he says for
[53:05] when a man owned a great big place so
[53:07] nice a big farm he had many tenants all
[53:09] all around over this place and he was a
[53:12] busy man he had to go from place to
[53:13] place and then when a son was born in
[53:16] his house they didn't have such things
[53:17] as we have today public schools and so
[53:19] forth they didn't have it in those days
[53:21] they had to hire tutors to raise their
[53:23] children
[53:24] now he says when a son was born he was
[53:27] born he was a son as soon as he was born
[53:29] you're a child of God before you ever
[53:32] realize it when that son came out of his
[53:35] mother's womb he didn't know he was a
[53:37] son but yet he was a son nonetheless
[53:39] but that's only the start of this
[53:42] he was a born son to that home but yet
[53:44] he didn't have any inheritance until he
[53:46] came to a place he'd what proved himself
[53:49] a son how does your son how does your
[53:52] daughter prove that she is your son or
[53:54] daughter she acts like you she talks
[53:57] like you she does these things and it's
[53:59] so funny as you see your children grow
[54:00] and they start to mimic mommy and daddy
[54:03] and you start saying well that's just
[54:05] like me or that's just like you and you
[54:07] see those things reflected and you say
[54:09] they really are my son they really are
[54:10] my daughter you knew they were but you
[54:12] see it in their actions you see it in
[54:13] the words they say in the things they do
[54:15] and you say huh there it is there's my
[54:17] half in there
[54:18] he says he he came to a place where he
[54:21] proved himself a son and then when he
[54:23] was proved to be a son then he was
[54:25] adopted into the family and the law of
[54:28] adoption made him what an equal holder
[54:30] with his father
[54:32] remember scripture says Jesus said in
[54:34] that day you'll ask the father anything
[54:35] in my name and I'll do it that's what
[54:37] adoption looks like is when you speak it
[54:39] and God does it because why your name on
[54:41] the check is as good as his but you
[54:43] don't just get that because you are a
[54:45] son you do not just get that because you
[54:47] are a daughter of God but you get it
[54:49] because you proved you know how to use
[54:51] what's in the bank account for the
[54:52] kingdom of God's purpose not just your
[54:54] own and we'll talk about that in a
[54:56] little bit amen so the father committed
[54:58] the training and the teaching and the
[55:00] proving of a son to trusted Tutors or
[55:02] Governors and they would be directed by
[55:05] what the will of the son
[55:08] did the son get to say I want to be an
[55:10] accountant or I want to be a Rancher or
[55:12] I want to be a machinist or I want to be
[55:14] an engineer I want to be a teacher no
[55:16] the father chose what the son's role was
[55:19] going to be because he knew what was
[55:21] required in his business in his land and
[55:23] in his property and if you didn't do
[55:25] what the father said you couldn't
[55:26] inherit what the father had
[55:28] so you are born into a family to take
[55:31] what the father had already provided for
[55:32] you that what he had built up in these
[55:34] different things amen so maybe if the
[55:36] father was a Rancher and he was
[55:38] surrounded by by desert lands and maybe
[55:40] he was on the border of the Philistines
[55:42] or whatnot then he would have to teach
[55:44] his son a certain way his son would have
[55:46] to be a man that could handle war that
[55:48] could handle cattle rustlers and bandits
[55:50] and he'd have to know what it was like
[55:51] to go out and track men down or guard
[55:53] against them in these different things
[55:54] so the Rancher would maybe bring in an
[55:56] old army Sergeant that was tough and
[55:58] hard as nails to toughen his son up
[56:00] because he was going to have to spend
[56:01] days and weeks out in the out in the
[56:04] fields and out in in the pastures and
[56:06] out in the desert checking on things and
[56:08] tidying things up and he'd have to sleep
[56:10] on hard ground and he'd have to eat
[56:12] beans and and black coffee and beef
[56:15] steaks all the time and he'd have to be
[56:17] a man that could handle the rigors of
[56:18] outdoor life and these different things
[56:20] so he'd have to hire a tutor that
[56:22] matched the end goal or the end purpose
[56:24] of his child of his son
[56:26] but then maybe another guy had a
[56:27] manufacturing business and he didn't
[56:29] need a son that could wield a sword or
[56:31] throw a spear could hunt down cattle
[56:33] rustlers he needed a guy that could
[56:34] maybe fix the equipment like brother
[56:36] Matt you know a machinist or something
[56:38] like that or maybe he needed a man that
[56:40] could develop contracts and and develop
[56:42] a supply chain and bring things in and
[56:44] turn them into better things maybe he
[56:46] needed a son that could handle the books
[56:48] and so he'd have them there and he'd
[56:49] have an accountant train his son into
[56:51] how to run a business
[56:54] you know again the sun was trained based
[56:56] on what the father determined was needed
[56:58] not on what the sun determined what was
[57:00] needed and so the training was a
[57:02] reflection of his final position
[57:04] now if you took those two boys one the
[57:06] son of a Rancher and won the son of
[57:08] maybe a manufacturing or production
[57:09] company and you put the two of them
[57:11] together and they start talking to each
[57:13] other and maybe the the the son that's
[57:15] sitting at the desk he says to the other
[57:16] guy says what did you do today the guy
[57:18] says I learned six ways how to kill a
[57:20] Cattle Rustler while riding my horse
[57:23] and at that accountant boy would be
[57:25] sitting there and saying well all I
[57:27] learned how to do was was to make the
[57:28] financial statements for the company for
[57:30] at your end sitting at my desk and he'd
[57:33] go back and he'd say to his dad how come
[57:34] he gets to ride horses and and swing
[57:36] swords and I'm sitting here at a desk
[57:38] and the father would say because you're
[57:39] not called to kill cattle rustlers
[57:42] you're not called to to sit out there
[57:44] and sleep on the ground and have ants
[57:46] all over you when you wake up in the
[57:47] morning and scorpions in your boots
[57:48] you're called to run a business
[57:50] differently than what he's called to run
[57:52] but if those Sons started talking and
[57:54] one of them would say I want what he's
[57:56] got them what would happen maybe on the
[57:58] side he'd go out and he'd learn how to
[58:00] how to fight and learn how to swing a
[58:01] sword to get away from the father sings
[58:03] and he'd get what he'd get in a place
[58:05] where he wasn't satisfied with what the
[58:07] father had called him to do and he'd
[58:09] start learning something that had no
[58:10] benefit to him or the father's business
[58:12] and he'd have wasted all that time
[58:17] why am I saying this sometimes we look
[58:19] around and we say how come they get to
[58:21] do that how come they get to do that how
[58:24] come they have this and I don't have
[58:25] this and what it is is God has it
[58:27] prepared each and every one of us for a
[58:29] certain place in a certain position in
[58:31] the Kingdom
[58:32] I saw something I was reading somebody
[58:35] had attributed a quote to Michelangelo
[58:37] and I looked it up and I don't know that
[58:39] he said it but one thing he did say he
[58:40] said he said people want to be a master
[58:43] but if they saw how hard it was to
[58:45] become a master none of them would want
[58:47] it
[58:48] if you understood what it took to become
[58:51] certain things in the body of Christ
[58:52] you'd never ask for it we had a Prophet
[58:55] come in this age and it was an open book
[58:56] and we got to see him tell about all the
[58:58] mistakes he made and the troubles that
[59:00] God put them through and the discipline
[59:01] that he went through and the judgments
[59:03] of God on his life because what he
[59:05] refused to obey at Key moments of his
[59:07] life and he was honest enough he was
[59:08] Frank enough to tell us don't disobey
[59:11] because it's painful it's hard because
[59:13] God takes a man or God takes a woman and
[59:16] as he prepares them he's breaking them
[59:18] down and molding them into what they're
[59:19] supposed to be and as long as we resist
[59:22] we can't be molded
[59:24] as long as we resist we can't be molded
[59:26] and so he's looking for people that will
[59:28] what stop resisting and surrender and
[59:31] say Lord you know what you want out of
[59:33] me Father you know what what you want
[59:34] out of me and I'm willing to surrender
[59:36] my life to do it amen when I was called
[59:38] to the ministry it was the last thing I
[59:40] wanted I've shared this publicly many
[59:42] times because why I had a lot of Pride I
[59:45] had a lot of self-confidence I had a lot
[59:47] of belief in myself and that's the kind
[59:49] of thing that kills behind a Pulpit it
[59:51] kills behind a Pulpit if you think you
[59:53] can get up here and get up and preach
[59:55] because of what you know or because of
[59:57] the revelations you have or this that
[59:59] and the other thing that is not it
[1:00:00] you've got to be able to catch the mind
[1:00:02] of God for the people for that service
[1:00:04] day in and day out and it has nothing to
[1:00:06] do with what you want to say or what you
[1:00:08] know it has to be what God has for the
[1:00:10] people that day and that's it
[1:00:13] that's it and so you have to be molded
[1:00:15] you have to be broken and the the way
[1:00:18] that a gift operates is not that you
[1:00:19] take it and use it but the gift is that
[1:00:21] you get yourself out of the way so that
[1:00:23] God can use you whether it's music
[1:00:25] whether it's Ministry whether it's helps
[1:00:27] whether it's the conversations we have
[1:00:29] with people and learning to say the
[1:00:31] right thing at the right time all of
[1:00:33] these things are what they are a
[1:00:35] yielding rather than a wielding can I
[1:00:38] put it that way it is a yielding rather
[1:00:40] than wielding it's not that you take it
[1:00:41] and use it it's that you step back and
[1:00:43] he takes you and starts to use you in a
[1:00:46] way that you couldn't use any other that
[1:00:47] you couldn't do any other way amen but
[1:00:49] God's preparing us for a specific Place
[1:00:51] God doesn't have children for the sake
[1:00:53] of children he has them because he has a
[1:00:55] purpose and a place for each and every
[1:00:57] one of us men and women boy or girl
[1:00:59] children adults it doesn't matter
[1:01:03] he says this now when this child was
[1:01:05] born he became a son the very moment he
[1:01:07] was born in the family he says you get
[1:01:08] it but then there was a tutor over this
[1:01:10] boy to educate him and to raise him up
[1:01:12] well he was no more than a servant said
[1:01:14] the galatian letter until he came to an
[1:01:16] age a certain limited time that was set
[1:01:21] and this tutor would always take the
[1:01:23] father word your son is progressing
[1:01:25] right or whatever it was now this Tudor
[1:01:28] in the natural went to the father and
[1:01:29] said now here that boy is not going to
[1:01:31] be very good I try to teach him he just
[1:01:34] won't listen he's got his own headstrong
[1:01:37] way and he just won't listen he's going
[1:01:39] to be this or he's going to be that what
[1:01:41] the son is saying I don't want what
[1:01:43] you've got I'm going to be this and I'm
[1:01:45] going to be that listen when we're boys
[1:01:46] we always want to be many times what our
[1:01:49] what our dad is but sometimes we we see
[1:01:51] things in uh you know like Jensen wants
[1:01:53] to be a tuna fisherman
[1:01:55] where does he get that from not for me
[1:01:57] he wants to be a tuna fisherman or he
[1:01:59] wants to be this or he wants to be that
[1:02:00] what he's saying is the sun God's he got
[1:02:02] a vision he got he saw something that he
[1:02:04] liked and because he likes it he says I
[1:02:06] want to be that
[1:02:07] that's not going to work that's not
[1:02:09] going to work he says the father
[1:02:11] realizes right then
[1:02:13] if that boy keeps fighting if that boy
[1:02:15] keeps pushing back he realizes right
[1:02:17] then that that boy cannot take over his
[1:02:19] domain that's right because what would
[1:02:21] he do he'd run it through the return of
[1:02:24] the prodigal son gives a beautiful
[1:02:25] picture of it see he could not what he
[1:02:28] would do would be to mortgage the farmer
[1:02:30] sell it off and drink it off and run
[1:02:31] around what would he do he'd take what
[1:02:33] the father had and then sell it get rid
[1:02:35] of it to benefit what he wanted in his
[1:02:37] dreams and his ideas
[1:02:40] so in other words what he's saying here
[1:02:42] is this tutor was responsible to be in
[1:02:44] charge of that boy and he was supposed
[1:02:46] to come to the father and give him
[1:02:47] regular updates on what that boy was
[1:02:50] doing and these days we get what we get
[1:02:52] a report card from school and it's a
[1:02:54] piece of paper
[1:02:55] but this kind of a tutor didn't give it
[1:02:57] just a paper report he came and he gave
[1:02:59] a verbal report to the father on how his
[1:03:01] son was doing and all of these things
[1:03:03] because the father wanted a son that was
[1:03:05] guaranteed to be ready for the adoption
[1:03:07] ceremony so he could step in and help
[1:03:09] the father and he wanted those updates
[1:03:11] to be real
[1:03:12] he wanted a tutor that wouldn't tell him
[1:03:15] what he wanted to hear but a tutor that
[1:03:16] would tell him exactly what was going on
[1:03:18] so he'd know whether or not he could
[1:03:20] trust that son to see if that son was
[1:03:22] prepared
[1:03:23] now notice what he's talking about here
[1:03:24] he's not just talking about knowledge
[1:03:27] when we get report cards from our
[1:03:29] children at school most of that report
[1:03:31] card is focused on knowledge did they
[1:03:33] get A's or B's or C's in math and
[1:03:35] science and all these different things
[1:03:37] and we looked down that report card and
[1:03:39] we are so proud when our kid gets
[1:03:40] straight A's
[1:03:41] but you know what the place is that we
[1:03:43] ought to be most proud of
[1:03:44] it's that little box at the bottom
[1:03:47] where the teacher gives us a verbal
[1:03:50] report on what our child is like
[1:03:53] I've always told my children I'm happier
[1:03:55] if you get a Citizenship Award then you
[1:03:58] get straight A's
[1:03:59] because that proves who you are not what
[1:04:02] you know and I'm more interested in what
[1:04:04] you are rather than what you know amen
[1:04:07] and guess what God is the exact same way
[1:04:09] and we'll get into it here a little bit
[1:04:10] amen but at the bottom that teacher is
[1:04:12] going to say is your child interruptive
[1:04:14] are they kind or mean are they a bully
[1:04:17] or are they helpful do they give up
[1:04:18] their time and energy to others or are
[1:04:20] they take take take and that's where the
[1:04:22] teacher is really letting you know how
[1:04:23] your children's doing with everybody
[1:04:25] else
[1:04:26] are they an asset or are they a
[1:04:28] liability in the classroom and we want
[1:04:30] our kids to reflect the character that
[1:04:32] hopefully we're teaching them at home
[1:04:33] and that they're showing that in the
[1:04:35] school when they're out from under the
[1:04:36] eyes of Mommy and Daddy and that's a
[1:04:38] reflection of who they are inside and
[1:04:40] it's not just a put on when they're
[1:04:41] around mommy and daddy
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:45] he would say now the father has to find
[1:04:47] the right man the man the right kind of
[1:04:48] a tutor and that's a beautiful type of
[1:04:51] the church that when we become sons of
[1:04:52] God born into the kingdom of God the
[1:04:54] Father sent us the best tutor that he
[1:04:56] could find and that's the Holy Spirit
[1:04:58] now he never sent us an Archbishop to be
[1:05:00] our tutor or a general overseer or a
[1:05:03] district man or a pastor or Minister
[1:05:05] that's not what it's meant I'm not here
[1:05:07] to run your life
[1:05:09] I'm not here to tell you what to do I'm
[1:05:11] here to point you to the one that knows
[1:05:13] where you're supposed to go what you're
[1:05:14] supposed to do how you're supposed to
[1:05:16] spend your time but I can only turn you
[1:05:18] back to this anyways
[1:05:19] that's what I'm supposed to do buying
[1:05:21] this pulpit and as we count Converse in
[1:05:23] these different things I've got to point
[1:05:25] you back to this
[1:05:26] and if it comes to opinion I've got to
[1:05:27] clearly State this is my opinion because
[1:05:29] I don't have a word to stand on but he
[1:05:31] says you've got to have the right tutor
[1:05:32] and it's got to be the Holy Spirit he
[1:05:34] says that's where we've made our mistake
[1:05:36] the church is governed by the Holy
[1:05:38] Spirit and that's God's government for
[1:05:40] his church but we've adopted other
[1:05:41] tutors and other razors
[1:05:43] and then this tutor must be just he says
[1:05:46] not pull any punches he must bring the
[1:05:48] direct truth to the father and how that
[1:05:51] tutor must blush when he comes up to the
[1:05:53] father in his face and said Your son's
[1:05:55] not doing too good he's failing in his
[1:05:57] studies he's dilatory
[1:06:00] he can't say he's doing well when he's
[1:06:03] not
[1:06:04] because if he does the father will take
[1:06:06] him at his word and he'll put him in a
[1:06:07] place that he's not ready for
[1:06:09] he says now the tutor must feel to come
[1:06:12] before the father with such a message as
[1:06:14] that about his son and I often wonder
[1:06:16] how the Holy Spirit must feel in the
[1:06:18] presence of God so much World in it
[1:06:21] people so dilatory that he's been So
[1:06:23] Graceful to to and given the new birth
[1:06:26] he says oh it must be terrible what God
[1:06:28] has provided everything we could ask for
[1:06:31] and then what do we do with it
[1:06:33] buffkes nothing
[1:06:37] he says they're not doing anything with
[1:06:38] it
[1:06:39] they've given they've been given
[1:06:41] everything and they're doing nothing
[1:06:42] with it and they're not they're just
[1:06:44] lazy they're not they're not stepping up
[1:06:45] to the plate they don't realize what
[1:06:47] they have they don't appreciate what
[1:06:49] they have that tutor was being paying
[1:06:51] good money to spend his time and efforts
[1:06:53] on that son to raise him and he's saying
[1:06:55] your son doesn't appreciate what's being
[1:06:57] put in front of him
[1:06:59] he says
[1:07:00] bringing it down home now
[1:07:02] remember that conduct of yours goes
[1:07:05] straight to the presence of God by
[1:07:08] somebody who won't pull punches
[1:07:11] no matter how good a neighbor you are
[1:07:13] what a fine pillar you are in the church
[1:07:15] he says the Holy Spirit brings the truth
[1:07:17] to God
[1:07:20] what about how you act
[1:07:22] not about what we know
[1:07:24] adoption is not just about knowledge
[1:07:28] I meant adoption is just not about what
[1:07:30] we know amen you got to know the the the
[1:07:33] right things and you've got to know the
[1:07:34] truth and you've got to have a basis for
[1:07:36] your life but knowing what's under the
[1:07:38] Seven Seals will not make you a child of
[1:07:40] God
[1:07:42] an adopted son of God knowing the
[1:07:44] threefold mystery revealing of Christ
[1:07:45] will not make you a child of God knowing
[1:07:48] the godhead knowing the original sin
[1:07:49] will not make you an adopted son of God
[1:07:52] that's just knowledge
[1:07:54] there's no doctrinal test to get into
[1:07:56] heaven
[1:07:58] there's no doctrinal test for the new
[1:08:00] birth
[1:08:01] I can prove by the scripture
[1:08:03] he says what the holy spirit will lead
[1:08:06] you into all truth you don't have to
[1:08:08] have the truth right now to have the
[1:08:10] Holy Ghost
[1:08:12] but if you got the Holy Ghost it will
[1:08:13] lead you into all truth and we sit here
[1:08:16] saying I've got all truth therefore I
[1:08:17] have the Holy Ghost no no no if you're
[1:08:20] raised around truth you can have it and
[1:08:21] never have it
[1:08:22] because it's not just about what you
[1:08:24] know it's going to be about how you
[1:08:25] apply it amen we can get straight A's in
[1:08:27] message Doctrine and go straight to hell
[1:08:30] that's the hard truth listen that's what
[1:08:33] they had in Jesus Day Jesus is standing
[1:08:34] before the Pharisees and they all had
[1:08:36] Straight A's in Old Testament Doctrine
[1:08:38] they thought
[1:08:39] and then the word made flesh stood in
[1:08:41] front of them and gave them the real
[1:08:43] truth and they said it was blasphemy
[1:08:45] they said it was satanic
[1:08:47] and they rejected it and then in the end
[1:08:49] they killed it but yet they had Straight
[1:08:50] A's in theology why because they didn't
[1:08:53] have the life behind it they didn't have
[1:08:55] a true revelation of what it was I've
[1:08:57] said it before before I ever got the
[1:08:59] Holy Ghost I thought I knew truth
[1:09:01] because I've been raised under him we
[1:09:03] have brother Mark in Sunday school and
[1:09:04] brother Jill as a pastor teaching things
[1:09:06] over the pulpit and you think you know
[1:09:08] truth but as soon as you get the Holy
[1:09:10] Ghost you realize before then I had
[1:09:12] tinted glasses on and guess what they
[1:09:14] were they weren't tinted by the blood of
[1:09:15] the Lamb they were tinted by sin they
[1:09:17] were tinted by personal bias they were
[1:09:19] tinted by my own hypocrisy
[1:09:21] and I would look at people in situations
[1:09:23] and judge them because I had the truth
[1:09:25] and I didn't have the truth any more
[1:09:27] than a hot and taught does
[1:09:29] I needed the new birth to open my eyes
[1:09:31] to what was really behind this Jesus
[1:09:34] said to the to the Pharisees they did
[1:09:36] everything he says you died even down to
[1:09:37] the mint and cumin the little tiny
[1:09:39] things he says and you've omitted the
[1:09:41] weightier matters of the law and what
[1:09:43] did he say those were judgment mercy and
[1:09:46] faith
[1:09:48] they kept the the letter of the law but
[1:09:50] they could not apply the law properly
[1:09:52] they didn't have proper judgment they
[1:09:54] didn't show Mercy he says you go and you
[1:09:56] take widow's houses for Pete's sake
[1:09:58] you take from people that can't afford
[1:10:00] to to give in those situations
[1:10:03] you you use the law to take something
[1:10:05] from somebody that you know full well
[1:10:06] deserves to hold on to that
[1:10:09] and he says what you're everyone you're
[1:10:11] Vipers
[1:10:14] you're no good you don't have what you
[1:10:16] think you have he says you're white at
[1:10:18] sepulchers beautiful on the outside and
[1:10:20] inside you're full of dead men's bones
[1:10:22] why because they got straight A's in the
[1:10:24] word but they didn't have the reality of
[1:10:25] it they didn't have a true revelation of
[1:10:27] what it looked like before
[1:10:28] I've spoken of this before as an
[1:10:30] engineer we come out of University and
[1:10:32] some of us have excellent grades I
[1:10:33] didn't
[1:10:34] and we have all that knowledge
[1:10:36] you could say we have all knowledge in
[1:10:39] our heads
[1:10:40] and then you go into a job and do they
[1:10:42] put us in the position that requires all
[1:10:43] knowledge
[1:10:44] no they put us down at the bottom doing
[1:10:46] the most basic of things
[1:10:48] why because that's all you know how to
[1:10:50] do
[1:10:51] the most basic of things but then what
[1:10:53] did they do they put you under a more
[1:10:55] senior engineer and he or she starts to
[1:10:58] teach you and starts to share their
[1:10:59] information and it's amazing how many
[1:11:01] times you'll work with those senior
[1:11:02] engineers and you and you'll you'll
[1:11:04] relay a theory to them and they don't
[1:11:06] even remember the theory
[1:11:10] they don't remember the theory but you
[1:11:12] ask them how do I do this and they can
[1:11:14] put the theory that they've forgotten
[1:11:15] into action and show you how it really
[1:11:18] works in real life and if we can humble
[1:11:20] ourselves as Engineers to that person
[1:11:22] that doesn't know as much as we know but
[1:11:25] can practically do a hundred thousand
[1:11:27] times more than we can and that's why
[1:11:28] they're paid a hundred thousand times
[1:11:29] more then we'll start to learn and will
[1:11:32] start to grow as an engineer and pretty
[1:11:34] soon we'll start getting promoted why
[1:11:36] because we're able to apply what we know
[1:11:38] rather than just recite what we know I
[1:11:41] remember that when I when I did one of
[1:11:43] my senior projects my final University
[1:11:45] and we had a boyfriend girlfriend
[1:11:47] combination in my team and she ended up
[1:11:50] winning top marks for her graduating
[1:11:52] group for her you know she was civil I
[1:11:54] think he was an Naval architectural or
[1:11:56] something and we got both of them in our
[1:11:58] group and we got to the place in our in
[1:11:59] one of our projects and he said I can't
[1:12:01] figure it out and I don't have time and
[1:12:03] he walked away
[1:12:04] left us hanging
[1:12:06] smartest guy in the class but he
[1:12:08] couldn't even stick out the job
[1:12:10] why it was all up here and he didn't
[1:12:12] have anything in here that would keep
[1:12:14] him going until he could figure it out
[1:12:15] this is what the Tudors were reporting
[1:12:18] about is not just what do they know but
[1:12:20] how do they take it and use it
[1:12:22] how do they apply these things I
[1:12:24] remember a man in Texas and
[1:12:27] he didn't attend church very often it's
[1:12:28] a common theme among these types of
[1:12:30] people and he brought one of his
[1:12:31] converts to church one day and he said
[1:12:33] he's going to be a great preacher he
[1:12:35] knows all the Mysteries he can tell you
[1:12:36] all the things under the Seven Seals he
[1:12:38] just needs the Holy Ghost
[1:12:42] and you sit there and you say what are
[1:12:44] you talking about he's going to be a
[1:12:45] great preacher and he doesn't have the
[1:12:46] Holy Ghost what was he going on what he
[1:12:48] knew
[1:12:49] rather than what he had
[1:12:53] and that boy never amounted to anything
[1:12:54] and neither did that man
[1:12:56] why because they couldn't do the
[1:12:58] simplest of things in their Christian
[1:12:59] walk and yet he wanted to put him up
[1:13:01] into the position of ministry
[1:13:04] no wasn't going to work it was all up
[1:13:06] here and there was nothing in here
[1:13:08] Paul said if I know all Mysteries and
[1:13:11] have the gift of Prophecy and have not
[1:13:12] charity
[1:13:13] which is God's love which is the Holy
[1:13:15] Ghost he says I'm nothing
[1:13:18] what would Paul say if I get straight
[1:13:20] A's and I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:24] I'm it that's it nothing not even worth
[1:13:26] talking about
[1:13:27] listen to this brother Brown says love
[1:13:30] God's love it'll take the place of
[1:13:33] speaking in tongues and that's all right
[1:13:35] it'll take the place of gifts and
[1:13:37] wonders and signs and everything else if
[1:13:41] you haven't got love that accompanies
[1:13:43] that what good does the signs do you
[1:13:45] God's tried to do it across the nation
[1:13:47] but it wouldn't work the greatest of all
[1:13:49] gifts is wisdom he says the second is
[1:13:51] knowledge if you haven't got wisdom to
[1:13:54] control your knowledge what goods your
[1:13:56] knowledge going to do
[1:13:57] see what I mean he said seek the first
[1:14:00] things first
[1:14:03] you can't seek CEO when you're just the
[1:14:07] new engineer in the building
[1:14:09] no seek to be the first engineer
[1:14:12] the lowly engineer
[1:14:14] and then seek the junior engineer
[1:14:15] position then the senior engineer
[1:14:17] position then the chief engineer
[1:14:19] position then the head of r d and work
[1:14:21] your way up he says seek the first
[1:14:22] things first get it in the right order
[1:14:24] and you'll come out okay
[1:14:26] get it in the right order don't seek to
[1:14:28] skip
[1:14:29] you know they um there's a couple
[1:14:31] students in in schools and they they
[1:14:34] they're very they're very intelligent
[1:14:36] and what they do is oftentimes they'll
[1:14:38] let them skip a class you know what
[1:14:39] often happens it's to their disadvantage
[1:14:42] because they aren't mature enough to
[1:14:43] handle that next step they have the
[1:14:46] knowledge to step up and skip a class
[1:14:48] but they don't have the maturity to step
[1:14:50] up into another realm of community
[1:14:54] and so in the end it hurts them because
[1:14:56] they're jumping they're skipping
[1:14:57] something about not to
[1:14:59] he says so what I mean seek the first
[1:15:01] things first we've gone after gifts
[1:15:02] we've gone after this we've gone after
[1:15:03] that because the Supernatural is done he
[1:15:06] said but brother don't see gifts don't
[1:15:08] seek favor with denomination he says
[1:15:10] seek the love of God and then he says do
[1:15:13] it Brethren as I said before there isn't
[1:15:15] a doctoral test enter Heaven the holy
[1:15:18] spirit's the one that's going to lead us
[1:15:19] and brother Brown is here is saying he's
[1:15:21] saying get the first things first do it
[1:15:22] in the order that God said you're
[1:15:24] supposed to do it
[1:15:25] and then move on from there and God will
[1:15:27] lead you and he'll progress you as you
[1:15:29] what truly learn these different things
[1:15:33] as we're coming into this idea of
[1:15:34] adoption then adoption is a reflection
[1:15:37] of two things wisdom
[1:15:39] and character
[1:15:41] wisdom and character now what is wisdom
[1:15:44] wisdom is knowledge applied correctly
[1:15:48] and character is a victory
[1:15:52] character is a victory character is when
[1:15:54] you are put to the test in real life and
[1:15:57] you apply what you learn in a way
[1:15:58] properly regardless of how it feels
[1:16:01] regardless of how it looks regardless of
[1:16:02] pressure regardless of what people want
[1:16:04] you to do you'll do what's right no
[1:16:06] matter what that's what character is and
[1:16:08] that's the victory because you've got to
[1:16:09] sacrifice everything that this body
[1:16:11] wants to what the word says for you to
[1:16:13] do
[1:16:15] he says and then the father after he had
[1:16:17] given the tutors the rights to raise his
[1:16:18] son the tutor had to bring word to the
[1:16:21] father how the son was progressing he
[1:16:23] says now Yeti was there of all things
[1:16:24] but yet he didn't come into legal
[1:16:27] possession until there was a ceremony
[1:16:30] you say well I got to get to the
[1:16:31] ceremony brother John he says and he had
[1:16:34] fully done
[1:16:36] fully done
[1:16:38] that which was right and was worthy
[1:16:41] remember when Jesus talked about he says
[1:16:43] a man had two sons and he said to the
[1:16:45] one he said go and work in the vineyard
[1:16:47] and the son said I'll go do it and then
[1:16:49] he didn't do it and then he said to the
[1:16:51] second son go do and the son said I
[1:16:52] won't do it
[1:16:53] but then he went and did it and he said
[1:16:55] which one loved the Father the one that
[1:16:56] said it or the one that did it and they
[1:16:58] said the one that did it
[1:17:00] so he's talking about here have you
[1:17:01] fully done
[1:17:02] have you done exactly what he said not
[1:17:04] just in part because remember Saul was
[1:17:06] 95 correct Saul was 95 percent as before
[1:17:09] I said he was 95 in the will of God but
[1:17:12] that five percent that he left undone
[1:17:14] was what took him out and God said I've
[1:17:16] taken the kingdom away from you because
[1:17:17] you won't fully do what I've asked you
[1:17:19] to do
[1:17:20] so adoption is based in on what you do
[1:17:23] with what you know
[1:17:24] so the first test is he says do you know
[1:17:26] what you've been taught can you recite
[1:17:28] it
[1:17:28] can you repeat truth back to me
[1:17:31] and then the second test is can you
[1:17:34] apply the truth that you know
[1:17:36] I I think I'm going to resonate with a
[1:17:38] lot of people here when I say most
[1:17:39] people do okay with math as long as the
[1:17:42] equations are written out for you you
[1:17:44] can resolve an equation you can figure
[1:17:45] out mathematics as long as it's written
[1:17:47] out for you but where do most of us fall
[1:17:49] flat on our face
[1:17:50] those stupid word problems
[1:17:53] right because they say if if Bob has
[1:17:56] three apples and Susie has two apples
[1:17:58] and the train they're on is running 90
[1:18:00] miles an hour what time is it in Tokyo
[1:18:04] that's what it sounds like to us doesn't
[1:18:06] it that's not what that's not what it
[1:18:08] says but that's as strange as it seems
[1:18:09] to us and we say what in the world am I
[1:18:11] supposed to do with this now and
[1:18:14] everything you need to solve that that
[1:18:15] word problem has been given you already
[1:18:19] but you don't know how to apply it
[1:18:21] so what good was the knowledge they
[1:18:23] taught you
[1:18:24] unless you can apply it
[1:18:26] I remember I was I was in a
[1:18:28] jack-in-the-box which is a fast food
[1:18:29] restaurant in Texas and a a kid came in
[1:18:31] he was 16 about 16 years old I would
[1:18:33] imagine he came in and he said how much
[1:18:36] is that meal and they said it's uh six
[1:18:38] dollars and they said plus tax and he
[1:18:41] said how much is tax six and a half
[1:18:42] percent so he said about a dollar fifty
[1:18:44] then
[1:18:46] no no that'd be about 38 cents you know
[1:18:49] but he couldn't do it in his head he
[1:18:51] couldn't his concept of percentages
[1:18:54] hadn't translated into real world
[1:18:56] ability to to handle these things
[1:18:59] this is what the test of the sum was is
[1:19:01] can you now take it and apply it
[1:19:04] and then after you have learned how to
[1:19:07] apply it the question is will you apply
[1:19:10] it
[1:19:11] because you can say well I know math and
[1:19:13] I figured out the word problem but will
[1:19:15] you apply it will you go work in a
[1:19:16] cashier position and you can do it on
[1:19:18] the fly now and you can handle all of
[1:19:20] that in your head and somebody gives you
[1:19:21] two dollars and it's a dollar seventy
[1:19:23] six and you've got to come up with 24
[1:19:25] cents change in your hand like that
[1:19:27] can you do it and will you do it but the
[1:19:29] test for the sun now was would he do it
[1:19:32] when it was difficult to do it
[1:19:34] would he do it when everything in him
[1:19:36] screamed I don't want to do it
[1:19:38] and yet the father's tutor said this is
[1:19:40] what you have to do and this is the
[1:19:42] Father's will and this is what you're
[1:19:43] supposed to go into amen
[1:19:46] it can't be just head knowledge for us
[1:19:48] look at this James says this I've been
[1:19:50] reading James in in uh in my devotions
[1:19:53] these mornings and James is a rough
[1:19:56] character boy
[1:19:57] James didn't suffer fools gladly I think
[1:19:59] he had a bit of German in him he called
[1:20:01] it the way he saw it
[1:20:02] and this is what the tutor's doing the
[1:20:04] tutor calls it the way he sees it
[1:20:07] he's not there to to gloss over it or
[1:20:09] make things look better
[1:20:10] James says this in in 121 he says
[1:20:13] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[1:20:16] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[1:20:18] with meekness the engrafted word which
[1:20:21] is able to save your souls he says and
[1:20:23] be ye doers of the word and not hearers
[1:20:26] only deceiving your own selves notice
[1:20:28] here you don't deceive anybody else
[1:20:31] when you're a hearer but not a doer the
[1:20:33] only one that's deceived is you because
[1:20:34] everybody can look at your life and say
[1:20:36] he or she talks one way and they live
[1:20:38] another way and they're not fooled
[1:20:40] you might fool people for a little bit
[1:20:42] but you won't fool them for very long if
[1:20:44] you say one thing and do another so
[1:20:46] James is saying the only person that's
[1:20:47] deceived here is you you're
[1:20:48] self-deceived if you hear but you don't
[1:20:51] do
[1:20:52] amen but he says for if any watch how he
[1:20:54] explains this now he's Paul's trying to
[1:20:55] help us or James trying to help us
[1:20:56] understand this he says for if any be a
[1:20:58] hearer of the word and not a doer he's
[1:21:01] like a man beholding his natural face in
[1:21:03] a glass for he beholds himself and goes
[1:21:05] his way and straightway forgets what
[1:21:07] manner of man he was so he's saying a
[1:21:10] person that is a hero but not a doer is
[1:21:11] like a person that looks in a mirror and
[1:21:14] they look and they say yup everything's
[1:21:15] okay everything's good and they turn and
[1:21:18] walk away and they forget what they even
[1:21:20] look like they forget is my tie on
[1:21:22] straight is something crooked you know
[1:21:25] is my hair out of place and so they've
[1:21:26] got to keep coming back to the mirror to
[1:21:28] remember what they look like because it
[1:21:30] hasn't been absorbed in them and he says
[1:21:32] what happens when you're a hearer but
[1:21:34] not a doer is there's no life inside of
[1:21:36] you so you have to keep coming back to
[1:21:37] the mirror to check do I look like a
[1:21:40] Christian do I act like a Christian
[1:21:42] because there's not something inside of
[1:21:44] you that's driving it so you keep coming
[1:21:45] back to appearance because appearance is
[1:21:48] all you have because you're a hearer and
[1:21:50] not a doer and so what you're having to
[1:21:51] do is you're having to keep coming back
[1:21:53] and you keep having to say what does a
[1:21:55] Christian act like what does a Christian
[1:21:56] look like what does a Christian do what
[1:21:59] does a Christian say because as soon as
[1:22:00] you walk away you forget it as soon as
[1:22:02] you walk out of church you forget what
[1:22:04] it's supposed to be because the Life of
[1:22:05] Christ is not in You by the Holy Spirit
[1:22:09] that's what James is saying here is when
[1:22:11] you're here is there's nothing in you to
[1:22:13] drive it
[1:22:14] and so you walk away and you instantly
[1:22:16] forget what it is you are supposed to be
[1:22:19] it's like the parable of the sower in
[1:22:21] Matthew 13 and Jesus is talking about it
[1:22:23] and that parable of the sower he puts
[1:22:24] seed all over the place
[1:22:26] and sometimes we can sit here and we can
[1:22:28] say well what was the seed he said it
[1:22:29] was the word of God and he says and and
[1:22:31] the the ground was different people's
[1:22:33] lives and so what happens so often is we
[1:22:36] say well the word is all over my life
[1:22:37] there's seed all over my life therefore
[1:22:39] I must be a good field
[1:22:41] but no he's just throwing seed
[1:22:44] and so just because their seed there
[1:22:45] doesn't mean that your your life is
[1:22:47] ready for the word of God because
[1:22:49] remember there were seed all over the
[1:22:50] rocky ground
[1:22:52] and somebody could go and say look I
[1:22:53] found a field and this is going to be
[1:22:54] wonderful no that's Rocky ground it's no
[1:22:57] good and what happens is the field is
[1:22:59] where what the seed grows and matures
[1:23:02] not where the seed lands
[1:23:04] remember scripture talks about that they
[1:23:06] throw out a net and they get all sorts
[1:23:08] of things Wrigley things and squiggly
[1:23:10] things and things they don't want and
[1:23:11] what do they do with everything in that
[1:23:13] net that Fisherman's Net that they they
[1:23:14] pulled in they take what they want and
[1:23:16] they throw the rest out just because
[1:23:18] you're caught in the net doesn't mean
[1:23:20] you're a child of God and just because
[1:23:22] you're sitting under the preaching of
[1:23:23] the word does not mean you're a child of
[1:23:24] God or you're an adopted son of God
[1:23:26] potentially you are
[1:23:28] but the proof is going to be in how you
[1:23:30] act not in what you say not just in what
[1:23:32] you say let me put it that way
[1:23:35] remember Jesus said that those those
[1:23:36] people that had Rocky ground he says
[1:23:39] they have received the word with Joy
[1:23:41] happily
[1:23:43] they were happy they sat under the
[1:23:45] preacher the word they said praise the
[1:23:46] Lord hallelujah that was so good and
[1:23:48] then he said what happens is cares of
[1:23:50] life and trials and persecutions arise
[1:23:52] and they're offended and they walk away
[1:23:55] he says and it's like the sun coming
[1:23:56] down and burning it right out of their
[1:23:58] life it has no root and therefore it
[1:24:00] can't live through those times
[1:24:02] what am I saying this for because we
[1:24:04] can't be judged just by how we accept
[1:24:06] the word
[1:24:07] because if we accept it up here and it
[1:24:08] doesn't go in here and live then it
[1:24:10] didn't it wasn't accepted in the first
[1:24:11] place
[1:24:13] amen
[1:24:16] we judge ourselves by how we Act
[1:24:18] not by how we talk
[1:24:21] and that's what the tutor was doing was
[1:24:23] he wasn't just there to say your son
[1:24:24] talks right he was there to say your son
[1:24:26] acts right he thinks the way you do
[1:24:29] and then he puts it into action the same
[1:24:30] way you do
[1:24:31] listen if we're if we're going to be you
[1:24:34] know easy time Christians
[1:24:36] we're not going to grow we're not going
[1:24:37] to mature
[1:24:39] listen we sing that song in the good
[1:24:41] times praise His name and the bad times
[1:24:43] do the same in everything give the King
[1:24:45] of Kings all the praise that's what it
[1:24:47] looks like to be a real Christians
[1:24:48] whether the size or the skies are Sunny
[1:24:50] like they've been for the last few days
[1:24:52] praise the Lord or whether they've been
[1:24:53] cloudy which they were for the last few
[1:24:55] months
[1:24:56] praise the Lord anyways
[1:24:58] that's the way it's got to be in our
[1:24:59] lives amen whether it's good or bad
[1:25:01] we've got to say the tutor is here
[1:25:03] and he's bringing me to a place and he's
[1:25:05] got me in a position where I'll learn to
[1:25:07] be what God wants me to be
[1:25:10] how many children here are tired of
[1:25:12] going to school
[1:25:14] one wow three
[1:25:18] we get tired don't we
[1:25:20] we get tired of getting up in the
[1:25:21] morning
[1:25:22] and putting on the same clothes and
[1:25:25] going to the same place and hearing the
[1:25:27] same teachers say the same things with
[1:25:30] the same people that half of them Annoy
[1:25:32] Us
[1:25:33] day in and day out day in and day out
[1:25:36] most people don't enjoy going to school
[1:25:39] and then what do they do when they're
[1:25:40] done teaching you in the classroom they
[1:25:42] take you out in the gym for phys Ed and
[1:25:44] they run you around until you're ragged
[1:25:46] right and you sit there and you say
[1:25:50] I'm not an athlete I'm never going to be
[1:25:53] an athlete why do I have to do it do
[1:25:55] this why do they do it
[1:25:57] why they do it young people for your
[1:25:59] good
[1:25:59] because they know that it's not just
[1:26:00] enough to exercise up here you got to
[1:26:02] exercise physically you've got to have a
[1:26:04] well-rounded education you've got to be
[1:26:06] pushed in ways you don't want to be
[1:26:08] pushed so you'll grow and mature because
[1:26:10] when you come into life later and you've
[1:26:11] got to get up every morning for work
[1:26:14] you'll have learned hey I did that in
[1:26:16] school
[1:26:17] and in school they made you do it but
[1:26:19] now you've got to come to the place
[1:26:20] where you're willing to do it because
[1:26:21] you've seen the benefit of what that
[1:26:23] commitment and that consistency brought
[1:26:24] you in those places what they're doing
[1:26:26] is preparing you for real life
[1:26:29] whether you like it or not
[1:26:31] that's what the parents are doing aren't
[1:26:32] they
[1:26:34] that's why we have to eat broccoli
[1:26:42] spinach
[1:26:43] brussels sprouts
[1:26:46] all these things
[1:26:48] from the lower regions
[1:26:51] because it's good for us
[1:26:54] better for us than what we'd want to eat
[1:26:56] that's what the tutor is doing is he's
[1:26:58] feeding us
[1:26:59] things that will make us what God wants
[1:27:01] us to be even if we don't like it right
[1:27:03] now
[1:27:04] but listen you'll like it in the end
[1:27:07] you'll like the benefits
[1:27:09] you won't like it
[1:27:11] nobody likes the breaking and the
[1:27:12] molding process
[1:27:14] nobody likes eating yucky vegetables
[1:27:16] if they're yucky to them
[1:27:19] but in the end you're really happy with
[1:27:21] how it turns out
[1:27:23] and that's how you learn that you can't
[1:27:25] go with what you want all the time and
[1:27:26] come out the way God wants you to you're
[1:27:28] going to have to go through tough times
[1:27:29] you're going to have to go through rough
[1:27:30] times
[1:27:35] he said God is looking for character
[1:27:38] from men and women who can what conduct
[1:27:41] themselves as Sons and Daughters of the
[1:27:44] king
[1:27:45] conduct
[1:27:47] God have mercy on us that we will do it
[1:27:49] that's what I'm after friends as
[1:27:51] character that's what God is pulling for
[1:27:53] is character for that bride that will be
[1:27:55] taken out and as Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:57] God he says let's act like it be Sons
[1:28:00] and Daughters God help us so the final
[1:28:03] test is not can you recite
[1:28:06] or can you apply
[1:28:08] but will you apply it in your day-to-day
[1:28:11] life and that's what character looks
[1:28:13] like is will you apply what the tutor
[1:28:15] has taught you in your everyday life
[1:28:16] amen how do we act when the tough
[1:28:18] decisions arrive
[1:28:19] how do we act when money gets short how
[1:28:21] do we act when we get sick how do we act
[1:28:23] when the job seems like it's not going
[1:28:25] so well how do we act when we're feeling
[1:28:27] unsatisfied
[1:28:29] how do we act when our relationships
[1:28:31] aren't so good how do we act when things
[1:28:32] just aren't the way that we thought they
[1:28:34] ought to be that's how we show our
[1:28:36] character everybody's a sunny day
[1:28:38] Christian
[1:28:40] very few people are rainy day Christians
[1:28:42] especially when it rains and rains and
[1:28:45] rains the year I moved to BC in February
[1:28:47] we had 27 out of 28 days had rain
[1:28:51] that's worse than Newfoundland
[1:28:54] 27 out of 28 days had rain do you know
[1:28:56] how hard it is to go out every day and
[1:28:58] have rain rain rain rain
[1:29:00] and sometimes we go through times in
[1:29:02] life and all it is is rain
[1:29:05] and guess what there's a purpose for it
[1:29:07] there's a purpose for it because we have
[1:29:09] to be content no matter where we find
[1:29:11] ourselves in life
[1:29:12] and sometimes God got to bring us to a
[1:29:13] place where we're not content so we can
[1:29:15] understand what true Godly contentment
[1:29:16] looks like amen
[1:29:20] when we'll take it and we come up to the
[1:29:22] line and and we've got to make a
[1:29:24] decision brother Joe was sharing some
[1:29:25] things with work and challenges he's
[1:29:27] facing
[1:29:28] listen we got to put our livelihoods on
[1:29:31] the line
[1:29:31] our reputations on the line our
[1:29:34] financial well-being on the line even
[1:29:35] our physical and mental health on the
[1:29:37] line constantly as Believers and say
[1:29:39] Lord whatever I have is because you've
[1:29:41] given it and it's you that preserves
[1:29:43] it's you that gives it's you that
[1:29:45] provides and I'll put it on the line
[1:29:47] every single time because I've seen you
[1:29:49] come back and give it to me time and
[1:29:51] time and time again
[1:29:53] speaking of this son
[1:29:56] because there's a report card that's
[1:29:57] going out for each one of us and it's a
[1:29:59] full spectrum card it's not just
[1:30:01] knowledge it's not just application but
[1:30:03] it's the way you live and act every
[1:30:04] single day of your life amen and when we
[1:30:06] get to the place where that report card
[1:30:08] reads Christ Christ Christ Christ Christ
[1:30:10] Christ
[1:30:12] that's when he says now you're ready son
[1:30:14] now you're ready daughter to step up
[1:30:16] into your Kingdom Purpose speaking of
[1:30:18] that type of person he said how he likes
[1:30:21] to be about the father's business
[1:30:23] how he likes to eat brussels sprouts
[1:30:27] how he likes to do the things that he
[1:30:29] used to not like to do
[1:30:31] remember I shared that story how my wife
[1:30:32] I think it was on a Saturday night
[1:30:35] and and and she said um or we had to do
[1:30:38] something first thing in the morning go
[1:30:39] on a trip and she said by the way
[1:30:40] there's no gas in the van and it was
[1:30:42] howling wind and it was raining it was
[1:30:44] stormy and it was horrible it was 10 30
[1:30:46] at night
[1:30:48] and I was upset because it's 10 30 at
[1:30:50] night and I want to go to bed instead I
[1:30:52] got to put all my clothes back on and go
[1:30:53] out and gas up the van in horrible
[1:30:55] weather
[1:30:56] but then something said you're a man
[1:30:58] you're a husband
[1:31:01] put on your big boy boots and do what
[1:31:03] men do
[1:31:05] and it's not so much that I enjoyed
[1:31:07] standing out in the wind and the rain
[1:31:08] and these things but you know what
[1:31:10] there's something that comes from doing
[1:31:11] what you're supposed to do that brings a
[1:31:13] sense of contentment and fulfillment
[1:31:16] even when it's tough
[1:31:19] and sometimes what happens then is God
[1:31:21] will allow you to have that for the fun
[1:31:23] times not just for the work times
[1:31:25] because when you can deal with that bad
[1:31:27] weather for the things that really
[1:31:28] matter then it means you can go out and
[1:31:30] hunt in the mountains and deal with bad
[1:31:31] weather and enjoy it because you built
[1:31:34] up that resilience to the place where
[1:31:35] you say this is what it means to be a
[1:31:37] man this is what it means to be a mother
[1:31:39] this is and you can actually Relish in
[1:31:41] the idea that you're doing what you're
[1:31:43] supposed to do and you've withstood the
[1:31:44] rigor and you've gone through the
[1:31:45] training so you can actually step up to
[1:31:47] the plate and do what most people will
[1:31:49] run away from every time
[1:31:51] you'll get to the place where you
[1:31:53] actually enjoy doing work
[1:31:57] he says he likes to be about the
[1:31:59] father's business how he loves to do the
[1:32:01] things that the father likes for him to
[1:32:03] do oh how the tutor would come to the
[1:32:05] father and say Sir oh I bring you great
[1:32:07] news your boy he's just a chip off the
[1:32:10] old block he's just like his daddy he
[1:32:13] says well that's the way the Holy Spirit
[1:32:14] wants to bring it when you believe all
[1:32:16] of God's word when you accept the full
[1:32:18] gosp the whole full gospel when you
[1:32:21] believe in everything God wrote that
[1:32:23] it's the truth God wants you to believe
[1:32:25] it that way then how the father must
[1:32:27] swell his chest out and say yes that's
[1:32:29] my boy and what happened then later on
[1:32:32] there came a time when that father
[1:32:34] adopted that child into the family he
[1:32:36] said or do you clergyman there's the
[1:32:38] placing of a son is what I'm speaking of
[1:32:39] and he adopted his own child or placed
[1:32:42] him positionally in his family now he
[1:32:45] was just a boy to begin with he says
[1:32:46] they had to find out what his character
[1:32:49] was
[1:32:51] that's what this whole thing was about
[1:32:52] is does he have character
[1:32:55] to handle what's coming his way
[1:32:58] because maybe his father owned a
[1:32:59] multi-million dollar business and if you
[1:33:01] don't have character the first thing
[1:33:02] you're going to do when you get that
[1:33:03] checkbook is go write a check for a
[1:33:05] Lamborghini
[1:33:07] or to give yourself a big flashy office
[1:33:10] or to wear fancy clothes or to buy a big
[1:33:13] house and that's not what the father got
[1:33:14] it for you that's not why he gave it to
[1:33:16] you he gave it to you so you could grow
[1:33:18] the business
[1:33:19] and stay humble
[1:33:21] and be a reflection of the things that
[1:33:23] are right in life not just the things
[1:33:24] that we want in life and these different
[1:33:26] things
[1:33:27] like I said I've been reading James and
[1:33:29] my devotions and and he's so Direct
[1:33:33] if I could put it that way James didn't
[1:33:34] pull any punches James would say it the
[1:33:37] way he was and he'd say look if you lack
[1:33:39] something in your character
[1:33:41] don't hide it
[1:33:43] it's a go and ask God who gives
[1:33:46] liberally
[1:33:47] liberally
[1:33:49] more than you need more than you want
[1:33:51] all you have to say is I lack something
[1:33:53] and he'll give you what you need
[1:33:55] but he doesn't just give it to you like
[1:33:57] he does a download into your brain of
[1:33:59] wisdom or something but he puts you in
[1:34:01] situations catch it he puts you in
[1:34:03] situations to apply the thing that you
[1:34:05] kept failing before
[1:34:07] and that's how he gives it to you is by
[1:34:09] experience
[1:34:12] don't ever pray for patience because God
[1:34:14] will put you in the situation that
[1:34:15] requires patience
[1:34:17] to prove you've got it to prove that you
[1:34:19] can endure to prove that you can have
[1:34:21] the right action and the reaction those
[1:34:22] different things and James is saying
[1:34:24] don't hold back because you don't have
[1:34:25] it ask God admit you don't have it admit
[1:34:28] you need it and watch him do it because
[1:34:29] that's the kind of God he is because
[1:34:31] he'll give you tutors and governors to
[1:34:33] raise you to the standard that he
[1:34:35] requires for what you're trying to do in
[1:34:36] your life according to his will remember
[1:34:39] but James would say this he'd say what
[1:34:41] does it profit my brethren though a man
[1:34:44] say he had faith and have not works can
[1:34:47] Faith save him if a brother or sister be
[1:34:49] naked in destitute of daily food and one
[1:34:52] of you say unto them depart and peace be
[1:34:54] warmed and filled notwithstanding you
[1:34:56] give them not those things that are
[1:34:58] needful to the body what does it profit
[1:34:59] so he said somebody comes to you with a
[1:35:01] need and they don't have the they're not
[1:35:03] going to come truly naked but they come
[1:35:05] and they need clothes maybe they need a
[1:35:07] winter jacket maybe their kids don't
[1:35:09] have boots for the winter and they say I
[1:35:11] have that or I'm hungry he says you
[1:35:13] don't say be thou warm praise the Lord
[1:35:16] sister
[1:35:18] he says what are you talking about
[1:35:19] that's nonsense that's silliness he says
[1:35:22] give them what they need of because you
[1:35:23] got what they need so give it to him he
[1:35:25] says your faith is not the Lord will
[1:35:27] provide the the faith is the Lord has
[1:35:29] provided me to give to you
[1:35:31] I remember a story about brother Perry
[1:35:33] green and the deacons came to him in a
[1:35:35] group and they said you know brother
[1:35:36] so-and-so has a financial need and we
[1:35:39] came to you so we could all pray as a
[1:35:40] group and brother Perry said is it a
[1:35:43] real need
[1:35:44] yes is it a genuine need yes he says why
[1:35:48] will we pray about it he says open up
[1:35:50] your wallets and open up your checkbooks
[1:35:51] and let's take care of the need
[1:35:53] why because he'd read James that said if
[1:35:56] a brother has need then you give it to
[1:35:57] him
[1:35:58] but he's got to be a brother indeed it's
[1:36:00] got to be a sister indeed it can't be
[1:36:02] somebody that's running around wasting
[1:36:03] all their money or doing these things
[1:36:04] but if it's a real and genuine need
[1:36:06] through no fault of their own
[1:36:08] he says then you provide it
[1:36:11] what was he saying to the deacons he
[1:36:12] says you're so spiritual you're of no
[1:36:14] earthly good in this case
[1:36:16] he says if God has blessed you that much
[1:36:18] he says put your faith where your mouth
[1:36:20] is and give him what you have need and
[1:36:22] Trust the god that gave it to you in the
[1:36:24] first place will restore to you what you
[1:36:25] need on the back end
[1:36:27] write your check out and use your faith
[1:36:30] to meet their need and watch God meet
[1:36:31] yours on the back end if you need it
[1:36:33] that's what James is talking about he
[1:36:35] would say even so faith
[1:36:37] if it had not works is dead being alone
[1:36:41] yeah a man may say thou has faith and I
[1:36:43] have Works show me thy faith without thy
[1:36:45] work so in other words James is saying
[1:36:47] prove your faith without doing something
[1:36:49] he says you can because that doesn't
[1:36:51] make sense faith without action is not
[1:36:53] faith in the first place
[1:36:55] Faith puts you into action
[1:37:00] he says you do that he says and I will
[1:37:02] show you my faith by my Works he says
[1:37:04] I'll prove I've got the faith he says
[1:37:06] that you don't think I have by doing
[1:37:08] what you can't and won't do
[1:37:10] he says you got faith but you won't do
[1:37:12] the thing that I'm about to do and my
[1:37:14] what I'm about to do shows that I have
[1:37:15] faith that you don't think I have you're
[1:37:17] looking at me and you're saying well you
[1:37:18] don't have faith you don't have faith he
[1:37:20] says my actions prove I've got more
[1:37:21] faith than you do because all you do is
[1:37:22] talk and all I do is act
[1:37:25] like I said James was a sharp individual
[1:37:28] didn't suffer spiritual fools gladly
[1:37:30] he says Thou believe is that there is
[1:37:32] one God thou doest well
[1:37:34] you know the doctrines you know the the
[1:37:36] truth of the of the word of an open Word
[1:37:38] of the scriptures that have been
[1:37:39] revealed he says Thou thou doest well
[1:37:43] the Devils also believe in tremble
[1:37:45] in other words Satan believes everything
[1:37:47] you believe
[1:37:49] so don't rest on what you believe as the
[1:37:51] be-all and end-all of your Christian
[1:37:52] walk
[1:37:54] he says but wilt thou know o vain man
[1:37:57] that faith without works is dead
[1:37:59] knowledge without faith to live it or
[1:38:01] put it into action he says his vanity
[1:38:03] is Vanity and that's what you'll find
[1:38:05] like I talked about that engineer his
[1:38:07] knowledge was vanity because when push
[1:38:09] came to shove and he couldn't figure it
[1:38:11] out he walked away
[1:38:12] he wasn't committed to actually taking
[1:38:14] it all the way into learning and
[1:38:16] applying it until he got the solution he
[1:38:18] needed James said the same way faith
[1:38:20] without works is dead was not Abraham
[1:38:23] Our Father justified by works when he
[1:38:25] had offered Isaac his son upon the altar
[1:38:28] he says seeth Thou how Faith wrought
[1:38:30] with his works and by works was made
[1:38:32] perfect I went in the Amplified to to
[1:38:34] understand this he says James said do
[1:38:36] you see that his faith was cooperating
[1:38:38] with his works
[1:38:40] and his faith was completed and reached
[1:38:43] its Supreme expression when he
[1:38:45] implemented it by good works so in other
[1:38:48] words when Abraham took what he had up
[1:38:50] here or what he had in here by faith and
[1:38:53] put it into action he says that was the
[1:38:55] full expression of his faith because he
[1:38:57] was willing to put his child's life on
[1:38:59] the line because he believed that God
[1:39:00] would raise him up from the dead that
[1:39:02] was the proof of his faith was when he
[1:39:04] put it into action when he put it into
[1:39:05] works
[1:39:06] he says and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:39:08] which says Abraham believed God what was
[1:39:11] the proof of Abraham's belief that he
[1:39:13] said he believed no that he laid Isaac
[1:39:16] on the Altar and was willing to kill him
[1:39:18] at God's command believing that God
[1:39:20] would raise him up because Isaac was the
[1:39:22] child of promise and the nation had to
[1:39:24] come through Isaac
[1:39:25] he says it was imputed unto him for
[1:39:28] righteousness and he was called the
[1:39:30] friend of God what when he believed God
[1:39:32] and put it into action that's where
[1:39:34] righteousness was imputed to him
[1:39:36] he says you see then how that by works a
[1:39:38] man is Justified and not by faith only
[1:39:41] the Amplified says you see that a man is
[1:39:43] Justified or pronounced righteous before
[1:39:45] God through what he does and not alone
[1:39:48] through faith so don't throw Faith out
[1:39:50] the window
[1:39:51] but he says it's not just Faith you
[1:39:53] can't just say I have faith therefore I
[1:39:55] am righteous before God he says no
[1:39:57] through what he does and not alone
[1:39:58] through faith through works of obedience
[1:40:00] as well as by what he believes now I
[1:40:03] want to explain this a minute because
[1:40:04] otherwise what you'll do is you'll go
[1:40:05] the other side and you'll say by works
[1:40:07] I'm going to make it
[1:40:09] that's a lie from the pit of Hell that
[1:40:11] is alive from the pit of Hell by grace
[1:40:13] through faith are you saved I've got the
[1:40:14] scripture here in a second but what
[1:40:16] James is saying that what he's saying
[1:40:18] here is that sheep produce wool
[1:40:21] if you eat like a sheep if you walk like
[1:40:24] a sheep if you look like a sheep
[1:40:26] then you're going to produce wool and
[1:40:29] what he's saying is if you just say
[1:40:30] you're a sheep but you never produce
[1:40:31] wool there's something wrong because
[1:40:33] sheep always produce wool so if you do
[1:40:36] all the things that are that sheep do
[1:40:38] and you are a sheep you'll produce wool
[1:40:40] but if you do all the things that a
[1:40:41] sheep does but you aren't a sheep you'll
[1:40:43] never produce wool no matter how hard
[1:40:44] you try but he said the proof is in the
[1:40:46] wool not in the fact that you're saying
[1:40:47] you're a sheep
[1:40:49] because he would say this in Ephesians 2
[1:40:51] 8 for by grace are you saved and we'd
[1:40:53] say hallelujah praise the lord it's a
[1:40:54] Grace work it's a Grace work but he says
[1:40:57] no by grace are you saved through faith
[1:41:00] through faith and that not of yourselves
[1:41:02] it is the gift of God James is saying
[1:41:04] God has saved you by grace and that
[1:41:06] Grace is accompanied by something it's
[1:41:09] accompanied by faith and that isn't just
[1:41:11] Faith to take you into the water and
[1:41:13] have you baptized and have you Justified
[1:41:14] and Sanctified but he says it's a faith
[1:41:16] that keeps growing and growing and
[1:41:18] moving and moving you until you come
[1:41:20] into the statue of a perfect man in
[1:41:22] Christ Jesus it's a faith that comes to
[1:41:24] take you from the start to the Finish
[1:41:27] that's the faith that he's talking about
[1:41:28] it's a faith that makes you a child of
[1:41:30] God that makes you produce the very life
[1:41:32] of God inside of you that comes out
[1:41:34] where it's not just in your head or in
[1:41:36] your mouth but it is an actual Living
[1:41:38] Faith
[1:41:39] it is character if we could put it that
[1:41:42] way amen listen God doesn't give us
[1:41:44] Grace just so we can be justified as if
[1:41:47] we never did anything in the first place
[1:41:49] Sanctified so we're cleaned up so we can
[1:41:51] sit here and be a Sanctified lump
[1:41:54] what good is a Sanctified lump
[1:41:57] without life you're no good
[1:42:01] get all cleaned up and then God won't
[1:42:03] use you because you're too what
[1:42:06] lazy
[1:42:07] to step forward
[1:42:09] you won't let faith produce its perfect
[1:42:12] work
[1:42:14] you hold back because you're satisfied
[1:42:16] because your conscience is clean and
[1:42:19] your life is clean and that's all you
[1:42:21] really needed in the first place
[1:42:23] but he says no it's got to take you all
[1:42:25] the way to you start producing God in
[1:42:26] your very own life
[1:42:28] God wants to get us in a position where
[1:42:30] we're a benefit for others not just
[1:42:32] accepting his benefits for ourselves
[1:42:34] and that's the life of a true servant
[1:42:37] he says your character is God's
[1:42:39] character
[1:42:40] what is it just a little pushover no sir
[1:42:43] God is a god of judgment he's a god of
[1:42:45] correct I believe he means god of
[1:42:47] correction he says it must be on the
[1:42:49] line it must be straight as a narrow
[1:42:52] it's a Razor's Edge
[1:42:55] it's a Razor's Edge
[1:42:57] you've got to be right on that line he
[1:42:58] says nothing else will do that's the
[1:43:01] kind of character you are why because
[1:43:03] you're the character of your father
[1:43:05] we're going to get into this a little
[1:43:07] bit later the expressed attributes of
[1:43:09] God
[1:43:12] that means you got to have his character
[1:43:15] because that's the only thing that's
[1:43:16] what character is is the attributes of
[1:43:17] God in your life
[1:43:19] he would say you say you see a man's
[1:43:21] characters made known by his works
[1:43:23] whatever you are your Works prove what
[1:43:25] you are no matter how much you testify
[1:43:27] whatever you say Pro con that has
[1:43:30] nothing to do with it your Works tell
[1:43:32] what you are and it tells what you are
[1:43:34] inside
[1:43:36] not your words your works every job you
[1:43:39] do manifest what you are and you do you
[1:43:42] businessmen if you just do a patched up
[1:43:43] job see what I mean just a halfway job
[1:43:45] don't do that if you can't do it right
[1:43:47] don't do it at all that's right and when
[1:43:49] you come to Christ if you can't
[1:43:51] absolutely sell out Lock Stock and
[1:43:53] Barrel and come to Christ he says don't
[1:43:55] come at all but when you really want to
[1:43:58] be a Christian stand out
[1:44:00] make it real that's what God wants you
[1:44:03] to be and that'll prove your Works will
[1:44:06] prove what your character is your
[1:44:09] character is known by The Works that you
[1:44:10] do take it back to Ephesians 2 8 where
[1:44:12] he says for by grace are you saved
[1:44:14] through faith that not of yourself is
[1:44:15] the gift of God what is Paul saying
[1:44:17] there he says Grace is effective
[1:44:21] it does something
[1:44:23] somebody receives Grace there's going to
[1:44:25] be an effect because it's a company with
[1:44:26] faith that takes them from where they
[1:44:28] are to where they ought to be and that's
[1:44:30] what we're resting on him and is that he
[1:44:31] gave us the faith it's not even our
[1:44:33] faith it's the faith of God that he's
[1:44:35] given us to take us through this journey
[1:44:37] amen James is saying you can't have
[1:44:39] faith and then not have works
[1:44:41] just doesn't work that way it's
[1:44:42] impossible he says you can't say you
[1:44:44] have faith and you never step out in
[1:44:46] faith to actually do something to take
[1:44:47] God at his work
[1:44:50] he would finish up in James 2 he says
[1:44:52] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:44:53] dead he says so faith without works is
[1:44:56] dead also so remember we're speaking
[1:44:58] from this adoption standpoint so when we
[1:45:00] say we've learned
[1:45:02] and we say we've understood
[1:45:04] if there's not a change in our life then
[1:45:06] we haven't understood and we haven't
[1:45:07] accepted it the way that it was meant to
[1:45:09] be accepted or learned that's what he's
[1:45:11] saying is you've got to have a change
[1:45:12] here you've got to have works that
[1:45:14] follow that understanding that belief
[1:45:16] that learning that you've gone through
[1:45:17] that truth that you say you have it has
[1:45:19] to be a life-changing experience
[1:45:20] otherwise it's not truth
[1:45:23] as you've accepted it at least it may be
[1:45:25] truth but you haven't accepted it in the
[1:45:26] way that it's really truth brother Brian
[1:45:28] said something along the lines of this
[1:45:29] he says if you really believed it you'd
[1:45:31] live it
[1:45:33] you really believed that you'd live it
[1:45:34] now the thing is this it can't be an act
[1:45:37] that's what the hearers and not doers do
[1:45:39] is they act it out this can't be an act
[1:45:42] but you're going to produce the very
[1:45:43] life of God through your life for other
[1:45:45] people's benefit if you've really got
[1:45:47] what you say you have
[1:45:49] he says our own testimony meets Us in
[1:45:52] the face by the word
[1:45:55] in other words Our Testimony comes up
[1:45:57] and it looks at us and it reflects the
[1:45:59] word in front of us and says is that
[1:46:01] really what you've got
[1:46:02] because it puts the word next to us and
[1:46:04] then it puts us up there and it Compares
[1:46:06] it to and says are they the same thing
[1:46:07] that's what our testimony does he says
[1:46:09] otherwise it just became a routine
[1:46:11] around and around and around and he says
[1:46:13] the father says so we say it too
[1:46:18] be careful now
[1:46:20] he says if you really believe it act
[1:46:23] like it
[1:46:24] so what happens here is it sounds harsh
[1:46:26] but he says if you're a testimony and
[1:46:28] your actions don't line up you've gotten
[1:46:30] into the routine of just repeating what
[1:46:32] was said over the pulpit of just
[1:46:33] repeating what you read in your Bible of
[1:46:36] just repeating what so and so said and
[1:46:38] he says it's not actually hitting the
[1:46:39] mark
[1:46:40] because it's not changing you
[1:46:42] you're just listening and you become a
[1:46:45] parrot
[1:46:46] parrots do not get adopted
[1:46:49] we can't have message parents
[1:46:52] we've got to have true born Sons and
[1:46:54] Daughters of God by the New Birth by the
[1:46:56] indwelling of the holy spirit amen it
[1:46:58] can't be an act it can't be an act it's
[1:47:01] got to be a real nature change amen
[1:47:03] we're talking about a living faith
[1:47:05] that's what character is is a living
[1:47:06] faith amen
[1:47:08] listen this church is not just a
[1:47:10] community of like-minded people
[1:47:14] if it's that word denomination
[1:47:17] I had a co-worker back in Edmonton
[1:47:24] and I gotten to testifying to him about
[1:47:25] different things and and whatnot and he
[1:47:28] said he said John
[1:47:30] I was at my church the other day
[1:47:33] he says and they had a drag show so I'm
[1:47:35] not going to that church anymore I said
[1:47:37] that's a good idea
[1:47:38] he said I want to come to your church
[1:47:41] and you know what I said
[1:47:43] why
[1:47:45] why do you want to go to church he says
[1:47:47] well my wife and I just want a community
[1:47:50] I said I won't say his name I said
[1:47:54] that's not why we go to church
[1:47:56] I said we go to church to be changed we
[1:47:59] go to church to be challenged I said we
[1:48:01] go there to hear what God wants for us
[1:48:03] in our life and I says we do have a
[1:48:05] community I said but it is not a
[1:48:07] community like that I said this is about
[1:48:09] people that are serving a living God
[1:48:11] and it takes a real real effect in their
[1:48:15] life I said it's not a community
[1:48:17] a community like you're talking about
[1:48:20] I didn't say don't come I said that's
[1:48:22] not what you're going to find because
[1:48:24] he'd be uncomfortable here
[1:48:26] because he'd want community
[1:48:28] and what we're looking for is new births
[1:48:30] and Sons and Daughters of God
[1:48:32] we want don't want people that are
[1:48:34] heroes only but doers listen we got to
[1:48:35] have hearers first they got to be a
[1:48:37] hearer first
[1:48:38] because listen if they can even hear it
[1:48:40] that's God working in their life if you
[1:48:42] can even hear it before you've gotten a
[1:48:43] new birth that's God opening up the door
[1:48:45] that's God calling you
[1:48:47] so that's a miracle but if all you want
[1:48:49] is to go in there and not have drag
[1:48:50] shows
[1:48:52] this ain't the place we'll never have a
[1:48:54] drag show but this is not the place for
[1:48:55] that amen this is rubber meets the road
[1:48:57] this is a living reality that we're
[1:48:59] looking for in each and every one of our
[1:49:00] Lives amen
[1:49:03] we're almost done he says now listen
[1:49:05] Presbyterian friend Methodist Baptist
[1:49:07] Pentecostal when you're born again that
[1:49:09] only puts you in the family
[1:49:12] remember Jesus said that when in the
[1:49:14] parable of the sower he says some bring
[1:49:15] fold 30-fold some 60 fold some 100 fold
[1:49:18] All Sons and Daughters of God
[1:49:20] some only bring forth a little bit some
[1:49:22] bring forth a lot but they all bring
[1:49:25] forth every single one of them brings
[1:49:27] forth
[1:49:28] and I've said before this is my personal
[1:49:30] belief I don't have a scripture for it
[1:49:31] but you'll bring forth as much as you
[1:49:33] let God use you
[1:49:34] the more you'll surrender the more he'll
[1:49:36] bring forth in your life
[1:49:38] I was talking to a brother about you
[1:49:39] know we talk about some of the gifts
[1:49:41] that are in our midst and these
[1:49:42] different things and and visions and
[1:49:44] dreams and prophecy and these things and
[1:49:46] and he said the the most powerful gifts
[1:49:48] I've seen are in the humblest people I
[1:49:50] know
[1:49:51] that's it because it's not about them
[1:49:54] it's not about them and it was a
[1:49:55] sovereign gift that God gave them when
[1:49:57] he brought them to the place where they
[1:49:58] wouldn't use it for their benefit
[1:50:00] because you know what people that have
[1:50:01] that gift if they want to use it for
[1:50:03] their benefit they use it for business
[1:50:04] Deals they use it for gambling they use
[1:50:05] it for the lottery they use it for all
[1:50:07] these different things
[1:50:08] and doesn't work that way
[1:50:10] it says the humblest people I know but
[1:50:12] he says what he says when you're born
[1:50:14] again that puts you in the family that
[1:50:16] confirms you're in the family of God
[1:50:17] when God gives you the Holy Spirit
[1:50:18] that's his confirmation that's his seal
[1:50:21] that you are a true child of God he says
[1:50:23] but it's your character your conduct
[1:50:25] that gives God confidence in you the
[1:50:28] reason we haven't got the great church
[1:50:29] marching on today is because God can't
[1:50:32] find people to put his confidence in
[1:50:34] the Holy Spirit keeps saying they're
[1:50:36] tearing up they're breaking up they're
[1:50:37] doing this they're off the lines he says
[1:50:39] stay with God's word that's God's truth
[1:50:42] that's the pattern that's the blueprint
[1:50:47] there's something I don't have it here
[1:50:49] but the prophet God says something along
[1:50:51] the lines of that's what catches God's
[1:50:52] attention is a people that will stay
[1:50:54] with his word
[1:50:57] not how well we sing not how well we
[1:50:59] preach not how no no people that will
[1:51:01] stay with his word that's what matters
[1:51:03] most to God Amen
[1:51:05] when did the ceremony take place when
[1:51:07] the father was convinced when he was
[1:51:08] assured when he was absolutely positive
[1:51:11] that his son was ready
[1:51:14] and he didn't look at the neighbor's son
[1:51:17] The Neighbor comes over and says oh we
[1:51:18] just had the adoption for little Johnny
[1:51:20] today or Big Johnny
[1:51:21] hallelujah praise the Lord he didn't let
[1:51:23] that bother him he didn't let you know
[1:51:24] Mama's saying you know we really got to
[1:51:26] get him into the family business no he
[1:51:28] had to be convinced regardless of
[1:51:30] outside pressure regardless of how fast
[1:51:32] or slow other people were going he had
[1:51:33] to be convinced that his son was ready
[1:51:35] for the family business and until that
[1:51:37] happened he wouldn't do it but there was
[1:51:39] a window of time
[1:51:41] there's a window of time
[1:51:43] and if that sun turned 20 or whatever it
[1:51:45] was and he wasn't it the father just
[1:51:47] said enough's enough if you haven't
[1:51:49] learned by now you're never going to
[1:51:51] learn
[1:51:51] and they moved on to the next Sun
[1:51:54] there was a window of Grace if I could
[1:51:55] put it that way
[1:51:57] for you to step up before God says you
[1:51:59] know what you'll be a son but I can't
[1:52:01] trust you you'll be a daughter but I
[1:52:03] can't trust you and you're just gonna
[1:52:04] have to sit in the house and do nothing
[1:52:06] because you don't prove yourself you
[1:52:07] haven't proven yourself you haven't
[1:52:08] stepped up
[1:52:11] he says this oh I wish I had the ability
[1:52:13] to grind that into the people's hearts
[1:52:15] God is looking for time tested
[1:52:19] Christians remember he said seek first
[1:52:22] things first
[1:52:24] what comes after first second
[1:52:26] third fourth fifth there's a progression
[1:52:30] time-tested Christians you'll see this
[1:52:32] in business when somebody does well at
[1:52:34] the first level then they get promoted
[1:52:35] to the second level when they do well at
[1:52:37] the second level then they'll go to the
[1:52:38] third level in these different things
[1:52:39] and they'll go until they can't go any
[1:52:41] further
[1:52:42] why their time tested they're proven
[1:52:44] throughout the organization he says
[1:52:46] God's looking for time-tested Christians
[1:52:48] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:52:51] tried child trained tested he says and
[1:52:55] you who jump from Pillar To Post and
[1:52:57] this to that and in and out how can God
[1:52:59] ever adopt you into his family or
[1:53:01] positionally place you he says now think
[1:53:03] of that for a minute how can you be
[1:53:05] positionally placed when you will not
[1:53:06] stand long enough for God to do it
[1:53:09] we think back to our own preferences and
[1:53:12] the simple truth is that if we had our
[1:53:14] own way as soon as things got
[1:53:15] uncomfortable we'd move
[1:53:18] we'd move our job we'd move our
[1:53:19] relationship this is what's happening in
[1:53:21] the world today right people get married
[1:53:22] and as soon as it gets uncomfortable
[1:53:25] what do they do divorce and go find the
[1:53:27] next one
[1:53:29] and then when that doesn't work out they
[1:53:30] go and they find the next one the next
[1:53:31] one the next one it's a it's a repeating
[1:53:33] cycle that gets in there they don't like
[1:53:34] the job they're in it's difficult
[1:53:36] they're not getting the recognition they
[1:53:37] they want and all these different things
[1:53:39] what do they do just off and go
[1:53:42] why because they won't stick it through
[1:53:45] to be tested and tried so that they can
[1:53:47] come up to the next level
[1:53:49] and that's tough to do I've been there
[1:53:51] I've been there that's tough to do but
[1:53:53] guess what for a child of God God is in
[1:53:55] it
[1:53:56] that's what I've learned is God is in it
[1:53:58] whether I'm sitting in the Pew whether
[1:53:59] I'm behind the pulpit whether I'm doing
[1:54:01] well financially whether the job is good
[1:54:03] whether the job not is not good it's God
[1:54:05] preparing you for something that's
[1:54:06] coming down the road for you every
[1:54:08] single time we've got to be able to
[1:54:10] stick it through the hard times
[1:54:12] not just the easy times
[1:54:14] imagine the scripture says that that we
[1:54:17] are like trees planted by rivers of
[1:54:19] Living Water
[1:54:20] can you imagine if a tree had the
[1:54:22] opportunity to move itself around
[1:54:23] based on how the environment was based
[1:54:25] on how the climate was based on how the
[1:54:27] conditions what would happen if that
[1:54:28] tree and it and it was in a certain
[1:54:30] place and all of a sudden the drought
[1:54:31] came
[1:54:32] it would just up and walk over to where
[1:54:33] there is no drought wouldn't it
[1:54:36] but what happens in the drought time is
[1:54:37] it drives the roots deeper and deeper
[1:54:40] and that brings stability to the plant
[1:54:42] it brings stability to the tree and it
[1:54:44] can find nutrients where nobody else can
[1:54:46] and it'll survive the drought and then
[1:54:49] as the droughts get tougher it can
[1:54:51] survive longer and longer not only that
[1:54:53] it stabilizes it so when the storms come
[1:54:56] then the roots are dug deep and that
[1:54:58] tree can withstand it when we lived in
[1:54:59] Texas the water there was so or the
[1:55:01] ground was so hard packed the water
[1:55:03] wouldn't be absorbed in and so the trees
[1:55:05] often have roots that just spread out
[1:55:06] along the top and we had this tree in
[1:55:08] our backyard four foot through the
[1:55:10] middle four foot diameter and we got
[1:55:12] Hurricane Ike came up with 90 mile an
[1:55:14] hour sustained winds and that hundred
[1:55:16] footer went boom and crashed right down
[1:55:18] our backyard and it only had one deep
[1:55:20] root
[1:55:21] and in that kind of wind in a tree that
[1:55:23] big it wouldn't hold it but if it had
[1:55:25] put through a tougher time it would have
[1:55:27] had more Roots down and it might have
[1:55:29] held up and some of the trees did have
[1:55:30] that but that big one in the end it
[1:55:32] crashed because it only had one root
[1:55:34] holding it and nothing everything else
[1:55:35] was on the surface and it just ripped
[1:55:36] them right out when things got tough
[1:55:40] we don't move because things are tough
[1:55:43] we don't change where we're at
[1:55:45] I'm talking everything relationally
[1:55:47] whatever applied to your life the way
[1:55:49] where you're at this morning but if you
[1:55:51] keep moving every time things get tough
[1:55:53] you'll never grow you'll never mature
[1:55:55] and brother bam said you'll be a hot
[1:55:56] house plant
[1:55:58] you can't understand you can't take the
[1:56:00] rigors of real life
[1:56:02] and so you'll never mature and then God
[1:56:04] just ends up and he says all right just
[1:56:06] sit there we'll keep you in the house
[1:56:08] you'll be of no good
[1:56:09] you can't you can't pollinate you can't
[1:56:11] do anything else you'll just sit there
[1:56:12] alone
[1:56:13] and that's all we can do with you
[1:56:15] because you won't stick it out he says I
[1:56:17] need somebody that'll stand still long
[1:56:18] enough for God to adopt you
[1:56:20] you've got to let it be effective
[1:56:22] I've shared I sat for three and a half
[1:56:24] years in British Columbia it was
[1:56:26] effective and it was horrible
[1:56:28] but it was effective
[1:56:30] and if I'd have ran from that
[1:56:33] God would never have had any confidence
[1:56:34] to use me later
[1:56:36] you can't do those things you've got to
[1:56:37] stick with it and let God have his
[1:56:39] perfect way in your life you've got to
[1:56:41] come to a graduation by going through it
[1:56:43] not by skipping it
[1:56:45] amen
[1:56:46] he says character is what God is looking
[1:56:48] to find somebody that he can get his
[1:56:50] hands on somebody that'll stand still
[1:56:53] long enough
[1:56:55] what was he talking about God is looking
[1:56:57] for time-tested Christians it character
[1:56:59] requires proof and that comes over time
[1:57:03] and the test keeps getting harder and
[1:57:05] harder and harder
[1:57:06] and when it's finally the last test then
[1:57:09] he says all right son all right daughter
[1:57:11] you're ready to step into the workforce
[1:57:13] you're ready to start doing what I have
[1:57:14] for you to do
[1:57:16] he said God is trying to empty the world
[1:57:18] out of us and get us to empty ourselves
[1:57:21] out and be Fearless men and women who
[1:57:24] love God and will stay with God and will
[1:57:27] cross the separating Line Jordan that he
[1:57:30] could use us for his glory this is the
[1:57:33] hour I want you to think hard and if you
[1:57:35] have never crossed this place if you
[1:57:37] have never come across this line where
[1:57:39] you're saying well my mother belonged to
[1:57:41] a certain church that's all right but
[1:57:43] that doesn't take your place see God is
[1:57:46] calling men and women today to the
[1:57:48] Battlefront he's not calling them the
[1:57:50] gilgal neither is he calling them to
[1:57:51] Jericho or Bethel they will perish he
[1:57:53] says but he's calling them to Cross
[1:57:55] Jordan listen to this so he can get you
[1:57:58] into the school of his own power
[1:58:01] and make you and mold you amen God bless
[1:58:05] you each one the musicians will come
[1:58:11] we'll all Stand Together
[1:58:13] what's he saying
[1:58:15] we've got to be able to learn
[1:58:17] we've got to be able to surrender to the
[1:58:19] molding hands
[1:58:21] then we've got to be able to take the
[1:58:22] tests and the trials
[1:58:24] then we've got to be able to be in it
[1:58:25] for the long haul to understand that
[1:58:27] we're not going to make it to graduation
[1:58:28] unless we go through grades 1 through
[1:58:30] 12. and then that we've got to do every
[1:58:33] single course and every single class and
[1:58:35] we've got to pass every single stage
[1:58:36] before we can get there amen notice here
[1:58:39] what's he saying he's saying he's
[1:58:41] calling he's calling for men and women
[1:58:44] that will empty themselves out
[1:58:47] first Victory God's looking for is over
[1:58:49] you
[1:58:51] you want to go and do something for God
[1:58:52] he's got to get you in his hands where
[1:58:55] you'll do what he says not what you want
[1:58:57] to do and that's the first Victory amen
[1:58:59] I was so happy the first I was talking
[1:59:00] to my wife a bit about this you know and
[1:59:02] how you go through life and and when
[1:59:05] you're in in the in the early school you
[1:59:06] know you look at you know in our school
[1:59:08] we had grades kindergarten through six
[1:59:09] and you looked at the grade Sixers and
[1:59:11] you're like oh they're so big and
[1:59:12] there's so mature and so cool and all
[1:59:14] these things and when you got to grade
[1:59:15] six how cool and awesome was it
[1:59:19] there's a big letdown because you just
[1:59:21] were what you were
[1:59:22] well then it was well now I'm going to
[1:59:24] go to grade seven I'm going to be in
[1:59:25] high school now the high school not high
[1:59:27] school grade seven oh that's the best
[1:59:29] guess what you're the same as you were
[1:59:31] three months before in grade six weren't
[1:59:32] you and then you're looking at the grade
[1:59:34] 12s and they're going to graduate
[1:59:36] they're oh so cool boy
[1:59:40] oh boy everybody likes them they're so
[1:59:42] much better than me at hockey when I'm
[1:59:43] big and fast and strong I'm going to
[1:59:44] dominate
[1:59:45] right
[1:59:47] and then you get up to grade 12 and
[1:59:48] guess what you didn't dominate because
[1:59:50] you weren't that good to start with and
[1:59:52] you weren't that cool because you always
[1:59:53] were what you always were and you'll
[1:59:54] always be what you always are you get up
[1:59:56] there and you realize that it's just
[1:59:58] where you're at in life and so you don't
[2:00:00] appreciate that not but I was so happy
[2:00:01] when I graduated high school yes I'm
[2:00:03] done then I went to University
[2:00:07] and guess what I was a big shot in high
[2:00:09] school I was a little fish in a really
[2:00:11] big ocean in in University and that
[2:00:13] wasn't so fun and I thought I was so
[2:00:15] smart and all of a sudden I wasn't
[2:00:16] getting straight A's without having to
[2:00:18] work for it I started getting B's C's
[2:00:21] D's
[2:00:23] right
[2:00:24] not so fun six years of that and you're
[2:00:26] looking to the end ah it's gonna be
[2:00:27] great when I'm finished
[2:00:29] wrote my final exam and was so relieved
[2:00:32] you know what I did moved to Texas and
[2:00:34] what's the first thing I had to do write
[2:00:36] my engineering training exam eight hours
[2:00:39] studied for three months for that thank
[2:00:41] you
[2:00:41] no
[2:00:43] and after that yes I'm done that
[2:00:45] well what's after that three years later
[2:00:46] I gotta write the professional
[2:00:47] engineering exam covering everything
[2:00:50] I could possibly know
[2:00:53] another eight hour exam they say yes I'm
[2:00:56] done
[2:00:57] don't have to do any more tests and I
[2:00:58] didn't for that then God calls you into
[2:01:00] the ministry
[2:01:02] and now you're starting from scratch
[2:01:03] again
[2:01:04] and it's just one test after another
[2:01:06] test
[2:01:08] and so what he's got to prove he has
[2:01:09] what
[2:01:10] a minister first can you be still
[2:01:14] then as an evangelist
[2:01:17] can you sit on your headship
[2:01:21] I had to learn all of that
[2:01:23] had to learn all of that
[2:01:25] before he could ever put me here
[2:01:27] and it's one test after another test
[2:01:29] after another test
[2:01:31] talked to a brother the other day and he
[2:01:33] said the testing never ends
[2:01:35] you're always growing you're always
[2:01:37] maturing
[2:01:38] but will you stick with it
[2:01:40] that's what character is sticking with
[2:01:43] it no matter what amen
[2:01:46] why
[2:01:48] for the manifestation of the Sons and
[2:01:49] Daughters of God
[2:01:51] to write another second book of Acts
[2:01:54] but listen before they ever wrote a book
[2:01:55] of Acts it started with them in a room
[2:01:58] waiting
[2:02:00] sweating
[2:02:01] stinking
[2:02:04] 10 straight days
[2:02:06] simple obedience
[2:02:09] simple obedience brought them to the
[2:02:10] place where they could write a book of
[2:02:12] Acts amen and it's no different for us
[2:02:14] what's he saying he's saying will you
[2:02:16] listen to the tutor will you listen to
[2:02:18] the holy spirit will you take the word
[2:02:19] and not just repeat it back but in every
[2:02:22] aspect of your life will you say this is
[2:02:24] how I live it
[2:02:26] not just because it's up here but
[2:02:28] because there's something in me that
[2:02:29] won't let me get away with it in the
[2:02:31] first place why because I'm just like my
[2:02:33] daddy
[2:02:34] I'm not just like him I am him I'm a
[2:02:37] part of him and that won't let it go
[2:02:39] that won't let it go you can't tell a
[2:02:41] lie without having to make it right you
[2:02:44] can't cheat remember I told the story
[2:02:45] about that insurance thing deal when I
[2:02:47] was down in the states and they said are
[2:02:48] you going to Mexico with this truck and
[2:02:50] I said no and I was I was going for a
[2:02:52] week and I knew it
[2:02:54] and I got up those stairs and I was
[2:02:55] ready to take it and I had to walk right
[2:02:57] back down there and tell him I lied to
[2:02:58] him and pay the money because they were
[2:02:59] going to charge me like 1100 for
[2:03:01] insurance for that truck
[2:03:03] and I didn't want to do it
[2:03:05] because my plan had gotten off the rails
[2:03:06] and things hadn't worked out
[2:03:08] why God won't let you do it
[2:03:11] they'll make you repent he'll make you
[2:03:13] make it right and then he'll say all
[2:03:14] right let's move on son
[2:03:16] because what there's going to be days
[2:03:17] where it's not just going to be eleven
[2:03:19] hundred dollars
[2:03:20] it's going to be ten thousand dollars
[2:03:23] it's going to be you're going to have to
[2:03:24] let your reputation go
[2:03:26] you're gonna have to let something go
[2:03:27] that you don't really want to let go
[2:03:28] you're gonna have to pay a price you
[2:03:30] don't want to pay why because he says
[2:03:32] this is what character does
[2:03:34] that's what he's looking for church not
[2:03:36] parents people with character time
[2:03:38] tested Believers that have stuck with it
[2:03:40] I'm glad we've got some here I'm glad
[2:03:42] we've got some Elders that have showed
[2:03:44] us the way that we can we can say it
[2:03:45] works
[2:03:47] and it sticks
[2:03:48] because sometimes we're not too sure
[2:03:51] we're not too sure what it looks like I
[2:03:52] remember said this before when I before
[2:03:54] I gave my heart to the Lord I said well
[2:03:56] what if I don't like it
[2:03:59] do you like it brother Mark do you like
[2:04:01] it brother Dale do you like it brother
[2:04:02] Bob
[2:04:03] listen if it's calling you it's because
[2:04:05] you like it
[2:04:06] it's because there's something in you
[2:04:07] that says the work is going to be better
[2:04:09] than the fun I have right now because
[2:04:12] that's what I am I am what he's trying
[2:04:14] to call me to I'm not where I'm at amen
[2:04:17] it's the same thing with this the more
[2:04:19] we resist the more miserable we are
[2:04:21] but if we'll give in character comes out
[2:04:23] of it and then God all of a sudden has a
[2:04:25] son or a daughter that he can use amen
[2:04:27] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[2:04:32] Lord would you help us to Just Surrender
[2:04:36] Lord to fall back into those molding
[2:04:38] shaping hands
[2:04:40] Lord to accept what you've called us to
[2:04:43] oh we don't have to force it we don't
[2:04:45] have to rush it we just have to stand
[2:04:47] still and let you do the work in US
[2:04:49] Heavenly Father
[2:04:51] but Lord once we're there
[2:04:53] don't let us stand still Lord put us
[2:04:55] into action we pray Heavenly Father give
[2:04:57] us Lord of faith that puts us into
[2:04:58] action give us a Faith Lord that is
[2:05:00] active that is Lord living that people
[2:05:02] can see that people can benefit from
[2:05:04] Lord not just our words Lord but our
[2:05:07] Deeds also
[2:05:08] Lord we want to be real sons and
[2:05:10] daughters of God
[2:05:11] Lord I want to give more of my life to
[2:05:13] you
[2:05:14] Lord I want to give more of my strength
[2:05:16] to you I want to give more of my time to
[2:05:17] you Lord help me to put away those
[2:05:19] distractions Lord help me to put away
[2:05:21] those things that so easily beset us
[2:05:24] Lord help me to just be more committed
[2:05:26] Lord to show Lord that I'm serious about
[2:05:28] what you've got for us
[2:05:30] Lord would you help us each one forgive
[2:05:31] us Lord forgive us where we duck the
[2:05:34] lessons Lord forgive us Lord where we
[2:05:35] move from Pillar To Post where we try
[2:05:37] and get out of these things Lord but
[2:05:39] help us to be still and know that you
[2:05:40] are God in our lives Lord that you've
[2:05:42] put us in a in a place in a position in
[2:05:44] a situation Lord for our own good Lord
[2:05:46] and it has a perfect work that it's
[2:05:48] trying to do in US Lord grant us Grace
[2:05:50] each one now we pray in Jesus name we
[2:05:53] ask it amen
