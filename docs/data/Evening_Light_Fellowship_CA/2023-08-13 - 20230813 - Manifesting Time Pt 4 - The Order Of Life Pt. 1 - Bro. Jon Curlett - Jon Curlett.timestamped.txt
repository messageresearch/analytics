[41:13] with your people now we ask and Jesus
[41:15] Christ's name we ask it amen amen God
[41:18] bless you turn if you would to Ezekiel
[41:20] chapter 36. Ezekiel 36 amen want to
[41:23] welcome brother Lord and sister may
[41:25] Smith and then all the way over from
[41:27] Alberta amen God bless you good to have
[41:29] you it's always good when people will
[41:31] drop into the church when they come
[41:32] through you know and it's not everyone
[41:34] does it but we certainly appreciate when
[41:35] they do so God bless you
[41:37] man uh brother Bob and sister Brenda of
[41:39] course are home this morning and with
[41:41] covid and so we want to remember them in
[41:43] prayer and also they had their 48-year
[41:45] anniversary on Friday so we want to say
[41:48] God bless them and it's certainly a
[41:50] milestone and a wonderful thing
[41:52] of course brother Chad is also home with
[41:54] Cova this morning so we want to remember
[41:56] him and then I I was speaking with
[41:58] brother Andrew Glover earlier this week
[42:00] and he's at brother Barry Johnson's in
[42:02] Calgary this week but he's got his
[42:05] throat's bugging him so we want to
[42:06] remember him in prayer that he'll be all
[42:08] fixed up and tuned up and ready to
[42:10] minister for us and certainly Minister
[42:12] for the Saints there in Calgary where he
[42:14] is this morning amen God bless you
[42:16] Ezekiel 36 and 24 says for I will take
[42:19] you from among the Heathen and gather
[42:21] you out of all countries and we'll bring
[42:23] you into your own land then will I
[42:25] sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
[42:27] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[42:29] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[42:31] you a new heart also will I give you in
[42:34] a new spirit will I put within you and I
[42:36] will take away the Stony heart out of
[42:38] your flesh and I will give you in heart
[42:39] of Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[42:42] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[42:45] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[42:48] them and ye shall dwell in the land that
[42:50] I gave to your fathers and you shall be
[42:52] my people people and I will be your God
[42:55] Amen God bless you you can have your
[42:57] seats this morning and we're continuing
[42:59] on our series of manifesting time and I
[43:02] want to take a title this morning of the
[43:04] order of life amen the order of life and
[43:06] this is something we're going to be
[43:07] we'll be covering for for quite some
[43:09] time because we're really getting into
[43:10] the meat of what it means to be adopted
[43:12] and and to do that you have to walk
[43:14] through the new birth and you have to
[43:15] walk through the process of becoming a
[43:17] child of God and we've spent three
[43:19] services now talking on the certainty of
[43:21] a seed and we went to Genesis and we
[43:23] talked about how a seed is locked down
[43:24] and it cannot be changed what's in it is
[43:26] is what's going to come out it can't
[43:28] change it can't decide to be something
[43:30] else it's got to produce what's inside
[43:32] of it and then we went to First Peter
[43:34] and we read where Peter said we're born
[43:35] of an Incorruptible seed that's spora
[43:37] and it's a spiritual seed and it cannot
[43:39] change but it's not that it just can't
[43:41] be changed but it cannot be killed and
[43:43] it cannot be stopped amen it's a seed
[43:45] that feeds on only one kind of nutrients
[43:47] and that's the word of God it only feeds
[43:48] on that which is like itself and brother
[43:50] Brown would say that's the Eternal part
[43:52] of you that's your soul that's the DNA
[43:54] that's the attribute of God that he
[43:56] placed in us before the foundation of
[43:57] the world and we talked about how the
[43:59] conditions have to be right that you can
[44:01] have a seed you can be a seed you can
[44:03] you can do all these things and it can
[44:04] be perfect it can have everything right
[44:06] inside of it but until the conditions
[44:08] are right then it won't come to life and
[44:10] it takes God to make the conditions
[44:11] right for the seed of God inside of us
[44:13] to come to life amen and we saw that
[44:16] there was a potential inside of us all
[44:17] the time there's a potential inside of a
[44:19] seed but until God quickens it until God
[44:21] makes the conditions right anything you
[44:23] do is going to just fall flat on its
[44:25] face and it's going to die and it's not
[44:26] going to produce what it's supposed to
[44:28] and then there's potential life but it
[44:30] takes God to Quicken it and bring us
[44:31] into that time of life where we're going
[44:33] to produce the word and in that we saw
[44:35] that God is responsible for his own word
[44:37] amen that he takes it and he speaks it
[44:39] he thinks it he speaks it and then he
[44:41] sends forth his Spirit to produce it and
[44:43] to make it come out the way that he said
[44:45] it was going to happen amen and that's
[44:46] that that great place of rest that I
[44:48] spoke about that security for the
[44:50] believer because when we read our
[44:52] portion of this word it's very
[44:53] Supernatural and then maybe some of it
[44:56] doesn't seem so Supernatural but when
[44:58] you start talking about Rapture and you
[44:59] start talking about a resurrection
[45:00] listen to Rapture we're still alive but
[45:03] how are you going to raise from the dead
[45:05] if you go by way of the Grave how are
[45:06] you going to race from the dead you
[45:07] don't have any power left to do anything
[45:09] and yet there's something that's
[45:10] supposed to be inside of us that's going
[45:12] to take us through and bring a
[45:13] resurrection not just to Rapture amen so
[45:15] when you look at those things what we
[45:17] have to do is say I can't do it
[45:19] that's a that's a starting place for a
[45:21] Believer is I can't do it
[45:23] and maybe sometimes that's the the thing
[45:25] that's holding us back as we've been
[45:27] trying to do it for so long that we've
[45:29] gotten down and disheartened because
[45:30] it's not working out and you need to
[45:32] come to a place where you say this isn't
[45:34] my work this isn't my strength it's not
[45:35] my power it's not even my word it's his
[45:38] power his strength his word and it's up
[45:40] to him to produce it amen the minute you
[45:43] can understand this isn't by your
[45:44] strength your power your thoughts that's
[45:46] when you can step into the hands of God
[45:48] that's when you can step into the word
[45:49] of God and then that's where the
[45:51] supernatural happens is when you step
[45:52] into him rather than he tries to force
[45:54] his way into you brother Brown would say
[45:57] this he would say the predestinated
[45:58] bride of Christ now the church the word
[46:02] seed with everything that God promised
[46:05] to put in the church in it right now he
[46:08] says it's in it now
[46:11] everything
[46:12] he says everything is in order
[46:16] the Holy Spirit has been given the seed
[46:19] has been sowed in the evening lights
[46:20] have been shining so in other words
[46:23] God's done everything that he needs to
[46:25] do
[46:27] this is the evening time this is the end
[46:29] of the last stage this is the evening of
[46:31] the last day this is the end of all
[46:34] things for the Gentile bride and he's
[46:36] saying everything that God needs to do
[46:38] has been done amen everything that's
[46:41] going to produce the word for this hour
[46:43] that's going to do what the word says is
[46:45] supposed to do has been done here he
[46:47] says the Holy Spirit has been given in
[46:50] other words the quickening power has
[46:52] been dropped down the leadership the
[46:54] guide the inspiration everything we have
[46:56] need of for this life has been given
[46:59] when you get the Holy Spirit that's
[47:01] everything that you're ever going to
[47:03] need
[47:04] because that's God's life itself you
[47:07] have God's life inside of you there's
[47:08] nothing else that you're going to need
[47:09] because that'll rap you that'll
[47:10] resurrect you that'll destroy this flesh
[47:13] so that the the spirit of God can have
[47:14] its way in our lives it'll change your
[47:16] being it'll change your mind it'll
[47:18] change the way you approach things it'll
[47:20] change the way you react to things
[47:21] that'll do the full work inside of you
[47:23] and he says that's been given so that
[47:25] means that there's nothing else that you
[47:26] need
[47:27] it needs to finish its work but
[47:30] everything that the work is requiring
[47:31] has already been given to us amen that's
[47:33] the promise of Acts 2 38.
[47:36] you get the Holy Ghost and then that's
[47:38] it it's a finished work and now it's
[47:40] just a step out of time and into
[47:41] eternity but then beyond that he says
[47:43] the seed has been sowed so in other
[47:46] words the ones that have been laid aside
[47:47] we had seven Church ages and seeds had
[47:50] to be sold in each Church age but he
[47:52] says we're in the last age and the last
[47:53] stage seed has been sowed in other words
[47:55] it's been taken off the shelf and put in
[47:58] the ground to grow there's something
[48:00] that's got to happen you don't put a
[48:01] seed in the ground and expect it to be
[48:03] dormant you plant it in the time to
[48:06] prepare for the Harvest
[48:08] you plant it in the spring so that when
[48:10] the Harvest time comes in the fall
[48:11] there's something to actually Harvest so
[48:13] he says not only has the power been
[48:15] given but the seed has been sowed in
[48:17] other words you've been positionally
[48:18] placed you've been planted with an
[48:20] expectation that you're going to grow
[48:22] and it's God doing something
[48:23] intentionally and it's by his word and
[48:25] it's by his predestinated plan
[48:27] but then I love how he finishes because
[48:29] he says the evening lights have been
[48:31] shining now the summer time is the only
[48:34] time when we get evening lights
[48:36] in the winter it goes down we don't get
[48:38] evening lights all we get is late
[48:39] afternoon lights but he says now we're
[48:41] in the time where the evening lights
[48:43] have been shining in other words we're
[48:45] in the summer in the late summer because
[48:47] that's what's required to ripen the
[48:49] Harvest that's what's required to bring
[48:50] Reit to its full maturity is to ripen in
[48:54] the presence of the Sun and so you need
[48:56] evening lights to do that you can't just
[48:58] have eight hours of sunshine to produce
[49:00] wheat you need the 12 and 14 hours of
[49:02] sunshine constant heat and warmth for it
[49:05] to come to its full potential
[49:07] so he says it's not just that you've got
[49:09] the power it's not just so you've been
[49:10] planted but now you've got the
[49:12] conditions to produce a mature bride
[49:14] everything that is needed is here
[49:16] already amen the sunshine is here the
[49:19] presence of the sun is here to ripen a
[49:21] bride
[49:22] what's he saying he's saying you're in
[49:23] the Harvest Time so start looking for a
[49:26] harvest start looking for maturity start
[49:28] looking for the things that are expected
[49:30] of a mature bride that's going to go in
[49:33] a Rapture don't act like children
[49:35] don't be caught up in the things that a
[49:37] childish believer is caught up in but be
[49:39] mature Believers in Christ step into
[49:41] your position be expecting him to do
[49:44] everything that he said he was going to
[49:46] do
[49:47] don't hold back there's nothing left
[49:49] amen
[49:51] we read in Romans 8 before it says for
[49:53] the earnest expectation of the creature
[49:55] of the creation that's this earth and
[49:57] its elements and systems the expectation
[49:59] of the creation waiteth for the
[50:01] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[50:03] creature the creation was made subject
[50:05] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[50:08] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[50:09] because the creation the creature the
[50:12] creation itself shall be delivered from
[50:14] the bondage of corruption into the
[50:16] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[50:18] but before the Earth can do it the
[50:20] children of God have to get it remember
[50:22] for the Earth can be given Liberty then
[50:25] the children of God have to have their
[50:26] Liberty we come first the Earth comes
[50:29] second he says for we know that the
[50:31] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[50:34] in pain together until now
[50:36] the whole earth is waiting for us to
[50:39] finish our part so that it can be
[50:41] restored back to its eating condition
[50:45] we're the first ones that have to come
[50:47] to our place
[50:48] then God takes us up and there's a
[50:50] tribulation then he gives us a new
[50:51] Heaven and new earth after the
[50:52] Millennium in these things it says but
[50:54] not only they but ourselves also which
[50:57] have the first fruits of the spirit even
[50:59] we groan ourselves grown within
[51:02] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[51:05] wit the Redemption of the body so our
[51:07] Prophet comes and he tells us it's
[51:09] manifesting time it's Harvest Time It's
[51:11] the final age for the Gentiles and
[51:13] everything's wrapping up and God has
[51:15] done everything he said he would do
[51:18] listen if you think he hasn't done it
[51:20] then you only have to look at the life
[51:21] of that seven churches Messenger to see
[51:23] that that was the wave sheath that God
[51:26] was coming down and dwelling in flesh
[51:28] the same way he did in the book of Acts
[51:31] and if that anointing was for him then
[51:33] that anointing is for everyone that
[51:34] receives the prophet's name because we
[51:37] receive the same promise as the prophet
[51:39] does we get the same reward that the
[51:41] prophet does which is what God dwelling
[51:43] in flesh yet again
[51:45] and we get the Overcomers reward as well
[51:47] that we get to sit with him in his
[51:49] throne but brother random saying listen
[51:50] everything's here
[51:53] everything's here and now it's the time
[51:55] of manifestation it's the time to wrap
[51:58] things up in other words God's not
[52:00] holding back anymore
[52:02] he's holding back wrath but he's not
[52:04] holding back himself because he's got to
[52:06] get us out of the earth so that he can
[52:08] judge the Earth and bring us back to the
[52:10] full eating condition amen Luther was
[52:12] held back
[52:14] Luther only had a revelation of the Holy
[52:16] Ghost for justification
[52:19] that was a work of the Holy Spirit but
[52:21] it was not the fullness of it and then
[52:23] Wesley comes behind him and he builds on
[52:25] top of that and he gets what a second
[52:27] revelation of sanctification but God was
[52:29] holding things back because it wasn't
[52:31] time yet and then Pentecost comes
[52:33] through Azusa and they get what a
[52:35] revelation of the gifts of the Spirit
[52:39] but that wasn't everything and they
[52:41] stopped there and then God brings a
[52:42] prophet messenger and he says you've got
[52:44] the gifts but you need the giver now
[52:46] because the giver is the seal the gifts
[52:48] are not the seal The Giver is the seal
[52:50] and you need the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[52:52] on your entire body and so then he says
[52:55] now that that's given everything's taken
[52:57] it's it it's done it's over with
[52:59] everything you have need of is done
[53:01] there amen the word was restored to its
[53:03] fullness and that gave us the fullness
[53:05] of the Holy Ghost to have what produced
[53:07] the full word in each and every one of
[53:09] our Lives amen when the word comes to
[53:11] its fullness then the bride can come to
[53:12] its fullness that's why we need a
[53:14] restoring Angel we needed an Elisha and
[53:17] Elijah to come again and restore us back
[53:19] to that original faith that original
[53:21] Faith requires the original word
[53:23] it requires the fullness of the word
[53:25] but I would say this he says now that's
[53:27] the age we're living in right now the
[53:29] seventh Church age now it's all to be
[53:31] manifested in the grain of wheat at the
[53:33] end he says another comeback it's a
[53:35] restoration now if you take Luke the
[53:37] 17th chapter in the 30th verse he says
[53:38] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[53:41] it be in the coming of the son of man
[53:43] when the son of man begins to reveal
[53:45] himself what is revealed he says make
[53:47] his revelation of what he is in this day
[53:50] reveal it out to the people the word
[53:53] that's made known to the day he says
[53:56] reveal to the People by the
[53:58] manifestation of the Holy Spirit making
[54:01] that Jesus live among us
[54:03] and the problem is we keep pointing to a
[54:06] prophet and we don't see it in ourselves
[54:09] because he's only the chief offering
[54:11] he's only the wave offering he's only
[54:12] the first fruits and that's got to
[54:14] continue all the way through the age
[54:15] because we're all part of the same body
[54:17] we're all under the same fullness of the
[54:19] Holy Spirit anointing under that
[54:21] restored word amen
[54:23] but the thing is he's saying this and
[54:25] the question that we have is how does he
[54:26] do it how does God do it how does he
[54:29] bring us to a place where we are the
[54:31] manifested sons and daughters of God
[54:33] what is the order of it what is it that
[54:35] we're that God does throughout this
[54:37] thing to bring us into that fullness of
[54:40] adoption and I want to be very careful
[54:42] with this because we've been preaching
[54:43] from seeds because that's the way Jesus
[54:45] did it that's the way our Prophet did it
[54:47] but when it comes to the the new birth
[54:49] and adoption you can't do that with
[54:51] seeds because seeds aren't human
[54:54] seeds are only a type but they're not a
[54:56] perfect type
[54:58] you're not a seed you're a human a seed
[55:01] when it's laying in the ground doesn't
[55:02] have thoughts it doesn't have a spirit
[55:04] it doesn't have a mind it doesn't have
[55:05] emotions it's just dead and dormant and
[55:08] that's really reflective of our soul
[55:11] but we've got a whole body around us
[55:13] that can think and act and talk and
[55:15] listen and do all these things and so we
[55:18] can't preach about adoption or the
[55:20] manifestation of the sons of God purely
[55:21] from seeds we'll touch on seeds
[55:23] throughout it but we've got a lot more
[55:25] going on in us than a seed does
[55:27] and so you've got to step back now into
[55:29] the way that Paul preaches it and even
[55:31] what we see here in Ezekiel and these
[55:33] different things so we have to well I
[55:35] preach the new birth as it occurs in a
[55:37] human rather than just how it does in a
[55:39] seed because brother Brown would talk
[55:40] about that moment of quickening but he
[55:42] wouldn't talk about all that stuff that
[55:43] happens before it necessarily in a seed
[55:45] it's tougher to type it that way so I'm
[55:47] not leaving the seed thing behind we're
[55:49] going to refer to it at times but when
[55:51] it when it comes to the order of life
[55:52] when it comes to the order of spiritual
[55:55] life of becoming a child of God we've
[55:57] got to go back to how we are as humans
[55:59] not just as seeds in that way we've got
[56:01] to treat ourselves that way because
[56:02] that's where God works with us he works
[56:04] with us as humans not just as a plant
[56:06] life amen brother Brian would say this
[56:08] he says this is the way it is with our
[56:10] road to heaven we have our own thinking
[56:12] but if we use that we're going to find
[56:15] ourselves all together wrong all racked
[56:17] up somewhere but if we'll take the way
[56:19] that God has marked out for us we'll
[56:21] arrive there just as sure as anything
[56:24] because God has a way
[56:26] now let's go back to some of God's way
[56:28] in a simple form that people would know
[56:30] he said did you ever notice the little
[56:32] chicken trying to get to this earth what
[56:34] does he do on the inside of that shell
[56:36] he stands there and beats away at that
[56:39] shell until he gets himself free what is
[56:41] it he says God's provided way
[56:43] he had a bill before he was ever able to
[56:47] peep on the shell he had a bill because
[56:50] God provided him a bill to work in God's
[56:52] provided way
[56:54] before he ever became a true chicken he
[56:57] had a bill
[56:59] before he's ever got real life he has a
[57:02] bill and that bill is required for him
[57:04] to come to life in other words there's
[57:06] something built into him to allow him to
[57:08] come to life
[57:10] he says oh he's a lovely father see he
[57:13] makes everything just right first
[57:16] he had to grow a bill on the bird the
[57:18] foul that's born inside of an egg he's
[57:20] got to make a way for him to follow the
[57:22] provided way to get out see how God does
[57:25] he makes a provided way and the only
[57:28] thing we have to do is follow his
[57:31] instructions and we come out just
[57:34] exactly right always every time
[57:39] it's simple follow what the word says He
[57:42] says yes sir he picks his way out
[57:45] because he is coming God's provided way
[57:47] now I want you to notice something here
[57:48] because the chicken starts as an egg and
[57:51] that egg is germinated by the rooster
[57:53] and an egg that was dormant that wasn't
[57:55] alive because we eat them all the time
[57:57] those are dead eggs but if the rooster
[57:59] germinates it it's it's not alive but it
[58:02] starts to grow there is life that is
[58:04] working within it but it's not yet alive
[58:06] as we would say it's just a bunch of
[58:08] cells and nutrients inside of it it's an
[58:10] animal seed if we can put it that way
[58:12] but once it's germinated those cells
[58:14] start to pull apart and split and divide
[58:17] but they're also joining as they do it
[58:19] but it's still inside the egg it isn't
[58:22] anything yet it's not even a chicken yet
[58:24] but when the male germinates that egg it
[58:26] starts to pull itself into proper shape
[58:32] everything that chicken will be is in
[58:34] the egg
[58:36] and what happens is when it's germinated
[58:38] it starts to pull itself together to
[58:41] produce a chicken
[58:43] right it starts to it doesn't look like
[58:45] a mature chicken inside there but it
[58:48] starts to resemble a chicken right it
[58:50] gets a beak it gets a head it gets
[58:52] little feet with tiny little claws on it
[58:53] and the prophet says now notice before
[58:55] it's even able to pip its way out of the
[58:58] shell it has what's required to get it
[59:01] out of the shell
[59:02] he says it's God provided way it's it's
[59:05] a what they call it an egg tooth
[59:08] and an egg tooth is is just a a little
[59:11] pointy thing at the end of the beak and
[59:13] it's a temporary horny cap on the
[59:15] chick's upper beak that serves for
[59:17] pipping its way through the shell and it
[59:19] usually dries and falls off within 18
[59:21] hours after the chick hatches so it's
[59:23] something that's given for a very
[59:24] specific amount of time to do a very
[59:27] specific work and then it's not needed
[59:28] anymore but God has provided every
[59:31] single chicken with that means of
[59:33] getting out of that egg and remember
[59:34] brother Brandon would say if you try and
[59:36] break that eight that that egg open to
[59:39] get that chick out it will die
[59:42] because you're not doing it God's
[59:44] provided way and you talk about Hothouse
[59:46] Christians and and people that you just
[59:48] gotta hug them and love them and do
[59:49] everything all the time and they can't
[59:50] stand on their own two feet they can't
[59:52] stand the storms of life they can't be
[59:54] out in natural rainfall they can't take
[59:55] the heat they can't take the drought
[59:57] they can't take the storms of life
[59:58] because they haven't come to a proper
[1:00:00] New Birth they're just hot house plants
[1:00:03] that's the way a chicken is if you break
[1:00:05] that egg open it will die because that
[1:00:07] strength that it builds up to break out
[1:00:09] is what keeps it going for the first
[1:00:11] little while it has to break out it has
[1:00:14] to do the work amen notice the chicken
[1:00:16] has life in that shell but it's not
[1:00:19] living in the way that a chicken is
[1:00:21] supposed to yet amen it's alive in the
[1:00:24] egg but it can die in the egg
[1:00:27] if it doesn't pip its way out if it
[1:00:29] gives up it will die in the egg and that
[1:00:32] chicken never truly lived
[1:00:35] it had life but it never truly lived the
[1:00:38] way that a chicken's supposed to him and
[1:00:39] it's a work of Life inside of it but
[1:00:41] it's not yet Fully Alive a human baby's
[1:00:44] inside the mother and from the moment of
[1:00:46] conception it has life but it is yet not
[1:00:48] alive
[1:00:50] it is not a living soul
[1:00:53] but it is alive inside of the mother but
[1:00:55] there's a process inside of it and that
[1:00:57] certainly doesn't give us the right to
[1:00:58] kill it the way that the world talks
[1:00:59] about because we know that God has
[1:01:01] predestinated us before we ever come out
[1:01:03] who and what we're going to be that
[1:01:04] means he looks at us as alive in there
[1:01:06] but as we would understand it that baby
[1:01:08] in there is not a living human it's not
[1:01:10] doing anything on its own yet it is
[1:01:12] completely dependent on everything
[1:01:14] around it it's got to come out and live
[1:01:15] on its own for us to say it's truly
[1:01:17] alive amen but the point here is that
[1:01:19] God has a provided way to come to life
[1:01:21] and there's an order to coming to life
[1:01:24] and then there's a way of being
[1:01:25] conceived
[1:01:27] and there's a way of growing and
[1:01:28] maturing into a spiritual child and then
[1:01:30] there's a way to be born
[1:01:32] and it's a process and it's not
[1:01:34] something that happens in a single
[1:01:36] moment we look at it at a baby being
[1:01:37] born into this world and we say well
[1:01:39] it's born when it comes out of the
[1:01:41] mother but the birth is a process and
[1:01:44] the process started nine months ago
[1:01:46] when Mommy and Daddy conceive that child
[1:01:48] in the womb of the mother and then for
[1:01:51] nine months that child is going through
[1:01:53] a birth process that starts with what
[1:01:55] growth inside to look and and shape and
[1:01:59] form itself into the shape of a human
[1:02:01] and then at the very end it comes out as
[1:02:04] a human and becomes a living soul and we
[1:02:06] say well that's when it was born but its
[1:02:08] birth started nine months ago it's a
[1:02:10] process amen
[1:02:12] and that's one of the things we've
[1:02:13] learned even in this message is that the
[1:02:15] Rapture is a process
[1:02:16] because Enoch walked and walked and
[1:02:18] walked and then one day he started
[1:02:20] walking up and then that was it
[1:02:22] but there was a process to the Rapture
[1:02:23] and so the new birth is a process we
[1:02:26] look at it and we say well when you get
[1:02:28] the Holy Ghost that's the new birth but
[1:02:30] there's so much has usually happened
[1:02:31] before that and that's what we're going
[1:02:33] to talk about over the next few Services
[1:02:35] because otherwise we'll get to the place
[1:02:37] where we're looking for this
[1:02:38] instantaneous thing and we don't realize
[1:02:40] that this is a work of God it's a
[1:02:42] process of the holy spirit in our life
[1:02:44] before he even gives us the Holy Spirit
[1:02:46] itself
[1:02:47] that's what's going on inside of us so
[1:02:48] let's take it back to Ezekiel 36 here
[1:02:51] to our opening scripture it says for I
[1:02:52] will take you from among the Heathen
[1:02:54] gather you out of all countries and will
[1:02:56] bring you into your own land that's the
[1:02:59] calling out of the people that's the
[1:03:00] choosing of God in verse 24. that is
[1:03:03] God's predestination saying I'm going to
[1:03:05] do it and that is the start of any new
[1:03:08] birth that is the start of the new birth
[1:03:09] process is God has called you God has
[1:03:12] predestinated God has put your name on
[1:03:13] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:03:15] foundation of the world and he says I'm
[1:03:16] going to make sure that they produce the
[1:03:18] word
[1:03:19] that's the start of it all he says then
[1:03:21] I'll sprinkle clean water upon you and
[1:03:23] you shall be clean from all your
[1:03:24] filthiness from all your idols and I
[1:03:26] will cleanse you that's the cleaning of
[1:03:28] the People by what clean water pure
[1:03:30] water it's untainted it's unpolluted
[1:03:33] it's filtered of any contaminants it's
[1:03:35] natural it's original it's perfect and
[1:03:36] it does a perfect work of cleaning
[1:03:40] I saw this video where a guy said
[1:03:42] he's talking about Doctrine he says well
[1:03:44] it doesn't really matter you know people
[1:03:45] say well it doesn't matter if the
[1:03:47] doctrine isn't quite right and so he
[1:03:48] took a clean glass of water and then he
[1:03:50] took a glass of water from the toilet
[1:03:52] and he took one drop out of that toilet
[1:03:54] water and he put it in that pure glass
[1:03:55] of water and he said who wants to drink
[1:03:57] that glass of water now with one drop of
[1:04:00] toilet bowl water nobody wants to drink
[1:04:01] the pure water anymore because that
[1:04:03] little bit
[1:04:04] ruins it that's why we needed a
[1:04:07] restoring Angel that's why we needed a
[1:04:08] restoring message we needed a pure word
[1:04:10] for a pure anointing to produce a pure
[1:04:13] word result
[1:04:15] and then after that he says a new heart
[1:04:17] also will I give you and a new spirit
[1:04:19] will I put within you and I'll take away
[1:04:20] the Stony heart out of your flesh and I
[1:04:23] will give you in heart of Flesh so a new
[1:04:25] heart and a new spirit are given to the
[1:04:27] people and in doing so he takes away
[1:04:29] that original Stony heart our natural
[1:04:31] heart is not tender towards God
[1:04:33] God has to give us something that is
[1:04:35] tender towards him that's open to
[1:04:37] receiving the word itself and he says
[1:04:39] I'm going to give you a fleshy heart a
[1:04:41] soft heart
[1:04:42] something that's malleable something
[1:04:43] that that doesn't just turn away from
[1:04:45] the things of God but rather it's drawn
[1:04:48] towards them and that's still a work of
[1:04:50] God that's still a work of the Holy
[1:04:51] Spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit and
[1:04:54] then he says I'm going to give you a new
[1:04:55] spirit and we'll talk about this a
[1:04:57] little later where brother Brown would
[1:04:58] say listen you needed a new spirit
[1:04:59] because you can't even get along with
[1:05:01] yourself with your original Spirit he
[1:05:03] says so you need a new spirit just so
[1:05:04] you can get along with the Holy Spirit
[1:05:07] and then he says and then I will put my
[1:05:10] spirit within you NOW Watch What Happens
[1:05:12] because everything that happens after
[1:05:14] this could not be possible beforehand
[1:05:16] once he puts his Spirit within you it
[1:05:18] says and cause you to walk in my
[1:05:20] statutes in other words to live the word
[1:05:23] he says and you shall keep my judgments
[1:05:26] and you'll do them holy holy holy unto
[1:05:30] the Lord
[1:05:31] none of this is possible with a new
[1:05:33] heart and a new spirit but once he put
[1:05:34] his Spirit within you now you can
[1:05:36] actually live the full word
[1:05:38] he says and you shall dwell in the land
[1:05:39] that I gave your father so he says I'll
[1:05:41] return you to your possession and you
[1:05:43] shall be my people and I will be your
[1:05:44] God so he restores your position and he
[1:05:47] restores your relationship
[1:05:49] now I'm going to take us to the
[1:05:50] prophet's message to explain this
[1:05:52] because he was the one that needed to
[1:05:53] clarify this because there was a lot of
[1:05:55] Confusion And even today I can say we're
[1:05:57] mixed up inside the message many times
[1:05:59] because we've gotten to the place where
[1:06:01] people are saying if you accept the
[1:06:03] message you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:06] and they're sitting in church and
[1:06:08] they're nodding their head to what comes
[1:06:09] over they're giving an intellectual
[1:06:11] acknowledgment to it but they aren't
[1:06:12] living it
[1:06:14] and if you can't live it then you
[1:06:15] haven't accepted it
[1:06:17] brother Bob says if you truly believe it
[1:06:19] you'll do it
[1:06:21] not just nod your head not just sit in
[1:06:22] church and say amen Amen brother but
[1:06:25] you'll actually live it amen so you're
[1:06:27] walking all over the scriptures when you
[1:06:29] say this idea that if you accept the
[1:06:31] message for your day you've got the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost because it's not just accepting it
[1:06:35] it's acting on it you got to live it not
[1:06:37] just say it's true because there's lots
[1:06:40] of things Jesus said that they had to
[1:06:41] acknowledge were true and yet they could
[1:06:43] not accept the person of the word and
[1:06:45] that's what we've got to do this is not
[1:06:47] a message that is written on uh on books
[1:06:49] or it's in audio sermons but it's a
[1:06:51] bridegroom message that said come get
[1:06:54] ready for the bridegroom because he's
[1:06:56] coming and the message was to prepare
[1:06:58] you not to listen to a bunch of books or
[1:07:00] sermons but it was to accept the
[1:07:02] bridegroom that was coming behind the
[1:07:04] message
[1:07:05] amen the message is not a book the
[1:07:07] message is a person
[1:07:09] the word is a person it's not just
[1:07:11] written because if all we've got is the
[1:07:13] messages or the tapes of the scripture
[1:07:15] alone this is what kills because there's
[1:07:17] no life in you to do it but if you
[1:07:20] accept the person of it that's when
[1:07:22] you've got the message that's when you
[1:07:24] truly believe the message because what
[1:07:25] it's living inside of you it's not just
[1:07:27] an intellectual Doctrine but it's a
[1:07:29] Living Word it's a living message inside
[1:07:31] of you
[1:07:32] listen to what the prophet of God says
[1:07:34] he says that's what we need today is
[1:07:37] experiences
[1:07:38] plural
[1:07:40] of the new birth
[1:07:42] what we need today is experiences of the
[1:07:45] new birth he says now I want you to
[1:07:46] watch the order that Ezekiel brought it
[1:07:48] in he said I'll give you a new heart
[1:07:50] I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put
[1:07:52] my spirit in you he says I want you to
[1:07:54] watch there's three of it a new heart
[1:07:55] I'll take the old Stony heart away
[1:07:57] that's the old different heart you have
[1:07:59] and I'll give you a new spirit he says
[1:08:02] now many times there's been a terrible
[1:08:04] mistake the people have thought
[1:08:06] sometimes that the new spirit was the
[1:08:08] Holy Spirit but it isn't it's a new
[1:08:11] spirit why you couldn't even get along
[1:08:13] with yourself with your old Spirit how
[1:08:15] are you going to get along with the Holy
[1:08:16] Ghost God had to give you a new spirit
[1:08:18] so you could get along with his spirit
[1:08:23] he says a new heart a heart of Flesh so
[1:08:26] you'll receive it then a new heart
[1:08:28] spirit in that heart and I'll put my
[1:08:30] spirit in that you see new heart new
[1:08:33] spirit and my spirit three things he
[1:08:35] spoke of now many times we try to make
[1:08:37] that thing just say well as soon as you
[1:08:39] get the new spirit you quit your listen
[1:08:41] what the new spirit does
[1:08:43] you quit you're stealing you quit you're
[1:08:45] lying things like that you say oh
[1:08:47] Hallelujah I got it and you find out the
[1:08:50] first time anyone crosses your path a
[1:08:52] little bit oh mercy what a difference
[1:08:54] sure you blow up like a frog eating
[1:08:56] buckshot
[1:09:01] frogs don't eat Buckshot very well
[1:09:03] it just weighs them down until they
[1:09:05] explode
[1:09:07] he says but let me tell you brother
[1:09:09] that's the reason you never got God's
[1:09:11] spirit that's true you say oh he stepped
[1:09:13] on my toe I'll not just put up with that
[1:09:15] all right that shows what you got in
[1:09:17] there that's true
[1:09:19] he says I'll put a new spirit in you and
[1:09:22] then I'll put my spirit in you now the
[1:09:24] heart is in the center of the emotions
[1:09:25] of the human being your heart is the
[1:09:27] middle of you that's exactly right so
[1:09:29] God puts a new heart in the middle of
[1:09:31] the old man then he puts a new spirit in
[1:09:33] the middle of the new heart and puts his
[1:09:36] spirit in the middle of the new spirit
[1:09:39] he says now it's all just exactly like
[1:09:41] the mainspring in a famous watch you see
[1:09:43] they got a little click over here
[1:09:45] working a click over here working it's
[1:09:47] little wheels are turning he says but
[1:09:49] it's all controlled by a mainspring now
[1:09:52] today most of us don't have an
[1:09:54] appreciation for a watch anymore and if
[1:09:56] we have a watch it's like what I've got
[1:09:58] it's a it's a smart watch it's an
[1:09:59] electronic watch it's a digital watch
[1:10:01] and so we don't even understand what
[1:10:03] brother Brad is talking about but I love
[1:10:04] watches and I've got a mechanical watch
[1:10:07] and it's an amazing thing to see how
[1:10:09] these things work inside of them but
[1:10:12] before watches were electronic before
[1:10:13] they had batteries they were purely
[1:10:15] mechanical and they had all these
[1:10:17] different ways to make the watch keep
[1:10:19] time
[1:10:20] and if you look at one of these
[1:10:21] movements an automatic movement this is
[1:10:23] what it looks like under the face all
[1:10:25] you would often see would be the two
[1:10:26] hands moving around three hands moving
[1:10:28] around
[1:10:29] hours minutes and seconds you see that
[1:10:31] moving around but underneath this is
[1:10:33] what it takes to keep time accurately
[1:10:36] and it's a whole system and it's got
[1:10:37] levers and it's got Gears and it's got
[1:10:39] shafts and it's got Springs and it's got
[1:10:41] Jewels for things to wait on and rest on
[1:10:44] and turn smoothly and all these
[1:10:45] different things and no matter how and
[1:10:48] it based on how much money you were
[1:10:49] willing to spend they could make a watch
[1:10:51] that didn't just tell time
[1:10:53] but it could tell time in three
[1:10:54] different time zones it could give you
[1:10:56] the phases of the Moon it could have a
[1:10:58] calendar on it and they could build it
[1:11:00] all into this and they'd run it by a
[1:11:02] single thing
[1:11:04] they'd have all these fancy movements
[1:11:05] and some of these watches now are worth
[1:11:07] over millions of dollars
[1:11:09] millions of dollars for something that
[1:11:10] tells time in a couple different fancy
[1:11:12] ways purely mechanical no batteries and
[1:11:15] what is it that did it brother Branham
[1:11:16] calls it the mainspring and so what we
[1:11:19] have here on the right hand side is all
[1:11:21] the parts of a typical automatic watch
[1:11:25] and you say wow that's a lot of stuff
[1:11:28] he's saying this is the this is the what
[1:11:30] a Christian believer looks like this is
[1:11:32] what's inside of us is a bunch of
[1:11:33] different things but he says the most
[1:11:36] important thing to have there is a
[1:11:38] mainspring because the mainspring is the
[1:11:40] source of power for everything inside of
[1:11:43] that watch
[1:11:44] you have these tiny little fine gears
[1:11:46] and these tiny little jeweled movements
[1:11:48] and all of these different things but
[1:11:49] everything is driven by the mainspring
[1:11:52] and unless you have a mainspring there
[1:11:54] it will never do its job
[1:11:57] you can have every part of what it takes
[1:12:00] to be a believer except the Holy Ghost
[1:12:02] and you'll never live the life
[1:12:08] now if you look at that picture you'll
[1:12:10] see that all those things that are in
[1:12:11] there
[1:12:12] and there's actually a way to make that
[1:12:14] clock work that watch work without a
[1:12:17] mainspring and you know what it is it's
[1:12:19] on the side of your watch you have this
[1:12:20] little thing called the stem
[1:12:22] and if you just take that stem and you
[1:12:23] turn it you can make that watch tell
[1:12:26] time
[1:12:27] but you know what it's reliant on
[1:12:29] your timing
[1:12:30] your power your focus
[1:12:33] how well you can keep time on your own
[1:12:35] and let me ask you how many of us can
[1:12:37] keep time for 60 seconds without another
[1:12:39] reference
[1:12:41] we can't do it but yet there's a way for
[1:12:44] us to live the Christian walk on our own
[1:12:46] and that's we just keep turning the stem
[1:12:49] doing it our own way by our own power
[1:12:50] but what happens is the time gets off
[1:12:52] really quickly doesn't it
[1:12:54] it's not about the ability to tell time
[1:12:56] it's about the ability to tell time
[1:12:58] accurately
[1:13:00] you know what they say a broken clock is
[1:13:02] right twice a day
[1:13:05] and what happens is people will see
[1:13:06] somebody right twice and wrong all the
[1:13:09] time and they'll say they've got a gift
[1:13:10] my cousin sent me a a prophetic message
[1:13:14] from a guy he he follows yesterday
[1:13:18] and I was studying but I said you know
[1:13:20] what I'm going to listen to it
[1:13:21] So I listened to it and you know what he
[1:13:24] said two things right in about 15 things
[1:13:26] wrong
[1:13:27] and it was completely messed up but
[1:13:29] they'll focus on what he gets right and
[1:13:31] they'll forget about all the thing that
[1:13:32] he gets wrong inside of there because he
[1:13:34] was focused on he was talking about the
[1:13:35] The Jezebel government and you know what
[1:13:37] it is he calls The Jezebel government as
[1:13:38] the Democrats as somehow God's
[1:13:40] government is the is the Republicans
[1:13:42] down in the states
[1:13:43] I told the guy I said listen this is all
[1:13:45] Satan's kingdom
[1:13:46] there's no party that's affiliated with
[1:13:48] God God's not even in it Satan has it
[1:13:51] all the way till the tribulation
[1:13:53] so so why are we talking about a jezebel
[1:13:55] Kingdom I said America is going on it's
[1:13:57] done it's finished she's already turned
[1:13:58] down God she's Bound for judgment
[1:14:01] but he'll focus on what the things that
[1:14:03] do come for right and ignore all the
[1:14:05] things that are wrong why because he's
[1:14:08] convinced that that man's a prophet
[1:14:10] but that's not what we're looking for
[1:14:11] we're looking for something that tells
[1:14:13] the time right all the time
[1:14:15] that's why we need a Vindicated Prophet
[1:14:17] not just a man that says he's a prophet
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:20] but you can have all the pieces together
[1:14:23] and you can sit there
[1:14:25] and you can turn your watch
[1:14:27] and you know what
[1:14:28] sometimes you'll do just okay
[1:14:31] people say yep that's a real believer
[1:14:33] but there's going to come a time you got
[1:14:35] to sleep you got to eat and you got to
[1:14:37] take your hand off that stem
[1:14:39] and all of a sudden your life falls
[1:14:41] apart because it was you doing it all
[1:14:42] along all of a sudden you're saying whoa
[1:14:44] what happened to that
[1:14:46] why it was you doing it not the
[1:14:48] mainspring of the Holy Spirit doing it
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:52] Paul would say this in second
[1:14:53] Corinthians he says we have this
[1:14:55] treasure in Earthen vessels
[1:14:57] that the Excellency of the power may be
[1:15:01] of God and not of us
[1:15:04] listen we know our own frailties as
[1:15:05] humans but sometimes what happens is we
[1:15:07] get into our Christian walk and all of a
[1:15:09] sudden we think that makes us superhuman
[1:15:10] it doesn't make us superhuman it makes
[1:15:13] God Supernatural
[1:15:15] in US
[1:15:16] that's it when I was in Edmonton brother
[1:15:18] Nathan Erickson said something I'm going
[1:15:20] to preach on this in in the future Lord
[1:15:22] willing he says remember you are the
[1:15:25] mask
[1:15:26] he is the actor
[1:15:28] he's doing it you're just the shell
[1:15:31] you're just the thing that's hiding him
[1:15:33] you're not doing it it's him doing it
[1:15:35] inside of you and that's what produces
[1:15:37] the works of God inside of our life amen
[1:15:41] listen to this Proverbs 14 12 says
[1:15:43] there's a way that seemeth right unto a
[1:15:45] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:15:48] death I was listening to that message
[1:15:50] the guy this morning and brother Branham
[1:15:51] talks about how he he married you know
[1:15:54] after his wife died and he went he
[1:15:55] married Mita and he said you know I kind
[1:15:57] of cheated on my wife he says I took her
[1:15:59] to a place where I could go hunting for
[1:16:01] our for our honeymoon and he's talking
[1:16:02] about how he's told his wife he says I'm
[1:16:04] going to go out there and I'm going to
[1:16:05] shoot a bear I'm going to shoot a deer
[1:16:06] I'm going to bring it back and we'll
[1:16:07] have our meat for the year and it's
[1:16:09] going to be wonderful and she says sure
[1:16:10] go do it that sounds wonderful so she's
[1:16:12] in the cabin with Billy Paul
[1:16:14] no way of taking care of herself and he
[1:16:16] says I'm just going to go out and come
[1:16:17] back and brother Bram says I'm a guide
[1:16:19] I'm a certified guide I know where I am
[1:16:22] I know what I'm doing
[1:16:24] he says and I knew I could never get
[1:16:26] lost
[1:16:27] he says and I went out and I said I
[1:16:29] started to track there's a puma he just
[1:16:31] saw a flash of it and he started trying
[1:16:32] to track it couldn't find it it finally
[1:16:34] took to the trees he said bro I couldn't
[1:16:35] track it anymore so then I turned around
[1:16:37] and he says I whiffed a bear I smelt a
[1:16:39] bear so then I started following that
[1:16:41] bear and I stepped out and then a big a
[1:16:43] big deer jumped out of a bush it was a
[1:16:45] big buck he said exactly what I want
[1:16:46] boom shot it he dressed it cleaned it
[1:16:49] all up hung it up in a tree he says and
[1:16:51] then I looked around and I was
[1:16:52] surrounded by fog
[1:16:54] no reference for anything
[1:16:56] he can't see anything and he says well
[1:16:58] this is no problem I'm a guide I know
[1:17:01] what I'm doing I'll just walk back to
[1:17:03] the cabin and he starts to walk and he
[1:17:05] walks for about 34 30 or 45 minutes he
[1:17:07] says now where was my turn off where
[1:17:09] where was I supposed to turn off I
[1:17:10] haven't seen it yet he says and I came
[1:17:12] right around and there's my deer hanging
[1:17:13] up in the tree
[1:17:14] and he's come in a total Loop all the
[1:17:16] way back to where he started
[1:17:19] he says okay I can't do that again and
[1:17:21] he starts out walking he's looking for
[1:17:22] his turn off and preaching he says this
[1:17:24] is starting to look familiar and boom he
[1:17:25] comes right back and there's this deer
[1:17:27] hanging in the in the tree again he says
[1:17:28] I was on what the Indians call a death
[1:17:31] walk where you don't realize you're
[1:17:32] making a circle and the entire time even
[1:17:35] though you're experienced even though
[1:17:37] you're focusing on not making that
[1:17:39] mistake he says I was turning in circles
[1:17:42] and I was on a Death March and brother
[1:17:44] Bram says I thought I was too good of a
[1:17:46] guide to be lost and brother Brown says
[1:17:49] I can't make this mistake after the
[1:17:51] second time he says and I came back
[1:17:54] again
[1:17:57] he he said I can't do a third Loop and
[1:18:01] then he went and did a third Loop why
[1:18:03] because he was limited by his own power
[1:18:06] strength knowledge sense of direction
[1:18:08] and in a total fog nobody can do it
[1:18:12] then he says I tried to Bluff myself and
[1:18:14] said you're not lost
[1:18:17] he says but you can't Bluff it he says
[1:18:19] your inner conscience tells you you're
[1:18:22] wrong
[1:18:24] prophet of God
[1:18:25] giving us an example for our life
[1:18:28] and he says but in the background
[1:18:29] something kept saying I'm a very present
[1:18:33] help in time of trouble
[1:18:35] and he didn't listen and he didn't
[1:18:37] listen and he didn't listen and finally
[1:18:39] he nothing was working and the fog was
[1:18:42] worse than ever and he couldn't get a
[1:18:44] reference for to give him a direction
[1:18:45] and he prayed and he said Lord if that's
[1:18:48] you help me
[1:18:50] he says I don't know if that's you or
[1:18:52] not but if it's you you help me find my
[1:18:54] way out and you know what he did after
[1:18:56] he prayed he said I picked a direction
[1:18:58] to the best of my knowledge and I
[1:19:02] started walking
[1:19:04] and you know what he said if I'd have
[1:19:06] kept going in that direction I'd have
[1:19:07] ended up in Canada
[1:19:09] after prayer and asking for leadership
[1:19:12] he's still to the best of his knowledge
[1:19:14] went in the completely wrong direction
[1:19:18] why he's still in his power
[1:19:20] he's still in his thinking he's still in
[1:19:21] his experience he says but as I started
[1:19:24] walking he said something tapped me on
[1:19:27] the shoulder like the hand of a man
[1:19:31] in his sincerity he still was going
[1:19:34] wrong
[1:19:36] but he had prayed and he said Lord I
[1:19:39] need you
[1:19:40] so he started on a road and it was the
[1:19:43] wrong road but the Lord touched him on
[1:19:45] the shoulder and he says and he says
[1:19:47] when I turn to look he says there was a
[1:19:50] hole in the fog and six miles away he
[1:19:54] could see Hurricane Mountain which is
[1:19:55] where he needed to go he said if I can
[1:19:57] get to Hurricane Mountain there's a
[1:19:59] telephone pole up there he says and I
[1:20:01] helped the guy put a line from there all
[1:20:04] the way down to his cabin so he could
[1:20:05] call his wife when he was at the cabin
[1:20:07] he said so I could get to Hurricane
[1:20:09] Mountain I could find that wire up there
[1:20:11] and I could follow it all the way back
[1:20:13] to the cabin and he said I had to go up
[1:20:14] over Hills and Bluff some mountains and
[1:20:16] everything to get there but he says for
[1:20:18] that one moment through six miles of fog
[1:20:20] a hole appeared and God showed me the
[1:20:22] way I had to go and he walked and he
[1:20:25] walked and he walked and he walked and
[1:20:27] then he says as I got close he says I
[1:20:28] had to keep my hand up
[1:20:31] what is it
[1:20:34] it's not on Me Lord
[1:20:36] he's walking in surrender still
[1:20:38] I'm going the direction you told me to
[1:20:40] go
[1:20:41] he says because I had to keep my hand up
[1:20:42] so that it would hit the telephone wire
[1:20:44] that we'd strung he says and once I hit
[1:20:46] that he says I was never going to let it
[1:20:49] go
[1:20:50] and he said I'd have my rifle in one
[1:20:52] hand and this hand up and then I'd
[1:20:53] switch over he says I got to the place
[1:20:55] where I could barely keep it up he said
[1:20:57] and every time I switch he says I have
[1:20:58] to walk back a few steps to make sure I
[1:21:00] hadn't missed it in the switch he said
[1:21:02] because I couldn't miss that lifeline
[1:21:05] he said everything that matters to me is
[1:21:07] in that cabin and without me they're
[1:21:08] going to die she doesn't even know how
[1:21:10] to start a fire
[1:21:13] what is it we get our hands in it
[1:21:16] it's the ways of death every single time
[1:21:18] I don't care how experienced you are I
[1:21:19] don't care how long you've been serving
[1:21:21] the lord I don't know I don't care how
[1:21:22] long you've been in this message without
[1:21:24] that mainspring we're gonna fall by the
[1:21:26] wayside and we're gonna be wrecks on the
[1:21:28] side of the road remember I said earlier
[1:21:30] in the series I said brother Branham
[1:21:32] said this is why people are wrecks on
[1:21:33] side of the road
[1:21:34] this is what we're talking about people
[1:21:36] that think they've come all the way and
[1:21:38] they've only come up two-thirds of the
[1:21:40] way and they still don't have that
[1:21:41] mainspring of the Holy Ghost in their
[1:21:43] life
[1:21:44] amen Paul would talk about this no let
[1:21:47] me let me see this
[1:21:48] brother Brown said if you don't want to
[1:21:50] get wrecked up in life you quit
[1:21:52] pretending to be a Christian he says
[1:21:54] because you're going to find yourself
[1:21:55] wrecked up out here somewhere he says
[1:21:58] yes you come through God's provided way
[1:22:01] of approach what does it mean to pretend
[1:22:04] wasn't meant to pretend to be a
[1:22:05] Christian it means to rely on yourself
[1:22:08] to live the word and produce Christ
[1:22:10] rely on your own thoughts your own
[1:22:11] strengths your own gifts your own
[1:22:13] abilities all these different things and
[1:22:14] if we do that we're headed for a life of
[1:22:17] constant frustration
[1:22:19] Paul talks about it in Romans 7 and this
[1:22:21] is Paul's personal life before he got
[1:22:23] the Holy Ghost Paul speaking from
[1:22:25] experience when he talks about this
[1:22:29] he says I find then a law that when I
[1:22:32] would do good Evil's present with me for
[1:22:35] I Delight in the law of God after the
[1:22:37] inward man but I see another law of my
[1:22:39] members in my body warring against the
[1:22:41] law of my mind and bringing me into
[1:22:43] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[1:22:45] my members so he says I've got the right
[1:22:47] intentions I've got the right thoughts
[1:22:48] but when it comes time to actually do it
[1:22:50] I keep falling flat on my face
[1:22:55] he says o Wretched Man that I am who
[1:22:58] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:23:00] death you know who else is called
[1:23:02] wretched laodicea
[1:23:04] the laodicean condition is that they're
[1:23:06] wretched but they don't even know it
[1:23:08] Paul at least knew it
[1:23:10] Paul at least knew it but in laodicea
[1:23:13] she thinks herself to be rich in natural
[1:23:15] and spiritual ways but this is Paul's
[1:23:17] mentality before he got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] before he got knocked off his high horse
[1:23:21] on the road to Damascus and it what is
[1:23:23] it he was so self-righteous and yet he
[1:23:26] was persecuting the true church but
[1:23:28] remember when he says who art thou to
[1:23:30] the pillar of fire he says I am Jesus
[1:23:32] whom thou persecute us and then he says
[1:23:34] Paul it's hard to kick against the
[1:23:36] pricks
[1:23:37] because God knew that Paul was
[1:23:39] confessing outwardly what I'm a perfect
[1:23:42] man according to the law
[1:23:44] but inside his conscience was bothering
[1:23:46] him because he knew he wasn't living it
[1:23:49] exactly the way he told everyone he was
[1:23:50] remember Paul would say you know I speak
[1:23:52] as a foolish man no I speak foolishly I
[1:23:54] speak according to the flesh that there
[1:23:56] was none like me
[1:23:57] there was none like me nobody lived the
[1:23:59] way I lived I was of I was I lived the
[1:24:01] life of a Pharisee better than the
[1:24:03] Pharisees did I was the best of the best
[1:24:05] when it came to being a Christian to
[1:24:06] becoming a Believer and yet then the
[1:24:08] Holy Ghost knocks him off of that that
[1:24:10] horse it says it's hard to kick against
[1:24:11] the Pricks Paul your inner conscience
[1:24:13] has been telling you you aren't what you
[1:24:14] think you are
[1:24:16] and there's something wrong that's going
[1:24:18] on remember brother Bram says you can't
[1:24:19] Bluff it when your conscience says you
[1:24:22] ain't got it you ain't got it and you
[1:24:24] need to settle that and anchor it in
[1:24:25] your soul amen
[1:24:27] but I want to take it to the New
[1:24:28] Testament the Old Testament kind of
[1:24:30] simultaneously here to just break down
[1:24:32] this bit of Ezekiel 36 for the last bit
[1:24:34] of the service
[1:24:35] he says now I will take you from among
[1:24:37] the Heathen and gather you out of all
[1:24:40] countries and will bring you into your
[1:24:41] own land so he's going to take he's
[1:24:42] going to gather and he's going to bring
[1:24:44] into it's the three works of Grace if we
[1:24:46] could put it that way but consider what
[1:24:49] those condition those people were in
[1:24:50] when he took him out of the Heathen
[1:24:51] lands what took him into Heathen lands
[1:24:54] Disobedience to the word idolatry
[1:24:59] everything they did wrong they were
[1:25:01] still doing wrong when he calls them
[1:25:03] back
[1:25:04] that's the grace of God that's the
[1:25:06] predestination of God is that when he
[1:25:08] calls them back to their land they're
[1:25:10] still in the condition that they left it
[1:25:12] but yet God says my word won't return to
[1:25:14] me void I'll take you in whatever
[1:25:16] condition you're in and I'm going to
[1:25:18] clean you up so that you become the word
[1:25:19] that I spoke about
[1:25:21] right they're no more a child of God
[1:25:23] when he starts to pull them back than
[1:25:25] they were then he drove them out when he
[1:25:26] let them you know be taken by their
[1:25:28] enemies in these things
[1:25:29] now Romans 8 we read this last service
[1:25:31] says and we know that all things work
[1:25:33] together for good to them that love God
[1:25:35] to them who are thee called according to
[1:25:37] his purpose remember we talked about
[1:25:39] what he said in Jeremiah he says for I
[1:25:41] know my thoughts towards thee that they
[1:25:43] are of good and not of evil so the
[1:25:45] thoughts of God are what bring things to
[1:25:47] good in our life and then he says for
[1:25:49] whom he did for no he also did
[1:25:51] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:25:54] image of his son that he might be the
[1:25:56] firstborn among burning Brethren so in
[1:25:58] other words that confirmation is a
[1:26:00] process
[1:26:02] it is not the work of a moment though
[1:26:04] the finished work happens often like
[1:26:06] this yet it is a work of time to bring
[1:26:10] you to what God has predestinated to and
[1:26:12] what he's calling you to it says
[1:26:14] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:26:16] he also called and whom he called them
[1:26:19] he also Justified so it's a work of God
[1:26:21] we see from start to finish all
[1:26:23] throughout but it's at the Finish point
[1:26:25] that we really come to that full New
[1:26:27] Birth
[1:26:28] brother Brown would say this he says now
[1:26:29] notice not only is the bride washed and
[1:26:32] forgiven but she is Justified did you
[1:26:35] ever try the word Justified to see what
[1:26:36] it means he says now for instance if
[1:26:38] brother green heard that I have been
[1:26:40] drinking I've been doing bad things and
[1:26:42] Benny found out that I didn't do it then
[1:26:44] he come and say I forgive you brother
[1:26:46] Branham
[1:26:47] now that doesn't make any sense does it
[1:26:49] and brother Brian says you forgive me I
[1:26:52] never did it what are you forgiving me
[1:26:54] about
[1:26:56] but that's not the condition of the
[1:26:57] Bride initially
[1:26:59] he says but if I'm guilty then I can be
[1:27:02] forgiven but I'm still not just because
[1:27:05] I did it
[1:27:06] he says but the word Justified is though
[1:27:09] you never done it at all
[1:27:12] Justified he says and then the blood of
[1:27:14] Jesus cleanses us from sin till it's put
[1:27:16] in the book of God's forgetfulness he's
[1:27:18] the only one that can do it so in other
[1:27:21] words when Satan comes knocking on your
[1:27:23] door reminding me of you of your past or
[1:27:25] your mistakes or your failures you say
[1:27:28] what are you talking about Satan I never
[1:27:30] did it because under justification you
[1:27:33] never did it remember we showed that
[1:27:35] time how how in a bank book you have
[1:27:37] debts and you have credits
[1:27:40] and if you scratch out the debt yet you
[1:27:43] know by looking at that book that you
[1:27:44] had a debt at some time but the blood of
[1:27:46] Jesus doesn't scratch it out it doesn't
[1:27:48] cover it up but it completely erases it
[1:27:51] so there is no evidence of your sin in
[1:27:53] the first place so when Satan comes
[1:27:55] saying you did this you say no you did
[1:27:57] it
[1:27:58] you did it because remember the Scene
[1:28:00] goes back on the one that caused it the
[1:28:02] one that laid the Trap it goes back to
[1:28:04] Satan all our sins are laid at his feet
[1:28:08] so when he says look what you did you
[1:28:10] say no I never did it you did it to me
[1:28:12] I'm covered by the blood there is
[1:28:15] therefore no sin there's no condemnation
[1:28:16] to them that are in Christ Jesus amen
[1:28:19] if you look at what the blood of Jesus
[1:28:21] does because remember they're under the
[1:28:22] blood of bulls and goats for so long and
[1:28:24] it never purged their conscience but
[1:28:26] under the blood of Christ now your
[1:28:28] conscience can be purged so that you can
[1:28:30] go before the throne of grace say I'm
[1:28:32] sorry Lord I didn't mean to do it will
[1:28:34] you forgive me and help me not to do it
[1:28:35] and you can walk out and never have your
[1:28:38] conscience bothered one more time about
[1:28:40] it I'm a testimony of it I'm a testimony
[1:28:43] of it my conscience bothers me no more
[1:28:46] after I've laid it at his feet because
[1:28:48] the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all
[1:28:50] of our sins John would say this it says
[1:28:52] the next day John said Jesus coming unto
[1:28:55] him and says Behold the Lamb of God
[1:28:57] which takes Away The Sins Of The World
[1:29:00] the blood of bulls and ghosts didn't
[1:29:01] take it away it covered it
[1:29:03] and the covering meant there was
[1:29:05] something under there but this perfect
[1:29:07] blood of Christ from the perfect
[1:29:09] sacrifice it takes it away and so
[1:29:11] there's nothing even to see anymore
[1:29:14] there's no evidence of it anymore it's
[1:29:16] buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:29:18] and the sign says no fishing
[1:29:22] remember that for your brother and
[1:29:23] sister the next time they do something
[1:29:24] wrong
[1:29:26] amen you don't drag something out from
[1:29:28] under the blood that God has already
[1:29:29] covered brother Graham says you do that
[1:29:31] you're responsible for it
[1:29:33] amen God help us to remember it let's be
[1:29:35] gracious towards our brother and sisters
[1:29:37] amen
[1:29:39] but in Ezekiel we see a calling
[1:29:41] prophesied but that was not the time of
[1:29:42] fulfillment but then we see in Romans we
[1:29:45] see that calling being fulfilled Ezekiel
[1:29:47] said God's going to call you and then
[1:29:48] Paul says God's already called you
[1:29:51] and he points rightly all the way back
[1:29:53] to before the foundation of the world
[1:29:54] see ezekiel's pointing to the time of
[1:29:57] his fulfillment and Paul's saying yes
[1:29:59] it's the time fulfillment but he
[1:30:00] actually did it way before you ever came
[1:30:02] on this Earth and that was the time
[1:30:03] where he called you but now is the time
[1:30:06] for it to happen amen
[1:30:08] that first bit this first bit of
[1:30:10] justification is always by faith because
[1:30:12] you've got nothing to do with it there
[1:30:14] is nothing you can do to justify
[1:30:16] yourself before God there's nothing you
[1:30:18] can do to make yourself more acceptable
[1:30:20] there's nothing you can do to make
[1:30:22] yourself more holy it is absolutely the
[1:30:24] work of the blood of Jesus Christ it's
[1:30:26] the finished work of Calvary and until
[1:30:28] you come to that place Satan will beat
[1:30:30] you up through your conscience and your
[1:30:32] memory for the rest of your life
[1:30:34] absolutely
[1:30:35] absolutely I've got family members that
[1:30:37] are in that where they can't get past
[1:30:39] their own conscience because they don't
[1:30:41] know what it means to be justified
[1:30:43] they don't understand that Christ paid
[1:30:45] for those sins and it's not by your
[1:30:48] actions you're getting in but it's by
[1:30:49] his faith through Grace in the holy
[1:30:52] spirit that you're going to make it all
[1:30:53] the way through
[1:30:54] you can't do a thing so stop trying to
[1:30:56] do it
[1:30:57] live your life according to his word as
[1:30:59] best you can but don't think that's
[1:31:01] what's going to make you acceptable in
[1:31:02] this site amen we'll see what makes you
[1:31:04] acceptable we'll see what makes you holy
[1:31:06] in these things
[1:31:08] but notice justification your sins
[1:31:10] aren't attributed to you but you're
[1:31:12] still dirty
[1:31:13] you're still dirty you've still got
[1:31:15] habits you've still got friendships you
[1:31:17] shouldn't have you still got demonic
[1:31:18] influences in your life you're listening
[1:31:20] to the wrong things you're looking at
[1:31:21] the wrong things you're saying the wrong
[1:31:23] things even amen so but you're in a
[1:31:26] transforming process and you've got to
[1:31:28] start dirty to finish clean
[1:31:30] if you convince yourself that you're
[1:31:32] clean to start then what do you need God
[1:31:33] for you've got to say I'm dirty and
[1:31:37] because this is a process don't just say
[1:31:39] well I was dirty when I got baptized but
[1:31:41] now there's never anything that he has
[1:31:42] to work with me in listen he's still
[1:31:44] working on me
[1:31:45] so okay there's four of us that are you
[1:31:48] still working on this morning five six
[1:31:49] seven there we go we got our hands up
[1:31:51] don't sit there and say just because I'm
[1:31:55] a Child of God that he's not still
[1:31:56] working sanctification goes on your
[1:31:59] entire life
[1:32:01] at least it is for me
[1:32:03] every day every week every month God is
[1:32:06] taking things out why because he's got
[1:32:09] to have room to add things in and
[1:32:11] there's some things that you have to be
[1:32:12] cleaner to be used for than others
[1:32:14] listen if I'm washing my car the bucket
[1:32:16] doesn't have to be that clean
[1:32:19] God's using you to wash a car your life
[1:32:22] can be a certain way but he's asking you
[1:32:25] to give people a drink of cold water
[1:32:26] Your Vessel has to be a whole lot
[1:32:28] cleaner than the one that's used for
[1:32:29] washing the car
[1:32:31] there are stages of sanctification it is
[1:32:34] going on constantly in our lives so what
[1:32:36] you can't do is sit there and say no no
[1:32:38] no even if you've got the Holy Ghost I
[1:32:42] don't need any more work
[1:32:43] he's always working on his bride until
[1:32:46] we go in a Rapture that's when it's
[1:32:48] fully done
[1:32:49] and until then he's constantly working
[1:32:51] in our lives amen so we've got to be
[1:32:53] honest about ourselves and say he's
[1:32:55] still working on me because if we get to
[1:32:57] the place where we don't have anything
[1:32:58] that he's working on we ought to be
[1:33:00] going in a rapture
[1:33:03] but if we're honest
[1:33:05] we'll see there's things that he's
[1:33:07] trying to work on in our life
[1:33:08] but it's an arrogant spirit it's a
[1:33:10] prideful spirit it's a religious spirit
[1:33:12] that says the word is for everybody else
[1:33:14] Pitchfork religion remember brother
[1:33:16] Steve Clark said well that's for sister
[1:33:18] Justine who's smiling at me right now
[1:33:20] and oh look brother Lloyd came here I
[1:33:22] hope brother John gets him on this do
[1:33:23] you guys know what brother Lloyd's been
[1:33:24] doing brother John pin him to look get
[1:33:26] him brother John no no no no no no Lord
[1:33:28] be it unto me
[1:33:30] amen let him walk to my door let him sit
[1:33:33] at my table
[1:33:34] I don't want sister Amber to be the only
[1:33:36] one that's getting everything I want
[1:33:37] something
[1:33:39] Lord feed me change me correct me draw
[1:33:41] me pull me change me
[1:33:44] bring your light into my life where I
[1:33:46] haven't had it before amen
[1:33:49] what did he say he says after I do that
[1:33:51] after I call you after I justify you he
[1:33:54] says then will I sprinkle clean water
[1:33:56] upon you and you shall be clean that's
[1:34:00] his word not my word
[1:34:03] we can feel dirty sometimes
[1:34:06] we can
[1:34:09] but he says you're clean
[1:34:11] he makes us acceptable
[1:34:14] I don't make myself acceptable when he
[1:34:17] says I'm clean or clean every wit
[1:34:19] but what did he say to Peter he says
[1:34:21] listen you still have to wash your feet
[1:34:23] he says you're clean every whip but you
[1:34:25] still gotta wash your feet
[1:34:27] he says and if you don't wash your feet
[1:34:29] you have no part of me Peter you're
[1:34:31] constantly walking through a dirty World
[1:34:33] some of it's going to get on you
[1:34:36] so don't worry about having to get
[1:34:37] washed up on a regular basis that's why
[1:34:39] we read our Bibles that's why we come to
[1:34:41] church is to keep ourselves clean by the
[1:34:44] washing of Water by the word which is
[1:34:45] what we're going to talk about he says
[1:34:47] and what will that water do it will take
[1:34:49] from you all your filthiness and from
[1:34:51] all your Idols will I cleanse you what
[1:34:54] is it habits false religion and false
[1:34:57] spirituality it's all going to be wiped
[1:34:58] away
[1:35:00] First Corinthians 6 11 says this and
[1:35:03] such were some of you
[1:35:06] such for some of you
[1:35:08] but ye are washed such are some of you
[1:35:11] such are all of us amen you were this
[1:35:14] but now you're saying your wash you are
[1:35:16] Sanctified but you are justified in the
[1:35:19] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[1:35:23] of our God so catch us though it's a
[1:35:25] work of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:27] it is not the Holy Spirit itself but it
[1:35:30] is the work of the holy spirit that
[1:35:31] initial sanctification
[1:35:33] okay that's a big distinction as we go
[1:35:36] through the serious series is to
[1:35:38] differentiate between the work of the
[1:35:39] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit
[1:35:41] indwelling itself because they are two
[1:35:43] different things and they happen at two
[1:35:44] different times as we go through this
[1:35:46] we'll show you by the scriptures amen
[1:35:47] but then he would go to Ephesians 5 and
[1:35:49] say husbands love your wives even as
[1:35:51] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:35:53] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:35:56] and cleanse it how
[1:35:58] with the washing of Water by the word
[1:36:02] brother I would say this he says he the
[1:36:04] bridegroom took away your shame
[1:36:07] have you felt shame lately you don't
[1:36:09] have to feel it you don't have to feel
[1:36:11] shame he took your shame and listen he
[1:36:15] was naked
[1:36:16] he was beaten he was Bloody he was
[1:36:19] punched he was torn open in front of
[1:36:22] everybody that's as shameful as I can
[1:36:24] think about he did that so that you
[1:36:26] don't have to have shame this morning
[1:36:29] you say Lord you paid that price help me
[1:36:32] not to feel it
[1:36:33] he says and put it in the sea of
[1:36:35] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[1:36:37] water of the word and the blood of life
[1:36:39] that's what the Bible said the anointed
[1:36:41] bridegroom which foreordained you has
[1:36:44] washed you by the washing of the water
[1:36:46] he says by the church that doesn't sound
[1:36:48] right does it you might find that in the
[1:36:50] almanac but it's not in God's Bible he
[1:36:52] says it's by the washing of the Water by
[1:36:54] the word he says it's in the word see
[1:36:56] you are standing completely Justified as
[1:37:01] though you never did it in the beginning
[1:37:02] he says this is my message to the church
[1:37:06] now this is
[1:37:08] November 25th 1965. this is one month
[1:37:12] before he dies
[1:37:14] and he says this is my message now
[1:37:17] we've heard the sea the seals are open
[1:37:19] brother John the Mysteries have been
[1:37:21] revealed we've this is the invisible
[1:37:23] Union message we've heard Christ is a
[1:37:26] mystery of God revealed we've heard all
[1:37:27] of these amazing things he says this is
[1:37:29] my message to the church now you are
[1:37:32] standing if you're standing on God's
[1:37:34] word and with God's word every amen
[1:37:36] every jot every Tittle then you are the
[1:37:39] pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son
[1:37:42] of the Living God
[1:37:43] that's where you're standing today
[1:37:45] because if you don't believe that then
[1:37:47] how are you going to walk into adoption
[1:37:48] how are you going to walk into a Rapture
[1:37:50] in a resurrection how are you going to
[1:37:52] walk into the manifestation of the sons
[1:37:53] of God if you think you're no good
[1:37:55] you're good because he said you are
[1:37:57] virtuous you are spotless you are white
[1:38:00] you are washed you are free of wrinkles
[1:38:04] better than the Nigerians can do
[1:38:07] for the Kings he tells me they do white
[1:38:09] shirts better than anyone else
[1:38:11] God does it better than even the
[1:38:13] Nigerians
[1:38:16] he says you are the pure virtuous
[1:38:18] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[1:38:19] God every man and woman that's born of
[1:38:23] the spirit of God and washed in the
[1:38:26] blood of Jesus Christ and believes every
[1:38:29] word now there's three things going on
[1:38:31] there
[1:38:31] he says you've got to be born by the
[1:38:33] spirit you've got to have the Holy Ghost
[1:38:34] inside of you you've got to be washed in
[1:38:36] the blood of Jesus Christ you've got to
[1:38:37] accept the finished work of Calvary and
[1:38:39] you got to believe every word of God you
[1:38:41] do all of those he says you stand as
[1:38:43] though you never sinned at the first
[1:38:45] place you are perfect
[1:38:50] one month before he dies the prophet of
[1:38:52] God says if you're doing this you are
[1:38:54] perfect
[1:38:55] but let me tell you even if you weren't
[1:38:57] doing it then even if you're not doing
[1:38:59] it today you're perfect because he's for
[1:39:01] ordained you he's predestinated you to
[1:39:03] perfection in Christ Jesus
[1:39:09] so sister Lydia is perfect
[1:39:11] just as perfect as sister Maureen is
[1:39:14] and little Jensen
[1:39:16] is potentially as perfect as brother
[1:39:18] Marcus
[1:39:19] brother Gerald
[1:39:20] if you're filled with the spirit
[1:39:23] washed in the blood and believe in every
[1:39:25] word
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:29] but this the sanctification is a working
[1:39:32] of the Holy Spirit but you've got a part
[1:39:33] to play in sanctification
[1:39:35] because you got choices
[1:39:38] you know what you put your hand to you
[1:39:39] know what you put your eyes to you know
[1:39:40] what all of these different things you
[1:39:42] start to make choices in sanctification
[1:39:44] it's a working of the Holy Spirit to
[1:39:46] convict You by showing you in the word
[1:39:48] what you ought to do and what you ought
[1:39:49] not to do
[1:39:51] but you'll see here that there's a
[1:39:52] there's a gray area within this
[1:39:56] but this sanctification has a full body
[1:39:58] effect because we've got a full word
[1:39:59] we've got an open word to us
[1:40:01] but it's a process of time and that's
[1:40:03] why we have a word standard and not a
[1:40:05] church standard
[1:40:07] because there's things that I did when I
[1:40:09] was 25 that I don't do now and they were
[1:40:12] perfectly fine for me to do at 25 that
[1:40:14] they are definitely not fine for me to
[1:40:15] do now why because God is refining
[1:40:18] God is using me in a different way and
[1:40:21] there's things that I can't have in my
[1:40:22] life that weren't didn't have the the
[1:40:24] the effect that they would have today if
[1:40:26] I left them in my life
[1:40:27] why because I'm being used in a
[1:40:29] different way than I was 20 when I was
[1:40:30] 25 years old the scripture has lots of
[1:40:33] gray areas
[1:40:34] lots of gray areas Paul would talk about
[1:40:36] it he would say all things are lawful
[1:40:38] unto me but all things are not expedient
[1:40:41] now that doesn't mean that if the word
[1:40:43] says don't do it that it's lawful for
[1:40:44] you to do it that's not what he's saying
[1:40:46] but he's saying if there is nothing that
[1:40:47] forbids me to do it then I can do
[1:40:49] anything I want
[1:40:50] but he says all things are not expedient
[1:40:52] that word expedient means profitable
[1:40:55] in other words they don't add anything
[1:40:56] good to my life or anybody else's
[1:40:59] profitable in a in an eternal sense or a
[1:41:02] spiritual sense he says all things are
[1:41:04] lawful for me but I will not be brought
[1:41:08] under the power of any
[1:41:11] that means you won't be controlled by
[1:41:13] anything what does this look like it
[1:41:15] looks like addiction
[1:41:17] or idolatry and really they're both the
[1:41:19] same thing right you either can't let it
[1:41:21] go put it down or can't quit it can't
[1:41:22] walk away or else you put it ahead of
[1:41:24] the word of God in your life and you put
[1:41:26] it ahead of God's Kingdom Purpose for
[1:41:27] you
[1:41:28] the easiest way to know when you're
[1:41:30] under an influence is whether or not you
[1:41:32] can walk away and stay away
[1:41:34] if you say Oh Brother John this is this
[1:41:36] is something I just do it for fun it's
[1:41:38] no big deal okay lay it down for a week
[1:41:41] and if you can't lay it down for a week
[1:41:42] then it's got you
[1:41:44] it's really easy to check
[1:41:48] it's really easy to check you think
[1:41:49] you've got control over your phone
[1:41:51] lock yourself out after 30 minutes
[1:41:54] and see if you're still going back to
[1:41:56] change that lock
[1:41:59] you think you can handle that site you
[1:42:00] can think you can handle that form you
[1:42:01] think you can handle that game you think
[1:42:03] you can handle that friendship say
[1:42:04] goodbye once and see if you keep going
[1:42:06] back and if it is you're under the power
[1:42:09] of something and it ain't the Holy
[1:42:11] Spirit
[1:42:12] check it up
[1:42:14] say if I've got control then I ought to
[1:42:16] be able to walk away at any time
[1:42:18] and not pick it up again
[1:42:20] very simple preaching to myself
[1:42:23] amen there's only one power we're
[1:42:25] supposed to be under and that's the
[1:42:26] power of the anointed word which is the
[1:42:28] holy spirit in our lives and let me tell
[1:42:31] you that will not share its Glory with
[1:42:33] anything else it won't share its time
[1:42:34] with anything else you do that and that
[1:42:36] Holy Spirit will draw away
[1:42:38] and then the ceiling starts to become
[1:42:40] like a a brass ceiling right and your
[1:42:42] prayers aren't going up and you can't
[1:42:43] feel the presence of God and you can't
[1:42:44] enter into worship why because you play
[1:42:46] something ahead of him and he'll wait
[1:42:48] for you to get sick and tired of that
[1:42:49] condition
[1:42:50] and to walk away and say Lord I need
[1:42:51] Deliverance because something else has a
[1:42:53] hold of me
[1:42:55] Paul will continue Romans 8 he says and
[1:42:57] whom he justified them he also glorified
[1:42:59] he says now we've read that before that
[1:43:03] glorification we'll read it again in
[1:43:05] future services but that glorification
[1:43:07] represents adoption
[1:43:08] and adoption is the final result of the
[1:43:11] new birth amen but it comes at the end
[1:43:13] of the process of the new birth in part
[1:43:15] and it comes in fullness Paul says when
[1:43:18] we get our body changed that's the full
[1:43:20] adoption
[1:43:21] because that's when everything is pulled
[1:43:23] away that's when we get rid of the
[1:43:24] stinking sinful flesh that keeps keeps
[1:43:27] holding us up and keeps holding us back
[1:43:28] and causing us problems that's when we
[1:43:30] get that that's when we can be fully
[1:43:31] entrusted with everything
[1:43:33] but until that time there is an adoption
[1:43:35] process absolutely and we are placed
[1:43:38] positionally in the body of Christ
[1:43:39] absolutely as adopted Sons and Daughters
[1:43:42] of God but it's not the fullness of it
[1:43:43] but it is an adoption there's a trust in
[1:43:45] there that God has in it amen it's not
[1:43:47] at the end of our life or near the end
[1:43:49] of our life but that's the end of this
[1:43:50] process that we're talking about the
[1:43:52] order of life that coming to a new birth
[1:43:53] and we'll prove it in the scriptures as
[1:43:55] we go through he says and with all of
[1:43:57] that what shall we say to these things
[1:43:59] if God before us who can be against us
[1:44:02] in Ephesians 5 he says that he might
[1:44:04] present to himself a glorious church not
[1:44:06] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:44:10] but that it should be holy and without
[1:44:13] blemish his words not mine
[1:44:15] his process not mine his promise not
[1:44:19] mine
[1:44:21] his work not mine
[1:44:24] brother Brahm says this as we close he
[1:44:25] says and he has sent his transforming
[1:44:27] power to bring you out of this deformity
[1:44:30] of religion that you're in
[1:44:34] this deformity chaos that we're in God
[1:44:37] has sent his transforming power his word
[1:44:40] Vindicated proven to bring you out of
[1:44:42] this religious deformity of ignorance
[1:44:44] that you're walking in naked blind
[1:44:46] miserable and don't know it he says
[1:44:48] think of it friends you know God sent
[1:44:49] his transforming power to fulfill his
[1:44:52] word and change the whole body of Sarah
[1:44:56] and Abraham
[1:44:58] he said transformed an old man and an
[1:45:00] old woman why
[1:45:02] because he took pity on them
[1:45:04] because he promised he would do it
[1:45:08] because he promised he would do it he
[1:45:10] says and what God promises to do that
[1:45:13] he'll do he says any perverted thing God
[1:45:15] can't do nothing with it but he will
[1:45:18] keep his word and he'll send his spirit
[1:45:20] I the Lord have planted it
[1:45:23] I will water it day and night unless
[1:45:26] some should pluck it from my hands
[1:45:29] the Bible says that he says o wandering
[1:45:32] Stars he's talking to the congregation
[1:45:33] you with the desire in your heart you've
[1:45:36] got to have it or you wouldn't be
[1:45:38] sitting here this morning
[1:45:39] you wouldn't be in those churches and
[1:45:41] auditoriums and things you're in out
[1:45:42] across the land if something capital S
[1:45:45] something didn't bring you in there he
[1:45:47] says some person spoke to you he says
[1:45:50] don't go any further there is a washing
[1:45:52] of the Water by the word that will make
[1:45:55] you white as snow he says o sons of God
[1:45:58] listen don't stay in that deformity
[1:46:01] come out of it amen God bless you let's
[1:46:04] stand
[1:46:06] amen I need another 40 minutes or an
[1:46:08] hour to get through that new heart and
[1:46:10] new spirit portion and whatnot so we'll
[1:46:12] save that for Wednesday Lord willing but
[1:46:13] I'm trying to get you to see there is a
[1:46:15] process to this
[1:46:17] don't get frustrated
[1:46:20] if you don't have the Holy Ghost yet
[1:46:21] don't get frustrated because you don't
[1:46:22] have it recognize that there is a path
[1:46:24] there's a process there's a road to all
[1:46:26] of this and he shows us this clearing
[1:46:28] that clearly in his word it's not just a
[1:46:30] Doctrine it's not just an idea we've
[1:46:31] made up to kind of keep you going until
[1:46:33] you get the real thing but rather God
[1:46:34] works with us in the in the way that he
[1:46:36] says in his word amen listen we weren't
[1:46:39] it wasn't always obvious that we were
[1:46:40] children of God some of us were born and
[1:46:43] raised in a Christian home in this
[1:46:45] message and whatnot but some of us
[1:46:46] weren't
[1:46:47] and some of us went out and came back
[1:46:49] and some of us have stayed in all the
[1:46:51] way through and yet through it all we
[1:46:53] were children of God and we are children
[1:46:55] of God so don't look at it and say well
[1:46:57] it's not as far as you know I'm not as
[1:46:59] far as I thought I would be I was
[1:47:00] talking I think with brother Joel the
[1:47:01] other day we were talking about where
[1:47:03] we're at in our lives and you know when
[1:47:04] I got to to high school and I was in or
[1:47:07] you know in the second school I guess it
[1:47:09] wasn't really high school I was in
[1:47:10] seventh grade and you look at the 12th
[1:47:11] graders and you're like they're so cool
[1:47:13] they've got it all put together and you
[1:47:16] know they're big they got their muscles
[1:47:17] they got their facial hair
[1:47:19] you know they're fast they're agile they
[1:47:22] can shoot way better than me
[1:47:24] you say when I get there I'm going to be
[1:47:25] just like them and you know what you get
[1:47:27] there and you are just like them but
[1:47:29] it's no big deal
[1:47:31] because you've been growing
[1:47:34] you've been growing into maturity
[1:47:36] and the thing is we want to go from a
[1:47:38] grade seven to grade 12 like that and
[1:47:41] guess what we go through it so gradually
[1:47:42] that half the time we don't even realize
[1:47:43] what happened all the way along until we
[1:47:45] go
[1:47:46] and we can shoot a puck 80 miles an hour
[1:47:48] as before we used to do 40. now we can
[1:47:51] go roof Daddy on the net and it's no big
[1:47:52] deal right Jensen
[1:47:54] we can put it in the corners no problem
[1:47:56] why because we grew throughout it but if
[1:47:58] we got stuck on what we weren't
[1:48:01] it had ruined us in the process of
[1:48:03] becoming what we ought to be
[1:48:04] amen don't get frustrated where you're
[1:48:06] at say Lord I'm in the process
[1:48:09] even if you got the Holy Ghost we're
[1:48:12] still in a process we're still growing
[1:48:13] we're still maturing we're laying in the
[1:48:16] presence of the sun there's still things
[1:48:17] that are going on and that means there's
[1:48:19] things that dine out I said it before
[1:48:20] with the wheat in its final stage of
[1:48:22] maturity everything else dies there's no
[1:48:27] life there's no more nutrients coming up
[1:48:29] through the bottom
[1:48:30] it's just laying in the presence of the
[1:48:32] Sun and it's drawing out that perfect
[1:48:35] shape that perfect form that perfect
[1:48:37] seed so that what was put into the
[1:48:39] ground is showing exactly at the top of
[1:48:41] that weed at the end and it only comes
[1:48:43] by laying in the presence of God
[1:48:46] amen let's stay there
[1:48:49] let's stay in the presence of God let's
[1:48:50] stay in his word and say Lord let it
[1:48:52] have its perfect work in our lives amen
[1:48:54] let's bow our heads
[1:48:57] Heavenly Father
[1:48:58] Lord how beautiful it is to read
[1:49:01] Lord that you've made a way you made a
[1:49:03] path you've given a process Lord You've
[1:49:06] you put inside us Lord the very things
[1:49:08] we need to come to life Lord and when
[1:49:10] your Holy Spirit crosses our path when
[1:49:12] your word moves our way Lord when you're
[1:49:14] we come into your presence or something
[1:49:16] quickens us and it starts a process to
[1:49:18] bring us back into your presence Lord to
[1:49:20] bring us back into your word Lord to
[1:49:22] produce the thing that was laying
[1:49:24] dormant inside of us all this time Lord
[1:49:26] may you give us rest in it nor may we
[1:49:29] seek may we press toward the mark of the
[1:49:31] prize of the High Calling Lord but not
[1:49:33] beat ourselves up when we don't quite
[1:49:34] have it Lord we then we don't quite see
[1:49:37] it Lord when we see that there's more
[1:49:39] Lord but it's not in us yet Lord may we
[1:49:41] understand your process is perfect your
[1:49:43] word is perfect your way is perfect your
[1:49:46] timing is perfect Lord You Hold Us in
[1:49:48] the palms of your hands and you won't
[1:49:49] let a single one of us go Lord encourage
[1:49:52] us Lord fill us with your spirit Lord
[1:49:55] fill us again with your spirit Lord make
[1:49:58] us Lord help us to live this life
[1:49:59] naturally Lord that you called us to
[1:50:01] live we pray Lord bless each one
[1:50:03] remembering those that are sick Lord

[1:59:46] Winds of faith
[1:59:50] you can
[1:59:51] fly in a higher
[1:59:56] place and do not struggle
[2:00:02] and it's by grace
[2:00:06] set your wings to the
[2:00:11] Winds of faith
[2:00:15] watch the Eagles
[2:00:19] in the Sky
[2:00:22] What's your what's your Mountain
[2:00:27] much too high
[2:00:31] speak the word of God and by Empire
[2:00:39] it will move
[2:00:43] or you will fly
[2:00:48] set your wings
[2:00:51] to The Winds of faith
[2:00:56] you can
[2:00:58] fly in a higher place
[2:01:04] do not struggle
[2:01:08] it's by Grace
[2:01:12] set your wings
[2:01:15] to The Winds of Faith
[2:01:20] so watch the Eagles
[2:01:24] in the sky
[2:01:28] he does not struggle
[2:01:32] he does not
[2:01:35] strive
[2:01:36] for the power
[2:01:40] that makes him right
[2:01:44] rise is already
[2:01:49] in the sky
[2:01:52] so set your way
[2:01:56] thanks to the Winds of faith
[2:02:01] you can
[2:02:03] fly in a higher place
[2:02:09] did I struggle
[2:02:13] it's my grace
[2:02:17] set your wings
[2:02:20] to The Winds of Faith to sold there for
[2:02:24] a sec
[2:02:25] you know I was reading
[2:02:27] he's got God God's got four anointings
[2:02:29] he's got a man Ox he's got an eagle and
[2:02:32] a lion
[2:02:33] do you know the Eagles at the end
[2:02:35] you can keep playing sister
[2:02:37] sorry the Eagles at the end and it's for
[2:02:39] a reason
[2:02:41] because this is the time of troubles
[2:02:43] this is a time of tribulations this is
[2:02:45] the time of the greatest difficulty this
[2:02:47] is the time when the earth is groaning
[2:02:49] we're back in a solemn condition but
[2:02:51] it's even worse than Sodom ever was
[2:02:54] and we're facing persecution we're
[2:02:56] facing difficulties in lives we're
[2:02:58] facing our own human frailties but this
[2:03:01] nature of an eagle is that it lets
[2:03:03] trouble lift it up
[2:03:05] because brother Brown says remember when
[2:03:07] that storm comes the eagle sets his
[2:03:09] wings into that storm and it carries him
[2:03:11] up to where there is no storm
[2:03:14] amen the nature of an eagle is to rise
[2:03:16] above it
[2:03:17] every other bird goes through it
[2:03:20] but the eagle uses it to rise above it
[2:03:22] because it can breathe at a higher place
[2:03:25] it can stay up there indefinitely buoyed
[2:03:27] by The Winds of everything that's going
[2:03:29] on around it and it'll take those and
[2:03:31] it'll lift it up
[2:03:33] that's how you know when you're an eagle
[2:03:34] is when the the the trials of Life
[2:03:37] aren't breaking you down
[2:03:39] but they're lifting you up they're
[2:03:41] drawing you up towards the God they're
[2:03:43] drawing you up into Heavenly places
[2:03:44] they're drawing you into the promise of
[2:03:46] your position in Christ and there you
[2:03:49] start to realize I meant to go over it I
[2:03:52] meant to stay above it even while it's
[2:03:54] going on yet I can be above it that my
[2:03:58] nature isn't bothered by it my nature
[2:04:00] actually uses it for its benefit rather
[2:04:04] than letting itself get beat up about it
[2:04:05] man we're going to sing that third verse
[2:04:08] says watch the eagle in the sky
[2:04:10] right he doesn't struggle he doesn't
[2:04:13] strive everything around him you could
[2:04:15] have a a force five hurricane underneath
[2:04:17] him and he just sits there and he just
[2:04:20] can ride it out
[2:04:21] and then we're in the time of a
[2:04:23] hurricane season coming up
[2:04:25] we're in a place where extreme weather
[2:04:27] is the norm
[2:04:28] and yet we go through it and it's no big
[2:04:31] deal to us why because we've got a
[2:04:32] nature that can handle it and it's the
[2:04:35] same for the believer when those times
[2:04:36] come and things aren't going the way you
[2:04:38] thought and it's not the way you you you
[2:04:40] saw it happening in your head and it's
[2:04:43] just not working out that way what do
[2:04:44] you do it lifts you up
[2:04:46] in the word closer to God and you say
[2:04:49] lord it's all in your hands
[2:04:51] you're giving me wings to fly so I'm
[2:04:53] Gonna Fly
[2:04:54] the claws are not for holding onto
[2:04:56] branches the claws are for food
[2:04:58] but the wings are to fly and I'm Gonna
[2:05:01] Fly Lord I'm gonna use this to draw me
[2:05:03] closer to you I'm going to get closer to
[2:05:05] where I'm supposed to be and stay away
[2:05:07] from this Earth where all the problems
[2:05:08] are amen let's sing this one more time
[2:05:10] as brother Kingsley comes to pray
[2:05:14] so watch the Eagles
[2:05:19] in the
[2:05:21] sky
[2:05:23] he does not
[2:05:25] struggle he does not strive
[2:05:31] for the power
[2:05:35] that makes him right
[2:05:39] is already
[2:05:44] in the skies so set your
[2:05:50] wings to The Winds of faith
[2:05:56] you can
[2:05:58] fly in a higher place so do not struggle
[2:06:08] it's by Grace
[2:06:12] set your wings
[2:06:15] to The Winds of faith
