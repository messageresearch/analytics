[42:27] we get into the word this morning or
[42:29] this evening. It says, "There was a man
[42:30] of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a
[42:32] ruler of the Jews that came to Jesus by
[42:35] night and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
[42:37] that thou art a teacher come from God,
[42:40] for no man can do these miracles that
[42:42] thou doest except God be with him."
[42:45] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[42:46] seats again this evening. Amen. We're
[42:48] preaching the last service on this
[42:50] thought of the restoration message. We
[42:52] took this little detour away from our
[42:54] thought on the mystery finished and we
[42:57] had to preach about why there's even a
[42:58] mystery to be finished and how it's
[43:00] going to come and these different
[43:01] things. Amen. And so we spoke last
[43:03] service about the son of man ministry of
[43:05] Jesus Christ while he was here in flesh.
[43:07] Amen. 2,000 years ago in that prophetic
[43:10] anointing that discerns the thoughts and
[43:12] intents of the heart and tells people
[43:14] things about themselves. And the point
[43:16] remember was not to wow the people.
[43:19] That's never what God send signs and
[43:20] wonders for. for not to make people go.
[43:23] No, it's to catch their attention and
[43:25] it's to prepare them for what God really
[43:27] wants to do. And that's to reach into
[43:29] their lives. Amen. And do something with
[43:31] them. And God used a tremendous healing
[43:33] ministry and a and a discerning ministry
[43:35] through brother Brandon for decades. But
[43:36] the point was to get the people's
[43:38] attention for what was really his true
[43:41] intended purpose when he came in that
[43:43] final Son of Man ministry in this age.
[43:45] Amen. And I want to take us back to the
[43:46] original son of man ministry to Jesus
[43:48] ministry to see how he dealt with people
[43:50] and how his ministry changed and how it
[43:53] grew. And we know that Jesus was trying
[43:55] to turn a corner in that day. Amen.
[43:56] They've been going along for such a long
[43:58] while in the teachings and the of men
[44:00] and the doctrines of men and the
[44:02] traditions of men. And he was trying to
[44:03] get them to turn a corner. And that
[44:05] corner was into a new gospel. And it was
[44:07] into a gospel of grace. And it was a
[44:08] gospel of leadership of the Holy Spirit
[44:11] and these different things. But he's got
[44:12] to do the same thing today. Amen. And
[44:14] the son of man ministry came to turn a
[44:15] corner then and it came today to turn a
[44:18] corner as well. And so we see what they
[44:20] did then they'll do today. What he did
[44:21] then he'll do today. And they'll have
[44:23] the same responses for each different
[44:25] group that's represented there. But we
[44:27] opened up with this story of Nicodemus
[44:29] coming to Jesus. And I always have to
[44:31] smile a bit because Nicodemus comes. He
[44:33] says, "Hey, we know that you're a man
[44:35] sent from God, but he comes at night.
[44:38] lest anybody hear him say that he thinks
[44:40] that he is a man that's been sent from
[44:42] God that God is with him. But I want to
[44:44] just go through this bit by bit because
[44:46] it kind of points to where the son of
[44:48] man ministry goes and how he preaches
[44:50] and how he says things. It says there
[44:52] was a man of the Pharisees named
[44:53] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. That
[44:56] same came to Jesus by night and said
[44:58] unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art
[45:00] a teacher come from God. For no man can
[45:02] do these miracles that thou doest except
[45:05] God be with him."
[45:07] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[45:08] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[45:11] a man be born again, he cannot see the
[45:14] kingdom of God." So watch now. He comes,
[45:16] he says, "Jesus, we know you're that God
[45:18] is with you." And Jesus immediately says
[45:20] something to challenge his belief of
[45:22] whether or not God is with him. Amen.
[45:24] That phrase born again had never been
[45:26] used in the scripture before this. It's
[45:28] not written in the in the books of
[45:29] Moses. It's not written in the the law
[45:31] and the prophets. Amen. It's never been
[45:33] spoken. Now Jesus comes and he uses a
[45:36] new phrase with Nicodemus. And church,
[45:38] Nicodemus didn't come trying to make a a
[45:41] mess of Jesus. He didn't come trying to
[45:42] trick him. He came in sincerity. He came
[45:45] with good questions. Amen. And Nicodemus
[45:47] saith unto him, "How can a man be born
[45:49] when he is old? Can he enter a second
[45:52] time into his mother's womb and be
[45:54] born?" So Nicodemus has no clue what
[45:56] this this idea of being born again is
[45:58] all about this concept that Jesus is
[46:00] telling him about. says, "And Jesus
[46:02] answered and said unto him, verily,
[46:04] verily, I say unto thee, now he said,
[46:06] except a man be born again." Now he
[46:08] says, "Except a man be born of water and
[46:10] of the spirit, he cannot enter into the
[46:13] kingdom of God." He says, "That which is
[46:15] born of flesh is flesh, and that which
[46:18] is born of spirit is spirit. Marvel not
[46:21] that I said unto thee, ye must be born
[46:23] again." So Jesus is going a little
[46:24] further. He's explaining what he was
[46:27] talking about and he's trying to see if
[46:28] Nicodemus will catch where he's coming
[46:30] from in the scripture. He says, "The
[46:33] wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
[46:35] hearest the sound thereof, but can't not
[46:37] tell whence it cometh and whether it
[46:39] goeth. So is everyone that is born of
[46:41] the spirit." In other words, when
[46:43] somebody is led by the spirit, there's
[46:45] no nothing to tell you why they're doing
[46:47] what they're doing. It may not make
[46:48] sense. It may not have rhyme or reason.
[46:50] They're doing it and it's no there's no
[46:52] idea why they're doing it. He says
[46:55] that's what people are like that are
[46:56] born of the spirit. Now he's telling
[46:58] them what being born again is. He says
[47:00] he has to be born of water and of
[47:03] spirit. Now that's the word and the
[47:05] spirit. That's how we are born again.
[47:06] People will preach that and they say,
[47:07] "Well, that's water baptism." But
[47:09] church, we're not born of water. We're
[47:11] not born of water. We're born of the
[47:13] word because we got to be born as Christ
[47:16] was born. He was born by a word and then
[47:18] he was born by the spirit. Amen. He was
[47:20] born by the word. Amen. A virgin shall
[47:22] conceive. His name will be called
[47:24] wonderful counselor, mighty God,
[47:25] everlasting father. His name will be
[47:27] called Jesus. And that which is in you
[47:29] will be by what? The Holy Spirit. He was
[47:31] born by a word spoken. And then he the
[47:34] spirit brought him to life. Amen. And we
[47:36] were born of the word just as Jesus was.
[47:39] We are born of the word because our
[47:40] names were written in the lamb's book of
[47:42] life before the foundation of the world.
[47:44] And then the Holy Spirit comes and
[47:46] quickens us into new life. And we're a
[47:49] new creation in Christ then. Amen. We're
[47:51] the fulfillment of the word. It's where
[47:53] we come from and so we must fulfill it.
[47:55] Amen. But he says we have to be born of
[47:57] the water and the spirit, the word and
[47:59] the spirit. It says, "And Nicodemus
[48:02] answered and said unto him, how can
[48:03] these things be?" Nicodemus still
[48:04] doesn't get what Jesus is talking about.
[48:06] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[48:08] "Art thou a master of Israel and knowest
[48:11] not these things?" Church, Jesus isn't
[48:13] just pulling doctrine out of thin air.
[48:16] He's not making stuff up on the spot.
[48:18] He's preaching out of the word that's
[48:20] already been given to that man. He's
[48:23] preaching the new birth. You go back to
[48:25] Ezekiel 36 and it shows you exactly what
[48:28] it is. The sprinkling of clean water.
[48:30] Amen. It's the washing of water by the
[48:32] word and then by the spirit. It's the
[48:34] spirit of God coming inside of the
[48:36] believer. Amen. It's all there. And he
[48:38] says, "Listen, you're a master of
[48:40] Israel. Today we'd say you're a doctor
[48:42] of divinity and you don't know what I'm
[48:45] talking about. How is it possible that
[48:47] you don't know what I'm talking about?
[48:48] That's what Jesus is saying to him. He
[48:50] says, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[48:52] we speak that we do know and testify
[48:55] that we have seen, and you receive not
[48:57] our witness." Jesus says, "Listen, I'm
[48:59] not just talking about this. I am proof
[49:01] of a birth by word, by water, and by
[49:03] spirit." I know what it is because I'm a
[49:06] product of it. I have I have been born
[49:08] the way that you've got to be born
[49:10] again. I'm not just making it up. He
[49:12] says, "This is stuff that we know about
[49:14] and we're talking about." He says, "If I
[49:16] have told you earthly things and you
[49:18] believe not, how shall you believe if I
[49:20] tell you heavenly things?" In other
[49:21] words, if they couldn't take what Jesus
[49:23] did in the physical, in the natural,
[49:25] that was obvious, that was clear, if
[49:27] they couldn't believe that, he says,
[49:28] "How are you going to believe something
[49:29] you can't see that you have to take by
[49:30] faith?" Remember what brother Bram says?
[49:32] He says, "You can't teach Pentecostal
[49:35] babies supernatural things. You can't
[49:37] teach somebody algebra if they don't
[49:39] know their ABCs." And he's saying,
[49:41] "Nicodemus, how is it that you don't
[49:43] even understand the ABCs?"
[49:45] Because what he was doing is he was
[49:47] trying to show Nicodemus they were at a
[49:48] junction in time, that there was a
[49:50] changing of the dispensation, that there
[49:52] was a changing in the way they were
[49:53] going to believe, the way they were
[49:55] going to worship, the way they were
[49:56] going to function. He says, "You got to
[49:57] have a new birth. This kingdom you're
[49:59] looking for is going to come by water
[50:00] and by spirit. That's what you're
[50:03] looking for. You're not coming, it's not
[50:04] going to come by the Romans being kicked
[50:06] out. It's going to come a different
[50:07] way." And why doesn't Nicodemus get it,
[50:09] church? He's a master of Israel. He's
[50:11] got a an LLD. He's got a doctor of
[50:14] divinity. He's been st taught in their
[50:16] best seminaries. He's been studying this
[50:18] all his life in sincerity. And why
[50:21] doesn't he understand it? Because
[50:23] they've been preaching, teaching for
[50:25] doctrines, the commandments of men. And
[50:27] so what he's been feeding on is the
[50:30] understanding of men rather than the
[50:33] understanding of God. He's been steeped
[50:35] in what they've had th hundreds and
[50:37] hundreds of years to build up. And they
[50:39] they're so set in tradition. They're so
[50:41] set in stone. They're so set in what the
[50:43] church has always said and that that
[50:45] when Jesus comes with a revelation of
[50:47] what that word really meant, he doesn't
[50:49] have a clue what he's talking about. And
[50:51] it blows his mind. He says, "How how is
[50:53] this even possible? How is this going to
[50:54] be? How does this even work?" Remember
[50:56] when Jesus was in the temple just before
[50:58] he he goes for his crucifixion, remember
[51:01] he had to be examined by the priests for
[51:03] days on end. And then they they declared
[51:05] him they found no fault in him. Amen.
[51:07] And they come to him with these these
[51:09] trick questions and these these fake
[51:10] questions and they make up a scenario
[51:12] and try and trip him up. Amen. And they
[51:14] always remember when they came to Jesus
[51:16] church, they weren't looking for truth.
[51:19] They were looking to trip him up. Now,
[51:21] let me tell you today, if you see
[51:23] somebody's just talking to you to try
[51:24] and trip you up, what do you do?
[51:27] Turn around and walk away. Disengage.
[51:30] Disengage. There's no reason to talk to
[51:33] somebody who's trying to trip you up.
[51:35] But if they come in sincerity, you can
[51:37] answer. And their attitude will prove
[51:40] how they're coming. Amen. But they were
[51:42] not coming to receive truth. They were
[51:44] coming to try and trip him up to get him
[51:46] to say something that they could use
[51:48] against him that they could weaponize
[51:49] and say, "Aha, this is who he really is.
[51:51] This is what he really believes. People
[51:53] have nothing to do with him." Remember
[51:55] what they did? They they said, "Hey,
[51:57] Jesus, a man got married. He had a wife
[52:01] and he died and they didn't have kids.
[52:03] Now he had six other brothers and so the
[52:05] way they did it back in those days was
[52:07] that the brother would go have relation
[52:09] with the wife to try and cause her to
[52:11] have a child so that the family name
[52:12] could carry on. He said so the next
[52:14] brother came in and married her and died
[52:18] with no children and they went down
[52:19] through the line. So in the end seven
[52:21] brothers had married the same woman had
[52:23] all been intimate with her and they said
[52:26] and then finally the woman died. So you
[52:27] have seven men dead, you have the woman
[52:29] dead, they're up in heaven. Who's
[52:30] married to her? Whose wife is she?
[52:33] Now, that's a good question, but it's a
[52:35] pretty awkward situation to be dealing
[52:38] with in church.
[52:40] But they're just trying to trip Jesus
[52:42] up. But watch what Jesus says now. Now,
[52:45] we're talking about the son of man
[52:46] ministry. I want you to catch what's
[52:48] going on here because it's got to happen
[52:49] again in our day. And Jesus answered and
[52:51] said unto them, "Ye do
[52:55] not knowing the scriptures nor the power
[52:57] of God." I love that. He says, "You
[52:59] don't know the word and you don't know
[53:01] the power of God." These are the
[53:03] Sadducees that are asking this because
[53:05] the Sadducees didn't even believe in the
[53:07] resurrection. He says, "And you're
[53:09] asking me about a doctrine you don't
[53:10] even believe in." He says, "You don't
[53:13] know the scriptures. Resurrection's in
[53:15] the scriptures if you see it. You don't
[53:16] believe in the resurrection. So why are
[53:18] you asking me about the resurrection?
[53:22] If you don't believe what I believe,
[53:23] then why are you asking me about what I
[53:25] believe?" But he says not only that you
[53:28] don't believe you don't know the power
[53:29] of God because your belief your unbelief
[53:32] what you believe what you've accepted as
[53:34] your your religion has completely
[53:36] nullified the power of God to do
[53:38] anything according to his word in your
[53:39] life. He says you don't have a clue
[53:41] because you've already decided what is
[53:44] right and what is true and therefore God
[53:46] can't work with you. He says for in the
[53:48] resurrection they neither marry nor are
[53:50] given in marriage but are as the angels
[53:52] of God in heaven. There's no marriage
[53:54] between people up in heaven. Why?
[53:56] Because we're married to Christ. It's
[53:58] the bride and Christ. It's not
[53:59] relationship between myself and Blanca.
[54:01] We're now a part of the bride. And we're
[54:02] all married to Christ. Okay? He says,
[54:07] answer number one. Then he says, "But as
[54:09] touching the resurrection of the dead,
[54:10] have you not read that which was spoken
[54:12] of you by God, saying," Now, I want you
[54:14] to see this. This is such a simple
[54:16] answer, church. How would you answer to
[54:18] them and say, "What about the the the
[54:20] resurrection? How do we know that
[54:22] there's a resurrection? How do we know
[54:24] that there's something beyond this
[54:25] death? And Jesus goes and he pulls one
[54:28] simple phrase. I don't believe any
[54:30] theologian today, I don't believe any of
[54:32] us would have come up with this answer.
[54:34] But the word knows the word. And he
[54:36] says, don't you know what God said? He
[54:38] said, I am the God of Abraham and the
[54:41] God of Jacob, or sorry, the God of Isaac
[54:43] and the God of Jacob. God is not the God
[54:46] of the dead, but of the living. His
[54:48] point is that God said, "I am the God of
[54:51] Abraham after Abraham was dead.
[54:54] I am the God of Jacob after Jacob was
[54:57] dead. I am the God of Isaac after Isaac
[54:59] was dead." He says, he didn't say, "I
[55:02] was the God." He says, "I am the God."
[55:04] Even after they're dead, I am still
[55:06] their God. He says, why is that? Because
[55:08] God is a God of the living, not the God
[55:11] of the dead. He says they're alive
[55:12] elsewhere.
[55:14] Death is just a portal to another
[55:15] dimension. They're waiting over there.
[55:17] They're alive. He's still their God.
[55:19] They're still his children.
[55:22] What a simple answer to such a huge
[55:25] concept. I am the God of the living. He
[55:28] says, "That's the proof of the
[55:30] resurrection." How simple is that?
[55:33] That's what the son of man ministry does
[55:35] is he goes and he will just take that
[55:36] simple thing and say, "There's your
[55:38] proof." And they had no answer to it.
[55:41] They had no answer to it. It says, "But
[55:43] look at this." He said, "But when the
[55:45] multitude heard this, they were
[55:47] astonished at his doctrine." Amen. Jesus
[55:51] was dealing with men that didn't believe
[55:52] the promise of the word. They didn't
[55:54] believe in the supernatural. And
[55:55] therefore, they ridiculed the idea of
[55:57] any of those things happening in real
[55:59] life. Amen. It was beyond their limited
[56:01] imagination. Their foregone conclusions
[56:03] about what the word meant limited them
[56:06] from experiencing the fullness of it. So
[56:08] what did Jesus do? He answers them in
[56:10] simplicity from the very word that they
[56:12] profess to believe. and he proves them
[56:14] wrong. Amen.
[56:16] But they have no response. Why? Because
[56:18] they hadn't been taught a response. All
[56:21] they knew was their creeds and their
[56:22] dogmas. And he undid it with one simple
[56:24] phrase. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac,
[56:27] and Jacob.
[56:29] And you know what they did? They went,
[56:31] "Huh?
[56:33] Yeah, whatever." And walked away. They
[56:36] walked away. What is it? They had all
[56:38] the prophets to read from. Church, they
[56:40] were working with the same material
[56:41] Jesus had.
[56:43] the exact same material. Jesus never
[56:45] came and added one word. He preached out
[56:48] of the same Bible, out of the same
[56:50] scriptures that they had. They had the
[56:52] same material, but they had lost the
[56:54] reality of the word by their own
[56:56] traditions. And when the reality came,
[56:58] they couldn't accept it. Amen. They were
[57:00] so secure in their in their religion,
[57:02] their self-proclaimed righteousness,
[57:04] that when righteousness itself came
[57:05] their way, when the fulfillment of the
[57:07] word came their way, they couldn't
[57:08] accept it. Let me put it this way,
[57:10] church. There's a difference between
[57:12] religion and truth. There's a difference
[57:14] between your beliefs and faith. Amen.
[57:18] There's a difference between theology
[57:20] and the word of God. Amen. And what we
[57:22] see here is a prime example of that. He
[57:24] was making it very obvious what these
[57:26] men had. Amen. That what they had was
[57:28] nothing more than religious hot air.
[57:31] That's all it was. They had nothing
[57:34] redeeming about them in their teachings
[57:36] and in their way of life. Look what
[57:38] Jesus Look what it said after Jesus had
[57:40] finished preaching earlier in Matthew.
[57:42] It says it came to pass when Jesus had
[57:44] ended these things the people were
[57:46] astonished at his doctrine. Why are they
[57:48] astonished church? It says for he taught
[57:51] them as one having authority and not as
[57:55] the scribes. Oh man, that would be the
[57:59] worst if somebody came in and said,
[58:01] "Boy, he preaches so different than
[58:03] brother John. He preaches like he knows
[58:05] what he's talking about.
[58:07] That would that would cut me to the
[58:09] core.
[58:10] That would hurt. I don't mind if you say
[58:13] somebody's more dynamic than me because
[58:15] that's not hard. But if they say, "Boy,
[58:17] he preaches in a way that shows us that
[58:19] he knows what he's talking about and
[58:20] brother John, he just doesn't do that."
[58:22] That would hurt. And that's what Jesus
[58:24] did there is that people said, "Boy, he
[58:26] preaches in a way we've never heard
[58:28] before. He preaches like he really knows
[58:30] what he's talking about, like he's
[58:33] experienced it, like he has it." Amen.
[58:35] Jesus wasn't one to back down from
[58:37] calling things the way they were. But
[58:38] you'll see that anytime somebody came in
[58:40] sincerity, in humility, or with a real
[58:44] need, he always responded. Jew or
[58:46] Gentile, it didn't matter. If they came
[58:48] in sincerity and humility with a real
[58:50] need, he always responded well. What he
[58:52] didn't respond well to was people that
[58:54] were full of themselves. people that had
[58:56] all the answers or people that were
[58:59] insincere in their requests and were
[59:01] looking for affirmation
[59:03] rather than a change in their life
[59:05] rather than to let truth do the work
[59:07] rather people that were too dignified to
[59:09] admit that they were wrong. He'd say
[59:11] this to the Bible scholars and priests
[59:13] of that day and says and the father
[59:15] himself which has sent me borne witness
[59:18] of me for ye have neither heard his
[59:20] voice at any time nor seen a shape. He
[59:22] says, "And you have not his word abiding
[59:25] in you." Now, this is one of the most
[59:27] critical thoughts you'll find when it
[59:29] comes to how do you know a believer.
[59:31] Watch how Jesus proves that they don't
[59:32] have the word of God in them. He says,
[59:35] "For whom he has sent him you believe
[59:38] not." See, everyone's pointing to God up
[59:41] there. And when God comes down with a
[59:43] message, they turn it off. Why? Because
[59:46] they've already got their own message.
[59:48] They've got their own gospel. They've
[59:49] got their own religion. And they've got
[59:50] their own creeds, dogmas, the theology,
[59:53] all these different things. Amen. And so
[59:55] today, what do they say? I believe God's
[59:56] word. I believe Jesus. I've accepted him
[1:00:00] as my savior, savior. And then God sends
[1:00:03] down his messenger with a message. And
[1:00:04] what do they do? They turn him away.
[1:00:07] Why? Because they don't have his word
[1:00:08] abiding in their heart. They've got
[1:00:10] something else in there. Amen. That they
[1:00:12] reject the word that God sends. And that
[1:00:14] is the proof that they don't have the
[1:00:16] word abiding in them. He says, "Listen,
[1:00:18] search the scriptures, for in them you
[1:00:20] think you have eternal life, and they
[1:00:22] are they which testify of me." This is
[1:00:24] what I tell people to do, church. I say,
[1:00:26] if you've got questions, study the
[1:00:29] scriptures. Don't study your church
[1:00:32] theology. Go study from Genesis to
[1:00:35] Revelation and pull what you believe all
[1:00:38] the way through there. I said, ba, I say
[1:00:40] better than that. Don't pull what you
[1:00:42] believe. go look for what the scripture
[1:00:44] says about it and then make your belief
[1:00:46] based on what the scripture says. If you
[1:00:48] go in with a foregone conclusion, you're
[1:00:50] probably not going to find it. But if
[1:00:51] you really want to know what it says, if
[1:00:53] you really want to know what it means,
[1:00:54] pull it from Genesis to Revelation and
[1:00:57] those scriptures will line up. We can't
[1:00:58] cherrypick scriptures. And I hope you've
[1:01:01] seen that as I've done this little short
[1:01:03] five-part series on on a restoration
[1:01:05] message and why we believe in a prophet
[1:01:06] these things. I haven't shied away from
[1:01:08] scriptures that people use to try and
[1:01:10] disprove it. But scripture lines upon
[1:01:12] scripture, word upon word, line upon
[1:01:14] line, and they've all got to build a
[1:01:16] picture that agrees with itself. Amen.
[1:01:18] We can't be scared to do that. He says,
[1:01:20] "And you will not come to me." He says,
[1:01:22] "That ye might have life." I was talking
[1:01:24] to a man last year over a couple of
[1:01:26] months, and he'd reached out to me. He
[1:01:28] had many spiritual questions, many
[1:01:30] scriptural questions. He had some some
[1:01:31] personal issues he wanted me to talk to
[1:01:33] him about. And then then he said, "Hey,
[1:01:35] while I've got you on the phone, can I
[1:01:36] can I ask you just some some Bible
[1:01:38] questions?" I said, "Sure." He says,
[1:01:39] "Does does the true church go through
[1:01:41] the tribulation?"
[1:01:43] He says, "We're doing a Bible study.
[1:01:44] We're doing these Bible studies. We do
[1:01:45] these three-hour Bible studies." He
[1:01:47] said, "And we're we're doing a study on
[1:01:48] the tribulation." He says, "And we've
[1:01:50] got a mixed group here. We've got some
[1:01:51] people saying that we don't go through
[1:01:53] the tribulation, some that we go through
[1:01:55] partway through the tribulation, and
[1:01:56] some that we are we we go we we we're
[1:01:58] we're taken away at the end of it." I
[1:02:00] said, "Well, it's got to go before.
[1:02:02] You've got to go before." I said, "We're
[1:02:03] we were judged in Christ." And I went
[1:02:05] through all these scriptures with him ju
[1:02:06] just off the top of my head. And he
[1:02:08] said, "You know what I like?" He says,
[1:02:09] "What I like," he says, "sort giving me
[1:02:11] scriptures from the whole Bible." He
[1:02:13] says, "Cuz when we're studying, we're
[1:02:14] just looking at one little portion."
[1:02:17] Now, that's okay. I said, "That's okay,
[1:02:18] cuz sometimes you're getting into the
[1:02:20] depths of it. But if you have a Bible
[1:02:21] question, you got to get a Bible answer,
[1:02:23] not just a one verse answer." Now, there
[1:02:26] may be things in the scripture that are
[1:02:27] only mentioned once. Do we throw them
[1:02:28] away? No. God mentioned them. They're
[1:02:30] good. Amen. that's good enough for us.
[1:02:33] But he he said, "That's what I like." He
[1:02:35] said, "Is that we're so stuck in this
[1:02:37] one little spot that we aren't getting
[1:02:39] an answer and we finish after three
[1:02:40] hours and nobody knows what's right and
[1:02:42] what's wrong." He says, "But you've
[1:02:44] given me an answer through the entire
[1:02:45] scripture." He said, "I appreciate
[1:02:47] that." We talked about jud uh the
[1:02:49] original sin and godhead and these
[1:02:51] different things. And and and so I just
[1:02:54] when I was studying this, I actually
[1:02:55] went through and I reread everything I
[1:02:56] wrote to him and and I put a lot of time
[1:02:58] and effort into I put hours of study
[1:03:00] into it to just reconfirm to him why I
[1:03:02] believe what I believe in these
[1:03:04] different things. Amen. But in the end,
[1:03:06] he rejected what I had to say about so
[1:03:08] many things.
[1:03:10] He said, I notice, he says, you quote
[1:03:13] this this this this William Brandham a
[1:03:15] lot in your services. He listened to
[1:03:16] some of our services. I said, 'Yes, I
[1:03:18] do. He says, 'Well, I don't agree with
[1:03:19] everything he says. I said, ' Okay, why
[1:03:23] not? Well, da da da da da. I said, 'But
[1:03:26] where are your scriptures for that?' And
[1:03:28] I we, you know, Godhead was a real
[1:03:30] sticking point. Original sin was was
[1:03:32] impossible for him to accept. But I
[1:03:34] said, if you can't answer my questions
[1:03:36] about the original sin, which I've
[1:03:38] answered to you by the Bible, I said,
[1:03:39] you got some serious issues with what
[1:03:41] you believe. I said, 'How can you answer
[1:03:43] these these these these questions I
[1:03:45] raise unless it it it is through the
[1:03:47] original sin as I've described it. He
[1:03:49] says, 'I don't know. I just believe it
[1:03:50] was a simple test of faith, simple test
[1:03:53] of obedience. Do it or don't do it. I
[1:03:55] said, but there's so much that comes out
[1:03:57] of that. There's so many things that
[1:03:58] Jesus said. There's things that are in
[1:03:59] the genealogies. There's things that
[1:04:01] Paul said in these different things. I
[1:04:02] said, these all point to this. I said,
[1:04:04] 'What are you going to do with that? He
[1:04:05] said, 'Well, I just I can't accept it.
[1:04:07] Why, church? Because where he is, they
[1:04:09] don't preach what I preach. And it's
[1:04:11] that simple. He's in a a I wouldn't call
[1:04:14] denominations. It's kind of a
[1:04:15] semi-independent group.
[1:04:18] And I listened to to just some portions
[1:04:20] of what his pastor preached, and it was
[1:04:22] generally good, solid, basic Christian
[1:04:25] preaching. But when you start getting
[1:04:27] into specifics, they fall apart. When
[1:04:29] you start getting into the book of
[1:04:30] Revelation, they don't have a clue. And
[1:04:32] what you find out is that they really
[1:04:33] don't have a clue about much,
[1:04:35] unfortunately. But his problem was, this
[1:04:37] is too different from what I'm hearing.
[1:04:39] There's no way it could be this.
[1:04:43] What a shame. But I'll tell you this,
[1:04:44] church. His attitude was wonderful. His
[1:04:46] spirit was wonderful. I don't write him
[1:04:48] off because he's rejected it. By no
[1:04:50] means do we write people off because
[1:04:52] they reject it the first time. Listen, I
[1:04:54] know of a brother in Quebec that was in
[1:04:56] the message and he walked away from it
[1:04:58] and he spent 25 years seeking for truth
[1:05:00] only to come right back to the message
[1:05:02] and say, "I had it all along and didn't
[1:05:03] know it." Church is not over till it's
[1:05:06] over. As long as we're here, God is
[1:05:09] still calling people. The only thing
[1:05:11] holding him back is that the last one
[1:05:12] isn't in. And I say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:05:14] That means there's a chance for our
[1:05:16] loved ones. Amen. But we aren't there to
[1:05:18] judge people because they turn us down
[1:05:19] the first time. Listen, God's got a time
[1:05:21] and a season for every one of his
[1:05:23] children to come in. Remember that
[1:05:24] woman, Brother Brandham saw on the other
[1:05:26] side of uh on the on the other side of
[1:05:28] the curtain of time. And the young woman
[1:05:30] came up to him and she greeted him. He
[1:05:31] says, "Do I know you?" She said, "You
[1:05:32] led me to Christ." And she was over 90
[1:05:34] years old.
[1:05:36] over 90 years old and she finally gave
[1:05:38] her heart to Christ and she was there.
[1:05:40] Look at the thief on the cross, church,
[1:05:42] a few hours before he died, seemingly in
[1:05:45] a hopeless condition,
[1:05:47] lost in sin, judged for his mistakes,
[1:05:52] and God puts himself on the cross right
[1:05:54] next to him and says, "Today you'll be
[1:05:56] with me in paradise." What a wonderful
[1:05:58] thing. What a wonderful thing. Amen.
[1:06:02] But people are scared away because they
[1:06:04] hear something they haven't heard
[1:06:05] before. And we saw it in Jesus day. Look
[1:06:09] what Jesus preached. And I know I
[1:06:10] preached on this many times, so I'm not
[1:06:12] going to belabor it tonight, but just to
[1:06:14] set a pattern here this morning or this
[1:06:16] evening. He said, "Then Jesus said unto
[1:06:17] them, verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:06:20] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[1:06:21] Man and drink his blood, you have no
[1:06:23] life in you. Who so eateth my flesh and
[1:06:26] drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life,
[1:06:27] and I will raise him up at the last day.
[1:06:30] For my flesh is meat indeed, and my
[1:06:31] blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my
[1:06:34] flesh and drinkketh my blood dwelleth in
[1:06:36] me, and I in him.
[1:06:38] How do you think that one went over,
[1:06:39] church?
[1:06:41] It says, "As the living father hath sent
[1:06:43] me, and I live by the father, so he that
[1:06:46] eateth me, even he shall live by me.
[1:06:50] This is that bread which came down from
[1:06:52] heaven. Not as your fathers did eat mana
[1:06:55] and are dead. He that eateth of this
[1:06:57] bread shall live forever." He said these
[1:07:00] things said he in the synagogue. This
[1:07:02] was in church. This is in public. This
[1:07:04] is not to the disciples church. This is
[1:07:06] wide open for everyone to hear. He's
[1:07:08] having a set of special meetings and
[1:07:09] this is what he preaches on.
[1:07:12] He says this things he said in the
[1:07:13] synagogue as he taught in Compernum.
[1:07:16] Amen church. He's preaching what sounds
[1:07:18] like a cannibal cult.
[1:07:21] A cannibal cult. Can you imagine how
[1:07:24] that went over? Like a lead balloon is
[1:07:27] what we would say. It ain't going to
[1:07:29] float.
[1:07:32] Watch what it says. Many there of his
[1:07:34] disciples when they had heard it said,
[1:07:36] "This is a hard saying. Who can hear
[1:07:39] it?" That word hard means harsh. It's
[1:07:42] severe, abrasive. In other words, it's
[1:07:44] like trying to swallow sand.
[1:07:47] I don't know if you've ever swallowed
[1:07:49] sand. I know many of our young people
[1:07:50] have as very young children. Sand
[1:07:52] doesn't go down easily. It sticks in
[1:07:55] your throat.
[1:07:56] It doesn't go down because it's dry and
[1:07:59] it clings, makes you cough, it makes
[1:08:01] your your your throat raspy. Nobody
[1:08:04] wants to eat sand of their own valition.
[1:08:08] Not once they know what it means. They
[1:08:10] said, "This is like swallowing sand."
[1:08:13] It says, "When Jesus knew in himself
[1:08:15] that his disciples murmured at it, he
[1:08:16] said unto them, does this offend you?
[1:08:20] What and if you shall see the son of man
[1:08:22] descend up where he was before. It is
[1:08:26] the spirit that quickenth. The flesh
[1:08:28] profiteth nothing. He said the words
[1:08:31] that I speak unto you, they are spirit
[1:08:33] and they are life. He did not say the
[1:08:35] miracles. He did not say the signs and
[1:08:36] wonders. He says my words are spirit and
[1:08:40] life. And there are some of you that
[1:08:42] believe not. He says for Jesus knew from
[1:08:45] the beginning who they were that believe
[1:08:48] not. From the beginning, he knew it,
[1:08:50] church. And yet he called them my
[1:08:52] disciples. Yet he gave them a ministry
[1:08:55] of healing, of signs and wonders,
[1:08:57] casting out devils, raising the dead,
[1:08:59] even preaching the the the the gospel of
[1:09:01] repentance.
[1:09:03] He says, "And I know I knew who believe
[1:09:07] not and who should betray him." He knew
[1:09:10] the one who should betray him and he
[1:09:11] knew all of them that didn't believe.
[1:09:13] But he didn't turn them away, did he?
[1:09:15] church. God doesn't have to turn us
[1:09:17] away. We'll turn away of our own accord
[1:09:19] if we're not his. That's what he's
[1:09:21] saying. He's saying, "I didn't turn you
[1:09:23] down.
[1:09:24] I let you come in. I let you have a part
[1:09:26] of this ministry."
[1:09:29] But watch this.
[1:09:31] And he said, "Therefore said I unto you
[1:09:33] that no man can come unto me except it
[1:09:36] were given unto him of the Father."
[1:09:38] Church, I don't like to see people
[1:09:39] reject the word. None of us do. When we
[1:09:42] give a witness, when we give a
[1:09:44] testimony, when we share what we believe
[1:09:45] and somebody turns it down, none of us
[1:09:47] like it. But the simple fact is not
[1:09:48] everyone's called to it. It's the
[1:09:50] unfortunate truth. Amen. Not everyone
[1:09:53] has a name that was written in the
[1:09:55] lamb's book of life. He says from that
[1:09:57] time many of his disciples, church, you
[1:10:00] notice what it says. It didn't say they
[1:10:02] left him. Says they went back. They went
[1:10:06] back to what they had left. They went
[1:10:09] back to dead religion. They went back to
[1:10:11] powerless churches. They went back to
[1:10:14] traditions of men. Scripture says, "As a
[1:10:17] dog to its vomit." That's what they did.
[1:10:20] They went back to the thing that they
[1:10:22] had already said, "It doesn't hold what
[1:10:24] we're looking for." What a shame. Why,
[1:10:28] church? What pushed them away? Not the
[1:10:30] signs and wonders, not the loaves and
[1:10:32] the fishes, not the raising the dead.
[1:10:36] His words, his doctrine. They couldn't
[1:10:38] handle his doctrine. Amen. He's
[1:10:40] preaching eternal life here and they
[1:10:42] couldn't take it. Says from that time
[1:10:45] many of his disciples went back back and
[1:10:47] walked no more with him. Then said Jesus
[1:10:49] unto the twel will ye also go away. Then
[1:10:53] Simon Peter answered unto him, Lord, to
[1:10:55] whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of
[1:10:59] eternal life. Church, Peter had no clue
[1:11:01] what Jesus was talking about here. No
[1:11:03] clue whatsoever.
[1:11:05] But he said, I'm sticking with you
[1:11:07] because you're the one that has the
[1:11:08] words of eternal life. He says, "And we
[1:11:10] believe and are sure that thou art the
[1:11:13] Christ, the son of the living God." Now,
[1:11:16] I'm setting a pattern here. And the
[1:11:17] pattern is that Jesus in his son of man
[1:11:19] ministry, he comes, he declares a time,
[1:11:22] he declares a season. Remember his first
[1:11:24] sermon. What does he preach out of?
[1:11:26] Isaiah 61. The spirit of the Lord is
[1:11:28] upon me and has anointed me to preach
[1:11:30] the glad tidings and to set the captives
[1:11:33] free and and these all of these
[1:11:34] different things. And what did he do,
[1:11:36] church? He preached it and then he
[1:11:37] demonstrated it, didn't he? He went out
[1:11:40] and he healed the sick. He set the
[1:11:42] captives free. He raised the dead. He
[1:11:45] did everything that Isaiah 61 said he
[1:11:47] was going to do. Why was it to prove
[1:11:49] that he was the real deal? But after a
[1:11:52] while, what did he do? He moved into his
[1:11:55] other scriptural purposes. He had to
[1:11:58] prepare them for the Holy Ghost. He had
[1:12:00] to prepare them for the corner that was
[1:12:02] coming up. He had to prepare them for
[1:12:03] the day of Pentecost. He had to prepare
[1:12:05] them for Jubilee. He had to break them
[1:12:07] free from the shackles of what men had
[1:12:09] done to them through hundreds and
[1:12:10] hundreds of years of teaching the law
[1:12:13] and the prophets incorrectly. Amen.
[1:12:15] Church, look at what he preached. Now,
[1:12:17] put your spiritual thinking caps on.
[1:12:18] What did he preach? He preached on the
[1:12:20] future home. He preached on oneness and
[1:12:22] godhead. Amen. He preached on holiness.
[1:12:26] He preached on the resurrection. He
[1:12:27] preached on the token.
[1:12:30] Amen. Are you hearing what I'm saying
[1:12:32] tonight? He came and he preached all
[1:12:35] these things they had no clue about. And
[1:12:37] while he was preaching it, they had no
[1:12:39] idea. But what they did find out later
[1:12:41] was they were a part of it. He's
[1:12:43] preaching it and they don't have a clue.
[1:12:44] Even his disciples don't have a clue.
[1:12:46] And it would say later on they
[1:12:47] remembered. Oh, that's right. That's
[1:12:49] what he said. Now I get it. Remember on
[1:12:52] the way to Emmas, he's telling them all
[1:12:54] these things that were going to happen,
[1:12:55] showing in the scriptures what had to
[1:12:56] happen. They're like, oh wow.
[1:12:59] It's amazing. Amen.
[1:13:03] And when he started to preach those
[1:13:04] things, strange fire, doctrine they
[1:13:07] never heard, that's when they walked
[1:13:08] away. By the end of it all, church,
[1:13:10] Jesus had 120 followers. Thousands upon
[1:13:13] thousands ate the fishes and loaves.
[1:13:16] Thousands upon thousands were healed.
[1:13:18] You go read through the the the four
[1:13:20] gospels and you'll find places where
[1:13:22] crowds came to Jesus and the scripture
[1:13:24] says he healed them. Everyone.
[1:13:28] Everyone. Nobody went away. Not healed.
[1:13:31] Nobody went away not delivered.
[1:13:34] Nobody went away unfed. Church.
[1:13:37] But when he started preaching the depths
[1:13:38] of the word, that's when they started
[1:13:41] walking away.
[1:13:43] Those that claimed they believed him,
[1:13:44] those that claimed that they knew who he
[1:13:46] was, they walked away when he started
[1:13:47] preaching strange things. Let me remind
[1:13:49] you what Paul said of his own ministry.
[1:13:51] Remember what happened. He's standing
[1:13:52] before Felix
[1:13:55] and he says this. He says, "But this I
[1:13:57] confess unto thee, that after the way
[1:13:58] which who calls car heresy, church?
[1:14:01] After the way which they call heresy,
[1:14:04] who the people that laid charges against
[1:14:06] them, the ones that brought them before
[1:14:08] the magistrate and these different
[1:14:09] things, the way that they call heresy,
[1:14:12] so worship I, the God of my fathers,
[1:14:14] believing all things which are written
[1:14:16] in the law and in the prophets." See,
[1:14:18] he's drawing a distinction. He says,
[1:14:20] "They believe in the law and the
[1:14:22] prophets, and I believe in the law and
[1:14:23] the prophets, but my way is not their
[1:14:26] way. What I believe is called heresy by
[1:14:28] them. We're both preaching out of the
[1:14:31] same law and the prophets. We're both
[1:14:32] preaching out of the Old Testament." He
[1:14:34] says, "But my way is called heresy by
[1:14:37] everybody else."
[1:14:40] That word heresy means sect. It means a
[1:14:43] body of people following beliefs of
[1:14:45] their own choosing. He says, "That's
[1:14:47] what they call us. They call us a sect."
[1:14:49] church. What would they call his his
[1:14:51] beliefs today? A cult. That's the simple
[1:14:54] truth. I don't like to say that, but
[1:14:56] today people call us a cult because we
[1:14:58] believe things that they call heretical
[1:15:01] heresy. Things that we've made up.
[1:15:05] And the the sad fact is it's completely
[1:15:08] opposite. They've made everything up.
[1:15:11] And there's a small body of truth, small
[1:15:13] body of believers that will hold to that
[1:15:15] truth. And they're the ones that are
[1:15:16] called the heretics. Amen.
[1:15:21] Paul would have been the weird
[1:15:22] Christians today.
[1:15:25] Him and his group, the weird ones. Amen.
[1:15:28] I'm not trying to make us into that. But
[1:15:29] the simple fact is when Jesus Christ
[1:15:32] came and preached, they rejected it.
[1:15:34] When the apostles came and preached,
[1:15:35] most of them rejected it. When Paul came
[1:15:37] and preached, they almost exclusively
[1:15:39] rejected it. And then he went to the
[1:15:41] Gentiles, and yes, some of them took it,
[1:15:43] but many rejected it. The truth is more
[1:15:46] often rejected than accepted. Amen.
[1:15:50] What's the problem? Jesus said, "The
[1:15:52] problem is you don't have the word
[1:15:53] abiding in you to start. You've got
[1:15:56] something else." Amen. That's the simple
[1:15:57] truth. Jesus said, "My sheep know my
[1:16:00] voice and they follow me." That's it.
[1:16:04] Amen. That's the identifier. I'm not
[1:16:06] here to judge people.
[1:16:08] People turn us down. That's okay. That's
[1:16:10] between them and God. But at some point,
[1:16:13] the line is going to be drawn. The door
[1:16:15] is going to be closed and let him that
[1:16:16] filthy be filthy still and let him that
[1:16:18] holy be holy be holy still. There's
[1:16:21] going to come a time where God says
[1:16:22] enough is enough. I don't put the
[1:16:24] timeline down. I don't close the door.
[1:16:25] He does it. I keep preaching the doors
[1:16:27] open. I'll keep preaching till I'm out
[1:16:29] of here. The door is open. Amen. But I
[1:16:32] spent half a service now setting us up
[1:16:35] on this thought of the restoration
[1:16:36] message on this this idea of the son of
[1:16:38] man ministry coming back. And so if
[1:16:40] Christ was in the son of man ministry
[1:16:42] there, which he was, then when he comes
[1:16:44] back, we can expect the pattern to
[1:16:46] repeat all over again. Do you believe
[1:16:48] that? Amen. That's the way the Bible
[1:16:50] works. The way it is is the way it keeps
[1:16:52] happening over and over and over again.
[1:16:53] There's nothing new under the sun. Amen.
[1:16:56] If the son of man came the first time
[1:16:57] and was rejected, what's going to happen
[1:16:59] the second time, church?
[1:17:01] A worldwide revival is going to go and
[1:17:03] sweep up everybody. No, he's going to be
[1:17:05] rejected all over again. Amen.
[1:17:08] It would be so bad. The scripture says
[1:17:11] that when the son of man comes, will he
[1:17:13] find faith on the earth? Remember what
[1:17:16] Elijah said? He says, "I alone am left.
[1:17:19] There's nobody believes you anymore,
[1:17:21] Lord." And and God said, "Listen, I've
[1:17:23] got 7,000 that have not bowed the knee
[1:17:25] to Baal." But they're spread out
[1:17:27] everywhere, Elijah. That's why you don't
[1:17:29] know. They're all over the place. It's
[1:17:31] not the massive church. It's not a big
[1:17:34] denomination. And it's not a big group
[1:17:35] of people, but it's a little light here,
[1:17:37] and it's a little light there, and it's
[1:17:38] a person here, and it's a person there,
[1:17:40] and they're all distributed. And people
[1:17:41] think there's none. But there is. And
[1:17:44] it's a body of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:46] that's believing this word. Amen. It'd
[1:17:49] be so scarce, so rare to find a believer
[1:17:51] in this age that the Bible says, "Will
[1:17:53] he find them?" He will find them. But I
[1:17:56] want you to realize something. If you're
[1:17:57] here tonight and you truly believe this
[1:17:59] end time message, you're one in a
[1:18:01] million. You are you're you're rarer
[1:18:04] than hen's teeth
[1:18:06] because most people think they're
[1:18:08] believing the truth and they're in error
[1:18:10] just as they were when the first son of
[1:18:12] man came. Amen.
[1:18:14] We've read multiple times how that
[1:18:16] messenger in the final age would come
[1:18:18] and he would find a religious people
[1:18:20] just as Christ did 2,000 years ago.
[1:18:22] They'd be self assured in their
[1:18:23] religion. They'd be self-righteous.
[1:18:25] They'd be convinced of their own
[1:18:26] correctness and they'd be unaccepting of
[1:18:28] anything else. That's how Christ that's
[1:18:30] what Christ came to. Amen. And so we
[1:18:32] would recognize that to happen at the
[1:18:34] same time. The people will be blind to
[1:18:36] their own condition yet they would claim
[1:18:38] to be Christians. And Paul would say it
[1:18:39] this way and again I preached on this so
[1:18:42] I'm not going to belver the point
[1:18:43] tonight. He says this know also that in
[1:18:46] the last days when last days what are we
[1:18:50] in church? What time are we in now? Last
[1:18:52] days. Okay. So this is a scripture for
[1:18:54] us only for us in the last days.
[1:18:59] Perilous time shall come. That word
[1:19:01] perilous, it means fierce, hard to bear,
[1:19:04] dangerous times. This word perilous is
[1:19:06] only used twice in the entire Bible. You
[1:19:08] know when the other one is? It's the
[1:19:10] description of the man of the
[1:19:12] gatherines.
[1:19:14] Remember the one that had a legion of
[1:19:16] demons inside of him? So the description
[1:19:19] of the perilous times is the description
[1:19:21] of the man of the gatherines
[1:19:23] unable to be controlled by anyone
[1:19:28] completely overtaken by demonic power
[1:19:32] out of his mind.
[1:19:36] Remember because when Jesus healed him
[1:19:37] it says they found him clothed and in
[1:19:40] his sound mind.
[1:19:43] That's what we're going to be dealing
[1:19:44] with in the last days. Okay?
[1:19:47] demonpossessed
[1:19:49] people out of their minds. Here's their
[1:19:51] description. Now watch the danger.
[1:19:55] For men shall be lovers of their own
[1:19:58] selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
[1:20:02] blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
[1:20:05] unthankful, unholy,
[1:20:08] without natural affection, truce
[1:20:10] breakers, false accusers, incontinent.
[1:20:13] It means lacking self-control, fierce.
[1:20:16] That word fierce means savage. Aren't we
[1:20:18] seeing that today? Look at what just
[1:20:20] happened with Charlie Kirk getting shot.
[1:20:22] You talk about savage.
[1:20:25] Not only did somebody kill him, but
[1:20:26] people went savage on the internet.
[1:20:30] People are crazy, church. They are
[1:20:32] demonpossessed.
[1:20:34] And not only the left,
[1:20:37] both sides. Absolutely demonpossessed.
[1:20:42] Striving for power.
[1:20:46] savage, fierce, despisers of those that
[1:20:48] are good. That's absolutely the truth.
[1:20:51] When a man can get killed in front of
[1:20:53] his wife and children, and people
[1:20:54] celebrate,
[1:20:56] that's despisers of those that are good.
[1:20:59] Traitors, heady, that means reckless and
[1:21:02] thoughtless, high-minded, puffed up,
[1:21:04] self-conceited, lovers of pleasure more
[1:21:08] than lovers of God. Now, I want you to
[1:21:10] catch that phrase, lovers of pleasure
[1:21:12] more than lovers of God. Does it say
[1:21:14] they don't love God?
[1:21:19] But it says they love pleasure more. In
[1:21:22] other words, church, he's just one of
[1:21:24] many gods they have in their life. And
[1:21:27] he's not first. He's at he's second at
[1:21:30] best. And chances are he's more much
[1:21:33] further down the line.
[1:21:35] They will profess a love of God, but
[1:21:39] they love pleasure more than they love
[1:21:40] him.
[1:21:42] It says, "Having a form,
[1:21:46] having an appearance, having an outward
[1:21:49] shell of godliness, but denying the
[1:21:52] power thereof from such turn away." So
[1:21:57] he is not speaking of worldly people,
[1:21:59] church. He is speaking of people that
[1:22:02] profess to be Christians. And this is
[1:22:05] the description of them.
[1:22:07] He says they'll have a form of godliness
[1:22:10] but deny the par from such turn away.
[1:22:12] Don't have anything to do with them.
[1:22:13] Don't associate yourself with them.
[1:22:17] He says for of this sort are they which
[1:22:19] creep into houses and lead captive silly
[1:22:23] women laden with sins led away with
[1:22:25] divers lust. Now that word that that
[1:22:27] phrase silly women means weak women. Now
[1:22:30] sisters, we're not preaching against
[1:22:31] you. Remember what it means in the
[1:22:33] scriptures. A woman is a church. So weak
[1:22:37] churches,
[1:22:40] church, what you know what what the
[1:22:41] scripture says strength is to a man.
[1:22:44] Go look in the Proverbs and Psalms.
[1:22:47] What's strength to a man? Wisdom.
[1:22:51] So a silly woman is a weak woman is a
[1:22:55] woman without wisdom, without
[1:22:57] understanding.
[1:22:59] And these kinds of men, these kinds of
[1:23:02] people will go in and they'll take
[1:23:04] control of bodies of professing
[1:23:07] Christians.
[1:23:08] It says, "And they'll be led away with
[1:23:11] divers's lust." And what do you find?
[1:23:13] Everyone goes to a church that preaches
[1:23:16] what they want to hear.
[1:23:18] Right?
[1:23:20] Well, you're never going to get changed
[1:23:21] if you go around listening for what you
[1:23:23] want to hear. You're going to stay the
[1:23:24] way you are. You're never going to be
[1:23:26] transformed by the gospel that you're
[1:23:27] hearing if it's exactly what you want to
[1:23:29] hear.
[1:23:30] He says, "Ever learning
[1:23:33] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:23:36] of the truth." I want to remind us Paul
[1:23:40] is preaching this scripture to believers
[1:23:43] and saying, "Look out.
[1:23:45] Look out." Because there are people that
[1:23:47] going to say that are going to say
[1:23:49] they're just like you and they're not
[1:23:51] just like you. And they're going to have
[1:23:54] all of these things in their lives.
[1:23:57] Amen. They're comparable to the demoniac
[1:23:59] of Gera, a legion of of demons in his
[1:24:02] body. Amen. They're not of a sound mind.
[1:24:05] Church, how can you just look at this
[1:24:07] list here? Lovers of their own selves,
[1:24:09] covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:24:11] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[1:24:13] unholy, no natural affection, truce
[1:24:15] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:24:17] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:24:18] good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
[1:24:20] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:24:22] God. Where's the fruit of the spirit?
[1:24:24] Where's the holiness? Where's the life
[1:24:27] transformed? Where's the new birth? It's
[1:24:30] not there, is it? Paul says they have a
[1:24:33] form of godliness, but they deny the
[1:24:35] power of godliness. What does that mean,
[1:24:38] church? It means that they will preach
[1:24:40] the word, but they will deny its power
[1:24:44] and effect. Deny that it has the same
[1:24:47] power and effect. Amen. They'll read
[1:24:50] something, and I've heard this. I've
[1:24:53] heard it with my own two ears, seeing
[1:24:54] with my own two eyes. They'll read a
[1:24:56] portion of scripture and then they will
[1:24:58] say one of three things. One, it doesn't
[1:25:02] mean what it says.
[1:25:05] Flat out. It doesn't mean what it says.
[1:25:10] Well, what does it mean then? It means
[1:25:12] whatever they want it to mean. The
[1:25:14] second thing they'll say that doesn't
[1:25:16] apply today because it's a different
[1:25:18] world and it's a different society. It's
[1:25:20] a different time.
[1:25:23] And then the third thing is it just
[1:25:26] doesn't happen that way today.
[1:25:29] So, it either doesn't mean what it says,
[1:25:31] it doesn't apply today because we're
[1:25:33] different, or it doesn't have the power
[1:25:35] that it had back then. Amen. They refuse
[1:25:38] to accept the full effect of the word.
[1:25:40] Why? Because they don't have the full
[1:25:42] effect of the word. They don't have a
[1:25:44] revelation of the word. It's like Jesus
[1:25:46] said, they can't truly hear the word.
[1:25:47] They can't accept it because it's not in
[1:25:49] them. I'm not going to say the man's
[1:25:51] name because you know what?
[1:25:55] I you know I heard brother Ron Spencer
[1:25:56] say something about Charlie Kirk.
[1:25:59] He didn't have the message.
[1:26:02] He didn't have the Holy Ghost. He said,
[1:26:04] "But I believe God's got a place for him
[1:26:06] somewhere." Cuz he stood firmly
[1:26:10] publicly for what he believed.
[1:26:12] And I would like to believe that's true.
[1:26:14] That God has a place in the end for him
[1:26:17] for standing on the truth that he had.
[1:26:19] Amen. So, I don't want to name this man,
[1:26:22] but he's a very well-known Christian
[1:26:24] preacher and teacher, and he's sitting
[1:26:27] up on with a panel of three three men.
[1:26:29] One of the other ones is RC Spruel,
[1:26:31] which is also a well-known Bible teacher
[1:26:33] today. And somebody asked him the
[1:26:35] question. They said, "Is God still
[1:26:37] sending prophets today?" And you know
[1:26:39] what he said? No. He said, "I do not
[1:26:44] believe God is giving direct revelation
[1:26:46] today." That's a direct quote of him. I
[1:26:49] don't believe God is giving direct
[1:26:50] revelation today. He said divine truth
[1:26:53] has already been given. Therefore, God
[1:26:56] is not giving divine revelation today.
[1:26:59] But church, we just read in Daniel a
[1:27:01] service or two ago where Daniel's given
[1:27:05] divine truth and doesn't understand it.
[1:27:08] And God says, "Seal up the book,
[1:27:10] Daniel." But God, what is this going to
[1:27:13] happen? What does it mean? Not for you,
[1:27:14] Daniel. seal it up until the end of the
[1:27:17] end of time. Then John goes and John
[1:27:20] sees all things. John understands all
[1:27:22] things and he writes it in symbolic
[1:27:25] form, not in revealed form. Then when
[1:27:27] those thunders sounded, he goes to write
[1:27:29] it and God says, "No, John, don't write
[1:27:32] it. Seal it up till the end time."
[1:27:36] So there's there's there's divine truth
[1:27:38] that's been given, but not all divine
[1:27:41] truth has been revealed.
[1:27:44] And how does God reveal something? I
[1:27:47] will do nothing except I reveal it unto
[1:27:49] my servants, the prophets.
[1:27:52] And so, and we'll get into this as we
[1:27:54] go. It's not that God is giving new
[1:27:57] truth. It's that God is revealing the
[1:28:00] truth that's already there.
[1:28:02] Look at what Paul preached.
[1:28:05] Paul had a revelation of the
[1:28:07] resurrection and the rapture. Church,
[1:28:10] Paul preached the rapture. Did Paul get
[1:28:13] the rapture? Nope.
[1:28:16] So, God's got to reveal the rapture to
[1:28:18] somebody. And the Holy Spirit's got to
[1:28:21] do that. That's what this man said. He
[1:28:23] says, "Well, the Holy Spirit is here to
[1:28:24] reveal the truth. He's here working in
[1:28:27] our hearts." But what does the Spirit
[1:28:28] say to the churches? He says it through
[1:28:31] a seventh church age messenger. That's
[1:28:34] what the Bible says. So, if you're going
[1:28:35] to believe what's written in the Bible,
[1:28:37] you'll believe that he sends prophets.
[1:28:39] Ephesians 4 says he sent prophets. I was
[1:28:42] listening to Donnie Reagan the other
[1:28:43] day. He says, "You know what? Everything
[1:28:46] is pluralized in the five-fold
[1:28:47] ministry." So that it's not just one of
[1:28:49] anything.
[1:28:51] Prophets, apostles, pastors,
[1:28:53] evangelists, and teachers. That means
[1:28:55] there's at least 10 of them in the world
[1:28:58] because two is the minimum you can have
[1:29:00] for plurality. There's got to be at
[1:29:01] least 10 God- called men
[1:29:04] to fulfill a scripture. So you can't
[1:29:07] just say he only uses a prophet. He uses
[1:29:09] a prophet to bring that word. He uses
[1:29:11] preachers, evangelists, teachers,
[1:29:13] pastors to spread that word. Amen. But
[1:29:16] he uses a prophet to open it up to us.
[1:29:18] Amen. God already gave his word, but he
[1:29:20] needs somebody to reveal it. He needs to
[1:29:23] bring understanding to those that read
[1:29:25] the book. Remember when Philip was
[1:29:27] called out into the desert and he saw
[1:29:29] the unic and the man was reading Isaiah,
[1:29:30] he says, "Do you understand what you're
[1:29:32] reading?"
[1:29:33] He says, "How can I except a man show
[1:29:35] me?" And Philip got in there. He
[1:29:37] revealed the scriptures to him. He
[1:29:38] opened up to him. The guy said, "Hey,
[1:29:40] here's water. Let's get me baptized."
[1:29:42] And Philip did. And then he was caught
[1:29:43] away in the spirit, back to where he
[1:29:44] needed to be.
[1:29:46] What is this man's problem? Well-known
[1:29:49] man.
[1:29:51] He lacks a revelation.
[1:29:53] He's been bound by what everyone else
[1:29:55] has been teaching and he's accepted it
[1:29:58] as the truth. Now, he's a cessationist.
[1:30:00] He doesn't believe that. He believes
[1:30:02] that the day of the apostles, the day of
[1:30:03] the power of the Holy Ghost, the day of
[1:30:04] the of the spirit working in the
[1:30:06] churches. He doesn't believe in gifts.
[1:30:08] He doesn't believe in any of those
[1:30:09] things, church. Why? Cuz he doesn't have
[1:30:11] it.
[1:30:12] And because he doesn't have it, he says
[1:30:14] it must not be.
[1:30:16] That's not what God called us to do.
[1:30:18] Abraham didn't have Isaac for 24 for 25
[1:30:22] years, but he still believed it.
[1:30:25] God's opening up his word to us. That's
[1:30:27] what the spirit's doing is quickening
[1:30:28] his word so we'll believe for what's
[1:30:30] coming, for what God has already
[1:30:31] ordained in our life. It meant he
[1:30:33] doesn't have what the word says he ought
[1:30:34] to have. And therefore he says that was
[1:30:36] for another day. It's for the past. It's
[1:30:38] not for today. He's claiming to believe
[1:30:41] what Paul believed. He preaches what
[1:30:42] Paul preaches. And yet he refuses to
[1:30:45] believe in the power that Paul had. Why?
[1:30:50] Because he doesn't have it. He's never
[1:30:53] seen it. He's never experienced it. And
[1:30:55] he's been taught it's not there. And
[1:30:57] because that's what he received, that's
[1:30:59] what he got. You I was reading you know
[1:31:02] you say I I believe in God but then you
[1:31:05] say I don't believe he's the same as he
[1:31:06] always was. That doesn't make sense.
[1:31:09] Scripture says I am the go I am I am the
[1:31:11] Lord thy God. I change not. There's no
[1:31:13] variableness neither shadow of turning.
[1:31:16] And yet people say well I believe in him
[1:31:17] but I don't believe he does the same
[1:31:18] things today. Well that's your problem
[1:31:20] not his. I was reading in devotions this
[1:31:22] morning in first Corinthians where Paul
[1:31:25] said the kingdom of God is not in word
[1:31:26] but in power. And what do we have today?
[1:31:28] We have a bunch of people preaching but
[1:31:31] no power, no evidence, no confirmation,
[1:31:36] nothing, just theology. And that's what
[1:31:40] Jesus came to. A bunch of people
[1:31:43] preaching without authority.
[1:31:46] G Paul said, "When I came, I didn't come
[1:31:48] to you with these the the these words of
[1:31:50] men, these these smooth words." He says,
[1:31:52] "I came in power and demonstration of
[1:31:54] the Holy Spirit. That's how I came.
[1:31:56] That's why you accepted me cuz you saw
[1:31:58] that I had what I was talking about.
[1:32:01] Let's come back to the scriptures as we
[1:32:02] start to wrap this up tonight.
[1:32:04] Revelation chapter 3. We've read it
[1:32:05] multiple times. So I'm again I'm not
[1:32:07] going to drag too much. It says unto the
[1:32:09] angel of the church of the leadyans
[1:32:10] write under the messenger the seventh
[1:32:12] church age messenger write this. These
[1:32:14] things sayeth the amen the faithful and
[1:32:16] true witness the beginning of the
[1:32:18] creation of God. So here's his message
[1:32:21] to the leadyian church. I know thy
[1:32:23] works, that thou art neither cold nor
[1:32:25] hot. I would thou art cold or hot. So
[1:32:28] then, because thou art lukewarm and
[1:32:29] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:32:31] out of my mouth. Why does he do it? He
[1:32:35] says, "Because thou sayest." In other
[1:32:38] words, this is your testimony. This is
[1:32:40] your selfassessment. You ever do one of
[1:32:43] those self- assessment tests?
[1:32:45] You know what 99% of us do? We write
[1:32:48] what we want what we think we want to
[1:32:50] be. We write what we want to be rather
[1:32:51] than what we are. I'm seeing some
[1:32:54] smiles.
[1:32:56] Except sister Justine.
[1:33:00] You write a self assessment test. You
[1:33:02] want to give your you want to put your
[1:33:04] best foot forward. And so what you
[1:33:05] choose is what you wish you were rather
[1:33:07] than what you are. And excuse the
[1:33:09] results.
[1:33:12] Here's what they said.
[1:33:15] I am rich, increased with goods, and
[1:33:18] have need of nothing.
[1:33:20] Wow,
[1:33:23] what a wonderful testimony if it was
[1:33:24] true.
[1:33:27] This is not just speaking naturally.
[1:33:28] It's speaking spiritually. You look at
[1:33:30] the Pentecostal church, they say, "We've
[1:33:32] got it all." And I've said before, I've
[1:33:34] watched some of their services. You talk
[1:33:36] about worship, you talk about music, you
[1:33:38] talk about excellence.
[1:33:42] We couldn't even get in the door with
[1:33:43] our worship. Amazing,
[1:33:49] phenomenal musicians,
[1:33:52] worldclass singers,
[1:33:55] rich increased with goods have need of
[1:33:56] nothing. Every service is a great
[1:33:58] service.
[1:34:00] We're shouting, we're dancing, we're
[1:34:01] speaking in tongues. We go home sweaty
[1:34:04] and tired out every time.
[1:34:08] Camp meeting all the time. That's what
[1:34:11] some people want.
[1:34:13] That's what some people want.
[1:34:16] Remember what Paul said? Sorry, we
[1:34:18] didn't finish. They say, "I'm rich,
[1:34:20] increase with goods, have need of
[1:34:21] nothing. And knowest not that thou art
[1:34:24] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and
[1:34:28] naked." What did Paul say was coming in
[1:34:30] the last days, church? Perilous times.
[1:34:34] Amen. Now, look at the fulfillment of
[1:34:36] that. The Holy Spirit says this age, you
[1:34:38] say you're rich, you say you have every
[1:34:39] blessing, say you don't need anything,
[1:34:41] and you don't know you're wretched,
[1:34:42] miserable, poor, blind, and naked. What
[1:34:45] is a church? It's a people that profess
[1:34:47] to be one thing and are actually
[1:34:50] another. This is a total fulfillment of
[1:34:52] what Paul said they would be. So, if
[1:34:55] they're not what they say they are,
[1:34:58] they're completely different. They're
[1:35:00] not even close. Notice he doesn't say
[1:35:03] you're half clothed. He says, "You're
[1:35:05] completely naked.
[1:35:08] You're not okay. You're miserable."
[1:35:13] Like they are complet They're
[1:35:14] diametrically opposite. We'd say today
[1:35:16] what they say they are and what they are
[1:35:18] is as far away as east is from west.
[1:35:21] It's not even close.
[1:35:24] You ever go play something with somebody
[1:35:26] the first time and maybe it's, you know,
[1:35:28] basketball or hockey or something and
[1:35:30] and you go out and you play with them
[1:35:32] and and maybe they really talk
[1:35:33] themselves up and you're really
[1:35:35] expecting something and they go out and
[1:35:37] they're not quite it, but they usually
[1:35:38] have a little bit of something. You
[1:35:39] know, this is not this people. They say
[1:35:42] they're Wayne Gretzky
[1:35:45] and when they come out they're skating
[1:35:46] on their ankles. Anybody that plays
[1:35:48] hockey knows what I'm talking about.
[1:35:49] Their feet are like this on the ice and
[1:35:53] they can't stick handle. They don't have
[1:35:55] anything. Nothing of what they profess,
[1:35:58] nothing of their testimony is true.
[1:36:02] But yet they're convinced they are the
[1:36:04] greatest Christians in the world.
[1:36:09] He says, 'I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:36:12] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[1:36:14] be rich and white raignment that thou
[1:36:15] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:36:17] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:36:19] thine eyes with eyes is that thou mayest
[1:36:21] see. We preached on this a couple
[1:36:22] services ago. It's godly character. It's
[1:36:24] the righteousness of Christ. It's it's
[1:36:26] the revelation of the word. He says,
[1:36:28] "Now as many as I love, I rebuke and
[1:36:31] chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and
[1:36:33] repent." And this is the first portion,
[1:36:35] the first purpose of that Leodysian
[1:36:37] church age messenger. Amen. He's got to
[1:36:39] break the people free from their self-
[1:36:41] congratulating Christianity.
[1:36:44] Amen. Inflated, arrogant, delusional.
[1:36:48] He's got to break them. He's got to snap
[1:36:49] them out of that and get them to see
[1:36:51] that Christ is not working in their
[1:36:53] midst. Amen.
[1:36:55] I know I've said I'm only going to use
[1:36:56] scriptures in this little series that
[1:36:58] we're doing right here on why we believe
[1:37:00] in an end time prophet, but
[1:37:03] I want to use a quote. Are you okay if I
[1:37:05] use a quote? We believe it.
[1:37:08] For those online, take it or leave it.
[1:37:11] But I thought this summarized this whole
[1:37:13] thought of how this man will come, how
[1:37:16] this messenger will come, and what he's
[1:37:18] got to deal with. It says this, "The
[1:37:19] last day messenger will appear in God's
[1:37:22] appointed time. It is the end time now
[1:37:24] as all know for Israel is in the
[1:37:26] homeland. Any time now he will come
[1:37:28] according to Malachi. When we see him,
[1:37:31] he will be dedicated to the word. He
[1:37:34] will be indicated. In other words,
[1:37:36] pointed out in the word. Revelation
[1:37:37] 10:7. And God will vindicate his
[1:37:40] ministry. He will preach the truth as
[1:37:43] did Elijah and be ready for the Mount
[1:37:45] Zion showdown. We're going to preach on
[1:37:46] the Mount Zion showdown sometime. I got
[1:37:48] a bunch of notes on it. I can't wait to
[1:37:49] preach on. It's a beautiful thing.
[1:37:51] He says, "Many will misunderstand him."
[1:37:54] Why? Because they have been taught
[1:37:57] scripture in a certain way which they
[1:38:00] consider truth.
[1:38:03] When he comes against that, they will
[1:38:05] not believe. Even some true ministers
[1:38:08] will misunderstand the messenger because
[1:38:10] so much has been called God's truth by
[1:38:14] deceivers.
[1:38:15] What's he saying? He's saying people are
[1:38:17] not consciously rejecting the truth.
[1:38:21] They didn't just go and and and lead
[1:38:24] themselves astray intentionally.
[1:38:27] Somebody that's in a Baptist church
[1:38:28] today is not out there saying, "I want
[1:38:31] to go and determine this and that." No,
[1:38:33] they are raised up in it
[1:38:36] and they just come in believing it.
[1:38:38] And so they've been taught the
[1:38:40] scriptures in a certain way. So the
[1:38:41] Baptists don't believe in the Holy Ghost
[1:38:43] the way we do. You go talk to different
[1:38:46] ones about predestination, they don't
[1:38:47] believe it the way we do. Why? because
[1:38:49] that's how they've been taught and they
[1:38:51] just can't break out of what we would
[1:38:52] call a denominational mold. They can't
[1:38:55] do it. They're raised in it and they're
[1:38:57] just locked into it. They're locked into
[1:38:59] that idea. Amen. I don't believe they're
[1:39:02] doing it uh
[1:39:05] what they're believing. They're
[1:39:06] believing in sincerity,
[1:39:08] but they're wrong. And that's what this
[1:39:10] prophet's job is to do is to snap them
[1:39:12] out of that, to try and shake them
[1:39:13] awake. And how's he going to do it?
[1:39:15] We'll talk about that in a bit. But we
[1:39:17] know that in this church age, Christ is
[1:39:19] outside of this group and he's trying to
[1:39:21] fellowship now with individuals. He's
[1:39:22] calling people. He's not calling a a a
[1:39:25] church, a a specific group, you know,
[1:39:27] he's not coming to the Baptists or the
[1:39:29] Pentecostals or this. He's calling to
[1:39:31] get one here and one there and one here
[1:39:32] and one there. He's always done it that
[1:39:33] way, hasn't he? He's trying to get them
[1:39:35] into fellowship with him. He's trying to
[1:39:37] get them to open up to him. And so, this
[1:39:40] messenger has to call those people out
[1:39:43] when that great is judged.
[1:39:44] Remember, it's the the Catholic Church
[1:39:46] and every denomination that came out
[1:39:48] from her and held on to any of her
[1:39:50] doctrines. Amen. It's the whole
[1:39:52] ecumenical church movement. There's a
[1:39:54] message given just before that that
[1:39:56] happens. And we heard a prophet say it
[1:39:58] in our day. He says, "And I heard
[1:40:00] another voice from heaven, saying, Come
[1:40:01] out of her, my people, that ye be not
[1:40:04] partakers of her sins, of her unbelief,
[1:40:07] and that you receive not of her plagues,
[1:40:10] for her sins have reached unto heaven,
[1:40:12] and God has remembered her iniquities."
[1:40:14] So, he says there's got to come a voice
[1:40:15] that says, "Come out of her. Get out."
[1:40:20] That's what God's been doing through
[1:40:21] prophets for for thousands of years.
[1:40:23] He's saying, "Get out and get in.
[1:40:26] Get out and get into the word. Get into
[1:40:29] the ark. Get into salvation. Get into
[1:40:31] God's provided place of worship.
[1:40:34] And how did he do it? Through a seventh
[1:40:37] church age messenger, a prophet. And he
[1:40:39] did it as Christ did. The son of man
[1:40:41] ministry came back. And what did he do?
[1:40:43] He said, "It's Jesus Christ the same
[1:40:45] yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:40:48] And he started showing the signs and the
[1:40:50] wonders of the Messiah himself.
[1:40:54] discernment of the thoughts and intents
[1:40:55] of the heart, raising the dead, healing
[1:40:58] the sick, casting out demons, even
[1:41:01] judgment for those that went against
[1:41:03] him. He did church. Everything that
[1:41:05] Jesus Christ did, William Brham did in
[1:41:09] his ministry
[1:41:11] and more and by that I mean greater
[1:41:14] volume because he had decades of
[1:41:17] ministry. Remember I talked about it
[1:41:19] last service in South Africa alone seven
[1:41:23] dump truck loads of crutches and
[1:41:26] wheelchairs from one set of meetings
[1:41:29] went around the world seven times from
[1:41:32] 1933 to 1965
[1:41:35] over 30 years of preaching Jesus had
[1:41:37] three and a half and he was limited by
[1:41:39] how far he could walk. We had a man that
[1:41:42] had an airplane. We had a man that had a
[1:41:43] car. A man that had boats. He could go
[1:41:46] anywhere just about any time and be
[1:41:47] there. Went around the world over and
[1:41:49] over and over again. And what was he
[1:41:52] doing? Telling the people, "Jubilee time
[1:41:54] is here." And he did it through signs
[1:41:56] and wonders. Amen. But that's not going
[1:41:59] to cause a separation. He's got to say,
[1:42:01] "Get out of her, my people." The first
[1:42:03] thing he does is he catches their
[1:42:04] attention. That's what Jesus did. He
[1:42:07] caught their attention. But what causes
[1:42:09] a separation? See, now some people, most
[1:42:12] churches, if you went to Brother
[1:42:13] Brandham's and you got prayed for and
[1:42:15] you got healed, they're not going to
[1:42:16] kick you out of their church for that.
[1:42:17] They might say, "We don't preach it or
[1:42:19] we don't believe it." But if you got the
[1:42:21] evidence, they're not going to say
[1:42:22] anything about it.
[1:42:24] Remember what happened in Jesus day was
[1:42:25] that man got healed and they said,
[1:42:27] "Hey," they went to the to the mother
[1:42:29] and father and they said, "Is this your
[1:42:30] son? Did he get healed?" They said, "Ask
[1:42:32] him. He's a man. He's a grown man. He
[1:42:34] can tell you." Because they didn't want
[1:42:34] to get kicked out of their churches.
[1:42:36] Some churches would kick you out for
[1:42:38] believing in divine healing, but most of
[1:42:40] them were okay with it at that time
[1:42:41] because they wanted it. They wanted the
[1:42:43] supernatural in their midst. Amen. But
[1:42:46] what causes separation, church? When you
[1:42:49] disagree with what they're preaching,
[1:42:52] brother Brandham himself, remember his
[1:42:54] his Baptist pastor tried to get him away
[1:42:57] from those visions and those dreams and
[1:42:58] then his doctrine. And in the end, Bill,
[1:43:00] brother Brandham had to turn in his
[1:43:01] card, his Baptist minister's card. He
[1:43:03] says, "I can't be affiliated with you.
[1:43:05] I'll turn it in. You don't have to take
[1:43:06] it from me.
[1:43:08] When you dispute denominational thinking
[1:43:10] by the word of God, that's what causes
[1:43:12] the separation. Scripture says, "Can two
[1:43:14] walk together except they be agreed?"
[1:43:17] And it would take a restoration of
[1:43:18] truth, a revelation of the word to cause
[1:43:21] that separation. And so that that
[1:43:23] prophet has to come and he has to untie
[1:43:25] all those denominational knots. He's got
[1:43:27] to cut through it with the purity of the
[1:43:29] word, the sword of the word.
[1:43:32] I think it was Alexander the Great that
[1:43:35] he went to a place and they had a knot
[1:43:37] there and they said, "Whoever untie
[1:43:38] whoever can untie this knot and it was a
[1:43:40] big knot and it was tied heavy, a big
[1:43:42] huge thing." They said, "Whoever unties
[1:43:43] it will be the king or the emperor." And
[1:43:45] he just took his sword and he just cut
[1:43:46] the whole thing. He didn't untie it. He
[1:43:48] just cut it apart. That's what the
[1:43:50] prophet came. He untied all those knots
[1:43:52] that the denominations had tied up
[1:43:54] through all those years. Amen. He got to
[1:43:56] cut away the bondage of denominational
[1:43:58] thinking and and the doctrines of men
[1:44:00] and the confusion of men and the
[1:44:02] conclusions of men. Amen. And he had to
[1:44:04] do it by preaching the original word in
[1:44:06] its original form because that's the
[1:44:07] only way you can have the original
[1:44:08] faith. You can't have the faith of the
[1:44:11] word unless you preach the word. He's
[1:44:13] got to bring it in its fullness. Amen.
[1:44:15] You know, I was watching brother brother
[1:44:16] Mvin over in in Calgary. He goes to
[1:44:18] brother Barry Johnson's church and he
[1:44:19] was he was preaching on what this this
[1:44:22] seventh church age messenger did and
[1:44:24] about the key doctrines that brother
[1:44:25] Brandham preached that were so different
[1:44:27] from what was widely accepted in that
[1:44:29] day and even today. And I wanted to
[1:44:31] share it. He did a beautiful job of it.
[1:44:32] And so I I took it and I threw it in
[1:44:34] chat GPT. I said turn this into text so
[1:44:36] I can use it for me. And we look at this
[1:44:38] list and these are this is not an
[1:44:40] exhaustive list but it's a it's a pretty
[1:44:42] good list. And these are the things that
[1:44:44] brother Brandon preached that were in
[1:44:46] many ways completely different
[1:44:49] or very different from what the nominal
[1:44:51] Christian world was preaching. Look at
[1:44:52] that first one. Godhead Christ is the
[1:44:54] mystery of God revealed. The first thing
[1:44:56] he hits on false trinity.
[1:45:00] And that's the thing that ties 99% of
[1:45:02] the Christian world together is they all
[1:45:03] believe in a trinity. And he hits it and
[1:45:05] he completely dispels it and he shows us
[1:45:08] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:45:09] He preaches us the Godhead and the
[1:45:11] purity of the word. Amen. church, you
[1:45:13] believe the trinity, you can't even put
[1:45:14] the word together because it falls
[1:45:16] apart. The whole thing's apart. You
[1:45:18] can't even fit into into what the word
[1:45:21] says about you. If you believe in the
[1:45:22] trinity, it doesn't work. Amen. You
[1:45:26] can't see what the indwelling of the
[1:45:27] spirit is. You can't see oneness with
[1:45:28] Christ. If you don't understand the
[1:45:30] oneness of God in Christ, if you don't
[1:45:32] understand the Godhead, you're going to
[1:45:34] struggle. And so when you say the
[1:45:36] trinity is wrong, that right there is
[1:45:38] going to cause a separation from
[1:45:40] virtually every church because you do
[1:45:41] have some that believe oneness. You have
[1:45:43] Pentecostals that will do it. There
[1:45:44] might be a couple more, but the oneness
[1:45:45] they preach wasn't right either. So he
[1:45:48] came and he preached it in a completely
[1:45:50] different way. Why was he doing this
[1:45:51] church? Why would he go down and preach
[1:45:53] all of these different things? You look
[1:45:56] at water baptism, virtually everyone was
[1:45:58] preaching in the name of the Father,
[1:45:59] Son, and the Holy Ghost. He says it's a
[1:46:00] false baptism. Nobody ever baptized in
[1:46:03] that.
[1:46:04] the simplicity of the word church. He
[1:46:06] says, "Read your New Testament." Nobody
[1:46:08] ever baptized in that. But what are they
[1:46:11] baptized in? The name of the Lord Jesus
[1:46:14] Christ.
[1:46:16] He says, "If you're not baptized in the
[1:46:18] right baptism, it's a false baptism. God
[1:46:21] doesn't accept it."
[1:46:24] He go through all of these different
[1:46:26] things. Amen.
[1:46:28] He didn't do it for popularity, that's
[1:46:30] for sure.
[1:46:32] Jesus wasn't trying to be popular. Amen.
[1:46:35] And brother Brandham would go to such
[1:46:36] lengths to preach things that were
[1:46:37] opposite to everyone. And it got to the
[1:46:39] point where men were saying, "Brother
[1:46:40] Brandham, I want to lay hands on you and
[1:46:42] pray over you." Why? To get him to stop
[1:46:46] preaching the word. Everybody wanted him
[1:46:49] to come and do healing campaigns and
[1:46:52] show the signs and show the wonders and
[1:46:53] show the discernment and go through the
[1:46:55] crowd. People that didn't have uh prayer
[1:46:58] cards and just show the the presence of
[1:47:00] the Lord there. But what they didn't
[1:47:01] want was the word.
[1:47:04] Remember what Jesus said? I think it was
[1:47:06] in John. He said, "This is the
[1:47:08] condemnation." He says that light has
[1:47:10] come into the world and men love
[1:47:12] darkness rather than light because their
[1:47:15] deeds were evil.
[1:47:18] Now you see all those men preaching the
[1:47:19] word and it's wrong.
[1:47:22] They did it sincerely, church. There's
[1:47:24] forgiveness for sincerely wrong. But
[1:47:26] what happens when truth comes and it
[1:47:28] reveals your error? That's when we find
[1:47:30] out who's really a believer because the
[1:47:32] believer will go with truth rather than
[1:47:34] the kingdom they built, rather than the
[1:47:36] church they built, rather than the
[1:47:38] reputation they built.
[1:47:40] They'll lay it all aside for truth
[1:47:42] because the word is what matters most.
[1:47:44] But those people, they had to walk away
[1:47:46] from it. But look at all these things
[1:47:48] that that were preached here. He was
[1:47:50] trying, Brother Brandon would say, he
[1:47:51] was tying up the loose ends.
[1:47:53] There's things that were were were were
[1:47:56] there that have been kind of probed at
[1:47:58] all through 2,000 years.
[1:48:03] Let me go back to something.
[1:48:07] This is the condemnation that light came
[1:48:10] and they love darkness rather than it.
[1:48:12] And brother Bram started preaching these
[1:48:14] things and they said, "Brother Bram,
[1:48:15] stop doing it. You're going to lose the
[1:48:16] people. You're going to lose your
[1:48:17] effect. You're going to lose your
[1:48:18] sponsors."
[1:48:20] And in the end, only a few churches had
[1:48:22] their doors open to him. I think the
[1:48:24] full gospel businessmen were with him to
[1:48:25] the end if I'm not mistaken because I
[1:48:27] was just listening to the rapture, which
[1:48:29] is just about two weeks before or sorry,
[1:48:31] uh, leadership and he's preaching at
[1:48:33] church that I believe was sponsored or
[1:48:35] supported by full gospel businessmen.
[1:48:36] So, I think they were that and I think
[1:48:38] brother Jack Co and Shreport. I think
[1:48:40] that's about it for nominal Christian
[1:48:43] churches that would have him. Otherwise,
[1:48:44] they met in auditoriums, they rent
[1:48:46] hotels, they do whatever they could just
[1:48:48] to have a place because the churches
[1:48:49] weren't open to them anymore. They
[1:48:51] rejected him completely. But remember
[1:48:52] what Jesus said. Remember the parable of
[1:48:54] the sewer where they went out and the
[1:48:56] and and the the farmer swed the good
[1:48:59] seed and then an enemy came in and swed
[1:49:01] the the tears the weeds amongst it and
[1:49:03] they said, "Hey, you got tears. You got
[1:49:05] weeds in your wheat field. What do we
[1:49:06] do?" He says, "Let them grow together."
[1:49:08] But at the end he says gather the tears
[1:49:12] for one thing burning.
[1:49:15] Burning. They've got to be gathered
[1:49:17] together. And what gathers them
[1:49:18] together? That ecumenical movement where
[1:49:21] they'll unite under the doctrines that
[1:49:23] they hold in common.
[1:49:26] Primary one will be the trinity. It
[1:49:28] binds them together. Brother Ram says
[1:49:30] when you see that ecumenical move
[1:49:31] happening, look up. Get ready because
[1:49:34] they're gathered for judgment. And then
[1:49:36] what did he say? and gather my wheat
[1:49:38] into the barn. And who gathers that?
[1:49:42] It's a prophetic message, son of man
[1:49:43] ministry that pulls that little tiny
[1:49:45] group into the barn and gets them ready
[1:49:47] for a resurrection and a rapture.
[1:49:50] But brother Brand was here and he was
[1:49:51] tying together all these loose ends. And
[1:49:53] you know, we see people and I was
[1:49:55] amazed. I' I've talked before about
[1:49:57] there's a a man in Dallas, Texas. I ran
[1:49:59] across on YouTube. I was doing some
[1:50:00] research on something and he was
[1:50:02] preaching on the seven seals. had
[1:50:03] preached out of the book of the
[1:50:04] revelation and he was about 80 or 85%
[1:50:06] right. I was amazed. Now maybe he read
[1:50:09] some stuff from brother Bradom but he
[1:50:10] didn't he couldn't have read it all
[1:50:11] because he was off majorly on a few
[1:50:13] things. But just in sheer studying he
[1:50:15] had come so close. You know you look at
[1:50:17] the wonderful Bible scholars and
[1:50:19] ministers and even priests that had
[1:50:21] great revelations of certain aspects of
[1:50:23] scripture. I mean I've got a a Cyrus
[1:50:26] Scoffield Bible up here. His notes are
[1:50:28] fantastic about 92% of the time. And he
[1:50:32] was a trinitarian church, but he had so
[1:50:35] many wonderful insights into scripture.
[1:50:37] Just studied and studied and studied and
[1:50:39] put things together. Beautifully done.
[1:50:41] You look at Charles Spurgeon, the prince
[1:50:43] of preachers. Anybody ever read some of
[1:50:46] his sermon notes and things he gave his
[1:50:47] students? Amazing. Blesses me to no end.
[1:50:53] Blesses me to no end. Look at Clarence
[1:50:55] Larkin. Clarence Larkin purely on the
[1:50:59] basis of heavy study of the scripture
[1:51:03] taught on the seven seals.
[1:51:05] He's about 95% right on the first seal
[1:51:07] and from there he goes into total
[1:51:09] darkness in terms of what he preached
[1:51:10] pretty much. But he got almost the first
[1:51:13] seal right purely on the basis of study.
[1:51:18] I was reading a quote before I came up
[1:51:19] here. Brother Bram says when you seek
[1:51:21] God out by man's wisdom you only get
[1:51:23] further away from him.
[1:51:25] 95% away is still not there. Like we
[1:51:28] said before, close only counts in hand
[1:51:30] grenades and horseshoes.
[1:51:32] But to think that that man, Clarence
[1:51:34] Larkin, so dedicated himself to the
[1:51:36] scripture that he almost got the first
[1:51:38] seal figured out, I say, "Wow, that's
[1:51:41] amazing."
[1:51:42] Listen, Brother Brandon wasn't the first
[1:51:44] to preach serpent seed. It had been
[1:51:46] preached before. Widely rejected by
[1:51:49] virtually everyone.
[1:51:51] All sorts of these different things.
[1:51:52] Amen. What was it? people probing at it
[1:51:55] in their sincerity, in their desire for
[1:51:58] understanding of the scripture. They go
[1:52:00] and they'd study and pray and study and
[1:52:02] pray. And I believe God blessed some of
[1:52:04] them. You can see, boy, you you look at
[1:52:06] some of those earies, you look at John
[1:52:08] Wesley, some of the things he preached,
[1:52:10] amazing, amazing. And his brother, just
[1:52:13] absolutely beautiful things that they
[1:52:15] had in the scriptures. But remember what
[1:52:17] we see here. Look at this list.
[1:52:20] Seven church ages. most that's that's
[1:52:23] what we would call dispensationalism
[1:52:25] really today would would feed into why
[1:52:26] we believe in seven church ages to a
[1:52:28] gentile church throughout the last 2,000
[1:52:30] years. That's something that really
[1:52:32] didn't pop up until the 1900s widely in
[1:52:34] Christianity.
[1:52:35] But he comes and he preaches that 70
[1:52:37] weeks of Daniel. Nobody understands 70
[1:52:40] weeks of Daniel except a message
[1:52:41] believer. Nobody. They've got elements
[1:52:44] of it. Nobody understands it. Seven
[1:52:46] seals. Good luck. Good luck. Go read
[1:52:50] everything out there on the seven seals.
[1:52:51] Don't
[1:52:53] Don't do it. It'll be a waste of your
[1:52:55] time. Total nonsense. Makes no sense.
[1:52:58] Seven the seven thunders. Yeah, right.
[1:53:02] Not going to happen. The rapture. Most
[1:53:04] people don't believe in it. And if they
[1:53:06] do believe in it, they can't place it at
[1:53:08] the right time. The tribulation,
[1:53:11] three and a half years. Everyone
[1:53:12] preaches seven years virtually.
[1:53:15] We don't preach it.
[1:53:17] The token original sin. That's a huge
[1:53:20] one. The original sin sets us up for why
[1:53:22] we needed a new new birth in the first
[1:53:23] place. You don't understand that. You
[1:53:26] don't understand why you need a new
[1:53:27] birth. You don't understand why you need
[1:53:28] redemption. Who is this Melzdc?
[1:53:33] That's that's Christ revealed.
[1:53:37] And people say it was just a man. Nobody
[1:53:39] knows where he came from. Nobody knows
[1:53:40] where he went. That's why they say he's
[1:53:42] without father, without mother.
[1:53:46] Marriage and divorce. Look out.
[1:53:49] Funny thing is, I think the Catholic
[1:53:51] Church is the closest to right on
[1:53:52] marriage and divorce of anybody. They
[1:53:53] say don't do it. Virtually everybody
[1:53:56] else has all the reasons for it. I'm
[1:53:57] being facitious on that a little bit,
[1:53:59] but I think the Catholic Church is one
[1:54:00] of the few that's actually held a line
[1:54:01] on divorce, generally speaking.
[1:54:04] Restoration promise, coming of Elijah,
[1:54:06] seventh angel messenger. Again, nobody
[1:54:09] believes it because if they did, they'd
[1:54:11] be looking for him. There are a few out
[1:54:13] there still looking for it. Kingdom of
[1:54:15] heaven parables, Israel's blind, the
[1:54:17] mystery of iniquity. Who is the son of
[1:54:19] predition?
[1:54:21] Mystery of Babylon, the mark of the
[1:54:23] beast. Everybody's looking at a chip in
[1:54:25] your hand or a chip in your head.
[1:54:27] They're saying it's here. It's here.
[1:54:28] It's here. And he says you've already
[1:54:29] got it and you don't know it.
[1:54:31] Amen. The new birth. Look at what people
[1:54:35] preach as a new birth today. One, they
[1:54:37] don't preach as new birth. They say,
[1:54:38] "Except Jesus into your heart."
[1:54:41] You'll never find that phrase in
[1:54:42] scripture.
[1:54:45] Jesus said, "You must be born again."
[1:54:51] Predestination.
[1:54:53] That's an amazing one. I love
[1:54:55] predestination. And the prophet himself
[1:54:57] only got it completely right in the last
[1:54:59] year of his ministry.
[1:55:01] Amen.
[1:55:05] He's not preaching outside of the Bible.
[1:55:07] He's restoring us to the truth that was
[1:55:10] already there. He's not coming with a
[1:55:12] new message. Amen. He's not coming with
[1:55:15] a new message. He's there to get rid of
[1:55:17] the confusion, of the fog, to connect
[1:55:18] the dots of all these things. And God
[1:55:20] was working through his ministry to
[1:55:22] clear things up. Amen. And provide
[1:55:23] direction to the bride long before he
[1:55:25] ever got to the seven seals. It's like I
[1:55:28] said before, he didn't get all this in
[1:55:29] 1963. God had been using him since 1933
[1:55:33] to develop that man. And I've said it
[1:55:35] before, you can't pre you can't get to
[1:55:37] the results of 63 unless you start in
[1:55:39] 33. You got to go through the maturing
[1:55:42] and the growing and the development that
[1:55:43] God put his prophet through. You want to
[1:55:46] become an adopted son, go through the
[1:55:48] process of an adopted son. Listen, Jesus
[1:55:50] had to grow in wisdom and stature.
[1:55:52] Brother Brandham had to grow in wisdom
[1:55:54] and stature. Guess what? We got to grow
[1:55:56] in wisdom and stature. That's just the
[1:55:58] way that God works. Amen. You want the
[1:55:59] same results, you got to go through the
[1:56:00] same process. God doesn't call us all to
[1:56:02] be prophets. That's for sure. But there
[1:56:04] are no shortcuts to becoming an adopted
[1:56:07] son or daughter of God. That's for sure.
[1:56:09] But remember what Paul what brother
[1:56:11] Brand would say. He said, 'I preached
[1:56:12] what Paul preached. Remember he saw the
[1:56:15] vision of the bride and these different
[1:56:17] things. He said, "How are they going to
[1:56:18] be judged?" And he said, "They'll be
[1:56:20] judged by Paul's message." And he says,
[1:56:21] "I preached what Paul preached and the
[1:56:23] whole bride scream back." They said,
[1:56:24] "We're resting on that church. We can't
[1:56:27] the the book of Revelation says you
[1:56:28] can't add one word or take one word from
[1:56:30] it, otherwise you lose your name out of
[1:56:32] the lamb's out of the book of life." He
[1:56:34] can't preach a new gospel. He's got to
[1:56:36] reveal what's already there. And the
[1:56:37] problem is is that they have this
[1:56:39] foregone conclusion today and they've
[1:56:42] had it for a long time that what they
[1:56:43] preach is the truth because it's widely
[1:56:45] accepted.
[1:56:47] And that prophet had to come and try and
[1:56:49] break them out of that. Remember what
[1:56:50] the scripture says?
[1:56:52] We preached out of Malachi. He says he's
[1:56:54] got to restore the children back to the
[1:56:56] fathers. Brother Brand would say or
[1:56:58] Jesus would say he's got to restore all
[1:56:59] things. He's got to restore the faith of
[1:57:01] the original fathers. And the Bible says
[1:57:03] Paul said faith cometh by hearing.
[1:57:06] Faith comes by understanding and
[1:57:08] understanding comes by the word of God.
[1:57:10] What brings faith? The word of God. If
[1:57:13] you want a rapturing faith, church,
[1:57:15] you've got to have a rapturing word.
[1:57:18] If you want a healing faith, you got to
[1:57:19] have a healing word. If you want a
[1:57:21] changing faith, you've got to have a
[1:57:23] changing word.
[1:57:25] If you want a delivering faith, you got
[1:57:27] to have a delivering word. If you don't
[1:57:29] believe in a rapture, you're not going
[1:57:31] to have rapturing faith. Remember what
[1:57:34] faith is? Bram said, "Faith is a
[1:57:36] revelation of the will of God."
[1:57:40] So when I believe that I'm going to have
[1:57:41] rapturing faith, why do I believe I'm
[1:57:42] going to go in a rapture, church?
[1:57:44] Because I believe that God said there's
[1:57:46] going to be a rapture, and I believe
[1:57:47] it's for me. Therefore, I believe there
[1:57:49] will be faith on the day that I need it
[1:57:51] to go in that rapture. But in the
[1:57:53] meantime, I believe that there's healing
[1:57:56] in his wings, that by his stripes, we
[1:57:58] are healed, that there's deliverance,
[1:57:59] that there's provision, that there's
[1:58:01] leadership. And so I've got faith in it
[1:58:02] because I've got a word that tells me
[1:58:04] it's available to you and I. You can't
[1:58:07] have faith in something you don't
[1:58:08] believe in. Amen.
[1:58:10] That faith is that God is wants to do
[1:58:12] something. That God said he's going to
[1:58:14] do something. And so that faith holds on
[1:58:16] no matter what. Amen. Now watch this
[1:58:18] last phase of the prophet's message in
[1:58:20] our day. Now
[1:58:24] remember, they had a form of godliness,
[1:58:26] but they're denying the power thereof.
[1:58:29] Watch what happens in Revelation 10. It
[1:58:31] says, "The angel which I saw stand upon
[1:58:32] the sea and upon the earth, lifted up
[1:58:34] his hand to heaven." This is the angel
[1:58:36] of the covenant, is Christ himself, "and
[1:58:38] swore by him that liveth forever and
[1:58:40] ever, who created heaven and the things
[1:58:42] that therein are in the earth and the
[1:58:44] things that therein are and the sea and
[1:58:45] the things which therein are, that there
[1:58:47] should be no time no longer." Paul said,
[1:58:50] "At the end there be perilous times."
[1:58:53] Daniel's told, "Seal up the book till
[1:58:55] the end of days." John, seal it up until
[1:58:58] this time. Okay? It's a perilous time,
[1:59:02] but it's a time of promise as well. He's
[1:59:05] only coming for He's coming for the
[1:59:07] promised people, church. He's not coming
[1:59:09] for the sinners. He says, "But in the
[1:59:11] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:59:14] the Leodysian church age messenger, when
[1:59:17] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[1:59:19] God should be finished as he had
[1:59:21] declared to assurance the prophets."
[1:59:24] Remember, there's that mysterious book.
[1:59:25] He comes down. He's got the open book in
[1:59:27] his hand. It was sealed with seven
[1:59:28] seals. John knew what was in there. John
[1:59:30] knew the things that were bound up, but
[1:59:32] he wasn't allowed to tell us about it.
[1:59:33] Daniel spoke of some of it. And so, a
[1:59:36] prophet had to come to show us what
[1:59:37] those seals were because a prophet is
[1:59:39] the divine revealer of the word. That's
[1:59:42] what he does. He speaks as thus sayeth
[1:59:43] the Lord. So, the amazing thing is is
[1:59:45] John foretold it. He writes it down in
[1:59:47] symbol form. And then what happens is
[1:59:49] God sends down a prophet in this age and
[1:59:52] he looks backward in time.
[1:59:55] those seven seals. He looks backward in
[1:59:57] time and he goes through seal number
[1:59:59] one, seal number two, seal number three.
[2:00:01] He says, "We're under seal number four.
[2:00:04] Now is the time of seal number four."
[2:00:06] And then he will point forward
[2:00:08] and he says, "Now we've got seal number
[2:00:10] five. That's tribulation." And 06,
[2:00:12] that's for the Jews. So he's pointing
[2:00:14] backward. He's showing what's been. He's
[2:00:17] pointing forward to what will be. And
[2:00:19] then he says, "We're right here."
[2:00:21] And what about that seventh seal? Well,
[2:00:23] that seventh seal breaks over four,
[2:00:25] five, and six because it goes over the
[2:00:27] whole thing. It's the coming of the
[2:00:28] Lord. It's the opening of the word, but
[2:00:30] it goes all the way to the end.
[2:00:32] Okay?
[2:00:35] He comes down. The scripture says that
[2:00:36] seventh church age messenger, that
[2:00:38] seventh angel messenger's message is
[2:00:40] sounding. It's going to finish the
[2:00:42] mystery of God. Notice it says should.
[2:00:44] See, in English, that word should means
[2:00:48] it's probable.
[2:00:50] You know, I would say when we leave
[2:00:53] church, we should go home. That's the
[2:00:56] reasonably expected thing to happen. But
[2:00:59] there's an element of doubt there cuz
[2:01:00] some may go to McDonald's and get an ice
[2:01:02] cream.
[2:01:04] Some may not make it home. And we think,
[2:01:07] well, that means there's kind of an iffy
[2:01:08] bit about this. The mystery of God
[2:01:10] should be finished. But that's not the
[2:01:11] original word. The original word says
[2:01:12] the mystery of God will be finished.
[2:01:15] There's no doubt about it. It's the
[2:01:17] ending of the mystery of God. Then
[2:01:18] what's that mystery of God?
[2:01:21] Prophet said it's all those mysteries
[2:01:22] that were under the seven seals. We had
[2:01:23] that list that we showed. All those were
[2:01:26] under those seals hidden under there.
[2:01:29] But then he would say he'd look down
[2:01:32] through time. He'd go through those
[2:01:33] seals. He'd look through the last 2,000
[2:01:35] years and he'd talk about those riders.
[2:01:37] Remember he had a white horse rider and
[2:01:38] a black horse rider, a red horse rider,
[2:01:40] and then a pale horse rider. And one had
[2:01:42] a a bow with no arrows and he had a
[2:01:44] crown on his head and then another one
[2:01:45] had a sword and another one had a
[2:01:47] balance. and all of these different
[2:01:48] things. And he showed us what every one
[2:01:50] of those were. He walked us through the
[2:01:52] church ages. Showed us when they
[2:01:53] started, when they finished, who the
[2:01:54] messengers were, what they preached,
[2:01:56] what the problem was, what the solution
[2:01:57] was. Took us back into history, took us
[2:02:00] back into the word, revealed all of
[2:02:01] those things. He showed them what led
[2:02:03] the churches wrong, how they got out of
[2:02:05] it. Amen. He preached it from Genesis to
[2:02:07] Revelation. And it completely changed
[2:02:10] our understanding of the scriptures.
[2:02:11] Completely changed it. Nobody preached
[2:02:13] what he preached, church. Completely
[2:02:15] changed. Why church? Because when Christ
[2:02:18] is present, he always breaks the bread.
[2:02:22] He always opens the word. Amen. So,
[2:02:25] Brother Bram comes and he preaches that
[2:02:27] original word that Paul preached and he
[2:02:29] proved it was the same. How? He got the
[2:02:33] exact same results. He preached what
[2:02:36] Paul preached. He preached what Christ
[2:02:38] preached. He proved that Christ was
[2:02:40] there. He had the signs and wonders. He
[2:02:42] had the discernment. He had the
[2:02:43] healings. He had the visions. Everything
[2:02:45] that Christ did on earth, everything
[2:02:47] that Paul and the apostles did, brother
[2:02:48] Brandham had it in his ministries.
[2:02:51] Nothing held back. God held nothing
[2:02:54] back, church, to give us the evidence
[2:02:55] that Christ was here. Amen.
[2:02:59] And people would come to him and say,
[2:03:00] "We agree with your gifts and we agree
[2:03:02] with your signs and wonders, but we
[2:03:04] disagree with your doctrine." And it's
[2:03:06] the exact same thing that they did to
[2:03:08] Jesus Christ.
[2:03:10] What' they do? They rejected the word
[2:03:11] and they crucified it. And brother
[2:03:12] Brandon would come and he say he say I
[2:03:14] indict you for the second crucifixion of
[2:03:17] Jesus Christ the word because they
[2:03:19] turned him down all over again. And so
[2:03:21] he's outside the churches
[2:03:24] knocking through a prophet's voice
[2:03:26] catching one here catching one there.
[2:03:29] And what happened church? This happened.
[2:03:32] A people accepted it. A people heard
[2:03:35] that and they said that's me. That's for
[2:03:38] me. I recognize that I've got a word
[2:03:41] abiding in here that got quickened as
[2:03:43] soon as I heard that prophet's voice or
[2:03:45] eventually. Right, brother Vichel.
[2:03:49] It may not happen instantly, church. I
[2:03:50] sat under it for years.
[2:03:53] Believed it since I was 10. Fought it
[2:03:55] since I was 10. Gave my heart to God at
[2:03:57] 17. 17 or 70, it matters not. Just
[2:04:01] accept it. Brother Ram said, "If you've
[2:04:03] got a call to to accept it, a call to
[2:04:05] come forward to it," he says that's the
[2:04:08] greatest thing, the most wonderful thing
[2:04:09] you could have, and don't hold back.
[2:04:12] Accept it while he's got it. Amen. But
[2:04:15] it's a small group.
[2:04:17] It's a small group.
[2:04:19] The prophet's gone. As brother Paul
[2:04:21] laughed, Moses, my servant, is dead. But
[2:04:25] that doesn't stop the message. It
[2:04:28] doesn't stop the promise. It doesn't
[2:04:29] stop the Holy Spirit. Amen. The
[2:04:31] prophet's gone, but he church, he was
[2:04:32] just here to show us Christ. He was just
[2:04:35] here to introduce the bride to her
[2:04:38] bridegroom.
[2:04:40] And now he's standing outside.
[2:04:42] Remember Eleazar? Once he introduced
[2:04:45] Rebecca to Isaac,
[2:04:47] I must decrease and he must increase.
[2:04:50] And God took him out of the picture.
[2:04:51] Why? Because God will let no man stand
[2:04:54] between him and his bride. Brother Ram
[2:04:56] wasn't trying to stand there, but he had
[2:04:57] to pull him back so that it would be a
[2:04:59] relationship between us and him. Amen.
[2:05:01] And what is it? Revelation 10:7. It's
[2:05:03] time to finish the mystery. What is it,
[2:05:05] church? It's the mystery of godliness.
[2:05:07] It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[2:05:10] It's Christ in his bride working one
[2:05:12] last time in the lives of faithful
[2:05:15] believers. Amen. And now we've got a
[2:05:17] part.
[2:05:18] Prophet's gone. What do we do?
[2:05:20] Revelation 10:8. take the book and eat
[2:05:23] it and it'll have an effect. It'll have
[2:05:26] a beautiful effect. Amen. And that's
[2:05:28] what we're going to get into over the
[2:05:29] next few services. God bless you. Let's
[2:05:31] stand this evening. I know I've been a
[2:05:33] little longer tonight. I apologize for
[2:05:35] that.
[2:05:37] I'm not sorry, but I apologize.
[2:05:41] It's never my intention to go long. I
[2:05:42] didn't have long notes, but um somebody
[2:05:45] kindly reminded me last service that I
[2:05:47] was talking too quickly and so I was
[2:05:49] trying to go slowly and carefully
[2:05:50] tonight. So hopefully you're able to
[2:05:52] keep up with that. Amen. But we're going
[2:05:53] to come back to this thought by God's
[2:05:55] grace if he would lead on the mystery
[2:05:57] finished in the next few services and
[2:05:59] then we'll slowly close out this service
[2:06:01] on the Holy Ghost. There's some other
[2:06:02] things that the Lord would have me to
[2:06:04] preach, I believe. Amen. But I want us
[2:06:06] to get us into the final stages of what
[2:06:07] it looks like as we're getting ready for
[2:06:09] this rapture, this resurrection. Amen.
[2:06:11] That what God's supposed to be doing in
[2:06:13] this people and what a surrender bride
[2:06:15] is going to look like. Amen. God bless
[2:06:17] you. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:06:20] Father, Lord, how blessed we are again,
[2:06:23] Lord, to know that we have eyes to see
[2:06:26] and ears to hear.
[2:06:28] Lord, some of us had to come out and
[2:06:30] they heard a cry that said, "Come out of
[2:06:32] her, my people." And they made that
[2:06:33] move, Lord. They separated themselves.
[2:06:35] And Lord, they took those steps and they
[2:06:37] paid a price for it. Some are still
[2:06:38] paying prices for it, Lord. But Lord, I
[2:06:41] look around today and I see the
[2:06:43] blessing. Lord, I see the fruit of a
[2:06:45] decision well made, Lord, when people
[2:06:47] walk towards you and your word, Lord.
[2:06:49] So, we're thankful tonight, Lord. We
[2:06:52] don't want to take these things for
[2:06:53] granted, Lord. And I know it's it's
[2:06:55] common knowledge to many, Lord, but
[2:06:56] there's those that have never heard it
[2:06:58] before, Lord. And I pray it would set an
[2:07:00] anchor in their heart, Lord, for why we
[2:07:02] believe this end time message, Lord. Why
[2:07:03] we quote a prophet, Lord, why we look to
[2:07:06] him for truth in this age, Lord, when so
[2:07:08] many people have been led astray. Lord,
[2:07:11] I pray you help us to not just read the
[2:07:13] book, Lord, but to eat the book, Lord.
[2:07:16] That it will become a part of us, Lord.
[2:07:18] That our lives would reflect what we've
[2:07:20] been eating. Lord, it certainly, Lord,
[2:07:22] we can't tell a lie for long. What we're
[2:07:23] eating will come out, Lord. I pray you
[2:07:26] help us people to see, Lord, that we're
[2:07:28] eating from the open book. Grant us
[2:07:31] grace, Lord. Remembering those that are
[2:07:33] sick, Lord, those that aren't here
[2:07:34] tonight, Lord. Praying a special mercy
[2:07:36] and grace for Sister Violet tonight,
[2:07:38] Lord. Praying you just go to her, Lord.
[2:07:40] Brother Earl as well, Lord. No doubt
[2:07:42] alone, praying a special grace to him.
[2:07:44] Heavenly Father, Lord, Brother Paul as
[2:07:46] well, that you would just raise him up,
[2:07:47] Lord. Help him to feel completely
[2:07:49] better. We pray in Jesus Christ's name
[2:07:51] we ask it. Amen.

[2:08:05] He is aable

[2:08:15] He is able
[2:08:19] more
[2:08:20] than able
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:25] to accomplish what concerns
[2:08:29] me today.
[2:08:33] He is aable,

[2:08:43] He can handle anything that comes my

[2:08:51] He is aable,

[2:09:09] He is aable,

[2:09:27] He is aable,

[2:10:37] I found it all. 1182 key of F.
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:45] I found it all
[2:10:49] when I lost everything
[2:10:54] and gave my life
[2:10:58] to serve a risen
[2:11:02] king. I found the truth
[2:11:07] that I've been searching
[2:11:10] for. I found it all
[2:11:15] when I found the Lord.
[2:11:19] I found it all
[2:11:24] when I lost everything
[2:11:28] and gave my life
[2:11:32] to serve a risen
[2:11:36] king. I found the truth
[2:11:41] that I've been searching
[2:11:44] for. I found it all.
[2:11:49] When I found the Lord one more time, I
[2:11:54] found it all.
[2:11:57] When I lost everything
[2:12:02] and gave my life
[2:12:06] to serve a risen
[2:12:09] king, I found the truth.
[2:12:14] What I've been searching
[2:12:17] for, I found it all.
[2:12:22] and I found the Lord.
[2:12:26] I was reading in devotions about the
[2:12:29] rich young ruler and he came to Jesus
[2:12:30] and he said, "What must I do to receive
[2:12:34] eternal life?"
[2:12:36] Brother Brown would say he knew he was
[2:12:38] missing something.
[2:12:40] Jesus listed the different laws, you
[2:12:42] know, love the Lord thy God with all thy
[2:12:44] heart, honor your father and mother, and
[2:12:47] these different things. He said, "Hey,
[2:12:48] I've done that all my life." Jesus said,
[2:12:51] "One thing thou lackest."
[2:12:53] You have everything.
[2:12:56] Your lack is that you have everything.
[2:12:59] You don't need me. You have everything.
[2:13:02] Give up everything and come follow me.
[2:13:03] Take up your cross and follow me.
[2:13:06] That's what a prophet did in this age.
[2:13:08] He went to people. He says, "You think
[2:13:10] you have everything? Give it up so you
[2:13:12] can find Christ." And he calls us to do
[2:13:14] the exact same thing today. I'll say
[2:13:17] this. You know, and I didn't play the
[2:13:20] clip from Deep Calla to the Deep. And
[2:13:22] I'm sorry to hold you this evening, but
[2:13:24] he had a man come up and stand before
[2:13:26] him and everyone's up there coming up
[2:13:29] for leukemia, you know, and that that
[2:13:31] that that shock that went through the
[2:13:33] crowd that when they when he said that
[2:13:36] girl had leukemia, it was a death
[2:13:37] sentence and the different ones. But
[2:13:39] that man came up
[2:13:42] and he said he says, "You're not up here
[2:13:43] for
[2:13:45] anything for your body or sickness."
[2:13:48] this. He says, he says, "You want a real
[2:13:51] revival in your church." Amen.
[2:13:55] He says, "You want something you don't
[2:13:57] have." And he came to a prophet to ask
[2:13:59] him to pray that his church would
[2:14:01] receive a true revival. I find so many
[2:14:03] times, and I speak by experience,
[2:14:06] what holds us back is what we're holding
[2:14:08] on to.
[2:14:10] And God's just asking us, give up what
[2:14:12] you're holding so tightly to, and you'll
[2:14:15] experience more of me than you've ever
[2:14:16] had. But as long as we hold tightly,
[2:14:19] whatever it might be, long as you hold
[2:14:22] tightly, I can't do anything for you.
[2:14:24] You got to let go. That young man had
[2:14:27] one thing that he couldn't let go. Jesus
[2:14:29] said, "You got to let it go." It says,
[2:14:31] "And he went away sad because he had
[2:14:35] many things."
[2:14:37] Amen. Don't let it hold you back.
[2:14:40] Whatever you're holding on to, Amen. Let
[2:14:42] go. Let God do something for you. Amen.
[2:14:45] We're going to sing one more song.
[2:14:46] Brother Mark, I'm going to ask you to
[2:14:47] close in prayer if you would. We're
[2:14:49] going to sing that song, I Worship You,
[2:14:50] Almighty God, 882.
[2:15:01] I worship
[2:15:04] you,
[2:15:06] Almighty
[2:15:09] God.
[2:15:12] There is none like you.
[2:15:19] I worship
[2:15:21] you,
