[13:42] heads before your throne of grace in
[13:45] order what a privilege it is that these
[13:47] doors are still open the services are
[13:49] still going well I just did a
[13:51] calculation on my phone and just realize
[13:53] there's 11 people here tonight
[13:56] ninety-nine point nine six percent of
[13:59] the sheep are at home in order we're
[14:02] able to be able to stream tonight

[14:10] now Lord were able to feed the flock at
[14:13] home not be here present so we just pray

[14:20] the podcasts everything every person
[14:22] that's here tonight putting their
[14:24] shoulder to the wheel Lord to make these
[14:26] service possible and Lord wherever they
[14:28] would go throughout the internet
[14:30] throughout the DVDs and in the audio
[14:32] cast wherever they would fall upon those
[14:34] ears father
[14:35] may the people receive and be blessed
[14:37] tonight Lord for we're not just hearing
[14:40] of a words of a man but we're hearing
[14:41] the words of Christ in an endtime and
[14:44] when I think about the the fear that's
[14:46] Lord just going across our world our
[14:49] nation our country our state or even our
[14:51] own cities Lord we believe no matter how
[14:54] the darkness see is how permeated we are
[14:57] in it father we believe there's a light
[14:59] at the end time and we're so thankful
[15:01] Lord you provided your children a light
[15:04] Lord a light to God their feet Lord to
[15:07] God their paths to illuminate their way
[15:09] and father we have a consolation tonight
[15:11] when many of the world as we
[15:13] no other groping in fear and anxieties
[15:16] and worries and stress Lord we can lay
[15:18] our head on the pillow knowing that the
[15:20] God that we serve he's a mighty God he's
[15:23] a great God he understands our need he
[15:26] understands this situation and he's
[15:28] already provided the way he's already
[15:31] met the need
[15:32] he's already provided the answer so Lord
[15:34] is in uncertain times we can have
[15:37] certainty that you're still God tonight
[15:39] Lord no matter what the virus may be
[15:41] looming we believe that you're the
[15:43] antidote tonight no you're the serum
[15:45] that the believer needs tonight Lord may

[34:57] [Music]
[34:59] let's turn our Bibles to first King 17
[35:04] Linda's in listenings then our study
[35:08] into different messages brother Branham
[35:11] spoke on be certain of God like to speak
[35:14] to you tonight on Amen certain in
[35:17] uncertain times certain in uncertain
[35:20] times first King 17 verse 1 it says an
[35:24] Elijah the Tishbite who was of the
[35:27] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[35:30] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[35:33] whom I stand there shall not be Dew or
[35:36] rain these years but according to my
[35:38] word and the word of the Lord came unto
[35:41] him saying get the hints and turned the
[35:44] eastward and hide thyself by the brook
[35:48] cherith that is before Jordan and it
[35:51] shall be that thou shall drink of the
[35:53] brook and as I have commanded and I have
[35:55] commanded the Ravens to feed thee there
[35:58] so he went and did according to the word
[36:00] of the Lord and he went and dwelt by the
[36:02] brook Cherith which is before Jordan and
[36:05] the Ravens brought him bread and flesh
[36:07] in the morning and bread and flesh in
[36:09] the evening and he drank of the brook
[36:11] and it came to pass after a while the
[36:14] brook dried up because there been no
[36:15] rain in the land and the word of the
[36:18] Lord came unto him saying arise get the
[36:21] in Zarephath which belongeth the Zion
[36:24] and dwell there behold I've commanded a
[36:28] widow woman there to sustain thee so he
[36:31] rose and went to their path and when he
[36:33] came to the gate of the city behold a
[36:35] widow woman was there gathering of
[36:37] sticks and he called her and said fetch
[36:39] me I pray thee a little but water in a
[36:42] vessel that I may drink and as she was
[36:45] going to fetch it he called to her and
[36:47] said bring me I pray thee a morsel of
[36:49] bread in the hand and she said as the
[36:52] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[36:54] but a handful of meal and a barrel and a
[36:57] little old and a cruse and behold I'm
[36:59] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[37:02] and dress it for me and my son that we
[37:04] may eat and die and Elisha said unto her
[37:08] fear not go and do as thou
[37:11] has said but make me there of a little
[37:13] cake first and bring it unto me and
[37:15] after make it for thee and for thy son
[37:17] for thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[37:20] the barrel and meal shall not waste
[37:22] neither shall the cruse of all fail
[37:25] until the day that the Lord sent his
[37:27] reign upon the earth and she went and
[37:30] did according to the saying of Elijah
[37:32] and she and he and her house
[37:34] did he many days and the barrel of meal
[37:38] wasted not neither did the cruse of all
[37:40] fail according to the word of the Lord
[37:43] which he spake by Elijah and it came to
[37:46] pass after these things that the son of
[37:48] the woman the mistress of the house fell
[37:50] sick and his sickness was so sore that
[37:53] there was no breath left in him and she
[37:56] said on d'lita what how about to do with
[37:58] thee or thou a man of God without coming
[38:00] to me to call my sin into remembrance
[38:03] and to slay my son and he said I heard
[38:05] give me that son and he took him out of
[38:07] her bosom and carried him up to a loft
[38:09] where he abode and laid him upon his own
[38:12] bed and he cried to the Lord and said O
[38:14] Lord my god has thou brought the evil
[38:16] upon the widow whom I've sojourn by
[38:19] slaying her son and he stretched himself
[38:22] upon the child three times and cried
[38:24] unto the Lord and said O Lord my god I
[38:26] pray thee let this child soul come again
[38:29] come into him again and the Lord heard
[38:33] the voice of Elijah and the soul of the
[38:35] child came unto him again and he revived
[38:37] and Elijah took the child and brought
[38:39] him down out of the chamber into the
[38:41] house and delivered him unto his mother
[38:43] and Elisha said see thy son liveth and
[38:47] the woman said to Elisha now by this I
[38:50] know that thou art a man of God and that
[38:54] the word of the Lord is in thy mouth his
[38:57] truth hallelujah amen we'll let you be
[39:00] seated this evening certain in uncertain
[39:05] times I got to looking at these words
[39:08] certain and uncertain certain means to
[39:12] be known for sure or to establish beyond
[39:16] doubt or to be beyond the reach of doubt
[39:21] uncertain means not to be able to you
[39:24] can't rely on it or not known or
[39:27] definite and you know brother branham
[39:29] would speak actually on both words he
[39:31] would speak about the uncertain sound
[39:33] and he would speak on certain be certain
[39:36] of God and you know in an uncertain
[39:38] sound he said things of the earth is
[39:40] shaking you can't put no confidence in
[39:43] anything everything is uncertain and
[39:45] anything that's uncertain he said I
[39:48] would just I like to stay away from the
[39:50] negative side he said I like it positive
[39:52] to be on the positive side but it goes
[39:54] on he said home life is become uncertain
[39:57] national life is uncertain the world is
[40:01] uncertain I would like to just say right
[40:03] here that even in the best of times
[40:06] under the best conditions a life is
[40:09] uncertain it doesn't take a pandemic for
[40:12] life to become uncertain it it may
[40:14] become more uncertain but even life in
[40:17] general is uncertain we're not
[40:19] guaranteed or promised tomorrow our life
[40:22] is but a vapor and it can be here today
[40:24] and gone in just a few minutes but where
[40:26] he said we're just living in a place
[40:28] where the whole world is having a
[40:30] nervous prostration like shaking
[40:34] everything every nation everybody one of
[40:36] us everyone is afraid of another one and
[40:39] he says everything is shaking National
[40:42] Life political life everything is shook
[40:44] up he said even Church life is shook up
[40:47] uncertain people don't even know hardly
[40:50] what to do anymore and we know this very
[40:53] much goes with what we're living in
[40:55] today you know it's very real the things
[40:57] that you read here in the uncertain
[40:59] sound because talking about church life
[41:01] you know this one thinks they got this
[41:02] right and this one's got this right and
[41:04] that one's got this figured out and all
[41:06] that's going on but he said though you
[41:08] know everything is uncertain we know the
[41:10] Bible speaks about everything that can
[41:12] be shaken will be shaken and you know
[41:15] and the world is uncertain that we're
[41:17] living in governments are uncertain life
[41:20] is uncertain Amen people are grasping at
[41:23] ideas or whatever to prop themselves up
[41:26] because of uncertainties no one knows
[41:29] what's next even the best of
[41:31] known of people that are experts in
[41:37] their field they don't know what's next
[41:38] they don't know what's around the next
[41:39] corner amen you know and as I said and
[41:42] even in the best of times this life is
[41:45] uncertain but we don't know when the
[41:48] last times together here on this earth
[41:51] you know just a few Sundays ago we met
[41:53] for the last time in a normal
[41:55] circumstance that for now and and what
[41:57] we see is normals and we hope to maybe
[41:59] one day get there we don't know nobody
[42:02] knows that's uncertain so life is
[42:04] uncertain you say well you're painting
[42:06] the awful dark picture and brother
[42:08] Branham said you asked me that question
[42:10] he said I intend to do that and he said
[42:12] I want to do it I did it for a purpose
[42:14] is you asked is there anything certain
[42:18] and he says yes there is something
[42:21] certain there's one thing that's certain
[42:23] one thing you can put your confidence
[42:26] one thing you can make sure is right
[42:29] when everything else is gone when
[42:31] everything else has faded away when
[42:33] everything else is falling away heavens
[42:36] and earth will pass away but my words
[42:38] shall not fail God has placed us or
[42:42] given us the ability to stand upon a
[42:46] certain foundation it's a foundation
[42:48] that's beyond the reach of doubt amen I
[42:51] don't mean doubts won't come that don't
[42:53] mean doubts won't enter your mind that
[42:55] will mean you will face fears or have
[42:57] fears but we wouldn't when you come down
[42:59] to it and you get down to the bottom of
[43:01] where you're standing on you want to be
[43:04] standing upon the Word of God amen and
[43:07] be certain in uncertain times there's
[43:09] only one thing we can place our trust in
[43:11] in this hour they're literally living in
[43:13] is God's Word our money isn't certain
[43:16] our homes in certain our lands are not
[43:18] certain nothing earthly or temporary is
[43:22] certain but some are making this into
[43:25] something that is not this thing that
[43:27] we're going through they're drawing
[43:28] lines in the sand they're propping
[43:30] themselves up with quotes and things to
[43:33] try to make it to where you know making
[43:34] saiyans that where the bride will get
[43:36] this virus and that's not certain
[43:39] there's no more certain than some
[43:41] someone in the bride or somebody that's
[43:43] a part of the bride
[43:44] it won't die in a car wreck or I won't
[43:47] to have some other disease or have some
[43:49] other the thing what is certain is the
[43:51] Lord God is he is he he will heal all
[43:54] our diseases and then we can have faith
[43:57] there we can stand upon I can't stand
[44:00] upon what somebody has come up with or
[44:02] what somebody thinks or what somebody
[44:04] who got it all figured out I can only
[44:06] stand upon the Word of God you said well
[44:09] we have faith we won't get this disease
[44:11] brother Brendan was saying like this he
[44:13] said sometimes faith will do great
[44:15] miracles and it still don't come from a
[44:18] spiritual heart hello somebody sometimes
[44:22] faith will do great miracles but still
[44:24] it doesn't come from a necessarily a
[44:26] spiritual heart our Lord said this he
[44:29] said many will come to me in that day
[44:31] and said have I not done this or done
[44:32] that in your name and then he said I
[44:35] will say to them depart from me you
[44:36] workers of iniquity
[44:38] what is iniquity is something that you
[44:41] knew to do right and you didn't do it
[44:43] and he will say I never knew you in the
[44:45] first place
[44:46] he said we're living in that day today
[44:49] he said but what we need today is not a
[44:52] lot of material things thank God not a
[44:55] lot of material things we have that we
[44:58] don't need greater churches we don't
[44:59] need greater congregations we don't need
[45:02] more radio more television we don't need
[45:04] more of these save what we need today to
[45:06] be spiritual is a person that will
[45:09] humble themselves before God
[45:11] if anybody hadn't even got a penny but
[45:14] we'll pray to that spirit within them is
[45:17] satisfied all hallelujah it's satisfied
[45:20] with the goodness of God now listen you
[45:22] can have this moment and don't depend on
[45:24] you having a lot of people around you
[45:26] you can have it regardless if you got
[45:28] yourself by yourself or your family or
[45:30] maybe a hundred or five hundred but the
[45:32] point is so you want to get to a place
[45:35] that when that spirit on the inside of
[45:38] you it's satisfied with the goodness of
[45:40] God and a revival can take place listen
[45:44] a revival is not dependent upon a big
[45:47] congregation a revival is not dependent
[45:50] upon a church full Amen he said one or
[45:52] two people on fire for God amen you can
[45:55] have a revival
[45:56] your home you can have a revival in your
[45:58] car you can have a revival but until
[46:00] that takes place inside our hearts and
[46:03] that will change our attitude that will
[46:06] change our atmosphere that we live in
[46:10] hallelujah that's what we need today
[46:12] amen some people's attitudes and
[46:14] atmospheres got all out of whack and
[46:16] things are going the wrong way for them
[46:18] right now and people are running in fear
[46:20] and things are happening but what gets
[46:22] you back to the right attitude er than
[46:24] the right atmosphere it's getting in the
[46:26] presence of God not in the news not in
[46:29] the things of this world but getting in
[46:32] the presence of God and how do you get
[46:34] in the presence of God start thinking on
[46:36] him start praying to him start asking
[46:38] for him to move start feeding upon his
[46:40] word and letting us presence around you
[46:43] amen see we might not have a pair of
[46:45] shoes on our feet
[46:46] we might be dressed in rags but
[46:48] something will be in your heart singing
[46:50] a melody this is I don't know how far
[46:54] this is going to go we might get to
[46:56] these places I don't have no idea but
[46:58] you might get to where you don't have
[46:59] any setting on a pair of shoes now that
[47:01] your dress may be rags but if you get to
[47:04] this place you'll still have something
[47:07] in your heart singing the melodies of
[47:09] God hallelujah the goodness of God and
[47:13] he said I would rather have that than
[47:16] all the money in the world because money
[47:20] ain't certainly can be here today and
[47:22] gone tomorrow he can be worth of a
[47:23] hundred dollars one day and not worth a
[47:25] cent the next day hallelujah so you
[47:28] can't say natural things you know are
[47:30] always a blessing of God you know David
[47:32] spoke to the Lord that the Lord raised
[47:35] seen the wicked spread forth you know
[47:37] like a great tree and then you know he
[47:39] said but did you God ask him he said did
[47:42] you ever consider that big tree at the
[47:45] end no matter how good a clothes they
[47:49] had or how much they had to eat but that
[47:53] isn't what gets you into the presence of
[47:55] God this body that we dwell in perishes
[47:59] regardless of how well is taken care of
[48:02] but it's the soul that matters it's the
[48:06] conditions of condition of the
[48:08] that moves us into the presence of the
[48:11] Living God you know anything we talk
[48:13] begin to talk about this woman that we
[48:15] read about this widow woman is that how
[48:17] that this little woman must have been of
[48:20] the calibre of Elijah but I thought that
[48:24] the people of God wouldn't suffer you
[48:26] know he talks about in many places he
[48:29] talks about the famine that had come in
[48:31] the land was because of the sin that was
[48:33] there but not everybody in the land was
[48:35] sinful come on now not everybody had
[48:39] bowed their knee to bail and we found
[48:41] that out a little later when God lied to
[48:43] us said I'm the only one that's serving
[48:45] you and then God told him what was this
[48:46] five seven thousand seven thousand debt
[48:48] and bowed their knee amen so just
[48:50] because that was sin the land that
[48:53] didn't mean everyone was sinful and just
[48:55] because it was famine the land it didn't
[48:57] mean that those that were not sinful
[48:59] didn't suffer they suffered they went
[49:03] through things and she was she was tied
[49:05] down to her last meal her last time but
[49:10] just to give it just to eat and what I'm
[49:12] gonna die I'm gonna give up my life
[49:15] because you know and sit but see this
[49:17] woman must have been of the same caliber
[49:21] of Elijah but yet she was suffering yet
[49:25] she was going through things just as
[49:26] everybody else was going through things
[49:28] she had to go to the marketplace and go
[49:30] through whatever everybody else was
[49:31] going through or however it was set up
[49:33] in that day she had that she was gone
[49:35] she was starving she was in famine the
[49:38] water this she was going through it just
[49:40] like everybody else was going through it
[49:42] but yet she was of the caliber of Elijah
[49:46] hallelujah amen and see she had bent but
[49:49] she had been chosen to entertain God's
[49:52] prophet hallelujah it wasn't her the
[49:56] chosen it was God who chose her
[49:59] hallelujah I'm believing there's a
[50:01] people on earth that's of the caliber of
[50:03] Elijah that knows the God of Elijah it's
[50:07] not just a god of books and tapes and
[50:09] quotes and scriptures but it's a God
[50:11] that stepped out of it and became a
[50:13] living
[50:14] even a living God Ramone them producing
[50:17] the same signs and wonders hallelujah
[50:21] and she had been chosen to entertain her
[50:23] oh god I want to be chosen to entertain
[50:26] you
[50:27] hallelujah I'm talking about I want to
[50:29] be chosen to entertain the Spirit of God
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:33] the land was burning up and no doubt
[50:36] this little woman being of that caliber
[50:39] but a believer tight oh how many is a
[50:42] believer tight hey man I love that is
[50:45] brother Tim brought this out about her
[50:47] brother John Laird spoke about doing
[50:50] some work for my sister and all the
[50:53] things that you needed done or whatever
[50:54] and he said well that's what we do you
[50:57] know I mean and then as believers we
[50:59] believe that's what we do no matter what
[51:02] if it's good times or bad times were
[51:05] still believers right no matter for up
[51:07] or down or over sick or wealthy are we
[51:10] wealthier we're poor if we're believers
[51:12] that's what we do we believe and she was
[51:15] of the believer type
[51:17] he says for we see that God would not
[51:20] have called her if she hadn't been
[51:22] worthy to entertain God's prophet for he
[51:26] would have never sent his prophet to a
[51:28] house that was unworthy so he was not it
[51:31] was not the prophets choosing it was
[51:33] God's choosing it wasn't her bidding him
[51:36] he was God bidding him and he had been
[51:38] placed by a Brook and Ravens were
[51:40] feedmill but in God's got God's
[51:43] commandment for something to take place
[51:45] and God surely went to a believer the
[51:47] same nature of Elijah but yet she was
[51:51] suffering she was going through the same
[51:56] things that was going on in the land she
[51:58] wants an exempt from it amen then she
[52:02] was going through things she was she was
[52:04] facing hardship she was and she was too
[52:07] but she was of the same caliber amen of
[52:09] there so she was of the believer type
[52:11] even though she was struggling she was a
[52:15] widow woman so she had had a lot of
[52:17] problems things that happened in her
[52:18] life nobody to take care of her young
[52:21] husband her husband dead and the young
[52:23] boy to raise in the land they depended
[52:25] on
[52:27] you know and they they wasn't named you
[52:29] know no doubt wasn't able to go to a
[52:31] grocery store like we've been accustomed
[52:33] to go and do and and you know but had to
[52:35] put in the crops in the field to have
[52:37] anything to eat but everything now was
[52:40] decaying and it was because of the
[52:42] iniquity of the people and their moral
[52:44] decay had brought a drought on the land
[52:46] and they was all starving and dying
[52:53] believers and non-believers all starving
[52:57] and dying and then we find that no doubt
[52:59] she prayed night after night all night
[53:02] and she began to see that miracle meal
[53:04] barrel going down down down down and it
[53:09] must got to a place it was not even
[53:11] another cup full of meal in the barrel
[53:13] all she had was a little handful just a
[53:16] few drops and death was coming right to
[53:20] her door but there was no way of getting
[53:22] any more the whole nation was starving
[53:26] and the all was running out just a
[53:28] spoonful little just enough to make
[53:30] another bridge piece of bread and eat it
[53:33] and die well you told my sincerity in
[53:38] prayers he said you let's that strike
[53:40] your home you'll be a little more
[53:42] sincere than you were this morning when
[53:44] you know death lays at the door he's I
[53:47] believe we think perhaps like this when
[53:49] she prayed all night long for one more
[53:52] day settling it was going to be over she
[53:55] looked at the pale lips of her little
[53:57] boy three or four years old see his own
[53:59] bones dwindled away as the flesh was
[54:02] coming to them it must have been a
[54:03] terrible thing as his mother seeing this
[54:06] going on day after day after day going
[54:10] down down down down he said may God let
[54:15] this soak and every one of you you if
[54:17] you never hear me preach again let this
[54:19] be a message
[54:20] it's strange most strange that sometimes
[54:22] God lets things get that way hello
[54:27] somebody God lets things get that way
[54:31] you know when we've confessed our sins
[54:33] and we met every requirement that God
[54:35] requires and we believe on God there's a
[54:38] circle
[54:39] stance has to be met and according to
[54:40] the will when we met them all and yet he
[54:43] lay silent he won't answer us I'm sure
[54:46] I'm speaking to people this morning
[54:47] who's come to that place I've been there
[54:49] myself many times hello somebody
[54:53] I've been there myself many times this
[54:59] is his words and I have been there
[55:01] myself many times he said I've went back
[55:05] and I've traced my life many times I've
[55:07] turned over every stone and I'd find
[55:10] where I'd maybe done something wrong and
[55:11] go make it right Lord God I'll make it
[55:13] right and go do so come back again say
[55:16] now Lord now our God you'll have
[55:18] something surely I've met the requester
[55:19] required to me to do and every
[55:21] requirement I've met and still seemingly
[55:24] he won't move he seems to sit silent
[55:27] that's when you've got to be sure he's
[55:31] God if he answers or not he's God if he
[55:37] does something about it or not he's God
[55:40] if he heals me or not he's God you know
[55:47] I got the privilege of meeting brother
[55:49] Giovanni coenen there right there in New
[55:53] York been praying for them he goes to
[55:56] brother Yvan carry-ons church and and it
[56:00] met him at a meeting up there in Canada
[56:02] a couple of last year's sometime and he
[56:05] was given a testimony of his wife and
[56:08] her longing for a child I don't remember
[56:10] exactly the details may not get it all
[56:13] exactly right but the gist of it is this
[56:16] she was born without something very
[56:18] needful in the reproduction in the
[56:20] organs and the female and she was born
[56:23] without it and and and it just the
[56:26] doctors told her it's impossible you
[56:27] can't have a baby but it just was on her
[56:30] I want a baby I want a baby she would
[56:31] not give up just day and night calling
[56:34] wanting baby so he was just trying to
[56:36] encourage her and finally you know not
[56:38] me but I think that went many times and
[56:41] talked with the pastor and finally this
[56:43] last result again he takes her to the
[56:45] pastor there and it says look you know
[56:47] this is she's just so down and you know
[56:49] just constantly I want a baby I want a
[56:52] baby
[56:52] and the pastor master of these words he
[56:56] said what if sister
[56:57] he don't give you a baby then what said
[57:01] her head was bowed she lifted up their
[57:05] eyes tears streaming down and she said I
[57:07] was still loving in just a few months
[57:12] later and still have time later she had
[57:13] a and she got pregnant now they have a
[57:15] little daughter hallelujah no matter
[57:19] what you're going through you need to be
[57:21] certain he's God
[57:22] that's something you've got to stand on
[57:25] no matter how hard it may get no matter
[57:27] how terrible it may be no semen no
[57:29] matter how bad it may get it doesn't
[57:32] matter he's still God and he can get to
[57:35] your last meal he can get to your last
[57:38] crumbs and he moved on the scene just
[57:42] like he did for this woman he can get to
[57:45] your last breath and he'd come and move
[57:47] on the scene and everything be made
[57:49] totally whole he's that kind of God be
[57:55] certain in these moments you have to be
[57:58] certain he's God and if he's God he's
[58:02] got it all in control he's not lost it
[58:06] it's not waver waver always shaken is
[58:08] not because he's lost control come on
[58:12] somebody
[58:13] he's stealing control he's still
[58:15] orchestrating this all about to come to
[58:17] an end to a projected to his to what he
[58:21] knows by is foreknowledge he's getting
[58:23] it to move right to that place
[58:26] hallelujah you must be certain before
[58:29] you do anything you must be certain in
[58:31] your heart that is God and when you met
[58:34] everything he said when you sure he's
[58:36] God then your faith goes right there and
[58:39] your faith stands and stands steady for
[58:43] it knows he is hallelujah it knows he is
[58:47] and it will hold steady
[58:50] it won't move faith will move for it's
[58:52] sure that God is and it's sure that God
[58:56] is a rewarder of those who diligently
[58:58] seek Him and he said may this go way
[59:02] down deep and never move from you

[59:16] heart you believe that he is God's only
[59:18] testing your faith he loves to do that
[59:22] you confess your sin you met a
[59:24] requirement and yet he still lay silent
[59:27] remember faith says he is and faith
[59:31] holds own not knowing what is going to
[59:33] happen or how it's going to happen it
[59:35] just knows it will happen and he knows
[59:38] that he is and he's certain that he is
[59:40] and remember if he is then his word is
[59:46] true and if he required you to meet
[59:50] those circumstance and you did then he's
[59:53] obligated to take care of his word oh my
[59:58] god maybe I read that one more time let
[1:00:01] it sink in real deep it says if you he
[1:00:05] required you to meet these circumstances
[1:00:07] and you did he's obligated to take care
[1:00:12] of his word he's obligated to that word
[1:00:17] he has to bring it to pass because it's
[1:00:20] his word and it cannot fail hallelujah
[1:00:24] he says everybody knows the moments
[1:00:27] don't back off and say well I never got
[1:00:29] healed
[1:00:29] he said you poor weak faith don't
[1:00:32] believe that if everything anything if
[1:00:33] everything's confessed everything's
[1:00:36] meant faith holds don't let nothing
[1:00:38] nothing but there's nothing will move it
[1:00:40] he is you're sure they that wait upon
[1:00:42] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:00:46] shall mount up with wings of an eagle
[1:00:47] they shall run and not be weary and if
[1:00:50] they walk they shall not faint wait when
[1:00:53] you met his requirements wait and it
[1:00:56] will bring your faith to a showdown
[1:00:57] God's requirement has been met and you
[1:01:01] have fully considered it and you've done
[1:01:03] everything he said to do then your faith
[1:01:05] rests right there that he is be certain
[1:01:08] of God be certain of God he loves to
[1:01:14] test us he loves to see the reaction of
[1:01:18] faith
[1:01:21] hallelujah God loves to see how you will
[1:01:25] react hello
[1:01:29] God loves to see how you will react when
[1:01:33] you hear bad news do you react in fear
[1:01:35] is that your first reaction is that you
[1:01:39] first go to or if you hear something
[1:01:41] it's something going on up this pandemic
[1:01:43] what's what's guiding you is it fear
[1:01:45] come on now how are you reacting I'm not
[1:01:49] saying you got to go out and test God
[1:01:50] and prove God
[1:01:51] you know we've read it here with the
[1:01:53] first Wednesday night of Martin Luther
[1:01:55] how he operated I believe that's a good
[1:01:57] guideline amen you know do what do
[1:01:59] what's required to do what you supposed
[1:02:01] to do he meant wash your hands do all of
[1:02:04] that
[1:02:05] be smart fine but don't fear believe God
[1:02:13] if you do happen to get it he can heal
[1:02:16] you he will
[1:02:19] it's his word God likes to see how you
[1:02:23] were react when you say O Lord I believe
[1:02:26] you thou art my Savior I believe that
[1:02:30] you're my healer I believe that you're
[1:02:32] the one who gives the Holy Spirit the
[1:02:34] things that I'm requiring you're the God
[1:02:36] who gives that and when you confess all
[1:02:39] your sins and promise God that you do if
[1:02:42] you he'll let you get where well and
[1:02:44] then don't and then because it don't
[1:02:46] happen you run off like a coward
[1:02:47] somewhere God can use that there's no
[1:02:50] way for him to use it there's no way for
[1:02:52] him to hit you because the only answers
[1:02:54] faith then all of a sudden you go away
[1:02:58] and he can't answer you but true faith
[1:03:00] stands there being sure that God is and
[1:03:03] being certain that he is and if God asks
[1:03:06] just thing to be done to confess your
[1:03:08] sins and so forth
[1:03:09] and you've done it faith says he is and
[1:03:12] it's a certain is going to happen and
[1:03:14] your request has been granted hallelujah
[1:03:20] your request has been granted God is
[1:03:23] sure of his work and he knows his world
[1:03:26] will produce the healing that's required
[1:03:31] hallelujah I'm sure of his word I know
[1:03:34] that there's a serum here hallelujah
[1:03:38] but listen those witnesses has been said
[1:03:40] the virus that were really worried about
[1:03:42] ain't the co V of 19 the virus were
[1:03:45] worried about coldness and formulas and
[1:03:48] ungodly listen and sins of this world
[1:03:51] that's the virus we're worried about but
[1:03:53] there is an inoculation there is a bla
[1:03:57] that I've taken all away from you and
[1:04:00] make a life out of you that you never
[1:04:03] thought possible to live it couldn't
[1:04:07] live on your own be sure he's God you
[1:04:13] know in so many cases of people that
[1:04:16] went through hard times you know yet
[1:04:20] Daniel in the Hebrew children that were
[1:04:21] taken off but they had purposes in their
[1:04:24] heart they was gonna serve God there
[1:04:25] wasn't ungodly people they were godly
[1:04:28] boys they purpose and we're not going to
[1:04:31] eat the Kings meat we're not going to do
[1:04:32] this we're gonna pray even when the
[1:04:34] decree says not to we're gonna pray
[1:04:36] we're gonna give we're going to serve
[1:04:38] God we're gonna do what's right you know
[1:04:41] but yet even though good people and
[1:04:44] children of God they suffered they went
[1:04:48] through things they they went through
[1:04:49] just like everybody else was going
[1:04:51] through and here they had to go for four
[1:04:56] or five furnace facing the certain death
[1:05:01] seemingly it was impossible seem like
[1:05:04] they need to survive it a hundred
[1:05:07] percent death rate to be thrown into
[1:05:11] this fiery furnace seemed impossible and
[1:05:15] they said King we're not going to bow do
[1:05:19] what you wanted to do we're not gonna
[1:05:21] bow our God is able to deliver us but if
[1:05:24] he doesn't we're still not going to bow
[1:05:27] see they were sure and certain he's God
[1:05:31] the fire didn't change who he was the
[1:05:34] floods don't change who he is
[1:05:35] sickness don't change
[1:05:37] Julia's problems don't change you is
[1:05:39] financial struggles does not change who
[1:05:41] he is
[1:05:42] hallelujah storms don't change you yet
[1:05:45] they knew he was Jehovah they knew he
[1:05:48] answered prayer whether he did in their
[1:05:51] case or not he would have to be for the
[1:05:53] good for they had made their statement
[1:05:55] they confess their sins and they were
[1:05:57] willing to walk into death and when they
[1:05:59] were going to the fiery furnace knowing
[1:06:01] that they were certain that if God let
[1:06:03] them burn up he would raise them up
[1:06:05] again they were certain of God because
[1:06:08] they knew that God would work everything
[1:06:10] for their good yah I mean we need to not
[1:06:14] forget that Scripture maybe in Romans
[1:06:16] 8:28 to them that are the called
[1:06:19] according to his purpose all things work
[1:06:21] together a man he's working it all out
[1:06:24] for our good hallelujah
[1:06:29] I don't know I just got a text from our
[1:06:33] God in Israel
[1:06:34] reminding us that today actually starts
[1:06:36] the celebration for Israel they're
[1:06:38] starting their holiday celebrating amen
[1:06:41] they're leaving Egypt their Exodus are
[1:06:44] leaving Egypt so Alleluia their Passover
[1:06:48] are coming now and then and then then
[1:06:50] being under the blood and watching the
[1:06:53] things that took place
[1:06:54] amen listen we're right here at the same
[1:06:57] times the same places hallelujah and I'm
[1:07:02] thankful I'm under the blood people get
[1:07:13] the idea as do the Jews the Jews thought
[1:07:17] that he was coming to save them from the
[1:07:19] Romans you know and he was going to
[1:07:21] raise up an army and he was going to
[1:07:23] defeat them by like he'd like he did
[1:07:25] though he's gonna drive out the Romans
[1:07:26] and set them free but that wouldn't have
[1:07:28] freedom he was coming for he was coming
[1:07:30] to set them free from sin hallelujah in
[1:07:35] the first Exodus he set them free from
[1:07:37] the Egyptians and he took them to a land
[1:07:39] the second one he set us free from sin
[1:07:42] that's what that blood is for amen
[1:07:45] that blood is an inoculation from sin
[1:07:50] but just because we're under the blood
[1:07:53] or the token does not mean we won't get
[1:07:55] sick come on
[1:07:59] people had get cancer I mean we have bad
[1:08:02] accidents our prophet died in a car
[1:08:04] accident and people made statements
[1:08:07] because he died he's anti word and
[1:08:09] you're anti word if you die nonsense
[1:08:12] ridiculous nonsense this blood is an
[1:08:18] inoculation against sin but it also in
[1:08:22] that has a healing power but it does not
[1:08:26] make you a meme unity in the sense of
[1:08:29] you'll never get sick
[1:08:31] you will get sick these bodies or not
[1:08:34] amen eternal bodies their temporary
[1:08:37] bodies their bodies that's growing old
[1:08:39] just because you're under the token or
[1:08:42] on the blood don't mean you're not
[1:08:43] getting old there go our bodies are
[1:08:46] going down down down down down but this
[1:08:51] blood does produce an inoculation an
[1:08:54] immunity against sin but in it it also
[1:08:59] gives us the ability to draw strength
[1:09:02] from it to receive health again
[1:09:04] hallelujah and this is what he was
[1:09:07] talking about he said they go through
[1:09:09] the through the fire furnace you go
[1:09:12] through things in your life and you
[1:09:13] don't know if he's going to deliver you
[1:09:14] or not but that doesn't matter what
[1:09:17] matters he's God their statements was
[1:09:22] not depending on whether he was going to
[1:09:24] deliver them or not but there was
[1:09:26] depending on he's God here O king you're
[1:09:29] not God you don't have the final say in
[1:09:33] this matter I may go to a fire furnace
[1:09:36] but that's not the end of my life I got
[1:09:38] another life coming ha-la-lu
[1:09:41] you're not God and I like to tell the
[1:09:43] devil you're not God you don't have a
[1:09:46] final say - when we draw our last breath
[1:09:50] God has that it's in his hands and I am
[1:09:55] in his hands and you are in his hands
[1:09:57] and be certain he is God because if he
[1:10:05] they died he they would raise up on the
[1:10:06] resurrection so they made this statement
[1:10:09] they were certain they walked right to
[1:10:11] the fiery furnace no matter to decrees
[1:10:17] we're not going to bow they bound their
[1:10:19] hands are bound their feet
[1:10:21] they started them to the fiery furnace
[1:10:23] God standing there looking at it they
[1:10:26] were certain he was God they'd made
[1:10:28] their confession they had made
[1:10:29] everything right that they knew what
[1:10:31] they were certain and as they walked to
[1:10:33] the fire furnace right as the lapse
[1:10:36] moment came there he come riding out of
[1:10:39] heaven on the chariot of wind and began
[1:10:42] Fanning the breezes off of him while he
[1:10:44] talked with him and fellowship with them
[1:10:46] in the fire God let your faith comes to
[1:10:52] a spot where it will react
[1:10:56] there was job in the Old Testament
[1:10:59] another believer who had hard times lost
[1:11:03] a lot of things had a bad days real bad
[1:11:06] days Satan his accuser accused him of
[1:11:09] being a secret sinner but joke knew he
[1:11:13] had sinned he knew he had offered a
[1:11:14] sacrifice he was certain he had met
[1:11:17] God's requirements Satan took his camels
[1:11:21] he took a sheep he took his children but
[1:11:24] still joke stood for he's certain he's
[1:11:27] God he had met the requirements he'd
[1:11:30] searched
[1:11:31] he found out I made the burnt offerings
[1:11:34] I made the sacrifice I made the feast
[1:11:37] I've done what God required I've made
[1:11:40] the burnt offerings for my children and
[1:11:42] confess their own Oh God he says when a
[1:11:44] man keeps what God said dude he's
[1:11:47] certain he's God he has to answer faith
[1:11:50] calls him on the scene every time and
[1:11:52] when you've done what you know is right
[1:11:54] when you met his requirements when you
[1:11:56] confessed and made right and done
[1:11:58] restitutions and lady before God I don't
[1:12:01] care how

[1:12:05] to put that faith there you've done your
[1:12:08] works now he wants to see your faith by
[1:12:10] your works he wants to see what you will
[1:12:12] do he wants to see how you were react he
[1:12:16] wants to see what you will say
[1:12:21] hallelujah this is where job God one day
[1:12:27] God took him back beyond all of his
[1:12:32] problems even beyond his good times on
[1:12:36] earth because at one time no doubt Jobe
[1:12:38] had a wonderful life seemingly a very
[1:12:40] rich man
[1:12:41] had many like how many camels many rocks
[1:12:43] and marks and many this that and the
[1:12:45] other many houses many children in a few
[1:12:48] days it's all gone but there were good
[1:12:51] days before the bad days but God took
[1:12:54] him back before even the good days even
[1:12:57] that's where our company has to lie in
[1:13:00] these hours and these bad times that
[1:13:02] were here it's got a lie and even more
[1:13:04] than our good times are our future good
[1:13:07] times it's got to go back before all of
[1:13:10] that who were you before the foundation
[1:13:12] of the world
[1:13:13] where were you job before the foundation
[1:13:17] of the world when the morning stars sang
[1:13:19] and shouted for joy you were in the mind
[1:13:23] of God job I had you in my mind even
[1:13:26] before you had a bad day or a good day
[1:13:29] or a great day or just a social day I
[1:13:32] already had you in my mind Oh hallelujah
[1:13:36] if we could just get that tonight he
[1:13:38] already thought about it
[1:13:40] before there was ever a coronavirus
[1:13:42] cancer surgeon died being his problem
[1:13:44] situation financial struggle he already
[1:13:47] had us in his mind and what he had of us
[1:13:51] in his mind he cannot change his mind
[1:13:54] and he holds on to it and he said I'm
[1:13:56] going to have a bride without spot
[1:13:57] without wrinkle there will be an
[1:14:00] overcomer of laodicean church age
[1:14:03] hallelujah whoo where were you maybe I
[1:14:10] need to ask you this just real simply
[1:14:12] where were you before the coronavirus
[1:14:14] came

[1:20:44] tested here
[1:20:45] he puts our faith to this test to see if
[1:20:49] we really believe he's God you know

[1:24:51] maybe these times you forgot God before
[1:24:55] things are so busy life going on God's
[1:24:58] won't remind you he's first no matter
[1:25:03] what anybody else says what any evidence
[1:25:05] how gloomy it looks whatever it may be
[1:25:07] take God first doctor says I can't get
[1:25:12] well take God first I'm a sinner take
[1:25:16] God first I'm a prostitute I'm a
[1:25:19] drunkard take God's word first though
[1:25:22] your sins be as scarlet there'll be me
[1:25:24] white as snow though they are red like
[1:25:25] crimson it'll be made white like wool
[1:25:28] bring me a little cake first all that
[1:25:31] you got bring it to me are you willing
[1:25:34] to give everything you've got and put it
[1:25:37] in his hands we like to be in control we
[1:25:45] like to be able to dictate where our
[1:25:46] money goes and where this goes and where
[1:25:48] that go can you put it in his hands are
[1:25:52] you willing and give it to him
[1:25:55] bring me a morsel of bread fetch me a
[1:25:58] little water there was something in her
[1:26:03] there was something that this is there
[1:26:05] was something in her that's moved and
[1:26:09] told her that man knows what he's
[1:26:12] talking about that man has met God that
[1:26:18] man has been in the presence of God that
[1:26:21] man is not just speaking empty words but
[1:26:24] that man is vindicated hallelujah
[1:26:29] man what happened she turned in her
[1:26:35] gloom and she began to walk and it came
[1:26:39] to the place where she was obeying what
[1:26:43] he said she was listening to what he
[1:26:47] said she tuned out everything else
[1:26:49] anybody else said what her own thought
[1:26:51] says what everything else around her and
[1:26:53] she was only listening to what he said
[1:26:57] the gloom broke the gloom broke
[1:27:04] that's saith the Lord the barrel will
[1:27:07] not go empty and the cruse run dry until
[1:27:10] the day that the Lord God sends rain
[1:27:13] upon the earth she made a cake and she
[1:27:15] gave it to the Prophet she went back and
[1:27:18] she got some more and the next day she
[1:27:20] went back and she got some Lord and the
[1:27:22] next day she went back and she got more
[1:27:24] every morning every day why because she
[1:27:27] took God at His Word listen the gloomy
[1:27:31] times that's looking right now may not
[1:27:33] look good gloomy if you'll just take his
[1:27:36] word and be certain he's God but the
[1:27:42] reason it looks so gloomy is you're
[1:27:45] looking at it the wrong way in Germany
[1:27:50] the Bradham talks about a picture I
[1:27:52] haven't ever seen the picture love to
[1:27:54] see it talk about the cloud land so when
[1:27:58] you see it off in a distance it's the
[1:28:01] horriblest looking gloom you ever seen
[1:28:03] clouds matted together looking them from
[1:28:06] a long distance but when you get up
[1:28:08] close to it it changes its angel's wings
[1:28:13] beating singing Hallelujah is to the
[1:28:16] Lord so that's what gloom is sometimes
[1:28:21] if you look at it at a long distance it
[1:28:24] looks gloomy and dark but you just stay
[1:28:27] with God's Word and be certain is God
[1:28:29] and when it moves up close you'll find
[1:28:32] is just angel's wings beating together
[1:28:36] bringing it all about to serve his
[1:28:40] purpose
[1:28:41] and serve his will he said I know the
[1:28:44] thoughts that I think of you there are
[1:28:48] thoughts of an expected end whether it
[1:28:51] be a rapture whether it be going home by
[1:28:54] the grave whatever it is it's gonna be
[1:28:57] worked for his will and for his way she
[1:29:03] was somewhat like Abraham was called on
[1:29:07] to give everything she had and lay it
[1:29:09] upon the altar he said maybe you're cold
[1:29:12] like that today give up your ways give
[1:29:16] up your unbelief give up everything you
[1:29:19] got and just take the oil and the word
[1:29:22] and mix it together and put it on the
[1:29:26] altar of self-sacrifice and you'll find
[1:29:29] out it'll call God on the scene as
[1:29:31] certain as I'm standing in the pulpit
[1:29:35] you need God tonight mix the meal
[1:29:39] together take you some meal take a
[1:29:42] little bit of Jesus and the Spirit of
[1:29:45] God and let it begin to mix together in
[1:29:47] your heart be joy unspeakable and full
[1:29:51] of glory and all of a sudden what looks
[1:29:54] so gloomy looks so dark and so dismal
[1:29:57] looks so helpless and so hopeless
[1:29:59] you realize angels have drugged clothes
[1:30:03] it's angels among us in her homes on a
[1:30:07] job a wall of fire moving about us God
[1:30:11] working everything according to his
[1:30:13] purpose and his plan and his will we can
[1:30:18] be certain in uncertain times because we
[1:30:22] have a certain God God bless you tonight
[1:30:26] as we bow our heads maybe a little
[1:30:29] different maybe a little different speed
[1:30:39] just want to soak in real deep turn your
[1:30:45] eyes back on Jesus keep him on him don't
[1:30:49] let him drift off in these times look
[1:30:52] only into his wonderful face and the
[1:30:56] things of this world will go strangely
[1:30:59] dim the gloom would just dissipate and
[1:31:04] the joy bells of heaven open up in your
[1:31:06] heart and your soul
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:12] he's here for you tonight are you
[1:31:16] willing to lay your all upon the altar I
[1:31:20] believe these have been some real sort
[1:31:22] of soul-searching times just looking
[1:31:25] over things making sure you met all the
[1:31:28] requirements it's a good time for that
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:36] time to set aside and apply yourself
[1:31:40] more to the things of God and the Word
[1:31:41] of God prayer don't let fear guide you
[1:31:51] sure take your precautions as you would
[1:31:55] any other time
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:59] but all that fear
[1:32:03] and don't let man's words put fear in
[1:32:06] your heart either
[1:32:10] man's words are only temporary God's
[1:32:14] Word is eternal something we can stand
[1:32:17] on and be certain that he's God
[1:32:23] or Jesus father just a little thought is
[1:32:28] looking at these things Lord this week
[1:32:32] searching Lord looking
[1:32:35] nor did my own heart just making sure we
[1:32:38] met every requirement Bloods on the door

[1:32:47] souls our life guiding this directive
[1:32:50] load me right now I never hold me since
[1:32:54] in sincerity lured me to just search
[1:32:56] themselves Lord maybe they've been
[1:32:58] looking toward the wrong things and
[1:33:01] gloominess has covered them without the
[1:33:03] fear spirits trying to attach the things
[1:33:07] God merely turned their eyes to you
