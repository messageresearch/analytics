[1:02:40] Lord turn with me to st. Mark's Gospel
[1:02:42] chapter three st. Mark's Gospel chapter
[1:02:45] three being prayers the Lord willing our
[1:02:50] brother Mark would minister on Wednesday
[1:02:51] night amen the grace of God be with us
[1:02:56] and also the Lord willing I was hoping
[1:02:59] to be able to try to finish these
[1:03:00] thoughts concerning the will of God and
[1:03:04] doing God a service but the majority
[1:03:07] today is not doing it according to his
[1:03:10] will that's the truth there's many doing
[1:03:12] God a service but not according to his
[1:03:14] will so brother there's going to going
[1:03:16] to be a few found doing the will of God
[1:03:19] according to the will of God a man by
[1:03:22] the grace of God and brothers so grace
[1:03:24] to us I pray and see it's it's getting
[1:03:29] to the place we know what's getting
[1:03:30] worse well he said if you didn't shorten
[1:03:32] time there'd be no flesh say well
[1:03:34] brother that means it's pretty bad
[1:03:36] spiritually it is so for the elects sake
[1:03:39] he was short in time so for your sake
[1:03:42] for my sake your shortened time thank
[1:03:45] God for that
[1:03:45] amen why because of the spirits and then
[1:03:49] that are influencing the people
[1:03:50] physically and religiously and
[1:03:53] spiritually upon the but they're so
[1:03:55] deceived a man
[1:03:57] so the grace of God be with us brother
[1:03:59] and I turn to this as I mentioned to our
[1:04:01] brother John and I know maybe it'll it's
[1:04:05] striking to to even our brother Joshua I
[1:04:08] guess or any any brother from Africa
[1:04:11] I said you know I said one time the
[1:04:13] probably God said there might be a dozen
[1:04:14] not ever come out of Africa and he was
[1:04:17] referring of course to the branch of the
[1:04:19] rapture and that would be the living
[1:04:21] Saints
[1:04:22] well well brother no no not gonna be
[1:04:24] that few is it oh yeah
[1:04:27] and I thought and some I think sister
[1:04:30] Betty said there's only a dozen out of
[1:04:32] Africa she said there won't be no one
[1:04:33] she said from the Western world and and
[1:04:36] I said yes I said that's true so it's
[1:04:39] getting that bad like if Jesus said to
[1:04:42] be no flesh saved
[1:04:43] how bad is it spiritually I'm deceiving
[1:04:46] is it sir brother and and even even to
[1:04:49] the message of the hour you know and oh
[1:04:51] my because again I've been thinking
[1:04:53] about it Lord how much longer much
[1:04:55] longer and the Lord showed me again
[1:04:58] within the last couple of days
[1:04:59] concerning another thought in the Word
[1:05:00] of God he says son he said for you it's
[1:05:03] for over fifty years but he said for me
[1:05:05] it's not very long it's only a few hours
[1:05:08] and then and I saw I said that's right
[1:05:10] Lord I said because one day one year
[1:05:13] with the Lord is one day as a thousand
[1:05:15] years a thousand years as one day and
[1:05:17] when it comes to with God we're looking
[1:05:20] at fifty years we look at a thousand
[1:05:22] years but God we look at one day a man
[1:05:24] and so we've gone for almost six days
[1:05:27] and again but the seventh seventh day
[1:05:30] which is again a seventh it's going to
[1:05:33] be the the be the millennial reign a man
[1:05:36] we're going to sit with him in his
[1:05:38] strong but again let's understand God's
[1:05:40] timing not ours a man for us we're in
[1:05:44] time we're subject to time and that's
[1:05:46] why that 50 odd years will seem like a
[1:05:48] long time but in the eyes of God it's
[1:05:50] not a man it's just for a few minutes I
[1:05:53] would say in in so let let's out let's
[1:05:56] be on our guard this be on our toes
[1:05:59] let's brother be instant in season out
[1:06:01] of season be spiritual amen
[1:06:03] if there's anything the Prophet is
[1:06:05] bringing out concerning doing God with a
[1:06:07] service without his will is having the
[1:06:09] anointing he said but it's not having
[1:06:10] the anointing where you ought to have
[1:06:12] and that's in your heart a man if you
[1:06:15] got it in your flesh but he said you
[1:06:16] don't have it in your heart
[1:06:17] a man let's make sure it's in our hearts
[1:06:20] let's make sure it's in ourselves
[1:06:21] because God is working on the end so
[1:06:23] where's the new creature the new crew
[1:06:25] not outside the new creatures inside a
[1:06:27] man the old this is the old creature
[1:06:29] born in sin a man is under the curse but
[1:06:33] God God made us new creatures in Christ
[1:06:35] were born again a man on the inside of
[1:06:39] the inside that's where the new nature
[1:06:40] is amen this is where God is is
[1:06:43] revealing his word this is where God is
[1:06:45] dealing with you dealing with me it's in
[1:06:47] our hearts and in our souls a man and
[1:06:49] then brother he to reflect out into our
[1:06:51] flesh and and is fighting your flesh a
[1:06:54] man sure you're fighting your flesh I
[1:06:56] know you are a man we're all fighting
[1:06:58] the flesh we're fighting this weakness
[1:07:00] of the flesh that weakness of the flesh
[1:07:01] but God has give us the strength we need
[1:07:03] to overcome a man help us to be more
[1:07:07] than conquerors in our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] so brother god help us and give us the
[1:07:13] grace we need in especially in this hour
[1:07:16] a man in this why this hour because it's
[1:07:20] more deceiving in this hour than any
[1:07:21] other age god help us amen
[1:07:25] let's believe make sure that when we're
[1:07:27] doing God a service do it according to
[1:07:29] his will a man oh but I got to the
[1:07:32] anointing that's right you can have the
[1:07:34] anointing but still it's in your flesh
[1:07:36] is it in your soul you got to come out
[1:07:39] and you got to live out of the soul
[1:07:41] there's too many living out of their
[1:07:43] flesh a man as they're proud of God said
[1:07:45] you're in the message but it's just a
[1:07:48] message in you amen
[1:07:51] that's the important thing there's a lot
[1:07:52] in the message a man around the world
[1:07:54] there's a lot in the message maybe even
[1:07:57] in Africa Amen a lot of the men message
[1:08:00] in the Western world but the message is
[1:08:02] not in depth
[1:08:03] definitely not I know that by their
[1:08:06] attitudes I know that by their motives
[1:08:08] and objectives amen amen
[1:08:10] as we went into the messages on all
[1:08:13] right yeah are you seeing it the way God
[1:08:14] sees that hearing it the way God hears a
[1:08:16] man a man that's in the soul but a lot
[1:08:19] of them are hearing it in their heads
[1:08:21] with their natural ears but not to hear
[1:08:24] of the soul amen god help us brother in
[1:08:27] the be in the spirit walk in the spirit
[1:08:29] live in the spirit amen
[1:08:31] sons and daughters of God walk in the
[1:08:33] spirit they live in the spirit amen
[1:08:36] and and they're really truly adopted
[1:08:39] a man not not outwardly inwardly a man
[1:08:43] I'm a son of God you're a son of God
[1:08:46] you're a daughter of God a man on the
[1:08:48] inside he meant by the grace of God God
[1:08:53] help us to get the revelation as we go a
[1:08:56] little further into the word amen in
[1:08:58] running my st. Mark's Gospel chapter
[1:09:01] three and verse 31 and to speak of the
[1:09:10] new relationship and it says there came
[1:09:14] then his brethren and his mother and
[1:09:18] standing without sent unto him calling
[1:09:21] him and the multitude sat about him and
[1:09:26] they said unto Him behold thy mother and
[1:09:30] thy brethren without seek thee and he
[1:09:33] answered them saying who is my mother or
[1:09:37] my brethren and he looked round about on
[1:09:42] them which sent about him and said
[1:09:46] Behold my mother and my brethren and
[1:09:50] brother we know that his natural family
[1:09:53] those that identified him they were they
[1:09:55] weren't really physically connected to
[1:09:58] him but but because they were born of
[1:10:01] Mary or someone that maybe others had
[1:10:04] Joseph might have had before he married
[1:10:06] Mary and so on but they were jealous a
[1:10:10] man they were certainly jealous of what
[1:10:13] Jesus was doing there and doing their
[1:10:15] and doing their but he wasn't doing her
[1:10:17] where they were and Annie and he rebuked
[1:10:20] them for their unbelief he reviewed them
[1:10:22] for their doubt and now he's rebuking
[1:10:25] their relationship or their claim and he
[1:10:29] looked around about on them which sat
[1:10:31] about him and said Behold my mother and
[1:10:33] my brethren for oh so ever shall do the
[1:10:37] will of God the same is my brother and
[1:10:41] my sister and mother a man so am i
[1:10:47] ministering to his brother his sister
[1:10:50] and his mother

[1:25:32] God for this revelation thank God for
[1:25:33] that revelation it's just it's just it

[1:26:07] any future it's just all now it's all
[1:26:09] present amen
[1:26:11] see that's like that's why Jesus was
[1:26:14] experiencing it when he was here
[1:26:17] a man in the Alpha ministry now the
[1:26:19] Omega ministry has given the bride that
[1:26:21] revelation amen
[1:26:22] so we're going beyond the past and
[1:26:24] future we're getting into present tense
[1:26:27] it's what God has done
[1:26:30] there's too many even around the message

[1:26:35] what has got what has God done what is
[1:26:37] God doing amen
[1:26:39] by the grace of God and that's why the
[1:26:41] devil knows his time is short because
[1:26:44] why he sees and knows what God is doing
[1:26:46] in the elect he sees that he knows what
[1:26:50] God is doing in the Bride of Christ he
[1:26:52] knows now that God did this God did that
[1:26:54] God did that and he was right there to
[1:26:57] challenge that faith the challenge what
[1:27:00] God was doing amen and that's why he
[1:27:02] made a denomination of it yo he made a
[1:27:05] denomination of this hell is that now
[1:27:06] that a man he got them he seemed a man
[1:27:11] not the elect but the Prophet aghast ER
[1:27:13] that third or fourth generation he said

[1:27:18] Methodists denominated the Lutheran's
[1:27:20] denominated the Pentecostals amen
[1:27:22] and it's a third or fourth generation on
[1:27:24] this message that's they started in to
[1:27:27] make denominations amen

[1:27:31] believe that amen brother you what you
[1:27:33] believe you live hey man
[1:27:37] it's not there's not basing your life on

[1:27:45] is doing seats he's doing it in need
[1:27:47] he's turning in you amen praise the Lord
[1:27:50] the devil knows that hey man he knows
[1:27:52] what he's doing and now they're gone

[1:28:29] Jesus in flesh of his bright amen
[1:28:31] he knew what Jesus was gonna do then old
[1:28:34] brothers sister and that's why he's
[1:28:36] tempted Jesus tempting Jesus amen and
[1:28:39] he's tempting the bride with this
[1:28:41] tempting the bride with that and he said
[1:28:43] oh they go go through there that day
[1:28:45] that temptation how he tempted Jesus
[1:28:47] back there in the air of a ministry and
[1:28:49] he's tempting the bride in the Omega
[1:28:51] ministry oh he said listen he said he
[1:28:55] said just speak the word and and do this

[1:29:38] kings and Lord of lords

[1:29:49] had the sacrifice he had to do this he
[1:29:51] had to lay down his life and Amy and he
[1:29:53] rebuked the devil and he knew he's going
[1:29:55] to inherit it Satan wants us to go the
[1:29:58] easy way

[1:46:55] was on his way he was on his way the kid
[1:46:57] too quick to condemn the Christians and
[1:46:59] maybe to have some Christians kill and

[1:48:04] this and questioned that wanted to go
[1:48:06] this one about that don't do this don't
[1:48:08] do that
[1:48:08] yeah the other disciples never interfere
[1:48:11] not even Judas you don't hear anything
[1:48:17] about Judas and not only that look at

[2:02:15] without his will as I said he preached
[2:02:17] it July in 1965 in in his in his own
[2:02:20] church but I said Lord that's funny seem
[2:02:24] like I remember other things in that
[2:02:25] message and that's when I discovered
[2:02:27] that he preached it in November just a
[2:02:31] short time before the Lord took him off
[2:02:32] the scene he preached it in November in
[2:02:35] brother Jack Norris Church in Shreveport
[2:02:37] Louisiana and he said a lot more here

[2:03:36] the will of God by the grace of God oh
[2:03:39] brother
[2:03:40] people don't consider it God's will only
[2:03:42] in only and believing this believe in
[2:03:44] that believe in something I know is the

[2:03:49] God for everyday living not my will
[2:03:52] father by thine be done it's not it's
[2:03:55] not just so why I believe this and I
[2:03:56] believe that no no it's like the Prophet
[2:03:58] said you're in the message but it's the
[2:03:59] message in you that's tremendous yeah so
[2:04:04] there are many that are in the message
[2:04:06] and they're doing God a service but not
[2:04:08] according to his will that is the
[2:04:10] absolute truth
[2:04:12] there's many a believer and brother I
[2:04:14] met many many many married over the
[2:04:17] years I would say I maybe had fellowship
[2:04:20] with hundreds and maybe thousands yeah
[2:04:23] in all that I admit in the last over 50
[2:04:26] years and Horne and oh yeah many were
[2:04:30] doing God a service but not according to
[2:04:32] his will God had mercy let's make sure
[2:04:39] that what you're doing is the will of
[2:04:40] God even like I said even to even do
[2:04:44] your job and even to your your your
[2:04:47] marriage and your family and your
[2:04:48] children oh yeah let's be doing the will
[2:04:53] of God
[2:04:55] not my real father don't be done sir he
[2:05:02] said for yet a little while and he that
[2:05:04] shall come will come no verse 36 for ye

[2:05:11] after year I've done the will of God he
[2:05:14] might receive the promise but you got ad
[2:05:18] patience I've done the will so let's
[2:05:21] wait on God let's keep doing his will
[2:05:24] and wait on the Lord what he does when
[2:05:27] he does and how he does it that's up to

[2:05:58] have no pleasure in him let's keep
[2:06:01] moving forward don't draw back in your
[2:06:03] stand for the truth no no don't draw
[2:06:07] back in your stand for the message don't
[2:06:09] draw back in your stand for the
[2:06:10] revelation of the resurrection of the
[2:06:12] rapture no no but we are not of them who
[2:06:17] draw back unto perdition but of them
[2:06:20] that believe to the saving of the soul
[2:06:23] amen why because we've done the will of
[2:06:27] God and we've had patience Holy Ghost
[2:06:31] patience amen
[2:06:34] waiting for the fulfillment of the
[2:06:36] promise we believe it and we're just
[2:06:39] waiting for God to do it needs time do
[2:06:42] it his way not my will time be done a
[2:06:45] man Lord Grace that I'm not doing you a
[2:06:48] service without your will but grace that
[2:06:51] I'm doing a service according to your
[2:06:53] will yeah honor the anointing of the
[2:06:55] Holy Ghost and you're doing it in God's
[2:06:57] time and in God's Way by the grace of
[2:07:00] God with God's attitude and God's Spirit
[2:07:02] by the grace of God amen this is
[2:07:05] tremendous brother so I believe I
[2:07:08] believe is
[2:07:09] and for God to lay down the prophets
[2:07:11] heart just before he was called home and
[2:07:15] especially the lad like I said the last
[2:07:17] one that he preached it was just a few
[2:07:20] maybe three weeks before the Lord took
[2:07:22] him and it's amazing too
[2:07:28] that you got believers who don't believe
[2:07:30] in cadet in communion but the last
[2:07:33] message that he preached was communion
[2:07:38] and really he didn't preach it he was in
[2:07:43] Tucson and brother Greene had preached
[2:07:46] and what did he do
[2:07:48] brother Greene asked brother Branham to
[2:07:50] come up and speak because I believe they
[2:07:53] serve communion they had communion at
[2:07:55] the time and he asked brother brother
[2:07:56] come up and speak so he brother Brad
[2:07:58] came up and spoke for not a few minutes
[2:08:00] concerning communion and he was
[2:08:03] exhorting the believers take communion
[2:08:07] stay with community and yet disbelievers
[2:08:10] feel that I don't have to take it
[2:08:11] because we got the word so we just
[2:08:12] commune with him through the revelation
[2:08:14] of the word no as like I said as long as
[2:08:18] we're in this flesh we need to take me
[2:08:21] yeah exactly it's pointing us to the
[2:08:24] redemption that is in our Lord Jesus
[2:08:26] Christ amen
[2:08:27] turn with me to one more scripture first
[2:08:30] John chapter 2 first John chapter 2
[2:08:44] familiar Scripture and let's begin to
[2:08:53] read from verse 15 love not the world if
[2:09:04] you love it you want to stay here but if
[2:09:09] you don't love the world you don't want
[2:09:10] to get it stay here that's right love
[2:09:15] the world neither the things that are in
[2:09:19] the world the things and people like the
[2:09:24] world they like the pattern of the world
[2:09:25] like the ways of the world
[2:09:27] not necessarily sinful things but
[2:09:30] they're just basically worldly you know
[2:09:32] the way the world lives and what the
[2:09:34] world does to entertain themselves and
[2:09:36] so on so he should love not the world
[2:09:39] neither the things that are in the world
[2:09:42] for if any man love the world the love
[2:09:45] of the father is not in him
[2:09:48] and there are many believers that love
[2:09:51] the world they're enjoying life you know
[2:09:56] they're do they like doing this they
[2:09:57] like doing that they like going here
[2:09:58] going there so on no no brother if you
[2:10:02] want to go anywhere you want to go home
[2:10:04] to glory you want to go to eternity
[2:10:07] more than you want to go anywhere else
[2:10:09] again nothing gates if you had to go
[2:10:12] somewhere to go but again you don't let
[2:10:14] that take Priam it's over your spiritual
[2:10:17] by the grace of God for all that is in
[2:10:22] the world the lust of the flesh and when
[2:10:27] it comes to the lusting of the flesh
[2:10:30] it's not necessary sexual know you can
[2:10:36] lost after natural things no you can
[2:10:40] lust after a vehicle you can lust after
[2:10:43] a house you can lost after clothes oh
[2:10:46] yeah
[2:10:47] you can lost after the natural things of
[2:10:50] life but too often people apply it to
[2:10:54] the the sexual and these things
[2:10:57] oh no the lust of the flesh the lust of
[2:11:02] the eyes the pride of life amazing the
[2:11:09] pride of life is not of the Father but
[2:11:12] is of the world it's what the world is
[2:11:16] putting the emphasis on amen they're
[2:11:19] living for this to live for there so but
[2:11:21] we're living for eternity
[2:11:26] I'll pass it away and the lusts thereof
[2:11:31] but he that doeth the will of God
[2:11:34] abideth forever hallelujah not my will
[2:11:40] father dying be done but let's be found
[2:11:43] doing the will of God doing God a
[2:11:46] service according to his will he that
[2:11:48] doeth the will of God abideth forever
[2:11:51] amen God's grace amen
[2:11:58] share with you a couple of quotes out of
[2:12:00] the message doing God asserted without
[2:12:05] his will that he ministered again again
[2:12:08] this was in the Jeffersonville July will
[2:12:11] get normally I thought I would finish it
[2:12:15] all today but we'll get the Lord willing
[2:12:18] to this on next somebody the Lord
[2:12:20] willing
[2:12:23] but in Jeffersonville heat then we
[2:12:25] finished with the couple of quotes I
[2:12:28] shared it with you before and brother
[2:12:31] family is of course I lightning David
[2:12:33] here and what David did to bring the Ark
[2:12:35] of the Covenant back to Israel and he
[2:12:37] said David consultant thousands captains
[2:12:44] of hundreds buddy city failed to ask the
[2:12:48] main resource that God always deals with
[2:12:51] the profit he failed to get it now he
[2:12:56] said his intention was good his motive
[2:13:00] was good his objective was good he said
[2:13:05] to bring a revival in the city and to
[2:13:08] bring the people back to God but he said
[2:13:11] he never consulted the way God told him
[2:13:14] to do it sir brother find the will of
[2:13:18] God for your life amen
[2:13:21] and even he
[2:13:23] all the people agreed and the priests
[2:13:26] and the king was right he said they
[2:13:29] needed the ark back in the city now he
[2:13:32] said they needed the presence of God
[2:13:34] they needed the revival but God had not
[2:13:36] promised to reveal the His Word in its
[2:13:39] season to the people's he never promised
[2:13:43] to reveal it to the King in the season
[2:13:45] and God doesn't change a bit he didn't
[2:13:48] promise to do that no matter how sincere
[2:13:50] and what God what good motives and good
[2:13:54] objectives and how people want those
[2:13:57] things and see the need of it there is a
[2:14:00] will of God to be carried out in these
[2:14:03] things you recognize the need well let's
[2:14:06] get it the way God wants us to get it
[2:14:08] and let's do it the way God wants us to
[2:14:11] do it he said my grace amen
[2:14:18] he saw what happened he said their
[2:14:21] religious emotions was great their
[2:14:26] intentions was great their crusade was
[2:14:31] great
[2:14:31] their singing was great their dancing
[2:14:35] was great he said their shouting was
[2:14:39] great he said their music was great and
[2:14:43] they had the Ark what's good the Ark
[2:14:47] without God he said it's just a wooden
[2:14:50] box couple tables of stone and he said
[2:14:55] that's like taking communion being
[2:14:57] baptized what good does it do to be
[2:15:00] baptized if you're not first repentant
[2:15:03] what you do you got to do it with the
[2:15:05] right attitude and the right spirit a
[2:15:07] repentant heart by the grace of God a
[2:15:10] man a man so we can experience all of
[2:15:16] these in our flesh and the emotions and
[2:15:19] the feelings in our flesh oh yeah and we
[2:15:21] can as I trust it was the Holy Ghost you
[2:15:24] know in our worship in the psalm service
[2:15:26] amen praise the name of the Lord but
[2:15:29] again there are others that do it and
[2:15:31] it's just flesh they're just caught up
[2:15:34] emotionally but
[2:15:36] I trust we're caught up by the holy
[2:15:38] ghost amen so that it's not you this
[2:15:41] singing is not you there's worse for me
[2:15:43] it's the Holy Ghost he's in control of
[2:15:46] you a man
[2:15:47] praise the name of the Lord so that's
[2:15:50] why the probably God's are you can have
[2:15:51] it in your flesh and he said but not in
[2:15:54] your soul amen so I trust our worship
[2:15:57] and our singing in our praise what is it
[2:16:00] it's coming out of our souls by the
[2:16:03] grace of God a man said like he said
[2:16:06] what goods they are or rather he said
[2:16:10] your intentions are good your emotions
[2:16:12] was great and he said the crusade was
[2:16:14] great singing was great dancing shouting
[2:16:17] music he says great but what good's the
[2:16:20] ark without God let's make sure that
[2:16:23] it's God motivating it on the inside of
[2:16:27] the inside make sure that we are
[2:16:31] repentant souls trusting the Lord amen
[2:16:42] he said don't miss this
[2:16:44] he said they failed to get it because
[2:16:47] they never had an consultant and by
[2:16:50] doing watch he said by going to the
[2:16:53] priest by going to the theologians by
[2:16:55] going to the military forces not even
[2:16:58] considering their God sent messenger of
[2:17:00] the hour Nathan they did it wrong they
[2:17:04] went and picked up the Ark and put it on
[2:17:06] a new cart put it up on the new cart he
[2:17:09] said or a new denomination to going to
[2:17:12] start up and not upon the God given
[2:17:15] ordained way to pack it it was supposed
[2:17:18] to be packed on the shoulders of the
[2:17:20] Levites but you see when you start wrong
[2:17:24] you keep going wrong you got to repent
[2:17:29] start again and do what's right see how
[2:17:34] serious it is oh my they've done a man
[2:17:37] has done it all the way down through why
[2:17:38] because God moves and then when God
[2:17:40] moves the devil move on see that's and
[2:17:44] brother we've been dealing with that
[2:17:46] right for right from the first church
[2:17:48] age
[2:17:50] God dealing with the first Church age
[2:17:52] God said but this thou has that eight
[2:17:56] thou eatest in deeds of the Nicolaitans
[2:17:59] which I also ate and the Nicolaitans was
[2:18:04] a spirit a denominational spirit that
[2:18:07] the enemy was bringing into the church
[2:18:09] in the first age and what was the
[2:18:12] Nicolaitans spirit conquer the laity but
[2:18:16] he would make a denomination just all
[2:18:19] just believe what what the well the
[2:18:23] priest was going to say just believe
[2:18:26] that whether or not it's the word
[2:18:28] believe it it's really me he turns it
[2:18:31] from the faith of a revival to that of a
[2:18:34] religion a man but the church the early
[2:18:38] church they stayed in in the spirit of
[2:18:40] the of the revival amen
[2:18:42] but the enemy came in with this
[2:18:44] religious spirit to make a denomination
[2:18:47] out of it a man he said I have somewhat
[2:18:52] against thee because thou has left thy
[2:18:55] first love a man and that spirit was was
[2:19:00] getting more and more influence in their
[2:19:01] lives a man and they were getting out of
[2:19:04] out of the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:06] into the leadership of the Hon Holy
[2:19:08] Ghost amen
[2:19:10] Satan was moving among them and it got
[2:19:12] worse and worse and worse until finally
[2:19:15] in the last age they put him out they
[2:19:20] put him out but he was on the outside
[2:19:23] knocking so he could tell us it with the
[2:19:25] individual in it do all I stand at the
[2:19:30] door knock and if any man will hear and
[2:19:32] open the door I'll come in a fellowship
[2:19:34] with him and he with me Amen brother
[2:19:38] the bride age and the bride revival but
[2:19:45] probably God and responding to what they
[2:19:48] were saying in that magazine praying for
[2:19:52] revival pray for revival he said brother
[2:19:54] they don't know the revival is over and
[2:19:56] now is to get into bright ready to going
[2:19:59] to go into the rapture
[2:20:01] yeah see they're not they don't didn't
[2:20:06] recognize the bride revival like the
[2:20:10] Pentecostal revival just people today
[2:20:13] looking for a revival like Luther Wesley
[2:20:15] panic Pentecost and like the early days
[2:20:18] of the of the this message no no he said
[2:20:21] now has changed oh yeah the Prophet said
[2:20:24] that yeah
[2:20:27] state he said they don't recognize the
[2:20:29] rebirth the bride revival amen
[2:20:32] god help us that we're not going to miss
[2:20:35] it brother listen what time are we
[2:20:40] living him what's the age what is the
[2:20:43] hour that we are living and he said it's
[2:20:47] not time for these things that they're
[2:20:50] talking about that's past he said
[2:20:54] judgment is on hand now and you can see
[2:20:57] it breaking you remember the rock up on
[2:21:00] the mountain it is judgment our issue to
[2:21:05] remember he said the revelation or the
[2:21:07] vision of the bride just keep her in
[2:21:09] step don't let her get out of step
[2:21:14] but he said notice influence sometimes
[2:21:17] great guys get together and he said you
[2:21:22] hear them say so and so great so and so
[2:21:26] don't never do that there's no great
[2:21:28] ones among us and he said there's only
[2:21:31] one great one and that's God and he said
[2:21:34] we are brothers and sisters and he said
[2:21:37] I don't care if you're a pastor of a
[2:21:39] church that's got five people in it he
[2:21:41] said that don't make you little praise
[2:21:45] the Lord amen he said that don't he said
[2:21:52] that don't make that's got five people
[2:21:54] on that don't make you little he said
[2:21:57] that makes you a brother and he said
[2:21:59] you're true to God's Word I don't care
[2:22:01] how he said you won't get little he said
[2:22:04] God don't have little children and big
[2:22:07] children he just as children and they're
[2:22:10] all the same thank God
[2:22:13] brother he said he said the pastor
[2:22:16] strips had to the pulpit he said err
[2:22:17] he's a pastor and it's God ministering
[2:22:20] to you through the minister to the
[2:22:21] pastor and you're being judged by the
[2:22:23] world but he said when he stepped on the
[2:22:25] pulpit he's your brother amen praise the
[2:22:29] Lord he said we're in the last days were
[2:22:35] standing near the judgment why he said
[2:22:39] they're trying to eat old manna that
[2:22:40] fell back yonder fifty years ago he said
[2:22:43] the Pentecostal church he said the
[2:22:46] Holiness Church is trying over two
[2:22:48] hundred years ago the Lutheran's about
[2:22:50] three or four hundred more hundred years
[2:22:52] ago he said they're trying to eat old
[2:22:54] mana but he said he said that stuff is
[2:22:57] stagnated it's contaminated he's to find
[2:23:01] out if David or any of the rest of them
[2:23:03] he said would only consult the bread of
[2:23:05] the hour he said but now he said it
[2:23:08] won't do them no good he said had done
[2:23:11] moved out they won't help a bit she's
[2:23:13] gone she's crossed that line about five
[2:23:17] years ago between repentance judgment
[2:23:20] and mercy if his five years ago she
[2:23:23] crossed the line around 1960 between
[2:23:27] mercy and judgment a man why because
[2:23:31] they turned down the messenger and the
[2:23:33] message amen so how God was moving to
[2:23:37] catch the bride and to give her a
[2:23:39] rapture in fate
[2:23:40] oh yeah like I said I've witnessed it
[2:23:44] but I've witnessed over the last 50
[2:23:47] years fifty-five years and more because
[2:23:49] I remember go back into the into this 63
[2:23:53] 64 65 I don't remember a name with the
[2:23:56] Prophet then but like I said I was I was
[2:23:59] in Pentecost
[2:24:00] I was I was identified with the
[2:24:03] Salvation Army depending coughs the
[2:24:05] church I was baptized in Pentecost and
[2:24:07] so on and it was not until 66 that I
[2:24:11] came to the message and I heard about
[2:24:13] the Prophet that was in June or July of
[2:24:16] 1966 when we got out of the school in
[2:24:22] here and we would always go back to my
[2:24:24] hometown for summer holidays
[2:24:27] and I remember getting back there and I
[2:24:31] remember we were staying at the time in
[2:24:33] my grandfather lost his house and I
[2:24:35] remember going into the hallway I'm
[2:24:37] picking up the phone and had the old
[2:24:39] phone and the dial and I called sister
[2:24:42] Goldie on the phone and I said Lord

[2:25:12] said brother he said she said

[2:25:16] age and she said it's brother William
[2:25:19] Branham oh I see well praise the Lord I
[2:25:23] said well brother she said it's good she

[2:25:32] interchange I said thank you and I got
[2:25:35] the book and read it
[2:25:36] amen and it was just a few days later
[2:25:40] that brother Manuel came out and we had
[2:25:46] a cottage meeting and he played a tape
[2:25:48] believe it or not it had to do with the
[2:25:50] original sin and that would be a hard
[2:25:54] tape from to play for a lot of people
[2:25:57] but to me oh I said that's right I said
[2:26:01] that's the word I said thank you Lord a
[2:26:04] man now from there on of course we got
[2:26:07] more and more into the message and it

[2:27:08] things just this way dancing by rock and
[2:27:11] roll and calling themselves the church
[2:27:13] and you say well we don't do that that's
[2:27:16] the way God sees you it ain't what you
[2:27:19] see yourself it's the way God sees you
[2:27:22] he said no man sees himself wrong amen

[2:28:07] time results so is that what we're
[2:28:10] seeing in this church evening time
[2:28:12] results end time results amen
[2:28:16] now I'm like what Luther had or Wesley
[2:28:18] or the Pentecostals but this is the end
[2:28:20] time
[2:28:21] amen there was this profit that profit
[2:28:25] that profit but then they came the God
[2:28:27] property in Christ oh yeah and there and
[2:28:33] they saw the results of these ministry
[2:28:34] that God profit oh yeah it was different
[2:28:38] yeah they thought that he would come and
[2:28:41] he would he would died like oh maybe all
[2:28:43] the rest of the profits and all just
[2:28:45] wonderful what a wonderful ministry but
[2:28:47] no he got to the place where as a
[2:28:50] prophet
[2:28:51] in this hour he had the first poll he
[2:28:53] had a second poll then he stopped and
[2:28:55] the third poll wasn't exactly what they
[2:28:58] expected wasn't what they expected it
[2:29:01] was what Jesus expected the same thing
[2:29:05] in this hour the first pool the second
[2:29:07] poll and they wanted brother branham to
[2:29:09] continue on with the first and second
[2:29:11] the first and second and but the angel
[2:29:13] told him to stop using it stop using it
[2:29:17] he said because the people are leaning
[2:29:18] on a signpost
[2:29:20] but the signpost is pointing to that's
[2:29:25] like I said coming into st. John's Oh
[2:29:27] st. John's so many kilometres so you

[2:30:06] we've done there was a certain Luther
[2:30:08] signpost but you keep going there
[2:30:11] Wesley's Pentecostal and all others that
[2:30:14] God use they were signpost getting
[2:30:16] closer to the end and I finally st. John

[2:30:28] the resurrection rapture
[2:30:29] praise the Lord how many really believe
[2:30:35] that we've come to the resurrection
[2:30:36] rapture it was
[2:30:42] arts expressed concern your revival I
[2:30:47] want to share those thoughts are some
[2:30:49] thoughts with you regarding what the
[2:30:51] Prophet said concerning revival don't
[2:30:54] get caught up with man's idea of revival
[2:30:57] what is God's idea of revival man's idea
[2:31:04] Wow Wow well well well
[2:31:06] God's ideas Lord revival yes my son is a
[2:31:13] revival amen well it's what God is doing
[2:31:17] inside not outside hey man God I'll
[2:31:24] share with you some quotes the prophet
[2:31:26] has mentioned concerning revival in time
[2:31:29] rebuy so it's even
[2:31:34] I'm seed and he said the beginning
[2:31:36] message showed that the beginning result
[2:31:39] made creation he made his son his own in
[2:31:42] his own image in the midday and in the
[2:31:45] evening time he makes a bride for it and
[2:31:49] it's done by his word how did he form
[2:31:53] the earth how did he speak it into
[2:31:56] existence by his word in the beginning
[2:32:00] was the word the Word was with God and
[2:32:02] the Word was God and the Word was made
[2:32:04] flesh and dwell among us how will he
[2:32:07] take his bride by the word not by a new
[2:32:10] current not by some theologians idea but
[2:32:14] according to the word he identify the
[2:32:17] bride don't put one thing to it or take
[2:32:20] one thing from it he said leave it the
[2:32:23] way it is Easter the evening time a man
[2:32:27] he said he promised the opening of the
[2:32:30] seven seals and he showed what them
[2:32:33] churches had missed back there
[2:32:35] he said revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 17
[2:32:40] 30 and he said he would do it so let's
[2:32:42] not mix it up let's keep it right like
[2:32:47] that the word Amen let's do God a
[2:32:51] service according to his will and what
[2:32:53] is his will it's the revealed word for
[2:32:56] this hour for this age let's make sure
[2:32:58] your life is lining up with the word the
[2:33:01] word the message of the hour the
[2:33:04] resurrection the rapture lining up a man
[2:33:07] so you're they look at your oh you're
[2:33:10] Pentecostal know we're bright we're in
[2:33:15] time bright where we are Lutheran's we
[2:33:18] are Methodists we are Pentecostals and
[2:33:20] we are this and that but bring it
[2:33:24] together and why did what what does God
[2:33:26] see it's the bright that's looking for
[2:33:29] the rapture Luther was looking for
[2:33:32] justification the Pentecostals they're
[2:33:34] looking for more nineteen in their lives
[2:33:36] and and and the baptism of the Holy
[2:33:38] Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit and
[2:33:40] that's what they got they're hung in and
[2:33:42] thirsty for what God wanted to do but
[2:33:44] now the prophet of God said the Lord
[2:33:47] sends the whole
[2:33:47] spirit ahead to create in the hearts of
[2:33:50] the people a hunger and thirst for what
[2:33:53] he wants to do and what does he want to
[2:33:55] do now it's the resurrection rapture
[2:33:58] so God by the word is creating a hunger
[2:34:00] and thirst for the resurrection rapture
[2:34:02] in our hearts amen
