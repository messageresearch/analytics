we could live the life heavenly father lord that you just didn't take us out of the debtors prison lord out of the pawn shop lord but you may our lives have a purpose lord you gave us a way to achieve lord what we couldn't achieve before lord though our hearts maybe would yearn for you our minds would lean towards you lord yet we found they were incapable of serving you in the way that you needed lord and so you came and you paid a great price lord and you've restored a way and you've restored a people and you've restored a power and you've restored a life lord you've restored the fellowship you've restored everything that we have need of to live this life lord the way that you want us to live it lord we're so thankful for that love that you've given lord may that just flow out tonight lord from this pope and lord as your word is preached lord may it just minister to each heart and soul that's here lord for those that are online lord we pray your grace to them as well heavenly father lord meet us here we pray now in jesus christ's name we ask it amen and then god bless you if you turn in your scriptures to gen or revelation chapter five ignore what's on the screen that's for me not for you but amen turn to revelation chapter five certainly good to be back in the house of the lord another beautiful not so beautiful day turned into a beautiful day and then certainly i'm enjoying the nicer weather and then certainly enjoyed the service on wednesday that or on sunday that brother aaron preached i love what he said operate from the dominion in you that has been restored amen that was a wonderful thought that he took on the hunger or the nature of hunger amen just before we go i've got a quick retraction here i said last service i was speaking of noah and i said he was just like all of the rest of them and then god called him out and that's true for all of us in a sense but if i'd have read one one scripture lower it said these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god so uh i talked to most of you after service but certainly for those online if they heard me say that just let me correct that i was confusing it with what he said with abraham and this is directly what the prophet said he said as they came down in this land and all the people there was everywhere abraham wasn't any better than anyone else he said but god by sovereign grace and election called abraham according to election he says that's it nothing was said that abraham was any better didn't even say he was a believer in the beginning but god with his unmerited grace abraham was saved and not only was he saved but when god called abraham he saved him and gave him his covenant unconditionally and that's kind of what i was pointing to i got a little mixed up here but you want to make sure that you correct that because especially for those online they could hear that and and you could see some error there so just wanted to set that straight before we continue this evening amen in revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and it says and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now listen to this answer he says and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on not even worthy to look on it couldn't open it but even if it was open they wouldn't have even been able to look on it there was a worthiness required to even look on this thing no man that was alive dead that was to come that had been in the past none of them was worthy to open or look on this book and john says and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now watch he says what the lion of the tribe of judah but what comes out in verse six says and i behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain here's the line of the tribe of judah coming forth having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of voters which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and every tongue and people and nation amen i'm so glad he did that amen that he didn't just redeem one people of one color or one language or tongue any place one particular family but he said that every one of his children will be brought in from all of the earth amen amen what they've been separated from the presence of god but now he was gathering them all back into his presence amen and verse 10 says and he hast made us unto our god kings and priests that's a finished work that's a finished work right there he says he has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth that's our full position full authority full dominion full purpose for relationship with god all restored amen you can have your seats this evening may god bless the reading of his word and then we want to continue on our little series of in his form and with his mind and last time we kind of finished at a bit of a dark spot because we spoke of the fall of the minds of men and how they became a to a place where they were only evil continually thought of in their hearts and in their minds but we finished it where we came brother branham says that there was one that came after all of that who lived his life by every word that was written amen that was the perfect sacrifice it was holy it was sinless it was spotless and god accepted that price that christ paid on the crops of calvary amen and that was a total and complete payment for sin there's no other thing you can do now there's nothing before and there's nothing you could do after it was a total and complete payment for sin that was made there and the prophet of god said we believe that all these great benefits that we enjoy today in this christian economy we have were all purchased at calvary by the son of god jesus christ we believe that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed he says it's all a past tense it's a finished work it's something that god has done for us at calvary and as christians we have the right to enjoy these blessings that he has purchased for us so when somebody says it's not for you it's not for your family you've gone too far you don't come from the right background you haven't sown the right seeds you haven't made the right sacrifices say the price is paid there's nothing i can do to warrant this so don't try and tell me i have to match up to something because it's a grace gift that was given to us because we couldn't do anything in the first place he says as christians we have the right to enjoy these blessings that he has purchased for us so therefore no man could save another if it would have been so jesus would not have had to die he says but when jesus died at calvary he settled the sin question forever and every man every creature on earth when he died was saved at that very minute so when we come and we give our hearts to god when we come up and we repent at an altar we're at camp wherever it might be and we give our hearts to the lord we say that's where we were saved that's not where we were saved that's where we recognized that we were saved at the very beginning that we were saved when he gave his life to calvary that we were a part of him before the world ever began that's our recognition but the work was done way before we ever realized it he says the price was paid completely it was so met that god identified that it was true now the only thing we have to do to receive this is to believe it and accept it he says but no matter how much that he died for our salvation we must ourself accept it as our own personal experience our own desire daddy can't put it in you mama can't put it in you they can't guilt-trip you into it they can't what put an atmosphere in the house that makes you want this it has to come from within there has to be something inside a deep calling to the deep a sea gene of god inside of you that calls out for that and guess what it may not be activated until you're 17. you can sit in this church like i did maybe until 10 or 11 and not feel the thing but all of a sudden god starts to talk to you and that's when you know that there's a deep calling to the deep and life's easier when you give in early you enjoy life so much better i remember when i before i got saved i put it off because i said i don't know if i'll like it that sounds funny but as an 11 year old that's something you want to consider is will i enjoy it if i give my life to christ but the thing is there was already a poll there there was already a deep calling to the deep so guess what i'd never be happy no matter what anyways i was already getting miserable so i'm saying will i be more or less miserable as a believer if i give in to what i want right now when i gave in believe me life got a whole lot better and guess what because i desired it when i came into it i liked it and we're going to get into that maybe a little bit later on but he says we must want to be saved and believe that upon the basis of his shed blood that we are saved after we have met the requirements of the bible we talked last time about how we lost fellowship we lost dominion and we lost eternal life but our prophet points us to calvary he says at this moment he says the same question was settled forever so now you have access potentially to everything that you lost at eden there's nothing held back because why the price is paid something had to be paid and when that price was paid then you don't have to worry about it anymore now i've drawn this out before i didn't have time to put it in my in my slides but you remember when brother brown talked about he said the truth of justification this is a if this is your bank account right and it has my name at the top and when you have it you have what's you have debits and you have credits in your bank account see now what some people say and then we have a description over here right so what we'd say here is there's sin here and that's what that's a debit and that's a really big number right let's put a billion dollars because i'll never have a billion dollars in my life but that's a debit that means that i what i'll never pay that i'll never pay that now what people have decided so many times and they misunderstand is that when christ came he did this and he did what a million dollar or a billion dollars and so you have what you have a debit and you have a credit if you take the two of those together they add up what to zero they say that's what christ did at calvary but the prophet says no that's not just what he did so then they say well all right we forgot so it's cast into the sea of forgetfulness so we block it out so you can't read it anymore and they say that's what christ did at calvary amen prophet said no no no that's not what he did he says what he says true justification is not that it says because he starts and he says it's as if you never did it by the end of his ministry what does he say you never did it because what any forensic accountant that comes in and he sees this thing and it's blocked off he's going to say like satan does there was something there you did something john curlett you did something i can see the mark there and he says no he can't even see the mark there because you didn't do it in the first place so all he sees is what you got everything you need to claim every piece of property that christ has redeemed back for you all he sees is a billion dollars of credit that you can buy whatever you need them the price is paid and all you're saying is you're saying that's for me that's for me that's for me that's for me because all you have is credit to your account you've got an unlimited bank account amen so don't look at it and say well it's just been a race or it's just been set aside and and what no no no he says you didn't do it in the first place there is no record that satan can find because if he would he'd show it but there's no record left for you anymore so all you have is a credit card you have a credit card you have a checking account linked to what the bank of heaven for every believe every promise in the book that he gave at calvary amen everything that he restored back is for you because all you have is credits in your account there's no debits anymore it's always credit it's always credit it's always credit it's not you phil in the bank it's him filling the bank brother brown says the only question is what will you write on that check that's all you've got left to figure out amen amen but so often what it is is we look at this this thing that happened at calvary and because it happened in the past we say well my sins in the past were covered under that but then we do something today and what do we do we start to act like catholics and we try and beat ourselves up don't we now we're supposed to repent in the church age book the prophet of god said that the zeal are the ages to repent you've got to repent and that means you've got to be sincere and you've got to be sorrowful but to repent doesn't mean lord i'm sorry i did it and then go do it again the next day he says true repentance does what says lord i'm sorry and then it walks away and says i won't do that again by your grace i won't come around tomorrow and ask forgiveness for the same thing because i'll have walked away from what it was that brought me into repentance in the first place amen we're walking in a different direction like i said last time so often what we're trying to cover with repentance ought to be dealt with by deliverance because we're just going around and around in a circle we're going around and around the mountain like brother joe preached on and we're coming back to the same trial the same issue the same ism the same complex whatever it is time and time and time again no that's not what we're looking for we need deliverance in those cases not just repentance amen but i've said it before that what as we get more mature as we grow as believers then i feel what we're getting and we're not so much worried about the books we read and the music that we have and the movies that we watch because that's been dealt with that ought not to even be there really at this point and what we're dealing with now is what attitudes responses the first thought that comes to your mind what it is that you're suppressing so often rather than what's flowing out of you because if your first act is two is to what suppress rather than project then you're missing something aren't you because we're supposed to be what acting from the overflow right we're supposed to be acting from the overflow here so if our our first reaction is to what is to try and beat somebody up verbally then guess what there's not an overflow there and that's what we really need to resolve and that's really what the christians i find the mature christians are dealing with now yes we still trip up i'm not saying we don't but i'm saying we're acting what we're now we're getting into the idea of the attitude and the mind of christ itself not just do i do this or don't i do this but now we're talking about responses now we're talking about the way that we react to things and the first reaction rather than the last reaction amen those sorts of things now and then we're going away from not just doing the right thing but doing the right thing for the right reason right up front not having like i said it to be the last thing we come to but it's the first response that we have but we've been looking at this idea of the restoration to our eden kingdom and we know that pentecost was not a full restoration it was perfect for a short time but then they did what they left their first love so we've got to re-restore back to what they were but then we've got to continue on in the way that they didn't continue on with because that was what it was supposed to do it was supposed to take us to the rapture god in his infinite window wisdom knowing the end from the beginning could see what was going to happen so he predestined us through what seven church ages right but they fell and now we got to come up but we don't stop when we get to pentecost do we we got to keep going on as if the as if what we're going all the way to eternity because that's our purpose here it's to be an overcomer it's to sit with him on his throne it's to take us all the way into eternity amen they were perfect for a short time but they didn't hold on to it they left their first love now we looked at that fallen eden and we know eternal life was lost lost immediately because as soon as they sinned fear set in that's when they lost what they lost that love of god because love casts out all fear amen and then what happened was what it put a fear in them to be in the presence of god now eternal no eternal life is what living in the presence of god eternal life is living with god and the first thing it did was that it caused them to run away from the presence of god right so let me tell you if you're running away from the conviction of the holy spirit if you're running away from the fellowship of the saints if you're running away from church attendance if you're running away from the preaching of the word then what waits for you death fear is driving you because what you're worried of the effect it will have on you and it's death that awaits you because you're getting out of the presence of god so you're giving satan room to work and you're not giving god any time to do what he needs to do in your life right and we see this with god and cain because when when we come to those places what is it that's waiting for us it says what sin awaits at the door that's what's driving this is unbelief is what's pulling us away because if we believed that it would have the good effect that it's supposed to then we'd run to there remember brother braham says adam should have been screaming god god father where are you i messed up and he said he says it's god saying adam where are you at how come you're not ready to meet me again this evening right look what he said to cain because guess what cut god did not judge cain for his imperfect sacrifice no you come with the wrong thing god doesn't say boom down dead away with him away with her she didn't get it right he didn't get it right the first time what did god judge came for refusing to do it when god told him plainly what to do if you look here when he's talking to cain he says if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted now cain was the son of the serpent and god says you can still be accepted if you do what i tell you to do he says and if thou doest not well sin life at the door he says the only reason you won't do it is because you disbelieve for whatever reason you disbelieve brother branham said it this way he says when truth of the word of god is brought face to face with us human beings we are prone to shirk back until the last resource what a life we live if we flipped it around and said that what that we are prone when we are faced with the word of god to what run to it as our first resource to lay hold of that and say i'm gonna try that first rather than my own intellect rather than my own strength rather than my own education rather than all the things that i have to offer i'm gonna run to the word first and let's see how that does not as our last resort but as our first resource why because it's been proven in our life scripture says taste and see that the lord is good give it a try and let him let him have a chance to actually prove it to you one or two times amen listen a child of god will always come around you might have to go around the mountain a couple times but eventually god will get you where he needs you to but the idea is to get there first the first time don't waste your time don't don't waste his and then he can start to use you and progress you and mature you into your kingdom position amen when you see god blessing someone we ought to ask ourselves what do they have that i don't because it's not necessarily that they have what great gifts great physical presence some of the greatest preachers in the message are like four foot two right they don't win us over with their imposing physicality or their great booming voices or anything like that right but what is it they've come to a place of consequence and sanctification in their life where they've given so much to god that he trusts to use them with great gifts and listen that's not limited to ministry that's limited to each and every one of us we all have to have a prayer closet we all have to have a what a devotions life we all have to have a place where we meet god and our spouse isn't there and our children aren't there and we've got a way to talk to god one-on-one we've got to have that because that's where god's going to deal with us it's great to have anointed services but when's the last time we had that anointed service in our prayer closet amen when you're driving in your car when you're listening to a message when you're streaming another service when god drops down and he touches you and he places you and he pushes you towards a decision so that you know where you need to go it doesn't always happen here two days a week for a couple of hours isn't enough you got 24 hours a day for another five and a half days six days of the week he's got a lot of time to work with you if you'll give him a place to do it amen what did paul say he said we deserve we should desire what kind of gifts carnal financial he said spiritual he says desire the best spiritual gifts for yourself no for others because the gifts are given for the edification of the body amen it's for other people it's to meet the needs of the body not just to meet your need he says that's what you ought to be to the place in is where you're not just asking him to meet your daily needs but he's asking you're asking him lord can i how can i help the rest of the kingdom how can i help the rest of your children how can i help my local body what can i do that's going to further the kingdom above and beyond my own life amen now after adam and eve lost eternal life dominion was lost because we know the man was cursed to have to work to make ends meet on earth and then the final thing they lost was fellowship with god because he pronounced judgment and then he pushed them out of his presence and the angels drove them out and there was a flaming sword there now notice this they couldn't come to him they couldn't come to him the way was guarded right they couldn't come to the tree of life anymore but that doesn't mean the tree of life couldn't come to them because we see it time and time again you'll see it in noah that's the first place we see it as noah right noah found grace in the eyes of god and god comes down he talks to noah noah couldn't go to god but god could come down to noah and then he did what to abraham he he came down and he talked to him he says i'm going to make you a great nation who am i lord who are you by the way right brother braham says as far as we know abraham wasn't anything prior to god calling him he wasn't a believer he wasn't anything he was just a guy walking around living with a bunch of idol worshipers there's nothing there right we see it with david god came and talked to him we see him come down and talk to the prophet samuel he could come down and yes you could pray out to him but there was no there was no way you could enter into the presence of god of your own free will it wasn't allowed god said you can't do it anymore that's not allowed anymore you can have that directness of fellowship and so what we had as i just put this together very quickly was we had a veil we had a barrier between mankind and god and you see the yellow arrow there the the bright yellow arrow is god and god can come back and forth and that's his own free will that's his sovereign grace that does that he can come down at any time and touch you and then go back to eternity but when man comes up he keeps hitting up against that barrier because he can't cross that because sin was blocking him out he couldn't come back there so on the inner and outer courts what you're justified and sanctified but there's no perfection there and it's a perfection is required to go in you have to be perfect to stand in the light of perfection amen but in his presence there's perfection and fellowship and there's eternal life so man keeps trying to get in there but there's a veil there that he can't pass through there's only one thing that can pass you through that veil and that's blood as we know right amen so there is no possibility to continually dwell in the presence of god we can do that today we can continually dwell in the presence of god today but back then under the law under the the blood of bulls and goats they could not come into the presence of god any time they want you know who could one man once a year for a very short period of time could walk into the shekinah glory of god and spend a little bit of time there and what was he doing he'd go in with blood for himself to cover his sins and if god accepted that then he'd come right back out and he'd get more blood and he'd go in for the sins of the people he didn't get a fellowship in there he didn't get this warm fuzzy feeling necessarily perhaps he was going in what fearfully because if god judged him then there was nobody else to go in for the people so he was going in humbly with his head down holding that blood to pour on the mercy seat so that his sins would be covered and then he's coming in with more blood to do that afterwards for the people and then what the blood the sin was covered it wasn't done away with it was kind of like we had here where it was what it was there but it was just what it was pushed over it wasn't paid for it was just covered up for a little bit god couldn't see it under the blood and guess what women could never experience the shekinah presence of god in that way to go into the temple behind the veil into the holy holies women were excluded from that guess what only one priest a year was allowed in there you couldn't have physical flaws right you couldn't have a mole on your face you couldn't have a misshapen nose you couldn't have one leg shorter than the other right you had to come from a certain family the tribe of levi and then you had to by luck get chosen to be the high priest for that year so one man out of the millions of israelites got to go into this kind of presence of god and only for the briefest of moments and then he came out and then all it was was what ritual now god could come down and bless them but you couldn't go to him you could pray but that's it there was no guarantee that you were going to break into the presence of god it would only be if he would come down amongst you amen we know from eden that death is separation from god right that's what brother brown would say he said what death is just what separation from god when you're in hell it's what separation from god when you look at at the parable of you know the beggar and that man and there was what a a great distance between them it was a separation between the presence of god the bosom of abraham they called it and that man right that was death was that he couldn't be in the presence of god amen but how could you ever expect under this kind of condition to have eternal life because you couldn't be in the presence of god only one man got it for a very short period every year the rest of us were excluded from it and god forbid that you even think about being a gentile in this dispensation because you weren't even in there no you were you were toast under this one it was only the jews that had the potential blood and it was only one jew out of all of them that got to go into the presence of god amen but what happened christ comes down and he date and he gives his life on a cross and all of a sudden we see what happens and we see a veil that's about to be torn but i want to read that and just go through it for a little bit this evening now matthew 27 it says jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when i think of that i have that picture of the the temple and the veil being torn from top to bottom it kind of reminds me of superman comics now i know none of you have ever looked at comics as young people but in the superman comics he always wears civilian clothes over his his special superman costume right and what does he do is when there's an emergency what's he do he rips the clothes off and reveals himself as a great superman and then he goes and he saves the day the damsel in distress and these different things guess what we needed a superman and we needed a revealing of that superman a superman that wouldn't be touched by what satan's satan's tricks that he would be impervious to satan's arguments right that trials and temptations that came up would not push him off of the word of god that he could take whatever was thrown at him and stay exactly in his position like adam did and should have all the way to the end right but what he came down this superman and he died on a cross for us amen and when he did that he took all of our blame on him and we've talked about that before how this is a man that had never felt any shame he never felt any any dis a any any uh of the follow-up that comes with doing things wrong amen a believer when he does things wrong you feel sick inside don't you and you feel heavy and you're sore full he had never felt that before and all of it from all of us dropped onto his shoulders at that one moment and he gave his life for us there but we see what happened here in matthew 27 it says that what the earth quaked and the rocks rent and i read this before but i want to bring it out again and certainly for the visitors here it'll be new to them because so often brother branham frames this as a sorrowful scene when he talks about the great earthquake and the rock splitting open and all these different things but in 1964 at the end of 64 he says it a different way he says and when the great shepherd was smitten the great sheep prophet when he was sweating back there he said it is finished and at that moment as soon as his shepherd was smitten it was over he says sin is settled there was no more sin they were clean the penalty was paid the believers whose names were written in the book of life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished that very minute that jesus said it was finished he that great shepherd had come for his sheep it was finished and god's right hand was pulled from his bosom smitten he says but then on easter he returned it amen and raised it up again to his bosom and extended it down to you and i in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original garden from which sin took us the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet shepherd no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit its face and screamed for joy he says no wonder all nature broke loose the wind shook the trees until they shook and shook and joyed and jumped they seen the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on the book of life and they seen that what their own nature was redeemed he says they screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake the mountains rent and the rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything taken place the mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place he says it twice but listen to what he says but there was nobody hurt amen in sorrow and pain things tend to get hurt but he says under these conditions he says nobody got hurt in fact people came to life under this amen nature itself was bearing very what witness of this redemption event and they were rejoicing in it for 4 000 years they've been falling fall and falling and all of a sudden they saw somebody in one moment took them all the way back to their original place that what there was a way made now that there wasn't before that there was a place coming back for the believer and for nature itself that they couldn't have even thought about before they've been looking for it they've been dreaming about it they've been praying for it and nothing had happened then in one moment they saw everything come back came and they knew that what this was the start of the manifestation of the sons of god and this was part of the restoration of the earth back to its original condition amen amen what was it joy was bursting out believe me they cried when he died i believe that there was sorrow at the price that was paid but there was joy at what that meant when it was paid amen and the effect that it was going to have on all of us amen so what did he do when he died what did god do he tore the veil and what was that it was restoring fellowship wasn't it and guess what god didn't go around the earth and just say hey you can come talk to me now he didn't just go from one to the another he didn't whisper it to his chosen people did he because it says what god so loved the world god loves life amen god loves humanity god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and so what did he do he did something very public he didn't just go around whispering to the elect but in plain view he showed every one of them that what there's something that's happened you don't have to come through a priest now you don't have to come through a man now to come into my presence i'm not just limited to one man a year from a select family from a select tribe and from a priesthood that's imperfect physicality and these different things but he says now anybody can see in to this holy of holies amen amen listen this veil took 300 priests to carry it and wash it when it got dirty that's how big and heavy it was and it had these fine fabrics with with beautiful stitching on these things with overlapping panels as we've talked about before and then over top of it what did you have you had badger skins over top of it and it was virtually soundproof they say once you got in there the heaviness of the drapes and then those badger skins just would absorb sound and they go from the ceiling all the way down to the floor and they cross everything off close everything off from the world amen but what do those badger skins represent why would they put that on there why not just have the fancy you know fabrics and the gold stitching and all the the purples and the and the reds and these different things why did why did they throw the badger skins on it if anybody knows anything about badgers they're the meanest animals alive that and a wolverine wolverine is kind of our badger in north america i think but brother says this he says notice that old veil that hid the glory the old badger skins there was no beauty to be desired of it neither was his flesh that's the reason people said a little old stoop over fellow like that probably 30 years old and gray his beard was gray wasn't much to look at the bible said there's no beauty that we should desire him he didn't look like a king that old badger skin but oh what was on the inside that's why we don't dress up our gospel the way churches are these days that's why we don't cater to the world the way that they are and dress it up with their music and their clothes and get hip and me stand up here and a pair of blue jeans and a and a 800 belt and five thousand dollar sneakers and a and some sort of crazy haircut and all this stuff we're not trying to do what give them what they already have that's antichrist if they're drawn to what looks like them then that's going to be an antichrist gospel but what there's going to be badger skins over it it's not going to maybe look so great but when you get past that you're going to see that there's something of great value behind it amen listen what he says he says and a little bunch of holy rollers sitting together in a hot building like this they call them not much beauty to be desired but what's on the inside that's right that's what we have sitting here maybe they wouldn't look at us and say that's something i really want but when they get on the inside and they see what's happening in here and the effect it has on their lives then you start to say they got something that my church doesn't have they got something that people that call themselves christians don't have that i know he says i'm sure it's veiled for many hearts you see all right he says outwardly it was nothing but all was on the inside once inside of it then you see it how do you get into it shaking hands joining he says no you're born into it dying getting rid of your old badger skin see your old self to get into a new one see forsake the old badger skin we're fighting that badger skin every single day aren't we i like what brother aaron said it's not perfected yet he'll redeem it he's going to glorify it but in this condition we're going to be fighting that badger skin every day and it takes god's grace not only for us but it's going to take god's grace for the person that's looking at us to look past that to look long enough to see that there's something bigger than what's what i'm seeing on that badger skinny man listen it's still a battle to get into the presence of god i said we can live there 24 7. we are already seated in heavenly places in christ we have access to him 24 7 but you got to fight through a badger skin amen and not just yours but you're gonna have to fight through mine as well because we're gonna be there trying to break into the presence of god together aren't we and you've got to be able to see past the flaws and the retractions to see what that god's using me the same as he's using you right that there's something behind that badger skin that doesn't just look a lot like god it is god amen what was he doing and he did something in one moment that men for 4 000 years couldn't do that the blood of bulls and goats couldn't do and what did he say whosoever will because guess what you could be a gentile and stand out there you could come into the outer court as a gentile couldn't you but you couldn't go any further than that but you could see past and you could see all the way through those doors and you can see all the way into this kind of presence when that veil was torn because nothing could be hit then he tore and he showed this isn't a work of man now this is a this is the act of god and he's coming down to do something amen what'd he say whosoever will that's what he opened it up to when he did that romans 10 says for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved used to be a levite male priest perfect physical condition and chosen for that year that was how you came in where do you see that here whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved there's no requirements now women can come in isn't that great sisters the less than perfect physically can make it in you don't have to be a minister to get in you don't have to win a lottery to get in i believe we want a lottery to get in but we didn't have to apply him and it was already in us to win these things amen but what you can be anybody with any flaw any character mistakes any genetic predispositions you can look bad you can act bad you can be bad but if you call on his name you can enter into his presence it's that simple amen there's no qualifications to get in now it's whosoever will the prophet of god says in the old testament god was hid when he was on his mercy seat by a veil in the old testament god was in his temple but the people come in and worship like this but remember there was a veil that hid god they knew god was there but they couldn't see him he says that pillar of fire never appeared anymore there did you notice that he says there's not one time in the scripture from the time that pillar fire went in behind that veil that it ever showed up again until it came from jesus christ he says god was still veiled he says when he stood on the earth he said i come from god and i go to god then paul after his death burial and resurrection on his road to damascus there was that pillar of fire again what was it out from behind the veil he says glory to god he was in behind the veil now he was behind what a skin veil see badger skins behind the veil and when that veil was rent on that day of crucifixion the veil that he was wrapped in was rent on that day of crucifixion and the whole mercy seat came into view he says now the jews could not understand how that god would have mercy upon a sinful foul people like we were we are but they couldn't see this one who was giving mercy because he was hid he said well we'll get into in a moment i'll get ahead of myself he says he was behind the mercy seat on the inside with badger skins hanging him down covering him before can you imagine the faces on the people that went into the temple after this happened they walk in and they see this thing and it's torn from top to bottom and they can look into the holiest holies where they could never have looked before maybe he never had looked before maybe always wanted to look and had never experienced and now they can look in there and they can see the ark of the covenant they can see the mercy seat they can see the blood they can see everything that's in there and he says they look in there and god's not even there anymore they wouldn't see anything they wouldn't feel anything you'd think if there's a shekinah presence there and that's open that means the presence should be out here and i should feel something when i walked in but i can't imagine they felt anything because the chicano presence wasn't there anymore i wonder how many lost faith after that and walked away because why the presence of god was supposed to be in there the ministry told us that and now it's open and there's no shekinah glory there what's going on the priests going in now year after year guess what that bread wasn't stained that manna wasn't staying fresh in there anymore was it now it's moldy bread now it's moldy men it'd be gone within a couple of months at the most and they're going in there and there's no shekinah presence and they're keeping up what a facade to pretend that the presence of god is there and they're serving a dead religion in there to die in their sins that's what jesus said right there was nothing there god had departed brother braham says the mercy seat was in plain view where hanging on a cross what he said it was dressed in badger skins just the way it was in the temple and it was the body of jesus christ and they couldn't recognize what it was amen amen and yet you had a centurion that could sit there and say surely this was the son of god what was it it was it was a gentile recognition starting right there that god was turning and he was coming into a new form amen what was it the mercy seat in there under under the veil had lost its purpose because why had been moved to another place now there's a different mercy seat the prophet god put it this way he says now when the veil was rent at calvary then the mercy seat came into plain view but what happened it was hanging on calvary dripping in blood and as they took blood year after year at the cleansing of the sanctuary and the sprinkling of the mercy seat there god with his great mighty stroke of lightning power split the old badger veil from top to bottom and the mercy seat came into plain view the real genuine lamb of god was hanging in plain view on calvary the real mercy seat when god had paid the price himself and become one of us and have manifest himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we to be acquainted with him what's he doing restoring fellowship he says the mercy seat was in plain view all of all of israel on that day of atonement that's what we saw in revelation 5. where's the mercy seat now it's there because that's where the lamb is right he's sitting there and he comes out and he's taking it as the line of the tribe of judah but he comes out as what a lamb slain because what there's still blood on the mercy seat they say in some churches today that the mercy seat is closed listen as long as i'm getting mercy i'm saying the mercy seat is closed and i don't know about you i still need lots of mercy so that means he's still there there's a quote i may bring later where brother braham says it's not when he comes to take the book but it's when he comes to get his bride that's when the mercy seat comes and is put away and it turns into a judgment seat he's reading those names he's calling those people out but when they are ready to go that's when mercy comes and it goes away because what it goes with the bride that was his mercy we're here to receive mercy after that it's only judgment there's only judgment but for now that mercy seat is still available to us because he takes the book as a lamb and he's reading it as a lamb but he comes as a lion to get us and then we rule and reign with him in the millennium and all these different things amen listen if he's off the mercy seat we'd have lost the victory a long time ago that's for sure because what we're still in imperfect flesh and and currently speaking we're still doing things we ought not to do so there's still got to be mercy there the blood covers it all for forever but that blood is where on a mercy seat somewhere it's got to be otherwise we'd be dead today he says before he could even talk to adam and eve he had to make a sin offering there with the lamb catch that he had to kill a lamb before he could even come and judge adam and eve tell them what was going to happen and what they did wrong and what was going to take place further down the road he had to kill a lamb just to bring them into his presence he says that's the reason listen to this that they can have rock and rolls and all kinds of vulgar in the world tonight and god doesn't take their life or skip the world off is because that blood is laying on the mercy seat he says but one of these days that blood's coming off the mercy seat and then it's judgment i don't know he says it may be off before that clock gets to 9 30. hour and 17 minutes he says i don't know then shall be dark and there'll be nothing but judgment he says you've passed your own judgment with the attitude you've taken towards his son and his atonement look out if that's your attitude i've talked about before we have those shirts and those memes and they say that only god can judge me that is not the attitude we want to have no no no no no let's let the word judge us now and let's take what we have to do let's go with the remedy now because if you go to where god judges you you're not going to like the results in most cases amen amen to spurn it is to choose his judgment brother brown says you fight your way to cal to to to hell you're going to fight your way there because he's going to put roadblock and roadblock and roadblock in front of you and what is it it's his mercy and grace and it's forgiveness being offered and if you spurn it then you're making that choice to go to hell every time listen this is what he brought to us and this is the book of luke chapter four it says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written now he's looking for his place in the word i was listening to a thing today where brother andrew glover shared this and it was it was the answer to what is the message of the hour and what does it give him for and what did he say he says the message was to point you to the scriptures for your day that are important for you to fulfill in this time listen we we get the whole word we believe the whole word but he says there's key things here that you need to be focused on he says and the messenger came to focus you on those things that you need to get out of here in the rapture so you don't waste your time doing what everybody did in church ages past take it and move on take it and move on take it and move on because you've got a growing grace past where all of them did so if you stay where they were then you're not going to get anywhere you've got to grow and grow and grow add it word upon word line upon line and the messenger came and he focused us on those things that will take us into a rapture he didn't tell us to ignore the bible he pointed us to the bible he says i preached the same thing paul preached but i'm telling you what you need to get out of here focus on that and that's why we preach a message that's why we don't preach maybe all the things that they do in denominations because most of it we covered early on and now we're moving on to things that are higher things that are greater that's what's alert our sight amen is the word as a song says but he comes down he finds his position he finds his place in the word in in isaiah 61 he says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised and then in verse 19 he says to preach the acceptable year of the lord now you know in isaiah 61 that that scripture should read to preach the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god and to comfort all that mourn but he stops here in the middle of that verse why because that was all going to be in the future he stopped to say i'm preaching the acceptable year of the lord amen what was it there wasn't a time for vengeance this was a time for repair this was a time for remedy this was a time for restoration this was a time for redemption and so he's saying all of the good stuff is coming now you've waited all this time you've been under the law you've been under the law and it's brought you nothing but heartache but he says now it's time to set all of you free and this is this is the day this is the time this is the age i looked up that word acceptable and it means pleasure delight favor good will and acceptance that's a great year that's a great day is when it is of god's pleasure god's delight god's favor god's good will and god's acceptance because everything up to this point was just works and it couldn't bring you into the presence of god unless you were that one chosen priest but now he says there's something else going on now and we're in the season of deliverance we're in the season of healing we're in the season of redemption we're in the season of setting those things that were captive free amen and this is the acceptable time this is the time that god has chosen for this in verse 20 says and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what was he doing he was saying there's a year of jubilee that's come now something's going to happen between now and that jubilee but this is the time where things are going to change where we're going to transition from law into grace and that's going to bring healing that's going to bring deliverance that's going to bring what a recovering of sight it's going to bring a freedom to those that are bound and it's coming through me no wonder they were looking at him i bet they preached a lot on that and everybody was saying it's coming it's coming it's coming and then one day he stands and he says it's here and it's me amen amen under the law what was it do this and do that and if you don't do this then something bad is going to happen to you now listen the law of the harvest is not going to gone away you listen if you do bad you're going to reap bad if you do good you're going to reap good in that sense but god has brought grace that overshadows all of that and regardless of what we do he brings it around to what a place where he can turn it into something good that's romans 8 28 and we all know these things amen brother branham said it this way he says god wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed because what it's the acceptable year that's his good will that's his grace that's his desire for you is to be healed more than you even wanted that's how great god wants to bless his bride that's how great god wants to bless the the true believer in the church in this age amen what's he doing he's bringing them back now to what abraham was doing that was a walk of faith that's what it was supposed to be was a walk of faith where god could come down and he could talk with you but now you can go up and you can talk to him as well there's this back and forth him and under the law what were we we were punished we were stoned we were put out of the camp we were separated we were called out right we had we had things that went all the way up into the fourth generation even the 40th generation i think was the worst right god would judge entire families for for for the sins of one person and now i can have a philandering father and then i can become a minister because why it has nothing to do with him anymore now it has to do with me and the seed of god inside of me amen there's a grace that's coming to set them at liberty that were what captives amen what was jesus declaring he says now is the time now is the time and what did he do he walked around he showed everybody it because what demons had to obey him sickness had to leave death had to depart and he would restore people back to life the power and signs and wonders of god came back to the people all of it's happening around him and yet this is not the perfection that we're looking for there's still something that's got to be happening because he's doing it and he brings on the disciples and they do it but yet judas does it so it's not a perfect yet it's not perfect in us it was perfect in him but he's bringing us to a greater place but just for that moment he says listen this is the time for liberty this is a time for captives to be set free he talks about even the bruising the brokenhearted so often we skip that and we focus on the healing of the body and these different things but he says i'm here to do what i'm here to heal the brokenhearted those are the bruises those that have been knocked around in life whether it's your family whether it's your job whether it's your church whether it's past ministries all of that comes under that and it's an internal work that he does complexes insecurities and these different things that all falls under liberty yeah right it's not just i got healed from cancer but i got healed from a complex i got healed from hurts i got it to the place where i could come back to church and sit under a minister that i didn't trust a couple years ago or any minister for that matter when i didn't trust any of them i mean it was so much bigger than what we often put it into i want to go back to that quote i read earlier where he talked about the earth and and the rocks you know shaking for joy because i didn't read the whole thing because i wanted to bring it to this point but he says they screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains rent and the rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything taken place listen to what he says he says like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you it's finished he says i've seen jumping spells and joy spells there was nobody hurt you know how somebody's dancing or running in the spirit they don't hit the wall or anybody else he says nobody was hurt during this earth explosion he says the mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place but there was nobody hurt quite the opposite things came to life again he says and i've seen meetings where the power of god was revealed to the people that they were what free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the lord fill the congregation and they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god what's he saying he's saying don't keep this as a 2000 year old event he says when you realize you're free when you realize that you were bound and now you're free when you realize that you are healed when you realize that you are delivered when you realize that the bruises are gone he's saying then what let him know shout for joy let him know that you're praising him for the work that he's done it wasn't just 2 000 years ago what he said this is the acceptable year and that year has never ended it's been going on and on and on through seven church ages through seven messengers we're being restored to a place where it's happening in our very own churches and bodies amen that's what he has restored back to us it wasn't just calvary's moment it wasn't their moment then remember the prophet says every every generation has its revival make sure you have this kind of a revival where you know you're free not just free but free indeed completely totally totally separated totally set aside amen what to know that he has done a work in your life when i was when brother aaron was preaching the other night and he was talking about you know you can't go back to these things you know why you can't go back because those works are dead because the person that did it is dead and there's a new life in you that won't allow you to go back and do it you can't go back to something that doesn't exist you can't go back to your old self because your old self died there's nothing to go back to you're incapable of doing it it's all dead right and you're a new creature in christ amen amen i never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order because they have recognized that their name had been written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world the great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered the prophet shepard no matter what the other ecclesiastical realm said about it they know what happened no matter what the wet blankets around them said right true no matter what the white blanket said it's just emotion it's just a church service there's no such thing as the holy ghost what is it all you need is the word we've all heard that one listen you need the life of the word not just the word because the letter will kill you and that's what they're saying is you only need the letter of the word why because they have no life of the word but you need a life that comes behind today man you know something has happened he says no matter what the ecclesiastical realm said about it they knew what had happened just as them shepherds did back there they know what took place now you understand what's going on in revelation 5 like we read at the beginning of the service because why they're realizing it's finished he's coming he's taken the book nobody was worthy and we've been waiting all this time for someone that's worthy and then he took it and as soon as he did what did they do john shouted why did john show because he saw his name in the lamb's book of life it says and all the earth heard it what are you going to do when your name is written on the lamb book of the lamb's book of life when you know that you know that you know that it's written there then nothing can separate you from god that you come from god and you go to god the same as jesus came from god and he went back to god that nothing can separate you from his love that there is always grace that will restore you back to his presence what are you going to sit and complain about what how is what weapon of satan can can pierce that because you're securing him a heart of praise will keep satan away i do believe that if you if you're thanking him for not just what he's doing but what he's done and what he's promised he's going to do for you amen where is this happening in revelation 5 it's in the holy of holies isn't it it's in the presence of god that's why we see them shouting and dancing and praising and singing a new song to the land because what it's not just what he's done but it's what he's doing with that book he's placing them it says as kings and priests he's restoring them to a kingdom position amen brother brahm says this he says notice every year the high priest entered into that place the congregation followed him up and when he went into this great place where the veil dropped behind him the inner courts the holiest of holies no one dared to go after him then he was alone with god he says what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veils drop down around and all the world shut off he says then christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer can you say it's a pleasure to serve the lord in the good times praise his name and the bad times do the same in everything give the king of kings all the praise amen he says under this in this and it's in the hidden life and we'll get into it maybe in the in the next time i minister but he says it's that hidden life in christ that's what he's talking about is nobody else sees it it's you you're behind there you know what he's done and guess what the outside doesn't always match the inside in my life at least but you don't worry about that because you know what's going on in the inside and you know the outside's going to come into checking in its own time amen we're all going to mature we're all going to grow in christ amen the jews in that day had one man a high priest to represent them each year and they never got to experience what he experienced and they trusted that what he said happened in there did happen in there they had faith in that man now the prophet's pointing us forward back to the death of christ and he says that priest used to go in for himself and he'd come in and go out and they come in again for you and then he go without and he says you're trusting him to cover your pre cover up your sins amen he says now you get to go in for other reasons because he says here you go in he says he says you don't go in alone to cover your sins he says now you go in alone for one thing and one thing alone fellowship shut him with god in a secret place that's what he's talking about here he says you don't go in to cover your sins your sins are covered brother brother mark did that series on the blood or that service on the blood and that's that's good for eternity the blood's there for eternity you don't go into his presence now to cover your sins they're covered he can't even see them they don't exist as far as he can he's concerned god in all of his great power can't bring your sins out from under the blood so you don't have to go into his presence now for forgiveness you don't have to go into his uh not for forgiveness of sins in the sense that the sins are covered but you go in now for fellowship you go in to have a relationship with him and him alone that's what he's pointing us to right and he says when you get in there he says it's not a chore it's not a chore to be in there with him because it's life and it's love and it's freedom in the spirit and it's liberty and it's healing and all these things that we were talking about he says now it's a delight it's a passion it's a pleasure for you to be in the presence of god you're not running from it now now you're running to it in fact you'll do anything won't you to go to a good set of meetings you'll do anything to get good fellowship with believers you'll take vacation time to go to there you want you won't go to you know the bahamas or hawaii what do you do you go to services don't you you take your kids and you go off to special services why because that matters more to you than any of those other things would we all need a break but so often what we're doing is we're looking for more fellowship we're looking for more time in the presence of god not more time to enjoy the things of the world and we see that happening all around us amen he says but until you come in behind that badger skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creeds and come into the presence of god then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the shekinah glory then the bible becomes a new book then jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's a lot of ends what that tells me is until you get in there then none of that happens but once you get in there then expect all of this to happen as well amen he says you're living in his presence eating the show bread that's only provided that day for believers for priests only that's why you have to be a king and you have to be a priest because the priests were the only ones that were supposed to eat that bread and he says you get in there and you get bread that's only meant for the believers for the priesthood he says and we are priests a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to god he says but you must come in behind the veil to see the unveiled god and god is unveiled that's his word made manifest no things are hidden from you jesus said i call your friends i show you things i don't show to other people why because you're in an intimate place with me right what a place to find yourself that's what's happening in revelation 5 is they're not just seeing their names on the book but they're seeing all that comes with their name on the book amen that this is not just a lamb's book of life but it has a whole title deed inside there that tells you who you are what's yours what's available to you and what you can go claim because all you have in your bank account is a credit and you got all the credit you need for all of those things why it's yours you don't even have to pay a price for it it's yours it's given to you price is already paid amen we don't have to go in and come out that's what we're talking about we don't have to go in and come out you have to go in and come out come here and go out no no no you can go in and you can stay in and no man can pull you out and no man can put you in i mean it's only god that's going to draw you in there amen we can live there even in this fallen condition we can live in the presence of god because why our sins are covered he made a way for us to come over romans 5 says for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation adam brought us there even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men under justification of life for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous sorry about that he said moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound that means there was a lot and then there was a lot more and there's a lot more grace than there is sin right he says that as sin hath reigned unto death even so my grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord so in other words as sin controlled us so effectively and brought us to death grace is all the more effective to bring us to eternal life so you there's only they say there's only two things certain in this world death and taxes he says listen the law and it was so strong that it would take you all the way sin would take you all the way to death and he says the guarantee of that is as certainly found in grace to bring you to eternal life as much as death is certain by sin he says so is eternal life guaranteed by grace to the same effect and more and above and beyond it it'll overflow it it'll it'll it'll never do it it'll never take us back amen amen but we don't have access like i said to god for the purpose of covering our sins now he's bringing us into a place of fellowship you listen to crisis the mystery of god revealed and he says what he's trying to bring us to a place where he can use us not just restore us we we're so happy he restores us and he redeems us and he takes us out of the pawn shop but the question is what are you going to do now now that he's brought you out that's what we're going to be getting into not so much today man anyone can come in he says but you'll have the heart of a priest and you'll have the heart of the king that's the two things that you're going to have when you're in his presence you're not going to come in with them but that's what he's going to put inside of you amen a new heart i'll give you and i'll place my spirit within you know these two things amen what does a priest mean because we're not going to rule here not now not in these bodies we're going to come back and rule aren't we we've got a millennial reign and then we've got an eternal reign that's after that but we are a priesthood right here right now and there's only one thing a priest does sacrifices and intercess that's he's an intercessor and he offers sacrifice and what you don't need to offer one for yourself anymore so who are you interceding for somebody else that's the heart of the believer today first peter 2 is speaking of this priesthood it says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings if you want to see where somebody's at look at their walk with god and this is a great place to start if you're looking for that are they vengeful do they seek to manipulate do they say one thing and do another and do they talk about others or how do they talk about others he says if you want to come to what i'm about to tell you get rid of this in the first place he says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby that sincere milk of the word means you want it all because a baby wants all of the milk the mother has anybody that's had a baby certainly the mothers that have fed it know that it wants everything you got right it doesn't say can you screen it for me please can we add a bit of chocolate in can we no no it says i want everything you got because i know what it does for me first thing it does is it satisfies doesn't it it soothes it brings peace it brings rest causes them to grow and mature they want milk and he says look like newborn babes you want sincere milk you want the full thing you don't want it diluted you want it all because you need it all amen and that's the other thing you got to recognize is how much you need it he says if so be that you have tasted that the lord is gracious so he's saying if you found god's grace you'll want every bit of the word right because it was the word that brought you it's the word that's going to keep you it was grace that brought you and let you want it in the first place he says and you want to keep in that grace because it'll keep bringing the word to you that's going to do what it's going to wash you and it's going to bring you into his presence and it's going to have the effect that you want to have in your life and you know it by experience yes right a baby wants milk by experience not by hearing the other babies cry and then stop crying he wants it by experience it may be pushed into his mouth or her mouth the first time after that they know exactly what it is and they know that they want it because it has an effect on them the first time listen that's why people go around so often is because they aren't satisfied with what they have they're running from here to their in doctrine to doctrine and ministry to ministry and place to place and what is it they've had they haven't had that satisfaction amen brother tim's been preaching on el shaddai right and what is it he's the life-giver and they just haven't latched on for one time and gotten life and so they keep running from church to church to church and ministry and doctrine to doctrine to what try and find something that will satisfy them because they ain't growing and they ain't satisfied they just need to come one time into his presence amen he says to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones as living stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ he says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people gentiles weren't a people that was just everybody that wasn't a jew he says now you're a people now you're an identified group but are now the people of god so you are nothing and now you're a people of god that's quite a transition that's quite a change in status isn't it he says which had not obtained mercy but have now obtained mercy so the identification first and foremost of the children of the people of god is that they've obtained mercy so if you obtain it then what does that mean you ought to give what you get right freely you have received freely you ought to give amen if you have received mercy we ought to be the most merciful people on the planet i've got to think amen we rule and reign later but he says the priesthood is going to be what merciful that's what he's talking about here amen he says we weren't even identified before and now we are the people of god the prophet of god says has made us priests he said did you ever know what a priest is what his office is a priest is to make sacrifices to make intercession and over in hebrews it said that we the church is the royal priesthood a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people see offering spiritual sacrifices every man and woman that comes to god enters into the veil in the old testament there was only there was a veil that hung between the holy place and the holy of holies only aaron alone was to go in there once a year but every man listen to this every man that became a priest could have a bite or a taste of the original manna that moses and aaron picked up the first day the manna began to fall from heaven that was their proof really when you think about it that the presence of god was real in there is that food could stay preserved it wouldn't go bad because it was in the presence of god amen he said the enemies were killed behind them the next day they went out and all over the ground laid little wafers god rained it down out of heaven they called it manna and it tasted like honey and the people were just supposed to pick up enough to last them for that one day if they kept it over it contaminated and god told moses and aaron to go out and pick up several omer fulls of it great baskets and take it by the ark the holy place and there that every time after that generation so long after the man has stopped falling every generation following that wall as long as that levitical priesthood would last i suppose every man that was eligible to become a priest when he was ordained a priest he had the perfect right to receive a mouthful of the original manna okay we're putting on our spiritual thinking caps now you're a royal priesthood so what the original one's got to taste you're supposed to be able to have a taste of it amen as soon as you're inducted into the priesthood and we're talking about the natural ministry we're talking about the royal priesthood the body of christ then there's something that we're supposed to be able to have a taste of each and every one of us amen he says think of it what a privilege that the men thought they would have when a man know that he was coming into the priesthood he was going to get a mouthful of supernatural baked supernatural stirred up supernatural food that came from god out of heaven that had been kept supernaturally that's the message of the hour he says the whole ministry is the supernatural how can people ever say that they're christians and deny the supernatural i don't know how they do it myself look but a supernatural he says he got a swallow of the supernatural as soon as he become a priest that's when he knew it wasn't just myths and fables and false doctrine and and just a religion that they made up when he tasted that manna that hadn't existed for hundreds maybe thousands of years that's when he knew that god was real that god had done what they read about in the books of moses and that he was still alive because he was still keeping the man afresh he was putting a supernatural food into his mouth that hadn't existed maybe for thousands of years before christ came and as me the minute he came into the priesthood that was his opportunity was to go in there and take something what is it job said i have heard but now i see yes there's got to come a day where you see not just here where it's not just words but it becomes life where it comes off the page and it becomes a reality in each and every one of our lives he says what a beautiful type of now of now that every person not just ministry not just men not just deacons not just people that go to this church or that church but he says every person them days they had to be born in a certain lineage a levite before they become a priest but now it's whosoever will let him come see as soon as they come though a birth is considered in it also he says you must be born again and every man or woman that's born again of the spirit of god has a right for this day the manna and he says the manna is the holy spirit amen that's what we all have a right to when he tore the veil he says now everybody has a right to my presence and not just to come into it but to receive it into themselves to the place now that he's walking around with you he's talking around with you he's present with you every hour of every day of every week month and year amen that's where we're going with this series is when he now comes to you and now your tasting of the heavenly manner and now you've got something to offer you're not just a taker but now you're a giver amen brother braham says behind that bail you don't just get to be with god he says you get to receive god you get to taste god you get to know that he's real that's what it means to be in the presence of god is to know that he's real that his word is manifested that it's not just a preacher talking it's not just mom and dad saying things but it is a life that's there and if there's a living person behind that word amen he says now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood at church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows had left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries of the seven seals see he's expressing himself that's his purpose it's not just doctrines it's not just mysteries it's not just things that we didn't understand he says it's the expression of god and that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then express himself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them he said see the threefold mystery now god manifested in christ god manifested in the church all together to bring back the original adam and eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and the same spirit and everything else that's where we're standing today we're standing right smack dab in the middle i would say the end of that threefold purpose is god working in and through his church so that we are one as adam and eve were one in the beginning as god was in the very beginning with them amen what is it he came to declare that what there's a jubilee year and this is what it looks like he didn't just say you could go free he says you could go free and you can be with me amen because there's lots of people got set free there's lots of people accepted that free gift of salvation but what are they doing with it they're living lives for themselves aren't they right and they're going to have to go through a judgment they're going to have to go through a tribulation but he says you don't want to go there you want to come all the way until the word is flowing through you so that you're the word manifested not just christ not just william branham not just paul not just peter but now you personally are what the word may manifest for your day he's talking about setting the captives free amen this is what it looks like now i want to read this as we start to close just going back to that isaiah 61 and someone sends in this question to brother branham they said i've lived many years in sin until i found the lord please brother branham i have sinned again and i am not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if i can be restored holy again please help me brother branham i have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again remember we're talking about what this is the day of liberty this is the day the captives are set free listen to what the prophet of god says he says you have not sinned my friends so far in god that you could not be restored amen if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored see but as long as there is something dealing with your heart you're still in the line of restoration you don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask this question see that's itself a proof that god still is dealing with you you've probably gotten nervous probably satan telling you that you can't be restored he says he's lying certainly he is because look if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to the call if there's a hunger for something that something's got to be somewhere or you would have no hunger for it see he says yes sister brother whoever that wrote this if you have fallen down here that don't mean you're lost you're just an eagle god into a pen that's all you're caged up down here in sin again you don't want to be there and that's the reason you're looking upward he says there you are oh brother branham i once lived up there is there a way here yes he says reminds me of one day i was walking around behind the farm and somebody had tied an old crow up to keep him out of the corn and that old poor old fellow was just about starved to death i couldn't be that mean to do that he tied the old crow by the foot and that fellow had eat everything was around but he couldn't get nothing else the farmer just left him and he was so poor that he couldn't even get up and the crows would fly over and say in other words come on johnny crow winter time's coming let's go south but he couldn't do it he was tied he says so one day a certain fella come by and seen that pearl crow so he just went over and caught him and untied him and said go on boy you're free that's what christ did he said see and so then the first thing you know he kept walking around because he's tied to a post and he's got a string to his leg so it's pinned here and so what's he doing he's just walking around and around and around day in and day out and he's got a groove worn there he's got he's in a rut isn't he and he's walking around and around and around and then somebody cuts the string but he's so used to his limits that he just keeps walking around and around and around the guy says fly free and he says i can't i'm tied yeah how do you know you're tired because i'm in the same groove i always was think about it he says but you can fly yeah but he can't do it because he doesn't realize it's been cut he says he'd been tied he'd been so used to being tied see he just thought he was still tied he says you may think you're tied too brother sister that wrote this question you may think that the devil has got you tied down there but he's lying there was one time a man come to earth jesus christ the son of god and he untied you don't you believe it you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free that's right he died in your place to take away your sins you just believe on him flop your wings fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil no sir he says now and he reads the rest of the question will you lay hands upon me and free from that how many of us would love the prophet to lay hands on us i'd love it i trust his prayer i trust the call of god in his life i trust his ministry i trust his words i trust that god would hear him listen to his answer brother branham will you lay hands on me and free me from that he says sister dear brother dear sure i'd lay hands on you and we'd say praise the lord that's it it's done he says that wouldn't free you what would free you is to understand that you're already free you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free he says jesus made you free be not again entangled in the yoke of bondage you're as free as you can be you don't have to be tangled up laying my hands on you is just a tradition we might do that that why i could do that but that still wouldn't set you free until you accept what he's done for you that's just me saying lord i believe it amen i like when brother aaron was talking about that stone and they were building up the the walls and what did what were they pointing out sam ballard and tobias they're pointing out the gaps that were still there but they weren't pointing to the rocks that had been built up they weren't talking about the the walls that have been reinforced and that's what satan does is he's pointing you at one thing he's pointing you to the walls of the prison but you know what he's not pointing out there's no locks because what jesus said i have what the keys have death hell and the grave so whatever the s that satan is trying to tell you you have that you can't get out of what's he doing is he's pointing you to the thickness of the bars on the door that jesus christ has already unlocked remember brother adam told the story of that guy that was going to be killed and and his mother appealed to the president i think it was abraham lincoln i don't remember for sure don't hold me to it and abraham lincoln said yes i'll do it and he and he did what and he brought the pardon down or he gave the pardon and the guy came down he says you're free you're free and he says i don't believe it i don't believe you're the president i don't believe this or that and so they took him out and they shot him and it went to the brother graham said it went to the court and and they found that if you don't accept a pardon as a pardon then it wasn't a pardon for you you have to accept what's been done before it can be a parted the fact that they had a pardon for him didn't matter if he didn't take the pardon that's what brother i'm saying is he's saying if you're looking at the prison doors rather than the one that's standing outside saying you don't have to stay in there then you'll stay in there but he says he's already unlocked it there's no more locks there to hold you in all you have to do is swing that door open he says all you got to do is accept and believe that what he says is true and then you walk right out of that pit you walked out of that prison cell you walk away from where you've been tied down for so long amen this day this scripture is fulfilled jesus said and that day is still today it wasn't just 2000 years ago but it's still today this scripture is fulfilled that he came to set the captives free that he came to provide every blessing every redemptive promise that he paid for us at calvary is available to the believer here today amen when the holy ghost was given on the day of pentecost he opened up what the path to a hidden life that david had written about and cried and sought for all of his life and never found it amen we have what david always wanted we have what abraham always wanted we have what noah always wanted we have what solomon always wanted all these different ones he's given us a place to come into that hidden life where what all chains are broken all complexes are delivered from us right where we can walk in newness of life where we can leave our history behind us listen if rahab can do it without the holy ghost what our believer to be able to do today amen to leave our past behind and get married to a great captain that's what she did amen a captain of the host of israel amen what is it we're talking about a place where you can have fellowship that takes you into a heavenly place that makes you not just believe the word of god but live the word of god i mean let's stand if we would together invite the musicians to come amen now is not the time of captivity now is the time for liberty amen and anything that you have need of you can find it written in the word of god then it's available to you yes sir tonight here at your home in your prayer closet brother branham how many times in services would he say listen you don't have to come up here and he tell the people he says lay your hands one on another and he'd say that's it that's what we're looking for not one man doing it he says but a body of believers joining together in faith under the unity of that word and he says when you lay hands on one another he says then people will be healed that's what we're looking for is a unity of the faith amen until it takes us all the way into a rapture and let's just bow our heads together if we would heavenly father lord what a price you paid lord and there's nothing we can do that could ever justify us in your presence lord that could even justify the price that was paid but you willingly paid it lord of your own free will lord you came down and you laid your life down for us lord and you laid down our life so that we could go free lord and if there's anyone here tonight lord that needs a freeing lord that needs a liberty lord that needs a deliverance lord we pray that you will minister to them in this service lord as we sing these songs for a while lord may you just minister to hearts and souls here heavenly father lord healing of body healing of mind healing of spirit healing of relationship lord whatever it might be lord god we ask for your grace in this little body here tonight lord minister to your people in this little while we pray lord we ask your grace for the many that will travel also this week lord praying that you'll just lord grant them grace and favor with those they come in contact with lord may you help them to get home safely lord to where they can be a blessing to the body of christ where they're at but we ask these things in jesus name amen amen sing that song he's ever interceding 1162 to the father for
