believe god that we still believe in the coming of the lord jesus christ we still believe in the rapture and the resurrection amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah brother sister oh my g he is challenging our faith as he challenged martha's faith to believe in the resurrection now amen not in the future amen because he said oh he said lazarus is going to rise from the dead oh yes she said he went up there in the resurrection he said i'm the resurrection amen amen praise the lord the the power anointing of the resurrection was made flesh and called jesus amen now brother sister the resurrection and the rapture the power the anointing is made flesh in the bride of our lord jesus christ amen brother i trust amen as the right mrs jesus christ we have the power and the anointing of mr jesus christ praise the name of the lord so brother sister trust me by grace that we know who we are amen truly we know where we come from and we know where we're going and we know how to get there praise the lord because if we are the seed of god he's there to give us the revelation we need praise the lord and brother oh my i pray grace we're going to move beyond lord do this do this in this world prosper me in this world oh lord i need this brother we need to get out of this world amen look up because that our redemption is that ant oh yeah the bible says when we look at this or we see this we see that oh my praise the lord it's we're living in a tremendous hour amen brother let us look up amen they're looking up let us look up brother if there's anything that god has done in this hour in this age is to give us the faith we need amen and brother we need more than what they had in luther's age wesley say he's the pentecostal age amen other other revivals that god said god started around the world brother they give them faith to move on faith to move on faith to move on brother now he wants to give us the faith it's not just moving on in time it's to get out of time and move on to eternity by the grace of god brother what faith is god giving us what faith has god given us and what faith is god working on in your life and in mind amen what's god endeavoring to get us to do what does god want us to believe what is the promise that god wants us to claim in these last days oh brother sister i trust you realize it please let's not let's not forget let's not lose the revelation amen because it's going to keep us yes right it's going to keep us in what god wants us to do he's going to keep us amen conscious of what god wants us to believe amen brother luther when he got he got the whole the just sure just the justification justification oh my and like i said oh he went day after day after day maybe year after year after year he was doing this doing this doing this oh feeling that if he did this he'd be justified by works amen oh good works and so on but no no it didn't justify him amen and brother he got no peace he got no justification peace rest amen until he he went into the church he opened up the bible and read the scriptures amen concerning that jesus was our justifier jesus justified us amen and what he did and what he's doing he's justified us amen and not only that he's sanctified us amen fill us with the holy ghost and he what's he doing he's rapturing us praise the lord he resurrected us amen we were dead in sins and trespasses and he came and he gave us resurrection amen amen oh keep looking keep looking up keep looking up because i've resurrected your soul and i'm going to resurrect your body praise the lord hallelujah brother how many of us really want to get out of here how many of us really want to go brother don't let old age bring dead on you no no no regardless of whether our young brothers or sisters here are the older ones amen we should have that same faith amen lord the rather the same zeal enthusiasm that that the older ones are looking for the resurrection looking for the rapture that our young ones will be looking for the same thing only and thirsting because they know they're living in a world that's dying amen that a world that's condemned a world that's damned and getting worse and worse and worse it ain't going to get better so i pray god help us look up amen brother again it's all here it's the word the word the word what god has done what god's doing and what god will do it's all here amen and brother not only that but what what he expects of the believers yesterday today tomorrow it's all right here amen brother what what he was looking for five hundred years ago he found it in luther luther oh yeah yeah luther cut the revelation and began to walk in the revelation wesley caught in the revelation walked in the revelation amen and others back then even even with william bootha's salvation army and other amen revivals that god started they just kept walking in the word moving on moving on moving on pentecost but now the bride amen because why because we it was going to get so bad hallelujah as god was what as god was getting getting ready to leave the earth as it were and to bring judgment down on the earth he was going to get the bride out amen by the grace of almighty god oh lord where are you look up my son amen it's not look here to this revival that revive look up amen because now he said everything is moving up i'm taking everything out brothers are going to take you up i trust you'll take us in the resurrection take us in the rapture they not leave us behind no no brother i trust we're not we're not going to be numbered with those let's just say oh when they see this they see that see something oh i thought there was to be a resurrection thought there was to be a rapture it already happened and they didn't know it oh yeah but i trust well i know according to the word the bride will know and the bride does know amen because why god did this sir luther what was he doing oh he was he was bringing in justification justification justification amen and they got the revelation they rejoiced they praised the lord morning noon and night amen oh yeah luther was seeking it but then when he got it praise the lord he was a new creature in christ amen same with wesley same with the others same with the pentecostals but brother god's god's looking for more than just justification satisfaction and the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit he's looking for more now amen oh yeah he gave them that faith they had it they went and lived it amen but brother what faith is he given us and what faith is he's recording of us now amen brother it's not it's not just going to say luther luther luther wesley wesley wesley or the early pentecostals pentecostals no no no you're the end time what man i trust by grace we got the faith that we're looking for the rapture we have the faith that we're looking to get out of here and i trust by grace that that faith controls us morning noon and night amen it's not just a a doctrine not just oh theology and we're going to get together now and and maybe the preacher is going to say something about the rapture he might preach something about the resurrection oh yeah that's good that's good we know we're living in that time but are you experiencing it amen god brought luther into the experience of justification amen he brought wesley into the experience of sanctification amen it's not just a the letter of the word not just you know doctrines and theology no it was an experience amen he brought the pentecostals into the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen experience they always god is bringing us more and more and more what into oneness with god hallelujah more and more into the image of god in the beginning was the word amen the word were with god the word was god and the word was made flesh in him and in you in us the words made flesh amen yeah on the world with may flesh and luther and wesley amen and and the early christians down through the ages they took their stand amen to the extent that 68 million laid down their lives amen how many is going to lay down their lives yes well they're not going to kill us for this or that no but you got to lay down your life amen let the devil take it amen go on satan get away amen but i'm hallelujah i'm laying in my life down in christ and rising again amen in the resurrection oh it's the revelation of god it is the revelation of jesus amen that's why they're proud of god said one time when he was ministering and and and the anointing was there and he said oh he said that's the problem he said he said you don't see the other angel amen they could see william branham or they knew he had this anointing he had this gift he could do this do this do this it was god ain't bad but what was he trying to do he was trying to get our attention to jesus yeah and that's why when when he when he was called when he was ordained when he was commissioned when he was given the gifts that he had what was it it was to get the people to believe not just to get their attention to him no no let's get their attention to the word amen to believe the word praise the name of the lord and i trust we're numbered with those that brother that he has gotten to believe amen and to believe what not just to believe in god but to believe what god is doing amen and that will go forth and god's going to reveal it in you and in me we're going to test if i have it oh our lives are going to reflect what god's doing amen luther's life reflected what god did western the pentecostals yes the old-fashioned salvation army and many other groups there amen oh yeah their lives they went forth walked in the light as he was in the light amen and they were reflecting the light amen are you reflecting the light for this hour and for this age amen and brother it goes beyond yo we're going to reflect what luther had wesley had and then the others that amen but we're going on to reflect the bright age only in this hour and what are we going to reflect oh oh healing oh that's good praise the lord amen but god gave us all that revelation amen what for to increase our faith to believe for the rapture not just a healing of the body as it were from sickness but brother it is it is to heal the body completely from time to eternity so that we become eternal sons and daughters of god we're in eternal bodies amen that will never die by the grace of oh god help us amen god help us in this hour brother they were approaching the message in the right way by the grace of god again i preached on some years ago concerning the four approaches to the message almost that based on oh job and what job experience amen when job went into this job experienced this amen and there were these four that came and judged to judge job oh job is this job is that job is that amen so brother make sure we got the right approach to the message amen brother there are those that that are approaching the message this way this way this is the message this is the message this is what god has done this is what god is doing amen but they're focusing on the past what about the present because the messenger is gone amen oh we got the message yeah but what's it doing to you yeah what's the message doing to you what's the message doing to me amen what what kind of faith is it giving faith comes by hearing the word amen and they heard the word and they got the faith of justification god the faith of sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but what faith is god giving us now brother i trust we got the faith that pleases god in this hour amen it's not what he gave and and it pleased me in previous ages what's he what pleases him now oh just believe god this is our faith even the devil believes god i said the devil got more faith than god more belief in god than even so could be a lot of believers oh yeah almost definitely oh yeah god was it's real to the devil yeah yeah and satan satan knows the word why he's come down with great breath knowing his time is short amen do we know our time is short air on the earth and we're going into a rapture satan knew that he was moving into judgment god's going to judge him amen so brother so i trust by grace that we got the faith god is rapturing us amen not that he will he is understand it it's in the present tense god help us amen to

of of the manifestations of god the major manifestations of god but it's one god amen whether whether he's revealing himself as the father where he's revealing himself to us as a son or the holy ghost amen just for just no know this we we need the revelation of our father we need the revelation of his sonship to redeem us back and we need the revelation of the holy ghost amen the power of the resurrection praise the lord that he is sharing with us amen because it's ordained to take us back praise the lord brother and sister god permitted all this to happen so that he could reveal this he could reveal his nature he'll bring out what's in us amen so that we're going to love him not because we've got to we're going to love him because of our nature when we're born again amen and that's what he that's what he wants he don't want you to love him just because you feel you've got to love him no he wants your loving because it's your nature now amen you've been born again amen you're a new creature in christ amen a son and daughter of god and if you got his nature well god is love and if you've got his nature you've got love praise your love amen your nature is going to be loving amen praise the name of the lord amen you're not going to hold yourself against against this one or against that one as i said before don't look down your noses at that one and that one down and just leave them with the lord move on and pray for them oh yeah plead the token oh yeah jesus was kind to too many back there even on the cross yeah he said lord forgive them for they know not what they do amen what he wasn't seeking vengeance no no no brother he was absolutely revealed as a redeemer amen are we absolutely revealing our nature as the redeemed amen it's one thing to be a redeemer but brother are you experiencing the redemption amen praise the lord so i pray grace amen if we're experiencing redemption then brother we appreciate the redeemer amen we love the redeemer we thank you lord that you redeem us and especially when we consider what you did to redeem us oh lord it wasn't just you come and just did this work or did that work oh lord you came and you experienced pain suffering agony amen and you laid down your life for us yeah lord all the judgment that that we deserve you took it amen to bring us back again praise the name of the lord hallelujah so things by grace what was it it was the word in the beginning come to redeem the word that had fallen into sin amen so again again in john 1 1 in the beginning was the word hallelujah and the word was with god and the word was god amen not three persons one god amen all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen nothing in him was life and the life was the light of men no wonder he said he was the light of the world and now he's coming you and me to make us the light of the world amen god help us that we're going to amen we're going to shine forth as the light as he did oh yeah amen oh jesus was this jesus was that but remember jesus came back to dwell in us so that we're we're going to have his nature oh my brother sister we're going to oh that was jesus that was jesus yeah but now he wants to look at us and say that's my son that's my daughter so oh yeah because brother sister as oh he judged sin for us just just by us he's going to judge the world amen is life in us amen his word is through that he's going to judge the world amen as i said there was there that that vision or something that that the brother had of a vision of in eternity and he was judged being judged and and the lord said this you didn't do this you didn't do this you didn't believe this you didn't believe that he said wait your lord he said i didn't hear nothing about this i didn't know this didn't know that and he said you didn't tell me and the lord said wait and he said god caused him to look up into the into the heavens oh and and and he said like a big screen appeared and oh we would call it he must have been shown a video no it was a vision and he looked up and in the vision he he saw himself this this man that he was judging he saw him see he says that's you all right oh okay see this one over here he said that's the one that was witnessing to you and you wouldn't believe it and he saw it amen brother i pray god that brother god can can raise us upon the screen amen so that your life your attitude your actions your reactions that god by that it's going to be in the anointing of the holy ghost in you the anointing of christ amen and by it god can will judge others not that you want to judge others that's in the hands of god amen but you're going to go forth and live the life amen by the grace of almighty god you're going to go forth and reflect jesus you're going to reflect his attitude are you reflecting jesus attitude are you reflecting jesus spirit are you reflecting jesus anointing amen jesus character god help us that we're going to die more and more and more to ourselves amen and the old nature that we were born with so that we're going to yield more and more by the holy ghost to the nature of jesus amen so it's not me that lives all praise the lord it's christ that liveth in me amen so did he did jesus live out your life today is that is that the anointing that you manifested is that the spirit that you that you revealed and you you manifested oh you experienced this well how did you react was it you reacting your own nature or was it jesus oh brother what a challenge it is to our faith by the time of being may be made a new creature in christ jesus so that it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me amen so brother in all that you experience brother the reaction is jesus reacting amen you're going to respond it's going to be jesus responding whether it's your thoughts your words your deeds it's jesus amen so god help us to have that right spirit and god help us to have that right anointing god also had that experience amen wherein it is jesus living in you you've been born again amen and if you're born again you're born with his nature oh so is that where you manifest now is nature amen to family friends and neighbors amen there are those that oh my that they'll look at you and and they'll know if you're a christian or not well yeah they'll know about you by your spirit and your attitude and your actions and so on and it's it's like the brother that one time went into a bank and and and the teller there was talking to they got talking about faith and religion and so on and the teller said well what you you believe this you believe that who in the world is your pastor and they said oh my pastor is this and my pastor's dance what now the teller's a lot i know that person and no way they don't they don't seem like a pastor to me because boy they felt that their spirit wasn't wasn't like a pastor's spirit should be their attitude wasn't like a pastor's attitude should be amen their actions reactions amen brother sister i pray the grace of god that we go forth and they're not going to be able to condemn you amen don't know what no but in a negative way you know because you've got negative attitudes negative spirit reactions negative ideas never thoughts no way no way no not by any means but they're going to they're going to see a different spirit and a different attitude in you amen they're going to say why because you're reflecting jesus amen you're gonna have the attitude jesus said you're gonna have the spirit that jesus said amen oh yeah well the disciples were gonna condemn jesus because of his attitude toward the scribes and pharisees and so on amen but jesus in the grace that he was showing his disciples he was showing to the scribes and pharisees oh yeah he knew who they were he knew if they could believe or not but yet he was extending grace to them brother god help us to add that grace to family friends and neighbors we're not there to condemn when they're they're the judge we're not there to put down amen we're there to get them to look up amen to encourage them by the grace of god amen so and yet there's a lot of so-called believers and because of their attitude and spirit or the family looks down on them not only because why because they're there to condemn this and condemn this and condemn this brother if you're if you're a christian you're there to reflect jesus amen and if you're going to reflect jesus oh my what a spirit you're going to have what anointing you're going to have amen you're going to reflect the word you're going to point them to the word amen amen and you're going to reflect the love of god they'll know even if maybe you might disagree with this disagree with that but they'll know that you have us you have a loving spirit you have a loving attitude i know that they don't agree with this they don't agree with that but i know they got love they won't hurt you amen so god help us to keep a right attitude and the right spirit stay with the word but keep your attitude right in your spirit rate amen by the grace of god jesus was there brother o praise the lord his attitude is spirit was the attitude and spirit of redemption he wanted to redeem them amen hallelujah so i pray that grace of god that we want by the grace of god but the witness we give to bring them to redemption for the glory of god brother we want to start with faith but then we got to move to sight and god wants to make that that faith flesh in us amen it's not just thoughts in your head and feelings you know in my mind and so on that you can't explain no no faith faith is going to be the life of god faith is going to be the word of god yes but he's not there to condemn you he's there to encourage you amen with the word so again i'm not sure what what verse it was let's go to verse 3 concerning the word and he said all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and it was eternal life and the life was the light of men amen you've got eternal light life you've got light amen the light of god and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not and there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light amen he was said to reflect that light amen and so we are also of course now through the baptism of the holy ghost we also become the light the light was with us the light is in us amen moving us on to eternity by the grace of god amen and he said that was the true light which light of every man that cometh into the world and he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not amen he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave a power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god amen and then it says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us got news the word is made flesh again and dwells among us the word is made flesh and dwelt in us amen and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen trusting that we have that grace and we have that truth in us amen a confirmation a witness the word made flesh in you the word may flesh in me amen and if it's truly flesh in us amen brother we got grace and we got the truth by the grace of god turn with me to john chapter 5 amen to reflect the light of the world is to reflect jesus to reflect the light of the world is to reflect his word amen because the word is light and in him is no darkness at all john chapter 5 and beginning to read at verse 14. after where jesus findeth them in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest the worst thing come unto thee amen he has redeemed you the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole and there did the jews persecute jesus therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day his spirit was right his attitude was right but again they were judging him by the letter of the word amen because he did this on the sabbath day and jesus answered them my father worker the other two and i work and therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he had not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god grace lord that we're going to make ourselves equal with god because the word was made flesh in christ and christ has made flesh in you and me amen by the grace of god hallelujah and brother i've highlighted even this concerning the sabbath here to certain of people that i know of that believe in a saturday sabbath and that you got to you got to keep saturday sabbath not sunday and so on so i've expressed to them i said well i said one of the reasons they crucified jesus was because he broke their sabbath and they said what i said yes i said the sabbath you're trying to get us to keep i said i said jesus broke it amen and i said oh i want to let you know too and i said it's not sunday no no i said you cease from your dead works of sin not one day a week you cease from your dead works of sin seven days a week amen and you enter into god's sabbath i said our lord jesus christ amen oh never heard that before well i said you've heard it now amen and that's the truth amen so brother sister i trust we're we're experiencing god's sabbath amen that we are in his sabbath seven days a week why because we cease from our dead works of sin seven days a week amen by the grace of god praise the name of the lord hallelujah so brother sister i pray grace god help us with our faith to move to sight and that will go from faith to experience amen now we've got faith but they got no experience no no only oh yeah i believe this that's the letter of the word i believe this i believe that and but it's all in their heads but brother god is in the heart amen the law was all for the law the old testament it was mainly on you know in their heads it was the letter of the word and so on don't do this don't do this don't do that you got to do this do this do this but jesus came amen to put the power and the anointing of the world of the life on the inside in their hearts so brother sisters not that they had to go by the letter the word oh i got to do this i got to do this i can't do this i can't do that no no now because you're born again it's your nature amen it's the nature of god in you it is the nature of jesus in you amen and by the grace of god you're going to go forth and bring forth the word and the will of god you're going to go forth and stay with the word of god amen you're going to go forth and be a witness of the will of god for the hour and for the age in which you're living amen brothers night to go and when just witness her oh yeah yesterday yesterday yesterday this this god did this god did that what is god doing amen and what will god do amen again for for religion around the world is mainly focusing on what god did but but how many are caught up with what god is doing how many are really into the revelation of what god is doing oh yeah they got a revelation of what god did back down down through the ages but what about what god doing now brother amen don't mind there was a time when god did this and and he was looking for the faith of of this this son or this daughter to believe what he was doing in their day and in the hour because again you read hebrews 11 it is by faith that abel often offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice amen why because according to the hour that he was living in according to the the day he was living amen according to the will of god for that hour amen he add the revelation of the will of god amen back there and brother what he did he went out and offered this sacrifice it was based on his faith it was based on what god had revealed to abel amen brother what cain did wasn't based on the revelation of god in cain's heart and soul not by any means because god didn't require what cain had there amen but brother i tell you this god required what evil at amen came oh yeah maybe we would appreciate what cain had oh this is wonderful hallelujah oh my we we got enough here uh that we can go live on this now for the next few days maybe live on it for a few weeks or whatever why because cain had made a sacrifice there of all the things that he grew growed on a farm amen but here's abel down there as i've said before here's abel down there at his altar amen abel what are you going to do abel you took this lamb you killed it you shed his blood and his blood is all over you and his blood is all over over the altar to cain it was a mess amen but to to to abel it was redemption amen to abel it was salvation oh my brother and sister and the stand that we take and brother and the separation that it brings us when it comes to the word amen we take our stand for the word and brother we let the word have control and the word brings us to a soul to separation from unbelief amen because god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen praise the lord brother whether regardless of the age which the word is revealed brother i tell you this those that believed it were totally separated from unbelief amen brother amazing how that when god when god where god revealed it to what to john wesley or martin luther rather when god revealed to him another amen it served him from unbelief oh yeah it separated him from the church that he was associated with it's not that he had anything against the church he took his stand for the word and when they challenged him concerning what he was preaching concerning what he was saying about the just shall live by faith oh luther we're going to do this we're going to do that and son don't do this don't you do that don't you don't you say this and luther said here i can stand i can do no other may god help me amen that's right and so and they threatened they weren't going to kill him but luther just walked out amen and of course we know that some of the soldiers there took luther and hid him away why because they wanted to save his life but he was taking his stand for the word for that hour amen and he walked on and the lutherans they walked on with that revelation until amen until god gave another revelation and they they added that to the word of god amen it was god heading to his word god revealed his word justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost gifts of the spirit amen and now the revelation the word to give us faith for the rapture amen faith for the resurrection because that's the hour we're living we're not we're not living in lutheran luther's age or wesley's age or the pentecostal age amen we're living in a bright age amen and brother and what god requires in this age or just sure he requires justification sure he wants us to believe in sanctification sure he wants us to believe in the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen but what else does he want us to believe he wants us to believe that we're living in the hour of the second coming of the lord and the rapture amen this is the hour that he wants us to look up amen by the grace of god it's not just not just looking to lutheran wesleyan and the pentecostals no no we're looking up for the resurrection and the rapture because what god did in this hour what god did in this age in the ministry of the prophet amen brother it wasn't pointing us to william branham he was pointing us to jesus amen he had come down to receive us all amen he had come down to rapture us oh yeah oh not william brandon no not by any means it was our lord jesus christ amen because brother the ministry that was manifested he didn't do it jesus did it because as he said many times now he said i'm waiting on him because i can't do this yeah amen brother so brother how many of us are waiting on him now amen but not just for these signs and wonders amen discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart do this do this do that amen how many of us are waiting on jesus for the resurrection and the rapture amen because brother they were point they were appointed to jesus in luther's hour and and in colombia columbia rather and and lutheran wesley and and pointing to jesus amen jesus was because they needed this justification they needed sanctification they needed them after the holy ghost they needed the gifts of the spirit but now we need the rapture amen because god has brought us that thus far and god has brought this perfection this perfection amen so what's god looking for now to get amen the perfection of faith to take us into a resurrection perfection of faith take us into the rapture amen and brother like i said it's not just god waiting on us but it's the dead in christ waiting on us amen amen what for the resurrection to get out to get out of those out of those theophany bodies and they get into a glorified body praise the lord and then they're going to appear to the living saints and we're going to be changed amen and go into eternity with them and we're going to rise to meet jesus praise the name of the lord god help us o brother i pray grace that brother that eternity gets more and more real than time when we consider all that's going on in time concerning covert 19. and oh my and brother this is not just america not just canada it's going on around the world and it's affecting every government it's affecting yes every every church amen around the world by the grace of god but what effect is that having on you and me are we going to focus on the government are we going to focus on this church or that church or we're going to focus on jesus amen we better focus on jesus we better look up amen because brother the more we look down the worse it's going to get amen the more we focus on on the natural the worse it's going to look amen but if we can focus on the word amen oh my lord my lord what an hour that we are living lord i pray grace that we're going to see it the way you the way you've revealed it amen we're going to see what really what you are doing and what you will do lord we know you did this we know you did that you know they did something else lord but now what's going on lord amen brother brother if there's anything that he's going to reveal look up my son look up my daughter the hour for further your change has come i want to receive you unto myself i want to receive you into a glorified body so brother how many how many even so-called believers are really really looking looking you've got to be looking for it oh yeah remember god revealed it so much to creating us a hunger and thirst for it amen god revealed justification and he created in luther a hunger and a thirst amen and brother and he satisfied the hunger satisfied the thirst amen and he created a worship and they were praising god for justification praising god for sanctification praising god for the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit and brother the bride ought now to be praising god for the resurrection and the rapture amen because brother the ministry that was manifested hallelujah 2000 years ago that ministry was revealed and manifested again in this hour oh yeah there was no other ministry that came to do that amen like jesus did 2000 years ago no other ministry could do it only the ministry that god ordained for this hour and brother why this why that amen get our attention get our attention get the attention of the bride amen again as let me explain to you concerning what god had done in that ministry and and he did it he ordained predestinated three different phases of that ministry we call it three pools of that ministry amen so what were the three pools one of three pools the first two was what it was ordained to get our get our attention amen why because amen he was ordained amen right from the right from the the cave where the angel met him and ordained him amen that he was to get the people to believe amen and i just believe this the first sign and not just believe in the second sign but to get their attention to believe the word amen because there's anything that we need to do in this hour in this age is to believe the word of god to believe thus saith the lord to believe it is written what for concerning the resurrection and concerning the rapture amen to get out of time and into eternity amen brother so brother is he really oh it's not just or believe this doctrine to believe that doctrine and that doctrine oh yeah we believe that yes brother but but i pray grace that we believe for the rapture oh yeah there's there's the he came and highlighted the revelation of the goddess the revelation of water baptism the revelation of of the gifts of the spirit and so on to give us a greater and a greater understanding that we would keep move on and as mature sons and daughters of god amen but then came that great revelation of the rapture of the resurrection oh my lord help us lord i pray in the name of jesus lord hallelujah that we're going to get more and more and more conscious amen and convicted for the call for the rapture the call for the resurrection and again they're waiting on us please in the name of jesus again like all those that are going on and they're in there right now we know that the body they was in physically is all dust for sure amen and they've gone into those theophany bodies but they're waiting for those glorified bodies and to get into that glorified body they're waiting on you and me amen praise the lord and god is waiting on us to believe for the resurrection to believe for the rapture it's not just believe this doctrine that doctrine this this this idea and that idea amen but it's to believe what god is focusing on in these last days amen we're not here to call for what luther luther was calling for wesley or no no god has given it to us we know that we believe it we're moving on amen or the pentecostals amen brother sister i pray grace that we got the revelation that god has ordained us to the resurrection and the rapture amen anything god's looking for in you anything god's looking for in me is the resurrection and the rapture amen not just the the the doctrine of justification sanctification the gifts of the spirit no brother we ought to we ought to move on now let's go on just think god was increasing all that he did down for the ages oh he increased it increased it increased it of course the enemy was there to bring in the darkness amen but god was there to bring back the light amen amen but there's going to be so few but it's so little light yes but it be and we know that in this last stage when the angel drew this drew this ear the angel came into branham tabernacle when brother branham was preaching on that and the angel came in and went over and he drew it on the wall yeah and the prophet of god said yeah he said when he drew this on the wall he said it was all dark you see it was total darkness and he said i put that there he said just to represent the bride he said but she's going to be so small amen but the churches they're in total darkness spiritually when it comes to the revelation of the will of god for this hour for this age they're in total darkness amen but the bride she's got the light she's got the revelation amen that god is ordained but again we know that according to the scriptures there's going to be very very very little faith when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth i trust mother gracie finding faith in you faith in me for the resurrection faith in you faith in me for the rapture o my lord help us as i said all down through the ages the like lutheran wesley pentecostals brother morning noon and night they couldn't get away from what to them what god was working on oh justification justification said oh praise the lord they were so excited with it they're so thrilled with it amen god has sanctified us god has done this god has done that god is doing this amen get into the resurrection and and and so on oh praise the lord god the baptizer with the holy ghost thank you lord thank you lord you're doing this you're doing that you're the healer amen oh yeah because as as a remember the church went went from light into darkness and then from dark darkness into light amen to get into the resurrection and rapture amen and and the healing oh yeah healing healing healing amen through the pentecostal revival all they really got into god was the healer but then they began to put more and more and more focus on just healing the body they were sick so you we just with these stripes were healed yes but but they didn't go on and on and on to the complete healing change of the body just just heal the body of this sickness heal the body of that sickness and so on yeah but god through the through the message of the hour through the revealed word is taking us on to the right to the faith but for to change our bodies from time to eternity amen to change our bodies from physical yeah what is going to be physical too but but not not under under the curse no no into into eternal from time to eternity amen praise the lord he praise the lord he's going to turn us all back young there won't be an infill of days neither an old man that has not fulfilled his days that's what the bible says praise the lord amen why because we're all going to be turned back to our our just young men and and and women young brothers and sisters amen maybe in our early 20s you know but they're not we're not going to be there's no no not going to be nobody they were gray hair no not by any means amen brother no wrinkles no old age and so on oh this one is a senior citizen that was no no no we were but not will be amen because he is ordained we're going to go into the old will be young there forever amen transformed in a moment of time as it says the bible says there won't be any name man that is not fulfilled if there's an old man and no there won't be an infant of days no no because the baby no matter you know if even are some of the young here you know if they are predestinated and god knows the heart god knows the heart amen brother when we get there oh they're going to be maybe around 20 years old 21 years old amen again it's like the division or the the testimony that i read a few years ago of a i think it was a sister not sure or somebody that they did stepped out of time and they went in went into eternity and when they did they saw this one they saw that one and they saw this person they said were you they said you don't know me no they said well god let them know that back there just to reveal this to her amen he said oh i was your brother she said you were yes but he was he was a a child that died when he was very small but over there he was he was a mature young man you yes he said that's me she's you're only a baby no he said there's no babies there he said this is me now oh yeah no no babies and yet there was a time when you know we thought we were taught that we believe that when we get to heaven or there's going to be old people and there's going to be babies and so on no the old will be young there forever transformed in a moment of time that's right as the bible says there won't be no no man that hasn't fulfilled his days neither infinite days no no praise the lord because the redemption is going to put us back we've got way god wants us amen and we're going to be in glorified bodies by the grace of god so brother i don't know when it comes to recognizing family and friends from here when it comes to recognizing husbands and wives no at least we won't we won't be referred to each other as husbands and wives again as william branham went beyond the curtain of time and he saw all the believers from the hour and the age that he lived in and all of a sudden these two sisters came came running to him oh they said wonderful praise the lord you made it and and they he said what oh they referred to my brother when he realized oh that was that was his wife well he was married twice because his first wife died when they were very young and then then his second wife of course she didn't go on until 1970. they were 71 and there they were but he didn't are they recognizing why because they were young they were much younger and to just maybe around 20 years old 21 years old and so i always said you were there yes she said she said you taught this you told us this you told us this and so on yeah and then finally they told him that he had to go back because he still had something to do amen so brother i think he would be back there now he's in a young body amen by the grace of god so brother sister are you ready to get into that body amen by the grace of god from time to eternity maybe our younger sisters here are going to of course they're going to be a little older than what they are there now our young brothers and young real infants and so on oh yeah i pray the grace of god that they're going to make it i pray the grace of god we're going to make it and i'm going to see them young they're going to see me amazing isn't it what is your faith amen you trip brother it's absolute faith amen faith for me yeah faith for brother bob sister brother praise the lord amen yeah sister betty yeah so when we get there i don't think we're not going to have no gray hair amen and when it comes to all the hair that i've lost we'll find it again yeah i won't have to look for it it'll be there amen oh brother sister we are redeemed we are going to be turned back by the grace of god amen to what god has ordained for us to be by grace amen so oh my sorry did it take so long but brother sister we'll we'll continue on with some of these thoughts lord willing on sunday but brother if there's anything god's doing with us in this hour amen to get us ready to go is getting from faith to sight or we're going from faith to sight let's brother oh well we believe this we believe that yeah that's it by the grace of god if we really truly honestly sincerely believe it amen we're going to step out of time and into eternity amen moving from faith to sight where we what we believe is going to be a reality to us in another dimension and i pray grace now that what we believe concerning the resurrection the rapture is going to become more and more for reality to us more and more real to us yeah oh my lord my lord there's this this brother this sister this one this group this group they're caught up with these natural things oh yeah but it's all physical they identify with it with their sight with their feelings and so on but i but what we're identifying with the resurrection we're identifying with the rapture it is our faith yeah it's revealed to me oh what do you know about this well according to the scriptures faith comes by hearing the word and so it's given god has given me more and more faith concerning the resurrection god has given me more and more faith concerning the rapture he's giving me more and more faith concerning my my new body amen my glorified bodies let's get amen grace amen that god will make eternity more real than time and what we're seeing seeing in time will become less and less to us but what we're seeing eternity is getting more and more real you know because time is fading away you know time is fading now time is really under the judgment of god amen and that's why he said when the son of man come will he find faith on the earth it's going to be so little god help us amen brother we've gone from faith and going from faith to sight we went from sight to faith but now we're going from faith to sight amen by the grace of god amen god god's bringing us some sight from our feelings from our flesh amen to our faith or what god has revealed what the word says we believe we believe we believe but then there's come in an hour and come in a day brother when we will be the word we will be it will be made flesh in us may flesh in you the reality of the resurrection the reality of the rapture amen not a fairy tale no more no god help us brother brother god took luther from justification spiritually to soul body and spirit he was justified sanctified amen the baptism of the holy ghost amen their pentecostals experienced that anointing soul body and spirit amen they experience those gifts soul body and spirit but now the bride is coming into the revelation of the rapture soul body and spirit brother i trust we're going beyond the spirit beyond the soul we're getting it's going to get more and more real to us hallelujah until it changes us from time to eternity it changes us into glorified bodies by the grace of god god help us we as the prophet said we are in a changing dispensation amen and not just changing as it were we were changed from from from sinners to saints yes amen but we're now being changed from time to eternity eternity in control let me share with you these thoughts that he expressed in one of the last messages that he preached december the 4th 1965. now and two weeks later god called him home yeah and this message was the rapture and really he's highlighting the conditions for the rapture amen brother god help us to highlight the conditions to go from time to eternity amen he said it's really nice to be here and i guess those don't sound like jokes but sense of humor he said which the lord himself had a sense of humor you know and he referred to herod and he said go tell that fox of course in that day it was it was a joke referring to eric as a fox yeah and he said go tell that fox and so on and he said he had a sense of humor and he said when i was a little boy he said i used to come out to listen because i was a boy preacher just a young fellow a chap and you know he said just a kid went through school no education and they come to hear my broken words my kentucky english amen it's like i expressed to one of brother brown's sons one time when they were translating uh certain messages from the tapes and and they and a certain message there brother brown said this said this and this and when i listen it on tape oh it's different so i had to i emailed them and i said i just want to let you know i said as brother gerald lost i said every newfoundland he said i i said i'm a bay person and i said sometimes i said i talked like a bayman and i used bayman's words and i said i want you to understand that the prophet of god was a kentucky hillbilly and i said sometimes i said he used kentucky hillbilly words and not regular normal english words and i highlighted a certain paragraph there in this one of the books where they had they had translated what he said and i said that's not right i said you didn't you didn't put the right word in i said he said this and this is what he meant sorry and and i said so this is the word that you should put in and then in the next paragraph i said this is what he said there i said this is a word you should put i said there was a kentucky ill belly and i said a kentucky ill believed that he was using and this is what it meant and of course they said thank you and they changed it because they understood then that it what he was saying amen so brother because why brother regardless of who you are what you are god's going to god's going to make you a witness oh yeah where whether if you're a new flander you'll be witness as a new flander would you're going to be a this this person or that person that's the way god's going to use you as a witness god help us but there that will stay with the word amen regardless if you say it this way or i say it that way it's going to be the same thing amen the same revelation and he said you know he said i he said i speak kentucky english and he said and oh my hits and hates my totes and carry and so on so he said uh so now he said after you get you got older and he said you've got to have something more than that when i was a child i spake as a child and i thought as a child amen but as he matured of course he made it more and more clear to them and now he said it's time to walk straight line right down that highway to glory and i said i do believe that we are living in the closing scenes of this of the history of this world i truly believe that the coming of the lord is closer perhaps than we think and concerning all that's been going on in the world in the covet 19 issue it is another witness we're at the end it's finished it's finished no more revivals gone the next as i said the next revival will be to the jews but god is finished with the gentiles amen he said there is too much supernatural vindication of god's written word of this hour for something not to be approaching us now and he said see he said it would be astounding to you just to let you know what is really taking place he saw what we didn't see he saw what that generation didn't see and we as believers we are seeing what the generation is not seeing rather they're hoping that this is going to happen they're hoping that that's going to happen it's going to change like this change like that but you and i know that it's the end it's the finish amen and he said listen he said many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up and make these remarks about a message of this hour and he said what they are getting at is god's promise of this hour it's what god is saying amen and he said there's one chance out of 10 million he said if a man told you a certain thing would happen it would happen at a certain time and he said then he said the place it would happen and he said one chance out of about a hundred million and he said then he said the time it would happen and he said it goes on and on and on and the way it will happen so when we see it so perfectly each and every time turn we then we turn right back to the scriptures back to the word amen and he said and the holy spirit brings out and just puts the whole word together and makes a picture he said just to show the hour that we are living we are changing dispensations amen why he said we are at a corner amen everybody laying bricks right down the same row like a certain denomination starts and starts rolling down the roll it's all right but when you get to them turns where you have to turn back the other way he said god isn't building a wall he said god is building a house but down through the ages when god started a certain revival they just kept on going but brother they had to go and turn amen another revival then go and turn another revival now they just kept on going and even in this hour they kept on going with the pentecostal revival and it just became a denomination yeah but god moved on beyond it all to the bride revival and i pray grace whether that we're not going to just continue on in her bride revival this way with this doctrine this doctrine the prophet said this the prophet said that well now let's move on to the rapture amen move on so that brother sister what god is going to give us the faith that he that he wants us to have knowing that but the faith you need for the rapture and many of us got faith for the rapture that means got faith for the resurrection and many of her many of us are really really angry and thirsting for the resurrection and the rapture remember luther was hungry and thirsting for justification wesley was angry and thirsty for sanctification and others as well and pentecostals were hung and thirsting for the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen but brother what are we hungry and thirsting for all those ages that come and they're all gone amen oh yeah because the revival is not there like it used to be in in luther it's not there like it used to be in wesley or the or the though the old-fashioned army or the pentecostals i tell you the revival is not there like it used to be among the bride believers 50 years ago when god first sent the prophet oh yeah well they were all excited they're all running after william brandon running there running there amen but god he laid in the word and god took him why because they were focusing on him but not on the word god help us to focus on the word amen and brotherless god help us to focus on the faith that the word is ordained to give us brother it's not just to get us to believe this believe this oh yeah thank god he revealed this doctrine he revealed this mystery this mystery brother brother all of it is to move on to the resurrection move on to the rapture because that's the next thing god wants to do for the gentile world after he takes the bride out you'll go on to the jews yeah god help us remember he said god isn't building a wall god is building a house so he goes down and turns goes down and turns goes down and turns amen pray graciously amen that god was working on us working on us i pray grace that he's he's bringing forth the bride amen in his image to bride so god is building a house and there's many cuts and turns that he's predicted here in the bible and he said it must be according to the blueprint if it isn't it's got to be torn down again amen why it's god building the house of the word building the house of the bride by the grace of god amen and he prayed he said we praise god for his goodness and the fellowship of you people and the open doors that the lord has given us and i've always contended that he said i believe in the people in denominations but he said i don't have much time to exhort denominations because each one builds a fence around himself amen i believe it's brother david little saying about well he was raising some ducks and said the river came up and each duck you know that wanted fellowship with one another they couldn't do it because they was all fenced up but when the water got so high it just floated the ducks out of the pen i think that's the way to do it he said the water is coming up and we and what is it the water the reveal word amen and he said we can get out of the pen fellowship with one another and you know i have the real love of christ in our hearts how many got that baptism of divine love grace let me try to finish right here he said i don't stay right in your church and scatter out light he said be a real christian and he said a real loyal genuine saint any man that believes in god will appreciate a person like that have a right attitude a right spirit a right motive and a right objective the will of god for your life amen then he goes on to say and he goes into the book of psalms that we we read and he said i want to speak on a real strange subject amen he said the subject of the rapture and we believe that there will be a rapture god help us luther he focused on on what god gave him wesley focused on what god gave him the pentecostal focused on what god had given them what are we focusing on now well the lutherans are not focusing really not now but they did back then four or five hundred years ago and the methodists and the old-fashioned salvation army they focused on what god had given them back back in that day but certainly not focusing on it now and the pentecostals the restoration of the gift the baptist the holy ghost they're not focusing on it like they used to as i said i was born and raised in the salvation army and moving here into saint john's we eventually ended up in the pentecostal church and i was with pentecost for a number of years but i tell you not it's not the pentecost that i was a part of back then no no it's become so cool and so denominational but where is the revival well it's moved on to the bride amen amen we believe we believe what god did what god did now we believe what god's doing amen so what what is god doing he's give he's separating us separating the bride and he's getting the bride together in the in the reveal word to give us rapturing faith to get out of here and then he goes back to the jews he left israel came to the gentiles now he's leaving the gentiles going back to israel amen that's according to the word that's the promise god help us brother that we're going to respond to what god has done and what god's doing to the gentiles to give us the resurrection to give us the rapturing faith that we need amen to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and cut into eternity how many really really want to go and he read again the psalms 27 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid let's respect god let's respect his word let's respect what god's doing redemption is in what god is doing what he done yes but now what he's doing god help us he said when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to heat up my flesh they stumble and fell though the hole shouldn't be again about me my heart shall not fear and the war would rise against me in this will i be confident it says one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life god help us to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple amen for the time of trouble shall he hide me in the pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and set me up on a rock grace grace lord to increase our faith in what you've done and what you're doing to increase our faith to believe for the truly truly believe for the resurrection truly believe for the rapture amen grace of god to us keep pressing on by the grace of god amen god bless you let's stand praise the lord

change so we can get all the saints together again in the assembly but there's still a problem because then they'll want us to we're not doing it now then they want us to sit six feet apart i don't know if we can do that no we really have to go and get another church so we'll see what the lord will do amen but things are going to get they're going to get more and more real like that because god
