[13:47] Sister Mary Beth is recovering but she's

[13:56] she came home sick today and uh she's
[14:00] got to have surgery for tooth removal
[14:03] tomorrow so I just want to remember her
[14:06] as well also I had a request from uh
[14:09] brother Adam
[14:11] uh his nephew so was Sister Jam's nephew
[14:16] uh Gabriel Herdman 6 years old he U he
[14:21] was suffering
[14:23] from severe headaches I guess but there
[14:26] was pains in his head that he was having
[14:29] and he was out uh with the family at a
[14:32] function and then when they left they
[14:34] were coming to their uh car and he just
[14:37] stopped because his legs just froze and
[14:40] he was uh like they were paralyzed so uh
[14:46] he's and so he's still suffering from It
[14:47] Whatever It Is they don't know I guess
[14:49] doctors are looking at that so uh we
[14:52] were asked to pray for him as well he's
[14:55] only 6 years old and uh his body started
[14:59] started to just stiffen up and he can't
[15:01] move he can't move his legs also uh I
[15:06] got a call from Brother
[15:08] Dale and brother Dale uh he said to me
[15:12] he said to me you remember he said when
[15:14] uh I was diagnosed with uh with prostate
[15:18] cancer he said um I had to test and you
[15:23] know the normal like it was for PSA
[15:25] right it's the blood test to check the
[15:28] prostate
[15:29] and uh he said uh well we well we know
[15:33] that the I think the normal range is
[15:36] around 10 the number 10 give or take
[15:39] depending on the age and all that but
[15:41] it's in that range anyway his count was
[15:43] 200 and so that triggered uh of course
[15:46] that triggered action on the doctor's
[15:48] part and that sort of thing and kind of
[15:50] medication things then he went and U
[15:54] before he left he had another uh blood
[15:57] test for PSA to see how that was going
[15:59] and it went up to 250 so he was going in
[16:02] the wrong
[16:03] direction so on Saturday pass he he went
[16:07] into a walk-in clinic that um was
[16:11] offering uh was offering PSA test for uh
[16:16] men between the age of 40 and 70 he said
[16:18] well I think I'll try that so he went in
[16:20] and got a blood test and he just got the
[16:23] results he's down to
[16:26] 41 that's what he said and that's what
[16:29] we're all saying is praise the Lord that
[16:32] that was just um it just wonderful he
[16:34] didn't even call his family first I
[16:36] don't know if I should say it I over
[16:37] here he called me right away he said I
[16:40] want everybody to know he said I want
[16:41] the Saints to know so uh anyway we thank
[16:45] the Lord for that and I said we're going
[16:47] to keep praying for you and uh I assured
[16:50] him of that and he's just so delighted I
[16:52] mean you couldn't pick him off the
[16:53] ceiling if he tried so uh we we just
[16:56] thank the Lord for that Lord so uh
[16:59] that's the God we serve and those are
[17:01] the announcements I like to make by the

[44:02] you
[44:03] know brother Garfield's going to take a
[44:05] service here in the not too distant
[44:06] future Lord willing but he was saying
[44:08] brother John I can't take Wednesdays
[44:11] because classes finish at 6 and I can't
[44:13] even get to church much less get there
[44:15] to preach and so what they did is
[44:17] somehow they worked it out that they
[44:18] move his class backwards an hour so now
[44:20] he can make it to church on Wednesday
[44:22] night sometimes if he's not working so I
[44:24] say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen
[44:26] we if we have a sincere desire I believe
[44:30] God gives us those desires amen
[44:32] especially as it relates to doing what
[44:34] his word asks us to do amen that's good
[44:36] and good to see sister Nikki here as
[44:37] well she hasn't been feeling well for
[44:39] past week or so so we're very thankful
[44:41] to see her as well God bless you amen I
[44:44] spoke with brother Barry coffee before
[44:45] service and he has confirmed he'll be
[44:47] here for Saturday February 22 and Sunday
[44:51] February 23 so he's going to do uh the
[44:54] Saturday with the married couples it's
[44:56] primarily L intended for those of us
[44:58] that still have children and whatnot
[45:00] maybe going through the the the the
[45:02] trying times still but anyone that's
[45:05] married is certainly welcome to come
[45:07] along and do that so we'll have two
[45:09] sessions probably from 10: till 12: and
[45:11] then 2: to 4:00 and we'll have a nice
[45:13] lunch in between Lord willing but we'll
[45:15] confirm those those times as we get
[45:17] closer to it and then he'll also preach
[45:19] the Sunday service and then we'll have a
[45:21] fellowship as well so sister Amber I
[45:23] believe is going to be leading that
[45:24] Fellowship planning so sister she'll be
[45:26] reaching out to you um just to confirm
[45:29] the deacons wives are handling the the
[45:31] standard church fellowships and they'll
[45:33] be alternating so sister Amber will take
[45:35] the first one sister Priscilla the
[45:36] second one and back and forth and so
[45:38] they have my full Authority they have my
[45:40] full support please support them in
[45:42] whatever way they ask you to do it and
[45:44] it'll make everyone's lives easier amen
[45:46] God bless you 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[45:49] and
[45:50] 12 very familiar scripture he says for
[45:54] as the body is one and had many members
[45:57] and all the members of that one body
[45:59] being many are one body so also is
[46:02] Christ Paul's taking a an example here
[46:04] of our own body and how we've got all
[46:06] these different parts in our body and
[46:07] yet together they still make up one body
[46:09] and the fact that they're different
[46:11] doesn't make them any less a part of the
[46:13] body then he says this this beautiful
[46:15] scripture that we've referenced so many
[46:17] times he says for by one Spirit are we
[46:19] all baptized into one body so the only
[46:22] way you can get into this body of Christ
[46:24] is by the Holy Spirit that's the thing
[46:26] that binds us together amen that's the
[46:28] thing that keeps us together that's the
[46:29] thing that keeps us working together and
[46:31] it's a holy spirit that does this
[46:34] placing this positioning that gives us
[46:36] our part in the body of Christ amen it
[46:38] is not our choosing it is his choosing
[46:41] is not our placing it's his placing it's
[46:43] not our timing it's his timing it's all
[46:46] done by him he says so whether we be
[46:48] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[46:50] free and have been all made to drink
[46:53] into one spirit for the body is not one
[46:56] member but many amen God bless you you
[46:58] can have your seats this evening we're
[47:00] continuing our series on the Holy Ghost
[47:02] and and perhaps we'll be happy to know
[47:04] we moved on from that question we
[47:06] preached on six services on how do I
[47:08] know I have received the Holy Spirit and
[47:11] hopefully we've settled some things and
[47:13] and and answered some questions but
[47:15] really we wanted to to show there the
[47:17] progression of the Walk of a child of
[47:18] God Amen that getting the holy spirit is
[47:21] just really the start of this and then
[47:23] from there you grow and you mature and
[47:25] there's a work that the Holy Spirit does
[47:27] and so we can't expect to be everything
[47:28] that we read in our Bible on the first
[47:30] day amen but we grow as children in
[47:33] Christ and we grow up into mature adults
[47:35] and God never expects us to be
[47:38] everything right up front and if you
[47:40] want some some evidence for that just go
[47:42] read your Bible because you'll see there
[47:45] especially as we're under the New
[47:46] Covenant the New Testament Paul does not
[47:48] talk about everything as if it was in
[47:50] the past as in you got the Holy Ghost
[47:53] and now everything's in the past you
[47:54] don't fight you don't struggle you don't
[47:56] have to grow you don't have things that
[47:58] God has to deal with in your life but
[48:00] rather you see there in the scriptures
[48:02] that Paul you know we're reading in
[48:03] Corinthians Corinthians was the church
[48:05] that needed the greatest instruction it
[48:06] seems and like I said last service or
[48:08] the service before we all have a little
[48:10] bit of Corinthians in us we've got areas
[48:12] that we need to to to bring into
[48:14] subjection and God's got to mature us
[48:15] he's got to beat some things out and
[48:17] he's got to put some things in and so
[48:19] you see people that were newborns in
[48:21] Christ you have people that were sincere
[48:23] raised in a good home that were were
[48:25] raised under the message of the power
[48:27] and came right into this truth as it was
[48:28] revealed in these different things you
[48:30] have people that were atheists you had
[48:32] people that were perverted you have
[48:33] people from all sorts of Lifestyles and
[48:35] backgrounds and the Bible addresses
[48:37] every single one of them amen and it it
[48:40] shows us that we have to grow in Grace
[48:43] in God now last service we focused on
[48:46] the fruit of the spirit and we spoke how
[48:47] the fruit of the spirit is primarily
[48:49] meant for others mine's meant for yours
[48:51] yours is meant for Mine mine's not
[48:53] really meant for mine and yours is not
[48:54] really meant for you but it's a
[48:56] sacrifice and it's an offering that we
[48:58] give to people that pass our way and
[49:00] that God brings our way more to the
[49:02] point because really when we think about
[49:04] it most of us don't like our fruit being
[49:05] picked it doesn't feel good in that
[49:07] sense that's what I mean by that it
[49:08] doesn't feel good to have somebody eat
[49:10] your your patience or or your long
[49:12] suffering or these different things but
[49:14] we're meant to be able to absorb things
[49:16] that other people can't because of the
[49:18] holy spirit inside of us amen but I want
[49:20] to move forward from the the fruit of
[49:23] the spirit now to start talking about
[49:25] the gifts of the Spirit because while
[49:27] these gifts are not the evidence of the
[49:29] holy spirit in our personal lives yet
[49:31] they have been given to the church for
[49:33] its benefit and for its health and for
[49:36] its growth amen they are there they're
[49:38] part of the body of Christ today they
[49:40] have not gone away just because they may
[49:42] not be here doesn't mean they've gone
[49:44] away but they are in the bride they are
[49:46] available and they are for our good all
[49:49] the gifts are there for for for our good
[49:51] Amen brother Brandon would point to
[49:53] every gift and so often it was the
[49:55] Divine Healing but he would say all the
[49:57] gifts are available to the church
[49:59] tonight and we'll read even where he
[50:00] says things like this but I want to take
[50:02] us to the start of 1 Corinthians 12 here
[50:05] it's already there there we go and it
[50:07] says now there are diversities of gifts
[50:10] now these are what we would call Grace
[50:13] gifts they are spiritual gifts of the
[50:15] holy spirit there's nine of them but
[50:17] there's many varieties and types amen
[50:19] but catch this now nobody has them all
[50:23] no one has everything because otherwise
[50:25] they would be a body unto themselves and
[50:29] that's a
[50:30] denomination we don't want that amen but
[50:32] and God doesn't want it that way but
[50:34] they are there are diversities of gift
[50:36] there's different types but it's the
[50:37] same spirit and that word spirit in the
[50:39] original is the same breath the same
[50:41] life so in other words the gifts are
[50:44] alive by the spirit they're not alive by
[50:47] me they're not alive by you but it's the
[50:48] working of the power of God the
[50:50] spiritual gifts these nine spiritual
[50:52] gifts are meant to be operated by the
[50:54] Holy Spirit not by me and not by you
[50:58] amen they're not ours they're his
[50:59] they're meant to express the kingdom of
[51:01] God they're meant to help the kingdom of
[51:04] God and so we can't change how those
[51:07] gifts work but you look around today and
[51:10] especially you see in Pentecost they
[51:11] have changed the way many of these gifts
[51:13] work because they're using them rather
[51:15] than being used to employ them in the
[51:17] body and brother Brandon would spend a
[51:19] great deal of time trying to correct
[51:21] especially the Pentecostal church about
[51:23] this because the holy spirit always
[51:25] works according to the word it's not
[51:28] according to my will or my feeling or
[51:30] what's going to work or what you think
[51:31] will work but it's by his and I saw an
[51:34] example maybe to to share this this
[51:36] evening that I saw a man that was a
[51:37] so-called prophet and he was wanting to
[51:40] exhibit this this gift that he had so he
[51:42] said I want you to look at this water
[51:44] bottle and he he called somebody up from
[51:46] the the the the congregation he says I
[51:48] want you to look at this bottle is it
[51:49] sealed it was a water bottle it was
[51:51] clear he says I want you to look at this
[51:53] is this a sealed water bottle the man
[51:54] said yes he says now watch this and he
[51:57] he prayed and he said some words that
[51:58] sounded very spiritual in these things
[52:00] and and he said gave it to the man he
[52:02] says now break the cap and taste it and
[52:05] the man tastes it he says how's it taste
[52:06] he says it tastes sweet and he said see
[52:09] I just turned the water into
[52:13] wine didn't change
[52:15] color he didn't taste it before and
[52:18] after he just drank it and he said it
[52:20] taste sweet so when we look at that and
[52:23] we compare it to the gift that was in
[52:25] the Bible how did Jesus turn water into
[52:29] wine he didn't do it in
[52:31] public he didn't do it to make a big
[52:33] kafuffle cuz this guy did it and of
[52:35] course the whole church blew up because
[52:36] everyone believed he just turned water
[52:37] into wine but Jesus did it in secret and
[52:41] he didn't just changed the taste of the
[52:43] water he changed it into wine it changed
[52:47] its chemical composition its color its
[52:49] taste it tasted like aged wine it was
[52:52] the best wine that they had at that
[52:54] thing but this guy sits here stands
[52:57] there and he makes this big Grand
[52:58] gesture and he's he's trying to mimic
[53:01] what Jesus did and when we take that
[53:04] gift and we compare it to the word the
[53:06] only conclusion we can come up with is
[53:08] false prophet because he's not working
[53:11] the gift is not working the way the
[53:13] spirit did the first time now you look
[53:15] at brother bram's gift and what would he
[53:18] do every time he was doing the gift the
[53:21] gift was being used in his life he would
[53:23] point you back to scripture so that you
[53:26] could see the god behind the gift rather
[53:29] than get stuck on the man through the
[53:31] gift being operated he would say what
[53:34] did Jesus do what happened when Abraham
[53:37] was sitting in the plains of mammory and
[53:39] this man came and talked to him in the
[53:41] tent he said do you see what it was and
[53:44] when Christ came and he spoke to that
[53:46] woman at the well what was he saying
[53:48] he's saying Christ is using a gift again
[53:52] he wasn't trying to make you believe in
[53:53] him he was trying to make you believe in
[53:55] the god behind him right a son of man
[53:58] revealing the son of man and he was
[54:00] pointing and he was making it perfectly
[54:02] scriptural the sign in the hand he would
[54:04] point to Moses that had the sign in the
[54:07] hand he brought it back to the
[54:09] scriptures so that you could have
[54:10] confidence that it was a scripturally
[54:12] applied gift being used by the Holy
[54:14] Spirit rather than just a man putting on
[54:16] a
[54:17] show Paul continues then and he says now
[54:20] there are differences of
[54:22] administrations this word
[54:23] administrations means Ministries office
[54:27] Services supports and it's in a
[54:29] religious Contex and context and the
[54:31] original phrase there is really
[54:33] inferring the temple duties so these are
[54:36] typically formal uh
[54:38] offices and and the meaning of that word
[54:40] administrations is that they are they
[54:42] are waiting at a table so it is about
[54:45] serving not about
[54:48] Authority it's about serving so it is
[54:51] not for somebody to go out and make
[54:53] themselves something but rather they
[54:55] make you something by serving you we're
[54:58] talking about the work of the Holy
[54:59] Spirit do you see how this ties in with
[55:01] the fruit because if you don't have the
[55:03] fruit you can't be in these gifts
[55:05] because you'll never use them you'll
[55:06] never be used of them appropriately
[55:08] because you'll make it about yourself
[55:09] rather than the person you're trying to
[55:11] help he says so this is difference of
[55:14] administrations Ministries offices but
[55:17] it's the same Lord so notice now he went
[55:19] from The Same Spirit it's all talking
[55:22] the same person church but he says in
[55:24] the first one it's the same spirit that
[55:26] using it now under administrations he
[55:28] says it's the same Lord because why
[55:30] they're under the same chain of command
[55:33] in other words they have to be able to
[55:36] work together you can't be in this
[55:39] portion of the gifts the administrations
[55:42] and not be able to work together because
[55:44] you all answer to the same
[55:45] commander-in-chief you're all under the
[55:47] same general and he doesn't the
[55:49] scripture says he's not the author of
[55:51] confusion he's not the author of chaos
[55:53] and so if you are under his command and
[55:56] I under his command and we're butting
[55:58] heads guess what one of us is wrong or
[56:03] we're both
[56:04] wrong let's not let's not put it on you
[56:06] or you put it on me maybe both of us is
[56:09] wrong but if you can stay in your lane
[56:12] if you can do what you've been commanded
[56:14] to do then nobody gets in anybody else's
[56:17] way and it's a beautiful place to be
[56:20] because everybody's now exactly working
[56:23] at their highest efficiency because
[56:25] shoulder are all put to the wheel rather
[56:28] than one person steering this way and
[56:29] one person steering that way and one
[56:31] going backwards and one going forwards
[56:33] and one trying to go up no it doesn't
[56:35] work that way under the same Lord we are
[56:37] in a chain of command that brings
[56:39] Clarity and efficiency not chaos and
[56:43] confusion and conflict amen so we're
[56:47] working for the same one and he keeps us
[56:49] in
[56:50] harmony then he says in verse six now
[56:53] there are diversities of operations that
[56:56] word means workings or effects today is
[56:58] the the buzzword is what impacts this is
[57:01] there are there are diversities there's
[57:03] difference impacts and it means work any
[57:05] work that's done for the kingdom of God
[57:08] that is effective he says but in all
[57:10] this it's the same God which worketh all
[57:12] in all so it's from God from start to
[57:14] finish verse four verse 5 and six so
[57:17] gifts administrations operations
[57:19] whatever it's been done if it's truly a
[57:21] benefit God is the one that's working in
[57:23] every one of those areas now we look at
[57:26] all of these and so often people will
[57:28] focus on the gifts administrations and
[57:30] operations but Paul's pointing here the
[57:33] key here is not to have an
[57:34] Administration a gift or an operation
[57:36] it's to have the same Spirit that's the
[57:39] only unifying thing that's what makes us
[57:40] a body is you've got the Holy Spirit
[57:43] I've got the Holy Spirit and we're being
[57:45] led by that Holy Spirit remember the
[57:46] Bible says sons of God are led by the
[57:49] spirit of God not just that they have it
[57:51] but they've learned to be led by that
[57:54] thing amen so it's spirit-led not just
[57:56] anointed and we'll see that as we go
[57:58] through and we' preached on it many
[58:00] times anyways so we can have a false a
[58:02] real anointing on a false vessel and so
[58:05] that will lead to to to difficult times
[58:07] for sure because their soul is not in
[58:10] alignment with the word of God there
[58:11] isn't a surrender there and so they're
[58:13] using the gift rather than being led and
[58:16] we see that even amongst this church and
[58:19] any church I guess you know we've got
[58:21] musicians that are here and they play
[58:24] and we're so thankful for them but
[58:26] listen sister Moren I'm going to use
[58:28] your name tonight if we got the greatest
[58:31] piano player in the
[58:33] world and they came into this church
[58:36] would we put them behind that
[58:38] piano
[58:40] nope why because they have to be
[58:43] spirit-led not just
[58:45] gifted see Paul didn't say there are
[58:48] diversities of gifts there's diversities
[58:49] of ministrations and diversities of
[58:51] operations he says but the Same Spirit
[58:53] the same Lord and the same God working
[58:55] all in all we've all got to be under
[58:57] that anointing the same anointing the
[59:00] same vision the same influence the same
[59:02] unction amen and so when people come
[59:04] into this church they may be very gifted
[59:07] but unless we know them and they have
[59:09] been tested beforehand then we have to
[59:11] get to know them and test them amen and
[59:14] they have to show that they are under
[59:16] the Same Spirit and the same it's not
[59:19] just spirit it's commitment it's all of
[59:21] these things they have to prove they're
[59:22] a part of the body before they can have
[59:25] an influence on the body the the the
[59:27] crazy thing is we're less picky about
[59:29] people flowing through than people that
[59:31] stay here listen a visiting Minister
[59:34] comes through almost any time the pastor
[59:36] will say Hey brother get up and take a
[59:38] service for us let's hear what God's
[59:40] doing with your life and sometimes when
[59:43] we do that sometimes we have Services we
[59:46] probably wish we didn't have don't we
[59:48] every church has had it every church
[59:50] I've been to we've had Clunkers people
[59:52] that come in they preach just something
[59:54] strange
[59:56] but you know what we do we shrug it off
[59:59] maybe the pastor gives a little bit of
[1:00:00] correction the next service after the
[1:00:01] brother's gone and we move on with life
[1:00:05] but if you're in this
[1:00:06] church what happens is now you are here
[1:00:09] and you have influence and you have
[1:00:12] impact and people know you and if you
[1:00:14] say or do something that's off the word
[1:00:17] now that has a far greater effect than
[1:00:19] if you're just passing through so that's
[1:00:21] why we try the spirits and that's why
[1:00:23] there's a waiting period for certain
[1:00:24] offices you can't serve in an in a in a
[1:00:27] a voted office in this church unless
[1:00:29] you've been here at least 6 months
[1:00:31] that's to give us time to get to know
[1:00:32] you to test your spirit and to see if
[1:00:35] you can be under the same vision that's
[1:00:37] what it's all about amen it's very
[1:00:38] practical but Paul has it there for a
[1:00:40] reason we have to try the spirits we
[1:00:42] have to test the people they have to be
[1:00:44] proved amen so the only thing consistent
[1:00:47] in all of these is God God is in control
[1:00:51] that's that's the key message to get out
[1:00:53] of there remember what brother BR says
[1:00:54] my gift is not the the discernment or
[1:00:57] the the laying on of hands or the prayer
[1:00:59] of faith he says my gift is to get
[1:01:00] myself out of the way and this is all
[1:01:02] Paul is trying to say here if you can
[1:01:04] get yourself out of the way things will
[1:01:07] happen that otherwise cannot happen it
[1:01:09] takes that getting out of our way amen
[1:01:11] we don't need gifts what we need is
[1:01:13] Christ and if we have Christ then the
[1:01:15] gifts will follow behind just like signs
[1:01:17] and wonders and these different things
[1:01:18] amen we're not looking for
[1:01:20] manifestations we're looking for the
[1:01:22] person of Christ and when he comes he'll
[1:01:24] make himself known he'll make himself
[1:01:25] revealed we can't hide it you can't hide
[1:01:27] the eternal life that's inside of you
[1:01:29] it'll break forth in one way or another
[1:01:31] it has to because they are expressions
[1:01:33] of him and we'll see what that looks
[1:01:35] like as we go through so Paul's saying
[1:01:37] make sure you got the Holy Spirit you
[1:01:40] know we don't need signs we need to be
[1:01:42] the sign really isn't that what we are
[1:01:45] we're a we're a epistle seen and read of
[1:01:48] all
[1:01:48] men some of it is by the supernatural
[1:01:51] but a lot of it is the day-by-day
[1:01:52] ability to go through life and not get
[1:01:54] chopped to pieces to keep the victory
[1:01:56] through all that we're going but in all
[1:01:58] of these gifts as we go through them
[1:02:00] tonight until we surrender them to God
[1:02:02] until we let him use it rather than us
[1:02:04] use it we'll never see the full impact
[1:02:07] we'll never see what could really be
[1:02:08] done with that in a kingdom of God way
[1:02:11] until we let him have it because the
[1:02:13] question is going to be who's doing the
[1:02:15] work who's in control if it's him it's
[1:02:18] going to have way different results than
[1:02:19] it's me and if it's him rather than you
[1:02:22] you're going to see a difference in the
[1:02:23] things that come through so we got three
[1:02:26] different categories here we've got
[1:02:27] gifts administrations and operations now
[1:02:30] the gifts are the nine spiritual gifts
[1:02:32] and we don't tend to focus on those a
[1:02:34] great deal and I think it's because
[1:02:36] we've seen the
[1:02:37] Trap that that it got that it had for
[1:02:40] Pentecost because they came to the gifts
[1:02:42] and they didn't go to the giver and they
[1:02:43] refused the fullness of the word the
[1:02:45] opening of the word and so it seems like
[1:02:47] many times that that we've taken them
[1:02:49] we've said well we don't need them
[1:02:51] anymore because we have the word that's
[1:02:54] not true what would is is we place the
[1:02:56] preeminence where it needs to be which
[1:02:59] is on the word of God that is always the
[1:03:01] preeminence and Paul when he comes in
[1:03:03] and he sets the church in order he would
[1:03:05] Point them to charity he point them to
[1:03:07] the Holy Ghost when that which is
[1:03:09] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:03:11] part is done
[1:03:12] away but that doesn't mean the gifts
[1:03:15] were done away with listen under the
[1:03:17] restoration of the Bride tree gifts came
[1:03:19] back they're not brought back so we can
[1:03:21] throw them away today listen we don't
[1:03:23] throw away justification
[1:03:26] hey that was that was Luther's message
[1:03:28] did we throw that away you better not
[1:03:30] otherwise your conscience will be
[1:03:32] burning you up sanctification a cleaned
[1:03:34] up life if we throw that away church
[1:03:36] then the Holy Spirit can't use us and
[1:03:39] then the gifts the gifts are there for
[1:03:40] the health and the benefit of the
[1:03:43] body and then there's the Holy Spirit
[1:03:45] himself and that's really the key point
[1:03:48] because the Holy Spirit leads us into
[1:03:49] all truth he points us to the word and
[1:03:51] then he makes it a reality but all of
[1:03:53] these all of these restoration
[1:03:55] Ministries we build on those Ministries
[1:03:57] today we're not
[1:03:59] lutherans we're we're not um methodists
[1:04:03] but we believe that portion of their
[1:04:04] message absolutely we had to because
[1:04:06] that was the Holy Spirit restoring the
[1:04:08] word back to us amen so all of these
[1:04:11] things uh I'm saying that to say this
[1:04:14] it's not up to us to put the gifts on
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:17] Shelf that's for God to do amen our
[1:04:21] portion is to say Lord I'm Available
[1:04:25] that's it
[1:04:26] I'm available not to force it not to try
[1:04:29] and make it into something not to try
[1:04:30] and manifest it that's the the worst
[1:04:32] thing you can do is try and manifest the
[1:04:34] promise of God it takes him a gift of
[1:04:36] God it takes him to do that sort of
[1:04:38] thing amen so the gifts the nine
[1:04:40] spiritual gifts we're going to talk a
[1:04:42] little bit about them tonight but then
[1:04:43] after that we have administrations and
[1:04:45] this is primarily your five-fold
[1:04:47] ministry but it's also your formal
[1:04:49] offices within the church so it's your
[1:04:51] Apostles evangelists prophets pastors
[1:04:53] teachers as Ephesians 4 says but it also
[1:04:56] includes the Practical side of the
[1:04:58] ministry so that will include brother
[1:04:59] Matt and brother Joe as deacons they're
[1:05:02] a part of the administration of the
[1:05:04] church body they help keep it in order
[1:05:06] we've got our trustees brother Bob and
[1:05:08] brother via we've got our treasur
[1:05:09] brother Mark we've got brother Paul as
[1:05:11] the Sunday School Superintendent these
[1:05:13] are all formal offices and officers that
[1:05:15] are working to keep the body working
[1:05:18] together cleanly they're formal they
[1:05:20] have a declared Duty everybody knows who
[1:05:22] they are and and nobody gets to be a
[1:05:25] deacon except brother Matt and brother
[1:05:26] Joe for this year doesn't mean you don't
[1:05:29] have insights or anything but they are
[1:05:31] the ones that do that that's their Lane
[1:05:33] and so we let them do their Lane amen
[1:05:35] same with the treasur nobody goes to
[1:05:37] brother Mark and tries to tell them how
[1:05:38] to manage the finances he's been voted
[1:05:40] in with the confidence of the people to
[1:05:42] do that and we trust him to do it and
[1:05:44] he's doing a great job and then brother
[1:05:45] Bob and brother Vel we can say I would
[1:05:48] like it this way or I would like it that
[1:05:49] way but in the end they are the ones
[1:05:51] that look at the body and make a
[1:05:53] decision based on how God leads them
[1:05:56] that all keeps things working together
[1:05:58] but it can also include the helpers it
[1:06:00] can include the audiovisual people
[1:06:02] sister Rebecca and sister Selena and
[1:06:04] brother Levi and brother vichel it can
[1:06:06] include the the janitorial side with
[1:06:08] sister Amber and these different ones it
[1:06:10] can include the ones that are put into
[1:06:13] Authority even temporarily to manage an
[1:06:16] event or manage a situation in these
[1:06:18] sorts of things amen so I'm trying to
[1:06:21] point out that in all of these
[1:06:23] somebody's got a place to fit you can
[1:06:26] fit in one of these three no matter what
[1:06:28] then the last one is operations and this
[1:06:29] is the widest one of all because this is
[1:06:32] somebody that has a burden in their
[1:06:34] heart to do something and they've got a
[1:06:37] gift to make it happen can I put it this
[1:06:40] way a willing heart is not a
[1:06:43] gift okay how many times have you ever
[1:06:46] met people in your job that want to do
[1:06:48] something but they can't do
[1:06:51] it it's the same in the body of Christ
[1:06:54] not everybody is called to do everything
[1:06:56] and not everybody has a gift to do
[1:06:58] everything even if we want to listen I
[1:07:01] believe a sincere desire in our hearts
[1:07:03] should be that we can serve any way we
[1:07:05] could serve and sometimes that willing
[1:07:07] heart puts us in a dangerous position
[1:07:09] because we say I'm willing to do it
[1:07:10] therefore I will do it no no no he's got
[1:07:13] to lead you into it and here's the thing
[1:07:16] we'll know that we're called and gifted
[1:07:18] if the results match the
[1:07:22] vision okay if I say that I can manage a
[1:07:25] $100 million company and I turn it into
[1:07:28] a $50 million company then guess what my
[1:07:30] willing heart was not enough I didn't
[1:07:33] have the gift I didn't have what it took
[1:07:35] to do that sort of thing and so it's the
[1:07:36] same in our midst listen if this church
[1:07:39] starts to fall apart if people start to
[1:07:41] leave if people are falling asleep in
[1:07:43] service what does that say about me it
[1:07:47] means I'm right up there with
[1:07:50] Paul oh woke you up didn't I no but in
[1:07:55] all seriousness listen if I'm putting
[1:07:57] people to sleep up here there's a
[1:07:59] problem with my calling that's just
[1:08:02] speaking practically that ought not to
[1:08:04] be it ought to do something for the
[1:08:06] people it ought to help them grow and
[1:08:08] mature in Christ amen so the test of
[1:08:10] these PE of a person that has a gift in
[1:08:13] operations is that they are effective I
[1:08:16] don't know if brother Kim dingwell is
[1:08:17] listening tonight probably not but if he
[1:08:20] is brother Kim God bless you but when we
[1:08:22] were in be in British Columbia we notice
[1:08:24] that brother Kim was used for a lot of
[1:08:26] project management and leading things
[1:08:29] because apparently he can manage and he
[1:08:31] can lead and he did it once and it
[1:08:33] worked well and again and again and so
[1:08:35] they made him the principal and then
[1:08:36] they took him out and then they put him
[1:08:37] back in again they didn't have anybody
[1:08:39] else they said can you please do it
[1:08:40] because you do a great job that's really
[1:08:42] how you know you've got a gift is people
[1:08:44] keep coming back to you if I can put it
[1:08:46] that way people keep coming back because
[1:08:49] they see that God uses you in a way
[1:08:51] that's effective amen but this could be
[1:08:54] in operations it can be things within
[1:08:56] the church it can be people that work
[1:08:57] outside of the church people that help
[1:08:59] people move people that shovel snow for
[1:09:02] old folks that mow yards that it could
[1:09:04] be charitable giving for specific causes
[1:09:06] it could be dedicating a way to help the
[1:09:08] community and all these different things
[1:09:10] somebody like Dorcas would fit within
[1:09:13] operations okay she had a vision to go
[1:09:15] out and help poor people with their
[1:09:17] clothing and so she she produced
[1:09:18] clothing for them and she had a massive
[1:09:20] impact on them so great that she was
[1:09:23] deemed worthy of being raised from the
[1:09:24] dead okay so we don't put these into
[1:09:28] levels they are places and
[1:09:31] positions I don't even think I read my
[1:09:34] title finding your place and accepting
[1:09:37] your part I think you skipped on me
[1:09:39] brother Vel did you I didn't think I
[1:09:42] pressed it anyways finding your place
[1:09:45] and accepting your part okay this thing
[1:09:48] seems to have a mind of its own tonight
[1:09:49] it's been going back and forth a bit all
[1:09:52] right so but operations is all about
[1:09:55] impact you can't say you've got a gift
[1:09:58] in whatever area this is if there's no
[1:10:00] impact okay it's not about willing heart
[1:10:02] it's about actually being able to
[1:10:03] produce something it's not about how it
[1:10:05] looks it's about what it achieves so
[1:10:08] we're not here to look good we're here
[1:10:09] to do good it has to have a real effect
[1:10:12] okay so we continue he says now but the
[1:10:14] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:10:17] every man to profit with all so that
[1:10:19] means it's for the common good it's for
[1:10:21] common profiting in other words if I
[1:10:24] have a gift and I'm the the only one
[1:10:25] that's profiting there's either two
[1:10:27] issues one it's not a real gift or two
[1:10:29] I'm not being led of the spirit because
[1:10:31] it's for everyone not just for me
[1:10:34] doesn't mean I can't benefit from it but
[1:10:36] if it's only me that's benefiting we've
[1:10:38] got a problem
[1:10:39] amen so you can have a manifestation of
[1:10:42] the Holy Spirit but it's not a true gift
[1:10:45] if you're not surrendering it for
[1:10:46] everybody's benefit he says for to one
[1:10:49] is given now these are the nine
[1:10:50] spiritual gifts for to one is given by
[1:10:53] the spirit the word of wisdom so this is
[1:10:54] insight into a situation so you might be
[1:10:57] going through a c certain situation in
[1:10:58] life and and you may not really
[1:11:00] understand what's going on and somebody
[1:11:01] can come to you with a word of wisdom
[1:11:03] and say this is what you need to do this
[1:11:05] is the problem go do it and you're like
[1:11:08] great it's insight into a particular
[1:11:11] area then it says to another one the
[1:11:13] word of knowledge by The Same Spirit so
[1:11:16] a word of knowledge would be very
[1:11:17] similar to this so wisdom is is to give
[1:11:20] you good advice a word of knowledge is
[1:11:22] that that which is specific to your
[1:11:24] situation
[1:11:26] and a word of knowledge is really a form
[1:11:27] of Prophecy because it's from God for a
[1:11:31] person so for instance uh the example
[1:11:34] that that I jumped out to me in
[1:11:36] scripture is ananas and
[1:11:38] Safara because a word of knowledge can
[1:11:40] be judgment it can be encouragement it
[1:11:43] can be Direction it can be all these
[1:11:45] different things remember Peter comes
[1:11:46] with the word of knowledge and he says
[1:11:49] how much did you sell that land for see
[1:11:52] he already knows and they they say such
[1:11:55] and such and he says why did you try to
[1:11:58] fool the Holy Spirit and he says because
[1:12:00] of this you're going to die and then he
[1:12:03] gives that Safar a chance to come in and
[1:12:05] she does the same thing it's a word of
[1:12:07] knowledge Peter was not a prophet Peter
[1:12:10] was not a man that had an open Vision
[1:12:12] Ministry he saw Visions at times but he
[1:12:15] wasn't this way but this was a word of
[1:12:16] knowledge that came showed him what was
[1:12:18] going on in the situation and gave him a
[1:12:20] word for the situation it's used it's
[1:12:22] meant for our benefit and in that case
[1:12:25] it was a benefit because it purged the
[1:12:27] church that's a scary thing got to
[1:12:30] remember that the remember when it comes
[1:12:32] to the healing of the body sometimes it
[1:12:34] takes a cutting not see it's not all
[1:12:37] sabs and hugs and kisses sometimes it's
[1:12:40] surgery and so the holy spirit's here to
[1:12:43] keep the body clean brother Brandon made
[1:12:45] a comment about how if he had somebody
[1:12:47] with this gift that they would stand in
[1:12:50] the door of the congregation and would
[1:12:52] not allow you to enter unless your life
[1:12:56] was clean because that word of knowledge
[1:12:58] would call you
[1:13:00] out that's the seriousness of this it's
[1:13:03] not for playing around it's very serious
[1:13:05] it's the Holy Spirit working but it can
[1:13:08] be very simple where somebody would say
[1:13:10] listen the Lord has showed me something
[1:13:12] and he told me to tell you something and
[1:13:13] they tell it to you and then you go and
[1:13:15] you do it sometimes it's a word of
[1:13:16] warning hey you're supposed to leave
[1:13:18] tomorrow to drive across the the the the
[1:13:20] the um Province don't do it there's
[1:13:23] going to be a bad wreck and you're going
[1:13:24] to be involved involved stay home
[1:13:26] tomorrow okay praise the Lord don't take
[1:13:29] that job get out of that relationship
[1:13:32] all these different things it's a word
[1:13:34] uh of knowledge to the person then he
[1:13:36] says to another Faith by The Same Spirit
[1:13:39] so some people have a particular gift of
[1:13:41] faith they can believe anything by the
[1:13:44] word and it's there to help those of us
[1:13:47] that are of weaker
[1:13:49] Faith it's not to build them a great
[1:13:51] ministry it's to help those that aren't
[1:13:53] in such a strong position
[1:13:55] then he says to another the gift of
[1:13:57] healing to another the gifts of healing
[1:13:59] by The Same Spirit so this is a gift to
[1:14:01] pray for people and see amazing results
[1:14:04] remember the scripture says if any are
[1:14:05] sick let them come forward and the
[1:14:07] elders will anoint them with oil lay
[1:14:08] hands on them and they shall
[1:14:10] recover they'll be restored to health
[1:14:13] but the gifts of healing is for
[1:14:16] Supernatural healing it's miraculous
[1:14:18] healing and these are this is a very
[1:14:21] particular one it's a gift that goes
[1:14:22] beyond just laying on of hands and
[1:14:24] you'll you're to get better it is an it
[1:14:26] can be an instantaneous thing then he
[1:14:29] says to another the working of Miracles
[1:14:31] this could be anything you look in the
[1:14:33] scriptures you see remember when uh uh
[1:14:35] Elisha made the ax head to float that
[1:14:38] was a working of a miracle it could be
[1:14:40] somebody lays their hands on a car that
[1:14:42] won't start and it
[1:14:44] starts it could be all sorts of of
[1:14:46] things it could be be speaking to a
[1:14:49] storm changing a
[1:14:52] situation all these sorts of things it
[1:14:54] can it can be whatever God would lay on
[1:14:56] your heart to do it could be just a
[1:14:58] change in circumstances whatever that
[1:15:00] might be he says to another there's a
[1:15:02] gift of Prophecy remember what Paul said
[1:15:04] prophecy is the greatest of all of these
[1:15:06] because prophecy is thus saith the Lord
[1:15:10] prophecy is not vague it's specific it's
[1:15:14] direct and it has to be 100% right it's
[1:15:17] the greatest gift because it is God
[1:15:19] speaking directly to the
[1:15:22] church then he says now another
[1:15:24] discerning of spirits remember we're all
[1:15:26] all supposed to have discernment by
[1:15:28] exercising it by testing it and checking
[1:15:30] it but there are people that can that
[1:15:33] can meet a
[1:15:34] person and they can understand the
[1:15:36] influence that person's under and they
[1:15:38] can they have insight into that and that
[1:15:40] is a gift of the spirit amen then it
[1:15:43] says to anothers diverse kinds of
[1:15:45] tongues so this is speaking in tongues
[1:15:47] as a gift and then another the
[1:15:49] interpretation of tongues it's the
[1:15:51] interpretation of tongues that makes the
[1:15:53] gift of tongues of any use gift of
[1:15:55] tongues by itself is useless to the body
[1:15:57] we preached that already all it is is
[1:15:59] gibberish none of us understand it's the
[1:16:01] SP the person speaking it doesn't
[1:16:03] understand it it has no benefit to the
[1:16:05] body except there be an interpretation
[1:16:08] given and Paul says without
[1:16:09] interpretation we don't do it in the
[1:16:11] church by that meaning we don't stop and
[1:16:14] listen to it you can speak in tongues in
[1:16:16] worship or prayer whatever time you want
[1:16:18] but it's not meant it cannot interrupt
[1:16:19] the word and we don't stop and listen
[1:16:21] unless there's going to be an
[1:16:22] interpretation given of that thing amen
[1:16:25] you're with me but then he comes down
[1:16:28] down down to verse 11 and he says but
[1:16:30] all of these worketh that one and the
[1:16:32] selfs Same Spirit so the person that's
[1:16:34] operating all of these is not the people
[1:16:36] that have the gifts it's the spirit
[1:16:38] that's working it and he says now he's
[1:16:40] dividing to every man severly as he will
[1:16:44] so it's the Holy Spirit that's giving
[1:16:46] them operating them to each person as he
[1:16:49] wills and this is a dynamic
[1:16:51] event it is not that brother Matt has a
[1:16:54] gift of the spirit on his life all all
[1:16:57] the time he might but it's not
[1:16:59] guaranteed rather it's the spirit
[1:17:02] falling and giving a gift to those as it
[1:17:04] is needed and as they're willing and
[1:17:06] available to be done now I just want to
[1:17:08] talk about that for a little bit because
[1:17:11] with the Holy Spirit operating it and it
[1:17:13] being a dynamic situation it means every
[1:17:16] one of us could potentially serve under
[1:17:19] the anointing of one of these gifts it's
[1:17:21] not limited to men only men women young
[1:17:26] old it matters not this is this is the
[1:17:29] the great equalizing of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:30] when it was given is that the gifts are
[1:17:33] given for
[1:17:34] everybody okay the nine spiritual gifts
[1:17:36] I'm talking about administrations
[1:17:38] fivefold Ministry men only sorry sisters
[1:17:41] right and there are certain leadership
[1:17:43] positions that can only be men but when
[1:17:45] it comes to the nine spiritual gifts
[1:17:47] we've just talked about anybody can have
[1:17:49] them and it's not that they're always
[1:17:51] going to have them scripturally we can
[1:17:53] look at King Saul but before he became
[1:17:55] King Saul remember he went to the school
[1:17:57] of the prophets and in the school of the
[1:17:59] prophets the Holy Spirit fell on Saul
[1:18:01] and he prophesied accurately so much so
[1:18:05] that people said is Saul one of the
[1:18:07] prophets no Saul wasn't one of the
[1:18:09] prophets he was under an anointing that
[1:18:11] gave him a gift of Prophecy for that
[1:18:14] moment Paul went or Saul went away and
[1:18:16] he never prophesied again as far as I
[1:18:18] remember and as far as recorded in
[1:18:20] history you look at Caiaphas the high
[1:18:22] priest he prophesied accurately and
[1:18:25] beautifully when Jesus was under trial
[1:18:28] and as far as we know he never did it
[1:18:30] again he they're not prophets they're
[1:18:32] under a gift of Prophecy amen but then
[1:18:36] you have people so you have people and
[1:18:37] it may just happen
[1:18:39] once it may just happen once but you
[1:18:41] have people that it happens to
[1:18:43] constantly and sometimes that's because
[1:18:45] they are very open to it sometimes they
[1:18:48] have an inclination to it and sometimes
[1:18:51] that's just the way God does it
[1:18:53] sometimes that's the sovereignty of God
[1:18:54] that he will use somebody over and over
[1:18:56] but you'll have people and you'll see
[1:18:57] this in life and we can even see it in
[1:18:59] the scriptures of course is you'll have
[1:19:01] people that do a great work over a short
[1:19:03] period of time and then they go back and
[1:19:05] just live a normal life after that and
[1:19:07] God drops a gift into their life an
[1:19:09] anointing an unction a vision a
[1:19:11] direction whatever that might be a
[1:19:13] courage to do something and they go do
[1:19:16] it and then they go and they just live a
[1:19:18] normal life and they have exactly
[1:19:20] fulfilled the purpose of God for their
[1:19:22] life 100% remember brother he says God
[1:19:25] will train a man for what what was the
[1:19:27] quote said 30 years for 30 minutes of
[1:19:30] work he just needs you ready for that
[1:19:33] moment and then he'll use you and then
[1:19:35] you have some people that all they do is
[1:19:38] work and there's a gift there for that
[1:19:41] we're not talking spiritual gifts we're
[1:19:42] kind of moving to another side of it but
[1:19:44] just for a second you look at our our
[1:19:46] brother Gerald as a pastor for 43
[1:19:49] years he never got to lay that burden
[1:19:51] down that was a gift and it's a calling
[1:19:54] but he's doing that every day of his
[1:19:55] life brother Bob's now serving longer in
[1:19:57] an office and he's at 44 years now of
[1:20:00] song leading that's not an anointing
[1:20:03] that comes and goes brother Bob it
[1:20:04] better not be
[1:20:06] right CU we would of all people be most
[1:20:13] miserable it's
[1:20:15] true it's true we laugh but it's
[1:20:19] true and if it ever leaves he'll know
[1:20:22] step down that's it
[1:20:26] I'm not pushing I'm not pushing I'm so
[1:20:29] I'm so blessed that we have people that
[1:20:31] are willing to stay and do this for so
[1:20:32] long God bless you every single one but
[1:20:35] if the anointing ever goes we got to lay
[1:20:38] that we got to lay it down that's it
[1:20:41] that's it God's done with
[1:20:43] you that's it and we don't fight it
[1:20:46] here's the thing if I got up here and
[1:20:48] never felt that I should be up here why
[1:20:50] would I do it you'd be of all people
[1:20:53] most miserable and I join right in there
[1:20:55] with you because I'd be trying to force
[1:20:57] something that I'm not meant to be doing
[1:20:59] amen I'm not sure why I went
[1:21:01] there amen but we'll keep pushing
[1:21:04] through but these nine gifts God can use
[1:21:06] any one of us at any time brother brah
[1:21:08] says it this way he says there are nine
[1:21:09] spiritual gifts in the church they
[1:21:11] operate anywhere in the church for
[1:21:13] instance if this tent here tonight
[1:21:15] concealed the entire body of Christ the
[1:21:17] Holy Spirit leads the body of Christ and
[1:21:19] in this body there are nine spiritual
[1:21:21] gifts they're here in the body Gifts of
[1:21:23] healing Gifts of prophecy he says it
[1:21:25] might fall upon someone here tonight
[1:21:27] this lady sitting here this man or this
[1:21:30] man and he may give a prophecy and it
[1:21:32] would be true but it would never work on
[1:21:35] him maybe again see that doesn't make
[1:21:38] him a prophet all right but then he says
[1:21:41] we're in the body and by one Spirit we
[1:21:43] are baptized in the body and we are
[1:21:46] subject to these gifts in other words we
[1:21:49] are available for use by the Holy Spirit
[1:21:52] to express these gifts and when the body
[1:21:54] sitting here he says remember what Paul
[1:21:56] said if something be revealed to one
[1:21:58] sitting by let him hold his peace and so
[1:22:00] forth like that that's the apostolic
[1:22:03] church that's where it should be now and
[1:22:06] here might be one tonight with the
[1:22:08] prayer of faith that would pray a prayer
[1:22:11] of faith that would heal
[1:22:13] somebody not the
[1:22:15] preacher listen I don't declare myself
[1:22:18] to have a prayer a gift of faith that
[1:22:20] way but listen there are times where I
[1:22:22] do and I have but I also know that there
[1:22:25] are people in this church that have had
[1:22:27] that happen to them as well mothers and
[1:22:29] fathers believe me when you have
[1:22:31] something to that says go lay your hands
[1:22:33] on your child what is that that is a
[1:22:35] gift of faith that is a gift of healing
[1:22:37] by the Holy Spirit dropping down to
[1:22:39] address the
[1:22:40] need remember brother Brown talked about
[1:22:44] I I hope I get this right because it's
[1:22:45] off the top of my head I didn't look it
[1:22:47] up where that woman was sitting in his
[1:22:50] one of his meetings and she had this
[1:22:53] this something kept telling her lay your
[1:22:55] hands on this person near you and so she
[1:22:58] went to that person she said listen I'm
[1:23:00] I'm a nobody and I just feel led to do
[1:23:02] this I want to pray for you is that okay
[1:23:04] and the person said yes they prayed on
[1:23:06] she prayed for her and then went back to
[1:23:07] her seat Well that person had a prayer
[1:23:09] card if I'm not
[1:23:11] mistaken or maybe brother Bram called
[1:23:13] him out I'm not sure but they were
[1:23:15] looking to be healed and he says I can't
[1:23:17] do a thing for you you were healed when
[1:23:20] that sister laid her hands on you and
[1:23:22] prayed for you so she had a of faith and
[1:23:25] she had a gift of healing for that
[1:23:27] moment for that
[1:23:29] person he says the gift of healing might
[1:23:31] be on them tonight it might be upon this
[1:23:33] lady here tomorrow night and upon this
[1:23:35] man over here the next night it might
[1:23:36] come back to her it's in the church the
[1:23:39] body that's the beauty of it is that we
[1:23:41] don't have to rely on some person to
[1:23:44] always have
[1:23:45] this if you are filled with the spirit
[1:23:49] and you open yourself to be used he'll
[1:23:52] use you he use you in his way but he'll
[1:23:55] use you I believe that with all my heart
[1:23:59] amen so he says now now he makes this
[1:24:02] transition and we'll make the same
[1:24:03] transition with them he says now those
[1:24:05] are the nine spiritual gifts that are in
[1:24:07] the body now he says they work through
[1:24:10] the body but then there are gifts there
[1:24:12] is gifts and callings without repentance
[1:24:16] he says that's a Vindicated Prophet sent
[1:24:19] from God so you can have a gift of
[1:24:21] Prophecy but he says that is not make
[1:24:23] you a prophet
[1:24:24] he says you don't receive that that's a
[1:24:27] gift sent from God that's born in your
[1:24:30] birth come down through and been set you
[1:24:33] down through he says a prophet not a
[1:24:36] gift of Prophecy so notice now these
[1:24:38] nine spiritual gifts of wisdom and
[1:24:40] healing and faith and all these
[1:24:41] different things word of knowledge they
[1:24:43] are not necessarily A
[1:24:46] Ministry they can be a Ministry and they
[1:24:48] can be attached to a Ministry but they
[1:24:51] are meant for everyone anytime
[1:24:55] and they we do have these amen and many
[1:24:57] preachers will have these sorts of gifts
[1:24:59] attached to their Ministry it is not
[1:25:02] their true Ministry but it is a gift
[1:25:04] that's attached to their Ministry
[1:25:06] because their true Ministry is to preach
[1:25:07] the word teach the word whatever that
[1:25:10] might be Pastor in these different
[1:25:11] things but these things follow along and
[1:25:13] they are used for the benefit of the
[1:25:15] body and the greatest danger we have is
[1:25:18] that we start bringing them in for the
[1:25:20] gift rather than for the word because it
[1:25:23] will in effect restore us back to
[1:25:25] Pentecost which takes us backward we're
[1:25:28] there for the word first and everything
[1:25:30] else is second but they are here and
[1:25:33] they're a manifestation they a portion
[1:25:34] of God and we have these in the bride of
[1:25:37] Christ
[1:25:38] today I've experienced it I've had those
[1:25:42] gifts applied to me by other ministers
[1:25:44] in my life I can tell you there are
[1:25:46] brothers out there that have a gift of
[1:25:48] knowledge that have a gift of laying on
[1:25:50] of hands that have a gift of faith that
[1:25:52] have a gift of healing we've seen it
[1:25:54] we've seen people that come in and that
[1:25:56] is their greatest Ministry is that that
[1:25:58] Faith and Healing where they will preach
[1:25:59] the word to establish your faith and
[1:26:02] something that is absolute and then they
[1:26:04] will come behind it and they will show
[1:26:05] you what that looks like that's what the
[1:26:07] gift's really meant to do it's to
[1:26:09] manifest what the word's talking about
[1:26:10] it's to put the Life of Christ back
[1:26:11] through US amen and these gifts are
[1:26:15] these nine gifts they're all Redemptive
[1:26:17] gifts and we'll read the scripture that
[1:26:19] talks about that but they're Unleashed
[1:26:20] by God they're sent down by God to help
[1:26:23] us and so we don't need to be scared of
[1:26:25] it we don't need to put them on the
[1:26:28] Shelf we can take them and let them be
[1:26:31] used because they are part of the
[1:26:32] blessings that come with being a child
[1:26:34] of God we've seen those gifts many of us
[1:26:36] have experienced those amen they're all
[1:26:38] through scriptures but you'll see very
[1:26:40] little of that in the Old Testament but
[1:26:41] in the New Testament all of a sudden it
[1:26:43] seems like they're all over the place
[1:26:45] you've got the apostles going and they
[1:26:47] have all these gifts and then the church
[1:26:48] has it so much so that Paul has to put
[1:26:51] it in order these different gifts and
[1:26:53] saying hey remember what the preeminence
[1:26:55] is here and that's the key thing is that
[1:26:58] it can be a lot this is the fun side of
[1:27:00] Christianity the
[1:27:02] gifts if you use them they're fun if he
[1:27:06] uses them it takes a lot of the fruit of
[1:27:07] the spirit to keep them in their proper
[1:27:08] order and place and it keeps us humble
[1:27:11] that's for sure so these nine spiritual
[1:27:13] gifts are not necessarily A Ministry
[1:27:15] they're an opportunity to be used by God
[1:27:17] in a particular way amen but they are
[1:27:20] according to the Sovereign will of God
[1:27:22] in our life and it's based on our
[1:27:24] surrender and it's based on our
[1:27:26] availability okay two things surrender
[1:27:30] and
[1:27:30] availability listen if you never open
[1:27:33] your mouth you're probably not going to
[1:27:34] speak in tongues
[1:27:35] ever you have to allow yourself to relax
[1:27:38] and get yourself out of the way for
[1:27:39] those things amen but then the other
[1:27:41] side is we may not have them because
[1:27:43] we're not
[1:27:44] suitable we may not be suitable by
[1:27:47] character we may not be suitable by our
[1:27:49] life that's lived when brother Mark was
[1:27:51] preaching there or or teaching a little
[1:27:53] while ago remember what he says we need
[1:27:55] to keep our lives clean a clean heart
[1:27:57] and a clean life that's what makes us
[1:27:59] suitable for the Holy Spirit to use amen
[1:28:03] that's what we need to do sincere and
[1:28:05] Sanctified vessels fit for the Master's
[1:28:08] use but then brother brandham comes
[1:28:10] along and he says now you've got to be
[1:28:12] very careful that you don't have a gift
[1:28:14] of Prophecy that drops on you and you
[1:28:16] start to declare yourself a prophet
[1:28:18] that's a very dangerous place to be he
[1:28:20] says because a prophet is not a gift
[1:28:22] given it is something that's ordained to
[1:28:24] you by birth and that means it's a
[1:28:27] creation gift not a Redemptive gift it's
[1:28:30] in you you have it and and whether you
[1:28:32] realize it or not and whether or not you
[1:28:34] surrender your life to God it's still
[1:28:36] there and that calling is there now he
[1:28:38] referenced the scripture in Romans 11
[1:28:40] that said for the gifts and calling of
[1:28:42] God are without repentance notice gifts
[1:28:44] plural calling singular the gifts are
[1:28:46] many and varied and you look around this
[1:28:49] church and we have lots of different
[1:28:50] gifts cuz we have lots of different
[1:28:52] people the fact that you're different
[1:28:54] makes you a gift that's why you're here
[1:28:56] is because you're different amen so but
[1:28:58] it's a singular purpose and what is that
[1:29:01] singular purpose we have lots of gifts
[1:29:03] but we've got one purpose and one alone
[1:29:05] scripture says in first John says behold
[1:29:07] what manner of love the father had
[1:29:09] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:29:11] called the sons of God our purpose is to
[1:29:14] be a child of God that's our calling is
[1:29:17] to be a child of God and our life is to
[1:29:19] reflect that but the gifts come together
[1:29:21] to help Express that we are a child of
[1:29:23] God
[1:29:24] but we're different parts we're
[1:29:26] different gifts we're different people
[1:29:28] but our purpose is to be a part of that
[1:29:29] bride body and let him Express himself
[1:29:33] through us now notice it says here that
[1:29:35] these gifts and the calling of God are
[1:29:37] without repentance that original word
[1:29:40] there means irrevocable the gifts and
[1:29:42] calling of God are
[1:29:44] irrevocable you can't add them because
[1:29:46] you want them and you can't take them
[1:29:48] away because you don't they're there
[1:29:50] whether you want them or not amen you
[1:29:52] can't change it your gift with your your
[1:29:54] calling your purpose is set in stone by
[1:29:56] God that's pre-ordained you can't say
[1:29:59] well I wasn't I I don't want to be a
[1:30:01] musician I want to be a preacher sorry
[1:30:04] if he's called you to be a musician
[1:30:06] you're a
[1:30:07] musician and if you try and be a
[1:30:09] preacher I'm not saying you can't get up
[1:30:11] and preach I'm saying he'll never bless
[1:30:13] it because you're never meant to be
[1:30:14] there in the first place you got to stay
[1:30:16] in your lane you'll never have a true
[1:30:18] impact you may have a big church but
[1:30:21] you'll never have an impact because he
[1:30:22] never intended you to do that you have
[1:30:24] to find your lane you have to find your
[1:30:25] gift your position and stay in it
[1:30:27] remember what he said about Jeremiah he
[1:30:29] says before I formed thee in the belly I
[1:30:31] knew thee and before thou camest forth
[1:30:34] out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[1:30:37] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[1:30:40] so Jeremiah was a vessel prepared to be
[1:30:42] a prophet before he ever was even formed
[1:30:44] in his mother's womb where was it it was
[1:30:47] before the foundation of the world in
[1:30:49] the thoughts of God Jeremiah Was A
[1:30:51] prophetic attribute of God and when he's
[1:30:54] born what is it now the word is being
[1:30:56] born in his life of what God has told
[1:30:59] him God has declared that him supposed
[1:31:01] to be Jeremiah wasn't a prophet because
[1:31:03] he got into service and got anointed and
[1:31:05] prophesied Jeremiah was a Prophet by the
[1:31:08] ordination of God and God alone and he
[1:31:10] didn't pick it he couldn't walk away
[1:31:11] from it he couldn't become it he was in
[1:31:13] the mind of God as a prophet and so he
[1:31:15] was a prophet and that's all there was
[1:31:17] to
[1:31:18] it can you see it this way that when the
[1:31:21] word of God comes to you it's quick in
[1:31:24] that which he's seen beforehand it's
[1:31:26] producing what he's already seen
[1:31:28] Jeremiah's purpose was to be a prophet
[1:31:31] and so when the word came to him it
[1:31:32] turned him into the word that was meant
[1:31:35] out of his life he may not have been a
[1:31:38] prophet I don't know how old Jeremiah
[1:31:39] was when he became a prophet maybe he
[1:31:41] had his rebellious
[1:31:43] teens maybe he backslid I don't know but
[1:31:47] eventually he came to a place where he
[1:31:49] stepped into the will and the plan of
[1:31:50] God and God started to use him as a
[1:31:52] prophet God took care of his prophet and
[1:31:54] he was ready to go when God needed him
[1:31:56] to go it's like we we read so many times
[1:31:59] about the wooing of the holy spirit in
[1:32:02] in the early creation it's moving over
[1:32:04] the Earth to draw life out of seeds and
[1:32:07] that's what's happening and so these
[1:32:09] these creation gifts the holy spirit's
[1:32:11] here to pull the gift and the calling of
[1:32:14] God out of our life to produce Sons and
[1:32:16] Daughters of God that can reflect his
[1:32:18] attributes in their life I was reading
[1:32:20] something by Lonnie Jenkins a long time
[1:32:22] ago and I refreshed myself in this week
[1:32:24] and and I just want to read what he said
[1:32:26] if that's okay this evening because he
[1:32:28] said it's so much better than I ever
[1:32:29] could and so much more succintly and he
[1:32:32] said in his daily work the holy spirit
[1:32:35] is to refine his work of creation he
[1:32:39] said he brings the manifestation in your
[1:32:41] life everything you were created to be
[1:32:44] he says I'm showing you the principle
[1:32:46] that God created and then he sent his
[1:32:48] Spirit to refine the same God the same
[1:32:52] Spirit the spirit is refining the
[1:32:55] elements that God built so the work
[1:32:57] really starts after we get the holy
[1:32:59] spirit because that's where the refining
[1:33:01] starts that's where the real character
[1:33:03] development starts and that's where the
[1:33:04] word starts to come forth because when
[1:33:06] you receive the Holy Spirit it shows
[1:33:08] that you have died you have surrendered
[1:33:11] and now there's a different life there's
[1:33:13] a different preeminence that's coming
[1:33:14] out of your
[1:33:16] life and now it's going to refine you
[1:33:19] into what he had in his mind before the
[1:33:22] foundation of the world that's what it's
[1:33:24] doing it's producing the word that he
[1:33:25] had of you here and now in this flesh
[1:33:30] okay brother Braham says it this way he
[1:33:32] says now you have those gifts you didn't
[1:33:35] deserve them God gave them to you before
[1:33:37] the foundation of the world they are
[1:33:41] yours that's a key statement they are
[1:33:44] yours he says when you were born in this
[1:33:46] world you were born with them he he
[1:33:48] quotes Paul speaking to Timothy stir up
[1:33:50] that gift which is within you you're
[1:33:52] born with those things you can't make
[1:33:54] yourself do something I can't make my
[1:33:55] eyes brown because they're blue who
[1:33:58] taking thought can add one cubit to his
[1:34:00] stature it's all in God's Divine program
[1:34:03] you are whoever you are notice he says
[1:34:06] they're yours you can do with that gift
[1:34:09] whatever you
[1:34:12] want we're talking creation gifts and
[1:34:14] we're going to spend the last third of
[1:34:16] this service talking about this for a
[1:34:18] little bit amen God does not bind you to
[1:34:21] using that gift for him he gives you the
[1:34:24] gift and you have free moral agency as
[1:34:27] to how you use it absolutely you do but
[1:34:30] if you're a child of God he's going to
[1:34:31] bring you in no matter what but you may
[1:34:33] never surrender that gift remember we
[1:34:35] talked about every man has the same
[1:34:37] Foundation but what they build on it
[1:34:39] that's between you and God and if you
[1:34:41] build on your own gift without
[1:34:43] surrendering it it's not going to
[1:34:45] survive that's a free will free moral
[1:34:48] agency brother BR would talk so many
[1:34:50] times about one person on this Elvis
[1:34:52] Presley
[1:34:54] hey that man was raised in a Pentecostal
[1:34:58] Church mimicked moves he saw but turned
[1:35:01] it into perversion and had a horrible
[1:35:05] influence on this entire
[1:35:09] continent but he learned it in church
[1:35:12] and then he perverted it he had a gift
[1:35:14] to sing he had a gift to play he had a
[1:35:16] gift to entertain to Wild People however
[1:35:18] you want to look at it that could have
[1:35:20] been used by God hey he could sing hey
[1:35:25] Elvis did some beautiful hymns and songs
[1:35:28] absolutely he did he could have turned
[1:35:30] it over you look at Whitney Houston
[1:35:33] amazing black woman black singer when
[1:35:37] she sings those hymns she can sing and
[1:35:39] hit notes in a way that nobody else in
[1:35:41] this world seems to be able to and what
[1:35:43] did she do she gave it over to
[1:35:45] R&B and she came back she she got into
[1:35:48] drug trouble cleaned herself up did a
[1:35:50] hym album and then went out and o e
[1:35:52] again and died
[1:35:54] she never surrendered it she never
[1:35:57] surrendered it what a
[1:35:59] shame
[1:36:01] amen God's given them to use for his
[1:36:04] glory but we do have a choice to use
[1:36:06] them for our own Glory as well you know
[1:36:09] I study hard I put my notes together in
[1:36:11] a particular way it's the way my mind
[1:36:13] goes these different things but there
[1:36:14] are times up here I start a sentence and
[1:36:16] I don't know what's coming
[1:36:19] next it's the strangest thing can I be
[1:36:22] honest my greatest fear is that someday
[1:36:23] I'm going to sound like KLA Harris where
[1:36:25] a word salad comes
[1:36:27] out but that's part of preaching is
[1:36:31] you've got to be able to relax and not
[1:36:34] direct him let him direct you and so you
[1:36:38] may not know when that's happening cuz
[1:36:40] it's not the entire service by any
[1:36:42] stretch of the imagination I don't think
[1:36:43] I could do it I don't think I could do
[1:36:45] it but there are times where you don't
[1:36:47] know where you're going and you don't
[1:36:49] know the words that are going to come
[1:36:51] out I believe in studying
[1:36:54] scriptures tells us to study the reason
[1:36:57] we have deacons is so that the ministry
[1:36:59] can study we're supposed to study amen I
[1:37:03] believe that putting our notes together
[1:37:04] in a certain way I believe in leadership
[1:37:07] to preach in these different things I
[1:37:09] might do a series that lasts a year and
[1:37:11] I've done
[1:37:12] it but in that I've got to be able to be
[1:37:15] moved I've got to be able to be led and
[1:37:18] I've got to be able to Le be led off as
[1:37:20] well as he leads me to do that amen and
[1:37:22] it's the same thing behind the pulpit I
[1:37:24] believe that the Holy Spirit leads me to
[1:37:26] study I believe he anoints anoints me to
[1:37:29] study to put the notes together but I
[1:37:31] have to be able to let go up here and
[1:37:33] let him determine how that service is
[1:37:35] going to go if you looked at what I had
[1:37:38] here versus what I've said tonight you
[1:37:39] might be very surprised because it's
[1:37:41] usually
[1:37:43] seamless but sometimes I'll fight a
[1:37:45] little bit CU I want my way cuz that's
[1:37:47] what it that's how I got
[1:37:48] it and then he's got to let me know and
[1:37:52] he'll keep pushing and he'll keep
[1:37:53] pushing until I say what he wants me to
[1:37:55] say that's I I'm being perfectly honest
[1:37:58] with you so you can understand it it it
[1:38:00] isn't always so easy by any means by any
[1:38:04] means okay but here's the thing we're
[1:38:07] talking about a creation gift I Believe
[1:38:10] by God's grace I've been called to
[1:38:11] preach not because I'm a great preacher
[1:38:14] but because he has opened the doors and
[1:38:16] placed me heaven knows I never thought I
[1:38:19] would want to I I I don't want to be a
[1:38:21] preacher much less I never thought I
[1:38:23] would be preaching or pastoring in these
[1:38:25] different things but I can take that
[1:38:28] exact gift and I've talked about this
[1:38:30] before and I can use this at work I when
[1:38:32] I'm going to present or teach I cannot
[1:38:36] overstudy I cannot practice it too much
[1:38:39] because it will make me worse not
[1:38:41] better but what I have to do is I have
[1:38:44] to to use a common phrase I have to go
[1:38:46] with the flow and it just comes out a
[1:38:49] certain way and it seems to work and
[1:38:52] that's a benefit to to me it's a benefit
[1:38:54] to my career it's a benefit to my pay
[1:38:56] it's a benefit to my colleagues it's a
[1:38:58] benefit to my reputation it's working
[1:39:00] the same way but here's one difference
[1:39:03] it ain't
[1:39:04] anointed it's just a gift it's just a
[1:39:07] gift I can use that for my benefit and
[1:39:09] maybe I could go way higher in my in my
[1:39:12] career if I really wanted to but the
[1:39:14] gift was not meant for me to succeed
[1:39:16] even though I believe I've been
[1:39:17] successful but it was meant to put me
[1:39:19] behind a Pulpit so I can
[1:39:22] serve amen
[1:39:24] you see that it's been there all along
[1:39:27] that portion of my life has been there
[1:39:29] most of my
[1:39:30] life as far as I can look back but to
[1:39:34] use it to preach that was a complete
[1:39:36] change and transition in my life and in
[1:39:39] my
[1:39:39] purpose so we can have a gift in our
[1:39:42] life even a great gift and have all
[1:39:44] sorts of personal benefits but its
[1:39:46] purpose is meant to benefit everyone
[1:39:48] else not just me not just you but you
[1:39:52] we'll never see that that what that
[1:39:54] looks like until we surrender it and the
[1:39:56] problem is that Satan will offer us
[1:39:58] every worldly opportunity to magnify
[1:40:02] ourselves while God's offering us a
[1:40:04] little humble opportunity to Magnify Him
[1:40:08] and the thing is if we'd ever realize
[1:40:10] that the true greatness will come when
[1:40:12] you humble yourself and let him use you
[1:40:14] it's far greater far greater than
[1:40:17] anything you can achieve in this world
[1:40:19] you might get a lot more Acclaim you
[1:40:20] might get more followers on Instagram
[1:40:22] you might make a lot more money you
[1:40:23] might have a lot more influence but let
[1:40:25] me tell you the the the
[1:40:28] satisfaction that comes with knowing
[1:40:30] that the results are far beyond anything
[1:40:32] you could ever achieve it's the greatest
[1:40:34] feeling in the world because it's Christ
[1:40:37] in you that's doing the work brother
[1:40:40] says it this
[1:40:41] way he says now look if you will take
[1:40:44] those gifts that you have and use them
[1:40:47] correctly and orderly in the church this
[1:40:50] little church will grow like everything
[1:40:53] but when you get in yourself in the
[1:40:55] flesh you'll keep it tore up as long as
[1:40:58] the church stands here that's exactly
[1:41:00] right remember what I said before we're
[1:41:03] all under the same
[1:41:04] Lord we all are under a chain of command
[1:41:07] that is bringing order not chaos not
[1:41:11] confusion not conflict he's pointing
[1:41:14] back to what Paul said be led by the
[1:41:16] spirit that's the only way that this is
[1:41:18] going to work the gift really as we said
[1:41:20] it's about being used not about using it
[1:41:24] remember what Jesus said in John he says
[1:41:26] then answered Jesus and said unto them
[1:41:28] verily verily I say unto you the son can
[1:41:30] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[1:41:32] the father do for whatsoever things he
[1:41:34] doeth those also doeth the son likewise
[1:41:39] amen we're led by the spirit we're led
[1:41:41] by the spirit and I tell you this if we
[1:41:43] are led by the spirit the results will
[1:41:44] speak for themselves 100% amen each and
[1:41:49] every one of us has a gift and a calling
[1:41:52] some of us are blessed enough to have
[1:41:54] two or three gifts four or five
[1:41:57] maybe but regardless we're placed with
[1:42:00] purpose every single one of us not a
[1:42:04] person that gets away with this listen
[1:42:06] to what Paul said a little earlier in 1
[1:42:08] Corinthians he says for I would that all
[1:42:10] men were even as
[1:42:11] myself now Paul there is talking about
[1:42:14] the fact that he is um
[1:42:17] unmarried or widowed as the case may be
[1:42:21] but now he says this but every man
[1:42:23] has his proper gift of God every person
[1:42:28] has a proper gift of God one after this
[1:42:31] manner and another after that then he
[1:42:34] would say in epes Ephesians he says
[1:42:37] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:42:38] on high he led captivity captive and
[1:42:41] gave gifts unto men now in Ephesians
[1:42:43] he's talking about the fivefold ministry
[1:42:45] where he gave preaching gifts to the
[1:42:48] five-fold ministry and then those men
[1:42:50] themselves are gifts to the body so so
[1:42:53] it's a gift to minister and then those
[1:42:55] gifts those ministers themselves are
[1:42:57] gifts to them but when we look at this
[1:42:59] word gift in 1 Corinthians and then
[1:43:01] Ephesians the word there is charisma and
[1:43:04] we look at that more as an English word
[1:43:06] because we know about charismatic people
[1:43:08] people that have Charisma and it's
[1:43:10] people that just seem to draw people to
[1:43:12] them they get along with everybody
[1:43:13] they're magnetic they make friends
[1:43:15] easily they can influence people they
[1:43:17] just seem to slide into opportunity and
[1:43:20] and and and it just seems like it's
[1:43:21] effortless the way that they connect
[1:43:23] with
[1:43:24] people now most people with what we call
[1:43:27] Charisma use it for
[1:43:29] themselves but the the original intent
[1:43:32] for Charisma is to reflect a gift
[1:43:34] something that's given with purpose it's
[1:43:37] a gift of Grace we would even call it
[1:43:39] that way each one of us has our own
[1:43:41] Charisma our own gracious gift and God
[1:43:44] has meant us to use that for his purpose
[1:43:47] to help other people so each of us has a
[1:43:50] way to be effective in the kingdom of
[1:43:52] God every single one of us without
[1:43:55] exception remember what Paul said every
[1:43:57] man has his proper gift of God one this
[1:44:00] and one that and so we can look at those
[1:44:02] people and I'm just going to dwell on
[1:44:04] the natural side of Charisma we can look
[1:44:06] at those people that have Charisma and
[1:44:07] say how can I compare to them listen I'm
[1:44:10] not known for my
[1:44:13] Charisma I can speak okay to people but
[1:44:16] I don't have a Magnetic Personality I
[1:44:19] have a few close friends and they tend
[1:44:20] to be people older than I
[1:44:24] but there are people and if I asked you
[1:44:25] to think about it may you know maybe in
[1:44:27] this church maybe not but you know
[1:44:29] people that it just seems like they can
[1:44:30] they can go anywhere and they make
[1:44:32] friends with everybody they've got a
[1:44:35] Charisma a natural Charisma that draws
[1:44:37] people to them and we can say how do I
[1:44:39] compare to them you can't so don't
[1:44:42] you're not meant to your charisma your
[1:44:45] gift is meant to work in a different way
[1:44:47] than theirs so it's not about
[1:44:49] comparisons it's never about comparisons
[1:44:52] it's about about what you've been given
[1:44:54] and how you're letting God use it that's
[1:44:56] what this is all about amen and so we're
[1:44:58] not all the same and that's why we can't
[1:45:01] have the same gifts or charism listen
[1:45:04] some of us don't like a crowd some of us
[1:45:06] like as I said to just have a few close
[1:45:10] friends and so people like that they
[1:45:13] only connect to a couple people and
[1:45:16] that's okay that's okay amen those types
[1:45:19] of people tend to have a very deep
[1:45:21] impact but it's very narrow they don't
[1:45:25] touch a lot of lives but they go real
[1:45:26] deep on the ones they touch but then you
[1:45:28] got somebody else that has a lot of
[1:45:30] natural Charisma amen and they can reach
[1:45:33] out to everybody but because we only
[1:45:35] have so much time and energy their
[1:45:37] impact is very
[1:45:39] broad but it tends to be
[1:45:42] shallow cuz they're just being friendly
[1:45:44] with everyone they'll still have a
[1:45:46] couple of close friends but their
[1:45:47] day-to-day impact is very broad but they
[1:45:49] don't get too deep with nearly the same
[1:45:51] number of people amen so Mr Broad and
[1:45:54] shallow will eventually hand people off
[1:45:57] to Mr deep and narrow I'm speaking
[1:46:00] natural Charisma but it's the same thing
[1:46:02] with gifts you see it's the same thing
[1:46:04] with gifts because we can hand off
[1:46:06] people throughout the process of using
[1:46:08] these gifts we have different things
[1:46:10] that we're doing and you know think of
[1:46:13] somebody coming to this church okay
[1:46:15] somebody that has a a gift of real
[1:46:17] friendliness and outgoingness they're
[1:46:19] going to pull them into the church
[1:46:20] aren't they and they're going to have
[1:46:22] them over a lot and they're going to
[1:46:23] follow up with them and they'll be real
[1:46:25] friendly and they'll make sure that they
[1:46:26] greet them first thinging at the door
[1:46:27] and these different things they'll go
[1:46:29] out of their way to make them feel
[1:46:30] friendly but after that we've got people
[1:46:32] that'll help and they'll go help them
[1:46:34] move into their house and we need those
[1:46:37] people listen making them friendly
[1:46:39] doesn't do a whole lot if they can't get
[1:46:40] some help they need physical practical
[1:46:43] help and then beyond that you got people
[1:46:45] that can bake and can and can deliver
[1:46:47] things and go in and the sisters go in
[1:46:48] and help them clean up their house and
[1:46:51] then you've got the brothers that can
[1:46:52] sit down and answer questions and
[1:46:54] fellowship and give them a a deeper
[1:46:56] spiritual connection so we've got a
[1:46:58] practical connection we've got spiritual
[1:46:59] connections Community connections food
[1:47:02] connections work connections whatever
[1:47:05] that might be and all of it working
[1:47:06] together helps a person become a part of
[1:47:08] this body but without the spirit we
[1:47:12] can't bring them in and they can't be a
[1:47:14] part that's still got to be there so we
[1:47:16] need to be led by the spirit and so we
[1:47:19] need public gifts and we need private
[1:47:22] gifts
[1:47:23] not everything is a show it's not meant
[1:47:26] to be a show it's meant to be about him
[1:47:29] amen that's the way it's supposed to
[1:47:30] work so I'm not saying that that that
[1:47:33] that you can't have both those things
[1:47:35] but it tends to be more polarized that
[1:47:37] people that are outgoing tend to be on
[1:47:39] the more public side and people that are
[1:47:41] in in inward focused tend to be more on
[1:47:43] the quieter side of things the unknown
[1:47:45] side and that's okay but if we lose one
[1:47:48] of them we're going to suffer we need
[1:47:51] both we need the whole side we need all
[1:47:53] of us so don't
[1:47:55] leave nobody go nobody say I'm useless
[1:47:59] we're not going to get there this
[1:48:00] service but we're going to get there
[1:48:01] next service amen that the things that
[1:48:04] look the least important when you lose
[1:48:06] them you realize how truly great they
[1:48:08] were how necessary they were that's what
[1:48:10] I mean by greatness watch how Paul says
[1:48:13] it as we start to close I've got two
[1:48:15] more pages left I
[1:48:17] think Romans 12 he says I beseech you
[1:48:19] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:48:21] that you present your bodies a Living
[1:48:23] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:48:27] is your reasonable service we said
[1:48:28] before body mind and soul Paul says for
[1:48:31] you to live and keep your body clean and
[1:48:34] and present your life to him that's
[1:48:36] reasonable you're not doing anything
[1:48:37] great by making your life re by by
[1:48:39] presenting yourself to him that's a
[1:48:41] reasonable thing for him to ask of you
[1:48:44] but he says now now be not conformed to
[1:48:47] this world but be ye transformed by the
[1:48:50] renewing of your mind that you may Pro
[1:48:52] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:48:55] and perfect will of God it takes a
[1:48:58] changing of our mindset to do that and
[1:49:00] that is the work of the Holy Spirit
[1:49:02] remember what Paul said when I was a
[1:49:03] child I spake as a child I thought as a
[1:49:05] child I did all these things as a child
[1:49:07] but when I became a man I put away
[1:49:09] childish things I went into maturity and
[1:49:12] what Paul's talking about here is a
[1:49:14] transition into maturity by the
[1:49:16] transforming of the spirit applying the
[1:49:18] word and it produces in our lives
[1:49:21] exactly what God wants
[1:49:23] and in doing that there is nobody that
[1:49:25] can do it that way except a child of God
[1:49:28] this is only for the Spirit-filled
[1:49:30] Spirit born
[1:49:33] spirit-led we are the only ones church
[1:49:36] that can show this world what is the
[1:49:38] good acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:49:42] listen you listen to some of the things
[1:49:43] that are going on in churches outside
[1:49:45] these days it is horrible how they have
[1:49:47] Twisted the word and made it of no
[1:49:50] effect but people walking through this
[1:49:52] Earth will never read a Bible but the
[1:49:55] one that we present they may never crack
[1:49:57] open the pages and see Genesis but
[1:49:59] they'll see Genesis in you and they'll
[1:50:01] see Revelation in you and they'll see
[1:50:03] all these things we may never preach a
[1:50:05] sermon except by the lives that we live
[1:50:07] and it's by proving what is that good
[1:50:10] acceptable and perfect mature will of
[1:50:14] God Amen then he says for I say that the
[1:50:20] gra through the grace given unto me to
[1:50:22] every man that is among you not to think
[1:50:24] of himself more highly than he ought to
[1:50:26] think but to think soberly catch this
[1:50:30] now according as God had dealt to every
[1:50:33] man The Measure of Faith so we're
[1:50:37] talking about gifts and we've got
[1:50:38] differences of gifts we also have
[1:50:40] different levels of the same gift listen
[1:50:43] we've all got our favorite preachers
[1:50:45] don't
[1:50:46] we why some of them have a greater gift
[1:50:49] than the rest of
[1:50:50] us and that's okay
[1:50:53] they're meant to be and do that but
[1:50:56] they've had to come to a maturity a
[1:51:00] transformation and a faith that's been
[1:51:02] given them to operate at that level of
[1:51:04] ministry okay so we're talking about
[1:51:07] measures capacities potential and Paul
[1:51:09] says it varies from person to person
[1:51:12] that means from Sister Lydia here on the
[1:51:14] front all the way back to brother Viet
[1:51:16] to back there are different levels of
[1:51:18] Faith here not only Faith let me put it
[1:51:21] this way remember what Paul says we have
[1:51:23] switched now under the Holy Spirit from
[1:51:26] Faith to the faith rather than faith in
[1:51:29] God we are now moving into the faith of
[1:51:32] God but that Faith Of God is there to
[1:51:34] operate the gift in your life the
[1:51:36] calling and the purpose of your life so
[1:51:39] every one of us has a different level so
[1:51:41] that is according to what God God gives
[1:51:47] God sets up it's God's sovereignty that
[1:51:50] does it so the question is not does
[1:51:52] brother Matt have more or less Faith
[1:51:54] than I the question is what's brother
[1:51:56] Matt doing with his faith and what am I
[1:51:58] doing with mine because if brother Matt
[1:52:00] can lift 1,000 pounds with faith and all
[1:52:02] he's lifting is 300
[1:52:04] lb that's a brother Matt
[1:52:06] problem am I doing everything that I can
[1:52:10] with the faith that he's given me see
[1:52:12] sometimes the greatest trap of a gift is
[1:52:15] that because it's easy we just do as
[1:52:17] much as everyone
[1:52:19] else but we do it faster easier simpler
[1:52:23] and then we say I'm good because I've
[1:52:24] matched everyone else God remember what
[1:52:26] scriptures Jesus said to whom much is
[1:52:29] given much is required you say brother
[1:52:31] John I'd love to have a great gift
[1:52:33] listen I've been privileged to be good
[1:52:35] friends with some of the greatest
[1:52:37] message Ministers of this world
[1:52:39] has you don't want a great gift if you
[1:52:43] understood the pain the suffering the
[1:52:46] character development the testing the
[1:52:48] trials that went into
[1:52:49] that no sir no sir I guarantee you you
[1:52:54] don't want
[1:52:56] it there is a testing that goes into
[1:53:00] that that will break most
[1:53:02] people but beyond it comes out the
[1:53:06] perfect maturity of Christ to operate
[1:53:08] the gifts that he's given
[1:53:10] them but it is a brutal brutal path
[1:53:14] because it is a dying out above and
[1:53:16] beyond what most of us could endure or
[1:53:18] willing to endure
[1:53:23] we have to use what we have to its full
[1:53:26] potential to its full
[1:53:28] potential he says for as we have many
[1:53:31] members in the
[1:53:32] body in one body and all the members
[1:53:35] have not the same office that word
[1:53:37] office means function so not all the
[1:53:38] members have the same function just as
[1:53:40] the body has many
[1:53:42] parts they all have different functions
[1:53:44] same thing with the body of Christ we
[1:53:46] aren't all here to do the same thing
[1:53:48] listen I've said this before I can walk
[1:53:50] on my hands instead of my feet
[1:53:53] a capability to do it does not mean
[1:53:55] that's my position CU if I walk on my
[1:53:58] hands how am I going to pick things up
[1:54:00] you say I can use my toes not nearly as
[1:54:02] good as you can use your fingers right
[1:54:04] let the hands do what the hands do and
[1:54:05] let the feet do what feet do okay he
[1:54:08] says so we be many are one body in
[1:54:11] Christ and everyone members one of
[1:54:13] another we're tied together we're in
[1:54:14] this together a't nobody's saying I
[1:54:17] don't like my finger chop it
[1:54:20] off but if my hand is trying to do what
[1:54:22] my foot's doing we might get annoyed at
[1:54:24] that
[1:54:25] hand find our lane and stay there he
[1:54:28] says th having then gifts differing
[1:54:30] according to
[1:54:31] what the
[1:54:33] grace I called these gracious gifts
[1:54:35] earlier this is where it comes from
[1:54:37] having then gifts differing according to
[1:54:39] the grace that is given to us whether
[1:54:42] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[1:54:45] the proportion of Faith so these are
[1:54:48] Gifts of Grace they are not Gifts of
[1:54:50] Merit a brother called them
[1:54:52] extraordinary Graces and I like that I
[1:54:54] thought that was beautifully Said So
[1:54:56] based on the gracious gifts we've
[1:54:58] received we're supposed to use it in
[1:55:00] line with the faith that we've received
[1:55:02] as well the gift is Grace and the faith
[1:55:05] is Grace you put Grace and combine it
[1:55:07] with the faith of God that he's given
[1:55:09] you it'll produce the word every time
[1:55:12] it'll produce a manifestation of God
[1:55:13] it'll produce the right result ream says
[1:55:16] it this way he says because God give you
[1:55:17] a little gift it doesn't make any
[1:55:20] different from anyone else we were just
[1:55:22] all human beings Sinners saved by his
[1:55:25] grace it's all we can make of ourselves
[1:55:28] all we can make of ourselves is a sinner
[1:55:30] saved by grace nothing else then Paul
[1:55:33] says now so he said remember he says if
[1:55:35] we're if we're prophesying let us
[1:55:37] prophesy according to the proportion of
[1:55:39] Faith he says or Ministry let us wait on
[1:55:42] our ministering or he that teacheth on
[1:55:44] teaching so in other words if your gift
[1:55:46] is service serve if your gift is
[1:55:49] preaching preach if your gift is
[1:55:52] teaching teach don't try and be a
[1:55:55] prophet don't try and be a musician
[1:55:58] don't try and be a song leader stay in
[1:56:00] your lane do what you do uh to the best
[1:56:03] ability because otherwise somebody's
[1:56:05] going to be coming down that line a
[1:56:07] whole lot faster than you and there's
[1:56:08] going to be a wreck cuz you're in his or
[1:56:11] her way now because that's their Lane if
[1:56:14] you're trying to be a prophet and you're
[1:56:15] a pastor get out of the way cuz there's
[1:56:18] a prophet coming down the road and he's
[1:56:19] going to run you over you're in his Lane
[1:56:21] you're in his way you're hold them up
[1:56:23] I've said it before there's a well-known
[1:56:25] Pastor said there are a lot of great
[1:56:26] deacons behind the pulpit and he was not
[1:56:29] he wasn't
[1:56:30] complimenting he was saying just because
[1:56:32] you can doesn't mean you should you
[1:56:34] better have a call not just an
[1:56:37] ability and you'll see the results
[1:56:39] behind those things many churches I've
[1:56:42] been in them been a part of them where
[1:56:44] they lose a pastor or whatever and what
[1:56:47] happens is a deacon Rises up and it
[1:56:50] causes problems
[1:56:53] why because they were never meant to
[1:56:54] preach but they know the word you can't
[1:56:56] deny it they can even deliver a a a a
[1:56:59] well structured sermon but they're not
[1:57:02] anointed they're not gifted to preach
[1:57:04] and so they're out of their
[1:57:06] position he says now or he that
[1:57:08] exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth
[1:57:10] let him do it with Simplicity and he
[1:57:12] that ruleth with diligence and he that
[1:57:14] showeth Mercy with cheerfulness I'm
[1:57:16] going to end just here very shortly like
[1:57:17] I said I've got actually I had two more
[1:57:19] pages now I've got two more pages one
[1:57:21] and a half but watch what he says how
[1:57:23] Paul puts it he says exhorters exhort we
[1:57:26] have exhorters here we have brother Mark
[1:57:28] that will get up from time to time and
[1:57:29] we have brother Paul that'll do that
[1:57:31] from time to time amen that's a gift and
[1:57:34] it has its
[1:57:35] place but it doesn't it doesn't put out
[1:57:38] the preaching and it doesn't replace the
[1:57:41] preaching of the word but it's an
[1:57:42] exhortation from the word and it's meant
[1:57:44] for our good and we enjoy it and we
[1:57:47] appreciate it and it brings Clarity and
[1:57:49] it brings instruction in these different
[1:57:51] things
[1:57:52] but it's not there to replace preaching
[1:57:54] it's there to supplement it and it's a
[1:57:57] gift and it's a blessing to the body so
[1:57:59] God bless you brother Mark and brother
[1:58:00] Paul at home amen now then Paul says now
[1:58:03] he says at the end he says he that
[1:58:05] showeth mercy be cheerful about it now
[1:58:08] this one's a tough one because we'd all
[1:58:10] like to somebody grinned and giggled we
[1:58:14] all like to think we're
[1:58:16] merciful but notice if you've got a gift
[1:58:19] of Mercy you can show Mercy with
[1:58:23] cheerfulness that means why do we show
[1:58:26] Mercy we show Mercy when somebody has
[1:58:28] done something wrong and they deserve
[1:58:30] judgment and we go and we show them
[1:58:33] Mercy he says you'll know you have a
[1:58:35] gift of Mercy by the attitude you do it
[1:58:37] with because if you can't show Mercy
[1:58:40] having had your rights
[1:58:44] trampled and still be cheerful you're
[1:58:47] fooling yourself you ain't got a gift of
[1:58:49] Mercy you might be showing Mercy but it
[1:58:51] ain't a gift if we can't show Mercy
[1:58:54] without begrudging the person the very
[1:58:56] thing we're giving them it ain't a gift
[1:58:59] of Mercy listen if we've got a gift of
[1:59:01] Mercy we'll give it if we never receive
[1:59:04] it we'll show them something that
[1:59:07] they're never going to give to us that's
[1:59:09] a gift because the gift remember is not
[1:59:12] dependent on what happens when it goes
[1:59:14] out it's dependent on what happened on
[1:59:16] the inside it's God operating that gift
[1:59:19] amen you'll be merciful no matter what
[1:59:22] then he says about the the gift of
[1:59:24] giving he says it let it be done in
[1:59:26] Simplicity that word means do it with
[1:59:28] pureness of heart with clear intentions
[1:59:31] and unselfishly in other words you don't
[1:59:34] talk about your giving I have a brother
[1:59:37] that reached out to me a while ago year
[1:59:39] and a half ago and he said brother if
[1:59:41] you know of anyone that has a serious
[1:59:44] Financial need through no fault of their
[1:59:47] own he says let me know and I will help
[1:59:49] them and he did not put a dollar figure
[1:59:52] limit on
[1:59:55] that and there's only a few pastors know
[1:59:58] that he does
[1:59:59] this he doesn't tell other people he
[2:00:02] doesn't put out a notice to the church
[2:00:05] what's he doing he's guarding his gift
[2:00:08] by keeping himself out of it he doesn't
[2:00:10] want his name associated he gives
[2:00:13] anonymously he doesn't even people don't
[2:00:15] even know where it came from what's he
[2:00:18] doing he's letting God get the
[2:00:20] glory while he's being used amen his
[2:00:25] gift is to give not to talk about
[2:00:27] himself and it's a wonderful
[2:00:29] thing and we'll see that as we go that
[2:00:31] every good gift that's being used of God
[2:00:34] is Not self- serving it's not
[2:00:35] self-promoting it's not bragging these
[2:00:38] different things it might develop a
[2:00:39] reputation for you I believe a good gift
[2:00:42] think scripture
[2:00:44] says a gift goes before a man and it's
[2:00:47] speaking of literally you send a gift
[2:00:49] before you to prepare the way to open
[2:00:50] the doors but gift a Godly gift in your
[2:00:53] life will open doors it'll open
[2:00:55] relationships it'll open you up to be
[2:00:57] able to influence people in these
[2:00:58] different things but it takes character
[2:00:59] to do that and so often that's what
[2:01:01] holds back the true revealing of the
[2:01:03] gift is we don't have the character yet
[2:01:06] I've always wondered why didn't I why
[2:01:08] didn't even I feel a call to generally
[2:01:10] preach really preach until I was 35 and
[2:01:13] the only thing I come up with is he had
[2:01:14] some work to
[2:01:15] do and that's okay what matters is he
[2:01:19] gets me there not in my timing but in
[2:01:21] his timing and God spent 35 years hiding
[2:01:25] that call in my life to preach until I
[2:01:26] was ready to go three quotes as we close
[2:01:30] brother BR puts it this way we see
[2:01:32] motive and objective is a big thing here
[2:01:34] let your objective be right let your
[2:01:36] motive be right so let what you want to
[2:01:39] happen be the right thing and why you
[2:01:41] want it to
[2:01:43] happen he says for anything outside of
[2:01:46] the right motive and right objective God
[2:01:48] can't use it that's pretty flat that's
[2:01:51] pretty flat if you're not wanting the
[2:01:53] right thing for the right reason God
[2:01:55] God's not going to be in it he says
[2:01:57] sometimes I've read this before but it's
[2:02:00] a good check sometimes God can bless a
[2:02:02] man and give him a little ministry
[2:02:03] that's maybe a little better than his
[2:02:05] Brethren and then he clarifies he says
[2:02:07] or not better just something a little
[2:02:09] different from his Brethren and the
[2:02:11] first thing you know that man becomes
[2:02:13] exalted with his chest out and he would
[2:02:15] brush you off the street he said and
[2:02:17] that's the time that I believe that man
[2:02:18] has started out the door cuz God can't
[2:02:20] use a person like that sometimes God
[2:02:22] give you a little bit just to see what
[2:02:23] you do with it and if you can use it in
[2:02:26] humility for the benefit of others what
[2:02:28] does he do he comes and he gives you
[2:02:30] more remember the the the parable of the
[2:02:32] talents listen he gave a different
[2:02:35] amount of talents to every single one
[2:02:36] and we can use that metaphorically or we
[2:02:38] can use it literally we are given
[2:02:40] talents and some people are very gifted
[2:02:42] but it's like I said before are we using
[2:02:44] them for him or are we just letting them
[2:02:46] sit and you had the one that that had
[2:02:49] the the the the five or the 10 and he
[2:02:51] went and he doubled
[2:02:52] it a wonderful thing but the one that
[2:02:56] had five he went and he doubled it to
[2:02:58] but then the one that had one he just
[2:02:59] went and buried it in the napkin in the
[2:03:01] in the in the ground and said yeah I I
[2:03:03] know that you're a person that goes and
[2:03:05] and you benefit where you didn't sew and
[2:03:07] I don't like the way you do things and
[2:03:09] so I just decided not to do anything
[2:03:10] with what you gave me and then what did
[2:03:12] Jesus say that man will do he'll s take
[2:03:15] from him that has the little and give it
[2:03:17] to him that has a lot because the one
[2:03:19] that has a lot is going to use it for me
[2:03:21] he says from him that had little will be
[2:03:23] taken away to give to that which has
[2:03:25] much why cuz the ones that have much are
[2:03:27] because they prove them themselves when
[2:03:29] the first little things to build to the
[2:03:31] bigger
[2:03:32] things it takes character takes hum
[2:03:36] humility to be able to move with god
[2:03:38] brother B would say humility is power
[2:03:40] with God that's the greatest thing
[2:03:41] you'll see with gifts is that you are
[2:03:43] used and you don't force and that allows
[2:03:46] him to produce a wonderful result last
[2:03:49] quote he says and every little gift that
[2:03:52] you have don't use it to try and make it
[2:03:55] some great something for ourselves he
[2:03:57] says let's make it for the kingdom of
[2:04:00] God to work with everyone gifts aren't
[2:04:06] selective listen I might like to work
[2:04:09] really a lot with brother Mark but if
[2:04:12] brother Matt's the one that has the need
[2:04:14] of my gift I work with brother Matt or
[2:04:18] Brother David or brother Garfield or
[2:04:20] brother Joe it doesn't matter the gift
[2:04:23] has nothing to do with the person on the
[2:04:26] receiving end if the need is there we
[2:04:28] use
[2:04:29] it okay we can work with everyone to try
[2:04:34] to uplift the cause of Jesus Christ for
[2:04:37] his coming as soon amen God bless you
[2:04:40] let's stand
[2:04:45] together again some down home cooking
[2:04:48] rubber meets the road
[2:04:51] I am I believe we are so blessed in this
[2:04:54] church with the gifts and the helps and
[2:04:57] the supports and the different things
[2:04:59] everything from worship to
[2:05:01] Administration to offices and these
[2:05:03] different
[2:05:05] things but are we LED that's always the
[2:05:08] question we need to ask ourselves are we
[2:05:10] LED and if we are LED it takes me out of
[2:05:13] the equation it takes you out of the
[2:05:15] equation and it puts him up and it puts
[2:05:17] those that you're serving in a place
[2:05:20] that's higher than our own will
[2:05:22] our own desire our own preferences our
[2:05:24] own emotions our own relationships these
[2:05:26] different things amen and it calls us to
[2:05:29] lay our lives down so that the Holy
[2:05:32] Spirit could use us for something that
[2:05:34] takes real
[2:05:35] character that takes real patience that
[2:05:38] takes a real dying out that takes a life
[2:05:41] of prayer that takes a life of just
[2:05:44] saying Lord use me use me and in
[2:05:48] sincerity when he moves to use you let
[2:05:51] him use you amen we're going to talk a
[2:05:54] little bit more about that on Sunday
