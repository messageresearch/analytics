people we pray heavenly father lord many not here today lord many in a position where they can attend even heavenly father we pray a special blessing to those people lord that you have ministered to each one here and there we pray heavenly father lord just speak through your word now we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you turn the scriptures to john chapter 14 in john chapter 14 and good to be back in the house of the lord this evening i'm not sure who ordered the rain but i think we needed it i never thought i'd say that in newfoundland that we needed the rain but i think we did so i'm grateful for it amen john chapter 14 let's start at verse 12. it says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and we see here that jesus is pointing to a continuation of his works and the true believers amen that it's not just something that started and ended with him but he's going to continue to do those things through another group of people verse 13 says and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it what a statement what a promise if you ask anything in my name i will do it and then he says if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you there he says dwelleth that means there's someone present and then he says shall be in the future he's saying what you have here with you today is what's going to be with you in the future it's the same christ in a different form amen he says i will not leave you comfortless can i get a just a move on the the slide there it's not really working back here thank you it says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you it's hard to see a trinity in these scriptures isn't it yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me and because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you what day it's the day that he said in verse 19 the day that where he lives you live also and you see him he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our abode with him and then god bless you you can have your seats this evening god bless the reading of his word and we're going to get into our back to our our series in just a moment but before we do we have a uh an announcement to make so i got a message this afternoon and brother ellie wants to announce his engagement to sister rachel and bikay from montreal canada so he's been courting her since september of last year and they just uh got their engagement um it happened in as you can see in front of the eiffel tower in the city of love paris france and so they will be getting married september of next year and again in montreal canada so um i guess if anyone's wanting to go to the wedding this is the one to go to it's certainly a lot closer and a lot easier but he asked me to announce that to the church so he's going to spend a week when he comes back from paris in there just i guess making some arrangements and whatnot and then he'll be back again so he wanted me to announce that to the church he wanted me to thank brother gerald in particular because he says brother gerald tells him that he's been praying for him to find a great wife for many years so he's he's attributing all of this to brother gerald or at least a great deal of it to brother gerald so if anybody's looking to get married talk to brother gerald apparently his prayers work so anyways we certainly want to ask god's blessing to brother ellie and sister rachel i i like how they have rochelle and rachel for people like brother mark who can keep names straight so well so i'm sure we'll see many many fumbles with this as we move forward but uh and then god bless brother ellie and sister rachel amen we're gonna as i said continue with our series on in his form with his mind and i want to take a subtitle this evening of the master builder and we're starting to see now as we've read in our scripture that we're making the transition now from jesus christ in that in that fullness of the godhead bodily in that one body and he's talking about a time now where he's going to step into a multi-member body where he's going to do a continuation of his works where it's going to be in many people and he says they're going to see in you the very same things that they see in me and i'm going to be with you and i'm going to love you and you're going to keep my commandments and it's going to be this this great big wonderful building that i'm going to build amen and he calls it a church amen and we know that word church called means the called out ones and we've got a lot of different meanings for the word church these days certainly but jesus had a very particular meaning and unfortunately in most places that that word church has lost its meaning certainly the original meaning that that jesus had and if we go back to matthew 16 he says in matthew 16 verse 15 and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven so he's saying it doesn't matter who you've been talking to who you've been fellowshipping with who your pastor is who the great ministries you've been around peter the great priest you've heard that is not who's revealed this to you this has come directly from the father in heaven and he says and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it this is where the word church is coming from originally and it's it's coming from jesus definition and it's a building or it's a body that he's going to build that's the definition of church and he's playing a little word game here because that word peter if you go back to the original language it means petra which is the word for rock and so he's playing he's playing a little game of words here and he's saying i'm going to build it on on this rock peter i'm going to build it on the rock rock or little rock and so we see the catholic church took this and they ran with it and they said that he was going to build the church on peter and they say that peter was the first pope and and he's the foundation of the of the catholic church and the true church of god and all these different things but that's not what jesus is talking about watch what happens here in verse 19 because he says and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged to his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ it's amazing here that he says don't tell everybody the greatest revelation that you're going to need to have to be a member of this church why because just telling them isn't going to make it telling them isn't going to do it how often do we tell people about god how often do we tell people about the message of the hour and it doesn't do anything for them why because it's not quick unto them it's not a revelation to them and jesus says this is for a group right now this is for an elect group that's going to hear this message and then later you're going to take that message and because of what happens to you it's going to have an effect on the hearer amen there's a time and there's a season for people to understand who i am and it's not now so he's saying keep this to yourself because it wouldn't have done any good if he went around telling amen but he's telling peter he says look it's not an intellectual idea you can share i can't go share these things with everybody i can't convince somebody into the building of the church of god it's not going to happen you can certainly share things but that's not what's going to make it happen it's going to have to be a revelation from above and he says you wouldn't have even been able to voice this if god didn't put it in your heart to say it that's how great that revelation is is that there's nothing that he could have pulled it from from a past experience from a past sermon or anything else that would have given him this revelation but he says god came down and put that in your heart peter and that's why you're able to speak those words out of your mouth when i ask you about that i love that because now jesus he says there's a revelation here but with it comes something else because he says peter what's going to come with this revelation with the truth of this revelation is that you're going to get the keys to the kingdom now peter has an idea in his head of that jesus is the christ but he doesn't have an idea of what it means in the fullness of jesus the christ because the christ is what the anointed one and so peter he has this idea of jesus the christ being the anointed one that's standing in front of him but there's a greater revelation that's going to come to him of what it means to be the christ because we see how that anointing is going to pass from jesus down to a group of believers and that's where peter's going to start to see the fullness of what it means to be the christ the anointed one and he's going to see himself in that picture amen he's given the keys to the kingdom here jesus says and he's still unsaved remember he said to peter he says when thou art converted strengthened thy brothers he's not even converted he's he has a revelation from god and yet he's not even converted he still doesn't have power he still doesn't have the means to live the life that he's supposed to live amen but jesus is saying this revelation peter that you've got it's going to take you someplace special and you don't even have a clue about that peter doesn't even know what a church is right then he has no idea what that's going to look like because all they know would be solomon's great temple perhaps or something like that a great building of of god's design and god's preference that's that's meant for god to dwell in but there's going to be a changing now there's a transition from a temple where men worship to a temple where god lives and that's what peter's got to be looking forward to but he has no clue about it you know today when it when it comes to this idea of a church we say we're going to church and what we really mean is we're going to a building that's called a church but that's not the church that jesus was talking about him and we're going to have a service and we're going to have singing and we're going to have praise and worship and shouting and maybe dancing and laying out of hands and preaching of the word but that's not church that's us attending a service that's dedicated to god amen in the denominational world today they'll have you join their church right and they'll have you write your name on a book or or they'll just have you you know in some way signify that you're a member of that church and to them what is a church a church is a group of like-minded people and the trap we can get caught into is that we have a group of like-minded people here that is not what makes us a church because it's by one spirit you're born into this church amen it is not like-minded in the sense that you believe and i believe him and everything we say lines up with each other but it's because we have a certain mindset that is from christ that makes us one and that only comes through the living of the spirit within our lives amen so like-minded people is not good enough there's been a ton of like-minded people i've spent my life around in church and outside of church in certain areas and guess what that's not what makes us a member of the church of christ amen it's got to be something deeper it's got to be something greater than that but the church started with what christ said here and he says i'm going to build a church so it's going to be something that's of his building and it's not of our building now it's funny because we we talk about all these definitions of church but i think the greatest revelation of church is found in my young son samuel because he knows exactly what church is because what happened the last time that brother jared was preaching he stepped out of the office and samuel pointed to him and he said church and then he saw brother mark outside and he said church and he saw brother bob and he says church and he sees this one and that one and he says church amen now he doesn't really know i'm playing around a little bit but that's what church is it is a church of it is a group of people that have the same spirit inside of them amen that they have a life inside of them that's the building that god is preparing in all these things it's a group of called out people that have dedicated their lives to the service of god and to the obedience of his word amen not just to obey it but to manifest the very thing that it says about them amen they are identified with it and they're identified in it it's not just a religion it's not just a covering it's not just a creed it's not just a lifestyle but it is life itself inside of them amen so that's why you can't say if you don't attend our church you're not going in a rapture how many have heard that doctrine before you see it certainly in the ones that pull away and they get pulled into the thunders movement or the two souls movement or the deity movement or parousia and all these things and they'll say if you don't go to our church if you don't sit under our pastor then you're not going in the rapture well jesus said he was going to pull him out of every tongue and out of every nation and out of every tribe every land every color so unless you have one of everybody in your church then it doesn't meet the criteria for the true church of jesus christ amen so when somebody says if you're not sitting under my pastor you're not going to make it then you say that's a lie from hell because that's not the way it works it's because it's a building of his calling and it's a building of his making and it's by his spirit not by the working of men that he's going to do it necessarily now he's got men working and he's got women working that's not not what we're talking about but the point is is that it's not dependent on one ministry amen it's dependent on the holy spirit inside of you quickening that seed that's going to bring you up in the in the last days or take you in a rapture amen brother brown we'll put it this way he says the anointing is a person that's why peter didn't quite get it even though he said thou art the christ the son of the living god he recognized it there but he didn't recognize it in the way it was going to come the word christ means anointed one see the anointed one then moses was christ in his days here you're seeing christ is the mystery of god revealed moses was christ in his days he was the anointed one jeremiah was christ in his days with a portion of the word for that day but when jesus came he came as the redeemer anointed one and that was both moses and all that was in moses and all the word and all the godhead bodily was in him that's the reason the whole temple veil was rent and the mercy seat come in perfect view because he was the anointed one notice now he says the veil in human flesh the promised word to this age must also be veiled notice though sin-loving church members and sinners cannot see it because of the human veil so brother brown says look there's going to be a same veiling and unveiling of the word in this age no different than it was with christ in that the word has to be veiled and it's going to be unveiled but he says look not everybody's going to recognize what's going to happen here now the first one he says is going to miss it he talks about sinners and that's the obvious one we say of course the sinners aren't going to recognize if they recognized it then they come in and they'd be a part of it but the one that we've got to look at here is he says the sin loving church members because these are what we've heard in the that tape and uh three kinds of believers these are what the pretended brothers and sisters these are the make-believers these are the people that live the lifestyle but they don't have the life inside of them and he says they're going to completely miss the veiling and the unveiling of the word in their age why because they won't be a part of it and if you're not a part of it chances are you're not even going to recognize it or see it you might see it after we're all gone out of here but when you really need to see it you'll miss it completely they missed it with the prophet of god right they missed it with them by the end they said you're off on your doctrine we love the gifts we love the signs but you're off on your doctrine and they put them out of their church and what was it they were putting christ out of the church why it was the word coming to them it was the anointed one that was coming to them bringing with them a message that would take them out of laodicea and they kicked him out and so he's standing on the outside trying to knock in there there's only one voice to this age and it is a prophetic voice to the angel of the church of laodicea right there's only one voice every one of us even myself and brother joe we are not a different voice we're the same voice saying the same thing we're doing the exact same thing that he said because why we heeded what he said we heard what he said and now we're repeating it to everyone else that will give us a chance and let us hear let them hear it amen but that doesn't mean that he was only talking about himself he was talking about himself in this this is 1964 halfway through the year he's talking about himself here but he's also talking about a bride amen it's not a new doctrine for the prophet in 1964 this is not something he started talking about after the opening of the seals this has been consistent through his entire uh ministry and we look all the way back in 1956 he's doing discernment in front of the people and he's showing god in a man it was a wave offering it was a chief offering it was a a presentation of what was coming of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god and he's about to do that in front of the people now it wasn't the fullness but it was god in a man we've got to be able to see that because if you can't see it in him you won't see it in you amen you may not have the same gift as brother brown the same calling but it's got to be no different in terms of the god that's inside of you and he says here then if he's raised from the dead he's no more in a corporal body but he's in our body 1956 all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into the church see so it's just a continuation so when you stop and say it was only the prophet there is no continuation because he's dead in terms of this world he's dead he says in that day you'll know that i'm the father and the fathers of me and i and you see all together the holy spirit working among his people so he's saying it's not just a prophet but this is a group of people this is a church this is a group of called out ones and i believe it's one of the greatest followings we have around the message today is that people put the anointing of christ on brother branham and they won't put it on themselves they'll say that was for the prophet that was exclusive to the prophet and they won't put that anointing on themselves gifts absolutely i don't believe we'll ever see a gift like brother branham had ever again why because he was the angel of the age he had to be something special amen but that doesn't mean that the anointing of the christ doesn't come on each and every one of us because jesus said i'm going to be with you and i'm going to be even in you right i'm going to be a comfort to you i'm going to be life within you i'm going to be all of these things and so we sit there and we put it all in that prophet and we say we're going to just sit here and listen and he's going to be the main but he's saying no no no this is for all of us this is a feast for all of us to feed from amen the word doesn't just come to me but it's got to come out for me and it's got to go into you and it's got to come out of you in the same way that it's come to me and then it's a multi-member body and you saw you've got a group of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of people today and they've got that prophet up here and they'll never get up there because they say he's different than the rest of us and in the body of christ he's no different than the rest of us he is a manifested son of god and we're just looking to come to the same level amen manifested sons and daughters of god how many times in the service did the prophet he you know he go through the prayer lines and and then he the people's faith would come up and he'd say now you lay hands on that one next to you and you do it and you do it he'd say this is what it's all about it's not about me it's about you it's about getting you to your place in christ recognizing who and what you are remember that that sister was out there and she she gave her prayer card to somebody else and then she went and she goes and she prays for a woman and she gets healed and then that woman comes up and brother bram says you're already healed and that sister out there prayed and then i believe don't quote me i believe he says now sister you gave up your prayer card here's your need and he he said jesus christ heals you as well but he says that woman when she prayed out there for you in the congregation you were healed at that moment right he says i don't need to pray for you anymore what is it your faith has made you well jesus said i didn't do anything half the time he said your faith does it your faith did and he said her faith did it i didn't you don't need anything for me she's done the work already listen to this 1962 before the opening of the seals he says let me ask you something do you believe with all your heart jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe how many believes then lay your hands on one another if you're a believer you're as much a child of his you're as much his child as i am so he's saying the limitation is not on on who and what you are the limitation is do you believe who you are he says you're no different than i when it comes to the throne of god to the throne of mercy to to a pool of healing whatever you might want to call it he says you're no different than i when it comes to these matters you can do the same things i can do he says what is it it's a vindication that he's here he says oh can't we come in sincerity now after his word and after his presence what's he saying don't sell yourself short i'm just a wife i'm just a mother i'm just a dad at home i'm just a worker i'm just a young person he says listen if you're a child of god that's been filled with the spirit there's no difference between you and me amen you say brother john you can put yourself at the level as the prophet of god he said i could the word says i can so the only question is like he said do you believe it that's what he's challenging the people will you believe that you're in the same position that i am now you may not be as mature yet god may not be able to use you the same yet but when it comes to the redemptive gifts that he got for us at calvary and when we look at the gifts of the holy spirit and these things there is no limitation if you're a son you're a daughter of god then everything's available to you amen brother brown would say this he'd say this morning was more of the sermon type placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation god being revealed in christ how many believes it god was revealed in christ jehovah was revealed in christ he says now where's god to be revealed in his church with his people in us the same spirit the same works the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering gentleness patience peace mercy all that was in christ is in the church he says now remember keep this in mind all that god was he poured into christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that christ was he poured into the church god above us god with us and god in us the triunity of god god manifested in three different manners father son and holy spirit now notice here he doesn't cherry pick with signs and wonders because that's what people will do they'll say you'll know you're a child of god when the signs and wonders are there but brother branham's not saying that because the scripture doesn't says these signs shall lead it says these signs shall follow so what leads what leads is what he says here the life longsuffering patience and mercy and grace and all these different things he says you've got to have a life change first before he can start using you so he changes you and then he uses you and we flipped it now to you say i won't believe that i'm a son or a daughter of god until i'm laying hands on the sick and they're being made well that's what follows and that may be 10 or 15 or 20 years down the road that may be 50 years down the road for you but that doesn't make you any less a child of god but has your life been changed and does it reflect the word that's more what he's concerned about is have you had the change of the holy spirit and dwelling inside of you amen if you keep going to 1962 and he's talking about why christ is living in us and working in us and he says all that christ was he poured into the church what is it anointed one con to continue his work that his word might live constantly because he's never dead right if you have eternal life inside of you then the same kind of life that jesus lived is supposed to be living in you and he says that's the purpose for all of this is so that god's word can live constantly not just be preached not just be taught but it's a life lived remember that quote where it says lived voices thundering out that's what he's looking for his lives lived according to the word lives lived by the word lives that are the word that's what we're that's what we're looking for above all else it says he lived by the word of the father man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god and the church doesn't live by bread alone but by the word of christ and the holy spirit comes in and takes the word of christ and makes it a living action today and then he says these signs shall follow them that believe signs do have to follow it's a dead church if there's no signs it's a dead church if there's no wonders you can have births but that burst got to bring you to a place of maturity and those signs and wonders have to follow amen but he's saying the life's got to be lived the living word and then it has an effect on others as well and then what's god's purpose that his word might live constantly that's our heritage that's what we look back in the book of acts amen that's our heritage because we're being pointed back to the faith of those same people and our heritage is that the word lives to us the same word that it did through jesus christ amen what can hinder us what hinders us as we ask in the last service what is it that holds us back from that what's worth it what's worth the hindrances that we deal with day in and day out and are they of our own allowing amen are they of our own choosing or has satan gotten one over on us amen the worst is when we allow it in and our time and our energy is put into things that have nothing to do with god and the kingdom of god and then we sit there and we say why aren't these things following us because we've allowed the hindrances in that are keeping us from stepping into a greater relationship with god amen now i want to step back a little bit in into matthew 16 because i want to just anchor a couple things as we start to move forward and in matthew 16 18 it says and i also say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now i mentioned i want to hit on this portion about upon this rock again we said the catholic church says that christ was going to build the church and peter was the first pope and he's the foundation well guess what peter is not the foundation amen no other foundation can be laid other than christ and then paul tells us later we're going to read it in a little bit but we see that even peter had to be corrected and a foundation has to be perfect a foundation have to be perfect if there's cracks in it if there's flaws in it then it's no foundation so peter himself couldn't be it the funny thing is who corrected peter it was paul so if you were going to pick anyone to be a pope it should be paul because he corrected the pope so if you correct the pope i don't think he's the pope right paul was the highest order in the church back then right he went in he had to he had to correct peter so peter couldn't be the foundation i mean that's blown completely out of the water but what was jesus meaning when he said i'll build my my church upon this rock did peter could peter couldn't even understand what he was talking about let me just put it that way brother bram says he said blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you he says you never learned it in some school of theology you never learned it in any other way but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it you know how you've got it hell can't prevail against it what that means is hell can't overcome it hell can't change your position hell can't change your mindset hell can't change your approach hell can't change you because you're anchored to something that is immovable and unchangeable amen when you can't be shaken that's how you know you're on a firm foundation that's how you know when you're on this foundation until it's settled in your life you're always going to have issues what does he say it is he says it's spiritual revealed truth of jesus christ now people will go left on this they'll say it's the seven seals they'll say it's godhead it's water baptism it's serpent seed it's marriage and divorce and all these things they'll say that's that's what he's talking about here no no no that's not what he's talking about here because remember we're talking about a foundation amen he says if you're just all worked up and emotional that won't work either you can go to youth camps you can go to special meetings every day of your life that's not going to do it it'll feel great but that's not going to settle you he says it's got to be a direct witness that means it's got to be firsthand to you not somebody told you not somebody made you not somebody shared with you but it's got to be yours and yours alone it's got to be a direct witness that god himself by election has called you and revealed christ to you so mama doesn't do it and daddy doesn't do it and brother gerald doesn't do it and the five-fold ministry doesn't do it it's christ and christ alone that reveals himself to you and he lets you know you're one of mine amen and it's not by your choosing but it's by my choosing remember he says he that god himself by election has called you so you didn't have anything to do with this in the first place he elected you he chose you he cut you out of that piece of cloth and said this is a part of my bride this is my bride right here and they didn't choose themselves he chose you because if you ever think that you had a part in it then you can also be you can also be convinced out of it because if you can say i had a part in then you can say i have a part to take myself out but if you recognize that you always were and you always will be no matter your condition then that's going to be something that anchors you amen nothing's going to move you when you realize that he's the one that called you he's the one that's holding you and he's the one that's guaranteed you all the way to the end that this started way before you ever came into this world right back in the mind of god in eternity and it doesn't finish until you go all the way back to eternity again and in between you're going to be involved in that you're going to make some decisions you're going to make it easier you're going to make it hard but from the start to the finish it was him and it's him all the way through and it's just grace that keeps you moving in between amen but what you've got to do is this part where he says you've got to have a direct witness that he's called you and he's revealed christ to you you've got to do that with what the scripture says that you've got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you got to be sure that he's called you you got to be sure that he has filled you with the holy spirit you've got to be sure that you were in his mind before the world began and when you're sure and guess what sometimes that does take a lot of fear and trembling it takes tears it takes time down on your knees it takes time with god saying lord i need a confirmation lord i need an affirmation lord i need proof in my life that you're with me and that takes what fear and trembling that's going before god you got to be honest with god you got to be honest and say i'm not sure now don't let satan use it as a wedge to drive into your life but you say god i'm looking for you to be real to me and guess what if you do that he'll make himself real to you amen absolutely he will i can say it from a young man of 17 years old all the way to almost my 43rd year now when you go to god and you ask for more of him or or for him to do more in your life he'll always do it he just doesn't always do it the way you think he will let me add that in there for the younger people especially amen but i can't do that for you i'm not a good enough preacher to do that for you nobody is it doesn't matter if we had brother ron spencer brother donnie reagan and brother tim pruitt up here simultaneously they can't do that for you you have to have it settled in your own heart amen brethren says he says some people come to church just for the emotional part some people come to church just to sing some people come to church just to enjoy the good singing that's all right i love good singing i love a special i love a special where they're like me they cry and then they get better as they go that's me that's why i don't sing specials it's not because i have a bad voice it's because i cry right i love good singing he says some people come to church and join church just to hide their meanness i don't know if i've ever met that one but make themselves a little better name in the neighborhood that one i've definitely met some come to church sincerely but don't never have a touch from god that's a horrible place to be but when god calls a man he says no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that comes i will give him everlasting life and raise him up at the last day he says oh i hope you see it brother it's the work of the holy spirit revealing to the individual not upon some emotion that's why we don't try and get our young people to shout but we like it when they shout but we don't try and get them to shout not upon something you should do or shouldn't do or this that or the other all those things are all right the moves and works and shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues all those things are all right we don't quench that but it's never going to be a proof he says but the first thing it has to be a spiritual revelation that god has given the individual that jesus christ is the son of god calling not just something back there not just a man that gave his life for you on the cross but he's here today calling that's what you've got to be satisfied with that's right he says without that brother you're only impersonating you're only pretending but i understand the seven seals i know the godhead i know the truth of water baptism and all these different things you can't start with doctrine that's something that comes up from the foundation but he says you've got to start with a personal experience here where you know that he's called you and that he's alive and well today and that he wants you to give your life remember those old we probably don't maybe as as canadians we don't see it that much but they used to have those those uh posters during the world wars and it was uncle sam remember and he had the the finger and he says i want you it was for the war draft right and the soldiers guess what you've got to recognize that god's doing the same thing and he's saying i want you you personally not you generally but you personally and you hear that voice and you feel that call to you amen what i'm trying to get to is that he's the one that builds the church and it starts with his call and it starts with his work not yours amen and so if it's his to start with when can you ever add anything to it because everything we do is going to be tested and tried scripture talks about in revelation that every man's work is going to be tried by what fire and the only thing that'll last is something that's done in his name with his will that's the only thing that's left so guess what you may be doing things but it's got to be god working through you and leading and guiding you for anything that's built on this foundation to stand so if you don't get him at the beginning and you start with doctrine and you start with good works and all these different things then you're going to be hopelessly doomed because it's just straw and stubble it's just things that you're pulling from life and experience and things you've heard over the pulpit to try and build up a life build yourself into a church that god can inhabit no he's saying i want to build the church i want to do this so let me start at the ground floor and i'll build you up into something that's worth talking about amen and that means every aspect not just coming to church not just giving your heart to the lord but as you grow and as you mature in your careers and your marriages and your ministries and your works and your gifts and all these things it's all got to be brought subject to that leadership and that call because unless he's doing it it's all going to fade away anyways amen we see an example of this i know i've spoken about it but part of this jumped out to me while i was studying here in acts 1 and remember they're in the they're in the upper room and they're waiting for power from god right the holy ghost hadn't fallen and then peter mr keys to the kingdom decides that he's going to take you know make make use of this spare time that they have up there since they've been waiting so long and in acts 1 he says in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about 120 men and brethren this scripture must needs be fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spoke before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry now this man purchased the field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem in so much as that field is called in their proper tongue that is to say the field of blood for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishopric let another take now i want you to catch here in verse 19 and 20 that peter has the word for what he's about to do he's got a scripture he's gone in he's identified something that he believes applies to the situation and he says listen we've got to fulfill the word that's what he's saying here he's saying we've got to fulfill the word we've lost one of the 12. we know they're supposed to be 12. so we've got to come up with a 12th and he's preaching to the people and guess what he hasn't been endued with power from on high yet he hasn't stepped into he's stepping into the role without the commission being truly there because he doesn't have the holy spirit yet he hasn't been endued with power but he's got the word he thinks according to his own interpretation so he stands up and he tries to take charge to bring what the creation of a church that's what he's doing he's saying the church is supposed to have 12 let's get the 12th this is the start of a denomination right peter the rock the man with the keys to the kingdom is trying to start a denomination here and he doesn't even realize it because what he's doing by the thought and choice of men something that god was going to do himself amen that's a scary thing to think about that a man of the caliber of peter and the call and ministry of peter would make such a mistake as this and what's he doing he's trying to put a man in of his choosing and their choosing not of god's it says wherefore of these men which have company with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and among us beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection so he says let's pick somebody that's with been with us from the very beginning from the ministry of john all the way through until jesus was resurrected and we saw him and then we saw his ascension he says we've got to get somebody that has a proof of his resurrection with their own eyes now we'd say that's a great criteria that's about as good as you want is somebody that's been faithful and true and has seen it all has been part of the signs and wonders part of the gifts has heard jesus has been faithful through all of the trials and testing that's a great choice peter but who did god pick god picked a man named saul who was a persecutor of the church and guess what paul had to have a proof of the resurrection did you know that peter's criteria is good it's just applied to the wrong man because because paul having never seen jesus in a resurrected form still had proof of his resurrection because the proof of his resurrection was in a light that knocked him off of his horse on the road to damascus right they had to have somebody in there that knew that christ was alive even though they'd never seen him come out of the grave why because that was a prophet to then age that was going to go and he was going to go all over the area there and he was going to say he's alive and well because i've met him and i've talked to him and this is the effect he had on me and this is what he's done in my life peter and them they all had the physical they had the eyesight they had the memories of it all paul didn't have that paul had a supernatural experience with a risen christ that even they couldn't comprehend because they were tied to their natural paul was tied to a supernatural experience that proved that god was still alive and well amen it says and they appointed two joseph called barcelous who was surnamed justice and matthias and they prayed and said thou lord which knows the hearts of all men shall whether of these two thou has shone chosen they're praying to god they're saying god we're inviting you into the decision but god never told him to do this god never said go replace judas god said look go wait being deal with power and then go preach the gospel nowhere did he tell him to go pick a 12th disciple but they said it's in the word and it's got to be manifested it's got to happen so we're going to take care of it wasn't there place to do it that he may take a part of this ministry an apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place this was a very spiritual event they had the word they were praying they're asking god into the situation they were giving god the decision it says and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon mathias and he was numbered with the 11 disciples and we never hear a thing about him afterwards he was a tremendous believer he was a tremendous man i believe but we don't hear a single thing about matthias after this why because he wasn't god's choice this was a man trying to build a church of his own ways and of his own thinking and as good as they were i don't think any one of us could fault peter in his approach pick a man of the right caliber has the right experience that's been with us all the way along and then let's pray to god about it and let him make the choice and yet god wasn't in it at all but they would have believed right there that he was right sincere remember sincere but until you've had the experience you don't even know what you're doing right but look at paul's approach because he was the true twelfth disciple he's got a part in setting up the church too but look how he goes about it first corinthians 3 it says who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase amen you can put all the materials there you can put everything there that is going to make the church of god but it says unless god gives the increase nothing's going to happen it's dead the ministry could stand in this pulpit and preach to you all day long but unless god increases it unless god quickens it to your heart it's not going to do you a world of good it says so then neither is he that planteth anything so he's not noteworthy he's not effective and he's not life-giving the planters paul the prophet of the age is not noteworthy effective or life-giving he's no good is what he's saying he says neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase what's he saying you can do everything you want but in the true church of god unless god is behind it it's not going to amount to anything there's no life going to come out of it now he that planteth and he that watereth are one there's no big eyes and little use is what he's saying and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor that's where you take it back to revelation where he says now every man is going to come up and his works are going to be tried and he says and if he's done the right thing it'll stand but if it doesn't then it's going to be destroyed but he says the man's soul will still be saved so he's saying build on the right thing and that means god's got to be a part of it from the very beginning he says for we are laborers together with god so we're working he says but ye the church of god he says you are god's husbandry you are god's building so it's not brother gerald's church it's not brother donnie reagan's church what is it it's god's building and guess what not everybody that's in this building necessarily is in the building of god we believe we want to believe everyone that's here is a true believer but god will determine that but not everyone that comes in says lord lord not everyone that comes in and says evening like fellowship not everyone that says brother jail brother gerald is necessarily going to be a believer but he says what you're god's husbandry god's the one that's taking care of it god has you in the palm of his hand and all we're doing is working with him according to what he tells us to do he says according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another built it there upon but let every man take heed how he buildeth their upon what was that foundation christ it's always christ paul always points to christ i believe the greatest thing that happened to paul was that he realized he was nothing when he got knocked off the horse he realized all of my knowledge all of my training all of my schooling all of my reputation all of it is nothing he says i counted but dong i counted by poop i think it's okay to say that over the pulpit if it's in the scriptures right that's what his count that's what he accounted for that it's it's less than dirt that's what he said everything i bring to the table is less than dirt but he makes something out of whatever i can give him amen and he says it's grace of god that's given to him immense grace from start to finish for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is jesus christ why am i saying this i'm saying it because you can't as an individual come into this and start doing things of your own will and of your own way the new birth when you look at a a baby and it's newly born what does a baby add to itself what does it do to itself how does it make itself all it does is it eats it eats and it sleeps and it eats and it sleeps and as a newborn baby in christ that's the only thing you're going to be able to do is eat and eat and eat and it's going to grow you and it's going to grow and it's going to grow you and guess what if he doesn't feed you then you can't grow you've got to feed on the right things to be a healthy baby and to grow up to be strong and and all these different things get your immune system built up and and whatnot right the only thing as a newborn babe you can do is eat so how are you going to start building things up you're you're newly born in christ and then you want to go out and save the world and do this and do that no there's a quote we're going to get to in a couple of services where brother brahms says that that you can't come out and just all of a sudden be everything for god you've got to give everything but you can't be everything because he's got to grow you up and mature he says it's a process that's going to bring you to a place where god can use you amen the only thing that we can do is foster the right environment the right atmosphere right we can make it easy for god or we can make it hard for god that's based on the things we do the people we hang around with and the food we eat meaning the things that we spend our time on right that's how we're eating that's how we're going to do it we can make it easy for him and we can make it easy for ourselves we can make it hard for him and then it's way harder on herself because it's not hard for god it's all the same to him god doesn't there's no such thing as hard for god everything's easy but for us it's hard amen amen so the question is if you can't make it happen why are you worrying about when it's not happening sometimes we think i ought to be further along sometimes we think why is it taking so long and we sit there and we worry and we wonder and we fret and maybe we look at somebody else and say well she's so much further ahead than me here he's so much further ahead right brother paul i i say that i'm not teasing brother paul i said if i was where brother paul was when i was at his age i'd be further ahead today i do believe this and this is to encourage young people i believe you're further ahead than most of us were at your ages because the word has grown the word has matured the ministry has matured your parents have matured so guess what you're getting to start from a higher starting point than everyone else did and so what you're accelerating quick more quickly i've been talking to ministers and they say the younger ministers are way ahead of where we were at their ages these days why because god is moving things more quickly and he's opened up more so that if you're if you're even halfway open to god and you're even before you get saved he can start to build things and get you ready for things and the minute that he comes into your life it's just like a rocket hits and all of a sudden you can start taking off and moving faster and faster and faster ahead amen i wasn't teasing brother paul i've told him this before to his face and i'm serious i believe that these young people are further ahead than we probably were at their ages that's just that i'll speak for myself okay maybe some of you were more spiritual than me when you were 17 18 20 25 27 these different things but they're further ahead and i look at the very young ministers and guess what they are really moving quickly what sincere hearts listen god's wrapping things up he's wrapping things up so that means that there's something there's 11th hour workers right there there's young babes in christ that have to mature very quickly and i believe he's doing that and it's under the preaching of the word and it's under hearts that are sincere and they're open to him and they're not open to anything else amen they're being raised in homes they're being raised with parents that are keeping those things out hopefully and it guards them from it so that when god comes in there's even less to hold them back by his grace amen young people i think you're moving quickly keep moving and then keep keep feeding on the right things keep praying keep seeking god keep seeking more of god i'm so proud of the young people here i think it's amazing that we have three generations here already it's amazing and it's god's grace to us but keep pressing don't rest on our laurels amen don't rest cause brother john said you were amazing brother paul amen amen brother paul loves it when i mention him over the pulpit listen to this we're talking about paul amen and god had to train paul didn't he had to take him out on the back side of a desert for three three and a half years i think brother brahm says we've said we've read this quote many times but it bears repeating he says god can train a man take him a hundred years for 30 minutes of work god knows how to train what the schools have put in moses 40 years it's taken 40 years to get it out but one time one time in the presence of the anointing one time in the presence of the burning bush he'd know more about god than he had learned in books in the 80 years of his life being raised in a spiritual home by people that knew that he was a deliverer that told him about his future that told him about the promise of god in his life in one minute one moment in the presence of that anointing in the burning bush he knew more about him than everything that he'd heard for 80 years that's how you know you've met god it's when you say i knew nothing until now amen he says god trains his men one then anoints them you know what happens today ministers people i think they're ministers that say i'm anointed where's your training because he's got to train you first and then he'll anoint you for it i've seen it in my own life three and a half years in the backside of the desert what training me before he could reuse me truly effectively i believe trains you then he anoints you gives them experience takes them through the rigid training down through the sands of burning punishment trying and testing and we all said i just want more and more of that no we don't that's what he's doing though not only does he do that to his prophets but he does it to his children so everybody's going to deal with this young and old men and female everybody's got to go through this every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried tested by his word see why when the pinch comes the strong time when it faces death now it could be death of your career it could be death of your marriage it could be death of relationship it could be death of the church you're attending it can be death in a lot of different ways it can be death to your finances it could be death to your health death to the peace that you have the stability you have he says when it faces death are you able to stand there on the word of god and say god said so that settles it that's why he's training you that's why he's putting you through the system you know today we've got athletes that are faster stronger bigger meaner than they've ever been breaking records that if you compare even 50 years ago to what athletes could do in terms of speed and strength and and feats of endurance and whatnot today between technology and training it's not even close it's not even close you got men running a a two minute or a two hour marathon used to be two hours and 45 minutes three hours to run a marathon they'll run it sub two hours now with the right technology and with the right training the speed of our hockey players the power of our baseball players the size of our football players 13 000 calories a day they eat during training camp swimmers swimmers with backs this wide so developed because they've got trainers that'll take them through there so that when the trial comes they can perform like nobody's ever performed before michael phelps more gold medals than any other male swimmer and he does it over four four olympics i think 16 years he's done it and gold gold gold gold gold why tremendous training tremendous technology and guess what if they're doing that in the natural what's god doing in the spiritual amen we've said it before if satan's preparing his bride god's preparing his and guess what his is always going to defeat satan's amen but what is it it's not always an easy road is it if it's easy it's because you've got a break in your training not because the training's over as brother joe so lovingly told me when i moved here he says enjoy your relaxation because there's a that light at the end of the tunnel there that's a truck coming your way and i love how he cares for me so to take away all joy and peace in the moment because something is coming my way and he's right he's right and so trials come and testing's come and god keeps moving and god keeps working why because nothing grows on the top of the mountain it's a great time it's a great place there's lots of peace there's lots of rest not many people on top of the mountain are there but you don't do anything up there and then god what does he do he he gives you a little kick in the hind quarters and he says let's go down let's go through another valley we've got some more training to do right we got to battle again then we'll get you to another victory we'll give you a little breath then we'll keep going up and down and up and down until one day we just go right on out of here amen that'll be the final victory that we go through amen if life's difficult that's probably the best way for you to know that god's with you by that meaning that you're being matured you're being challenged you're having to stretch you're having to trust the word of god more than you ever did before not only that but that you're looking into your life you know sometimes i i sit there and i don't know why i pray it quite frankly because i know what comes with it but you pray to god for things that you know you need and you know when you pray for it what's coming down the road and it's a truck right it's not a light at the end of the tunnel it's a truck moving your way at 60 miles an hour it's like you you know the brother says i've heard many people say don't pray for patience because what's going to come your way is things that try your patience and you're saying i need patience and you're giving me things that take it away no he's training you right so you ask for love you ask for mercy ask for grace guess what you're going to sin people that you don't want to be merciful and people that you don't feel gracious towards that's right right but guess what if you need it and as you're growing into roles as you're going into ministries as you're growing into marriages and these different things as you're growing in your jobs you need more of certain attributes and so you say god i need more look out because he's gonna train you in it he doesn't just drop it into your soul that's not the way he works he trains it into you he gives you an opportunity to grow and mature into what you're asking for amen second corinthians 6 paul says be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion had light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement had the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you what's he doing he's calling out a church and he's separating them and he's saying don't even be associated with anything that's considered evil touch not the unclean thing don't even set your mind towards it don't set your eyes towards it don't give it your time don't give it your energy so that's the easy answer for many things we question our lives you say should i do it or should i not do it is it an unclean thing is it associated with unclean things sometimes the thing you're looking at may not in and of itself be but the association it has the thing it leads to the thing that is most often tied to that is definitely not clean and so you just say you know what i'm not even going to take the one step towards it i'm just going to stay in the middle i'm going to stay in that highway of holiness amen what is he saying don't get tied up with satan's eden and listen whether it's politics whether it's sports whether it's social media and social justice it's all satan's eden and that's why we do any of those things in very very light moderation and then you can know about it that's about it but to be involved with it it's a total waste of your time at satan's trap every time why because it's all unclean it's all unclean he says and we'll be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so this is right after his resurrection he's talking to them in luke 24 49 he says behold i will send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high he's saying separate yourselves and wait paul says separate yourselves christ says separate yourselves terry here don't spread yourselves out stay tight with each other and wait and if we go look in acts 1 we see a bit of a an opening of this and it says paul's talking he says the former treaties have i made out theophilus of all that jesus both began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen so notice he spoke before he was taken up and then he says he continued speaking by the holy ghost to the apostles after he was taken up the voice never left the anointed one never stopped talking but paul says look he kept going and he kept talking even after he left this earth and the apostles are witnesses of that very thing amen amen that's why we don't stop when the prophet left because the holy ghost didn't die and the holy ghost definitely didn't leave so he's got to be speaking to somebody and he's speaking to a five-fold ministry for the ministry of the word but he's speaking to the bride of christ for their day-to-day lives each and every day that they'll stay close to him if you'll open your ears he'll speak to you it's really that simple amen it never stops till we go on a rapture amen and then after that we'll hear him what we'll see him face to face it'll it'll be exactly as it was back in eden he says to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god i often wonder what jesus said in those 40 days because again still they had no clue what was coming their way all this talk of the comforter and and i'm going to come among you and i'm going to be with you and i'm going to manifest myself and you and all these things and he's telling them of things to come but i don't think they ever really grasped it until after the fact because they still hadn't had that foundation set yet he says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem so they came together that's why i said he told them not to separate or he separated them out they came together assembled them together and then he says stay here he says and wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence i find it amazing that they have healed the sick they cast out demons they have a revelation from the father and he says that you still haven't received power because so many for us if we were doing those works we'd say i've definitely got it if we cast out demons if we walked up and we healed a blind person a lame person if we cast out a cancer we'd say whoa i definitely got something and we'd say that's it i'm done i've reached the pinnacle of christianity and he says no no no when you've received power so they didn't have any power then he said not the power that he was looking for them to have what is it that's a trap of satan when he says when you do this and you do that that's when you're a real believer you've got to have a life changed the actions you do doesn't matter it doesn't matter at all we look there in matthew 7. sorry it says it shall receive ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth but we say well if you have those powers to cast out demons and these different things listen god honors faith you can go to a benny hinn meeting and get healed if you've got faith my mother knows people that have had that happen there are real miracles in benny hinn's campaigns is that man a true son of god not based on his doctrine he's not not based on his works he's not he's chasing monies chasing popularity and these things but that doesn't mean that god doesn't honor faith and there's people go in there and he preaches the word and people believe the word and god honors it regardless of what that man looks like matthew 7 says not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven so the will of god is the key to your entire life now he's not going to lose a one of you remember brother braham says he says you know if you're a child of god and you won't obey him what does he do he takes you right but if you're going to stay here then you're going to do the will of god or else and he'll give you opportunity he'll give you opportunity and if you don't do it then he takes you away but the key here is to do the will of the father the key is not to go around doing willy-nilly all the signs and wonders because jesus didn't even do that as much as jesus did he only did certain things at certain times now many will say to me in that day lord lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works they did and they do you can see it today pentecostal churches they still have plenty of miracles to go around they still do it it's still there he says then will i profess to them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now we've said this before there was no internet intimate relationship that word no there means an intimacy like a husband knowing his wife amen he says that was never there i told you what to do and you didn't do it so out you go you can't come in but he never denied that they had the works never denied they did it in his name never denied that they were real but he says i didn't know you and on that basis you can't come in he says therefore whosoever here at these sayings of mine and do with them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock now we're talking about building we're talking about christ building a church the called up ones so listen to this it says and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock now i want you to notice that a house that is built on christ doesn't keep the storms from coming it doesn't keep the bad weather it doesn't keep the trials it doesn't keep your strength from being tested but it means you'll stand that's what matters is will you stand it's not what comes your way it's will you stand despite what comes your way and he says if you build it the way you're supposed to build it it'll take everything that comes its way he says and everyone that heareth these saints of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it what does sand do when water goes over it you ever stand at the beach i know our kids have done it i've done it you take and you build up a sand castle and then when the wave comes in what happens to the sand castle does it fall from the top no it washes out at the bottom doesn't it and as that wave goes it just washes washes washes and it literally will flatten that area after a couple waves and you don't even know that the castle was ever there it just takes it out from the bottom just removes it straight from its foundation because the foundation isn't solid or sure now put it on a block of concrete and let the waves hit against the concrete what does it matter it's going to stay there for as long as you're ever going to be alive right as long as it's built higher than the waves then you're going to be okay why because the concrete doesn't wear away like sand does but santa roads the minute water touches it and just slides away and the whole thing just drops down and becomes shapeless and goes back to its old self amen how many ministries have we seen do this we've seen it what was that what was that brother the great teacher uh ravi zacharias you know a great a great minister when it came to the explanation of the gospel and dealing with the world and their questions and then he what he dies and they find out that all along he's been something that he wasn't supposed to be we've seen it within the message we've seen it with the brothers that left him great ministries that have been there for 20 30 years perhaps and what happened when the storms of life came when doctrines came discrepancies came they said this ain't me they walked away i've seen it in my family i've seen it in my friends they men men and women alike and they fall away both within the message and outside of the message why because they didn't build on something sure they were built on an experience they were built on a second hand a third-hand experience they were built on knowing the doctrines and believing the doctrines were true and they never had a revelation of christ to them amen they didn't seek out their salvation with fear and trembling they assumed born in the message raised in the message i'm going in a rapture it's not going to take us there amen now what do they do they claim to have found the truth you know what's amazing is their truth looks exactly like the worlds and it has the exact same fruits and yet they think they've found the truth and nobody else has it and they've got to share it with everybody else and they have the exact same fruits i've seen it in my own family seen it with my own friends amen all the way down to drugs alcohol infidelity alternate lifestyles homosexuality completely denying the existence of god and they think they found truth they left with a spiritual attitude they left with a religious attitude and now what do they have nothing absolutely nothing they're devoid of god in every measurable way amen they're giving over to themselves that's what's going to happen you know that amen they're not free they're just not seeing anything good and they're bound to a new master and they don't even realize it that's the trap of satan as he says you're free and all he's doing is he's putting on one chain and one manacle after another and pretty soon you look down and you're like that crow and you're tied to a stake and you're going around and around and around you never realized it psalms 127 says accept the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman wakeeth but in vain amen brother braham says who has the answer the watchman that's on the wall has the answer watchman what of the night and the holy spirit is that watchman who is making ready the people and giving warnings from god he has been said as a watchman we see the sick being healed blinded eyes coming open deaf ears unstopped cripples walking the lame leaping like a heart fulfilling the what is it it's the coming of the lord pressing on says the very miracles that were in his ministry were a sign of the coming of the lord pressing down and into the people he says in these things and these warnings and the people continually press right on through to their beer parties until their times of folly and they frolic and they dance and they eat and they drink and they marry and they're given in marriage just as god said it would be no way of stopping them he says then if you notice in this great church age according to revelation 3 at this age now was the one who was given the morning star just before the coming watch how scriptural isaiah was when he said watchmen what of the night he said the morning cometh and the night also there's two things happening there's light coming and there's darkness coming simultaneously that's why you have a time where it's neither light nor dark because it's a blending of events where one is coming into the light and the other one is going all the way into darkness he says what the morning comes but the night comes just before the morning what was it anyone knows that just before the break of day just at the hours of the approaching of the day it turns darker than it ever was it's going to be light for us what's it going to be for the world they won't even see that light they just go on into darkness we're the last light to the last stage and really we're out here we're outside of the age completely and all they can see is a flicker of light out there that's the only light they're going to see in that darkness and then when we go it goes out and all you guys are 144 000 jews that get sealed with the holy ghost and ain't nobody gonna accept them they haven't been accepted today they'll never be accepted then he says oh my friends listen to thus saith the lord if you consider me to be a servant it's just before the break of day that's why this horrible gloom is over the earth it's just before the coming of the lord jesus there's no more hope left in nothing but his coming that's why we're not trying to fix our country that's why we're not trying to fix our economy that's why we're not trying to fix our people that's why we're not trying to fix our politics that's why we're not getting involved in any of it why there's no fixing it right it's dead it's gone the the logs on the skids that ain't coming back brother branham says it's done it's cooked it's burnt there's no more there's there's no more opportunity to fix it they gave it up in what 56 i think it was done it's done you can't bring it back so don't try and bring it back and don't get worked up about it never coming back because it ain't coming back the scripture says so the prophet told us so don't worry about it let it go he says nations are against nations and they fooled through god's laboratory until they got the power to blow one another into atomic ashes and they are wicked and they are unreligious and they're unchrist-like amen what a condemnation for this world and the only motive they have an object is to destroy and they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men what an anointing a destroying spirit and you see it they're destroying themself they're destroying this world everything they do brings destruction because their anointing is destructive how are you going to get along with that how are you going to fix an anointing there's only two and he says the age has a destructive anointing on it he says let me say in the name of the lord jesus the holy spirit is sent as a watchman on the tower and the people cry what of the night how long is this going to go on for how long do we have to deal with it watchmen why is life so difficult why is the devil being so mean to me why am i struggling why am i fighting so much more than i used to he says are you weary of this life are you weary of sin are you weary of funeral processions and sickness and ungodliness on every hand has the night been long and weary what of the night watchmen he said the morning cometh he says see the comfort there's something coming that's going to bring you comfort there's going to be something that brings a light but you got to go through the darkness to get there but you got to trust that watchman that says there's light coming there's comfort coming there's a dawn that's coming that's going to bring you out of this darkness but you're going to have to wait for that the prophet of god says he's talking of a watchman the prophet is saying the holy spirit is warning us showing us signs listen we see signs all around us it wasn't just back then we seen you look at the prophecies of brother branham those seven visions and whatnot what's left nothing nothing's left everything that was to come before the the going away of the bride everything's happened as far as i know every sign the sign of what sodom and gomorrah right not just allowed but protected and endorsed by our governments right that's here as as much as you could ever imagine it but on the flip side we've seen the messiah sign that was the same sign of solomon gomorrah wasn't it you see light and you see darkness question is which one are you drawn to which one are you going with which one are you traveling with because why the light is outside the age now that's right it's been out there and it's what it's talking to the lord shall i hide from abraham what i'm going to do no so he tells him and he does the same thing to us he shows us everything that's happening tells us what's going on so that what we don't get worried about it and we don't get caught up into it the only thing we're trying to do is get our loved ones out that's the only thing that we're concerned with in that group get the loved ones out get the last seat out so we can all get out of here amen so then the light can come in its fullness amen when we read that scripture he says accept the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it he says unless the lord keep it the watchman riseth in vain what's he saying is you build something of your own making the lord didn't build it and the lord can't keep it which means no matter what watchmen you put up there whether it's a secure job whether it's your financial advisor whether it's your your great friends or your alliances with ministries and whatnot none of that is going to keep you through this the only thing that's going to keep you is if the lord builds it and he puts the watchman of the holy spirit into your life so that you can see what's coming down that path and you can get ready for it not because you see it but because you believe the watchman that tells you the watchman always had the greatest eyesight they don't put blind people up there for watchmen they don't put dumb people up there for watchmen they put people up there that can see and recognize what's coming their way and what did he say the holy spirit was going to do show us things to come so he's showing us what's coming not just the bad so we're warned but he's telling us there's good that's coming along with this as well keep going keep fighting stick with your training there's a battle coming stick with your training but there's a victory coming if you'll go through with it amen we don't necessarily see it all but we ask god and he sends us a prophet and he sends us dreams and he sends us scriptures to open our eyes to what's going on around us there's nothing hid i don't believe from the bride these days we see what's going around you see ministers diving in you see the lady diving into it and they'll go and they'll say look at what is happening over here and they'll tie right back to what the prophet said in the quote and you'll see it exactly the way he said it was going to happen what is it there's nothing hidden from us anymore it's an open book which means that god's come down and he's giving us every single thing that we need to get out of here and be aware of what's going on amen it's always darkest he said before the light breaks over the horizon it's not just gloomy it's pitch black it's pitch black there's that contrast and then the light breaks over and you're like wow it really was dark there was a lot of things around me i couldn't see before now but now i can see it in that lighting man he says what hold on morning's coming the comfort's coming the comforter is coming i mean i'm wrapping this up in a little package as we start to close in john 14 i'll take it back to the original scripture he says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may be that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i and you he says what the day the comforter comes the day i come back to you he says that's the day you're gonna know that i was in the father and you're in me and i'm in you that was the promise of how he was going to build the whole church the true church of god he was going to do it by the indwelling presence of himself amen inside a body of believers tabernacling the holy spirit in a way that had never been experienced before now we see that happen in acts chapter 2 it says and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place that means they were in the same place with the same purpose sometimes we're in the same place but with different purposes that's not what does it we've got to come in here with the same purpose when you can get the people in unity nothing can stop them from hearing from god i firmly believe that listen if they could do it at the if god had to come down and destroy babel because he says look these people are so unified that we're not going to be able to stop them that's the language he used if unbelievers combining together and unified in one idea could could cause god to say whoa what ought to happen when believers come in under a unity amen because what we're going to be unified with his mind with his purpose and that's what brings god on the scene is when we're all pulling for the same thing two or three ask in my name if you agree on one thing imagine if we have 20 or 30 agreeing in his name on the exact same thing what would happen in those situations he says and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance 120 people in the top floor of a house sweating it out praying waiting in god from full obedience for ten straight days they'd seen christ ascend they'd gone over his words time and time again i'm sure he'd preached to them for 40 days and i imagine they're sitting there saying this is what he said and do you remember what he said here remember how he put it this way and that way and they're reminding each other of all the things that he said and promised and all the things he told them to do amen i'm sure they wondered what it was going to be like what's this power going to feel like you know what i'll bet they had some praising moments i'll bet they had some some great song services in there as they tried to keep their morale up and and tried to create an atmosphere and maybe they started doing some dancing and singing i don't know maybe they had a great moment and they said this is it because they didn't know what it was they didn't know what it was going to look like maybe they got themselves worked up maybe they got themselves worked down maybe they're like it's been nine days and 23 hours and 59 minutes and nothing has happened maybe they got down i don't know scripture says they stayed in unity though they stayed there with one purpose i'm curious about their morale maybe they wondered if anything was going to happen at all at that point but the scripture says suddenly that means without warning in a moment of time as far as we know based on that there was no build up there was no you know sometimes you're in special services and and things kind of start to move up and that you start to feel a presence and it starts to get heavier and heavier and heavier it's not always [Music] sometimes it builds up to something doesn't it that's not what happened here scripture says suddenly yeah god came out god fulfilled his word suddenly they were filled with the holy ghost amen nine hours 23 minutes 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds of nothing happening and in one second the word went from nothing to everything and they knew what it meant to be filled with power peter knew what it meant to have the revelation of jesus christ peter knew what it meant to have a commission and know what to do with it peter knew what it meant to have the keys of the kingdom and know how to use them in one second he went from nothing he went from a potential child of god to a manifested son of god just like that in one moment praise the lord so many times we're looking we're saying nothing's happening or nothing's happened i prayed and i prayed and prayed like daniel daniel waited three weeks the angel said i heard you on the first day but i ran into some trouble and i had to fight my way to get to you right it's not always quick joshua had to march for six days and not a single stone fell off of jericho then he had to go around seven times on the seventh day and then in one moment those walls fell david had to wait 7 15 years to get a portion of israel as king and then he had to wait another seven years to get the rest of it 22 years for david to become a king and in that entire time all it looked like was he was getting further and further away from the road from the throne and about to lose his life every day for david looked like he was going to die under the promises of god abraham 25 years of getting old 24 years and three months of getting old and getting old and getting old to the point where he and his wife were incapable of having children in any way nothing happening and then in one moment everything changed what was it a visitation from the lord amen now is the day that's what he said now is the time in the time of the month that it's supposed to happen you're gonna conceive and then you're gonna have a baby and guess what sarah was still looking wrinkled and old and abraham had lost all zest there's nothing there but in a moment suddenly everything changed and god fulfilled his work so many times it looks like we're going backwards because nothing's happening i want to encourage you to keep pressing amen because so often it's suddenly nothing's happening nothing's moving nothing's going the way we wanted it to go our faith was high it's ebbing lower and lower body's not changing health's not changing finances aren't changing relationships not changing ministry is not getting any better all you're looking for is one moment in his presence all you're looking for is one visitation all you're looking for is god's timing it's all you're looking for is god's timing and all of this right it's all he's looking for if you'll stand there remember when the crunch comes when the death moment comes remember when death comes your way and tries to kill your faith tries to kill your commitment that's when you've got to be able to stand there and say what what brother branham said his word says it and i believe it that's what they had to do for 10 days of hot sweaty days and nights with 120 people in an upper room stay there until suddenly happened amen amen listen god doesn't just trickle in where do you see in scripture where god gives and dribs and drabs that's never the promise is it god pours in and then he overflows and he tamps down he presses it and he shakes it together until you can't even contain it that's what it looked like on the day of pentecost it wasn't something that they said oh yeah that's about right i can handle this when god touches you you can't handle it it overcomes you it overflows you you have no choice in it because it's all him that's right so many times what he's doing in the waiting is he's getting you out of the equation so that when you know when it happens it was all him and it had nothing to do with you amen he exceeds expectations doesn't he can you say he's exceeded expectations in your life amen so often it was because he did it in his time not in yours and he did it his way not your way you know what i do believe we're going to tap in and i believe we're tapping into the way god does things as we learn and grow and you start to recognize points and you start to recognize junctions and you say this is the start of his move this is the start of his work this is the start of a miracle this is the start of a healing this is the start of a deliverance and you start to catch those moments by faith and i believe that's the holy spirit quickening us to those things but so often the real fruit of it isn't seen till days and months and weeks and years sometimes down the road when you see that coming but you recognize hey something's going on and your faith rises up and says i'll hold on to that until it comes all the way throughout amen if we'd stand together i mean god's timing is perfect scripture says though we tarry wait because eventually he's not going to tarry when he comes he comes quickly amen keep moving keep believing keep pressing keep feeding keep separating amen that's what he wants us to do let's just bow our heads together heavenly father lord we can rest that this is a work of yours lord that we have a portion of your church here today lord and it's not evening like fellowship lord it's not brother gerald's church lord it's not a place built of men no but it's a place that's built by the spirit of god in living vessels lord that have tabernacled you when you called their name and showed them who and what they were and lord we're so thankful for that this evening but lord we don't want to rest on that laurel lord in each and every one of our lives lord but we want to be used lord we want to be fit for service heavenly father lord we want to be assured of who we are but we want to be assured of the call in our life so that we can lord do something for your kingdom heavenly father and lord if we'll rest in

are many here lord that are waiting on you lord they're waiting for healing of their body they're waiting for deliverance and they're in their minds lord they're waiting for strength lord and grace to

themselves in the mirror of the word and see themselves as victorious lord if only they'll surrender to you and let you have your way in their life lord i'm not preaching just to them lord i'm preaching to myself lord that you would lift us up to a higher plane lord that we would draw away from this world that we'd separate from things that hinder us every day lord so that your life could
