good to be back we certainly had a wonderful time out west have perfect weather perfect skiing conditions so it was very nice as I've said before the we take the the gift that the church gives us at Christmas and we apply that towards our vacation so we're so thankful for that and we got to do it because of you so thank you so much for that God bless you each one that contributed to that we got to see brother Doug and sister Beverly while we were out there a couple times so it's always good to see them try and get some fellowship in while we're out there amen it's good to see sister Kimberly

well today God bless them and uh sister Priscilla sure enjoyed that special encourage me for the service for sure amen God bless you for that and it was also Samuel's birthday yesterday 5 years old so happy birthday to him as well amen that he survived this long amen you know sometimes he's uh he's a David but he's going up against a Goliath he's not usually anointed to go up against and so that's why I say I'm glad he survived this long amen God bless you Luke chapter 4 amen I'm loaded for bear this morning and just trusting you'll stay with me amen that God will take this message and use it Luke 4 Jesus reading now from the book of Isaiah remember he comes to Nazareth and he takes up the scroll and he reads these words out of the book of Isaiah the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord in other words there's going to be a day where God says today is the day he says and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all that them that were in the synagogue were fastened upon him and he began to say unto them today's the day he says this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning I want to take a title this morning we're still preaching on the Holy Ghost but I want to take this thought of Give me liberty Give me liberty and I I'll tell you one thing we we got an epidemic of people that are bound today and I'm not just talking about the world I mean we have it everywhere anden life is tough these days situations are tough The Temptations of this world are tough and it's not getting any easier amen our kids are facing things that are 10 times worse than they were when we were kids and it's a 100 times worse than when our parents were kids the things that they face are just so so uh completely enveloping they're everywhere they go everything they look at everything they hear everything they see is just trying to Focus to bind them to the things of this world and the Temptations and the the influences that are there and then we come to the spiritual side of it which is lukewarmness remember for for AIA to see and to overcome they have to overcome lukewarmness right where you say what I have is enough to take me there what I am is enough to get me there what I have is is of God and therefore that is enough but that is not the Overcomer way in leoa they have to recognize there is more and the more is Christ himself not just what he said but it's him it's the person of Christ himself and so we have to go beyond just knowing the truth and we have to come to receiving the truth and let that Truth live through us and we see in Revelations 3 that requires one thing and that is zealous repentance amen zealous repentance not just not just a dry-eyed confession not just a oh yes that's me but a life that is changed by our repentance if I could put it that way repentance doesn't mean to say I'm sorry repentance means to go the way that you weren't going before it's to change your way of life life amen and so that our Humanity our flesh doesn't like to repent because that means that we've done something wrong or we haven't done something completely right that we've got some work to do we've got changing to do we've got a higher Place amen it requires us to admit that we're not living as high as we're talking that's what that's what that zealous repentance does to us amen but the scripture says our nature our spirit in this flesh is that enity with God it does not get along with God therefore it will not get along with his word it will not get along with the people of God and so it has to be brought into subjection and just because we have the Holy Spirit doesn't mean we don't have our flesh amen it doesn't mean we're not in a battle we're not in a fight the Holy Spirit does not take away our flesh but rather the holy spirit is given to bring this flesh into subjection amen and it's a battle every day but it's to bring this flesh into subjection to bring our family traits to bring our genetics to bring our our habits our besetting sins to take those and bring them under subjection to the word of God to help us overcome those things so that we can walk out and testify of the power of God inside of our Lives amen but we don't have to be forced we don't have to be forced so many times it's unfortunate that God has to put us into a corner but we don't have to be forced we can choose to step into what he has for us we can choose to come to a place of change we can choose to come to a place of repentance of humility but if we don't then God will do what that Mama Eagle does is when it's time for the chick for the little eaglet chicks to fly she starts to take the soft things out of the nest she starts to make life uncomfortable and if there's one thing I've learned as a Believer it's that you cannot grow unless you're uncomfortable it's the same way in the natural it's the same way in the spiritual you have to be pushed you have to be pressed you have to be put into tough circumstances in order for there to be growth in order for there to be changed amen and God's wanting us to move from that God's wanting us to move from what we are are to what he has for us from what we are to what he said we were going to be to move from the image of Lanny and Sandy klet into the image of Jesus Christ my father that's what he's trying to do and I was so appreciative of that song sister Priscilla this morning as we speak on this thought of Give me liberty because we look at what Jesus said in John 8 and it says Jesus answered them and he said verily very verily I say unto you whoever commits sin is the servant of sin that word servant there is not servant it's slave whoever whoever commits sin is the slave of sin and the servant the slave abides not in the house forever but the son abides forever the Amplified says here that the slave is not a permanent member of the household they come in and they go out but the son is a permanent member of the household he says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed you'll really be free you'll be more free than you ever thought you could be free it'll be a real Freedom it won't be a temporary thing but I want you to notice the language Jesus is using here he says if you commit sin you are a slave of sin and so often people get mixed up this idea of sin because they say it's drinking and it's fornicating and it's this and it's that and the other thing no that is the attribute of sin but sin is unbelief it's to disbelieve the word of God so if Jesus is saying if you disbelieve the word if you take something above the word of God you're a slave and to stay there means you'll stay a slave if you'll dis if you you'll you'll disbelieve the word of God you cannot come into your position as a son or a daughter of God and he says if you don't believe the word you don't get to stay in the house all the time and we'll find out why that is as we come to the end of this service you come in and out but you're not settled let me tell you church if the only time we get to see God is when we come to church we're under a slave mentality this morning if the only time we can feel the presence of God is when we're in church we're under a slave mentality because we are not in his presence we're coming in and we're going out we're coming in and we're going out and that's not the nature of a child of God that's the nature of a slave that's the nature of somebody that doesn't get to stay there but he says if he makes you free you'll be free indeed if he gives you a revelation that you're not a slave that you are a son that you are a daughter he says that's the thing that's going to set you free you'll notice here your intended position is not a Slave it's not to be a servant in this case your intended position is to be a child of God sitting in the presence of the father all the time that's your intended position amen but remember what God does is he sends his Spirit to us and we cry out Abba Father and we realize who we are in relation to him and that cry draws us into his presence and it starts a work in our life to change what is on the outside to match what is on the inside cuz we always were a son we always were a daughter but now we realize it and now the spirit of God goes to work by the washing of the water of the word and it takes us out of the slavery of this flesh out of the slavery of habits out of the slavery of religion out of the slavery of tradition out of the slavery of our emotions uh whatever we might have this morning and it takes us into the perfect Liberty of the Sons and Daughters of God that's what he sent the holy spirit for and if we look in the scriptures so many times that that slaves they could not help that they were slaves to start we sang that song here that he's in the house we were like that little girl dead in all our sins we are born in slavery but it's whether we stay in slavery that is the choice when you look at the the children of Israel they could they could fall into a time of slavery they could lose their inheritance for a time but there came a day there came a year on the day of Jubilee where they would blow the trumpet and if they heard that trumpet and they recognized what it meant then they got to go free but if they recognized what it didn't recognize what it meant nothing changed but here's the thing they could recognize what it meant and not take advantage of it and they would choose to stay a slave for the rest of their life and so they take them to the to the doorpost and they take an all and they' they'd wrap a the all through their ear and they put a a ring there and that ring would bind them for the rest of their life they were a slave Now by choice not by circumstance and so often we go through trials and circumstances and and hard times and situations we're not meant to be bound by those we're not meant to be bound by them but we can choose to be bound by those things and I want to start on this idea of how does somebody become a slave yes we're born in sin yes we we come and this flesh binds us and we're a slave to that but we're talking now to Believers because we can come into a place where we're bound up in something and yet we are a child of God and we ought not to be but we are because something has held Us in in some form of bondage amen and we we look at that last Church age in leoda that's where we are today we're in leoda we're in the last Church age and it's the worst of all the ages in Revelation 3 God has nothing good to say about the lean Church age the only bright spot there is that there is an overcomer and the Overcomer is those that are what willing to let Christ come into their lives he's outside of the church remember they're worshiping a Christ of their own imagination of their own making they put the word out and with that word went the Living Word they put out the truth of this word of God and they put it out and so Christ is now on the outside and he's knocking on individual lives because he's trying to find the Overcomers and there's going to be a people that let him into their lives amen but we know that leod deia means people's rights and you'll find today that a slave mentality is bound up so often in your right to hold on to certain things you only need to listen to the news once or twice and you can see that people today are worshiping their feelings they're worshiping their circumstances they're worshiping their genetics they're worshiping whatever they are saddled with and they don't want to be made uncomfortable by those things and so they'd rather stay the way they are and have everyone come around them and Pat them on the back and coddle them where they are rather than come up into the Liberty that's there if you can admit where you are and that there's a way out of those things and what you see today is the result of people that are not held accountable that are not challenged that are not offered the truth that are not held uh uh subject to the facts that are before us and so now you have a place where people can't even recognize or accept truth anymore because they're so used to people saying that whatever you think is right whatever you feel is right whatever you want is right and it's not right the truth is absolute and what we have is a b bunch of absolutes which doesn't make sense because they're all contradiction themselves and so what we've got today is we've got a victim mentality which is a slave mentality of people that don't want to be held accountable to the truth and because of that they do not change and because of that they spiral lower and lower and lower and they never get to a place where they can move on from these things and so we've got people that are hearing what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear Paul told Timothy that's what was going to happen he says in second Timothy he's speaking now to Timothy he says Timothy preach the word be in instant in season now that's the easiest time to preach church is when it's in season cuz that means the people are willing and ready to hear you but then he says Timothy now preach it out of season too so when people don't want to hear what you have to say when people aren't willing to hear what you say he says Timothy you've got to say it anyway because if you don't say it they don't have an opportunity to get out of where they are we've got to be able to speak the truth in love even if nobody wants to hear it he says what's that going to look like it's going to be reproving rebuking exhorting with all long suffering and Doctrine patient if they don't take it the first time give it to them the second time stick with it don't let them walk away because they don't accept it the first time stick with it be patient he says for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they want somebody to scratch their lustful itch and it's to tell them what they want to believe what they want to happen how they want life to be rather than the way God wants them to be he says and they shall turn away their ears from the truth that's a choice that's a choice they shall turn their ears away that's a choice and it says and they shall be turned unto fables there's the result you reject the truth you'll believe a lie you'll get to the place where you'll you'll say a lie to yourself and you'll believe your own lie that's how far this goes where are we at today we are at a place where people will believe fables rather than the truth because it's more convenient to believe the lie than to accept the truth you can see it in media you can see it in government you can see it in religion you can see it in business all these things that you have a people that can't hear the truth because it's too uncomfortable and it puts them in the spotlight that they're not where they ought to be what happens when people get uncomfortable with the truth they turn it away and what do they do they find like-minded people that think the way they do that feel the way they do that live the way they do and they'll create a band they'll create a denomination is what they'll do whether it's religious or not it doesn't matter it's religious it's not the word but it's religious and it can be bounded around the lifestyle you live the marriage you have the things you do the things you don't do whatever it is and they'll bind themselves by emotion they'll bind themselves by having a large number of people and they'll get there and they'll beat down anybody that doesn't do it the way they say that's the way we see things today isn't it you see these alternative Lifestyles that they're trying to cram down everybody's throat you got 5% of the population trying to control 95% of the population with emotion w w with with all of this rhetoric with all of these this harsh attitude judging people by the word not even knowing what the word says that's what we have today you say brother John we're not in that group but we can get in that group let me tell you it's it's an amazing thing if you ever go to a youth camp the bad kids always find the bad kids the ones that are smoking pot always find the ones that are smoking pot the ones that are listening to rock music on the side always find the ones that are listening to rock music on the side it happens without without fail you go ask any preacher that's been to a youth camp they'll say you want to find one bad kid just look for the one you know and the rest of them will be around them they just find each other and they they they they they they just they're drawn to each other but that's the way it ought to be for a Believer when it comes to the truth but what can happen is we can get into situations where we get burned we get hurt we have a certain thing that we do or we don't do and we can link up with people on the basis of that rather than on the basis of the word of God and you can end up now bound up in your emotions because somebody else's been hurt the same way you do and what are you doing you're codling each other in your emotion rather than bringing each other into the truth of the word of God absolutely we can do it amen what we can we can come to a place where we protect areas we don't want to change and how do we protect it we find a like-minded person to support us in that area where we don't want to change cuz they don't want to change either and so we end upor supporting each other but let me start right there we don't want to change even though we know we ought to even though we know we ought to we don't want to do it because we see the work that's ahead we see the pain that's ahead we see the truth that's ahead we see The Humbling that's ahead we see the repentance that's up ahead we see the hard conversations that are up ahead and we say no I'd rather stay here with my truth with my feelings with my hurt with whatever it might be and what do we do we stay in the image that we're born in rather than the image that Christ has for us instead of saying I need help I need Deliverance I need growth I need change we say I just want to stay the way I am these things would require us to repent because we've been bound and we're bound Now by choice not by circumstance we moved beyond the circumstance the circumstance has moved on Beyond us and we're still Bound by what happened in those things and and that slave mentality that victim mentality it always puts the blame on somebody else a victim puts the blame on somebody else and a slave puts the blame on the circumstances because you say I can't help but I'm a slave you look at these poor poor people that were were captured and and and sold into slavery they couldn't help that but how they acted in their slavery they could act they they could they could act they they could could hold themselves accountable for and there comes a time where you've got to make a choice remember brother BR would tell that story about that man that went to a slave to a plantation and he was looking at all the slaves and he says I only want to buy one slave he says it's that guy over there and the guy says you can't have him he says why he says he's my best worker he says but why is he so good he says I've been watching him the whole time what's what's so different about him he says back home he's a prince he's the son of a king and he didn't let his circumstances change the way that he acted he was a prince and he acted like a Prince no matter where he was because he knew it was a reflection of where he came from and what his position was in all of these things but that slave mentality says I can act the way I want to because I'm put in circumstances that I couldn't control and listen Church we're all born into circumstances we can't control I can't control the desires and the urges that I was born with and neither can you I can't control the actions and the reactions the way this Body Works any more than you can but we can bow down to those things because we don't go to God and say God I need a change God I want the promise change I want the promise change not just I want to change but I want the promise change that you give me a new spirit that you give me a new heart that you would change the way that I live my life you want to know who's a slave they're pointing at the circumstance or they're pointing at the other person rather than at what the word of God says is a available for them in their situation in their life and in their body and these different things it started in the very beginning you remember when Adam said the woman that thou gave me what did Adam say he says God you gave me a flawed wife any brothers here have a flawed wife I do you do too me and Joe have flawed wives why CU they're born in sin and shaped in iniquity same as the same as the how many wives have flaw husbands my wife has one well there you go what's good for the goose is good for the gander isn't it but we've got to we've got to be able to recognize that we're in a battle we're in a fight and just cuz we're born that way doesn't mean we've got to stay that way listen look look at our elders here I now I didn't know brother Mark when he looked like a hippie but guess what he doesn't look like a hippie today brother Bob I heard was the worst of the worst brother Gerald was always a saint he was a he was a man born into a particular role but let me tell you I can see the smiles on the faces here sister sister Brenda is is holding in a giggle because she knows the way she used to be she knows the way brother Bob used to be you know what you were but guess what something changed you something set you free listen you came from a drunkard you came from a drunker brother Mark and brother Bob I don't see any drunks here today drunk on the word maybe but you say I've got a temper I've got a this I've got a that I'm born with it Church we're all born broken we're all born in in sin we're all born with flaws and issues but you got proof today that the the Holy Ghost can take those things out of your life it may be in You by genetics hardcoded into your life and that will not stop the power of the holy spirit in your life hallelujah we're preaching on Give me liberty this morning we can dwell on those things that we've gotten from our dad from our mom from our grandparents from a Ministry from a friend from a bad situation from a circumstance sense and we say it's built into me now I can't get rid of it I'm here to tell you this morning there's liberty there is Liberty from whatever you're dealing with this morning but you got to be able to lay it down you got to be able to say I don't want it anymore and Lord I'm holding you at your promise for it this morning we can't help what happens in this life we can't help the things that that that we're put into amen where we can live by the word every single day and still experience hardships and failures and faults and flaws and hurts and offenses we can't help so many of those things some we can but many we can't amen Jesus said we'd be rejected we'd be abused we'd be persecuted we'd be kicked out we'd be ill spoken of we'd be beaten up and we have been at different times and in different ways people can say things that leave us scarred for life people can do things that leave us scared for life and what happens is it causes us to protect those areas and wrap things up and build a shell around those things it may happen as a child it may happen as a young person happen when you're married whatever it is we get damaged we get hurt and so what do we do we build this wall we build a fortress around these things and we become a slave to that event a slave to that word a slave to that situation a slave to that influence and we say never again never again guess what that's not going to stop it from happening again it doesn't I can tell you this morning it's not amen and so then we say because of that Fortress we say now I'm no longer responsible for what happens they did this they did that they didn't do this they didn't do that they said this they said that and we get the shell in our lives and Lead deia feeds that mentality Lea feeds that mentality because a slave believes they have no part in getting where they are and therefore they're not responsible for what happens from that point on let me tell you if you're a child of God you have an opportunity to move past those things amen slaves rest on the fact that it's out of my hands it's beyond my control and therefore I'm not responsible for anything we have so many people in the scripture that could have been slaves to their circumstances and yet they weren't they had all sorts of reasons not to change they were slaves but they didn't act like slaves amen they may have physically literally been slaves but they didn't let those circumstances dictate the way that they acted you look at somebody like Rahab rahab's a prostitute used and abused by men all her life who knows how she got there she's there and she could say my entire life I've been abandoned by God I've got nothing she could be bitter she could be hurt she could have a bad attitude she could be cranky all the time and we'd say Rahab you've got good reason to do that but what happened Church she saw Liberty in one moment and she said I'll take it and what happened when she took that Liberty is God buried every portion of her past and she walked away and she married a captain a general in the army of Israel and she came into the the the the bloodline of Jesus Christ because she said I'll take Liberty when it comes my way rather than sit here and say this is God's fault look at the woman at the well married five times living common law with a man keeps making the same bad decision over and over and over again until now she's made an even worse one she couldn't get the victory she believed the word but she couldn't get the Victory and she was left with more questions and answers she she's been persecuted she's been an outcast she's got to walk up to the to the well in the middle of the day when the sun's at its hottest every single day everybody can look at her walking that lonely trip up to that well and say there goes a fallen woman you talk about a slave but one day Liberty came her way and instead of backing away instead of wrapping that shell tighter around her what did she do she opened up to it and she got set free she went on to get the Holy Ghost I believe when when when they came down to Samaria the book of Acts came down Philip was down there preaching and then Paul or sorry Peter and John came down and they prayed for them and they got the Holy Ghost I believe she went all that way because she opened up and she let the word do a work in her that she'd been trying to do all of her life and what it did was it satisfied the things You' been trying to satisfy all that time you look at her you say poor thing she's had a rough life I don't blame her church I don't blame us for the way we act sometimes but what I say is when God gives us an opportunity to have Liberty that's where we got to take some responsibility amen we're allowed to mourn we're allowed to be hurt we're allowed to be offended we're just not allowed to stay there amen look at Joseph we spent a fair bit of time talking about him last Serv a prophet of God chosen ordained favored of God with gifts is sold into slavery by his own family goes to work for the the captain of the Guard falsely accused assaulting assaulting a woman goes to prison has done nothing wrong and yet everything has gone wrong he's a literal slave and then he's a slave prisoner on top of it everything has come crumbling around them it went from bad to worse to worser nothing's going well for Joseph amen he's a from a son to a slave to a prisoner and slave his circumstance just get getting worse and worse and worse through no fault of his own and yet Joseph never had a slave mentality Joseph had a son of God mentality he wasn't Bound by circumstances he was held by the promise of God in his life David a Shepherd boy a a happy Shepherd boy happy to do what he was doing gets called by God is brought out by the prophet Samuel anointed to be king the spirit of God comes upon him he has a changed life and then he has to run for his life for the next 15 years and he's he's he's he's hounded hounded constantly everything he does is for the king's good he's loyal to the king he goes in and he sings songs and gets a spear thrown at him twice Saul wants his life even though David has done nothing but be loyal to the king and for 15 years David is always scrambling he's just one step ahead of death on a constant basis does that change David oh David has his down moments go read the Psalms he has his down moments but David has his his up moments too he doesn't stay there he doesn't stay in those places church you can look at your life this morning look at it this morning by all means and say where have I been dragged down where have I been bound up where have people hurt me where have circumstances bound me where am I holding on to something that I should be passed by now and say where's the promise of the word versus the promise of lead to seea that it's okay to hold on to these things we can review every situation and we can have every reason laid out for where we are where we are today for how we are we can pinpoint the person we can pinpoint the cause the time the place the issue the words the feelings that came with it we can justify our actions we can justify our reactions we can justify the fortifications we built up around those things in our lives and we can pinpoint it perfectly what caused it and let me tell you knowing the cause Won't Set You Free knowing who to blame Won't Set You Free I've heard too many people talk about let's dig in and find out the cause the cause isn't enough the cause doesn't set you free it might give you an understanding but it doesn't give you a freedom it doesn't give you Liberty amen we're all broken we're all in sinful flesh as I said Paul said in this flesh dwells no good thing it's hard to be a human it's a tough life amen and so knowing these things won't change a single thing but when we come to those places and we start to list out why we are where we are and how we can't move forward we're ducking our Liberty because it's easier to claim the reason the excuse because it's on somebody else you know what you look at something like forgiveness see too often we're waiting for that person to come and forgive to to say I'm sorry listen the only person that's Bound by unforgiveness is me if I can't forgive you I'm bound you may be running out there free as a bird you don't know that you've done anything wrong to me that lack of forgiveness binds me it doesn't bind you and so we can sit here waiting for the other person to make the move and we'll stay there the rest of our life we don't know what we don't know amen but we take these circumstances and we put it above the power of the word of God we put it above the power of the Holy Spirit and we let it build up a fortress inside of our life and what are we saying we're saying I'm a slave rather than I'm a son or a daughter of God we can sit here all day long and talk about the reasons and the excuses and the people and the situations and all these things and we end up being worshippers of the situation rather than the god that told us he can set us free from those things we're not here to talk about reasons you will never find anywhere anywhere where God says your reasons are good enough nowhere you'll never find him say that what you'll find him say my grace is sufficient for thee Paul right I've never seen the righteous forsaken by his stripes we are healed he will keep him in perfect peace whose heart is stayed on thee whose mind is stayed on thee you'll see the promise you'll never see God look at the excuse or the reason but what he'll point you to is the Liberty that he offers from those things amen other what do we do we end up with this why me attitude and why me becomes wiy and all of a sudden now we're wrapped up in an eore attitude of why me why me why me and Satan will give us every reason and every excuse to stay there it's so easy to just Retreat into the circumstance to retreat into the hurt Retreat into the pain Retreat into the reason rather than look for the way out because too many people are there to coddle you in the reasons rather than lead you out but the holy spirit's here to lead us out that's what the word's supposed to do amen it's so easy to get caught up in where we are rather than where he told us we could be in those things remember what Jesus said if you're a slave you're bound in unbelief but I want to set you free I want to set you free from what's making you come in and go out and I want you to come in and stay be in my presence I want to make you a son and a daughter I want to make you truly free but let me start with this you can only be a son if you are a son you can only be a daughter if you are a daughter when we look at this change here from slavery from slave into sun this is not a changing it's a changing of of who you recognize you are but you always were a son you always were a daughter of God Amen I didn't become a klette when I started acting like a klet I always was a klet and it's the same thing with the child of God remember what brother Bram says he says you can be a child of God a long time and not know it but when you know it that's the working of the holy spirit in your life and it's to bring you out of who you are into what you always were it's to take you past your natural birth into your origin in Christ in the mind of God when your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen but but God's trying to get us to realize who we are who we are and what comes with realizing who we are is is the inheritance of a son and a daughter of God see we we we have this idea that we've got to be perfect to come to God we've got to be perfect we got to have the perfect marriage we got to have dressed perfectly we got to have perfect Doctrine we've got to have perfect kids go to a perfect Church perfect job perfect time management no besetting sins and that couldn't be further from the truth Jesus said you're going to start out as a slave no matter who you are you're going to be a Slave and you're going to be brought into a place where you can realize that you're a son listen to what Paul said to the Corinthians he says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God he says and such were some of you listen when they came to Corinth they did not come and find Perfect People they came and they found really really nasty perverted people that's who Paul was preaching to perverts sickos weirdos drunks pars sleeping around he says but such were some of you but ye are washed ye are Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of the god Paul had to talk to the Corinthians so many times we've talked about this in the past he had to rebuke them constantly to get them to come into the liberty of Christ but they were changed they didn't stay in their original condition but they came to Christ completely flawed and he turned them into perfect Sons and Daughters of God we don't have to come perfect we have to come willing to be changed that's what it's about the a life surrendered to Christ is all that he requires he will do the work as brother Garfield preached the other night Perfection is God's work not my work or your work he's the one that's going to do that job that idea of change means we aren't what we ought to be and we've got to be able to recognize I need to change because I'm not what I am supposed to be it's okay to say I'm not what I'm supposed to be as long as you don't hold on to what you are right now that's all it's okay in fact I encourage us be honest this morning this is where I am but Lord this is what you said I'm supposed to be so I'm going to step into the Liberty that you offer by the power of the Holy Spirit and I'm going to let you do a work in my life you know I heard a I think it was brother codre dig say this I don't know if it was on the the service we listened to on Wednesday night or a different what I heard him say he said at some point we have to stop being a Corinthian and start being an Ephesian we've got to we've got to come where we've we we're not holding on to things where we're not holding on to the old life where we're not holding on to the old hurts where were letting go completely of what we were so we can come into the liberty of Christ because in Ephesian in Ephesus they were a church it was Paul's home church if you remember and that home Church they had seen what the power of God could do and they'd let it do a work in their life and now they were moving into adoption they're moving into placing because they moved past the old life and they were now a completely new creature in Christ and he was forming them and shaping them into his body into his bride you know I've dealt with a lot of personal issues in my life emotion lack of emotion bottling things up letting past experiences hold on to me and I've said this before one day I realized if I stick with this route it'll destroy my marriage it'll destroy my Ministry it'll destroy my family it'll destroy my kids and what did I have to do I had to go to God and say God I want to change that's simple and what did he do he changed me and he's continuing to change me the work ain't done yet the work's not done yet but he's continuing to change because I have a desire by the Holy Spirit In Me by the hearing and preaching and reading of the word that there is more for me than I have today and so there's a change spirit inside of me there's something inside me that's drawing me further even when it's uncomfortable even when it's humbling even when it requires me to lay down my Justified responses to situations and people because I want what he has rather than hold on to what I have what I see is way better than where I'm living today as good as it might be today he's trying to get us listen we might be at bad he's trying to get us to good we might be at good to get us to better we might be at better he's trying to get us to best best is resurrection and Rapture Church we've all got to get to best but wherever you are today say Lord I want to be moved on from there to the to the next step cuz it's a process it's a little bit by little bit from glory to glory as we'll read a little bit later all I can do is read that scripture and say Lord let that be my testimony every week I used to be such was I but I've been washed I've been Sanctified I've been Justified Church don't think that you're going to get to a certain point and he's not continuing to do this sanctification is an ongoing work remember what Jesus said to the disciples he said he said you know he says you're clean but not every bit every day you walk through this world you get a little bit dirty he says and you need to be washed every day that's what sanctification is it's washing it's keeping you clean every day we see things we hear things we look at things we do things we say things we think things that are not fit and we need a cleansing listen don't think that a preacher doesn't have the same issues you do we are all born in the same flesh the only difference between me and you is I'm called to preach and you're not that's it we all deal with the exact same things day by day so there's a sanctification that's going on and as I've said before the further you go in life the more he tightens the reins I find because as he gets the major things out now he starts to work on the minor things and it may not be that I don't have to worry about the the the big issues but now it's attitudes now it's the thoughts now it's the things we let to go on in our minds that he's dealing with what's he doing he's tearing out the strongholds so that there can be Liberty there can be Liberty inside of us he's he's is is very desirous to go into those areas that are so built up you know you know what scar tissue is the deeper you've been wounded the heavier the scar tissue and scar tissue is harder and stronger and rougher than the flesh that was there originally but what he's wanting to do is he's wanting to go out and dig out that scar flesh and put on the bomb of Gilead so that you can have that softness again that you had in the beginning not toughened up by life but softened up by the holy spirit cuz remember our original heart was hard and he's got to soften that up he gives us a new one he softens it up that's what he's trying to do in our lives I'm here to tell you today your excuses won't free you your reasons won't free you what'll free you is to let him put you into Liberty that's the only way it's going to do God doesn't start with perfect people God starts with nobody's with nothings with flawed failed people and he turns them he reveals them as Sons and Daughters of God Paul will continue in 1 Corinthians he says for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things that word base it means cowards lowborn nobodies and basing of the world and things which are despised contempt everyone looks down on these people hath God chosen yay and things which are not the nobody's to bring to not the things that are we see that God's not resting on our natural abilities on our natural cleanliness on our good genetics or our intelligence or gifts or these things rather God has chosen us despite those things amen that the world those things that the world thinks are so essential God says watch what I can do with a nobody amen God has chosen broken failed weak people for his open show of Victory the church is his victory and it's a bunch of nobody's what is that open show of Victory Church it's taking what appeared to be a slave and revealing it as a son and a daughter of God that's God's open show of Victory it's taking a nobody and showing the world what God can do with a nobody that's his open show of Victory that's what David that's why it's such an amazing story is God took a little Shepherd boy and he destroyed the greatest champion that the world could offer with a tiny little weapon that's what God does little nobodies knocking down Giants amen listen our weaknesses are not not an excuse genetic traits are not an excuse family traditions are not an excuse Church Traditions are not an excuse hurts and pains and offenses are not an excuse listen yes they have an effect but watch what Paul's Paul says Paul would say in the book of Hebrews remember in the in the faith chapter Hebrews 11 I think it says out of weakness they were made strong these are the heroes of the Faith Church and he says out of weakness we're made strong in other words they weren't originally known for what they were later known for they weren't known as Brave when they started they were known with bra as Brave when he finished with them they weren't known for courage or wisdom or these things but God took those nobodies and he put his spirit inside of them and he did something with them that they could never do in of themselves listen Gideon was the lowest of the low remember his family was in the lowest tribe and his family was the lowest family in the lowest tribe and he was the lowest person in the lowest Tri family in the lowest tribe of all of Israel Gideon was the guy at the bottom there was nobody lower than Gideon he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a judge he wasn't even courageous he was hiding out in the wine press threshing wheat trying to get some food for his family but God took that little coward and he destroyed I think 120,000 Soldiers with him and his 299 or 300 men that's what God does he takes no buies they didn't they didn't start out strong they became strong out of their weakness he didn't start them in perfect circumstances he started them in hard circumstances he started them in brutal circumstances he started them as outcasts he started them under persecution and out of that put his Spirit on them to produce Liberty they didn't have what they needed his Spirit put in them what they needed to have and it did the work that they could never do amen those things never sto God for a moment Gideon's uh cowardice never stopped God we were talking about this in the house the other day Gideon says Okay God and I don't remember the order so forgive me God when the duw comes in the morning I want the the fleece to be dry but I want the ground to be wet that happens that's a miracle church that's not the way fleece works then then he says well Lord just to make sure this morning the next morning I want the fleece to be wet but the ground to be dry God didn't say come on Gideon I gave you one Miracle do you need two really and even after that remember Gideon he was he was unsure of himself so God says listen go down into the into the camp and two people that don't know who Gideon are are sitting there and one of them tells a dream and the other one interprets it God gives dreams and interpretations to two heathens that identifies Gideon as the one that's going to destroy the Army listen church God will get you there God will get you there how Supernatural was that Gideon had sign after sign and wonder after wonder and finally he got to the place where he could do what God told him to do and God brought the Victory and Gideon got all the credit that's Liberty not looking at the circumstances not looking at oursel that's the thing that holds us back so many times is either looking at the other person or looking at oursel and saying I don't got what it takes that's not what he's trying to do he's trying to get us to see him through his word I've read this quote before he says we try to make our weaknesses excuses we want to tell how big we are how great we are he says I think that's one of the things that God gave me this text for was to get that out of our minds see there are little things we do these little things we ought not to do our cracks and our foundations our our temper our habits our sour spots our trigger points he says and that's what we come to church for is to find find out where our faults are why so we can be set free and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get much out of coming to church why because we're coming to hear what we want to hear that makes us feel good rather than what make us good listen we're not going to feel good a lot in this Christian walk It's A Hard Road It's A Hard Road but you want to have rest you want to have assurance that what you're doing and where you are is the right place he says if we come to sorry he says we must come in to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong that's where the Liberty is is not what I am it's what he is it's not what I bring to the table it's what he's already brought to the table he says that's the reason why he chooses us because we're in that condition listen if you can't do it then he doesn't have to worry about you trying to do it that's what God can use as somebody that knows they can't do it he says now that sounds strange but just a few minutes we'll get to the reason of it if God been willing we found out just as we've been reading that weaknesses and rejections that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world are God's Heroes that conquer up in the front line it takes those who feel themselves unworthy see now here's the thing he's not wanting you to feel unworthy about who you are he's wanting you to recognize that your strength is not going to get you through that your gifts aren't going to get you through your intelligence your money your health whatever it might be your knowledge your understanding that's not what's going to get you through what's going to get you through is Christ The Living Word remember what Jesus said in John 8 the servant the slave is bound by unbelief he's not allowed to stay in the father's house all the time he says you if you let God set you free that's when you can live as a son is meant to live as a daughter of God is meant to live when he sets you free so often the slavery that we're in is our own idea that we can do it ourselves and what causes us to go out is when we fail but he say no if you'll stay with me then I'll get the job done Paul said this in Galatians 4 he says and when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law we might receive the adoption of sons the placing of sons and because you are Sons remember what we said you always were a child of God you don't become one the outside is shown to be what it is and that's not always obvious but inside you are always a son or daughter of God and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant see you used to be a servant you used to be a slave but when you receive his Spirit now you're no longer a slave you are a son you are a daughter of God he says and if you are a son then you are an heir of God through Christ Paul comes along he says because you're a son because you're a child of God God sends his holy spirit your way and it makes you realize you don't have to be a slave anymore you don't have to be the way you used to be you're not a servant you're a Son of God you're a child of God and with that comes an inheritance with that comes something you didn't know you have before amen you don't have to stay where you are you don't have to stay where you used to be you can now step forward into that true Liberty that's the inheritance that we have yes we have healing in these things yes we have a a Blessed Assurance we have rest and peace but our true Liberty is that we don't have to live the way we used to live listen healing comes and goes well you get healed today you'll be sick tomorrow you'll be sick next month you'll be sick next year healing in this life is temporary but Liberty in Christ is eternal it lasts once you get it you have it for the rest of your life amen listen to this again A Familiar quote I've read it before he says he chose us in love before the foundation of the world he says now watch having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will he says isn't that wonderful he loved you he loved you before there was a world he knew knew your nature he knew your weaknesses he knew your habits he knew all about you what you were going to be and then when he looked all over the great universe as it was he said these words I Choose You I Choose You Lord I've got a temper that can fight a buz saww I Choose You Lord I've got seems like everything in my body is lost I Choose You you Lord it seems like I can't trust anybody I choose you that's the only words that matter I choose you and when he did that before there was ever a speck of light then you're Eternal with God now notice he did not choose us to stay in the weakness in the habits and in the nature that's why he said in Jer or Ezekiel he says I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll place my spirit within you he chose you while you had those but he did not choose you to stay in those conditions that's a slave condition the sunship the daughter ship that's what he wants you to come into amen church if those things won't stop God if those things didn't stop God why should they stop me or you why should they stop me or you why should we have those as an excuse if they weren't an excuse for God if God looked beyond those things then why can't we look Beyond those things if they didn't hold God back then why should they hold us back the Liberty I have this morning is that God chose me not that I chose him scripture says no man can come to the father except God draws him he chose me that's my Liberty because God doesn't make mistakes God doesn't choose and then let go God doesn't start and then not finish God makes no mistakes and so in choosing me he chose perfection in choosing you he chose Perfection cuz that's what God is God is perfection we said earlier that a slave chooses to stay a slave based on their circumstances what others have done to them but as we turn the page a son or daughter of God now they choose that they don't have to stay where they are they choose Liberty listen God's not going to force you you're going to make a choice Liberty or to stay bound guess what there are people that have been bound for 20 30 40 50 years there are people I've met church and you meet them and you talk to them and they've only got one thing they want to talk about and it's something that happened in the past and you go back a year later and they're still talking about it and you go back a year later and still talking about it why they are bound by circumstances they're Bound by events they're Bound by the feelings that are tied to those events and you say my brother my sister you don't say it but you think it how can this be all that you can talk about it's because they're in bondage they're in bondage to their past Son of God doesn't say I'm in rough circumstances God of God doesn't say I was born this way what do they say I was born to be more than all of these things I was B I Was Born to Live above it I was born to move past it I was born to get the Victory and come into full Liberty that's the mindset of a child of God take it back to David because David I I just I I David is almost unfathomable to me because he he's chosen out of nowhere he's Anointed with the spirit of God and almost immediately gets a great Victory does everything right and then starts scrambling to live for the next 15 years and and and his the the worship and the praise that came out of that but also we see the the real thoughts of David's heart David had dark moments absolutely David had dark moments where he's saying God why do the Heathen why do they they benefit why do they grow Rich why does it seem like they prosper and I'm out here struggling just to make ends me I'm struggling to stay alive and they're prospering Lord but David had found a place remember what David was known for he was known for going out and going in and coming out David knew how to find the will of God then he go do it then he come back and he go in and find the will of God and then he go do it and David had perfect Victory because he could go into the presence of God and he could find what God wanted to do I want to share something a brother shared with me yesterday and just blessed me I wanted to take it as we start to close out this service this morning Jesus said the son doesn't have to leave the house the slave has to leave but the son doesn't amen and this that that slave Is Us in the starting point in our flesh and these different things we're Bound in sin we're Bound in reasons we're Bound in excuses in circumstances that slave is just a son that hasn't been set free yet that's all it's the same person all throughout but what's going to make that change in our lives what is it that's going to do the work that we can't seem to do for ourselves David had this beautiful key in Psalm 23 very familiar scripture only six verses he says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's a son's testimony I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restores my soul church that means if he's restoring it it's because it needs restoring we can't sit here and say I don't need it we need it we need to have a time where we can lay everything down have you I've done this a couple times in the past few days have you ever just in the middle of the day gone in and laid down on your bed and let everything in your body relax no when you go do it you just kind of and you let the weight off and you let your breath out and you just relax and you sink into that bed and everything's supported and you're just at comfort and peace and if you lay there for about 3 minutes your eyes will start to get heavy cuz you're just at such a place of rest what is it your body's being restored you're working hard you got things on your mind you're going you're running to and fro all these things and you just lay down and you take a break the body needs it guess what our soul needs restoration sometimes yes that's what church is for but listen you can't go to church every day you got to have a place of restoration a place of recharge a place where you can just let things go and just rest in his presence he says he restores my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff come for me he didn't say times weren't hard church he said I'll take you through you'll never see what promise in the scriptures that he would take the hard times out of our life what he would do has used them for our benefit but watch these last two verses he says Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever so Jesus says the son doesn't have to leave the house David gives us a picture of what's happening in the house he's giving us a clue as to what the answer is I want to focus on verse 5 because if you stop and think about what verse 5 looks at it'll help us recognize our position as a child of God this is the this is the difference between an experience as a slave and an experience as a son this is the difference between truth and religion is verse five here what's happening in the house he says you're in the presence of the father you're at his table he provides for you he comforts you he gives you you strength he meets your needs he gives you Direction he's the source of all you need that's what David's saying he's saying everything I need he has provided that's what's going on in the house but I want you to see something but David's description in verse 5 is not he takes away my hard times David says what I'm doing in his presence the enemies are still there the circumstances are still there the hardships are still there if you could build a mental picture this morning you're sitting down at the at the at the table in your home wherever that might be and the arrows are flying overhead and there's shouts and there's chaos and there's bullets and there's yelling and there's screaming and there's distractions but David's still eating the circumstances have not moved on what's not what's changing here Church the circumstances aren't changing it's David that's being changed David's attitude David's response David's nature is being changed as he sits at this table because before he would say why do the wicked Prosper why did the Heathen rage and these different things now he's sitting there and he's sitting at the table and he's saying you're anointing my head with oil you're pouring your spirit out on me my cup runs over I've got more than I need and the enemies are still all around the circumstances are still there the hardships are still there the persecution still there and his testimony is my cup runneth over something's changed church and it's not the circumstances it's the Son of God in the house of God in the presence of the father that's what we're looking for not change circumstance change me what's he eating at the table he's eating a word that's been prepared just for him he's eating a meal that's been prepared to meet the needs and the challenges of his day it's just for him thou prepares the table before me in other words he looks at him and he brings what he has need of to the table I don't know if you know it this morning but you're eating a meal that's been prepared for you it isn't happen stance it is a specific diet that God has ordained for you this morning you're feeding on Christ the word and it's building up your awareness of who who you are and the unchanging position that you hold as a child of God regardless of what's going on around you was that song we sing Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this Earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace see when you focus on him everything just starts to drift away and you can have peace in the storm you ever noticed that story of of the disciples and Jesus in the boat and in the storm Jesus is sleeping while they're all in a panic why he knows who he is the storm doesn't bother him see what happens in this is the slave comes in and he serves the food he doesn't eat the food now maybe the master will throw him something maybe he'll give him some scraps maybe he'll let him eat the leftovers when it's all said and done but the the son doesn't do that see the son sits down and what's there is for the son he's been called by the father to the table and the food that's there is prepared for them and he eats and he eats and he eats until he is fully satisfied he does not pick and choose he sits there and everything that he takes in is for his good every need is supplied at the table what is the overcoming in this the overcoming is to know that the the word that you're eating has already overcome every circumstance every demon every sickness every hurt every pain every genetic flaw that you have and that's why you're eaing it you're reading the overcoming word it's already overcome you know that old cedral song that they used to sing I've read the back of the book and we win church if we would eat this if we would read this if we would take it in with knowledge that it works with an understanding that it is already done in the Eternal Eyes Of God I believe we walk a little differently day by day it's already done the battle's over victory's been won amen if we'd understand that the word has already overcome because the word of God cannot return to him void the scripture says it must do what it was sent out to do see it's to stay at the table and keep eating and keep eating and keep eating until you come to a place of overcoming you don't have to leave his presence that's why I said if our only time in the presence of God is in church then we are still in a slave mentality we've forgotten our position but when you walk out these doors his presence is supposed to go with you because his word goes with you and it feeds you and it sustains you day in and day out and day in and day out and it reminds you I am a child of God that's what's going on that son has a different mindset see the son was called to the table servants aren't called to the table it's the son that's called it's the daughter that's called The Dinner Bell the text that says supper is ready only goes to the children come and eat it's ready for you what you have need of I prepared a table just for you and the point here that David's saying is eat no matter what see what happens too often is we wait until we're in the battle to start eating it's like trying to eat healthy once you're fat it's a lot harder but if you eat right all the way up it's a little simpler isn't it you don't want to have to build strength when you need strength cuz when the battle's going on we don't get to eat so much but if we're eating if we're exercising our faith if we're feasting on the word of God then when the trial comes then guess what we've got what we need to face the situation but if we're dried out by ease of living and comfort then we come to the trial and all of a sudden we're gasping it's like we you know we start play hockey in the in the fall and the first couple games are brutal because you've not been playing hockey so you have no wind you have no stamina and you're huffing and puffing out there but if you keep at it all of a sudden by the end of the season you got all this you can skate all day seems like same thing for a child of God eat no matter what when life is good eat more CU as brother Joe liked to tell me there's a light in the tunnel and it's not it's not daylight it's a truck coming your way there's a battle coming listen you're a child of God there are going to be battles and listen it may not be with others it may be internal but there's a battle coming because there's a resurrection and Rapture we've got to make and he's got to prepare a bride and she's got to be ready for these things that slave only has temporary Victory people that come to church get something and then walk away and they don't get anything the rest of the week they're a slave we're not meant to live that way we're meant to have Victory every single day we're supposed to be eating every single day we're supposed to be taking in the word amen God put the word in our lives to have action to have life remember what it said in Revelation 10 it said the angel said to John eat the book eat the book the book is what's going to make the difference John if you'll take it into your life it'll do something that you've never been able to do yourself amen we have to take what's been prepared whether it's for our healing whether it's for admonition whether it's for correction encouragement strength whatever it is we have a need of you give me a need this morning I can point you to a scripture that'll give you what you need but you've got to be feeding on it you got to take these things in what what Jesus said he says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if you can't take the truth you can never be free remember what Paul was talking about Timothy he says they can't handle the truth and because they can't handle it because they can't accept it they'll never be free truth is hard sometimes but let me tell you what did David say he says Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies Church you take what you're fighting and you start eating the word and see what happens to what you're fighting brother Eddie bisc preached on this and he says you take that word and you put cancer in front of it what happens to cancer brother Bob it leaves you put your family situation in front of it and what happens it's resolved you put your health in front of and what happens it comes back listen it can be finances it can be anything you take it and you take the word and you eat that part of the word that applies to you it'll do its job we've seen it we've seen people healed of cancer we've seen lives changed we've seen families change listen I'm not talking out there I'm talking in here in here I'm not here to preach a a theology this morning I'm here to preach and experience you can be changed you're meant to be changed you're supposed to be changed he wants you to be changed amen That Word is Alive it has power in it it can't return to God unfulfilled listen we're in the last of the four beasts remember there those four beasts that surround the The Throne of God the presence of God and that last one is an eagle let me tell you what is the eagle anointing the eagle anointing is to take you above not to change the circumstances Lions change circumstances beasts suffer through it the the ox it just gives its life for it the man he he argues his way through it but the eagle flies above it circumstances don't change what changes is his position that's the liberty of a Son of God is it brings you up into Heavenly places it shows you where you're allowed to live where you're meant to live an eagle is not happy down on the ground an eagle is Happy up here and it's that effortless flying we've seen a bunch of Eagles when we went on our our trip out west we saw three or four I think throughout the time and you see them and they're just effortless they just soore sore sore and then they might dive down grab food go eat it and then they just go up and they sore and it's effortless that's what the liberty of a child of God is secure in the calling of God secure in the calling of God that all things work for our good amen he'll take us through these Leo dea's anointing is this you have a right to be the way you are God's anointing that eagle anointing says you have a right to be the way God is what a difference stay in bondage or go into Liberty Isaiah said this he says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a stand standard against him has the enemy come in like a flood has he pushed into areas of Our Lives I say he has this morning absolutely he has we Face sicknesses we Face struggles we Face trials he comes in like a flood Isaiah says he'll raise up a standard what does raising up the standard do it rallies the troops it brings in help it brings in something to help you do what you can't do on your own that's what the standard raising is about is to Rally everybody to your help it'll bring reinforcements to the situation one of my favorite quotes I've read this many times he says but now when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard what is it he is pouring in his Spirit listen we've got an open word the problem's not the word question is how much will we let him come in he says and then those who are resting under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying how long Lord how long how much longer he says God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you it's adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness the power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into the Rapture catch that he says God's waiting on you and me that implies that we have a choice here what's that choice do do we go with the word or do we go with circumstances do we go with the word do we go with emotions do we go with the word or do we go with what we were born with whatever it is we have a choice take what these five senses tell us take what the inner five senses feel and experience or we can take the word of God and every choice becomes a battle every choice becomes a battle because Satan's not going to stand there and let us stand on the word he's going to fight us every single time and so you got to say I'm going to go on to Liberty that means there's a battle or I'm going to stay right where I am and that's the easiest thing because it doesn't require a battle at all it's our choice this morning what's God waiting on us to say I'm done I'm finished I've had enough no more I'm ready to move on up I'm ready to let go I'm ready to lay down I'm ready for the chain breaker we've all got areas things that hold us things that have held us amen and he's here to say I can set you free but you've got to ask for it remember we read that quote brother Braham said that nobody came into the presence of Christ with the right attitude but what they received that they asked for but they had to come into His presence and they had to want it they had to ask for it the challenge today is lay down your rights to feel to believe to think to react and say I'd rather have the rights of a Son of God that gets to walk free of a daughter of God that can lay these things down and move on as if they were never there in the first place amen God's waiting on us to say I'm sick of being a Slave that's it sick and tired of being sick and tired and I'm ready to just move forward in the Liberty he offered two scriptures in a quote he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Liv Liberty is living where we ought to not where we just are it's where the word says we can live he says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image this is the working of the spirit in our lives as Believers from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord that word Glory there means change from one manifestation into another manifestation into another manifestation into another manifestation it's a progressive revealing of Christ in you listen we aren't born as full- born Believers were born as babies in Christ as we preached on so recently but there's a progressive revealing it was um we uh you know we you go visit people that have babies we went to see Martha's Martha and uh Chris's baby there Christian and we're looking at him and you're trying to find out who he who he looks like I'm sorry to say he doesn't look like a coffee yet but you be surprised what may come out but for now as a little baby looks like the penny side of the family but we'll see what he looks like when he's a full- grown man by God's grace because what he remember what Paul says we do not yet appear but we shall be it's the same thing as a daughter of God a child of God Son of God doesn't always appear what you are but you're changed from manifestation of God to manifestation of God and all of a sudden those the DNA starts to show and starts to break through and all of a sudden people say hey you're not related to the coffees are you yeah actually I am my mom's a coffee and what we thought would never break through comes through that's the working of the spirit in our lives Romans 8 he says because the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption what is the bondage of corruption it's this flesh and everything that comes with it Church your nature your DNA your gifts your attributes your faults your failures your weaknesses and your strengths it's all corrupt he says we'll be delivered from that into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God what's that it's a body change but before that there's liberty after Liberty after Liberty after liberty before you come into the Glorious Liberty of a full body change he says and all that come to me I'll give them Zoey my own life I will give them my own life and they shall never perish I'll raise him up in the last day in other words he says everyone that comes to me I'll wrap him in me amen and he'll become a part of me and he can no more die than I can die for I'm Immortal and can't die and his soul is Immortal and can't die and I'll raise him up again at the last day he says then that just makes us when the old trials get hard Church there's are trials hard this morning he says then it gets us to say in me dwelleth the spirit of God there's no good thing in here but him that's in there I'm not my own I am his he says I don't look for the things of the world I look for him for my hope is built on him someday I shall see him and that's all I have longed for what I live for is to bring people to him he says and I tell you the old shackles begin to drop off and you start walking a new again what are we living for Comfort ease justification affirmation acceptance money wealth Fame Fortune he says I tell you when I live for him that's when the old shackles start to drop off we get our focus on the right thing things God's waiting on us listen you've got to want your healing but you've got to want the change that also comes with that healing CU remember how God deals with a son or daughter as he deals with them differently there are no expectations of a child of this world children of this world can come in and be healed by simple Faith but a child of God there's often a change that comes with that healing there's a change that comes with Deliverance because so many times we've wrapped something else around that situation and he's trying to break that situation before he gives us our healing before he gives us our deliverance before he gives us a change he's saying no no no there's a deeper issue here and let me deal with that before I give you your healing before I give you your deliverance before I give you your direction God's trying to get us to a place where we'll let go of everything not just come for what we want but come for what he wants of us amen see God's not a doting grandfather when we went to the to the Gales Jensen was kind of looking around and he noticed some chocolates so he helped himself to a chocolate and the wonderful thing about The gales is that they love children and she said he said I may eat all of these and she said well there's more over there and there's also more over there see doting grandparents I said you keep doing this you're going to have grandkids more grandkids than you want something along those lines the easiest way you can make friends with a kid is give them what they want God's not here to make us friends God's here to make us Sons and Daughters see what we come in is we come in and we say I want the chocolate God says not until you eat your chicken and broccoli first grandparents say come in and eat all the chocolate you want see God's trying to remember what what it was at James that said I would that you would prosper and be in good health even as your Soul does prosper see God's worried about our soul everything else comes and goes like I said you're we're healed today tomorrow we're sick it's temporary but the soul is the Eternal part and he wants that to be healthy above all else but we have to want with that to lay down what we have what we're holding on to we have to want to step into what God has for us listen remember Jacob was a Shyer until he got desperate and then he wrestled with God and Jacob came to a place of rest after he' wrestled with God and Jacob's Health was never the same his hip never recovered after he wrestled but Jacob had a rest he never had when he was fighting all the time cuz he thought he had to fight to get whatever he needed he had to lay that down so that God could call him Israel a prince having power with God one quote as we close he says there is the body of Christ living standing redeemed redeemed he says oh my justified in his sight why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in these last days with the Glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory it shows that he couldn't keep them in the grave and neither can they keep us that's right amen God bless you let's stand if we would the musicians can come if you want Victory this morning you want Liberty you've got to be able to lay down your reasons your excuses your justifications your ideas your knowledge and just say Lord here I am this is me I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord I had a lot of ideas about a lot of people but when I finally gave my life to him all that I was focused on was me and I realized how badly I needed him and it didn't matter what other people were doing at that point I think that's the time when God can come to us and move in the greatest way is when we say Lord here I am I'm not coming perfect listen I've been serving the lord now for 28 years 28 years almost still ain't perfect still got flaws still got issues he's dealing with but I've got to be able to come to him and say Lord here I am again still got issues Lord can we take care of one this week this month this year some of these are big things some of them can take a year to deal with not that God can't do it in a moment but see there's roots and there's things that are tied to that and you start tugging on one and there's usually a few other things come along with it and we've got to be able to say Lord I'm willing to do whatever it takes lay down whatever it takes humble myself whatever it takes let go surrender whatever it takes to let you have that and then what do we do we step back into our Posta Duty we sayl I'm trusting you to take me through you I Marvel at Joseph he came to the end of all of his trials and what was his attitude God was in it David finally gets the throne he didn't want it he doesn't trying to get it he finally gets the throne and what does he do to Saul's family he says I'll take care of you we look at that woman at the well she finally met a man that told her the things she needed to be told and what did she say she didn't run back to those people and say how come you guys couldn't have done this she ran out and she said come see a man come see somebody that can do for you what he did for me and I believe with all my heart she went on and she got the Holy Ghost after the day of Pentecost what is it it's a jubilee trumpet it's a child of God recognizing hey I'm allowed to go free I don't have to stay in this condition I don't have to stay in this hurt I don't have to stay in this hardship I can rest I can trust I can be changed I can have these shackles broken this morning amen amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord your word says you've called us out of the bondage of corruption Lord into the Glorious Liberty of Sons and Daughters of God and Lord you know our struggles you know our trials you know our hardships Lord you know our weaknesses you know the things that we do Lord we just seem to deal with them constantly Lord you know those besetting sins big and small Lord you know the habits Lord you know the emotions that are tied to situations long past maybe not so long past Lord you know all things Lord and we can see how Satan can use those to bind us but Lord there's liberty here this morning Lord your word says where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Lord and that Liberties for the children of God lord I pray this morning Lord that you take this simple message Lord that we take it we reflect in our hearts and in our lives and in our minds Lord and we look at those places where we need to be set free Lord and this morning we'd ask you to set us free Lord I pray there be a shout of victory in the camp this morning Lord I pray there be testimonies come out Lord of people that have laid themselves down so you could break the shackles Lord give us a a mindset of a child of God that you got a table prepared Lord and it meets our every need Lord Grace this morning we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen 12:19 no longer a Slave you have covered
