[28:25] here this morning but trusting that God
[28:27] has given us a message for the people

[28:31] and guiding us and that it'll be a
[28:33] blessing here this morning

[28:48] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[28:51] lord according as his divine power ha
[28:54] given unto us all things that pertain
[28:57] unto life and godliness through the
[28:59] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[29:01] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[29:05] us exceeding great and precious promises
[29:08] that by these you might be partakers of
[29:11] the divine nature having escaped the
[29:13] corruption that is in the world through
[29:14] lust and beside this giving all
[29:17] diligence add to your faith virtue and

[29:24] and to patience godliness and to
[29:26] Godliness brotherly kind kindness and to
[29:29] brotherly kindness charity amen we'll
[29:32] just bow our heads for a word of prayer
[29:34] Heavenly
[29:35] Father Lord we're trusting you this
[29:37] morning once again Lord we're trusting
[29:39] your Holy Spirit to anoint the speaker
[29:42] to anoint the hearer Lord to go into
[29:44] each home to go into each heart and soul
[29:47] lord to deal with us this morning Lord
[29:49] just grant us Grace to give it Grace to
[29:51] receive it Heavenly Father Lord meet the
[29:54] needs Lord you know what's in each life
[29:56] what's in each Heart Lord what each
[29:58] desire is and we pray that you would
[29:59] just Minister this morning Lord set me
[30:01] aside Lord and may you speak from this
[30:03] Pulpit this morning we ask Lord we're
[30:06] trusting you we're trusting the shed
[30:07] blood Lord to cover every mistake Lord
[30:10] every little thing every big thing we've
[30:11] done Lord we're claiming it this morning
[30:13] Lord we're saying we're sorry for where
[30:14] we've fallen short Lord and we're asking
[30:17] once again that you would strengthen us
[30:18] for battle Lord that you would make us
[30:20] fit for Kingdom Service in your name we
[30:22] ask and pray amen amen you can have your
[30:25] seats this morning we want to continue
[30:28] again on the Royal seed series I'm going
[30:30] to continue on the final Harvest and
[30:32] I've studied and I've prayed and just
[30:34] dwelt on things for so long on this and
[30:36] I'm I'm really struggling to close it
[30:37] out because as I was telling brother
[30:39] Paul before the service when we talk
[30:40] about the Royal seed we're talking about
[30:42] a predestinated mature bride and just
[30:45] about everything in the scriptures can
[30:47] be tied into that for us you know so I
[30:49] am going to try and bring it to a close
[30:50] not today but certainly soon but um
[30:54] anyways we'll see where the Lord takes
[30:55] us and and what he lays on my heart but
[30:57] we are going to continue this for just a
[30:58] little bit more this is a bit of a
[31:00] different scripture perhaps to take in
[31:02] second Peter 1 this is the statue of a
[31:04] perfect Man
[31:05] chapter and uh maybe not something you'd
[31:08] expect when we talk about the final
[31:09] Harvest but uh we want to so often we're
[31:12] talking about you know an Endtime bride
[31:14] and we're talking about signs and
[31:15] wonders and great Miracles and these
[31:18] things and we should be expecting those
[31:19] and we have seen those things amen we've
[31:21] seen those things not just in brother
[31:22] bram's Ministry but we've seen it in a
[31:24] worldwide Ministry and even in our own
[31:26] church where God has come down and done
[31:28] things sovereignly and miraculously in
[31:30] our lives but we don't want to just
[31:32] leave it there because remember we've
[31:34] read the scripture where they said
[31:35] they'll come in that day and say hey we
[31:36] did all these wonderful things in your
[31:38] name he says get away I never knew you
[31:41] right and it reminds me of where he
[31:42] talked to the Pharisees and they he says
[31:44] you know you tithe all the way down to
[31:46] your mint and your cumin but you forget
[31:48] you neglect the weightier matters of the
[31:49] law and what is he talking about he's
[31:51] talking about the day-to-day life he's
[31:53] talking about the application of the
[31:55] word not just the literal law that they
[31:57] were doing amen so this morning we're
[31:59] going to get down to the day today we're
[32:00] going to get down to where the rubber
[32:01] meets the road and literally I had
[32:03] something where the rubber meets the
[32:04] road happened last week I was driving
[32:06] and a certain incident happened and
[32:08] right after that incident uh God just
[32:10] kind of stepped into the car and dwelt
[32:11] with me for a little bit to to deal with
[32:13] me on some things and so I'm going to
[32:15] share that with you this morning what
[32:16] happened and kind of what God was was
[32:18] opening up in my life but I want to be
[32:20] very careful when I as I preached this
[32:22] morning that the sermon is based on what
[32:24] I experienced that day and it's based on
[32:26] what God's working with me on
[32:28] and whenever God deals with you on
[32:30] something it's always very raw it's
[32:32] always pure it's always bright and
[32:34] there's no getting away from it and so I
[32:36] would expect that as I share with you
[32:38] what he's doing with me it's probably
[32:40] going to have a similar effect in your
[32:41] life and I'm hoping that it'll have the
[32:43] similar effect in your life because God
[32:45] when he does these things it's a
[32:47] supernatural event and nothing is hidden
[32:49] from God we know that amen he sees all
[32:51] things so as I'm speaking this morning
[32:53] as I'm bringing this this message to you
[32:55] this morning I don't want you to fight
[32:57] it amen I don't want you to think well
[32:59] brother John knows about this or brother
[33:00] John knows about that I'm preaching to
[33:02] myself this morning I'm not looking at a
[33:04] certain situation or certain people or
[33:06] anything like that we've all got needs
[33:08] we've all got issues in our lives amen
[33:10] but I'm preaching to myself this morning
[33:11] and I'm letting the word go out and do
[33:13] what it needs to do in your life amen
[33:15] sister Morin shared this with this this
[33:17] scripture with me a couple years ago and
[33:19] it's stuck with me ever since and it's
[33:20] Ephesians 5:13 I just wrote it here on
[33:23] my notes it says but all things that are
[33:25] reproved are made manifest by by the
[33:28] light for whatsoever do make manifest is
[33:32] light what it's saying is whatever
[33:33] reveals something is light in Darkness
[33:36] Darkness doesn't reveal Darkness amen
[33:38] Darkness doesn't reveal what's hidden
[33:39] there but light is what reveals what's
[33:41] been hidden and it's what makes it
[33:43] obvious what makes manifest what is
[33:45] actually in the room what's in your life
[33:46] and these things amen so in this service
[33:48] I'm not looking at anyone and I don't
[33:49] want you to look at anyone else amen
[33:51] let's look at ourselves let's look in
[33:52] the mirror of God's word and let's say
[33:54] Lord what would you have for me this
[33:56] morning amen again nothing targeted I'm
[33:59] looking at my life it's a big enough
[34:01] challenge to deal with myself I don't
[34:03] want to be dealing with other people as
[34:04] well you know let's just let the word of
[34:06] God have its effect in our own lives and
[34:08] trust him to work in the person next to
[34:09] us as well amen I've been dwelling a lot
[34:12] on the fruits of the spirit in my own
[34:13] mind and in my own study you know we're
[34:15] talking about the final Harvest and we
[34:17] as we talked last time it's the Fruit
[34:19] Harvest amen it's the richness of
[34:21] everything it's the juiciness it's it's
[34:23] the good harvest it's the best tasting
[34:25] Harvest it's it's the best for your
[34:26] senses and these different different
[34:27] things it's where the new wine comes
[34:29] from and all these different things and
[34:31] I've been dwelling a lot on that and
[34:32] we're going to focus on just one area of
[34:34] that maybe this morning and we opened up
[34:36] with that scripture in second Peter 1
[34:37] and brother Bram says this is the statue
[34:39] of a perfect man scripture but he's
[34:41] referring back to Ephesians 4 and I'll
[34:43] put it up here real quick it says and he
[34:45] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[34:48] some evangelists and some pastors and
[34:50] teachers amen so this is the five-fold
[34:52] ministry and this is critical for the
[34:54] believer you have to have all five of
[34:56] these in the believer's body amen he
[34:58] says and what's it given for verse 12
[35:00] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[35:02] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[35:04] the body of Christ amen so we'll see the
[35:07] purpose and effect of the fivefold
[35:08] ministry because it's made apparent here
[35:10] and that's that it brings maturity which
[35:12] is perfection and edification which is
[35:15] growth and a positive impact amen
[35:17] scriptural and spiritual it's going to
[35:20] have a scriptural effect meaning what
[35:21] the word says they're going to do it's
[35:23] going to happen in the people's life and
[35:24] it's going to have a spiritual effect
[35:26] and that it will raise and it will
[35:27] Elevate the people to another plane
[35:29] another level in their walk with Christ
[35:31] amen if this is not what's coming out of
[35:33] the ministry then they are not a true
[35:35] Minister literally it's that simple if
[35:38] that is not the effect of their Ministry
[35:40] if a church is stagnant if the people
[35:41] aren't growing then there's a problem
[35:43] and it's not just the people it's going
[35:45] to mean the ministry is not effective
[35:47] and needs to be moved right that's what
[35:49] you got we're talking about real
[35:50] ministers now and then we're talking
[35:52] about men with calls in their lives from
[35:53] the foundations of the world not put
[35:55] there because somebody voted them in not
[35:57] put there because they thought this or
[35:58] that but because the proof of their
[36:00] Ministry is in the people that's the
[36:02] only proof of their Ministry is in the
[36:03] people when we're talking five-fold it's
[36:05] got to be seen in the body of
[36:07] Christ verse 13 says till we all come in
[36:11] the unity of the faith and of the
[36:13] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[36:15] perfect man unto the measure of the
[36:17] stature of the fullness of Christ so
[36:19] there is also an ending to this fivefold
[36:21] ministry and by that I mean there is
[36:23] coming an end to the effect of them
[36:25] because the scripture says they're given
[36:27] for this purpose until we all come into
[36:29] the unity of Faith what's that Unity of
[36:32] the faith it's a Rapture so trusting
[36:34] that every real Minister will go in that
[36:36] Rapture amen but there is a short season
[36:39] at the end where we are done and brother
[36:41] Bram alludes to this multiple times
[36:42] where he says there comes an end where
[36:43] all you're doing is you're casting your
[36:45] Pearls Before Swine you're literally
[36:47] preaching only to the lost because
[36:49] everybody's done it's a finished work
[36:51] and there's a quick short work that's
[36:52] done and when that's done now you're
[36:54] just resting in the presence of the son
[36:56] and those ministers they'll keep
[36:57] preaching the word because that's the
[36:59] that's the unction in their life amen
[37:00] that's the drive of the holy spirit in
[37:02] them but there comes a point where it's
[37:04] everything's done right the bride's
[37:06] sealed everybody's in and then there's
[37:08] that quick short work at the end and
[37:10] even you think about when the dead rise
[37:11] first and they spend that bit of time
[37:13] with us nobody's coming in after that
[37:14] brothers and sisters that's it that is
[37:16] the culmination for the Gentile and so
[37:19] you're going to have those 30 to 40 days
[37:20] that brother Braham talked about
[37:22] pointing back to what happened with
[37:23] Jesus day where those Saints dwelt for a
[37:25] while and then they were caught up with
[37:26] Christ and they were gone amen there's a
[37:28] time where this is going to end where
[37:29] it's not going to have an effect they'll
[37:31] still keep preaching but there is an
[37:32] ending to this natural Ministry amen but
[37:35] it also points us to a time where there
[37:38] is a season for a mature bride right A
[37:40] Perfect Bride that Perfection does not
[37:42] speak of a lack of uh flaws or or
[37:45] sinlessness but rather it speaks of
[37:47] maturity amen because we're still in
[37:49] sinful flesh and so we can never get rid
[37:51] of that amen but when it's all said and
[37:54] done when we come to the unity of the
[37:56] faith just before that rapture is the
[37:57] bride going to have she's going to have
[37:59] a revelation of who she is what she has
[38:02] and what to do with it and me that's
[38:04] what we're looking for here that's the
[38:05] maturity of a bride is when she knows
[38:07] who she is amen my wife knows who she is
[38:11] and her name is Blanca klette amen it's
[38:13] not Blanca neis anymore it's who she is
[38:15] she's attached to me she knows what she
[38:17] is she knows she's my wife and she knows
[38:19] what she has everything that's mine is
[38:21] hers and everything's as hers as hers
[38:23] right no sorry what she has access to
[38:27] everything that that's mine amen she
[38:28] knows who she is she knows what she is
[38:30] and she knows what she's supposed to do
[38:31] with it because I've authorized her I've
[38:33] given her power to use what I have for
[38:36] the benefit of the family that we've
[38:38] made together amen so Paul points ahead
[38:41] to this time and then Peter now as we
[38:43] read in the first in the in the first
[38:45] scripture that we read he pulls up the
[38:46] old tablet and he starts writing down
[38:48] what this stature of a perfect man looks
[38:49] like and this is what brother brandham
[38:51] said so we're going to walk through it
[38:52] here a little bit this morning and just
[38:54] drive some things home to set a
[38:55] foundation so he said Grace and peace be
[38:58] multiplied unto you through the
[38:59] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[39:02] according as his divine power ha given
[39:04] unto us all things that pertain unto
[39:07] life and godliness now that's not just
[39:10] life as we walk through this world but
[39:12] that is the life amen that's all things
[39:14] that pertain to the life of a Believer
[39:16] and godliness through the knowledge of
[39:18] him that ha called us to glory and
[39:20] virtue I mean what a beautiful reminder
[39:22] we see that he says he has given us all
[39:24] things so when you say I have lack it's
[39:26] not because it's not there it's because
[39:28] you haven't taken advantage of it amen
[39:30] that you haven't laid hold of it but he
[39:31] says he's given us everything that we
[39:33] have need of as it pertains to the
[39:35] Christian walk and to Godliness as in
[39:37] the requirement of us to live life a
[39:38] certain way brother Braham says this he
[39:41] says and that's the way a Christian is
[39:43] we are planted together in Christ Jesus
[39:45] who is the inexhaustible Fountain of
[39:48] Life we're planted in Christ and we just
[39:50] drink and drink and drink and push out
[39:53] and everything we have need of for the
[39:55] Earthly Journey Divine Healing the power
[39:57] of God and all these other things is in
[40:00] every individual in here is in every
[40:03] individual in here that's receive the
[40:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost for you are
[40:08] planted in Christ he says hallelujah the
[40:11] Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and
[40:13] everything you have need of for this
[40:15] life's journey even the Rapture is right
[40:18] in you then amen Divine Healing the
[40:20] power of God he says even the Rapture is
[40:22] within you right now why or how by the
[40:25] baptism of the Holy Spirit so you say
[40:27] brother Jonathan we need to pray we have
[40:29] need for this we have need for that no
[40:32] we have it all already right we've
[40:34] covered this in in in great detail in
[40:36] the last few weeks of what we have
[40:38] within us when you have the Holy Ghost
[40:40] everything is within you and the Holy
[40:41] Ghost is there to Quicken you to God's
[40:43] word so it's not that we don't have that
[40:45] we need it it's that we have to take
[40:47] hold of it amen we have to step into
[40:49] God's Armory we have to step into God's
[40:51] refrigerator we have to step step into
[40:53] God's pharmacy we have to step into
[40:55] God's surgical room to take care of the
[40:56] things we're facing and sometimes it's
[40:58] Inward and sometimes it's outward but
[41:00] everything we have need of is within us
[41:03] and it's within the word that is
[41:04] quickened by what is within us in the
[41:06] first place
[41:08] amen that's right what do we pray for we
[41:10] pray to find the will of God we pray to
[41:12] align with the word of God and then we
[41:14] step forward in faith when we find it
[41:16] the the the effect of prayer is to give
[41:18] us Faith to do what God wants us to do
[41:21] right it's not to ask permission we
[41:23] should be asking Lord what do you want
[41:24] us to do what do you want us to do I'm
[41:25] not saying that but rather to step into
[41:28] the place where we know what he wants
[41:29] done and move forward in faith and
[41:31] that's what prayer is is getting us into
[41:32] the mind and purpose of God each
[41:36] one continuing now in in 2 Peter 1:4
[41:39] says whereby are given unto us great and
[41:42] precious promises these are given for a
[41:45] reason it's that the by these ye might
[41:47] be partakers of the divine nature having
[41:50] escaped the corruption that is in the
[41:52] world through
[41:54] lust amen the greatest challenge for us
[41:57] is to keep pressing forward with those
[41:59] with those great and precious promises
[42:01] do you know what the greatest challenge
[42:02] is for an army greatest challenge for an
[42:04] army is not to blow up the other guys is
[42:06] to keep the supplies coming so that they
[42:08] can continue to press forward amen
[42:10] that's what I was talking about when I
[42:12] say we have everything we have need of
[42:13] you look at great battle plans and the
[42:15] the battle is not can we beat the other
[42:17] guys it's can we keep our guys supplied
[42:19] long enough to hold what they've taken
[42:21] and to keep them moving forward when you
[42:24] look at in Iraq how many hundreds of
[42:26] thousands and millions of liters and and
[42:29] barrels of gasoline that they needed
[42:30] just to keep pushing through in Iraq
[42:32] it's insane absolutely incredible and
[42:34] basically for every tank you had you
[42:36] needed 10 trucks to supply that tank so
[42:39] when you got a thousand tanks what do
[42:41] you need a lot of trucks back and forth
[42:44] back and forth back and forth to keep
[42:45] these things supplied but we have what
[42:46] we need right within us that's the
[42:48] beauty of it is we carry with us
[42:50] everything that we have need when you
[42:51] have the word you have the sword of the
[42:53] word by your side and you have the Holy
[42:54] Spirit In Your Heart everything you have
[42:56] need of is right there amen you look at
[42:59] brother Bram he emphasized the the
[43:01] Gentile way of believe of accepting the
[43:04] word of God is Not by laying on of hands
[43:06] it's to accept the word and move forward
[43:07] amen so we don't have to have that
[43:09] happen it's still there for us amen we
[43:11] can still have people come up and be
[43:13] prayed for but if you've got the word
[43:14] and you've got faith activated you need
[43:16] nobody else that's it right every
[43:19] believer is authorized to take this and
[43:21] step forward and use it in their life
[43:22] amen so we want to have faith to do that
[43:25] and and Peter says here he says we've
[43:27] been given exceeding great and precious
[43:29] promises that you could be what
[43:31] partakers of the divine nature we
[43:33] covered this in another service already
[43:35] but it's to allow us to have the nature
[43:36] of God that's what the promises are for
[43:38] is to give us the very nature of God and
[43:41] it's not to build up kingdoms or to rule
[43:43] over people or to Lord over things but
[43:45] rather it's to tear down kingdoms it's
[43:47] to serve people and it's to surrender
[43:49] our will and that's how we have the
[43:50] divine nature of God Amen he says verse
[43:53] five and beside this giving all
[43:55] diligence add to your faith virtue so
[43:57] faith is the starting point and then add
[43:59] to that virtue which is strength to
[44:01] Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[44:02] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[44:04] and to patience godliness and to
[44:06] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[44:08] brotherly kindness charity amen so we
[44:10] said before it always starts with faith
[44:13] it always starts with faith but now
[44:14] Peter says it doesn't just start with
[44:16] faith but now it ends with love starts
[44:18] with faith ends in love amen you got to
[44:20] start with faith towards or faith for
[44:23] the Holy Ghost Faith towards God
[44:24] transforms into the faith of God and it
[44:26] takes you all the way to the peak the
[44:27] Pinnacle which is love right amen it
[44:32] starts with faith and you have to move
[44:34] past the faith point you have to move
[44:35] past belief and it has to step into
[44:37] action me it has to step into a life
[44:39] that's lived and then from there God
[44:41] starts refining that faith and using
[44:43] that Faith now to develop himself to
[44:44] develop his very own nature in you amen
[44:47] and the culmination of that it brings
[44:48] you to a place where you act based on
[44:51] who you are not based on who other
[44:52] people are right it's based on what you
[44:54] are not what they are amen and the
[44:56] problem we get into is when we start
[44:58] trying to do things our way when we see
[45:00] the issues and we start trying to
[45:01] resolve them with our thinking and our
[45:03] thoughts and our preferences and what's
[45:05] easiest for us rather than doing it the
[45:07] way that God does Amen because the
[45:08] minute you do it your own way you've
[45:10] missed the boat and it always leads to
[45:12] two things failure and death amen when
[45:14] God leaves it's a denomination all over
[45:16] when they kick the holy spirit out when
[45:17] they rejected Christ what happened they
[45:19] went after man's ways and man's thinking
[45:21] and all it's led to is death death Death
[45:24] Amen brother Bram said this he said God
[45:28] hates powerless religion it's got to
[45:31] have power in it it's got to have
[45:33] sincerity and sincerity will bring power
[45:36] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[45:40] but genuine power worship to know that
[45:43] you've passed from Death To Life am me
[45:46] there's got to be a revelation behind
[45:47] that worship is what he's saying you
[45:49] don't just worship because that's what
[45:50] you do when you come into church amen
[45:52] you you worship with purpose you worship
[45:54] for a
[45:55] reason he says here's what happened God
[45:58] wants to perform by the Holy
[46:01] Ghost and vindicate his word so the
[46:05] performance of the Holy Ghost in your
[46:06] life the acting of or the working of the
[46:08] Holy Ghost in our life is supposed to do
[46:10] one thing and that's vindicate the word
[46:13] he says but the church wants to perform
[46:16] period they just want to perform they
[46:18] want to put on a show what do they want
[46:19] to do they want to vindicate themselves
[46:22] right I I have to say there's that song
[46:24] that we we've heard before and it says
[46:26] I've got to prove one in I'm one in a
[46:27] million I got to prove I'm not like
[46:29] Satan Eden these things have you guys
[46:31] heard that song it's a message
[46:33] song I'm getting many shakes here but it
[46:36] it's never struck me right because I'm
[46:38] not here to prove me right I'm here to
[46:41] prove the word amen and it's not
[46:43] anything that I'm going to do that's
[46:44] going to do it anyway so why would I
[46:45] point to myself but brother Bram says
[46:47] the holy spirit is here to perform to
[46:49] vindicate the word that's what brother
[46:52] Bram did he always said that it was
[46:54] never him it was always Christ that did
[46:56] the healing he always pointed to the
[46:57] word he pointed to the promise he
[46:59] pointed to the Vindication of the word
[47:01] and said I'm just the one he's using and
[47:03] he left himself with that and me that's
[47:05] what we want to do is we want to say
[47:06] Lord vindicate your word this isn't
[47:08] about me this is about your word but
[47:10] when we become a part of him by the Holy
[47:12] Spirit then that's where the word is in
[47:14] us anyway so it becomes this full circle
[47:16] and we're just part of that that economy
[47:18] of God Amen but he says what vindicate
[47:22] the word that's the purpose of the Holy
[47:24] Spirit In Our Lives amen and Paul's
[47:26] talking or Peter's talking he says
[47:28] charity all the things you add
[47:30] everything up and when you add
[47:31] everything up then charity is the final
[47:32] thing that you get to and as I said this
[47:34] is it this is the peak this is the apex
[47:37] of the stature of a perfect man is love
[47:40] Yeah and we're going to get into a
[47:41] little bit of what that is man he says
[47:43] charity and charity means love and I'll
[47:45] use love instead of Charity because it's
[47:46] the more common word it's the more
[47:47] recognized word these days amen but this
[47:50] isn't just any kind of love when you
[47:52] look at what that word is it's agapo and
[47:54] that's God's love is what he's talking
[47:56] about here so you don't want to get it
[47:57] misconstrued with what the world calls
[47:59] love these days or you don't want to get
[48:00] misconstrued maybe with the love you
[48:02] have for a friend or even a spouse or
[48:04] these different things but rather you
[48:05] want to step into the tress of God's
[48:08] love amen we see and he just before it's
[48:11] interesting that right before Love Comes
[48:12] brotherly kindness because brotherly
[48:14] kindness kind of matches up more like
[48:16] with what the world says is love today
[48:18] if you think about it because the world
[48:19] says especially when they're talking
[48:21] about immorality or or unfortunate
[48:23] situations or the alternate Lifestyles
[48:25] and whatnot what do they say put
[48:27] yourselves in their shoes how do you
[48:28] think they feel right brother Braham
[48:31] said this about brotherly kindness he
[48:33] says when we get to that brotherly
[48:35] kindness he says put yourself in his
[48:37] place on the
[48:39] matter brotherly kindness now you see if
[48:42] a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[48:44] impatient with him see no see be kind to
[48:49] him right the world twist that says put
[48:51] yourself in their shoes and he's saying
[48:52] the same thing put yourself in there but
[48:54] he's saying that doesn't make him right
[48:56] yeah he's saying understand where he's
[48:59] coming from recognize where he's coming
[49:01] from and that'll help you as you start
[49:02] to deal with this brother he said now
[49:04] listen to what he puts it on himself now
[49:07] in his situation he says somebody said
[49:08] not long ago how can you believe these
[49:10] things the way you do and still go to
[49:11] the Assemblies of God and Oneness and
[49:13] all the
[49:14] rest he said brother brandham you're
[49:16] preaching things that they don't even
[49:18] accept they don't believe in those
[49:19] churches and yet you keep going back to
[49:20] them and you preach it over and over
[49:23] again he said then put see brotherly
[49:25] kindness hoping someday see patient with
[49:30] him see temperent enduring with him
[49:34] knowledge to understand what he believes
[49:36] remember it's in his heart that's what
[49:38] it is virtue in
[49:40] yourself strength in yourself that means
[49:43] to let it go out with kindness and
[49:45] meekness to him he's saying there's
[49:47] strength in you to give it in a way that
[49:49] he might be able to receive it rather
[49:50] than punching him between the eyes with
[49:52] your Doctrine that's brotherly kindness
[49:54] he's saying I have to have strength to
[49:56] give it to him in the way that he can
[49:57] receive it hopefully rather than stand
[50:00] in a position of I'm higher you're lower
[50:02] and I've got to really show you it right
[50:03] he's saying let's be temperate let's be
[50:05] kind and meek to him having faith that
[50:08] someday God will bring him in see that's
[50:11] brotherly kindness that's true love is
[50:13] that you would hold your position but
[50:15] you would be in kindness and meekness to
[50:17] them sharing what God has done sharing
[50:19] what God has offered to that person so
[50:21] that hopefully they'll step up into a
[50:22] higher plane amen but that's still not
[50:25] pure love and the thing is we struggle
[50:27] with this part we struggle to do this
[50:30] sometimes Amen to hold our attitude in
[50:31] check when we're dealing with somebody
[50:33] and we have such high expectations for
[50:35] them and they're not responding the way
[50:36] we do do we continue in meekness
[50:38] Temperance and love or do we step up and
[50:41] say well I'm right and you're wrong and
[50:42] I'm not going to have anything to do
[50:43] with
[50:44] you
[50:46] right but the Braham says building this
[50:48] Monument the building this statue see it
[50:50] starts off with the foundation stone
[50:53] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[50:55] patience godliness brother kindliness
[50:57] now what does it do it says then they're
[50:59] waiting for the headstone which is love
[51:02] for God is love and he controls and he
[51:05] is the strength of every one of those
[51:07] things so what he's saying here is you
[51:10] can literally have all of
[51:12] this but you still don't have it he says
[51:15] until you get to this you don't have
[51:17] this he says because God is working
[51:19] through all those things but it's not
[51:21] God they're attributes of God but it's
[51:23] yet not God until you get to the
[51:25] Capstone he says amen amen so as we
[51:29] spoke last service remember we went
[51:31] through the the feasts and the seven
[51:33] days and it started with rest and it
[51:34] ended with rest and whatnot we have here
[51:36] again we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven
[51:39] attributes of God so remember we had
[51:42] seven days of the feast and then we had
[51:43] the eth day now we have seven attributes
[51:46] of God and then we have the eighth
[51:47] attribute now what did we say the eighth
[51:49] was the eth day was what eternity it was
[51:52] that rest and what is that that is God
[51:54] himself amen you are in the Holy Spirit
[51:56] is our rest we talk about it was rest
[51:57] for our soul and so this is the same
[52:00] thing the Eighth Day the eighth
[52:02] attribute is God himself it is eternity
[52:05] and brother Bram says it's the Holy
[52:06] Spirit itself and that is God's love
[52:07] that's God's life within you I'll read
[52:10] it to you right here he says so when you
[52:12] surrender your complete being then the
[52:15] Holy Spirit just pours through you in
[52:18] these virtues then you're a living
[52:20] Tabernacle you say brother Jonathan I
[52:22] have all of these things yes but he says
[52:24] until you're there you don't have it all
[52:26] yet he says it it what it pours through
[52:30] you in these
[52:33] virtues and then you're a living
[52:35] Tabernacle then people look out and say
[52:37] that's a manful of virtue knowledge he
[52:39] believes the word Temperance patience
[52:41] godliness brotherly kindness full of the
[52:44] love of the Holy Ghost see there he is
[52:46] walking
[52:47] around what is it a stature that
[52:50] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[52:52] a Christian there is a man or a woman
[52:55] who knows what they talking about you've
[52:58] never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier
[53:01] person you're sealed a seal shows on
[53:04] both sides whether you're going or
[53:05] coming you see the seal just the same
[53:08] there you are see when a man or woman
[53:11] possesses this then the Capstone comes
[53:13] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[53:15] God which is the Holy
[53:18] Ghost he says if you'd come seeking the
[53:20] Holy Spirit and let him the faith that
[53:23] you got in him add to that virtue and to
[53:25] that brotherly kindness
[53:27] until you're built in the full statue of
[53:29] Christ then the last thing is love which
[53:32] God the Holy Spirit seals you to your
[53:35] destination so this love of God has a
[53:37] sealing effect Amen brother brand ties
[53:40] this scripture to Ephesians 4:30 which
[53:41] we've read so many times now we'll read
[53:43] it again and grieve not the holy spirit
[53:45] of God whereby ye are sealed unto the
[53:48] day of redemption so he saying look
[53:50] you've got to have this all sealed this
[53:53] is all him but this is what makes it him
[53:56] amen this is all a part of him but this
[53:58] is what does it and here's the thing if
[54:00] you take this back to the very nature of
[54:02] the body of the bride of Christ what is
[54:04] it is we are the body and he is the head
[54:07] and he's saying it's no different for
[54:08] you and your life you can have all these
[54:10] things but you got to have him you've
[54:13] got to have love you've got to have God
[54:15] himself in there before these things can
[54:17] truly become subject and give out the
[54:19] very nature and purpose of God in your
[54:21] life amen cuz otherwise what have we
[54:22] seen we've seen people that will do all
[54:24] of this and you can find them in
[54:26] inations today they live a Wonderful
[54:28] Life Wonderful Life and they've got all
[54:30] this but they haven't done this because
[54:32] they rejected the word but they can
[54:34] still do this in sincerity and in truth
[54:36] as best they know it amen they live
[54:38] their lives according to the word as
[54:39] they know it and they'll do all of this
[54:41] but they can't come to hear and what
[54:43] happens eventually is they fall right
[54:45] and you've seen it in the message and
[54:46] you see it outside the message is there
[54:48] comes a point where they have to fall
[54:50] because they don't have the very nature
[54:52] yet they've got everything pointing to
[54:53] it but they don't have it yet brother
[54:55] brah said even when he talked about
[54:57] Pentecost he said what they had the
[54:59] gifts but they didn't accept the giver
[55:01] that's where they ended up
[55:04] amen that Holy Spirit is what glues
[55:07] those things together what ties them
[55:08] together what completes this and until
[55:10] you get that this is not a complete work
[55:13] amen you're believing unto something but
[55:15] you don't have it let's take it back to
[55:17] the scriptures we're going to Anchor
[55:18] this tightly this morning very familiar
[55:20] chapter 1 Corinthians 13 says though I
[55:23] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[55:24] and have not charity I am become a
[55:27] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol that
[55:30] doesn't mean much to us here because we
[55:32] don't have drums in here we don't have
[55:34] anything else that resembles it but in
[55:36] other words it says though I speak in
[55:38] tongues or interpret them if I don't
[55:40] have love I'm like a noisy symbol or a
[55:43] Gong now I don't know about you but a
[55:45] noisy symbol or a Gong is just plain
[55:47] annoying right it's just a
[55:50] big and it just it drives you nuts if
[55:53] somebody were to sit there all day and
[55:54] just hit a Gong next to your desk CU
[55:56] you're working what would you think
[55:58] right somebody's playing a lovely harp a
[55:59] nice classical guitar maybe a soothing
[56:02] saxophone okay gong nobody wants to sit
[56:05] next to a Gong all day long amen that's
[56:06] what he says if you don't have love even
[56:09] if you're doing tongues and
[56:10] interpretation you're like a Gong you
[56:12] become annoying after a while maybe
[56:15] immediately and though I have the gift
[56:17] of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[56:20] and all knowledge and though I have all
[56:23] Faith so that I could remove mountains
[56:25] and have not charity I am nothing what's
[56:27] he saying you can have great gifts
[56:29] tremendous gifts spiritual gifts right
[56:33] all of those things you can do
[56:36] Supernatural things but without love
[56:39] you're
[56:40] nothing and Paul could do all of these
[56:43] things so he's not speaking from a a
[56:46] theory here now because Paul said I
[56:48] speak more in tongues than any of you he
[56:51] says I thank God that I do and he has
[56:53] Faith to do all these things he's a
[56:55] prophet he has all these gifts in his
[56:57] life and he says without love I'm
[56:59] nothing so he's speaking from a place of
[57:02] possession now and he still says even
[57:04] all these things even though I possess
[57:07] them it's nothing without that love and
[57:10] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[57:12] poor and though I give my body to be
[57:14] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[57:15] me nothing right all your good works add
[57:18] up to nothing without the love am
[57:21] because there's going to be a lot of
[57:22] people with good works come up in the
[57:23] end and it may not be enough that's
[57:25] right brother Braham says' look at 1
[57:27] Corinthians 13 He says how would you
[57:29] interpret it as love for though I have
[57:31] all these fine gifts Paul said though I
[57:33] give my body to be burned a sacrifice
[57:35] for the Lord Jesus Christ though I give
[57:37] all my goods to feed the poor and
[57:39] everything isn't that love Mother Teresa
[57:43] look at Mother Teresa gives everything
[57:45] these nuns and these people that go over
[57:47] to Africa and all these different places
[57:49] and the jungles and they they step away
[57:51] from all the Comforts of life he says
[57:54] though I give my body to do it though I
[57:55] give everything I have without this I'm
[57:58] nothing he says isn't that love but
[58:01] that's not Bible love see he says you're
[58:04] talking about natural
[58:06] affection instead of divine revelation
[58:10] of the will of God so he's saying love
[58:13] is a divine revelation of the will of
[58:16] God doing what God would have you to do
[58:19] rather than doing things just because
[58:20] they're good we should do good things no
[58:22] matter what but he's saying when you
[58:24] focus your efforts Let It Be according
[58:26] to the will of God and not according to
[58:28] your own will amen you see an element of
[58:31] this right this this ability to go
[58:33] through great trials and great suffering
[58:35] and Jesus own last few days amen he's
[58:37] going through the trials he's going
[58:39] through the whipping he's standing there
[58:40] being falsely accused and he opens up
[58:42] not his mouth he takes the beating he
[58:45] takes the spitting he takes the crown of
[58:46] thorns he takes the cross itself in the
[58:48] end and he opens up his mouth he doesn't
[58:51] open up his mouth does he he stands
[58:53] there and lets them do their worst why
[58:54] because of a divine revelation of the
[58:56] will of God for him so you can go
[58:59] through great things you can give your
[59:00] body as a sacrifice you can give up all
[59:02] things and it can be in the will of God
[59:04] but don't do that and then say because
[59:05] of that I'm going to heaven he's saying
[59:08] you no you got to find the will of God
[59:10] for your life to do this amen amen what
[59:13] was it Jesus was accountable to the word
[59:15] of God and what he went through he went
[59:17] through because the word said he had to
[59:19] go through it and that's the only reason
[59:21] why otherwise as we know many times in
[59:23] his life they went to Stone him and he
[59:24] just walked right through the crowds he
[59:26] disappeared why wasn't God's time but
[59:29] when the time came he went through it
[59:31] and that's only the time that we're
[59:32] looking for amen we don't want to suffer
[59:34] for no good reason brother Braham
[59:37] continues he says though I give my body
[59:39] to be burned as a sacrifice and have not
[59:41] love I'm nothing though I give all my
[59:43] goods to feed the poor I'm still nothing
[59:45] I have faith to move mountains I'm still
[59:47] nothing I speak with tongues as men and
[59:49] angels and I'm still nothing see it's
[59:51] that still Small Voice that speaks down
[59:54] in your heart that changes every
[59:56] attitude makes the nature different and
[59:59] you become a new creature in Christ amen
[1:00:02] we've covered this again a lot in the
[1:00:03] last few days where the holy spirit
[1:00:05] inside of you brings a change in your
[1:00:07] nature brings a change in your attitude
[1:00:09] brings your senses subject to the word
[1:00:11] of God and then from there Christ can
[1:00:13] live through you
[1:00:16] amen continuing the Scripture it says
[1:00:18] charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:00:20] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:00:23] itself and is not puffed up brother
[1:00:26] Braham said an arrogant spirit is never
[1:00:28] the holy spirit amen end of story verse
[1:00:32] five says do not behave itself unseemly
[1:00:34] that means it's not
[1:00:35] conceited seeketh not her own means it
[1:00:39] doesn't insist on your rights not just
[1:00:40] isn't selfish but doesn't insist on your
[1:00:43] own
[1:00:44] rights is not easily provoked so it's
[1:00:47] not touchy or
[1:00:49] resentful thinketh no
[1:00:51] evil that means it doesn't pay attention
[1:00:54] when it is wronged
[1:00:57] how often do we do that this is rubber
[1:01:00] meets the road folks thinketh no evil
[1:01:03] means it doesn't pay attention when it
[1:01:05] is wronged it moves past it verse six
[1:01:08] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices
[1:01:11] in the truth it means it doesn't rejoice
[1:01:13] in Injustice but rather rejoices when
[1:01:15] truth and right Prevail amen it beareth
[1:01:19] all things that means it can handle
[1:01:21] anything charity God's love the love of
[1:01:24] God agapo love can hand handle anything
[1:01:28] anything it believes all things that
[1:01:30] means it believes the best for every
[1:01:33] person and
[1:01:36] situation hopeth all things endureth all
[1:01:39] things it means it endures all things
[1:01:41] without
[1:01:45] weakening charity never faileth but
[1:01:49] whether there be prophecies they shall
[1:01:51] fail now that doesn't mean they'll be
[1:01:53] wrong it means they'll come to a pass
[1:01:55] pass and end right there's a finishing
[1:01:58] to a time of Prophecy we've got
[1:02:00] everything we need for the for the bride
[1:02:02] right now amen there's no other Prophet
[1:02:04] coming prophecy has come to an end
[1:02:06] doesn't mean that prophecy the gift of
[1:02:07] Prophecy isn't still in the church but
[1:02:09] rather it's a done deal amen it's sealed
[1:02:12] right the the plan for the Gentiles is
[1:02:15] over God's revealed to us what he's
[1:02:16] going to do and there's a time for that
[1:02:18] to enden the gifts can stay there but
[1:02:21] prophecy has ended the prophet has
[1:02:22] spoken in our age and that's it it's
[1:02:24] done there's no adding to it anymore
[1:02:28] whether there be tongues they'll cease
[1:02:31] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:02:33] vanish away for we know in part and we
[1:02:37] prophesy in part now Paul says we don't
[1:02:40] know
[1:02:40] everything at his time he says we don't
[1:02:42] know everything so we only speak the
[1:02:44] little bit that God gives us the little
[1:02:46] bit that God shows us is what we share
[1:02:47] with you amen so Paul's listed a bunch
[1:02:50] of things here right he's talked about
[1:02:52] prophecy he's talked about moving
[1:02:53] mountains he's talked about giving this
[1:02:55] and doing that and everything and if you
[1:02:56] went to a lot of churches today they'd
[1:02:58] say if we didn't have that in our
[1:03:00] services if we didn't have tongues
[1:03:01] interpretation if we didn't have this
[1:03:03] ministry or that one or this thing or
[1:03:04] that thing happening we'd say God has
[1:03:06] left us but Paul points to all of this
[1:03:08] which Paul had by the way and says we
[1:03:11] know in part and we prophesy in part
[1:03:14] this is all just a temporary thing this
[1:03:17] is not it this is just a part that's
[1:03:20] leading us up to something
[1:03:22] amen verse 10 though says but when that
[1:03:25] that which is perfect is come then that
[1:03:28] which is part shall be done away so he
[1:03:30] says when the fullness comes when the
[1:03:32] maturity comes when the full creation is
[1:03:35] done then that which is in part is it's
[1:03:38] put to the
[1:03:40] side so Paul's pointing again to a
[1:03:42] things where those things end or ra
[1:03:45] rather they have no effect they've
[1:03:47] they've gone past their due date amen
[1:03:48] there's no need for them anymore because
[1:03:50] something has happened because something
[1:03:52] has occurred and you don't need them
[1:03:54] anymore the fullness is there in the
[1:03:56] Amplified it says but when the complete
[1:04:00] and perfect total comes the incomplete
[1:04:04] and imperfect will vanish away become
[1:04:07] Antiquated void and
[1:04:10] superseded it's pointing to a day where
[1:04:12] things pass away and we become a new
[1:04:14] creature amen where we have everything
[1:04:16] that God has promised for us Amen
[1:04:18] brother Bram said this he said for where
[1:04:20] there's tongues they'll cease where
[1:04:21] there's prophecies it shall fail where
[1:04:23] there is all these other things will
[1:04:25] fail but when that which is perfect is
[1:04:27] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:04:29] away with see that perfect what is
[1:04:32] perfect love what is love God lay it let
[1:04:37] us lay aside all these little dead works
[1:04:39] and ordinances and go on to Perfection
[1:04:42] he says you see it we are perfected
[1:04:44] through Christ and how do we get into it
[1:04:47] by Holy Spirit baptism
[1:04:51] am like I said earlier we saw that
[1:04:53] happen in Pentecostal in the early 1900s
[1:04:56] was they came to a place God was moving
[1:04:59] he had the isua Street Revival and they
[1:05:00] got the Holy Ghost people that receive
[1:05:03] the Holy Ghost and those are a part of
[1:05:05] the Bride they were recognizing the word
[1:05:07] for their day they were recognizing the
[1:05:08] moving of God for their day but there
[1:05:10] came a point where they stayed there and
[1:05:12] did not move on into the Perfection of
[1:05:14] the opening of the word there was a time
[1:05:16] where that was accepted but then there
[1:05:18] was a time where ignorance was pulled
[1:05:19] away at the revealing of the word and
[1:05:21] they said we don't want anything to do
[1:05:22] with it and that's where they sealed
[1:05:23] themselves into damnation amen that's
[1:05:26] right but what do we have we had a
[1:05:28] Prophet come in and he was pulling
[1:05:29] people now out of those denominations to
[1:05:31] form a multi-member bride from every
[1:05:33] tongue and every nation every
[1:05:35] denomination pulled them from anywhere
[1:05:36] and everywhere to make them into what
[1:05:39] the word of God for their
[1:05:41] day brother Braham says this in
[1:05:43] questions and answers he said First
[1:05:44] Corinthians says this when that which is
[1:05:47] perfect is come that which is in part
[1:05:48] shall be done away with so all these
[1:05:51] little things of jumping up and down
[1:05:52] like a kid trying to talk in tongues and
[1:05:54] all those other things when that which
[1:05:56] is perfect and we do have today by God's
[1:06:00] help the perfect interpretation of the
[1:06:04] word with Divine
[1:06:07] Vindication then that which is in part
[1:06:10] is done away with when I was a child I
[1:06:12] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:06:14] but when I became a man I put away
[1:06:16] childish things he says amen I go to
[1:06:18] preaching and then I don't get to these
[1:06:19] other things so brother Braham says look
[1:06:22] we are at that place today and he point
[1:06:25] points back and he says we have the
[1:06:26] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:06:29] Divine Vindication why because God
[1:06:30] brought the word right he brings the
[1:06:32] opening of the seals he ties up all
[1:06:34] these loose knots all these and pulls
[1:06:36] things apart that have been scrambled up
[1:06:38] by men through all the different ages he
[1:06:39] pulls it apart reassembles it into
[1:06:41] Perfection right gives us an
[1:06:43] understanding sets us up with a proper
[1:06:45] structure of the word and then he comes
[1:06:47] behind it with every sign and wonder
[1:06:49] that you could ever ask every sign of
[1:06:51] Wonder you could ever ask we're talking
[1:06:53] about eyes being created in a person's
[1:06:55] empty sockets we're talking about limbs
[1:06:57] being restored we're talking about the
[1:06:58] dead being healed we're talking about uh
[1:07:01] uh discernment of the thoughts and
[1:07:02] intents of the heart without touching
[1:07:04] anyone without looking at them even
[1:07:06] every Vindication you could expect and
[1:07:08] he says that which is perfect is here
[1:07:11] now because God has given it and
[1:07:13] Vindicated it and then after this he
[1:07:15] says it'd be a sin to disbelieve right
[1:07:18] that's where we're at he says the
[1:07:19] perfect is here right
[1:07:21] now and there's nothing left but the
[1:07:23] Rapture amen when that which just
[1:07:25] perfect is here then we see as we are we
[1:07:27] are known as we are known amen there's a
[1:07:30] time where we recognize who and what we
[1:07:31] are and then the Rapture takes us
[1:07:33] away continue the Scripture it says when
[1:07:36] I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:07:38] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:07:39] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:07:41] childish things amen so what he's saying
[1:07:44] is all these things are considered
[1:07:45] childish compared to the Perfection of a
[1:07:48] divinely inspired word a fully revealed
[1:07:50] word he says all of this is fine but
[1:07:52] it's childish compared to the Perfection
[1:07:54] that's here already for now we see
[1:07:56] through a glass Darkly but then when
[1:07:59] that which is perfect is come we will be
[1:08:01] face to face now I know in part but then
[1:08:04] when that which is perfect is come shall
[1:08:06] I know even as also I am known and he
[1:08:10] finishes he says and now abideth faith
[1:08:12] hope and charity these three but the
[1:08:15] greatest of these is charity and again
[1:08:17] that word in the Greek is ad agapo that
[1:08:19] is God's love and you can only have that
[1:08:21] if you have God himself amen
[1:08:25] it's a it's a higher it's higher than
[1:08:28] the than the the OS the sensual love
[1:08:30] it's higher than the filio the the the
[1:08:32] natural love that we have for you know a
[1:08:34] spouse and our children these different
[1:08:35] things and brother Braham says that love
[1:08:37] is the holy spirit it's got to be the
[1:08:40] holy spirit amen the only way you can
[1:08:42] have this kind of maturity the only way
[1:08:43] you can have the kind of perfection he's
[1:08:45] talking about is if you have the Holy
[1:08:47] Spirit and you can't impersonate it you
[1:08:49] can impersonate it but you can't
[1:08:50] impersonate it successfully because it's
[1:08:52] going to make its fruit known that's
[1:08:54] what we're talking about the final
[1:08:55] Harvest when push comes to shove you'll
[1:08:57] fall because you don't have it or you'll
[1:08:59] stand because you do have it and Christ
[1:09:01] will be living through you and and
[1:09:02] bringing himself out in the way that is
[1:09:04] required in this end time age brother BR
[1:09:07] says agapo Love Is The Love that's God's
[1:09:09] love filio love is the love that you
[1:09:11] have for your wife or your friend now
[1:09:13] many times the church gets that mixed up
[1:09:15] and they try to apply filio love which
[1:09:16] means friendship to be like aapo love
[1:09:19] but here's the
[1:09:20] difference here's a challenge Brothers
[1:09:23] if you love your wife as you should and
[1:09:25] some man would insult your wife you'd
[1:09:27] kill him because you'd be jealous of her
[1:09:29] killing's a little harsh
[1:09:31] maybe but what would filio love lead to
[1:09:35] that's what filio love would lead to but
[1:09:37] agapo love will make you pray for his
[1:09:39] lost soul that's the difference so
[1:09:43] somebody does something wrong to
[1:09:44] somebody you love and he says the
[1:09:47] reaction of agapo love is to pray for
[1:09:49] that
[1:09:51] person that's the
[1:09:53] difference that's a tough standard isn't
[1:09:56] it I'd rather to have somebody insult me
[1:09:58] than insult my wife most of us would or
[1:10:01] your children you know situations like
[1:10:03] that or your mom or your dad you'd
[1:10:05] rather they came at you than go after
[1:10:06] those that you love you can maybe absorb
[1:10:08] it a little easier but we don't tend to
[1:10:09] do very well when somebody's working on
[1:10:11] somebody else that we love amen that's
[1:10:12] right I think many times we'd punch him
[1:10:15] out and then pray for his lost soul
[1:10:16] wouldn't we wouldn't
[1:10:18] we yeah but we're talking about
[1:10:20] supernatural love now we're talking
[1:10:22] about a higher plane of love we're
[1:10:24] talking about some something that's
[1:10:25] greater than you could ever imagine
[1:10:27] before you got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:30] amen so that's all to set the foundation
[1:10:32] this morning now I want to share the
[1:10:33] story of what happened and why we been
[1:10:36] what we've been building up to and then
[1:10:37] we'll take it all the way to its its
[1:10:39] conclusion so I was driving down Cherry
[1:10:40] Lane the other day now Cherry Lane is
[1:10:42] the road the main road that leads down
[1:10:43] to our house if you've driven it you
[1:10:45] know that there's a couple things about
[1:10:46] it that can make it a little bit
[1:10:48] dangerous it's very
[1:10:50] windy it has up and down so you have
[1:10:52] hidden traffic coming and going you have
[1:10:54] people walking on there's no shoulders
[1:10:56] and there's no sidewalks and now with
[1:10:58] the snow on it there's sections or there
[1:10:59] were sections until the warmer weather
[1:11:01] came where the snow's built up so you
[1:11:03] can't even see around the corners and so
[1:11:05] you don't know who's coming you don't
[1:11:07] know where they are you don't know
[1:11:08] what's awaiting you right so there's a
[1:11:10] lot of blind spots in there and I've
[1:11:11] learned to Drive slowly on the road
[1:11:13] because of that I've seen what can
[1:11:15] happen when you drive quickly on that
[1:11:16] road and it's never going to be a good
[1:11:17] situation amen so as I came to literally
[1:11:20] the first curve I slowed down and I had
[1:11:23] my head way to the left trying to see
[1:11:24] around it to see if there's anybody
[1:11:26] waiting for me and as I got to that
[1:11:28] curve an old lady zoomed right through
[1:11:29] the middle of the curve didn't stay on
[1:11:32] her side just came right through the
[1:11:33] middle of the Cur and I slammed on my
[1:11:35] brakes and she zipped past and continued
[1:11:37] on her Merry way all right so I was able
[1:11:40] to stop I kept all the way over on the
[1:11:42] right hand side real tight and she just
[1:11:44] zipped past the front of my bumper and
[1:11:46] and that was that you know and if she
[1:11:48] continued driving like that I think I
[1:11:50] kind of feel like I was one of job
[1:11:52] servants and I alone am alive you know
[1:11:55] to tell you what happened here but she
[1:11:56] just she didn't even blink she just
[1:11:58] continued on right just completely
[1:12:00] oblivious to what happened amen
[1:12:03] now I'm an experienced
[1:12:05] driver I'm not always a mature driver
[1:12:09] and typically in a situation like that
[1:12:11] I'd probably mutter something or yell
[1:12:13] something in my car towards that person
[1:12:15] that was highly uncomplimentary of their
[1:12:17] driving skills right that's the natural
[1:12:19] way to do
[1:12:21] it let me stop here and say this one I
[1:12:24] didn't do it I just shook my head and
[1:12:25] continued on but I want to stop here and
[1:12:27] say one thing and that's that if an
[1:12:29] accident had occurred it was not my
[1:12:32] fault I did nothing wrong there she was
[1:12:35] in my Lane she was driving too fast she
[1:12:37] was cutting the corner she wasn't
[1:12:38] driving according to the road conditions
[1:12:40] it was all on her if an accident
[1:12:42] happened it was going to absolutely be
[1:12:44] her fault legally okay but as soon as
[1:12:48] that happened the Holy Spirit dropped
[1:12:49] down into that car and it's was like he
[1:12:51] lit a fire in that car at that exact
[1:12:53] moment and he started talking to me
[1:12:54] about what just
[1:12:56] happened and he said the accident didn't
[1:12:59] happen and it's not because she did
[1:13:01] anything right he said the accident was
[1:13:05] avoided because you were an experienced
[1:13:08] driver you've been down this road
[1:13:11] before you knew the pitfalls of the road
[1:13:15] you knew the attitudes of drivers there
[1:13:17] You' experienced this sort of thing
[1:13:19] before so you prepared for it you were
[1:13:21] expecting it and because you knew all
[1:13:24] these things because you were
[1:13:25] experienced in this road that you're on
[1:13:27] that's the reason that this didn't
[1:13:29] happen amen I was on that road with an
[1:13:32] understanding that I was not just going
[1:13:33] home but that I could potentially be
[1:13:35] faced with somebody that was going to
[1:13:36] wreck my car and on that basis I went
[1:13:39] down that road with a full knowledge
[1:13:41] that something could happen and I needed
[1:13:43] to be aware for it I need to be driving
[1:13:45] defensively to make sure that something
[1:13:47] didn't happen to the best of my ability
[1:13:49] amen so when the near accident happened
[1:13:52] I was ready for it I was driving slowly
[1:13:54] I was tight in my Lane I was looking
[1:13:56] around the corner I was ready with the
[1:13:58] brakes and so as soon as that thing
[1:14:00] started to happen what happened I
[1:14:02] reacted and the Holy Spirit said this is
[1:14:05] what a mature believer does every day of
[1:14:08] his
[1:14:11] life this is what you're going to face
[1:14:13] day in and day out week in and week out
[1:14:16] year in and year out and I wrote down
[1:14:18] exactly what he said here he said
[1:14:21] maturity is using your strengths
[1:14:24] knowledge
[1:14:25] gifts and experience to make up for the
[1:14:28] lack of those things in somebody
[1:14:31] else so I got home and I had to study
[1:14:33] that out because you never know what
[1:14:36] could be telling you things sometimes
[1:14:37] you know I can have lots of emotions and
[1:14:39] lots of feelings and these different
[1:14:40] things but I had to study it out amen
[1:14:42] but he said that maturity is using your
[1:14:44] strengths knowledge gifts and experience
[1:14:46] to make up for the lack of those things
[1:14:48] in somebody else and we've been talking
[1:14:49] a lot about love this morning and this
[1:14:51] is what it is amen so I went home and I
[1:14:53] read about charity in first Corinthians
[1:14:55] 13 how it doesn't rise up how it doesn't
[1:14:57] react maliciously how it looks for the
[1:14:59] best in people how it endures and I knew
[1:15:01] that that was God speaking to me and
[1:15:03] then he started to say to me he starts
[1:15:05] opening up different situations and he
[1:15:06] says are you acting like a mature
[1:15:08] believer like I just told you right are
[1:15:11] you using your maturity to compensate
[1:15:13] for the weakness of somebody else are
[1:15:15] you using your maturity to allow
[1:15:17] somebody else to live another day and
[1:15:19] grow a little
[1:15:20] more how often are you the enduring one
[1:15:25] or are you insisting on your rights are
[1:15:28] you insisting on talking about that
[1:15:29] person are you talking about their
[1:15:31] problem rather than using your gift or
[1:15:33] your strength to make up the difference
[1:15:35] is your pride rising up instead of
[1:15:38] conquering love that was a real
[1:15:40] challenge for me amen sometimes what are
[1:15:42] we doing we're standing on our high
[1:15:44] horse of maturity and we're looking down
[1:15:46] our noses at people that don't have the
[1:15:48] thing that we have and what is it we say
[1:15:50] I know they have the Holy Ghost so I
[1:15:52] should be able to expect this reaction I
[1:15:54] should be able to expect this sort of uh
[1:15:57] of life from them and I'm not getting it
[1:15:59] so I get to hold them up to the word and
[1:16:01] say that they're lacking but that's not
[1:16:04] what we've been reading all about in the
[1:16:06] scriptures right doesn't mean that we
[1:16:08] hold them up brother Bram says if you
[1:16:09] see somebody do something wrong what do
[1:16:10] you do you pray for them right but in
[1:16:13] the meantime it says charity endures all
[1:16:16] things it endures all things without
[1:16:18] weakness without
[1:16:20] failing amen so the question now became
[1:16:23] not with what do you have because so
[1:16:25] often when we're looking at this topic
[1:16:26] of the final Harvest and the Royal seed
[1:16:28] and a Rapture Ready bride we're looking
[1:16:30] at ourselves and we're saying I've got
[1:16:32] it or we're saying what do I have but
[1:16:34] now it comes down to not just what do
[1:16:36] you have but how are you using it amen
[1:16:38] what is God using it for in the body to
[1:16:40] support those that don't have the very
[1:16:42] thing that you have because here's the
[1:16:44] thing we're not all the
[1:16:47] same every one of us is not the same we
[1:16:50] have the Holy Ghost but we're not built
[1:16:51] the same way we don't have the same
[1:16:53] Outlook we don't have the same
[1:16:54] preference we don't have the same
[1:16:55] spouses we don't have the same way of
[1:16:58] going about our lives we don't have the
[1:16:59] same jobs we don't have the same
[1:17:01] intellect we don't have the same
[1:17:02] physical features none of these things
[1:17:04] we're very different amen and each one
[1:17:07] of us is given for a purpose and so when
[1:17:09] you look at something like this
[1:17:11] happening we have these high
[1:17:12] expectations and we say I should be able
[1:17:15] to get more out of them than I'm getting
[1:17:17] but the point is God's given you a
[1:17:19] strength to make up for their weakness
[1:17:21] right God's given you a way of doing
[1:17:23] things that covers that up for them that
[1:17:25] supports them and they may never be that
[1:17:27] strong in that area because they're not
[1:17:29] called to you're strong in that area
[1:17:31] because you're that part of the body am
[1:17:33] man if you're going to lift something
[1:17:34] you need strong legs and a strong back
[1:17:36] you don't care too much about how good
[1:17:38] your ears are when you're lifting
[1:17:39] something heavy so when you're dealing
[1:17:40] with an ear in a heavy lifting situation
[1:17:42] don't expect it to be super strong it's
[1:17:44] not meant for that it's meant for
[1:17:46] hearing right but sometimes we look at
[1:17:49] someone and because we're so strong
[1:17:50] there we say they need to be as strong
[1:17:52] as me that's not what the scripture says
[1:17:55] we'll get into it we'll get right into
[1:17:56] it in the word here we'll lock it
[1:17:59] down amen we're supposed to be helping
[1:18:01] to make them a better Christian amen
[1:18:03] we've got to give them space to
[1:18:05] become a new creature in Christ to grow
[1:18:07] more into the stature of a perfect man
[1:18:09] James 5:116 says confess your faults one
[1:18:12] to another and pray for one another that
[1:18:14] ye may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:18:17] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:18:19] the scripture doesn't say confess the
[1:18:21] other person's faults to them or others
[1:18:25] go to Joe and say brother Joe you're too
[1:18:28] impulsive let me tell you about how
[1:18:30] impulsive you are right why his strength
[1:18:35] is that spontaneity that ability to work
[1:18:37] with people quickly and get into things
[1:18:39] same thing that gets them into trouble
[1:18:41] my wife said my greatest strength is
[1:18:43] that I never change my greatest weakness
[1:18:45] is that I never change right remember
[1:18:47] when we were at our house we were
[1:18:48] talking about the different attributes
[1:18:49] of the people in the room and we kind of
[1:18:51] were trying to sum it up in one word and
[1:18:52] the one they picked for me was
[1:18:53] unwavering
[1:18:55] which is great if you're if you're
[1:18:56] wondering about where I'm going to stand
[1:18:58] when the word comes up not so good when
[1:19:01] you're talking about paint in the house
[1:19:04] if I don't like it I'm not going to
[1:19:05] change am I you don't want to be
[1:19:07] unwavering in all things that strength
[1:19:09] is also your weakness and so you've got
[1:19:11] to balance that out and if you look at
[1:19:12] your spouse most often they're balancing
[1:19:14] out where you're weak that's why God
[1:19:16] gave them to you is they bolster you
[1:19:17] where you're weak and they bolster you
[1:19:19] you bolster them or their weak as well
[1:19:21] amen so we don't go around confessing
[1:19:23] another person's faults to them or
[1:19:24] others but rather it says pray for one
[1:19:26] another you go in a spirit of humility
[1:19:28] and you share your weaknesses and where
[1:19:30] you have what growth where you need
[1:19:33] growth in your life and you talk that
[1:19:35] over with somebody and then all of a
[1:19:37] sudden now an honest conversation
[1:19:38] happens because they know that you're
[1:19:40] not there to attack you're not there to
[1:19:42] put them down you're not on some high
[1:19:43] horse and now all of a sudden you start
[1:19:45] to get into fellowship and it turns into
[1:19:46] a prayer meeting that's what James says
[1:19:48] turns into a prayer meeting and says the
[1:19:50] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:19:52] man avails much it means it does a lot
[1:19:54] it's very effective amen amen when
[1:19:57] you're in the Ivory Tower of your of
[1:19:58] your own righteousness you're pretty
[1:20:00] much useless to the body you know what
[1:20:02] and you're fixing for a tumble that's
[1:20:03] what's going to happen amen like me in
[1:20:05] my car it would do me no good to be
[1:20:08] sitting there in my wrecked car that got
[1:20:09] smashed by an old lady that didn't know
[1:20:11] how to drive saying I'm right but yet
[1:20:14] that's where we stand so many times as
[1:20:16] we stand there and say according to the
[1:20:18] word I am right and there's a wreck
[1:20:19] that's happening all around us and we're
[1:20:21] so happy to be right that we're not
[1:20:23] worried about the damage that's being
[1:20:24] caused
[1:20:25] right rather than trying to stop the
[1:20:27] damage we're trying to stay in the I'm
[1:20:29] right place right I much rather say I
[1:20:32] avoided that and my car is in one piece
[1:20:34] then sit there and say yeah we had a
[1:20:36] wreck but she came on my territory and I
[1:20:38] stood my place and she hit me and she
[1:20:40] wrecked my car I'd rather my car just
[1:20:41] stay the way it is now you know amen we
[1:20:44] want to get to a place where our initial
[1:20:46] reaction is what Grace not judgment and
[1:20:49] not fault finding amen let's clinch this
[1:20:52] down as we continue now first Peter 4
[1:20:55] says and above all things have fervent
[1:20:57] charity among
[1:20:58] yourselves fervent charity
[1:21:02] hot
[1:21:03] boiling right this is not just a little
[1:21:06] campfire this is a white hot torch of
[1:21:09] love he says for charity shall cover the
[1:21:15] multitude of
[1:21:17] sins it says use Hospitality one to
[1:21:19] another without grudging what's
[1:21:21] Hospitality that's when you have
[1:21:23] somebody else over isn't it that's where
[1:21:24] you serve that's where you give of your
[1:21:26] goodness and what God has blessed you
[1:21:28] with for their betterment you're serving
[1:21:31] rather than receiving your giving what
[1:21:33] you have to others right this is not
[1:21:35] just natural this is spiritual now verse
[1:21:37] 10 says as every man ha received the
[1:21:40] gift even so Minister the same one to
[1:21:42] another as good stewards of the manifold
[1:21:45] grace of God and says there that that
[1:21:48] love covers a multitude of sins how many
[1:21:50] times they ask Jesus how many times do
[1:21:53] we forgive my brother how many times do
[1:21:55] I forgive brother Bob 70 time 7 that's
[1:21:58] 490 chances are you're not going to
[1:22:00] count to 490 and his point was do it
[1:22:03] until you can't even remember how many
[1:22:05] times it's been done keep doing it keep
[1:22:07] doing it keep doing it why because
[1:22:09] charity covers love covers a multitude
[1:22:11] of sins right and it endureth all things
[1:22:14] and it never
[1:22:15] fails the Amplified for verse eight says
[1:22:18] above all things have intense and
[1:22:21] unfailing love one for another for love
[1:22:23] covers a multip multitude of sins in
[1:22:26] other words it forgives and disregards
[1:22:28] the offenses of
[1:22:31] others amen the last verse verse 10 says
[1:22:33] that we have received gifts and because
[1:22:36] we have received the gifts of God in
[1:22:37] many ways and it's all Grace to us we're
[1:22:40] told to employ them in the same Grace
[1:22:42] now to those that are around us amplifi
[1:22:45] verse 10 says as each of you has
[1:22:46] received a gift which is a particular
[1:22:49] spiritual Talent a gracious Divine
[1:22:52] endowment employ it for one another as
[1:22:54] befits good Trustees of God's many
[1:22:57] sighted Grace as faithful stewards of
[1:23:00] the extremely diverse gifts and powers
[1:23:03] granted to
[1:23:05] Christians because you warranted it no
[1:23:09] by unmerited
[1:23:11] favor amen you have a gift he's saying
[1:23:15] use it for the betterment of the body
[1:23:18] he's saying apply it use it hospitably
[1:23:20] amen share it with those be a giver not
[1:23:23] a taker right if you've got a gift of
[1:23:25] patience the very people you should be
[1:23:27] patient with most are going to be
[1:23:28] Believers amen use it in the body to
[1:23:31] play the long game
[1:23:33] enduring holding on to situations
[1:23:35] keeping people in prayer when you see
[1:23:37] shortness you know in their walk with
[1:23:39] God when a situation doesn't go the way
[1:23:41] you want to say Lord I'm holding them up
[1:23:43] in prayer I'm not going to get offended
[1:23:45] I'm going to hold them in prayer and I'm
[1:23:46] going to be strong until they come
[1:23:48] around and that also keeps you in a
[1:23:50] place of humility so that if you need to
[1:23:52] do some coming around then God will work
[1:23:54] on that that way as well
[1:23:55] amen am then you have a gift of
[1:23:57] perception and you know how people react
[1:23:59] and what triggers them in these
[1:24:00] different things what do you do you use
[1:24:02] that not to push people's buttons but
[1:24:04] rather you use it to avoid those buttons
[1:24:06] so that you can be a goet so that you
[1:24:08] can be a help so that you can have the
[1:24:10] hard conversations so that you can have
[1:24:12] real Fellowship without causing them an
[1:24:14] offense in doing so amen because what
[1:24:16] we'll have is we'll have P perceivers
[1:24:18] standing here and they can see all the
[1:24:19] things that are happening or the
[1:24:20] potential troubles but they're in a
[1:24:22] place of self-righteousness and so all
[1:24:23] they do is they go and tell people
[1:24:24] you're doing this wrong you're doing
[1:24:25] this wrong you're doing this wrong but
[1:24:27] they don't have the attitude of Grace to
[1:24:28] go with it to make it easy to receive
[1:24:30] they end up offending that person rather
[1:24:32] than helping them amen so what is he
[1:24:34] saying don't stand on your gift and Lord
[1:24:36] over people but rather use it to support
[1:24:39] them and grow them in Christ amen share
[1:24:41] it with them put it to good use remember
[1:24:43] the the parable of the of the servants
[1:24:44] and he gave one of them 10 and one of
[1:24:46] them five and one of them one or two and
[1:24:49] one of them went and he doubled it right
[1:24:51] five went to 10 I think two went to five
[1:24:53] but the one that had one he bar it in a
[1:24:54] nap he put it in a napkin and buried it
[1:24:56] in the ground he didn't use what God
[1:24:58] gave him right and that's the one that
[1:25:01] got cast into outer Darkness wasn't it
[1:25:04] God's given so many gifts to us here so
[1:25:06] many gifts I can't believe how many
[1:25:07] gifts we have in a small church but the
[1:25:09] thing that comes up with those gift off
[1:25:11] times is that it causes friction with
[1:25:12] somebody that doesn't have the same gift
[1:25:14] because you can't escape it in a smaller
[1:25:15] Church you can't escape these things
[1:25:17] we're so close together and that's great
[1:25:19] when it's great but it's not so great
[1:25:20] when it's not so great you know it's
[1:25:23] like it I mean look at it look at your
[1:25:25] own marriages look at your own family
[1:25:26] we're in a a lockdown here and so we're
[1:25:28] stuck in a house with our whole families
[1:25:31] 24/7 there's no breaks from each other
[1:25:33] is there unless you go outside for a
[1:25:34] walk or something like that we're with
[1:25:36] each other 24/7 and what does that do it
[1:25:38] highlights the
[1:25:40] differences and it brings friction and
[1:25:43] what Paul's saying here is it should be
[1:25:44] highlighting the love that God has given
[1:25:47] us in our hearts and souls and that's
[1:25:49] what should be reaching out in these
[1:25:50] situations not frustration right not
[1:25:53] disappoint
[1:25:55] right we're not supposed to be
[1:25:56] highlighting those things but rather
[1:25:57] we're supposed to be supporting the
[1:25:58] weakness of the other and bringing
[1:26:00] Christ through it all
[1:26:01] amen so when your strength meets their
[1:26:03] weakness what should it do it's always a
[1:26:06] support and never a weapon right if
[1:26:08] they're going to use a weapon use it on
[1:26:10] the ones outside of the body amen not
[1:26:12] the ones inside of the body brother Bram
[1:26:15] says this now surely after all these
[1:26:16] years on the field and around the world
[1:26:18] and seeing different people I ought to
[1:26:20] know a little bit about the gate to
[1:26:21] enter in at this is from the message
[1:26:23] straight As the gate he says and if you
[1:26:24] want to get somewhere with God never let
[1:26:26] an arrogant Spirit ever come around you
[1:26:29] don't let No Malice come in no matter
[1:26:31] what anybody does if they are wrong
[1:26:34] don't you never build up a complex
[1:26:36] against that person see you be sweet and
[1:26:40] kind hard to do when you've got a
[1:26:43] complex right that's why we need
[1:26:45] Supernatural love remember God loved you
[1:26:49] when you were in sin and if the spirit
[1:26:51] of God is in you you love the other
[1:26:53] person when he's in wrong see just pray
[1:26:56] for them and love one another and then
[1:27:00] without that you're still a child in
[1:27:01] God's eyes that's what Paul was saying
[1:27:03] remember when I was a child I spake as a
[1:27:04] child and did all these things as a
[1:27:05] child but when this came I put away
[1:27:07] childish things right you have nothing
[1:27:11] until you have this
[1:27:12] love 1 John
[1:27:15] 4 says we are of God he that knoweth God
[1:27:19] heareth us he that is not of God heareth
[1:27:21] us not hereby know we are the spirit of
[1:27:23] Truth and the spirit of error beloved
[1:27:26] let us love one another for love is of
[1:27:28] God and everyone that loveth is born of
[1:27:31] God and knoweth God he that loveth not
[1:27:34] knoweth not God for God is
[1:27:37] love in this was manifested the love of
[1:27:39] God toward us because that God sent his
[1:27:42] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:27:44] might live through him here in is love
[1:27:47] not that we love God but that he loved
[1:27:50] us see it's the other one doing the
[1:27:52] loving right it was was the one that
[1:27:54] brought us to him not we didn't go to
[1:27:56] him he brought us to him that's what the
[1:27:58] love of God does is it brings the one
[1:28:00] that's maybe outside that's weaker
[1:28:02] that's lost that's that's not as strong
[1:28:04] it brings you to them right you draw
[1:28:07] them to you you don't push them away
[1:28:08] because of their weakness it says and he
[1:28:10] sent his son to be the propitiation for
[1:28:12] our sins beloved if God so loved us we
[1:28:16] also ought to love one another no man
[1:28:19] has seen God at any time if we love one
[1:28:22] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[1:28:25] is perfected in us he says no man seen
[1:28:27] God but if you love each other then they
[1:28:29] will see God in
[1:28:30] you verse 16 says and we have known and
[1:28:33] believed the love that God had to us God
[1:28:36] is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:28:39] dwelleth in God and God in him herein is
[1:28:42] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:28:44] boldness in the day of judgment because
[1:28:47] as he is so are we in this world as
[1:28:50] Christ was so are we supposed to be
[1:28:52] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:28:55] love casteth out fear because fear had
[1:28:58] torment he that fearth is not made
[1:29:01] perfect in love right so often that's
[1:29:04] what we're reacting to right so we have
[1:29:06] fear we have fear of rejection we have
[1:29:08] fear of embarrassment Joe and I were
[1:29:10] talked about this yesterday about a
[1:29:11] situation you know with Ravi Zacharias
[1:29:13] many options were given to him many many
[1:29:15] times he was given the option to come
[1:29:17] clean and he didn't why fear fear of the
[1:29:20] embarrassment fear of loss of influence
[1:29:22] fear of loss of uh uh employment and
[1:29:24] income and and these different things
[1:29:26] fear falling in the people's eyes and
[1:29:28] that was worth more to him in the end
[1:29:29] than coming clean and getting delivered
[1:29:31] from something like that amen that's
[1:29:33] what we don't want and perfect love will
[1:29:35] push us through that to get us to do the
[1:29:36] harder work yes share a bit of that in
[1:29:39] the
[1:29:40] end verse 35 or 19 sorry we love him
[1:29:44] because he first loved us if a man say I
[1:29:47] love God and hateth his brother he is a
[1:29:49] liar for he that loveth not his brother
[1:29:51] whom he ha seen how can he love God whom
[1:29:53] he he had not seen and this commandment
[1:29:56] have we from him that he who loveth God
[1:29:59] love his brother
[1:30:01] also man brother Braham tells a story of
[1:30:03] going story of going beyond the curtain
[1:30:05] of time you know where he saw his first
[1:30:06] wife hope and his daughter and these
[1:30:08] different people and just listen to how
[1:30:10] he finishes this story he says and I
[1:30:12] heard a voice that spoke to me that was
[1:30:13] in the room and said this is what you
[1:30:15] preached was the Holy Ghost we're talked
[1:30:18] about on the other side on the beyond
[1:30:20] the curtain of time in eternity this is
[1:30:23] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[1:30:26] without it I am more determined than
[1:30:28] ever in my life that it takes perfect
[1:30:31] love to enter there there was no
[1:30:33] jealousy there was no tiredness there
[1:30:35] was no death sickness could never enter
[1:30:38] in there mortality could never make you
[1:30:41] old they could not even cry it was just
[1:30:45] one joy and that's what waiting for us
[1:30:48] on the other side we talked in the last
[1:30:50] service about that rest amen the the
[1:30:52] final feast and it started with rest and
[1:30:54] it ended with eternal rest didn't it and
[1:30:56] this is what brother br's poting to this
[1:30:58] is the final portion of that rest and
[1:31:00] this is what it's going to look like in
[1:31:01] eternity Beyond this Veil Amen brother
[1:31:05] Bram says oh my precious friends my
[1:31:07] beloved my darlings of the Gospel my
[1:31:10] begotten children unto God listen to me
[1:31:13] your pastor he's speaking to his bride
[1:31:15] the bride of Christ now I wish there was
[1:31:17] some way I could explain it to you
[1:31:19] there's no words I couldn't find it it's
[1:31:21] not found anywhere but just beyond this
[1:31:23] last last breath is the most glorious
[1:31:25] thing that you ever there is no way to
[1:31:28] explain it there's no way I just can't
[1:31:30] do it but whatever you do friend lay
[1:31:33] aside everything else till you get
[1:31:35] perfect love get to a spot where you can
[1:31:38] love everybody every enemy everything
[1:31:42] else I mean I don't have it here I wrote
[1:31:44] it briefly in my notes or Brea they
[1:31:46] asked Jesus what was the greatest
[1:31:47] commandment he said the first and great
[1:31:49] commandment was love the Lord thy God
[1:31:51] with all thy heart soul and mind then he
[1:31:53] said and the second one is love thy
[1:31:55] neighbor as thyself and he says
[1:31:57] everything you've been taught hangs on
[1:31:59] those two Commandments love God first
[1:32:02] and love your neighbor as yourself amen
[1:32:05] that's it it's literally that simple
[1:32:08] amen what a challenge to us I had a
[1:32:10] challenging week I woke up to a
[1:32:11] challenge this morning I had an email
[1:32:12] waiting for me that I was not
[1:32:14] expecting didn't enjoy it and that was a
[1:32:18] it was literally a direct challenge of
[1:32:20] what I do what I what I'm talking about
[1:32:22] here this morning not from any in this
[1:32:24] church you're all
[1:32:27] good it was waiting for me and it was
[1:32:29] like a slap in the face it was like a
[1:32:30] slap in the face and I and I sat there
[1:32:33] and I struggled and I said Lord what's
[1:32:36] this all about until I got to the place
[1:32:38] where I was praying right because it's
[1:32:41] not easy to do it's not easy to do but
[1:32:44] if you can hold yourself in check right
[1:32:47] wait pray ask the Lord how you'd have
[1:32:51] him how he'd want you to respond now you
[1:32:53] can move on with something something
[1:32:54] right but literally just this morning
[1:32:57] just this morning you don't get to
[1:32:58] preach this kind of thing and not get it
[1:32:59] challenged in your life amen you don't
[1:33:01] get up here and get a free pass God's
[1:33:03] going to require it of me the same as
[1:33:05] the hearer amen none of us gets by amen
[1:33:07] but we want to get to a place where what
[1:33:09] where that Holy Spirit would so fill us
[1:33:11] to that reaction is Grace Grace Grace
[1:33:14] every time where we Overlook to where we
[1:33:16] endure where it's unfailing in our life
[1:33:19] that somebody can go over and over and
[1:33:20] again make the same mistake bother us
[1:33:22] the same way offend us the same way
[1:33:24] disappoint us the same way and we
[1:33:26] forgive forget forgive forget support
[1:33:28] support support and pray pray pray until
[1:33:31] they break through into the victory Amen
[1:33:34] brother Bram said this as we close he
[1:33:36] says I'm more convinced than ever in my
[1:33:37] life that it will take perfect love to
[1:33:40] enter that place there was no jealousy
[1:33:42] no tiredness no sickness no old age no
[1:33:47] death only Supreme Beauty and joy I want
[1:33:51] to ask what would you hold on to here
[1:33:54] that would make you want to miss that
[1:33:56] right what situation what problem what
[1:33:59] relationship what position of your own
[1:34:02] righteousness would you hold on to that
[1:34:03] would go to that would keep you from
[1:34:05] going to a place where there's no
[1:34:06] jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old
[1:34:08] age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:34:10] when you put whatever you're dealing
[1:34:12] with in front of that it pales in
[1:34:14] comparison I can guarantee you whatever
[1:34:16] you do he said lay aside everything else
[1:34:18] until you get perfect love get to where
[1:34:20] you can love everybody even every enemy
[1:34:23] no matter matter if the plan's rocking
[1:34:25] the Lightning's flashing or The Guns of
[1:34:26] the enemy are upon you these things do
[1:34:29] not matter get perfect
[1:34:34] love if you are not saved except Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ as your savior now if you have
[1:34:39] not been baptized in water be baptized
[1:34:42] now if you have not received the baptism
[1:34:44] of the Holy Spirit receive it now press

[1:35:06] said because thou Hast chosen the harder
[1:35:09] way it was of your own choosing a great
[1:35:12] portion of Heaven awaits for you and he
[1:35:13] says this is your victory in the love
[1:35:17] divine man we've got to have that same
[1:35:19] Victory we've got to choose to take the
[1:35:21] harder way what's the harder way way not
[1:35:24] self-righteousness it's to be supportive
[1:35:27] it's to be humble it's to work with
[1:35:29] people Amen to have Grace for people to
[1:35:32] take rest and joy in who we are not in
[1:35:34] how people are reacting at times amen
[1:35:36] what is it that's our victory in the
[1:35:37] love divine when the Holy Spirit has a
