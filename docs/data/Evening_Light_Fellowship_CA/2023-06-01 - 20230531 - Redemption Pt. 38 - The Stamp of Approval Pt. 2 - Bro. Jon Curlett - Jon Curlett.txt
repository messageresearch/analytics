ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen thank you musicians if you will turn in your Bibles to Romans chapter 8 . the men's good to have brother Bob and sister Brenda back with us and they bring brother John and Sister Sarah Graham so it's good to see them it's been a long time for Brother John A Little Less so for Sarah but it's good to see them both amen certainly good to be back and it's good to see some sunshine outside as well amen I just put a couple of small announcements here so I'll be away next week I'll be gone into Ottawa on Wednesday so we'll see what happens for service there I'll sort that out with the deacons but I'll be flying out on Wednesday morning getting back on on Friday afternoon for work purposes so just remember me in prayers I do that and just want to say thanks to those that are helping with sister Betty it's a it's a long hard slog for her and there's people that are there and they're doing that work with her and spending time in the in the hospital and these different things and certainly appreciate each one that's done that that's volunteered and said you know I want to be a part of it I want to help I want to give people a break and whatnot so each one that's doing it we certainly appreciate it and and God bless you for it and that's what makes us a body and then coming in here and sitting under the preaching the word that's the easy part it's when people have needs when people have issues in their life and we get together and we we group around them and we take them before the throne of grace in our prayers yes but then we take our bodies and we take our time and our energy and we put that on the line as well and say that's the Lord's as well amen it's not just our time in here but it's when we go out and help those around us amen God bless you Romans chapter 8 verse 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now don't have verse 19 up there but let's read it he says for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen you can have your seats this evening God bless you and we're going to be continuing Right Along on that that thought of a the stamp of approval that we spoke on last service and we we covered what Christ had to go through and we look at him and last time and we spoke of how he was born the Son of God and yet he had to go through and he had to prove himself and he had to stand up with the word and he didn't have the Holy Ghost at first and then when he pleased God then he got the Holy Ghost by obedience and then after that he had to spend three years and he had to be proved and tested and tried and he had wonderful victories he had wonderful times and and saw God moving through him of course he was the expression of God but yet in all of that he had headaches and he had he had sickness and he had difficulties and he had rejection and he he faced many trials but he had many victories in that as well and we saw that at the end of it he had a mount Transfiguration experience and that's where God said this is my beloved Son and I'm not just pleased with him now but now you can hear him he speaks for me and I'll be silent and and now he's the voice from Heaven to you today and so today we want to kind of move on with that thought and take it from from Christ to us because we read last service the scripture that says that he was the firstborn of among many Brethren so he was the first of all of us and there's more of us to come and so we want to talk about our part and we want to talk about what it looks like to get the stamp of approval if we were going to do it and you know we're preaching on this thought of adoption and and we're going to be talking a bit about the end result today and we're going to talk about what it looks like to be an adopted son or an adopted daughter of God and and kind of the witness that's given of us and you know Sister Delfina graduated uh from from University I believe it was on on Monday maybe it was Tuesday and so she's finished she's done she's she's received her degree and it's a wonderful day and you know she walked across the stage and I'm sure her mother was standing up and giving a big Ovation and people were shouting and hooping and hollering and having a wonderful time but before she got to that place everything that she did in University had to be reviewed and anybody that knows the story with sister delfina's University experience knows that she was supposed to graduate she thought last year because according to her she had done everything that they required to get her degree and she had passy marks and she'd done all the courses but what happened was that they realized that she hadn't done everything that they thought she had done and that it was their mistake but she hadn't done everything and so she had to go back and take just a few more courses to pass amen so they had to review her grades they had to go through and make sure her work and her performance qualified and though she felt she had done it all that she had done all the time she had done all the work she had received the grades she had paid her money she thought she was ready to graduate and yet she couldn't graduate why because she isn't the one that evaluates herself in this graduation she's not the one that determines if she's ready to graduate but rather there's somebody else that's involved with the university that had to go through her entire transcript and say does this meet the requirements does this meet the qualifications to receive the degree that she wants to receive and like I said last year they came back and they said sorry we made a mistake we LED you wrong and you're not ready to graduate and you have to do these couple extra courses that is of course a trial for her because you're expecting you're done and all of a sudden they say you're not done so she's had to deal with those things but my point in all this is that no matter how worthy she was she wasn't ready to graduate because she doesn't the one that chooses how it how she's going to graduate somebody else has to say you have done everything that is required to qualify for this degree and so when we come to this idea of adoption and and we speak about these things it's not us that says when we're ready we put in the work and there's no doubt we're putting in the work and we put in the time and we're obedient to the word and we're growing and we're maturing in all of these things but it's not us that says you're ready for adoption it's got to be somebody else that says it because our analysis of ourselves if we look in the scripture we'll find is usually sorely lacking we tend to think of ourselves higher than we ought to and we rarely see ourselves in the True Light of the word of God unless we've really got the Holy Spirit working in our lives but we look at what brings us even even to church and what causes us to live the life that we do and we know that acts 2 38 is our qualification list Acts 2 38 is the only way you're going to get into heaven you're not going to get into heaven because you identify with this message you're not going to get in because you go to church you're not going to go into it because of who your mother and father are but we have a formula to graduate we have a formula to give us eternal life and that is what you repent now repentance is not what brings us Unity repentance is not what makes us a body yet every one of us must repent and then it says we have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins but baptism is not our Unity there are people out there that are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that are not a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ but there is one thing that makes us a unified body and that is the baptism of the holy spirit that has given us by promise in Acts 2 38 if we sincerely repent and if we're baptized the proper way so our Unity is in the spirit our Unity is not in our baptism our Unity is not just in our Doctrine but it is the holy spirit of God personally in each one of us that makes us a part of the body of Christ and that's what makes us unified even when we don't want to be unified when issues come in between brothers and sisters and relationships and even within the church itself what keeps us a body is the holy spirit it's not because I want to be here all the time or because you want to be here all the time but there's something inside of us that pulls us to that brother and sister regardless of our differences because you can't separate from something that's a part of you there's a Unity that comes by the Holy Spirit and I think the most common thing that brother Branham would quote certainly in the last five years of his ministry is this scripture in First Corinthians 12 13. because this is what levels the playing field this is what levels the playing field whether we're black whether we're white whether we're rich whether we're poor whether we have an education whether we don't whether we're White Collar Blue Collar man or woman it doesn't matter the holy spirit is the thing that equalizes the playing field and First Corinthians 12 13 says for but why what one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and we have been all made to drink into one spirit that is the thing that unites us as the Holy Spirit that's the thing that keeps us coming back here is because we believe the holy spirit is present in this Collective body not just in the ministry and not just in mom and dad but in each and every one of us and that's what keeps me coming back here to preach and to be a part of this is because I believe that you are the same as I am and I'm the same as you are I remember one of the first things I said when I moved here as I said this church has more power in it than it knows why because the holy spirit is present in the lives of the Believers here and when you get the Holy Spirit like we said last time in the service before it's like the seed inside of that Lily everything you have need of is quickened by the Holy Spirit and everything you're supposed to be as quick and by the Holy Spirit and once you come to life and because you had it ordained for you in the first place nothing will stop it that is the power of this church and every Church where there are real children of God is that the holy spirit's there to Quicken them into what they are supposed to be and nothing can stop but I was listening just before service where brother Branham says you you you lay down concrete and he says where is the grass thickest he says it's on the edge of the concrete because though the seed is underneath it will follow the path of warmth and sunlight and it'll come out and then it'll go straight up next to that concrete he said even concrete won't stop the life of that grass and he says it doesn't matter what Satan piles on top of us whether it's difficulty whether it's genetics whether it's family issues whether it's Ministry issues nothing is going to stop the life of God from coming out in your life if you have this see Gene of God inside of you that's the promise that we have amen but we spend weeks on on this idea of what it means to be a son and a daughter of God and this side of adoption but the thing we want to hammer down this service is that your teacher is always the one that evaluates you we submit self self-assessments I think at times when I do my my personal reviews at work for my work I have to say how I thought I did but in the end what I think doesn't matter it's what my boss thinks and it's the same thing in the class and it's the same thing when we're talking about this adoption is that the tutor is the one that gives the report now I don't know what your kids are like but sometimes our kids come home from school and they give us a different report than what their report card says amen we don't listen to the child now sometimes they have some concerns that maybe we want to talk to the teacher about but in the end we're going to go by what the teacher says not by what that child says because our assessment of ourself is usually flawed when it comes to being a child of God listen the pastor doesn't evaluate you the deacons don't evaluate you Mom and Dad don't evaluate you we have opinions and we have input but in the end it's going to be the holy spirit that qualifies you as a child of God or not a child of God and where you're at in your walk with God and these things amen we read that that quote a couple weeks ago where where brother Brahm says people say they have the truth and the reason they believe it is because they said it of themselves that can't be where we're at as children of God it's because I say I am a child of God that's what makes me a child of God now there's something that we face in this age and and it's an attitude of of self-reflection and self uh approval if you we will and it's called narcissism and it is literally the the defining characteristic of this layout to see an age and I looked it up and it says that it's a mental health condition this isn't just an attitude this isn't just an idea now they say it's a mental health condition in which people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance they need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them and you'll see that today in that and certainly in this thing with social media where social media is a place where you can create a Persona you can create a lifestyle you can create an impression of who and what you are and what you have and there is no accountability there and it feeds narcissism now uh these big words always come from the Greeks don't they and narcissus was a a Greek character from mythology and he fell deeply in love with who himself he resisted the advances of everybody because he did not feel that they were what he was looking for and then one day he was going by a still pool of water and said who's that handsome fellow and he fell in love with himself and he would stay there and he would stare at himself he was so appreciative of his fine looks and his wonderful figure and his big muscles and his glowing eyes and he fell in love with himself and he rejected all other love and then when he finally found out that he was staring at himself he ended up dying because he could not have the love which he craved and this is what we're talking about today is this idea of people who are satisfied with who and what they are based on their own reflection of themselves they're looking not in a mirror of the word they're not even looking in a real mirror but they're looking in a mirror of their own assessment and they're saying you my friend are awesome all day every day you are awesome and you know what you tell yourself something long enough you'll start to believe it it's absolutely true you keep telling yourself what you think you are or what you think you ought to be it'll have an effect now there's a place for that in the believer's life but what you're supposed to be saying is this is what I am now Lord make the mirror reflected but what we have today is we look in the mirror and we say the mirror is wrong and what I say is right no the word of God is what we're supposed to say is right and Lord bring me into subjection make me be what the word says that I am amen and we've spoken many times about this it always makes brother vichel giggle because he's got I think a lot of experience with it and we run into people at work that will tell you how good they are at their job and every work has them every workplace has them they'll tell you how good they are at their job but what you'll realize very quickly is the people that are really good at their job are too busy doing their job to tell you how good they are at their job because they have to do their work and the work of the person that's busy telling you how good they are at their job what is it it's narcissism they're so self-admiring that they can't actually do anything practically good in their life we call it delusions of competency and it's rampant in the world today and we're getting to the place where people want to be paid a hundred thousand dollars to do twenty thousand dollars of work because their opinion of themselves is that I'm worth a hundred thousand dollars and they don't realize the work and effort that it goes it that goes into making that kind of money in the world today look at what the scripture says about this this church age around us in Revelation 3. it says unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God this is the one we have to worry about this is this is the witness I want to say something good about me the one that is the faithful and true witness that doesn't have a bias that isn't swayed by things but they're going to tell you the way it is and it says I Know Thy Works you're neither hot or cold he says I would Thou Art how cold or hot I want you to be one or the other don't be in the middle so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest your self-assessment what you say is in the mirror you say I am rich I am increased with goods and have need of nothing but watch what the faithful and true witness says the faithful and true witness says and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked notice how the attitude for this age is self-congratulatory you've made it you're what you think you ought to be you're you've arrived you don't have to do anything else you can sit back and relax remember the parable of the rich man and and he built the bigger Burns and bigger Burns and he said my soul take thies and and then God says Thou full you don't know that tonight it'll be your life will be required of you it's the same thing here we're sitting there and we're saying we've got it all we've got it all we've got it all I believe we have it all today we have what we is required to make us into the bride of Christ inside of us and it has been given to us by a seven Church age messenger we have a voice a message that's telling us how to get ready but we can't go into this message thinking we have it all we can't do it and it's the greatest danger I think as being born into a message believing home is that you think you have it because you have it but the idea is not to have it the idea is to be it they say I am rich I am increased with Goods I've got everything but are you what you have because that's what we're looking for in this age amen we're looking to be the faithful and true witness of what he's doing in this age not just what he's brought but we want to be it we don't just want to hear it we read that quote a couple Services ago where brother Brown says that that this idea that they they're they're they think they're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing that I need of nothing he says means that they either think they have it all or they have enough to be satisfied I'm not satisfied until I'm gone into Rapture church I'm not satisfied until the fullness of the work of God is done in my life and until then I'm going to keep pressing I'm going to keep pushing amen I don't care if I'm going to be 70 years old or if I may have 43 I'm going to keep pressing because I know there's more work to be done and that means there's more of God to be expressed in my life amen but what do they believe here in this laodicean church age they believe that what they have is more than sufficient to meet God's standard they believe that they've got what it takes to go in a rapture and yet they're nowhere close it's like the the story of the emperor with no clothes they literally have nothing and they think they have everything and it's because they believed a lie and they've been damned by it and so their eyes are completely blinded and so they only see what's in their imagination it shows that the the way that God measures things is different than the way we do remember the way brother Brown would say the Way Up Is Down and the way down is up and he would say that things like what is what is simple in Man's eyes is great in God's eyes and what's great in God's eyes is simply Man's eyes that we're not going to see it and I believe that the revealing of the Bride in this last age will be it'll deceive everyone because it'll be so simple you know how I get that because Christ was as simple as it comes there was nothing flashy there was nothing outward but though so the the the the signs and the and the works of God followed him but the word was in his mouth as well it was the whole package and the thing is that was in one man but now we've got to spread over hundreds and thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands of people in this world it'll be so small because brother Mark will just be a little portion of God and brother Bob will be another one and sister lydia'll be another one and sister Rochelle will be another one and people just have to see that little bit of light and they'll miss it because they'll say how can that be God and yet it is literally God in flesh the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God I've said this before and this is just me I believe that full adoption will be at the very very end because if the world is seen a bunch of Believers walking around is fully adopted it'd shake the world did it shake the world and with the way the the the that information flows these days it come out very quickly who and what we are and they'd figure it out and all of a sudden they'd be flocking in and they'd be accepting it because they'd see the proof but the problem is the proof always comes after the door's shut so the door is going to shut and they'll say how did we miss it how did we miss it you missed it because you were looking for the signs and wonders instead of the life the hidden life in Christ that's the first thing the bride's going to have the second thing will be second wonders it'll be a hidden life first it'll be signs in one or second because it always follows these signs shall follow them that believe I believe in signs and wonders I believe it and we've seen it but it is a minor not a major and what he's looking for is a bride that has his life in her first and foremost amen look at this story it's a very familiar one of the Rich Young Ruler and says that when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there's none good but one and that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest church I would love it if God would come to me and say there's only one thing you're lacking today John I I would die for the day where God came to me and said there's only one thing left for you to do but you know what it is it'll be the hardest thing we ever had to do it'll be the hardest thing and Watch What Happens he says go thy way sell whatever thou Hast give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me he said everything you've gained everything you've earned everything you count is good give it away and you get no benefit you don't get to put money in your pocket you don't get to go buy a second pair of shoes you don't get to buy a winter coat sell it all and come to me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven no benefit from everything you've done Paul said I counted as dung everything I brought to him worthless unless you're a farmer and that young man was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions Jesus said you'll have treasure in heaven but he valued what he had here his treasure he had here more than that you see what this was church because remember what happened then happens today he didn't come truly wanting eternal life what he came wanting was affirmation that what he had done was going to do the job laodicea comes and they say I've done what is required and God says no you haven't he wants affirmation he wanted affirmation we want affirmation one of the wonderful things we can do with our kids is give them affirmation but affirmation without correction turns them into spoiled brats God affirms us all the time he does he gives you a pat on the back gives you a thumbs up he gives you an amen he does that but he also corrects us as well and this young man he loved him enough to correct him he loved him enough to correct him to give him the opportunity to show him the path to eternal life and that young man turned away because he didn't get the affirmation and he didn't get the answer he wanted yet he came with an idea that he was still missing something and when that something was too big for him to give up he walked away sadly and brother Brandon would say he's the Rich Young he's the rich man who built the barns later and then he went over and he's on the other side and he's in hell and he's looking over saying can you send Lazarus over with a cup of cold water or just dip his finger in because my tongue is so hot that young man went to hell and yet he spoke to the word made flesh who told him what to do and he turned it down why his assessment of himself was I don't need what he told me to do that's the latest seeing thing he didn't want Direction and he didn't want revelation he wanted affirmation of where he was at as being good enough children of God can't be that way scripture says so let a man examine himself not admire himself examine himself take a look through the word take a look through what's coming over the pulpit and say am I lining up with that does my life genuinely reflect that or am I straining to even hold on to where I am but or is there something that's coming out of me that affirms that the word is right and I've got to step into it that self-affirming nature will take you to hell it's got to come from the Holy Spirit it can't be you that says I'm ready to go in a Rapture amen we need to know who we are and what we are but we need to know it by the revelation of the Holy Spirit of this not because we think it of ourselves but we have to see what this says coming out of our Lives each one amen I read this quote a couple of of services ago and and we'll maybe read it again in another service because it has so many facets to it and there's so many angles you can take off it but brother Branham says you can never be satisfied with the world's Goods in other words you'll never be able to say I'm rich and increase with goods and that be enough you can never be satisfied with belonging to a church you'll never be satisfied until you've found satisfaction in Jesus Christ the son of God I I I I heard another quote where brother Brown said once you receive him you can't be satisfied with anything else and you can't go back to anything else because it has nothing there for you that has died and now you found new life you've found new purpose and so there's nothing to go back to it doesn't even have an effect on you anymore he says the only way you can ever be satisfied and then he says now he came to bring Perfection now we look at Perfection we talked about it as maturity but he came to bring Perfection we're going to talk about what that is in future Services because he would say perfection is love he didn't just come to create it but he brought it to bring it he brought it to produce it there's a bringing it and then there's a producing it and you have to see both sides of those things but my point here is that if he said he was going to do it he's going to do it if God said Perfection if God said maturity if God said adopted Sons and Daughters of God are required then God's going to do it he doesn't say it and not do it amen the scripture says he's not the son of man that he should repent that he should take back what he said and he's not God he's not like a man that he should lie when he says that he's going to do it and he's going to give whatever is required to bring that to pass in our lives like I said we're going to miss it so often because he does it so simply he does it in such a small and humble way and it's up to the believer to see that the word says this not this person says it's going to be this way and this one says it's going to be that way because they miss it time and time again and the prophet of God comes and he sells us don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it it's so humble it's just a a a little Kentucky hillbilly with a sixth grade education and it's not all great doctrines but it's a simple humble Victorious Christian Life it's not it's not uh Creeds and dogmas and these things are going to take it but it's Christ himself that's going to get you across the finish line we have two sets of people in this layout to see an agent one of them talks about how good they are and then the other one says Lord you said I'm supposed to be this and now I'm looking to you to make me into it because we see in our flesh can dwell no good thing it's going to take a work greater than our our discernment it's going to take a work greater than our discipline it's going to take something that's bigger than we are to bring us over the finish line and get us into this position of adopted Sons and Daughters of God and that approval has to be by God himself through the Holy Spirit we opened up in Romans 8 and it says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you've got to be led by the Holy Spirit now there is a leadership of the Holy Spirit through the ministry there's a leadership of the Holy Spirit through the parents but in the end each and every one of us has to have our own personal leadership for our life now you're going to be under headship my sons don't get to say I've got the leadership of the Holy Spirit to do something without me saying yes you're right there's headship along those ways but in the end each and every one of us is supposed to be led by the spirit of God Amen that's the starting point of your real walk and if you're going to get to adoption it's not going to be because your pastor did it it's not going to be because Mom and Daddy did it it's going to be because the Holy Spirit stepped in and he quickened what Mommy and Daddy have been telling you what the pastor's been telling you what the fivefold ministry has been telling you and that's what brings you to adoption it's not my job to bring you to adoption it's not mommy and daddy's it's the holy spirit's job in your life personally to do that and he'll use people around you and he'll work with you individually where nobody else can see it but it's a working of the holy spirit that gets us to these those points amen he says here for you have not received the spirit of bondage he didn't say the spirit of bondage to fear he said the spirit of bondage again to fear so that means before you come into the spirit there is a bondage of fear and I I've told this story many times well I'll get to it in a little bit we can spend days on just this this little scripture here but I want to hit this idea of fear really hard and then move on because John would say there is no fear in love none there is zero fear there is no fear not a fear does not exist in the love that John is talking about he says why but perfect love perfect love not mommy and daddy's love not a spousal love but perfect love casteth out fear why because fear had torment but he that feareth is not made perfect in love we're talking about this idea of the stamp of approval and when we look at the adoption process it has an effect you cannot go through the tutoring the the training of the Holy Spirit and come out the way you went in you've got to come out different otherwise you're not ready for adoption and it's something that's real it's something that's tangible you know in your heart of hearts and in your mind of Minds what you desire and what you don't desire you know what you think and what you don't think we only get to see the facial expressions and see the things you do with your hands and feet and the words that come out of your mouth but we're looking for something that's changed in here not just outward conformity that's what the Holy Spirit does is he changes the inward man to produce something on the outside that is supposed to look like a Christian but we can put on an outward man that has nothing to do with the Holy Spirit and say I'm a Child of God that's when you say I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing because you put it on but it's not coming out of you but this this process of the Holy Spirit working in our lives has tangible benefits and Paul says one of the or John says one of the benefits here is that you come out and you don't fear a thing there is nothing that holds you back and and Paul would say you know neither neither uh you know fears or famines or powers or principalities or all these things none of them will hold us back from the from the love that is in God and so we look at situations and it doesn't cause us to fear because why we are in the perfect love that is Christ and that's saying it doesn't matter what this looks like it doesn't matter what's going on perfect love is going to take us through and it's going to be for our good he says you don't walk in with a spirit of fear you walk in with a spirit of love and that's what carries you through these things but if we look at even the very work of God we have filial love we have human love and that's dependent on what we do but the scripture says that while we were yet sinners God loved us and he gave his life for us and we see that God's love is independent of our actions it's independent of what we think of what we don't think about how we feel his love cannot be stopped it cannot be exhausted and it cannot be outgrown it cannot be outrun his love is there and it's constantly working regardless of what we think it's a love that we can't understand until we get to this place and when you come into Christ you start to experience it but remember brother Brandon would say having gone over to the other side and he said only perfect love can enter there he says it's but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of what you have here today he says what you have there when you are fully in that place in a perfect body he says everything here is eight times removed from it it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit we've got just a drop of this ocean of what it means to be in perfect love that's how big he says that's how perfect it is it's it's something that completely overwhelms he says it's so overwhelming that a woman could hug me and I wouldn't feel a thing he says there's none of that is there it's so completely encompasses you and erases every bit of Filth or sensuality or this physical thing that we call love he says and it's perfect and you just don't he says don't miss it don't miss it what I experience he says don't miss it that was the greatest thing that he could say don't miss it what was over there you don't want to miss it because it's so far greater than every experience in the Holy Ghost you have every wonderful service every moment on your knees in prayer he says it's bigger than all that it is perfect and that's what we're coming into that's the Perfection that we're looking for amen but it's independent of us that's the beauty of it because if it was dependent on me it ain't going to be perfect and it ain't going to be whole I'll hold it back but this is something that overwhelms us completely Romans 8 5 8 this is what I was talking about but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us that word commendeth means to prove or exhibit to establish and confirm so Paul's saying that God exhibited is love he proved his love by showing that love when we were Unworthy of it when we weren't looking for it when we didn't deserve it this love is not dependent on our deserving it it's dependent on his predestinated will is is dependent on him saying you're a part of me therefore I love you not on what we're doing at that particular day or that moment when we can't stop it like I said we can't exhaust it we can't outrun it we can't outwork it we can't do anything that would stop the love of God from having its effect in our lives that's how perfect it is and really Perfection comes when we accept it and we let it do in us what he's been trying to do all along and we understand that whether it's a spanking he's giving us or whether it's a beautiful steak and a nice sit down it's all for our good and we start to accept that this love is in it for us not just for him but Paul John would say that that perfect love casts out that fear and that's the first thing you'll notice if you think back to to when you first got the Holy Ghost is the first thing it does is it takes fear out I've said many times because I find it funny that I was always scared that I wouldn't like being a Christian what's a reasonable question to a German I don't want to spend all this effort and go into it if I'm not going to like it and I don't want to go in if I'm going to back out and I didn't know if I was going to like it but the secret was if I wanted it it's because I was going to like it and I was miserable where I was at so what's the harm you know but I I've spoken many times about the the fear that God works on and the first thing that that he took from me and this is my testimony is that I had that recurring fear and it was in a nightmare every night almost and I would be falling falling falling and it was in a place of great Blackness and I was completely alone and there was nobody around and as I was falling and falling never going to hit anything never going to end there was it was so quiet that it was loud and that's the only way I can say it and there was a loudness building in the silence and it was an overwhelming sense of impending doom and it wasn't until I read in the scripture or in the message where brother Branham said hell he says you are alone with your thoughts and you're alone with the the knowledge of everything you've done wrong and he says you're falling and falling and falling and there's nothing to catch you and what I realized was that it went after I got baptized and received the Holy Spirit that dream went away forever and I have never ever ever ever ever ever had it again God is my witness why he took fear out of my eternal destination out of me when I didn't even know what that fear was sometimes they say the greatest way to beat your fears to is to face it I didn't even know what it was and yet he took it away because what my eternal destination was settled from that moment in my heart and so fear can't rest there anymore but it was a horrible thing to wake up in the middle of the night with the sweats because you didn't realize you were so scared and you didn't know why and you didn't know what was causing these things but Paul or John is talking about something else because Satan's a tricky one if he can't get you there he'll get you someplace else and you lose one fear and he adds a new fear on and the greatest fear he does is he he puts us in a place where we think that our Salvation is dependent on our actions where we think that our position in Christ is dependent on what we do day to day that's a reflection of who we are but that's not what gets us in How I Live my day every day is a reflection of where my walk is in Christ but remember he said you can be a Son of God and never come to adoption and you'll be a son all the rest of your days but you'll never be adopted into the family but you'll still make it and he would talk about those that that preacher that gave up he got hurt he got offended somehow and he says that's it I'm done with it and he says I'm I'm not going back to it and three weeks later he got run over by a truck why because God won't let his son stay there in that condition he takes them home and you'll see that many times as somebody will come to the Lord and boom God takes them because he just had to get them in and then that son was never going to make it that daughter was never going to be where they needed to be or where they ought to be as a Believer and so he gets them in he seals them and then he takes them away but this ideas of Satan is he'll take away that old fear that old fear is gone he can't have that anymore and so he'll replace it with a new fear and Paul's saying listen this this spirit that you have it takes away fears it's a fear taking spirit Satan is a fair giving spirit the Holy Spirit takes it away that's its job is to take away fears out of our Lives amen brother Brown would say this he's speaking of this fear what's this fear oh I wonder if I can just hold out oh if I can just hold out now he said hold on nothing it isn't whether I held out it's whether he held out he says I'm in him now see because Satan replaces it with you've got to work your way into this now you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you've got to do this and you got to do that and you got to do this and you got to do that and he puts pressure on you to do it and when you don't do it he says now you better get back on that because if you don't you're not a done of Son of God you're not a daughter of God and he puts a fear that you've got to do all of this to make it across brother says no no it's not about whether I hold on to him he held on to me he wants you to put your hand out he wants you to grab but even if I let go he's still got my wrist he's going to hold on to me he's not going to let me slip back into Hellfire he's not going to do that if we look at Romans 15 it takes us to the conclusion of this and it says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have the spirit of adoption have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba father so one is a spirit that binds you it enslaves you to fear over and over and over again and this world is filled with fears it is filled with fears Everybody's scared of everything they're scared about climate change they're scared about economies they're scared about politics they're scared about health they're scared about viruses they're scared about what their kids going to be like what their kids not going to be like they're scared about their marriages because most of them fail these days they're failed about whether they're going to have a job tomorrow they're worried about whether they can pay their mortgage tomorrow if they can afford groceries everything is fear fear fear fear fear and he and Paul comes back to us he says no your spirit says dad father you called me to this the path I'm walking on the place I'm in the people I'm with the things I'm doing they are of your doing they are of your placing they're in your training program and so I'm coming to you and I'm saying you started it I'm trusting you to finish it no not in this like no no you better do it no it's I'm trusting I'm believing I'm expecting I'm confessing amen this is your work not my work I'll do everything I can but in the end it's you that's going to do the finishing it's not me I'm just trying to surrender myself and get me across the line you're the father I'm in your kingdom I came out of my kingdom I came out of Satan's kingdom and I came into yours that makes you responsible for me and I'm here to claim that responsibility the worst thing you can do is say I'm going to do it you go to him and say Lord I'm trusting you to do it I'll do everything I can but my life is in your hands the effect is in your hands the result is in your hands because it's a supernatural work that we're looking for in our lives program says someone said not long ago when I was in Phoenix the prayer lines were way down the streets they couldn't even get into the auditorium going in the line someone said are you aren't you afraid brother Branham to stand there before all those things and realize that critics are standing there and newspaper report reporters and so forth to criticize I said I'm Not Afraid as long as I feel that he's near but if I can't feel him I will get off the platform and go home he's a prophet of God to the age he's the seventh Church age messenger and he says if he's not there I'll go but if he's there I'll stay there as long as he's there and I won't worry about a thing church if he's in your life you don't have to worry about a thing now he says feel him now remember brother I'm speaking of a different thing because he'd say I know him he says he's here now and this is not just a general concept but this is the personal presence of the Angel of the Lord he says that's what's required to make this gift work and he says as long as he's here then we can do it all it'll happen because it's not me doing it it's him that's doing it but if he goes away so he's not talking about do you feel like the holy spirit's here we're not going by feelings we're not going by what we see or or by whether we get the tinglies or the hairs on our arms or the back of our neck go up that's not what he's talking about he was saying I need to know that the angel of the Lord is present because he's the one that's doing everything that happens in these meetings he can preach that's not a problem he's anointed to preach but to do those Works he says that takes the personal presence to be here he says as long as he's there I don't have any fear it drives it away what was it what are we looking at here Church we're talking about what the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit confirming to you you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be afraid but you've got to know that you've got it and Satan will challenge you on that point day in and day out do you have the Holy Ghost do you have the Holy Ghost do you have the Holy Ghost you don't have the Holy Ghost he wouldn't do that and he wouldn't do that and he wouldn't do that and you know what he's right he wouldn't do that but he's still working on me he's still working on me and you say yes he wouldn't do that that's why I'm repenting of it and that's why I'm trying not to do it anymore and there's a desire in me that is wanting to get right with the word of God and that's what confirms the holy spirit in my life not that I am perfect but that is taking me into that which is perfect bit by bit footsteps his possession I've said it many times in the last months take one step a day towards God just one step don't hold still don't go back take one step and if you get two or three praise the Lord but take one step a day towards God and step into his word and you'll start to see that those results it's um you know I used to to play a lot of games on the computer and these different things and and in a lot of games you had to pay to get anywhere if you wanted to get there quickly but what I realized is they'll give you little dribs and drabs all along for free and so being an engineer I did the math and I said if I play this game for 120 days I can do that rather than pay the 20 bucks right now so I just go in and get the free thing every day and 120 days later I could buy whatever it is I wanted or do whatever I wanted it sounds silly I know but that's the point is is that bit by bit gets you there that that consistency that one footstep a day will get you there I was I was down in a conference I'm in conference three days this week for work and we finished early yesterday and I I said you know I didn't get to go to the gym I've been sitting all day I've been eating all day I've been listening all day I need to get some exercise so I looked up on my phone because I said maybe I can walk up and meet Selena where she works rather than have her drive down to pick me up looked it up and it says sure you can do that in 34 35 minutes I said I'm going for a walk then and I walked all the way up barter's hill all the way up to the old stadium where we used to play with the seven day Venice all the way up to the old Dublin Bakery and down by the old schools and I walked all the way to work but somebody had to stop I had to stop and say it really isn't that far and I'm walking up the uh barter's Hill the steepest hill in St John's as far as I know and I'm wearing my bluntstone boots now contrary to the song those boots are not made for walking they are meant to go two and a half kilometers up with half of it uphill almost but guess what I had started and I wasn't going back so it was just one foot in front of the other my calves are aching my thighs are aching I'm sweating but I'm like I'm gonna get there I started on this journey and I'm gonna go there's just one foot in front of the other when I went sheep hunting with brother Jethro Steven way back in Alberta we'd climb up mountains I think we we climbed seven thousand feet in a day something like that seven thousand feet you know how you climb a mountain church one step at a time because if you stop there and said it's going to take me 13 326 steps to get to the top of that mountain in the next four hours you'd quit because thirteen thousand is too many steps but when you just do one step at a time four hours later you're there but if you're counting thirteen thousand three hundred twenty eight thirteen thousand three hundred twenty seven thirteen thousand three hundred twenty six you get pretty tired out in a hurry because you're so focused on how long it's going to take rather than just trying to put one foot in front of the other your walk is one foot in front of the other getting to the finish line is just one foot in front of the other it's not a race it's who finishes that's what this is all about amen I'm not sure how I got off there I'll be honest One Foot In Front of the other if you know he's with you if you know he started you on the work just one foot in front of the other and when you don't feel like you can do it what do you say take my hand precious Lord and lead me home that's it sometimes that's all you need this brother Jethro I was hunting with he had he had an accident and he cracked his pelvis and he was hiking with a cracked pelvis and every step I was near him because I'm I didn't have a cracked pelvis so I was this is me this is my first Mountain hunt so I'd walk fairly quickly and then I'd stop and then he'd catch up and then as soon as he caught up I go again so it was just back and forth back and forth like an accordion but I'd hear him coming up and go and he was in excruciating pain from his pelvis and he climbed seven thousand feet with a cracked pelvis because he wanted to go hunting if he can do that about hunting what can we do when it comes to our Christian walk every step was Agony for him but he wanted to go hunting bad enough that he put up with it and he couldn't he couldn't even suppress it that's how painful it was and if anybody knows Jethro Jethro can take a beating this this guy is tough he's lean he's he's a he's just a a country boy that knows the Wilderness he's a hard worker fastest worker best worker I've ever been around he's a tough guy and if he's laying out that little moan of pain it's because he's hurting bad because he'd never let it out of his own will and he's up there and he's climbing up 7 000 feet because he wants to go hunting like Paul said we haven't resisted under blood yet I think we can toughen up sometimes but Paul would say God is love when we ain't Tough Enough when we get sick and tired God is love and he grabs a hold of us he says I'm going to drag you sometimes we'll get through the mud together we'll get through the hard times together we'll get over the hill together that's how you know you pass from Death onto life when that fear goes away you say I can't make it Lord I Need You Now that's really when you start to grow is when you say Lord I need you to get over this that I really can't do it on my own but in Romans 8 it says the spirit itself beareth Witness not me it says the Holy Spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are a child of God it's not my self-assessment it's the Holy Spirit confirming to me that I'm a child of God and I've got to have that as Germanic as I am and as disciplined as I am I've got to have that encouragement I've got to have that constancy saying you're doing okay you could do better but you're doing okay you move forward today you didn't go backward and you didn't stand still and that's what it does and we look into the word and these things and we look at the witness of the holy spirit in our life and we ought to be seeing some affirmation because we're supposed to be changing from Glory unto Glory so we should see those affirmations but it's not going to be constant it's not going to be constant but if the holy spirit is there to Bear witness to us and we see the drama that brother Brandon would talk about of of the of the the tutor coming to the father and these different things and he has a quota where he says now what because we talked about what happens if the kid was no good but what if the kid was good let's talk about that he says now what if the child had done good oh how the Holy Spirit likes to bring their character how the teacher would like to come to the father and say are you the father of this child I am all right well I want to tell you that little fellow is one of the smartest little chaps I've ever seen oh even though he's youthful he's just a chip off the old block that's all he loves you he's just exactly like you he's about your business he stands just exactly firm on what you say why he says he's just like you let's just stop for a second looking that we're talking about being a children of God and the witness of the holy spirit is supposed to be you're just like Christ the way we talked about in the in the past recently how this word Christian has become something that has no meaning anymore because you call yourself a Christian but there's a witness of the holy spirit that says you're just like here you're just like your daddy you're just like Christ you're a Christian you're christ-like your life is a reflection of his life you're just like him you're a chip off the old block what'd he say yes he's Young yes she's young yes she's still in school but she's just like you she's just like you when you were little too and what is it it's a sign that the seed of the father is in you that you came from him and you're going back to him the pattern of our life ought to reflect what's in the word it's that simple not a pattern of our own choosing but a pattern that's in the word and then the Holy Spirit comes behind that and confirms it to us he says how that teacher likes to say that what do you think that father thinks swells out his chest and says That's my boy oh God he says how I hope I can be obedient enough till the father will be pleased with what I did he says I hope that you're obedient enough that it'll please God we're looking at the witness we're looking at the stamp of approval we're looking at what is the holy spirit going to be saying about our lives as we come up to adoption what was the first witness he had here if we look at this last quote the first thing he says is he loves you you love God and you can't love God and not love his word and you can't love God and not love the people of God it's the two things that are impossible to be a Christian you cannot love the Saints and you cannot love the word you can't not love those things and be a Christian it is impossible it is impossible to do those things John said this is how they'll know you're my disciples by your love one for another that's the way it's supposed to look but it can't be me saying that it's got to be him saying it and what is it it's us saying We Love You by Our Lives not just our mouth mouth is easy I can say I love Blanca but I've got to act it for her to believe it she took my word on it initially but now I've got to live it through our marriage to say I truly love you regardless of what you do regardless of what you say regardless of how you change good or bad it doesn't matter I've got to love her I've got to back up those words and it's the same thing for god notice he said he loves you and then he said he's just like you he likes the things you like he's just like you were he's a chip off the old block that proves your love is what follows that love that expression of love I remember brother Ron Spencer he talks to a lot of young men and you know young ministers to help them get started and encourage them along the way and the most common thing he'll say young men come to him they say brother Ron how do I grow in my Ministry how do I really be a minister you know what he says simplest thing in the world fall in love with Jesus fall in love with Jesus and then when you do that he says get into the word because what happens is we get into the word and we don't have a personal relationship and all of a sudden what's coming over this is intellect and pride gets attached to it and influence gets attached to it and all of a sudden it's about me me me and there's no love there because remember this is all about Redemption it's about restoration of relationship and what's he saying he's saying ministers fall in love with Christ get personal in your relationship fall in love with his presence fall in love with his leadership fall in love with his word to the point where you'll value that above everything else because that's what it's going to take each one of us has to have that it's not exclusive to the ministry by any means but the problem is is that the ministry could get pulled so easily by money by popularity and by women what loves of other things he's saying Get Your Love settled and everything else will fall into place it's that simple it's that simple fall in love with Jesus I think that's a great thing to say to our young people to all of us are you in love with Christ not are you in love with the message and the doctrines of the message because guess what we can fall in love with those things we can fall in love with learning we can fall in love with heady revelation we can fall in love with the other side of things we can fall in love with emotional services and shouting and hollering and dancing none of them wrong but we can fall in love with those things we can fall in love with the emotion of love and we can't stand to do what love is which is sacrifice it's to put selfishness down under your foot and kill it that's what love is selfishness goes out the window so with love we can fall in love with the feeling of it or the thought of it or the belief of it or the anticipation of it but when it comes to our door true love is found in how we act not in what we say and do and so those Temptations for ministers those three things that's what they've got to guard against and so they've got to be in love with something else that never lets that come in between them and God he would say in first John 2 he says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever there's a wonderful quote here because we're we we talked about sister Delfina and they had to do a transcript review for her to graduate and there's a transcript review that goes on by the Holy Spirit if I could put that this way brother Bradham speaks of this in the in adoption number two and the father says oh that's my son that's my boy well you think he's well matured yup shirt who said the Holy Spirit I give him tests boy I tried them this way tried them that way now listen to the transcript I throw him down Sick I put him under I stomped him stomping 101. one of the classes that Sons and Daughters of God go through I let the devil do everything to him he could do also wasn't the Holy Spirit doing it was the devil doing it but the holy spirit let it the holy spirit let it he says that's the class you got to go through stomping 101. he says he came right back up it's okay to get knocked down listen we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and dark things and these different things we're going to get knocked down we are gonna get knocked down but he says what he came right back up again he came just the same also it didn't take away from him it didn't diminish him no he came back just the same I threw him in the hospital I turned his wife against them I turned his neighbors against him I turned everything and he says that didn't make a bit of difference said though he slay me yet I'll trust him listen to this I killed his family I took this I did this I done all this I did this that other still he stood right up though he slay me yet I'll serve him he's mine now Church some of us have faced these more than others in here but some of us are still in these exams right now some of us are still here I look at sister Brenda sitting there and none of her family is here it's an exam isn't it sister Maureen walked away from family brother Chad sitting here none of his family sister Betty sitting in the hospital this very night what's our testimony though he slay me it didn't make a bit of difference what a testimony sisters what a testimony Brothers no matter what he did it didn't make a difference now here's the thing you say brother John I'm not there yet you're not adopted yet either don't put the pressure on and say well I actually you know it's tough on me when I'm in the hospital yeah of course it's tough he didn't say it doesn't tough he says it didn't make a bit of difference in his relationship with me in her relationship with me he didn't go back he didn't change to the negative but he held still and he got back up and then he just kept moving forward it didn't keep him from pressing on in the word it didn't keep him from pressing on in the promise it didn't keep him from pressing on in the land he kept going and going and going whatever knocked him down he got back up and he kept going and going and going that's what he means by doesn't make a difference doesn't mean we don't get hurt doesn't mean we don't get scars doesn't mean we don't get disappointed we're in a human body we're going to feel those things but he's saying what did it do to your relationship did you walk away did you say I've had enough if God really loved me he wouldn't do it he says no it didn't make a bit of difference this is the witness of people that have the fire of the holy spirit in their lives that they've got to see Gene of God that's coming up and it's starting to Blossom and it's flowering now and God is saying is he ready is she ready yes just like you and nothing changes that being just like you what a witness what a testimony that we ought to be looking for he'd say well I believe we ought to call him out somewhere to a little special place and have an adoption he said now when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and had been seasoned out had been seasoned out into adoption unto he says they're born a child but then when they're a son right then but they'll never be no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and do what show what they are not just say it show it be it express it manifest it he says then he calls them out then notice how he says he's been seasoned out we've been seasoned out into adoption not swayed by circumstances not swayed by emotions not put into action by mere need but seasoned what able to stand still and wait on God and able to move into action when the holy spirit moves us to do it we tend to think experience puts us into action no experience puts us into right action if you've ever been around trauma doctors and and a good friend of my father's is a trauma doctor they know what to do the right way the right time in the right order and you disobey a trauma doctor at your peril because if you disobey somebody dies why because they've been trained to do exactly what is right in the moment with very little information they've got to be able to look assess triage and say we're going to do this this and then this and you say well this is horrible this is no no that's not what matters we've got to make sure the blood's flowing we've got to make sure they've got enough in there we've got to stabilize the head you know whatever it is you don't ignore a trauma doctor why because they're seasoned you don't put rookies in as trauma doctors you always have one that is very experienced and then you have the rest beneath him learning and growing and understanding how to do these things and it's the same way with the children of God we're supposed to be seasoned we're supposed to be doing the right thing at the right time with the right motive and the right objective and it has the right effect it has the right effect and that takes leadership that takes maturity that takes patience that takes up prayer life and that takes knowing the word of God all those things and there's probably more that I'm forgetting but we often you know I talk about trauma doctors and we get into situations in life and you know what sometimes we can do the wrong thing trying to fix something not realizing that something else is the real problem and they'll spiral down down because we're so busy trying to fix a different symptom and the root of the issue we haven't recognized it we hold life and death in our hands did you know that prophet of God says I'm going to read a quote but we literally hold eternal life in our hands we hold people's souls in our hands now you say brother John you can't stop a true child of God from getting an eternal life and that's right Jesus said he wouldn't lose any of them everyone that's been given to him that's in his hands he's going to have but what about everyone else I can't stop brother Mark from getting eternal life because he's a Son of God but what about somebody that walks through that door they may not be a true son and daughter of God but we hold salvation in our hands our witness Our Testimony our actions our words all of these things play in brother random would say this he says you know there's so many of us and most all of us influence Somebody by the things that we do the way we live and the things we say we influence somebody somebody is watching your life and then when we profess to be Christians what type of life should we live if somebody is watching us and your life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody their Eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do for they've watched you wow we'll talk about this a little bit later remember brother Branham says that you're what you did before you came to service or your attitude in the service could keep somebody from getting their healing we hold things in our hands there's power in our hands there's an effect there's an influence that we have and it behooves us to look at our life and say is this truly reflective of what a son and a daughter of God did I spoke last service about bad drivers and I ever since I've spoken about that they have come out in droves to test me but remember I said last night that I said I said to the Lord I said I've got to get better at handling bad drivers because they're everywhere and they don't know it and and I'm just I'm going to blow a gasket at some point and and so I remember what I said last time I said the first thing God does when you ask him to do it is he lets you do it a couple times to Humble you he lets you make a bone-headed move he lets you almost run somebody over or pull out into traffic in a way that almost gets you hit or something but as I mentioned after that you know you're in the ministry and you're witnessing to people and you're trying to get people to come to church and imagine if I was gesticulating and yelling and throwing a fit on the road and then that person would walk through that door or drive by and I'd say hey how about you coming into church and they said you're that guy that was yelling at me on the road the other day right if I if that's what you've got in there I don't want it and we need sometimes so that's one thing you say well you're justified in it they took your space but listen people are going to take our space constantly they're going to step on our toes they're going to offend us they're going to hurt us they're going to say unkind things on true things and we're going to have to be able to give up our right to a response to set the record straight to claim our space for the sake of their soul that's what season to mature Sons and Daughters of God do is they'll let somebody hurt them wrong them say something wrong and they'll move on for the sake of that person to try and be a witness to get them to God rather than stand up for themselves and say I have a right to this because we got lots of Rights Church this is an age of Rights laodicea means people's rights and what you'll find in this age is that everybody's standing up for their own rights but nobody's willing to lay it down for the sake of bringing somebody else into something good for them God help us to lay down that right to a harsh reaction our righteous indignation doesn't always have to be expressed sometimes it has to be expressed through prayer Lord you know and I'm tired of it and I'm sick of it and I'm hurt and I'm this and that and the other thing but Lord for their sake help me to look them in the eye and treat them like a brother treat them like a sister in Christ regardless of what they do maybe it's somebody out in the world but it's even harder when it's somebody in the church isn't it and we've got to be able to lay down our rights that's what a lamb does it lays down itself and that's the that's the dove nature that's the lamb nature second Timothy two this is for me and the servant of the Lord must not strive must not argue must not fight not must must not claim his rights he says but must be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth he's talking here about people that are hurting themselves and don't know it people that are on the wrong path people that are headed in the wrong way making wrong decisions and he says the servant of the Lord he must not fight but he must meekly approach and try and convince them otherwise because if you go in with my rights my rights and my position and I'm this and I'm that and you're not you're never going to get anywhere with them you've got to go in meekly and he says what you're trying to save people from themselves and he says that word prayer Venture means just in case on the mere possibility that you might make a difference going meekly God help us God help me God help me to do it this way if we can keep our attitude right and go in and say I'm in this for you and I'm willing to swallow whatever pill you shove at me to try and help you out of it it says that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will the prophet God would say this that's what a real Christian does you pray and humble yourself and keep before God day and night why in order that you might give yourself to somebody else we're talking about the stamp of approval we're talking about a review of the transcript of our Christian Life it's not what you keep it's what you give that counts you must give yourself out to others that's the way Jesus did he gave himself to others so what is the witness of the holy spirit for the transcript of the son or daughter that's about to be adopted there's been a shift in motive there's been a shift in objective self has been moved out of the way and now they're ready to serve now they're ready to serve now they're ready to put other needs ahead of them they are what the mature children of God are not self-seeking they are giving more than they are receiving and if you look around as you look at people that come into uh you know of age and as children become adults and and as you know young young couples marry and and they have children what do they do they become more and more giving and very much less receiving as they step into maturity as they step into greater responsibility they're giving more and they're receiving less and that's what gives us gray hairs that's what wears our bodies out is giving rather than receiving life's great when you're receiving but life has purpose when you're giving and you'll find more satisfaction when you're giving than when you're receiving there's a reason that it says it's more blessed to give than to receive it'll satisfy something in your heart that you're wondering about when you start giving it does Miracles it does Miracles inside of us what is it that combined with that love it allows us to do things regardless of what people think about us you'll help somebody you'll do something for them regardless of what they think about you know the scripture talks about heaping coals of fire on their head when you do replace uh you you respond to to harshness or or these things with with kindness that takes real maturity that takes a real season believer to do those things and will do what's right regardless of whether or not that person appreciates it or or recognizes it that's what seasoned believers do well the brand would say this we should be so on fire for God we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us I ain't here I'm not here yet but I'm going to read it and we should be so sweet and so pleasant and so kind and so christ-like in our lives you get me going day and night I'm busier than I've ever been in my life but he's saying go day and night and then on top of that be sweet so sweet not just sweet so sweet sickly sweet so pleasant so kind so christ-like in our lives he says it takes Every Day's life every day every day you got to be focused on this every day you've got to be dwelling on it every day you've got to be pressing into this day in and day out to be on fire for God to be doing what he wants you to do Jesus said consider the lily of the field how it grows toil and spinning yet I say unto you that Solomon and all of his glory is not arrayed like one Solomon have robes that were arrayed with glorious silk and needlework and things but that wasn't what he was talking about he said in order for a lily to grow it has to toil both night and day you know it's this is something maybe brother Matt and brother Joe and I will more experience more than others but there's a special time when you take your son on a hunt and for the first time he doesn't say are We Done Yet when are we stopping when are we eating or I'm too tired and maybe it's that way for shoveling snow maybe it's that way for cleaning up the yard whatever it is but it's a special day when they do everything that a man does and you say that was so good that was so refreshing he's really stepping into adulthood now you know it's it's a wonderful time when when the the sun sees that the lawn needs mowing and he's been trained how to use the mower and he knows how to start and he knows how to gas it up he knows all the spots to watch out so you don't hit a rock and bend the blade and he sees the lawn needs mowing and he goes and does it without anybody asking him that's a wonderful day for us it's a wonderful day when the young sisters and you have people over and and they immediately get up and they help without you having to ask them and all the mama said amen but it's a wonderful thing because you've taught them and you've trained them and all of a sudden they it's like something clicks and they're like oh I'm supposed to put that into action now and they do it without you asking them remember we talked about last time that what God trains you into he can use immediately and I spoke about how when I was a a kid and we do it of course with our boys and even Selena for a while is that we go out to start the car and once we taught them how to start the car and warm it up then we'd send them out to do it and we loved it for a while and then we started realizing this is just really cold and not a lot of fun and we realized they were using us but we weren't using them what were we doing we were training them to take our place so it started with starting the car and then as they got bigger it was clearing the windshield off and it was making sure that the tires were free of snow so they didn't go on the highway and we start to do what we're training them to do what we do yes we're using them in a way we appreciate that we don't have to go out in the wind in the snow and the rain and start a vehicle to warm it up but we're not doing it just for our sake we're doing it so that when they become an adult they can do the things that we do we're training them to step into mama and dada's position as they come of age and so we can look at these things as oh we're just being used of course and I didn't mean to give that impression because we do get a benefit as parents from training our children it reduces our workload but that's of necessity because our workload has to reduce as we get older we can't run as long as we could before we can't do the tele10k anymore can we do brother Bob at the drop of a hat can't do it and so you've got your kids coming up and as you reduce they build up and you can maintain everything that you've been doing all along but what is it they're showing they're mature and that's when you start to realize it's clicked when they start using everything you've taught them and realizing not just that they're capable of doing it but applying it at the time of the need then you start to say they're becoming an adult kids this is your key to getting everything you ever wanted in the home recognize the need and do what Mommy and Daddy have taught you to do because when they trust that you have learned it and you're applying it correctly all of a sudden what happens they're an adult now and you get to sit at the adults table and when the adults are talking about adult things you get to sit and you even get to talk after a while and you're in church and you're in your jobs and you're paying ties and guess what you get to decide who the minister is going to be you get to vote on things you get to have a voice in these things why because you prove by your life you've proved by your actions you've proved by your application I am an adult and we start to look at that and we rejoice in it you know talking to brother Bob and brother Mark about when Joe and Matt and these different ones became deacons they loved it because it reduced the load on them but it was also an appreciation for the fact that they were men they were sons of God that were willing to step into position and take responsibility in the kingdom of God for the saints of God it's a wonderful thing to see and this is what adoption looks like as God says the holy spirit says they're stepping into the needs without somebody having to tell them the most wonderful thing a pastor can have is people that see the need and do it without him having to ask them and we got a church full of people that do it and it's a wonderful thing but when you see people saying I've been trained to do it I've been taught how to do it I've passed the test I can do it and you just go and do it it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing and that's what the holy spirit is saying is it's saying they do what I've taught them now they don't just know it but they do it in everyday life regardless of what people think or say about them look at this final Final witness as we start to close brother says now he's talking to Israel the spiritual Israel who has possessed the land he says oh aren't you glad you come out of Egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're out of the Wilderness and remember they had to eat Mana Angel's food out of Heaven until they crossed over into the land and when they crossed over into the land the Manna ceased to fall they were fully matured then and they eat the old corn of the land he says now now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not Desiring the sincere milk of the Gospel that you don't have to be babied and padded and persuaded to come to church now that you're real fully mature Christians you're ready to eat strong Meats now you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and Rich he says oh we'll get into it directly and we will he says and oh it's been hidden since the foundation of the world what is it you can handle real food now I was listening to brother Ron Spencer earlier today and he was preaching at the people and he was preaching at the people and he was preaching other people not in the hard way and you know what they were saying amen praise the Lord preach it brother when God gets personal we say do it again when God comes he starts putting fingers in her life we say do it again do it some more Lord that's right now I know you're here now I know you're talking to me what is it you can handle strong meat you can handle a personal impact on your life and it's not just general anymore it's not we now it's you and you and you and you and me that's what they can handle and then they can start to get into the depths because God can take away the little stuff I say little stuff that's what it is in God's eyes little stuff it's big in our eyes it's little to him and then he can start to get in and really start molding and shaping you and working you into that image that he was looking for you're ready for something now you'll respond the right way you don't get hurt you don't get offended easily you're matured you're seasoned you're a warrior now you've got an adult Christian body if I can put it that way and you need real meat remember Paul said forgetting that the doctrines and the this and that the other let us go on to Perfection what is it you need solid meat now and it's not just doctrinal meat it's work it's kingdom of God work it's positional placing it's stepping into something that you're built for exactly it's not that you don't have milk from time to time we all drink milk milk's good for cereal and for brownies and cookies it's not that we don't use milk from time to time but now you need steak you need chicken you need tofu you need something that really can satisfy you and it's not just going to be these little things anymore and you'll see it in in in Believers that are growing quickly and what happens is they're okay to sit and listen they're okay to sit there and have something brought to them but after a while they start to say okay now I'm ready to do something with it that's how you know your kids are growing up is they want to start doing they want to start helping they want to start being apart and as they grow and they gain these these skills and they learn these lessons then they're ready for that strong meat and all of a sudden they're strong enough and they're they're they've got the training and they've proved themselves and you start saying okay now you can do something now you can mow the lawn if I'm not at the house now you can start it and gas it up now you can drive to the drive Mama to the store to get groceries or you can go get them yourself now I don't have to be along anymore why you've you're ready for something that is a real impact in your family real impact in the kingdom of God brother Brian would finish with this he says now that you've come into this I'm addressing this to you not to those who have just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land that have received the promised he said how many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost if you can't raise your hand and say that tonight go back don't move forward because you'll fall flat on your face because Brian brother Brown would say in that land he says it would prove one thing that it must be a perfect walk you must be led by the spirit of God that's the only way you can have a perfect walk is we're going to talk about later so you've got to have the Holy Spirit you've got to know you've got the holy spirit it's got to be settled it's got to be anchored it has to be in a place where you can't be touched nothing can be removed you've got to know you've got the Holy Ghost Church he says oh aren't you glad you're in the land over here now eating the old corn eating the strong things of God and God a clear understanding he says your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believed and you're persuaded that he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against that day I mean God bless you let's Stand Together I was talking to some of the brothers earlier they said you know are you going to keep going on Redemption and I said well everything's Redemption you can tie it back but I said once you get into the promised land then it just starts to go because you've got adoption you also have the marriage of the Lamb you've got the invisible Union you've got positional placing you've got the title deed you've got all these different thoughts that are encompassed in this idea of going into Canaan of being in the Holy Ghost and these different things so I'm not actually sure where we'll go for Sunday and you pray for me to see which direction it takes but there's so much there they're saying that there's a brother that that told Brother Gerald one time he says I don't have anything left to preach on that's not a problem the problem is not what do I it's what do I preach on not and where do I start because it's so much that it's so rich there's so much depth there's so much breadth to it and like I said just on this this series of notes I've got 20 odd Pages still left that I I'm just going to have to kind of put away and just move on by God's grace but just trusting him to lead us amen that we've got young people here we've got seasoned people we've got middle-aged people we've got young couples we've got older couples we've got people at work we've got people in the home and everybody needs something different not everybody can eat steak and not everybody can drink milk but that doesn't mean we don't have milk in the services and we don't have steak in the services and everything in between so I need God to leave me in that amen I don't want to preach so high that we get depressed or dismayed or despondent because we don't we're not matching up to what brother John preaches about well listen I don't either half the time but I don't want to drag people down but I also don't want to give us a bunch of a bunch of soft food either but we've got young people in our midst we've got young people that have just been baptized a year too maybe three and they need that stuff and so it's a full body and we've got to feed all of them Jesus said to Peter he says do you love me he said yes feed my sheep feed my sheep and they says feed my Lambs so there's a feeding that has to go on for the whole bride amen so you pray for me and trust that the Lord will lead me that these will be a blessing to each one that's here that each one of us will get the revelation we need to move forward because it's going to take God it can't just be me up here just reciting quotes and scriptures and these things but it's going to take the Holy Spirit to Quicken it into our young people's lives that's that's the greatest thing is get the Holy Ghost let's if there's one thing that I ever achieve as a pastor is to bring somebody to a true New Birth that it makes it all worth it it makes it all worth it what happens after that doesn't matter so much but get our young people to a new birth get out get our older people to a new birth brother Bradham had people that had served the the good old Christian way for 30 and 40 years and they never got the Holy Ghost until then we can't presume on these things but we've got to know we've got to have an anchor we've got a tie post brother Brandon would say that holds Us in these times that I am sealed into the day of my full Redemption amen amen but I want to come to a place and I believe we're each one going to come to a place true Sons and Daughters of God where we're so surrendered brother Brown has a quote he says where the devil doesn't know what to do with us doesn't know what to do with us I'd like to have a testimony this week the devil didn't know what to do with me he came and he tried and he walked away and he was the most frustrated devil that we've ever seen in a while because he tried something and it didn't work and he tried another thing and it didn't work and he tried another thing that didn't work why because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world Amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord we want to press on Lord we want to keep fighting the good fight Lord we want to surrender Lord we want to Humble ourselves to your word but Lord that's what we can do Lord but it takes a work of you in our lives Lord it takes a lord a baptism and then a re-baptism and a refilling and a refilling Lord it takes a constant washing of Water by the word Lord help us to lay our focus on that Lord let us lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us Lord let us lay before you Lord let us stay in your presence let us seek it Lord let us fight for that Lord to get away from all these things that would hold us back Lord would you lift us up higher we pray Lord let our testimony by the Holy Spirit Lord be one that pleases you we ask Lord each day a little higher each day a little further
