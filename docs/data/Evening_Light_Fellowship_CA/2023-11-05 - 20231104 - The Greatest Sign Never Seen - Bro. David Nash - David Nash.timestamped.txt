[51:08] expecting and been fellowshipping a
[51:10] little bit with Brother David he's you
[51:12] know studying a bit and fellowship a bit
[51:14] in these things and you know I'm just
[51:16] trusting for good things tonight and you
[51:18] know you think about what he was talking
[51:20] about last night and I was talking to
[51:21] him and I said you could have gone so
[51:23] many ways and so many directions and
[51:25] what he's preaching is a bride message
[51:27] because remember what brother Bram said
[51:28] he says when the bride recognizes who
[51:30] she is the rapture will go and you know
[51:34] what he was telling us is he says you're
[51:35] written in the word and the word is
[51:37] coming out through your life whether you
[51:40] realize it or not whether you can place
[51:43] it or not in the moment God has
[51:44] orchestrated Our Lives to produce the
[51:47] word amen and whether we understand it
[51:49] and whether we we we're in the moment or
[51:51] not yet God is doing it and whether it's
[51:54] in David's life whether it's in in
[51:55] Jonah's life Jonah looked like he was
[51:57] all out of kilter but brother bam says
[51:59] God knew his prophet he knew what he
[52:01] would do and he orchestrated events to
[52:03] turn that disobedient that unhappy
[52:05] Prophet into a sign and a Wonder for the
[52:07] message that he was supposed to give to
[52:08] a people and they received him because
[52:11] of his Disobedience not despite it amen
[52:13] it's a wonderful thing amen I want to
[52:15] come higher into into Christ amen I want
[52:17] to step out of this world I want to step
[52:19] out of this flesh and say Lord let your
[52:21] word live in my life let me see it but
[52:24] regardless let me have faith that when
[52:25] you're working in my life that it is you
[52:27] that's working and it's not just
[52:29] happenstance or circumstance amen amen I
[52:32] I want to apologize to Brother David we
[52:33] had told him 620 we were going to leave
[52:35] for church and just a bit of a brain
[52:37] fart so we put him under a bit of
[52:39] pressure there and so we gave him a bit
[52:41] more extra time tonight but there's no
[52:43] pressure brother there's no pressure
[52:44] we're coming expecting the good things
[52:46] and God will answer and he'll come on
[52:48] the scene every time amen so let's just
[52:50] keep him in prayer as he comes I'm going
[52:52] to ask us to sing that song 11:29 I need

[54:40] gracious heavenly
[54:41] father in his
[54:48] time in

[56:27] gracious Heavenly Father you have
[56:30] heard through song which has been said
[56:34] to be
[56:35] prophecy you have heard these people
[56:38] prophesy tonight
[56:40] Lord that all things are made beautiful
[56:43] through your
[56:44] time and how that in their lives they
[56:47] want to
[56:48] express in the song of Our Lives Lord
[56:53] God we want want to express
[56:56] you we want to express your love your
[56:59] command Lord as it
[57:02] were Lord over all the Ws of the devil
[57:06] all over over all of the the sins of the
[57:10] flesh over anything Lord that would
[57:13] stand between us and
[57:15] you that's my prophecy tonight Lord
[57:18] that's the prophecy of this congregation
[57:21] who has come sacrific their Time Lord
[57:25] sacrificed their lives to be here this
[57:27] evening that they might hear something
[57:30] from
[57:31] you so I'm asking you just get me out of
[57:35] the way
[57:36] Lord Jesus just get me out of the way
[57:40] that they might hear
[57:42] something that if you would grant us the
[57:44] time that we might leave again these
[57:48] doors their lives would go out emanating
[57:52] Christ to a dying generation to a Dying
[57:55] World that you might be honored and
[57:59] glorified with every heart and every
[58:02] Life In The Name of Jesus
[58:06] Christ
[58:08] amen praise the Lord I love
[58:11] you and I'm not afraid to say
[58:15] it and uh thank each and every one of
[58:18] you tonight I uh for coming out we uh
[58:22] understand there's the the sniffles
[58:24] going around and the flu and whatever it
[58:26] is and but God knows all about those
[58:29] things and he has reasons for it
[58:33] and I must admit that I thought we were
[58:36] going to go a certain direction as we
[58:38] were talking last night there about the
[58:41] seed of David and and mentioned the Seed
[58:43] of Abraham but we may have to wait for
[58:46] that one
[58:47] brother for at least until tomorrow
[58:50] we'll see but I I as we felt the Lord
[58:54] start to pull us a different direction I
[58:56] thought it was interesting cuz uh a
[58:59] sister there at home mentioned the
[59:02] prophet Jonah and then as uh brother
[59:06] Jonathan gets up the two that he
[59:07] mentions the second one was of course
[59:09] Jonah and I'm going well
[59:12] Lord you know what you're doing and so
[59:15] here we are and let's turn as it
[59:18] were get back on the right page
[59:23] here
[59:27] but let's turn first to the prophet
[59:30] Isaiah and it's the seventh
[59:34] chapter and we'll read the 10th through
[59:37] the 14th verse Lord
[59:50] willing do you love the Lord tonight I
[59:53] know you do and that was Sister a
[59:56] beautiful testimony in that
[59:59] song and in this
[1:00:01] particular verse that we shall read
[1:00:04] first uh it's a king and he's of course
[1:00:09] ruler over a nation and and the God and
[1:00:12] and God challenges him to do
[1:00:15] something and I'm sure you've heard
[1:00:19] these things before they're not new to
[1:00:21] you and uh starting there with the uh
[1:00:26] 10th
[1:00:28] verse and moreover the Lord spake again
[1:00:31] unto ahaz saying ask thee a sign of the
[1:00:35] Lord thy God ask it either in the depth
[1:00:38] or in the height above but ahaz said I
[1:00:41] will not ask neither will I tempt the
[1:00:44] Lord and he said hear ye now oh House of
[1:00:47] David it is a small thing or is it a
[1:00:50] small thing for you to weary men but
[1:00:53] will you also weary my God therefore the
[1:00:56] Lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:00:59] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:01:02] a son and shall call his name
[1:01:07] Emmanuel butter and honey shall he eat
[1:01:10] that he may know to refuse evil and to
[1:01:13] choose good so then let's turn on over
[1:01:17] so he's God has challenged him to a sign
[1:01:21] and he said I'm not going to I'm not
[1:01:23] going to do it but God says that's all
[1:01:24] right I'm going to give you one anyway
[1:01:27] so it really doesn't matter sometimes
[1:01:30] whether we respond or whether we
[1:01:32] don't and so then in Matthew the 12th
[1:01:41] chapter and this is a place where uh
[1:01:46] he's been speaking to the scribes and
[1:01:48] Pharisees and uh they're not always the
[1:01:53] most kind people to him of
[1:01:56] course and at this point he comes down
[1:01:59] in the 38th verse they're kind of
[1:02:03] demanding to him it says then certain of
[1:02:05] the scribes and Pharisees answered
[1:02:07] saying Master we would see a sign from
[1:02:11] thee but he answered and said unto them
[1:02:13] an evil and an adulterous generation
[1:02:15] seeks after a sign and there shall be no
[1:02:19] sign given it but the sign of the
[1:02:22] Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three
[1:02:24] days and three nights in the whale's
[1:02:26] belly so shall the son of man be three
[1:02:28] days and three nights in the heart of
[1:02:30] the earth gracious Heavenly Father we've
[1:02:33] read your
[1:02:36] word Lord you know what direction you're
[1:02:38] wanting to go with this and I'm standing
[1:02:42] here as your representative and so what
[1:02:44] I'm asking is you get me completely out
[1:02:46] of the way that you speak to your people
[1:02:49] for your honor and glory and for our
[1:02:52] service to thee in Jesus name
[1:02:54] amen please be
[1:02:58] seated and before we
[1:03:00] start it's kind of along the same theme
[1:03:03] that we were speaking about last night
[1:03:05] and and how that every scripture there's
[1:03:08] different
[1:03:09] levels there's the fleshly level there's
[1:03:12] the spirit level there's the the soul
[1:03:14] level or the nature that's behind the
[1:03:17] scripture and then there's also a
[1:03:20] life that comes from that that's
[1:03:23] displayed through that nature and I like
[1:03:25] to give this as an
[1:03:27] example we have this there's many places
[1:03:30] in the scripture where you'll find then
[1:03:33] it when it talks about the scripture
[1:03:35] it'll say the scripture can be
[1:03:37] transitive and intransitive or
[1:03:40] intransitive and it comes from the
[1:03:43] original uh as it were the the text of
[1:03:48] the word trans which means simply to
[1:03:51] move we use it for transportation for
[1:03:55] uh you know a lot of different ways that
[1:03:58] we use it transition which means you're
[1:04:00] moving in or through a certain thing and
[1:04:03] and so that word is used a lot and so
[1:04:06] when we're talking about scripture and
[1:04:08] if it's
[1:04:10] transitive it means it contains
[1:04:14] something in that scripture that's going
[1:04:18] to be moved or it can be moved and it
[1:04:20] can be moved from one place to another
[1:04:23] as I move the water from there to there
[1:04:25] and we can move it over here so the
[1:04:27] water is
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:30] moving and
[1:04:33] so but it's being carried in this bottle
[1:04:35] and that's kind of like the the natural
[1:04:38] part of the scripture we are carrying a
[1:04:41] certain thing within us if we're born
[1:04:44] again again Christians we are carriers
[1:04:47] of whatever is inside of us and if
[1:04:49] you're born again Christ is inside of us
[1:04:52] so we can move this it's transitive I'm
[1:04:55] moving it all over the place but if we
[1:04:57] take the lid
[1:04:59] off we can take it and we can take part
[1:05:03] of the
[1:05:07] contents it's good thank you
[1:05:11] brother now I moved the
[1:05:15] contents from the
[1:05:17] bottle into me but where did it go I
[1:05:21] mean really where did the contents go
[1:05:24] well brother it went into you but
[1:05:26] there's
[1:05:27] more than that because now the
[1:05:32] contents that I
[1:05:34] consumed have become a part of
[1:05:38] me those contents and you know just
[1:05:41] because it tastes so good and I kind of
[1:05:43] need it for a dry
[1:05:47] throat those contents have be become
[1:05:49] part of
[1:05:51] me
[1:05:53] and I have become part of
[1:05:56] them because the human being cannot live
[1:05:59] without water there's another thing and
[1:06:02] even another level then that goes with
[1:06:04] that because not only did I consume the
[1:06:07] contents of the water but the life that
[1:06:12] is provided into Waters through into
[1:06:15] human beings came with
[1:06:18] it so the life that is behind this water
[1:06:22] was just moved where it became
[1:06:25] transitive to
[1:06:27] me and the life came with it you can't
[1:06:30] see
[1:06:32] it I can't really even feel it but that
[1:06:35] life came into me without feeling
[1:06:37] without I mean yeah I tasted the water
[1:06:40] that part of it but the life behind it
[1:06:44] is the Unseen
[1:06:46] portion and many many things in the
[1:06:49] scripture are that particular way let's
[1:06:53] look at
[1:06:55] because it became
[1:06:57] transitive so let's look at this
[1:07:00] according to Isaiah
[1:07:02] there
[1:07:04] uh we'll go to Luke the first
[1:07:10] chapter and watch how God moves his life
[1:07:14] from the
[1:07:16] scripture into human beings and if we
[1:07:19] were to the brother asked me last night
[1:07:21] for a title on last night's message we
[1:07:23] just
[1:07:25] the seed of David I suppose and tonight
[1:07:29] I would give
[1:07:31] it a name just so it can jog into your
[1:07:36] memory the greatest sign never
[1:07:40] seen and how
[1:07:43] that
[1:07:45] uh he also mentions in Isaiah Behold a
[1:07:49] virgin shall conceive and that's or
[1:07:51] that's the one that we read and there's
[1:07:53] another place in Isaiah that it talks
[1:07:55] about it but in Luke the 1 chapter we
[1:07:58] start down about the 26th verse because
[1:08:00] it takes on a carrier just like the
[1:08:06] bottle is a carrier of this water and so
[1:08:09] there there in verse 26 and it says and
[1:08:12] in the sixth month Luke 1 and 26 in the
[1:08:15] sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent
[1:08:18] from God unto the city of Galilee named
[1:08:21] Nazareth so now God has given a
[1:08:24] particular bottle to be the carrier of
[1:08:28] his word so God is sending this Angel as
[1:08:32] it were uh Gabriel to Galilee which is
[1:08:36] named Nazareth to a virgin esposed to a
[1:08:39] man whose name was Joseph of the House
[1:08:41] of David so we see like we talked about
[1:08:44] last night that
[1:08:47] the that bloodline ran up to a certain
[1:08:50] place and it comes up to the house of
[1:08:52] Joseph but that Joseph had no physical
[1:08:56] part in the birth of
[1:08:58] Jesus he was just he also was a carrier
[1:09:03] of the seed or of the promise that was
[1:09:05] unto Judah and so as the carrier of that
[1:09:10] God comes to
[1:09:11] this and he sends this
[1:09:14] Angel uh to a virgin that has been
[1:09:17] espoused or to be the wife of Joseph of
[1:09:21] the House of David and the virgin's name
[1:09:23] wasy Mary and the angel came in unto her
[1:09:26] and said hail Thou Art highly favored
[1:09:28] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[1:09:30] among women so this Angel is now
[1:09:33] delivering the life of God that's in the
[1:09:37] carrier of
[1:09:39] Gabriel and he's delivering this life
[1:09:41] he's delivering these words to
[1:09:45] her and
[1:09:48] uh highly favored among women so on and
[1:09:51] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[1:09:53] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[1:09:56] of salutation is this so she's got
[1:09:59] things going in her mind like whoa
[1:10:01] what's happening now that's would be you
[1:10:04] know the modern way of saying what just
[1:10:06] happened here and she's listening to
[1:10:09] this Angel it's not you know probably
[1:10:10] wasn't a real common thing for her to be
[1:10:12] seeing Angels it's most people don't
[1:10:16] catch him very often and and so she is
[1:10:19] being troubled in her mind about this it
[1:10:22] says she was trou
[1:10:24] L and when she at this saying and that's
[1:10:29] that's that's going on in her mind and
[1:10:30] what what is the Sal what is this all
[1:10:32] about but watch what the
[1:10:35] angel
[1:10:37] recognizing her being troubled at this
[1:10:41] he recognizes it as fear because he
[1:10:45] immediately says unto her uh and the
[1:10:49] angel says unto her fear not Mary for
[1:10:53] thou Hast found favor with God so we see
[1:10:58] immediately that the the Discerning
[1:11:01] Spirit of the Holy Ghost is in the in
[1:11:04] this Angel because in Hebrews 4 the holy
[1:11:07] spirit is the discerner of the thoughts
[1:11:09] and intense of the heart all it said
[1:11:12] that that she was troubled but the real
[1:11:14] thing behind the troubling was that she
[1:11:17] was
[1:11:18] afraid she was in fear of this Angel and
[1:11:22] what does he do remember God is a
[1:11:24] Creator in the beginning God created we
[1:11:27] talked about the light behind that when
[1:11:30] he speaks to her fear not what's
[1:11:34] happening God is speaking the fear out
[1:11:38] of
[1:11:39] existence for that sister she's our
[1:11:43] sister you'll get a meter one of these
[1:11:47] days and so he's speaking the fear away
[1:11:51] and uh fear not you found favor with God
[1:11:56] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:11:58] womb and bring forth the son and shall
[1:11:59] call his name
[1:12:02] Jesus and then he begins to give a
[1:12:06] description of the power of creation the
[1:12:10] power of God that's going to come forth
[1:12:13] to her in her womb and this power of
[1:12:17] creation is going to bring forth he says
[1:12:20] you're going to conceive in your womb
[1:12:21] you're going to bring forth a son his
[1:12:23] name was Jesus and and he'll be great
[1:12:25] he's the he's called the high the son of
[1:12:27] the highest the Lord God uh or and the
[1:12:30] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[1:12:32] of his father David so he's prophesying
[1:12:35] these different
[1:12:37] things and even as David was we talked
[1:12:40] about last night when the anointing came
[1:12:42] and created him as king God in him as
[1:12:46] king it took many years many struggles
[1:12:48] many
[1:12:50] trials before he actually took that
[1:12:52] throne
[1:12:54] and so here it is and he shall reign
[1:12:56] over the house he's going to take the
[1:12:58] Throne of his father David he shall
[1:13:00] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[1:13:02] the kingdom of his iners shall be no
[1:13:04] away and so he's giving this description
[1:13:07] these different pieces of what the word
[1:13:10] of the Lord is going to place in her
[1:13:18] womb he said it's the greatest it's the
[1:13:22] greatest sign
[1:13:24] and yet it's going to be so small and
[1:13:27] Mary said unto him you
[1:13:30] know he says H H how can this be how
[1:13:33] shall this be knowing I don't know a man
[1:13:36] I don't I don't I've never been with a
[1:13:39] man that I can receive
[1:13:42] this in the normal way and the angel
[1:13:45] answered her and said the Holy Ghost
[1:13:47] shall come upon thee and the power of
[1:13:49] the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:13:52] therefore also that Holy thing which
[1:13:54] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:13:57] The Son of
[1:13:59] God so what again what just happened
[1:14:04] here we see that God sent a special
[1:14:08] carrier a
[1:14:10] Gabriel and he has within him the word
[1:14:13] of the Lord and this Angel messenger
[1:14:17] that comes forth from Heaven is going to
[1:14:20] open the bottle as it were on the word
[1:14:24] of God and said hey Mary he brought it
[1:14:27] to the right
[1:14:28] people friends we have heard from an
[1:14:31] angel
[1:14:34] messenger and it came with a special
[1:14:36] message that's in a
[1:14:38] bottle that we call the word of God and
[1:14:42] part of that bottle you know this is uh
[1:14:45] we were talking I think last night I've
[1:14:48] been accused of I don't read enough
[1:14:50] quotes So I you know I kind of thought
[1:14:53] wow I really don't read very many I I
[1:14:56] listen to them and a lot of times I
[1:14:58] don't even write them down I'll just
[1:14:59] write maybe the tape that they were on
[1:15:01] and y'all have the tape so you can go
[1:15:03] back and listen and so on the next place
[1:15:07] I went to Brother Rich Cobbs and I told
[1:15:10] him I said I got accused of not reading
[1:15:12] any quotes so tonight I'm going to read
[1:15:13] 13,000
[1:15:15] quotes they all you everybody's
[1:15:18] like I said seriously and so I just
[1:15:21] opened one of the message books and read
[1:15:23] the word
[1:15:25] Bible because brother brandham used that
[1:15:27] word
[1:15:28] 13,000
[1:15:30] times and if you run it up want to run
[1:15:33] it up over 16,000 add the word the
[1:15:36] little letter S on the end
[1:15:38] Bibles so that should tell us what the
[1:15:41] carrier of the message of the hour
[1:15:46] is and it came through a special
[1:15:50] vessel but what's in the vessel was the
[1:15:54] carrier brought to us so
[1:15:58] that the life can can come into
[1:16:03] us by means of the I'll in this case
[1:16:07] I'll use the
[1:16:08] carriers because God the word of God
[1:16:11] comes to the
[1:16:12] prophet and he opened the
[1:16:15] lid said after the seals this is a new
[1:16:18] book and every scripture can somehow
[1:16:20] point us to Jesus Christ there's tons of
[1:16:24] them I couldn't even begin to tell you
[1:16:25] how it does it I read it and read it and
[1:16:27] scratch my head and go I don't know
[1:16:30] Lord but the life is
[1:16:32] there and so he has come and he's said
[1:16:35] these things to Mary and the life now
[1:16:40] think about this this is you know the
[1:16:42] great sign that's spoken of by Isaiah
[1:16:46] and he's he you know Behold a virgin con
[1:16:49] shall conceive and I think it's the 53rd
[1:16:51] chapter and he where he talks about all
[1:16:54] the different things that come with that
[1:16:57] anointing that and that come with that
[1:16:59] and how that here is this great
[1:17:02] tremendous sign from God and nobody can
[1:17:05] see it not even
[1:17:08] Mary and she received
[1:17:11] it how many things do we receive from
[1:17:14] God that we can't even
[1:17:17] see nobody could see
[1:17:20] it because it was in the womb her
[1:17:23] natural
[1:17:25] womb and we've heard brother bandam talk
[1:17:28] about how the great Jehovah God and all
[1:17:30] the things he made and all this he said
[1:17:32] he became so
[1:17:34] small he became as it were a single cell
[1:17:38] in the womb of a woman and this is the
[1:17:41] greatest sign that there would ever be
[1:17:44] and nobody can see
[1:17:46] it not even the
[1:17:49] carrier now as that seed began to man
[1:17:53] manifest and those cells began to
[1:17:56] multiply and pretty soon Mary couldn't
[1:17:59] even hide it anymore in fact they're
[1:18:01] saying that she's a bad woman because
[1:18:04] look at that stomach and that's not
[1:18:06] normal to and that's how rumors get
[1:18:10] started as people start looking at you
[1:18:15] know by
[1:18:16] eyesight and uh they were looking at her
[1:18:19] and wow she's had not been with her
[1:18:21] husband it was probably a soldier all
[1:18:23] the things that went it there is a
[1:18:27] reproach for bearing the unseed word
[1:18:31] friends so if you're suffering maybe on
[1:18:34] the job or maybe from your neighbors or
[1:18:37] maybe even within your own family
[1:18:41] sometimes it's a reproach for the word
[1:18:44] of God for a word that they can't even
[1:18:48] see but they're starting to see a
[1:18:50] manifestation in your life it's like
[1:18:53] I remember I was hadn't been serving the
[1:18:56] lord too long and uh I was in college at
[1:19:00] the time and I'd been taking a a
[1:19:02] psychology class and this teacher oh I
[1:19:07] was the big antagonist you know I was
[1:19:09] the rock and roll bum and and the the
[1:19:12] hippie and so forth and so I had all
[1:19:15] this well in the meantime but you know
[1:19:17] over a certain amount of time
[1:19:19] there the Lord came and manifested
[1:19:22] himself to me and I got saved what we
[1:19:24] call got saved and that last term in
[1:19:28] college he goes what in the world has
[1:19:31] happened to you and it began to be
[1:19:34] because he he got very antagonistic
[1:19:36] because that the change was so dramatic
[1:19:39] between fall and spring he goes you are
[1:19:43] like Dr Jackal and Mr Hyde I said all I
[1:19:47] know is I got
[1:19:48] saved and so there was a reproach with
[1:19:51] that and even some of my my friends uh
[1:19:55] remember we went to a concert one night
[1:19:56] and there was a young woman and I I had
[1:19:58] graduated from high school with her but
[1:20:00] I hadn't seen her for a long time and we
[1:20:03] went to a folk concert and she was there
[1:20:06] and after the concert everybody was
[1:20:08] clearing out and she just stopped and
[1:20:10] looked at me and she goes what happened
[1:20:12] to
[1:20:13] you and I said you know what are you
[1:20:16] talking about she goes she goes I was
[1:20:19] sitting here looking around and she goes
[1:20:21] you are the only person in this entire
[1:20:24] Auditorium that has peace in your
[1:20:27] life and I said well it's
[1:20:30] Jesus because it
[1:20:33] was and it becomes
[1:20:35] evident because I wasn't I hadn't even
[1:20:38] said anything to her about the Lord but
[1:20:40] she could feel that
[1:20:42] presence and there was a reproach but in
[1:20:45] her case she said tell me about
[1:20:49] it so I mean you have different ways but
[1:20:52] even though that life is growing and
[1:20:55] it's growing we we we bear a reproach
[1:20:58] for many of those things and how did uh
[1:21:03] it comes
[1:21:05] unseen it's the greatest sign that ever
[1:21:08] was and yet it comes in an unseen
[1:21:11] fashion in in something
[1:21:14] that can't see it can't taste it can't
[1:21:17] hear it can't smell it but it's a life
[1:21:20] that begins to come forth from the
[1:21:23] interior of the believer because just
[1:21:26] like the Holy Ghost overshadowed her in
[1:21:30] her womb and it brought forth Christ so
[1:21:33] does the holy ghost in your
[1:21:36] life there will be times when friends I
[1:21:39] got to be honest I don't feel
[1:21:42] it sometimes there's that you know those
[1:21:44] things that go through our heads because
[1:21:46] that's the Battleground well how can you
[1:21:48] even be saved look what you just did
[1:21:50] it's
[1:21:51] like H well that's when we have to go
[1:21:55] back to the very word that we came Born
[1:21:57] Again by and say all I know is he said
[1:22:01] he will never leave me nor forsake me
[1:22:05] that's all I can say Satan he will never
[1:22:08] Le me nor forsake me because I know I
[1:22:13] came according to his sacrifice I like
[1:22:16] to think of of
[1:22:18] job because
[1:22:21] uh job you know he was he had words over
[1:22:25] his life that God had spoken he's
[1:22:28] perfect he hates sin and the different
[1:22:30] things that God had spoken about him and
[1:22:33] how then Satan came and took away his
[1:22:37] life and his F you know his his family
[1:22:39] and his oxen and all this stuff and he
[1:22:42] comes down and and then the second time
[1:22:44] when Satan comes back he takes away his
[1:22:47] health his health just becomes so
[1:22:49] miserable and so terrible even his
[1:22:51] friends when it says said they St saw
[1:22:53] him they stood a far off they couldn't
[1:22:55] even recognize him there will be times
[1:22:59] in your life when your Christian
[1:23:01] brothers and sisters may not even be
[1:23:03] able to recognize
[1:23:05] you because of something that God has
[1:23:09] allowed to come in your
[1:23:10] life and it'll be a reproach because he
[1:23:15] was reproached for us and some of us
[1:23:18] have
[1:23:19] to be exposed to reproach ourselves to
[1:23:23] understand the gospel living in us and
[1:23:27] but the thing that he did and this
[1:23:28] always amazed me for a long time I
[1:23:30] wondered why you know if it was me and I
[1:23:33] had think about this boils from the top
[1:23:35] of his head to the bottom of his
[1:23:38] feet so he's having trouble walking
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:51] oh said he had him
[1:23:54] everywhere he couldn't even and so he
[1:23:56] goes to the ash Heap I'm just thinking
[1:23:59] is a natural
[1:24:01] man I would be looking for a creek to
[1:24:03] get into something cold with some nice
[1:24:06] you know maybe some mud to get rid of
[1:24:09] the the problem but job went to the ash
[1:24:13] sheep did you ever think about what
[1:24:16] those ashes represented and why did job
[1:24:19] go
[1:24:20] there because job knew he had made the
[1:24:24] sacrifice he knew that he had met God's
[1:24:29] requirement if you have met God's
[1:24:33] requirement you have said Lord here am I
[1:24:36] take my heart who soever calleth on the
[1:24:39] name of the Lord shall be
[1:24:42] saved that's the word of the Lord to you
[1:24:46] and he had made that sacrifice over
[1:24:48] himself over his family his children all
[1:24:52] of those those things and the the end of
[1:24:55] the sacrifice if you remember we don't
[1:24:58] it doesn't really show up until
[1:24:59] Leviticus but after the
[1:25:02] sacrifice was all
[1:25:04] completed the priest would change his
[1:25:08] garments and take the ashes from the
[1:25:12] sacrifice outside the gate and they had
[1:25:16] a special place where they would dump
[1:25:18] those ashes
[1:25:20] out job went to the only thing that he
[1:25:24] had
[1:25:25] left the only thing that he had left
[1:25:30] that showed him I have met God's
[1:25:37] requirement and the only thing sometimes
[1:25:40] we have
[1:25:42] left is the word of God that he spoke to
[1:25:45] us and job laid down in those
[1:25:49] ashes and in those ashes it said he
[1:25:51] pickpick picked up a a broken piece of a
[1:25:54] pot and he began to scrape those
[1:25:58] sores who is the broken
[1:26:00] pot it's Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ and he's scraping his sores with
[1:26:07] the broken
[1:26:09] vessel with the
[1:26:11] ashes that he said I know i' met God's
[1:26:16] requirement and here is my
[1:26:21] evidence
[1:26:22] it's all Jesus Christ
[1:26:25] friends and
[1:26:27] so we see this sign and how it's
[1:26:30] manifested and it's it's the greatest
[1:26:32] sign and it's not even seen we see the
[1:26:35] evidence of it that comes forth after
[1:26:38] the fact if you you want to put it that
[1:26:40] way you know cuz she here she re the
[1:26:43] Holy Ghost overshadows her and it brings
[1:26:45] forth an Evidence in her
[1:26:48] life that nobody can see and they still
[1:26:51] couldn't see it until the actual birth
[1:26:53] came about and then it's like here's
[1:26:55] this baby and and
[1:26:59] it's it's a
[1:27:01] baby and they're looking for a messiah
[1:27:04] brother brand said that those priests
[1:27:05] and stuff were looking for the Messiah
[1:27:07] to come down in a great you know Cloud
[1:27:09] out of the sky and roll out the carpets
[1:27:12] and all those things and here it comes
[1:27:14] forth as a
[1:27:15] baby it's just a simple
[1:27:19] child and she's holding it in her arms
[1:27:22] and wraps it in those swaddling clothes
[1:27:24] like we talked about the sword last
[1:27:26] night and she wraps that baby and here
[1:27:29] is the sign this is the sword of the
[1:27:34] Lord as a
[1:27:36] child and how
[1:27:39] that I stand
[1:27:41] amazed and how that the Shepherds came
[1:27:44] and wonder what she thought about that
[1:27:46] here she's just had this baby and now
[1:27:48] she's got a house full of company that
[1:27:50] just not even her house it's a barn
[1:27:52] and here these people are showing up and
[1:27:54] you know they want to look at her baby
[1:27:56] and it's like dude I don't know about
[1:27:58] you sisters but but what are you guys
[1:28:01] doing here and I'm just that's the
[1:28:05] natural side my thoughts on it and how
[1:28:08] that it was the sign of God for
[1:28:14] salvation unto
[1:28:16] Mankind and it was his name Shall be
[1:28:19] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:28:21] God the Everlasting
[1:28:24] father the prince of peace and she's
[1:28:26] holding it in her hands just a little
[1:28:32] baby you think they could see it as the
[1:28:35] potential is what it really was no they
[1:28:38] had to look at it as wow it's just it's
[1:28:42] just a little
[1:28:44] kid but because the angel had spoken to
[1:28:47] them in a certain way they realized you
[1:28:49] know they went there looking for a
[1:28:51] potential and they they went wow that's
[1:28:54] the Messiah and even when they went to
[1:28:56] have the baby
[1:28:59] circumcised a blind
[1:29:03] propheus I believe it was it was the e
[1:29:05] was what either the prophet or the
[1:29:07] prophetess well I think it was the
[1:29:09] prophetes was
[1:29:11] blind they she was in the temple that
[1:29:14] day and and here they come with this
[1:29:18] baby it's only 8 days old and they come
[1:29:21] down to the temple and as they're
[1:29:23] they're in the
[1:29:24] temple the one the the male prophet
[1:29:28] he God had directed him to the T there's
[1:29:32] hundreds of people in there and they're
[1:29:34] getting their babies dedicated and
[1:29:35] everybody's doing their thing and and
[1:29:38] this one fellow God arises him by
[1:29:42] the by the Holy Ghost to go and see to
[1:29:46] look upon on this
[1:29:47] child This Little Child because God had
[1:29:51] had showed him he he said that he would
[1:29:55] see the Lord's
[1:29:57] Redemption before he died he was an old
[1:30:01] man and he held the little child said
[1:30:04] this is my
[1:30:07] Redemption just think of the reality of
[1:30:10] that and yet he knew and he so much that
[1:30:14] he said let your servant depart in peace
[1:30:17] because he had seen the potential behind
[1:30:21] every word spoken in that old Torah
[1:30:25] concerning the
[1:30:27] Messiah to
[1:30:29] Israel and he said
[1:30:31] okay let your servant depart in in peace
[1:30:35] I have seen the salvation of our God and
[1:30:39] here's a blind prophetes brother manam
[1:30:42] talked about she's feeling her way along
[1:30:44] the
[1:30:48] wall and she
[1:30:50] turns and there's the
[1:30:54] child never could even see it with her
[1:30:57] natural eyes but in her heart she
[1:31:01] knew God had answered the prophecies the
[1:31:06] life had come to pass in a tiny little
[1:31:11] vessel what about our vessels we sang
[1:31:13] that song last night and a lot of people
[1:31:15] thought I I wrote that song uh let your
[1:31:18] word be born in in in my heart because I
[1:31:22] used to always you know sing it in
[1:31:24] services
[1:31:26] and but here so here she gets to see
[1:31:29] this
[1:31:31] vessel and she gets to see and to
[1:31:34] understand even she can't see it with
[1:31:36] her eyes but she perceives it with her
[1:31:39] heart this is the Salvation of Our
[1:31:42] Lord
[1:31:44] this is the life of the
[1:31:47] prophecy now being manifested for my
[1:31:51] Redemption
[1:31:54] wow greatest sign never
[1:31:58] seen and so we think about it and then
[1:32:00] when Jesus as he grows and he's growing
[1:32:04] into those prophecies that were said
[1:32:07] about him wonderful counselor Mighty God
[1:32:10] Everlasting father and there's countless
[1:32:13] prophecies concerning what the life of
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ would be with his
[1:32:19] stripes we were healed
[1:32:22] he hasn't met that one yet but he
[1:32:26] will and and so he's gone through life
[1:32:29] and he's you know testifying and he's
[1:32:31] fulfilling these other scriptures and
[1:32:33] other his life becomes a fulfillment of
[1:32:37] scripture that they can look at but
[1:32:40] they're not they can't really see
[1:32:42] it and so they're asking they they're
[1:32:45] Lord we we we know nobody can do these
[1:32:48] things that you're doing except they be
[1:32:50] sent from God and Nicodemus when he came
[1:32:53] to him he said Master nobody can do this
[1:32:57] stuff unless they're sent from God and
[1:33:01] and Jesus said you must be born
[1:33:05] again can't even see it unless you're
[1:33:07] born
[1:33:08] again and so these other scribes and
[1:33:11] Pharisees they're they're going you know
[1:33:13] this wow this sure looks a lot like we
[1:33:16] think the Messiah should be but
[1:33:20] wow
[1:33:22] where's the where's the red carpet
[1:33:24] where's all the trumpets where's the uh
[1:33:27] the troops the the Lord of hosts if you
[1:33:29] ever you're reading in the Bible
[1:33:30] sometimes and I'll just drop this in
[1:33:33] because it becomes important in certain
[1:33:36] places sometimes it'll say the Lord
[1:33:39] sometimes it'll say the Lord of hosts
[1:33:42] sometimes it'll say the Lord thy God and
[1:33:44] each one of those has a
[1:33:46] specific life behind it the Lord of
[1:33:49] hosts is god with his
[1:33:55] armies because he is the Lord over the
[1:33:58] host of heaven and it's God with his
[1:34:00] armies and so they're looking at these
[1:34:02] things and they're looking at these
[1:34:04] scriptures because they knew this this
[1:34:05] was things out of Hebrew out of the the
[1:34:07] Torah
[1:34:09] and they're looking at Jesus and going
[1:34:12] wow he doesn't even have a house to live
[1:34:17] in a and he just didn't fit the picture
[1:34:21] they they couldn't see and so they're
[1:34:23] asking him Lord show us a sign where's
[1:34:26] the pillar of fire where's the the cloud
[1:34:29] by day the different things that God had
[1:34:32] talked about them you know through that
[1:34:34] Ministry of Moses and through the
[1:34:36] prophets and all those things and
[1:34:38] they're saying Lord just give us a sign
[1:34:40] we'll we we'll catch
[1:34:41] it but he said a wicked and adulterous
[1:34:45] generation looks for a
[1:34:48] sign but he said the only sign you're
[1:34:50] going to get to see is this sign of the
[1:34:52] Prophet
[1:34:54] Jonas imagine what they're thought their
[1:34:56] heads are thinking about that the sign
[1:34:59] of the Prophet
[1:35:01] Jonas what are they must have walked
[1:35:04] away scratching their heads and a little
[1:35:06] bit confused about things and he just
[1:35:10] called us a wicked and a
[1:35:12] generous you know a wicked generation
[1:35:16] because all we want to see is a
[1:35:20] sign and so so when we think about this
[1:35:24] greatest
[1:35:25] sign that was never seen and they maybe
[1:35:27] they even went back and you know pulled
[1:35:30] it out and they're reading about Jonas
[1:35:31] they're reading about it and they don't
[1:35:34] understand the life that's in the
[1:35:41] vessel that's being poured
[1:35:44] out there is a life in the vessel that's
[1:35:49] being poured out to them because this is
[1:35:51] the manifestation
[1:35:55] of what the word said about their
[1:35:58] Messiah so let's look at
[1:36:03] Jonah and there's parts of it that are
[1:36:06] again easily seen that oh this is Christ
[1:36:08] he was in the whale belly three days and
[1:36:11] stuff and Jesus even told us that's what
[1:36:14] I'm going to
[1:36:15] be and so but let's go back to where it
[1:36:18] all starts and that's Jonah the first
[1:36:20] chapter first verse and
[1:36:24] watch how God brings the life of Jonah
[1:36:29] to
[1:36:32] pass now the word of the Lord came unto
[1:36:35] Jonah the son of amiah saying arise go
[1:36:39] to Nineveh that great City and cry
[1:36:41] against it for their wickedness is come
[1:36:44] up before me but Jonah rose up to flee
[1:36:47] unto tares from the presence of the Lord
[1:36:50] and he went down to J and found a ship
[1:36:52] going to tares and he paid the fair
[1:36:54] thereof and went down to it to go with
[1:36:56] them unto tares from the presence of the
[1:37:01] Lord we're familiar with
[1:37:04] this I think you know all the from
[1:37:07] Little Sunday school kids on up they can
[1:37:10] tell you about this part and most people
[1:37:12] look at Jonah
[1:37:13] as well that rebellious little twit or
[1:37:17] whatever word you use it's like what God
[1:37:21] comes to
[1:37:23] Jonah go down to
[1:37:26] Nineveh no man I'm not going forget it
[1:37:30] it's not my deal that's a bunch of
[1:37:32] Gentiles and what people don't realize
[1:37:35] is where God ninev was the
[1:37:39] capital of the entire Gentile kingdoms
[1:37:42] of all the kingdoms of the Gentiles at
[1:37:45] that time and he's telling this Jewish
[1:37:48] Prophet because it says there in verse 9
[1:37:51] when they asked him what are you doing
[1:37:53] he said oh I'm a
[1:37:54] Hebrew which actually has a meaning of I
[1:37:57] am from Beyond or one from
[1:38:00] Beyond so here is Jonah this Hebrew
[1:38:05] prophet and and he's I'm not going down
[1:38:08] there I don't even know their language
[1:38:10] man why why would I want to go there and
[1:38:13] so it looks like he's in full Rebellion
[1:38:17] when he does this and he goes down to
[1:38:19] tarses because he does not want to go to
[1:38:23] Nineveh
[1:38:24] and but
[1:38:26] where does it
[1:38:29] start well the word of the
[1:38:32] Lord the word of the Lord comes to
[1:38:38] Jonah and behind the word is a
[1:38:45] life there's water in here that carries
[1:38:49] life and behind the word there is life
[1:38:53] in every word that somehow points us to
[1:38:58] Jesus Christ and so the word of the Lord
[1:39:01] comes to Jonah and there is a life
[1:39:03] behind that word and that life that
[1:39:07] comes to Jonah what's the first thing it
[1:39:11] says
[1:39:13] arise and go to
[1:39:15] Nineveh well Joseph I mean Jonah he gets
[1:39:19] off probably off his bed or wherever he
[1:39:21] was sitting or stand and stands up and
[1:39:24] goes I'm not going forget it no not my
[1:39:29] deal go find a different
[1:39:32] Prophet but the word was
[1:39:36] arise Jonah goes his way
[1:39:40] and he takes this boat to tarses and
[1:39:43] when he's kind of caught in his
[1:39:46] problem and
[1:39:49] uh they asked ask him you know what's
[1:39:51] your occupation where do you come from
[1:39:54] what's your country what people are thou
[1:39:56] you know they had they were full of
[1:39:58] questions cuz they're in
[1:40:00] trouble they're getting bounced around
[1:40:03] and it looks not too good for anybody
[1:40:06] and when they get in trouble they go to
[1:40:08] the Hebrew the one from Beyond and they
[1:40:11] say to him you know uh who are you and
[1:40:14] he said I'm a Hebrew and I fear the lord
[1:40:16] god of Heaven which hath made the Sea
[1:40:19] and the dry land he
[1:40:22] knows God made this and if God made this
[1:40:26] God is probably behind the reason it's
[1:40:29] being
[1:40:30] troubled and so he said I I'm I'm you
[1:40:33] know I believe in
[1:40:35] Jehovah and when he says this it says
[1:40:37] they are exceedingly afraid it's like oh
[1:40:43] man this is not good we've got God's
[1:40:47] prophet and he's going to the wrong
[1:40:49] place and we're the ones taking him this
[1:40:51] is not good and so they asked he why
[1:40:55] hast thou done this for the men knew
[1:40:57] that he fled from the presence of the
[1:40:59] Lord because he had told
[1:41:00] them and they said unto him what shall
[1:41:03] we do with thee that the sea may be calm
[1:41:06] to us for the sea rod and was temptu and
[1:41:08] he said unto them take me and cast me up
[1:41:12] or take me up cast me forth into the sea
[1:41:15] so shall the sea be calm for you for I
[1:41:18] know that for my sake this Tempest is is
[1:41:21] upon you they didn't want to kill him
[1:41:25] he's a prophet and they have recognized
[1:41:29] him as a prophet because they were
[1:41:30] afraid it's like oh Lord what are we
[1:41:33] going to
[1:41:34] do and and so they don't want to kill
[1:41:37] him and it says nevertheless they rode
[1:41:39] hard to bring him to the
[1:41:40] land but they couldn't do it for the sea
[1:41:44] was rot and temptu against him and they
[1:41:47] Cried unto the Lord we beseech thee let
[1:41:49] us not perish for this man's life lay
[1:41:52] not Upon Us innocent blood for thou oh
[1:41:55] Lord Hast done as it pleased thee and
[1:41:57] they took Jonah up cast him forth into
[1:42:00] the sea and the Sea ceased it's raging
[1:42:04] and his testimony the men feared the
[1:42:07] Lord exceedingly and offered sacrifice
[1:42:10] unto the Lord and made vows his running
[1:42:14] from
[1:42:15] God converts these guys on the
[1:42:18] boat because now they're
[1:42:21] sacrifices it's like oh don't let his
[1:42:24] blood be on us and it says the Lord
[1:42:27] prepared a great fish to swallow up
[1:42:29] Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the
[1:42:30] fish three days and three nights we
[1:42:33] understand that
[1:42:36] testimony but when it says cast him
[1:42:39] forth into the sea and I I couldn't find
[1:42:41] the notes where I had written down these
[1:42:44] uh some of these definitions but one of
[1:42:48] the if I remember correctly one of the
[1:42:51] where it says they cast him into the sea
[1:42:54] it
[1:42:54] also carries the
[1:42:57] meaning of like a basin filled with
[1:42:59] liquid because that's essentially what a
[1:43:02] sea is It's a Great Basin of land that
[1:43:05] holds the water within
[1:43:08] it so now the word of the Lord has come
[1:43:11] to Jonah and the command was to arise
[1:43:16] Jonah said I'm not going and now here
[1:43:19] these things have befallen them but they
[1:43:22] do as the prophet told them to do cast
[1:43:25] me into the sea so they cast him into
[1:43:29] the
[1:43:31] Basin into this liquid
[1:43:35] filled
[1:43:37] Basin greatest sign never
[1:43:41] seen and it's a part of Jonah that has
[1:43:45] become an amazing part to me let's look
[1:43:48] at uh Exodus the 12th
[1:43:53] chapter we will find
[1:43:57] what were when Jesus said the only sign
[1:44:00] you're going to see is the sign of the
[1:44:03] prophet Jonah
[1:44:06] well there's more than just Jonah being
[1:44:09] in the whale's belly for three nights
[1:44:13] because he's cast into the Basin he's
[1:44:15] cast into the sea and in
[1:44:19] Exodus that 12th
[1:44:22] chapter watch what Jonah's life or the
[1:44:27] soul the expression of God the nature of
[1:44:32] God is behind even this little scripture
[1:44:35] on
[1:44:36] Jonah in the 12th chapter and about the
[1:44:39] 22nd verse I think it is
[1:44:44] uh yes and he's given him Moses here is
[1:44:48] giving them the Commandments for the the
[1:44:53] Passover
[1:44:55] Lamb and in the 21st verse Jonah or
[1:45:00] Moses calls for the elect Elders of
[1:45:02] Israel and says unto them draw out and
[1:45:04] take you a lamb according to your
[1:45:06] families and kill the
[1:45:09] Passover and you shall take a bunch of
[1:45:11] hisp and dip it in the blood that is in
[1:45:13] the
[1:45:15] Basin that's where it's in the Basin
[1:45:18] it's in a captured
[1:45:21] something where they're going to capture
[1:45:23] the liquid that comes from this lamb and
[1:45:26] he said and take and dip it in the blood
[1:45:28] that is in the Basin so what's just
[1:45:31] happened as they kill this lamb this
[1:45:34] Passover Lamb this Ram that we know
[1:45:39] represents the Lamb of God they're going
[1:45:42] to capture the blood in a
[1:45:46] basin you're going to dip it in the
[1:45:48] blood that's in the basin and you're
[1:45:50] going to strike the lentil in the two
[1:45:52] side posts with the blood that's in the
[1:45:54] Basin and none of you shall go out at
[1:45:56] the door of the house until the
[1:45:59] morning so
[1:46:01] what's going on
[1:46:04] here and we could take this all the way
[1:46:07] back to Genesis if you want to because
[1:46:11] he's saying you're going to take this
[1:46:13] lamb to the
[1:46:15] door and you're going to slice the the
[1:46:18] throat on the lamb and you're going to
[1:46:20] to catch the blood in a
[1:46:23] basin and from this Basin you're going
[1:46:26] to go find some hsip which was as we
[1:46:29] heard in the message you know it's it's
[1:46:31] just a weed it grows everywhere in
[1:46:35] Israel and he said it represents just
[1:46:38] common everyday Faith like the faith
[1:46:40] that when you get ready to go out of
[1:46:41] here I hope you all have faith that when
[1:46:43] you turn that key your car is going to
[1:46:44] start it takes Faith to do that and
[1:46:48] that's the kind of faith that God God
[1:46:50] said that's how you apply the
[1:46:53] Blood Simple Faith you just believe it
[1:46:58] and so here they have the Basin and it's
[1:47:02] laying at the lentil or the opening
[1:47:05] place of the door who's the
[1:47:08] door Jesus
[1:47:10] Christ so here's the blood from the lamb
[1:47:15] at the lentil of the door and they're to
[1:47:17] take just common faith and and dip it in
[1:47:21] this Blood that's laying at the the the
[1:47:25] door at the threshold of the door and
[1:47:29] they take from the threshold of the door
[1:47:33] and they just splatter the blood on the
[1:47:36] and we know this all represents
[1:47:38] Christ and they splatter it on the side
[1:47:41] post of the door and they also were
[1:47:44] called to Splatter it on the top of the
[1:47:47] the lentil at the top of the door and we
[1:47:49] know that if they splatter it there it's
[1:47:51] going to drip and it's going to make a
[1:47:54] cross with the
[1:47:56] blood and so we see it's Jesus Christ
[1:48:00] and and here it's it's on the lentil but
[1:48:03] and if you get you know that you can go
[1:48:05] a whole another Direction with that and
[1:48:08] it's uh the strong and mighty one is the
[1:48:12] posts of the
[1:48:15] door Mel Michael the the Archangel the
[1:48:20] strong and mighty one as the post of the
[1:48:24] door and from the
[1:48:28] threshold to the side post to the lentil
[1:48:32] it's all by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:48:36] who was slain at the
[1:48:38] threshold you say slain at the
[1:48:44] threshold when Cain offered as it were
[1:48:48] the fruit you know it was an excellent
[1:48:51] sacrifice Bible said it was an excellent
[1:48:54] sacrifice but it said that Abel offered
[1:48:57] a more excellent
[1:49:01] sacrifice
[1:49:02] why if it was an excellent sacrifice why
[1:49:05] didn't God accept
[1:49:07] it and God even told Cain if you don't
[1:49:11] go back and
[1:49:13] repent then sin lith at the
[1:49:19] door
[1:49:21] at the door what happened Cain's
[1:49:25] sacrifice was the first
[1:49:28] fruits an excellent
[1:49:31] sacrifice but you can't have the first
[1:49:34] fruits of the Harvest until you've had
[1:49:37] the
[1:49:41] death Jesus could not become the first
[1:49:44] fruits of the
[1:49:45] Resurrection until he had been
[1:49:48] slain and Abel had that
[1:49:51] Revelation there has to be blood slain
[1:49:54] because my blood has been corrupted
[1:49:57] through the action of that
[1:49:59] serpent with his
[1:50:01] mother that's tough and you get right
[1:50:04] down to it that's pretty
[1:50:07] tough but Abel had the right Revelation
[1:50:10] Cain's Revelation it was an excellent
[1:50:12] sacrifice but it was out of order you
[1:50:15] cannot have the first fruits of the
[1:50:17] Resurrection until there's a death
[1:50:22] of the blood and that death came when
[1:50:25] God told him if you go back and repent
[1:50:28] you know it'll be well but if you don't
[1:50:30] then sin lieth at the
[1:50:32] door what is God talking about what's
[1:50:37] the nature of God behind what he said to
[1:50:42] Cain the Bible said that Jesus Christ
[1:50:45] became
[1:50:46] sin for you and
[1:50:49] I
[1:50:51] you understand and he said if you don't
[1:50:54] go back and repent sin lieth at the door
[1:50:58] and the lamb was slain at the door and
[1:51:02] the blood was taken from the
[1:51:05] Basin to give us
[1:51:08] that that sign of the cross if you would
[1:51:12] and the life that was in the
[1:51:15] lamb is expressed in the
[1:51:18] blood and we know the life that was in
[1:51:21] the blood of
[1:51:22] Christ is expressed
[1:51:25] unseen to you and
[1:51:28] I
[1:51:31] so
[1:51:33] wow and we see that so the blood was
[1:51:36] there it was caught in a basin and here
[1:51:40] Jonah is telling him cast me into the
[1:51:44] Basin because he has a life in him and
[1:51:47] that life is
[1:51:48] arise that was the word to Jonah arise
[1:51:54] Jonah and go to that crazy bunch of
[1:51:58] Gentiles can you imagine now just think
[1:52:01] about this these are Israelis they're I
[1:52:04] mean they're Jews they're
[1:52:06] Hebrews and Jesus is telling them the
[1:52:09] only sign you're going to get
[1:52:11] is a prophet going to the
[1:52:15] Gentiles that's what he's telling them
[1:52:18] because that's what Jonah was was all
[1:52:20] about arise Jonah and go to the
[1:52:24] Gentiles you
[1:52:26] understand can you understand why Israel
[1:52:29] might have been a little upset with this
[1:52:31] Prophet named Jesus what the only sign
[1:52:35] we're going to see is a prophet
[1:52:37] that gets spit out of the whale and goes
[1:52:40] to the
[1:52:42] Gentiles that's what he's telling
[1:52:45] them hey you bunch of Jews your sign is
[1:52:49] going to be a a prophet to the
[1:52:52] Gentiles where we at brother
[1:52:56] sister you see how it's not only all the
[1:52:59] way back in the garden now it's in the
[1:53:02] Deliverance in Exodus and now as it goes
[1:53:05] through history it comes again at the
[1:53:09] end time a prophet to the
[1:53:14] Gentiles what a God we serve what a life
[1:53:19] behind these words so he's told them
[1:53:21] cast me into the Basin and we know what
[1:53:23] happens and he sinks and God has a
[1:53:27] special fish it says in one place and in
[1:53:29] another place it calls it a whale and
[1:53:33] this fish takes up Jonah and it's pretty
[1:53:35] easy to follow the Life of Christ from
[1:53:38] that point
[1:53:40] on and
[1:53:43] how
[1:53:46] wow there's another place we'll mention
[1:53:48] the threshold
[1:53:51] just because it's another jump in
[1:53:54] history and that
[1:53:57] from from the blood in the Basin at the
[1:54:00] at the
[1:54:02] threshold that word begins to again move
[1:54:05] through history and you'll find
[1:54:07] different places I forgot what word it
[1:54:09] actually used now and I looked it up
[1:54:11] earlier today but it means to
[1:54:14] intertwine well immediately when you see
[1:54:18] that what do we think of of the crown of
[1:54:21] thorns because the life was intertwined
[1:54:25] and placed on the head of
[1:54:27] Christ and so we think of this word
[1:54:32] intertwining itself going through
[1:54:34] history and it comes to down to this
[1:54:36] Prophet now named
[1:54:38] Ezekiel and we can read it if you'd like
[1:54:40] it's the 47th chapter
[1:54:44] uh of
[1:54:47] Ezekiel yes I love the word I just I
[1:54:52] love the Lord
[1:54:54] Jesus and he said there in 47 verse one
[1:54:58] afterward he brought me again to the
[1:55:00] door of the house and behold the waters
[1:55:03] issued out from under the threshold of
[1:55:07] the house
[1:55:12] Eastward
[1:55:18] how
[1:55:20] Lord they might think I'm crazy but
[1:55:22] we're talking about the Seven
[1:55:25] Seals from the
[1:55:27] threshold of the door where the lamb was
[1:55:31] slain where the token was
[1:55:34] supplied the water begins to issue out
[1:55:38] from the
[1:55:42] threshold and it goes to the
[1:55:44] East and we think
[1:55:47] about remember the sign to them is the a
[1:55:50] prophet to the Gentiles and this Prophet
[1:55:53] comes to the Gentiles and he said now
[1:55:55] that's that's not brother Bill brand
[1:55:57] that's the angel of the Lord told you
[1:56:00] that that was God speaking to you and in
[1:56:03] one place I just listened to it the
[1:56:04] other I he said now this might offend
[1:56:06] you
[1:56:07] but I I'm the voice of God to you and
[1:56:11] and he said now I realize some were
[1:56:13] offended but then he says it again I
[1:56:16] when he speaks he said I'm the voice of
[1:56:18] God to you
[1:56:20] and he said that time I said it under
[1:56:22] inspiration in other words God told him
[1:56:25] to tell him that and we had a prophetic
[1:56:28] message going going going out to the
[1:56:31] Gentiles out to the Gentiles the blood
[1:56:34] being expressed the blood being ex
[1:56:35] stress the
[1:56:37] token over this message of the hour and
[1:56:40] it came to a certain place where he went
[1:56:42] as far
[1:56:45] west as he could possibly go into the
[1:56:48] Western Gentile
[1:56:50] World sunset
[1:56:53] Mountain and he tell and God tells him
[1:56:56] now go back to the
[1:56:58] east to open the Seven
[1:57:02] Seals go back to the East and from the
[1:57:07] threshold the water begins to flow to
[1:57:10] the
[1:57:12] East and he goes back to the East and he
[1:57:16] begins to preach the Seven Seals and now
[1:57:20] he says you have a new
[1:57:22] book
[1:57:24] what caused
[1:57:27] that what caused this water that we're
[1:57:32] partaking of and the life
[1:57:34] therein to be revealed to us
[1:57:38] tonight well as the word of the Lord
[1:57:40] came to the prophet said go
[1:57:42] back I have a job for you to do I have
[1:57:47] something that you ever think about how
[1:57:50] many times have we heard in the message
[1:57:54] when brother brandham he'll start into
[1:57:56] the prayer line and he'll tell
[1:57:59] people
[1:58:01] wow your sister so and so you're from
[1:58:04] such and such a place and uh you know
[1:58:08] this is your address and whatever it is
[1:58:11] and one place I remember he talked about
[1:58:13] he said if people stick around long
[1:58:16] enough or come he said some people can
[1:58:18] receive it in immediately this was
[1:58:20] Christ and they're healed and they walk
[1:58:21] off the platform but he said if they
[1:58:23] stick around long
[1:58:26] enough he said to where he would step
[1:58:30] into that again and he gave the example
[1:58:33] of a brother I can't remember what the
[1:58:35] brother's name was but he said it's like
[1:58:38] when he would step into that discernment
[1:58:41] he would look into that person's life
[1:58:44] from the past and then he would bring it
[1:58:47] up he said he would step out and that's
[1:58:49] that's why he would always ask him is
[1:58:51] that the truth why was that so important
[1:58:54] to him is that the truth well yeah it's
[1:58:57] the truth how could they deny it if they
[1:58:59] denied it they'd have died because it
[1:59:01] was the truth and then he would step
[1:59:03] back into the vision and he said and I
[1:59:05] see you I see you with this doctor you
[1:59:10] know on a certain certain day and he's
[1:59:12] told you this and if they could receive
[1:59:15] it there that's fine and praise the Lord
[1:59:18] but he said if I step back once more or
[1:59:21] step into it once more and I can look
[1:59:24] out into the
[1:59:27] future and see brother so and so holding
[1:59:30] a chain or bouncing a baby or a child on
[1:59:33] his knee he said then I can say thus
[1:59:36] sayeth the Lord you're healed because
[1:59:40] this was received by faith in what was
[1:59:43] said but that is God saying that's the
[1:59:47] destination of that that man and he
[1:59:50] would always you've heard I know you've
[1:59:52] heard these things and he said was well
[1:59:54] is that the truth is that why was that
[1:59:56] so important and why was it so important
[2:00:00] when it comes to the Seven
[2:00:03] Seals brother he said to
[2:00:07] preach
[2:00:09] because that Discerning
[2:00:13] gift it was so important to him that
[2:00:17] that never
[2:00:18] failed because when it came to the Seven
[2:00:21] Seals and by his own confession he said
[2:00:24] I went and I started looking up the
[2:00:25] stuff and he goes I was going to preach
[2:00:27] it a certain
[2:00:29] way he said but that angel of the Lord
[2:00:32] came down and said take a look at it
[2:00:35] this
[2:00:37] way now the angel the word of the Lord
[2:00:41] through an angel Messenger to an angel
[2:00:45] messenger is now speaking you need to
[2:00:48] look at this in a a Different
[2:00:51] Light brother sister he was Discerning
[2:00:55] the heart of God this
[2:00:58] time he wasn't Discerning somebody
[2:01:01] else's
[2:01:02] heart the angel said look at the
[2:01:05] word this
[2:01:07] way and he began to explain oh the first
[2:01:11] seal is
[2:01:13] this second seal is this and he comes
[2:01:16] back and said that's thus sayeth the
[2:01:18] Lord
[2:01:20] because now he knows that's a gift that
[2:01:24] never fails and God has allowed him to
[2:01:27] look into the heart of God and he comes
[2:01:32] back and said that's thus sayth the
[2:01:38] lord well praise the Lord I hope you
[2:01:41] still love me after tonight I guess it's
[2:01:43] not too late to change my tickets I
[2:01:45] don't know do you understand because
[2:01:49] it's the
[2:01:50] life behind the word coming forward from
[2:01:55] Ezekiel coming forward from the blood
[2:01:57] that was in the Basin coming forth from
[2:02:01] sin liath at the door Jesus Christ
[2:02:04] became sin for
[2:02:07] us and he paid that sacrifice because
[2:02:11] the sacrifice was the day ye eat thereof
[2:02:14] ye
[2:02:15] die and he partook of sin that we could
[2:02:19] be free from
[2:02:21] it absolutely free brother brandham gave
[2:02:26] another
[2:02:27] example about Sin he said if you took
[2:02:30] all your sin and you put it in an ey
[2:02:33] dropper and he said there's a big bucket
[2:02:36] of
[2:02:37] bleach I love this and he said you took
[2:02:41] all of your sin past present
[2:02:44] future which we could go a whole yeah
[2:02:49] past present future and you carry that
[2:02:51] every sin that you'll ever do in that
[2:02:54] little eye dropper and you drop it into
[2:02:56] that bucket of
[2:02:58] bleach he said that bucket of bleach
[2:03:01] breaks down the chemistry of that
[2:03:05] ink to where it's as though it never
[2:03:10] existed your sin in the blood of Jesus
[2:03:14] Christ never existed and the devil he
[2:03:18] comes along said I don't believe that
[2:03:19] stuff man I saw what you
[2:03:23] did but it's called the bleach
[2:03:27] blood of the forgetfulness or the it's
[2:03:32] blotted from the memory of God and but
[2:03:34] but he knows all things he knows what
[2:03:36] you did no God can't even remember
[2:03:40] something that never existed because
[2:03:43] he's the one that said I
[2:03:46] exist if you have cast your sins into
[2:03:50] the blood of Jesus Christ they never
[2:03:54] existed and not even God will remember
[2:03:56] them in his
[2:03:58] memory I hope this sets you free
[2:04:01] tonight to realize who you are and what
[2:04:05] hour we're living
[2:04:08] in and we know that from under that that
[2:04:11] uh altar there with Ezekiel and I like
[2:04:14] Ezekiel because he's called son of man
[2:04:17] several different places God says oh son
[2:04:19] of man calls calling Ezekiel son of man
[2:04:22] and how his life started with a vision
[2:04:25] and so that and when the waters flow out
[2:04:28] and he starts talking about it you know
[2:04:30] there's water that you can here's those
[2:04:32] levels
[2:04:33] again there's Waters that you can you
[2:04:36] know up to the ankles or you can weigh
[2:04:38] out a little deeper and they're up I
[2:04:40] guess it's the thighs I don't remember
[2:04:42] what uh you know and then it's the chest
[2:04:44] and finally he said there's Waters to
[2:04:46] swim in I hope we're swimming
[2:04:50] tonight because there's waters for
[2:04:53] everyone if thou wilst
[2:04:56] believe and so he that dis with that
[2:04:59] Discerning gift he discerns the heart of
[2:05:02] God and reveals to us the whole plan is
[2:05:08] salvation first seal second seal third
[2:05:11] seal fourth seal and then you know I I
[2:05:14] was CH we spoke about this at the house
[2:05:17] a brother challenged me one time time
[2:05:19] cuz he said well the seals can't be open
[2:05:20] because the tribulation not here and was
[2:05:24] it the fifth or sixth seal one of those
[2:05:26] was uh tribulation he said they can't be
[2:05:30] open and as
[2:05:32] the he had quotes
[2:05:35] and finally he read a certain quote out
[2:05:38] of the
[2:05:39] seals and uh I said Lord I'm just
[2:05:42] praying as they're cuz they're being
[2:05:44] very attack full a attack attack full
[2:05:47] they're attacking me and
[2:05:51] uh I just said Lord I don't know what to
[2:05:53] do I don't know what to say you promised
[2:05:55] that you'd give us to say and the Lord
[2:05:58] said tell him to read that quote
[2:06:00] again
[2:06:02] slowly so I just said brother will you
[2:06:05] read that once more just real slow and
[2:06:08] so he starts reading and it's about the
[2:06:11] Great Tribulation and such and right in
[2:06:13] the middle of it brother brandham said
[2:06:15] that's what's happening here tonight
[2:06:20] the
[2:06:22] life that's unraveling or going to
[2:06:25] unravel the G the Great Tribulation was
[2:06:29] released at that moment that he spoke
[2:06:32] that
[2:06:32] seal but just
[2:06:35] like the word that came
[2:06:38] to Mary took
[2:06:41] time to manifest that child so does the
[2:06:47] life behind the seal that we call the
[2:06:49] Great Tribulation takes time and what's
[2:06:53] happened in the last 60 years the whole
[2:06:56] world's falling apart friends they're
[2:06:58] over there blasting each other tonight
[2:07:00] tonight probably over there it's daytime
[2:07:03] blasting each other to
[2:07:05] bits preparing and we look at Canada we
[2:07:08] look at the United States and you look
[2:07:09] at all the things and and we talk about
[2:07:12] the the seven visions that were given to
[2:07:15] brother brandham in 1933 and you know
[2:07:18] know in in
[2:07:20] America we just had an election here 3
[2:07:23] years ago and and brother brandham said
[2:07:26] the Democrats would sell their
[2:07:29] souls for dirty voting
[2:07:32] machines and that there would be a woman
[2:07:34] in purple I I I could bring it up how
[2:07:38] there's actually a Russian brother put
[2:07:40] together a bunch of these quotes with
[2:07:43] pictures and the woman that became the
[2:07:46] vice president because brother bandam
[2:07:47] said she might be a president president
[2:07:48] might be vice president she'll be
[2:07:50] dressed in purple and when they went to
[2:07:52] be sworn in she was in a purple
[2:07:56] dress so if and I I don't I can't say
[2:07:59] that the fullness of The Sixth Seal has
[2:08:02] been
[2:08:03] fulfilled but if that was the start
[2:08:06] friends then there's only one Vision
[2:08:08] left that'll have to be fulfilled and
[2:08:10] that's the judgment on he said America
[2:08:13] he saw ashes and fire over the whole
[2:08:17] country I'm I'm talking about my own
[2:08:20] country and what brought the ashes and
[2:08:24] the
[2:08:26] fire in the days of Sodom you tell
[2:08:30] me you
[2:08:33] understand so what's going to bring the
[2:08:36] fire to fulfill the seventh
[2:08:39] seal or the seeven I'm sorry the seventh
[2:08:42] Vision we know you
[2:08:45] know and for the sake of this is is
[2:08:48] going public I won't say it but you know
[2:08:51] what I'm talking
[2:08:53] about they think the first six were a
[2:08:57] fluke I don't think so and neither was
[2:09:01] the
[2:09:03] seventh well better finish up with
[2:09:08] Jonah so let's go back to
[2:09:16] Jonah and in this particular case like I
[2:09:19] said it's pretty easy to see the life of
[2:09:22] Jesus
[2:09:23] Christ through this
[2:09:26] part he's been cast into the sea he's in
[2:09:29] the belly there it says three days three
[2:09:32] nights it says Jonah prayed unto the
[2:09:34] Lord out of the fish's belly and he said
[2:09:37] I cried by reason of my Affliction unto
[2:09:40] the Lord and he heard
[2:09:43] me out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[2:09:46] thou he heardest thou heard my
[2:09:50] voice how did he know God heard
[2:09:55] him how did he know he couldn't see it
[2:09:58] he's sitting in the dark I'm thinking he
[2:10:00] probably probably didn't smell real good
[2:10:02] in there you know all of his senses are
[2:10:05] telling me this is insane what am I
[2:10:07] doing in this fish's belly it's
[2:10:11] cold it stinks I can't see
[2:10:15] anything you know it's
[2:10:19] and yet he said I cried by reason of my
[2:10:22] Affliction and the Lord heard me he
[2:10:25] heard
[2:10:26] me out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[2:10:30] he heard my
[2:10:34] voice Jesus Christ the Bible says in
[2:10:38] Peter went to hell and preached to the
[2:10:42] souls in
[2:10:43] prison out of the belly of hell I cried
[2:10:47] and God God heard that
[2:10:52] voice we know Jesus Christ went to hell
[2:10:54] and preached to those souls in prison
[2:10:57] and God heard that voice when did he
[2:11:00] hear the voice Jesus had already
[2:11:03] prophesied to
[2:11:05] them that uh tear this Temple down in
[2:11:09] three days I'll raise it up that was the
[2:11:12] prophecy he concerned his own life with
[2:11:16] and laid that in the hands of God and he
[2:11:19] knew that God heard his voice so we see
[2:11:24] Jonah being an expression of the life or
[2:11:27] the soul of God and how that he
[2:11:30] continues there and he said he cast me
[2:11:32] into the deep into the midst of the Seas
[2:11:34] the floods compassed me about the
[2:11:36] Billows and thy waves passed over me uh
[2:11:40] and I am cast out of thy sight yet I
[2:11:43] will look again toward thy Holy Temple
[2:11:47] and in verse
[2:11:49] uh 7 jumping from 4 to 7 he says when my
[2:11:54] soul fainted within me I remembered the
[2:11:57] Lord and my prayer came in unto thee
[2:12:00] into thy Holy
[2:12:03] Temple and he but he continues there
[2:12:05] from five the waters compassed me about
[2:12:08] even to the so the depths closed about
[2:12:10] me round about the weeds were wrapped
[2:12:11] about my head I went down to the bottoms
[2:12:13] of the mountains the Earth with her bars
[2:12:15] was about me
[2:12:16] forever yet thou Hast brought up my life
[2:12:20] from
[2:12:22] corruption where do we find this word
[2:12:26] corruption here is Jonah a prophet well
[2:12:30] after the days of David and yet it was
[2:12:33] David in the
[2:12:35] Psalms that said thou wi not leave his
[2:12:38] soul in Hell nor suffer his holy one to
[2:12:42] see
[2:12:44] corruption and here is Jonah using the
[2:12:48] very prayer that David had spoken in the
[2:12:53] Psalms concerning and we know it was the
[2:12:56] life or the soul or the nature of God in
[2:12:59] David we covered that last night and he
[2:13:02] from the soul or the nature of God David
[2:13:05] said you'll not leave his soul in
[2:13:08] Hell nor suffer the Holy One to see
[2:13:11] corruption and here is Jonah and he's
[2:13:14] crying out to God I know he heard my
[2:13:16] prayer
[2:13:18] I know that he heard me he has a job to
[2:13:23] do a Jew a prophet has to go to these
[2:13:29] Gentiles
[2:13:31] wow he said you brought up my life from
[2:13:35] corruption the life of God that was sent
[2:13:39] into hell is now being brought
[2:13:43] forth out of
[2:13:46] corruption why wow and my soul fainted
[2:13:51] within me when I remembered the
[2:13:53] Lord his very Soul fainted within him as
[2:13:59] he thought about the Lord and there's
[2:14:01] that time frame those two little dots
[2:14:02] again and he says my prayer came
[2:14:06] up unto thee into thy Holy Temple and we
[2:14:09] know
[2:14:11] that he's in reference there to
[2:14:15] Solomon where the pillar of fire came
[2:14:17] came down in the temple and Solomon
[2:14:21] pronounced the blessing that if any man
[2:14:24] look towards this
[2:14:27] Temple but the temple he's really
[2:14:29] talking about is the temple of God not
[2:14:33] just necessarily the physic there's a
[2:14:36] physical aspect and maybe somehow he
[2:14:38] wiggled around in the whal and thought H
[2:14:40] my little Compass tells me that's where
[2:14:43] the the temple is but he said when I
[2:14:46] looked toward thy Holy
[2:14:50] Temple by prayer came in unto
[2:14:54] thee wow there's significance to that
[2:14:58] little word in also but
[2:15:00] we another day another time and then he
[2:15:05] calls in verse 8 they that observe lying
[2:15:09] vanities forsake their own
[2:15:15] Mercy this to me is a is a a maybe the
[2:15:22] highlight of the scripture concerning
[2:15:25] the sign that it's never seen because
[2:15:28] Jonah is still in the W's belly probably
[2:15:31] not having the best time of his
[2:15:33] life but he realizes that all of this
[2:15:36] around
[2:15:37] him is a lying
[2:15:41] vanity we talk about
[2:15:45] Rapture and if Jonah is a sign of the
[2:15:50] Resurrection they that observe lying
[2:15:52] vanities forsake their own
[2:15:57] Mercy what's he telling us the nature of
[2:16:01] God is telling telling me us to look to
[2:16:06] what the word of God says and not look
[2:16:09] towards your
[2:16:11] circumstances don't observe all these
[2:16:14] lying
[2:16:16] vanities don't get Carri it away with
[2:16:18] wow this world that could blow itself
[2:16:20] all apart by tomorrow morning praise the
[2:16:22] Lord Brother bradam said we'll be taken
[2:16:24] into the presence of God I hope we're
[2:16:27] there
[2:16:28] tonight because it'll be an easy
[2:16:32] transition to those who recognize the
[2:16:35] presence they that observe lying
[2:16:36] vanities forsake their own Mercy maybe
[2:16:39] the Lord will take us I I'm not telling
[2:16:41] you what he's going to take you to
[2:16:42] tomorrow cuz I don't have a clue
[2:16:45] but and they that observe vanities
[2:16:48] forsake their own Mercy but I will
[2:16:50] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[2:16:54] Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have
[2:16:57] vowed salvation is of the
[2:17:01] Lord so he refuses to recognize the
[2:17:06] condition that he's
[2:17:08] in and he's already stated that he
[2:17:10] believes that God heard his
[2:17:13] prayer even when he was in the
[2:17:15] Affliction and as he he uh and now he
[2:17:19] begins to
[2:17:21] sacrifice with
[2:17:23] Thanksgiving even in that
[2:17:26] condition he's still there he's still in
[2:17:28] the whale's belly and still stinks still
[2:17:32] wet cold all those things but he starts
[2:17:35] to thank the Lord what's he thanking the
[2:17:39] lord
[2:17:40] for I will sacrifice unto thee with a
[2:17:43] voice of
[2:17:44] Thanksgiving you want to sacrifice to
[2:17:46] the Lord just tell him thank you it's a
[2:17:50] sacrifice because of the conditions we
[2:17:53] live in but he's saying Thank You
[2:17:57] Lord thank you Lord I'm I I'll go now
[2:18:02] I'm gonna pay my vow well I'm I'm going
[2:18:04] to go but Salvation is of the Lord and
[2:18:08] so we see the next thing and God was
[2:18:11] pleased with that and the Lord spake
[2:18:14] unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah
[2:18:16] upon dry ground
[2:18:18] but now
[2:18:20] watch the start of what we call the
[2:18:23] third chapter and the word of the Lord
[2:18:25] came unto Jonah a second time saying
[2:18:29] what's the first word
[2:18:32] arise and go to
[2:18:36] Nineveh you see when God said arise
[2:18:41] clear back at the
[2:18:43] first that power behind that word was
[2:18:48] going to bring Jonah out of the fish
[2:18:51] that he didn't even know he was going to
[2:18:52] go
[2:18:53] into the power was in arise and this
[2:18:58] time when it comes it says arise and go
[2:19:01] to Nineveh and preach unto it the
[2:19:04] preaching that I bid thee and so he rose
[2:19:07] and
[2:19:09] went and we kind of know from there some
[2:19:12] of the things that happened with Nineveh
[2:19:14] they repented they say it's because that
[2:19:17] uh they worshiped the fish in Jonah or
[2:19:21] or in in that country and at that time
[2:19:24] period And when Jonah walked out of the
[2:19:26] fish they went his
[2:19:29] God is greater than our God which is the
[2:19:34] fish so when he walks out onto the shore
[2:19:37] and we don't know if he had time to put
[2:19:39] a nice suit on or not we don't really
[2:19:41] don't know I might have been kind of E
[2:19:43] look at that guy but whatever it was he
[2:19:47] arose and he came forth out of the fish
[2:19:51] according to the life behind the word
[2:19:54] that had spoken to him in the first
[2:19:57] place was arise and go to
[2:20:01] Nineveh go to the Gentiles but he could
[2:20:04] not go to the Gentiles until he had
[2:20:08] experienced death burial and
[2:20:13] Resurrection so we see it's all Jesus
[2:20:17] Christ Christ and after that this
[2:20:21] Prophet goes to the Gentiles and brings
[2:20:27] repentance do you love him he's he's all
[2:20:31] of it you know if I got you know
[2:20:34] something mixed up that's he pray for me
[2:20:39] but that's how I see it it's all Jesus
[2:20:42] Christ and it's all in perfect order
[2:20:48] according to God's
[2:20:51] word and we wonder when we talk about
[2:20:53] well close Lord willing with
[2:20:56] this because he spoke as it
[2:20:59] were you know in a way his own
[2:21:02] Resurrection when he said they that
[2:21:04] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[2:21:06] Mercy he's telling us that I'm not going
[2:21:08] to believe in my
[2:21:11] surroundings I'm not going to believe in
[2:21:13] the condition that I'm in I'm not going
[2:21:15] to believe in any of that
[2:21:17] but I'm going to praise the Lord oh
[2:21:20] thank you
[2:21:22] Jesus and Jesus spit him out where he
[2:21:25] was supposed to
[2:21:27] be and so it is with us regardless of
[2:21:30] what we see our Earthly conditions
[2:21:33] around us the Earthly condition of these
[2:21:36] frames that we live
[2:21:38] in it's all lying
[2:21:41] vanities and it becomes the life of God
[2:21:46] that's in that
[2:21:47] this water that we're drinking
[2:21:53] tonight will Deliver
[2:21:56] Us from this
[2:21:58] world and from these vanities in which
[2:22:01] we live and how
[2:22:04] that
[2:22:05] uh well let's read Luke the 12th
[2:22:10] chapter excuse
[2:22:12] me
[2:22:14] everybody's got stuff going on I guess
[2:22:17] yes Luke the 12th
[2:22:30] chapter thank you
[2:22:39] Lord and sometimes I deliberately
[2:22:42] deliberately don't Mark in my Bible
[2:22:44] where stuff is because I want you to be
[2:22:46] able to catch up so so you can read it
[2:22:48] and if I just flip to it people
[2:22:50] are so 12th chapter and the 32nd
[2:22:59] verse
[2:23:00] uh he says fear not little flock it is
[2:23:04] your father's good pleasure to give you
[2:23:08] the
[2:23:09] kingdom that's the word of the
[2:23:11] Lord he is desirous he's it's his
[2:23:15] pleasure to give give you the
[2:23:19] kingdom he wants you to have it and in
[2:23:24] the
[2:23:25] seventh chapter of Luke in the 21st
[2:23:31] verse he comes back and he says it like
[2:23:35] this
[2:23:37] uh well let's read from the 20th and
[2:23:40] when he was demanded of the Pharisees
[2:23:42] now they're getting pretty rough with
[2:23:43] him hey you think you're Messiah
[2:23:46] whatever you you they're demanding that
[2:23:48] he tell them when will the kingdom of
[2:23:51] God come because they're looking at him
[2:23:53] and this is nothing like what they're
[2:23:54] expecting they're expecting their
[2:23:56] Messiah to be totally different and so
[2:23:59] they're demanding from him but watch his
[2:24:04] answer the kingdom of God comes with not
[2:24:08] not with
[2:24:10] observation so we're entering the
[2:24:13] greatest
[2:24:15] sign the greatest
[2:24:19] gift the kingdom of God and you can't
[2:24:23] even see
[2:24:25] it no
[2:24:28] observation because the life
[2:24:31] moves when the water
[2:24:34] moves the kingdom of God comes without
[2:24:39] observation
[2:24:41] and neither shall they say low here or
[2:24:44] low there for Behold The King kingdom of
[2:24:47] God is within
[2:24:51] you I can't see it
[2:24:57] directly who
[2:24:59] can but I can see the evidence of it
[2:25:02] because you're here
[2:25:03] tonight hopefully you're not angry with
[2:25:06] me or upset at the word of God just
[2:25:10] doing my best to speak as he would have
[2:25:13] us to
[2:25:15] speak but you can't see it but it's
[2:25:19] there the kingdom of God is within us
[2:25:24] and as the last scripture back in
[2:25:26] Matthew the 12th
[2:25:29] chapter he gives us another clue to this
[2:25:32] greatest sign the greatest thing we
[2:25:35] could desire is to enter into the
[2:25:37] kingdom of God can't even see it but in
[2:25:40] Matthew the 12th chapter or the 17 12th
[2:25:43] chapter I'm sorry got my
[2:25:48] and in vers 34 and through
[2:25:53] 37 he says a good man out of The
[2:25:55] Treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[2:25:58] good things and an evil man out of the
[2:25:59] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[2:26:03] but I say unto you that Every Idle word
[2:26:05] that men shall speak they shall give
[2:26:07] account thereof in the day of
[2:26:08] judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be
[2:26:13] justified and by thy words Thou shalt be
[2:26:19] condemned does that make us think about
[2:26:24] what the third pull really
[2:26:27] is he said by your
[2:26:30] words by my
[2:26:32] words we shall be justified and if we
[2:26:35] were to go to the Book of Romans he that
[2:26:38] is Justified is Sanctified and he that
[2:26:41] is Sanctified
[2:26:44] is glorified or placed into the kingdom
[2:26:50] of God that we yet cannot
[2:26:57] see I'm just telling you what the
[2:26:59] scripture says it's the greatest sign
[2:27:02] and it lives in you it lives in me and
[2:27:06] yet they cannot see
[2:27:08] it and you know if you want to go to the
[2:27:10] types and shadows there's an Enoch a guy
[2:27:13] named
[2:27:14] Enoch wow
[2:27:18] just said they looked for him and they
[2:27:19] couldn't find
[2:27:21] him where did Enoch go where did Elijah
[2:27:25] go that's another
[2:27:27] type I think the Lord just picked him up
[2:27:30] and spit him down over on those rocks
[2:27:32] and Elisha says dude you guys
[2:27:34] are you know in the Spanish mu loo you
[2:27:37] guys are crazy don't go they said well
[2:27:40] but we want to okay go ahead and
[2:27:43] go you understand it's a l life and it's
[2:27:47] a a kingdom that comes by our words that
[2:27:52] justify by our confession by our voice
[2:27:55] of Praise by our voice of
[2:27:59] Thanksgiving that helped take
[2:28:01] us into his word into his life that we
[2:28:06] can enter an unseen
[2:28:11] Kingdom as Sons and Daughters of God do
[2:28:16] you love him
[2:28:17] I love
[2:28:19] him Lord Jesus we have spoken tonight
[2:28:23] from your
[2:28:24] word I had no clue father when we
[2:28:27] started this service what way you
[2:28:29] desired to go and the things that you
[2:28:31] wanted said to this people they are a
[2:28:33] mature audience or they would not have
[2:28:37] sat through this and for that I'm
[2:28:40] grateful it's not often that we get to
[2:28:43] preach into some of these things that
[2:28:45] we've channeled into this
[2:28:47] evening God lead us into this unseen
[2:28:52] Kingdom lead us by an unseen sign by a
[2:28:57] new birth where in your life is
[2:29:00] expressed in Us in such a way that
[2:29:04] people can see the results of it but the
[2:29:07] life itself can only be seen by you
[2:29:10] because it's your life in
[2:29:14] us I thank you Lord I praise you for
[2:29:17] this audience I thank you Lord Jesus
[2:29:20] that our brother Jonathan would have us
[2:29:22] come and I trust that above in all
[2:29:25] things and all things we said or did you
[2:29:27] would receive honor
[2:29:31] glory and may our love go out to you as
[2:29:36] your love has been expressed to us
[2:29:38] through Jesus Christ and through your
[2:29:42] words whose name we ask it in Jesus name
[2:29:46] amen
[2:29:47] praise the
[2:29:49] lord
[2:29:51] well as they say sometimes it's it's
[2:29:55] another one that are it's in the books

[2:30:20] the Flesh and we see the problems and
[2:30:23] the struggles that we have in this flesh
[2:30:26] but we know this he overcame the
[2:30:29] world if you'd like I could do one other
[2:30:33] song Or Another Song simply because the

[2:39:14] nanded and

[2:39:23] prayerfully and uh I was actually happy
[2:39:27] when my daughter who had waited and
[2:39:30] prayed and prayed you sisters don't
[2:39:32] think just because you didn't get
[2:39:33] married at 16 or 17 you're not

[2:43:03] he
[2:43:05] beautiful in his
[2:43:11] time Lord please show me
[2:43:16] every
[2:43:18] day as you're
[2:43:21] teaching me your
[2:43:24] way that you'll do just what you
[2:43:30] say in your
[2:43:33] [Music]
[2:43:35] time you know he started with the angel
[2:43:39] that came to
[2:43:41] Mary and a messenger came to her and he
[2:43:45] said the power of the
[2:43:48] highest shall overshadow thee not a
[2:43:53] power not some power not a great power
[2:43:58] he said
[2:44:00] the that is the only power the power of
[2:44:05] the highest shall overshadow thee
[2:44:08] brother BR remember he said this age is
[2:44:10] the first age he says where the mystery
[2:44:13] is revealed that you can receive the
[2:44:15] Holy Ghost without sensation because
[2:44:18] that is exactly what happened when the
[2:44:20] first the the the the the second Adam
[2:44:24] the the the first fruit of us came was
[2:44:27] he came without
[2:44:29] sensation there was nothing natural it
[2:44:31] was completely Supernatural what
[2:44:34] happened and when you're born of Christ
[2:44:36] when you're born of the word it is
[2:44:38] completely
[2:44:40] Supernatural we're not saying you can't
[2:44:42] feel something we're saying that what he
[2:44:44] does is of of him and it is not of man
[2:44:47] it is not of you it is not your emotion
[2:44:49] that brings you into a birth it is not a
[2:44:51] sensation that brings you into birth but
[2:44:52] it is the almighty power of the highest
[2:44:56] that brings us into life in this age
[2:44:59] amen and I it just struck me as he was
[2:45:01] talking about that how that job went to
[2:45:04] the ash heap of his sacrifice and said I
[2:45:08] did my part I did what you told me to do
[2:45:11] brother brandham says when you've done
[2:45:13] all that he requires of you you stand
[2:45:16] there in faith and impatient expectation
[2:45:19] that he'll do what he
[2:45:22] said having done all to stand stand you
[2:45:26] do your part and the word has been
[2:45:29] released then there's no barriers
[2:45:31] there's nothing holding it back that'll
[2:45:33] keep God from fulfilling what he said
[2:45:36] Allah said you can't have the first
[2:45:37] fruits of the Harvest unless there's
[2:45:39] been a death first you can't get the
[2:45:41] true blessings of God unless there's
[2:45:43] been a death first you accept his death
[2:45:45] and burial and resurrection and the and
[2:45:47] the blood of Calvary and these things
[2:45:49] but you've got to die to yourself before
[2:45:51] you can ever get the first fruits of
[2:45:53] this amen I loved how he talked about
[2:45:55] the opening of the seals allowed the
[2:45:57] word to move forward the word is moving
[2:46:01] the word is always moving but we have a
[2:46:03] messenger that came and took the the top
[2:46:05] off the bottle of that word and he said
[2:46:08] now is the time now is the season we're
[2:46:09] in the Rapture season and that word went
[2:46:12] out and it came to a bride and it's
[2:46:14] Chang ing her and it's washing her by
[2:46:16] the water of the word and there's a life
[2:46:18] in it now there's a life in it and
[2:46:21] there's a people there's a woman to
[2:46:23] receive the life and now it's producing
[2:46:25] something and it's the very thing it's
[2:46:27] the very Christ that went down in the
[2:46:29] first place but what I love so much
[2:46:31] about this was when he read that verse
[2:46:33] eight of Job chapter 2 or Jonah chapter
[2:46:36] 2 and he says they that observe lying
[2:46:39] vanities forsake their own Mercy you
[2:46:41] know what a lying vanity is anything
[2:46:44] that is contrary to the word of God
[2:46:47] remember Abraham called those things
[2:46:48] that were not as though they were to do
[2:46:50] that you have to call those things that
[2:46:52] are as though they are not that's right
[2:46:55] you have to be able to deny what your
[2:46:56] eyes see what your your mind thinks what
[2:46:59] you smell what you feel what you hear
[2:47:01] and say thus sayeth the Lord is what I'm
[2:47:03] going to focus on Amen If You observe
[2:47:06] the line vanities if you go by what your
[2:47:08] five senses say you'll forsake your own
[2:47:10] Mercy because there's nothing there
[2:47:12] that's going to save you but if you can
[2:47:13] go to the word and you can believe the
[2:47:15] word and you can confess the word then
[2:47:17] now you've got something that'll take
[2:47:18] you out of your situation Jonah was in a
[2:47:20] bad
[2:47:21] situation but he get he confessed and he
[2:47:24] testified and he praised God and God
[2:47:26] took him out of that situation and then
[2:47:28] what happened is the word had never died
[2:47:31] the word had never stopped and it said
[2:47:32] arise
[2:47:34] again sometimes we arise and we
[2:47:37] fail but the word keeps saying
[2:47:41] arise what did it say in the scriptures
[2:47:44] arise
[2:47:45] Shine for thy
[2:47:48] light you've got a light you've got a
[2:47:51] word you've got a place you got a
[2:47:53] position I love that I wrote a I put a
[2:47:55] star in my notes next we glorified means
[2:47:57] to be placed into the body of Christ
[2:48:00] because if you're there you can never
[2:48:02] die you can never fail you can never
[2:48:05] fall and that's where this word takes
[2:48:07] you when you arise and you shine your
[2:48:09] light it's because you're being placed
[2:48:11] in the body of Christ and you are his
[2:48:13] word for this day
[2:48:15] for all men to see amen that was
[2:48:17] beautiful Brother David I appreciate
[2:48:19] that let let's testify against these
[2:48:22] line VES let's sing that song the
[2:48:26] Healer and we're not just talking about
[2:48:28] physical healing we're talking about
[2:48:30] life situations we're talking about
[2:48:32] family situations we're talking about
[2:48:34] finances we're talking about mind
[2:48:37] battles whatever it
[2:48:39] is you call it a ly vanity and you say
[2:48:42] Thy word is truth I'll take thus sayeth
[2:48:46] the Lord over whatever my senses are
[2:48:47] saying and I'll confess that and I'll
[2:48:50] testify of that until the day that I see
[2:48:54] it come to pass in my life because
[2:48:56] there's a life behind the word and if
[2:48:59] you'll only stay there it'll come the
[2:49:01] way he wants it to come in your life
[2:49:04] amen let's sing this song and we'll turn
[2:49:06] it over to brother Bob amen I don't like
[2:49:08] to preach afterwards but I love to speak
[2:49:11] of the inspiration I get you know
[2:49:12] there's something about listening to
[2:49:14] preachers makes you want to preach but I
[2:49:17] was telling the brothers the spirit of
[2:49:18] the Prophet is subject to the prophet so
[2:49:20] I won't preach amen but it was good and
