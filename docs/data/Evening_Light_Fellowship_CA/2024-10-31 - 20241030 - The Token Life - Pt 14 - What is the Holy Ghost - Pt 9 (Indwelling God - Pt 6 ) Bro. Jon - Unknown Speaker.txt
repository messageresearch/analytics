want to be that every day Lord God Heavenly Father Lord I pray that each morning when we wake up Lord till the moment that we lay our head down at night and go to sleep Lord that we would recognize the unveiling of God before us Heavenly Father Lord that we could surrender ourselves so completely to you Lord to be used of you Lord that you could do the same works that you could say the same words that you could have the same effect that you did when you walked the shores of galile Galilee 2,000 years ago Lord help us lord it's only through surrender lord it's only through surrender that this can happen but Lord we know you've given us Lord your spirit that we could surrender to it Lord that we could live your very with your very life inside of us Lord bless your people bless the word this evening Lord we pray Lord may it strengthen our faith Lord I ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you you can turn if you would to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 amen certainly appreciate brother Joe stepping into the into the pulpit here tonight to uh lead songs amen it's never easy to jump out of your usual role but uh amen certainly happy he did it anden a few updates we uh I spoke with brother Kingsley just before service he said there's no change with sister Melody so she's got contractions but nothing's really progressing so just remember her in prayer it's not certainly not uh unusual for a first pregnancy to go past the due date which was a couple days ago I believe 28th so just remember them in prayer it's uh it's always a little bit stressful that's probably putting it mildly amen I also spoke with sister Beverly about her grandson Noah the surgery the procedure went well uh he's still experiencing a fair bit of pain so they said there was a lot of Puss in there as I mentioned and so once that gets out then they're trusting that there'll be a uh a relieving of the pain and whatnot so keep praying for him and for them for the family each one amen and it's good to have brother Paul back with us as well God bless you good to see you again and then I have some some less fortunate news perhaps and brother Dale has notified me that he'll be leaving December 2nd moving back to Edmonton to his loving family so I I I expressed our thanks to him for all the time he spent with us and um certainly he's been a a a model of Christian virtue and character and strength amen and uh we're sad to see him go but um I I'll say myself I wasn't surprised he's a father and and and he has family and I just anticipated at some point he was going to go back but I didn't think it was quite this early brother Dale I thought I we get you for a little bit longer but I just want to say from the pulpit publicly God bless you we love you we appreciate you we're thankful for the fellowship the time the effort you've put in here and uh we were blessed to have you with us amen so uh when you go is if everything goes through and when you go certainly you go with our love and our blessing with you and trusting God will just just uh do even Greater Works in your life and in your family's life as you go back amen God bless you brother Dale amen turn if we would to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 Paul says here for the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead in other words if somebody had to die everybody had to be dead already we are dead in sins there was nobody excluded from that he had to die because we were dead in our sins there was no eternal life available to us he says and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again amen if you've received him and you've accepted the sacrifice of Calvary it ought to change your life he says wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing our series on the to Bren life on the Holy Ghost and we're going to take one more one more series on this on this subtitle of indwelling God and we've been speaking on this on the godhead really for the last uh four or five Services I guess and I want to kind of wrap that up in a neat picture tonight Lord willing so we can see where these Junctions and time are and how God has changed his form and how God has changed his form kind of at the very end of things and so we follow God kind of as he's gone through time and and we see him at the beginning he's Jehovah God he's he's L he's the self-existing one and this was in Genesis 1 this is John 1 in the beginning was the word it's just God by himself in spirit form and we couldn't really see him touch him hear him do any of these things amen necessarily but then we see in Genesis one that he created a body of light amen and that body was the pillar of fire and it was a body for himself to dwell in and so God himself came and he poured his Spirit into that body of light and that was the pillar of fire and it had no name given to it then but we know looking back that it had a name and it was Jesus Christ and we'll see that as we go through the scriptures amen it was God in a body of light a God in a body of fire and we call that Jesus Christ and today people so many are confused when we call Jesus Christ the Christ because they think of that as a description of a man but Christ means anointed one amen it's a body it's a dwelling place for God and that's the problem I think with Christianity Today is they put Jesus Christ as a man 2,000 years ago and they can't see Jesus Christ today and they can't see Jesus Christ before that but he's been there all along and really we'll see as we go through this and I've said it before and certainly we're we're students of the message we ought to know that Jesus Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's the name of God that's the revealing of God and it's been Christ all the way along from start to finish amen so Jesus Christ was in existence way before 2,000 years ago when he walked the shores of Galilee or when was born in a manger when he received when the Holy Ghost stepped into him at the River Jordan and Paul would say this in Ephesians he says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ so Paul says Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God it was not 2,000 years ago that was a different beginning of a creation it was God in flesh but yet he says God created all things by Jesus Christ we know that he stepped into a pillar of light a pillar of fire so that entire body with God in it was called Jesus Christ from the very beginning who created all things John 1:1 John 1 tells us that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in these things and it says all things were created by Him so the word it was Christ was in the existence uh at the very beginning but when that light was first made it was just a a thing the word was just a thing the word was in God's mind and God spoke it and it was still just an object but as soon as God stepped into it and he identified himself in that light in that Pillar of Fire then it went from becoming a what to becoming a who if I can put it that way it went from an object to becoming the person of God Amen because God was dwelling inside of it so now the word is becoming a person it's becoming a life it's becoming a reality so what was the name of that it was the name of that is Jesus Christ Paul tells us that the identification of God the name of God from start to finish has been Jesus Christ amen it wasn't revealed back then they didn't know him as Jesus Christ back in the Old Testament they didn't have a name of God as we've said before the the name of God was revealed in the sound of breathing in and breathing out he was the life he was the light of man but he had no name but Paul says God created all things through that body through Jesus Christ that was the revealing of God so if we see our entire Bible and we can read it we see that it's Christ from start to finish amen for the believer for for for the time bubble that we're in if we want to put it that way God has identified himself from start to finish through Jesus Christ he's changed his form many times he's changed his appearance he's changed the way he talks and all these different things but it's been Christ from start to finish it's not God the father and then God the son and then God the Holy Spirit three persons of a godhead but it's just God revealing himself time and time again in a different form and in a different way but if we look at our opening scripture here this evening Paul says wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now yet now henceforth know we him no more and the Amplified says so from now on WE regard no one from a human point of view according to worldly value standards and values that means that when you look at me you better not look at me the way that the world would I would be judged this evening based on the expense of my suit on whether I I have nice shoes whether I'm in a certain level of Fitness how I speak we would judge by that Paul says we can't judge anything by that now we don't go by appearance we've got all types and of people in this group and there's all kinds of people around this world that if you were to look at them you would be fooled by the outside Paul says we're not looking at the outside anymore and then he goes on he says though we have known Christ from a human point of view now we no long longer know him in this way he's saying Christ has changed the way that we know him has changed there's two elements to this thought at least as far as we'll go into this evening and one of them is that we no longer look at Christ as a man as perhaps people did while he was on the earth 2,000 years ago amen but the revelation of who Jesus Christ is has changed they knew him then as son of man they may have re they may have called him Son of God and they knew that deity walked in flesh amen and God was hiding himself in flesh so that Pillar of Fire what had happened is the pillar of fire had gone away and now God was hiding himself in flesh but the second element of that is that Christ is no longer identified in a single body as he was before cuz Paul now speaking after the resurrection after the Ascension of Christ after the Holy Ghost has come down on the day of Pentecost he says Christ is no longer the way that you experienced him because many of the people he's talking to had met Jesus Christ Jesus of nazare with the holy spirit inside of him God unveiled in flesh they had met him they had heard him preach they had maybe shook his hand maybe they had touched him maybe they had spent time with him whatever it might be they knew Jesus Christ as a man but Paul says he's changed now he's moved on from that amen so it's not just a single person or body but he's saying Christ has changed his form and we don't know him as a human the way that we used to before and so you can't go today and you can't say here is Jesus there is Jesus remember Jesus said when they say though Christ is here don't believe it or L he's in the secret Chambers or L he says you can't do that because he's not bound by a single body anymore there is no one man that identifies Christ anymore that way there is no longer a fullness of the godhead in a single body amen but God has changed his form in in who Jesus Christ is has changed from what he used to be to what he is today amen so we can see Christ talking about this while he was on Earth Earth and he was talking to his disciples and we see him even in prayer foreshadowing what's going to happen in the near future and if we look at John 16:12 it says I have yet this is Jesus speaking I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now he says but how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come remember what Jesus said I do nothing except the father shows me and it looks here like this is yes we know it's the outpouring of the Holy Spirit but it looks like there's a separation of people here it looks like there's a separation of Duties and he says whatever the Holy Spirit hears that's what he's going to give to you and he's going to talk about these things and he's going to show you things to come and then in verse 14 he says he shall glorify me he'll glorify Jesus Christ for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you so the holy spirit will take what is from Christ that is of Christ and he's going to reveal it to the Believers and that sounds like two people God bless you Sister Kimberly I didn't see you at the beginning there I think you were outside it's good to have you here as well it sounds like two people he said it almost sounds like a baton is going to be passed and Jesus is going to go up to heaven and he's going to go to the third person of the godhead and he's going to hand him the Baton and he's going to carry on the work that's what it sounds like amen but that's not the way it is we know this but let us go through the scripture and see it he says all all things that the father had are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you so everything that God has has been poured has been passed into the person of Christ and he says that's going to go into the Holy Spirit again it sounds like there's a passing of a bon but Jesus says these words a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because I go to the father and then he walks away he doesn't ever explain verse 16 he just said the facts and he left them hang there hanging there and he says in a while I'll be gone you won't see me like I am now but then you're going to see me again and then he says by the way I'm going back to the father and he has no explanation for how this is going to happen amen Jesus says I'm going back to the father I'm going back to what I was before I came here in other words I'm returning to what I was before so he says I'm coming back but don't look for me to come back the way that I left otherwise you'll miss my return you'll miss my revealing don't look for me in the same form that I left so Jesus has this question mark hanging here again I'm coming back but how am I going to come back but he says be ready for it but if we look back a few chapters earlier in John 14 we can develop the full picture and I love the Book of John John to me amazes me I mean he wrote the Book of Revelation as well but John has this insight into the way and and the revealing of God that nobody else had everyone else was TI back to the lineage of this and the lineage of that and one had Joseph's side and one had Mary's side but John takes us not back to Christ in a Manger but he takes us back to Christ the word before anything else ever was and that's because he's showing us the fullness of the revelation of God and I believe that's why he had to write the Book of Revelation was because God started with him in the when he wrote the Book of John as we would call it but God had to finish that revealing and so on the aisle of patmas he gives John that extra last bit and he shows him the full picture amen John had Insight that nobody else except Paul had nobody was close Peter didn't have a clue about it none of the other Apostles had it but John had it and we see that Paul would have it as well but Jesus is speaking here in John 14 and he's bringing Clarity to those that will listen rather than try and fit God in a box rather than fit him in their own theology I think that's the greatest struggle we face today and I I've shared with some of you some of the conversations I've had over the past 6 months or a year with different ones outside of this message outside of this church and the minute you say something that is outside of what they believe they tend to turn it off why because they're trying to fit God into their theology rather than trying to fit their theology into God Amen if we can run it through God rather than running God through us then we come outright I think a whole lot more than we wouldn't but you've got to listen to everything that he says and he says here I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter again it sounds like some some else Jesus was their comforter then he says another comforter is coming that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth Now John 16 which we just read talked about the same Spirit of Truth and again it sounds like it's somebody else whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him that's in the present that's in the present test Jesus says they can't receive him because they don't recognize who he is right now anden the Holy Spirit came down and dwelt in the body of Jesus of Nazareth that was the spirit of truth it's God himself he says they won't receive him because they don't see him now they don't recognize him here they're not going to recognize him in the next stage that's for sure he says because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him because he dwelleth with you present tense Spirit of Truth he says and shall be in you in the future tense so Jesus says the spirit of Truth the comforter one and the same person is coming and Jesus says you know this guy he's been with you all along he's with you right now and he's going to be coming in the future now he's with you but now soon in the future just a little while and he's not going to be just with you he's going to be in you there's going to be a difference happening in these amen because God he's saying God's been changing his form he went from God above now you see God with you but he's got to make a last transition and it's going to be God inside of you that's what he's trying to to warn them about you know it amazes me sometimes that that the phrases that the Christian World uses today and if they'd only listen to what they'd say theyd catch a revelation because what do they say when they ask somebody do they want to convert do they want to do they want to become a chrisan they say do you want Jesus to come into your heart well that's exactly what happens but then you ask them who comes in and they say well it's the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost it's the third person of the Trinity but you said Jesus would come into his heart or her heart that's who comes into their heart it's Christ but they think it's somebody else and their own words testify to the reality and the truth of it but they don't even listen to themselves amen Jesus said the spirit of Truth is going to dwell in you and he doesn't say it's somebody else who's doing this transition who's making this change the one that dwells with them is making a form change so that he can dwell in them because Christ the flesh cannot come and dwell in Jonathan klette there's already flesh there he's got to change his form and who is it it's the one that's with them is going to be the one that's in them it's Christ amen it's not Jesus of Nazareth it's Jesus Christ the anointed one and Jesus leaves no doubt about this he says I will not leave you comfortless he says I will come to you he's the comforter he's the spirit of Truth he says I'm the one that's with you now and I'm going to be the one that's with you even to the End of the Age I'm going to to be in you so when you ask Christ to come into your heart it's not just the holy spirit it's Christ in the person of the Holy Spirit coming into you it's God himself stepping in it's one and the same person just in a different form that's all it is that's happening amen God stepping out of that flesh into spirit and into a pillar of fire and then he's coming right back into you and he's dwelling in your soul he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me he doesn't say you will see me he says you see me that's a continuous thing that's going on for the believer is that they continue to see God no matter what is going on he says you see me one way but I'm not going to stop being seen as soon as I go up into the clouds because you're going to keep seeing me and it'll be a continuing revealing of myself in and through you amen it's not one and done he didn't leave and then we never get to see him but he says you will see me and he says because I live ye shall live also amen it's the indwelling Christ in us he says at that day what is it in a little while you shall know that I'm in my father and you're in me and I'm in you Jesus says you're going to understand how I can say that I and my father are one because you're going to recognize that Unity because I'm going to be in you the same way that he's inside of me it's the whole thing all again he says you won't see me like I am now but you'll see me nonetheless and you'll recognize what's going on so we're seeing this transition of the revealing of God and we had God above us in the Pillar of Fire and he was in a burning bush and he was a man called me MDC and in a pillar of cloud and all these things and then Jesus stepped or God stepped down into the body of Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus saying there's a transition coming now and I'm going back to what I was before and we see this in John again he says Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God so Jesus knows that that flesh body is going to be set aside pretty soon he's going to go through the pain and the shame and the suffering of crucifixion he's going to lay in the grave for a couple days and then what's going to happen is the spirit of God is going to take up that body and that body is going to be glorified his Celestial body his theophany is going to combine with that body and it would look just like Jesus did when he died at the end it had look like a 33 and A2 year old body in and of itself and it had a hole in its side and it had holes in the hands and holes in the feet but it was glorified amen it could go and appear anywhere it wanted it could go through walls it didn't have to go through doors it could eat food but it didn't need to have food it was a glorified body amen we look at the story of Copus and the other disciple walking to Emmas and they're talking about Jesus it says and it came to pass that when they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them watch it says but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him in other words Their Eyes Were supernaturally blinded to who he was because he was recognizable he was recognizable he looked as he did but their eyes were blinded and then he talks with them and it says and beginning of Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself says and they drew nigh unto the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to T with them and to came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight he looked just as he looked he acted as he acted and as soon as the scales were removed from their eyes they recognize him and then he vanishes he's in a glorified body he can come and go as we want as he wants we see it a little later in John says after 8 days again his disciples were within and Pro with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace unto you so Jesus just appears in the room the scripture is very clear he didn't walk through the door the door was shut they're in there waiting they're worrying they're wondering he could travel like a thought he could go wherever he wanted he could appear he could disappear he could hide eyes from seeing him he could let people see him he's in a glorified body amen he could decide all of these things amen and he said unto Thomas reach hither the thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing his body had been glorified that flesh had been put into the theophany had been combined with it so it had the appearance of Flesh it still had the nature of the appearance and the holes in these things but it obviously is not holding them back it's just the glorified body and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God church if you ever had a question about the deity of Jesus Christ look at that my Lord and my God and Jesus is with them now for 40 days after that sometimes he's with them sometimes he's not they're off walking they're all fishing they're doing this and that and we see him and he comes to the Sea of tiberias and Peter's out there and Peter says I go I'm going fishing and two guys say we're going with you and so they go out and they go fishing and they're fishing all night long and they've got nothing to show for it and meanwhile Jesus comes up on the shore and they look at him and they can't see who he is they can't recognize who he is but he's got a fire going and he's got fish and these different things and so Jesus says he says did you catch anything no we haven't caught anything he says cast your net on the other side of the boat but I want to stop here in this story because it's it's key to recognizing Christ as we move forward in this series to set a foundation here just a bit watch what happens when he says cast your net on the other side because it says he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fish and there were so many fish in there they couldn't pull their net up therefore the discip that disciple whom Jesus loved I always have a giggle with John he never identifies himself by name he says that disciple whom Jesus loved you know if I if I thought Cally I'd say he had a bit of a you know a thing I'm special that disciple whom Jesus loved he didn't love any of you like he loved me I laid on his chest none of you got to do that the disciple whom Jesus loved he no no no I just it's funny to me how he does it so John said unto Peter it is the Lord how does he recognize it is Jesus not by his appearance by his word and by the result of his word amen he said unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he GT his Fisher's coat unto him for was naked and did cast himself into the sea so what is it Jesus did the exact same thing he' done in Mark 1 when he first went to call them to himself and they were fishing he says just go on the other side they're like no no no that's not a good idea we've been doing it all night not going to make a difference he says just do it at Thy word Lord at Thy word Lord surrender amen and they put it over on the right side and the same thing happened they brought up all those fishes and they walked away from it to come and serve and walk with Christ amen but how are they recognizing Christ they're recognizing him by what he did before amen he's identified because he's doing he's saying the same thing he did before and he's doing the same thing he did before and it's producing the same thing that it did before that ought to be a revelation to us I believe it is I believe that's why we believe this message is because we've seen him say and do and produce the same things that he did before amen that's how we ought to recognize Jesus Christ today and I say that to those particularly that are listening to me by way of streaming this evening if you want to see Jesus Christ today look at what is said and what is done and what are the results because it's supposed to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever don't look at the rapper never look at the rapper look at what's coming out of it now I'm not saying don't look at the rapper ever if you got if somebody's literally a rapper if somebody's professing to be a Christian and they've got all the things of the world on them that can't be him you still have to have a Sanctified life you still have to be have a life that reflects the Holiness of of God and these different things but don't throw it away because it doesn't come in the package you anticipated CU it's never come the way the people wanted amen it's such a simple test church if you want to identify Christ find where the word is and where the word is that's where you'll find Christ because Christ is the word amen and the people today have built up a Jesus a Jesus Christ that's of their own making they built up a religious system a belief system and it always lacks the reality of the word of God brother Braham says they always put away the supernatural amen they have a Jesus that makes them feel good they have a Jesus that lets them live in a way that that works for them they have a Jesus that gives them religious satisfaction but what they don't have is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and to do that they have to take this Bible and I won't do it they have to rip Pages out of that book because it doesn't apply to them and they can't receive it and so they miss him because God never changes as the word he never changes the form changes the visible part changes but Christ the word never changes amen but Jesus told his disciples the change coming change change is coming you've got to be ready for it you've got to be ready for it and then we come to acts one where Paul writes about what's happening at the very end of Jesus Earthly Ministry and in Acts 1 and one it says this former treaties have I made o theophus of all that Jesus began all that Jesus began wow I thought we were going then all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen so notice now Jesus in literal body form taught and did things with the disciples but then he says after the Holy Spirit he is is still continuing working in and through the apostles and it's the same Christ Paul makes no distinction between Jesus in literal body form and the Holy Spirit he says he's doing the same things he through the Holy Ghost it's just a different form it's the same one it's the same person Amen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God so Jesus Was preparing them for this transition the final portion of the revealing of God it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me so he's saying the spirit of Truth is coming the comforter is coming I'm coming back to you he's saying go there and wait for it wait for the promise to happen for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wil thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel he says it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive one thing power power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you church I want to stop there we're going to do a whole at least one whole service on just that one scripture but I want you to catch with what this power is I was listening to to uh someone this week and they're talking about the the the disciples and they said what we don't have today is the ability that the disciples had to go and heal people according to their own will and it's a complete misunderstanding of scripture Christ himself never went around healing people of his own will so how could the disciples be doing it but yet they had power before this ever happened to raise the dead to heal the sick to cast out demons so that is not the power that we're looking for that comes with it but that is not the power that they needed on the day of Pentecost they needed a power to change that's what they needed not power to raise the dead not power to do signs and wonders that was already in their lives they needed power for a personal indwelling change that would never that would never that that would never go away Peter had an up and down Christian walk until then he needed something that would flatten him out amen that would keep him on the straight and narrow amen keep him from going back and forth and up and down and in and out of the kingdom of God that's the power we need today everything else comes afterwards these signs shall follow that comes afterwards but you need a a a holding power an anchor in this soul to so that God can use you so he can get you settled so he can clean you up and get you ready for him to use in a real way amen you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and guess what we don't get to see that person the world doesn't get to see that body until he comes back with 10,000 times 10,000 of his Saints as king of kings and Lord of lords that's the that's the next time they're going to see him remember at the time of the Resurrection The Rapture we meet him in the clouds we may get to see him in that form but nobody else will get to see him and the world doesn't get to see him until he comes in judgment amen but what does what happens is that body just gets set aside it just gets set aside and what does Jesus do he goes right back into the pillar of fire amen he goes back to what he was before remember we read the scripture he says I come from God I go back to God and what was he doing he was going back to his original form before he walked in flesh he knew what he was before he walked this world in flesh he knew what he was bam would say this he says before you were born God ordained you to be a Christian from the Garden of Eden from before the foundation of the world that's the truth hallelujah that is my anchor every single day that I live this Christian Life is that he chose me he declared me I did not choose him he says before there was ever you knew anything there was a time you knew your mind is darkened to that now he said there's only been one man on Earth that knew that he was before and that was Jesus he said glorify me father with the glory that I have with you before the foundation of the world he was the Incarnate God he could move back there and know what it was he says but our minds are blackened there he knew who he was I come from God I go back to God glorify me with the glory which I had before the world began what is it in the pillar of fire the very indwelling God Amen but remember what he said he says I'm going to be in you he doesn't say a second person or a third person of the Trinity he says I'll be in you in the form of the Holy Spirit and that would be the final revealing of God to humanity he said he would be with us and he said that he would be in us so we've got a God that's with us and in us so now we've got two forms at the end if we wanted to look at it that way it was Pillar of Fire then it was Christ but now at the end he says I'm going to be with you and I'm going to be in you so there's going to be a different revealing of God Amen and so now the question is what's that last part going to look like what's going to fill in those two question marks there there amen how will God reveal himself in this final way how will Jesus Christ come again and live inside of us amen what is his form and body now that's the question we're asking where is Jesus Christ today it's a good question we come to Acts 2 and the disciples and the followers of Jesus have been in the upper room all 120 of them for 10 days and they've been waiting Jesus said Terry in other words wait until something happens wait until something happens because if they tried to be what he said they were going to be if they tried to do what he said they would do before this happened they were going to fail miserably religious experience wasn't going to carry him over an anointing on them was not going to take them forward he says I've got to be in you before you move forward in your ministry and this is a very familiar scripture in Acts 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so Jesus said I'm going to be with you and then I'm going to be in you and then the Acts 2 says the Holy Ghost filled them and what does it look like it looks like tongues of fire what did Christ go back to the Pillar of Fire and now what do we see happening in representation the The Dwelling Place of God the pillar of fire comes down and now that is coming back on the True Believers and so we can look at that picture and we can see God With Us what is it it's the pillar of fire all over again but that didn't just stop and hang over them but it went down into their souls and now it's God in us and now we have a picture of God With Us and in us and it's the Holy Spirit in the form of the pillar of fire again that's what's inside of each and every one of us Amen brother BR says it this way he says and God had to become flesh in order to take the sinner's Place God manifested In the Flesh nothing less than God himself now here he was manifested in the flesh to take away the sins of the world and he identified himself in us he identified himself in human flesh that we might be identified in him in deity so deity drops into flesh so that flesh can become deity that's what he's saying here there's a purpose he says see the purpose of it now we find out our identification with our sacrifice the life of the sacrifice in us which is the holy spirit we're talking about the token life he says when that cell was broken it released God that he had Sanctified a people with his own blood and put God in the man again he says God in you eternal life God in you he says when that blood cell was broken in Jesus it released the life back to us so he could come back in us remember we preached on on the atonement and how in at the beginning of this series how that the original token was the blood of the animal but but the purpose of the blood and the sacrifice was so that the life of the innocent could become the life of the guilty they would take my life my guiltiness and I would take on their righteousness but it couldn't happen because it was an animal and an animal life is not compatible with you human life but when a human body could die that life could now come into me and it could take my sins and I could take his righteousness and I could stand redeemed I could stand perfect I could stand acceptable before God that's what he's saying here he says now any Greek scholar knows that word eternal life comes the word zede Zoe which means God's own life he says that's right the only way you can ever have life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life in you see then you have eternal life because he's the only Eternal there is and he says we are the attributes of his thoughts before there was even a foundation of the world or anything all this is just his thinking and where the display of his thoughts of what it was he says therefore as the evening Shadows now are appearing and wrath is ready to be poured out from on high upon the ungodly Nations and upon the ungodly unbeliever upon the professors without a possession upon those things he says I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see where it was standing before I said these things he says now we are living in the shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost he says it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ return back into the believer church this is God living inside of you that's what we're talking about this is not just a flame of fire this is not just a good feeling it's not just a church experience it's not just a camp experience amen God when he filled you with the Holy Spirit placed himself inside of you and from that moment you've been changed from death unto life that's what happened in that moment you went from death into eternal life and this body yes it can be destroyed it can die in time for now but that soul is sealed eternally it is the dwelling place of God and the moment we pass from this life we go into a body waiting for us there and we wait until that resurrection and Rapture morning and then we just come back and we pick this body up and it's glorified and we have a glorious body just like he had here that's what this does to us it cannot we cannot die amen it is just like the body of Christ amen but I want to drive that home this evening do not cheapen the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that sounds like a simp like John brother John who would do that but I think sometimes we take it and we say well it's only a portion of God it's only a little bit of God it's a little bit of everything you can't take a little bit of everything and have anything less than everything when you take a portion of infinite it's still infinite you can't break it up when you have all knowing all powerful inside of you that is all inside of you you take a spoonful of the ocean you get everything that's in the ocean you take a drop of God inside of you and you have everything that is he is inside of you so often we think well because I don't have the fullness I can't be just like Christ says who says who not me not me Jesus said listen I am the light of the world and then by the end he's saying you are the light of the world he's saying there's got to be a change here and when I go away somebody's got to carry the torch and you've got to be able to be the same life that I am let's not cheapen it let's not say I can't do this because I don't have all of God God has given us enough of himself to achieve everything his word says amen whatever battle we're facing whatever blockages this flesh has whatever nature that we have from our DNA whatever it might be whatever our struggles are there is a God that is greater than all of that dwelling on the inside this evening so whether it's sickness whether it's an attitude problem whether it's the thoughts that you have whether it's the inclinations that this flesh has it matters not when God is living inside of you and we can surrender ourselves to him there is nothing he cannot do this evening there's nothing he can't do tomorrow as the change comes up and as the challenges come up and as situations come up we have an answer to every single thing that we face in this life and it is God indwelling in you and God indwelling with me amen what have that to do to our faith this evening what have that to do with our struggles and our thoughts and the things that we we have challenges in our life day by day I am firmly convinced Church there is more to this experience than what I have seen so far amen there is more there is more I have seen wonderful gifts I've seen wonderful manifestations I have felt the presence of God in amazing ways but I want a greater reality day by day and I say Lord live through me live through me if through nobody else live through me I can't make him live in you I can't make you desire but I say Lord let him live through me in a greater way than he did yesterday and the only way he can do it is the more that I Surrender the more that I Surrender the more that I lay myself down and say Lord let your will be my will let your words be my words let your thoughts be my thoughts let your actions be my actions let your reaction be my reaction amen what holds us back prophet of God said it we don't recognize who we are it's not just the fact that I'm a child of God and you're a child of God it's that God is living inside of us I don't know if we can contain that thought but one day it's going to Rapture us brother Braham says when she recognizes when the bride recognizes who she is the rapture will go go that means there's more to be revealed that means there's a greater Revelation there's a greater reality that's coming that's why I believe there's a call in my life and a desire in my life for more of him is because there's more of him to be revealed there's more of him to be had there's more of him to to do greater things in our life amen but we see Christ and he he's shifting and he's shifting and God went from a pillar fire in the beginning to a man called Jesus of Nazareth then he goes back into the pillar of fire and we see that it's Christ All Through the Ages amen he came as fire then he came as a body then he goes back to that Pillar of Fire all over again brother Brown would say this he says and God being infinite he cannot say well I was mistaken 2,000 years ago God is eternal he never did begin he never will end he says and the only way you can ever be like him is to be part of him that great Pillar of Fire that Israel had followed through the Wilderness that great Pillar of Fire was God the angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ he quotes scripture he says Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater Treasures than that of Egypt so he forsook Egypt and followed Christ he says notice on the day of Pentecost what did God do he took that big Pillar of Fire and divided it he says that was himself he said tongues of fire fork tongues clothing tongues come down Fork tongues and said upon each one but I want to jump back real quick here because brother B references that scripture of Moses and he doesn't quote it exactly right and for clarity I wanted to to quote it this this evening just to make this point as we start to close he says by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and Paul says Moses esteem or he was esteeming the repr approach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect under the recompense of the reward what was moses' experience moses' experience was what the burning bush that called himself I am that was moses' experience Jesus said before Abraham was I am so who was it in the burning bush it was Christ in a body of fire and then what does he do he comes to his own people and he tells the story and he says I met God I met I am I am sent me and he told me what I'm going to do and he told me we're going to get out of here and perhaps he was rejected and he was made fun of and people tried to copy him and he faced hardship for Time After Time After Time and he took that reproach for a while but in the end what happened exactly what God Said would happen but he had to bear that reproach for the longest time he bore the reproach of being a a deliverer That Couldn't deliver of trying and failing but yet the word of God was in him he was a portion of that word amen but notice why Moses did what he did the scripture says he had respect under the recompense of the reward that that means he looked forward and away to the reward he didn't look at the path that he was going through he looked at what waited at the end of the path it's the same thing Jesus did for the joy that laid before him he went to the cross Moses looked and he saw the path he saw it was the The Way of the rejected it's the way of the few nobody was going to believe him he was going to have to go through hard times but like Christ he saw what was at the end of it and on that he said I'll do it and he went of his own free will but who did he experience he had experienced Christ Paul said not Jehovah he doesn't say it was Jehovah he doesn't even call him Lord he says it was Christ the anointed one in the pillar of fire and if we look at who that Pillar of Fire is we can look at Saul who became Paul his own experience on the road to Damascus and we've talked about this many times but just to close this and wrap it up in a nice bow tie this evening Saul it says yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughters against the Disciples of the Lord went under the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way if he found any Christians whether they were men or women he might bring them bound under Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from Heaven what is it what is that light it's a pillar of light it's a pillar of fire it's the same thing that Moses saw on the mountain it's the same thing that led the children of Israel it's the same as the burning bush it's light from Heaven it's the dwelling place of God he said and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice this is a speaking light again where do we see that we see that with Moses we see that the pillar of fire in different places and it said unto him saying Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks now notice when the pillar fire came down on the day of Pentecost it divided itself in the upper room amen so now the Holy Spirit Christ himself is in dwelling 120 people and then Peter goes down the stairs preaches the sermon of his life and 3,000 other people get the Holy Ghost so now we've got 3,120 people with the Holy Ghost 3,120 people with the spirit of Truth 3,120 people with the comforter Jesus said I'll come to you I'll be with you and I'll be in you and so 3,120 people have Jesus Christ living on the inside in the form of the Holy Spirit now Saul is riding a horse on his way to Damascus and that pillar fire knocks him off of his high horse and Saul who's well versed in the word says who are you cuz he says Saul Saul why are you persecuting me and Saul says who are you talking about this is a light speaking from Heaven saying Saul you're persecuting me has Saul been throwing a pillar of light into the jails has he been whipping them beating them Saul hasn't touched the pillar of fire Saul hasn't touched the literal body of Jesus but this Pillar of Fire says you've been persecuting me and he says who are you Lord and what does the pillar of fire say I'm Jesus I'm Jesus that you're persecuting God had changed his form yet again and now he's in a pillar of fire and he's revealed his proper name and he says it's Jesus but Watch What Happens now because Paul confirms who he talked to 1 Corinthians 15:3 says for I have delivered unto you first of all that which I received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again on the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of sephus then of the 12 when was he seen of them in a glorified body look just like flesh right after that he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are falling asleep he says he appeared to 500 or more people and many of them are still alive listening to me or reading my my service or or my message here some have died he says and after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles in what form in that glorified flesh in a physical body looking human like that and then Paul says and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of due time now how did Paul see him as a pillar of fire and Paul makes no distinction between the Jesus he saw and the Jesus that they saw none whatsoever he says I saw the same Jesus and yet the visible appearance was completely different one was a light from Heaven and the other one was a physical body and Paul said I saw Jesus the same as you did not only that but that Jesus that was in that Pillar of Fire says you're persecuting me and like I said Paul Saul was now going around throwing Jesus into jail he wasn't throwing a pillar of fire into jail he couldn't touch that Pillar of Fire he didn't know he had no experience with that Pillar of Fire until now but who was Paul doing that to he was doing it to Believers he was doing it to people that had been in the upper room people that had received the New Birth by the Holy Spirit and Jesus comes and he says there's three ,1 120 of me on this Earth and you're persecuting me what is it it's the final revealing of Christ Jesus himself makes no difference between brother Mark and the pillar of fire that's what he's saying he's saying Saul you're persecuting me in flesh all over again and the only difference is the literal body same pillar fire as in brother Mark as is is in Sister Kimberly back there in the corner and for everyone that's received the new birth this evening Christ himself made no distinction between him in that Pillar of Fire and you walking this road this evening he says it's all me if trinitarians believe that everyone that has the the the life of God in them is a part of the godhead then now we've got 3,123 people at a minimum in the godhead but that's not it it's just the same God revealing himself over and over and over again and what was Christ saying to Paul he was saying Paul you didn't C Saul you didn't catch it I was there in flesh but I've changed my form and I'm in flesh all over again and it's me Paul it's me that you're doing this too amen Paul would continue in Colossians he says wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from a ages and from Generations but now this was hidden for thousands of years he says but now it's made manifest to who his Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory what a scripture Church the final revealing the the the grand reveal the thing that God has been trying to do for thousands and thousands of years Paul says it's here and it's you every saint every True Believer that has received the Holy Spirit God is now revealing himself through you God above us in the pillar of fire God With Us in the form of a man named Jesus and now he's living in a multi-member body called the bride of Christ and that is the final revealing of Jesus Christ that's the final revealing of Jesus Christ is in you and I as we said before Jesus said there I am the light of the world why because the light was dwelling in him and that light was the life of men the scripture says but that light now goes into you and I into you and I and now ye are the light of the world and he says a city on a hill cannot be hidden I've been listening to the Token I listened to it just a few months ago at the start of this and I'm listening to it again and I shared it with some of some of the the the people in The church here yesterday I think it was and he says you you cannot hide that token you cannot hide it it has to be on display and he says you think well I don't want so and so at work to know or I don't want this one to know he says you cannot hide it it has to be public in order to be recognized amen that's the mystery that God's been trying to reveal up to 4,000 years before Pentecost and there were glimpses of it and we'll touch on that as we go through this series amen We There were types and shadows showing that Christ was revealing himself and he would be revealed in the prop phets and he'd be revealed in the heroes of the faith men and women alike amen but now now we're in the final revealing and if you look at it it goes through seven Church ages and it's at the beginning he says it's me I'm Alpha and then at the end he says I'm Omega and it's the revealing of Christ at the beginning in that first church age and now he's right back here and he's doing the same thing in this church age and it's in you and me seven Church ages seven part portions of the Bride seven battles seven groups of Overcomers and every one of them had the same thing in common they could hear what the spirit was saying they could identify where the word was they could accept it they could obey it and they could live it and that's all it took doesn't sound like much does it if you can hear what the spirit's saying and you can listen to it and you can receive it you'll be an overcomer because what it's not something outside of you it's something that comes inside of you we're not here to listen to Services we're not here to listen to a preacher we're here to receive the engrafted word amen that's what's going on and the spirit quickens that inside of our life and that's what it produces is a son and a daughter of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's you amen that's you let's stand if we would amen can you imagine walking out those doors and you tell somebody if you want to see Jesus Christ look at me not out of Pride not out of Pride but say if you want to see Jesus Christ he's right here not the person the way he was not in the sinless Perfection but there is a life inside of me that I can't live except that he lives inside of me and what you're seeing is nothing less than God veiled in flesh all over again the world can't receive it but yet you'll run into people you'll run into people and they see something and they don't know what it is and it draws them and it draws them and it draws them and by God's grace they'll come in and sometimes it takes decades and sometimes they literally meet you once and it's like a light switch goes off and they recognize what you have who you have and who you are and they say I want that some of them are the most religious people in the world and some of them are the darkest most lost people you'd ever meet and yet there's a seed inside of them that comes through a quickening when they come across the word and it's not a word that you preach it's a word that's alive amen it's Christ Living in you the hope of glory amen what do you see in that picture there what is it it's the word that's what was in his mind at the very beginning that's all we are right now is the word made flesh it's what he thought it's what he spoke and now it's being produced in a multimember bride and it's just the word it's the thoughts it's the attributes it's the expectations it's the nature of God being brought into reality in Believers lives today it's just the fulfilling of his word and when that word is fulfilled we get to go and that's the final fulfillment and then we step into and we've got some things to do we've got a marriage supper of the lamb and then we've got a millennium and these different things but really once we're out of here it's done there's no stopping us at that point but it's just the word the word the word and see we can put Christ back at the beginning and then we can say he came into flesh but if he was the word and we're a part of it then the word that was back there has to come in flesh today and that's all that you have in the Holy Ghost is the word becoming flesh and it's there to produce that inside of our Lives amen it's so simple we make it so complicated I think so many times but we sing that song let your word be born that's what the holy spirit's doing is it's producing the word inside of us and making making Christ live all over again amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord if we could only receive the Simplicity Lord of your revealing today Lord if we could humble ourselves to get ourselves out of the way Lord and yet have faith rise up so that we could recognize who's living inside of us lord lord it's so often a push and a pull at the same time Lord that we'd not get so caught up in the goodness of God that that's in US Lord that we forget that there's a battle that's going on Lord and that we've got to keep it under subjection day by day but Lord we have indwelling God inside of us this evening Lord each one that's received your spirit Lord and I know Lord your word declares there's a greater unveiling of God yet to happen Lord and it's happening in your bride in this age Lord and I pray you help us to be an accurate reflection Lord not just in word only Lord but above all in our lives Lord let our words be seasoned with grace and mercy Lord May our nature reflect the call of the Bride that says come come partake freely while there's yet Time Lord won't you fill us a new Lord I need you more than ever Lord we need you more than ever Lord would you help our eyes to be firmly Set On You Lord on your word day by day Lord may we focus on the things of God lord may we seek your will and your way day by day Lord and wake up each morning Lord with a revelation Lord of your purpose and your plan for our lives Lord God lord we ask your grace to each one remembering sister Melody Lord
