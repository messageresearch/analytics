[1:00:45] in the world there's nothing like
[1:00:47] the life of christ in the body of christ
[1:00:50] and it was a number of years ago my wife
[1:00:52] and i we went to ukraine actually and we
[1:00:55] were in donetsk it's the russian part of
[1:00:58] of ukraine and we were there for i think
[1:01:01] 54 56 hours we had three services we
[1:01:04] couldn't speak the language
[1:01:06] and we left it was with like tears in
[1:01:08] our eyes because we become bonded
[1:01:10] together with those people
[1:01:12] that just can't be reproduced so we feel
[1:01:15] like that here a little bit too like
[1:01:17] it's
[1:01:18] we'd like to take some of you home with
[1:01:19] us and
[1:01:22] you know we we've certainly enjoyed it
[1:01:25] and and uh
[1:01:26] i'm gonna miss some things here i'm
[1:01:28] gonna miss some of the singing and the
[1:01:30] worship i'm gonna miss
[1:01:32] the pitter-patter of feet in the morning
[1:01:34] and uh
[1:01:35] and as i said earlier you know they've
[1:01:37] got three boys and so i'm not pointing
[1:01:40] to selena doing all of that i'm pointing
[1:01:42] to the boys doing all of that so
[1:01:44] but uh they've been a blessing so and
[1:01:47] this morning i think jensen had said he
[1:01:50] said
[1:01:51] are you is this the last service and and
[1:01:53] i thought he's going to say oh
[1:01:55] thankfully but he didn't he said i love
[1:01:58] special services
[1:02:00] and i thought wow that's great that's a
[1:02:02] great expectation
[1:02:04] to have so we've certainly enjoyed it i
[1:02:07] think brother dale if you've enjoyed the
[1:02:09] time here and
[1:02:10] enjoyed having you
[1:02:12] just pray for the perfect will of god in
[1:02:14] brother dale's life we sure appreciate
[1:02:17] him i know he's got a family back home
[1:02:18] that really loves them too and we
[1:02:20] appreciate them in the church but we
[1:02:22] want god's will in all things so so this
[1:02:25] morning we we want to look to the word
[1:02:28] of god again and
[1:02:29] and sometimes
[1:02:31] you know we we just want to be ourselves
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:34] so i want to be myself this morning
[1:02:37] i learned a long time ago i i played
[1:02:39] football i played sports when i was
[1:02:40] younger i played
[1:02:43] the high school football team i wasn't
[1:02:45] saved at the time but i was i was a
[1:02:47] junior that year and
[1:02:49] i i watched the first game of the season
[1:02:51] and the captain came out and the coaches
[1:02:53] left the room and were in the room and
[1:02:56] and the captains are there and the big
[1:02:57] burly guys and so they picked up their
[1:02:59] helmet and they threw it against the
[1:03:01] wall are we gonna kill them are we gonna
[1:03:03] and everybody just jumped around and
[1:03:05] rallied around and we all ran out in the
[1:03:07] field and we just burned into the field
[1:03:10] so the next year i was captain of the
[1:03:11] team and i thought well that's what
[1:03:12] captains do so i picked up my helmet
[1:03:14] threw it again so are we going to kill
[1:03:16] him and everybody sat there
[1:03:17] like oh you got to be who you are
[1:03:20] so i can't be the fiery evangelist i got
[1:03:23] to be brother ed and so that's what i
[1:03:26] want to be and and we we just we
[1:03:28] certainly don't want to to be more than
[1:03:30] we're not and um
[1:03:32] you know so we want to just let god have
[1:03:35] his way do you do you know i just want
[1:03:37] to sing a little bit of that song let

[1:07:11] amen thank you to the musicians god
[1:07:14] bless you well we'll invite you to turn
[1:07:16] to the book of genesis
[1:07:18] genesis chapter 2
[1:07:22] and i'll just cover
[1:07:24] all of genesis to revelations in my
[1:07:26] opening scriptures i'll go in genesis 2
[1:07:29] and then in revelations 8. how does that
[1:07:31] sound and then we'll we'll just try and
[1:07:33] preach a little in between
[1:07:35] genesis 2
[1:07:36] we'll start reading in verse 1
[1:07:41] and
[1:07:44] it's a seed chapter it's
[1:07:47] so much
[1:07:48] always in these books
[1:07:51] as we read verse 1 thus the heavens and
[1:07:53] the earth were finished
[1:07:55] and all the host of them
[1:07:57] and on the seventh day god ended his
[1:08:00] work which he had made he rested on the
[1:08:04] seventh day
[1:08:05] from all his work which he had made
[1:08:08] and god blessed the seventh day
[1:08:11] and he sanctified it
[1:08:13] because that in it he had rested from
[1:08:16] all the work
[1:08:18] which god created and made
[1:08:21] verse four these are the generations of
[1:08:24] the heaven
[1:08:25] heavens and of the earth when they were
[1:08:27] created
[1:08:29] in the day that the lord god made the
[1:08:31] earth and the heavens
[1:08:33] and every plant
[1:08:36] of the field before it was in the earth
[1:08:39] and every herb of the field before it
[1:08:42] grew
[1:08:43] for the lord god had not caused it to
[1:08:46] rain upon the earth and there was not
[1:08:49] a man to till the ground
[1:08:52] so
[1:08:53] it looked like it was all quiet it
[1:08:55] looked like there was nothing happening
[1:08:58] but there was something at work that
[1:09:00] could not be seen
[1:09:02] and it began to manifest and plants
[1:09:05] began to come up and all of these things
[1:09:08] and it seemingly didn't didn't know how
[1:09:10] it came
[1:09:11] but it came from within it came from a
[1:09:14] mist of the earth it wasn't an outward
[1:09:16] rain it wasn't all these other things
[1:09:18] but it was a mist of the earth and it
[1:09:21] watered the whole face of the ground
[1:09:23] verse 6
[1:09:24] verse 7 and the lord god formed man of
[1:09:27] the dust of the ground
[1:09:29] and he breathed into his nostrils the
[1:09:31] breath of life and man became a living
[1:09:35] soul
[1:09:36] and the lord god planted a garden
[1:09:39] eastward in eden
[1:09:41] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:09:44] formed
[1:09:45] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:09:48] to grow every tree
[1:09:51] that is pleasant to the sight
[1:09:53] and good for food the tree of life also
[1:09:57] in the midst of of the garden and the
[1:10:00] tree of knowledge of good and evil we
[1:10:04] find from that a river went forth it
[1:10:06] parted had four heads but drop down to
[1:10:10] verse 15
[1:10:12] and the lord god took the man
[1:10:15] and he put him in the garden of eden
[1:10:18] to dress it
[1:10:20] and to keep it
[1:10:23] to dress it and to keep it revelations
[1:10:26] chapter 8
[1:10:28] just read one verse
[1:10:31] i might not come to this till later in
[1:10:32] the service but i will the lord willing
[1:10:35] bring it into where we go
[1:10:37] revelations eight
[1:10:39] i'll just read from verse one
[1:10:43] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:10:46] there was silence in heaven
[1:10:48] about the space
[1:10:50] of half an hour
[1:10:52] amen god bless his word this morning you
[1:10:55] may have your seats
[1:11:00] i'm going to ask you also to turn over
[1:11:03] to john chapter 20
[1:11:05] john chapter 20.
[1:11:08] and
[1:11:09] not that this isn't relevant but it's
[1:11:12] maybe not so much in the entire theme of
[1:11:16] where i'm going but i do want to bring
[1:11:18] this in
[1:11:20] and
[1:11:22] i'll just read a little portion of this
[1:11:25] it was the first day of the week when
[1:11:28] cometh in verse 1 cometh mary magdalene
[1:11:31] early it was yet dark unto the sepulcher
[1:11:34] and seeing the stone from the sepulcher
[1:11:36] now i'll i'll forego some of the reading
[1:11:39] but
[1:11:41] she
[1:11:42] it was early and she'd come to the
[1:11:44] sepulcher where jesus was and saw the
[1:11:46] stone rolled away
[1:11:48] so the first thing she did she went to
[1:11:50] his disciples
[1:11:52] and she called simon peter and she
[1:11:55] called john and and he said they've
[1:11:57] taken the lord away and peter began to
[1:12:00] go forth and the other disciple and it
[1:12:02] says they ran together then the
[1:12:04] scriptures also declare that john was
[1:12:06] faster than peter because he outran him
[1:12:08] and he came first
[1:12:10] and you know it's interesting that john
[1:12:12] wrote this and he didn't put his own
[1:12:13] name because he wasn't boasting but he
[1:12:15] said the other disciple that was with
[1:12:17] peter outran him you know and so
[1:12:19] sometimes it was like in the third
[1:12:21] person and so it says in verse five and
[1:12:23] he stooped down he looked and he saw the
[1:12:25] linen clothes lying yet he went not in
[1:12:28] um so he's standing there he came up to
[1:12:30] it he's respectful but peter you know
[1:12:32] the bold one he followed him he just
[1:12:34] burst right in he saw the clothes there
[1:12:36] this is really interesting to me and in
[1:12:38] verse 7 and the napkin which was about
[1:12:41] his head
[1:12:42] not lying with the linen clothes but it
[1:12:45] was wrapped together in a place to
[1:12:47] itself so it was interesting they
[1:12:49] thought you know out of all of the
[1:12:50] analogies they stole his body what kind
[1:12:53] of a soldier is going to steal his body
[1:12:55] or disciples going to steal his body
[1:12:57] then take the napkin off his head and
[1:12:58] fold it quietly down on the side and
[1:13:00] leave the rest laying there all of these
[1:13:02] things are for a reason can you imagine
[1:13:04] what happened somewhere in all of this
[1:13:06] jesus awoke he arose he took the napkin
[1:13:10] off he folded it he left the clothes it
[1:13:13] was the lord it was him that was working
[1:13:17] so then he it says in verse 8 then came
[1:13:20] in the other disciple and and it said
[1:13:22] they didn't know the scriptures
[1:13:24] that the lord had risen from the dead
[1:13:27] and they went home
[1:13:28] but mary she remained in verse 11
[1:13:32] mary stood outside the sepulcher weeping
[1:13:35] and as she wept she stooped down and
[1:13:38] looked at the sepulcher and now here's
[1:13:40] an amazing thing two angels were sitting
[1:13:43] and she saw two angels in white sitting
[1:13:45] there
[1:13:46] one at the head the other at the feet
[1:13:49] wherein the body of jesus had lain and
[1:13:52] they they began speaking to her and said
[1:13:55] woman
[1:13:56] why are you weeping
[1:13:58] she said because they've taken away my
[1:14:00] lord and i don't know where they've laid
[1:14:03] him
[1:14:04] and when she thus said she turned back
[1:14:07] now she's just speaking to angels and
[1:14:10] now she turns around
[1:14:12] and she saw jesus standing but she
[1:14:14] didn't know it was jesus
[1:14:18] and jesus said unto her
[1:14:20] woman why weepest thou
[1:14:22] whom seeketh thou
[1:14:24] now she goes from this
[1:14:26] experience of the angels these events
[1:14:29] and everything and then she sees him and
[1:14:31] then she says this next verse
[1:14:33] she supposed him to be the gardener
[1:14:37] you know so she thought oh this is just
[1:14:39] one of the workers that's here he's the
[1:14:40] gardener and she said sir if you have if
[1:14:44] thou has borne him hence
[1:14:46] tell me where you've laid him and i will
[1:14:48] take him away
[1:14:50] and out of all the words she heard
[1:14:53] these next words that would come for had
[1:14:55] the most profound effect on her
[1:14:58] and it was jesus himself saying unto her
[1:15:01] and he said mary
[1:15:04] now there's nothing so
[1:15:06] great
[1:15:08] as to hear your own name amen
[1:15:10] and yet to hear your own name from the
[1:15:13] lips of god or jesus would be the
[1:15:16] greatest name
[1:15:17] to know that he has spoken
[1:15:20] personally to you
[1:15:22] that's the greatest thing that we could
[1:15:24] ever have
[1:15:25] and she so posed him to be a guardish as
[1:15:27] mary
[1:15:28] and turned herself and said rabboni
[1:15:31] which is to say master now i'm not going
[1:15:33] to read into all of the rest but
[1:15:35] he'll he said don't touch me and and
[1:15:37] mary came to the disciples but i'm
[1:15:40] drawing from this and like i said this
[1:15:41] may not be as much where i'm
[1:15:43] going but i want to speak
[1:15:45] this morning and this may
[1:15:47] seem simple
[1:15:48] but i want to speak on the gardener
[1:15:51] and so i'm going to ask you just to bear
[1:15:53] with me as i do that
[1:15:55] i was talking to brother ron spencer one
[1:15:58] time
[1:15:59] and he was sharing to me he was at some
[1:16:01] special meetings and there was quite a
[1:16:02] crowd that was gathered
[1:16:04] and he'd spoke three services and he's
[1:16:06] coming up to the sunday morning service
[1:16:09] and he said this is the one that he'd
[1:16:11] actually prepared for and this is
[1:16:13] something god had laid on my heart and
[1:16:15] it seems strange
[1:16:16] but i i'm just following the lord and
[1:16:18] this this example will tell you that but
[1:16:21] he said he was coming to the last
[1:16:22] service he'd preach the saturday night
[1:16:25] and now he's coming to the sunday
[1:16:26] morning and as he's coming that saturday
[1:16:29] night he's looking at his text he's
[1:16:31] saying that's not going to work
[1:16:35] and and the lord directed him to
[1:16:38] a scripture about the woman caught in
[1:16:40] adultery
[1:16:42] and he's going lord this is a convention
[1:16:44] these are seasoned
[1:16:46] uh believers these are are all people
[1:16:49] they've gathered this this is this is
[1:16:52] like not this doesn't fit in my mind
[1:16:55] this this doesn't fit and and he
[1:16:57] couldn't get away from and he said i've
[1:16:58] learned long time ago he says just
[1:17:01] follow the lord
[1:17:03] so i'm i i'm doing the same thing and so
[1:17:05] brother ron as he tells the account he
[1:17:07] says he came to this service and you
[1:17:09] know he apologized for what he was
[1:17:10] saying and he did all of these things
[1:17:12] and and he started preaching it and he
[1:17:14] he was going into the service and as
[1:17:17] he's going into the service he's about
[1:17:19] two-thirds of the way through and
[1:17:21] there's a weeping and there's a wailing
[1:17:23] and and a woman
[1:17:24] just comes running up to the front and
[1:17:27] casts herself at the altar and starts
[1:17:30] weeping and crying
[1:17:32] and what he didn't know is she was a
[1:17:34] prostitute
[1:17:35] who was going to kill herself the night
[1:17:37] before
[1:17:39] and some believer had invited her
[1:17:42] to the service
[1:17:46] hallelujah god knows everything amen
[1:17:50] and brother ron said it taught him a
[1:17:52] huge lesson
[1:17:54] god is so sovereign
[1:17:56] he knows what he's doing
[1:17:58] so this morning we believe that same god
[1:18:01] i'm not
[1:18:02] saying it's the same way but i i so
[1:18:04] appreciate the lord
[1:18:06] i so appreciate him being mindful of
[1:18:09] every one of us he knows everyone here
[1:18:12] today he knows all things
[1:18:15] go with me to the book of matthew
[1:18:17] chapter 11.
[1:18:18] i want to speak first of all if i break
[1:18:21] this into little thoughts i want to
[1:18:22] speak a little bit on our expectations
[1:18:26] and
[1:18:27] on our expectations and i'm going to use
[1:18:30] john for a moment here
[1:18:33] and this is in matthew chapter 11 verse
[1:18:36] 2
[1:18:37] and and now john was the forerunner
[1:18:41] before jesus christ he was
[1:18:44] a part of the five comings of elijah he
[1:18:48] was
[1:18:49] the forerunner that was identified in
[1:18:51] malachi 4. there's another forerunner
[1:18:54] identified in malachi 4. but but he
[1:18:58] he's he's he's one of them now matthew
[1:19:01] chapter 11
[1:19:03] would talk about this and i want to read
[1:19:05] verse 2. john was in prison and when
[1:19:07] john had heard in prison
[1:19:09] the works of christ he sent two of his
[1:19:12] disciples and he said unto him
[1:19:15] art thou he that should come
[1:19:18] or do we look for another and jesus
[1:19:21] answered and said unto him
[1:19:23] so here is john
[1:19:25] he's the one who in the spirit had seen
[1:19:28] jesus had seen his coming was at the
[1:19:30] river was baptizing him pointed to him
[1:19:34] said behold the lamb of god and now he's
[1:19:36] out from under that anointing and he's
[1:19:39] asking this question and brother bannon
[1:19:41] would say his eagle eye got filmed over
[1:19:44] but he's asking the question to his
[1:19:46] disciples go ask jesus are you the one
[1:19:49] that should come or do we look for
[1:19:51] another now in other words he must have
[1:19:54] had an expectation he knew the anointing
[1:19:57] he was under he knew what he was
[1:20:00] pointing to he knew this was god's fire
[1:20:03] burning through his bones and he looked
[1:20:05] at it but when he saw the manifestation
[1:20:08] he's thought this can't be it
[1:20:10] this this is surely this isn't it i'm
[1:20:13] expecting more and so here he's sitting
[1:20:15] there and he's saying art though he that
[1:20:17] should come or do we look for another
[1:20:19] and jesus answered and he said unto him
[1:20:21] go and show john again the things that
[1:20:25] you do hear and see
[1:20:27] the blind receive their sight
[1:20:30] the lame walk the lepers are cleansed
[1:20:33] the deaf here the dead are raised up and
[1:20:36] the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:20:39] them
[1:20:40] and then he says these words in verse 6
[1:20:43] and blessed is he
[1:20:45] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[1:20:49] now so there was an offense
[1:20:52] that came with what the eye would look
[1:20:55] on in the ministry of jesus and i'm
[1:20:58] going to read this a little bit out of
[1:21:00] the message that that brother branham
[1:21:02] would speak and it's entitled
[1:21:04] the forgotten beatitude in 1961
[1:21:07] but he says john said
[1:21:10] he knew that was the messiah john said i
[1:21:12] don't know him but it's the one that the
[1:21:14] wilderness
[1:21:16] in the wilderness he says i upon whom
[1:21:18] you see the spirit descending that will
[1:21:19] baptize with holy ghost and fire
[1:21:22] verse and the brother man says but when
[1:21:24] the trouble set in
[1:21:26] jesus come and showed the messiah that
[1:21:29] he was the messiah but then something
[1:21:32] went wrong
[1:21:34] john had introduced the messiah with a
[1:21:36] fan in his hand going to burn up the
[1:21:39] chaff and he turned out the works of
[1:21:41] christ he was and it says this he was
[1:21:44] meek and lowly
[1:21:47] and it worried him
[1:21:49] now this is amazing because the
[1:21:51] expectation is
[1:21:53] you know
[1:21:54] i'm setting for something greater but
[1:21:56] he's meek and he's lowly
[1:21:58] and it worried him this is exact words
[1:22:00] he says he didn't know what to say he
[1:22:04] said now there's something wrong here
[1:22:07] somewhere
[1:22:09] now
[1:22:10] it seemed he hadn't believed
[1:22:13] it seemed he had believed the wrong
[1:22:16] thing it seemed like it wasn't working
[1:22:19] out right now don't just put john over
[1:22:21] here put yourself that way how often
[1:22:24] have we gone through things and we think
[1:22:27] this can't be god this surely this isn't
[1:22:30] it and yet in in the middle of all this
[1:22:32] it's not working out right you know
[1:22:34] whatever our our personality is
[1:22:36] sometimes there's some of us that build
[1:22:39] bridges and and we think it has to be a
[1:22:41] certain way you know and and if this
[1:22:43] doesn't come this way you know we cross
[1:22:45] our bridges before we come you know
[1:22:48] sometimes we come to church and we think
[1:22:50] it has to be in this order it has to be
[1:22:52] this way and if it's not that way it
[1:22:54] throws us for a loop
[1:22:56] but god does things in his own way and
[1:22:59] we want to be able to always be open you
[1:23:01] know i there was a brother i think it
[1:23:03] was brother doug mckees i may be wrong
[1:23:05] on that but uh
[1:23:07] my brother brother was sharing it with
[1:23:09] me the other day and it was just
[1:23:10] profound to me brother daniel andes who
[1:23:12] had grown up around jeffersonville and
[1:23:13] he he tells the story how brother doug
[1:23:16] had in his mind that you come to the
[1:23:18] pulpit you always dress a certain way
[1:23:21] you have long sleeves you do such and
[1:23:23] such you do this and he'd come to a
[1:23:25] meeting and brother branham was
[1:23:26] preaching and in the middle of the
[1:23:28] service brother madam takes his coat off
[1:23:30] and he had short sleeves on
[1:23:33] and brother doug was horrified he goes
[1:23:36] this can't be a man of god
[1:23:38] he has short sleeves on and brother bam
[1:23:41] took his took them off for a little bit
[1:23:43] and then he put his coat back on and he
[1:23:45] and then he just said something across
[1:23:47] the pulpit i don't know what it was see
[1:23:49] it's not always what we think
[1:23:51] [Laughter]
[1:23:52] i think god knows exactly where we're at
[1:23:55] i think it was said in prayer this
[1:23:56] morning again we don't try and put god
[1:23:59] in a box we we don't try and
[1:24:01] predetermine the manifestation the
[1:24:04] manifestation and we're living in
[1:24:05] manifesting times we don't try to do it
[1:24:09] we want to just create the atmosphere
[1:24:12] and the place for god to work and
[1:24:14] whatever he chooses to do he chooses to
[1:24:17] do
[1:24:18] i i i appreciate all of that so brother
[1:24:21] madam goes on to say
[1:24:23] it's not working out right and many
[1:24:25] times we think that too
[1:24:27] it isn't working out right as long as we
[1:24:30] know that he's here
[1:24:32] what difference does it make
[1:24:35] it says it's working right maybe it
[1:24:38] isn't working according to the way
[1:24:41] we think it ought to work but it's
[1:24:43] working according to the way
[1:24:46] that god wants it to work so we went
[1:24:49] into that a little bit when we read mark
[1:24:51] chapter 11 yesterday when we
[1:24:53] predetermined there has to be a certain
[1:24:55] manifestation jesus spoke to the tree
[1:24:58] you didn't know i didn't know that it
[1:25:00] would start to dry up from the roots we
[1:25:02] thought maybe the fig trees any the
[1:25:04] branches will wither but it started from
[1:25:06] the roots it was evident god had spoken
[1:25:09] to it and so here we sometimes we're
[1:25:12] we're building our relationship not on
[1:25:14] what our eyes can see but on trust and
[1:25:17] upon faith and sometimes we pray things
[1:25:20] and we pray for situations and we think
[1:25:23] it's going to happen this way you know
[1:25:25] we think oh i whatever your need may be
[1:25:27] it's a financial need and sometimes we
[1:25:29] begin to work it out and we think okay i
[1:25:31] know it's not right to buy lottery
[1:25:33] tickets but this is a good you know it's
[1:25:35] for a hospital charity and maybe this is
[1:25:37] how god will solve all my issues that's
[1:25:39] generally not the way god works
[1:25:42] and so we always look for god to fulfill
[1:25:44] himself he works in an unusual way he
[1:25:47] displays his characteristics in an
[1:25:50] unusual way and it goes beyond our
[1:25:52] thinking it operates on a level beyond
[1:25:55] what we think so christ's expectation
[1:25:59] you know here i i always marvel at
[1:26:01] at uh
[1:26:03] at our human nature and you you type in
[1:26:05] the words prone to think and and brother
[1:26:08] baby says too often that's how man's
[1:26:10] prone to think and i found myself many
[1:26:12] times in that side yeah i've been prone
[1:26:14] to think that way you know jesus calling
[1:26:16] the disciples he called a peter he
[1:26:19] called an andrew he called simon the
[1:26:21] canaanite who they called simon the
[1:26:23] zealot i mean a matthew who was a tax
[1:26:25] collector and and i don't know if you've
[1:26:27] seen any of that of the chosen but it
[1:26:29] kind of brought some thoughts to my mind
[1:26:30] i thought you know these disciples
[1:26:32] they're going you picked him and he says
[1:26:33] i picked you didn't i
[1:26:35] and and so we sometimes think you know
[1:26:37] who's in charge here and what's this
[1:26:39] whole thing about but god's in control
[1:26:42] he knows how it is so sometimes we think
[1:26:44] oh you know this you know the message
[1:26:47] and we take the message and we try to
[1:26:49] make it fit who what we think it should
[1:26:51] be if you come from a pentecostal
[1:26:53] background you think well it's going to
[1:26:55] be signs and wonders it's going to be
[1:26:57] this and that happening every service
[1:26:59] and and and if you're if you allow that
[1:27:02] to carry forward you push into something
[1:27:05] and it's about the sister that came to
[1:27:07] brother branham and she wanted the holy
[1:27:08] ghost and brother bannon would say to
[1:27:10] her and she was a fine sister she had
[1:27:12] the holy ghost but she desired to have
[1:27:15] speaking in tongues and brother adam
[1:27:17] looked he says and i saw that she was
[1:27:18] born in a split condition under a four i
[1:27:20] don't know what that means any any and
[1:27:22] he said this so i advised i asked the
[1:27:25] lord to help her and allow her to speak
[1:27:27] in tongues so it would help her but he
[1:27:29] says you see if you do that to everybody
[1:27:32] you know you'll cause somebody it's not
[1:27:34] our natural makeup the holy ghost
[1:27:36] expresses himself in many ways
[1:27:39] our our natural is sometimes god uses a
[1:27:42] minister to bless us and and we think oh
[1:27:44] this is the minister this is the guy for
[1:27:46] the hour this is the one i want to
[1:27:48] follow i'm going to stream all his
[1:27:49] services i i made that mistake years ago
[1:27:52] and i i had a minister that came through
[1:27:54] and was a blessing and i thought next
[1:27:55] time we come and i was just looking at
[1:27:57] this is going to be tremendous and and i
[1:27:59] was looking to him and it just like
[1:28:02] it's not the same what's going on
[1:28:04] and and it was i realized keep my eyes
[1:28:07] on god first
[1:28:09] see if we could we'd build a perfect
[1:28:11] minister we'd build we'd build somebody
[1:28:14] fiery like brother donnie we'd somebody
[1:28:16] we'd have somebody like brother paul who
[1:28:18] could who could speak or it could just
[1:28:21] drop into a song at the end of the
[1:28:23] service then we'd take somebody who'd go
[1:28:25] into deep things in teaching and we'd
[1:28:27] build this minister in our mind you know
[1:28:29] and we think and if we had that
[1:28:31] everybody would be running around the
[1:28:33] country after this one guy but god so
[1:28:35] designed it he took little parts of
[1:28:38] everybody and he gave a little bit to
[1:28:40] this one he gave a little bit to that
[1:28:41] one a little bit to that one and what we
[1:28:43] need to see is christ in every one of
[1:28:45] those gifts and we don't need to just
[1:28:47] look on a personality or look on a man
[1:28:49] but we need to see him
[1:28:51] he's the one who's in the center of it
[1:28:53] all he's the main one the message you
[1:28:56] know and we we group the message oh it's
[1:28:59] just a further part of this it's this
[1:29:00] and this
[1:29:02] i'll give you an example our pastor
[1:29:04] brother harold used this and i found it
[1:29:06] to be a blessing but there was these
[1:29:07] four blind men
[1:29:09] they went to a circus and so they all
[1:29:12] went to the circus and they all went to
[1:29:13] see the elephant
[1:29:15] and they came back with a report
[1:29:17] and they were comparing notes okay what
[1:29:19] did you see in the elephant and you know
[1:29:21] what do you think an elephant is and so
[1:29:23] one of them said
[1:29:24] it's a trunk it's like a tree trunk i
[1:29:27] put my arms around it's a tree trunk for
[1:29:29] sure and the other guy says you're crazy
[1:29:31] it's not a tree trunk it's a wall i
[1:29:34] touch this item it's a wall i can tell
[1:29:36] you right now it's a wall and the other
[1:29:38] guy says
[1:29:39] what were you two guys looking at blind
[1:29:41] man right where were you two guys
[1:29:43] looking at what were you feeling and the
[1:29:45] last guy said the one guy says well you
[1:29:47] know what it's like a rope i was there
[1:29:49] and he was touching his tail it was a
[1:29:50] rope i felt it it was a rope i don't
[1:29:52] know where you guys getting the wall
[1:29:54] thing from i don't know where you're
[1:29:56] getting the you know the the trunk thing
[1:29:58] from and the last guy said oh you guys
[1:30:00] are behind it it's like a vacuum cleaner
[1:30:03] hose
[1:30:04] i saw it it's a trunk i i felt it it's a
[1:30:07] vacuum and they're all comparing notes
[1:30:09] they didn't know is the was was the
[1:30:12] message one of those things or was it
[1:30:14] all of those things
[1:30:16] the message is everything it is signs
[1:30:19] and gifts it is wonders it is emotion it
[1:30:22] is work it is teaching it's all of those
[1:30:24] things it's god in every part of it so
[1:30:27] we don't put god in a box we want to
[1:30:29] allow him to be god we want to allow him
[1:30:32] to be who he is and he's he is
[1:30:35] everything
[1:30:36] amen we were going through church order
[1:30:38] at home one time and and i came across
[1:30:40] the thing where brother madam said jesus
[1:30:42] was a trustee he was a deacon he was a
[1:30:45] minister he was all of these things in
[1:30:47] one and he takes out he was a trustee
[1:30:49] because he was able to get the gold coin
[1:30:51] out of the fish and he was he was a
[1:30:53] deacon because he set this in order and
[1:30:54] he was the teacher and he was the
[1:30:56] minister it's all a part of him
[1:30:59] that's the one you want to see i'll tell
[1:31:02] you what it's when there was up on mount
[1:31:04] transfiguration and and there was moses
[1:31:06] and elijah there and and then peter's
[1:31:09] going let's build three tabernacles one
[1:31:11] for this and this well when the when the
[1:31:13] voice spoke from heaven and the thunder
[1:31:15] cleared there was one left and that one
[1:31:17] was jesus there was none other when this
[1:31:20] whole thing is over it won't be our
[1:31:22] favorite preacher it won't be everything
[1:31:24] there'll be one there when we get to
[1:31:26] heaven there'll be one there that's the
[1:31:28] one we need to see now we can't look at
[1:31:31] and get caught up with these things as
[1:31:33] much as that's our human nature
[1:31:35] but we want to have him
[1:31:37] we want to see him in the center amen
[1:31:40] so there's an expectation sometimes if
[1:31:42] we're not careful we allow our
[1:31:44] expectation to to go in a certain way
[1:31:47] and and whether it's our our nature it's
[1:31:50] our order or whatever these things are
[1:31:52] we we want to be able to see jesus in it
[1:31:54] all
[1:31:56] just to finish the quote here's john the
[1:31:58] baptist he says i introduced the messiah
[1:32:01] he had the fan in his hand i thought he
[1:32:03] was going to purge the floors i thought
[1:32:05] he was going to take the wheat to the
[1:32:07] garner i i thought he was going to take
[1:32:09] the axe to the root of the tree he's
[1:32:12] going to take all the trash and burn it
[1:32:14] up
[1:32:15] this great mighty man
[1:32:17] but here he comes meek and lowly
[1:32:21] something must have went wrong somewhere
[1:32:24] there's no doubt something's wrong
[1:32:26] somewhere
[1:32:27] you know we we came out of
[1:32:30] if you look at the message and how it
[1:32:32] came and
[1:32:33] how it said in malachi 4 it would arise
[1:32:35] with healing in his wings
[1:32:37] and we saw a first pull and it was a
[1:32:39] manifestation that that actually really
[1:32:41] touched the flesh realm
[1:32:43] and and and it touched the flesh realm
[1:32:44] and brother ben had a sign that he would
[1:32:46] it would show up in his flesh and then
[1:32:48] the second pull came and it went into
[1:32:51] the spirit realm and he could discern
[1:32:53] and it seemed like it was coming higher
[1:32:55] and yet the third pull we were all are
[1:32:58] expecting oh yeah it's speaking the word
[1:33:00] into existence and all of these things
[1:33:02] and it seemed like that wasn't how it
[1:33:04] actually went
[1:33:06] it seemed i went up up and then it
[1:33:08] dropped down and you can see that in the
[1:33:10] reflection of brother branham's life in
[1:33:12] the mountain range in idaho
[1:33:14] where it says you know here's your life
[1:33:15] in the ministry these seven peaks and
[1:33:17] this is when this is the first pool this
[1:33:19] is the second pool and then it dropped
[1:33:21] down it seemed like it wasn't as
[1:33:23] prominent or as visible but yet it was
[1:33:26] the greatest and brother man would say
[1:33:27] that third poll it won't be a public
[1:33:30] show
[1:33:31] it's going to be greater than all the
[1:33:33] rest but it's not according to our
[1:33:35] thinking or our expectation and and and
[1:33:38] you know much of the world is now
[1:33:40] looking you know as we're coming to
[1:33:42] world war three this the coming of the
[1:33:44] lord is here you know different people
[1:33:46] have different expectation
[1:33:47] i don't know what they call those groups
[1:33:49] of people that prepare for the
[1:33:50] tribulation they give them a name and
[1:33:52] and they you know they're they're got
[1:33:54] goods and you can go on to these
[1:33:55] websites and they're talking about the
[1:33:57] coming of the lord and says and you can
[1:33:58] buy your canned goods here and you can
[1:34:00] buy these things here they're preparing
[1:34:02] for something else but that's not the
[1:34:04] expectation we're under we're looking
[1:34:06] for one there's a man that can turn on
[1:34:09] the light he's gonna come just in time
[1:34:12] he's never been late yet he will be here
[1:34:15] just in time he'll take care of my
[1:34:18] situation he's always been faithful
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:22] now
[1:34:23] we took this
[1:34:26] let me let me finish this off i just
[1:34:29] john became dismayed like many of us do
[1:34:32] we see things that's going on that isn't
[1:34:35] just right we become dismayed
[1:34:37] don't be weary
[1:34:39] the brother man says the devil got a
[1:34:40] hold of him in in jail there
[1:34:43] he said i throw him in jail
[1:34:45] and and so he he put a blanket over him
[1:34:47] he got him all caged up like an eagle in
[1:34:49] the cage that's the way he does to many
[1:34:52] there's many a good man in that shape
[1:34:54] today
[1:34:55] we think it ain't working out right but
[1:34:58] it's working right so we don't look with
[1:35:01] our eyes
[1:35:02] just stay about the father's business
[1:35:05] don't don't worry about trying to
[1:35:07] produce something or manifest something
[1:35:10] we're we're sheep we can't manufacture
[1:35:13] wool we bear wool we just eat food we we
[1:35:16] those things and the world comes out
[1:35:18] naturally
[1:35:20] amen luke chapter 23.
[1:35:26] i just want to
[1:35:28] go back to this just for a moment
[1:35:33] we read this yesterday about pilate
[1:35:35] and and how jesus came before him and
[1:35:38] and pilate and you know jesus just
[1:35:40] changed the narrative
[1:35:42] sometimes you know you people come and
[1:35:44] the devil you know makes his boasts like
[1:35:47] a goliath over david he makes his boast
[1:35:50] in the time you live in people that have
[1:35:52] gone for the message well what about
[1:35:53] this what about this and you know what
[1:35:55] sometimes you don't answer a word
[1:35:57] other times you just change the question
[1:35:58] say okay what's your ministry and what
[1:36:01] are you pointing to
[1:36:02] we had two men that have been going
[1:36:04] around the country to to message
[1:36:06] churches all over tearing them down and
[1:36:08] well not tearing them down but coming to
[1:36:10] be critical and coming to do this and
[1:36:12] coming to do that and they they they've
[1:36:13] been notorious i don't know if maybe
[1:36:15] newfoundland so out of the way that they
[1:36:16] haven't come here but but i i don't know
[1:36:18] what it is and and some brothers you
[1:36:20] know some of the minister friends i got
[1:36:21] said yeah we showed them a little
[1:36:24] five-fold ministry and then i go you
[1:36:26] didn't actually punch them no we didn't
[1:36:28] do that but we ushered them out rather
[1:36:30] briskly he said so and and and and and
[1:36:33] so these two men came in and i happened
[1:36:35] to know one of them and i thought like
[1:36:37] how in the world did you ever end up in
[1:36:38] this state and i he came to our church
[1:36:41] and i kind of circumvented it i just
[1:36:43] addressed him from the book nice to see
[1:36:44] you why don't we chat after service you
[1:36:46] know and and so we chatted after service
[1:36:48] we met two hours they were just telling
[1:36:51] us everything that's wrong with the
[1:36:52] message everything that's this and this
[1:36:53] and this and then i finally said okay
[1:36:56] what's your ministry
[1:36:57] amen and it says where's your fruit
[1:37:00] where's what you're what are you
[1:37:02] pointing to well that's not who we're
[1:37:03] here we're just against i mean there's
[1:37:05] people like that all over the world that
[1:37:07] are against things
[1:37:09] there's nothing positive you know you
[1:37:10] you try and be positive people say
[1:37:12] spring's coming yeah but it won't be too
[1:37:14] long before winter's here again you know
[1:37:16] it's a nice day out there well it'll
[1:37:18] probably snow tomorrow and like i'm not
[1:37:20] going just leave me alone don't have me
[1:37:22] don't hang around me please
[1:37:24] and so you know it's it's there's these
[1:37:26] people like that so here's jesus he
[1:37:29] changes the narrative to pilate but now
[1:37:31] i want you to look at there's a
[1:37:32] manifestation happening
[1:37:35] jesus is the word that is born and and
[1:37:38] he's coming to the fullness of the word
[1:37:41] and as the word comes to the fullness
[1:37:43] and that's we maybe didn't articulate it
[1:37:45] quite right yesterday but the seed there
[1:37:47] you know there's a there's a promise of
[1:37:50] a seed that was born of a woman
[1:37:53] and and in the garden of eden when when
[1:37:55] god when satan heard god addressed that
[1:37:58] there'll be a seed born of a woman i'll
[1:38:00] tell you what his attention was on two
[1:38:02] things that was a woman and that was the
[1:38:04] seed that would come through that woman
[1:38:06] because he knew that was what was raised
[1:38:09] up it was prophesied that that would
[1:38:11] bruise his head
[1:38:13] so every time you look in the bible you
[1:38:15] can look at god meeting abraham and
[1:38:17] sarah there was a womb there there was a
[1:38:20] promise there but the day that they had
[1:38:22] the visitation sarah was cranky brother
[1:38:25] branham would say it that we just
[1:38:26] outright he'd said it and he says why
[1:38:28] because satan was trying to upset the
[1:38:30] apple card every time you look at god
[1:38:32] doing something so here it was that way
[1:38:35] at the birth of mary at the birth of
[1:38:36] jesus when mary was there but now the
[1:38:39] word is coming to fullness and
[1:38:40] manifestation and as it's coming to
[1:38:43] fullness and manifestation
[1:38:44] everything starts to gather around it
[1:38:47] because we're spirit beings we are the
[1:38:49] spirit of god by the seed word of god
[1:38:52] and as we're the seed every other in a
[1:38:55] spirit realm you can't detect it but it
[1:38:56] starts to come against you
[1:39:00] i i know people that have
[1:39:02] come and stood for this message
[1:39:06] and and you want to believe that don't
[1:39:08] believe it but why do you have to stop
[1:39:09] drinking
[1:39:11] why do you have to stop smoking why do
[1:39:12] you have to stop doing this why do you
[1:39:14] have
[1:39:14] and what the people don't like is the
[1:39:16] life
[1:39:18] if they're of a contrary life now some
[1:39:20] will respect it god bless them for it
[1:39:22] group of friends that i had one day
[1:39:25] five guys i used to hang around with
[1:39:27] and uh
[1:39:29] i i left and i
[1:39:30] just had to go my way and and
[1:39:32] it was a year later one of my friends he
[1:39:34] invited me to be a best man at his
[1:39:36] wedding and
[1:39:37] and i at first thought you know we were
[1:39:38] best friends and everything we'd agreed
[1:39:40] on this years ago
[1:39:42] and when it came to it i just i realized
[1:39:44] i'm not where i used to be i'm a
[1:39:46] christian if i go to this wedding i'll
[1:39:48] have to participate in toast i'll have
[1:39:50] to participate in dancing and i told him
[1:39:53] rod i'm gonna come to the wedding
[1:39:55] but why don't you have somebody else be
[1:39:57] the best man i'll just just be there and
[1:39:59] so
[1:40:00] i went there i ended up sitting at the
[1:40:01] table with a lot of my former friends
[1:40:03] and were sitting there you know they'd
[1:40:05] all looked at me and said something's
[1:40:06] wrong with ed like he's gone off he's
[1:40:08] he's way this so as the evening went on
[1:40:11] a little bit the program was going on
[1:40:12] they were drinking and and all sudden
[1:40:14] one of the guys across the table he says
[1:40:16] so
[1:40:17] who says you got to go to church every
[1:40:18] sunday anyway
[1:40:20] and everybody's looking at me i go so
[1:40:22] you're talking to me you're talking to
[1:40:23] me yeah i'm talking to you
[1:40:25] and it was like at that moment god just
[1:40:27] gave me a thing and this other this
[1:40:29] fella his name was ron and i said ron
[1:40:32] you just got married i said
[1:40:35] do you go home every night because you
[1:40:36] have to no i want to
[1:40:38] that's the same way i feel about church
[1:40:40] i don't have to i want to
[1:40:42] everybody nodded said that's pretty good
[1:40:44] they went back to drinking i went back
[1:40:45] to being safe and i was okay
[1:40:48] so
[1:40:50] so you know we thank god for that
[1:40:52] but when the word comes on the scene
[1:40:54] when the life comes on the scene when
[1:40:57] that seed comes forth that's when the
[1:40:59] devil rises up now listen to this
[1:41:01] narrative this is in luke chapter
[1:41:03] 23 this is actually a similar passage to
[1:41:06] what we read in john 18 yesterday but it
[1:41:08] says you know and this is when pilate or
[1:41:10] when jesus comes before pilate pilate
[1:41:12] sends them to herod because it was
[1:41:14] inherits jurisdiction and then herod
[1:41:16] sends them back to pilate and this in
[1:41:17] verse 11 and herod
[1:41:20] with his men at war
[1:41:22] of war set at naught and mocked him and
[1:41:25] arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent
[1:41:27] him to pilate now here listen to this
[1:41:29] next scripture and the same day pilate
[1:41:32] and herod
[1:41:34] were made friends together
[1:41:36] before that they were at enmity among
[1:41:39] themselves
[1:41:40] when the word rises
[1:41:43] listen there's only two spirits in the
[1:41:44] world
[1:41:45] when the word rises all the other
[1:41:47] spirits gather in unity against it
[1:41:50] that's what's going to happen to israel
[1:41:52] that's what's going to happen to the
[1:41:53] bride
[1:41:55] now
[1:41:56] i'm i'm going to take my jacket off
[1:41:58] today and i'm wearing long sleeves in
[1:41:59] case anybody's worried about that
[1:42:04] now
[1:42:05] i'm just going to bring it right down to
[1:42:06] home and i'm not going to mince words
[1:42:09] when you look at
[1:42:10] the what they call the believe the sign
[1:42:13] people
[1:42:15] and
[1:42:16] when they made their stand and they ate
[1:42:18] what they called their humble pie and
[1:42:20] made their apology
[1:42:22] there was another man over in
[1:42:23] jeffersonville who also
[1:42:25] you know had a similar disputation
[1:42:28] these two had nothing in common
[1:42:32] nothing in common
[1:42:33] but when when one of them stood up the
[1:42:36] other one in jeffersonville i i happened
[1:42:38] to follow and i caught the dialogue and
[1:42:40] he said let's pray for our brothers as
[1:42:44] they take their stand
[1:42:46] now same spirits
[1:42:48] we're living in the same world that
[1:42:50] jesus lived in we've got a seed we've
[1:42:53] got a life of god it's not our own life
[1:42:55] it's not our own seed but it's the same
[1:42:57] manifestations around us
[1:42:59] so i i just dropped that in quickly so
[1:43:02] when the word comes on the scene
[1:43:04] then then
[1:43:05] all these other things happen let's go
[1:43:07] over to galatians chapter 4 verse 19.
[1:43:12] galatians 4 verse 19.
[1:43:14] now the galatians were an interesting
[1:43:16] people because you know they they they
[1:43:18] had their dues and their don'ts and they
[1:43:20] loved their dues and their don'ts and
[1:43:22] and and paul was trying to swing them
[1:43:23] over to grace and he was trying to get
[1:43:25] this thing and and he began to be
[1:43:27] worried about them because you know he
[1:43:29] started telling him you observe times
[1:43:31] and seasons you do all these things i
[1:43:32] fear for you
[1:43:34] but it comes down to this in verse 19
[1:43:36] and this is paul's burden for them and
[1:43:38] he says my little children of whom i
[1:43:40] travail in birth again
[1:43:42] until christ be formed in you so paul's
[1:43:46] burden was not just to get them that the
[1:43:49] tapes not just to get them the letters
[1:43:51] if i can call it that the epistles but
[1:43:53] it was to see a manifestation of life
[1:43:56] paul was a real husbandman and i'm just
[1:43:59] going to use that phrase i'm going to
[1:44:00] come to it a little bit in the message
[1:44:02] here but a husbandman is different than
[1:44:05] a hireling a higher length the bible
[1:44:07] says in one place a higher length days
[1:44:10] are or one year it says another place
[1:44:11] they're three years you look at this
[1:44:13] there can be a lot of hireling preachers
[1:44:15] it can be somebody just says hey i'm i'm
[1:44:17] here i'm available how much are you
[1:44:18] gonna pay me what's my salary i got it
[1:44:20] but somebody who's actually born for the
[1:44:22] job somebody who has a burden for the
[1:44:24] people that's whose god god looks at as
[1:44:27] a husbandman and i'm saying that doesn't
[1:44:29] apply to us to ministers that applies to
[1:44:32] fathers that applies to deacons we have
[1:44:35] more of an interest in it as as in of
[1:44:38] being our own work this is god's work
[1:44:40] and it's greater than what we can do and
[1:44:43] we've been entrusted with it therefore
[1:44:45] we take great care in how we handle
[1:44:48] things
[1:44:50] are you with me
[1:44:51] i'm moving towards things here so
[1:44:53] paul's burden was till christ be warm so
[1:44:56] again
[1:44:57] satan is after that seed i'm going to
[1:44:59] tie this through with something that
[1:45:01] brother brahma says in a message we have
[1:45:03] seen a star and come to worship him he
[1:45:05] says when christ jesus was being formed
[1:45:08] in mary
[1:45:09] that's when the persecution set in
[1:45:11] that's when it started that's the same
[1:45:14] thing in you when christ the hope of
[1:45:16] glory is formed in you
[1:45:18] that's when you are dying and when
[1:45:21] christ is coming to life
[1:45:23] watch the persecution set in watch
[1:45:26] trouble start on every road watch the
[1:45:29] devil go on a rampage when christ is
[1:45:32] formed in you so as we come closer to
[1:45:35] that don't worry about these things
[1:45:38] they're going to be there but we got our
[1:45:40] mind fixed on one thing it's that i may
[1:45:43] be as christ is that i may be that part
[1:45:46] that he wants me to be nothing more
[1:45:48] nothing less
[1:45:50] and he says and as christ was being
[1:45:52] formed in mary quickly come the king's
[1:45:54] commandment all you people and here
[1:45:57] christ was becoming a full baby ready to
[1:45:59] be livered right till the time of the
[1:46:01] persecution
[1:46:02] brother bran will go on and say
[1:46:04] this baby's been formed a long time
[1:46:08] it's it's coming in the last days when
[1:46:10] the completeness the fullness of the
[1:46:13] godhead the fullness of christ is to be
[1:46:16] manifest in the people
[1:46:18] he said so
[1:46:20] he promised it in his word and that's
[1:46:23] when unusual things happen that's the
[1:46:26] reason our great social lives and things
[1:46:29] can't understand it it's foolishness to
[1:46:31] them now watch they're forming a council
[1:46:34] of churches and when the church is
[1:46:36] beginning to get on its feet when the
[1:46:39] great supernatural begins to work
[1:46:41] they'll all go into a group and they're
[1:46:43] going to try and stop this stuff just
[1:46:46] exactly like it was then
[1:46:48] that's why we make much of these
[1:46:50] meetings much of our times together but
[1:46:52] i'll tell you there's a there's a
[1:46:54] quotation in brother and he relates it
[1:46:56] to
[1:46:56] um
[1:46:57] uh it's it's in 1950 and i think it's in
[1:47:00] the angel of the lord message and he
[1:47:02] refers to it and he says
[1:47:03] and he says those who follow the pillar
[1:47:06] of fire
[1:47:07] he says
[1:47:08] they'll have a rough time then
[1:47:11] he's talking about when when this
[1:47:13] persecution comes and all these things
[1:47:15] but he says but they'll be ready for the
[1:47:17] translation at that time
[1:47:20] i'm looking for his life to rise not not
[1:47:23] what i can produce not what i can
[1:47:25] manufacture but it's him among us
[1:47:29] that's what we're looking for let me let
[1:47:31] me bring this right into this
[1:47:33] this thing because it's it's
[1:47:35] it's our expectation sometimes that we
[1:47:38] look and sometimes we
[1:47:40] you know we try to
[1:47:41] manifest
[1:47:43] you know i got to be a christian i got
[1:47:45] to show myself approved and you know
[1:47:47] maybe i gotta sing louder maybe i gotta
[1:47:49] do this maybe i gotta make sure that i'm
[1:47:52] and
[1:47:52] it's not about what we do
[1:47:54] when you get to heaven
[1:47:56] you know there's not gonna be somebody
[1:47:58] saying okay
[1:47:59] how do you see serpentine
[1:48:01] okay check uh did you baptize okay check
[1:48:04] did you do this and sometimes that's the
[1:48:06] way we approach god in our life here
[1:48:08] that's not what we we want we till
[1:48:10] christ be formed in us
[1:48:12] where you're so in tune you know it's
[1:48:15] not yourself
[1:48:16] you know i i love a good cup of coffee
[1:48:18] and sometimes you know i'm in a hurry
[1:48:20] and alberta tends to go a little faster
[1:48:21] pace than newfoundland and sometimes you
[1:48:23] go and and and you just you come into a
[1:48:26] line and it's just to a tim hortons or
[1:48:27] whatever it is and you come in and
[1:48:29] there's a car that comes right in front
[1:48:30] oh man
[1:48:33] and you know you get upset i thought i
[1:48:35] have to wait a little longer
[1:48:37] i i just learned a little bit over time
[1:48:39] i think you know what so what that gives
[1:48:41] me a little chance to listen to a
[1:48:43] message or do something a little more
[1:48:45] and i don't worry about it and you know
[1:48:47] as important as coffee is sometimes and
[1:48:49] it's important sometimes but i'll tell
[1:48:51] you what they're you learn a little bit
[1:48:53] and you just learn okay it's not my
[1:48:55] nature you go listen to
[1:48:58] to the statue of a perfect man and
[1:48:59] brother madam will talk it says every
[1:49:01] believer has
[1:49:03] some elements or characteristics of
[1:49:05] faith virtue faith virtue patience slow
[1:49:08] down it
[1:49:09] and and and all of these things in
[1:49:12] themselves
[1:49:13] but he says but there's parts of it
[1:49:16] that we need god to come in and fill us
[1:49:19] you go listen to blasphemous names and i
[1:49:22] think it's in that or maybe it's statue
[1:49:24] it's the one just before but it's it's
[1:49:26] about the rock box in heaven and how it
[1:49:29] couldn't contain it and it's a wonderful
[1:49:31] study and it just came to me but but go
[1:49:33] look at it it's about god pouring a
[1:49:35] virtue in and it took honey to make it
[1:49:38] stick
[1:49:39] and and honey was representing the
[1:49:40] brotherly love and all of these things
[1:49:42] it's
[1:49:43] i i shouldn't i gotta slow down here
[1:49:45] okay
[1:49:46] now
[1:49:48] let me let me read the the further part
[1:49:50] of this here um this message has been a
[1:49:53] blessing to me it's how can i overcome
[1:49:56] and brother and brother let me read
[1:49:57] first from rising of the sun
[1:50:00] satan doesn't care
[1:50:02] how religious you are
[1:50:04] or how right you are in your doctrine
[1:50:08] and i i would say shamefully to us
[1:50:10] sometimes we have majored more on
[1:50:13] correctness of doctrine on mechanics
[1:50:16] than we have on manifestation
[1:50:19] but i believe god is changing that
[1:50:21] because i i i've learned something there
[1:50:24] are people we all come from walks of
[1:50:26] life and i don't look at where they're
[1:50:28] standing right now but i look at their
[1:50:30] trajectory which way are they pointing
[1:50:33] what are they trying to overcome and
[1:50:35] i'll work with anybody as long as that
[1:50:37] trajectory is there and even when it's
[1:50:39] not i'll work to get them turned around
[1:50:41] but we need to not analyze people you
[1:50:44] know sometimes we'll look and say okay
[1:50:46] that skirt is so long or that isn't long
[1:50:48] enough or they didn't do this and and we
[1:50:50] measure so much on that but what is
[1:50:52] their trajectory what's behind them
[1:50:55] what's behind that struggle and and we
[1:50:58] need to work with that so satan doesn't
[1:51:00] care how religious you are how right you
[1:51:02] are in your doctrine if you miss the
[1:51:04] life you won't come up anyhow no matter
[1:51:06] how religious how many churches you went
[1:51:09] how good you are it doesn't matter one
[1:51:11] thing unless you're born again
[1:51:14] and i say this you got to know it for
[1:51:16] yourself don't depend on somebody else
[1:51:18] you got to know it yourself
[1:51:21] how can i overcome brother branham would
[1:51:22] say in the past ages a christian could
[1:51:25] be for his profession beheaded for
[1:51:27] belonging to christ he could be killed
[1:51:30] put out of his ministry
[1:51:32] misery
[1:51:33] but now the enemy
[1:51:35] okay
[1:51:36] i gotta force myself to slow down
[1:51:39] i was i was visiting somebody one day
[1:51:42] and uh i was just trying to say thank
[1:51:44] you for the hospitality
[1:51:46] and it says and i came out and said
[1:51:48] thank you for the hostility
[1:51:52] so you gotta you gotta slow down
[1:51:55] sometimes you gotta watch your words a
[1:51:57] little bit
[1:51:59] anyway
[1:52:01] um he says now the enemy has come in
[1:52:04] it's a great age of deception
[1:52:07] christ said the two spirits would be so
[1:52:10] close in the last days
[1:52:12] he would deceive the very elected if
[1:52:15] possible now we're talking about two
[1:52:17] spirits
[1:52:18] he says people can live so close
[1:52:23] a clean holy life
[1:52:26] not be sinful
[1:52:28] adulterers
[1:52:30] drinkers and liars or gamblers
[1:52:33] they can live above that and still not
[1:52:36] with it
[1:52:37] that's right now
[1:52:39] a good message for that is and knoweth
[1:52:41] it not where brother branham will go
[1:52:43] through and he deals with those three
[1:52:45] realms and he says
[1:52:46] many times
[1:52:48] we serve god from a good conscience
[1:52:50] or or you know you can even have a good
[1:52:53] message conscience
[1:52:55] i you know i shouldn't do this i
[1:52:57] shouldn't do that but it goes deeper
[1:52:59] than that
[1:53:00] it goes where it begins to change your
[1:53:02] desires it's not so much out of fear
[1:53:05] it's out of what i can't do but it's
[1:53:07] about i've got liberty to do whatever
[1:53:10] because i'm in christ
[1:53:12] and in christ whatever he wants to do
[1:53:14] with me
[1:53:16] so he said this is the age of the
[1:53:19] personal life of christ
[1:53:21] the chemical of his body that was in him
[1:53:25] if we're trying to follow the message of
[1:53:27] the hour we should live constantly in
[1:53:30] the life of christ because if you don't
[1:53:33] do it and you lay around it says he that
[1:53:35] knoweth to do good and doeth it not it's
[1:53:37] a sin
[1:53:38] you become dodi rotten
[1:53:40] you're you have to stay in the life of
[1:53:43] christ
[1:53:44] then your fruit bearing so it's about
[1:53:47] staying in your channel it's not being
[1:53:50] more religious it's not about proving
[1:53:52] anything to god or proving anything to
[1:53:54] your parents or proving anything to the
[1:53:56] deacons or the the ministers look at
[1:53:58] what i'm doing no it's just about being
[1:54:00] you and being honest
[1:54:02] i i i'm just gonna be a little bit more
[1:54:04] transparent it's not about me coming
[1:54:07] here and talking down to anybody i'm a
[1:54:09] brother like all of you it's about me
[1:54:12] yielding to him and allowing him
[1:54:15] for our brothers who are leaders in our
[1:54:17] home it's not about us
[1:54:19] taking a top down approach and saying
[1:54:21] okay
[1:54:22] first of all say
[1:54:24] the message says i'm the head of the
[1:54:26] home and you pull out the quotes
[1:54:28] furthermore it says that you're all
[1:54:31] subject to me pull out the quotes and
[1:54:32] then you add in and i'm german so that
[1:54:35] entitles me to be more militant than
[1:54:36] everybody else no it's not about that so
[1:54:40] it's it's more about
[1:54:42] i'm the leader i've got a responsibility
[1:54:45] i've got to humble myself it's i read a
[1:54:49] book and and maybe some of my thoughts
[1:54:51] evolve out of this it's greater than
[1:54:52] that but um it was about a man in iraq
[1:54:55] his name was stanley mcchrystal he was
[1:54:57] the general in charge of leading the
[1:55:01] forces
[1:55:02] of of the united states and all of its
[1:55:05] you know people against the fighting of
[1:55:08] the al-qaeda forces
[1:55:10] and he said it was a war like no other
[1:55:12] war that we'd ever fought
[1:55:14] he said the enemy was in in every it
[1:55:18] wasn't in one geographic location it was
[1:55:20] in multiple locations
[1:55:22] and the enemy was empowered with an
[1:55:24] ideology many of them believing in the
[1:55:27] muslim or the uh the faith there that
[1:55:30] the minute they die for the cause
[1:55:32] they're going to cross over into the
[1:55:33] other side and there's 10 virgins
[1:55:36] waiting for them so many of them are
[1:55:38] empowered by this ideology they're
[1:55:40] willing to give their lives
[1:55:42] as wrong as it was
[1:55:44] they had a greater force than the united
[1:55:46] states coming against them and so this
[1:55:49] this general realized very quickly that
[1:55:51] their approach was
[1:55:53] up here i'm the general i've got my team
[1:55:55] of generals we spread out over all these
[1:55:57] locations then we got our captains and
[1:55:59] we got our lieutenants then we've got
[1:56:00] our sergeants and then we've got our
[1:56:02] foot soldiers so the orders come
[1:56:06] down they go by the time they got the
[1:56:08] orders down to the foot soldiers the
[1:56:10] enemy had moved the enemy had done
[1:56:12] something different it wasn't working
[1:56:13] the foot soldier said this doesn't work
[1:56:16] this is good for nothing and sometimes
[1:56:18] we're that way we we ca if we're not
[1:56:21] easy we can have this disconnect you
[1:56:23] know on one hand we've got the seals and
[1:56:26] the opening of the word and you know we
[1:56:28] we pull this ideology in church and then
[1:56:31] we get out of church and it's like
[1:56:32] monday okay i'll just do whatever i can
[1:56:34] do i can you know i'm this and you just
[1:56:36] just get the revelation
[1:56:38] no that's not how we do it so so this
[1:56:41] general he
[1:56:42] he actually said
[1:56:43] i realized i had to change our entire
[1:56:45] structure
[1:56:47] he said
[1:56:48] it couldn't be this top down i said i
[1:56:50] began to empower
[1:56:52] our soldiers at every level he told the
[1:56:55] captains now you have leeway you're
[1:56:57] entitled you're in a position you've got
[1:56:59] this much to do
[1:57:01] you do it you've got that authority just
[1:57:03] report back when you can and we need to
[1:57:06] be more flexible
[1:57:08] and i'm saying the world around us has
[1:57:10] changed it's not so much about going to
[1:57:12] movie theaters it's not so much about
[1:57:15] televisions it's about little devices
[1:57:18] it's about you know we got to be very
[1:57:20] careful i i i met a man it was a client
[1:57:24] of ours and i went to his home and he
[1:57:25] was a
[1:57:26] nominal christian he wasn't a message
[1:57:28] christian i admired what he did in his
[1:57:30] family when they came home there was a
[1:57:32] place at their back entrance they had
[1:57:34] actually eight kids that was admirable
[1:57:36] in this day and then i went in the back
[1:57:38] entrance all the phones were dropped in
[1:57:40] the back entrance they didn't come in
[1:57:42] the house when we're at the supper table
[1:57:44] he said we don't bring the phones to the
[1:57:45] supper table we interact
[1:57:48] i thought that's a good thing for us to
[1:57:50] learn
[1:57:51] we ought to recognize the influences the
[1:57:54] world that that was in a movie theater
[1:57:56] and in a television years ago is right
[1:57:58] at at the footsteps of our children and
[1:58:01] if we're not careful we need to be on
[1:58:03] top of it we need to be flexible and
[1:58:06] part of it is an example ourselves part
[1:58:08] of it is being transparent i don't know
[1:58:11] everything i need god as much as we all
[1:58:13] need god and we need to humble ourselves
[1:58:16] and be open to that men to wives and
[1:58:20] mothers to children and fathers to
[1:58:22] children
[1:58:23] this is part of of being a gardener is
[1:58:26] creating an atmosphere yeah now
[1:58:29] this this this man he wrote this book
[1:58:31] it's called a team of teams and in the
[1:58:33] book he when he recognized it he got a
[1:58:35] lot of resistance
[1:58:37] these these are generals says i've
[1:58:38] worked my way up the ranks to be put
[1:58:40] down and let you give orders direct to
[1:58:43] people below me
[1:58:44] he was a lot of resistance
[1:58:46] sometimes our mindset our expectation is
[1:58:49] at a different place
[1:58:50] and he says i realized my role wasn't a
[1:58:53] top-down approach anymore
[1:58:56] i realized my role had to be that of a
[1:58:59] gardener he actually used these words
[1:59:00] and in his book he had a little section
[1:59:02] entitled the gardener
[1:59:04] and he says and he gave these different
[1:59:06] rules and he said it was not so much
[1:59:09] about giving orders as it was creating
[1:59:12] an atmosphere
[1:59:14] for things to flourish and for people to
[1:59:17] be successful
[1:59:18] so the the atmosphere we create in our
[1:59:21] homes as fathers as husbands i'm
[1:59:24] pointing to us first as ministers
[1:59:27] we need to start to create an atmosphere
[1:59:30] for god to work among his people not for
[1:59:33] us to bark out orders and you know
[1:59:35] follow me and and that works i believe
[1:59:38] in that i believe in leadership of the
[1:59:39] holy ghost but i believe that we're
[1:59:42] seeing a time where it's not just
[1:59:45] you know the transition between moses
[1:59:47] and joshua is amazing to me because
[1:59:50] moses we've all seen the ten
[1:59:51] commandments and everybody looks and
[1:59:53] hears moses flowing hair and standing at
[1:59:56] the red sea and lifting his hands and
[1:59:59] and the red sea parting and you know and
[2:00:02] later on israel had so been accustomed
[2:00:04] to watching that
[2:00:06] and then they watched that and yet after
[2:00:09] they were fighting a battle and moses
[2:00:11] couldn't lift up his hands and israel
[2:00:12] started to lose the battle so her and
[2:00:15] and and aaron went up and they held his
[2:00:17] hands and when he held his hands so
[2:00:19] their faith was in the vessel god used
[2:00:22] but when they crossed over jordan it was
[2:00:25] now it was a different focus and joshua
[2:00:29] said you've not gone this way before and
[2:00:32] they began to cross the jordan so now
[2:00:34] crossing the red sea well it was moses
[2:00:36] lifting us now it was a different focus
[2:00:39] what was it an ark went before and there
[2:00:42] was the levites carrying the word it
[2:00:45] wasn't the levites pointing to
[2:00:47] themselves it was the levites drawing
[2:00:49] attention to the word and that's what
[2:00:52] our obligation is the word goes before
[2:00:54] us and in fact he told him he says now
[2:00:57] he says when the ark is here you stand
[2:01:00] so many so much distance back so that
[2:01:02] everybody can see the word and when you
[2:01:05] see the word that's where you'll draw
[2:01:07] your strength from now that's where
[2:01:09] you're gonna get your inspiration from
[2:01:11] the word is gonna go before you
[2:01:14] now the same god of moses now drops down
[2:01:16] into a level where nobody can see it the
[2:01:18] same way
[2:01:19] and as he drops down to that level as
[2:01:22] soon as the priest put their the levites
[2:01:25] put their foot in the water the water
[2:01:27] started to recede
[2:01:29] was it the priests that did that
[2:01:31] or was it the word that they were
[2:01:33] carrying that did that
[2:01:37] you know it's it's sometimes we
[2:01:40] if we're not careful we have an
[2:01:41] inferiority complex or we think more of
[2:01:44] ourselves than we ought
[2:01:46] oh you know and and if we if we ever
[2:01:49] lose sight
[2:01:50] that it's god in us
[2:01:53] we're lost
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:55] you know we got to remember the ministry
[2:01:57] we're under is the son of man ministry
[2:02:00] and if we ever separate from that we're
[2:02:02] lost you know you can take the little
[2:02:05] story of the donkey that was carrying
[2:02:07] jesus he'd never been ridden on before
[2:02:10] and jesus sat on him
[2:02:12] and he became tame and humble that's not
[2:02:14] characteristic of a donkey
[2:02:16] but there was a presence there was
[2:02:17] something that went with him and as
[2:02:19] jesus rode that donkey and that donkey's
[2:02:22] now jesus is riding on him and the
[2:02:24] donkey is is looking and and there's
[2:02:26] leaves coming and hosannas and the
[2:02:29] donkeys think wow this is i'm really
[2:02:30] something you know wow
[2:02:33] they're all they're all cheering me
[2:02:35] no they were cheering the word that he
[2:02:37] was carrying and if we're not careful we
[2:02:39] take that so here's the donkey and you
[2:02:41] know man i'm the donkey i'm the one you
[2:02:44] know and and you know jesus gets off and
[2:02:46] the donkey's led into a stable you
[2:02:49] separate the the what's carrying the
[2:02:51] gift from the son of man it's just
[2:02:53] another donkey and a stable
[2:02:55] you take your ministry you might think i
[2:02:57] got a great ministry and you think oh
[2:02:59] look at everybody can rally around me i
[2:03:00] can do this and this and the minute you
[2:03:02] separate from the son of man you're lost
[2:03:05] you're you're another preacher that's
[2:03:06] just there everybody can look at you
[2:03:08] you're aimless you're walking around we
[2:03:10] have got an authority we have got a a
[2:03:13] word from heaven we've got a life that
[2:03:15] we're caring and god is seeing to that
[2:03:18] he's going to bring every word to pass
[2:03:20] i i believe that with all my heart
[2:03:22] so he said
[2:03:23] what must we do we must be about the
[2:03:25] father's business
[2:03:28] he said
[2:03:29] this is in seed is not air the wheat
[2:03:32] would cry back the grain what must it do
[2:03:34] vindicate malachi 4. vindicate luke 17
[2:03:37] 30. hebrews 13 8 john 14 12
[2:03:40] revelations 10 the opening of the seals
[2:03:43] all of these mysteries and things that's
[2:03:45] the father's business for the hour now
[2:03:48] as i said you can easily make that a
[2:03:50] disconnect
[2:03:51] you think i can't explain it to anybody
[2:03:53] no you can't but i just believe it
[2:03:56] and then i i i i always tell our people
[2:03:59] i said if somebody asks you it's not
[2:04:01] your business to have to explain it
[2:04:03] just just tell them
[2:04:05] i think the greatest witness you can
[2:04:06] have as brother branham would say what
[2:04:08] jeffersonville needs is lived voices
[2:04:11] and he says
[2:04:12] more than trying to preach a sermon live
[2:04:15] a sermon
[2:04:17] and he says so all you need to do is
[2:04:18] just live that life and when somebody
[2:04:21] asks you say listen i can't explain it
[2:04:23] all to you but this is what i believe
[2:04:25] and and and and i i'll just point you to
[2:04:28] our pastor i pointed to the message i'll
[2:04:30] do whatever you know and if you can
[2:04:33] share it fine share it do whatever you
[2:04:34] can
[2:04:35] but we need to remember it's not in
[2:04:37] ourselves
[2:04:38] it's god who is in us
[2:04:40] we have this treasure in earthen vessels
[2:04:45] now
[2:04:46] i'm gonna just just keep going here and
[2:04:48] brother branham would say
[2:04:51] now remember
[2:04:53] he was the eleazar
[2:04:55] he was the forerunner
[2:04:58] and just like john was the forerunner
[2:05:00] i'll i'll go just a step further in my
[2:05:02] notes here for a minute
[2:05:04] but brother branham would would say
[2:05:06] and uh
[2:05:08] and and he as as the lease are he would
[2:05:10] say
[2:05:12] in present stage of my ministry
[2:05:15] now he's in 1962
[2:05:18] in
[2:05:19] in
[2:05:21] september
[2:05:24] i got i got to save some of this because
[2:05:25] i got to come to something
[2:05:27] but brother branham says this was his
[2:05:29] hope
[2:05:30] i hope he'll let me crown my ministry
[2:05:33] of letting me take the clothes of the
[2:05:35] word
[2:05:36] and dress his bride in the cloth of the
[2:05:39] word
[2:05:40] i hope he'll crown me and let me say
[2:05:43] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[2:05:45] the sin of the world now he preaches
[2:05:48] he's in another message and he's he's
[2:05:50] just talking about presenting something
[2:05:52] to god and this is in in the message
[2:05:55] hear ye him
[2:05:56] he says
[2:05:58] father he's praying make our lives so
[2:06:00] sweet and so full of the spirit so
[2:06:03] gentle and so kind and sweet that the
[2:06:07] whole world would long and see jesus
[2:06:12] oh let it be written with that
[2:06:14] if our character hasn't been just right
[2:06:17] forgive us lord
[2:06:20] and now he says now
[2:06:21] i present them to you
[2:06:24] they are the fruits of this message
[2:06:26] and now you are giving them we are you
[2:06:30] you are giving them to jesus as love
[2:06:32] gifts
[2:06:33] and they are love gifts from the father
[2:06:35] to the son no man can pluck them from
[2:06:37] your hand
[2:06:39] god may they live sweet humble lives
[2:06:43] may they be filled with the spirit and
[2:06:45] become your servants
[2:06:47] may i never see them or sh if i never
[2:06:49] see them or shake their hands may i do
[2:06:52] it in another land where we sit at the
[2:06:54] great wedding supper
[2:06:57] you you talk about a desire that a and a
[2:06:59] burden of of a prophet you know
[2:07:02] i'll i'll i'll just try and save this a
[2:07:04] little bit as we we go on here
[2:07:08] you know
[2:07:09] we're so
[2:07:10] we the devil can put us under pressure
[2:07:14] and say
[2:07:15] if you be a daughter of god if you be a
[2:07:18] son of god
[2:07:19] then do such and such and and we if
[2:07:21] we're not careful we start to listen to
[2:07:23] that
[2:07:24] and we and it starts to pull us into
[2:07:26] different places and
[2:07:28] different channels
[2:07:30] it was
[2:07:31] i think our
[2:07:32] my wife was expecting with our daughter
[2:07:34] so this would have been some time back
[2:07:37] we went to um
[2:07:38] prince edward island
[2:07:41] and it's the land of girls with red hair
[2:07:45] and so we thought it would be fitting
[2:07:46] that we should go there and
[2:07:49] i did see that somewhere on the travel
[2:07:51] list here you have a redhead cove
[2:07:53] somewhere so i was hoping we could see
[2:07:55] that for her sake but uh
[2:07:57] any rate
[2:08:00] we went there and some believers had
[2:08:03] referred us to some
[2:08:05] people they knew that had they'd
[2:08:07] witnessed to in the message and they
[2:08:08] were holiness people
[2:08:10] and so we didn't know believers on the
[2:08:12] island we were there for five days and
[2:08:14] and when we went there we
[2:08:16] we met them and they said well they're
[2:08:18] having a church service on sunday so
[2:08:21] we came up to the church service it was
[2:08:24] probably about half an hour before and
[2:08:25] there was not a car in the parking lot
[2:08:27] and so we drove around and we got a
[2:08:29] coffee went around and got a coffee and
[2:08:31] then we came back and it was like it was
[2:08:33] full at 15 too and i go wow okay we
[2:08:35] better step in and we walked in and the
[2:08:37] church was full and you know and and and
[2:08:40] uh
[2:08:41] and i i noticed like the the sisters all
[2:08:44] had long dresses and they had long hair
[2:08:47] and and
[2:08:48] and and you know they at about a certain
[2:08:50] time they started praying they all knelt
[2:08:52] down and started calling on god and
[2:08:55] i i truthfully i felt backslid
[2:08:58] and and i thought
[2:08:59] my these people got something you know
[2:09:01] and and i'm i'm there and i'm i'm
[2:09:04] looking at it and i did notice that all
[2:09:06] the sisters even though they had long
[2:09:07] hair they had these little hats on too
[2:09:10] and uh
[2:09:11] so we we went to the service and it was
[2:09:13] a good service it spoke to me i think
[2:09:15] god can speak to you in any service if
[2:09:17] you had a seed of god in you
[2:09:18] and we went out for lunch with them
[2:09:20] after and
[2:09:21] they welcomed us as visitors and
[2:09:23] and this was a visiting minister they
[2:09:25] had in and he was there and that evening
[2:09:27] he was really talking about getting the
[2:09:28] holy ghost and and i noticed something
[2:09:31] now because
[2:09:32] as we came in in the evening service and
[2:09:35] we sat down and everybody was kind of
[2:09:37] talking to each other
[2:09:39] and and such in fact i i had started
[2:09:41] praying like they were in the morning i
[2:09:43] was there a little earlier and somebody
[2:09:44] tapped me on the soldier i was bringing
[2:09:45] are you new here i said yeah i'm new
[2:09:47] here yeah i'm just talking to the lord
[2:09:49] and and and i realized and it was like a
[2:09:51] 10-2 and like a switch went off they
[2:09:53] went from talking amongst each other and
[2:09:55] they dropped on their knees and started
[2:09:57] praying
[2:09:58] and i thought this is just a form
[2:10:01] it's not genuine it's not
[2:10:03] and then i realized in the evening this
[2:10:05] was a upc movement and then at the
[2:10:06] evening the end of the service there was
[2:10:09] a young man and they were trying to make
[2:10:10] sure he got the holy ghost and there was
[2:10:12] a group of men around him trying to make
[2:10:14] him speak in tongues for all that it's
[2:10:15] worth and i i and there was like it was
[2:10:18] pressure pressure pressure
[2:10:20] listen friends that's not of god
[2:10:22] that's not as as much as they're trying
[2:10:24] and they see it it that's not how god
[2:10:27] manifests himself
[2:10:29] and we can do the same thing in the
[2:10:31] message of the hour
[2:10:33] i was very grateful i had just listened
[2:10:34] to the message questions and answers on
[2:10:36] the holy ghost as i'd come on the plane
[2:10:38] that way and it just struck me how
[2:10:41] pertinent this is and and and they just
[2:10:43] said well how do you know if you don't
[2:10:44] have the holy ghost and i said well
[2:10:47] brother i didn't say brother branham i
[2:10:48] said but the bible says
[2:10:50] it says that john had the holy ghost
[2:10:52] from his mother's womb
[2:10:53] and and they go well that was just one
[2:10:55] of a kind
[2:10:57] and and i i'm so grateful for this truth
[2:11:00] it's friends it's a liberty it's a
[2:11:02] freedom it's not bondage
[2:11:04] it is not a bondage amen so so we
[2:11:07] believe that and and we want to build
[2:11:09] everybody up and we want to do this now
[2:11:12] i want to just quickly go back i was
[2:11:14] reading these quotes back to matthew 11.
[2:11:16] this is where john had been
[2:11:18] talking about uh
[2:11:20] whether he saw jesus or not and at the
[2:11:23] end of this chapter jesus the lord
[2:11:25] speaks
[2:11:26] and he says this in matthew chapter 11
[2:11:28] verse 28
[2:11:30] he says come unto me
[2:11:33] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[2:11:37] and i will give you rest
[2:11:39] take my yoke upon you
[2:11:42] learn of me now
[2:11:44] he doesn't say
[2:11:46] now listen to the doctrine make sure you
[2:11:48] get my tapes no he says
[2:11:50] take my yoke learn of me
[2:11:53] i am meek and lowly in heart
[2:11:57] now this is an approach
[2:11:59] that we need to
[2:12:01] it's a hard thing to come down to
[2:12:04] and he says i am meek and lowly in heart
[2:12:06] and you shall find rest for your souls
[2:12:09] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[2:12:13] light
[2:12:14] and he says at that time
[2:12:16] jesus went i won't read i won't read
[2:12:18] chapter 12 but if i just take that i i
[2:12:20] remember reading this years ago and i
[2:12:22] remember i came back to the lord and i
[2:12:24] came in the message um you know when i
[2:12:26] was after a few years in the world and
[2:12:28] god really did at work and i'm so
[2:12:29] thankful for it and and and i came in
[2:12:32] and now all of a sudden i find out
[2:12:33] there's this is the truth this is the
[2:12:35] message now there's a church here and
[2:12:37] there's a church here and there's a
[2:12:38] church there and
[2:12:39] i i honestly
[2:12:42] couldn't tell you the difference in
[2:12:43] doctrine at that time
[2:12:45] i i wasn't at that place but what i did
[2:12:48] learn
[2:12:49] is that there's a spirit that follows
[2:12:52] things
[2:12:53] and i and there was a group of and i
[2:12:54] watched the young people and i just just
[2:12:56] watching and i still watch i always
[2:12:58] watch
[2:12:59] and and as i watch and i noticed there
[2:13:01] was fellowship between different
[2:13:03] churches and young people but this one
[2:13:04] church
[2:13:05] there was zero fellowship it was like a
[2:13:07] hard wall it was cut off i'm not going
[2:13:09] to mention names but
[2:13:11] it made me recognize there's a different
[2:13:13] spirit following that
[2:13:15] and it and then i also realized
[2:13:17] it sometimes you can present the truth
[2:13:19] but you can present it harshly or
[2:13:21] wrongly or you can present it in a way
[2:13:24] that isn't conducive to life
[2:13:26] i i just gave the example you can be the
[2:13:28] father and the head of a home in german
[2:13:30] and all these things and in irish or
[2:13:32] whatever you want to be but
[2:13:34] you know you can do that and you can
[2:13:36] make your home a military camp
[2:13:38] i'll tell you what that may hold the
[2:13:41] children for a while begrudgingly but
[2:13:43] when they get old enough to say i don't
[2:13:45] want that jesus
[2:13:47] we need to present christ with what we
[2:13:49] do we need to we need to be the gardener
[2:13:52] in our home we need to create the
[2:13:54] atmosphere we need to be able to do
[2:13:56] these things and present it brother
[2:13:59] bannon would would say this in the
[2:14:01] message desperations right after he
[2:14:03] preached the token
[2:14:04] he said
[2:14:06] friends we're living in the last days
[2:14:07] when the seven seals have been opened
[2:14:10] and make the whole thing known in one
[2:14:12] great big body of the bride
[2:14:15] uh until this church is perfected by the
[2:14:18] bride group in this last days
[2:14:20] and then we'll all together be taken up
[2:14:22] and then he just stops if you listen on
[2:14:24] a tape he says it's like
[2:14:27] the token
[2:14:29] jesus christ the holy spirit
[2:14:32] is among us
[2:14:34] we should reverence that
[2:14:37] we can't humble ourselves enough
[2:14:41] taking off your shoes it wouldn't expel
[2:14:43] it
[2:14:44] it says
[2:14:45] it wouldn't satisfy it but a life that
[2:14:48] brings forth
[2:14:50] the fruit of the spirit
[2:14:52] okay now
[2:14:53] i i i bring all of this and i set this
[2:14:55] groundwork i'm going to just go into a
[2:14:56] little bit of a channel here on on
[2:14:58] something
[2:14:59] and i'm going to just start to bring in
[2:15:01] something on the seals and i'm going to
[2:15:03] bring this in this way
[2:15:06] now
[2:15:07] brother branham preaches ten messages
[2:15:10] in what we call the seals seven seals he
[2:15:13] starts with a message called god in
[2:15:16] simplicity
[2:15:17] and and it's and i i don't know if
[2:15:19] you're like me but i when i opened the
[2:15:21] seals book and said okay i've heard that
[2:15:22] i i just i would i would okay let me get
[2:15:25] to the meat of the matter what seal one
[2:15:27] what's seal two you know
[2:15:28] and and we we bypass that but if we do
[2:15:31] that we actually miss the approach to
[2:15:32] god
[2:15:33] and and he
[2:15:35] he actually if you listen to brother he
[2:15:37] he speaks it and he comes all the way to
[2:15:39] the end of the seventh seal and he says
[2:15:42] now
[2:15:43] now i see what god was doing
[2:15:46] he says
[2:15:47] and and he's he's connecting something
[2:15:49] that started
[2:15:51] god in simplicity was ordained to go
[2:15:53] into the seals i had a brother he didn't
[2:15:55] understand it he'd read the church age
[2:15:57] book he he really probably never caught
[2:16:00] the revelation the message and he says i
[2:16:01] read the church age book i catch it and
[2:16:04] intellectually you can pick it all up i
[2:16:06] read the seals and he says i read all
[2:16:08] the seals and brother madam explains he
[2:16:10] didn't explain the seventh what is the
[2:16:12] seven seal mystery you know that would
[2:16:13] be a platform for me to step up and say
[2:16:15] well let me tell you
[2:16:17] no i didn't say that
[2:16:18] i said only god can reveal that and make
[2:16:21] that real to you
[2:16:22] and i said and i said go back and that's
[2:16:24] why i always encourage people listen to
[2:16:26] the voice listen to the tapes take time
[2:16:29] and immerse yourself don't just pick a
[2:16:31] quote here and there just go into
[2:16:33] there's so many nuggets in there
[2:16:36] brother branham will the bride have a
[2:16:37] ministry before the rapture he says and
[2:16:39] he's almost with the bride of a ministry
[2:16:42] oh and he's almost like surprised at the
[2:16:43] question oh of course it consists of
[2:16:46] prophets and and and pastors and
[2:16:48] apostles and and evangelists and
[2:16:50] teachers he says
[2:16:52] it's going on right now and he says
[2:16:54] it'll be so humble
[2:16:56] oh friends what is a true minister does
[2:16:59] he point to your himself or does he
[2:17:01] point to christ we need to be like john
[2:17:04] was he says i must decrease he must
[2:17:08] increase i i i don't want to just see
[2:17:10] him in in my study and in my notes i
[2:17:12] want to see him in the people i want to
[2:17:14] see him in my kids i want to see him in
[2:17:16] the church i want to see a manifest in a
[2:17:18] greater way
[2:17:20] it's not enough for a husband to say i
[2:17:22] got it you know there's no let it be
[2:17:24] that it just permeates and into our
[2:17:27] relationships into our workplaces
[2:17:30] friends
[2:17:31] the little story i told you about my
[2:17:32] wife going to houston meeting this guy
[2:17:35] these things they could be in all our
[2:17:37] lives
[2:17:39] i i i have a job i work at i have a
[2:17:41] business i run i i have a minister at a
[2:17:44] young i have a man who was a baptist um
[2:17:47] another gal who was a pentecostal worked
[2:17:49] for me and and they they noticed they
[2:17:51] said
[2:17:52] we know that you're busy on the weekends
[2:17:55] and they said
[2:17:56] and and he came to me and it's daryl he
[2:17:58] came to me one day and he says you know
[2:18:00] his dad was a baptist minister he says
[2:18:02] and and he says i don't serve god the
[2:18:04] way i should he's quite often golfing on
[2:18:07] a
[2:18:07] on a saturday or sunday but he he would
[2:18:10] say
[2:18:12] maybe i can do something to help you
[2:18:15] he says why don't you just take mondays
[2:18:17] off or monday mornings off or whatever
[2:18:18] you want
[2:18:19] i'll cover it i'll make sure i got you
[2:18:21] covered but in doing that maybe i can
[2:18:24] help the kingdom of god
[2:18:26] i said god may he honor them for that
[2:18:28] i had the lady the gal that worked for
[2:18:30] us at the time she and and it was at a
[2:18:32] time that we probably really needed her
[2:18:34] and and she had an offer to go back to a
[2:18:36] government job that was going to pay her
[2:18:38] up to ten dollars more an hour
[2:18:40] and she just said listen i need to let
[2:18:41] you know i've got this offer coming and
[2:18:44] and um
[2:18:45] she was at pentecostal gallon she she
[2:18:48] she says and i said okay well you know i
[2:18:50] understand and so i'm praying about it
[2:18:52] and so i'll pray about it too and after
[2:18:54] about 10 days she comes back to me says
[2:18:55] you know i feel it's the will of the
[2:18:57] lord for me to stay here
[2:18:59] i say god bless her for that
[2:19:01] you know i have people that i meet and i
[2:19:03] i don't know about you but i think
[2:19:06] there's a tribulation coming not
[2:19:07] everybody will be part of the message i
[2:19:09] don't want to see them go through
[2:19:10] anything
[2:19:11] and i say god
[2:19:13] and and if we really think about it
[2:19:16] they might not understand what you and i
[2:19:19] believe in doctrine
[2:19:21] but i believe there'll be something
[2:19:22] they'll have seen in our lives
[2:19:25] and how why do you say that brother
[2:19:26] eddis because
[2:19:27] there'll be those that are called
[2:19:29] foolish virgins
[2:19:30] that will give their lives in the
[2:19:32] tribulation they might so i met someone
[2:19:35] i knew someone they're not here anymore
[2:19:37] this is the time we're in the you know
[2:19:39] there's no end for the earth anymore
[2:19:42] they had something
[2:19:44] i'm going to give my life for something
[2:19:47] i i believe that that god is he's a god
[2:19:50] not of just a box called the message but
[2:19:52] it permeates it layers down and goes to
[2:19:55] people around us in the lives i you know
[2:19:57] i love it when i i told you about going
[2:19:59] shopping on holidays my wife i you know
[2:20:01] i i just sometimes love it because i
[2:20:04] i you know i'll let her take the cart
[2:20:06] and she'll walk ahead of me and and
[2:20:08] people are looking she's wearing a dress
[2:20:09] she's dressed she's got this aura about
[2:20:11] her she's and i'm kind of standing back
[2:20:13] and watching people ah that's my wife
[2:20:16] and
[2:20:17] i said and it's it's a great thing
[2:20:20] there's a brother
[2:20:21] years ago he was telling me the two
[2:20:23] brothers was two couples
[2:20:25] husband and wife husband and wife and
[2:20:27] they were traveling they were going
[2:20:28] along a road trip in the united states
[2:20:30] and they came to a lookout point and
[2:20:31] they're at a lookout point and the two
[2:20:32] husbands got out and they're just taking
[2:20:34] a picture and they're talking they
[2:20:35] happen to meet a
[2:20:36] a couple an older couple there and
[2:20:38] they're talking to the older couple and
[2:20:40] as they're talking to him he said
[2:20:42] they're at this lookout and they got to
[2:20:44] that they were christians and that they
[2:20:46] believed the message of william branham
[2:20:47] and these two men said hey we were in
[2:20:49] william branham's meetings
[2:20:51] and he said really he says yeah with
[2:20:53] such and such he says well did you know
[2:20:55] that there's actually tapes and i meant
[2:20:56] no we didn't know anything about that
[2:20:58] but we were in the meetings and said
[2:20:59] well let me tell you like it wasn't just
[2:21:01] that that was the message that was the
[2:21:03] shout you know there's more there's
[2:21:04] tapes there's there's churches all
[2:21:06] around it came with god's word to the
[2:21:08] hour and they're trying to explain these
[2:21:10] men are looking there and and he says
[2:21:12] you know he looked at these men they're
[2:21:13] older men their wives are short hairs
[2:21:15] they're wearing pants and things and
[2:21:16] they're trying to say no this is the
[2:21:18] life of god this is it you know by this
[2:21:20] time they've been talking a considerable
[2:21:22] time
[2:21:23] sometimes
[2:21:24] sometimes it's
[2:21:27] sometimes it's the sisters that talk
[2:21:29] longer than the brothers but there are
[2:21:31] times
[2:21:32] brother brother brother
[2:21:34] daniel he told me he says because his
[2:21:36] wife was just fellowshipping with people
[2:21:38] i said oh there's going to be invalids
[2:21:39] tonight this is why oh she's talking
[2:21:41] their arms and legs off again
[2:21:43] and but you know he just he you know
[2:21:46] these brothers were there and so their
[2:21:48] wives kind of came up
[2:21:50] behind them and beside them and and now
[2:21:52] everything that they had just shared
[2:21:54] here's this woman stands up beside
[2:21:57] and the men are looking
[2:22:00] this is a display of the message
[2:22:04] oh friends it's it's glorious
[2:22:07] it's beautiful
[2:22:09] and we need to treasure it
[2:22:11] and we need to we need to invest into it
[2:22:14] we need to give our time to it and into
[2:22:16] our children
[2:22:18] i remember our son caleb he's
[2:22:20] he had difficulty in school my daughter
[2:22:23] was an academic but caleb was
[2:22:25] was like he was a struggle it was
[2:22:27] difficult he had to leave sort of this
[2:22:29] christian based area that we were in to
[2:22:31] go to a specialty school specialty
[2:22:32] learning
[2:22:33] and and it was just it was a burden and
[2:22:35] we prayed and we labored for him and and
[2:22:37] we we had to tell the teacher because
[2:22:39] they had halloween they had all these
[2:22:40] things and you know he's not going to
[2:22:42] participate in things so anyway one day
[2:22:44] he had a substitute teacher he's about
[2:22:46] eight years old he had a substitute
[2:22:47] teacher and they're going to go to a
[2:22:49] rally in the in the gym and in the gym
[2:22:51] they're going to play this we will rock
[2:22:53] you song or something and and
[2:22:55] everybody's going to dance around the
[2:22:56] whole gym and and he comes up to the
[2:22:58] teacher he says i can't go there to the
[2:23:00] substitute teacher i can't go there no
[2:23:02] just go anyway he says no my mom would
[2:23:04] not want me to do this i'll just go
[2:23:06] anyway he says you don't know my mom
[2:23:08] [Laughter]
[2:23:14] caleb was so expressive
[2:23:18] it was it was a joy he he said many
[2:23:20] things that stuck with us you know
[2:23:22] oh man you don't know my mom you know
[2:23:24] what i think these things are real
[2:23:26] i think if we invest in them i i you
[2:23:30] just just think about this there's a
[2:23:32] little girl
[2:23:33] who grew up in the time of elijah
[2:23:36] little girl she she's she's in a home
[2:23:39] she's you know just a little maid and
[2:23:41] syrian bands came and they took her
[2:23:43] captive and she ended up in the home of
[2:23:45] naaman
[2:23:46] and she's in the home of naaman and
[2:23:48] she's there and this her name is a leper
[2:23:50] and one day she's away from everything
[2:23:52] she's away from her home she's away from
[2:23:54] her family but but somehow she was
[2:23:57] taught right she grew up in an
[2:23:59] atmosphere there was something in it now
[2:24:01] she didn't know all the things but she
[2:24:03] knew that all things are possible god
[2:24:06] can do everything and she grew up in
[2:24:08] this atmosphere and as she grew up in
[2:24:10] this atmosphere she sees the mistress
[2:24:12] crying and there's a mistress is crying
[2:24:14] she just says what's the matter says my
[2:24:16] husband's a leper oh
[2:24:18] and
[2:24:19] never had a leper been cleansed in
[2:24:21] israel yet but out of a little girl
[2:24:24] growing up in the right atmosphere with
[2:24:26] uh with and i'd say this with a father
[2:24:29] and a mother as a gardener and creating
[2:24:31] an atmosphere and doing things this
[2:24:33] woman this little girl under inspiration
[2:24:35] oh if he could only go back to israel
[2:24:38] we've got elijah the prophet
[2:24:41] did that come from i'll tell you what
[2:24:44] it's because there was something created
[2:24:47] and out of that you don't know how it'll
[2:24:49] manifest
[2:24:50] i say this invest in it do everything
[2:24:53] you can plug into it plug into one
[2:24:55] another
[2:24:56] encourage one another help your children
[2:25:00] it'll be wonderful i believe we'll see
[2:25:02] more of god
[2:25:05] my my my
[2:25:06] okay i want to get into this with the
[2:25:08] seals now brother branham takes god in
[2:25:10] simplicity
[2:25:12] i don't know you're all pulling me into
[2:25:13] different directions here
[2:25:15] maybe i'm doing that myself but whatever
[2:25:18] now brother branham hears questions and
[2:25:20] answers the seals he's preached to six
[2:25:22] seals
[2:25:23] now he's coming up to the sunday morning
[2:25:25] and then that night is the seventh seal
[2:25:29] and he says now take my advice brother
[2:25:31] don't put your own interpretation to
[2:25:33] nothing
[2:25:34] go and live a good christian life you'll
[2:25:38] only wind yourself away from the real
[2:25:41] thing when you do it
[2:25:43] you'll wind away
[2:25:45] again from the thing
[2:25:47] now you're all conscious there's there's
[2:25:49] something happening
[2:25:51] it's happening and i know what it is
[2:25:54] now i'm not saying it it's the grace of
[2:25:56] god that lets me know it it's something
[2:25:58] tremendous it's going on right now and
[2:26:01] there's not a way in the world for you
[2:26:03] to see it
[2:26:04] and he says but so help me with this
[2:26:07] bible in my hand i know what it is
[2:26:09] now he says this again i'll i'll tell
[2:26:11] you
[2:26:12] uh you you fast forward
[2:26:14] uh it's one of the messages in 65 but
[2:26:16] brother or maybe 63. brother adam talks
[2:26:19] about that that cap that he comes up to
[2:26:21] and with the crowbar he ripped off the
[2:26:23] thing and there was and it says
[2:26:26] light has never shone on this before and
[2:26:28] he tells the brother now you just stay
[2:26:31] and you look on this
[2:26:33] don't go anywhere else he says and i
[2:26:35] slipped away and he says and i watched
[2:26:37] them a few stayed but others went this
[2:26:40] way others went that way others went
[2:26:42] that way keep your eyes on the real
[2:26:45] thing don't go into your own things
[2:26:47] brother i'm saying don't put your own
[2:26:49] interpretation
[2:26:51] so he says now
[2:26:53] we're living in a time
[2:26:55] where
[2:26:56] just be real humble be a christian
[2:26:59] try to live god live honest with your
[2:27:01] fellow man love those who don't love you
[2:27:04] he says don't try to make any dot dot
[2:27:07] dot you see
[2:27:08] when you do it only makes a mysterious
[2:27:11] something and you mess up the real
[2:27:13] program of god
[2:27:15] oh
[2:27:17] you don't have to figure it all out
[2:27:19] this is i'm here lord let your word be
[2:27:21] born in my heart
[2:27:24] he said yesterday afternoon something
[2:27:25] happened in my room
[2:27:27] i'll never be able to leave it
[2:27:29] now church
[2:27:30] you're not supposed to know these things
[2:27:33] now that doesn't mean forever he says
[2:27:36] he says it'll happen but he says in one
[2:27:38] place he says it'll be a little more in
[2:27:41] season
[2:27:42] so as as we just said on on friday
[2:27:45] nights when you're walking in the
[2:27:46] unfolding you're not looking at
[2:27:48] something but now you're looking with
[2:27:50] real time you're seeing it all around
[2:27:52] you not just the anointing on your first
[2:27:55] eyesight but now it's going into your
[2:27:57] understanding and your reality of
[2:27:58] everything now as you walk in it and you
[2:28:01] say oh that's what this is that's what
[2:28:03] this is why because it's it's in a
[2:28:06] secret place it's not a public show it's
[2:28:08] to the individual so brother branham
[2:28:10] will go on and he'll he'll just say this
[2:28:12] every time you do that he said let your
[2:28:14] testimony be in love with the people
[2:28:16] because if you don't you're going to
[2:28:18] twist yourself out into something don't
[2:28:21] try to make no interpretation and when
[2:28:24] that seal comes up in front of you don't
[2:28:26] try to interpret
[2:28:28] just live humble go right on with the
[2:28:30] message
[2:28:31] and i already shared the quote about you
[2:28:33] know is will their bride have a ministry
[2:28:35] they ask a question should evangelists
[2:28:37] continue in the field they ask him other
[2:28:39] questions because in the mind of people
[2:28:40] their expectation it's the end
[2:28:43] and and we we can't do it and brother
[2:28:44] branham he tries to work through it and
[2:28:47] people quitting their jobs and and just
[2:28:49] selling their houses and not going on
[2:28:51] and he's trying to tell them
[2:28:52] no no no no just go on
[2:28:56] and he says should evangelists continue
[2:28:57] in the field in this hour of course you
[2:29:00] should if jesus comes in the morning
[2:29:02] preach today like it's going to be 10
[2:29:04] years don't get scrupled up i'm trying
[2:29:06] to warn you don't be honor peculiar
[2:29:09] don't change nothing continue in there
[2:29:11] if you're building a house put it up if
[2:29:13] jesus comes tomorrow i'd rather be
[2:29:15] faithful at my duty continue on there's
[2:29:18] more of this i can read if you're
[2:29:19] planting wheat plant your wheat if
[2:29:21] you're digging potatoes go on and dig a
[2:29:23] mountain well nobody'll eat them that
[2:29:24] doesn't make a difference then he says
[2:29:27] somebody told him sell the farm should i
[2:29:28] and what do we do and he says don't do
[2:29:30] that he says let your children have the
[2:29:33] farmer they can eat off and do all these
[2:29:35] things i'll put my crop in today i'll be
[2:29:36] a farmer be a mechanic be whatever he
[2:29:39] made you
[2:29:40] and then a fellow came to him
[2:29:43] he says here you can have these keys a
[2:29:45] man told his pastor i bought a new car
[2:29:47] i'm not going to ge i'm going to give
[2:29:48] you the second keys what are you giving
[2:29:50] them to me for well if the rapture comes
[2:29:52] i won't be needing them you can have
[2:29:53] them
[2:29:54] there's a lot of faith there but you're
[2:29:55] a pastor right it says we mustn't be
[2:29:58] that way the pastor is going to miss it
[2:29:59] we mustn't be that way
[2:30:01] my my my okay i i gotta just take this a
[2:30:04] little further let's go back to genesis
[2:30:06] chapter 1 verse 26 are you good yet
[2:30:09] well i don't know what know what the
[2:30:10] time is
[2:30:11] and you know how bad my watch is i've
[2:30:12] already shared that a couple of times
[2:30:14] so genesis chapter 1
[2:30:17] now in here
[2:30:21] brother branham would say
[2:30:25] verse i i you could read verse 26 27 god
[2:30:29] created but in verse 28
[2:30:31] and
[2:30:32] chapter one god blessed them and god
[2:30:34] said unto them
[2:30:35] be fruitful and be and multiply and
[2:30:38] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[2:30:41] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[2:30:44] over the fowl of the air and over every
[2:30:46] living thing
[2:30:47] so
[2:30:48] this is the command now it's given to
[2:30:50] adam in theophany form
[2:30:52] and it's when it was adam and eve
[2:30:54] together
[2:30:55] but now in in and you you realize all of
[2:30:58] genesis chapter 1 that was spoken
[2:31:01] but genesis 2 now that was six days in
[2:31:03] genesis 1. genesis 2 was the seventh day
[2:31:08] and and god was resting there was
[2:31:10] nothing happening it was quiet now if
[2:31:13] you take the perspective of the angels
[2:31:15] they heard all these things
[2:31:17] if you take the perspective of lucifer
[2:31:19] who's watching all of this
[2:31:21] you know and and brother branham in
[2:31:23] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[2:31:25] says about the seventh seal
[2:31:27] he said
[2:31:28] don't try and figure it out he says but
[2:31:30] it's revealed in every type in the bible
[2:31:34] and he says
[2:31:35] and and i say who is the central theme
[2:31:37] of the bible it's christ
[2:31:39] so he says now take it back to genesis
[2:31:42] 1. here god speaks he's done speaking
[2:31:46] now
[2:31:47] the earth itself being a womb
[2:31:50] and the womb had to receive that word
[2:31:53] and because god said let it bring forth
[2:31:55] it always says let the earth bring forth
[2:31:59] and let it do this now under the seventh
[2:32:01] day
[2:32:02] under a day of rest now we see these are
[2:32:05] the generations and all of a sudden
[2:32:07] something started growing and i imagine
[2:32:09] the devil was looking
[2:32:11] how did that happen
[2:32:12] and then something else started growing
[2:32:14] how did that happen
[2:32:16] because it was god unseen unknown hidden
[2:32:20] and it wasn't seen and so you know the
[2:32:23] devil could look at it the same way
[2:32:24] denominations look at the message and
[2:32:26] say how did this message get into every
[2:32:28] country and everything because it's god
[2:32:31] it's not a program it's god who's in it
[2:32:34] the same god of genesis is the same god
[2:32:36] here how did god come into my life when
[2:32:38] i was a renegade didn't want it it was
[2:32:40] god that was working how does he come
[2:32:42] into our families and change them it's
[2:32:45] god that's doing it
[2:32:47] and and so
[2:32:48] it's all happening that way so here here
[2:32:51] all of this is happening now now think
[2:32:53] of i'll try and condense my thoughts
[2:32:54] here think of the earth as a womb and
[2:32:57] the seed had to be planted in it
[2:33:00] now let's go just a step further god god
[2:33:03] talks about
[2:33:05] um
[2:33:06] jesus had to be made manifest
[2:33:09] he was that real germ of life the real
[2:33:12] seed
[2:33:13] but in order for him to be manifest he
[2:33:15] had to have a womb and it was it was
[2:33:17] taken by someone had a receiving set i i
[2:33:20] don't know what went on with mary mary
[2:33:23] a young girl
[2:33:25] many young girls had tried to think i'll
[2:33:26] be the virgin that conceives but mary
[2:33:29] maybe heard that in the service one time
[2:33:31] and her heart was warmed so she had to
[2:33:33] be able to receive to open her mind to
[2:33:36] that to believe that and that's the way
[2:33:38] we need to be just to have a welcome and
[2:33:40] receiving spirit to the things of god
[2:33:44] in the prayer line brother mama says oh
[2:33:46] my you've got a welcome spirit around
[2:33:48] you you know god can work with that kind
[2:33:50] of a spirit that's an atmosphere that we
[2:33:52] create in our in our being and around us
[2:33:55] so he would i'm going to go ahead now he
[2:33:58] reads in spoken word is the original
[2:34:00] seed
[2:34:02] eve would have brought forth the child
[2:34:06] now it doesn't say adam would have he
[2:34:08] says eve eve was the womb
[2:34:11] that was there but satan he was
[2:34:13] attacking the womb
[2:34:15] and he said and he got her to disbelieve
[2:34:17] she would have finally
[2:34:19] done it and then brother evan says did
[2:34:21] not god tell her
[2:34:23] multiply and replenish the earth now the
[2:34:26] command was given to adam but the
[2:34:28] manifestation was through eve now i want
[2:34:32] you to look at this because the earth is
[2:34:34] a womb but the woman the church is also
[2:34:37] a womb to reproduce christ again
[2:34:41] paul would tell the church he would say
[2:34:43] to the women naturally speaking you will
[2:34:46] be saved in child bearing now that is
[2:34:49] that is a part of what the woman is here
[2:34:52] for that's not the only thing but he
[2:34:54] says that's a part of what she's here
[2:34:55] for but he's also talking to the church
[2:34:58] spiritual
[2:34:59] when you're bringing forth children when
[2:35:01] the life of god is flowing through your
[2:35:04] church that's when the church is
[2:35:06] prospering the life of god is going on
[2:35:08] in the church
[2:35:10] so so now brother ram says now
[2:35:13] about eve he says
[2:35:16] what happened before adam got to her she
[2:35:19] was already a mother
[2:35:21] and and he says
[2:35:22] she she hybrid god's word so the devil
[2:35:25] came in he injected himself but he says
[2:35:28] it was to have come through eve now eve
[2:35:31] didn't think she was wrong eve thought
[2:35:33] she was right and he says it happened to
[2:35:36] eve's children it happens in this last
[2:35:38] day so
[2:35:39] what we need to have is a receiving set
[2:35:42] that allows the word to be able to have
[2:35:45] a betting ground to work in
[2:35:48] go with me just for a moment
[2:35:50] to genesis 9 you're in if you're still
[2:35:52] in genesis 1 genesis 9
[2:35:54] this is just after the flood
[2:35:58] and
[2:35:59] and in genesis 9 now the flood noah
[2:36:02] comes out of the flood
[2:36:04] and there's a rainbow and god says this
[2:36:07] is my covenant
[2:36:09] and and then the sons of noah came forth
[2:36:11] from the ark shem ham japeth ham was the
[2:36:14] father of canaan which was the serpents
[2:36:16] he'd crept through the middle of that
[2:36:18] but in verse 20 it says this and i i've
[2:36:20] always kind of just marveled at this a
[2:36:21] little bit
[2:36:22] and noah began to be
[2:36:25] a husbandman
[2:36:27] and he planted a vineyard
[2:36:30] so in other words
[2:36:31] noah couldn't make things grow
[2:36:35] but like adam was given the original con
[2:36:38] the original commission
[2:36:40] you know he says
[2:36:41] you are here to dress and keep it
[2:36:44] keep it in the right channel keep it in
[2:36:46] the right place
[2:36:48] and it says now you can you can tie this
[2:36:50] right back to cain and abel
[2:36:52] if you actually look in in genesis 4
[2:36:55] here's cain and abel they're immediately
[2:36:58] identified by their occupations
[2:37:01] what their passion was one was a tiller
[2:37:03] of the ground that was cane and the
[2:37:05] other was a keeper of the sheep
[2:37:07] now you think well tilling the ground
[2:37:09] that's a good thing but if you actually
[2:37:11] look what kane did with the ground he
[2:37:13] brought out minerals he brought out
[2:37:14] things to build cities with he did all
[2:37:16] those things it was a different
[2:37:18] inspiration
[2:37:20] but but
[2:37:21] what he lived by
[2:37:23] became the seeds of civilization if you
[2:37:25] look at at
[2:37:27] at uh
[2:37:28] abel he he just worked with the sheep he
[2:37:30] was humble he was simple this is where
[2:37:33] now god is under the first stage of
[2:37:35] redeeming the earth here comes noah out
[2:37:37] and the first thing is he's a husband
[2:37:39] man
[2:37:40] he's he's one who's whose basis is not
[2:37:43] to try to recreate but just to work with
[2:37:45] the economy of god replenish the earth
[2:37:47] and and and noah began to work with that
[2:37:49] and do those things i'm moving quickly
[2:37:52] now
[2:37:53] i'm going to take a few examples first
[2:37:54] kings chapter 17. i'm i'm using that as
[2:37:57] a stage now i'm going a little further
[2:38:00] first kings 17 this is where
[2:38:02] in the time of elijah
[2:38:05] there was elijah the prophet
[2:38:08] he was a great man he comes and stomps
[2:38:11] in verse 1 before the king says there'll
[2:38:13] be no dew or rain according to my word
[2:38:16] he goes up into the brook cherish and as
[2:38:18] a cherith and as he's there the ravens
[2:38:21] brought food and flesh and after a while
[2:38:23] the brook dried up and there was no rain
[2:38:25] in the land partly because of his own
[2:38:27] prophecy
[2:38:29] but how was god going to sustain him
[2:38:32] next verse and the word of the lord came
[2:38:34] to now go down to zarapath which belongs
[2:38:37] in zidane and dwell there
[2:38:39] i have commanded a widow
[2:38:42] woman to sustain thee now a woman is a
[2:38:45] type of the receiving and she was a
[2:38:47] widow woman she was dead to her first
[2:38:49] husband but she was and i'm not saying
[2:38:52] to bring this into a natural
[2:38:53] relationship but it's a type of we who
[2:38:56] may have been out in a relationship in a
[2:38:58] church world or something but we're dead
[2:39:00] to that and and we're the woman where
[2:39:02] the receiving set and so he's given that
[2:39:05] command he goes down he meets this woman
[2:39:07] gathering sticks and he tells her to get
[2:39:09] him water and a vessel that he may drink
[2:39:11] and and he says
[2:39:12] and and he tells her to give it to her
[2:39:14] and and and she says i
[2:39:17] uh in verse 11 and she was going to
[2:39:19] fetch it so she started moving
[2:39:22] old friends that's so important
[2:39:24] when when the bible says when moses
[2:39:27] saw the pillar of fire
[2:39:30] he reverenced it and he took off his
[2:39:32] shoes and when god saw that he stopped
[2:39:35] then god visited him there was a prayer
[2:39:37] line the other day i was listening to
[2:39:38] him brother madam says
[2:39:39] he says oh there's a sister oh it's
[2:39:41] passed over you
[2:39:43] in the audience and then he goes oh
[2:39:45] you're looking for it he's come to you
[2:39:48] he comes to those that are ready to
[2:39:50] receive him ready to desire him so so
[2:39:53] it's it's about creating that atmosphere
[2:39:56] so here this woman she had something in
[2:39:58] her she's going to fetch it he says
[2:40:00] bring me i pray the a morsel of bread
[2:40:02] and verse 12 and she said as the lord
[2:40:04] god lives i don't have a cake i don't
[2:40:06] have a handful of meal i'm gathering two
[2:40:08] sticks but she was going she was already
[2:40:10] moving and as she was moving now in
[2:40:13] verse 13 elijah says fear not
[2:40:16] go and do as thou hast said make me a
[2:40:17] little cake bring it unto me after that
[2:40:20] make for me and for thy son
[2:40:22] and then and then he's saying that
[2:40:25] thus saith the lord the barrel of meal
[2:40:28] shall not waste neither the crews of oil
[2:40:30] fail until the day the lord sends rain
[2:40:33] on the earth now this was happening in
[2:40:34] secret she had a barrel of meal in her
[2:40:37] house she had this
[2:40:39] you know we we have a church it's right
[2:40:40] in the middle of a residential area and
[2:40:42] our neighbors look you know these people
[2:40:44] they gather on sunday morning they
[2:40:45] gather on sunday night they gather on
[2:40:47] wednesday they they they seem to be
[2:40:49] always you know going about their
[2:40:51] they've got this membership is good and
[2:40:53] it's this and in the time of pandemic
[2:40:55] they went and they did this and what's
[2:40:57] going on in there
[2:40:58] it's the same thing that was going on
[2:41:00] here spiritually speaking there was
[2:41:02] always food there was always something
[2:41:04] sustaining so it was happening and and
[2:41:06] so that that barrel of meal now look at
[2:41:10] she created a place and whatever
[2:41:12] happened thereafter because after that
[2:41:15] her son passed away and she cried unto
[2:41:18] god and and she calls on elijah have you
[2:41:20] brought my sins to my remembrance i've
[2:41:22] sold out to this
[2:41:24] and and under selling it out every need
[2:41:27] was taken care of
[2:41:29] and so it was this now i'm going to just
[2:41:31] jump ahead a little bit
[2:41:34] and
[2:41:35] i want to just say this
[2:41:37] elijah and elisha is a type
[2:41:39] so there's four miracles in elijah there
[2:41:41] was eight miracles under elisha but what
[2:41:44] elijah did was almost on a more national
[2:41:47] scale
[2:41:48] it was speaking to the king it was it
[2:41:51] was calling down fire was doing
[2:41:53] different things but now under elisha it
[2:41:55] goes to another level and if you
[2:41:58] actually look at an elisha the first
[2:42:00] thing that happens i think was was that
[2:42:02] there was this
[2:42:03] an army was coming and elijah he had to
[2:42:06] say something
[2:42:07] before he could say anything he had to
[2:42:09] create an atmosphere he said bring me a
[2:42:11] minstrel i i i got to get in the spirit
[2:42:14] i got to get in the move and then he
[2:42:16] prophesied but now look at all the
[2:42:18] things that happened
[2:42:19] it was on a common level it was a worker
[2:42:22] who lost his acts
[2:42:24] and elisha under the word of elisha he
[2:42:27] made that axe head to float
[2:42:29] that god is still our god today it may
[2:42:31] not be on the level of brother branham
[2:42:33] but it's come down to our level he's
[2:42:35] interested in your job and your
[2:42:37] schooling he's interested in all of
[2:42:39] these things that's the god that's
[2:42:41] moving with us and among us
[2:42:44] and there was different things there was
[2:42:45] the pot the meal the meal was this and
[2:42:48] that and and and it was at a level that
[2:42:50] was an everyday
[2:42:52] level and i could read more of it and
[2:42:55] you you'd all know in second kings and
[2:42:57] you could read in second kings chapter
[2:42:59] two and it was about the shunamite woman
[2:43:01] you know it was just so simple she was
[2:43:03] an old woman she never asked for
[2:43:04] anything but she felt for the prophet
[2:43:07] and she created a room said let's build
[2:43:09] a little room for him a place where we
[2:43:12] can put a bed let's create an atmosphere
[2:43:15] let's just be a gardener for the word of
[2:43:18] god let's create something where god's
[2:43:21] prophet can be sustained and be helped
[2:43:24] and and friends the message we have
[2:43:26] would be nothing if there wasn't
[2:43:28] somebody to receive it it wouldn't be
[2:43:31] anything if there wasn't a receiving set
[2:43:33] thank god that he sent the receiving
[2:43:35] said he placed something in us
[2:43:37] now you've got to culture it you've got
[2:43:39] to nurture it
[2:43:41] and this woman did that and so and it so
[2:43:43] came to pass and time he said to go he's
[2:43:45] like she's done so much good for us what
[2:43:47] is she lacking she's old and she doesn't
[2:43:49] have a child and he began to immediately
[2:43:51] speak and life came forth
[2:43:53] now look at how this condescends and
[2:43:56] brings to a level we you can read a
[2:43:58] further part of this story
[2:44:00] in in
[2:44:01] second kings eight where this elijah
[2:44:04] told that woman to go away for seven
[2:44:06] years there's going to be a famine in
[2:44:08] the land at the end of the seven years
[2:44:10] she comes back
[2:44:12] right at the time that they're talking
[2:44:14] about elijah and this woman and the
[2:44:16] great things he did and then the king
[2:44:18] empowers a messenger she says restore
[2:44:22] that woman all she lost restore
[2:44:25] everything to her and then he says and
[2:44:27] give her back that and give her
[2:44:29] everything her lands and all that she
[2:44:30] lost in that time
[2:44:32] this is types that pertain to us i'm
[2:44:35] going through it quickly but i i just
[2:44:37] trust you catch where we're going
[2:44:40] one more second kings four
[2:44:42] let's just turn to this one second kings
[2:44:44] four
[2:44:45] this is
[2:44:47] the cried a certain woman verse
[2:44:49] 1 of the wives of the sons of the
[2:44:51] prophets
[2:44:53] and again it's a woman it's a betting
[2:44:54] ground my husband is dead now in this
[2:44:57] case her husband was a servant of god
[2:45:01] under elijah
[2:45:02] and he says you know elijah
[2:45:05] elisha you know
[2:45:07] that my servant feared the lord now the
[2:45:10] creditors have come to take unto him my
[2:45:13] two sons to be a bond bond men and
[2:45:15] elijah said unto her what shall i do for
[2:45:17] you and then he asks this question
[2:45:20] what is in your house
[2:45:24] now this this comes right down to the
[2:45:26] level
[2:45:27] not about what happened when brother
[2:45:29] branham was in the meetings or in
[2:45:31] portland or or what happens at church
[2:45:34] but it comes right to our house
[2:45:36] and there's a need and he says
[2:45:38] he says i have nothing except this pot
[2:45:42] of oil
[2:45:43] and now he says go
[2:45:45] borrow the vessels
[2:45:47] not a few vessels
[2:45:49] all empty vessels don't borrow a few but
[2:45:51] when you get them all come in and now he
[2:45:53] says shut the door
[2:45:55] it's just you in the house
[2:45:58] i'm not going to come
[2:46:00] god's already with you
[2:46:02] and under that atmosphere as she began
[2:46:04] to pour according to the word
[2:46:07] it multiplied it multiplied it
[2:46:10] multiplied
[2:46:12] friends our expectation i don't know how
[2:46:14] god does these things
[2:46:17] friends we we our kids they've gone
[2:46:20] through struggles but i'm thankful
[2:46:22] for where they're at and where god's
[2:46:24] taking them
[2:46:25] and i think that it's possible that we
[2:46:27] can we can bring them up and we can
[2:46:30] claim them and we can have them
[2:46:32] and that is the greatest thing that we
[2:46:34] can have
[2:46:35] and she did that
[2:46:36] i i already read i told you about the
[2:46:38] story of naaman you know you could even
[2:46:41] you could go to others and and that are
[2:46:43] there other incidents and and different
[2:46:45] things under this time
[2:46:48] but it's god that's working in the midst
[2:46:50] of them
[2:46:51] now let me go just
[2:46:53] just give me about another 15 minutes
[2:46:55] here and then we'll we'll just
[2:46:57] try to wind this up
[2:46:59] isaiah 40 had this is going back to what
[2:47:02] i read in in in the earlier in the thing
[2:47:06] but isaiah had 40 had one of the
[2:47:08] greatest
[2:47:11] prophecies
[2:47:12] about
[2:47:14] a messenger and it would talk about the
[2:47:16] voice of him crying in the wilderness
[2:47:18] make straight
[2:47:20] in the desert a highway for our lord
[2:47:23] and the terminology he uses is amazing
[2:47:26] every valley shall be exalted chapter 40
[2:47:30] verse 4 now and he says and every
[2:47:32] mountain and hill
[2:47:34] shall be made low
[2:47:36] and the crooked shall be made straight
[2:47:39] and the rough places plain
[2:47:43] now it was
[2:47:45] simple or it seemed like
[2:47:47] it was so
[2:47:49] put a picture in the minds of the people
[2:47:52] and and there's other prophecies but the
[2:47:54] leaders the religious leaders in israel
[2:47:56] at the time of jesus
[2:47:58] they weren't looking for one that was
[2:48:00] meek and lowly they were looking for a
[2:48:02] general
[2:48:03] and and even john the baptist you know
[2:48:05] his work was so important
[2:48:09] let me just slow down just for a minute
[2:48:10] just can you you're with me still i
[2:48:12] don't want to wear you
[2:48:14] and i know there's a meal planned and i
[2:48:16] i promise i won't
[2:48:18] interfere with that
[2:48:20] brother branham and i i want you just to
[2:48:22] think about this
[2:48:24] john's work was so important
[2:48:26] god would not let him stay among the
[2:48:28] mainstream
[2:48:29] he had to pull him aside into the desert
[2:48:31] and when he came out he used language
[2:48:33] like vipers and snakes and things
[2:48:36] but he was completely sold out to god
[2:48:40] brother branham comes and you know his
[2:48:42] story his life story is amazing
[2:48:44] but he comes out and he met this dr
[2:48:47] davis and he had the visions and he says
[2:48:49] oh that's of the devil and and you know
[2:48:51] he tried to
[2:48:53] get away from it but but god kept
[2:48:56] leading him
[2:48:57] and then you know it was
[2:48:59] it was when he had
[2:49:01] um along the way
[2:49:03] he went to that meeting at mishawaka
[2:49:06] and uh
[2:49:07] you know there was
[2:49:09] on a level he'd never experienced before
[2:49:12] and and he saw the things happening and
[2:49:14] he came back and he told his wife we're
[2:49:16] going to go up there those people want
[2:49:18] us and his mother-in-law
[2:49:20] told him and said you're not bringing my
[2:49:22] daughter
[2:49:23] to that trash
[2:49:25] and brother branham said okay i won't
[2:49:28] that was a hard
[2:49:29] hard lesson
[2:49:32] how does god form us
[2:49:34] how did god form the prophet now i want
[2:49:36] you just to think about this
[2:49:39] god had to bring the word
[2:49:41] that from the book of genesis there was
[2:49:44] parts of it that were held
[2:49:46] sealed daniel would refer to it seal up
[2:49:49] those things
[2:49:50] john on the isle of patmos
[2:49:52] seal up those things that were uttered
[2:49:53] but now god's got to prepare a vessel on
[2:49:56] earth
[2:49:57] to proclaim that
[2:49:59] but look how pure the betting ground had
[2:50:01] to be
[2:50:02] and god had to create this so the first
[2:50:05] thing so brother branham did that and he
[2:50:07] lost his wife
[2:50:10] and she knew why and bill brother
[2:50:12] brother branham knew why
[2:50:14] and then he lost his daughter
[2:50:17] and that was a hard hard lesson that was
[2:50:19] family
[2:50:20] now he's out with ministers they're
[2:50:22] going to africa
[2:50:25] and he had a vision that said go to
[2:50:27] india first
[2:50:29] and he's telling the brothers brother
[2:50:30] bosworth one of his greatest friends
[2:50:33] and brother brothers just said brother
[2:50:34] branham you could be wrong i heard one
[2:50:37] time where a vision
[2:50:38] adam had a vision and something and he
[2:50:40] says and brother madam was
[2:50:42] couldn't believe it and he spoke to god
[2:50:44] he says you can go but you're going to
[2:50:46] pay for it
[2:50:48] and he was was not falling and he took
[2:50:51] an amoeba as he called it and he was
[2:50:54] deathly ill for months and months and
[2:50:56] months
[2:50:57] and after that it came out
[2:50:59] and now you know you look at the purging
[2:51:02] the purging that was going the purging
[2:51:04] the purging
[2:51:05] now we're coming down to 1962
[2:51:08] brother branham has a vision of a brown
[2:51:10] bear and as he has the vision of this
[2:51:12] bear he's out with a number of men
[2:51:14] hunting i think was brother bud
[2:51:16] southwick and brother branham were the
[2:51:17] older brothers and then there was a
[2:51:19] number of younger brothers brother billy
[2:51:20] paul brother biscuit brother bud's son a
[2:51:23] few others
[2:51:24] and and some of this you'll see in tape
[2:51:26] some of it you can hear through by the
[2:51:27] biscuit's testimony
[2:51:29] but as he goes into that he has this
[2:51:32] vision of a mammoth brown bear
[2:51:34] and they're there and that night before
[2:51:36] they're at the campfire and the old men
[2:51:39] the the young men are just sort of
[2:51:40] kidding the old men you know you
[2:51:42] couldn't do
[2:51:43] you couldn't hit you know with your gun
[2:51:45] this and this and they're making fun of
[2:51:46] brother bud
[2:51:48] and brother branham now just just a
[2:51:49] human being
[2:51:51] feeling sorry for brother bud
[2:51:54] the next day he goes hunting with
[2:51:57] brother bud
[2:51:58] contrary to the vision
[2:52:01] and the other brothers the young
[2:52:03] brothers they talk about it brother
[2:52:04] biscuit shares in his testimony they're
[2:52:06] hunting and then they saw this huge
[2:52:08] brown bear come down
[2:52:11] and then he just caught a whiff of them
[2:52:13] and he went back up and he took off
[2:52:16] and then the next day it started to rain
[2:52:18] and for four days it rained rained
[2:52:20] rained they couldn't hunt anymore
[2:52:22] at the end of those days they're packing
[2:52:24] up to go out and brother
[2:52:26] brother branham tells brother biscuit he
[2:52:28] says i how long before we go it's
[2:52:30] probably another three hours he said i
[2:52:31] just got to go up
[2:52:33] and he went up to seek the lord
[2:52:35] and he comes back and he says
[2:52:37] all of this rain is because of me
[2:52:39] i was disobedient
[2:52:43] he says but it's over
[2:52:44] and god said we'll ride out dry.
[2:52:48] and brother biscuit says right out dry
[2:52:51] are you kidding we've been soaked
[2:52:54] and he says
[2:52:55] he was sitting there on his horse and
[2:52:57] just a little break a blue sky
[2:53:00] and a little waft of air comes through
[2:53:03] and it comes and also it just
[2:53:06] does all of this and he's and they're
[2:53:08] riding out in sunshine
[2:53:11] now i say all of this because you can go
[2:53:13] back in september of 1962 and you listen
[2:53:16] to some of the prayer lines and brother
[2:53:18] branham is confessing his sin in prayer
[2:53:21] and he's saying lord forgive me the
[2:53:23] other day there on the mountain and he's
[2:53:25] talking about to make a vision pass you
[2:53:28] have to be in the right place
[2:53:30] and he says and i missed it
[2:53:33] and he says forgive me lord
[2:53:35] i felt sorry for that old man
[2:53:38] and he says and i didn't want to have
[2:53:40] him hurt
[2:53:42] but i didn't realize i was hurting you
[2:53:44] you can hear it on a tape in a prayer
[2:53:46] line
[2:53:47] and i thought
[2:53:48] the molding and the school
[2:53:52] that that man had to go through
[2:53:54] now this is 1962 and he refers to it in
[2:53:57] a couple of messages
[2:53:59] but i almost view it as the last bit of
[2:54:01] humanity
[2:54:03] that was of brother branham that could
[2:54:05] have
[2:54:06] been gotten in god's plan
[2:54:09] and after this it wasn't now no more
[2:54:10] family it wasn't no more ministers it
[2:54:13] wasn't even human compassion anymore
[2:54:16] now it says lord whatever you want
[2:54:19] exactly
[2:54:20] prepared
[2:54:21] to deliver the seven seals
[2:54:24] which he said
[2:54:25] i would have done the wrong thing
[2:54:28] he says something came in the room now
[2:54:31] this was so sovereignly god it was not
[2:54:34] william branham it was not his thoughts
[2:54:37] but this was a vessel prepared that was
[2:54:40] going to give it to give out this word
[2:54:42] now i'm using this none of us are a
[2:54:44] prophet
[2:54:45] but neither do we see sometimes our
[2:54:47] humanity gets in the way we allow things
[2:54:50] to come we need to create an atmosphere
[2:54:53] you know if we're always proud i don't
[2:54:55] make mistakes i don't do this he that
[2:54:57] humbles himself he that makes himself
[2:55:00] little that makes him nothing this was
[2:55:02] the womb god was going to use for for
[2:55:05] the bringing forth of the word what
[2:55:07] about the womb for the manifestation of
[2:55:10] the word
[2:55:11] how we need to not just say oh that's
[2:55:12] just so and so no we need to reverence
[2:55:15] we need to create an atmosphere where
[2:55:17] our children learn to respect not not
[2:55:19] just the the prophet and the things we
[2:55:21] believe but even our homes our families
[2:55:23] our wives all of these things we want an
[2:55:25] atmosphere
[2:55:26] we're gardeners we're we're not we can't
[2:55:29] make it happen but we can create the
[2:55:31] atmosphere for god to come in and drop
[2:55:34] and do what he wants to do
[2:55:36] so here john yeah i won't read it all
[2:55:39] but you you can read in matthew chapter
[2:55:41] chapter 3 where he comes forward and and
[2:55:44] he identifies jesus and and then there's
[2:55:46] a further part of this in john chapter
[2:55:49] one and then he goes further and he he
[2:55:51] makes these words i must
[2:55:54] decrease
[2:55:55] he must increase
[2:55:58] and i i'll just be honest with you
[2:56:00] friends there was a time i was a young
[2:56:01] man as a minister and i thought oh man
[2:56:04] just to go on the mission field and i'll
[2:56:06] just do this it's adventure it's this
[2:56:08] and this
[2:56:09] i i would still have a heart for that
[2:56:12] but i i also would think oh it'd be
[2:56:14] wonderful just to go and preach and do
[2:56:15] these things
[2:56:16] i've kind of come to the place and said
[2:56:18] lord
[2:56:19] i don't want anything but what you want
[2:56:23] i i and i think
[2:56:25] if we're honest as ministers in fact
[2:56:27] lord if if i could just sort of hide in
[2:56:30] this room and you could take this
[2:56:32] i would rather that you would do this
[2:56:35] now that kind of an attitude i would say
[2:56:38] this if it's in the ministry i think
[2:56:39] that's wonderful
[2:56:40] i think it's even greater for those that
[2:56:43] are in any church and say lord
[2:56:45] wherever you take this service whatever
[2:56:47] you do
[2:56:48] i'm with you lord i'll move with you
[2:56:51] because you're in control
[2:56:53] and so what do we do when we come we've
[2:56:55] got to create an atmosphere we've got to
[2:56:57] create a place now
[2:56:59] you could say john was the forerunner in
[2:57:01] john chapter 3 he talks about being you
[2:57:04] know he talks about his desire and i'll
[2:57:07] maybe read this one
[2:57:08] if i can just just briefly in john
[2:57:10] chapter 3
[2:57:12] and and this is in verse 27
[2:57:15] john answered and said a man can receive
[2:57:17] nothing except it be given him from
[2:57:19] heaven
[2:57:20] you yourselves bear me witness i am not
[2:57:23] the christ
[2:57:24] but i am him that sent before him
[2:57:27] now look at these words
[2:57:29] he
[2:57:30] that hath the bride
[2:57:32] is the bridegroom
[2:57:35] the friend of the bridegroom
[2:57:37] which stands
[2:57:40] and hears him rejoices greatly because
[2:57:44] of the bridegroom's voice
[2:57:47] thereby my joy is fulfilled
[2:57:51] it wasn't when john's ministry was
[2:57:53] decreasing i'm
[2:57:55] my ministry's over i got to give it over
[2:57:57] no that was his whole purpose he wasn't
[2:58:00] just looking at him he wasn't he wasn't
[2:58:02] the donkey that was carrying the word
[2:58:04] and saying i'm the donkey look at me no
[2:58:06] he was saying this is the word look at
[2:58:08] him look at him look at him
[2:58:10] that was his joy
[2:58:12] our joy is when we can see that the life
[2:58:14] that's in us is not our own doing when
[2:58:16] it's his life when it's god working with
[2:58:18] our children sovereignly
[2:58:21] i think that ought to be the thing that
[2:58:23] we look for when it's god working in our
[2:58:25] homes
[2:58:26] we need an atmosphere
[2:58:28] the lease are of this day
[2:58:31] oh my let me let me read this one
[2:58:33] one one one part i read it early in
[2:58:35] present stage brother miss i hope he
[2:58:37] lets me crown me he said there's going
[2:58:39] to be a bride look at brother branham's
[2:58:40] desire
[2:58:42] and and he said he's going to have a
[2:58:44] bride she's going to be without spot and
[2:58:46] wrinkle
[2:58:47] and
[2:58:48] they're going to appear before him that
[2:58:50] way he says and they have the material
[2:58:52] on earth now to make themselves ready
[2:58:56] the word that we're clothed in
[2:58:58] that's how we get ready
[2:59:00] and he says
[2:59:02] oh lord if you can take this evil spirit
[2:59:04] for me i'll serve you that's up to you
[2:59:05] but you've got something to do too
[2:59:09] the bride has made herself ready
[2:59:12] oh god cannot push us through a pipe
[2:59:15] pull us out on the other end and then
[2:59:16] say blessed is he that overcomes you got
[2:59:18] nothing overcome you he pushed you
[2:59:20] through but you've got to make decisions
[2:59:23] for yourself
[2:59:24] brother branham would say do you want
[2:59:26] the word to have the preeminence in your
[2:59:28] myth or do you want to see a deity in
[2:59:30] your midst he says then welcome and
[2:59:32] receive the word
[2:59:34] that's what will bring forth that thing
[2:59:36] you know i i look at paul even paul
[2:59:40] i'm just slowly winding my thoughts down
[2:59:42] here paul would say in second
[2:59:43] corinthians 10 you know he's he's
[2:59:46] talking just just about himself and his
[2:59:48] own ministry paul he had to leave
[2:59:50] everything and and do that and he he's
[2:59:53] he's chastening the corinthians in verse
[2:59:55] 7 he says do you look on things on the
[2:59:58] outward appearance if any man trust
[3:00:00] himself that he's christ let him think
[3:00:02] this again that he is christ even as we
[3:00:05] are christ
[3:00:07] now drop down to verse 10 and they say
[3:00:09] paul says
[3:00:11] for his letters now his own letters say
[3:00:13] they are weighty and powerful
[3:00:15] but his bodily presence is weak and his
[3:00:18] speech is contemptible
[3:00:21] god allowed it to be that paul's
[3:00:23] greatest ministry was going to be from a
[3:00:25] prison was going to be from his epistles
[3:00:27] because even paul's appearance would
[3:00:30] would bring they'd say what's with him
[3:00:33] i remember brother tim pruitt telling me
[3:00:34] one time he said he was called somewhere
[3:00:36] to minister a man had only heard this is
[3:00:38] before the days of internet had only
[3:00:40] heard of brother tim pruitt and heard
[3:00:42] tapes of him and did different things
[3:00:44] and and he he came and he says brother
[3:00:45] tim i want to invite you for meetings
[3:00:47] okay sure i'll come you know when he
[3:00:48] comes and brother tim comes and this man
[3:00:51] is looking
[3:00:52] and and brother tim comes out you know
[3:00:54] just small little guy hobbling out like
[3:00:55] this and and and
[3:00:57] and he's got this sign and he says i'm
[3:00:59] tim pruitt and he says no you're not
[3:01:01] i've heard tim pruitt preach he's a big
[3:01:03] guy he's six foot four his powerful
[3:01:05] voices no i'm tim pruitt
[3:01:07] it's like a stumbling block
[3:01:10] you know and so if if we had brother
[3:01:13] branham here everybody would be acting
[3:01:15] like him but god saw dana we'd only have
[3:01:18] the voice so we could still see christ
[3:01:21] in our midst that's the thing we ought
[3:01:23] to look for
[3:01:24] brother branham would even talk about it
[3:01:26] he'd say about moody you know they moody
[3:01:28] was in england and he said he he was
[3:01:30] there he was a great and you know and
[3:01:32] the reporter went up and he just
[3:01:33] recently reported on another great
[3:01:34] animal evangelist and said this man is
[3:01:37] eloquent he's a doctor of divinity he's
[3:01:40] got the best best grammar that i've ever
[3:01:42] heard he holds the people in psychology
[3:01:44] that same reporter went up to see dwight
[3:01:46] moody says i don't see what there's
[3:01:49] anything in him that's attractive to
[3:01:51] anybody
[3:01:52] first thing is he's as ugly as can be
[3:01:55] he says the next thing is he's a
[3:01:56] physical wreck the next thing is he's
[3:01:59] got no education his grammar is the
[3:02:01] poorest i ever heard he's got a wine and
[3:02:03] a wheeze when he's preaching i don't see
[3:02:06] nothing in dwight moody that would
[3:02:07] attract the attention of anybody
[3:02:10] mr moody was brought the article he
[3:02:12] reads and he chuckles and he says
[3:02:14] certainly not they don't come to see me
[3:02:16] they come to see god
[3:02:17] he says
[3:02:19] that's the way we got to look at it it's
[3:02:20] not our outward appearance we gotta we
[3:02:22] gotta keep our focus on christ that's
[3:02:24] the one we want to look to
[3:02:26] paul would even talk in ii thessalonians
[3:02:29] let me as i slowly bring my thoughts
[3:02:31] down
[3:02:32] ii thessalonians chapter two and he's
[3:02:35] he's speaking here and he and he talks a
[3:02:37] little bit
[3:02:38] about his
[3:02:39] what he presented to the people and how
[3:02:42] he presented it so sorry first
[3:02:44] thessalonians chapter two and and he
[3:02:48] i don't know if i want to read all of
[3:02:51] this but
[3:02:52] he would he would say
[3:02:55] verse one you ourselves brother know our
[3:02:57] entrance into you was not
[3:03:00] unto you it was not in vain
[3:03:02] even after we had suffered before and
[3:03:04] were shamefully detreated we were bold
[3:03:07] to speak the gospel with much contention
[3:03:10] with much contention our exhortation was
[3:03:13] not of deceit or uncleanness
[3:03:15] and he says in verse 4 we were allowed
[3:03:17] of god to be put in trust with the
[3:03:19] gospel
[3:03:20] so we speak not as pleasing men
[3:03:24] but god which tries our hearts
[3:03:27] neither at any time used we flattering
[3:03:30] words as you know
[3:03:32] or a coke of covetousness god is our
[3:03:34] witness
[3:03:35] nor sought we glory neither of you or
[3:03:38] yet of others that we might have been
[3:03:41] burdensome as apostles in verse seven
[3:03:43] this is paul
[3:03:44] he says but we were gentle among you
[3:03:48] even as a nurse
[3:03:49] cherisheth her children
[3:03:53] i think if we can recognize the spirit
[3:03:55] of christ he speaks to us he ministers
[3:03:58] to us
[3:03:59] he brings things to us
[3:04:03] paul
[3:04:04] sets an atmosphere
[3:04:06] for all of these things you know i think
[3:04:08] we can bring that right down to our
[3:04:10] homes
[3:04:11] and and we could we could read this in
[3:04:14] different places but
[3:04:15] paul would talk in ephesians chapter 6
[3:04:19] in verse 4 and he says and you fathers
[3:04:23] now he is this is twice in the
[3:04:25] scriptures
[3:04:26] he makes this statement i think it's
[3:04:28] interesting he says
[3:04:29] provoke not your children to wrath
[3:04:33] you think well how would i provoke my
[3:04:35] children to wrath
[3:04:37] by just being a male alpha figure
[3:04:40] you think you know like
[3:04:41] you think well you know all men you know
[3:04:44] we're men we fix things we got this
[3:04:46] under control no we don't always got it
[3:04:47] under control
[3:04:49] you know i had to bring out the
[3:04:50] difference one time in the church
[3:04:51] between being a macho and being a man
[3:04:53] and macho is just a man who doesn't have
[3:04:56] no control over his spirit and it's just
[3:04:57] on
[3:04:58] on on running on testosterone only
[3:05:01] but here paul says you fathers provoke
[3:05:04] not your children to wrath what are you
[3:05:06] doing you're a gardener
[3:05:09] if we could if we could just change our
[3:05:10] mindset and say
[3:05:12] whatever my gift is
[3:05:14] in my home
[3:05:15] let me create an atmosphere if my gift
[3:05:18] is to sing let me create an atmosphere
[3:05:20] if it's to be a song leader if it's to
[3:05:22] be an amen or let me create an
[3:05:24] atmosphere let me create that atmosphere
[3:05:26] who knows what god will do
[3:05:29] and he says
[3:05:31] bring them up in the nurture and the
[3:05:33] admonition of the lord
[3:05:36] he goes on to say in
[3:05:38] colossians chapter 3
[3:05:41] you could read much of this but
[3:05:43] he also talks to the wives in verse 18
[3:05:46] wives submit yourself to your own
[3:05:49] husbands
[3:05:50] as it is fit in the lord
[3:05:53] husbands
[3:05:55] love your wives
[3:05:56] and be not bitter against them you know
[3:06:00] i had to
[3:06:01] tell my wife
[3:06:03] you know you go through marriage and
[3:06:04] it's nice in the beginning it's
[3:06:06] honeymoon it's nice and there's some
[3:06:07] trials and
[3:06:09] i had to tell her i said you know
[3:06:11] a husband is somebody
[3:06:13] who sticks by you
[3:06:15] through all the troubles you wouldn't
[3:06:17] had if you stayed single remember that
[3:06:19] [Laughter]
[3:06:23] so
[3:06:24] she's also said to me you know i i've
[3:06:26] gone to a lot of places with you that i
[3:06:28] never would have gone myself so
[3:06:30] newfoundland is one of them
[3:06:32] so
[3:06:32] [Laughter]
[3:06:34] but he says
[3:06:36] husbands love your wives be not bitter
[3:06:38] against them children obey your parents
[3:06:40] what is all of this talking about an
[3:06:42] atmosphere
[3:06:43] a creating an atmosphere what's
[3:06:46] happening under the seventh seal we're
[3:06:48] just doing our regular things we're
[3:06:49] staying in the word we're not trying to
[3:06:51] be super spiritual we're just loving god
[3:06:54] we're obeying the message and out of
[3:06:56] that comes all kinds of things
[3:06:58] supernatural things that we don't even
[3:06:59] know how did that happen i don't know
[3:07:01] but god just did it
[3:07:04] that's how god does things
[3:07:06] and again he says in verse 21 fathers
[3:07:10] provoke not your children to anger
[3:07:13] lest they be discouraged
[3:07:15] you can take the word of god and use it
[3:07:17] as a hammer
[3:07:18] that's something us hammer meisters have
[3:07:20] had to watch and be careful don't just
[3:07:22] be a hammer meister be be a servant of
[3:07:25] god
[3:07:26] so so this is all part of it i'm gonna
[3:07:29] wind down with these thoughts
[3:07:31] you can go to the seals the sixth seal
[3:07:33] brother bannon would talk
[3:07:35] and he relates
[3:07:37] matthew 24
[3:07:39] and he relates the
[3:07:40] the questions
[3:07:42] turn with me to matthew 24 just as we we
[3:07:45] conclude with this
[3:07:47] matthew 24.
[3:07:54] you know when when i said children
[3:07:57] obey your parents i didn't hear a lot of
[3:07:58] amens from the children
[3:08:01] some moms saying amen you know when when
[3:08:03] it said wives obey your husband's
[3:08:05] husband amen amen
[3:08:07] but i think we're hitting everybody here
[3:08:09] today okay is that right
[3:08:10] we're all submitting ourselves
[3:08:12] matthew 24
[3:08:14] so
[3:08:15] they asked him these three questions
[3:08:16] about the coming of the lord and jesus
[3:08:19] in first verse 4 he answers them now you
[3:08:22] can go in the sixth seal and and brother
[3:08:24] branham will take these verses of jesus
[3:08:26] and relate them to all of the seals
[3:08:29] he'll relate
[3:08:30] you know chapters
[3:08:31] verses 4 and 5 to the first seal i think
[3:08:33] five and six if you're not careful he
[3:08:36] actually mixes the verses up in one
[3:08:37] thing but if you follow it through and
[3:08:38] look in your bible it actually all works
[3:08:41] and so it it goes and he relates it to
[3:08:44] under that writer come and see and and
[3:08:46] then they'll be you know a black horse
[3:08:48] rider and with this and this
[3:08:50] but now
[3:08:51] the time of the seventh seal
[3:08:54] there is something in the seventh seal
[3:08:56] there's it's omitted like there's
[3:08:58] silence in heaven there's nothing given
[3:09:00] but if you read matthew 24 you know
[3:09:03] because it actually talks about the
[3:09:05] parable of the fig tree and all of these
[3:09:07] things
[3:09:08] and then it goes into
[3:09:10] what emulates luke 17 30 how it says
[3:09:13] that the days of noah you know the flood
[3:09:15] will happen
[3:09:17] now if you read from verse 40 down to
[3:09:19] verse 51
[3:09:21] and if you really take it
[3:09:23] and if you want to take it and say this
[3:09:24] is the conditions at the coming of the
[3:09:26] lord and it and it would just talk about
[3:09:28] everyday life it says here's two in the
[3:09:31] field one will be taken one left two
[3:09:33] women grinding one taken one left and
[3:09:36] then it says watch therefore you don't
[3:09:38] know the hour you don't know how this is
[3:09:40] going to turn out you don't know how
[3:09:41] it's going to happen but god's going to
[3:09:43] do it and we're going to be doing
[3:09:44] regular things
[3:09:46] so he's saying now some you know if the
[3:09:48] goodman of house would know be ready and
[3:09:51] it says in verse 45 be a faithful and
[3:09:53] wise servant
[3:09:55] you know and verse 46 blessed is that
[3:09:58] servant and you know he that's listening
[3:10:01] you know i'll make him a ruler over
[3:10:02] things verse 47 verse 48 but if he says
[3:10:05] the lord delays his coming and he begins
[3:10:08] in verse 49 to smite his fellow servants
[3:10:10] the lord will come in a day he's not
[3:10:12] looking for him so it sets the
[3:10:14] conditions
[3:10:15] so it's telling you conduct your lives
[3:10:18] in the right way you don't know when
[3:10:19] this is going to manifest you don't know
[3:10:21] when this is going to be fulfilled
[3:10:24] but i believe as we get closer he says
[3:10:26] you don't know the day or the hour i
[3:10:27] think we can see the season
[3:10:29] listen i'm i really am closing now and
[3:10:32] and and you look at all the things that
[3:10:34] are happening around us
[3:10:36] we've got roles to follow we've got
[3:10:38] different things i could take time some
[3:10:39] of these i would leave to the
[3:10:42] the pastors and and and those that labor
[3:10:44] in the church to take and i think you've
[3:10:46] had some of that
[3:10:48] there's there's many things we could
[3:10:49] talk about upbringings you know you look
[3:10:51] at in the bible brother brahm talks
[3:10:53] about david and he says david
[3:10:55] david he he
[3:10:57] how did he get david get where david got
[3:10:59] he says well his father jesse
[3:11:01] read him stories at night
[3:11:03] about the bible and things
[3:11:06] and that produced a david you know my
[3:11:08] mother
[3:11:09] god bless her she she didn't have an
[3:11:10] easy life but
[3:11:12] she i caused her much grief she said i
[3:11:14] was the furthest away
[3:11:16] but she prayed for all of us as kids
[3:11:18] and when she saw me turn god was
[3:11:20] gracious
[3:11:21] and and gave her a son that that's
[3:11:23] laboring for god and i say that because
[3:11:25] my pride would say no no you didn't you
[3:11:28] didn't do that well god called me i know
[3:11:30] that but
[3:11:31] i i had too much pride to say she was
[3:11:34] part of that but god gave that to her
[3:11:35] just as a desire
[3:11:37] listen how brother branham talks just as
[3:11:39] i use this
[3:11:41] in the in the church age
[3:11:43] book he talks about i know your works i
[3:11:46] know your labor revelations two verse
[3:11:48] two and
[3:11:49] he says
[3:11:51] how you've borne you've had patience for
[3:11:53] my name's sake
[3:11:54] and then he makes this commentary how
[3:11:57] beautifully the savior praises and
[3:11:59] commands his children
[3:12:01] he takes full account
[3:12:03] of their fine spiritual attitudes and
[3:12:06] behavior
[3:12:07] he knows there's a weakness among them
[3:12:10] but he doesn't cry out against it isn't
[3:12:13] that just like the lord
[3:12:15] he knows how to encourage us in the
[3:12:18] right matters and discourage us in the
[3:12:22] wrong matters
[3:12:23] and then he says
[3:12:25] we could learn a good lesson right here
[3:12:29] in running the church and our families
[3:12:32] we could learn a good lesson in that god
[3:12:35] deals with each of us
[3:12:36] in exactly this way
[3:12:39] don't ever be discouraged saint of god
[3:12:42] for god is not ungracious to forget your
[3:12:45] labors of love
[3:12:46] whatever we do even giving a cup of cold
[3:12:49] water to someone it has a reward and a
[3:12:52] blessing of god
[3:12:54] let's be good gardeners
[3:12:55] let's be husbandman i didn't get into
[3:12:58] timothy and how he says the husbandmen
[3:12:59] must be
[3:13:00] first partaker
[3:13:02] we need to live what we believe what we
[3:13:04] talk about
[3:13:06] let's have the musicians come
[3:13:08] and work we'll close
[3:13:10] you know christ is revealed in every
[3:13:12] type in the bible
[3:13:14] and if we can catch the bible and the
[3:13:17] attitude thereof
[3:13:19] uh i i believe it's it's
[3:13:22] there's things that we are designed to
[3:13:24] catch and see that others don't catch
[3:13:26] and see
[3:13:27] because we are part of him
[3:13:29] we are recipients we're part of what
[3:13:31] what he would want
