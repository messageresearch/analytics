that [Music] Hey [Music] hallelujah bye [Music] Thank You Lord hallelujah [Music] so that [Music] amen blessed I'm just gonna say a few words first so as you know I've been living alone since January it has been a very interesting experience so it's just really good to see how God works in in individuals like individual lives and where the scripture says where he knows every single like piece of our here and showing that he really cares and I feel that God has really been working on me just strengthening me living by myself and I've just learned a lot just meaning like a huge learning curve being the baby of the family sometimes you know things are done for you and I have to do everything by yourself and so when Joshua was living with me he liked it a lot he did like everything basically and so then he left and then I was like I yeah I had to do everything that he had to do so that included dealing with the car which I never knew how to open like the front of the car for some reason and just little small things like putting water in the car had no idea how to do that either I was like on the phone with my brother like how do you open the front of the car and yet to give me instructions and we're the water thing went and just crazy and like every and I think like um in the first couple of weeks I think what God wanted to do he wanted like everything to go wrong so that I learned really fast and everything went wrong so like it was literally one thing after the other like the car something wrong with the car and in the printer falls apart and this is falling apart and it was just one thing after the other so I had to learn like every single day and in the snow fell and then I looked at the window and realized I had to shovel so it was my first time picking up a shovel it was a great experience but it wasn't actually too bad so I've really learned a lot and I thank God for that and I actually want to give a special special thanks to her the mark so what happened was obviously everything was going wrong and after all these years of living in st. John's the door decided to jam for some reason I came back home at like 10:15 after work and the door just didn't want to open so I literally did everything I called the guy from downstairs in the basement to help me and he did everything and yet to jump onto the dick to see if the sliding door was opened and that didn't work I went to my next-door neighbors and they weren't there I went to my other next-door neighbors and they didn't want to come out so anyways so lastly I called brother Marc because I thought that I was gonna maybe sleep over there and brother Marc called the locksmith and we figured out after like a good hour I think he was there so like maybe 11:30 or later and I just want to say special thanks to him just to kind of refer back to brother Steve some sermon yesterday about brotherly kindness and the warmth of the church and brother Marc was literally on his knees and hands like cuz we pick me we've we got into the door afterwards but he was literally on his hands and knees taking out my lock at like 11:00 p.m. on a Saturday night you know tomorrow's church and I just really want to thank more than work for that and just to kind of like show the brotherly kindness and love that we have so thank you okay so this is the song that we were actually supposed to sing with a B sorry Jenna so when Abby left her last Sunday we were supposed to sing this but I just had morning drama living alone again and so we weren't able to do that so shout-out to Abby and yeah we gonna the girls actually chose the song so we're gonna sing the song it's very

you musicians that'll be all I'd like to ask you for you if you would just take your Bibles with me before we read let's uh let's a word of Prayer if you would let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this morning you thank you for your boot of a beautiful day we thank you for our friends and our family that we have the privilege of coming to church with and the freedom to do so and nor just these brief moments we give back into your hands we ask that you would do with them as you please we ask that your perfect will would be done and we give you that opportunity we give you the preeminence to do so we ask that you would be with us this morning we love you and we thank you for all that you do and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do we pray amen amen Romans chapter 12 again if you would like to turn there once more and as we read last night we read in the beginning of the week or of the services we began the first chapter which is probably the portion that we're most familiar with and Paul begins to explain to the Romans what their part is to play and this is just one portion in scripture where he talks about what a Christian should be and what he should do and he talks in about service and in verses 3 and down and then he begins to talk to the church and those within the body of believers and then in verse 17 he says this and he changes and if you'll notice here as we read in verse 17 recompense no man evil for evil and provide things honest in the sight of all men so he changes his terminology here because before he says B of 1 in verse 16 be of the same mind one toward another so this is one toward another those that are within the body of Christ say this to those that are brethren and sojourners along with you and then in verse 17 he says to all men this is what you must do so this is not just to one toward another this is to all the men those that are within and those that are without reading verse 17 again recompense no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lies with lieth in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head and similarly to verse 9 he says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good you can have your seats may the Lord bless the reading his word I appreciated the specials this morning I really I really enjoyed singing I can't sing my way out of a cardboard box but I love to hear people who can sing and sister Sarah sang one time before I preached at one church and the pastor got up after she sang and he said well if he has her sing before and after he preaches people might think he is pretty good so that's my strategy you know I'm gonna throw her out there and kind of prepare the way and people think oh he's a good preacher but it's really just my wife but and I'm appreciate her being with me like I said before and very thankful for her and her life and her testimony and the more and more I get to know her the more and more I realized how just an amazing Christian she is I hope we can all say the same about our spouses and I think we should be able to I think we should strive to to work towards that and I appreciated the song a sister Priscilla sang and appreciated all the specials that song that sister Priscilla sang my mother when she graduated from university she graduated from a private university as Christian and they actually sang that song at the graduation believe it or not it's kind of an odd place to hear that song at a university graduation but they sang it and it brought the house down it really did so then we our choir at the church sang it and it when you get believers singing it's even that more more powerful I believe and it really brought the house down that that song means a lot to me it just gets my blood pumping I really really like that song so I enjoyed it we really appreciate those who can sing and those who bring our hearts into an attitude of worship and open the hearts up and a lot of times just from the things that we do and all the responsibilities that we have are our hearts need to be opened up even as believers they really do so that's the purpose of a singing and of that I'm very thankful to have been here with you this weekend and I love each and every one of you very much and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to be able to speak to and I hope that in some way I've been a help and I hope you know I'm just gonna I've been just myself and I'll just say what's on my heart and the way that I see it sometimes I see it come a little bit in it from a different angle it's the same scripture what we see it from a different different perspective I guess that can really help but I hope it was a help to somebody and we're also drainers in the faith and you know no matter where you are or what the circumstances are he's the same God it's the same anointing and I've enjoyed the presence of the Lord here and I believe he has been here not I think that's in large part due to you it's nothing necessarily that I've done and as a minister comes you know when you have a great anointing in a powerful service many times it's not it's not necessarily the minister Manohar tear you apart and really drive that some are just real quiet and to the point and just line by line and teachers and ministers we have all kinds and sometimes some ministers some ministries will just lay this the the stepping stones to have a powerful service so everybody preaches in their own way but I believe that you you are the the reason that the atmosphere is so sweet in this church and I'm very very thankful to have been able to experience it with you I really am so we'll be praying for you and and again I'm thankful for the opportunity to be here we see here in Romans if we could just get back and jump right into it as I said before the Apostle Paul he's writing to the Romans which are a very peculiar group of people because they were it was the superpower of the world so their mindsets and their attitudes were in some respects very similar to ours because they had the the amenities and the technology in the society that was above anything else in the world so the way that they thought about things in that the way that they did did things is is in large part similar to modern culture in some ways not always and Paul he begins to write here in the first chapter and he talks about service like we talked about last night and the portion of faith that he gives you and then he talks about the Christian and those within and he talks about those that are preferring one another and as I said before the same mind one toward another so he's saying amongst yourselves this is how you must act and he says that between 9 and in verse 16 and he begins to say that and he we know that that the purpose of God was to bring us into fellowship one with another but not just one with another but with within to fellowship with him so as we come into harmony with him there is a unity that we have together in the Spirit of God so the harmony that God intended to bring that that God had at the very beginning of time that's what we're going back to and it overlaps now right among us together so now you are the carriers of the Lord Jesus Christ now you are where heaven and earth overlaps that unity that we are coming into and that we feel that we have is is is is coming together all according to the plan and purpose of God the Satan has a purpose as well and because of his purpose all of all of the the earth and in at the fall of time it became Satan's Dominion because man forfeited it they gave it up and they gave it to Satan himself and God just stepped back from the earth although it is his footstool and it is his to do with as he pleased he allowed Satan to have the the Dominion of the earth which was at one point gods and so it becomes Satan's own Eden and he's had 6,000 years to create it as brother Branham says in in the service Satan's Eden so he's had that long to to create it into the way that he wants it to go Satan as God has allowed it to do certain things and he has allowed Satan to do that for his own purpose all the while thinking that Satan is working according to his plan and Satan knows exactly what's going on and as the scripture says we are not unaware of what Satan is doing in Corinthians so that being the case and since the purpose of God is to bring us back into fellowship he brought us into what we call the church and Jesus to Peter he says the first time to Peter he says upon this rock of Revelation I will build my church so there he singles out his church as the followers of of Christ not a particular group of people or a faction or a sect of people he says my church is built upon the revelation of who I am and so when you step into that church you're no longer just associated with a building or a particular group of people or an association with the doctrine you transcend that into the kingdom of God so you are no longer citizens of this world you are citizens of that kingdom and you are made an ambassador while you are here and so we are we are transfer you're lifted into that church and that is the Church of the Living God so you can you can pick yourself up and go to to Korea or China or Africa or wherever you want to go and it'll be the exact same Church of the Living God the exact same spirit the cultures are entirely different there's some cultures where they sing brother Jonah are talking about that before you go to Dubai or sharjah in that originates from Pakistan because they were all Pakistanis but they have a certain way of worshipping and they worship with a tabla drum so they don't really start worshiping until the tabla drummer comes so and only when he comes do they get the rhythm and they start going and everybody starts singing and then that's when they start to really worship but if they had this musician they they had this kind of instrument setup there they'd be they'd be they wouldn't know what to do they wouldn't feel comfortable so they have to have they have their own kind of worship which is their own kind of culture but the Holy Spirit transcends cultural barriers so regardless of where you are it's the same spirit so Paul then sets in order because we are people and we are fallen people sinners saved by grace he has to set it in order how we must treat each other so regardless of if you're in Korea or Africa or America or Canada wherever you are there's certain characteristics that a believer has to have to treat one another and he says not to to accept the diversity that is in Christ and diversity does not mean a diversity of principles or or of character or behavior the character is is our guideline of our character is by the Word of God so what he's bringing us into fellowship he brings us into fellowship with upon the basis of the Word of God and the same holy spirit regardless of what culture it is acts only on the basis of the Word of God and that's how we find the unity of the faith and that is the Church of God it's not the Church of God as it's just this building or just that building or just this group or just that minister or just that preacher or just that circuit of churches or just that fellowship of people because there's certain circuits in the message certain people who only fellowship with certain people that's the Church of God one that is not of this world but is of his kingdom and so while we are here we must know how to act with each other there's certain an order that is set of how we operate and how we how we proceed and how we treat each other and that is is based solely upon the character of Jesus Christ and as we grow in faith in a knowledge and in grace we learn how to better treat each other that's a lifelong that's a lifelong pursuit it's not as soon as you come into the church you have everything you need to know it's not you're not given a guideline of rules of this is what you must do and this is much what you must do you start reading your Bible and under the Neath the the anointing and like we were talking about last night the sovereignty of the local church we are set in order and then as the Holy Spirit has the freedom to move in the order of the church then we have the ability to - to operate as the Lord leads us each one of us he in the diversity that we all live our lives with he has the ability to lead us and to guide us according to his purpose because nothing is is-is-is in inline with our own idea or our own purpose it we all come into under subjection to the purpose of God the Bible says where there is no vision the people perish so you have to have a vision you have to have a vision any a successful business has to have a mission statement they have to have a purpose for being and it has to be simply stated and clearly stated in the vision that we have today is the message of the hour that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's alive and he can he can live inside of you the veil has been torn and you can walk right into the Holy of Holies and have fellowship with him and that's the vision that we are all coming in alignment with that's the the unity that we find inside the Church of God but we live in the world we live in a fallen world we still live in Satan's Eden we live in a place that is so vastly different from what we find in the scripture or what a believer should be that that's a hard thing to accomplish to live in the midst of Satan's Eden so Paul he shifts and he says now to all men not just amongst one another but to all men this is what you must do so we have the church within and the church within is not just the building the church within is the kingdom of God it's it's Christ living in you that's the church within but we have the world without if we have this mentality or the idea that this church is the only thing that there is then we will be out of a line with the kingdom of God because we'll just have the association with the doctrine and the teaching and in assimilate into a set of rules without the Holy Spirit leading us and if the Holy Spirit isn't leading us then we will come into alignment with his purpose for our lives and being the permissive will of God we become his deity in flesh in measure brother Branham says in 1961 a true sign that's overlooked he says God is not divided denominations divide the churches but not God and once said are you a Christian I'm a Baptist said that's no more than saying he's a pig and you say you I'm a believer I'm in a message church you could equally say the same that's no more than saying you're a pig that kind of rubs a little little harsh but it's the truth you say well I'm a part of a message church I go to a message Church that's no more than saying that you're a pig that's no more than saying that you're a Baptist or you're a Methodist or you're a Catholic I'm a message believer I go I've been in a message church all my life I cut my teeth on the on the edge of the eye I've never ever understood that statement I've never cut my teeth on a Pew but whatever I grew up doing it that's no more than saying I'm a I'm a Baptist or a Catholic it's it's no more the same just because you say you're in the message that doesn't mean that you believe it it doesn't mean that you know what it's all about as many churches who are classified as message churches and within in our community within 30 to 40 miles of our church a 40 mile radius around our church there's 32 message churches 32 now if you want to be a polygamist if you want to have two wives there's a church for it if you want to have if you want to be a triple married deacon there's a church for it if you want to be if you want to live any kind of a life and then in and in basically dress like the world there's some churches around the area you meet them in a restaurant you can't tell the Baptist from the from the message believers so if you want to live like that then there's a church for if you want to believe the message in believe brother branham's your pastor there's a church for it there's all kinds of churches around where we're at you can take your pick whatever kind of believer you want to be you can be it you can have your pick 32 just because you say you're in the message it doesn't mean that you're in the message you understand he says there's all different kinds of things that you can say but that doesn't make you and this is the principle that brother Branham was consistent with throughout his ministry he says you can and again he was in a different time and there were no message churches as in a message community like we experienced today but yet he was trying to get this principle across that it's not just mere association with the type of church that makes you a believer he said there's three kinds of believers in every church he said there's a make believer there's an unbeliever and there's the believer so he said you have to make sure that you are not just going to this church you are a part of his church so he separates it's it's Christ in you the hope of glory you have to be associated with that church and only then when you have that association and you have that correct understanding of it then you can be a proper member of a local Assembly then the local Assembly can thrive then it can become all that God wants it to be and then the Holy Spirit has the preeminence to move so that he can move in on the individual lives of the people in their time of life he says well that's no more than being a pig again to God I say if you're a Christian to be a Christian you must be christ-like tabernac tabernacling deity in you with the Holy Ghost like it fell on the day of Pentecost this is not some emotion but I mean a real Pentecost see your tabernacling deity inside of you Ephesians in Ephesians chapter 2 it says you have a body fitly joined together you have become the habitation of God through the spirit so now we Tabernacle deity in flesh and we become deity in flesh because we we have him on the inside of us that part of us that was eternal has met the Holy Spirit and the two have become one and we are sealed into Christ so it is now no longer Christ out there it's Christ in me the hope of glory heaven and earth become one again that's how that happens is because he comes down inside of you now notice he says in in 1965 he says that's where we are we have to become we have to become from mortal beings from time beings to eternal beings and when the Word of God lit our souls and we become sons and daughters of God with the attributes in the gene of God in us to be sons and daughters of the Father God in heaven crying Abba Father my God my God it's the gene of God in us so that little gene of God is what the Holy Spirit moves over and quickens to life he says a year before that now God in us see the sons of God in the adoption that Christ come to do to redeem God's attributes as he did at the beginning all that God poured into Christ he poured into his church everything that God was the father he poured into Christ I wonder how many times it's been said from this pulpit every everything that the father was was poured into Christ and he became that and everything that Christ was he poured into his church so that you become Christ in flesh in measure so you don't have the the absolute that Christ was Christ was everything in one but when you step into Christ you become that that same seed in measure you have the same Authority in measure so you have the same the same attributes and the same things that God was he was in you and he is in you now brother branham he says this and keep in mind that the bride doesn't have any power in themselves they have the authority to claim the power that is inside them they have the authority to claim the power of God that abides inside of them now keep this and keep this in mind as we read in 1959 he's talking about Hattie right and he's explaining uh it's his questions and answers on the Holy Ghost and he begins to explain exactly what Hattie Wright was was asking for and he said that's right that's what she should have asked for he says Jesus said say to this mountain and and you've heard about what's been taken place in that ministry that we're entering into and we're way up way up the road now and soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye to go out he says once we have the Harmony moving through the church and they know who they are the rapture will take place so you see the importance of the unity in in Christ Church that he's trying to bring us into and that's what I see is I visit different churches they're coming into a unity it's the same theme as the ministry preaches all over the world and you listen to them there's a common theme that you can pick up and we're all moving into a unity that is of God not of this world it's not just the sociation it's the unity of Christ Church and he says the he says will go out but don't worry he says it'll be there the rapture he says it'll be there and when the power of hit of this church rises it'll bring its brethren the power of that church rises will bring its brethren the power of that church will bring the other brethren and then there'll be a general resurrection he says and that's what we're looking forward to he says the voice within the bride will bring on the resurrection he says because God is inside of them and what God did is he subjected himself to the law that was overriding him the promise that was there so when Jesus was would died on the cross like we said on Friday night he submitted himself to the the to the authority of the word he submitted himself by his own authority into the power of the world is a better way of saying it so with the authority that he had he had the ability and the power to raise up and to lay down but yet with the authority that he has he subjected himself and surrendered himself to the law that was abiding over it and to the Word of God that we was subjected to and that's what rose him again so by the bride coming into the unity of the faith by the authority that they have inside of them they willingly subject himself to the law of God to the Word of God by grace because we're not under a dispensation of law but there is a law that abides over the Word of God you understand it brings it to pass so by grace we submit ourselves to the law of God and that's what will raise us up - and we're already quickened with him we are waiting for our resurrection but the voice within the bride by submitting themselves to the Holy Spirit is what will bring on that resurrection it's not that you call for it or that anybody knows what happened what what's happening we submit ourselves to the to the Holy Spirit because he is the only one that knows the time and when that time comes we'll go the voice within the bride is what brings that on you are what brings that on by submitting yourself to the Holy Spirit therefore in Ephesians 2 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and our bill upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom ye are also together for a habitation of God through the spirit because of all of these these things you are no longer strangers and foreigners but your fellow citizens are the Saints I find it amazing that it's it's no longer Jesus on the earth but it's you and me tabernacling deity and because of that we know through the the the message that the church becomes as it were the moon and in Christ is the Sun and the moon is a reflection of the light that shines on it and so you have the earth and you have the Sun and you have the moon it's a very simple analogy and I'm thankful for the simplicity of it the the church is the only light that those without will see that those on the earth will see now remember now I'm not talking about just the association of the doctrine just the church we've come beyond that it's Christ Church it's a kingdom that you're born into so if you were to be plucked up and go to another church it's that you're still a member of God but but Eagles come where the carcass is that's why you find a pastor that that you know where he stands and you believe in what he's preaching and there you abide and he's it's it's a most simple analogy the world is the only light that you that they will ever see you are the only light that the world will ever see and you are simply a reflection of the light that is inside of you and brother Branham took it a step further and he says it's it's not just a shimmering he says you're glowing with the light so he says you as a person are glowing with the light and the analogy you are reflecting the light onto the earth in the evening time so we know that window gets into an evening place and the world becomes dark and the ages get darker and darker and darker as they go on you are the only thing that the world will see so you understand even from that the importance of not just having an association with a doctrine or the church or a church or a personality or a a man as many people who just they're associated with a man they are associated with it with the man of the church and that's that's a dominating spirit over the church and they're associated with that that's all they know and they very well are not in the kingdom of God they're just associating with the church the importance of you realizing that you're of a different Kingdom is the only way and in you stepping into that is the only way that you can be an adequate reflection an adequate reflection of the Sun so the only thing that they will see is is you in your proper place and the only way that you can come into that is when you have a proper understanding and a correct understanding of marriage in divorce so you have to understand marriage in divorce in order to to realize that you are coming into your place the thing that happens in marriage in divorce and to understand the church ages you have to have an understanding of marriage in divorce marriage and divorce is is that Christ is in his place and the man is in his place underneath Christ and then the woman is also in under under a covenant to Christ as well as to her husband so you know and what that says in that there's there's a lot of things you know that that comes as a result of that a lot along of wrong doctrine that comes as a result of that a woman's place is not a a man's place is not just to have the woman in subjection to him that's not that's not necessarily the way that's that's correct but that's that that's an imbalanced idea when the man says that the woman has to be under subjection to him the way that it properly works is that the man comes under subjection to Christ because Christ is all in his place Christ never wavers from his place so when we come under subjection to Christ as men then when we are abiding in that place then the woman can come into her place naturally it's not that the man dominates what the place of the woman is it's the man must get into his place in Christ only then can the woman adequately naturally assume her place it's when it's mixed up that's when you have marriage trouble that's when you have trouble with your spouse so the man must be in his place and he must abide there only when the man is in his place in the hole and in the marriage can can the woman come in and just naturally fit into that and it just fits right and there's no longer tension and she doesn't feel out of place or out of sorts or like something is is it's overriding her she just steps into that place and she blossoms like a woman should only when the man is in his place and when that is out of order I have little respect for a man that is out of order and in dominates the place that a woman should be that woman needs to be right there brother Branham said when he says a woman should be in the kitchen traditionally that's naturally where her place was that is where her places is because she is a care giver of the home in the sense that she can care for the home like a man never never will be able to care for the home if the if the world was full of men global global warming would have been a lot faster coming nothing even be more need be said about that if men if it was only men nothing can care for something like a woman can continually take care of something so when she naturally comes into her place he's saying she needs to just abide in where she where she fits were her places where her personality is where her nature is a man and a woman are different they're not the same so in culture and as we have businesses and all these different things we all would they try to say well a woman is no different than man the pace should be the same the things like that well I agree that the pace should be the same and I agree that they should have the same respect that men have but they are not the same a man is different than a woman and a woman is different than a man and anybody who that's an absolute of the world that that is an absolute truth that a woman is different than a man they are under the they have a similar likes and dislikes and things like that but they are the same the world chooses not to look at that look at our absolute as an absolute yet they live by an absolute men and women are different so they override their own absolute and say well no they're the same so they override common sense and in just natural tendencies and they override that with their own thinking so not only are they overriding God by their own thinking they're overriding their own absolutes by their own thinking people uh then and that's that's that's that's the way it is only when the man is in his place can the woman naturally assume her place wherever it would be wherever she would find it to be that's up to us up to God it's the exact same way Christ is in his place the church in and he is always in his place the church can naturally then come into a her place because he is always in his place there's no variance as to where he is so the church is not wondering well what do we do and where we are the church is is is coming unto unto headship into him because he is always in his place the bride can naturally assume that therefore can you have an adequate reflection to the world because the churches in her place in Matthew chapter 5 and 14 he says you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid cabot tower cannot be hid from from many places in st. john's it's up there on the hill and it's not coming down it hasn't been hasn't come down a long time if it's set up on a hill it's always there so he says now you are the light of the world you are HID a city on a hill neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house therefore let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you see works without faith is dead so your works express your faith it's when you do the works first that you are trying to assimilate into the works that it's mixed up but you have to have a work to display which exemplifies your faith it shows your faith so in order to adequately express your faith there must be a work there there has to be something there and so your works is what displays the glory of God to those that are without to those that are not only around you but to those that are without to see Christ working is to show forth your good works and he says that you may glorify your father which is in heaven so in order to be an ambassador you must show forth your good works and that comes from being in your proper place as the bride of Jesus Christ so it's not a church out of order the the head the male is in his place so as the church comes into alignment of it then you can be up then you are a part of that kingdom of God you're not only made a bet church member in your local church but you're also made a light by your good works you glorify the father to those that are without and you only do that when you come into alignment with the head when you come into the unity of the faith and when you are in alignment with Christ alone and if you try to take it if you haven't mixed up and you try to take the the legality of the religion to the outside world then you are no different than the Catholics you are no different than the Baptist you are no different than the Methodists you're just bringing people into a religion you're bringing and assimilating them into the religion so in order to be an adequate expression of Christ and glorify the Father which is in heaven you must be the city on the hill an adequate reflection and you can only be that unless if you are in line with Christ when Paul was preaching he understood and he had the the education of the Greeks he had the knowledge of the Greeks and he had the Roman citizenship and he understood Roman thinking but he was born a Jew so he was a Jewish man with a Greek understanding and in education understanding the citizen and being interacting with Romans being there's a citizen of the of the country and in in in all of that the Hebrews as Jews had an understanding of what light was they understood that God was light and they understood in the beginning there was light and the light shone forth and the light is what created and that to be light in in in darkness and they had a revelation of that God was light they understood that they understood that the Messiah would be light so they had this understanding in this revelation that God is light the Greeks understood and they had their ideals in knowledge they were obsessed with knowledge and understanding and in philosophizing and in debating and just talking back and forth and and growing in their knowledge and the Romans were obsessed with glory they said for the glory of Rome that we do this and they would conquer everything so here's Paul with with a Jewish background a Roman citizen and in a Greek education and he comes and he says in 2nd Corinthians 4:6 and he brings them these all of these abstractions because the like I said the Jews had the idea and the understanding and the conception and the revelation of light and that was an abstraction to them because they were looking for that in the Messiah so they had that abstraction there and then they had the the the the the Greeks they looked to knowledge and they had their ideology and had their understanding and abstraction is is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events so it's it's it's it's the idea of the thing rather than the event of the thing or the actual reality of the thing so the Greeks understood the the the the abstraction of knowledge and all that they knew and all that they could bring to the table and then the the Romans had the idea of glory that they sought after and their culture was obsessed with it and then Paul comes along and he understands all of these different abstractions he understands all of these different ideas that are out there in the world and he understands how how each one of them are coming so he comes in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 6 and he says for God who hath commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so he brings together the idea of light in the glory of Rome and the knowledge of the Greeks and he brings it together and he takes the abstractions and he brings it down into the very embodiment of the Lord Jesus Christ in the life of a believer so he says for for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has sinned in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so he brings all of these things and he brings them down into an abstraction - an embodiment of the Lord Jesus Christ in the life of a believer the embodiment is a tangible or visible form of an idea the quality or feeling he brings the abstraction - an embodiment of the Lord Jesus Christ as the moon reflects the light of the Sun they are the embodiment of the Sun and then they reflect that on to the earth we know in in 1st Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and in the Greek that's a paraparesis I believe it is which means it's an accepted or a a group that has an acquisition on it it's it's a it's a peculiar group it's it's set aside for a particular service so you're a peculiar people you're an odd people because you're a royal priesthood so he's saying you are a peculiar people because you are part of the kingdom of God so regardless of what church you go to or where you are you are a peculiar you are a peculiarity because of what you are because of the embodiment that you have of the Lord Jesus Christ inside of you you are an oddity because this is not God's Dominion man forfeited it so you are in the midst of Satan's Dominion and you are an oddity because you are an embodiment of the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of Satan's Dominion so you are you that is why you are the light of God is because you are an oddity you are a possessed people by God he has set you apart and he has put you in his in his presence and you walk around an ambassador to that Kingdom in the midst of Satan's Eden a little while ago we teach a Sunday School class and we have we have a couple different Sunday School classes my mother-in-law teaches the once and then there's other sisters that teach the the younger kids and then sister Sarah and I teach the twelve to seventeen year olds and that's um that's almost a bigger a bigger burden than evangelism to me because those kids are going to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives so the choices that they make between twelve and seventeen determine the outcome of eighteen and beyond so that to me is a more greater responsibility than even evangelism is because the decisions that they will make will determine the outcomes of their lives they'll either you know wine themselves up in with debt above their eyeballs you know coming out of college or they can make good decisions now and prepare for those things Jesus talked about money more than he did about anything else money is important because if you cannot be faithful with what he's given you then you won't be faithful and spiritual things so how you handle your resources that you have in large part determines how you will handle what God has given you and that is not of a matter of opinion that is not a something that somebody thinks that's what Jesus said he said if you're not faithful in Mammon and how can you be faithful in greater things so in if you go back then in the Old Testament you'll see the theme of Solomon and even David and then in the in the New Testament and even Jesus he says you you take care of the things that you've got you you you you you take care of the possesses possessions that you have you you look well on the face of your flocks you do all these things a the borrower is servant to the lender and all of these different things is it a sin to be a borrower no but the borrower is servant to the lender so you see it's not a heaven in her or hell issue but those are principles that determine the kind of character that's in you and those principles are set forth in the Word of God for us to follow not just to look aside because they're unconsecrated to us they may be seemingly inconsequential to you but they are not to God they may be seemingly inconsequential to traditional beliefs but they are not to God how you handle your money is extremely important and that's a we go over that stuff in that Sunday School class because I'd rather than wake up in ten years and have a not be saddled with debt and not be a servant to the lender I'd rather let's let's figure out how to do this right and see if we can do it in a good way and wake up and not be a servant who wants to be a servant so let's figure out how to do it when we're young anyways I walked in and I said to them or III what I did is I dressed up as a I did my best impersonation of a biker and it was a pretty sorry one but I did my best impersonation so I put on a little goatee and I had a bikers jacket on and I had a hat and some sunglasses and everything and sister Sarah introduced introduced Bob Shu Mizzou to the class so Bob comes in and he sits down he's a biker you know and he sees there was me and and I just began to ask them questions about what they believed and this was a complete surprise to them and even in that setting even in that setting they were getting nervous they were getting really nervous and it was it was out of their comfort zone it was me it was their Sunday school teacher dressed up as a biker but I win and I sat down right in front of him and I said so what do you guys believe and they say well we you know we believe in in the message what's the message and said well the message is you know Jesus Christ revealed who's Jesus Christ and when what is what is revealed mean like what does that mean so I mean I was really trying to stick it to them and trying to guide the conversation they did really well they did really well but even in that setting they got nervous there was something in them that just it's it's hard to do that it's really hard to do that it puts you out of your comfort zone when you interact with those that are without because your comfort zone is with Christ that's where you that's where you draw from the fountain is when you are with Christ so when we are here we draw from the fountain we refill ourselves we enjoy the presence of God we get a refreshing of the presence of God now he said he will never leave you nor forsake you but you don't get the same feeling all the time you understand God can come to you but then there's other times when you're just abiding and you're just you're just going throughout your life and when you come across something that is not in harmony with you there is a tension there because they are underneath the Dominion of Satan the scripture says as you or sometimes partakers of sin you are partakers of that life so now you have been transplanted into the Church of the Living God not just when you are in this building you are the Church of God at all times you're the Church of God wherever you are so you are now the Church of God and you're in the midst of Satan's Dominion so there is tension because there of that Kingdom and you are of a different Kingdom that happens all throughout the day you get you get a in Satan even tries to seep it into the very inner workings of your home you try to get in through your marriage you try to get in through your friends you're through the internet cable through a satellite or through a TV or through whatever he can he'll try to get in there and seep it in because that's Satan's purpose is to try to for the purpose of God and the purpose of God is for him to bring us unto fellowship with him so then obviously there's a disunity between us and the world so I dressed up as Bob shew Mizzou and they got a sense and I wanted them to do that because better they do it there than out in the world better better that in discomfort is there than out in the world so when they get out in the world and someone confronts them about their faith they can adequately describe it and they're used to being out of their comfort zone because when you're trying to share something that was soo natural for you it becomes almost impossible and I what I did is I rode them with question after question after question after question and eventually that one of them one of the little boys said well we believe that God has put you here for us to speak to you I was like wow speak on and then a little bit later after I began to press questions against them they said well you need to go talk to the Deacons and I said well you just said that I got God put me here in front of you so why are you sending me to them and they were like ah so they it was a it was a great conversation but the Lord will put you in front of somebody and better you you you you learn how to get out of your to exist outside of your comfort zone which is in the presence of God now the presence of God is always with you because the pillar of fire was always with the Israelites they just looked to the pillar of fire everything that they were supposed to do they follow the leading of the Holy Spirit because sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit so when you subject yourself to the Holy Spirit at all times and you abide with him his presence will be there although you may not feel like it and you may feel like you're out of your comfort zone which you are because you're in the midst of Satan's Eden with those who are in the kingdom of Satan's Eden so there in His Church and you're in God's church the thing that I'm trying to get across to you this morning is that separation does not imply isolation although the two are synonyms isolation is to pick up and isolate from others to remain apart from others to separate to touch not anything anything else to maintain purity that's what isolation is separation is to go in different directions separation is - is is different or viewed or formed as different to sever and Association to set aside for a special purpose so although the two are are are synonyms separation does not imply isolation isolation is dangerous separation is necessary you understand the trailer parks in Arizona did not work there were two men who and they they they created a trailer park and they said we're gonna exist in this community brother branham's gonna come and lead us and brother venom actually went out to that trailer park and checked it out they said this is there it'll never work it never did work they were trying to isolate themselves and keep the world out and keep God in and they were trying to to bring themselves into an isolated life with Christ isolation is not the same as separation we are not to be isolated from the world we are to be separated from Satan's Dominion isolation is very dangerous proverbs 18:1 though a desire a man through desire a man having separated himself which means isolated in the hebrew he says though a man isolates himself he seeketh an inner metalmouth with all wisdom so what he's doing is that when he isolates himself he cuts himself off from all sound wisdom and in the iron that he needs to sharpen iron and then all the things that are without that make him who he is he cuts himself off from that willingly he inner metal a--the with all wisdom the ability of God to change him and to mold him he cuts it off because he has isolated himself and the scripture says that that's wrong he's cut himself from from all sound wisdom and and all the the influences and all of the different things when he isolates himself it becomes dangerous because then he is subject to his own ideology then he has no buffer and no ability to get outside of his comfort zone because when you are in your comfort zone you're comfortable so you don't really need anything you don't really have need of anything else now you can learn and you can grow and I'm talking about a spiritual level here just as an individual not not just as a church as a whole but as a as individual between you and Christ between me and Christ when someone is in a comfort zone they don't really want to get outside of it they have no need to get outside of it now there's some people who all they existing is a comfort zone and they're nervous and they were really bad communicators they don't talk to anybody they don't want to have anything to do with anybody there's other people who are just boisterous and they get in front of you and they're just all in your business and you're ok with it because they're just just that's who they are and they just you connect with them there's some people who are more outgoing than others there's some people who are softer spoken than others or are introverts and there's some who are outgoing God is a God of diversity but everybody can have a comfort zone and when you abide in that comfort zone you're not you're not you've isolated yourself a little bit because there's no buffer to grow you to change you to give you a different idea or a different thought or a different mentality it's just yours and you and yourself so in that place you have the ability to choose what you will and will not do now to bring it more on a church level when a person comes into a church and they are in their comfort zone in the church they come to church they sit down their worship they go home and then they do whatever they do then they come back and do they do the same thing and there's no getting out of the comfort zone then what they'll do is they'll exist in a place where they can pick and choose what they think they need to do because they are comfortable so there's no conviction there's nothing that can move them because they don't they were resisting it they isolate themselves in their own minds they are in a comfort zone and God has no freedom to move he cannot budge them because they're comfortable and they're born-again Holy Ghost filled believers but they're in this mentality of comfort and and where they nothing else can press against them and they don't want anything else to do a little while ago we had a visiting minister and this family came in right in the middle of the service and the Deacons miss they came in and they missed them so the Deacons were like they didn't know who these people were and they came up and they sat right in the front row and they begin to disrupt the service because they were unfamiliar with church was drunk and what they were after was money so that's what they were coming it was it was a service than they were after that so then when the minister calls for prayer one of them goes up to prayer and he's he's just standing there and he begins to say my house burned down and all these different things and I need money and my family's hungry and blah blah blah and this was you know it was a real disruption the whole church was was out of out of unity it disrupted everybody it was so awkward and in in and everybody was out of their comfort zones because they came in and they sat there and I believe it was the devil trying to disrupt it but you it's even on a simpler level when someone of a visiting believer comes in it sits in your seat you can be out of your comfort zone it's like you're in a whole new church looking from the different side you know never saw that side of the pastor before and it's it's it's it can go that simple then it can also go all the way up to to uh just being uncomfortable when some when something comes in that is is out of your comfort zone and it's awkward and it messes with you a little bit because we're so used to the to the do the main theme and then just the going on and we go in and out and in and out and in and out day after day after day and just the commonality of things as they become we we form a comfort zone we're all in danger of forming comfort zones my comfort zone is is very small and out just being personal with you the only reason that I could travel and go all over the world where I go is because of the Holy Spirit if it wasn't for him I would stay at home and not go anywhere I've always dealt with homesickness I'm a homebody I don't want to go anywhere I don't really want to talk to anybody I don't know I want to be with my family with my friends eating what I like to eat in my house that's the kind of guy I am and you might not think about that you might not think that of me because I'd try different things and I meet different people and I interact with a lot of different people and I go and preach to people that's only because the Holy Spirit in me it really is and that all of that glorious to God because he is the one that has enabled me to get outside of my comfort zone and he continually brings me outside of it and I fight him all the time isolation is dangerous I've seen it in churches where a minister because of a doctrinal difference he'll isolate his people so he'll pull him close and because of the the dominating personality of that Minister you'll keep them close and here we won't have them interact so not only are they not interacting really with the world outside but they're not even interacting with fellow believers so they have no iron sharpening against the iron because they're in a complete comfort zone they have created it because they have isolated themselves some of the church members don't even realize what's going on but that man even if he doesn't even realize what he's going what wood is going on he isolates them and then within that he shuts out all sound wisdom so within that then the doctrine just keeps getting farther and farther off like brother Branham said the bullet would do if it's out of alignment at the beginning an inch it'll be four hundred yards off at the end of it that's exactly the same way with a group of people you get a group of people that together that isolate themselves they will be as far off as far off can be the Amish are isolated now the Amish are holy you won't see any more holier people than they because they do they have this they dress the same they have uniformity so there are salacious has produced in them uniformity not a unity because it's probably not on one of them that are in unity in their faith they are conformed to their faith and they are driven to do the work that they are do because they submit themselves to the to the isolation that they are subjected to so because of the isolation that they have they really don't want to have anything else to do with the world because it's a comfort zone to them so they go about the motions and the actions of their faith and thereby they produce a level of holiness that is very modest and very beautiful but brother Branham said that holiness is not just an action holiness is God God is holiness so he says when you be holy as God is holy when you come under the subjection of the Holy Spirit he is the one that produces that holiness in you it's not you going and doing it if you want to go in and dress appropriately or say nice things then that's good and I suggest you do it but it's better that the Holy Spirit convict you to do that and you surrender what you which you were doing wrong to him and he move you on that and that's him moving you outside of your comfort zone and bringing you a little closer into the kingdom of God isolation is extremely dangerous but there is also an isolation from the world that you can have because if we aren't careful we'll isolate ourselves from the world around us we can we can separate ourselves which is necessary but when we go the extra step and we cut everything else off then we create ourselves a comfort zone which is detrimental to the Holy Spirit's ability to move in us because we don't to have any around our interaction with it we don't have anything to do with it and as the scripture says we have we have nothing to do with ungodliness we have nothing to do with with evil as it says abhor that which is evil and cleave to that which is good so we say okay that's evil and this is good we'll have nothing to do with that and therein is an imbalance and there is in therein is isolation because you cut yourself off from the very Dominion that God placed you in this church is just the order that we have to hear faith and faith cometh by hearing of the word so the order that we have is the Holy Spirit's ability to move in your heart to convict you by the foolishness of preaching this is how we come into the faith and we grow in grace and knowledge and as we read it home but this is just a church building you live out there this is only two days a week you live out there five days a week six days a week so you understand isolation is very dangerous and without even knowing it we can isolate ourselves from the world and have nothing to do with it nothing to do with it it's ungodliness I'll have nothing to do with it it can all I can all go away and pass away it's going to pass away anyways I don't care of nothing to do with it and you come to church and you'll exist in that in that comfort zone and you'll abide but in what you're doing is merely associating with the doctrine of the church you're merely associating with with that which you are have been accustomed to be comfortable with Jesus himself says in 1715 I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from evil when Paul says abhor that which is evil and cleave to that which is good that is the exact same that Jesus prayed not take them out of the evil world but keep them from evil as individuals so when you are to a poor evil and to cleave that which is good that is on a personal level you abhor that which is evil and you cleave to that which is good they will never do it so the world in which you live is evil it is going to be evil it's been evil since Satan took it over and it will be evil until it's burned up you cleave to that which is good you personally have nothing to do with ungodliness as it becomes your vessel in Christ as it becomes your life you shun the very appearance of evil you abhor that which is wrong you you set yourself apart because you have been separated by the voice that called out to you to do so so you have not willingly isolated yourselves you heard a voice that called you higher than the world so it's not that you have willingly subjected yourself to something that is evil and we're going to come in here and we're going to exist in this that's not what happens this is just a building if all of us just dissipate it away with the Church of God dissipate away absolutely not because you are the Church of God so although we have the blessing of this building and this church and this assembly which is a marvelous blessing to all of us even though we have this Christ is the Church of God and we live in a world that is evil so as it becomes us we have heard the revelation of 10-7 we have heard malachi four five and six and we come out of the world because we are simulated into god's spirit because we have because the that ministry pointed us back to the word and the word produced in us a faith by the hearing of the word faith comes it produce in us a faith that can abide by the word and that's what god wants to have that's the that's the the mechanics and the dynamics that the holy spirit can move in so as the holy as the word is there and is going forth faith cometh and the holy spirit can abide and that's what produced the life in the church is this the revelation of who he is and the holy spirit to bring them into his kingdom so now that's how you're an ambassador to the rest of the world you haven't willingly cut that off and come in here you are made a new creature in Christ in his kingdom you come in here to hear the word of God you come in here to be refreshed we come in here to worship but out there you are a city on a hill you are a light that is not hid he says I pray that you would jesus prayed that we would not be taken from the world if there's anything that you think Jesus would pray he would say give my people goodness give my people peace give them just take all the evil in the sickness and the death away from them he said don't take them out of the world Lord keep them from evil he says they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth when we isolate ourselves it's dangerous when we isolate ourselves in our own minds it becomes dangerous when we isolate ourselves from the ability to rub up against another piece of iron then we we limit our ability to become sharp brother branham he says in 1963 souls that are in prison now but that soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on and if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him then that nature dies and that nature and that love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead see because if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in you see a man must be born again so this nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you what isolation and I'm not going to be very much longer but what isolation produces is a legalistic mindset legalism is dependence on the moral law rather than by faith so when you isolate yourself not only from from others around you in and exist only in your comfort zone and and because you're not gonna just just for simple logic you're not gonna isolate yourself without having a comfort zone you understand nobody is gonna isolate them from something that gives them the extreme pain in misery no one's gonna exist like that we're human beings we want to find peace and happiness so they find that and then they isolate themselves from everything else within their comfort zone but what that can do is produce legalism whether it be in a church or whether it be personally legalism is a dependence on the moral law rather than by faith legalism actually came it's a mentality but it actually was developed by Chinese philosophy and in in in Confucius in his thinking and in his way of going about things it was very legal it's very this is the way it is this is the way it must be done it doesn't matter how you feel or what you think this is the way it must be done so it's actually a Chinese philosophy that really brought it about but legalism is a mindset so nobody says oh I'm a legalist no they don't say that but did some mind said that you can step into we don't do things legally we don't do things simply because the legality of the law now to do things because of the legality of the law is a good thing and you are not wrong in doing so understand the the Pharisees were abiding by the law yet they were legalists they were the holiest of holies holiest people around because they were abiding in a Christ type that God had given yet they were legalized and within that isolation they they said well nothing into a throme because they're an obviously they wouldn't want everything to do with Rome but they had nothing to do with Jesus they had nothing to do with anything else the they were blinded to seeing what God was trying to show them because they were in a legal aspyn set they were isolated from it they had set themselves away from it and as a result the holy spirit could not show them which was God was not willing to show them brother Branham says in 1965 and marriage and divorce and he's talking about filial love and agape love he says he says the Greek word agape meaning the love of God how would that would make me - how'd that make me do about Jesus Christ as long as I want to go do it it's in my heart to go do it whether I say as long as it's in my heart to do it I go do it now he's talking about his wife he's saying now if I was on the mission field and I wanted to cheat on my wife he said I could go do it but there's something in me that doesn't want to do it he says legalism won't let me cheat on my wife he says legalism won't let me do it it's because I know I'd get punished for doing it but the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart till you want to do it that's the truth of it capital T so you see legalism produces good Christians yes there's a lot of legalists in message churches because they are simulated into the doctrine of the legality of the law and they associate with that in so doing they have isolated themselves because they are in a comfort zone within that so they produce the works and they do that works out of a legalistic mindset instead of being moved by the holy spirit because they have isolated himself from that don't have anything to do outside of their comfort zone legalism won't let me cheat on my wife because III know that I would get punished for it you understand he was saying he said if I if I didn't want to cheat on my wife I know that my reputation would suffer I know that I have all these different things so he said even a legalistic mindset like that will cause me not to cheat on my wife because I know that I'll get punished for it so you can do things and you can act things and you can say things and you can behave in a way that you know you'll be separated outside of your comfort zone and use and so you won't do it if say if a young girl wants to cut her hair and she knows that she'll lose all of her friends she might not cut her hair just because that's what everybody else does so by it by a legalistic mindset she'll start to do that and assimilate into that the the legality of it you understand what I'm saying a man can do the same thing because they know that they'll be isolated if they don't so they set themselves in and they simulate into the behavior of the church and they miss the moving of the holy spirit entirely what isolation causes is a legalistic mindset there were I don't know if you've heard me say this but there was an island after during World War two the Japanese and the Americans came to a certain Island it's called the Melanesian islands and what happened was is that there were Islanders on there that didn't really have any interaction with the outside world well all of a sudden the Japanese and the Americans the Japanese came first and planes and supplies and they built air strips and everything like that and all of these Islanders were just kind of looking at him and they didn't understand what was going on well after a while all the all the supplies that begin to come in they begin to offer the the Aborigines they begin to offer the India the natives supplies so they begin to get all these chocolate and all these different things and cigarettes and all these different kind of things that they they had so the religious leaders of the Islanders never having experienced this before they said well the gods must be pleased with us I mean this is great so it established their dominion over their own people so then the war ended and then the earth the Japanese were bombed out the Americans came the same thing happened different logo on the planes but the same thing happened they begin to get supplies and everything like that well after a while the war ended and then the Islanders were standing there without any supplies coming in so in order for the religious leaders to have the same dominion over the people they began to create which is known as a cargo cult if you've ever heard that term and they use that in business uh in scrum and all the different kind of things it's called a cargo call people just do it because they they they believe that's what everybody else does so the Islanders began to think and the religious leaders begin to think now in order for us to receive the benefits then what we must do is try to create that again so what they did is that they went out and they built bamboo runways they constructed and I've got a picture of it they actually took a picture of it they've got they had they built a plane out of reeds they built headphones out of coconut shells and they'd strap it on their head and then they had bamboo shoots and they'd be out on the runway going like this moving to a plane made out of straw that wasn't moving anywhere and they were doing like this and the guys on the runway would be like this and then there'd be a person with the headphones in the control tower moving a little and they'd say this was documented this is proved I've got a picture of it and they were moving the little knobs and they were you know talking back and forth you know and then they were acting that's out they sincerely believed that the blessings that they had would come by mere legalistic mindset that if they did the works that they thought it would produce the benefits you understand so they were comfortable in that so instead of being out of the comfort zone and going back to the way they were they created their own comfort comfort zone and they began to do things out of a legalistic mindset if we do these things then we must get the benefits no benefits ever come I had no idea what happened to them after that isolation is dangerous come out of her my people be separate separation does not imply isolation you understand we are called to be separated and the reason that we are separated is because we willingly surrender ourselves to the leading of the Holy Spirit and in that we are made new creatures in Christ because of the oddity that is produced you naturally are separated from the things of the world the desires and the things of the world just fade away and they're gone and as a result you are separated and you are now a citizen of that Kingdom living in another Kingdom you're living in Satan's Kingdom although you're born out of another Kingdom you understand so you're separated as a the natural result of a birth is separation the natural result of a Christian life is separation but we are not to willingly isolate ourselves from the world that is around us because if we did that then we would prohibit the ability of God to move amongst us but as the in the order that he has set he has set it so that we could here by faith the word and grow in knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and so we are citizens of that Kingdom that lives in the midst of Satan's Eden you are a city on the hill you are the only thing that they will ever see this is by free will there was a one time an older man he came in and he sat down in front of me in my office and he said we were just talking back and forth and then he says he said there's three things that I hate in this world and I don't trust him worth anything said doctors policemen and preachers and he's just looking at me you know knows like so we got to talking to me and then he after a while he said dumb said I don't understand why God would create evil and everything like that and why God would allow people to live why why doesn't God just take all of the rapists away and that's a philosophical question that you'll hear in seminary and all the different things that is a foundry of a theological teaching is upon that premise of why would God do this and you try to reason with different people and on the basis of philosophy but if we think about it now God put man on the basis of free moral agency so he put you on the basis of free moral agency and he put them on the basis of free moral agency we're all sinners saved by grace so arthur pink said it in the sovereignty of god if he if he had just left it on the basis of free moral agency alone and said whosoever will can come to me how could God have ever been sure that anybody would come so you understood he pre-planned a group of people that were a flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone but yet he had to set them on the basis of free moral agency so that they could choose to love him if God were to simply take all of the evil out of the world and Jesus had instead prayed Lord I pray that you would take the evil out of the world and that you would bring heaven on earth right now if Jesus had instead prayed that then what we would do is we would have had no need for the supreme ethic of love because love is God God is love so as God brings us together the bond of our unity in the faith is Perez is charity is agape love love is then the supreme ethic that we that we have as Christians to love is to choose to love so if he were to simply take everything away and he were to say if that is what we are striving for and he said we're going to take all of the evil away and you are going to have in love intrinsically inside of you then there would be no need to choose what you would have is not humanity you would have a robotic race you would have a race that is pre-programmed and in and in a predetermined to choose a certain thing instead of having someone that can choose to love I choose to serve God I choose to surrender myself to God and those that are God's are the ones that hear the voice my sheep hear my voice and yet he gave you the choice to choose to respond to the voice so he set that inside of you by grace and by love but you are on the basis of free moral agency to accept that or reject it and if you take that away then you do not have humanness you have robots God did not intend to have robots he intended to have people who willingly surrendered themselves and willingly place themselves on the altar and that's what he intends for us that's what he wanted from us and that's what he wants from everybody not just us but they out there but the Benham said in 1965 but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will you cannot accept what the devil says or you accept what God says and that will determine what spirit is in there that determines what what what presence sweeps over the seed that's on the inside of you so yet we are on the basis of free moral agency we have been predestinated to see what we now see because the god of this evil age has blinded the eyes of them which see not so therefore in many different places the Apostle Paul he's talking about how to interact with them and I saved them as in the world as in those who are not believers whether it be denominational or or anything non kingdom members non church members you understand whether that be within or without he says today they're gonna have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away he says turn away from them he says do not be unequally yoked with believers he says give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast your pearls before swine lest they trample them under feet and turn again unto you and rent and rend you who shall over receive you and hear your words and not receive you and then not hear your words depart from that house and shake off the dust of your feet he says he adulterers and adulteresses know that ye are not friendship with the world friendship with the world is enmity with God isolation is not separation you understand so he does not say for the bride of Jesus Christ to pick yourselves up and be planted over here and have nothing to do with the world create your own economy and create your own lifestyle and create all of these different things and abide therein he never says to do that the commission that he gave each and every believer and I think too many times we just skip over the Great Commission it just it's a common thing to us because we have greater things to talk about which we do but yet if we go back to the Great Commission we see that what we have heard in the greater mysteries and realities it calls us to a commission that we must fulfill because all believers it was the pry that took the book in Revelations 8 or 10 8 through 11 it was the bride that took it and then prophesied to all nations it was not just certain men that had a gift in a calling to preach all over the world you may never go anywhere outside of work home and church but yet you are called to preach the gospel the Commission is the same for ministry as it is for lady so therefore we have a great Commission what he did is that he said come out of her my people come out of Babylon and be not partakers of her pleasures come out of her sins and don't have anything to do with their wickedness come out of her and be separated so as a result of the life that we have in Christ naturally we are as separated people we are an oddity you're one in a million you're an oddball everything that you are is different than they are because you are not of this world yet he calls us in Matthew 28 to go right back out into the world that he just called us out of and to preach the gospel so yes we are to be separated from the world and be not partakers of her wickedness and her pleasures but yet he sends us right back out into the war and into the world in the midst of Satan's Eden and says now you are a city on the hill you are a light to the world in fact you are the only light that the world will ever see so in order for them to see the grace of God in in action in order for them to see the goodness of God you are the only thing that they will ever see he's saying here as it is for you do not partake of her pleasures as it is for your life have nothing to do with wickedness as it is for your life have nothing to do with evil don't let it seep into your homes don't let it seep into your life don't let it seep into your church don't let it seep into anything that you have but you must be a witness to the world you must interact with with Satan seen on a daily basis Jesus said I don't want the world to be taken away from you but I pray that you would be kept from evil do you understand what I'm trying to say that you live in the world and we should not be ashamed to live in the world we should not say I don't have anything to do with this world we are God's grace to them and to many times because of our comfort zone that we have within we forget those that are without and I'm not saying that you have to go in and say in and preach on a soapbox or yet you have to go and witness or that you have to go to a different country many times in my heart as I'm on the plane to a different country I say what in the world am i doing I haven't even talked to my neighbors about this and I'm flying to Korea what on earth am i doing and I have that conviction every single time I I fly and yet the Lord has called me to that place and I believe that their seed in that place and I am under the seduction of the Holy Spirit he is in the driver's seat not me so although I would be in my comfort zone because I just have to go next door he has called me to that place so I must go each one of us are called to be a witness to Christ in this day and age and just because we have our comfort zone in here does not mean that there is not seed elsewhere it could be at the McDonald's down the road it could be in Dairy Queen it could be anywhere this we just a down in North Carolina down in the McDonald's I heard a preacher say one time there could be someone in the window at McDonald's they said you bet you be the one to preach to them I said hey ma'am that's good southern accent for you there I could be in the drive-through window they could be your coworker it could be a neighbor it could be someone that you meet on a plane going to another country but yet there is somebody out there to receive the word and grace is still available and then in Christ's blood is still there's plenty to go around and therefore we must be a witness to them and as a result of the goodness that we have in this in this word and in this truth it should not be ashamed for us to witness that and share it we should be happy to share it and if we are too much in our comfort zone that when we get in front of other people we get it gets awkward and it gets so tense that we just back down then there's something wrong because we're not saying in ourselves this is such good news I've got to share it now in all things there is balance because he says do not cast your pearls before swine he says if they deny the power of God from such turn away he says don't have anything to do with somebody who is going to trample under feet what you have provided them and that's why I says brother Jared was saying last night that you have to you have to have you have to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove so as you are interacting with Satan Satan's Kingdom with with citizens of Satan's Kingdom you are an ambassador to the kingdom of God so you don't just come in here and get fed you are to be a light a city on a hill you and you should not hide that candle underneath a bushel you are to set it in front of everybody you are to be you are to show the works of God so that you can glorify the Father which is in heaven you understand I'm not saying that you have to go out and witness to three people before the day is out that's not what I'm saying I'm saying that you have to be yourself and you shouldn't be ashamed of it you have to just be yourself you have to be what you are in Christ that's what you've got to be to be an effective witness you are alight only because of the grace of God in your life your a light in a city on the hill because you have the greatest message that has ever done the face of the earth so with that it is a it is a joy and a comfort to those around but the Billy Paul was sitting in a dentist's chair when time and his dentist came in and Billy Paul Branham and his dentist came in and he had a message book in his hand and he held it up in front of brother Billy and he says is this your dad and brother Billy said yeah yeah that actually is my dad and the dentist he said he put it on the on the table and he says why didn't you ever tell me that about this why didn't you ever tell me about this and certainly why didn't you even tell me it was your dad and brother Billy said he said he felt 2 inches tall he said he didn't know what to think and he said that man needed to hear that and he confronted by the bill and he said I felt so ashamed that I hadn't shared it with more people if you have the opportunity you share the goodness of God are you still in Romans 12:17 recompense to no man evil for evil never repay anyone evil for evil take thought for that which is right and gracious and proper in the sight of everyone in other words provide things honest in the sight of all men you're a witness and you've got to have an experience with something that you witness that's what brother Branham says in order to be a witness you've got to have an experience you better have something to show if you don't then don't say anything because all you're witnessing is another church that they could go to better they come than not 18 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone if you look down on somebody that is in the world because of what they do and you look at yourself like you're more than they then you are worse than they if not for the grace of God where would you be if not for the grace of God where would you be you look down on people who leave the message and they they should have done that and they should have done that I say this is the only heaven they'll ever know that's what they genuinely believe this is the only heaven they'll ever know leave them alone let them live it up it's a shame but this is the only heaven that they'll ever know who are you to say to them is God not able to make the clay as He desires it to be he makes vessels unto honor and someone to dishonor as much as it lies within you live at peace with all men your barber your grocer your insurance person which is hard your you know your your banker which is harder you understand what he's saying to all men live at peace with him if it's possible verse 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord don't avenge yourselves but leave the way open for God's wrath and in righteousness to take over twenty therefore thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head in the old days sometimes a person's fire went out and he needed to borrow some coals to restart his fire so they did everything with coals the Indians would do the same thing they would keep up like a clay pot and they'd have coals in their embers and they continually keep it burning that's how they kept if they needed a fire they'd just take out their bottle and pour some coals on there and then they'd have a spark so sometimes somebody just needs to borrow some coals so by feeding those who are against you by giving drink to them then you heap coals on his head you give them maybe something that will spark him in the right direction you understand so it's not just that you're saying oh well you're gonna heap coals on his head as if he's going to die or with vengeance will be on him the Lord will repay him that's not what he's saying he's saying you could be the very thing that that person needs to have a spark so then live at peace with all men as much as it lies within you don't persecute them but feed them give them water be not overcome with evil but overcome evil with good you understand Jesus didn't pray that we would be kept from evil or that we would be kept from the evil in the world and that we would be taken away from it he didn't say don't let them be subjected to evil he says keep them from evil and here the Apostle Paul says be not overcome with evil but overcome evil with good if a church can't be a resource for a community a haven of rest for a community that I wonder what kind of church it is if it's so awkward for a person to come into a church and sit down that's coming off the street that they feel uncomfortable because everybody's looking down at them from their holy eye then what kind of a resource is that Church going to be now the elect will hear that God's voice so it doesn't matter who God's leads through those doors or through our doors of our church this is the way I feel in my heart about our church I'm not saying this to you but if the shoe fits well then great but up there comfortable if a church cannot be a resource that someone can come to I don't think brother Branham would really have appreciated that just on a personal level and I don't think that's what God wants for his church his kingdom you understand that me that may be the way it is in some churches buildings and in some assemblies or in some community of believers but that is not the way it is in God's kingdom God took the kingdom to them he went out to them and as you said last night he went into Matthews place of residence he went in and he began to talk to the and the taxpayers and all of them and he went in and that the other disciples are standing on the outside looking there and being like what should we do like should we go in there and Jesus was in there is it come on come on be not overcome with evil it's not that you say all there are the devil in there we're not going in there now we don't go into a bar because we have no place in a bar but if you come across somebody that goes around I'm just trying to place the balance in the common sense of it because I don't want you to misunderstand me but saying and you know this well but I'm just saying it was visits on my heart if someone is is is is participating than that then you can't say you're off the devil and blah blah blah and this is in this and this and this what they need is the same water that ignited your seed so by giving them water and by giving them food you are not a partaker of evil any longer you have a standard and you have you are walking in that standard and you will not be compromised balance is not compromised but you must give water to your enemy and food to them and by doing so you could very possibly give spark to them so we don't we don't get into the company of evil people and hang around unless we become overtaken with evil that we have a boundary and we have a line that we can cross and the Holy Spirit sets that for us and as we follow the Holy Spirit whoever he would bring us into contact with we must be willing and not ashamed to share what we have within without there is the church within but there are those without and they you are the only grace that they will ever see so here Paul he says this is what you this is how you must treat each other as a church and this is what you must do but this is how you must treat those without separation is not isolation so if you work in a place that I've worked with homosexuals and I worked right alongside them that was really hard for me but if I were to say I'm not going to work anywhere with a homosexual I had a man come to me and we we had a target on our registry what target is associated in the States the big convenience store it's associated with homosexuals and he said oh you you you you have gift cards coming from Target and they support homosexuality so I went over I should probably should have done this but I went over to him and I said what brand is your suit I said oh did you know that that guy is a homosexual where'd you buy your suit from I want to make sure and stay away from it I probably should not have done that but he was like well you know stuff like that I said we're not overcome with evil I said but we live in the midst of Satan zini and I said me working beside that guy's probably the only grace that he'll ever see do I have do it does it revolt me of course it makes me stomach sick do i do i can't stand to be around it yes at times it bothers me really bad and I just don't I just want to quit and get and get away from it I don't currently work with it I did as a young man do you understand what I'm trying to say we have to get away from the idea that this church in the comfort zone that we have within it is the only thing that there is you're in the Church of Almighty God and yes there is a church within and yes there is a way that we should treat each other and yes we need to treat each other that way so that we can take another step of faith and be going along the way but we should never neglect those that are without and if we isolate ourselves from those that are without then we lose the ability of the Holy Spirit to move through us to reach them like I said I'm not saying you have to go and witness to three before the day is out you have to be yourself in Christ because you are the church within just be yourself isn't it wonderful to be a Christian would you bow your heads musicians would come but the jail wants you come on would you pray with me Heavenly Father we're taught to be a a witness from the very outset of our Christian walk but sometimes in myself I lose the the joy and the beauty of what I what I have inside of me and I'm just looking at me and my failures and I allow the devil to get in my mind and say you're this and you're that and you're that that it stifles my ability to share the gospel with other people so as we come into a greater understanding of who we are in you and as we step into that harmony and we get closer to the time let me become a better Kingdom Kingdom dweller daily increase my ability to be a better servant in God's church not just my local church but but your church and in doing so you will enable me to to thrive in my local church so that the local church becomes a resource for those without so that it's not just for those within so that it's not just for our comfort zones but that we become a powerhouse for the Holy Spirit to work through and if nobody ever comes as a result then so be it but here we stand we carry your gospel Lord it is the greatest thing that we have it's joy it's peace it's good news it's the greatest news we've ever heard because it's brought us from this life to the next let us be good ambassadors of it teach us to be that as we walk the narrow road teach us to be proper ambassadors that would be pleasing in your sight would you help us to do that granite father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen for the journal if you come it's been a pleasure to be with you Saints I'm thankful for the opportunity and may the Lord bless you god bless you my brother amen praise the name of the Lord thank God for the word a man a nice the Lord I said this good and I said we could take it from Genesis to Revelation I said when it comes to earth revelation I said of a comfort zone because that's what the enemy issues right on down through a man'd until only that you could go back beyond Genesis 1:1 you could go way back to Satan himself in heaven amen when he came into his own comfort zone he wanted to do this but not the will of God a man he was what he what he was thinking what he felt within himself but again for the for the true believer is the will of God you want to if your comfort zone disease is God in control your kamas own is being led by the spirit a may and by the grace of Almighty God Amen I said Lord this is tremendous and I said the brother could go on for a few hours amen in acid he can go back to Genesis he could go into it Cain and Abel he could go into the Garden of Eden I could come on down through I said due to the time of Enoch and Noah and and there was another one that kids another revelation that came to me when our brother was ministering and I said Lord I said this is tremendous I said a man I said because it proves again I said what our brother is ministering I said it's not it's not him I said it's the Holy Ghost he's bringing out a revelation of God in his word to his people he's bringing out a revelation of the relationship that God wants with his sons and his daughters in the earth a man is now you in control it's God in control is not you there's lead Ian's got of this leading a man so because if it's you in control there's going to be that what our brother was bringing out that self-righteousness a man that you're going to I I'm going to stay separated from this one to that one I want nothing to do with this one of that one amen brother it's the ice I said last night it's the grace of God that saved you and it's the grace of God to them amen by the grace i again likes to keep a right attitude and a right spirit stay simple and stay humble in the presence of Almighty God amen brothers for that God is God is going to be able to use you some got you somebody to bring me of the word to me God is gonna use somebody to bring the word to you any may and so who's he gonna use you to take the word to Amen by the grace of God maybe they're waiting you know God is waiting on you but we got to have a right spirit and a right attitude brother I tied to any of this and I while our brother was ministering again there was some thoughts came to me and they in the Bible I surprised the Lord this is exactly what our brothers ministry and I said this brother had that problem I said when it comes to his own comfort zone and his self-centered revelation is self centered righteousness and so on oh god I said I said helpless I said to recognize we gotta we gotta have a keep a balance in this by the grace of God you're not called her self-righteousness recalled to his righteousness a man and whosoever will by the grace of God so we want this one we will and as I said you you feel bad because oh well it's the end and so don't worry about it just praise the Lord hallelujah we're going to glory we're going to heaven we're going to be with Jesus but what about that one there a man don't you want that one to go doing what about that brother whatever that sister whatever that man whatever their woman whatever they have that child there a man so brother I pray grace that we're in God's comfort zone is what God wants and not what we want amen if why God wants us to do when God wants to do it where God wants to do it and how he wants us to do it and to whom he wants it done by the grace of God amen submit again I had this trance the truth God has dealt with that vets spirit of self righteousness all down through the ages a man that a fellow this is God so God don't want me to do this God don't want me to do that and that's exactly what God wanted him to do amen he wanted to use them as a light he wanted to use them as a witness he wanted to use them as a testimony a man a-any what they say what they do how they when and where a man and the Lord opened to my heart there is there's a number in the scriptures a man that the survey themselves but ain't not now the way they got one of them separate and the one that I that that was that stands out and I pray God in the name of Jesus give you the revelation amen praise God brother don't don't get caught up with self-righteousness don't get caught out with old God called me into this word and it into this message so I could have nothing to do with them over there I'm gonna have nothing to do with that I'm gonna have you I'm just going to be speaking against it and so I no no no no brother I tell you this there's some of them is God's chosen some of them is elect over there so keep your attitude right keep your spirit right by the grace of God a man yes god help us and I and the Lord led me to the scripture there concerning his servant Jonah amen brother Jonah where Jonah was was was in his own comfort zone Jonah was a Jew and Jonathan was self righteous and Jonah felt that God was going to call and do nothing or somebody anybody else it was just the Jews and he was one of them and God called him and what did he do he do yell oh my god Elvis brother to learn from the story of Jonah oh brother and again we we we I pray that though we've got God's will that you heard the stood today that we're not going to refuse that we're not gonna let it make us feel bad amen oh no yield to it amen do what God want you to do when he wants you to do it where he wants you to do it where to whom he wants you to do it by the grace of God and Jonah didn't want to go down to Nineveh no no he wanted nothing to do with Nineveh because they were Gentiles Lord what are you doing that for amen they're Gentiles they don't worship you did it'll keep the law you know they don't keep the Sabbath and they don't do this they don't do that they're guilty of all this a man but yeah there was there were seed down there a God knew but Jonah didn't know John I thought it was just two just Jews and they're there there are people I believe the only seat on the earth today is those that believe the message no brother/sister whether there are many keitel in you there are many call then there are a few chosen a may there's many but the call or not loss oh no the call dare Cersei the chosen is the elect the chosen is the bride a man and the Jews were the chosen of God and the elect of God but still there was others out there a man and I mentioned recently I said there just say I said J cuz God dealt with the Jews down through those ages and in the Old Covenant in the Old Testament doesn't mean I said their God that there that all the Gentiles are lost no I said definitely not I say there's going to be many a Gentile there I say there will be surprised the promises are gonna be surprised who made it and who didn't make it a man I believe that there's a surprise who's going to be there who's not going to be there a man by the grace of Almighty God is they get other guys sister Betty's grandmother when when when she passed on they they found they found that a certain writing in her Bible a piece of paper and it was it was it was the truth a man and they shitcan she spoke and wrote out concerning a dream and oh she dreamed that she went to heaven and when she got to heaven she was surprised to see this one she was surprised to see that one hello you made it surprised to see another one she said but she said they're all surprised to see me hey man we might be surprised to see this man or this man woman or this my brother this sister and maybe they'll all be surprised to see you amen that's the grace of God we're gonna make it amen God Elvis brother let let us let us learn from what we have heard this morning to keep your attitude right in your spirit right a million and that you're hard to be there to go out to meet somebody else amen to bring somebody to enter into eternal life and truly didn't want to do it we know he went on the boat and God dealt with him there and God is with us amen when we refuse to do what God wants us to do when he wants to do it where he wants to do it to whom he wants it done a man sometimes gotta gotta get we'll go on on the boat like Jonah did and eventually we got we got a humble ourselves and repent and they gotta throw us into the sea amen and be swallowed by the whale they may be swallowed by this be swallowed by their Amen God allows those things happen in our lives to bring us to repentance amen head down to humble ourselves I'm sorry Lord amen not my wheels or yours or thine be done amen as I Minister many times that as the Alpha came to that place the Omega comes to that place a man in Gethsemane not my will then be done so after hearing the word today I pray grace in the name of Jesus if it's a change your attitude and your thoughts I pray you're gonna cry out not my will thine be done amen we've got to come to that place Luther came to that place Wesley came to that place the old fashioned Salvation Army came to that place the Pentecostals had to come to that place not my will they be done a million because it's going to me maybe it's going to cost me this and it could have cost me that a man bring a total separation unto the Lord a man but an end not separation from but it's unto him it's under his control under his leadership a man that doesn't mean you kill you you don't God wants you to do it cuz our Brotherhood bringing it out and bringing it out that God don't want you to every new with that went over there that fellow that guy or they've met or that woman or whatever brother you don't know who's Seton who's not seen God do it does follow his leadership but again there are a lot of believers to our totally separated unto themselves a man they become they become as there were denominations a man they are self righteous oh well they're listened Saints they're Pentecostals when I have nine to do with them they're Anglicans one had nothing to do with them they're Catholic someone I have nothing to do with them yeah I've got I got notes home written by a Catholic and the priest was ministering then he went up to the priest after he said he said would you give me the reference of that Scripture he said and he and he wrote the scripture down some thoughts down and he gave it and that that man gave it to me and I was going and talking with him one time and Annie Aegis and and again a lot of you wouldn't even who wouldn't even talk to him because he was a Roman Catholic and talking to him one time and he said he said he said brother he said I've got to H I've got to confess this he said that I agree with you he said you you recorded that scripture concerning you know the attitude of people in the last days he said brother that's the truth and he said I agree with you he said we have come to that place because not only you experienced that but he said I've experienced him he said the same thing and I recognized that it's prophecy fulfilled it's what Jesus said he said to warn us and so as I said lord I said God bless this man amen praise the Lord it's just like we were in there the other again the brother brought us something then in this came to my mind just recently when he was ministering because it was exactly what God what he has said and I said Amen Lord that's the truth that God will do this and God will do that you know in the end and so on and what came to my mind was something that happened just this past week when we went to the barbershop and on Thursday it was amazing brother I try to let God lead because I turn it maybe we wouldn't make the choice we wouldn't do this we wouldn't do that but maybe God would do it and maybe God would want us to do it amen and as I said we went in and I sat down and there was this woman they're getting their hair cut and some demon eating and maybe it would recognize her as a woman maybe where she look like much so much like a man and but it was a woman and I remember looking at her sitting down myself sister Betty and I said Lord I said would you bring conviction in her heart I said Lord I said I don't know I said what the problem is what the issue is but in the name of Jesus I said have mercy I said our heart goes out to her why why well before I was finished with her and then her brother came and he got into the image of the barber's chair as the Lord as a wave you are Dean this that we would be here at this time and that's when we discovered that the woman was the mother of that man whose body they found in the harbor a few days ago I won't get into the details but he's been on the news he's been in the news where he's been testifying in the court concerning the issue that happened a while ago above the court the court issue just would just came to pass just recently but he was he was there he says to fight and though there was a lot going on I said oh I said maybe that's why I said the Lord laid me laid it on my heart to pray for and her brother of course he came to tears when he began to explain some things I said God have mercy on them so brother I pray the grace of god you're gonna be led by the Spirit of God it's not God and not our comfort zone as God's comfort zone and I tell you what makes it comfort is being in the will of God and being led by the Spirit of God so God elvis is my prayer that we're going to by that by the grace of God we're not going to have to fight our way as a word to nineveh when God called Jonah go down and witness to them and he we didn't want to do it and even after he did it and it brought forth the reason why God had sent him down and that all that Nineveh Nineveh repented everybody in then of it repented and they went on serving the Lord for two hundred and fifty years and going god did nothing they had to do nothing against Nineveh for 250 years because they stayed faithful to the message that God had brought them through Jonah but we find that Jonah still didn't if they felt that it that God shouldn't have done it because of Nineveh and God had to judged on Jonah today he wasn't lost buddy but God judged him amen and the thing of it is you know I got a race up this these trees are over Jonah and then he sent a worm and Jonah was glad for the trees to hide him from the Sun a man all pray was so thankful then the worms came in and took him down and Jonah felt bad for that because the tree was destroyed by the world and God said you feel bad for the tree sir but you didn't feel bad for the Ninevites a man we feel bad for this over there but whatever what about for the others out there a man for your family your friends your neighbors a man my brother brought out God's not willing that any should perish a man why should we be building that any perish if this heart went out to them why not our hearts go out to them amen old but we're at the end yeah I know we're at the end that means your heart ago that much more for them amen you're going to call that much more for the grace of God in their lives and then the grace that you have in the salvations you have you're going to call for them by the grace of God amen but I pray the Grayson and brother talked about the robots a man yes a lot of believers are robots no offense to anybody here I trust you're not by trust you're real but not a robot no no your seed of God brother the prophet of God said you not you know what he said he says my shot yet he said but he said I want to turn to this I want you to see this want you to know this he said do you know he said that man is an amateur God yeah he said you're an amateur God he said because you come out of God amen if you're really the true seat of God you're you you are God a man and you are Jesus in flesh amen so he's made flesh and I like it he's made flesh in is bright by the grace of God so God Elpis is my prayer and that the will of God be done not my real father thine be done God give us the Holy Ghost balance in the word in our relationship with Christ we need a Holy Ghost balance don't take the letter of the word and run with it and became become as our brother Minister concerning legalists become a legal Asst and many are leading us with the message no no no no don't do that is take the spiritual revelation of it in our hearts by the grace of God not the letter of it but the spiritual revelation by the grace of Almighty God amen so I pray that God will help you to go back and take what our brothers ministered on go back and see it all the way from Genesis to Revelation and God had to deal with that in every age when it comes to the comfort zones that people get into he had to deal with it with individuals from Genesis to Revelation he had to deal with it with the Jews he had to deal with it with the Gentiles amen that's why did you go to church ages that's what that's what produced the the message of repentance in the church ages God of God said repent repent because I have this I see I got this against you I see this wrong with you and so on until finally the last stage there was one or two ages didn't have to repent but the others did but the last stage he commanded zealous repentance god help us a man because why because this age more than the other ages was legalistic he said you say you're rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing a man and Noah's not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked let's see ourselves in the eyes of God by the grace of God amen god help us is my prayer thank God for our brother Stephens ministry I tell you God was getting down where we live that's right so I thank God for that there's not many ministries are doing that a lot of Ministers and ministries what are they doing or they're way up there
