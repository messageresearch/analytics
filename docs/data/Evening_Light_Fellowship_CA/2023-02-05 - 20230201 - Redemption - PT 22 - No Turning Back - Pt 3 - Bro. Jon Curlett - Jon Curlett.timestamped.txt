[38:40] or Jesus we're so thankful for your
[38:42] presence in our midst this morning
[38:45] Lord we're thankful for Saints of like
[38:47] Precious faith
[38:48] Lord that would gather together Lord set
[38:51] aside this time
[38:52] Lord to lift up your name and give you
[38:54] all the praise and the glory and the
[38:56] honor that you're so deserving of
[38:57] heavenly father
[38:59] Lord we look at where we could be
[39:01] Lord and then we see where we are and we
[39:03] see the great hand of Grace Lord The
[39:05] Guiding hand of Jehovah God Lord that's
[39:07] predestinated us from before the
[39:09] foundation of the world and has brought
[39:11] us to a place where we can worship and
[39:14] praise you in spirit and in truth
[39:15] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[39:18] for it this morning Lord and we're just
[39:20] praying that your grace would continue
[39:21] with us now in the ministering of the
[39:23] word Lord may you just discern the
[39:25] thoughts and intents of the heart soul
[39:27] may you provide the needs Lord
[39:28] straighten us out where we need it we
[39:30] pray Lord and Men it's all said and done
[39:32] may we just be closer to you Lord when
[39:34] we leave them when we came in Lord grant
[39:37] it by your grace we ask in Jesus
[39:39] Christ's name amen
[39:41] and then God bless you
[39:43] welcome each one this morning turn if
[39:45] you would to Ephesians chapter 5.
[39:47] Ephesians chapter 5. it means good to
[39:49] have sister Betty back with us God bless
[39:51] her and brother Barry and sister Darlene
[39:54] as well it's good to see them here amen
[39:55] we've got a full I think this is the
[39:57] first time we've had pretty much
[39:58] everybody here we've got a couple
[40:00] missing of course but it's what it's
[40:03] going to look like moving forward
[40:04] certainly and it's good to preach to a
[40:07] half full church that's what it feels
[40:09] like here we're half full so I need to
[40:11] fill the other half by God's grace but
[40:13] it's good to be here amen
[40:15] Ephesians chapter 5 very familiar
[40:17] scripture certainly
[40:18] says husbands love your wives even as
[40:21] Christ also loved the church and gave
[40:23] himself for it that he might sanctify
[40:25] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[40:28] by the word that he might present it to
[40:30] himself a glorious church not having
[40:33] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[40:36] that it should be holy and without
[40:38] blemish
[40:39] so ought men to love their wives as
[40:41] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[40:44] loveth himself
[40:46] it says for no man ever yet hated his
[40:49] own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth
[40:52] it that means he feeds it and he takes
[40:55] care of it he keeps it healthy even as
[40:58] the Lord the church for we are members
[41:00] of his body of his flesh and of his
[41:02] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[41:05] his father and mother and shall be
[41:06] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[41:09] be one flesh and he says this is a great
[41:11] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[41:14] and the church amen God bless you you
[41:16] can have your seats this morning
[41:19] we spoke a few Services ago on the
[41:21] restoration to True unity and I kind of
[41:24] went so far with it and then I stopped
[41:25] them then we jumped into this this mini
[41:27] series on no turning back and I want to
[41:29] preach on no turning back again this
[41:31] morning the third and last part by God's
[41:33] grace but I want to take these two
[41:35] thoughts and blend them because really
[41:36] they're two halves of the the same thing
[41:38] and I want to get into the real motive
[41:40] behind I believe and the real
[41:42] inspiration as to what started us on
[41:43] this little portion in the series of
[41:45] redemption and the last couple Services
[41:47] we covered the the Israelites when they
[41:49] came out of Egypt and how they kept
[41:51] turning back and every time something
[41:52] difficult came up they kept looking back
[41:54] to Egypt and they kept looking at the
[41:56] good things of Egypt and forgetting that
[41:58] they were in slavery the whole time and
[42:00] they forgot the supernatural presence of
[42:02] God and they forgot the signs and the
[42:04] Wonders and time and time again when the
[42:06] littlest thing came up they would turn
[42:08] away from God and they'd look longingly
[42:10] back with where they came out of Amen
[42:12] but we want to turn a corner this
[42:14] morning amen and we've talked about
[42:16] Israel's Redemption from Egypt and I'm
[42:18] so thankful it's a type because I don't
[42:20] believe that the people I'm preaching to
[42:22] tonight are a perfect reflection of that
[42:24] church that came out of Israel because
[42:26] they kept turning back they kept looking
[42:28] back their hearts were not in it when
[42:30] the hard times hit they turned away from
[42:32] God Amen but I believe that I'm talking
[42:34] to a bride this morning that's not going
[42:36] to turn back but I want you to
[42:38] understand that that not turning back is
[42:40] not something of your own choosing I
[42:42] want you to understand that the reason
[42:44] you can keep going the way you're going
[42:45] the reason that you're on the path
[42:47] you're on the reason that you're
[42:48] continuing maybe even when it doesn't
[42:50] feel like you ought to continue is
[42:52] because it's something that's
[42:53] Supernatural that's keeping us along
[42:55] this path amen I want to encourage you
[42:57] this morning you're going to make it
[42:59] you're going to make it he who started
[43:02] the work and you will be faithful to
[43:04] complete it amen but that starting of
[43:06] that work has to be the right way and it
[43:08] has to be with the right the right
[43:09] origin and it has to be through the word
[43:12] of God Amen it can't be something of
[43:14] your own making it can't be something of
[43:16] your own choosing it can't even be a
[43:17] path of your own choosing but it's
[43:19] something that God does and he calls you
[43:20] to it the scripture says that no man can
[43:23] come to God except God call him first so
[43:25] the reason that you're on this path the
[43:27] reason that you are where you are today
[43:28] is because he has called you and that's
[43:31] what makes you not be able to turn back
[43:33] because there's going to come times and
[43:35] maybe you've already experienced times
[43:37] in your life where you want to turn back
[43:38] you say I don't have it in me to
[43:40] continue on this path I don't have it in
[43:42] me to continue this walk I don't have it
[43:44] in me to continue down this pain and
[43:46] this training and this change and maybe
[43:48] the disappointments that have come
[43:50] through in lives and you're going to hit
[43:51] that point and something Supernatural is
[43:53] going to have to keep pushing you
[43:55] forward because there's nothing in you
[43:56] to keep going anymore when you've given
[43:59] all you can and not nothing has happened
[44:00] what are you going to do then that's
[44:02] when the supernatural has to come in
[44:04] amen so often why we're lacking the
[44:07] Supernatural is we're trying to continue
[44:08] to do it in our own strength in our own
[44:11] will in our own way of our own desire
[44:13] and that's only holding God back many
[44:15] times brother Bob talked about it just
[44:17] before prayer where he said we're
[44:19] talking about sometimes letting go of
[44:21] the wheel
[44:22] just letting go and saying Lord I need
[44:24] you to move because I've been driving
[44:25] too long and I'm not getting anywhere I
[44:27] need you to take hold of the steering
[44:29] wheel amen
[44:31] listen
[44:32] how you feel your strength or your
[44:35] weakness matters not not at all
[44:39] what matters is is god with you and
[44:41] that's the only thing that matters
[44:42] because when you're feeling down when
[44:44] you're feeling weak when you're feeling
[44:46] overcome when you're feeling
[44:47] unvictorious guess what that doesn't
[44:49] change God that's why you want God is
[44:51] because he never changes there's no
[44:53] variableness there's no shadow of
[44:55] turning there's nothing in him that
[44:57] changes with circumstance it changes
[44:58] with life that changes with time nothing
[45:01] changes so you've got to be bound to him
[45:03] amen the prophet of God I want to
[45:05] encourage you this morning with this he
[45:07] says the anointed word of God being
[45:09] Vindicated before any man that's born to
[45:11] be a Son of God With The predestinated
[45:14] Germ into him for this hour he'll see
[45:16] God's message as sure as there's a God
[45:18] in heaven
[45:20] he says Martin Luther sought for his day
[45:22] Wesley sought for his the Pentecostal
[45:25] saw for his he says now what about you
[45:28] they went into a denomination
[45:30] you know what that means that means we
[45:32] can go into a denomination if we're not
[45:34] careful because everyone before us has
[45:36] done it but there's a true church that
[45:38] doesn't go into denomination she goes
[45:40] into relationship
[45:42] she says here is the word condemning it
[45:45] what going into denomination telling you
[45:48] what we're to have today and just
[45:49] exactly Malachi 4 and all these other
[45:51] promises for the hour what do you see
[45:54] what are you looking at amen here we are
[45:57] the real genuine Eagles here my sheep
[45:59] know my voice and a stranger they'll not
[46:01] follow
[46:03] he says why
[46:05] why can you hear
[46:07] why do you understand why does it have
[46:10] an effect on you it was put in there by
[46:13] predestination you were foreign to a Son
[46:17] of God you were ordained to be a
[46:19] daughter of God you were in God before
[46:21] the foundation of the word you're only
[46:24] manifested in this day for his honor and
[46:27] His glory he says how can you do it
[46:30] without honoring his word and stand with
[46:32] every word of God he says which you are
[46:34] a part of that word by predestination
[46:37] because look the God is the word you
[46:40] believe it well he always was the word
[46:42] in the beginning was the word and if the
[46:44] Word was God then you were in God the
[46:48] word the part that you're to pray
[46:51] you have a part to play
[46:54] but it is not of your choosing it is not
[46:56] of your own making it's not of your own
[46:58] deciding but it is already predestinated
[47:01] by God through the word he says the part
[47:03] that you're to play was in God before
[47:06] the foundation of the world he's seen
[47:08] you he knew you he predestinated you to
[47:11] it
[47:12] so how can you turn back from something
[47:14] that was eternally predestined how can
[47:17] you change something that was in God
[47:19] that existed before you ever stepped
[47:21] into a breath of life on this Earth You
[47:23] can't do it what's holding you from not
[47:25] turning back from turning back is what
[47:27] the predestinated power of Christ that
[47:31] foresaw you before you ever came into
[47:32] existence amen the the role that you're
[47:36] playing the path that you're walking is
[47:38] already planned out for you and you can
[47:40] no more stop it than I could stop
[47:42] brother Chad's truck with my hand
[47:44] we've all seen his big truck right
[47:46] how much does it weigh brother Chad
[47:50] 12 tons 24 000 pounds do you think I
[47:53] could stop that with my hand and we sit
[47:56] here and we think my weakness my faults
[47:58] my lack of commitment is gonna stop the
[48:01] predestination of God Church you can't
[48:04] stop it the mack truck the international
[48:06] whatever it is that he's driving will
[48:09] run over your faults we'll run over your
[48:11] failures and it'll drag you all the way
[48:13] to Eternity Kicking and Screaming if he
[48:15] has to
[48:16] but he wants you on his side he doesn't
[48:19] want you trying to stop it he doesn't
[48:21] want you trying to protest it trying to
[48:22] say I can't do it but he wants you to
[48:25] get on the Big Mac Truck and let's go to
[48:27] glory amen he's wanting you on board but
[48:29] you can't stop at your faults and your
[48:31] failures cannot stand before the
[48:33] predestination of God he's going to
[48:36] overcome them and that's never going to
[48:38] hold you back amen you may lose a battle
[48:40] from time to time you may take steps
[48:42] back from time to time we all have
[48:44] faults and failures and sometimes Satan
[48:46] gets a hold of us and we do take a
[48:47] couple steps back
[48:49] but what eventually the Holy Spirit
[48:50] comes in and it raises up a standard we
[48:53] take back the ground we've lost and then
[48:55] we start moving forward and footsteps is
[48:57] possession and there's going to come a
[48:58] time where we don't step back anymore we
[49:01] understand or we move forward we stand
[49:03] or we move forward and that's going to
[49:04] be the progression of the church amen
[49:07] listen you're linked to God whether you
[49:09] like it or not right now
[49:12] whether you like it or not right now
[49:13] you're linked to God and he's not going
[49:15] to lose a one
[49:16] he's not going to lose the one
[49:20] we sit there and we put pressure on
[49:22] ourselves
[49:24] am I gonna hold on am I gonna make it am
[49:27] I gonna get the victory am I going to
[49:29] get the healing am I going to get the
[49:31] Holy Ghost
[49:32] he's going to make sure you get it it
[49:34] takes the pressure off because we're not
[49:36] holding him he's holding us he's the one
[49:39] that has Us in the palm of his hands and
[49:42] that's what guarantees us to the end
[49:43] it's not my commitment it's not my
[49:46] discipline it's not my strength it's him
[49:48] it's him that's holding us it's him
[49:51] that's going to take us across the
[49:52] Finish Line amen
[49:54] by the way I would say the seals were
[49:55] broke why in the last Church age to
[49:58] reveal these truths why the lamb broke
[50:02] the seals and revealed them to his
[50:03] church in order to collect his subjects
[50:05] for his kingdom his bride
[50:08] the opening of the seals is not for
[50:10] knowledge
[50:12] it's never been for knowledge Church
[50:15] knowledge killed the original Israelite
[50:17] Church
[50:18] knowledge kills
[50:20] that's not why he opened the seals he
[50:22] says but he did it to collect his
[50:24] subjects for his kingdom his bride see
[50:26] Oh my he wants to bring his subjects to
[50:29] him now what is it Out of the Dust of
[50:32] the Earth
[50:34] listen look where you are today out of
[50:37] the bottom of the sea out of the pits
[50:39] out of everywhere and every place out of
[50:42] the regions out of the dark out of
[50:44] paradise wherever they may be he'll call
[50:47] and they'll answer
[50:49] the conditions for hearing the car are
[50:52] not to be in a message Church
[50:54] the conditions for healing hearing the
[50:56] call are to be a predestinated son and
[50:59] daughter of God with the sea Gene of God
[51:01] inside of you and no matter where you
[51:03] are you'll hear his call when he calls
[51:05] you
[51:06] he says he'll call and they'll answer
[51:08] he's come to his subjects he revealed
[51:11] his secrets and they saw it and time is
[51:13] no more at that time time has run out
[51:16] it's finished so he's revealing the
[51:18] seals he's revealing these truths and
[51:20] they have a purpose
[51:22] they have to have an effect there's
[51:24] supposed to be something happening
[51:26] because this word has been opened to us
[51:28] it ought to be having a greater effect
[51:30] than it's ever had since the day of
[51:31] Pentecost
[51:32] and it's going to have a great effect
[51:34] because this one's going to take us all
[51:35] the way off of this Earth in a Rapture
[51:37] and a resurrection amen
[51:39] but it can't just be I understand the
[51:41] Seven Seals no you've got to have the
[51:43] revelation of it living inside of you
[51:45] you've got to have an effect in your
[51:47] life from what's happening with the
[51:48] opening of the word
[51:50] but I love where he says there he says
[51:52] he's calling them out of where the dust
[51:54] of the Earth the bottom of the sea out
[51:55] of the pits out of everywhere every
[51:57] place regions of the dark out of
[51:59] paradise where are you at this morning
[52:02] you're sitting in church but that may
[52:03] not be where you're sitting at this
[52:05] morning
[52:06] you can be in despair you could be in
[52:08] weakness you could be overcome
[52:11] you can be worn out you could be tired
[52:13] you can be sick
[52:15] and you say that's going to hold me back
[52:17] I don't feel like an overcomer I don't
[52:19] feel like I'm a Victor I don't feel like
[52:21] I'm a Believer all the time he says he's
[52:23] calling you wherever you're at and
[52:25] you're going to answer
[52:26] and the the thing that he's looking for
[52:29] you to do is to answer
[52:31] not to say I've got it I've got it I've
[52:33] got it but the answer so that he can
[52:35] start to do something with you in your
[52:37] life amen
[52:39] he's screaming out he's saying what
[52:42] Christ is coming for his bride and no
[52:44] matter where she is she will answer
[52:48] she will answer whether she's in a
[52:50] chicken yard as an eagle whether she's
[52:52] in a bar or whether she's in a message
[52:54] Church
[52:55] she will answer
[52:57] because he won't lose one and he's not
[52:59] leaving until we get out of here amen
[53:00] listen if they're feeding pigs somewhere
[53:02] they'll still hear the call and they'll
[53:05] come back to the father's home
[53:07] church this is a work of his doing it's
[53:09] not yours and it's not mine it is his
[53:12] and we have to rest on the fact that
[53:14] he's the one that's doing it amen and
[53:17] our security our Assurance our faith our
[53:19] rest our trust our peace is in that not
[53:22] in ourselves not in ourselves amen
[53:27] he says and Jesus said as it was in the
[53:29] days of Sodom so will it be at the
[53:31] coming of the son of man when the son of
[53:33] man is being revealed he says not no
[53:35] more as a church see not no more the
[53:38] bride is called there's a difference now
[53:41] it's not just calling out a people but
[53:43] it's calling out a people for
[53:44] relationship
[53:46] he says the bride is called see in that
[53:48] day the son of man will be revealed what
[53:50] to join the church to the Head unite the
[53:54] marriage of the Bride the bridegroom
[53:56] call will come right through this when
[53:58] the son of man will come down and come
[54:00] in human flesh to unite the two together
[54:04] so he says there's a message that's
[54:05] coming and there's a message that's come
[54:07] it's over with now
[54:08] the call is already here
[54:11] and what is it behold the bridegroom
[54:13] cometh
[54:14] that's what we've heard is there is a
[54:16] marriage there's a ceremony coming and
[54:18] you got to get ready for it
[54:21] you got to have what oil in your lamp
[54:23] it's the only requirement to go in oil
[54:25] in your lamp
[54:26] and then he'll come and he'll sweep you
[54:27] out of that amen but there's a
[54:29] Redemption coming and this purpose is a
[54:31] Unity it's a unification it's not just
[54:35] understanding and it's not just
[54:36] Revelation but it is an actual
[54:38] unification of the Earthly bride and the
[54:41] Heavenly bridegroom and that's what this
[54:43] is all about
[54:44] amen I'm trying to get you to lift your
[54:47] eyes and see what you are
[54:49] what he says you are what he's ordained
[54:52] you to be and what power is available to
[54:55] you by the Holy Spirit to be what he
[54:57] said you were going to be
[54:58] the only thing holding us back is Will
[55:00] We believe because the scripture says if
[55:02] thou can'tst believe all things are
[55:05] possible
[55:06] we've got the the unfettered unlimited
[55:09] access of the blessings and power of God
[55:11] if we can't believe and put it into into
[55:13] a work in our lives amen God's calling
[55:16] out a bride without spot or wrinkle
[55:19] and that means you're going to be
[55:20] without spot a wrinkle whether you
[55:22] believe it or not he's going to do it
[55:24] but he's going to get you to the place
[55:26] where you start to believe it as much as
[55:27] he does and then it'll start to have a
[55:29] real effect amen this is not us choosing
[55:32] a road and choosing a path This Is Us
[55:34] coming to the path that he calls us to
[55:36] and then we start to willingly walk in
[55:37] that way
[55:38] he says the bridegroom call will come
[55:41] right through this when the son of man
[55:42] will come down and come in human flesh
[55:45] to unite the two together now notice we
[55:47] we talked in the the scripture in the
[55:49] opening scripture where it says that a
[55:51] man will leave his his mother and his
[55:53] father and cleave to his wife and the
[55:55] two shall be one flesh brother Brown I'm
[55:57] saying this is the same thing that's
[55:58] happening in this age he's using the
[56:00] same type of language there right he
[56:02] says the two shall be one flesh the
[56:04] church has to be the word he is the word
[56:06] and the two unite together and to do
[56:09] that it'll take the manifestation of the
[56:11] revealing of the son of man
[56:13] now remember brother Bram said I am a
[56:15] son of man revealing the son of man I am
[56:18] a prophet revealing the prophet
[56:20] revealing the Christ right the Son of
[56:23] God in flesh so what we saw was not
[56:25] brother Branham we saw God using Brother
[56:28] Branham and what was it doing it was
[56:30] proving that he's here
[56:32] remember brother Brown says that's my
[56:33] ministry that's my message to declare
[56:35] him that he is here why to do signs and
[56:39] wonders no to unite with the bride
[56:42] that's what he's doing he's saying he's
[56:44] here he's ready so you got to get ready
[56:48] you got to get ready and that's what
[56:50] this message is doing is getting you
[56:51] ready brother Brown says if I can get
[56:53] the bride to stand still I'll put on her
[56:55] the Garment that she needs the wedding
[56:57] dress that she needs that's what he was
[56:59] here to do to get us ready with a call
[57:01] amen
[57:02] he says the church has to be the word
[57:04] because he is the word the two unite
[57:06] together and to do that it'll take the
[57:08] manifestation of the revealing of the
[57:09] son of man not a clergyman not just any
[57:12] old preacher not just any priest it had
[57:15] to take a prophetic office he said see
[57:18] it's son of man Jesus Christ will come
[57:20] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[57:22] make his word so real
[57:25] that's what happened in the ministry of
[57:27] a prophet was he made it so real
[57:30] that's the reason I believe that God is
[57:32] alive is because of the ministry of
[57:34] William Branham first and foremost but
[57:36] I've seen it now continue from William
[57:37] Branham into my life and into your life
[57:40] and into our lives and into our church
[57:42] to see that he's alive and well today
[57:45] we can't hold it just there it's got to
[57:47] come into US amen
[57:49] it will come down in human flesh Among
[57:51] Us make his word so real it'll unite the
[57:53] church in him as one the bride so our
[57:56] marriage is here
[57:57] now is the marriage time
[58:00] it says and then shall be shall go home
[58:02] to the wedding supper amen so we go to
[58:04] the marriage supper which always follows
[58:06] the marriage ceremony
[58:08] so it's got to happen here
[58:11] the marriage has to happen here the
[58:13] unification has to happen here
[58:16] he says she's already United see we go
[58:19] to the wedding supper not to the
[58:20] marriage and he quotes Revelation fill
[58:22] your flesh self all of the Flesh of the
[58:25] Mighty Men because the marriage of the
[58:26] Lamb has come he says but the Rapture is
[58:28] going to the wedding supper when the
[58:31] word here unites with the person and
[58:33] they too become one and then what does
[58:36] it do then it manifests the Son of God
[58:38] again
[58:39] who's the son of man
[58:41] Christ
[58:43] so he's saying this unification will
[58:45] produce Christ all over again just like
[58:47] he did two thousand years ago
[58:49] not the church theologians
[58:52] not just great Mysteries and great
[58:54] doctrines and great preaching but it is
[58:56] the person of Christ
[58:58] he says the son of man the word and the
[59:01] church become one whatever the son of
[59:03] man did he was the word and the church
[59:05] does the same thing that's the path
[59:08] we're headed on
[59:09] The Works that I do shall you do also
[59:13] now what does that look like is that
[59:15] signs and wonders
[59:17] that's not the end goal here
[59:19] is it an amazing life it is amazing
[59:21] preaching it's amazing Services those
[59:22] are all good and great but the end goal
[59:24] is what unification
[59:27] it's Christ and you and all of us as one
[59:30] that's the end goal
[59:32] signs and wonders brother Brown says
[59:33] those are bait on a hook
[59:35] that's all it is it says you can't major
[59:37] on a minor but that doesn't mean it
[59:39] shouldn't be here but we're not here to
[59:41] do signs and wonders we're here to get
[59:42] in in one with Christ Jesus that's what
[59:45] we're here for
[59:46] so don't chase the signs and wonders
[59:48] because those follow
[59:49] those follow the unification they don't
[59:51] lead the unification and then you've got
[59:53] to get to him first amen
[59:55] what is it our inheritance is a
[59:57] unification with Christ that brings the
[59:59] same signs wonders life words uh motive
[1:00:04] objective everything
[1:00:06] that Christ had in my life and in your
[1:00:08] life
[1:00:09] as individuals we don't go in as a
[1:00:11] church unfortunately
[1:00:13] evening Light Fellowship isn't going in
[1:00:15] a Rapture it's going to be individuals
[1:00:17] that go in a Rapture amen
[1:00:21] listen to this there's going to be those
[1:00:23] that do turn back
[1:00:24] and we've seen it we've seen it we can't
[1:00:27] pretend that it hasn't happened we can't
[1:00:29] pretend that people haven't left the
[1:00:30] truth of this hour they have
[1:00:32] the scripture speaks of it in John it
[1:00:34] says they went out from us but they were
[1:00:36] not of us for if they have been of us
[1:00:39] they would no doubt have continued with
[1:00:40] us
[1:00:41] but they went out that they might be
[1:00:43] made manifest that they were not all of
[1:00:45] us
[1:00:46] listen people use this to turn feather
[1:00:48] people that leave their Church
[1:00:50] this has nothing to do with it
[1:00:53] listen as Ministry sometimes we like to
[1:00:55] think that we can feed the people better
[1:00:56] than anyone else that's not the way it
[1:00:58] works God knows where his sheep are best
[1:01:00] fed and God will lead his sheep to the
[1:01:02] to the placing of the of their need amen
[1:01:04] this is not what this is about this is
[1:01:06] not about me or brother Gerald trying to
[1:01:08] hold people here if we do that we get in
[1:01:10] God's way every single time we need to
[1:01:12] hold loosely
[1:01:14] to do it to be as careful and as
[1:01:15] considerate and as and put everything
[1:01:17] we've got into it but if God leaves you
[1:01:19] someplace else then go with our blessing
[1:01:22] because God has to feed a sheep and
[1:01:24] he'll take you where you're going to
[1:01:25] best be fed amen
[1:01:26] but everyone that left Egypt was not
[1:01:30] a True Believer we know that it was a
[1:01:33] mixed multitude and guess what in every
[1:01:35] Church there's three kinds of Believers
[1:01:36] whether we like it or not there's three
[1:01:38] kinds of believers
[1:01:40] and so there's going to be some that are
[1:01:41] straight unbelievers and they go out and
[1:01:43] they never come back then you've got to
[1:01:44] make believe that hangs around and
[1:01:45] that's just an unbeliever that's
[1:01:47] pretending
[1:01:48] and that's the hardest ones to spot many
[1:01:50] times and then you have the real
[1:01:51] believer and guess what it's not for us
[1:01:53] to say who's who
[1:01:55] the Rapture decides that the
[1:01:57] resurrection decides who's who it's up
[1:01:59] for us to treat each other as Christ
[1:02:00] would treat each and every one of us all
[1:02:02] the time no matter what no matter where
[1:02:03] we're at in our life amen but listen not
[1:02:06] everyone that starts the journey not
[1:02:08] everyone that says I believe the message
[1:02:09] of the hour not everyone that says amen
[1:02:11] during the service is going to make it
[1:02:12] in a rapture
[1:02:13] it's not true
[1:02:16] because Paul John speaks clearly that
[1:02:18] there were some that did those exact
[1:02:19] things and then they walked away
[1:02:21] so there are going to be some that don't
[1:02:23] make it amen but the bride will not be
[1:02:27] in that group obviously she's going to
[1:02:29] make it now Paul would talk about this
[1:02:31] he says if for if I build again the
[1:02:33] things which I destroyed I make myself a
[1:02:35] transgressor now you cannot be a
[1:02:37] transgressor under the blood of Jesus
[1:02:39] Christ
[1:02:40] because all your sins are covered you
[1:02:42] can't God can't even see sin in you he
[1:02:44] can't attribute it to you so the only
[1:02:45] way you can become a transgressor is to
[1:02:47] go back to what you used to be which is
[1:02:50] under the law
[1:02:51] you can get out from Grace you can get
[1:02:53] under the out from under the blood and
[1:02:55] you can go back to the way things were
[1:02:56] and that takes you to the law and that's
[1:02:58] what makes you a transgressor is you go
[1:03:00] back to the way you were
[1:03:02] that's the only thing that makes it that
[1:03:03] way amen now people will look at that
[1:03:06] and say well look I I did something I
[1:03:08] used to do I listened to that rock and
[1:03:10] roll I used to like whatever it might be
[1:03:12] pick your poison pick your your bad
[1:03:14] habits that maybe you've tripped up and
[1:03:15] done again they say well that's me
[1:03:17] brother John that's it I'm out I'm out
[1:03:19] no Paul says if I build again
[1:03:24] he didn't say if I trip up he didn't say
[1:03:25] if I fall he didn't save Satan gets one
[1:03:27] over on me
[1:03:29] he doesn't say if you have a moment of
[1:03:30] weakness and you do something you didn't
[1:03:32] that you used to do that you're out no
[1:03:34] he says if I build it up again if I go
[1:03:36] back and I try and recreate try and
[1:03:38] rebuild try and redo all of those things
[1:03:40] and get back what I had before that's
[1:03:42] when I'm out from under grace and I'm
[1:03:44] now back under the law and that leads to
[1:03:46] death
[1:03:47] falling and tripping is not is is not
[1:03:49] what takes you back
[1:03:51] because remember a righteous man falls
[1:03:53] seven times and then he gets up again
[1:03:55] don't worry about tripping up just make
[1:03:57] sure you're continuing to go on and not
[1:03:59] going back and building what you used to
[1:04:00] what you used to do get away from those
[1:04:03] things
[1:04:04] he says for I through the law and dead
[1:04:06] to the law that I might live unto God
[1:04:08] I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:04:11] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:04:14] and the life which I now live in the
[1:04:17] flesh
[1:04:18] In the Flesh I live by the faith of the
[1:04:21] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:04:23] for me what's he say in church he's
[1:04:26] saying I have Christ Living in me and
[1:04:28] that's where I live the life I do that's
[1:04:30] how I can do the things I do I look and
[1:04:32] I make choices that lead to certain pain
[1:04:34] to lead to to certain suffering that
[1:04:37] that make life difficult for me even to
[1:04:40] my own death and yet I do it and I'm
[1:04:42] doing it why
[1:04:43] because Christ is living inside of me
[1:04:46] that's the only reason I can do it and
[1:04:49] that's the only reason you can do it is
[1:04:50] if you recognize that it's him that's
[1:04:51] doing it and him that's driving you amen
[1:04:53] something kept Paul going kept Paul
[1:04:56] going no matter what
[1:04:58] listen he went all the way to his death
[1:05:00] willingly willingly
[1:05:03] and nothing held him back from it Paul
[1:05:05] had ministers leave
[1:05:07] Paul had people turn their backs on him
[1:05:09] Paul got backstabbed Paul got thrown out
[1:05:12] of churches pug was he was whipped
[1:05:14] multiple times he was stoned and left
[1:05:16] for dead
[1:05:17] he was put in prison
[1:05:19] and nothing stopped Paul from serving
[1:05:22] Christ
[1:05:23] because there was something inside of
[1:05:24] him that kept going no matter what there
[1:05:26] was a deep calling to the deep and it
[1:05:29] was pushing him all the road to Eternity
[1:05:32] there's nothing going to hold him back
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] but I want to put this in marriage terms
[1:05:37] because that's how we understand things
[1:05:39] these days we're talking about no
[1:05:40] turning back and we we talked about
[1:05:42] marriage and divorce a while ago and how
[1:05:45] Jesus said it was not so from the
[1:05:47] beginning divorce is the way to turn
[1:05:49] back
[1:05:50] divorce is a way to say I don't like
[1:05:52] where I'm at I want to go do something
[1:05:53] else and we talked about how we had to
[1:05:55] die to our first husband our first
[1:05:57] husband had to die and that was what our
[1:05:59] original nature
[1:06:01] that's what had to die and if we go back
[1:06:03] to that then something's wrong amen now
[1:06:06] we're entering into marriage with Christ
[1:06:07] as the bride of Christ and there's no
[1:06:09] turning back from that there is no
[1:06:10] divorce because why from the beginning
[1:06:12] it was not so it wasn't even an option
[1:06:15] from the beginning and what we're
[1:06:16] entering into as the bride of Christ is
[1:06:18] we're entering into a relationship from
[1:06:19] which there's no turning back
[1:06:21] now Hebrews 6 says this it says for it
[1:06:24] is impossible
[1:06:26] for those who were once enlightened and
[1:06:28] have tasted of the Heavenly gift and
[1:06:30] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:31] and have tasted of the good word of God
[1:06:34] and the powers of the world to come if
[1:06:36] they shall fall away to renew them again
[1:06:38] unto repentance seeing They Crucified to
[1:06:41] themselves the Son of God afresh in
[1:06:43] other words he says you can't go back to
[1:06:45] your old husband
[1:06:47] and be in with Christ there is no back
[1:06:51] and forth with him you're either married
[1:06:52] to him or you're not you're either with
[1:06:54] him or you're not but you're not dating
[1:06:56] in the note and then dating and then no
[1:06:57] no no it's your end or you're out
[1:07:00] now people have looked at this in the
[1:07:01] prophet of God would preach on this and
[1:07:03] they would say well it sounds like you
[1:07:04] can get the Holy Ghost and lose it he
[1:07:06] says no if it were possible
[1:07:10] then
[1:07:11] but he says it's impossible for you to
[1:07:13] get the Holy Ghost and lose it because
[1:07:14] the scripture says you are sealed till
[1:07:16] the day of your Redemption seal that's
[1:07:19] it Neato done nothing can change it you
[1:07:22] get the Holy Ghost God will never pull
[1:07:23] it from you now he'll pull away the
[1:07:25] feeling of his presence
[1:07:27] you get out of here you get out of his
[1:07:28] way you get out of the word of God he'll
[1:07:30] pull that back that's no problem to say
[1:07:31] that but your soul is sealed
[1:07:33] but you'll lose Victory because of it
[1:07:35] you'll lose overcoming power in these
[1:07:37] different things because you choose
[1:07:38] willingly to get away from him but your
[1:07:40] soul is sealed there's no changing those
[1:07:42] things amen
[1:07:43] but what if you go back it means that
[1:07:45] you never entered in that's what he's
[1:07:47] saying here is you went back to your
[1:07:49] first husband and that means it didn't
[1:07:50] die when you got baptized it means that
[1:07:52] you didn't truly let go you didn't truly
[1:07:54] surrender and you're going back because
[1:07:56] you realize it's back there to go back
[1:07:58] to
[1:08:00] there's something waiting for you and
[1:08:01] that's why you can walk away is because
[1:08:03] you think it's there and what is it he
[1:08:05] says it's what it's a you're crucifying
[1:08:07] you're putting him to an open shame
[1:08:08] because you married him
[1:08:10] and you took on his name Christian
[1:08:13] but all the world sees is what cheating
[1:08:15] Christian
[1:08:17] because on one hand you say I'm married
[1:08:18] to Christ and then on the other side you
[1:08:20] live according to the world and the
[1:08:21] things of the world he says you can't do
[1:08:23] both at the same time if you do it
[1:08:24] you're re-crucifying him he says and he
[1:08:27] won't he won't allow that
[1:08:30] so if you're going back and forth guess
[1:08:32] what
[1:08:33] you're not in yet
[1:08:34] I'm not saying you can't get in
[1:08:37] don't say well I'm bad I'm always up and
[1:08:39] down I'm in and out brother John that's
[1:08:41] okay
[1:08:42] but you got to get in you got to get in
[1:08:44] so you never get out again that's what
[1:08:46] we're looking for and that's what the
[1:08:47] new birth is is you're in and that's it
[1:08:49] it's done you're sealed to the day of
[1:08:51] your Redemption amen
[1:08:53] now some people would say that this is
[1:08:55] speaking of Believers and they would say
[1:08:57] you can get the Holy Ghost and then lose
[1:08:58] it in these different things but Paul
[1:09:00] clarifies it himself as he continues now
[1:09:02] listen to this he says for the Earth
[1:09:04] which drinketh in the rain that cometh
[1:09:06] off to upon it and bringeth forth herbs
[1:09:08] meet for them by whom it is dressed
[1:09:10] receives blessing from God
[1:09:13] so I want you to catch that he says
[1:09:14] there's herbs and plants and good things
[1:09:16] that receive rain and are blessed by
[1:09:18] that rain
[1:09:20] but I want you to notice they're
[1:09:22] intentionally planted
[1:09:25] it says for those by whom it is dressed
[1:09:27] somebody planted it and somebody's
[1:09:29] taking care of those herbs and plants
[1:09:31] and vegetables and fruits and all these
[1:09:32] different things and is taking care of
[1:09:34] it to help it produce what it's supposed
[1:09:35] to produce
[1:09:37] right and there's rain coming down and
[1:09:40] those plants are blessed by that rain
[1:09:42] listen there's rain coming down this
[1:09:44] morning
[1:09:46] and in theory all of us are blessed by
[1:09:48] it
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] but I want you to notice that they are
[1:09:52] good plants to start
[1:09:55] plants don't decide if they're going to
[1:09:57] be a good plant or a bad plant they are
[1:09:59] what they are
[1:10:00] and guess what the Holy Spirit Reign
[1:10:02] blesses a good plant and it causes it to
[1:10:04] bring forth the fruit that's inside of
[1:10:06] it because of the seed that's in it
[1:10:09] but listen verse 8 it says but that
[1:10:10] which bear thorns and Briars is rejected
[1:10:13] and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to
[1:10:16] be burned so you have plants there that
[1:10:18] are not planted they just are there
[1:10:20] because they just blew in and they're in
[1:10:23] the same atmosphere they're in the same
[1:10:25] Services they're under the same hearing
[1:10:26] of the word and guess what they produce
[1:10:29] thorns and Briars
[1:10:32] under the same anointing under the same
[1:10:34] Holy Spirit Reign under the same message
[1:10:37] under the same Ministry you can have
[1:10:39] good and bad from the exact same thing
[1:10:41] and what determines it the seed that's
[1:10:44] inside of it
[1:10:45] that's the only thing amen
[1:10:47] what is it there's nothing in a briar or
[1:10:49] a thorn to bring forth fruit
[1:10:51] all it can bring forth is thorns and
[1:10:52] Briars it can only be prickly no matter
[1:10:54] what no matter how often you get it in
[1:10:56] the presence of God it's still going to
[1:10:58] be a briar and a thorn nothing changes
[1:11:00] it and what is it it's the
[1:11:02] predestination of God he chose you and
[1:11:05] everything else that blows in it's just
[1:11:06] going to be what it's going to be
[1:11:08] he says in verse 9 but beloved we are
[1:11:11] persuaded better things of you
[1:11:14] and things that accompany salvation
[1:11:17] though we thus speak accompany salvation
[1:11:20] so often we're saying get get them to
[1:11:21] Christ
[1:11:23] get them saved he says there's things
[1:11:25] that accompany salvation there's more to
[1:11:27] it than salvation there's more to this
[1:11:29] than just saying I accept the finished
[1:11:31] work of Calvary there's more to happen
[1:11:33] there's more to come there's a greater
[1:11:34] walk there's a greater Revelation
[1:11:36] there's a greater power there's a
[1:11:37] greater anointing than just saying I
[1:11:39] accept the finished work of Calvary
[1:11:40] because there's a life that has to come
[1:11:42] behind it amen we're sealed to the day
[1:11:45] of the Holy Ghost amen this is not just
[1:11:47] a taste because remember it says they
[1:11:48] have tasted the good things of God
[1:11:50] they've partaken of it
[1:11:52] but they don't have it a taste isn't
[1:11:55] what makes you a believer
[1:11:57] no you got to get into it you got to
[1:12:00] become a part of it you got to take it
[1:12:01] in there and then you gotta you gotta
[1:12:03] really dig into it amen
[1:12:05] but look at the planting
[1:12:07] look at the planting here because
[1:12:08] there's clearly two different groups
[1:12:09] here
[1:12:11] and they didn't choose themselves
[1:12:14] fruit tree is a fruit tree it can't
[1:12:16] choose to be a briar or a thorn and a
[1:12:18] briar and a thorn can't choose to be a
[1:12:19] fruit tree they are what they are and
[1:12:20] it's by God's predestination it's by
[1:12:22] God's choosing that we are these things
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:26] listen brother Brahm says the man didn't
[1:12:28] have a wife
[1:12:29] the wife and the man was the same thing
[1:12:31] he had the feminist and masculine spirit
[1:12:34] in himself
[1:12:35] so we use these terms wife
[1:12:38] but that's a modern thing
[1:12:40] because in the original it wasn't a man
[1:12:43] and his wife it wasn't a husband and
[1:12:45] wife it was just them they were one
[1:12:48] it's funny we have these you know we
[1:12:49] have all the pronouns today he she her
[1:12:52] him they them guess what they were them
[1:12:54] but they were one
[1:12:56] that was the original pronouns they need
[1:12:58] to go back to this I guess amen but he
[1:13:01] says he didn't have a wife
[1:13:02] he says the man and the wife was the
[1:13:04] same thing
[1:13:06] they were one
[1:13:07] remember he's not talking about when
[1:13:08] they had two bodies he's saying they
[1:13:09] were one in Adam
[1:13:11] he says and he who Satan had to separate
[1:13:13] and take a byproduct after the whole
[1:13:15] creation was made no female created by
[1:13:17] God in the original creation can do a
[1:13:19] thing like that she was made thus to do
[1:13:21] it and he knew she would do it if he
[1:13:23] didn't he wasn't God
[1:13:24] now we've covered this before and so I'm
[1:13:26] only going to take just a brief moment
[1:13:28] to cover it but remember Eve could not
[1:13:30] fall as long as she was in Adam
[1:13:32] literally as long as she was an atom
[1:13:35] because he says Adam had the feminish
[1:13:36] and the masculine spirit inside of him
[1:13:38] so they were all in one body and so Eve
[1:13:40] could not go her own way she could not
[1:13:42] be separated out from Adam I'm calling
[1:13:45] her Eve the woman right she couldn't get
[1:13:47] away from him so she couldn't have a
[1:13:49] separate mind she couldn't have a
[1:13:50] separate set of legs to take her away
[1:13:51] she couldn't get away from him they were
[1:13:53] Bound in the same body and so she was
[1:13:56] safe as long as she stayed there but
[1:13:58] then God says it's not good for man to
[1:13:59] be alone he said he needs to have that
[1:14:01] part taken out of him and so he takes a
[1:14:03] rib I was listening to somebody the
[1:14:04] other day and they said if you look at
[1:14:05] that word rib it actually means side
[1:14:08] so it's like God took a half of the man
[1:14:10] and put it out
[1:14:12] and built a woman out of it
[1:14:14] and that's what she is she's the other
[1:14:15] half
[1:14:17] but he took it out and he put that in a
[1:14:18] body and now Satan can get at her
[1:14:20] because it's two separate bodies
[1:14:22] the man can be here and the woman can be
[1:14:24] here and Satan can be talking to the
[1:14:25] woman over here and the man doesn't know
[1:14:27] about it before they were right here so
[1:14:29] Satan couldn't get at her but now that
[1:14:30] they're separate he can get at her
[1:14:33] but then the woman she's put into that
[1:14:35] separate body and she's capable now of
[1:14:37] stepping away from Unity she can choose
[1:14:39] to stay by Adam's side all day long and
[1:14:41] she'll never get touched if she and Adam
[1:14:44] had stayed walking side by side all the
[1:14:46] time Satan would have had a hope he
[1:14:48] couldn't have gotten to her because Adam
[1:14:50] would have been there to protect her to
[1:14:51] stop it to step in the way but because
[1:14:53] she separated from Adam and I've said
[1:14:55] because Adam let her out of his sight
[1:14:58] right let's not put it all in the womb
[1:15:00] because the man didn't cleave
[1:15:02] then she got out on her own and she was
[1:15:04] a target for Satan
[1:15:06] but the reason I'm saying this is
[1:15:07] because now we have a second Adam and
[1:15:09] that's Christ amen and we are the second
[1:15:11] Eve and he has a body prepared for him
[1:15:14] and see now we're two separates
[1:15:17] now we've got Jonathan curlette and his
[1:15:19] will and his ideas and his thing and
[1:15:20] we've got Jesus Christ over here and
[1:15:22] guess what Satan can get at me when
[1:15:23] we're like this
[1:15:25] but he's saying what he's trying to do
[1:15:26] is he's trying to bring us back like
[1:15:27] this so that him and I are one so that
[1:15:30] you and him are one so that we're all in
[1:15:32] one same body
[1:15:34] right the head above the intelligence
[1:15:36] tied to us the the body of Christ and so
[1:15:39] now there is no separation there is no
[1:15:41] getting us away from the presence of God
[1:15:42] there is no getting us away from the
[1:15:44] word because we are the presence of God
[1:15:46] we are the word of God made flesh today
[1:15:48] that's what he's trying to restore us
[1:15:50] back amen that's what brother Brown says
[1:15:51] the man didn't have a wife there was no
[1:15:53] him and her it was just them
[1:15:57] so now there is no Bride In Christ it is
[1:15:59] just him
[1:16:01] that's what he's bringing us back to is
[1:16:02] it's just him
[1:16:04] we have no head it's him and he has no
[1:16:07] body but us together we make the perfect
[1:16:09] body and that's what it's Christ the
[1:16:11] word and it's all of us together inside
[1:16:13] of that amen so it's not this push-pull
[1:16:15] game
[1:16:16] see that's where we're at today is we're
[1:16:18] in this flesh and it's so difficult
[1:16:19] because the flesh is pulling and then
[1:16:22] this Holy Spirit in US is resisting and
[1:16:23] so we've got this battle but we're
[1:16:25] coming to that perfect Unity to where
[1:16:27] what the flesh has no control over us
[1:16:29] where we have total victory in our lives
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:34] that's why Paul would say nevertheless I
[1:16:36] live yet not I but Christ that liveth in
[1:16:40] me
[1:16:41] why because it wasn't Paul
[1:16:43] and it's not you and it's not me that's
[1:16:45] living it's Christ that's living in us
[1:16:47] this is the unification that's happening
[1:16:49] and the hardest thing for us to stand is
[1:16:51] understand is what's happening when it's
[1:16:53] not fully completed
[1:16:55] because they're sitting there we're
[1:16:56] saying brother John I'm not there yet
[1:16:58] brother John's not there yet we're not
[1:17:00] there yet nobody here is there yet
[1:17:02] because we're not gone in a Rapture but
[1:17:05] we're building up to it and so day by
[1:17:07] day we ought to be seeing a progression
[1:17:09] listen if we're sitting here and we're
[1:17:11] looking at the opening of the word and
[1:17:13] all these things and saying I'm waiting
[1:17:14] until the end for this to happen you're
[1:17:16] going to be too late because he's doing
[1:17:18] it today he's doing it right now in our
[1:17:21] midst he's doing it in your life today
[1:17:22] whether you realize it or not and if
[1:17:25] nothing's happening if nothing's
[1:17:26] changing week to week month to month
[1:17:28] year to year then I'm sorry to say
[1:17:30] you're not in
[1:17:31] you've got to come in because we're
[1:17:33] always progressing we look at you know
[1:17:35] you look at a graph of our daily lives
[1:17:37] and are we doing well or not we're up
[1:17:38] we're down we're up and down but the
[1:17:40] thing is the trend line ought to be
[1:17:41] going upwards
[1:17:42] and if we're going upwards that's what's
[1:17:44] happening is that we're dying out and
[1:17:46] Christ is gaining control inside of us
[1:17:48] more and more every day and there's more
[1:17:50] of a surrender and there's more of a
[1:17:51] dying out and as that happens then we
[1:17:53] start to grow and grow and grow in
[1:17:55] Christ and then what happens is the last
[1:17:56] little bit is the quickest step
[1:17:59] but there's got to be that growth
[1:18:00] there's got to be that maturity there's
[1:18:01] got to be that change day in and day out
[1:18:03] week in and week out as he's drawing us
[1:18:06] closer to him
[1:18:07] that's what's supposed to be happening
[1:18:09] until the end is we are him and he is us
[1:18:13] that's where we're going in all this
[1:18:15] that's why marriage can only be between
[1:18:17] a man and a woman
[1:18:19] because if you have a man and a man you
[1:18:20] have two heads and nobody
[1:18:22] if you have a woman and a woman you have
[1:18:24] two bodies and no head
[1:18:25] it has to be a man in the head and the
[1:18:27] woman the body
[1:18:28] and she's doing what his desire is and
[1:18:31] he's leading and guiding her and he's
[1:18:32] loving her and he's nourishing her
[1:18:33] because she is him that's why it has to
[1:18:36] work that way amen
[1:18:40] the Bram says this
[1:18:41] he says they want to shortcut to Heaven
[1:18:44] taking as much of the world as they can
[1:18:46] take
[1:18:47] you can't take any of it there's no
[1:18:49] shortcuts you come the way of Calvary
[1:18:52] you come the way of the brass altar you
[1:18:54] come the way of the Brazen serpent he
[1:18:56] says you die you actually die and I
[1:18:59] listen to this and he he's practically
[1:19:01] crying he says oh God why can't I say it
[1:19:03] right you die you literally die to
[1:19:06] yourselves you die to the things of the
[1:19:09] world and are born Anew amen he says no
[1:19:12] world the things of the world is dead
[1:19:14] there's no shortcut see they want to
[1:19:16] come right quick they don't want to grow
[1:19:19] they want to say I accept Jesus as my
[1:19:23] savior and then boom they're out doing
[1:19:24] signs and wonders
[1:19:27] they want all the victory they want
[1:19:29] everything there and he says they don't
[1:19:30] want to progress they don't want to grow
[1:19:33] they don't want to mature in Christ they
[1:19:35] just want to do it and then be done and
[1:19:37] then say that's it and I don't have to
[1:19:38] do anything
[1:19:40] that's not the way it works
[1:19:42] children are born men are matured
[1:19:45] you aren't born a woman you're born a
[1:19:47] baby you turn into a young lady and then
[1:19:49] you turn into a woman you're born a baby
[1:19:52] you turn into a boy and then you grow
[1:19:53] into a man and it's no different for a
[1:19:54] son or a daughter of God you grow into
[1:19:56] it to be a mature adult in the in the
[1:19:58] kingdom of God Amen
[1:20:02] what is it that we're doing why are we
[1:20:04] walking through this desert
[1:20:07] why is life so hard
[1:20:08] because it's getting us ready for Unity
[1:20:12] it's separating us out listen there's
[1:20:14] not a whole lot out in the desert to
[1:20:15] distract you is there
[1:20:18] deserts are pretty boring
[1:20:20] they're Bland they're Dusty they're dry
[1:20:23] there's not a lot of water there's
[1:20:24] certainly not a lot of entertainment
[1:20:26] there's not a lot of the world out in
[1:20:27] the desert he had to get them out there
[1:20:29] to separate them to get them ready to go
[1:20:31] in to full unity and that's what's
[1:20:33] happening amen what is it it's the power
[1:20:35] of the Holy Ghost to resurrect and
[1:20:37] Rapture a church that's what he's
[1:20:38] building us towards
[1:20:40] he says now notice at the opening of The
[1:20:43] Seven Seals in Revelation 10 the full
[1:20:45] word is being born into manifestation
[1:20:48] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[1:20:51] God in the full strength as it was when
[1:20:54] he was here on Earth
[1:20:55] manifested in the same way doing the
[1:20:58] same things that it did when it was here
[1:21:00] on Earth amen Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus
[1:21:03] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:21:05] forever notice he says it's been born
[1:21:09] into manifestation
[1:21:11] it's not just head knowledge
[1:21:14] it's not just sitting in church saying
[1:21:15] amen but there is a birth that has to
[1:21:18] happen for this to grow
[1:21:20] for something to occur for something to
[1:21:22] become real he says it has to be born
[1:21:24] and you can't be educated into it you
[1:21:27] can't be taught into it you can't be
[1:21:28] preached into it it has to be a birth
[1:21:31] experience and a birth is an experience
[1:21:34] let me tell you when a baby's born and
[1:21:36] knows it's been born because everything
[1:21:38] changes in a moment
[1:21:41] the baby's in the womb and it's warm and
[1:21:43] it's fed it doesn't have hunger
[1:21:45] everything is just perfect and then all
[1:21:47] of a sudden the squeeze happens
[1:21:50] and things are very uncomfortable
[1:21:52] and then all of a sudden things get very
[1:21:54] bright and very cold
[1:21:56] because it's born a baby knows when it's
[1:21:59] born
[1:22:00] and you'll know when you're born too
[1:22:02] because everything changes
[1:22:04] everything's changes you come into light
[1:22:06] you start breathing on your own you
[1:22:07] start breathing in a different way you
[1:22:09] start living a different way
[1:22:10] why because there's a spirit inside you
[1:22:12] that's doing it you're not dependent on
[1:22:13] your mother now you're doing it all
[1:22:15] yourself amen and that's why the Holy
[1:22:17] Ghost is an experience it's not a
[1:22:19] Doctrine it's not saying amen it's not
[1:22:21] even understanding what's happened
[1:22:22] through this message and what's happened
[1:22:23] here it is a new birth experience and
[1:22:25] you'll know it because you'll start
[1:22:27] living a life that you've never been
[1:22:28] able to live before
[1:22:30] but things changed
[1:22:33] because in the beginning brother Brown
[1:22:34] says look he says first was just a
[1:22:37] covenant he's saying there's only one
[1:22:39] Covenant a singular Covenant he says
[1:22:41] Adam and Eve were co-equal one man and
[1:22:43] one woman it was bone of his bone flesh
[1:22:45] of his flesh same DNA everything and it
[1:22:47] was under one Covenant and that Covenant
[1:22:49] was obey
[1:22:50] don't eat the fruit
[1:22:52] that's it that was the only Covenant he
[1:22:54] says but notice now after the beginning
[1:22:57] after the beginning After Time began
[1:22:58] back in there it was eternity it's over
[1:23:01] now after the fall was made by Eve after
[1:23:03] the fall there was need to be another
[1:23:05] covenant made he says this is going to
[1:23:07] stumble you but I'm going to give you
[1:23:08] the scripture to prove it's the truth
[1:23:10] God at the beginning made one of a kind
[1:23:16] it was not a man and a woman that were
[1:23:18] different they were one of a kind they
[1:23:21] were the same thing expressed through
[1:23:23] two bodies but it was the same thing
[1:23:25] and he's saying that's how God makes it
[1:23:27] is he makes it the same thing that's
[1:23:29] what we're being restored back to One of
[1:23:31] a Kind the same person he says but now
[1:23:34] after the fall now we're going beyond
[1:23:36] that the Covenant the original Covenant
[1:23:38] was co-equal but now after the fall
[1:23:40] there's another covenant made now she
[1:23:42] was no longer ruler with him each must
[1:23:44] have a separate Covenant one for the man
[1:23:46] and one for the woman he says two
[1:23:48] covenants now that closes the beginning
[1:23:50] of what Jesus said it wasn't so in the
[1:23:52] beginning so everything that's happened
[1:23:54] since they left Eden
[1:23:57] has been what fall
[1:23:59] new Covenants
[1:24:00] and the Covenant was had to do with pain
[1:24:02] and suffering and difficulty and all
[1:24:03] these things
[1:24:04] but he says we've got to come back to
[1:24:06] the original Covenant because that's
[1:24:07] where the unity is he says we've got
[1:24:09] another Covenant now it's another
[1:24:11] Covenant now there is a covenant for the
[1:24:13] product and the byproduct
[1:24:15] and we've covered this before
[1:24:17] but from the beginning it wasn't so as
[1:24:19] he's pointing here and that's what we
[1:24:21] want to look at he says you've got to
[1:24:22] come back to the truth to find out what
[1:24:25] it is see we talked about the opening of
[1:24:27] the seals we talked about the the the
[1:24:28] the revealing of the word and these
[1:24:30] different things he says it's to what
[1:24:31] it's to bring you back
[1:24:34] let it not just go to our heads but let
[1:24:36] it let it be something that has an
[1:24:37] effect in our lives he says you've got
[1:24:39] to come back to the truth to find out
[1:24:40] what it is it's always been that way
[1:24:42] that's the regular Covenant with God
[1:24:45] from the beginning first before the
[1:24:47] beginning from the beginning there was
[1:24:49] just one in one one man one woman
[1:24:52] after the sin came in there was one man
[1:24:54] and a bunch of women he says it runs
[1:24:56] that way in nature every animal and
[1:24:58] human beings and natural flesh is animal
[1:24:59] we're mammal we know that all of us see
[1:25:01] and it's all God's nature and
[1:25:03] opportunity
[1:25:04] so if we stay there in that condition a
[1:25:07] man with a bunch of women we're most
[1:25:08] miserable listen
[1:25:10] a man without the Holy Ghost is a beast
[1:25:13] that's what he's pointing to here and
[1:25:15] listen even David had 500 wives and
[1:25:18] wasn't satisfied and then Solomon
[1:25:20] doubled down on it and he had a thousand
[1:25:22] and were they satisfied no and what did
[1:25:24] it produce chaos pain and suffering
[1:25:27] split the it split the the the the
[1:25:29] country amen
[1:25:31] that's what happens under the second
[1:25:33] Covenant
[1:25:35] is that all it brings is a beast nature
[1:25:37] that has its way and that's never going
[1:25:39] to get us anywhere he says but now that
[1:25:41] the seals are opened that's why brother
[1:25:43] Branham kept pointing to 63. things
[1:25:45] change then
[1:25:47] he says after now that the seals are
[1:25:49] open the spirit of Truth directs us to
[1:25:52] the word the spirit of Truth
[1:25:54] that's why you got to be born into this
[1:25:56] body because the spirit of Truth is
[1:25:58] going to direct you to the word that's
[1:26:00] going to tell you what to do and how to
[1:26:01] do it today
[1:26:02] that explains why all the mistakes has
[1:26:05] been down Through the Ages because the
[1:26:07] seals was not open this was not revealed
[1:26:09] it's true what happened they left their
[1:26:11] first love in the Ephesian Church agent
[1:26:13] when Paul was the messenger and they
[1:26:15] left it they fell away and all of a
[1:26:16] sudden they started making mistakes why
[1:26:18] because the book was closed up
[1:26:22] listen Paul brother Brown says I don't
[1:26:24] bring a new message I preach what Paul
[1:26:25] preached
[1:26:26] it's not that it wasn't known it had to
[1:26:28] be restored that means it was known
[1:26:31] and then they fell away from it and now
[1:26:32] we're being brought back to it so that
[1:26:34] we can have the fullness of the same
[1:26:35] experience that they had in their lives
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:39] he says now
[1:26:40] there is a true woman a true woman
[1:26:43] virgin that marries her husband and
[1:26:46] lives and she is a blessed thing to the
[1:26:49] man if God could have given his son any
[1:26:51] better thing than a wife he would have
[1:26:53] given that to him
[1:26:55] that's us
[1:26:56] you are a blessed thing to Christ when
[1:26:59] we're in our proper position
[1:27:01] we're not supposed to be a hindrance
[1:27:03] we're supposed to be a blessing we're
[1:27:04] supposed to be an encouragement we're
[1:27:05] supposed to be what doing things for the
[1:27:07] kingdom of God and for his benefit and
[1:27:10] for its benefit
[1:27:11] when we're in our position
[1:27:13] he says now so sisters that's where you
[1:27:16] ought to be
[1:27:17] is you ought to be what in a place where
[1:27:19] you're a blessed thing to your husband
[1:27:20] and not a cursed thing
[1:27:24] but it's up to him to let you know what
[1:27:27] he wants you to do
[1:27:28] men are poor communicators
[1:27:30] that's where we Step Up
[1:27:32] except one that raised his eyebrow to me
[1:27:34] just now
[1:27:35] most of us are poor communicators
[1:27:37] right
[1:27:38] but if we can give them the right vision
[1:27:41] then they can help us to get there and
[1:27:43] they're a blessed thing but often what
[1:27:44] happens is they're doing their own thing
[1:27:45] because we don't give them the direction
[1:27:46] they need
[1:27:48] and then we get mad because they didn't
[1:27:49] do what we thought
[1:27:51] instead of what we said
[1:27:53] amen
[1:27:54] he says now look
[1:27:57] he says in the final analysis look now
[1:27:59] he says there's one Jesus Christ one man
[1:28:02] God Emmanuel do you believe that he says
[1:28:04] but the members of his wife the members
[1:28:07] plural of his wife singular are many see
[1:28:10] thousands times thousands of thousands
[1:28:12] his wife the bride the church he says
[1:28:14] you understand now he says that's why he
[1:28:16] said to Adam before sex was ever induced
[1:28:19] or introduced multiply and replenish the
[1:28:21] earth when he was yet in the beginning
[1:28:23] when he was yet both male and female in
[1:28:25] himself he says there it shows them that
[1:28:27] the bride has got to come from the word
[1:28:30] by spiritual multiplication
[1:28:33] multiplications C replenishing the Earth
[1:28:37] Adam didn't fulfill this
[1:28:39] Adam and the woman didn't fulfill us he
[1:28:41] said multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:28:43] and they didn't do it
[1:28:45] they did it once and they did it wrong
[1:28:47] and so they couldn't do it properly and
[1:28:49] so what happens is Christ the second
[1:28:51] Adam has to do it and I want you to
[1:28:53] understand he always leads by example
[1:28:56] he leads by example so he doesn't tell
[1:28:58] you to do something he doesn't tell you
[1:28:59] have an experience he doesn't tell you
[1:29:00] to go through something that he hasn't
[1:29:02] gone through because he was tempted in
[1:29:04] every manner like we were and yet
[1:29:05] without sin but even his birth was what
[1:29:08] showing us how we're supposed to be born
[1:29:11] we weren't meant to be born by physical
[1:29:12] intimacy remember the prophet God spoke
[1:29:14] of it he said we were supposed to be
[1:29:16] what by the spoken word
[1:29:19] brother Bram didn't make that up
[1:29:22] he took it back to the word and we're
[1:29:23] going to read it right now
[1:29:25] listen Isaiah 7 14 says therefore the
[1:29:27] Lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:29:29] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:29:32] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:29:34] that's a prophetic word and listen the
[1:29:36] word of God is always prophetic it's
[1:29:39] always prophetic it has life it has
[1:29:41] power and it's always pointing to
[1:29:42] something that's going to happen and
[1:29:44] then it happens
[1:29:45] right because he said his my word won't
[1:29:46] return to me void that means the word is
[1:29:48] prophetic always
[1:29:49] what's going to happen is going to
[1:29:51] happen amen and what it is is he's
[1:29:52] giving a prophecy here of how the birth
[1:29:55] is supposed to happen in humanity
[1:29:58] and then so he gives it there and he
[1:30:00] gives the word
[1:30:01] but then what happens we go to Luke 1
[1:30:03] and it says and the angel came in to
[1:30:05] Mary and said hail Thou Art highly
[1:30:07] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:30:09] art thou among women and when she saw
[1:30:11] him she was troubled that is saying and
[1:30:13] cast in her mind what manner of
[1:30:14] salutation this should be
[1:30:16] listen there's a call that goes forth
[1:30:18] and sometimes we don't realize why is he
[1:30:20] talking to me like this
[1:30:22] what favor have I garnered in my life
[1:30:25] and listen she was a chosen vessel and
[1:30:28] you're no different
[1:30:29] you have favor because you're chosen not
[1:30:31] because you're some awesome thing
[1:30:33] he chose you before the foundation of
[1:30:35] the world and that's why he's talking to
[1:30:36] you the way he is that's why you get to
[1:30:38] hear the message preached is because he
[1:30:39] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:30:41] world to hear it and to be blessed and
[1:30:43] highly favored under the hearing of that
[1:30:45] word
[1:30:46] says the angel said unto her fear not
[1:30:48] Mary for thou has found favor with God
[1:30:50] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:30:53] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[1:30:55] call his name Jesus then said Mary unto
[1:30:58] the angel how shall this be seen I know
[1:31:00] not a man and the angel answered and
[1:31:02] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[1:31:03] upon thee and the power of the highest
[1:31:06] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[1:31:08] that Holy thing which shall be born of
[1:31:09] thee shall be called the son of God
[1:31:12] that's how the new birth is supposed to
[1:31:14] happen that's how our original birth was
[1:31:16] supposed to happen was the overshadowing
[1:31:18] of what the Holy Spirit
[1:31:21] now let you let me read a quote here to
[1:31:23] put this into context and this is
[1:31:25] something that that has been used so
[1:31:27] often to put down the experience of the
[1:31:29] new birth
[1:31:30] brother Brown says that's some of the
[1:31:32] Mysteries the angel is supposed to wind
[1:31:34] up he says all the Mysteries the
[1:31:35] mysteries of God he's pointing to
[1:31:36] Revelation 10 7 that says that the
[1:31:38] sounding of the voice of the seventh
[1:31:40] angel the mystery of God should be
[1:31:41] finished and he says there's a bunch of
[1:31:42] mysteries in that mystery
[1:31:44] and he says one of them is the mystery
[1:31:47] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:31:50] sensation
[1:31:53] and that's where everybody stops
[1:31:55] that uses this quote wrong and they say
[1:31:58] see it's just accepting the word of God
[1:32:01] but then they don't continue and says
[1:32:03] but the person of Christ performing in
[1:32:06] you the same works that he did
[1:32:09] listen I don't know for sure but I don't
[1:32:12] imagine Mary knew when she was first
[1:32:14] pregnant
[1:32:15] the moment when conception happened was
[1:32:18] by the holy spirit so there was not
[1:32:20] necessarily A you know I don't want to
[1:32:22] be crude but when a man and a woman are
[1:32:24] together there is a sensation that comes
[1:32:26] with these things you know that
[1:32:27] something's going on you know that
[1:32:29] something's happened but because it's
[1:32:30] the holy spirit it's a supernatural
[1:32:32] birth there was no physical Sensation
[1:32:35] that would have accompanied this so Mary
[1:32:37] is pregnant and she doesn't even know it
[1:32:40] initially that's why brother Brahm says
[1:32:42] you can get the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:44] Ghost without sensation is because it's
[1:32:46] supernatural you may not feel it
[1:32:49] you may not know that you've got the
[1:32:51] Holy Ghost today
[1:32:52] but he says it's always followed by the
[1:32:55] person of Christ performing in you the
[1:32:57] same works that she did that he did
[1:33:00] so after a while guess what
[1:33:03] Mary's belly started to show that she
[1:33:06] was pregnant
[1:33:07] maybe she had morning sickness maybe she
[1:33:11] was getting really tired maybe her skin
[1:33:12] was starting to Glow
[1:33:15] everything in her was starting to change
[1:33:16] but for a little while she didn't even
[1:33:18] know if she was pregnant or not until
[1:33:20] she started to show
[1:33:23] and what brother Brian was getting at is
[1:33:24] he's saying listen you can shout and you
[1:33:27] can scream and you can dance and you can
[1:33:29] say amen and you can have all this
[1:33:30] wonderful time in the presence of God
[1:33:32] but he says that doesn't prove you've
[1:33:33] got the Holy Ghost
[1:33:35] he says the actual infilling of the Holy
[1:33:37] Ghost he says may be without sensation
[1:33:39] you can get that today he says but
[1:33:41] there's always an effect after you get
[1:33:43] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:45] and it's not just saying Amen to the
[1:33:47] word
[1:33:49] but it's the word living in you
[1:33:51] because listen after a while Mary
[1:33:52] started to show and in a while it was
[1:33:54] very obvious that Mary had the Word of
[1:33:56] Life inside of her wasn't it
[1:33:58] because she was pregnant and her belly
[1:33:59] got bigger and bigger and bigger
[1:34:02] listen I'm not saying you can't have
[1:34:03] sensation when you get the Holy Ghost I
[1:34:05] believe you will I did
[1:34:07] but that doesn't make it the proof the
[1:34:09] proof is not the sensation the proof is
[1:34:11] the life because listen there's been
[1:34:12] examples where women said I'm pregnant
[1:34:14] and guess what their belly started
[1:34:16] getting bigger and bigger and bigger but
[1:34:18] after the 10th month they had to
[1:34:19] recognize I was just chubby
[1:34:22] not pregnant
[1:34:23] because after nine months life must come
[1:34:26] forward you say you have the baptism of
[1:34:27] the Holy Ghost you've been filled with
[1:34:28] the holy spirit that means there has to
[1:34:30] be a life that comes forth and the proof
[1:34:33] is the life not the sensation you had at
[1:34:35] the moment you think you got it
[1:34:37] because you're going to have lots of
[1:34:38] Sensations in life you can have lots of
[1:34:40] Sensations in service you can have lots
[1:34:42] of Sensations under the preaching of the
[1:34:44] word but the proof is when what
[1:34:47] your life changes
[1:34:49] when something happens inside of you
[1:34:50] that's never happened before because you
[1:34:52] can have all the sensations of pregnancy
[1:34:54] and never get pregnant
[1:34:56] they have what's called a false
[1:34:57] pregnancy and you can literally feel
[1:34:58] like you're pregnant and show it in
[1:35:00] every way and not be pregnant
[1:35:02] there's got to be something that happens
[1:35:04] and if you have the Life of Christ in
[1:35:06] you it's going to show
[1:35:07] it's going to show
[1:35:09] what is it you'll talk a certain way
[1:35:12] that's not proof
[1:35:15] proof is not how you talk the proof is
[1:35:16] how you walk
[1:35:17] proof is how you live your life amen
[1:35:22] brother Perhaps it is and now the Christ
[1:35:24] in the church is just being made known
[1:35:27] this is 63. after the opening of the
[1:35:30] seals he says it's just being made known
[1:35:32] it's just starting to happen
[1:35:35] he says the whole thing is the
[1:35:36] revelation of God to take Eve back to
[1:35:39] her right position again with her
[1:35:40] husband he says notice God is the
[1:35:43] husband of the church and the church is
[1:35:44] his bride the new birth is Christ is a
[1:35:47] revelation God has revealed to you this
[1:35:50] great mystery and that's a new birth
[1:35:53] what is the New Birth when you realize
[1:35:55] you're a part of him
[1:35:57] how do you know you're a part of him
[1:35:59] because he's given you a part of him
[1:36:01] he's given you the Holy Ghost he's
[1:36:02] quickened the sea Gene of God inside of
[1:36:05] you and something changes and you
[1:36:07] recognize I'm a part of him I'm a part
[1:36:09] of the Bride I've been called out I've
[1:36:11] been positionally placed I've been
[1:36:13] predestinated to live different than
[1:36:14] I've been living all of my life
[1:36:16] he says now what are you going to do
[1:36:18] when you get all that group together
[1:36:21] where the Revelation is perfectly in
[1:36:23] harmony so we have to have the right
[1:36:25] revelation
[1:36:26] and and God expressing it through his
[1:36:30] word how by the same actions the same
[1:36:34] things he did making the word manifest
[1:36:38] so we can't just sit under a great
[1:36:39] revelatory ministry
[1:36:42] opening up the word and showing us the
[1:36:44] depths of the word but it has to produce
[1:36:46] a life it has to produce the works of
[1:36:48] Christ in our lives to confirm that he's
[1:36:51] with us because otherwise this is going
[1:36:53] to kill us
[1:36:54] it'll do it every time and will get dry
[1:36:56] and we'll get formal and we'll get
[1:36:57] starchy and we'll wonder where the
[1:36:59] victory went and it's because the spirit
[1:37:00] isn't quickening it in our lives
[1:37:03] he says the same things that he did
[1:37:06] making the word manifest we're in the
[1:37:08] time of the manifestation of the sons of
[1:37:09] God that's now it's here and he says
[1:37:12] it's just starting it's just being made
[1:37:14] known he says oh if the church only knew
[1:37:17] its position
[1:37:18] it will one day then the Rapture will go
[1:37:21] when it knows what it is
[1:37:25] so sure stop thinking that you're going
[1:37:27] to falter and fail
[1:37:28] stop thinking that you don't have what
[1:37:30] it takes that you don't have the right
[1:37:32] stuff
[1:37:33] he's already said he's given you
[1:37:35] everything you need
[1:37:36] and you've just got to mature and grow
[1:37:38] into it that's the only thing you have
[1:37:40] to do is say Lord let me grow and mature
[1:37:42] under the under the preaching the
[1:37:43] hearing of the word Lord let your Holy
[1:37:45] Spirit take effect in my life so that
[1:37:47] what I'm hearing becomes victory in my
[1:37:49] life that gives me quickening power that
[1:37:51] gives me overcoming power amen and on
[1:37:53] the other side
[1:37:55] don't you hate it when preachers do this
[1:37:57] stop thinking you'll make it because
[1:37:58] you're so good
[1:38:00] stop thinking you'll make it because
[1:38:01] you're so strong that's never going to
[1:38:04] get us across the Finish Line amen but
[1:38:06] what it is a work of Grace from start to
[1:38:08] finish and it's him that's going to
[1:38:09] carry us through all the way it's him
[1:38:11] that's going to clean us it's him that's
[1:38:13] going to make us a bride without spot or
[1:38:15] wrinkle
[1:38:16] as we close
[1:38:18] first Peter 5 8 says be sober
[1:38:21] be vigilant I'm not saying sit back I'm
[1:38:24] not saying relax
[1:38:27] he says be sober be vigilant because
[1:38:29] your adversary the devil has a roaring
[1:38:31] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:38:33] devour
[1:38:34] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[1:38:37] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:38:39] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:38:40] in the world in other words everybody's
[1:38:42] dealing with it
[1:38:43] maybe not the same thing you're dealing
[1:38:45] with but everybody's got a battle on
[1:38:47] their hands everybody God has a fight
[1:38:49] everybody's struggling everybody's
[1:38:51] looking for greater Victory everybody's
[1:38:52] looking for overcoming power everybody's
[1:38:54] looking to get out of here
[1:38:56] everybody
[1:38:58] don't think you're special in that sense
[1:39:00] he says but the God of all Grace who has
[1:39:03] called us unto his eternal glory by
[1:39:05] Christ Jesus after that you have
[1:39:07] suffered a while
[1:39:10] you're going to suffer a while
[1:39:13] he says after that he will make you
[1:39:15] perfect
[1:39:17] he will establish he will strengthen and
[1:39:20] he will settle you
[1:39:22] to him be glory and Dominion forever and
[1:39:26] ever
[1:39:27] amen amen God bless you and stand this
[1:39:30] morning
[1:39:31] listen like I said I'm not saying relax
[1:39:35] I'm saying relax about the outcome
[1:39:38] trust have faith believe be encouraged
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:42] but that doesn't mean stop fighting
[1:39:45] because you got to keep fighting
[1:39:47] but there's a victory that's been
[1:39:48] promised amen
[1:39:50] but it's what it's through the
[1:39:51] relationship with Christ it's through
[1:39:52] the overcoming power of the holy spirit
[1:39:54] that Victory is going to come so keep
[1:39:55] fighting
[1:39:57] don't stop don't slow down amen
[1:39:59] why
[1:40:01] because you're fighting is that what's
[1:40:03] going to get us the victory
[1:40:04] no the victory is because he said we're
[1:40:06] going to be an overcoming bride amen
[1:40:08] that we're going to have overcoming
[1:40:09] power there's nothing to go back to now
[1:40:12] there's nothing to go back to there's no
[1:40:14] turning back
[1:40:16] there's nothing behind us that's better
[1:40:17] than what we have here the best days are
[1:40:19] not behind us Church the best days are
[1:40:21] not behind us the best days are ahead of
[1:40:22] us and guess what there's going to be
[1:40:24] more battles and that means there's
[1:40:25] going to be more victories and there's
[1:40:27] going to be harder battles and that
[1:40:28] means there's going to be bigger
[1:40:29] victories and there's no turning back
[1:40:32] from these things we've got to go
[1:40:34] through it we've got to go through it
[1:40:37] Israel had to go through it for 10 years
[1:40:38] in the in the land of Canaan but they
[1:40:41] always kept pressing forward and God
[1:40:43] gave them Victory after Victory after
[1:40:45] Victory and all they had to do was stay
[1:40:47] true to what his word said that's it
[1:40:49] the only Covenant that's required of us
[1:40:51] now
[1:40:52] he didn't even say if you obey he said
[1:40:55] he swore by himself
[1:40:57] that's what takes us through is he swore
[1:40:59] by himself but he knows that he's got a
[1:41:01] bribe for destiny that she's going to
[1:41:03] obey and she's going to step right into
[1:41:05] her place in the word and she'll be
[1:41:07] perfect spotless without spot and
[1:41:09] without wrinkle that's you
[1:41:12] that's me by God's grace
[1:41:14] and always want us to do believe step
[1:41:17] into it and keep moving forward amen
[1:41:21] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[1:41:24] Lord we're so blessed this morning to
[1:41:26] know that we're going to make it
[1:41:28] well we're so blessed to know that
[1:41:30] there's overcoming power here Lord
[1:41:32] there's quickening power Lord there's
[1:41:34] Grace there's forgiveness there's Mercy
[1:41:36] there's peace there's rest there's joy
[1:41:38] Lord there's healing there's love
[1:41:40] Lord there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:43] experience Lord available to each and
[1:41:45] every one of us Lord and not just one
[1:41:47] feeling Lord but a refilling and a
[1:41:49] refilling and a growing and a raising of
[1:41:51] the standard of the Holy Spirit In Our
[1:41:53] Lives Lord that takes us to a greater
[1:41:54] walk Lord a deeper relationship with you
[1:41:57] and Lord I'm praying for us Lord each
[1:42:00] one of us from the pulpit all the way to
[1:42:01] the back doors Lord I'm praying that
[1:42:03] your spirit will pour out Among Us
[1:42:05] Heavenly Father Lord that you would lift
[1:42:07] us up Lord that you would just Lord Lord
[1:42:09] lift up weary hands and knees Lord that
[1:42:11] you would give us strength for the
[1:42:12] battle that you'd help us to keep
[1:42:14] plugging away Lord trusting Lord that
[1:42:16] we're going to see daylight soon
[1:42:18] nor would you just touch your people
[1:42:19] this morning I pray Lord and minister to
[1:42:22] hearts and souls I ask in Jesus Christ's
[1:42:24] name
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:28] let's sing that song something keeps
[1:42:29] holding me 7 51.
[1:42:32] 751.
[1:42:38] the trials of this life
[1:42:43] we're getting stronger
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:50] the pole I felt was more than I could be
[1:42:59] there
[1:43:02] oh and I was on the verge
