[35:09] we've had through the winter and the
[35:10] spring

[35:14] still with us after her her Airborne
[35:16] episode last night in her car but just
[35:18] trusting God's grace to help us sort
[35:21] that out certainly through the coming
[35:22] days as well but amen he guards us he
[35:24] protects us
[35:25] amen and if there's one thing we know
[35:27] that whatever happens to us he's got his
[35:29] hands in it amen when even when it's a
[35:32] car wreck even when it's sickness even
[35:33] when it's pain even when it's distressed
[35:36] these different things he's in it all
[35:37] amen he's he's the master planner and he
[35:40] knows exactly what to do to get us to
[35:42] the place he wants us amen amen Psalms
[35:44] 119 verse 9 says wherewithal shall a
[35:47] young man cleanse his way by taking heed
[35:50] there too according to Thy Word
[35:53] with my whole heart have I sought thee
[35:55] oh let me not Wander from thy
[35:57] Commandments Thy word have I hid in mine
[35:59] heart that I might not sin against thee
[36:02] blessed art thou O Lord teach me thy
[36:06] statutes amen you can have your seats
[36:07] this morning God bless you
[36:09] tomorrow I'm going to take my jacket off
[36:11] right away as we get into this and
[36:13] we're continuing the series on
[36:15] Redemption that we've been speaking on
[36:17] and and I wanted to take a title this
[36:19] morning of a tale of two sons and that
[36:22] maybe sounds a bit odd given how far we
[36:24] are into this series but I was speaking
[36:26] to some brothers after the last service
[36:27] and we had that wonderful service on the
[36:29] chastening and trying of God that Chad
[36:32] and Leah and their family were blessed
[36:33] to miss you know one of those uplifting
[36:36] sermons where we're talking about the
[36:37] hard the hardness that comes with the
[36:39] love of God and the teaching of God and
[36:41] the progression of God in our lives and
[36:43] I said well Brothers now we're going to
[36:44] have an uplifting service on Rebellion
[36:46] next and so this is that service but
[36:48] we're not going to speak on Rebellion
[36:50] perhaps in the way that you think and
[36:51] this is not a you know a pushing down
[36:53] sermon or what are you doing or what are
[36:55] you not doing or whatnot but we want to
[36:57] show you where the root of it is amen
[36:58] and how you get it out of your life and
[37:00] and how it's kind of progressed through
[37:02] through the scriptures and these
[37:03] different things so we want to take it
[37:04] from both sides we want to take it not
[37:06] from just a place of Disobedience but a
[37:08] place of obedience amen and if we want
[37:10] to not show you just what the wrong is
[37:11] but what the right is and how you can
[37:13] get from what one of those sides of to
[37:15] the others and the last service we spoke
[37:16] how God corrects his children and so
[37:18] often we take correction as the spanking
[37:20] but the correction is the showing the
[37:22] right way
[37:23] and you don't get disciplined until
[37:25] you're corrected first until God shows
[37:27] us what is right he does not discipline
[37:29] us for what we do not know God doesn't
[37:31] discipline us for our ignorance but what
[37:32] he disciplines us for is when we reject
[37:34] what he has showed us is right and then
[37:36] the discipline comes behind and it
[37:38] enforces the correction it enforces the
[37:40] right way in our life but we know that
[37:42] even regardless there's going to be
[37:43] tests in our life and even if you say
[37:45] yes Lord I accept your word I believe it
[37:47] it's true now the test comes and you've
[37:49] got to take it and put it into action in
[37:51] your life and we said last time that
[37:53] tests are hard there is no easy test
[37:56] tests are supposed to be hard they're
[37:57] supposed to challenge us they're
[37:58] supposed to get us to dig deep to really
[38:00] see if we truly understand these things
[38:02] but we also want to know that there's a
[38:03] difference between the disciplining of
[38:05] God and the difficulty and the pain that
[38:07] comes with that and the testing of God
[38:09] which is also difficult and painful many
[38:11] times amen but each one of those has
[38:13] come going to come to God's children but
[38:15] we've got to learn that what we do is
[38:17] going to have an effect with how God
[38:18] responds to us as well amen that we have
[38:21] a choice of how this is going to go and
[38:22] we can go the easier way which is God's
[38:24] way easier does not mean easy it just
[38:27] means less difficult and we can go the
[38:28] hard way and Hosea would talk about this
[38:31] he says for they have sown the wind and
[38:33] they shall reap the Whirlwind it had no
[38:35] stock and the bud shall yield no meal
[38:38] and if so be it yield The Strangers will
[38:40] swallow it up and the Amplified it says
[38:42] for they sow the wind and they shall
[38:44] reap the Whirlwind the standing grain
[38:47] has no heads it will yield no meal and
[38:49] if it were to yield strangers and Aliens
[38:52] would eat it up so in other words when
[38:53] you get out of line you sow something
[38:55] that is out of God word that's out of
[38:57] the will of God then what you're going
[38:58] to get is never going to be in the will
[39:00] of God you can't sow outside the will of
[39:02] God and reap the will of God you've got
[39:04] to come back to that place and then step
[39:06] back into his will into his word and
[39:08] then he can bless you and he says listen
[39:10] you sow the wind you're going to reap a
[39:11] whirlwind in other words you sow
[39:13] something lightly it'll come back way
[39:15] worse than what you sowed because it
[39:17] magnifies and it builds itself up and
[39:20] that's what Satan does because Satan is
[39:21] a destroyer so when you sow destruction
[39:23] then he sows more he he gets you to reap
[39:26] even more than you ever anticipated you
[39:28] know we have that song sin will take you
[39:29] further than you ever meant to go That's
[39:32] what Satan is as you saw one bad
[39:33] decision you make one thing that doesn't
[39:35] line up with the word and he'll turn it
[39:37] into 10.
[39:38] because that's what he's there to do
[39:40] he's here to destroy you he's healed to
[39:41] kill you he's here to ruin your family
[39:43] he's here to ruin your life as much as
[39:45] he can so you'd make one bad decision
[39:46] and unless you can quickly come back
[39:48] then he'll magnify that and all of a
[39:50] sudden that one little thing magnifies
[39:51] itself into a massive problem and he
[39:53] says and if if by chance you get
[39:56] something good out of it something good
[39:58] he says you won't even get the blessing
[40:00] of it somebody else will get the
[40:01] blessing if there's any good that comes
[40:03] out of what your decision was that was
[40:04] outside the word of God somebody else is
[40:06] going to get it you won't even get a
[40:07] blessing out of it you've got to come
[40:08] back to where you left to me man you
[40:10] can't sow Disobedience you can't sow
[40:12] self-will and somehow come out of it
[40:14] looking good
[40:15] and you're not going to get anything
[40:16] good out of it it doesn't work that way
[40:18] amen but God is Not unjust
[40:20] I mean God is Not unfair and he has his
[40:23] ways of training us and it seems hard at
[40:25] times but there's a purpose behind it
[40:26] all I spoke earlier of the master
[40:28] planner and he knows how to get us into
[40:30] shape if you ever look at a construction
[40:32] site when they first start building and
[40:34] it looks like it's just a mess of stuff
[40:36] laying around and and they're doing the
[40:38] earth works and it's just water and dirt
[40:39] and piles everywhere that's what our
[40:41] life looks like sometime and it's hard
[40:43] to look at it and you say there's no
[40:44] order to it it doesn't seem to make
[40:46] sense there's nothing coming in but as
[40:48] the master planner progresses then it
[40:50] starts to take shape and you start to
[40:51] understand hey there's something coming
[40:53] out of all of this mess and if we'll
[40:55] just stick with what he says to do
[40:57] rather than trying to form it ourselves
[40:58] it'll produce the building it'll produce
[41:00] the Tabernacle that he was looking to
[41:02] get us into amen but as I said there's a
[41:05] simpler way obedience and there's the
[41:07] hard way and that's Disobedience or
[41:09] rebellion and we see that these things
[41:10] start right in Genesis and and we're not
[41:13] going to go back to Eve because that was
[41:14] certainly the first Disobedience but
[41:16] we're talking about a tale of two sons
[41:17] and we've been talking about the
[41:19] adoption of sons and bringing Sons and
[41:21] Daughters of God into the place where
[41:22] God can truly use them and and trust
[41:24] them in these things but we see that all
[41:27] of these things have Roots both
[41:28] obedience and disobedience in Genesis
[41:30] there's nothing new Under the Sun the
[41:31] scripture says what we're dealing with
[41:33] today the spirits in this world the
[41:34] attitudes the Tendencies the ways we
[41:36] think it's been there since Genesis
[41:38] there's nothing new they're just coming
[41:40] up with it again and thinking they've
[41:41] come up with something new but we go to
[41:43] Genesis 4 and it says and Abel was a
[41:45] keeper of the sheep but Cain was a
[41:48] tiller of the ground so Cain was a
[41:49] farmer and Abel was a shepherd and in
[41:52] the process of time it came to pass that
[41:54] came brought of the fruit of the ground
[41:56] an offering unto the Lord
[41:58] this is a beautiful thing
[42:01] it's a beautiful thing he has done
[42:03] something he's produced something he's
[42:04] tended the fields he's done all his hard
[42:06] work and then he says Lord I want to
[42:08] give you some of what I have
[42:11] nothing wrong with this Hebrews 11 says
[42:14] Cain's sacrifice was excellent
[42:17] to look at it from the outside you would
[42:19] say this is a beautiful perfect
[42:21] sacrifice then it says in Abel he also
[42:24] brought of the first liens of his flock
[42:26] and of the fat thereof so Abel brought
[42:28] what he had available Cain brought what
[42:30] he had produced Abel brought what he had
[42:32] tended and produced and and they were
[42:34] both on the outside looking like it was
[42:37] the same thing
[42:38] different things physically but they
[42:40] both brought of what they had and you
[42:41] think that ought to be enough
[42:43] I'm bringing what I have what more could
[42:46] God ask of me
[42:47] but I want to set a stage here because
[42:49] we spoke in the first service of uh you
[42:51] know we talked about uh
[42:53] preparing for position and we talk about
[42:55] actions and works by faith and then we
[42:58] went into the the trials and the testing
[43:00] and the chastening of God in the second
[43:02] service but now we're coming into
[43:03] Revelation and obedience because
[43:06] Revelation without obedience is not true
[43:07] revelation
[43:09] and obedience without Revelation won't
[43:11] hold
[43:12] you'll get so far and then you'll stop
[43:13] because you've got to have an
[43:14] understanding that God is behind what
[43:16] you're doing in the first place listen
[43:18] to this quote he says it Cain and Abel
[43:20] both came to find favor with God both of
[43:23] them had the exact same purpose in
[43:25] coming
[43:27] amen he says now look Cain was a long
[43:29] ways from being a communist neither was
[43:31] he an atheist but Cain was a Believer he
[43:34] says get on your shockproof vest now
[43:36] Cain was a Believer and a worshiper of
[43:39] God
[43:40] if God only required a Believer came was
[43:44] just as just as Abel was
[43:48] and God would be unjust if he condemned
[43:50] Cain for his faith in him and accepted
[43:52] Abel if Faith was all he required
[43:56] now this sounds like it's almost
[43:57] blasphemy but I read quote after quote
[44:00] to give what he meant in this and I went
[44:02] through and searched it out and what
[44:03] he's saying is that Cain came expecting
[44:05] God to be happy with what he did that
[44:07] was his faith he brought it in
[44:09] expectation that it would be accepted by
[44:10] God that was his faith his faith was not
[44:13] a revelation from God his faith was that
[44:15] this is going to be good enough
[44:17] that's why he brought it if he didn't
[44:18] think I was accepted can accept it he
[44:20] wouldn't have brought it amen but what
[44:22] we have to understand is that we can be
[44:24] sincerely wrong
[44:26] you can be completely sincere you can be
[44:28] doing something that you believe is for
[44:30] God and be flat wrong
[44:32] and it's the best you can do and it's
[44:34] all you've ever been able to do but that
[44:36] doesn't make it right it just makes you
[44:37] sincere
[44:39] and that's what we've got understanders
[44:40] he said Cain is coming in sincere faith
[44:43] believing that what he's doing is the
[44:45] right thing and he says God doesn't
[44:46] judge him for that
[44:48] because he's the same as Abel in that in
[44:50] that regard he says but what all right
[44:52] but Cain came and offered a sacrifice
[44:54] Cain built an altar a church Cain made a
[44:58] sacrifice just the same as Abel did and
[45:00] came worshiped he never came as an
[45:02] unbeliever he came as a Believer he
[45:05] raised up his hands and worshiped God
[45:06] just the same as Abel did he says well
[45:09] if a church membership an altar worship
[45:11] of sacrifices all God requires then Cain
[45:13] was just as just as Abel was
[45:16] if you belong to church and go to church
[45:18] you've got your name on the church book
[45:20] you're a good tide pair a worshiper and
[45:22] insincerity that still isn't it that's
[45:25] right he says I don't want to hurt you
[45:27] but I've got to stand before judgment
[45:28] with you god requires more than that God
[45:32] requires all of that plus
[45:35] so don't say well I don't need to do
[45:37] that no you have to do that that's
[45:38] that's the the just the the basic
[45:40] requirements of being a Believer but he
[45:42] says God requires more than that and
[45:45] Cain was just as just on it as Abel was
[45:47] if that's all God requires now I want
[45:49] you to notice Cain built his big fine
[45:50] Altar and I can imagine him being a
[45:53] tiller of the soil he filled it full of
[45:54] Easter flowers and everything and made
[45:56] it beautiful but he was the nature of
[45:59] Satan
[46:00] today we have Chimes on the churches and
[46:03] plush pews and everything else trying to
[46:05] find favor with God and that's not God's
[46:07] way of finding favor
[46:09] he says but Cain laid his sacrifice down
[46:12] he knelt down on his knees and he raised
[46:14] up his hands and I can hear his
[46:15] beautiful prayer just how he rhymed it
[46:18] out just so in order and everything
[46:20] trying to find favor with Jehovah
[46:24] here is the works that I have brought
[46:26] and laid down I've built this church
[46:28] I've done these things I've worked hard
[46:31] and here's a part of what I've got I lay
[46:34] here I offer to you Jehovah he says can
[46:37] I find favor he wasn't an Infidel he was
[46:40] a fundamentalist he was just as
[46:42] fundamental as the other fellow was
[46:45] and Abel came not nothing beautiful he
[46:48] had a little old lamb of the flock he
[46:50] didn't work up he didn't do something or
[46:52] other he didn't try and make fine big
[46:53] churches he didn't build this that and
[46:55] the other he just went out there and
[46:56] wrapped a grapevine around a lamb's neck
[46:58] and come pulling him
[47:00] picked him up and laid him on the Rock
[47:01] he says I don't guess they had a Lansing
[47:03] that day so they just took a sharp Rock
[47:05] and pulled his little head back and
[47:07] began to beat him in the throat with it
[47:09] he says what a sight the blood began to
[47:11] sprinkle and bathe his little wool over
[47:13] like that and the poor little thing
[47:15] dying and bleeding
[47:18] you've got this beautiful altar of
[47:20] everything that Cain could produce and
[47:22] then Abel comes and he's cutting the
[47:24] throat of a lamb
[47:26] you'd say why would God accept that
[47:29] but he says God looked down from heaven
[47:31] and rewarded him
[47:34] both of them brought of what they had
[47:38] both of them brought what they thought
[47:39] was acceptable but God only rewarded one
[47:41] of these things
[47:44] now watch here
[47:46] we continue in Genesis 4. he says in
[47:48] Abel he also brought to the first lens
[47:49] of his flocking of the fat thereof it
[47:51] says and the Lord had respect unto Abel
[47:54] and to his offering Hebrews 11 says
[47:56] Abel's sacrifice was more excellent
[47:58] Keynes was excellent but Abel's was more
[48:00] excellent
[48:02] why what was the difference by Godly
[48:05] faith
[48:06] Abel
[48:07] brought a sacrifice Cain brought it with
[48:10] faith but it was his faith Abel brought
[48:12] it by a revelation of what was really
[48:13] going on in this situation and he says
[48:16] but what but unto Cain and to his
[48:17] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[48:20] very Roth and his countenance fell now
[48:22] looking at this carnally from the
[48:24] outside Cain has a right to be angry
[48:26] because Cain's looking at it from his
[48:28] side he's saying he brought what he
[48:29] could bring I brought what I could bring
[48:31] and God you're only recognizing his
[48:34] that's wrong that's not fair how could I
[48:37] have done any differently I don't have
[48:38] any sheep all I have is vegetables and
[48:41] fruit and these different things God I'm
[48:43] giving you the best I can give you why
[48:45] do you not accept it
[48:47] it says and the Lord said unto Cain why
[48:50] art thou wrath why are you angry Cain he
[48:52] says and why is thy countenance Fallen
[48:54] why do you have a long face why are you
[48:56] mad why are you sad he says if thou
[48:59] doest well shall thou not be accepted if
[49:01] you do well Cain won't I accept you and
[49:04] if thou doest not well sin lieth at the
[49:07] door and unto thee shall be his desire
[49:09] and thou shalt rule over him he says
[49:12] there if thou doest well shall thou not
[49:13] be accepted church if that's not the
[49:15] grace of God I don't know what is
[49:16] because Cain is sitting here he is not a
[49:19] True Believer he's a make-believer he's
[49:22] a physical proof of the original sin
[49:25] he's brought the wrong sacrifice and now
[49:28] he's angry with a God that will come
[49:30] down and speak with him
[49:32] when you're in the presence of God I
[49:34] don't know about you but I don't have a
[49:35] whole lot of words to speak
[49:38] when he comes personally like that
[49:41] I'm not talking a general anointing but
[49:42] when he comes down in a room when he
[49:44] comes down in your devotions when he
[49:46] comes down to sarson it's like he's
[49:47] right there I don't have a whole lot of
[49:49] words to say and Cain is talking back to
[49:51] God in an angry tone
[49:53] that showed there was something wrong on
[49:55] the inside was that God himself the
[49:58] great Jehovah came down to talk to this
[50:01] man that had nothing in him good and God
[50:03] said if you do what can't what Abel does
[50:05] I'll accept you Cain
[50:07] that's how messed up he was amen
[50:11] God is gracious he gives everybody a
[50:14] chance everybody gets one opportunity to
[50:17] accept or reject what God has for them
[50:18] amen listen but I want you to realize
[50:21] after verse 4 happened and Cain Sees God
[50:24] come down and have respect to Abel's
[50:26] offering the scripture isn't doesn't say
[50:28] what it is but if you look through the
[50:29] rest of scripture probably what happened
[50:31] is God consumed it by fire
[50:32] it was an obvious acceptance and as soon
[50:35] as that happens what happens is Cain has
[50:38] the opportunity now to make his
[50:40] sacrifice right
[50:41] he has seen what is acceptable and he
[50:44] has seen what everything else that is
[50:45] not acceptable so Cain has a decision
[50:47] here he can say all right I know what's
[50:50] right I'm gonna go get a lamb from Abel
[50:52] I'm going to trade what I've got for
[50:54] what he's got and bring that and
[50:55] sacrifice it and then God will accept me
[50:57] God doesn't even have to come and talk
[50:59] to Cain he should have been able to see
[51:01] God is has honored that that's what I
[51:04] need to do
[51:05] but Cain had a decision to make and he
[51:07] chose to go a different way
[51:09] that was his decision now that I see the
[51:11] right way will I do the right way or
[51:14] will I complain about it
[51:18] how many times have we done things right
[51:19] in our own eyes
[51:21] with sincerity
[51:24] with good intentions
[51:26] believing that that's what God wants us
[51:28] to do and then we come and find out
[51:30] it wasn't
[51:32] either by the fruits
[51:34] or because we come to a revelation of
[51:36] the word of God
[51:39] how many times does it happen listen
[51:41] I've I've told this many times over the
[51:43] pope but I gave four years of my life
[51:44] supporting a man that was living a
[51:46] pastor that was living a life of hidden
[51:48] sin
[51:49] that absolutely should have kept him out
[51:51] of the pulpit
[51:52] four years I gave to that man and I did
[51:54] it in sincerity as unto God
[51:57] as unto God not as unto that man as unto
[52:00] God and I gave four years of that my
[52:02] life to that man and then you come to
[52:04] find out that it was all on his part
[52:06] Hashem he was a deceiver and that's on
[52:08] him
[52:10] that's his problem but I'm sitting there
[52:12] and I've given four years of my life and
[52:13] you say was it a waste
[52:16] no it wasn't a waste because I learned
[52:19] after that that every man and every
[52:21] woman no matter their position no matter
[52:23] their gift no matter their calling is
[52:25] subject to the word of God and so
[52:27] especially especially Us in the ministry
[52:30] we have to be held accountable to this
[52:32] especially us it's a higher standard
[52:34] than anyone else because we have to
[52:36] handle it and we have to give it from a
[52:37] pure heart and so we have to be held
[52:39] accountable to this
[52:41] but I learned after that I don't care
[52:43] what your gift is I don't care if you
[52:45] see dreams I don't care if you see
[52:46] visions and I know brothers that do I
[52:49] don't care if you've got a gift of
[52:49] healing a gift of faith a gift of
[52:51] Prophecy I do not care if you go off of
[52:53] the word of God I'm going to have a
[52:55] conversation with you about it and if
[52:56] you will not come back to it then we
[52:58] cannot hold that Fellowship the same way
[53:01] as in I cannot give you that position
[53:03] that you're looking for I cannot give
[53:04] you that Authority because the authority
[53:06] we're looking for is the word not the
[53:08] men
[53:08] and I learned that and since then church
[53:10] I've gone through trial and tests after
[53:12] people trying to influence me Time After
[53:14] Time After Time and I don't care anymore
[53:16] I learned that lesson up front and God
[53:19] knew I needed that lesson so that I
[53:21] would be able to handle what was coming
[53:22] my way
[53:24] so it's not wasted but once I realized
[53:26] what was going on the question is what
[53:28] could I do with it and what did I do
[53:30] with it and we'll talk about that a
[53:31] little bit later amen
[53:33] but watch this
[53:34] watch this he's talking about Cain and
[53:37] he says but man never gives the Inside
[53:39] Man a chance to explain what is right so
[53:42] we have our man we have our human nature
[53:44] but he says the Inside Man is what
[53:46] that's the nature of God it's supposed
[53:48] to be the nature of God he says and our
[53:49] problem is as we let the carnal side
[53:51] raise up and we don't let the spiritual
[53:53] side come and show us what's going on
[53:55] and what we're supposed to be doing in
[53:56] the situation he says watch we find if
[53:59] he doesn't do it then what happens or he
[54:02] says he says therefore that's what
[54:03] causes the trouble watch we find if he
[54:06] doesn't do it then what happens we find
[54:07] that's his temper like Cain got up see
[54:10] right quick he was jealous he didn't
[54:12] like God to accept Abel's sacrifice
[54:14] instead of his he wanted to go too
[54:16] that's not a bad thing he wanted to go
[54:19] too but he wanted his own sacrifice he
[54:22] wanted his own way he said I want the
[54:25] results I want the acceptance but I
[54:27] don't want to do it God's way
[54:28] see instead of coming over to Abel and
[54:30] saying oh my brother I'm so happy that
[54:33] God has accepted now we
[54:36] you figured it out but now we've got a
[54:39] way that we know that Jova Jehovah
[54:41] accepts this way because he's proved it
[54:44] by receiving your sacrifice wouldn't
[54:46] that have been the thing to do he says
[54:48] but instead of that he got jealous
[54:52] that was his that was his the the
[54:54] turning point for Cain was when he knew
[54:57] what God would accept and he said no I'm
[54:59] not interested in that
[55:01] that's why it's good to have the older
[55:02] folks amongst us
[55:04] one of the many reasons
[55:06] is because they can show us what God has
[55:08] accepted
[55:10] and they can also show us what God
[55:11] hasn't accepted
[55:13] listen if you sit down and talk with
[55:15] anybody that's over 50 or 60 years old
[55:16] especially they'll say don't do this
[55:19] don't do that and don't go here and
[55:21] don't go there and wait and do all these
[55:23] different things they give us wisdom
[55:24] because they've learned by doing the
[55:26] wrong way what God doesn't accept and
[55:28] they've learned by doing the right
[55:29] things what God does accept and you know
[55:32] what they'll do every time they'll point
[55:34] you back to here because this is where
[55:36] they found the right way it wasn't just
[55:38] in muddling around until they found it
[55:39] but God showed it to them in his word
[55:41] and that's that's what we go back to
[55:43] every single time but this modern
[55:45] tendency and it's not a modern tendency
[55:47] because it's here in Genesis the modern
[55:49] tendency is because I think it's right
[55:51] because I feel it's right because it
[55:53] makes sense to me it is right
[55:55] and it's not
[55:57] this is right
[56:00] scripture says I'm God and I change not
[56:02] I changed not I was talking to a I was I
[56:05] was trying to find a helping brother
[56:07] brother Grant trying to find a car and I
[56:08] went to the the dealership close by and
[56:10] I was talking to a guy and we got to
[56:12] talking about some different things and
[56:14] and um
[56:16] and he was saying you know
[56:18] he said I I don't I don't think that
[56:20] that I've got to go to church to get to
[56:22] heaven
[56:23] he says I think if I do good things I'll
[56:25] make it
[56:28] well if you do good things in God's will
[56:30] according to his word you'll make it
[56:31] because you'll do everything he said in
[56:33] his word but what he was saying is if I
[56:35] do good things that I want to do
[56:37] I'll get to heaven
[56:39] that's what Cain did Cain did good
[56:42] things in his own sight with good
[56:44] intentions in all sincerity and Cain was
[56:46] a child of Perdition just like Judas was
[56:49] just like Esau was
[56:51] good intentions sincerity but off the
[56:53] word of God
[56:56] that can't be the way you're going to
[56:57] get in you're never going to get to
[56:58] heaven off the word of God certainly not
[57:00] as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[57:03] Proverbs 16 says this there is a way
[57:05] that seemeth right unto a man seems
[57:07] right
[57:09] there's no deceiver like the
[57:10] self-deceiver
[57:12] it says there's a way that seems right
[57:13] to a man but the way thereof are the
[57:16] ways of death there is one way there's
[57:18] one road to life
[57:20] Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth
[57:21] and the life and no man comes to the
[57:23] father except through me there's only
[57:24] one way to there's only one way to life
[57:26] but he says you make one wrongness you
[57:28] you take away that you think is right
[57:30] and it's not on the word of God it's not
[57:32] in line with the word of God he says and
[57:33] the that way singular are the ways of
[57:36] death the end of it is ways you make one
[57:38] decision that's wrong and Satan can take
[57:40] you to to death a bazillion ways he's
[57:43] got so many ways to get you off the path
[57:45] because once you're off the path it just
[57:46] branches and branches and branches and
[57:48] he keeps taking you and you can end up
[57:49] dead six ways past Sunday
[57:51] he's got all sorts of options as soon as
[57:53] you get off the word God's got one way
[57:54] Satan has many ways to take you away
[57:57] right Cain's opportunity the prophet of
[58:00] God was saying was that he could praise
[58:01] the Lord and say I was wrong but now I'm
[58:03] right as in now I know the way
[58:06] and if his true desire was to be
[58:08] accepted by God then Cain would have
[58:10] done it
[58:12] if his true desire was to be accepted by
[58:15] God he would have followed What God had
[58:17] shown to be right
[58:18] he had the opportunity but he turned it
[58:20] down and look at what Cain does church
[58:22] he doubles down on his mistake
[58:25] he doubles down on it he says I'm right
[58:27] God and you're wrong
[58:30] in the face of everything in front of
[58:33] him of all evidence pointing to Cain not
[58:35] being right he doubles down he says God
[58:37] I'm going to stick with my way
[58:41] I'm gonna stick with me because I was
[58:43] sincere
[58:44] because I brought what I thought was
[58:45] best and I'm going to stay right here
[58:47] Church he's pouting because he wasn't
[58:49] right
[58:52] that's not the way a child of God acts
[58:53] but when we see that things are right
[58:55] then we step into it and say yes Lord
[58:57] yes Lord I'll do it that way amen what's
[59:00] the problem is the problem can sacrifice
[59:02] not in and of itself
[59:04] because he didn't know any better church
[59:06] God doesn't condemn us for our ignorance
[59:09] he doesn't condemn us for what we don't
[59:10] know but he condemns us when we have
[59:12] been shown the truth and we turn away
[59:14] from it
[59:15] when we turn away from it remember the
[59:17] scripture scripture talks about God
[59:19] winking at our ignorance
[59:21] listen that's what the blood of Christ
[59:23] was there for is to cover our ignorance
[59:26] and it covers Us Even in our iniquity
[59:28] and that's God's grace to us amen but in
[59:30] our ignorance the blood of Jesus covered
[59:32] us through all of those Church ages for
[59:33] two thousand years since he died on the
[59:35] cross but now the word has been opened
[59:37] to us and we have no excuse
[59:39] we have no excuse and to turn it down
[59:41] now is Judgment because we know it we
[59:44] know what to do
[59:45] and we've got a cloud of witnesses
[59:46] around us that have showed us how to do
[59:48] it
[59:48] amen we have no excuse anymore
[59:51] but Kane's pouting because he wasn't
[59:52] right and then when God comes he comes
[59:55] back to him he says and if thou doest
[59:57] not well sin lieth at the door and unto
[59:59] thee shall be his desire
[1:00:01] and thou shalt rule over him so the
[1:00:03] problem isn't the sacrifice the problem
[1:00:05] is Cain
[1:00:06] the root of the problem is not what he
[1:00:08] did it's what's inside of him that
[1:00:10] refuses to allow him to to actually come
[1:00:12] to what God wants him to do what is it
[1:00:14] it's religious Pride
[1:00:16] that's all it was flat out church it's
[1:00:18] religious Pride that he said this is the
[1:00:20] way I want to worship and God if you
[1:00:21] don't accept it then I don't care
[1:00:24] and that's what we have today when we
[1:00:25] put a period after our worship when we
[1:00:27] put a period after what we believe
[1:00:28] because God is progressively revealing
[1:00:30] himself to us constantly and when we put
[1:00:32] a period down we become a denomination
[1:00:34] and God says Ichabod he writes Ichabod
[1:00:37] over the door the glory of the Lord is
[1:00:38] departed and he can't deal with us
[1:00:40] anymore because we've said I stop here
[1:00:43] I stop here
[1:00:44] I'm good with where I'm at
[1:00:46] regardless of what the word says Cain
[1:00:49] refused to lay his idea down and take
[1:00:51] God's provided way
[1:00:52] you know what Kane's error was he
[1:00:54] thought the sacrifice was about him
[1:00:57] he thought the sacrifice was about him
[1:00:59] because he said Abel's bringing the
[1:01:00] sacrifice and that's for Abel and I'm
[1:01:02] bringing one about me and then when God
[1:01:04] accepted Abel's sacrifice and refused
[1:01:06] Cain Cain said God is refusing me
[1:01:09] and he attached himself personally to
[1:01:11] that sacrifice
[1:01:13] but it wasn't about Cain it was supposed
[1:01:16] to be a representation for him before
[1:01:18] God and God said vegetables have no life
[1:01:21] in them fruit has no life in them it's
[1:01:24] the blood of the Lamb that has life in
[1:01:25] it there's a life for a life you've got
[1:01:27] to have a life that takes yours Cain I'm
[1:01:29] not turning you down I'm saying that
[1:01:30] that won't do
[1:01:32] he's just saying it won't work I'm not
[1:01:34] turning you down Cain I'm turning your
[1:01:36] sacrifice down but Cain had so attached
[1:01:38] himself to his work that he couldn't let
[1:01:40] it go
[1:01:41] and he said that's it that's it God I
[1:01:44] don't want any part of this anymore
[1:01:45] Abel was no less under the curse of sin
[1:01:47] than he then came was in the eyes of God
[1:01:50] they were both Sinners remember in James
[1:01:53] Wright brother Kingsley
[1:01:55] says if you offend him one you've
[1:01:56] offended in all
[1:02:00] so Cain and Abel were equal in the eyes
[1:02:02] of God in terms of their sinfulness
[1:02:04] so that's not the problem the problem is
[1:02:05] not their sinfulness the problem is did
[1:02:07] they bring the right thing Cain was
[1:02:09] ignorant when he gave a sacrifice and
[1:02:10] now God shows him this the correct way
[1:02:12] to do it and he says no
[1:02:15] that's when we show what's really inside
[1:02:16] of us is When God says here's the way to
[1:02:18] do it and we say nope I'm going to
[1:02:19] double down I'm going to be stubborn
[1:02:24] let me continue this quote we started
[1:02:26] earlier he says every Easter you go to
[1:02:27] church and they bid you Merry Christmas
[1:02:29] because they won't see you till more
[1:02:31] till Christmas
[1:02:33] people that come to church once twice
[1:02:35] three times a year
[1:02:36] right that's not the way we go to church
[1:02:38] is it scripture says forsake not the
[1:02:40] assembling of yourselves together all
[1:02:41] the more as you see the final day
[1:02:43] approaching
[1:02:44] he says he says they won't see you
[1:02:47] anymore till Christmas come to Easter to
[1:02:49] show off a new head or a new Bonnet or a
[1:02:51] new suit of clothes bring up a big arm
[1:02:52] full of Easter flowers and throw them on
[1:02:54] the altar he says God doesn't want
[1:02:56] Easter flowers on the altar he wants you
[1:02:58] on the altar you're the one that belongs
[1:03:00] on the altar but see how he got away no
[1:03:02] matter we can't believe for Divine
[1:03:04] Healing you got the carp before the
[1:03:06] horse you got to get the thing running
[1:03:07] right before you can believe right he's
[1:03:10] saying you've got to be put in order you
[1:03:11] got to come to the truth before you can
[1:03:13] get the results of the truth he says you
[1:03:15] got to get this right up here
[1:03:17] and right down here in your heart before
[1:03:19] you can see right
[1:03:21] members Jesus said you can't even
[1:03:23] understand the kingdom of God without
[1:03:25] the new birth
[1:03:26] without the Holy Spirit you can't even
[1:03:28] understand God's intentions for this
[1:03:29] world
[1:03:30] you just don't see it brother I'm saying
[1:03:32] what he's pointing us back he's saying
[1:03:33] you got to get your mind you got to get
[1:03:34] the mind of Christ and you got to get
[1:03:36] the holy spirit in your heart and then
[1:03:37] you'll see right and you'll be able to
[1:03:39] push through
[1:03:40] he says you've got to have something in
[1:03:42] here to believe with before you can
[1:03:45] believe
[1:03:46] what's he saying he's saying Cain
[1:03:48] refused to lay his ideas
[1:03:50] Cain refused to lay himself on the Altar
[1:03:52] and say Lord consume this consume me
[1:03:55] and when he refused to lay that down
[1:03:57] then what happened is God had to turn
[1:03:59] away from him and really Cain turned
[1:04:00] away from God God stayed there God
[1:04:03] stayed there and Cain had to walk away
[1:04:05] from it all
[1:04:07] Cain said if my way isn't good enough
[1:04:09] I'm not going to do anything else
[1:04:11] prophet of God said you will fight your
[1:04:13] way to hell
[1:04:15] he says because God keeps putting things
[1:04:17] in front of you
[1:04:19] to keep you from going that way and he
[1:04:21] says he brings you to church he brings
[1:04:23] songs he brings ministers he brings the
[1:04:25] word of God he brings all these things
[1:04:26] he says and you've got to fight your way
[1:04:28] to get through all of those to get to
[1:04:29] hell because God is not willing that any
[1:04:31] should perish
[1:04:32] but he says so you're fighting your way
[1:04:33] through and that's what Cain was doing
[1:04:34] here his religious Pride got up and he
[1:04:36] refused to move forward
[1:04:39] he says God interprets his own word by
[1:04:41] its terms that he spoke in see Cain said
[1:04:43] I'm religious I'm a lover of my maker I
[1:04:45] offer to thee this fine altar I offer to
[1:04:48] you the sacrifice I built all these
[1:04:50] things up Lord because I love you
[1:04:52] he said Abel said the same thing now
[1:04:54] it's the one that's Vindicated the one
[1:04:56] that's proven God came down and received
[1:04:59] Abel's sacrifice because by Revelation
[1:05:01] he had struck the true channel of God
[1:05:04] that was accepted the only difference
[1:05:06] between two of them one had a real
[1:05:07] Revelation the other one didn't
[1:05:09] same sincerity same good intentions
[1:05:13] why did God receive Abel and condemn
[1:05:15] Cain because Abel had recompense unto
[1:05:18] the reward because he had a spiritual
[1:05:20] Revelation a spiritual revelation of the
[1:05:22] will of God in there in that Revelation
[1:05:25] Abel offered his sacrifice and then we
[1:05:28] see there coming up in the beginning two
[1:05:30] Spirits one unable and one on Cain both
[1:05:33] of them religious both of them at the
[1:05:35] altar both of them confessing both of
[1:05:38] them Believing on God he says but one
[1:05:40] had the vision and the other did not
[1:05:44] doing the exact same thing and getting
[1:05:46] completely different results Church
[1:05:47] except for one thing one brought an
[1:05:50] acceptable Sacrifice by revelation
[1:05:53] Hebrews 11 says by faith
[1:05:56] God comes down to Cain and he says Cain
[1:05:58] I don't even require you to have a
[1:06:00] revelation
[1:06:01] he says I'll give it to you on simple
[1:06:03] obedience
[1:06:05] simple obedience
[1:06:07] Kane just copy what Abel did and I'll
[1:06:10] accept you
[1:06:11] that's how gracious God is church
[1:06:14] that you can just copy what somebody's
[1:06:16] doing in this case and he'll accept you
[1:06:19] you're the seed of the serpent
[1:06:22] you're not a manifested son of God but
[1:06:24] I'll accept you if you'll do exactly
[1:06:26] what he says and he refused why because
[1:06:28] it wasn't in him to Humble himself to
[1:06:30] God it just wasn't in him he couldn't do
[1:06:33] it
[1:06:34] listen if we put it into plain language
[1:06:36] Cain refused to repent
[1:06:39] we look at repentance kind of as a as a
[1:06:41] bad thing so many times and it's not
[1:06:43] it's our access to God is repentance so
[1:06:46] first thing Acts 2 38 says they said
[1:06:48] what can we do what must we do and Peter
[1:06:50] says repent
[1:06:51] first thing you got to do is repent then
[1:06:53] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:55] from the remission of sins and then you
[1:06:56] receive the Holy Ghost but the first
[1:06:58] thing you got to start is with
[1:06:59] repentance and what happens is our pride
[1:07:01] Rises up and we can't admit that we were
[1:07:03] wrong
[1:07:05] we kind of admitted spiritually we can't
[1:07:07] admit it mentally we can't admit it
[1:07:09] physically we can't admit it in our
[1:07:10] day-to-day lives and something pulls up
[1:07:12] and that's not the nature of God
[1:07:14] it's not the nature of God that pulls us
[1:07:16] up and says I refuse to admit I've been
[1:07:17] wrong all this time
[1:07:19] and sometimes we have been wrong for a
[1:07:21] long time
[1:07:22] I spent four years
[1:07:24] being wrong
[1:07:26] if I could put it that way
[1:07:28] but we've got to be able to come and
[1:07:30] admit it and say I am wrong and there is
[1:07:32] a right way and that's what I'm
[1:07:33] interested in is the right way not in my
[1:07:36] what this facade I built up of a
[1:07:39] reputation or whatever it might be
[1:07:41] sometimes what it is is our clear
[1:07:43] conscience in ignorance says I don't
[1:07:46] need to repent because I did it with the
[1:07:47] best of intentions
[1:07:49] repentance is not because you knew you
[1:07:51] were wrong repentance is because you are
[1:07:53] wrong
[1:07:54] and so it repentance does not come with
[1:07:56] excuses
[1:07:57] repentance is I am wrong
[1:08:00] that's it that's it
[1:08:02] if I do something wrong I don't go to
[1:08:05] somebody and say I was wrong and here's
[1:08:07] why I did it
[1:08:09] I go and I say I was wrong can you
[1:08:12] forgive me will you forgive me and
[1:08:13] that's it we leave the excuses out
[1:08:15] because no excuse will stand before God
[1:08:18] don't waste your time don't waste his
[1:08:19] time take your time and make things
[1:08:21] right
[1:08:22] but we're looking at two Spirits here
[1:08:24] we're talking about two sons with
[1:08:25] completely different spirits on them but
[1:08:27] listen we can be sincerely but
[1:08:29] ignorantly wrong but when we come to the
[1:08:31] knowledge of the truth what we do there
[1:08:33] is what defines us
[1:08:34] not that we were wrong it's what did we
[1:08:36] do after we found out what was right
[1:08:38] because we were all wrong
[1:08:40] we're all wrong the scripture says while
[1:08:41] we were yet sinners Christ died for us
[1:08:43] and gave his life for us
[1:08:44] we were all wrong at some point and
[1:08:46] we're all wrong in some way right now
[1:08:48] because we're still here
[1:08:50] the resurrection hasn't happened the
[1:08:52] Rapture hasn't happened God's still
[1:08:53] working on us so that means there's more
[1:08:56] to be had and that means there's more to
[1:08:57] let go
[1:08:58] there's areas that aren't completely
[1:09:00] clear in our life that aren't completely
[1:09:01] in line with the word so we've got to be
[1:09:03] able to say I'm wrong
[1:09:04] Lord Make Me Right show me what's right
[1:09:07] Cain was not judged because he brought
[1:09:09] the wrong sacrifice he was judged
[1:09:11] because he refused to bring the right
[1:09:12] one when he knew it amen when that truth
[1:09:15] is laid before us and we realize we're
[1:09:17] off the word of God we're out of the
[1:09:18] will of God that's where we show our
[1:09:19] true colors what will we do now
[1:09:21] what will we do now
[1:09:25] I spoke of the supporting that Pastor
[1:09:27] when it was all said and done the blame
[1:09:29] could not be on that man
[1:09:30] the blame had to be on me for my part
[1:09:33] because I had to go back and see how can
[1:09:35] a Son of God be fooled
[1:09:39] we can be fooled Church
[1:09:42] we can be fooled and how do we get
[1:09:44] fooled we get off of the word of God in
[1:09:46] some fortune and all it is is a little
[1:09:48] bit sometimes and it opens up this big
[1:09:50] blind spot in our life and what it was
[1:09:52] was that man that man there were red
[1:09:54] flags
[1:09:55] little red flags but red flags
[1:09:57] nonetheless
[1:09:58] where it was showing that he wasn't as
[1:10:00] committed and he wasn't putting the the
[1:10:02] the the focus on the things of God and
[1:10:04] different things and he was flighty
[1:10:06] maybe I could put it that way you can't
[1:10:08] have a flighty pastor doesn't work
[1:10:11] he was a pastor and he wasn't acting
[1:10:12] like a pastor and that in and of itself
[1:10:14] should have been a red flag but I didn't
[1:10:16] go to the word and say listen
[1:10:18] There's issues here and we got to talk
[1:10:20] about it why because he was my best
[1:10:22] friend because he had a gift of ministry
[1:10:24] and we enjoyed his preaching but that
[1:10:26] wasn't it that's never enough gifts and
[1:10:28] callings are without the repentance of
[1:10:30] scripture says we still have to be held
[1:10:31] to the word and I had to be able to go
[1:10:33] to that man
[1:10:34] and and make it right get it right with
[1:10:37] him I had to do the hard work of getting
[1:10:38] it right I had to tell my wife I was
[1:10:40] wrong and I had to tell the church I was
[1:10:41] wrong
[1:10:43] because if I can admit I messed up then
[1:10:45] how's God going to take me forward
[1:10:47] men with our families we've got to be
[1:10:49] able to say I led us wrong I let
[1:10:51] something in that I shouldn't have I put
[1:10:53] something out that I shouldn't have
[1:10:54] we've got to be able to Humble ourselves
[1:10:56] and say I'm wrong and I Repent of it and
[1:10:58] I'm going to go the right way otherwise
[1:11:00] how can God deal with us as Sons
[1:11:02] the the first nature of the laodicean
[1:11:05] age and we'll get to in a little bit is
[1:11:06] that of repentance for the True Believer
[1:11:08] it's an age of repentance for us
[1:11:12] but the laodicean spirit this final age
[1:11:14] resists repentance
[1:11:16] it resists repentance it's a spirit
[1:11:18] that's tied to the idea of that I am
[1:11:20] right and I don't need anybody else
[1:11:22] to tell me I'm wrong I don't want to
[1:11:23] hear it I can't hear it I'm not willing
[1:11:25] to hear it I'm right because I'm right
[1:11:28] I'm right because I'm sincere
[1:11:31] I'm right because there's nothing in me
[1:11:32] that says I'm wrong
[1:11:34] even though
[1:11:36] this is screaming out and saying you're
[1:11:37] off
[1:11:39] but what they do is they put this away
[1:11:42] and then they say I'm good to go
[1:11:44] because they won't take it back to the
[1:11:45] absolute
[1:11:48] prophet of God is quoting Revelation 3
[1:11:49] 17 it says I have need of nothing now
[1:11:52] when anybody says I have need of nothing
[1:11:54] he could very well be saying I have
[1:11:55] everything or he could be saying I don't
[1:11:58] want any more as I am full now you can
[1:12:01] express this any way you want and it all
[1:12:03] adds up to the fact that the church is
[1:12:05] completion complacent she is satisfied
[1:12:08] with what she has she either figures she
[1:12:11] has it all or has enough he says and
[1:12:14] that is exactly what we find today
[1:12:20] I've got everything I need period
[1:12:23] I know it all period I'm good to go
[1:12:26] period
[1:12:28] I'm content where I'm at period
[1:12:31] it shows there's something wrong inside
[1:12:33] of you when you do those sorts of things
[1:12:34] amen
[1:12:37] there was the famous Fellowship last
[1:12:39] year sometime where I said something
[1:12:42] small
[1:12:43] and uh and I was wrong
[1:12:47] and I stood up
[1:12:49] and I said on video
[1:12:51] I am wrong and brother Joe Coffey put it
[1:12:55] on video
[1:12:57] so that we could enjoy it for the many
[1:12:59] many decades to come
[1:13:02] now that's a small thing
[1:13:05] but do you think that felt good to me as
[1:13:07] much as a joke as it was and it was a
[1:13:08] small deal I had to swallow Pride to do
[1:13:11] that
[1:13:12] because if I can't do it in the little
[1:13:14] things
[1:13:15] how am I going to do it in the big
[1:13:16] things
[1:13:18] listen wrong is wrong
[1:13:20] and we've got to be able to admit it
[1:13:21] when we get off the path
[1:13:24] I laughed and I joked about it but it
[1:13:26] wasn't fun to me as in I did not enjoy
[1:13:28] it but I could appreciate it
[1:13:31] because I'm rarely wrong publicly
[1:13:35] it's said of the curlets that we
[1:13:37] practice in private so that we're
[1:13:38] perfect in public
[1:13:40] and that can be a spirit
[1:13:42] it's good for us
[1:13:44] all of us not just us curlets
[1:13:47] to say we're wrong publicly from time to
[1:13:48] time
[1:13:50] especially if we are wrong
[1:13:51] especially if we are wrong amen
[1:13:54] listen to this he says when you can see
[1:13:55] a man that's wrong
[1:13:57] and proven wrong
[1:13:59] proven wrong when the evidence is right
[1:14:01] before us he says then that shows he
[1:14:04] wants to be a Christian he walks up and
[1:14:06] says I am wrong that's a real Christian
[1:14:08] but that guy that'll all blow up and run
[1:14:10] around to one side and say oh there
[1:14:12] wasn't nothing to it and like this watch
[1:14:14] out brother you can see right then that
[1:14:16] he went out under condemnation because
[1:14:18] he wasn't of us
[1:14:20] can't accept correction
[1:14:25] he says be zealous and repent he says
[1:14:27] now this false church has Zeal make no
[1:14:29] mistake about it
[1:14:31] Zeal is not what makes us a Christian
[1:14:33] sincerity is not what makes us a
[1:14:35] Christian
[1:14:36] being like Christ is what makes us a
[1:14:38] Christian
[1:14:40] the word Christian is just bandied
[1:14:42] around like any word these days and it
[1:14:44] can mean anything and it means
[1:14:45] everything and yet it rarely means
[1:14:46] exactly what it's supposed to which is
[1:14:48] Christ like
[1:14:51] he says her Zeal has literally been that
[1:14:55] of the Jews in John 2 17 the Zeal of
[1:14:57] thine house hath eaten me up
[1:15:00] drives God nuts annoys him to no end he
[1:15:04] says but it is a wrong Zeal it is for
[1:15:06] what the house of their own building
[1:15:09] it is for their own Creeds their dogmas
[1:15:11] organizations their own righteousness
[1:15:14] they have put the word out for their own
[1:15:16] ideas they depose the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:19] made men into leaders they have put
[1:15:21] aside eternal life as a person and make
[1:15:24] it good works or even Church Conformity
[1:15:27] rather than good works
[1:15:29] good works would be one thing there are
[1:15:31] people that are going to get into into
[1:15:32] heaven on Good Works
[1:15:35] but that's not the way you want to get
[1:15:36] in
[1:15:37] you want to get in under the blood of
[1:15:38] the Lamb by the holy spirit that
[1:15:40] baptizes you into the body of Christ
[1:15:43] I don't want to fall back on works I
[1:15:44] want my Works to have nothing to do with
[1:15:46] it
[1:15:47] and then that's the way that he's
[1:15:48] intended for it he said but God is
[1:15:50] calling for another Zeal it is the Zeal
[1:15:53] to cry I am wrong now who's going to say
[1:15:57] that he is wrong what is it that all of
[1:15:59] these denominations are based upon the
[1:16:01] claim to originality and that of God
[1:16:05] my wife and I were talking about this
[1:16:06] the other day how do we know we're right
[1:16:08] we all say we're right
[1:16:11] every single one of us says we're right
[1:16:13] how do we know it
[1:16:15] he says the claim that they are right
[1:16:17] now they all cannot be right
[1:16:20] in fact not one of them is right they
[1:16:22] are whiteed sepulchers full of dead
[1:16:24] men's bones he's quoting Jesus words
[1:16:26] they have no life they have no
[1:16:28] Vindication God has never made himself
[1:16:31] known in any organization now listen to
[1:16:33] this church they say they are right
[1:16:36] because they are the ones that are
[1:16:37] saying it
[1:16:40] but saying it does not make it so
[1:16:44] they need the Vindicated thus saith the
[1:16:46] Lord of God and they don't have it
[1:16:49] and that's what Cain refused to do he
[1:16:51] couldn't knuckle down and say I don't
[1:16:53] have what I thought I had
[1:16:56] that's the what that is is humility
[1:16:59] Church
[1:17:00] and that is access to God
[1:17:02] when you say Lord
[1:17:04] my spoken testimony
[1:17:06] is higher than my lived testimony
[1:17:10] that's a wonderful place to be if you
[1:17:12] can recognize it and admit it
[1:17:14] but if not sin lies at the door
[1:17:18] because you won't step out and say I'm
[1:17:19] wrong and I need to be made right I need
[1:17:22] to come to a higher plane I need to go
[1:17:23] to another level Lord
[1:17:25] what happened with Cain after this
[1:17:26] that's what always happens jealousy and
[1:17:28] unintended consequences
[1:17:32] Pride flares up and he goes and he kills
[1:17:34] his brother and it's the first it's the
[1:17:36] first murder that's that's that's
[1:17:37] recorded in in history and it's all on
[1:17:39] the basis of religious Pride
[1:17:42] religious Pride came wanted to serve God
[1:17:43] his own way and that led him to
[1:17:45] persecuting the true Son of God that was
[1:17:47] with him
[1:17:48] listen to this we find out that Abel
[1:17:50] because God had received him and he did
[1:17:52] not receive Cain's beautiful big
[1:17:53] offering he had toiled so hard for
[1:17:57] Cain worked hard for his
[1:17:59] no denying his work ethic
[1:18:02] and Cain was religious and bowed down
[1:18:04] and worshiped and so forth did
[1:18:05] everything that Abel did only he didn't
[1:18:07] have the revelation of what was the
[1:18:09] truth so we find out that when God
[1:18:11] accepted Abel's Revelation and his
[1:18:13] offering it made Cain jealous of Abel
[1:18:15] and there was the first murder we find
[1:18:17] out that jealousy become between the
[1:18:18] herdsmen of Abraham and lot and they had
[1:18:20] to separate we find out that Moses and
[1:18:22] Korra had a clash also Jesus and Judas
[1:18:25] had a clash and as ever it's been the
[1:18:28] same thing and so it is today the
[1:18:30] natural church and the spiritual church
[1:18:31] has a clash when they come together now
[1:18:34] the natural tries to match the spiritual
[1:18:36] always with a carnal impersonation but
[1:18:39] as it was with isan Jacob it will not
[1:18:42] work God has his church called named set
[1:18:46] aside and in the age that she lives in
[1:18:49] he'll reveal himself to her each and
[1:18:52] every time
[1:18:53] what a consolation that ought to be for
[1:18:55] us church that in an age when everybody
[1:18:57] thinks they have it all they know it all
[1:18:59] that they have need of nothing God will
[1:19:01] come and he'll reveal to his true
[1:19:02] children who and what he is and their
[1:19:04] part to play in all of this it says just
[1:19:07] as he said in Romans the eighth chapter
[1:19:08] that the foreknowledge or predestination
[1:19:10] of God might stand sure so in other
[1:19:13] words we don't have to worry about are
[1:19:14] we going to get to the other side
[1:19:18] what we have to worry about is are we
[1:19:19] going to go his way
[1:19:21] are we going to go our way until we get
[1:19:23] sick of it and come back to his way I've
[1:19:25] said it before we're going to come
[1:19:26] easier we're going to go hard
[1:19:29] the easy way is the easier way God's way
[1:19:31] it's not that it's easy but it's easier
[1:19:33] it's more direct and it has it has it
[1:19:36] has fruit all the way through it has
[1:19:37] benefits all the way through our way is
[1:19:40] sewn with everything else and nothing
[1:19:42] good can come out of it
[1:19:43] all he's asking us to do is take it as
[1:19:46] he gives it
[1:19:48] you don't have to try and jump ahead
[1:19:50] just stay faithful to what God has shown
[1:19:52] you now
[1:19:53] and when you do that then he opens up
[1:19:55] the next chapter
[1:19:56] it's Progressive God progressively
[1:19:58] reveals himself to his children he
[1:20:00] progressively grows as and matures us
[1:20:01] from spiritual children into full-grown
[1:20:03] adults with him
[1:20:05] don't don't don't worry if you're not
[1:20:07] too a full adult worry are you the same
[1:20:09] as you were last month
[1:20:10] because he never stops
[1:20:12] and so that means we don't stop if we
[1:20:14] stop we're backsliding because the child
[1:20:16] of God is always moving forward he's
[1:20:18] always she is here she is always growing
[1:20:20] we're talking on this tale of two sons
[1:20:22] and if we look at isan Jacob like he
[1:20:24] talked about here we see a similar issue
[1:20:26] but with it's even more in contrast here
[1:20:27] because unlike Cain and Abel where Cain
[1:20:29] was obviously the bad one when you look
[1:20:31] at isan Jacob on the face of it Jacob
[1:20:34] was the bad one and Esau was the better
[1:20:36] one
[1:20:38] Esau was Jacob was the shyster Jacob was
[1:20:40] the cheater Jacob was the one that was
[1:20:42] always trying to work the Angles and get
[1:20:44] the better deal on somebody Jacob was
[1:20:46] always trying he was always in it for
[1:20:48] him in every single way and yet he was
[1:20:50] the elected predestinated Son of God
[1:20:52] Esau on the other hand stayed home he
[1:20:54] was faithful to his mama faithful to his
[1:20:56] daddy and these different things but his
[1:20:58] attitude towards the things of God
[1:20:59] proved what he really was
[1:21:02] but currently speaking we would say that
[1:21:04] Esau was the better man than Jacob
[1:21:06] and he saw it when he turned down the
[1:21:08] blessing when he sold it he had good
[1:21:09] Logic for and he says if I'm dead what
[1:21:11] good is the blessing to me I'll give you
[1:21:13] the blessing I'll give you the the the
[1:21:15] firstborn blessing for some of that stew
[1:21:17] so I can live to fight another day
[1:21:19] he had good reason for it and that
[1:21:21] showed that his interest was more in the
[1:21:23] short term rather than the long term
[1:21:25] did he really think he was going to die
[1:21:28] if he really stopped to think about it
[1:21:29] he'd know somebody would have given him
[1:21:31] food at some point he'd have made it
[1:21:32] through but he said no I'll give the
[1:21:33] blessing up for food right now Jacob on
[1:21:35] the other hand cheated his way through
[1:21:37] life
[1:21:38] constantly cheated constantly trying to
[1:21:40] get the better deal constantly trying to
[1:21:42] do what the other person didn't
[1:21:43] anticipate so he could enrich himself
[1:21:45] time and time again then he goes he runs
[1:21:47] away because Esau is going to kill him
[1:21:49] and what does he do he gets a taste of
[1:21:50] his own medicine doesn't he he goes to
[1:21:52] Laban and he falls in love with Rachel's
[1:21:54] with his daughter Rachel and and he
[1:21:56] tells Laban I'll work for her seven
[1:21:58] years and he worked seven years and it
[1:22:00] comes down to the wedding and he gets
[1:22:02] drunk and Laban puts his other daughter
[1:22:04] Leah in the bedroom with them instead of
[1:22:05] Rachel
[1:22:06] you got to be drunk to realize that
[1:22:08] you're you're your wife's sister in the
[1:22:11] room with you he was out of it and he
[1:22:13] fooled him and so now he's married to
[1:22:14] Leah and he can't get Rachel and so and
[1:22:17] so Laban says we'll work another seven
[1:22:19] years and I'll give you Rachel he works
[1:22:21] 14 years to get one wife he wanted and
[1:22:22] one he didn't
[1:22:24] what was it God was showing him you can
[1:22:26] sow your way
[1:22:28] it'll come around
[1:22:29] but you're going to pay a big price for
[1:22:31] it Jacob and even after that Jacob was
[1:22:33] always trying to flip things
[1:22:35] and God always blessed them
[1:22:37] that's the amazing thing God always
[1:22:39] blessed him and you say brother John how
[1:22:40] does that work because there was going
[1:22:42] to come a time where God was going to
[1:22:43] take it all away if he didn't line up
[1:22:45] and what happens is he heads back home
[1:22:47] and then he he finds out that Esau is on
[1:22:49] the way and he's got 400 men with him
[1:22:51] and he knows that he's going to lose all
[1:22:52] of his wealth and he's probably going to
[1:22:53] lose his life
[1:22:54] and then what does Jacob do
[1:22:57] Jacob goes and he wrestles
[1:23:00] and he holds on until he gets a change
[1:23:03] because what he knows that if he loses
[1:23:06] his life
[1:23:07] his wealth is no good to him
[1:23:09] everything he's fought for everything
[1:23:10] he's struggled for everything he's he's
[1:23:12] cheated for is not worth anything
[1:23:15] and Jacob goes and he holds on until the
[1:23:17] change happens where
[1:23:19] in the situation
[1:23:21] in the circumstance no Jacob holds on
[1:23:23] until there's a change in here
[1:23:26] church so often what's happening is
[1:23:28] we're looking at the situation and we're
[1:23:30] praying for the circumstances change and
[1:23:32] what God is waiting for you to do is
[1:23:33] realize I am wrong and the change needs
[1:23:36] to happen in here
[1:23:37] the change has to happen in here and
[1:23:39] that way when what what whatever comes
[1:23:42] to life
[1:23:43] whatever Storms Come whatever Trials
[1:23:45] come then we stand assured because why
[1:23:47] the change has been in here like David
[1:23:49] wrote in Psalms 23 the Lord is my
[1:23:51] shepherd I shall not want he's
[1:23:53] surrounded by soldiers he's surrounded
[1:23:55] by by Saul's Army he's surrounded by
[1:23:57] trials and tribulations and in the midst
[1:23:59] of that he can say the Lord is my
[1:24:01] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[1:24:03] to lie down in Green Pastures he leads
[1:24:06] me besides Still Waters deep Waters he
[1:24:08] restores my soul yea though I walk
[1:24:10] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:24:12] death I will fear no evil why because
[1:24:14] David had something in here that had
[1:24:16] changed and that's what held him through
[1:24:19] those times
[1:24:20] he didn't say God take away the enemy he
[1:24:22] said God give me peace and then he
[1:24:24] testified God you gave me peace in the
[1:24:27] storm
[1:24:29] that's what the disciples didn't realize
[1:24:30] when they're in the boat with Jesus and
[1:24:32] he's there and he's sleeping and they're
[1:24:33] saying Jesus wake up the storm is going
[1:24:35] to kill us and he says oh ye of little
[1:24:37] faith I'm in the boat with you how can
[1:24:39] you die how can anything happen when I'm
[1:24:42] in the boat with you
[1:24:44] get to the place where you say he's with
[1:24:46] me and then I don't have to worry about
[1:24:47] circumstances
[1:24:49] because my life is in his hands then
[1:24:52] and he's the one that's ordaining
[1:24:53] everything that comes this way
[1:24:57] what about Esau Jacob finally got a
[1:25:00] change and got preserved all of his
[1:25:01] wealth in that
[1:25:03] but the changes in the in in Jacob and
[1:25:05] he walked with a limp after that he
[1:25:06] showed that he had met God
[1:25:10] but what about Esau Issa got wealth
[1:25:13] you got big families he got most of the
[1:25:16] land
[1:25:17] he got everything that he'd really
[1:25:18] wanted except the blessing of God and he
[1:25:21] could never come to God again
[1:25:23] when he sold that Birthright he could
[1:25:24] never come to God that was his turning
[1:25:27] point and he walked away and the
[1:25:28] scripture says that he let me put it
[1:25:30] this way Esau had an itch he couldn't
[1:25:32] scratch
[1:25:33] he knew that he was supposed to be doing
[1:25:35] something and he couldn't do it
[1:25:37] that's the that's got to be the most
[1:25:39] horrible thing is to know to do right
[1:25:41] and not do it
[1:25:43] no you know that you ought to do it you
[1:25:46] know that you ought to want to do it and
[1:25:48] yet the want isn't even there
[1:25:50] but you know what you're supposed to do
[1:25:51] and that's what Esau was dealing with in
[1:25:53] Hebrews Paul talks about he says lest
[1:25:55] there be any fornicator or profane
[1:25:57] person as Esau who for one morsel of
[1:26:00] meat sold his Birthright for one little
[1:26:01] bit of meat he sold his Birthright
[1:26:03] he says for you know that how that
[1:26:05] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:26:07] the blessing so when he realized what
[1:26:09] he'd done when he realized what he'd
[1:26:10] given it up he came back wanting that
[1:26:13] blessing again it says he was rejected
[1:26:15] for he found no place of repentance
[1:26:18] though he sought it carefully with tears
[1:26:21] it calls him a profane person if you go
[1:26:23] to the root word there it means people
[1:26:25] that are unfit to access or know God
[1:26:27] because they approach him outside of
[1:26:30] faith
[1:26:31] they are Godless and sacrilegious
[1:26:34] but you say brother John he's seeking
[1:26:36] God he's seeking repentance and he's
[1:26:39] tearful because he knows he's missed his
[1:26:41] opportunity
[1:26:42] but he can't find a place to actually
[1:26:44] repent
[1:26:46] it wasn't true repentance
[1:26:48] he couldn't come to a place where his
[1:26:50] repentance was acceptable because he was
[1:26:52] doing it because he knew he should do it
[1:26:53] not because it was in him to do it in
[1:26:55] the first place
[1:26:58] Esau tried his best to become a
[1:27:01] Christian and couldn't do it
[1:27:03] the Bible said he wept bitterly seeking
[1:27:05] a place to repent and couldn't find it
[1:27:07] before he was even born God condemned
[1:27:09] him because he knew he was a rotten
[1:27:11] shyster in his heart
[1:27:13] Jacob's name means deceiver shyster
[1:27:17] and that was Jacob's flesh
[1:27:20] but Esau was a shyster inside
[1:27:23] and that's what God was looking at
[1:27:25] God by foreknowledge knew it he said I
[1:27:27] love Jacob and I hate Esau
[1:27:30] and Esau look like the gentleman he
[1:27:32] stayed home taking care of his old blind
[1:27:33] daddy fed the cattle and everything he
[1:27:35] was a good boy and Jacob was a mama's
[1:27:37] boy little old sisified Storyteller
[1:27:39] that's what he was you have to admit it
[1:27:41] the Bible amidst it and brings it he run
[1:27:43] around doing everything hanging around
[1:27:44] with Mama but yet Jacob with all of his
[1:27:46] ups and downs and his sissified ways he
[1:27:49] still had respect to that Birthright he
[1:27:51] says that's the Keynote Esau was twice
[1:27:54] the gentleman of Jacob
[1:27:56] if we had to judge him today to be a
[1:27:58] member of our church you take Esau a
[1:28:00] thousand to one if you didn't know him
[1:28:01] he says but God took Jacob
[1:28:06] why Esau couldn't humble himself
[1:28:10] and he could never find a place to truly
[1:28:12] repent
[1:28:13] God's training brings us to repentance
[1:28:17] always
[1:28:19] listen if if I were to bring Samuel up
[1:28:21] and ask him a question he would give me
[1:28:23] an answer and it would invariably be
[1:28:24] wrong
[1:28:25] but he would have full confidence in his
[1:28:27] answer because he's a three-year-old
[1:28:29] why would he ever think he's wrong
[1:28:31] right
[1:28:33] and when we come to God and we start our
[1:28:35] schooling we're full of confidence
[1:28:37] because we know that we're a child of
[1:28:39] God
[1:28:40] and what we have to do is we have to say
[1:28:41] I don't know anything
[1:28:44] I'm wrong everything I know is wrong
[1:28:47] and Lord you have to teach me what's
[1:28:48] right and that's why he chastens us but
[1:28:51] he brings us to repentance and it's only
[1:28:53] a true child of God can actually repent
[1:28:55] God or Esau had the opportunity and he
[1:28:58] sold it out
[1:28:59] and then he tried to come back to it and
[1:29:01] he just couldn't get to that place amen
[1:29:04] Church the question I ask myself is what
[1:29:06] are we selling out to today
[1:29:09] what is it that holds us back what is it
[1:29:11] that hinders us what is it that refuses
[1:29:13] us from saying I am wrong
[1:29:17] the first thing is always going to be
[1:29:18] Pride
[1:29:19] always going to be Pride because we
[1:29:21] don't want to Humble ourselves we don't
[1:29:23] want to admit that we were wrong
[1:29:26] Esau had a price
[1:29:28] I'm not here to condemn you or call you
[1:29:29] out today I'm asking what is our price
[1:29:32] what is the thing that holds us back
[1:29:34] from stepping into what God has for us
[1:29:35] and leaving everything else behind Cain
[1:29:37] couldn't get past his religious Pride
[1:29:39] right Esau couldn't get past his
[1:29:41] short-term benefits pilate couldn't get
[1:29:44] past the pressure of the mob and Demas
[1:29:46] couldn't get past what the wonderful
[1:29:48] things this world had for him
[1:29:50] everyone's got a price
[1:29:54] Maybe
[1:29:56] what I'm saying is the price is going to
[1:29:57] be offered
[1:29:59] Satan's going to put it in front of us
[1:30:01] and you'll get offers for everything
[1:30:02] you'll get offers for jobs you'll get
[1:30:03] offers for influence you'll get offer
[1:30:05] opportunities to use your gift you'll
[1:30:07] get opportunities for marriage you'll
[1:30:08] get opportunities for relationships
[1:30:10] influence all these different things and
[1:30:11] Satan will throw it in front of us I'm
[1:30:13] not saying that's a problem because it's
[1:30:14] going to happen
[1:30:15] it always happens Satan will always
[1:30:17] throw opportunities in front of us but
[1:30:19] the question is what is it that we latch
[1:30:20] onto that we're not supposed to
[1:30:23] scripture says this in Galatians ye did
[1:30:26] run well
[1:30:28] who did hinder thee
[1:30:30] who did hinder you that you should not
[1:30:32] obey the truth
[1:30:35] we've got to come back to who's in the
[1:30:36] mirror always first
[1:30:38] because in the end I make the decision
[1:30:41] I don't create the opportunities I don't
[1:30:43] create the tests I don't put those
[1:30:45] things in front of Myself by God's grace
[1:30:47] but I'm the one that makes the decision
[1:30:49] and when I step out the who that
[1:30:51] hindered me is not the is not Satan that
[1:30:53] put it in front of me it's me that
[1:30:55] decided to go down that route
[1:30:57] yeah it always comes back to me the buck
[1:30:59] stops with me Church
[1:31:00] nobody controls me as in nobody
[1:31:03] physically no person controls me
[1:31:06] what happens in my family the buck stops
[1:31:08] with me because I'm the final arbiter
[1:31:10] I'm the head of the house I make the
[1:31:11] decisions so when something goes wrong
[1:31:13] it comes back to me
[1:31:16] not the woman that thou gave me Lord
[1:31:18] not the children that she bore Lord It's
[1:31:20] Me because I'm the I'm the man of the
[1:31:22] house I'm the husband I'm the father of
[1:31:24] the house the buck stops with me and so
[1:31:26] yes it might be somebody at work that
[1:31:28] started us on this or it'd be somebody
[1:31:30] at school or it might be something with
[1:31:32] our job or something like that but in
[1:31:34] the end we make the decision we make the
[1:31:36] decision so the who that hinders us it
[1:31:38] might be Satan that's trying it but it's
[1:31:39] us that allows it
[1:31:41] and so the Buck always has to stop with
[1:31:43] us in these things and invariably If
[1:31:45] we're honest we'll Trace what happened
[1:31:47] back to the decision that we made of our
[1:31:49] own free will
[1:31:51] nobody takes our will away from us
[1:31:53] Church we make it of our own free will
[1:31:55] and listen it can start with something
[1:31:57] as simple as missing one service
[1:31:59] watching one movie
[1:32:01] listening to One Wrong song being around
[1:32:04] one wrong person going to one wrong
[1:32:06] website whatever it is one decision will
[1:32:08] lead you to all of those things
[1:32:11] and you say how did I get here
[1:32:13] there's a a minister I know
[1:32:16] and he's a Godly Man a wonderful man a
[1:32:19] wonderful Minister and he had an issue
[1:32:21] where he was having feelings towards a
[1:32:23] woman at work
[1:32:25] and he went and he told his pastor and
[1:32:28] he says I've got to step out of the
[1:32:29] pulpit he says because I got to find out
[1:32:31] where this is coming from
[1:32:33] and he wasn't saying I got to find out
[1:32:34] who did this to me he says I gotta find
[1:32:37] out within me where this is coming from
[1:32:39] because the Holy Spirit does not make me
[1:32:41] attractive to a woman I'm not married to
[1:32:42] I've got a wife and I love my wife he
[1:32:45] says but I'm having an attraction
[1:32:46] towards a woman at work and that's got
[1:32:48] to stop and he willingly pulled himself
[1:32:50] out of the pulpit until he went and he
[1:32:52] rooted that out
[1:32:54] can you imagine how humbling that is as
[1:32:56] a minister to say I'm having issues with
[1:32:59] attractions towards a woman that's not
[1:33:01] my mouth not not my wife
[1:33:03] but he did it he did it because he was
[1:33:06] more he was more concerned about being
[1:33:08] right with God than appearing right to
[1:33:10] his Pastor right to his right wife write
[1:33:12] to his church he humbled himself and he
[1:33:14] pulled himself out of the pulpit until
[1:33:16] he got that sorted and he knew beyond a
[1:33:18] shadow of a doubt where it came from and
[1:33:20] that he had overcome it and that he
[1:33:21] wouldn't have to deal with it again
[1:33:24] that's what God's looking for Lord
[1:33:26] something's wrong
[1:33:28] is it me
[1:33:30] where is it in me
[1:33:32] that's what he's looking for
[1:33:36] church let it not be said that we
[1:33:38] willfully enter into something sometimes
[1:33:39] we do get tricked sometimes it's a
[1:33:41] moment of weakness and believe me Satan
[1:33:43] knows when we're weak doesn't he
[1:33:45] he knows when we're stressed out when
[1:33:47] our emotions are raw he knows when we're
[1:33:49] just tired of doing the same old thing
[1:33:50] we're tired of the battle we're tired of
[1:33:51] the fight and that's when he brings the
[1:33:53] opportunity in that's when he brings the
[1:33:55] Temptation in but let us not go looking
[1:33:57] for it
[1:33:59] listen the scripture says a a just man
[1:34:02] falls seven times
[1:34:04] but he gets up again
[1:34:07] we're going to trip we're going to fall
[1:34:08] but get up again and get back on the
[1:34:10] path that we talked about the straight
[1:34:11] path The Narrow Path and get back to it
[1:34:14] but also let's not put it on somebody
[1:34:16] else
[1:34:17] let's say it's on me I made the decision
[1:34:21] I want to take one more example before
[1:34:22] we close this morning
[1:34:25] Leviticus 10 it says these are these are
[1:34:27] Aaron's sons nadab and abahu the sons of
[1:34:30] Aaron took either of them his sensor and
[1:34:33] put fire therein and put incense thereon
[1:34:35] and offered Strange Fire before the Lord
[1:34:37] which he commanded them not and there
[1:34:40] went out fire from the Lord and devoured
[1:34:42] them and they die before the Lord
[1:34:45] this is a very scary event and I want to
[1:34:47] say one thing this is under the law not
[1:34:49] under grace
[1:34:51] I don't expect this to happen today
[1:34:54] but God doesn't respond well when we add
[1:34:57] to what he said or when we take away
[1:34:58] from it and that's really what I'm
[1:35:00] trying to get at this morning amen God
[1:35:01] spent chapter after chapter if you've
[1:35:03] read Leviticus which I'm still not
[1:35:05] through it
[1:35:07] it's chapter after chapter of ceremony
[1:35:10] after ceremony of sacrifice after
[1:35:12] sacrifice and you must do this and you
[1:35:14] must do this and you must do this and
[1:35:16] you have to do it in the right order and
[1:35:17] this has to be done and that has to be
[1:35:19] done and Priests here's what you have to
[1:35:20] wear and here's your duties day by day
[1:35:22] and and God Must Have Spent hours and
[1:35:24] hours maybe days with Moses letting
[1:35:27] Moses laboriously write this out
[1:35:29] chapter after chapter for everything
[1:35:31] that the priesthood was supposed to do
[1:35:33] and then as soon as it's done as soon as
[1:35:36] Moses delivers that to the priest here's
[1:35:38] your here's your book
[1:35:39] here here's how you operate a service
[1:35:41] now here's what God requires here's what
[1:35:44] God has accepted here's what God says
[1:35:46] you have to do what do nadab and abah
[1:35:48] who do they go and they say we're going
[1:35:51] to bring a new ceremony
[1:35:52] God's given them page after page there's
[1:35:55] no way that they would have even known
[1:35:57] it all at that point and so they came in
[1:35:59] they said we're going to do something
[1:36:00] new and we're going to bring an offering
[1:36:01] to God
[1:36:03] just like Kane
[1:36:04] we're going to bring an offering to God
[1:36:06] we're going to worship God in a way that
[1:36:08] we think is going to be good
[1:36:10] they had this exhaustive list of
[1:36:11] ceremonial duties for the priesthood and
[1:36:13] they and they came in and they brought
[1:36:15] something different what did they do
[1:36:16] they did two things
[1:36:18] they didn't use fire from the Tabernacle
[1:36:20] to light their incense
[1:36:22] what happened was that was Holy Fire and
[1:36:24] the priests weren't allowed to let that
[1:36:25] fire go out that was the duty they had
[1:36:28] to keep the oil topped up at all times
[1:36:29] and that fire had to burn continuously
[1:36:31] and that was a representation of the
[1:36:33] holy spirit in our life
[1:36:35] they didn't use that to light their
[1:36:37] incense and then they didn't offer
[1:36:39] incense as part of their standard duties
[1:36:41] God had said here's how you serve me
[1:36:43] priests and they went and they did
[1:36:45] something that he hadn't told them to do
[1:36:49] in that what they did is they neglected
[1:36:51] to do what he had told them to do
[1:36:54] and that's the lesson for us here is
[1:36:55] that what happens is we come in and we
[1:36:57] say God I'm going to do this for you and
[1:36:59] God I'm going to do that for you and
[1:37:00] Lord here's this offering here's this
[1:37:02] sacrifice and we do like we've talked
[1:37:04] about before these grand gestures and
[1:37:06] God says
[1:37:07] I just want you to do what's here
[1:37:09] I've given you 66 books of what to do
[1:37:12] and you're writing the 67th book because
[1:37:15] that's the way you think you want to do
[1:37:16] it
[1:37:17] and I don't doubt for a second that
[1:37:19] those young men felt that they were
[1:37:21] anointed felt that they were inspired
[1:37:23] they were wanting to do God of service
[1:37:24] they were doing all of these things but
[1:37:26] he had told them what to do and they
[1:37:28] neglected what he told them to do to do
[1:37:30] something that they thought
[1:37:33] and that's all it was it was just a
[1:37:34] thought were they sincere probably were
[1:37:36] they expecting good results yes no doubt
[1:37:38] they were seeking to do something for
[1:37:40] God but they put God out of their
[1:37:42] worship by what they didn't do what he
[1:37:45] told them to do God had said here's how
[1:37:47] you worship me
[1:37:50] and they said
[1:37:51] well we're just going to try this way
[1:37:54] but God had said here's how you worship
[1:37:56] me this is what is acceptable
[1:37:59] this is the way to do it
[1:38:01] and they said we're going to try this
[1:38:03] way see what happens well they saw what
[1:38:05] happened for about a split second before
[1:38:06] they were consumed with fire
[1:38:08] you can't come into God's house with
[1:38:11] your own ideas
[1:38:12] you can't come in with your own thoughts
[1:38:14] you can't come in with your own plan
[1:38:16] can't come in with your own opinions
[1:38:18] that has to die at the door of the
[1:38:20] Tabernacle
[1:38:22] and we're not talking a physical
[1:38:23] building here
[1:38:25] we're talking you can't come to God with
[1:38:27] your own ideas
[1:38:28] he's already given you his and that's
[1:38:30] what he's concerned with will you do
[1:38:32] what he says with his
[1:38:34] he says now Aaron it was his duty to
[1:38:36] light these lamps and those lamps had to
[1:38:38] be lit they had to be continually lit
[1:38:40] hold on to it now look he says look keep
[1:38:42] Reverend and listen these lamps had to
[1:38:44] be lit by the fire that God had lit
[1:38:48] Aaron's sons went in with some strange
[1:38:50] fire and God slew them in the door
[1:38:52] that's right it was strange fire he says
[1:38:54] it should have been the fire that God
[1:38:56] started it's got to be anointed by the
[1:38:58] Holy Spirit
[1:38:59] got to be anointed by it and you can
[1:39:02] bring Strange Fire
[1:39:04] in service you can bring Strange Fire in
[1:39:06] your life where what you're saying Lord
[1:39:08] this is what I'm going to do for you
[1:39:10] and God says well what about the things
[1:39:12] I've asked you to do
[1:39:14] you haven't done those yet how about we
[1:39:16] start with what I've asked you to do son
[1:39:17] or daughter and then maybe we'll talk
[1:39:19] about that but we'll never talk about it
[1:39:21] because he'll tell you what he wants you
[1:39:23] to do sons of God are led by the spirit
[1:39:25] of God
[1:39:27] it's that simple and he's and the Holy
[1:39:29] Spirit will never ever ever
[1:39:31] take you away from this
[1:39:34] so God's saying do what I asked you to
[1:39:36] do
[1:39:37] and that's where you get the results
[1:39:39] the result is not the plus God's word
[1:39:41] plus the results are in God's word stay
[1:39:44] there that's our boundaries
[1:39:46] we don't limit God but God has limited
[1:39:48] himself and said my word is what is
[1:39:50] absolute stay with that and you're going
[1:39:52] to be okay it was so severe what they
[1:39:54] did here that God said to Moses he says
[1:39:56] you tell Aaron he's not even allowed to
[1:39:58] mourn his his son's death he says they
[1:40:01] brought Strange Fire they ought to have
[1:40:03] known better I gave them every reason of
[1:40:05] what to do I showed them everything they
[1:40:06] were supposed to do and they didn't do
[1:40:08] it he says you can't even mourn them
[1:40:10] he says take them bury them outside the
[1:40:12] camp whoever touches them wash
[1:40:14] themselves and they can come in at the
[1:40:15] evening time
[1:40:17] just to touch them
[1:40:19] made somebody unclean because they have
[1:40:21] brought Strange Fire they have brought
[1:40:22] something that God hadn't told them to
[1:40:24] do they ignored everything he said and
[1:40:26] then brought something that was on their
[1:40:27] own making
[1:40:29] Church we're talking about coming to
[1:40:30] adoption
[1:40:32] and when God shows us everything he
[1:40:34] expects of us
[1:40:35] and then we say no but I'll do this
[1:40:38] rebellions in our heart
[1:40:40] rebellions in our heart
[1:40:42] and you'll stay there and I don't have
[1:40:44] the quote here but brother Branham would
[1:40:45] say he said he says here disobedient
[1:40:47] children he says and it'll come to the
[1:40:48] place he says where you'll stay a child
[1:40:50] and God can't do anything with you
[1:40:52] because you keep refusing you keep
[1:40:53] refusing to do what he said and you keep
[1:40:55] doing what you want to do
[1:40:58] there's two traps that come with this as
[1:40:59] we start to close the first is that we
[1:41:02] seek to take something of ours into
[1:41:03] God's Kingdom
[1:41:05] we try and take we we say we go down in
[1:41:08] death when we go into baptism and
[1:41:10] whatnot but what happens is we try and
[1:41:12] take some element of ourself of our
[1:41:13] ideas our thoughts our Doctrine whatever
[1:41:15] it would be and we try and take it with
[1:41:17] us into God's Kingdom
[1:41:18] and it's not that way
[1:41:20] it's not that way if you if you look in
[1:41:23] in the scriptures we see that Abraham
[1:41:25] left everything
[1:41:27] and what he did bring caused problems
[1:41:31] so you can't take anything with you when
[1:41:33] you come into God's kingdom that's why
[1:41:34] it's a new birth that's why you're a new
[1:41:36] creation is that all of that is supposed
[1:41:37] to be left behind as Cain and Abel came
[1:41:41] they want to be acceptable to God that's
[1:41:42] what we as Believers want isn't it we
[1:41:44] want to be acceptable to God
[1:41:46] we want God to say Well done thou good
[1:41:48] and faithful servant enter into the joys
[1:41:49] that I prepared for you that's what
[1:41:51] we're wanting in these things but what
[1:41:54] happens is we try and make ourselves
[1:41:55] more acceptable
[1:41:57] by doing something above and beyond what
[1:41:59] God has told us to do
[1:42:01] that's not what makes us more acceptable
[1:42:02] what makes us acceptable to God is
[1:42:04] obedience to his word simply remember
[1:42:07] that's what that's what Saul did we
[1:42:09] spoke of this a while ago Saul comes and
[1:42:11] he says I I kept some stuff to make an
[1:42:14] offering to God
[1:42:15] it was the word of God plus but anytime
[1:42:17] you add to it what happens is you have
[1:42:19] to take away someplace else that's what
[1:42:20] he did and he was in Disobedience and
[1:42:22] and Samuel the prophet said to Saul he
[1:42:24] says that's it
[1:42:25] he says you try to make yourself more
[1:42:27] acceptable to God and now God is going
[1:42:28] to take the kingdom away from you
[1:42:29] because he can't trust you
[1:42:32] we look at the law
[1:42:34] and I read the the other day a minister
[1:42:36] was preaching he said something along
[1:42:38] the lines of the law was God's response
[1:42:40] to men trying to make themselves
[1:42:41] acceptable to God
[1:42:43] they say God give us something to do and
[1:42:46] we'll do it and God said all right here
[1:42:49] you go
[1:42:50] and they spend thousands of years
[1:42:52] proving they couldn't do it
[1:42:54] but that's what we want to do we want to
[1:42:56] add ourselves into our Salvation we want
[1:42:58] to add ourselves into this and that's
[1:42:59] the Trap is that these two sons of Aaron
[1:43:01] they wanted to add a new way of worship
[1:43:03] and God said no no no no let's just
[1:43:05] stick with what I've got for you already
[1:43:07] I've told you what I want do that and
[1:43:10] leave the rest behind that has no place
[1:43:12] in the Kingdom
[1:43:15] Prophet God said this he says the true
[1:43:16] bride attracts the attention of God by
[1:43:19] keeping his word
[1:43:21] so simple so simple
[1:43:25] keep his word
[1:43:27] that's what gets you ready for
[1:43:28] graduation if I could put it that way
[1:43:35] we go back in the scriptures
[1:43:37] and Moses laid out God told Moses how to
[1:43:39] how to make an altar and how to bring a
[1:43:41] sacrifice to God
[1:43:43] listen to this he says the altar an
[1:43:45] altar of Earth Thou shalt make unto me
[1:43:48] and shall sacrifice thereon thy burnt
[1:43:50] offerings and thy peace offerings thy
[1:43:52] sheep and thine oxen in all places where
[1:43:54] I record my name I will come unto thee
[1:43:56] and I will bless thee so the standard
[1:43:58] altar that any man could could use was
[1:44:01] simple dirt
[1:44:02] just dirt
[1:44:03] you built up a mound of dirt and then
[1:44:05] you sacrificed on top of it
[1:44:07] and what was it it was showing the
[1:44:09] sacrifice can't be about your works
[1:44:12] it's not about what you did it's not
[1:44:13] about how you prepared it it's not about
[1:44:15] how you shaped it it's not about how you
[1:44:16] turn that dirt into something better
[1:44:18] it's just dirt
[1:44:20] we're just dirt
[1:44:22] we're just dirt
[1:44:23] and he's saying don't bring anything
[1:44:25] special to it because you're not a part
[1:44:27] of this it's not about you it's about
[1:44:29] the sacrifice and then he says if that
[1:44:31] will make me an altar of stones will you
[1:44:33] say well I need an altar at my house and
[1:44:35] and dirt isn't just going to look good
[1:44:37] so let's do it up in stone like the
[1:44:39] house he says if you make an altar of
[1:44:40] stone you shall not build it of hewn
[1:44:42] Stone
[1:44:43] in other words he says you can't take
[1:44:44] those rocks and shape them
[1:44:46] and make them fit perfectly and look
[1:44:48] good
[1:44:49] because you've added to it he says for
[1:44:51] if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou
[1:44:54] Hast polluted it
[1:44:56] if you add to the sacrifice you pollute
[1:44:59] it
[1:45:01] if you take what is supposed to be about
[1:45:03] God and a representation of you and add
[1:45:06] yourself to it there's problems and God
[1:45:08] says you pollute it I won't accept it
[1:45:10] it's got to be natural it's got a way to
[1:45:12] God be the way that God used it the way
[1:45:14] that God made it amen God had provided
[1:45:16] the dirt God had provided the stone and
[1:45:18] he says you make it out of what I
[1:45:20] provided not what you've shaped because
[1:45:22] as soon as you touch it you pollute it
[1:45:25] second trap
[1:45:26] and this one I think is more subtle
[1:45:29] so the first was that we seek to bring
[1:45:30] our things into God's kingdom but listen
[1:45:33] to this it's that we seek to bring God
[1:45:35] into our kingdom
[1:45:37] now you say but John that's exactly what
[1:45:39] I want I want God in my life
[1:45:41] no I said God in your kingdom
[1:45:44] because whoever's Kingdom it is is king
[1:45:46] or queen
[1:45:48] so if I bring God into my life I'm the
[1:45:50] king of my kingdom
[1:45:51] and he can't be Lord and King because
[1:45:53] I'm the king because it's my kingdom
[1:45:56] but I've got to go outside the camp
[1:45:59] I've got to leave everything like
[1:46:01] Abraham did and I've got to go to his
[1:46:03] kingdom because in his kingdom he's the
[1:46:05] king
[1:46:07] see what happens is we say Lord here's
[1:46:10] my life here's my here's my job here's
[1:46:12] my family here's my relationships here's
[1:46:14] my finances Lord come in and bless it
[1:46:17] that's not what God asked us to do
[1:46:19] he said leave everything you've got and
[1:46:22] come to me and I'll take care of you
[1:46:24] because what we do when we do this this
[1:46:26] is what it looks like is we say God
[1:46:27] bless my decisions
[1:46:30] no we're supposed to be hidden in Christ
[1:46:33] so it's not supposed to be our decision
[1:46:35] it's supposed to be his decision it's
[1:46:38] not supposed to be Lord bless my
[1:46:39] leadership it's supposed to be Lord
[1:46:40] you're leading me so I'm trusting your
[1:46:42] blessing see what we're doing is we're
[1:46:44] asking God to come in and confirm what
[1:46:46] we've decided rather than saying Lord
[1:46:48] You're the filter you're the decider
[1:46:51] you're the order Giver you're the
[1:46:52] provider so I'm just here and whatever
[1:46:55] happens is going to be because you made
[1:46:57] it happen not because I've asked your
[1:46:58] blessing into my life
[1:47:00] because what happens otherwise is we're
[1:47:02] seeking to bring God into our kingdom
[1:47:04] and he's trying to get us out of ours
[1:47:05] into his
[1:47:07] and so we're literally going in opposite
[1:47:09] directions but we're in all sincerity
[1:47:11] saying I want Jesus in my life no no he
[1:47:13] says you can't have him in your life
[1:47:15] you've got to go into his life you got
[1:47:17] to lay your life down and you've got to
[1:47:18] go into his kingdom
[1:47:19] remember he said to the disciples except
[1:47:21] a man leave his father and his mother
[1:47:23] and these different things he can't he
[1:47:24] can't come into the kingdom they said
[1:47:25] did we not forsake all
[1:47:27] he says you have and because of it
[1:47:29] you'll have a benefit because of it but
[1:47:30] you've got to forsake all you've got to
[1:47:32] lay it all down how many times have we
[1:47:34] preached Lord that that he expects us to
[1:47:37] die out
[1:47:37] we die out and that means we come in as
[1:47:40] a new creation into the kingdom of God
[1:47:43] that's what he's looking for not saying
[1:47:45] Lord bless me because I've done this but
[1:47:47] Lord I'm in your will Lord I'm in your
[1:47:50] way and I'm trusting the blessing will
[1:47:51] follow
[1:47:52] that's what he's looking for amen
[1:47:54] remember what he said earlier in that
[1:47:56] quote
[1:47:57] he said God Wants You on The Altar
[1:48:01] so rather than saying God come to me
[1:48:04] scripture says I will call all men unto
[1:48:06] me
[1:48:07] so we got to go to him he doesn't come
[1:48:08] to us
[1:48:10] he calls us and he Woos us and he does
[1:48:12] all these things but we got to come to
[1:48:13] him
[1:48:14] we got to forsake all and go to him in
[1:48:16] these things
[1:48:22] what we're looking for is that hidden
[1:48:23] life
[1:48:24] amen
[1:48:28] where my thoughts my opinions
[1:48:31] my emotions my desires my preferences
[1:48:34] they have no place
[1:48:36] no place
[1:48:38] I have them
[1:48:39] but they have no place
[1:48:41] because why
[1:48:42] I've taken on the mind of Christ
[1:48:45] I've taken on the Life of Christ
[1:48:47] I'm held by the word that he was held by
[1:48:50] and so the results will come regardless
[1:48:52] of what it looks like
[1:48:54] and we'll stay there and so it's not
[1:48:56] going to be Lord bless what I'm doing
[1:48:59] saying Lord I'm doing what you told me
[1:49:01] to do
[1:49:03] see the twist
[1:49:05] he's a Twist we're asking him to come
[1:49:06] into us and he say no your place is in
[1:49:09] me you're never seeing this you've never
[1:49:11] seen the scripture where he has to come
[1:49:14] out of where he is to bring to go to us
[1:49:16] in that way we come into him we're a
[1:49:18] part of his body he's not a part of our
[1:49:20] body
[1:49:21] they're one we're one I understand those
[1:49:23] things but we have to leave where we are
[1:49:25] and go to him
[1:49:26] and that's where we're going to find
[1:49:27] what we're looking for amen God bless
[1:49:29] you let's stand this morning we've
[1:49:31] talked about Redemption for so long and
[1:49:33] the Very premise of redemption is that
[1:49:35] it takes you out of where you are and it
[1:49:37] takes you into Christ
[1:49:39] and so for asking him to come into our
[1:49:41] portion we're actually refusing his
[1:49:43] Redemption
[1:49:44] because we're staying where we're at
[1:49:45] rather than moving on to where he is
[1:49:47] amen
[1:49:48] well when we get that straight when
[1:49:50] we're hidden in him
[1:49:51] I'm not anointed
[1:49:53] he's my anointing
[1:49:55] it's his gift it's his Blessing it's his
[1:49:58] word it's his action it's all him it's
[1:50:00] all him it's all him because he's the
[1:50:02] king and I'm just responding to that and
[1:50:05] then I don't have to worry about it
[1:50:07] I don't have to worry about any of it I
[1:50:08] just trust and I rest because I'm in his
[1:50:10] kingdom now
[1:50:11] if I'm in my kingdom that's when I worry
[1:50:13] when I'm in my thoughts when I'm in my
[1:50:15] preferences that's when I worry because
[1:50:16] that's where trouble is
[1:50:18] that's where Satan can get a hold on me
[1:50:19] is when I'm in my kingdom but if I can
[1:50:21] say Lord I want to be in your kingdom
[1:50:22] Lord I want to be found in your word
[1:50:24] then that's where my rest is that's
[1:50:26] where my joy is that's where my peace is
[1:50:27] is because that's where he is and I've
[1:50:30] surrendered everything to him amen
[1:50:32] man we're not inviting him in we're
[1:50:34] gathered into him already and we're
[1:50:36] resting in Heavenly places with him as
[1:50:38] the scripture says amen church I want to
[1:50:40] be hidden away
[1:50:42] I want to be so hidden that people won't
[1:50:44] understand anything I do because it
[1:50:47] makes no sense
[1:50:48] in their way of thinking
[1:50:50] but it makes perfect sense according to
[1:50:52] the word of God Amen and we've seen it
[1:50:54] each one of us has seen it as we've made
[1:50:55] decisions in our life as we we've walked
[1:50:58] away from opportunities as we've turned
[1:50:59] things down as as we've taken the the
[1:51:02] offenses and the hurts and these things
[1:51:03] that come our way and people say why do
[1:51:05] you do it why do you do it
[1:51:08] because it's Christ to me the hope of
[1:51:10] glory that's the only thing that keeps
[1:51:11] us doing it if it was my kingdom I'd
[1:51:13] have walked away
[1:51:15] but when I'm in him I can't walk away
[1:51:17] I'm bound to him he's my king he's my
[1:51:19] Lord he's my savior amen
[1:51:21] amen I want to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:51:23] every single moment of my life
[1:51:25] amen that's what I desire more than
[1:51:27] anything Lord Lead Me Guide Me
[1:51:31] show me your way
[1:51:33] and then help me to walk in it
[1:51:36] that's what keeps Rebellion out
[1:51:39] when we say Lord I know there's nothing
[1:51:41] good in this flesh
[1:51:43] nothing good
[1:51:44] and that means I need you every moment
[1:51:46] of every day to overcome what's laying
[1:51:49] in front of me amen let's bow our heads
[1:51:51] each one
[1:51:52] Heavenly Father
[1:51:54] Lord It's a sovereign service this
[1:51:56] morning I know
[1:51:59] but Lord I'm not looking at anyone else
[1:52:00] this morning
[1:52:04] Lord I'm looking in the mirror
[1:52:08] but we're not looking to the left or the
[1:52:10] right
[1:52:12] oh but I'm looking at you
[1:52:15] Lord and then I look at my life and I
[1:52:16] say Lord I know there's more
[1:52:19] there's more surrender
[1:52:22] or there's more dying out there's more
[1:52:23] humbling
[1:52:25] Lord there's more correction I
[1:52:26] absolutely need Heavenly Father
[1:52:28] so Lord I'm raising my hands this
[1:52:30] morning
[1:52:32] Lord I'm praying your grace
[1:52:35] Lord keep us humble
[1:52:37] Lord keep us seeking your will in your
[1:52:40] way
[1:52:41] Lord let us do the harder work of
[1:52:43] patiently waiting for you
[1:52:45] Lord not driving forward not bulldozing
[1:52:47] Lord not insisting on these things
[1:52:49] but Lord let us rest on you
[1:52:52] let us trust that you do all things well
[1:52:54] Heavenly Father
[1:52:56] Lord You're our great provider
[1:52:58] you're our healer you're our deliverer
[1:53:01] Lord You're the ever-present god in our
[1:53:03] midst and Lord we're trusting that this
[1:53:06] morning
[1:53:07] Lord would you touch your people
[1:53:10] Lord where we're wrong help us to admit
[1:53:12] it
[1:53:13] Lord there's none perfect there's none
[1:53:16] good
[1:53:18] Lord but through your blood
[1:53:19] or we're acceptable to you
[1:53:22] Lord let us humble ourselves this
[1:53:24] morning Lord forgive me
[1:53:26] forgive me Lord where I fail where I
[1:53:29] have failed Lord
[1:53:31] knowing that the blood is sufficient
[1:53:34] but Lord may your grace help me to learn
[1:53:37] or to admit
[1:53:39] to make a right Lord
[1:53:40] and to move on in you
[1:53:43] Lord touch your people we pray now in
[1:53:45] Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[1:53:47] amen

[1:56:57] King I found the truth
[1:57:02] that I've been searching for I found it
[1:57:08] all
[1:57:10] when I found the Lord
[1:57:14] I found it all
